3473294,4,B001AXU1FA,"In September of 1969, Abbie Hoffman and fellow radical activists Jerry Rubin, David Dellinger, Tom Hayden, Rennie Davis, John Froines, and Lee Weiner were hauled into court along with Black Panther Bobby Seale on a grand jury indictment for allegedly conspiring to incite the massive anti-Vietnam war protests and resulting violent mayhem that transpired in the Chicago environs during the 1968 Democratic Convention. What resulted is arguably the most overtly political ""show trial"" in American history.

Using a mlange of animation, archival footage and voiceover re-creation by well-known actors, Brett Morgen expands even further on the eye-catching multimedia technique that he and co-director Nanette Burstein used in their 2002 doc The Kid Stays in the Picture.

The bulk of the animated sequences are re-enactments from the trial itself, with dialog lifted directly from courtroom transcripts (and trust me, no rewrites were required because you couldn't make this stuff up). This visual technique perfectly encapsulates the overall circus atmosphere of the trial, which was largely fueled by Hoffman and Rubin's amusing yet effective use of ""guerilla theatre"" to disrupt the proceedings and accentuate what they felt to be the inherent absurdity of the charges. The courtroom players are voiced by the likes of Nick Nolte (as prosecutor Thomas Foran), Jeffrey Wright (as Bobby Seale) and the late Roy Scheider (in full ""fuddy-duddy"" mode as Judge Hoffman).

Do not, however, mistake this film as a gimmicky and superficial ""cartoon"" that only focuses on the hijinx. There is plenty of evidence on hand, in the form of archival footage (fluidly incorporated by editor Stuart Levy) to remind us that these were very serious times. The footage of the Chicago police wildly bludgeoning any and all who crossed their path (demonstrator and innocent bystander alike) still has the power to shock and physically sicken the viewer. There is a protracted montage of this violence that seems to run on for at least 10 minutes; sensitive viewers may find this sequence  upsetting.

I have to give kudos for the excellent soundtrack; or rather, for what songs are not on the soundtrack. For once, a film about the ""turbulent 60s"" does not feature ""Fortunate Son"" by CCR, ""Get Together"" by the Youngbloods or (most notably) ""For What It's Worth"" by Buffalo Springfield (you can always re-watch Forrest Gump if you wish to wallow in trite 60s clichs). Appropriately incendiary music by Rage Against the Machine, The Beastie Boys and Eminem balances well with less-plundered period songs from Black Sabbath (""War Pigs""), Steppenwolf (""Monster"")  and the MC5 (""Kick Out the Jams"").

If I have any quibble with Chicago 10, it is a minor one. Although some of us are old enough (ahem) to remember the high-profile media coverage of the trial and grok the circumstances surrounding it, perhaps a little hindsight analysis or discussion of historical context would have been helpful for younger viewers. Perhaps Morgen wanted to steer clear of the usual clichs, like parading a series of talking heads with gray ponytails, sentimentalizing and waxing poetically about the halcyon days of yore. Besides, if you ""remember"" the 60s, you probably weren't there anyway, right?",1219881600,10,3260,5.269749518304431
3473295,5,B001AXU1FA,"This was a fantastic film. The information itself was very interesting, but the filmmakers put a spin on it, and in a completely unbiased way, the explain what happened at the convention and the trial using state-of-the-art animation techniques, moving pictures, archival footage, and great music. A must see for any baby-boomer, people interested in politics, and modern hippies.",1219795200,2,380,5.4576271186440675
3473296,3,B001AXU1FA,"If are a baby boomer - or just a few years older - the 1968 Democratic Convention (held in Chicago) is imbedded in your memory, just as the dates when JFK, RFK and MLK were assassinated. I remember those years well and, though I grew up far from Chicago, the evening news brought home the events that were occurring both in the Convention Center and in the streets, as the Yippies (Youth International Party) tried to protest the war in Vietnam - or rather the US involvement there. These weren't small protests by a group of renegades. There were often 25,000 or more unarmed college-age individuals who were holding rallies and marches with out weapons. When denied a permit to protest peacefully they were confronted by armed police. The eight ""leaders"" (well, really 7, since the sole Black individual charged with the crime of  confrontational assembly, Bobby Seale, wasn't even in Chicago during the Convention) were put on trial. It's their story and the events which took place during the Convention which form the basis for this documentary.

Memories of the events - and memories of hearing the YIP leaders speaking at my college gymnasium - were rekindled as I watch the news footage compiled and edited by Drirect Brett Morgen. This unnarrated footage fills about 60% of the film. The remaining 40% uses the transcripts of the trial. Because no cameras were permitted in court, Morgen has the words spoken by well-known actors and uses computer-generated animation (a la Richard Linklater) to show the cout scenes. So if you are picking this up in a video store based on the names of Hank Azaria, Roy Scheider, Liev Schreiber and Nick Nolte on the cover, don't expect to really SEE them. And, I'm still not sure why the defendants, known for 40 years as the ""Chicago 8"" are now called the ""Chicago 10"". (Even in the firm they are referred to as the ""8 Defendants"".

The story is important and we're still fighting a war in a far off country. So in many ways things haven't changed. I was also disappointed to see that Paramount (which is releasing this film on DVD) as basically added NO EXTRAS. (The ONE extra is a 95 second ""remix video"" of scenes from the film. By the way, you will hear little, if any, music from 1968 in the film. It's mostly rap (which wasn't even around in those days - and the only Blacks you will see in the film are Bobby Seale, one juror, the courtroom guards and the inner city woman who says she's glad she's not ""downtown"" where all the protesters are.

For a company that prides itself on releasing Al Gore's ""An Inconvenient Truth"" - and promotes this inside the package, they could have added SOME additional content to further discussion of this landmark (though embarrassing) moment in U.S. history.

So it's well done, and I hope it gets further exposure. (It played Sundance last year.). I just hope that buyers realize that the actors on the cover are not really seen in the film and, though ""Comedy"" is mentioned on the cover, there is not one funny moment in the 90-minute running time.

3473297,3,B001AXU1FA,I purchased this video to use for training. It has a great collection of archival film of the events surrounding the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. The animation - the court room scenes - are interesting. Many people may find that part disappointing.,1284336000,,267,5.090909090909091
3473298,4,B001AXU1FA,"Okay, I have spilled plenty of ink over the past couple of years trying to look at some of the events in the key political year for my generation, 1968, and draw some conclusions, lessons if you will, from that period. And as fate would have it I am eminently qualified to do so here on this particular film, in an odd sort of way. The events of that decisive year are brought into focus by the central subject of this film, the debacle of the Democratic Party Convention in Chicago in August of that year. I know this one well.

And why am I a good witness to those events as portrayed here? In a certain sense I was on the other side of the barricades. Then. As I have explained elsewhere in more detail in 1968 I was knee-deep, no waist-deep, in the main task that I had set for my political life at the time, beating one Richard Milhous Nixon, without question the major political villain of my youth. Starting out that year totally devoted to the Robert Kennedy campaign (and actually earlier as I was part of the movement that tried to draft him to run for president in 1967), after his assassination in June I dusted off my pants and went to work for the campaign of one Hubert Horatio Humphrey. Therefore I was inside the ""big tent"" of the Democratic Party at that time and no one can accuse me of anything but the mildest bemused sympathy (on the Vietnam war question, if not the solution) with the doings outside the ""tent"".

Fast forward. Now, however, as this film footage of the events around the convention site amply demonstrates, and as the graphically captured brutal actions by the rogue Chicago police and other officials amply reveal this was a sickening display of governmental hubris (on all levels), and authority run amok. The verdict on those governmental actions at the time? No, not, as a rational person might expect, a skewering of police and their superiors but the bringing of charges against the leaders of the demonstrators, those who were maimed, gassed and otherwise abused by governmental actions.

And the harassment did not end there. Obviously the government thought it had a slam-dunk case to put before a Chicago jury with a cast of characters like Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin and Bobby Seale, who to be kind, in those days, if you were respectable citizen you would not want living next door to you, particularly in Chicago. In the end, as has occurred on more than one occasion, the charges against the ""conspirators"" were, mostly, overturned. But there is a lesson to be learned about the price of such actions, those charges were not overturned before many financial and political resources were brought to bear for the defense. This is hardly an argument against such actions, but rather to point out that when you go after the ""monster"" you best be prepared for the blowback.

This film works on two tracks as it tries, I think, to reach a younger audience not familiar with the events that the rest of us have permanently etched in our brains. The producers have used the eminently respectable one of the actual film footage interspersed with the more experimental one of using animation to do the heavy duty work of portraying the antics on both sides, in the circus-war, oops, inside Judge Julius Hoffman's courtroom. I believe that the jury is still out (no pun intended) on the effectiveness of that medium to bring out the drama of the events portrayed. Perhaps for a younger audience not familiar with the events this is an adequate teaching tool. However, the segueing between, let us say, defendant Yippie Abbie Hoffman in animation ridiculing his having the same last name as the judge presiding over the trial and then flipping to a ""real time"" pep talk to the gathered Yippie tribes was disconcerting, at least to this viewer. Still, all in all, any time that we get to look back at events which formed a decisive part of our youth we should grab it with both hands. And hope today's youth now have it permanently etched in their brains as well.",1264291200,,4003,4.6417489421720735

3473300,5,B001AXU1FA,"A Bakshi-esque flashback to one of pivotal events of the 60's... the trial of the Chicago 10 and the events surrounding the disastrous Chicago Democratic Party Convention.

Weaving documentary footage, computer animation and re-enactments together w/ a lot of groovy neo-psychadelic music by the likes of  Rage Against The Machine, Black Sabbath, Steppenwolf, the Beastie Boys and others, it is intense, colorful and laden with humor and irony.

Ridiculously well cut and convincingly stylistically authentic, the film features the voices of Nick Nolte, Hank Zaria and Roy Scheider and a team of top notch voice actors recruited for the animation sequences.  --  Elements of WOODSTOCK as well as student films and documentaries of the era are present.

Though only put out in limited release, it aired nationally on PBS as part of the program INDEPENDENT LENS... but it is ironic.  Though laden with the independent spirit, it reminds me a lot of the type of film Oliver Stone might make, only with a 30 million dollar budget.  - - In part this is demonstration of how far computer editing and animation technology have come in recent years... but in other part, it shows how far a gifted director and production team can go when working on what is clearly a very personal labor of love.  (In an interview the director confirms that the film was made on a very low budget, but he penned out a ""dream cast"" anyway, actually called the actors, put the script in front of them, and got almost everyone he wanted (!)

One element I particular like about Morgan's style is that there is no pretentious narration --  The scenes themselves tell the story... and boy is it well told.  Hopefully this guy is going to make a lot more films - - Ken Burns and Michael Moore might be the current ""superstars"" of the genre... but if this guy can do it a few more times, boy are they going to have to move over and make some space !",1254009600,,1917,4.6726190476190474

3473302,5,B001AXU1FA,"In March of 1968 a secret meeting of anti-war groups took place in northern Illinois to discuss what types of protests should be organized for the Democratic National Convention to be held in Chicago that year. The discussions were led by two groups; MOBE (Mobilization Against the War) represented by David Dellinger, Rennie Davis, and Tom Hayden and the newly formed YIPPIES (Youth International Party) represented by Abbie Hoffman and Jerry Rubin. The protests were being stepped up in response to President Lyndon Johnson's increased involvement in Vietnam which so far had resulted in nearly 20,000 American dead and countless wounded. In addition to the draft call being increased from 17,000 ""over a period of time"" to 35,000 per month, Johnson had also increased American military presence from 75,000 to 125,000 in one fell swoop.

The two groups had very different approaches to the anti-war movement. MOBE was a traditional group with straight forward, easily understood methods. ""We are coming to Chicago...not to disrupt the convention, not to confront the police, the National Guard troops, or the men of the United States Army. But to challenge the policies of militarization that have been felt so strongly and brutally in Vietnam,"" said MOBE co-founder Rennie Davis. The YIPPIES on the other hand were wild and crazy guys who believed that politics had become all lights and magic with which the current administration dazzled and then duped the public. Abbie Hoffman said,""...politics is the way you live not who you support. Its not in terms of rallies or speeches or political programs. Its in terms of image and transforming people's lives."" When you put the MOBE and the YIPPIES together something was going to happen--and Chicago's despotic Mayor Richard Daley wasn't going to like it.

CHICAGO 10 is an exciting, vibrant recreation of the anti-war protests surrounding the Democratic Convention that resulted in the arrests and subsequent trials of Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, Tom Hayden, Rennie Davis, David Dellinger,Lee Weiner, John Froines, and Bobby Seale, co-founder of the Black Panthers who had only been IN Chicago for 2 or 3 hours. You may say, that's only 8 and you're right. The other 2 are their lawyers Leonard Weinglass and William Kunstler, who racked up almost 5 years in contempt of court charges during the trial. The film is composed of both live action footage of the real events (most notably the actual the attempts to march upon the convention center and later attacks by police and National Guardsmen upon the marchers) and animation that looks as if it were rotoscoped. The animation is used primarily for the courtroom scenes and uses an extremely colorful pallette, that gives everything a garish, almost carnival-like appearance--which is very appropriate given the nature of the trial. This is such a beautifully crafted film that I'm afraid I could never do it justice. The real tale is told as two threads, one of the trial and the other of the protest march that finally twist together to form the complete story of what actually happened and who these people really were.

How you respond to CHICAGO 10 will be completely determined by your political leanings. If you're a conservative who feels that all forms of bureaucracy should be revered then you will undoubtedly feel little sympathy for the protesters as they get the bejezus beaten out of them by the Chicago cops, who still have a tendency to do that to innocent people for no apparent reason on occasion.  If you were a liberal who remembers those halcyon days then this film is a great way to see how old you really are. If you now look at these guys as rude little *&^%$(&^ who had it coming, then you should probably fill out that card that the AARP sent you because you are now officially old and your newfound conservative views reflect your age. As for me, I always found Abbie Hoffman to be rude and abrasive. and I doubted that the YIPPIE'S theatrical antics such as their attempt to levitate the Pentagon were ever helpful to the peace movement. But nobody deserved what Daley dished out. THE WHOLE WORLD WAS WATCHING US in 1968 and what they saw was a nation that sadly couldn't live up to its own standards.",1234656000,3,4237,4.921678321678321

3473304,4,B001AXU1FA,"""Chicago 10"" is the best documentary I have ever seen of the 1968 Chicago Democratic Convention protest. That I'm aware, it's also only the second movie of the Chicago 7+1 trial, which grew out of the U.S. government's attempt to justify the use of excessive force against convention protesters. Counterproductively for the government, the trial immortalized the eight defendants and their two lawyers for which this movie is named.

I've never seen most of this filmed protest footage. At last, there is enough original 1968 material organized in one movie, to visualize the Chicago physical situation experienced by perhaps 40,000 people on all sides. The documentary is presented by sequential intercutting of trial transcript and recreation video animations, with 1968 actuality films, TV, radio, and audio recordings. Historians can now see what was happening almost sequentially in several large outdoor venues.

The 1970 Chicago Seven trial transcript helps organize the original 1968 protest footage. The shockingly bloody park and street confrontation scenes keep the trial's political philosophy arguments relevant and interesting.

A mixed classical and rock movie score is alien in a documentary, and some of the classical pieces are strikingly inappropriate. I recall much of the music as excessively loud. But enough of everything else worked that a defense of this overwhelming music as avant-garde art is acceptable to me.

The ""Chicago 10"" production device of realistic human animation solves the problem of adding visual interest to audio-only original recordings, and blends well with full voice-over animation of the trial's transcript-only original record. 1968 was an era on the cusp of transition from black-and-white to color film. The jarring alternations between the two technologies are motivated by the unfolding street action, and are a possibly unique feature of this production - mimicked even by its own animations.

I recommend this Brett Morgen documentary for its innovatively blended presentation of two difficult-to-understand perspectives of the same politically earthshaking event. I'll ask my library to purchase a copy of the DVD, but unfortunately it will not include the short piece which PBS's Independent Lens used to fill out the last 20 minutes of its time slot for ""Chicago 10"" on 2008-10-22.

The short piece was a 1970 British ""World in Action / The Big news"" report on the Chicago Seven trial. It proved to be critical to me for an explanation by Chicago Seven lawyer Leonard Weinglass of the devious 1968 Anti-Riot law under which the defendants were convicted and sentenced for a thought crime. It criminalized the crossing of state lines with the intent to threaten property or people, even if the threat was not carried out.

Though not seen in ""Chicago 10"", professional media has made the 1968 protesters famous for mass chanting, ""The whole world is watching"". Now the future world can almost eyewitness these events, brilliantly expanded beyond merely professional moving images.",1224720000,2,3039,5.3852631578947365
3473305,2,B001AXU1FA,"""Chicago 10"" uses a curious mix of animation and actual footage to tell the story of the demonstrations at the site of the 1968 Chicago Democratic National Convention and of the conspiracy trial that followed. The story interweaves the conspiracy trial of Yippie leaders Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin (and others) with material about the demonstrations that landed them in hot water.

As a person who grew up in the 1960s with the same inchoate rage expressed by many of the demonstrators, I came to the film with sympathy for their goal of opposing America's attempts to extend its power overseas by demanding an end to an unpopular and unjust war. But in spite of their intentions, the filmmakers crafted a document with a very different conclusion.

There's something touching and maddening about the defendants. Except for Bobby Seale - the only one who seems to appreciate larger issues and forces at play -- the defendants alternate between amusement over the court's antique decorum and procedures, and horror that this same silly court might actually deprive them of their very real liberty. The filmmakers do a fairly good job of depicting the comedy that was going on in court. Government prosecutor Tom Foran seemed to overreach in his assessment that the wild-haired, foul-mouthed clowns at the defendant's table were dangerous to the American way of life. Judge Julius Hoffman was played as a doddering fool, incredulous that the decorum of his court was being disrupted. The defendants come across as naively disbelieving the characterizations of their behavior. This required a certain amount of license on the part of the animators, since the trial transcripts would not have recorded the facial expressions made by the defendants when confronted by evidence from government witnesses. The obvious intent of the filmmakers was to tame the reputations of the radicals on trial. But, sympathetic as I was to their cause, or perhaps because I am a little more mature than I was 40 years ago, I found Hoffman and Ruben's lack of discipline and seriousness off-putting and counterproductive.

Speaking of counter-productive, the film unintentionally (I think) helped made the case for the conservative view that Hoffman, et al were dangerous, prone to violence, and in need of controlling. Archival materials shows the Yippie's activities as swinging between brilliant, anarchic street theater (whose supposed purpose was to end the violence in Vietnam) and a rageful, profane, adolescent intention to reach the convention headquarters ""by any means necessary."" The Yippies, unwilling or afraid to take themselves seriously, failed to establish clear goals and lines of authority. The result was a series of running battles with the police with no clear objectives other than to oppose the demands of those in authority. There's a reason that much of this material has not seen the light of day in four decades -- it undermines the case that the demonstrators were innocent victims of police and National Guard aggression.

Yet, governmental aggression there was. Police--black and white but seemingly middle-aged and middle class - were more than a little willing to stand their ground against the disorganized mobs in the streets. There was little of negotiation or discussion, and no alternative but violent confrontation. The National Guard seemed especially prone to threats, pointing their guns and bayonets menacingly -- at one point pushing them inside a car driven by a middle aged woman.

The film fails seriously by ignoring the effects of the demonstrations on the Democratic Convention and on American policy. For all their passion and panache, the demonstrators managed to guarantee the defeat of the Democrat's candidate, Hubert Humphrey, electing Richard Nixon, who escalated the war into Laos and Cambodia before negotiating a withdraw in 1974. More problematically, they turned much of the electorate - Nixon's aggrieved ""Silent Majority"" -- against them. The filmmakers, by refusing to provide an evolved view of the 1968 Chicago riots, fail in the same way that the demonstrations did, neglecting to suggest a higher goal than immediate satisfaction and easy analysis. It's perhaps not surprising that we see so few shots of the convention that was derailed by the antics outside the Hilton.

Though ""Chicago 10"" fails miserably to make its case on behalf of the defendants, it does add to the cause of history - if only to provide a showcase for rarely seen film of the events of the period. It is fun to see the goofy/sincere dress and mannerisms of the 1960s in their varied and infinite glory. If it instructive, the film teaches the importance of discipline, training, seriousness and effective leadership, especially in the cause of overturning popular governmental policy.",1224374400,,4807,5.21216041397154
3473306,5,B001AXU1FA,"The CHICAGO 10 DVD is a gripping movie about the 1968 trial of the ""Chicago 8"" (later the Chicago 7 when Bobby Seale was separated from the others) who were charged with conspiracy and inciting a riot, among other charges, for the massive demonstrations that took place during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. People, especially young people, from all over the USA convened to protest the Vietnam War when the massive march went awry and cops began attacking the marchers.

Anyway, the movie combines animation and archival footage of the events that took place during that August 1968. The animation is mainly in the courtroom, which is based on the court transcripts. Everything else is shown through footage either from news feeds or amateur video.

I found the movie gripping as the action switches back and forth from the court house trial to the actions happening during the marches etc., culminating in the mess that was captured by news cameras covering the convention of police unloading on helpless people.

The event: the riots that broke out when an assortment of ""hippies, yippees and just plain kids"" took to the streets to protest the US' continuing involvement in the Vietnam War.  The march and sit-in, originally billed as a ""Festival of Life,"" turned violent when the ramped-up police and National Guard forces, estimated at well over 25,000 strong, began tear-gassing and billy-clubbing the demonstrators on the last night of the convention - in full view of the nation's citizens who watched in shock and amazement as it unfolded on their TV sets at home.

The demonstrations were largely organized by The National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam, from whose leadership ranks would come many of the men destined to go down in the annals of anti-establishment folklore as the Chicago 7 (the 10 of the title comes from the inclusion of Black Panther co-founder Bobby Seale, who had his trial severed, and the two lawyers).  After the incident, these men were placed on trial, charged with conspiracy and with violating the Anti-Riot Act of 1968.  All seven - David Dellinger, Tom Hayden, Abbie Hoffman, William Kunstler, Jerry Rubin, Rennie Davis and John Froines - were to wind up spending at least some time behind bars for their ""crimes.""

Written and directed by Brett Morgan, the documentary ""Chicago 10"" blends amazing archival footage with animated re-enactments of the trial - based on actual court transcripts - with A-list actors like Hank Azaria, Nick Nolte, Mark Ruffalo, Roy Scheider and Liev Schreiber providing the voices.

The movie provides a fascinating glimpse into not only those turbulent times but the minds of the men who helped to bring them about.  For instance, it's amusing to note how the defendants treated the trial itself almost as if it were some form of subversive street-theater, in the hopes of antagonizing the conservative judge, Julius Hoffman (they really so seem to have gotten under his skin), and destroying the court's authority in the process.  Also, in the months when the trial was going on, the defendants would fan out across the country on their off-hours, lecturing on colleges campuses - with most of the speaking fees going to defray the cost of the trial - raising awareness among the students and becoming counter-culture celebrities and spokesmen for a whole new generation of politically activated youngsters.  Then the men would return to Chicago to resume their roles in the trial.

The final twenty minutes or so of the movie - as we watch the government forces move in to disperse the protestors and the subsequent chaos that ensued - are riveting and eye-opening to say the least.  But the whole movie is engaging and informative and reminds us of just how fragile a thing the right to free speech and assembly can be even in a country that prides itself on that being the very foundation upon which its democracy is built.",1289865600,,3016,4.9603174603174605
