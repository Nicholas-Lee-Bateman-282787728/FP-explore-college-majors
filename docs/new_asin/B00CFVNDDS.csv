5721823,4,B00CFVNDDS,"This is a great workout! I only gave it 4 stars because the number of moves are not the same for each side of the body, Ive been doing this video for a couple years and have made some adjustments to even it out. I use this along with other videos, weight work, running, and bands.",1411603200,5,280,4.017857142857143
5721824,4,B00CFVNDDS,"Don't let the pretty, sweet girliness get to you...There is an arm workout in this workout that is really worth its weight in gold 7-8 minutes, no weights and one week to see results. The rest of the video is a lot the same. She is specific. If you want bulk T.A. is not the video for you but working slender is perfect. She is AMAZING!",1405296000,6,336,4.106060606060606
5721825,5,B00CFVNDDS,Her workout is one of the best workouts I have done and I HIGHLY recommend for anyone looking to get into shape,1401840000,,111,4.090909090909091
5721826,5,B00CFVNDDS,Her workout was fresh and new.  I was never bored and was challenged in each routine.  Some I was not able to finish because my muscles were so fatigued. I really love her theory and practice and look forward to doing more routine.,1397606400,2,231,4.348837209302325
5721827,5,B00CFVNDDS,"This is a great set, excellent for people with space limitations (apartment living).  It is really nice and convenient that it comes with the mat.  Being able to stay at home during bad weather ect. really does wonders, you can never really have an excuse not to work out.",1376265600,4,272,4.530612244897959
5721828,1,B00CFVNDDS,"how is this even for sale on Amazon?? She is stiff, inflexible, and gyrates and moves her shoulders like a stripper. It's like amateur hour watching this video. I'm mortified I accidentally bought this rather than rented it so I could see what a hot mess this was. Some workout. I felt like I was watching a 12 year-old stripper wannabee try to workout.",1466380800,,353,4.53125
5721829,5,B00CFVNDDS,great video for toning.,1462924800,,23,5.0
5721830,5,B00CFVNDDS,I have many Tracy Amderson workout DVDs and this is still one of my favorites. The workout is excellent and challenging.,1462665600,,120,4.761904761904762
5721831,5,B00CFVNDDS,"this is one of the best workouts, ever.  it sculpts and tones my body.  I have problems with my midsection and butt.  But what lady doesnt?  the exercises are simple and easy but very very effective.  I can achieve the body i want in less time than hitting the ballet barre/spinning combination.  And love that i can do this on my laptop while watching tv or listening to an audiobook.  LOVE.  My dream is to go to one of her classes in the hamptons or NYC.  Until then, i will just do the video.",1461024000,,496,4.191489361702128
5721832,3,B00CFVNDDS,Pretty awesome workout .. You have to pay attention the first couple of times because she doesn't always say what she's doing .. But if you keep up with it you'll have a great body!,1459209600,,181,4.2
5721833,5,B00CFVNDDS,"I am biased, because I LOVE everything Tracy does.  I own her Metamorphosis DVDs, but there is no digital option at the moment (besides free on youtube where I cannot see her hand or foot angles + all those commercials).  So, I bought all the Digital DVDs that Amazon has to offer for Tracy.  This one is my favorite, because it is relaxing and shows a different side of Tracy than her normally intense, high-energy workouts.",1451347200,,425,4.565789473684211
5721834,5,B00CFVNDDS,"I think Tracy Anderson's workouts are AMAZING. I am a pilates/yoga kind of girl, but I was looking for something a little stronger. I love the movements that she has designed--she goes after the small muscles along with the big ones (like pilates), but the moves are fluid and interesting, making them a challenge (like yoga). But oh-my-gosh, so much harder!  I CANNOT stress this enough--START WITH THE BEGINNER'S VIDEO. These workouts do the instructing for the moves in the starter videos, and are designed to progress in sequence.

I jog three days a week, and alternate days with a 30 minute beginner's mat workout (on work mornings) or this 60 minute one on Saturday and/or Sunday. I have not tried her cardio sessions, but I'm sure they are very pretty. Her dance training comes through in everything she does.

I must also say to the reviewer that says Tracy is ""into herself"": I don't know what that hate comes from...I think she is very likable, and I prefer a quiet, relaxing instructor. Again, I do think pilates/yoga/ballet enthusiests will like this type of exercise more than Tai-Bo/jillian michaels fans will.",1445126400,,1125,4.87958115183246
5721835,5,B00CFVNDDS,"This is the first Tracy Anderson workout I've ever done and I could immediately see why people are unhappy with her.  She's an AWFUL teacher - she does different reps on each side and does them out of order and kind of just stops talking or teaching halfway through.  As a former dancer, I was surprised that even I was struggling a bit to follow her during the standing abs section.  However, I've never done any workout in my entire life that changed my body as much as this one.  I literally have stopped doing any cardio (except for her dance aerobics every now and then) and my body has never looked better.  If you want flat abs and teeny arms but nothing overly muscular, this is the video for you.  To fit it in my schedule, I watch it on my ipad on mute while catching up on my tv shows.",1439424000,,796,4.203947368421052
5721836,5,B00CFVNDDS,Love it,1436745600,,7,3.0
5721837,5,B00CFVNDDS,She is amazing and if you stick with it you will see the results you want!!!!,1436400000,,77,3.875
5721838,3,B00CFVNDDS,"I made it 10 minutes and gave up because there isn't nearly enough narration for a first-time viewer to follow along. After a few viewings, yes, I'm sure I'd ""get"" it but as a first time viewer, I kept constantly breaking form during the warmup to double-check if I was doing it correctly. Often, I would find that Tracy had moved on but I had missed the cue.

Another issue is the background music. It's among the best of any workout vid I've reviewed but it's a tad too loud in relation to the narration.

For someone willing to take the time to learn the routine, this workout will be amazing. Even though I stayed with it only a few minutes I could already feel my muscles responding. I can also see that the diminished narration does serve a purpose--it doesn't bore you with the minutia of a routine you know by heart.

For the right person, this can be a great workout but having to learn the routine first is a deal breaker for me. :-(",1432512000,3,943,4.31638418079096
5721839,5,B00CFVNDDS,O.K. despite the fact that I gave this five starts it is not a perfect dvd by far.  Tracy is famous for not doing same number of repetitions on each side and I am not so sure about the standing abs other than it makes a nice cool down.  For me the arms program is worth the price of the whole dvd and I would go so far as to say it is my favorite arm routine.  Is the routine fun to do  - - only if you like your arms to feel like they are on fire!  But if you stick with it the arms section really does help with toning up the arms without bulking them up.  Tracy says not to use more than three pounds but I have gone little heavier when it was getting to easy and I have work weighted gloves on the first part.  I am over 50 and post menopausal so  my arms are really hard part to work out and this does the trick.  I also like the standing legs too.,1428278400,,853,3.7206703910614527
5721840,4,B00CFVNDDS,"This workout is a burner. After 2 weeks, I see results in my abs, arms, and thighs. Amazon instant video makes this workout perfect for travel!",1426118400,,143,4.538461538461538
5721841,5,B00CFVNDDS,This is a great workout.  Motivational.  I like the music and pace.  Highly recommend.,1421539200,,86,5.0
5721842,3,B00CFVNDDS,Good workout. She does exhaust your muscles for a very good burn throughout the video. My only complaint is the weird standing ab sequence where she sort of pops and locks into these ab rotations without explanation or sequence indication.,1420588800,,239,5.0
5721843,5,B00CFVNDDS,"This DVD definitely made me aware I still had muscles.... I thought I was going to die, especially during the arm exercises but have loved the challenge!!!",1416700800,2,155,4.777777777777778
5721844,5,B00CFVNDDS,This is one of my favorite workout videos to do when I don't make it to the gym or pilates. Tracy's method is really effective.  You will see and more importantly feel a difference in your body.,1415750400,,194,4.243243243243243
5721845,2,B00CFVNDDS,"Hard to follow .. she doesn't lead well. the workout is dancer based and is pleasant. I would suggest you watch it all the way through before doing since  she doesn't cue you as to changes , nice music",1413763200,,201,4.153846153846154
5721846,4,B00CFVNDDS,"Really enjoyed the standing abs and arm sequences. This is a nice change from mat workouts I am used to. Yes, she's a little hard to follow sometimes, but I was fatigued at the end of the workout, which is the most important thing to me.",1412899200,,237,4.173913043478261
5721847,1,B00CFVNDDS,Terrible workout with no instruction! Save you money and do some leg lifts on a chair!,1412640000,2,86,4.4375
8581436,5,B00CFVNDDS,Tracy's style is a bit wierd at first.. But boy does it work!!!,1529884800,,63,3.923076923076923
8581437,2,B00CFVNDDS,"Apparently my review isn't much different than others, the arm routines are killer good, but Tracy as an instructor; (lead-ins, form before (flex your feet when doing the frogs) and counting, not so good. The dance video that came out with this one is even worse for instruction/workout continuity. I bought this DVD when it first came out, I paid the original $30. I have a vast library and rotate this in for a change, after I review my notes on the flaws.",1524096000,,458,4.530120481927711
8581438,5,B00CFVNDDS,This is still one that I go back to for a great musculoskeletal workout on a low calorie day when I don't want to run on the treadmill or sweat too much. The arm section only is GOLD! Perfect for traveling as long as you remember to pack your 3-lb weights or they have some in your hotel.,1517097600,,288,3.9827586206896552
8581439,5,B00CFVNDDS,Great workout-easy to follow.,1503619200,,29,6.5
8581440,5,B00CFVNDDS,"Tracy is great. I own three of her workouts videos. I like her quirky dancer like movements, as well as the music she chooses. I also really like that, by the end of the workout, I've worked out (what feels like) every angle of my body. I felt and saw improvement in my arms within a couple of weeks!",1503014400,,300,4.101694915254237
8581441,5,B00CFVNDDS,Great workout DVD and I love the thick mat!,1481587200,,43,3.888888888888889
8581442,4,B00CFVNDDS,Great creative and effective sculpt workout. Only 4 stars because the sides aren't even and directions are limited.,1474070400,,115,5.444444444444445
8581443,4,B00CFVNDDS,"This is my favorite Tracy Anderson workout. That said, I agree with nearly everything other reviewers have written, both the positive and (much of) the negative. While her method has changed the shape of my body for the better after years and years of other workouts, her flaws as a teacher really keep this from being the five star workout it could be. Yes, she plunges into different exercises without demonstrating the form. Yes, she fails to cue changes many times. And yes, the number of moves for each side of the body are sometimes different, and it's up to the viewer to figure out how to even them out after numerous viewings. In fact, had I not done ""The Method: for Beginners"" workout first, I doubt I would have been able to follow this the first time through. ""The Method: for Beginners"" is focused on teaching and on proper form; if you've already purchased the ""Mat Workout"" and are considering giving/throwing it away, I suggest you try to rent (or view online) ""The Method: for Beginners"" first.

So why the positive review? Bottom line, I love the way I look and feel after doing this video. The ""Mat Workout"" is a long, thorough workout, but since it's not aerobic, I can do it even later in the day, or if I'm tired or sore. As others have written, the arm workout portion alone is worth the price. I tend to pack on muscle quickly, and because of this and other Tracy workouts, I now have the lean, toned, tight arms I always wanted. Same for thighs; though mine are still not lean (lol), I'm much happier with the shape than what I got from doing more intense aerobic weightlifting programs - even as I continuing to work out with those in rotation with this one. One of my top three all-time home workouts, despite the flaws.",1473033600,14,1748,4.514195583596215
8581444,5,B00CFVNDDS,"TA method just works. Yes it took some getting over myself about the many reps and the lack of cuing, but the results are fast!  I use the mat workout at least 3 times per week.",1472342400,,177,3.9166666666666665
8581445,5,B00CFVNDDS,"After a lot of boot camp, sports coach led style of workouts, it's nice to have a workout with calm, steady directives. The workout has ballet, other dance, Pilates, and yoga elements set to great music that lets you feel the rhythm rather than getting stuck on the nuances of exact number of repetitions. It's a looser workout framework in that there's no emphasis on counts (you just follow her), and it's very feminine and  sensual. I'm sore a different way. For those looking for a military style directive, this isn't it and that's why she's so great. My body gets worked in the right places: hips, arms, thighs without having to hear all the loud pep talk so common in other style workouts. I still do boot camp style workouts, but I mix it with Tracy's dance and mat method. It's a great balance.",1468540800,2,803,4.537931034482758
