7849981,5,630352236X,"In the opening episode of the third season, Divy Lovejoy find in all sorts of complications.  When we last saw him, he had left everyone square money-wise, and was off for a much needed vacation.  Now he is broke.  All the money gone for various reasons and he is house-sitting for a sleaze Freddie the Phone.
He quickly gathers Lady Jane, Tink and Eric back and is ready for action.
Only Lady Jane has company, a old school chum, Victoria (Joanna Lumley).  She is a widow of a South American political.  Jane get him involved in brokering a deal for an ancient Inca gold ring for Victoria.  For safe keeping, Eric convinces Lovejoy to use a new safe that works on eye identification instead of combination.  Lovejoy sets up the deal, but find out there are some very nasty people after Victoria.  This becomes apparent when Lady Jane is accidentally kidnapped instead of Victoria.
Lovejoy cannot get the safe to open, to get the ring as ransom for Lady Jane, so they pop over to Eaton to get the top safe cracker out of school.  It's up to Lovejoy, knight-errant, to safe both damsels in distress.
First of four episodes to feature a romance between Lovejoy and Victoria.
Great fun.  Just wish BBC would get off their duff and release lovejoy on DVD!",1074470400,2,1251,4.569506726457399
