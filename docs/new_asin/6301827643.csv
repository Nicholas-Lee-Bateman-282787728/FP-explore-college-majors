373893,3,6301827643,"Betsy's Wedding (1990)  is a family-entertainment movie, that
comes close to a TV-style picture, from suger-coating each and
every scene, from start to finish, a bit much, over 90 minutes or
more. This is picture to see, mainly for completists in the genre
of mob pictures who particularly enjoy comedy combined in it,
seeing that Joe Pesci reaches deep inside himself to deliver a
credible, no-nonsense character. also known as the straight-man,
juxtaposed with Alan Alda, who plays the more comedic, mature,
responsible, dreamer and friendly kind of guy, incredibly. For
those who pull a blank seeing  Anthony LaPaglia, yes, the actor
is the brother of Jonathan LaPaglia who delivered a wonderful
performance in ""UNDER HELLGATE BRIDGE "" some years ago.

The strong points of this picture, is the romantic comedy aspect,
as its lays out what parents and youths have to deal with, when
different cultures combine in a marriage, involving in the
process, economic, and class differences, as well.  A nice,
wholesome film, most would suggest. For fans of Joe Pesci, just
seeing the actor being a straight, no-nonsense dude is worth the
price of admission, as compared to other works that are slapstick
style, of course.",1324252800,,1217,5.100502512562814

373906,5,6301827643,"This got here quickly and in great condition. It is kind of slow, but funny and romantic. Lots of big names in this movie and creative clothing by Molly Ringwalds character.",1281657600,,173,4.612903225806452
373907,3,6301827643,"Alan Alda, best known for playing Captain Benjamin Franklin Pierce in 251 episodes of ""M*A*S*H"" from 1972 through 1983, wrote, directed, and starred in Betsy's Wedding, based on his own experience when his daughter got married. Poor girl, if her wedding was anything like Betsy's. The movie, like the wedding in the movie, and one assumes, Alda's daughter's wedding, was all about Alda. Alda, like Captain Benjamin Franklin Pierce, is a likeable guy--but sometimes a movie doesn't call for a likeable guy. Sometimes an actor has to let go of wanting the audience to like him. And when the actor is also the director, that can be a problem. I have seen Mr. Alda in Woody Allen movies where he is a real jerk. But under his own direction, he succumbs totally to the temptation to make the audience like him at all costs. He does show some evidence of understanding human nature, some self awareness, and one of the things I like about the film is it does show how for instance the husband and wife in a married couple can see things differently--but this is mostly shown with his father, who is deceased but appears as a ghost played by Joey Bishop, and his mother, who have very different opinions of his cooking.

Alda's character, Eddie Hopper, is a happy-go-lucky guy, not so good in business, but at least a semi-successful contractor. You'd think that he'd be good at something, but he is shown to be pretty incompetent, not even able to climb a ladder without courting near catastrophe. This doesn't really seem like the correct personality type for a contractor. I refer you to Cash in As I Lay Dying by William Faulkner. That novel, written from multiple perspectives, in the section told from Cash's point-of-view showed a much truer representation of the carpenter personality.

Though Betsy's Wedding walks down the same aisle as Rachel Getting Married, it is a marriage made elsewhere than heaven. Still, as a light hearted farce Betsy's Wedding is more than adequate. I had a few quibbles with Alda's Eddie Hopper; but Madeline Kahn as his wife Lola is always engaging. Joe Pesci as his more successful but lacking a moral compass brother-in-law was suitably annoying. Anthony LaPaglia as Stevie Dee, a mobster's nephew that Oscar gets Eddie tangled up with, was something to see. Ally Sheedy, as Betsy's sister, a police officer who always gets her man, except off duty, where she never gets her man, was cute. Molly Ringwald as Betsy Hopper, a fashion student with a flair for the outrageous, was lovely as usual.

Molly Ringwald and Ally Sheedy were both considered to be part of the Brat Pack. Funny that in Betsy's Wedding they are joined by Joey Bishop, who was in Frank Sinatra's Rat Pack. Molly will always be known as the Muse of John Hughes, and associated with The Breakfast Club and Pretty in Pink. At the time, the critics were rather harsh about John Hughes and his Brat Packers, but now that Hughes has passed on, The Breakfast Club is now seen as a classic 80's film that defines the era and spoke for its generation.

The bottom line is that I rate it 3 stars, though personally I enjoyed Betsy's Wedding, mainly for Molly and Ally, but Anthony LaPaglia was the real surprise. I winced when I first saw him, but his whacky performance won me over. I see him now in Cold Case, a crime show, but I happened to catch a re-run of Frazier the other night where I saw him as Simon Moon, Daphney's least favorite brother. In Betsy's Wedding he falls hard for Connie, Betsy's sister, played by Sheedy. You will have to see him to believe it, but he really wins over the audience, just like he does with Connie and her father.

Stevie Dee: I could be whatever you need. I could do anything for the woman I love. I believe in saying what you feel. You are the blood in my veins, I would walk through fire for you. I will always be available, I belong to you.

Alan Alda and Madeline Kahn were outstanding as Betsy's parents.",1110499200,6,362,4.73015873015873
373911,4,6301827643,"Alan Alda, Ally Sheedy, Molly Ringwold, Joe Pesci and the late Madeline Kahn star in this funny wedding movie.  Everyone knows Alda as a funny man who has been turning in some more serious performances latley but who knew Joe Pesci could be funny?  Naturally, there is trouble over putting Eddie Hopper's (Alda) daughter's (Ringwold) wedding together.

Hopper's family is comfortable but not rich but the other family is rolling in dough and wants to take over the wedding.  Oscar Henner (Pesci) is in construction but has ties to organized crime. Oscar is having an affair with his secretary but his wife (Catherine O'Hara) knows all about it.  Hopper's other daughter (Sheedy) falls for the nephew (Anthony LaPaglia as Stevie Dee) of Oscar's not so honest associate (Burt Young).  She's a cop and he's connected to the mob.  Eddie borrows money from Oscar to pay for the wedding but Oscar charges him interest.  Oscar involves Eddie in a deal with his associate but to get out of the deal might get him killed.  Oscar offers to find a tent for the wedding but cuts a deal with someone and gets the wrong kind of tent.  By the way, Oscar rents an apartment to the newlyweds in one of his tenament slum buildings!

The wedding turns out to be a disaster of course.  The tent leaks and then a hole is opened in the roof of the tent and the rain pours in.  The food gets ruined and Eddie has to send out for pizza and everyone has to take their shoes off because the tent gets flooded.

By the way, look for Samuel Jackson (unknown then) in a very small bit part in the taxi depot scene.

It's lots of fun.  No nudity, sex, violence.  There is some foul language.  I suggest a viewing of of at least 13.",1101254400,15,1701,4.449838187702265
373912,5,6301827643,"In Alan Alda's ""Betsy's Wedding"",he is Eddie Hopper,a construction foreman and architect. His daughter Betsy(Molly Ringwald) and her boyfriend Jake Lovell(Dylan Walsh) announce their engagement at a family gathering. Betsy's sister Connie(Ally Sheedy) is happy herself but jealously upset because she can't find herself a man. The late Madeline Kahn is Lola,Eddie's wife. At the gathering Lola's sister Gloria Henner(Catherine O'Hara) tells her she plans to get even with her husband Oscar(Oscar winner Joe Pesci) for all his inept schemes. Gloria says ""Someday,when I have my nice little nestegg,I can take a walk and he can go f--- himself."" Anthony LaPaglia is Stevie Dee,a guy who would later in the film become Connie's boyfriend. Stevie Dee's uncle Georgie(Burt Young) is a business associate of Oscar's. There's once scene where when Betsy and Jake meet with the man performing their wedding ceremony,the Dixie Cups' CHAPEL OF LOVE is played. They want to be pronounced ""husband and wife"" instead of ""man and wife"" and they have ""obey"" omitted from ""love,honor and obey"". The late Julie Bovasso plays Rose,Eddie's mother and Joey Bishop is Eddie's deceased father. The father,as a ghost,is seen and heard only by Eddie. The wedding was somewhat disasterous. It took place in a rented tent on a rainy evening. The tent was made of cheap,not-too-strong materials so a hole in the roof where the rain fell into increased to the point where it caved in. After a heated argument between Gloria and Oscar at the reception also in the tent,Gloria pulls a loose thread causing the growing hole and the dowse of fallen rain. So Connie and Stevie Dee can be together more often,Stevie Dee applies to the police academy,since Connie's a cop. Unbelievably,the wedding dinner was pizza! By the way,Oscar planned to divorce Gloria and become romantically involved with his secretary,who also attended Betsy's and Jake's wedding. That was one of the things that led to the argument. The wedding ceremony was performed in the Jewish style. Jake stepped on a wine glass wrapped in a cloth napkin. This film was Alan Alda's most successful and not a minor hit like ""A New Life"",another one of his personally scripted films.",1072742400,2,2212,5.113259668508287
