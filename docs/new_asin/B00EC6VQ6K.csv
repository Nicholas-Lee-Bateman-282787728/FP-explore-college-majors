8603707,2,B00EC6VQ6K,"Written, directed, and starring Melanie Denholme, as she plays Anna an actress who auditions for a job in an indie grind house. She is given written instructions and filmed by a mute camera man. Her face is the only one we see, other than a man in a rubber mask. She is tasked to perform various scenes without any real direction. As time goes on the scenes become unusual involving sex and nudity.

The film is 78 minutes, although it seems longer. There is no scene jumping. The film goes directly into the extras which includes Melanie Denholme explaining what you just watched and then film trailers. If watching Melanie Denholme simulate sex, being raped, showering, and in various stage of undress for the entire film, this is the only film for you. However, if you not Melanie Denholme or Theo Aquinas, this may not be the film for you.

Original. Not great.

8603708,1,B00EC6VQ6K,"For me personally, Anna: Scream Queen Killer is far more arthouse than a film that claims to have a plot can handle. I have seen enough of Denholmes work to realize that this is her niche area of genre filmmaking, often the films prove very expressionistic and evoking, however with this film it just didn't work for me. The voyeurism is a cool notion and aims at a particular fetishized market in indie horror. The thing that makes Anna: SQK fall flat is the complete drowning of plot and character building which gets lost in a psychotic flux of surrealistic and almost randomized series of theatrics from the view of the voyeur. Often less is more, except when it comes to plot, story continuity. There should have been more detail and consideration in conveying the story and actual fluid dialog that brings the viewer along on this journey.

Anna: Scream Queen Killer isn't really a film that I would suggest to a horror fan who wants to see a movie, it is more a film that I would suggest for fetish fans of erotica artfilms, or fans of Melanie Denhome. That is really a stretch to say considering there are other works featuring Denhome that offer the same atmosphere and themes, but with much more entertainment value. I just didn't get whatever it was Anna: SQK was shooting for, nor did I connect with the film desired intent. I don't think this film was executed properly and feel that maybe the creativity overcame the the directors which resulted in total chaos and confusion. This was a really bad movie and not the kind that is so bad it is good-it is just bad!",1432512000,,1576,4.568904593639576

Stars & Written by:  Melanie Denholme.anna

So,Seen ONE HOUR TO DIE and others of Philip Gardiners  Dark Watchers and Dead Walkers

You see a style that in ANNA is attributed to The Aquinas ?

Okay,Assuming Phillip had nothing to do with ANNA ( Wink,wink),Melanie has captured his famous style of film-making and built upon.

This actress,A Scream Queen, by all means,Answers an ad for an actress audition like no other.

She has a sheet of one sentence scenarios to be performed in front of a one man camera crew ( Hi ! Philip) .

Okay,Now the good stuff is : The Alien Attack while driving her auto scene is amazing and it was filmed while Melanie is obviously driving In Traffic and does things with one hand that are amazing and wonderful to view.

The Psychiatrist session about The Alien Attack Wow,Melanie recreates the above scene for an imaginary Dr. of the mind and performs on him so to fill his hour !

The ending of ANNA was so cool and unexpected.[...]",1388361600,,1002,4.573033707865169
