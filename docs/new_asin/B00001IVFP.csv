1243426,5,B00001IVFP,"I've lived 5 years in NY now and never really knew alot of the things that this documentary told me.  Its funny how we just walk by places and never realizing the history behind them.  Even though I had a limited history of  the city before, this documentary gave me alot more to get my interest  going.  Its the best NY presentation that ive ever seen.  not that ive seen  alot of them, but the way that is put together makes it very entertaining  to watch, another great PBS project. When this series came on in ch 13 here  in ny(in a span of 3 days i think), everybody that i spoke to was watching  it and everybody said it was a great show.",945302400,2,644,4.120967741935484
1243427,5,B00001IVFP,"This has to be one of the most in depth studies of the history of the City of New York.  Using art, literature and music and an extraordinary collection of archival photographs, this video captures the essence, the  soul and the heart of the people that made this city so  extraordinary.
From the earliest Dutch settlers (remember your grade  school history lessons?) and their dealings with the Native Americans, to  the British arrival, the American Revolution, the early immigrants, the  politics of the Civil War era, the late nineteenth century immigration from  Eastern and Southern Europe and into the current and final century of the  millennium, this video is one that absolutely captivates its audience.  If  you thought you knew New York, take a closer look. My only regret is that  many of the people I knew who were connected to New York's past are gone.  Here, however, are their extraordinary stories; stories that must be shared  with current and future generations.  I can't wait to see it again with my  children and someday with their children.",945216000,4,1063,4.926553672316384

1243430,5,B00001IVFP,"This documentary is the finest historical film I have yet seen. It starts with Henry Hudson discovering one of the greatest natural ports in the world, and takes us through the development of the little village of New Amsterdam thru the rise of New York City as the worlds commercial and cultural capitol.

The epic journey of African slaves and immigrants from around the world, striving to better their lives in the worlds greatest melting pot is one of mankinds great stories. The musical score by Brian Keane is perfect, while the writing and editing are practically flawless. If you enjoy American history and historical epics, this is as good as they get.",1266883200,,661,4.849557522123894

1243432,4,B00001IVFP,"We truly enjoyed this series. Being a life long resident of New York it had particular appeal as we came to understand the challenges and wonderful history of this great city. It would also appeal to any viewer given the international importance of our city. To understand New York is to understand a major part of the history of the USA. It was also easy to watch a little at a time given the way it is set up in segments. I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys documentaries, USA and state history. I'd love if my teenage children would sit down and watch it but I think it will appeal to a little older an audience. My husband and I have already seen all segments. We enjoyed it so much that this purchase was a gift for our parents. Enjoy!",1229731200,,755,4.286713286713287
1243433,5,B00001IVFP,"Gives a detailed and brilliant look at the shaping, and reshaping, of what would become the most identifiable city the world has ever seen.  From its roots as a dutch trading post, to the construction of Central Park and the Brooklyn Bridge, to the ghettos and tenements of immigrants, through the growth and destruction ushered in by Robert Moses, the financial ruin of the 1970's and the fall of the two towers that mightily stood in its financial district, this documentary covers it all.

An absolutely beautiful project that will give you a deeper appreciation for the most ecclectic city on the face of this earth.",1203120000,,620,4.839622641509434
1243434,5,B00001IVFP,"After having only seen one episode on PBS, I knew I had to get this.  I first purchased the 7-disc set and then when they came out with the 8-disc one after 9/11, I gave the old one to my parents and got this.

This is not just about New York City, it is also the story of America.  I pull this documentary out every once in a while and either watch just one episode or the whole thing.  Yes, it is THAT good.

Watching this, you will feel virtually every emotion.  Happiness, sadness and absolute anger (especially when it comes to the Triangle fire).  David Ogden Stiers is perfectly suited for the narration and the soundtrack is a wonderful treat as well.  Every time I watch this, I leave my heart in New York.",1200096000,,715,4.2444444444444445

New-York ( for me, New-Amsterdam ) is a great city and deserve this documentairy.

1243438,5,B00001IVFP,Ric Burns excelled himself in this fantastic series.  He was able to capture the real and gritty history of this great city in such detail. The photography and images was exceptionally graphic and laid out out in perfect historical timing.  The immigration of so many people from so many foriegn lands living and working together in such tough economic conditions was especially profound. I so enjoyed this series.,1174780800,,414,5.073529411764706
1243439,5,B00001IVFP,This is a really interesting documentary full of information about the history of New York.  It starts in the 1600's when NY was a colony of the Dutch and continues to the present day. I found it endlessly fascinating.  My husband & I watched all 8 DVD's in the 1st 4 days we had the set.  We've watched it again several times.  You always catch something new.  Very good!,1173312000,,372,4.333333333333333
1243440,5,B00001IVFP,"Okay, I'm biased as I already thought that New York City was the greatest city in the world, but this series just emphasized it!  Unlike another reviewer, I thought the first two discs were the most accesible and interesting... and it made Alexander Hamilton my new hero!  I bought this when it was only a seven-disc set and had to order the World Trade Center disc as a seperate entity, and I'm glad it's being sold with the rest of the set.  Ric Burns did a fantastic job!  A must-own for all New Yorkers or lovers of the Big Apple!",1166486400,,534,4.31
1243441,3,B00001IVFP,"A sweeping PBS special, this 7 DVD Box set history of New York promises to be fascinating. However, the first two 2-hour sessions don't live up to what PBS is capable of doing. For example, the New York City grid plan of 1811 is called ""the greatest plan mankind had ever conceived of in all time,"" and 5 minutes later the commentator says that it was ""nothing compared to the Erie canal."" The statue of an angel in central park is called ""the greatest statue ever erected in all time."" OK, they are definitely getting ahead of themselves here. I understand the need to present a postive, moving documentary that gives a sense of the momentousness of the events that were being described, but a good documentary should also take itself seriously enough to not to use overly decadent hyperbole.

One bright episode in part 2 is a description of the Dead Rabbits vs. Bowery boys gang wars in the lower Manhattan, which made be think that this documentary might have been an inspiration for the movie Gangs of New York. I also appreciated their explanation for the name New York Knicks and the Knickerbockkers which I never got until watching this. Finally the description of Walt Whitman's career was interesting.

Beginning with episode 3-4, this set begins to really get better (or maybe my expectations just went down a bit, and that allowed me to enjoy it more), and we slowly get some of the more detailed look that I was expecting to get out of this PBS special. I was interested to find out that the population of Manhattan actually peaked in 1910, for example, and the descriptions of the tests coming through Ellis Island were harrowing. Plus, some of the achievements at the turn of the 20th century were actually momentous enough to live up to some of the hyperbole. It almost makes one wish to live in that time, at least temporarily, because in today's world that kind of wonderment just isn't possible. It's hard to imagine when progress was standing on top of the Brooklyn Bridge for the first time, or coming to New York from an agricultural society, and not the next generation of video game consoles or some new web site whatever.

There are a lot of liberal themes certainly when you look at the progressive movement and the New Deal coming out of New York, and how that eventually spread to the rest of the country. But they presented liberalism as a complement to the capitalism that had preceded it in New York and not as an opposing force- the two parts were presented as forming parts of the whole.

I thought they were a bit unfair to Robert Moses, I feel sorry for him that at the end of his life when he had no energy left, Robert Caro wrote a massive book basically attacking him. Robert Caro is a magnificent, meticulous writer and one of the greatest biographers, so any individual who falls under his devastating hand is going to be rather defenseless. But in reality, the forces of the automobile overtaking the city were not the fault of Robert Moses, they were inevitable. Moses rode the crest of the wave until he was no longer useful to society, then it cast him off like a useless object, just like in the poem where the writer talks about New York City favoring a few and riding them up on a bubble before bursting them and laughing cruelly.

I was impressed at the variety of people and expert brought to this documentary. Through the sentimental themes and repeating ideas these people and their commentaries added some more complex and interesting themes and perspectives.",1164844800,10,3511,4.638263665594855
1243442,5,B00001IVFP,"If your a New Yorker or if you love New York City this is the documentary you want to buy.
The Burns brothers did it again.  My only complait is the focus is a little to focused on Manhattan.

I don't really know what is LIBERAL or CONSERVATIVE about this 8 part documentary. ""Maybe a rewriting of the history of the Bill Buckley race for mayor could have made a balanced the presentation?"" I don't know!!",1153267200,2,405,4.315789473684211
1243443,5,B00001IVFP,"As a lot of you know, I am very into the documentaries of the Burns boys.  And this documentary of my homeland does it (New York that is) justice.  It teaches (present tense as I have not watched it all the way through as yet) things I never knew about my birthcity.  And a wonderful narration by David Ogden Stiers (Charles Emerson Winchester III of Mash fame) helps tell this great story even more.  For the record, this review is being written in the section for the reissued copy which includes episode 8 which Ken and Ric went back to shoot in memory of everyone we lost on September 11th.  If you already have the 7 disc copy, you can still buy episode 8 separately here at Amazon, but if you're just buying it for the first time, get this version of the set (the person who recommended the separate copy of 8 with this set, must have mistaken this for the other copy now only being offered by ""marketplace clients"").  At any rate whether you are a native New Yorker or not, add this to your Ken Burns Collection of The Civil War, Baseball, The West, etc.  It tells a very accurate history of one of the most popular cities in this country, and of which I am proud to call myself a native.",1150588800,9,1195,4.2844444444444445
1243444,5,B00001IVFP,"There are few cities like New York City and there are few documentaries like this one. Most documentaries are centred on an event/a building/a person, but here the city and its development are at the centre. While this might be very difficult to do and stay focused, it is what makes this documentary so special. Burns too the time it needs to tell the story of NYC, it took him 7 DVDs and one special about the WTC and how it fitted more or less perfect into NYC, in total about 17,5 hours. So if you are really interested in NYC and want to know its history and which development took place why, this DVD-Set is what you are looking for. The only feature I'm missing is that there are no optional subtitles, which might be helpfull for for a number of people.",1125964800,14,761,4.328671328671328
1243445,5,B00001IVFP,"When I first sat down and watched this tremendous film on DVD, I was stunned at the magnitude of information it contains.  I learned so much about New York's origins, I felt ashamed I knew so little about the world's greatest city.

As I got deeper into the film, I realised just how riveted I was at the musical score.  What a tremendous soundtrack!  The drawings, photos, camera sweeps and interviews come alive in a way that's hard to describe, when combined with the music.

I was taken aback by the weight of emotion (mostly sadness) that the documentary was able to well up inside of me; there were so many incidents I was unaware of in the city's history that are just heart-breaking.  I learned so much about the city's lowlights but there are also a great deal of highlights too.  I was extremely proud of the Statue of Liberty segment - tears literally filled my eyes as the inscription on the statue was read.  That's the kind of emotion the film brings.

These are stories I'm not likely to ever forget.  Because of the way Ric Burns and his team put them on film in a way that's more than watchable; it's simply stupendous.

This is the finest film I have ever witnessed.",1124582400,25,1184,4.46046511627907
1243446,5,B00001IVFP,"Let me start by saying that I was born and raised in New York City, and like anyone else from there, this film becomes a very personal and emotional experience.

  This is a film that has changed the way I live my life and the way I think about the city that I am from. I moved away from New York when I was 23 and am now 47. After seeing this film, I realize that nothing made my life better than leaving New York city 25 years ago. The history of New York City is a continuous cycle of absolute greed and excess. It is also apparent that virtually every major building project in the city's history was done for two reasons: money and ego. As Ric Burns points out so well, the city has a self-centered and arrogant attitude about itself that is the biggest reason why it is hated by so many people. The music score of this film is epochal, as it evokes the tragedy and sadness that has been produced over and over in the history of New York City. However, I am left with the impression that the millions of people who continue to live there either don't realize how much their life is diminished, or don't care. The last episode of this film about the World Trade Center is the most intense three hours of film I have ever seen. Like everyone else, I was completely changed by the events of September 11th. But after seeing this film, I come away believing that New York City doesn't really learn from its mistakes. The people of this city live within an infrastructure that is constantly on the verge of collapse. The cost of virtually everything is higher than anywhere else in the United States. The ordeal of just getting to and from work and merely getting around is more stressful than most other aspects of life. The demise of the World Trade Center points out everything that was wrong about its very existence. It was built as the ultimate expression of excess, and unlike the Empire State Building became a symbol for the city's condescending opinion of the rest of the world.

  Not long ago, a blackout shut the city down. I lived through the blackouts of 1965 and 1977. The city obviously didn't learn much from the first two, and it now appears that they didn't learn much from the last one. The system that supplies electricity to the area is ancient and will one day collapse again. The same can be said for the subway system that manages to continue to function despite being held together by a structure that is almost a century old.

  All this contributes to why this film is so powerful. It is the story of a city that was created by people out of pure greed, and takes far more from its people than it ever gives back. The most amazing thing is that so many people still live there and continue to live under those conditions.",1119484800,15,2750,4.376470588235295
1243447,3,B00001IVFP,"As is typical of PBS documentaries, especially those done by a Burns, this one has a not so subtle leftish political agenda.  It's so predictable...portray the growth of government as progress, portray labor unions as champions of workers and forget about the notorious violence and corruption, mention ""the poor"" or ""African-Americans"" at least once every 30 seconds, go into detail about all the horrors whites perpetrated against blacks but never, ever portray blacks in a negative light. (Black-on-white rapes, muggings, and murders in New York City?  Never a problem at all!).  This is what political correctness demands and Burns dutifully delivers.

Historians are supposed to relate history the way it was to those who lived it, not impose present-day liberal values on it.  Unfortunately, revisionist presentism infects many parts of this documentary.  Burns focuses obsessively (for nearly an hour) on Robert Moses' transportation projects, demonizing him and his expressways over and over again with every pejorative he could think of.  This was really over the top and really unprofessional coming from a historian.  I don't necessarily disagree with his assessment of Moses, but I'd like to to hear opposing views and a more neutral narration so that I can make up my own mind for myself.

Building expressways through the city is destructive, according to this documentary, but graffiti ""artists"" who leave their mark on subways are making the city more beautiful, as one dissheveled interviewee, who appears over and over in the film, explained -- without being rebutted, of course. (Take that Rudy Giulliani!)

Burns spent so much time attacking Robert Moses that he was never even able to devote a minute of this marathon documentary to professional sports in New York.  Do you think maybe the Yankees...maybe Babe Ruth...have had just a bit of significance to New Yorkers over the years?  You wouldn't suspect it from watching this!

Despite these complaints, most of this production is actually well put together, interesting, and informative.  It's excessive, though.  There are way too many interviews with historians and commentators, who all seem to echo Burns' worldview anyway.  It runs a total of 14 hours (even longer with the new episode 8)!  Who has that kind of time?  Ric Burns should have done more editing and cut it in half to make it more accessible.

I would recommend this documentary series to people with a serious interest in New York and/or American history who are willing to devote the required time. I would only recommend it, however, to people who are experienced and sophisticated enough to recognize and disregard/challenge as necessary imbedded ideological biases. Students with a long attention span may enjoy this, but if they are not politically astute, they should be debriefed by an objective person as to the biases.",1113004800,33,2871,5.202173913043478
1243448,5,B00001IVFP,"Ric Burns' New York is the best documentary film to exist - period.

This insightful work uses incredible interviews, photos and perhaps best of all - a beautiful musical score - to provide everyone who views this the true flavor of The Big Apple.

Don't forget about Volume 8 that's available seperately - it's a MUST-HAVE to compliment this great set.  If there were a way to give this film 100 stars, I would do just that.",1107820800,12,425,4.4935064935064934
1243449,3,B00001IVFP,"There's a great 4-part series in this production.  Or eight one-hour episodes.  I viewed the series for the first time not on tv but on DVD, and come away with the sense that what may have been effective for the needs of separate airings on television does not translate as well to consecutively-viewed discs.  Burns has assembled a handsomely produced, well-researched set of biographies, commentary, and history with the participation of a wide range of writers, historians, and public figures.  He underscores interesting facets of the city's development.  Photographs and films provide glimpses of past eras to support the script.  A carefully thought-out storyline, though not exhaustive, lends a strong theme.

The pacing of the episodes is, however, extended.  The theme of individual episodes is overplayed so that the device of quotations slows the narrative as much as it advances it.  Vignettes are played out in excessive detail and repetitiously, so that the pace becomes glacial.  What is initially stirring and engaging becomes, through the editing style, anesthetic.  The narration tends toward overuse of superlatives. Each time the viewer hears that the upcoming historical event-- be it race relations, the grid pattern of streets, or the effects of the automobile-- will leave the city ""forever changed"" or subject to its ""greatest adjustment"" or reeling like ""never before,"" one feels deja vu.  This effect is unfortunately emphasized by the excessive use of the otherwise stately and lovely theme music.

I have a dislike of MTV-driven, ADD style editing that employs rapid pacing, quick cuts, and multiple screens.  New York's DVD release would have been strengthened, not by hyperactive editing room techniques, but by cropping the episodes to maintain a steady rhythm.  Some of the consultants would be better employed in background narration than talking head shots, the eye-catching qualities of Mike Wallace's pop-eyed, hand-spinning delivery notwithstanding.

This is clearly a loving portrait of the town, and it provides a viewer with a good lesson in history.  There is much of substance-- and much of bloat.  A condensed version could contain what is vital and excise what is redundant.",1106438400,12,2219,5.345821325648415
1243450,5,B00001IVFP,"This is an astounding series that not only puts New York, but the very heart of this nation into a fascinating perspective.  It's so well done... every minute detail, including songs and personal diaries, gives one a perspective that is extremely tender without being overly sentimental.  The talking heads are all appropriately inspired, profound and enthusiastic, and one can thoroughly appreciate the painstaking hours of research that went into this, despite that fact that it obviously was a labor of love!  This is one of those documentaries that will be as valuable a hundred years from now as it is today, which in a sense makes it priceless, but still...

I would give a hundred stars if allowed for the quality of the production but it's extremely maddening that the fourteen hours of material are spread out among seven discs for a whopping $140.00 list price.  The material could have easily fit on four discs, and with a little frugality, even both sides of two discs.  It's SUCH an important documentary for all to see, PBS should really have tried to make it more accessible to those who can't afford it.  The DVD packaging and price really gets just one star, but I don't want to detract viewers from at least renting this by giving it a lower rating.",1103500800,13,1267,4.757990867579909
1243451,5,B00001IVFP,"Granted, a 14 hour documentary is lot to watch. But I found this epic, comprehensive chronicle of New York to be so compelling that I'm heartily recommending it to everyone. Even die-hard New-Yorkers will learn a historical detail or two, and see how their lives in the city fall into wider historical, social, political and cultural contexts. Burns brings out the idea that New York has been a social laboratory for over 300 years, and so many issues -- from commercialism, rich vs poor, immigration, multiculturalism, density, transportation, urban renewal -- have been experienced by New Yorkers before the rest of the nation. As a result, New York has a rich history.

The city's story is told historically, through a mosaic of images, interviews, music, and narrative.  There are, however, multiple recurring themes as the city's history unfolds:

One theme is that New York is a unabashedly commercial city, and that brings with it both energy and rapid change.  Burns follows the economic changes of the city, starting with its start as a Dutch trading colony that gave NY it's distinctly commercial culture, to the economic leadership of Alexander Hamilton, to the economic boom resulting from the opening of the Erie Canal.  The story then moves on to the rise of NYC as a manufacturing center, to the ""Guilded Age"" of robber barrons, through the 1929 stock market crash & the depression, to the 1970's fiscal crisis, and on to the economic boom of the 1980's.

Another theme is the physical development of the city. The early vision for a grand city was first seen under Mayor DeWitt Clinton, who oversaw the audacious plan to create the ""grid"" of numbered streets across the entire island of Manhattan. Burns tells the story of the rise of the great buildings -- the Empire State Building, the Chrysler Building, the UN, and others -- which at the time were seen as soaring symbols of modern urban life & the hope for the future.  In contrast, we also see the fall of great buildings, such as the old Penn Station building, and witness the backlash of historic preservation as people try to hold on to the city's past.

The influence of the automobile on urban planning makes for a surprisingly fascinating story.  Robert Moses, a powerful city administrator who oversaw the creation of NYC's public works projects for 50 years, built many highways that made a suburban ""commuter-culture"" possible.  City residents rose up and stopped some of his later projects, however, since they leveled buildings and broke up long-standing communities of city residents for the sake of better traffic flow to the suburbs.

Burns also tracks the social & political development of the city.  For example, he shows how New York multiculturalism is the result of massive immigration over the past 200 years, from the massive influx of Irish & Italian immigrants passed through Ellis Island, mixing with others in Manhattan, such as blacks & Puerto Ricans.  There are interesting sections on politics as well, from the rise of Boss Tweed & the corrupt Tammany Hall ""political machine"" in the 1800's, to Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, who oversaw the creation of city-wide social programs (programs that, incidentally, FDR used as a partial blueprint for the New Deal).

Finally, Burns also shows New York as a cultural center.  He brings us through the Harlem Renaissance and jazz, through the ""Cosmopolis"" described in the works of F. Scott Fitzgerald, through Walt Whitman's poems describing busting street life in his ""Manhatta"" and many others.

Love it or loath it, New York has an important story to tell.  As a symbol, NY has been both a city of ambition, energy, opportunity and culture for some, but also a symbol of decadence & depravity for others. Regardless, the city has a long rich history, and in Burns' epic, compelling narrative brings through it all, with the touch of a master storyteller. I'm recommending it highly, and rate it 5 stars.",1102204800,8,3947,4.956060606060606

It isn't - you just had boring history teachers in high school, that taught history in a boring manner. If history was taught as the clash of great personalities and the range of choices they had, and it was explained why the person choose the path they did based on the limited resources they had to divide between all their goals and aspirations - people would recognize that alot of history is facinating. As you learn the history of the city of New York you will also learn a great deal about American history - because they are so intertwined.",1088294400,4,678,4.565573770491803
1243454,5,B00001IVFP,"Though there are many older cities than New York, in the (relatively) short time of its existence, no city has captured the imagination, desire, love, and even hatred, that New York City has.  Ric Burns has captured all of these emotions and more in this, one of the finest documentaries ever put on film.
The series traces the history of NYC from its earliest days as a Dutch trading post through 2000 (an additional volume was produced after the September 11th terrorist attack).  Using interviews, stories, & archival material (prints, paintings, photographs, and old silent films), Burns pulls the viewer in to the life of all types of New Yorkers through the last 300+ years.",1080086400,2,680,4.904347826086957
1243455,5,B00001IVFP,"Ric Burns has, in fact, done the incredible.  He has written, produced, and directed a love letter to his home.  The documentary shows NYC in all its splendor, with all its warts intact.  It is a love letter to its buildings, its ideas, what it stands for, and its people.  It shows its heroes and its villains (Boss Tweed and co).  It shows its drive and its compassion.  It shows its legends and its myths.
In other words, it shows NYC for what it is, what it represents, to the people who live here and to the people who don't.
A towering acheivement.",1074902400,4,554,4.330097087378641
1243456,5,B00001IVFP,"I had the good fortune to live in Manhattan for three years, from 2000-2003. During this time I lived through profound, life-altering events that I know will forever mark my soul.
This DVD set tells the story of the greatest city on Earth, in such a poetic way. After each viewing, I feel more and more like I have a narrative to go along with the emotions that NYC generated in me when I lived there; that I was a part of the ongoing story of New York that began in 1609.
The images, music, and narration of the documentary hit all the right notes, and more than once gave me chills. And even though the documentary may seem overly sentimental at times in its treatment of the City and people, ultimately this film should rightly be considered a heart-felt love letter to New York.
In the end, I came to love New York City more than I ever imagined, and this DVD set made me realize that although I left NYC, I will never forget that for one brief moment, I knew that every time I left my apartment, I was standing at the center of the universe.",1074384000,5,1046,4.261306532663316

Ric Burns is great, I think.",1069977600,3,394,4.984848484848484
1243458,5,B00001IVFP,"Released in two stages (parts 1-5 in 1999 and parts 6-7 in 2001), Ric Burns' NEW YORK, to a new viewer, might feel sadly outdated. There's a lot of buoyancy and, as others have noted, a lot of ""rah-rah-ism"" going on. After all, the series was filmed during Wall Street's dotcom-induced high of the mid-90s, and all those smiles on the faces of former mayor Rudy Giuliani, writer Brendan Gill, and historian David McCullough are blissfully ignorant of what the economic collapse of 2000 and the events of 9/11/01 would do to Gotham and America. And the dozens upon dozens of shots of the World Trade Center are almost unbearable, at least to this New Yorker.
But try, please, please try to look at this remarkable documentary from the point of view of a pre-Y2K American or, for that matter, from an American of the future not so horribly close to 9/11. I stress American because the documentary is so U.S.-focused it would bristle non-Americans. (Actually, it might even bristle non-New Yorkers.)
If you can do that, you'll be in for one of the most insightful, poignant, monumental, and nothing less than brilliant films on the history of New York City ever made. I'm going to take that a step or two further--it is one of the best histories of NYC in any medium and one of the best documentaries on any subject ever made. The pacing is incredible. Part 1 which covers, roughly, the first 200 years of the city's existence reveals just how far back New York's roots extend. And yet, the minutes (and hours) go by quickly in spite of the extraordinary amount of information that's covered. The same can be said of the other six parts, as well. It's all so informative and brisk. And you'll be surprised how much native New Yorkers can learn about their own city!
And not everything is so rah-rah, by the way. The film is brutally honest about the downsides to New York's history. From the Dutch war with the natives to the Draft Riots, from Jacob Riis' revelations about the horrors of tenement life through the Triangle Fire, from the Jimmy Walker scandal through the scandalous plans of Robert Moses, New York is rightfully indicted for the many atrocities commited within its borders.
To examine each of the episodes here would be pointless--it would take too much time and still wouldn't express the importance of this film. I won't do that here. Ric Burns has created a brilliant installment to the brilliant American Experience series that I urge all New Yorkers, Americans and history-lovers to see.
Rocco Dormarunno, author of The Five Points Concluded
(PS--As for the glimpses of the World Trade Center, Ric Burns did produce an eighth chapter (in 2003) to describe the rise and fall of those towers to bring this all up-to-date. The tone and timing were appropriate and I recommend that along with this set.",1067904000,14,2817,4.739307535641548
1243459,5,B00001IVFP,"I caught certain episodes of New York at various times on PBS-I have yet to view every episode but have caught at least 4 out of 7.  What I have seen is very impressive, what with breathtaking photography-especially the scenes of the NY skyline that feature the twin towers of the World Trade Center.  Those views left me close to tears, having worked in NY's financial district for 25 yrs.  However, the entire series is great-yes, I can say this without having seen the first few episodes.  Anything by Ric Burns(as well as brother Ken)is worthwhile viewing.  I sincerely hope PBS continues to feature this series-hopefully in chronological order.  You don't have to be from the NY/NJ metropolitan area to appreciate this series, either.  Every frame is fascinating, every commentator gives detailed insight into the characters & consequences that have made NYC what it eventually came to be(at least prior to 9/11).

For those who couldn't view the entire PBS shows, this is a great way to view the series. The show is so rich in information, it's truly a learning experience about New York and it's history.
The contributers / experts / historians included in this series makes the event that much more entertaining as well as educational. David Ogden Stires does a good narration job as well.
Ric Burns, in my opinion, is as gifted a film maker as his brother. The set is a bit pricey, but it was something my partner and I enjoy, so it was worth every penny.",1053907200,4,580,4.281818181818182

Until I watched this film, I never understood why things are the way they are.  Why does the city have financial problems?  Why do ghettos exist?  Why there is no major highway cutting through Manhattan?  Why are individual neighborhoods so important to the infrastructure of a city of millions of residents.
Even if you are not a history 'buff' or a sociology major, you will find this film very compelling.  This film shows the forces behind what shapes our lives, our living, and our very existence.  This is not a film about New York City, so much as it is a pattern for life anywhere.",1050278400,5,842,4.457516339869281
1243462,5,B00001IVFP,I always loved New York and when I saw these 7 DVDs I learned a lot more. New York is the greatest city in the world and when seeing this DVD I saw the hardship New York faced. Ric Burns is an excellent director. This film is gripping and sensational. I learned that the 60s and 70s were very tough times for New York. This is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen and that is why i gave it 5 stars. After seeing the presentation I see that this is the best time to be in New York.,1046736000,2,490,3.8613861386138613

Yet, you will be able to see the greatness....the importance...the epic that is NYC in all it's glory, presented clearly and thoughtfully.
You will sit amazed at how insanely great (to steal from a well-known source) the Brooklyn Bridge is! The episode on skyscrapers will leave you shaking your head in astonishment.
As in the ""Baseball"" film, the ""talking heads"" here are so enthusiastic, I felt like going out, buying a portable DVD player, and using this film as a walking tour guide.
Wait...that's a really good idea...",1039737600,2,719,5.101694915254237
1243464,3,B00001IVFP,"The style and structure of this documentary is nearly identical to that used by Burns's brother Ken in his trilogy of breathtaking American documentaries, ""The Civil War,"" ""Baseball"" and ""Jazz."" This is an excellent format: Clean, evenhanded, evocative, democratic yet firmly rooted in an ideological framework.
But sometimes Ric, in ""New York,"" lets that style, and the intellectual brand of rah-rah American centrism that is behind all of these documentaries, take precedence over its historical value. One will learn everything about New York's development as a colony, its geographical and economic importance, the European immigration that swelled its population, and its relationship to the rest of the United States. The work gives especial focus to the strength of the city as a modern Constantinople, a meeting place of all the world's cultures and traditions that nevertheless manages to exist in relative peace. Amid all of this, however, several crucial historical events and institutions, especially those from New York's more recent history, are omitted. The Five Points, for example, is mentioned but never defined or located.
Also without mention are: The New York Times, the Mafia, the Battery landfill project, the theatre industry, the fledgling movie industry and its later removal to Hollywood, and the subsequent rise of Los Angeles as the only American city seriously to challenge New York's cultural primacy, the Beats, drugs, rap music (which is mentioned, but Burns is apparently afraid of playing us any), the election of Mayor David Dinkins, the gay and lesbian movements in the city, and the rehabilitation of the city under Police Commissioner William Bratton, seeing the most radical drop in the crime rate in the city's history.
In place of these we get more breathless paeans to urban multiculturalism, more tentative hagiographies of New York's most notorious characters, more desperate defenses of New York's apparently fragile position as capital of the world, more handwringing lamentations over the depredations wrought by the automobile and the suburban transformation of American culture, more vilifications of Robert Moses and urban renewal, and yet more breathless paeans to urban multiculturalism.
A balanced and thorough historical document would have been more valuable, both to us and to posterity, than yet another romantic hymn to New York. Still, as romantic hymns go, it's pretty remarkable.",1036454400,11,2441,5.477453580901857
1243465,4,B00001IVFP,"Having been to New York City numerous times I have to say it is the most amazing city I have ever been to.  This *nearly* exhaustive collection highlights many of the great and not-so-great aspects of this area of 20 million people.  If you are a history buff, this is a MUST.  You will kick yourself if you miss it.  But even for those who are not so hot on history, the stories themselves are so compelling that you will want to see the series thru to its conclusion.  My only gripe is that the final fifty years or so seemed to focus so much on Robert Moses , a character who IS fascinating and was without a doubt the biggest mover and shaker in NY, almost to the exclusion of other stories.  I wanted a bit more about other aspects of the more recent recent history of this world city.  I enjoyed the discussions of roadways and the deterioration of the Bronx especially-very interesting.  Much like his brother Ken's JAZZ film-which also rushed through the 1970-2000 period-Ric seemed to be in a rush towards the end of this film.  This is unfortunate because there are so many other avenues that could have been explored; the rise of film in New York and the rise of New York in film, more on the artistic community (for example).  Anyway, I suppose that would make the film fifty hours long and even the die-hards would lose interest.  In any case, a good intro to one of the world's greatest cities.  Perhaps an addendum to the film could be made to include information regarding 9/11.",1035158400,3,1494,4.452205882352941
1243466,3,B00001IVFP,"There are many glowing reviews of this DVD set submitted here, and much of what has been written I agree with. While it is true there is much to be said for this history of New York, I feel that it could have been said in about 4 or 5 fewer hours. There is far too much time devoted to talking heads speaking philosophically about New York, often repeating themselves. or each other, over and over. These experts often do have important comments to add, but they are allowed to do 2 or 3 times. Wonderful historic clips are often cut short to return to another talking head.
Burns also obviously loves the arial fly over video of NYC, as this clip, with variations, appears far too frequently. I doubt that more than 10 mins. of the film goes by without another arial fly over. Never mind that the film may be disscussing 17th century NYC, Burns has to throw in another fly over of contemporary Manhattan!
I found the music to be very dissapointing as well. In order to keep a sort of dark and somber mood throughout the film, Burns uses the same 4 or 5 music clips over and over again. By the last DVD I was quite sick of them. We do get a little bit of other clips - but ""Sidewalks of New York"" was not the only tune about N.Y. We get a tiny slice of Gershwin, and a few other tidbits but with all of the wonderful music that has come out of N.Y. over the last 100 years, there should have been much much more offered.
Keeping in mind that there really isn't anything else like this set, I would still recommend it. It is just in need of a good editor......",1029196800,4,1559,4.2

I have mainly been a resident of Queens until recently, I now live in Staten Island which also makes up one of the five Boroughs of New York City. In all of my years living in Queens, I never even Gave Manhattan a second thought, all I knew was that a lot of people worked there and that it was across the East River and I had to take a train to get there. That all changed on the Day of September 11,2001. It was than that I realized that I would never ever see the North  and South towers again, and it also made me open my eyes and realize that there was such a magnificent, historical and  breathtaking world across that river. I did a lot of research and purchased a lot of books , but NONE have even come close to telling me the history of Manhattan(New York), like these DVDs do. I originally purchased the book and than found out about the DVD box set, and I just had to buy it. I was just so amazed about all the facts that I have learned about New York , such as where all the Names of the Boroughs had come from , that Manhattan was not originally purchased for $24.00. and that the first settelers were from Huguenot, which the name is now of the town in Staten Island where I live. I do try to get to Manhattan as often as I can now,to make up for all the lost time. I can not say enough about this box set that has not already been said. I think the total running time is around 14 hours , and they are just filled with such interesting facts and people that are too many to mention in this small review.

While most of the documentary covers the previous 200 years of NYC, Burns takes the time to go back to the Dutch era and provide some very good history on that often overlooked period. My personal favorite parts are the two DVDs that cover NYC in the early to mid 20th century -- the era of Robert Moses.  Burns covers Moses very well, and fairly, if that is possible with a character like Moses.
Burns also goes into wonderful detail on the many waves of immigration that made NYC what it is today.  The use of old still images and film, along with excellent narration make this the best documentary on NYC.",1011052800,,707,4.5078125

Ric Burns explores the early history of New York, starting with the God-created attributes of the region and one of the world's finest natural seaports. But the treasure is found in what man has added to the Apple, starting with the Erie Canal, Central Park, the Brooklyn Bridge and the Subway system. The Bridge's history has itself been the subject of much scholarship, and Burns does it well also. The creation of the skyline, including the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building are some of the series best moments, filled with some of the fascinating type of information that fans of Burns' documentaries have come to expect and enjoy.
The history of New York is the history of immigrants, and the interaction of Irish, Italians, Africans and other groups is splendidly examined. The politics of the City, such as the rise and demise of Al Smith and Jimmy Walker are well explored also.
My few complaints are minor, and don't detract from the work. F. Scott Fitzgerald seems to have become a demi-god to Burns, and after awhile, I found the continued references to him and his
work tiring. More than a few minutes on the early history of Harlem would have been a welcome replacement.
I purchased the DVD version, although I had the videocassettes.  Am I glad I did!  It has two additional discs, which try to bring the series up to date.  Fiorello LaGuardia and Robert Moses, the two most pivotal figures in the history of the City, are splendidly explored.  More examination of the development and contribution of Harlem (which I lamented in the review of the VHS version) is also welcomed.  New York's post W.W. II predominance as the true center of the Earth is made plain.  As the series progresses, we see the value of the City (any city), the destruction of the great and old in the name of urban renewal, and the slow cancer of suburban sprawl.
Even those not from New York will find it to be a rich, interesting history, worth of the length of time one must devote to its viewing. The rest of the world will understand some of why New Yorkers love their home as they do.  Those expatriate New Yorkers will be tugged to head back home.

The combination of music and poetry  and image comes about as close, I think, to perfection as filmmaking can  get.  There are a thousand stories in the naked city and this is just  one of them, just one way of conceptualizing the history of the Americas'  great city.  I am not suggesting it is ""true"" or the whole story.  I thought of things that might have been included but were not (Brendan  Gill's insightful commentary on McKim, Mead & White's Villard Houses at  Madison and 51st, to take just one example).  But no one, in any  medium, will ever craft a more powerful, brutal, or telling account of how  New York has come to be.

7914340,5,B00001IVFP,"Note there are two versions listed here.  One is complete, and one is the first 7 episodes of Ric Burns' extraordinary 8 part, almost 18 hour history of New York City; its politics, economics, architecture, and above all humanity, from the first arrival of white settlers. (I would have been curious to know more about the Native Americans who had been living there, but the focus is on New York as a city, which arguably started with the arrival of the Dutch).

I was born and lived the first half of my life in NYC, was always passionate and curious about it, and yet the program had so much fascinating information I didn't know  not only about the distant past, but the complex back-room city politics and policy decisions (some disastrously wrong headed, even aggressively racist) that were going on in my early years.

It's always lively, often touching and asks important questions about what makes a city and why they're so important -- as well as ""how can a city keep 'modernizing', but not lose it's soul?"" It also forced me to abandon some supposed ""facts"" I'd been brought up with as a New Yorker, like the idea that names of immigrants were commonly changed at Ellis Island.

If I had to nit-pick it would probably be the use of hyperbole in some of the narration. I lost count of how many crises were 'the worst
the city ever faced'. But that is a tiny fly in a ton of ointment.

The images, still and moving, are beautifully chosen (great seeing moving images from the turn of the century New York), the various expert talking heads are passionate and articulate, and I learned so much more than I expected, and often felt on the edge of my seat, as if I was watching drama, not history.

It's interesting that film-maker Ric Burns' brother Ken has received so much more attention. I find Ric's many documentaries often the equal of Ken Burns' work, and indeed sometimes find them more emotional.

If you buy the package of the first seven parts, the last episode ""The Center of the World"" can be bought separately. It's also a part of the newer version of this set. It was made after the rest of the documentary, is devoted entirely to the Word Trade Center; it's inception, it's building (and the complex, sometimes dark politics behind it), it's successes and failures as architecture and urban planning, and of course its horrifying demise. While it's the most emotional of the episodes, it does feel a bit apart from the others, spending it's entire length on one very focused subject.

7914343,5,B00001IVFP,"This video would be great as part of the History course in Elementary school. Too often, the subject is presented in a book and down right boring. This video presents it in a way that captivates the mind. It ends the myth,""The Good old Days"". Life was rough for all the immigrants that came to our shores.
The video presents Politics the way it was, and the way it is today. Corruption of Power!
The video, shows how the common man strives to better themselves and make this the Great Country it is.
The documentaries directed by Ric Burns, improve everyones understanding of how things happened and why.
More people need to see them!

I do have one wish: That PBS create another series that picks up from this one that is just as good.

Outstanding. Congratulations.",1370736000,,200,5.419354838709677
