8618447,4,B005IKFUIO,"Good DVD's but could not believe there was no coverage of the VERY extensively Portuguese area of Marin County and Sonoma County, California, which was replete with dairies and Portuguese settlers and other success stories in the late 1800's and throughout the 1900's, including dairy and extensive landowner Manuel T. Freitas (who arrived from the Azores with nothing, became a dishwasher in San Francisco and became friends with a fellow dishwasher from Italy, AP Gianini, who went on to found the Bank of America!)  Overall the CD's were interesting and informative, although a bit repetitive in some places.",1427500800,5,611,5.23469387755102
