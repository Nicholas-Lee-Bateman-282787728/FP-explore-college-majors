2725734,5,B000M5BW64,if anybody grew when busing was a  way of life then this film truly hits  home.  one of  the Greatest Actors ever  the late  Great Calvin Lockhart  gives a  strong performance in this film which  holds nothing back and i would say this is a must see film.,1379980800,4,255,4.145833333333333
2725735,5,B000M5BW64,This was at a time when the educational system was being questioned due to the contrbutions of African Americans to world civilization was left out of the curriculum. I would recommend this to people who want to know what the educational system was like when white kids (a young Jeff Bridges) were bussed to a predominately black school. Calvin Lockhart gave a great performance.,1364601600,6,379,4.9375
2725736,5,B000M5BW64,"I seen this movie at a drive-in theater when I was a kid.  42 years later, and it still holds up, and is still intense!  Great seeing Jeff Bridges in one of his early rolls.  I highly recommend it!",1358899200,,197,4.0
2725737,5,B000M5BW64,"Calvin Lockhart in a lead, dramatic role. This is a must have for any Lockhart fan. This is a story that builds to a wonderful dramatic ending.",1347494400,2,143,4.333333333333333
2725738,3,B000M5BW64,"This is a movie that was the sign of the times so to speak. It gives you a glimpse of how it was in the late 60's. I enjoyed it, Calvin Lockart is one of my favorite actors. Very entertaining.",1325548800,,192,3.825
2725739,3,B000M5BW64,"Bascially, this film is about what happened in the early 1970s when White students were bused to predominantly Black schools as opposed to what is often seen  in films when the reverse happened in the South in this period.

As an African-American who was witness to both sides of this issue in Middle school in South Carolina in the 1970s (some six years after this film took place), it pains me to say that what is depicted here really happened in some instances. There were in fact cases where some Black students, resentful of the educational, societal, and economic privileges of their white counterparts, reacted violently against the latter, although this didn't happen 100% of the time.

With that said, this film does make a few lame efforts of understanding this situation in Calvin Lockhart's speech to the white kids and in the scene regarding ""culturally biased"" tests. But on the whole, the film itself is really melodramatic and heavy-handed (the girl raises her fist and yells ""Black power"" during the school riot comes off as more comical than confrontational as well as the fawning white liberal who yells ""I'm on your side"" to the Black kids during the same riot). Then there is the infamous ""We want to see if you're blonde all over"" near-rape scene. The dialogue and some of the situations here are really amaterurishly written and acted, and the cliches' found their way into a lot of the films about Black high schools over the next 30 years (angry kids, the prejudiced school offical who warehouses the kids, the naive teacher who wants to save the world, etc). Pretty much the foundation of what would be seen in ""Lean on Me,"" ""Dangerous Minds,"" Freedom Writers,"" (and wildly spoofed in ""High School High"" in 1996. Unlike those films, the ending here is far less upbeat.

One can see why this film is said to have caused tension on the set and banned in a number of cities at the time (1970 was the year of mandatory integration in schools in much of the United States and it would have indeed caused riots during that tense time). Fortunately, as some have pointed out, nearly three generations of integration has lessened the idea that this film would be taken as anything more than a time capsule and source of discussion for kids to today. So while the subject matter is important, the overall hammyness will cause most young people today to see this in the same light as an afterschool spreacil from that same era.",1248652800,10,2443,4.727699530516432
2725740,5,B000M5BW64,"One of the greatest movies of its time.  Sadly, many of the themes in this movie (racial intolerance, social/cultural/academic ignorance and apathy, etc.) are still applicable today.",1233100800,5,182,5.7407407407407405

8166702,5,B000M5BW64,"I purchased this OLD CLASSIC move because I remember watching it as a youth. I absolutely in no way condone discrimination in any form nor the use of profanity. Looking back at this move gives me great comfort today knowing that we have moved beyond such a very low point of Ignorance, Hostility and Hatred and more RESPECT and LOVE for MANKIND today.  Great Quality of Picture and Sound.",1445212800,,388,4.6231884057971016

8166705,4,B000M5BW64,"Horrible behavior of American teenagers in the 1970's . The acting by all was fantastic, especially, Jeff Bridges and Rob Reiner. Remembered a bits and pieces of it on late night television in mid-seventies. I was too young to see it  the theaters. Just as well I was living it myself. Not in the US but in Toronto, Ontario, Canada--not as violent but the name calling was prevalent. Being a child that grew up in the 1970's it was just a terrible time as far as race relations.  Nevertheless, the film captured the  savagery and primitive  behavior of the time period of 1970 at the time of the US secondary school busing enactment.

Didn't understand the point of why the black girls were ripping  the  white girl's close off? A very eerie scene!!! Probably a reaction to black men would possibly pay more attention to her for various reasons, coupled with black women's insecurity of the alleged notion of the western culture's standard of beauty is caucasian. Regardless the scene did it's job of capturing the viewer's emotions.

Dare I say, and it still stands today, when a women who are clearly more attractive than a certain mass of women, the low self-esteem and/or not so attractive women get attention starved and feel angry and scared of being ostracized and, worse case, they believe, they'll die alone.

Perhaps this film should be archived in the US National Film Registry.",1415145600,3,1389,4.7782426778242675
8166706,4,B000M5BW64,"saw this on an old movie station and was intrigued.  Ordered it and really got into the plot.  Very 70"" but the message is classic, how do we all get along when we know very little of one another?",1403481600,4,196,4.0
