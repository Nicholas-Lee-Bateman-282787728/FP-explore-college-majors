The movie begins with a stagecoach with four horses traveling along desert lands. The credits list European names, mostly Italian. A man along the road asks for a ride. A lone rider watches them from the hills. The man in the back plays a harmonica. The coach stops. There is a trick to steal a small satchel of money. The lack of the promised payroll causes a disturbance among the workers of Silvertown. [An inside job?] Two men get a room at the hotel. No bath. The Sheriff has to make another trip to get the money. Will there be another robbery? This Sheriff can shoot, they must be careful. The villains make their plans. One man does not want shooting; he has a hunch. The mining treasurer goes to Greenstone to get replacement money. Do the villains plan to steal the money by switching bags? This time they travel by covered wagon.

The other members of the gang fire pistols to distract the men guarding the money delivery. Later there are more shots from real bandits! The chase continues with a dozen bandits following the wagon. But they get away and arrive in town. The satchel is light. Novak saved the paper money. [They used specie in those days; more durable than paper.] The bandit chief complains about the failure. He asks for news about the next shipment. Four of the gang ride into town, then enter a home. There is trouble. They visit another home for food, but pay more than they expected. Two are arrested. The town has a new Sheriff. Later Burton's men capture the women and children in church; he will trade them for the silver in the warehouse or begin shooting these hostages. Then one young woman is killed!

The town will turn over the silver in exchange for hostages. The citizens plan to ambush the bandits and their wagon after they leave town. There is an explosion and gunfire, the bandits fall one by one in a dramatic manner. The shooting continues, bodies continue to fall. Novak improvises a telescopic sight on a rifle to end the war. Now the original gang wants to take the wagon of silver. Or will they? One man laughs, but not his buddy.

This is at best an average western movie. The story could have been better even for this lower budget movie. Was the story unnecessarily complex?",1342396800,,2256,4.5492610837438425
