2886386,4,B000SK5ZE8,"I'll just say it-- Elf Bowling The Movie is the weirdest Christmas flick since Santa Clause vs. The Martians. And that's saying a lot. On one hand, this is a low budget CG movie actually based on a computer game (!), and on the other hand it presents the most bizarrely cool and unexpected backstory about Santa ever-- that in ancient times he was a ruthless pirate, a bum who specialized in STEALING toys from children.

In this movie, Santa was such a crook, his crew mutinied and stranded him on an ice flow near, you guessed it--The North Pole. There he is thawed out by a race of sappy elves who MAKE toys. Naturally crooked Cap'n Santa starts out trying to trick and defraud them out of their toy booty, until his heart melts from the unexpected sincerity of the idiot elvin race.

The ""based on a computer game"" label aside, I cannot help but find this story intriguing. Santa is protrayed as a disenfranchised pirate who hones his skills of stealth until he can strike joy into the hearts of children around the world leaving nary a scrap of evidence--like a Christmas Ninja!

And aside from the fact that this is the most utterly insane Christmas movie ever made, I was also fascinated that it stars Tom Kenny, that's right, the voice of Spongebob (!) who I must say is hilarious. Although a kids film, the adult subtext to a lot of the gags was a pretty cool surprise as well. I imagine the writers and animators giggling to themselves that they were secretly making a bizarre ""underground"" kids film.

The songs are actually pretty tight and the animation of certain scenes is surprisingly, well, outstanding.

Two thumbs up for what must surely be the weirdest Christmas movie in the history of film. Collectors of movie weirdness and film oddities should enjoy this one. When I saw the title I never thought I'd say this-- but I actually hope these weirdo animators make a sequel.",1191542400,6,1893,4.605341246290801
2886387,5,B000SK5ZE8,"Here's one you haven't heard: The rascally pirate Santa Claus finds himself in a land of elves, who need help distributing billions of gifts to worthy children. In return, they let Santa bowl them over like 10 pins. But Santa's nefarious half-brother, Dingle, aims to disrupt the holidays by kidnapping--elf-napping?--Santa's helpers. The CGI efforts in this $6.5 million production are far superior to what you would expect at this budget.

The zaniness is effectively tied into wildly popular online videogame Elf Bowling, which has had more than 800 million downloads in seven years. The movie's story and music are amusing and original and add to the entertaining experience. The presence of Santa, a pair of zany penguins and the voices of Tom Kenny (SpongeBob SquarePants) and Joe Alaskey (Rugrats)make this  a must see movie. Holiday specialty sections will be the place to show off the eye-catching box art of Santa, elves and penguins among a colorful amalgam of candy canes and mistletoe.",1191542400,2,998,5.154320987654321

2886394,1,B000SK5ZE8,"I streamed this movie a few months ago. After watching TheMysteriousMrEnter's review of this movie, I just had to see what it was. I gave up 50 minutes into the movie. This is not a good Christmas movie and Santa Claus was NEVER a pirate, nor did Christmas had nothing to do with bowling. To be honest, I did not find this movie just plain bad. I found it hilariously bad. Even worse than Foodfight!.

The animation is hilariously bad, and to be fair, Foodfight! and Where the Dead go to Die have way better animation than this movie. The characters are blockheads, and they are also annoying. The voice acting is also hilariously bad. The plot is pointless and confusing. The humor is godawful and most jokes are either stupid or would mentally scar a child (I know this because I am NOT a child, and I was still disgusted.). And did I mention that Spongebob's voice actor plays Dingle, Santa's ""brother""? Tom Kenny is quite a talented man, but he did not deserve to be in this movie.

This is basically the Foodfight! of Christmas movies, and yet it makes those Disney movie ripoffs from Video Brinquedo look like Hayao Miyazaki's work (Yes, I do love Miyakazki's movies. Totoro is adorable!). I would rather watch National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation than this pile of crap.

Seriously.  It is that bad.

Horrible animation.

Horrible voice overs.

Terrible story line.

Completely failed attempts at humor for the children.

Even more failed attempts at the adult-themed humor mixed in.

Just goes to show you cannot throw together animation in a 90 minute film and make a good movie.

2886416,1,B000SK5ZE8,"Hold on tight, it's gonna be a bumpy ride.

So this Yuletide ripoff of Shrek begins with Santa and his inappropriately named brother, Dingle, as pirates. Which is actually interesting at first. I'd say right about at the two-minute mark the whole movie takes a turn for the worst. But let me go on: Santa and Dingle fall into the ocean and freeze, because they're near the North Pole.

Years go by, and they are unfrozen by a bunch of toy-making elves who make toys for no reason with materials they just happen to have. There's an elf named Lex who has a crystal ball that allows him to have magic powers, but it's unmentioned why the ball has these powers. Later Lex learns that he can use magic without the crystal ball, but it's unexplained why. Also, none of the other elves seem to have magic powers.

So, how does bowling work into this? Apparently these elves have an S&M desire to be knocked over with round, blunt objects. They absolutely LOVE it. So Santa and his greedy brother have a bowling contest, and whoever... Um... Gets a strike (They don't play a game of ten frames and take the average, it's somehow based upon ONE frame) wins control of the factory. I really don't know why these elves aspire to have someone boss them around, they seemed quite happy at the beginning of the film.

Dingle cheats, and the elves realize it right away. However, there is another contest later in the film where Dingle cheats AGAIN, and no one realizes it!! :( The elves come off as being of extremely low intelligence, especially when Dingle forges a letter from Santa to the elves saying that ""All elves stink,"" which the elves cannot figure out is phony.

This movie is a musical, but all the songs are annoying, have bizarre rhyming patterns, and seem very misplaced. Also, the humor is wildly erratic: we have armpit-farting elves and butt jokes that might make a seven-year-old laugh, but then we have words like ""Jezebel"" and ""do your mom"" thrown in, along with a submissive ""dumb blonde"" wife, and a huge-chested gold digger. All in all, the humor is too mature for kids and too immature for adults.

Also, it's worth pointing out that there's only one black character in this movie-- which in of itself is not racist; what IS racist is that this character was obviously designed to be a stereotypical black guy. Donkey from Shrek is funny. Leon from Curb Your Enthusiasm is funny. Carl from The Simpsons is funny. The reason why this black elf was not funny was because there was nothing realistic about the humor used in his dialogue and mannerisms.

I'm also not really sure what's going on with the animation here... All the characters look a little like they were hit in the face with a shovel. (Or a bowling ball. :P )

So, what is the theme of this film? Not to let certain films make it to production, obviously. One star, only because Amazon doesn't allow negative ratings.",1418169600,,2893,4.582205029013539

You don't want to field the questions about why Santa was originally a toy-stealing pirate with an evil brother.

2886429,2,B000SK5ZE8,"Why on planet kryptons ghost does this exist?

The film opens on a pirate ship where captain Santa Maria Clausewitz Kringle and his brother Dingle steal toys, but Santa leaves a basket of toys with a note to an orphanage in the water. (Presumably to be found and taken there)

The brothers spend their free time bowling on deck and in preparation Santa tells the crew to grab their balls. Im NOT making that up.
Dingle is found cheating and the brothers get into a fight and are thrown overboard and frozen in the water. The wash up at the North Pole and Santa lies his way into the elf legend of white beard becoming ruler of the elves and, well, becoming Santa.

The main struggle comes when Dingle wants to overthrow his brother because after a few thousand years he never left Santas couch, even after he gained a Mrs. Claus. Dingle kidnaps the elves and takes them to Fiji and Santa has to fight to get them and Christmas back.
The film is bad but its somewhat enjoyably bad. With a lot of bad jokes mixed in with (very) few good ones, Elf Bowling: The Movie is a great riffing film.

My only complaint (other than the production values, jokes, songs and writing) is the tone of the film is all over the place. It wants so bad to be a DreamWorks film but fails. It wants to mix in more mature humor, but ends up making more bad puns and questionable situations like Mrs. Claus strudel. Also, at one point when they are showing Santas raise to fame, they show him on the cover of Spanish Inquisition Monthly. They make throwaway references to Halliburton (thanks to my brother for pointing that out) and there are a lot of things done and said that anyone with a dirty mind could have fun with.

Also Dingle Kringle is voiced by Tom Kenny. (WTS?) Tom Kenny seems to be the Malcolm McDowell of voice actors: I.E. he has done a lot of great things but continues to get horrible rolls in bad-awful films. Are these guys hard up for money or something?

In the end this film could be a great deal of fun if you get with your friends and a few beers (or some enhanced eggnog) and riff on this from start to finish.

Do not watch this unless you intend to make fun of it, or you plan to do a video review of it.
