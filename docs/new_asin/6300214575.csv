252659,4,6300214575,"This film has been a favorite of mine for some time, especially since I lived under the nuclear shadow in its heyday, which came to a particular head in the 1980s.  Besides following the strained yet adamantly coherent progress of a middle American family through the 3 months after someone (we don't know who, or even if it was ""their"" first strike) attacks the larger centers of the US with nuclear devices.  Indeed, the political aspect is of no concern to the viewpoint of the film, except as the local authorities slowly lose hold in the northern CA town of Hamlin.  We see Jane Alexander attempting as best she can to maintain a sense of continuity, and her children appear to respond in a meaningful way, even as they begin to succumb to the hidden but ever-present antagonist, the radioactive fallout.  With little certainty except that of further decline, the ones who succeed are, ironically, the ones who concede that they can only carry out small actions of their own.  The film does have some trouble with technical details (e.g., why is it that radio amateur W6DN's transistors are all blown by electromagnetic pulse but not the ones in the tape recorder, spelling tutor and answering machine?), and the overall feel of the presentation, as in the musical accompaniment, make it feel like a made-for-TV special one might see on Lifetime or PBS, the viewer is still given a powerful image that the idealogues of the time would not or could not admit to the public they served.  As Alexander is committing one of her children to the grave, she asks, ""Who did this--God D**n you!"".  After such a ""war"", it seems, the politicians' popularity is without meaning anyway.",1035763200,4,1678,4.7854671280276815
252660,5,6300214575,"I have a personal reason for reviewing this movie: the writer of the original short story, Carol Amen, was a good friend of mine from church before she died of cancer.  Carol told me she woke up in the middle of the night covered with sweat when she envisioned this story and wrote it in one sitting.  She worked closely with the screenwriter, John Sacret Young (of ""China Beach"" fame) and was very pleased that he was able to flesh out the characters and situations without altering the main story.
This film, with its excellent acting (for which Jane Alexander earned an Oscar nomination) and a beautiful, simple yet haunting score by James Horner, is different from all of the other Cold War/Nuclear Holocaust films.  It's a story of a family and community coming together.  There is no magic pill that saves everybody in the end; there is no squad of commandos rushing in to defeat the evil Ruskies.  What IS there is a sense of connection with this ordinary family (particularly Ms. Alexander) as they survive what has happened and ask themselves, ""Why was I saved?  Why was I allowed to live when so many others died?"".  This is not a date movie, not a movie for an evening of brainless entertainment.  This is a movie to be thought about, to be felt with the heart.  As a history teacher, I find this film invaluable and use it in my classes to demonstrate the human costs of nuclear war since most of my students have never had to live under the serious shadow of nuclear annihalation.",996192000,25,1493,4.561797752808989
252661,5,6300214575,"Two anti-war films were released in 1983:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Day-After/dp/B0001WTVUW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Day After</a>&nbsp;and TESTAMENT. The former, released in the US as a made-for-TV movie, was visually sensational: missile launches, mushroom clouds, disfigured survivors, urban landscapes turned debris fields. However, the latter illustrates the notion that an understatement can sometimes be more compelling.

In TESTAMENT, Jane Alexander plays Carol Wetherly, the wife and mother of a 5-member family living in rural suburbia somewhere near Central California's Bay Area. Husband William Devane is off in San Francisco, never to return,  the day the Soviet  H-bomb falls upon it. Jane's character is left to manage alone the family's survival as their community, otherwise untouched directly by blast damage, copes with post-Holocaust disintegration. While some friends and neighbors leave the area for parts unknown, the Wetherlys remain.

TESTAMENT is not graphic in its depiction of nuclear war's devastation. What makes it absolutely compelling is the vision of a community, much like mine and possibly yours, and a particular family, everyday folks like you and me, facing the insidious effects of starvation and radiation sickness as they descend into the darkness necessarily to follow a nuclear exchange between superpowers.  Ms. Alexander's performance is soul-wrenching and powerful, as when she cries out for God's damnation of those politicians that have reduced her world to an endless horror.

TESTAMENT is not a feel-good film, but certainly a great one. It's an exercise in bleak despair, and one which ultimately focuses on nothing more than the basic human instinct to survive - the final tribute to a species that has engineered the means for its own destruction.",976406400,207,1861,5.925373134328358
252662,5,6300214575,"Aside from ""The Day After"" and ""Threads"", Testament dives into how the family survives after a nuclear war.  Most chilling scene in the film is when the mother takes only surviving son and her  godson, jumps into the family car that is parked in the garage and attempts  to commit suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning, but breaks down and stops  herself after making a number of attempts to start the car.  A very sad and  shocking film.  Not something I encourage anyone suffering from depression  to watch.",956016000,6,508,4.758620689655173
252663,5,6300214575,"Jane Alexander's performance as a mom trying to preserve family and community after a nuclear strike is brilliant. The scene where she wraps a mummy-like sheath over her deceased daughter is wonderfully done-and very  depressing. Less SFX oriented than Threads and The Day After(my pick for  the best of the lot) the film focuses on the almost certain collapse of  sanity, family, and community after nuclear war, in a brilliantly acted  way.",951264000,6,442,5.097222222222222
252664,4,6300214575,"I really like this film because it focuses on real people in a real situation. It seems to me to be very much like how it could be after a nuclear attack. I like that it's mostly about people caring about one  another and about one family's memories of their life together. Also  everyone does a fine acting job. Besides Ms. Alexander, I especially  remember the husband and the daughter. Very touching and warm. I can't help  thinking, of course, that without Jesus in their lives, they are, in the  end, hopeless though. Any death of any individual without Him is hopeless  and dark and tragic. One day there will truly be world peace, and no  nuclear weapons ever again. But only when He comes!",948672000,5,697,4.528
252665,4,6300214575,"A very quiet story about a family trying to survive after nuclear war breaks out as a result of a Chineese attack.  Jane Alexander stars as a mother who must try and remain strong for her children as she tries to cope  with the loss of her husband to the bomb in San Fransico.  Rebecca DeMorne  and Kevin Costner have supporting actor roles here as a husband and wife  that leave the town in the middle of the movie after their baby dies.  Most  of the town dies in the first month as radiation takes its toll.  By the  end of the movie Jane Alexander has only one child left and a  ""godchild"" that she is taking care of.  A very depressing film as  you try to put yourself in Jane's place as you watch your loved ones die.",939340800,7,723,4.122302158273381
252666,5,6300214575,"Unlike the glossy and melodramatic ""The Day After"", ""Testament"" is a low-budget PBS film that will keep you riveted to your seats.  It is about the aftermath of global war as seen from the eyes of a small town, and in  particular, one close-knit family.  Be forwarned, this movie is powerful  and unrelenting.  As the movie moves forward, it becomes more and more  depressing, and by the time the credits roll up, the viewer is spent.
As  stated by the other reviewers, Jane Alexander's performance is nothing  short of magnificent, and I've never seen anything to match it.  (If memory  serves me, I believe Kevin Costner has a small part in the film--although I  am far from certain about this).  Although you won't have any warm fuzzy  feelings after you turn off the VCR, this is a film that shouldn't be  missed.  Between 1 and 10, ""Testament"" gets a solid 9.",923702400,12,864,4.629139072847682

You may think you have seen a movie that cuts you to the bone, but you have not seen anything like this tiny, amazing film. If you are the least bit unstable or prone to depression, don't watch it. Avoid it like the sun during an eclipse. If, however, you want to see the most powerfully human movie ever made, watch it--if you have the nerve. Just know it will be with you for at least 34 years.

252780,5,6300214575,"Excellent film. Especially in this current political climate. The focus is on one family in a small community in California just after a nuclear bomb has been dropped. Because of this narrow focus, we are able as viewers to see how radiation kills each member of the family and how devastating it is both emotionally and physically. It is an important film for all to see. The whole cast is excellent. It is a real tear jerker and the ultimate cautionary tale.",1502582400,5,460,4.621951219512195

Truth be known, no one truly knows how he or she will react if a nuclear bombs are release. Now as when this movie, this story came out the threat of a nuclear war is still very real. Who truly knows how many nuclear devices were lost when Russian imploded. Or how many people are creating a nuclear bomb by simply following the directions off some dark site called the internet.

252785,1,6300214575,"Review of Testament
Hot Toasty Rag, June 18, 2017

Oh dear God, I wish Id never seen this movie. It was shown to me in high school, so I didn't feel comfortable just getting up and leaving class. How I wish Id had more guts.

If end of the world movies are your thing, then absolutely go see this one. Its terribly famous and a very good movie for that genre. I abhor that genre. Anything futuristic scares the pants off me, let alone end of the world movies. Literally, my bones start crawling, I get a sickeningly panicked feeling in my tummy, and I burst into tears. And its all because of Testament. Testament was the first end of the world movie I saw, and it has scarred me for life. Normally, I don't give spoilers during my reviews, but this one is pretty obvious. I cant really mention the plot without giving things away. The plot: We get nuked and die.

There you go! If you really want to put yourself through that, be my guest. I am giving you my strongest anti-recommendation I can give, since I reacted so negatively to this movie. I couldn't stop crying all day, even in P.E., and I had nightmares for weeks. And even now, years later, I cant even listen to the news without panicking. This movie is one of the, if not the, biggest tearjerkers Ive ever seen. So if you do go against my recommendation, bring a Kleenex box. And then get ready to curse Terms of Endearment for coming out in the same year; Jane Alexander lost the Best Actress Oscar that year.",1497744000,,1473,4.329710144927536
252786,5,6300214575,"Testament is a 1983 family drama film from Paramount Pictures, which depicts the daunting struggle of the beleaguered residents of a Northern California town to survive, in the aftermath of a massive nuclear strike on the United States, that destroyed nearby San Francisco. It features excellent performances by the lead actors, Jane Alexander, William Devane, and Ross Harris, as well as the talented supporting cast, which includes an early role for the young Kevin Costner and Rebecca De Mornay. The plot and character development are superb, and the story line is decidedly gripping and thought-provoking, albeit sobering and heart-wrenching. Testament is a very moving and emotional film about the devastation following a nuclear strike, and it merits a five-star rating, along with a strong recommendation.",1497657600,6,812,5.504

252849,5,6300214575,"I was working at Paramount when this came out and we had to go to a screening at 10 in the morning. Just another day, you take your coffee into the screening room, plop yourself down and try to stay awake. Well, let me tell you, this movie had a profound effect on me--to the point where the minute I got back to my office, I called my mom, just because I needed contact with a loved one. The tiny budget actually worked well for this film because it's just simple. Like real life is. Simple, nothing fancy. And it makes the horror all the more real. Especially now, at this time in our history, with a madman at the helm of the U.S., it's even more terrifying. There is a scene where Jane Alexander is sitting on the ground. She has lost everything. And she picks up two fists full of dirt in her shaking hands, looks up at the sky and screams, ""Who did this?!"" Omg. That seen is where I always get the lump in my throat. When you settle down to watch this movie, don't expect to be entertained. It's not entertaining, it's spellbinding--and it's painful to watch.

252851,5,6300214575,"This film is so achingly beautiful that it always makes me think and, in some places, always makes me cry.  I've seen it at least 10 times over the years because I miss things about it every once and a while.  I am a bit of a stoic emotionally, having survived a fairy tale childhood somehow and lived to tell the tale... sometimes, I need a good cry and this film has often been the one I've chosen to reach me deeply enough to cause one.  The acting is wonderful, the writing prophetic and so very real.  The concept is brilliant - to show a nuclear attack from enough of a distance to see how society would change as the full impact was slowly taking effect.  Unlike most stories describing nuclear war, this one shows the process from the point of view of individuals and doesn't go the loud, ugly route to destruction but, instead, the quiet desperation and the small rends which lead to huge tears in the fabric of what we think of as civilization.  In that way, it is much more effective emotionally than the Mad Maxes and Day Afters of the world.  I wish everyone alive today, especially in country's with nuclear capability, should see this film and experience some of what using that capability would do to the world they live in.  It still holds up after all these years and I'm sure it will be just as relevant in another 30 years.",1492992000,8,1343,4.387096774193548

OK, I'll accept the why, but in 1983, I'll give you one guess who could have attempted such an attack on that scale, although why they'd want to out of the clear blue would be a good question.

Easily the worst post-apocalyptic movie I have ever seen, especially since it tries so hard to manipulate the emotions of the viewer. Ironically, the town of putzes portrayed in this stinker are just the sort who would sneer at and mock ""doomsday preppers,"" but when the SHTF, you can either be ready, or be like the victims-in-waiting portrayed in this propaganda movie.

Described as a dramatic story on the aftermath of nuclear attack in this country around 1983 and no one knew how it came about the possiblity of it hapening thru news reports or even who did it and why. That I'm sure would habe been constantly reported as the situation whatever might habe been that caused it. The only ""dramatic"" thing this movie puts you thru is the burying of people you don't even see them at the moment right before they die you get to know this once you see them getting buried at the cemetery. The younger son apparently one minute he has some kind of discharge when you see the mother sitting him into the ""sink"" of the bathroom cleaning his behind from what u imagine to be diareah with some blood u notice once she cleans him up best possible way and next thing you know she's burying him in the backyard. Daughter shows to be dead already and buried when you have just seen her playing piano..the dramatics of the movie is just people in a town dying due to radiation obviously, but you never get to see anyone lose their hair or hospital filled with sick people...I mean this is not movie, just like sitting in a funeral for an hour and a half!.
Thid is s low budget film and Jane Alexander did good on her role as a ca+ring mother and human being trying to hold it together but in a moment of needing comfort herself when husband never comes back she finds herself kissing the priest in the mouth making out right after she finished burying her younger son, now I understand needing somekind of support emotionally but certainly not at the moment it happened and with whom it happened. The only dramatic thing about this movie is the one time they show you the brightness of the light from the nuclear explosion some miles away from the town and she dropping to the floor with her kids telling them to cover face n eyes. The rest is just her mainly day to day dealings with her family as if nothing happenned. You get to see for maybe ten minutes a younger Kevin Costner and Rebecca DeMornay as a young couple thst lost their baby apparently to radiation as they lead you to believe n then they leave town to look for better place. Well if no one knows what happenned anywhere specifically and how much radiation has spread over the country and where, how do they know what to do next.
No clips of cities in the country to show you the real dramatics of what a nuclear bomb can cause when you see the devastation and instant dissapearance of human beings desintegrated caused by it.
Film describe itself a science fiction movie and I have yet to figure out which part that description of it applies?. With all thats been going on in this world for years now and terrorrism and rogue nations and on and on, is really not science fiction is more of a reality we will be facing sooner than we think unfortunately and when it does not one town in this country will be as calm as the one they present in this film!.

253172,5,6300214575,"I only saw this movie once, but I never forgot it...it's haunted me for the past 30 years.

Most films about the apocalypse of nuclear warfare seem to focus on the actual blast and its impact on the target area: shattered buildings, horrific destruction, vast numbers of human beings dying quickly or slightly slowly from blast effects or radiation. Sometimes they tell the viewer why the war was fought. ""Testament"" is different.

Jane Alexander is a fairly ordinary middle-class homemaker (Carol Wetherly) in an equally ordinary town near San Francisco, raising three kids with her husband, who is in the city when the bolt literally comes from the blue -- just as TV newscaster Clete Roberts is announcing a nuclear attack on the United States and a presidential address on the subject, the power goes out, air raid alarms go off, and there is the blinding flash of a nuclear explosion somewhere. Everyone runs out into the street to find out what's going on, and find all the neighbors have done the same thing.

After that, life in the small community slowly and perceptibly crumbles -- the supermarket opens at 6 a.m. and closes at 6:15 the next day, and cops stand by to make sure people buy the last of the food in an orderly manner. The power never comes back. Residents discover the town becoming covered with sand, which turns out to be fallout from the various nuclear detonations. A ham radio operator tries to connect with the world and gets very little -- rumors and reports of more destruction. The fallout starts killing people, including Carol's family and other residents.

There is virtually no violence -- except for a young bully who breaks into houses to steal stuff -- no armies of refugees, no wreckage. Just an understated and deeply dramatic trail of disintegration. A young couple (Rebecca De Mornay and Kevin Costner in early film roles, complete with Kevin in his high school baseball jacket) lose their infant child and flee to a rumored ""survival camp."" The Chief of Police collapses in a town meeting when his repeated promises of restoring power can't be achieved. Carol hands out ""the last banana"" her children may ever see. Her daughter, foreseeing the end, asks Carol what ""making love"" is like, as she will never experience it. The cemetery fills up with graves, so the dead are buried in yards, and ultimately just cremated.

As it trickles away, the values of humanity survive. Carol's oldest son, forced into an early and temporary adulthood, rises to the occasion, helping the orphaned and mentally retarded boy nearby -- Carol takes him in. The townspeople band together for a scheduled performance of ""The Pied Piper of Hamelin,"" trying to maintain morale, keeping up spirits.

The most poignant scene for me is the exhausted priest, mechanically performing his 47th burial service of the day for Carol's daughter, in her backyard. After that was a suicide attempt, and the birthday scene that ends the film -- hope and hopelessness at the same time.

Jane Alexander was at the top of her game in that film, but she's good reading the phone book. However, the searing imagery of how humanity and civilization would end in a trickle of fallout, hopelessness, and death remains stamped into my mind.

This is not a film about nuclear war. This is a film about what it does. I saw it only once. I don't think I have to see it again.

When I think of this film, I am reminded of a quote from a great friend of mine: ""It takes a scientist or an engineer to tell you how to build an atomic bomb. It takes a historian or a classical scholar to tell you why you don't.""",1438128000,2,3605,4.70952380952381

As for Testament it projects the premise that nuclear war would ultimately lead to the slow death of civilization. It is done in a very understated way. There are no explosions, no disfigured people wandering around. Nevertheless, the fact that the horrific point of the movie is so drastically understated is what makes the movie so effective.

Not that the film was bad by any stretch of the imagination, quite the opposite. Testament was one of the saddest films I ever saw, and I remember a lot of the scenes that this film burned into my brain. As one writer on here wrote, of the many ""nuclear war"" films that were pumped out in the 1980's (Day After, Threads,), this one was probably the most tame of them. Testament didn't depict buildings burning, cities being leveled, or mushroom clouds in the distance, and instead took a more silent look at the phenomena. Testament depicts nuclear war in a way that some of the nations during the Cold War have thought about it, by possibly using weapons such as a Neutron Bomb that left the infrastructures of countries untouched, while killing everyone through radiation poisoning. What ""Threads"" did on one extreme end (destruction and devastation), Testament did a lot more quietly, but told a story just as powerful. The performances of the actors and actresses in this film were fantastic, and Jane Alexander was absolutely outstanding in her role.

253248,5,6300214575,"Nuclear war movies of the 1980s tend to be very similar. For example, they start with a U.S.-Soviet crisis already in progress. They tend to rely on special effects and stock footage during the attack sequences. They tend to be very graphic in depicting the consequences of a nuclear war (destroyed buildings, incinerated people, severe burn casualties, radiation sickness, etc.).

Testament is none of these.

There are no special effects, except for the flashes used to depict nuclear weapons detonating in the Bay Area. You never see a mushroom cloud in Testament. Or a destroyed building. Or a victim of severe burns or flash blindness.

What you see is a normal family leading a normal life in a typical small American community - until Bert & Ernie are replaced on the TV screen in the Wetherly family living room with a newscaster reporting nuclear explosions up and down the East Coast. Seconds later, bright flashes erupt from the direction of the Bay Area.

From this point on, nothing is normal anymore.

Instead of mushroom clouds, we see confused and panicked townspeople running up and down a suburban street looking for their loved ones. Instead of shattered buildings, you see shattered lives. Instead of incinerated bodies, you see funerals - at first with all the accoutrements, then with fewer people, and finally, graves in the back yard.

You see no explicit deaths in Testament - you see bodies, wrapped in burial shrouds or plastic bags - being buried at the cemetery or incinerated in a mass funeral pyre in the overflowing cemetery. You see Carol Wetherly (Jane Alexander) becoming skinnier and more pale and losing her hair.

It's rather an annoying old trope to say ""If you see only one film about [blank], see this one,"" but in this case, it's true. If you see only one film about nuclear war, watch Testament. Its lack of graphicness in depicting the horrors of nuclear are in reality far more graphic than Threads, The Day After, or The War Game.",1424822400,3,1976,4.845697329376854

This profoundly compelling masterpiece instead relies on exceptional acting, writing, and directing talents. The flick is the most realistic to date of any that have tried to accurately portray a slice of America as it would be after a nuclear holocaust. It's one of the few movies of any genre that was so real that at times I thought that I was actually experiencing it. Credit the electrifyingly poignant but sternly realistic direction, the real-world script, and the exceptionally charismatic performances by the sincere Jane Alexander as the family's mother, the always enthusiastic and fun William Devane as the dad, and the easy going and natural Ross Harris as the barely-teenage son. This beautiful but sad film also features nice work from Roxana Zal - a contemporary TV star - as the teen daughter, and as the six-year-old son, Lukas Haas, who played the title character in the Harrison Ford-starring blockbuster ""Witness"". Curiously, future superstars Kevin Costner and Rebecca DeMornay make their film debuts in minor roles. Even notoriously stingy, superstar critic Roger Ebert gave this work of celluloid art four out of four stars, proclaiming that "" 'Testament' may be the first movie in a long time that will make you cry.

And the after-effects are much more devastating than those Hollywood has placed before us.  This family does not take a direct hit, of course, but does survive to take so many ""direct hits""--primarily through the slower devastation of radiation poisoning, and the loss of control of their lives; their own personal ""centers""; any predictability for the coming day; isolation from the rest of the world which may (it is implied) no longer be there.  For some, the realization that they will never grow up to know adult love or what it is to make love.  And always in the quietly growing panorama of more and more graves dug in the church cemetery until there is literally no more room.  There will be survivors, but for how long, the viewer does not know.  The story is told through the diary of the mother, played flawlessly by Jane Alexander.  Thus, the title ""Testament.""  The story is not sloppy or sentimental, but heartbreaking.  We know the family ""before"" through memories of fuzzy 8 mm films.  Testament is a reminder not only to make the world fit for the children--a theme expressed in a school play about the Pied Piper--but also to love every moment of our lives.

I saw Testament in full 70mm in the dark of the late, lamented the William's Center Cinema.  There were maybe twenty of us in the audience that day.  The profound story of a woman and her three children *living* in the shadow of a mushroom cloud in mythical Hamlin, California, touched me deeply.  Back then, we didn't live with Dirty Bombs; we were children of the atomic age.  I remember crying out in pain, when the daughter wasn't allowed to give a stray cat food. Precious Food.  Canned Food that wouldn't save anybody and was only prolonging the inevitable.  The woman adopts two children whose parents died -- one is a child with Downs -- even as she watches her daughter and youngest son succumb to radiation poisoning.  Her eldest son spends his days helping others. This family *more* than survives, while the community of Hamlin comes together and then steadily falls apart.

When the film ended, the entire audience remained seated and silent. Nobody moved for a long, long time.  We were *changed.*  We walked outside into the warm, blue-sky day and every single one of us *shivered...*

Testament asks us to remember everything -- the good *and* the bad, equally.  It asks us to *more* than survive in the face of adversity.  It belongs in every serious DVD collection.

(PS-- If you and I are together in a disaster, I'm sharing Precious Food with my Service Dog.  We'll eat together at the table of humanity.  Just sayin'...)",1386633600,12,1580,4.704379562043796

I thought, ""boy, now I have to see THAT movie!""

The two films are similar in that they are about the aftermath of a global nuclear disaster and what happens to a group of people as they wait for, and finally succumb to, radiation poisoning. That's where the similarities end.

On The Beach has a compelling plot with interesting characters, great music, and cinematography. In Testament, we watch as spoiled suburbanites die off one by one. It's depressing. The people are boring and not particularly likable or sympathetic. The uncreative cinematography is boring. Using a grainy home movie effect to signify memories is trite, hackneyed, and over-used. In On The Beach, the characters figure out how to make the most of the time they have left. In Testament, they give up, wander around like zombies, don't bother to educate themselves or think about survival. Instead, they fight over food, water, and video games so they can prolong their agonizingly slow deaths.

I can usually understand why others enjoyed a movie, even if I didn't like it. In this case, I am totally mystified. I feel emotions and cry watching On The Beach and lots of other great films. I'm appalled and a bit ashamed to confess that watching people die in Testament was like watching paint dry and the only emotion I felt was boredom.

When I saw On the Beach years ago, I thought, ""if this ever happens, I hope one of the missiles is a direct hit on my head, cuz I want to die quickly."" Watching Testament I thought, ""if this ever happens, and a missile doesn't hit me on the head, I'll take my gun and shoot myself.""",1380067200,,1830,4.638888888888889

253425,5,6300214575,"In 1983 the TV movie ""The Day After"" was broadcast. The movie was about the day after a nuclear holocaust. The hype on the movie in the previous weeks before the broadcast was extensive. People were told not to watch the movie alone, to not hesitate to call a mental health professional if needed. Clinics geared up to receive people for a kind of PTSD after seeing the film.

 The film, however, was a typical TV disaster flick. It was trivial and lacked any profundity. I was vilified at the time for saying this about the film. Nevertheless, the movie was trivial and lacked the ability to bring the audience into the story in a personal and profound way.

 One of the reasons for the film's failure, in my opinion, was that the writers and producers tried to present an impossibly heavy subject by overwhelming the audience with the massiveness of it all. That is a sure way for the film to fail.

 In dealing with such a massive topic, one that is impossible to get one's head around, the way to write the story, or make the film, is not to depict the events in a global and total manner. It is just too much for the audience. It overwhelms the senses and the emotions of the audience to the point that they will tend to shut down.

 To tell this story the writers and producers need to focus not on the massive story, but on the particular story of a single individual, a single family, and how that individual person copes with the aftermath.

 The 1959 film ""On the Beach"" did a much better job at this than ""The Day After"", but it too pales in comparison to the theatrical movie ""Testament"", which also came out in 1983.

 ""On the Beach"" did narrow the focus but still involved too many characters to succeed as the most profound movie of its genre. ""Testament"" narrowed the focus to one woman, Carol Wetherly, (played by Jane Alexander), and her children. As such the audience becomes intimately intertwined with her and her children. We become part of her family. We feel what she feels, cry when she cries, have our hearts broken with hers as she watches her children die. Her children are our children. We, the audience, are no longer watching a movie, but living the life of this woman, standing right beside her and experiencing everything she is experiencing.

 Because of this I believe the movie, ""Testament,"" is the most horrifying and the most heart-breaking and heart-wrenching movie ever produced in the history of films. It is the most horrifying because it depicts the aftermath of a nuclear war in such profound accuracy of what will happen to a community from nuclear fallout, without the typical trivial or grand scenes and dialogue found in disaster films. In ""Testament"" it is like we are seeing a documentary of what it will be like for many of us should a nuclear holocaust ever happen. And, it still could happen even though the Soviet Union no longer exists. The danger from nuclear war remains for us today a real threat.

 The movie is more than that, however. The documentary aspect is merely a subtle background. The real horror of the film is that it is not like a documentary at all, but rather like a very personal and intimate diary of a woman watching her whole world die around her. In fact, Carol begins to keep a diary after the bombs drop and her husband does not come home (he was in San Francisco at the time of the attack). The profundity of this approach to story telling on a topic beyond emotional imagination is beyond words.

 If you have not seen this movie, it is a must see. If you saw ""The Day After"", then you must certainly see ""Testament"" as it tells the real story that ""The Day After"" totally failed to tell.

 I do not think it is possible for any feeling soul to see this movie and not be crying like a baby by the end of it. It breaks the heart so completely, and even more so when we realize that what we experience in the film will really happen to many of us in real life should a nuclear holocaust actually happen some day. We can only pray that mankind will not be so stupid and reckless, but our track-record suggests that we most likely will be that stupid. God forgive us.",1377043200,3,4146,4.466225165562914
253446,5,6300214575,"There are a lot of apocalyptic end of the world nuclear war stories.  From the very first, ""Five"" to the very best, ""On the Beach"" to the most recent, ""The Road"" the genre is 62 years old and as diverse as ""The Day After"" which tried to fit a wedding plot in between all the file footage of stuff blowing up and early CGI techniques to ""Dr. Strangelove's comic ode to mayhem, ""Testament"" has it's own special place on the shelf right next to ""On the Beach.""  At their core these movies are not about survival or war, they're about human relationships and how they break down or hold up.  In On the Beach there is a young couple with their new baby.  They choose to use the govt provided poison to save themselves from a certain death by radiation posioning.  In The Testament made 20 some years later and uncluttered by special effects, the most violent act being a kid breaking in a window, the town of Hamlin whispers to a close.  There are no hordes of vandals raging through the town raping and pillaging.  No cannibals.  Instead we see nice neighbors for the most part (early roles for Kevin Costner and Rebecca de Mornay) and a typical family dealing with the end of everything they know.  After burying her first born and last born, her husband assumed dead in the initial blast the last remaining family members sit in the car with the engine on and the garage door pulled hut but Mom can't do it, unlike ""On The Beach"" as they choose to face their ends eyes forward.  I rented this to see how it held up after 20 years.  We were different people then.  We had dignity and this film depicts that.  And that is a message today should receive.  The sharp contrast between the civility we knew as a country then and today is the most stark message this film manages to convey to today's viewer.",1376092800,3,1799,4.395770392749244
253447,2,6300214575,"I guess that I am an outlier on this one.  I found this movie to be barely watchable and only because I kept expecting something to happen.

Spoilers follow.

The natural comparison for this movie is The Day After, which I like a lot better.  Where the Day After succeeds is where this movie fails.  The scenarios are basically the same: following a massive nuclear attack, a small town survives and must deal with the literal and figurative fallout.  In both, they quickly lose contact with the outside world and face a grim and depressing new reality.

The difference is completely in how the characters respond.  In the Day After, they begin working on the problem from the outset; determining how to measure radiation, how to limit exposure, what to expect medically and how to respond.  In Testament, they kind of shrug their shoulders.  Nobody seems to know anything or even to be inclined to go to the library to look it up.  Nobody does anything to limit exposure.  Almost nobody leaves to look for a better place.

In the end, the movies end up in a similar place: with sickness settling in and most efforts failing in the face of catastrophic environmental damage.  But, in the Day After, people are trying to find a way to move forward.  The movie ends in a very dark place, with no clear resolution, but you still have the hope that people are working to find solutions and that some of them will probably survive.  In Testament, nobody is trying to find solutions; they are waiting to die, without taking even the most basic precautions against radiation.

One movie highlights the human need, even in the face of overwhelming disaster, to learn, to understand, to work together, and to find some way forward.  The other has zombies shambling about hopelessly and helplessly, overwhelmed to the point of apathy.  I have no doubt that many people would respond to nuclear war in that way, but it doesn't make for a very engaging movie experience.",1375920000,6,1958,4.705882352941177

I have recommended this film to various people and I am glad to see that it is available.  I think of this movie every time I see Jane Alexander.

These days, we don't have to worry much about nuclear war - at least not as much as we once did - but the story told is so compelling that it deserves to be watched.  It stands proudly next to The Day After in a tie for the best nuclear holocaust film of all time.  It is utterly brilliant.

It's probably me, but as a child of the fifties, I certainly knew more about the effects of nuclear warfare and its its onsequences than the people protrayed in the film.

Nuclear detonations are prety hard to mistake, and everyone that was in my cohort had a pretty good understanding of what fallout was, how to avoid it as best you could, and how to deal with it as best you could. I mean, really; nuclear warfare+dirty gritty dishes left on the table = radioactive fallout. Wash and clean the dishes, or abandon in place.

So no one takes shelter, deals with potential after effects, or anything. They just kind of mope along, don't do any planning, and just die. Probably just as well. you would not have seen the smart survivors, as they would be alive and somewhere safer.

253530,5,6300214575,"The only movie that I will admit makes me cry every time I see it, Testament stands out among the many nuclear holocaust/cold war films of the 80s.  Unlike films like The Day After, Testament is not a schlocky science fiction film with mushroom clouds, graphic violence or the always inexplicable roving bands of post-apocolyptic survivors led by the hokey madman. This is a realistic portrayal of real people that will appeal to acting buffs, a realistic portrayal of post-apocolyptic circumstance that will appeal to science fiction buffs and a masterful screenplay and direction that will appeal to film buffs.

Testament is a realistic look at the survivors in a small California town, not directly hit by the blasts.  The ordered confusion, hopeful attempts to continue ""normally"", and then the frustratingly hopeless realization that all you knew is gone and you will soon follow.  Seen through the eyes of a ""typical"" family (realistically portrayed by a cast that includes veteran actor William Devane (the only well-known ""star"" in the film), Testament first lulls you into a sense of security.  Not by making the family a milquetoast cast of mannequins. The family is not at all dysfunctional but have the warts of any real close relatives.

On a typical day the family (the 3 kids portayed by Lukas Haas in his first role, Rossie Harris and Roxana Zal) goof about while their mother (Jane Alexander) awaits her husbands' (Bill Devane)return from a business trip to San Francisco.  The terror begins with an emergency broadcast on the television and then a sudden burst of bright light and air-raid sirens.  This is the beginning of a slow end that is as emotionally heartbreaking as it is frightening.

This movie has exactly the quality that makes me love a film - ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances.  Moments that stand out are the families taking in of the local gas station owner's developmentally disabled son after his father dies, the daughter's finding the courage to ask her mother what making love is like - realizing she will never get the chance to experience it herself, and the attempted suicide of remaining family members.  The story is sometimes narrated by the heartbreaking ""testament"" of the mother as she chronicles their last days in her journal. Also catch what may be the first screen appearance of a young Kevin Costner.

The film is a little depressing as there is no typical ""saved by the cavalry"" ending here.  This frankly adds to both the realism and the appeal of Testament.  This film proves that subtelty, great writing, great acting and great direction trumps special effects and action every time.",1265932800,6,2655,4.99092970521542

The story is pretty straightforward, and it leaves out info like what country did the attack, which would have made no difference to them anywhow. A nice, normal family goes about it's day, Dad heads to the city for work, Mom helps at son's preschool, daughter practices piano, and then the brightest light, a nuclear bomb goes off. They were spared the explosion but not the fall out.

As a mother, I found this story so sad and heart wrenching because the things that were killing her family were totally out of her control, and there was no place to go for help. This movie does take a real look at grief, from the teddy bear cene to the birds and the bees scene. With all the threats of terrorism, I think this movie fits quite well with today's society. It made me feel like I had no control over protecting my daughter, and the sad truth is I wouldn't be able to save her. Duck and cover? Get out of here. They just say that so people feel like there's something they can do. I loved this movie, and thought it was very powerful.

There is not enough space here to list all the technical and logical faults but I would have hoped the producers would have at least tried to get some of the basic science right - but no - it seems the budget for an advisor was spent on Martha Stewart.

Anyway, it got morbidly bizarre as it progressed on. It wasn't what they showed, but what they didn't show that made some of that laughter turn to serious and puzzling thoughts. *Spoiler warning* The movie takes a turn when people begin dying from not-so-obvious signs of radiation poisoning, and they die by the thousands. By the time the shocking garage scene takes place you get a feeling of hopelessness. By the film's end you get no real resolution, no happy ending, which is why the films stuck with me as actually being bizarre and interesting as such post apocalyptic films should be.

In all its purpose, films on that same token come around every once and again, and show us, truly and significantly how important the art of cinema and film making can be. This powerful strong voice of something well grounded and objective, which can easily dig deep into the portals of our existence and show us, in no uncertain terms, how totally insignificant our lives can be in a blink of an eye, and yet how precious every moment of life is. Here then is Testament.

If Jane Alexander, [in that era of nuke films, which for some strange and wonderfully odd reason my mother and I were into during the time when I was nine and asking about Hitler's lover and why we waste so much money on going into space when other's can't afford a healthy meal to get through the day] isn't enough to know from jumpstreet that this film would be emotionally charged with an approach so totally imaginary, as to show us perhaps the aftermath of a nuclear strike and the days following, leaves much to be desired to the world's power elite. 'Silo 9' and 'The Day After' and a little hidden gem called 'Threads', all touch on the subject with distorted cut scences of disaster, and plastic molded horrors with scences of mass death and the like, yet leave the viewer empty because of lack of creative emotions. (Save Jason Robbards obviously who is brilliant) Yet nothing, nothing can take us into the heart of the beast, and that is what Testament does, drops us right in the middle of the motherload.

Jane Alexander is a determined mother who must pick the pieces up from a typical day, that leads to anything but a typical future for a ordinary family gutted by the days and weeks following a nuclear strike. Ms. Alexander never lets us escape the mentality that even though all is lost, the notion to move on, and to endure, is grippingly fascinating and totally real. Jane shows us the motherly love in the very lowest form's of mans cruelty, can be pure, non-contrived and utterly tangible. I never believed for once, that Jane was acting. I firmly believed I was watching, at some points, a real life documentary of her familie's life. The juxtaposition of the black and white home films of their lives before the strike, reminded me of a real family, facing real problems, in a real, true event that would and can happen. Jane lost children. Jane's hair will fall out. Jane will lose more children. Jane showed us the murder, the lust for love after losing a husband, the very coinage of our times during fallout and gives us the indication that with every reasonable notion, with every passing day, that indeed death approaches, and with that one must ascertain the situation in its entirety, and keep on being a mother. The Academy got this one right with a nom for Jane, and see the beginning of a career flourish with young Lukas Hass, pre Witness, and a cameo by Kevin Costner before his eruption into mainstream.

Testament doesn't show us any CGI, it can't pretend to be something it's not, because it simply sets us up for what ALL of us, at some time or another would fear to the very bones of our existence, that loud siren sound of imminent danger, and for all that Testament was, it reminds us of how utterly miserable the world could be, but at the same time, in a wonderful sense of being together, shows us how we are capable of such wonderful, amazing and joyous love.

This movie paints a grim and bleak situation with  no real future as if to say that whether or not a nuclear war destroyed buildings and cities or not it's effects are devastating and will far outlive the war itself.",1197417600,,689,4.409448818897638
253604,5,6300214575,"Strange as it sounds, there was a ""golden era"" of anti-nuke films, circa 1980-1984 (a veritable flurry of cautionary tales, spurred on, no doubt, by the dreaded thought of Ronnie R's itchy trigger finger wagging ever more perilously close to The Button with every perceived Soviet slight).

One of the best of the bunch (and as timely as ever, actually) is 1983's Testament. Originally an ""American Playhouse"" presentation on PBS, the film was released to theatres and garnered a well-deserved Best Actress nomination for Jane Alexander (she lost to Shirley MacLaine).

Director Lynne Littman takes a low key, deliberately paced approach, but pulls no punches. Alexander, her husband (William DeVane) and three children (Roxana Zal, Ross Harris and Lukas Haas) live in sleepy Hamlin, California, an idyllic, Speilbergian suburbia, where it's just another day of getting the kids off to school, Dad off to work, and the garbage cans out to the curb. Alexander is directing the local elementary school production of ""The Pied Piper Of Hamlin"" (which becomes a significant, if somewhat obvious, allegory for what is about to happen to the citizenry of the ""real"" Hamlin).The children's afternoon cartoons are interrupted by a news flash that a number of nuclear explosions have occurred in New York. Then there is a flash of a whole different kind when nearby San Francisco (where DeVane has gone on a business trip) receives a direct strike.

There is no exposition on the political climate that precipitates the attacks, but I think this is a wise decision by the filmmakers because it helps us zero in on the essential humanistic message of the film. All of the post-nuke horrors ensue, but they are presented sans the histrionics and melodrama that plagued the more widely-seen (and in my opinion, inferior) ""The Day After"". The fact that the nightmarish scenario unfolds amidst such everyday banality is what makes it so believably horrifying. As the children (and adults) of Hamlin succumb to the inevitable scourge of radiation sickness and (just like the children of the imaginary Hamlin) steadily ""disappear"", one by one, we are left haunted by the final line of the school production-""Your children are not dead. They will return when the world deserves them."" Amen.",1190678400,3,2273,5.121293800539084

The TV broadcaster goes on to say that ""radar sources confirm the explosion of nuclear devices in New York and up and down the East Coast. ""Ladies and Gentleman"", the TV broadcaster continues, ""this is real this is not"" when he is interrupted and cut out by the Emergency Broadcasting System.

I saw Testament when it aired on PBS in the early 1980's and it still is  one of the most powerful and moving films I have ever seen.  For days afterward, I had this melancholy feeling that would not go away.

Testament is a quiet and dignified film about a family living in a town near San Francisco in the aftermath of an unexplained nuclear attack on the United States (I'm assuming by the former Soviet Union).  There are no depictions of the nuclear attack other than a flash of light in the film.  Nor is any explanation given on the reason why there was a nuclear attack.  You do find out in the film from the town's Ham radio operator, that the the entire San Francisco Bay area is out, up north (Portland, OR?, Seattle, WA? Canada?)are ok, and that there is no communication east of the Mississippi River.

Needless to say there isn't a happy ending, but the film does end on a somewhat hopeful note.  I also found the film score to be haunting, especially so, as the movie ends with it playing while a Wetherly family home movie is being played of the husband/father's (played by William Devane) birthday party.

Be sure to look for Kevin Costner's and Rebecca De Mornay's cameo roles.  Also, the town's elderly and WWII veteran ham radio operator was played by Leon Ames who was the father in the movies ""Meet me in St. Louis"" and ""By the light of the Silvery Moon"".

This movie was made in 1983 but I could see it as a horrific remake looking at all the events that have happened between then and now.

The movie follows a family & town that is dealing with the horrible aftermath of nuclear attacks on the United States.  When nuclear bombs go off, communication comes to a complete halt.  Throughout the movie you don't know what has happened to other people in the country, who attacked them, or if there is anyone out there who will be able to pull everything back together.  It really makes you think about the 'what if?' question and what the world would do if something like this took place.  Looking at this movie, it doesn't look like there would be much hope for anyone.

Testament is an incredible story but it is NOT for children or anyone looking for a happy ending or happy movie.  It is based on a book that was written and is very similar to a book in the way that the movie progresses.

The acting was excellent and the story very well written.

253662,5,6300214575,"Without sensation or hype, TESTAMENT appeared out of nowhere amid the myriad nuclear holocaust movies of the 80's.  With TV blaring ""The Day After"" and Reagan amping up the arms race, this poignant, touching little film quietly entered the fray.

Though it received a best actress Oscar nomination upon its release, it's been forgotten over the years.

I never got over its power and the emotional impact one little movie could have.

Director Lynne Littman dedicates the film ""to my family"", which is the heart of the film.  It centers on a mother who desperately tries to keep her children safe and her family together in the middle of an unthinkable disaster, without bringing much of what's going on outside into it  -- and in doing so, the movie amazingly avoids any melodrama by keeping the action focused and the drama real.

While her kids watch TV, argue and play, Carol (Jane Alexander) is listening to her husband's phone message that he won't be home in time for dinner.  Suddenly, the program is interrupted by a news report:  New York and the East Coast have been destroyed by nuclear explosions.

Littman goes all the way--her film flying in the face of movie convention, unflinching in her illustration of the slow course of radiation poisoning, the disintegration of society, and in watching one woman hold it together in spite of everything,

Jane Alexander's moving performance is heartbreaking.  Her daughter wants to know what making love is like, knowing that she never will experience it; she searches desperately for the teddy bear her son loved so he can be buried with it, she stoically sews her daughter's burial shroud -- the emotions are taut and controlled, and the viewer is left feeling a very real, very profound loss.

I sobbed when I saw this movie, and I'm no sap.

A very poignant, affecting and painful film.  Not to be missed.",1164931200,13,1865,4.820754716981132
253663,5,6300214575,"I have clear memories of watching Testament in the theater back in 1983. I remember the mother, played by Jane Alexander, watching her young son die over a period of days, and how devestated I was by her hysterical preparation for his burial - I wept, and so did all those around me. It was the most human, anti-war scene I have ever experienced in a movie. This was not drama for the sake of entertainment, it was the very realistic illustration of the fragility of our society, how quickly everything we love so deeply could be taken away from us with absolutely no excuse or explanation. It also portrayed very well the strength of the human spirit, how people tried so hard to go on with some semblance of routine and meaning to their lives, knowing they too had only days or weeks to live. The horror of war has never been portayed more effectively. I remember leaving the theater, looking at the Seattle skyline at twighlight, and thinking how much we take for granted. I wished every national leader would be strapped into a seat and forced to watch this film.",1164240000,12,1067,4.533678756476684

253666,5,6300214575,"Moving tragic human story of the horrible aftermath

of nuclear war.

This is one of the most powerful movies of all times !",1158969600,2,124,4.3478260869565215
253667,5,6300214575,"There are some images from movies and television that I watched as a child that have been seared into my brain:  the Yankee soldier who wets himself before going into battle in THE BLUE AND THE GREY; the venomous snake that spooks the horses in a river crossing in LONESOME DOVE which ends up killing Ricky Schroeder's Irish friend; the masks that the kidnappers where in FORTRESS.  Added to these images are a couple more: that of the residents of a small town burning the bodies of their citizens from radiation poisoning after a nuclear holocaust because there is no place left to bury them and disease is spreading too fast and that of a young father (played by Kevin Costner) carrying the body of his newborn child in a dresser drawer to be buried.  These last two images are from the film TESTAMENT.

TESTAMENT is the most powerful film about the aftermath of nuclear attack ever made.  It aired on television right around the time another movie about the aftermath of a nuclear war, THE DAY AFTER, aired.  THE DAY AFTER is kind of a special effects extravaganza complete with launching missiles, mushroom clouds, masses of people in hysteria, and makeup revealing rotting flesh and opens sores.  TESTAMENT is a much simpler film.  The atomic attack is represented by a bright flash of light and all telephones and televisions going dead.

Jane Alexander portrays the central character of the story, Carol Wetherly, and she does so brilliantly.  Wetherly is a stay at home mom with three children and a wonderful husband named Tom (William Devane).  The Wetherlys live in the small town of Hamlin, CA--not too far outside of San Francisco.  Tom leaves for work on the day of the attack and never comes back.  The agony and suffering of this story is relayed ever so eloquently on the day after the attack as Carol realizes that Tom is never going to come back, a realization she eventually has to share with her children.  TESTAMENT illustrates just how the people of a small community might have to deal with a nuclear holocaust if it ever happened:  people burying their family members in their front yards, town meetings in one of the local churches that continue to drop in number as the days pass, people using HAM radios in attempt to contact someone somewhere, the struggle to find food, the frustration of wanting to leave but not being able to because of no fuel.

Perhaps one of the reasons that TESTAMENT affected me so much is that I was raised in a small town and it made the threat of what a nuclear attack could do very real to me.  Many of the characters in the film reminded me of people I knew and I couldn't help but think to myself, what would I do in such a situation?  What would my Mom do?  Would we be able to survive?  Or would we die before our time?

When the Cold War finally thawed in 1989 and finally ended less than a year later, TESTAMENT was forgotten by many people as a relic of the past.  I've never forgotten the film and its images have been seared into my mind since I was a child.  However, in the post-9/11 world in which we live, TESTAMENT is a film that is just as relevant as ever.  As haunting and disturbing as the film is, TESTAMENT is a film that every American should watch at least once.

The DVD version of the film includes a couple of featurettes about the film as well as a timeline of the nuclear age.  I enjoyed the TESTAMENT AT 20 featurette the best because it was an honest reflection about the film with some of the principal actors.",1158019200,15,3499,4.505546751188589
253668,4,6300214575,"I watched this movie because I recently found out how close we came to that September 26, 1983 (Google that date). I just moved to Denver area to have a better life with my children that day.

People in the cities who died in the blast from nuclear bombs were the lucky ones because the people in the fringes dies from radiation poisoning. A woman assumes her husband died in San Fransisco and has to care for her kids and dutifully cares for others children. And she watches them die while the remaining parts of the  world (including where she lives) implodes.

There is one moving scene where she explains about lovemaking to her teenage daughter who knows that she will never experience that. I was also touched by how a 13 year old boy becomes a man to cope with the situation.

I recommend this movie. We are not safe yet from this abominable possible destiny. It may not be another country, now it could be terrorists.",1155340800,5,925,4.488095238095238
253669,5,6300214575,"Testament was a breakthrough movie for two reasons.  It actually was commissioned as an episode of PBS's American Playhouse.  When it was finished, PBS thought that it was too good for television and released it in movie theaters.  It was a major hit and garnered Jane Alexander a Best Actress Oscar nomination (she should have won).  The second breakthrough was the first film to deal with a nuclear attack from the survivor's point of view without saying who sent the missiles or bomb.  All other films before that and even after assigned blame, this did not care what the cause was just the effect.

Hamelin, California is a small suburb of San Francisco.  It is a typical small town of any large city.  The Wetherly's are a typical suburban family with father Tom (William DeVane) and mother Carol (Jane Alexander).  They have three children, the oldest Mary Liz (Roxana Zal), the middle child Brad (Brad Harris) and the baby Scottie (Lucas Haas).  The family has their problems but nothing too crucial or untypical for suburban family.  You might expect this to be a film about adultery or a family coping with loss.  But this is a film about something more compelling.

The family is watching TV when an alert comes on just saying that nuclear bombs have been exploded on the east coast.  Then a bright flash occurs.  No one knows what happened for sure.  The community is confused but everyone is okay.  Then they go into survival mode.

Two weeks have past and those remaining try to restore normal life.  But the fallout is starting to have its effects on the population.  Survival turns to desperation then to despair.  People continue to die.  The first in the family to show signs is Scottie and he goes first.  Larry, a neighbor kid that was staying with them is next.  He is then followed Mary Liz.

Hiroshi's father leaves and Brad brings him home.  Things are getting bleaker Carol is showing signs and so is Brad.  They decide to end it but cannot carry it through.  The film ends on Brad's birthday (2 months from the explosion) with a note of hope.

This is a film of little moments.  When the family goes to get gas, Mike (Mako) tells them that it's free to regulars.  Carol invites him and his son to dinner to repay.  Mike tells he has been repaid many times by her family's kindness. The school play, The Pied Piper of Hamlin, is performed with all the children being taken away.  There is a devastating scene where Mary Liz asks her mother about love knowing that she will never experience it.

I saw this in the theater and was blown away by this film and it is just a potent on television.

It's also interesting to see some early work by future stars like Kevin Costner and Rebecca DeMornay as newlyweds with a baby and Philip Anghlim, fresh off his Tony Award as the Elephant Man, as the pastor.  William DeVane as the father had success in television movies in the 70's but would not gain fame until Knot's Landing a few years away.

And the film has character performances by some great older actors like Lilia Skala (Oscar nominee of Lilies of the Field), Leon Ames (Mr. Ed) and Mako (Oscar nominee for Sand Pebbles and founder of East/West Players).

By the way, The Day After got much more publicity when it aired on television but this film is 100 time better.

DVD EXTRAS:

Testament at 20 - Cast reunion of Lucas Hass, Roxanne Zal, Brad Harris with director Lynne Littman twenty years after making the film with interspersed with interviews with star Jane Alexander, featured actor Kevin Costner, writer John Sacret Young, cinematographer Steven Poster, composer James Horner and others.  This is a making of film with a lookback.  Many of these featurettes are made at the time of the movie and are just promotional material.  Being made 20 years later and the cast is all alive, gives this more depth.

Testament: Nuclear Thoughts - This is a 13 minute anti nuclear short that, while provides food for thought, is so one sided that it loses credibility.

Timeline of the Nuclear Age -  A three minute written essay on nuclear bombs from the early tests to 2004.",1138665600,47,4099,4.622746185852982
253710,5,6300214575,"There's a morbid appeal to man-made-disaster movies. Tension, fleeting anxiety, and there's enjoyment in watching horrible things you'll (hopefully) never see otherwise. But there's a detachment, as well. We may wince and empathize with a character's plight, but as credits roll our participation rapidly wanes. It's not real, it's only a movie.

TESTAMENT is real. Littman's PBS film is far more chilling, pervasive, and in the end, effective. ""This is a movie about sheets,"" Littman observes in one of the extras. No mushroom clouds, no buildings collapse, no riots. And yet the urge to write your political representatives (or take up a picket line) is nearly unshakeable.

Good picture and sound quality with the DVD release, and an excellent set of extras accompany the film.

""Testament at 20"" is a well-done, twenty-years-later retrospective by Littman with the principal cast and crew. Of note: Rossie Harris (""Brad,"" the oldest son) discusses his scenes with ""Hiroshi""; Roxanne Zal, her character's inquiry into adult matters; and Lukas Haas reads the letter he wrote to President Reagan at the time.

""Nuclear Thoughts"" centers around airing the film to a small group of teens and their discussions afterward. Eerily poignant are the young man who disowns responsibility since no law labels the choice of nuclear exchange as bad, and the young woman so distraught over a girl's death and the mother's anguish who nonetheless keeps referring to the girl's body as ""it.""

""Timeline of the Nuclear Age"" is a text crawl of milestones, from the inception of the Manhattan Project through 2004. The United States' withdrawal from nuclear regulation of late is hard to miss.

Next time you cue up TERMINATOR, INDEPENDENCE DAY, THE DAY AFTER, or even THE DAY AFTER TOMMOROW, enjoy the disaster in all its artistry, but make it a double-bill and follow-up with a viewing of TESTAMENT. Just once should suffice.",1130025600,11,1911,5.148387096774194

It is not a thriller, the characters are very poorly developed and there is no clear story. I hoped that at some point a stray bomb may fall into the main characters city. It might have helped to give some explanation of what was going on. No special effects at all. Bright light means nuclear bomb.

I was glad to see that there were several DVDs for this movie available on Amazon.com. Although so much of the movie is now very dated (check out the answering machine that is as big as a breadbox!), the core of the story remains just as powerful as ever.

What I enjoyed most about this movie was it didn't need flashy special effects, trick photography and stock footage.  The performances of the actors and solid writing and direction more than made up for it.  This movie is some hard hitting stuff.  Forget about The Day After, you need to check Testament out for a realsitic view about post nuclear-war life.  It's not pretty.

253717,5,6300214575,"Testament has always been one of my favorite movies, and when the chance came to get it on DVD, I jumped at it.

In this movie, Jane Alexander plays Carol Wetherly, a harried suburban housewife whose husband (William Devane) is out of town when her world is shattered by a nuclear attack.  Unable to contact him, Mrs. Wetherly is forced to nurse her two eldest children as they succumb to the effects of nuclear radiation while the world is falling apart all around them, as well as confronting her own mortality.  Kevin Costner and Rebecca DeMornay also give surprisingly good performances as a young couple of Carol's acquaintance who, after losing their baby to the effects of the radiation, decide to pack up and move out of the area to escape.

One of the things I like about this DVD is that the extras, though few in number, are very good and offer some insight into what the movie is all about.  Testament At 20 reunites the 3 principal actors (Alexander, Lukas Haas, and Roxana Zal) for a discussion about the making of the movie, interspersed with clips of interviews from director Lynne Littman, composer James Horner, and others involved in making the film.  Testament: Nuclear Thoughts is more of an educational documentary, with school students talking about the film and its impact on them interspersed with clips from director Lynne Littman and actress Jane Alexander.  There is also a text timeline that covers the entire nuclear age, from the earliest Manhattan Project experiments all the way through Operation Iraqi Freedom.

Some people may say that Testament has become somewhat dated, but I still recommend it very highly.  In these turbulent times, it still conveys a message that should not be ignored.",1112140800,6,1727,4.886986301369863

Unfortunately, it appears the DVD transfer is nothing to write home about (no digital restoration), which is too bad.  However, this is probably the best we can expect from such a depressing movie -- these types of films (Dead Man Walking is another example) don't tend to be big sellers, and we're lucky to finally have it in the DVD format.

My dad was watching it and I was immediately drawn to it (much more than I can say about ""The Day After"" - that one didn't do much for me). I have had ""Testament"" on my TiVo wishlist to automatically record for months...to no avail. I am going to purchase the DVD because it made that much an impression on me- I agree with the other reviewers who have said that EVERYONE should see this film.  There are many movies I've seen over the past 25+ years; yet this is one I distinctly remember.  At 15, I was always cognizant of the possibility of a nuclear war; this faded as I got older and the Berlin wall came down- until 9/11.  With the state of current events in the world, I am brought back to those thoughts of nuclear possibilities - and the film ""Testament"".  I strongly urge people to see this - it doesn't matter which side of the political fence you're on, in the end it doesn't matter.  Yes, it is a dark and depressing movie, but unlike some of the other films out there, this one is very realistic, has substance, and makes one think.",1108857600,5,1106,4.218009478672986

This movie does not use all that. But this film needs to be seen by anyone living on this planet, especially the politicians AND world leaders who stress that we have to produce nuclear weapons for protection. It will make you wonder about why there is a purpose of obtaining nuclear weapons when they are made for survival, yet no one survives afterwards. And to those who wish to critize this film have no right to do so. People need to see that this film critizes our own greed, wealth, and the desire to gain power....money from our own pockets. This film was greatly put together. The director, producer, and the entire cast deserve awards. Maybe not the material statues from Hollywood, but perhaps just verbally acknowledging them for the great work they did on this movie. Even purchasing this DVD will show them that this film says a lot and gives a powerful message to all. Read the other comments and let your heart direct you to buy this DVD. Watch it with your family, children, and friends. See what children have to go through when a horrific thing like this happens. And watch the love and warmth grow after seeing it.

253761,2,6300214575,"I'm a picky person when it comes the technical aspects of what a movie is supposed to be depicting. This movie has many large holes in it. There is never even a light dusting on the town after the bombs go off. How can the people of the town die from radiation sickness when there is no fallout? In a major nuclear war the sky would be black from ash, dust, and soot, but the sun still shines like it's an ordinary spring day. EMP would typically destroy most electronic equipment, yet things like Ham radios and Speak-and-Spell still work. The town has air raid sirens, but there isn't one old Civil Defense radiation meter anywhere to help warn the people about increasing radiation levels? Nobody in town seems to have ever read a Civil Defense booklet about staying indoors and improvising shielding from household items. Having your son ride around town on his bike without even a dust mask on would have killed him first rather then last.

A real nuclear war would have been far worse then this movie depicts. At least ""The Day After"" gives some sense of what a nuclear war could do. ""Testament"" could have just as easily been about a some plague that struck the country. Overall, I do not rate this picture very highly as nuclear war movies go.",1106784000,9,1251,4.535398230088496
253762,5,6300214575,"Wow. This movie is simple and yet so heartbreaking, and it's sad to know that so few people have ever heard of it. Jane Alexander is what makes this movie; her performance is commanding and unforgettable. This is not to slight the other actors, especially Roxanna Zal, Ross Harris, Lukas Haas, and Philip Anglim, who all give incredible performances, but even in scenes where Alexander has no dialogue (for example, the scene in the church with all the townspeople), her presence is felt. This film is not perfect, and the beginning is rather monotonous, which is no doubt intentional, but there are a number of truly haunting and heartbreaking scenes that will linger with you long after the film is over. The extras on the dvd are also nice, with present day interviews with the main cast and filmmakers and interesting tidbits about the making of the film. It's interesting to see Jane, Roxanna, Ross, and Lukas as they look 20 years after the movie, and Kevin Costner is also interviewed, as well.

253763,5,6300214575,"Beyond Heartbreaking

I was in my local library a few days back and saw that they had the DVD release of Testament. I decided to borrow the film remembering I saw a few fragments of the film on cable in the mid 1980's. I will probably purchase a copy of the DVD since watching this film is an unforgettable experience.

I've been seeing movies for over 40 years and I can't remember more than a couple of films that have ever brought me to tears. To call this a heartbreaking film does not gives its due. It is truly gut wrenching and devastating. This is a genuine film about the unthinkable - far more disturbing than anything I've ever seen.

Without special effects, graphic images, or typical digitally built tricks and excesses, Testament portrays such a wide range of human emotion and experience for these people suffering through post nuclear holocaust. The filmmakers have not made a political screed or diatribe. This movie is all about humanity, decency and strength in the face of unthinkable horror.

The use of Jane Alexander's voice over narratives, the wonderful characters, incredible acting and directorial restraint as well as the beautifully written script make this film resonate forever.

This is a depressing, devastating yet beautiful movie that shows the decency and humanity of people experiencing the aftermath of the unthinkable. Jane Alexander's Carol, her children and her neighbors are people you care for and want to know even more. There are only a handful of movies or books where I've felt such empathy and genuine compassion.

One of the most unforgettable films I've ever seen.

-----------------SPOILERS----------------------------------

So many scenes remain with me.

-Jane Alexander's ""diary voice-over"" where she says ""I can't believe the man Brad has become ...and the man he won't live to be"" while Brad rides his bike through the desolate storefronts of the San Fransciscan hamlet.

-Jane Alexander bathing and singing lullabies to the dying Scottie is one of the most beautiful, powerful and saddest images I've seen on film. I could not stop crying after that scene and lay in bed for hours thinking of it.

-The sweet developmentally-disabled boy Japanese boy giving Scottie's Teddy Bear to Jane Alexander...

- And of course, Jane Alexander calmly sewing the simple white shroud over Mary. That image may be the most emotionally devastating film moment I've seen.",1103587200,9,2414,5.083544303797468

There are no scenes of monumental destruction, no sweeping fires or mushroom cloudes or scenes of the dead. Instead the approach is subtle and extremely emotional. While ""The Day After"" attemped to show the effects of nuclear war on the entire United States, ""Testament"" shows you one family. One family living in the suburbs and who anyone could relate to. You are drawn in emotionaly by connecting with each of the characters and by seeing and hearing only what they see and hear. After the attack they are left completely to themselves, nobody's coming to help them. They try to hold together with the other survivors in the community and at first it works, but as the effects of radiation and loss of life continue, this film becomes harder and harder to watch. As characters die for no reason other than radiation, that is when the film becomes so emotional that you can't help but watch it. This film forces you to put yourself in these people's situations and wonder what you might do in their place. This film is extremely depressing and that's where it becomes effective. But it also shows yet another tribute to the human spirit, to survive under impossible odds and even keep some small shred of optimism.",1102032000,10,1383,4.672131147540983
253766,5,6300214575,"Oh boy....here we go...testament has arrived on DVD!  Its been a long time coming but I am so excited to see this make it finally to the DVD format.

Let me tell all of you that this movie was a masterpiece.  I saw it back in the early 80s on PBS TV and it just rocked me to the core.  IM telling you people this movie is so powerful you will never be the same after watching it!

Its about a family living a typical life of experiences and activities.  They live in the suburbs of San Francisco Bay Area - the father goes off to work in San Francisco.  The kids are watching cartoons after school and then hell is unleashed upon all!  The TV is interrupted by news anchor notifying the entire eastern seaboard has been hit by nuclear missiles.  A flash explodes in the living room and a air raid siren blasts....

The story begins....we suffer through the agony and hopelessness as the mother tries to do the best she can to get her family (daughter and 2 sons) to go about their daily lives.

You become so emotionally connected to the characters and their feelings that it becomes utterly painful to see the aftermath destruction of nuclear war via radiation and apocalypse.

You will cry till there's no tommorow when you see the family slowly die one by one.  Its a feeling I've not experienced watching television or movies.  The acting is so beautiful and authentic you can forget you are watching a tv screen and think you are seeing a live performance.

I am so happy to see this come out on DVD it is really a wake up call to human beings as they will appreciate life and the world we live in as opposed to nuclear holocaust that is out there.

Please understand this movie is so depressing that you may need help to recover from it but its a fictional tale that hopefully never comes true.  Buy and see this movie as soon as you can because it will be a life changing experience for you - I have no doubt!",1097798400,15,1916,4.2924791086350975
253767,5,6300214575,"Saddest film ever made? Surely it's a GREAT film which reduces the unfathomable and thus numbingly abstract concept of nuclear war to a single community and (mostly) to a single family. It's beautifully acted and scripted. And it's achingly, heart breakingly sad. I have been brought to tears just reading someone else's description of the film. (Of course, the same thing has happened the several times I have watched the film myself). If you are looking for a film that truly shows the devastation that would follow in the wake of a nuclear attack, this is it. None of the other films that deal with similar subject matter (""The Day After"", etc.) come remotely close.

Likely the best--and most important--film to get its DVD debut at this late date.",1097020800,7,752,4.829457364341085
253768,5,6300214575,"I was 14 years old when I first saw this film.  Now I am 35 and still haunted by it.  Every scene, every transaction between husband and wife (although brief), between mother and child (the bulk of this film) is absolutely extraordinary -- full of a kind of richness and warmth that few on screen families have been able to bring to life.  We are thrust into the middle of their idyllic life torn asunder not by divorce nor teenage angst, but by the unthinkable: man's inhumanity to man.

What is so striking, is that these people are in the worst crisis imaginable.  As the family succumbs to radiation sickness, the bonds only become stronger.  Jane Alexander's narration as the mother, the lone remaining head of home and hearth is infused with the heartbreaking sorrow of a mother who knows her family will not survive and yet, she must go on.  Bracing herself against the devastation she deals with hourly, even the news her husband has not survived derails her only for second.  She grieves and closes it off again, knowing that her fate has likely been sealed as well and there is nothing more to do but go forward into her remaining days.

We get to know this family through the clever use of home movies -- happier times of languid summer days, goofy birthdays, laughter and brilliance.  These days are gone, and like the life review so many say they've done when on the verge of death, these movies are a slow, precise and moving reflection on what will never be again.

Although the subject matter is stark and very sad, in my opinion this film is suitable for all family members, provided they are mature enough to handle the subject matter.  Consider discussing it together afterward.  Given the world's current climate (I write this in August 2004) perhaps this film should be revisited by anyone who needs a reminder of how precious life really is.",1093132800,11,1863,4.6432926829268295
253769,3,6300214575,"Testament (Lynne Littman, 1983)

Littman (Number Our Days) turns in another the-world-blows-up film in the genre that was so popular in the early eighties (despite the Bay of Pigs incident having happened twenty years before, schools no longer doing nuclear war drills, etc.), but with a twist: the world never really blows up.

The story focuses on the Weatherly family, who are portrayed in toto by actors who either were then or are now A-list; mom Carol by Jane Alexander (The Ring, The Cider House Rules, etc.), dad Tom by William Devane (Payback, Space Cowboys, etc.), teen daughter Mary Liz by a young Roxana Zal (River's Edge and a host of Lifetime Original Movies--it's hard to see someone's career go that far downhill that fast, but there you go), and the boys, Brad (Rossie Harris, best remembered as the kid who visited the cockpit in Airplane!) and Scottie (the screen debut of the everpresent Lukas Haas (Witness, Long Time Dead, etc.). Surrounding them are various other members of the town who were also excellent casting decisions; Mike, the gas station guy (Mako, recently in the TV series Black Mask and as the bad guy in a host of gung-ho movies like Pearl Harbor and Bulletproof Monk) and the Pitkins (Kevin Costner and Rebecca DeMornay, both just starting out) were examples of the incredible job Marjorie Simkin did casting this movie. Unfortunately, it doesn't change the fact that, well, the world doesn't blow up. It's hard to have a nuclear holocaust movie without a nuclear holocaust.

What you're left with is a proto-Lifetime Original Movie, a psychodrama about a family who's lost their father in a terrible accident; this particular accident just happens to have wiped out San Francisco (in other words, set it in a different time period and this could easily be an earthquake flick). Looked at from that perspective, it's miles better than your typical LOM, but in comparison to the other films in its genre-- especially Threads and The Day After, the yardsticks by which nuclear-war films have been measured for twenty years-- Testament doesn't really make the cut.

The Lifetime Movie Channel, however, should they ever discover it, will get years of retread mileage out of this flick. Coming soon to a cable company near you. Then maybe they'll stop showing Mother, May I Sleep with Danger? once a week. ** ",1091404800,9,2344,4.924050632911392

253800,5,6300214575,"As most every reviewer here mentions, this is a quietly powerful film.  Jane Alexander gives an excellent performance as a mother trying to carry on after the most devastating of events.  Perhaps limited by budget, we don't see any gruesome special effects, over-wrought portrayals of screaming mobs, or even an over-blown breakdown of society version in this movie.

And that's a good thing.  By concentrating on character, the movie really packs a punch.  We can really identify with the family who isn't even sure the father of the family, who may or may not have gone into the blast zone, is alive.

The theme of the movie, an unbelievable cataclysmic event that kills millions (or billions), is as topical as ever, with the continued proliferation of nuclear weapons.  Not to mention the specter of bio-terrorism with its threat of an uncontained plague.

One comment I just have to make about the 'editorial review' in this case.  The small town in question is just north of San Francisco.  Sorry, but California isn't the 'Pacific Northwest'.

Thank goodness this is finally out on DVD.  I have the videotape; I bought it without knowing whether it would ever come out on DVD.  I wanted the movie that badly.

Very highly recommended.  This is a real winner, a must-see.",1082073600,5,1277,4.874418604651162
253801,5,6300214575,"I remember seeing ""The Day After"" on TV in 1983 and was very unimpressed.  Even with big names like Jason Robards and good FX you just didn't care about the characters.  Testament, which came out also in 1983 was a MUCH different story.  Jane Alexander stars as Carol Wetherly, a mother of a suburban California family, and the film starts out with the normalcy of family life.  They are watching TV when all of a sudden the TV show goes dead, and a newscast comes on to say the East Coast has been hit with nuclear weapons.  Just then a huge light comes through the window.
  This is a realistic depiction of what a limited nuclear war might be like for the few survivors, and here we end up caring about the people of the small town and especially the family it's focused on.  An old neighbor is a ham radio operator who has reached a few surviving communities, and we learn people are trying to get to Northern Canada where there are ""survival camps"".  Other than that there is no info at all from the outside world.  The town gradually sinks into darkness, oblivion, and radiation sickness, while Carol tries to keep it together for her kids.  The father is played by William Devane (Marathon Man) and we see flashbacks from before the world was nuked.  We don't learn exactly how the war happened other than theories.
  One couple is well played by a young Kevin Costner and Rebecca DeMornay.
  As the film ends Carol finally loses it and cries, ""Who did this, God damn you!"" a la Charleton Heston in the end of Planet of the Apes.  There is one thing I'd like to see in an End-of-the-World film that's never really been explored:  namely the philosophical implications of the world ending.  I mean even in this great film, the characters are concerned with their immediate circumstance in their small community, not the bigger implications.  Well maybe I'll write one with that theme myself.
  Since the Cold War ended full scale nuclear war is unlikely, however individual nukes by terrorists are getting more and more of a possibility (9/11 proves they have the will to use them), not to mention the new ""Powell Doctrine"" of using tactical nukes in war.  We all must work to make sure all governments know that ""a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought"" (that quote ironically comes from Mr. Nuke himself, Ronald Reagan).
  There are some other good nuclear war films out there from 1963's Ladybird, Ladybird to 1959's On the Beach and 1967's British film The War Game.  Also 1989's Miracle Mile is good, but more a satire than a drama.",1070323200,13,2556,4.58719646799117

  TESTAMENT is an emotionally draining film that will shake you to the core and leave you feeling numb for a long time.  I have yet to see a film that has been more disturbing.  The movie is about the effects of a nuclear war on a small California town. Jane Alexander portrays a mother who does her best to keep her family going while knowing the inevitable is around the corner.  Her performance is no less than stellar.
  Please be forewarned, tears will be shed.  You can not help but weep openly. This film packs one powerful wallop and will be leaving you grateful for what you have and will be making you think seriously of what could happen, especially in this post 911 world.",1068422400,10,852,4.375796178343949
253803,4,6300214575,"I saw the theatrically-released version of ""Testament"" in Berkeley California in the early 1980s.  This was the era of the Nuclear Freeze and huge mass demonstrations against the Reagan government's unprecedented nuclear arms build-up.  In the midst of all this landed ""Testament"", which is by leaps and bounds the most harrowing (and depressing) of any film dealing with nuclear war.  After the movie, groups of people just huddled together outside, many weeping.  This is strong medicine.
The movie is so sad it is almost unwatchable.  The film follows one family's experience in a small Northern California town.  Jane Alexander, future head and defender of the National Endowment for the Arts, plays the mother, alone with three school-age children,  There are no fancy special effects; the bomb is a bright light through the window.
Somehow everyone has to keep going.  One by one, people begin to miss work, students stop showing up at school.  When a banana appears, you know its the last one, ever.  The film's effectiveness is that we get to know the family and town, they are  just ordinary people, and Alexander is a terrific Everymom.  The school play scene is just about the saddist thing you will ever see on film.
The movie came out about the same time as the made-for TV, much hearalded ABC's ""The Day After"" which wowed with special effects and big-name stars, but suffered from poor character development.  This movie is the opposite - we care too much about these people.
My friend (an anti-nuclear activist)who was with me at the theater surprised me by saying she thought the movie was calculating and manipulative.  I have not made up my mind.  Also, with the immediacy of nuclear war somewhat dimmed since the early 1980s, I'm not sure the movie will have the same impact.
Also in the same serious genre:  ""The War Game"" and ""Threads"", which are British productions.  ""Testmanet"" is the better of the three.",1066176000,9,1930,4.907407407407407
253804,5,6300214575,"Why isn't this movie out on DVD? It's frustrating that so many great movies are being forgotten in the video-to-DVD shift. 'Testament' deserves to be in everyone's DVD collection.
Arguably the best cautionary film about nuclear war, 'Testament' is remarkable because it relies not on stylistic special effects, but focuses on the physical and psychological horror of a family in the aftermath of a series of nuclear attacks.
It is the unknown that scares us the most, and the unknown precisely what the small community of Hamlin, CA has to deal with. Who has attacked America, and why? How much of the US has been decimated by the attacks? When will the government, or military, finally step in and supply the answers? At first the Wetherly family and their neighbors are optimistic, believing that they are the lucky ones.
But weeks stretch into months, and resources become scarce. There is no running water, electricity, and even the canned food supply is becoming scarce. The government officials never arrive. And then the radiation begins to show its effect, as one by one members of the community begin to die.
Jane Alexander is a tour de force as Carol Wetherly, a mother who can do nothing as her family members slowly pass away. Just watching her struggle to survive makes you feel simultaneously exhausted and devastated.
'Testament' is an important film because it shows the effects of a nuclear attack, not in terms of action stars or special effects, but the lives of ordinary human beings.",1058313600,10,1504,4.925196850393701

253807,5,6300214575,"""Testament"" is the most intimate and arguably the most disturbing of the films made in the early 1980s dealing with the aftermath of a nuclear war.  ""The Day After,"" which also aired in 1983, is the most obvious example, but there was also ""Special Bulletin"" (1983), the BBC-produced ""Threads"" (1984), the animated ""When the Wind Blows"" (1986), and a Soviet film the title of which escapes me at the moment.  Unlike the rest of those films, there are no harrowing scenes of nuclear explosions or people ravaged by radiation sickness.  In that regard, ""Testament"" is almost naive; radiation sickness is nothing more than dark shadows around the eyes of the characters.  But this is not a movie about special effects; the nuclear war consists of nothing more than a bright light outside the window with telephones and televisions suddenly going dead (the film is set in Hamlin, a small California town not far from San Francisco, the obvious target).  The rhyme and reason for the war is of no consequence in the final analysis.  Instead, this is a story about facing the end of the world, recalling the film ""On the Beach"" (1959) more than any other work in this genre.
Based on ""The Last Testament"" by Carol Amen, the ""Testament"" script is by John Sacret Young, who would later create the television series ""China Beach,"" and offer many moments of subtle lyricism despite the subject matter.  The focus is on the family of Carol Wetherly (Jane Alexnader), whose husband Tom (William Devane) went off to work that morning and never came back.  The Wetherly's have three children, Brad (Rossie Harris), Mary Liz (Roxana Zal), and Scottie (Lukas Haas), and it is what happens to them after the bombs go after that affects us over the course of this 90-minute film.  Death is inevitable in this film, and ultimately the question is how it should be faced.  Director Lynne Littman provides scenes that become unforgettable because of their simple eloquence, most notable, one in which Carol finishes sewing up the shroud in which she has wrapped one of her children.
This is one of the most upsetting films I have ever seen in my life.  It took me a while to be able to watch it a second time, and that was because I was working on a presentation involving nuclear war films.  But watching it again was so superflous because the film was seared into my mind after watching it the first time.  Alexander's performance, as you would expect, is superb, but it is Zal (who was equally good in ""Something About Amelia"") who is the most poignant figure in the story.  Only once does the film threaten to break away from its pedestrian boundaries, when the school kids put on a play about the ""Pied Piper of Hamelin"" (remember the town's name is Hamlin), but even here the anger is submerged in the sadness of the presentation.  Watching ""Testament"" is a very upsetting experience because at the end it is impossible to avoid asking yourself a horrifying question...what would you do in Carol's place?",1038787200,96,2989,4.765503875968992
