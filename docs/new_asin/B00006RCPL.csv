2833021,3,B00006RCPL,"It's a fair copy, old and not exactly clear, but it's fun to see what Marilyn Miller was like and how she danced.
I love old movies and seeing the old stars way before my time. They are the foundation of our musical heritage.",1356048000,,225,4.136363636363637
2833022,4,B00006RCPL,"Good to have this on DVD! Marilyn Miller's dancing ranges from 'balletic' to 'eccentric,' including a dance of the latter kind with Joe E. Brown. Because the movie takes over many of the features of the musical comedy it is based on, there are numbers - notably 'Wild rose' and Sally's debut in a Ziegfeld spectacle (he is named but not seen)- that are staged as if for a theatre. This makes them good examples of accomplished musical comedy stage dancing of the period. The Follies number has an appropriate stage set and Follies style costumes for chorus girls, show girls (the 'Ziegfeld Strut' is in evidence) and a more balletic corps, who dance on point. (This seems to be the Albertina Rasch elemment of the choreography.) Although it was all shot in 2-strip Technicolor, only one section, the 'Wild Rose' number, survives in that process. It'a shame the 'Follies' section is only n black-and-white. It's good to have this available, and it's an enjoyable in itself as well as intriguing as a historical item. Sally's path from waitressing to stardom follows the conventional pattern. For good measure, she's an orphan (literally, a foundling) and her full name, Sally Bowling Green comes from the NY telephone exchange on whose steps she was found. Many thanks to Warners for releasing this and others in the series.  The presentation is simple - no extras and no chapters, just a division into ten-minute segments that you move through by using the remote.",1299196800,2,1464,4.879518072289157
2833023,5,B00006RCPL,"The two other reviewers are NOT commenting on the 1929 film with Marilyn Miller. Please, commentators, be more careful about what you write!",1298073600,3,140,5.130434782608695
2833024,5,B00006RCPL,"This film is based on the stage play of the same title produced by the legendary Florenz Ziegfeld. Though it is impossible to recreate his spectacular production in film, this movie does an excellent job in giving viewers a taste of what the orginal play was like. Especially opulent are the elaborate dance sequences (Wild Rose, which is the only surviving Technicolor sequence, and the Butterfly Ballet, which includes the whimsical, dream-like costumes Ziegfeld shows were so famous for). Many of the Jerome Kern songs from the play are omitted in the film, but most are included. The highlight song is the classic ""Look For the Silver Lining."" Marilyn Miller made it her own and hearing her sing the song, whose lyrics are so full of hope and innocence, in her sweet, tremulous soprano is enough to bring tears to your eyes. The film's plot is a classic Cinderella story, but though formulaic, it is a storyline that never grows old. Aside from the beatuiful sets and score, the stars of the film are what really make it a classic. Marilyn Miller's performance as a naive, dreamy orphan and her carefree style of dance truly transport the viewer to the fancy free feeling of the 1920s. Joe E. Brown is hilarious as a downtrodden prince who has to work as a waiter. Especially amusing is a scene when Joe tries to help an old man into a treehouse type of seat at a restaurant, only to have him repeatedly almost fall. It is classic slapstick, screwball humor! This movie is an excellent example of the best early talkies had to offer. It gives us a chance to see some of the most celebrated stage stars (Marilyn Miller) and their sincere performances leave no question as to why they were so beloved in their own time as well as our time.",1295308800,3,1741,4.619354838709677
2833025,5,B00006RCPL,"I was surprised how good this early talkie was, and interesting to be able to see a famous show with such a famous star.  You can easily see how good Miss Miller was as a dancer (particularly in the number 'Wild Rose') and the coloured segment shows clearly just what a great experience this film would have been to early talkie cinema goers. The one pity is that the print available is only black and white, apart from a short coloured segment half way through.  As a fan of film musicals it was a must for my collection, and only available to UK customers via Amazon.",1277942400,,569,4.3584905660377355
2833026,4,B00006RCPL,"This is a Warner Archive product. It is in fact a DVD-R and can be purchased directly from Warner Brothers for under twenty dollars.

Sally was made at the very end of 1929, and it is impressive to see how far sound technology has come in just one year. Although this film still used the Vitaphone sound on disc system that usually resulted in very static scenes, Sally has a high amount of fluid motion present that is uncharacteristic for a film made at this time. Sally's film elements are in somewhat shaggy shape, as is true of many of the early talking First National films. However, it is a very good and rare record of the singing, dancing, and even acting talents of Marilyn Miller and a very good musical in its own rights.

The story is adapted from the Ziegfeld show of the same name. It is about Sally Green (Marilyn Miller), an orphaned girl who waitresses and cooks in a diner for a living, but dreams of being a professional dancer. In fact, the very first shots of the film are of Miller's feet as she dances while she works. She also has an admirer (Alexander Grey) who stares at her from outside the caf where she works, causing her to get so enthralled in his gaze one day that she inadvertently makes the world's largest pancake. Sally is basically a Cinderella story, and a charming one at that. There is no evil stepmother in this fairy tale, however, so you can just sit back and enjoy this light romantic comedy and its beautiful musical numbers. The romance is provided by Alexander Gray and Marilyn Miller, and the comedy is mainly provided by Joe E. Brown. Brown plays a prince made penniless by a revolution in his country of origin who now works at the restaurant with Sally and is also her good friend. One of the most delightful scenes in the film is where the two dance to ""Look for the Silver Lining"" with Miller doing her more formal interpretation alongside Brown's eccentric dancing.

Marilyn Miller has been compared to Irene Dunne, and there is one scene where that is particularly true. An agent has a famous dancer client who has run out on him the night before she is to perform at a big society party. Sally helps him out by impersonating that dancer complete with a ridiculous accent and an outlandish headdress. This comedy bit very much reminded me of something Irene Dunne would do.

The film was originally shot in two-strip Technicolor, but only one color scene still exists that is under three minutes long. That one scene is Miller dancing to ""Wild Rose"" at a society party, and the colors there are truly splendid. As soon as the Technicolor kicks in, for some reason, so does a higher quality level on the sound. This color scene is included on this DVD-R version.

The DVD-R of this film has not been restored at all. It has been several years since Sally made an appearance on TCM, and its video was scratched up then and it still is in this release. However, the audio is pretty good except for the hiss of the Vitaphone. Highly recommended for the fans of the early talkie musicals, just don't expect a cleaned up film.",1261267200,12,3076,4.515260323159785
2833027,2,B00006RCPL,"{Actually, it's 2.5 stars.]  The little-seen film is written and directed by newcomer David Goldsmith, who also appears in this film as Jack.  He has an imaginary girl friend named Sally, and drives around a car in countryside before he picks up a hitchhiking girl Beth (Rachael Leigh Cook) on the road.
Meanwhile, Bugs, a patient at a mental institute, escapes to seek for freedom, and his fantasy woman's name is also Sally.  Bugs joins in the ride of Beth and Jack, and while the three people travel on, both males see the image of dream girl in Beth.
The performance of the three main characters are fairly good, especially Rachael Leigh Cook, who exudes her charm naturally, but to be honest, we have seen better examples of acting in the past -- DiCaprio (""Gilbert Grape""), Norton (""The Score""), Ribisi (""The Other Sister"") -- and compared with them, it is just OK.  Still, if you like Rachael Leigh Cook, the film might be worth your time.
Fine acting aside, I have little to recommend here -- I read that the same location is used as that of ""Girl, Interrupted"" -- but there is no anthentic feeling attached to the description of the institute of the film.  Excuse me for my harsh review, but I don't believe that one doctor, even if he is skilled in his techinique, would work as both psychiatrist and gynaecologist at the same time.  But that kind of unbelievable things happen too much, followed by flashy editing and camerawork.  In short, there are so many episodes quite impossible, and the film's fantasy/reality idea is hardly convincing.
""Sally"" has good ideas; Rachael Leigh Cook in road movie genre is quite welcome, and so is she in an unconventional role.  Still, this is not the right way to show her charm.",1047340800,6,1729,4.683168316831683
2833028,5,B00006RCPL,"Rachael's definite bestt. If you want a truely inspiring love story, this is it. The story is about a man named Jack who is driving with his imaginary girlfriend ""Sally"". Not far down the road he picks up a dark, beautiful hitchhiker, Beth (Rachael Leigh Cook), with secrets of her own. Soon after they find an escaped mental patient, Bugs, hiding in Jacks car. Bugs spends  lot of time going on about his dreamwoman. Coincedently named ""sally"". As the tension starts to brew between Jack and Bugs, the relationship between Beth and Bugs begins to grow, as they are falling in love. This only serves to infuriate Jack. One day, Jack tries to strangle Bugs, but Beth steps in and shoots Jack. Beth and Bugs put a wounded Jack in the back of their car. Just when Bugs and Beth think they've found the feeling of normal love, the police catch up with them. They are taken to a Marlboro mental institute for help. Once there, Beth reveals that she is pregnant and the head physician, forces her to have an abortion. Jack and Bugs have to let go of their rivalry and work together to save Beth, before it's to late.",1038787200,,1110,4.4950495049504955

8194743,5,B00006RCPL,"I am a big fan of Charlotte Greenwood (mentioned in another review here). Having seen Marilyn Miller in 'Sally' now, I appreciated Greenwood's comedic talents all the more. Joe E. Brown shows his skill for physical comedy in this film, Marilyn Miller not as much. That said, one can see how it is that Miller became such a Ziegfeld star.

I expected a sylph-like dancer and instead, I see a very athletic and attractive young woman. She can not only dance wonderfully but she also sings wonderfully. She's got it all; this film shows it.

The dancing is impressive. I do not know who was the choreographer. Good work!",1464825600,,617,4.651376146788991
8194744,3,B00006RCPL,"A very good film from the all-too-short career of Marilyn Miller. The highlight, of course, is the singing and dancing. Especially the dancing. Both Miller and (surprisingly) a young Joe E. Brown are terrific, out-Charlotte-Greenwood-ing Charlotte Greenwood. The rather stilted dialogue is itself fascinating in the way it shows how actors weren't quite sure what talkies were all about. One surprise is a short (5-minute) segment where it turns to color! The entire movie was done in 2-strip Technicolor, but this is the only part that survives. Alas, even though this is in a premium ""Warner Archive"" series, there are no extras whatever and there doesn't seem to have been any attempt restoration, as the print is rather fuzzy.",1460937600,,730,5.142857142857143
8194745,3,B00006RCPL,"This is a no expense spared effort by Warner Brothers Studio to bring Guy Bolton and Jerome Kern's 1920 stage musical, ""Sally"" to the screen. Petite Marilyn Miller recreated the role she played on Broadway with 150 beauties in the largest indoor scene ever photographed in color. 36 Albertina Rasch girls who toe-dance more than other choruses can clog, and an orchestra of 110 to play the hit songs that made Sally famous. The songs included; Look for the silver lining, Wild Rose and Sally (all by Jerome Kerns) and five other songs. Apart from a great performance by Marilyn Miller, the film is strongly supported by Alexander Gray, Joe E Brown, Pert Kelton and T Roy Barnes. I very much enjoyed watching this Cinderella story of a waitress becoming a Broadway sensation. Miller made only three movies and sadly passed away due to surgical complications at the age 37. A sculpture of Miller can be seen atop the former I. Miller Shoe Company Building at 167 West 46th Street in Times Square, Manhattan",1424304000,,1004,4.775862068965517

8194749,2,B00006RCPL,"My wife and I did not think that the film has held up.  The WB archive collection print was very blurry and the sound very limited, even for the time period.  We felt that the plot developed too slowly and that it took too long for the singing and dancing.  For its day it may have been great, but we failed to find any enjoyment in watching this film.",1404259200,,352,4.072463768115942
