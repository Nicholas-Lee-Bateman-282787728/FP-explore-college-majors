8183135,1,B000O75GEE,"Thought I'd pick this up today at my local Zeller's as the only copy of ""Movie Struck"" (Original Title: ""Pick A Star"") I had was recorded off of TCM. I needn't have bothered as that copy far surpasses any of these inferior television reissues. ""March Of The Wooden Soldiers"" (Formerly ""Babes In Toyland"" as the Astor reissue title card displays) is about seven minutes shorter than the full version available elsewhere; it is by far the worst print I have ever seen on video! A far superior copy of Bogus Bandits (""The Devil's Brother"") is available on a double bill with Bonnie Scotland on TCM's excellent 2 disc set. Have also noticed recently that a DVD copy of ""Pick A Star"" is available on Amazon (though the front cover does show Movie Struck as the title, so a little research might be in order before making a purchase!) for under $20.

My advice is to avoid this ""Laurel & Hardy Triple Feature"" set like the plague! I'm just glad I only paid around $3 for this set!! If I had paid the current Amazon price ($12.99), I would of felt supremely ripped off indeed!!

By the way, my 1 star rating is strictly for the really crappy looking video transfers, not for the content!

As I would like to close this review on a positive note, I highly recommend to Laurel & Hardy fans the new 10 disc ""Essential Collection"" set! It is superb, and it really does the boys justice!!!",1325116800,,1377,4.47808764940239

8183137,1,B000O75GEE,"How many times, under how many titles, are these Laurel & Hardy films going to be reissued? There are still many of their films that have never yet made it to DVD; these have been seen on various sets. Let's not get suckered into yet another rehash. When ALL the L&H shorts and features have had legitimate DVD release, THEN you cheapskate companies can reissue to your hearts' content.",1252368000,7,386,4.608695652173913
8183138,5,B000O75GEE,"I may have received a bootleg, pirated, copy. I have seen a different studio version of the film in this set titled ""Bogus Bandits"", which had dramatically better picture quality. In this set the faces in the films are washed-out, from making a copy, of a copy, several times with the faces fading, getting whiter on each copy.

Better print of ""Bogus Bandits"" is the same movie with the different title: ""Devil's Brother"" available on Amazon in a two-pack with ""Bonnie Scotland"".

""March of the Wooden Soldiers"" is available with better picture quality individually on Amazon.

""Movie Struck"" is available individually too, but I have not seen the individual print and so do not know if the picture quality is any better (it cannot be worse).

""Bogus Bandits"" or ""The Devil's Brother"" is set in the 1600's about a thief charming secrets out of a rich man's wife, and forcing Stan and Ollie to help him, at least to begin with. The film has some excellent singing, quaint sets, some good comedy, and a good ending that is cleverly set-up earlier in the film.

""March of the Wooden Soldiers"" finds Stan and Ollie in Toyland saving the damsel in distress from the bad guy. Quaint sets and good comedy.

""Movie-struck"" has a couple good songs by a young women. A little humor from Jack Haley the Tin-Man in the ""Wizard of Oz"". Promising but uneventful. Stan and Ollie are squeezed into a couple scenes, out of place in a story about others, and are shown arriving at the studio to do the scenes breaking believability. It held my attention, but in the end was a missed opportunity for having some good talent, a couple good ideas, and a story that could have done better.",1243382400,17,1668,4.656462585034014
8183139,4,B000O75GEE,"SYNOPSES for ""Laurel and Hardy Triple Feature"":

BOGUS BANDITS--  In 18th Century Northern Italy, two wannabe bandits (Stan & Ollie) join up with the notorious Fra Diavolo and aid in his plan to rob a wealthy lord. Appearing briefly as a woodchopper is 6'5"" Tiny Sandford. Prior to working with Laurel & Hardy, Sandford was in several of Charlie Chaplin's greatest films (""The Immigrant,"" ""The Gold Rush,"" ""City Lights,"" ""Modern Times,"" ""The Great Dictator"").

MARCH OF THE WOODEN SOLDIERS--  Stanley Dum and Ollie Dee try to rescue Bo Peep and her mother (who lives in a shoe) from their evil landlord, Barnaby. With music from Victor Herbert's operetta, this charming fairy tale is often telecast on Thanksgiving Day. You may not recognize a young Ellen Corby in her bit part here. In the mid-1970s, she portrayed 'Grandma' on CBS-TV's ""The Waltons.""

MOVIE STRUCK--  With the help of a publicity man, a young girl lives out her dream of being a movie star. Laurel & Hardy appear briefly in a few scenes and Scottish-born James Finlayson (as the director) is here  without his trademark handlebar mustache. Watch for a cameo by Our Gang's 'Alfalfa.' Produced by Hal Roach and directed by comedy veteran Eddie Sedgwick.

An excellent companion to this Stan & Ollie triple feature is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LAUREL-HARDY/dp/B00009YXEW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LAUREL & HARDY</a>&nbsp;(from LIONS GATE). Besides their Oscar-winning short ""The Music Box,"" this one contains ""Sons of the Desert,"" ""Another Fine Mess,"" ""Busy Bodies"" and ""County Hospital.""
