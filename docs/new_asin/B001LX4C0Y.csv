8320021,5,B001LX4C0Y,Good Stories for teaching kids. My kids love these movies and they learn from the stories. Helps them to visualize the Bible. I highly recommend this series is the most accurate I have found and is neutral on Christian religions.,1483747200,,229,4.75
8320022,5,B001LX4C0Y,"I bought the entire collection of both the Old Testament Bible Stories for Children, and the New Testament series as well. Although the Japanese-based animation is the same in both series, the flow of the storytelling and the music soundtrack is much better in the Old Testament series (although I must admit that on some of the DVDs, the story could have been shortened by 5 minutes or so). Both series are geared towards children, and it is the reason why the violence and attempted rape scenes were removed but still referred to, so that the view understands the context of the story. This is a great series for children to watch and learn about the Old Testament. It is a useful teaching tool for parents, especially if each DVD is purchased for $5 or less.",1437264000,,761,4.602941176470588
8320023,1,B001LX4C0Y,"This story includes cursing when David's son Amnon was angry because Solomon was inheriting the throne (""D*mn it, they've discovered us!"" something to that effect). It also includes terrible singing with lyrics taken from Songs of Solomon, and provides a visual of Solomon and the woman of that text sleeping together in a tent. We purchased this from Family Christian for our Sunday school class at church, and thankfully we previewed it Saturday afternoon to check for inaccuracies or inappropriateness. Thankfully we didn't show this to any of our students!! Do NOT buy this movie!! It would be better to simply read the story of Solomon from the Bible directly than to show children this absolutely horrible and inaccurate film.",1391212800,,732,5.108333333333333
8320024,5,B001LX4C0Y,I loved this cartoon especially watching it as an adult. I like the fact that even a child can understand the meaning. The concept is simple but entertaining!,1384992000,,158,4.678571428571429
8320025,5,B001LX4C0Y,My class really enjoyed it!  We loved watching it!  Especially since it went right along with our Bible story of the week!,1364860800,,122,4.5
8320026,1,B001LX4C0Y,"The animation is fuzzy and the content is not appropriate to younger kids
and in other video series - they have shown Joshua being burnt after he died - absolutely deviation from the Bible",1313625600,4,188,4.5588235294117645
