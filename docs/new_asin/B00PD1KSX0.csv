8687622,1,B00PD1KSX0,"I have seen quite a few of these episodes, at least in part. The best is the one where Scott Hahn says he avoids liturgical politics ""like the plague"". He endorses a view of all these matters in the Catholic Church which is magically aloof and untenable, which has become, in its liturgical digressions,  almost the source of humor for their mixture of pop sentimentality with vast portentous mystagogic theorizing. But this reaches an apotheosis of sorts when Hahn  says, that the greatest insight comes when they realize that  the very music they choose expresses the deepest realities of Christianity, and of heaven itself. Well, folks, if the contemporaneous music of the Catholic Church since the Second Vatican Council  expresses a deep mystery, then it is a mystery on the level of of an old Carpenters lp, and I don't call that heaven, but something a little sad. This is a contradiction beyond reconciliation. It is the evacuation of meaning combined with detached illusion. It lies at the heart of what is so mammothly strange about the Roman Church in our times. That is what the aesthetics say. What one's private view is, well, that is, at least in the abstract,  another matter. But that is NOT what they are claiming in this series, and in that lies the significant difference of general cultural interest. They are claiming a congruence between their bizarre puerile aesthetics, and some ultimate religious viewpoint, for which they require ultimate respect. The funny thing is that it is a view, by the way, that was condemned by Pope Pius by his Motu Proprio on Sacred Music in the early 20th Century. But one hardly needs that recondite factoid to make the point.",1314576000,3,1682,4.846689895470384
