8017632,4,B0001XAPF6,"Soy Charro de Levita is one of Tin Tan's funniest films. Tin Tan(German Valdes) and his carnal Marcelo protect a single mother and her baby from a bunch of boorish cowboys. This film loses a point for a racist, politically incorrect musical number where Tin Tan sings in ""Chinese""! It's like something out of a Jerry Lewis movie. Nitpicking aside, Soy Charro de Levita is a fun, sweet, lightweight comedy that hasn't lost its ""entertainment value"".",1232323200,,448,4.907894736842105
8017633,5,B0001XAPF6,"Esta  comedia es genial, totalmente recomendable para pasar un buen rato de diversin, adems te permite ver como era la vida en la provincia mexicana a mediados del siglo pasado, a mi gusto una de las mejores pelculas de Tin-Tan.",1173312000,,228,4.7
8017634,4,B0001XAPF6,"This is another hilarious performance by German Valdez, or as he is known, Tin Tan. It is a musical comedy in the great tradition of Mexico's finest family movies. Tin Tan's sidekick Marcelo is with him on this one and the two of them together are great fun. Marcelo gives a great Hamlet scene that is priceless. Rosita Quintana takes a major role as the third person in a musical troupe, along with Marcelo and Tin Tan. They stumble upon their ""good"" fortune of getting a contract as they are on hard times. It seems they are out for dinner and do not have enough money to pay. They perform a really funny song and dance number with the Chineese-Mexican (""Chinito"") restaurant owner being the subject of the song. A businessman sees them perform off the cuff and they are signed. Unfortunately they get more than they bargained for. Therein lies the basis for the comedy, as the adventures unfold while they try to get themselves  out of one hot situation after another. This is a super funny comedy that highlights the talents of Tin Tan. His physical comedy and his nonsense speak, similar to Cantinflas, is pure genius in any decade or century. He is a riot. His pachuco demeanor adds to the charm of his character. If you speak Spanish there are original language copies out there, otherwise they have dubbed versions. This is one funny movie, in black and white , that is worth owning. Get this one for gut wrenching laughs.",1172966400,2,1430,4.607843137254902
