7985105,5,B00008K77W,"Bront Country, located in West Yorkshire, a county in northern England, filled with fragrant heather and isolated moors, was home and inspiration for the famous writers Anne, Emily, and Charlotte Bront.  This delightful documentary transports viewers to Bront Country where they see these famous Yorkshire moors and learn about the life and times of the Bronts.. Not only does this DVD highlight the lives of the three literary Bront sisters, but it includes information and descriptions of the whole Bront clan and the village of Haworth as well.  There is much to be discovered about the history and life of the Bronts in this DVD, (perhaps not as much as an in-depth and detailed written biography) but for a little under an hour in length the viewer will see and learn about the most significant events in the Bront's lives.

What I learned from this DVD was how the Bront's lives were truly surrounded by disappointments and death.  Between losing their mother and older sisters at such a young age, growing up near a village suffering from a cholera epidemic with a terrifyingly high death rate, and having a unsuccessful brother addicted to opium and alcohol, the Bront's did not live a carefree and blissful life.  As children they escaped into their imaginations, penning fantasy stories about faraway lands and magical people.  As adults they grew serious about their writing and endeavored to support themselves by publishing novels.  It is amazing that daughters of a respectable clergyman can create such passionate, violent, dark, and haunting tales.  I loved learning that they wrote in minuscule print in order to hide the nature of their stories from their father who had cataracts.

I greatly enjoyed viewing this DVD and I am very happy to have it in my collection!  I loved the visuals of Haworth, Yorkshire, the family portraits, original documents, and the many possessions of the Bronts included in this documentary.  In addition, I took pleasure in the narration by Liam Dale and lovely classical background music.  With all the rich and striking landscapes and music by Beethoven playing in the background, this DVD was an aesthetic feast for my senses!

My one small complaint with this documentary is that there was not enough about Arthur Bell Nicholls in it. Since reading the novels The Secret Diaries of Charlotte Bronte and Romancing Miss Bronte, I have developed a fascination with Arthur Bell Nicholls and would have liked for his relationship with Charlotte to be highlighted more in this biography.

Overall, I exceedingly enjoyed my rambles amongst the craggy Yorkshire moors with the Bront sisters in this beautiful documentary and I highly recommend it to any Bront fan!",1248652800,,2709,5.044843049327354
7985106,4,B00008K77W,"This class-period-long (55 min.) documentary is perfect as an introduction to the Brontes.  Scenery, background info, authors' motivation to write what they wrote, the difficulties female writers encountered in Victorian England, death, disease, drama--it's all there.  Told with typical British wit and charm, including the tabloidy suspicions at the end.  Nice overview of and tribute to the ""weird sisters"" of Haworth.",1176163200,,421,5.868852459016393
7985107,5,B00008K77W,"This is a very well made and very informative DVD. While it didn't teach me anything new, that is only because I have read a great deal about the Brontes. So much so, that I can tell how much useful information this contains.

The scenery is wonderful, and the content and pacing is good, as is Liam's narration. The only complaint I have is that there is no guided tour of the Parsonage, the Bronte family home. This would have been the icing on the cake.

For the record, the Parsonage has been preserved in its 1850's layout, after Charlotte, the longest surviving sister, and her husband, Arthur Bell Nicholls, had carried out certain alterations, such as expanding Charlotte's room at the expense of narrowing what had been Emily's room, and widening the dining room at the expense of narrowing the entrance hallway.

I visited Haworth twice during my time in the UK, and this DVD gives you a good quick guide to the area. For any future documentaries, I would only request that they include a guided tour of the Parsonage and the much-haunted Black Bull pub, which Branwell used to frequent.

Well worth the money.",1142380800,9,1120,4.67005076142132
7985108,5,B00008K77W,"I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED VISITING THE BRONTE COUNTRY VIA OF DVD.  I ENJOY ANYTHING BY THE BRONTES!!!  IF ANYONE IS INTERESTED IN SEEING HOW OR WHERE THE BRONTES LIVED, THIS WOULD BE A GREAT TOOL. IT'S SO AMAZING TO SEE THE HOME SCENES WHERE THEY LIVED AND WENT TO CHURCH AT HAWORTH,YORKSHIRE,ENGLAND.  DURING THE TIME OF THEIR RESIDENCY AT HAWORTH, THE AVERAGE AGE OF DEATH WAS 25 YEARS OF AGE. HAWORTH HAD NO DRAINAGE/SEPTIC/OR CLEAN DRINKING WATER FACILITIES.  THE DRINKING WATER RAN THROUGH THE HAWORTH GRAVEYARD WHERE THE BRONTES LIVED IN THE PARSONAGE.  THERE WERE GRAVESITES ON THREE SIDES OF THE PARSONAGE, SO ONE CAN SEE WHERE THE DRINKING RAN THROUGH AND CAUSED POLLUTION AND DISEASE, RESULTING IN SOME EARLY DEATHS.

7985109,5,B00008K77W,"...it focuses on the the region around Howarth, the small and hilly town nestling in the dramatic and often unforgiving portion of the Western Yorkshire Moorland which seperates the county from it's neighbour, Lancashire. Equally it focuses on the lives of the Bronte Family from their arrival in Howarth, their Father was the town's new Rector and Irish by birth, through the death of the one remaining Sister, Charlotte.

 The story of the Sisters is told in well acted flashback sequencing and the anomalies of the story are also eluded to, such as the belief some had that Charlotte destroyed a remaining manuscript written by Emily, after Emily's untimely death from TB. It is a belief that suggests either Charlotte was jealous of her Sister's success with her novel, Wuthering Heights, or that following bad press about the great novel Emily penned, Charlotte burned the second manuscript to protect her dear departed Sisters memory. It is not even clear if these beliefs have any foundation in truth, this drama does not shy away from it however. The story is a s dramtic and as tragic as the novels the women produced and the landscape they lived in is every bit as wild, harsh and brutal as they suggest.

 I hope this inspires fans of the great ladies to visit Howarth because in my opinion in enrichens the work they produced to place it context, obviously Howarth today is not as it was then but you get a sense of it and their former home, as this DVD points out, is now the ""Bronte Parsonage Museum"". It contains artifacts such as original manuscripts, the sofa on which Emily breathed her last and one of Charlotte's crinolines.

 The Moors which so inspired them have changed not at all and as this film suggests you can get a real sense of Kathy's desperation in wild rain and wind.",1120608000,9,1800,4.698412698412699
7985110,4,B00008K77W,"I found this DVD documentary very facsinating!  It delves into the lives of the 3 Brontes sisters, who together wrote some of the best novels of any time period!  Narrarated by a man with a fun British accent, this DVD explores the areas where the Brontes lived, visited, etc. and received their inspiration from.
Whether you have read anything by Charlotte, Anne or Emily Bronte, this is a great bit of history and story, that will teach you a bit more about what life was like in their time, how they lived, society rules, etiquette, etc.
I highly recommend this DVD to any fan of the Brontes, or anyone who wishes to know a bit more about Victorian Britain!!",1082419200,11,661,4.546218487394958
