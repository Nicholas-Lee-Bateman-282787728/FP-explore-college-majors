8716530,5,B00XRFTE16,"Another excellent release from RightStuf! The second half of the Turn A Gundam series is collected here and finishes off the series. While there is no English dub, we do finally get a U.S. release of this show after waiting a very long time. The DVD has a reversible cover as well as a nice touch!

RightStuf also conducted a two-part interview with Syd Mead that's an hour long! A really great extra feature!",1464480000,,409,4.527027027027027
8716531,5,B00XRFTE16,"A really satisfying ending to a great series. Gundam usually has 3rd act problems, but this one really ended on a high note. Recommended if you're a fan of 90's anime or mecha.",1461024000,,176,4.363636363636363
8716532,5,B00XRFTE16,This series ends really well and you won't be disappointed with your purchase. This series has always been in japanese so theres no reason to complain since its owned by Sunrise. This Gundam series is one of my favorite in the franchise. Yes theres like no special features but at least you get the cleaning openings and closings. The fact they released it in the west is a miracle so go support this show! Thanks Sunrise!,1454544000,2,422,4.565789473684211

8716535,5,B00XRFTE16,I have watched the entire show now and I can say it was magnificent. I hope in the future we get a Blu-ray release and an English dub. If you are a devout Mobile Suit Gundam fan like I am these 2 Turn-A Gundam sets need to be in your collection. I hope people will enjoy the franchise as much as I do.,1439337600,9,301,3.7936507936507935
