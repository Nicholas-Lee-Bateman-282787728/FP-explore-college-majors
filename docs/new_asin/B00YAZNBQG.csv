8717855,5,B00YAZNBQG,"Though this 52 minute film was produced in Sweden in 1989, it has never been shown or made available in the US until now. It was produced for Swedish TV and directed by Jim Downing. There is so much cool music here, so that I cant recommend this too highly for anyone who was part of, or interested in, the New York Folk scene in the late 1950s.

Israel (Izzy) Young opened his store The Folklore Center in 1957 in the earliest days of the folk scene. TFC was a bookstore, a performance venue and just a place for musicians and poets (like Allen Ginsberg) to hand out and discuss music and politics. In 1974, with rents rising, Young moved his sop to Sweden and did the same thing there.

The film starts (and ends) with scenes of the Swedish store and Young begins the narration. Director Downing accompanies Young back to New York to visit the old neighborhood, hand out with old friends, and appear on a radio show on WBAI (where Young also had a show which he recorded in Sweden and sent over for broadcast).

Some of the highlights here are:
Heather Wood singing a powerful anti-Reagan song in the WBAI studio, followed by Danny Kalb and Marc Silber
Allen Ginsberg singing his Father Death Blues
Tuli Kuperberg singing a song in his cluttered apartment and fellow Fugs member Ed Sanders reading a poem.
A visit to Pete Seegers home in Beacon, NY where Pete talks and sings two full songs.
John Herald performing at WBAI
Young visits Mayor Ed Koch.

The opening scene has Eric Bibb singing Talking Folklore Center, a song that Bob Dylan wrote.

If just the above doesnt convince you to see this film, there is more.

The DVD is being released on August 14th (2015) from Music Video Distributors (who provided me with an advance screener).

 I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
