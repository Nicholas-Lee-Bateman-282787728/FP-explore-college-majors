3618916,5,B001GQ3ECI,"Have You Seen Andy is a must see for both parents and children. Ideally,
they will watch it together followed by a discussion on safety in today's world. It is more than just a story of one boy's abduction; it captures a piece of history and educates the viewer on how easy it is for a child to vanish into thin air. As a person who grew up in the Stadium Projects, I
can tell you it is very accurate and brought me back to those days. I was present for the search and aftermath of his disappearance, and it answered so many questions I had. For 31 years I wondered what happened to a nice kid who lived 1 door away from me. After watching Have You Seen
Andy, I feel I know the whole story. This is more than a local film, it is something that will be appreciated from coast to coast.",1234742400,,784,4.064516129032258
3618917,5,B001GQ3ECI,"""Have you seen Andy?"" is not just the story of a boy gone missing
that's written by a childhood friend.  It's about an investigation
started more than 25 years after his disappearance by a friend of a
lifetime.  That friend's early inquiries of that fateful day do lead to
more people that had seen Andy.  As the story unfolds, the emotional
overtones and persistence of the filmmaker transport the viewer not
just into Andy's life but into lives within the darkest sides of this
world.  The narration illustrates how it affected Andy's community then
and now.  Modern facts of the case create outrage to know resources
will not validate Andy's final resting spot.  However, the other
victims of the case, Andy's family and friends, show their strength and
what has been laid to rest.  For the other 58,000 molested and
exploited children each year, the question left is really what else can
be done?",1225238400,5,900,4.805194805194805

The story is captivating from the beginning, and leaves you at the edge of your seat hoping for the authorities to take a closer look at the evidence presented in the film.  I truly hope that there will be an updated version of this film in the next year or so with a conclusion to Andy's case once and for all.

3618919,5,B001GQ3ECI,"HAVE YOU SEEN ANDY won this year's Emmy for investigative documentary for good reason.  This a unique film that addresses a serious, but largely unreported, national problem from a most personal perspective.  At the age of nine, the producer/director/screenwriter, Melanie Perkins, lost her best friend to an unsolved abduction.  In making this film, she addresses her own personal experience and journey as decades after the crime, she conducts her own investigation into Andy's disappearance.  Through the process she learns and tells of us how large a national problem child abduction is--far more than the occasional reporting on a single child would indicate.  Because of her close connection to the story, her film speaks with an authoritative voice that no objective reporter could claim.  What she learns about this ongoing problem is harrowing.  But the care she brings to her subject tempers the horror with the stories of the lives this crime affected.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Have-You-Seen-Andy/dp/B001GQ3ECI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Have You Seen Andy?</a>This film is a labor of love and sorrow and, finally, catharsis.",1223942400,2,1186,5.982248520710059

8306642,3,B001GQ3ECI,"This is a documentary that hinges more on emotion than logic.
1) Perkins criticizes law enforcement for not doing a comprehensive broad ground radar search of the wooded area behind the pool for a gravesite. That was illogical and unfair. In the documentary itself it illustrates that within hours after the boy went missing their were hundreds of people searching that area on foot and this went on for days. Undoubtedly, individual sleuths and law enforcement scoured the area for weeks and months afterwards. A body in that area would have been found. But Perkins clings to her childhood fantasy that she would be the one to find Andy.

2) Perkins clings to suspects who while evil child victimizers their modus operandi does not fit into a child murder. Chapman liked hurting kids, dead kids do not hurt. His psyche was that he wanted suffering victims.

3) There is no focus on the most obvious suspects of all. The employees of the pool. A lifeguard would be an authority figure to Andy and a trusted mentor. It is not difficult to imagine a cool lifeguard tempting a kid with letting him drive his cool car but he cannot tell anybody. I would try to take a look at who as a young lifeguard working at the pool 30 years later has a criminal record today.

This documentary seems to grasp for solid conclusions but they are just straws. I did like the documentary when I first watched it a couple years ago. But there is no strong suspect and in my opinion no strong reason for law enforcement to be criticized. Someone took off with this kid and probably buried him in his backyard garden. I doubt it had anything to do with any of the suspects shown in the documentary though.",1410134400,4,1683,4.566225165562914
8306643,5,B001GQ3ECI,The documentary is very well made and as a parent it really got you thinking about what and how to talk to your kids about certain things in life. The package was delivered within days from my order.,1361318400,,199,4.2631578947368425

8306645,5,B001GQ3ECI,"Very interesting movie about a missing boy from the projects and one little girl, who was his best friend, continued investigation into the facts. Melanie Perkins was the guest speaker at my daughters college graduation and was talking about perseverance an d doing the right thing. She worked on the local public television office and finally gained approval to make a documentary about Andy Pugliosi, her childhood friend. Very well written and heart-wrenching documentary.",1284336000,,475,5.4324324324324325
8306646,5,B001GQ3ECI,"A great documentary which causes the viewer to truely empathize with the mother of Andy and her pain. Melanie Perkins does not interject her own story into Andy's disappearence and her genuine love and sincerity is felt in the depth and concern she displays throughout the film. This film is a tribute to Andy.

Andy's disappearence is a wake up call to all parents on just how vulnerable our children are to these disgusting, demented, evil, selfish, and cowardly pedophiles who roam about the areas where our children play in order to take them when no one is looking. God bless you Andy.  I wish I could have been there to protect you. I would have beaten those guys to a pulp. Even though there are children out there who continue to be victims, I pray that God protect's them from these walking demons.",1282348800,,807,4.597222222222222
8306647,3,B001GQ3ECI,This story had a lot of potential.  It's the type of story that attracts the interest of most people. The movie was well done but I was a little disappointed that so little time was spent on the results of the documentary. I guess I hoped that there was more of a resolution or at least a hint of a resolution.  Other than that I enjoyed watching it.,1255737600,,350,4.132352941176471
8306648,5,B001GQ3ECI,"I grew up in Lawrence. On the North side, but I knew the area where Andy lived very well. Watching this documentary hit so close to home. Even though I'm older than Andy was, looking back, it could have happened to me. Kids would swim in the city pools during the summer. Me in the Kennedy by Central Catholic and Andy in the Higgins in South Lawrence. We went there to have fun. Little kids having a good time. Not a worry in the world. And to think that men like Wayne Chapman were cruising these pools and the streets of Lawrence looking for their next victim. This DVD is certainly an eye opener and I would highly recommend it to anyone.",1240272000,,642,4.270491803278689
