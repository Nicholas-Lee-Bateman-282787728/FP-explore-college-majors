8289983,4,B001CUAZAW,"If you love period mysteries, this first outing by Mr. Wilder is a delight.  Set during WW II, it follows the exploits of Larry ""Cash"" Carter, a Broadway director who has left the limelight for small town Connecticut to escape a traumatic incident in his past.

When a local bigshot is murdered Cash is asked by detective Lieutenant Tony Rossini (Mike Starr) to help him observe the suspects during his interrogation since Carter's experience in theater has made him an expert on both observation and human psychology.

The made-for-TV film was nominated for an Edgar Award for Best Television Feature of 2000.  This is Wilder in a gentler mode; witty and amusing, rather than zany, and the film is a lovely celebration of the 1940's era.",1336348800,2,738,4.833333333333333
8289984,5,B001CUAZAW,"One of two mysteries Gene Wilder wrote and starred in for A&E, this film is fun, witty, charming, a treasure from the mind of Gene Wilder. Full of light and subtle humor, with wonderful dramatic over- and undertones, Wilder proves that he still has what it takes to entertain and evoke genuine emotional response.

While I am sad that he no longer acts, his recent novellas help ease the sadness, and the Cash Carter mysteries may have been the perfect way for Wilder to gracefully exit the screen and leave us still missing him.

You can't go wrong buying either of these films. Whether you are a fan of Gene Wilder or a fan of good mysteries or both, these are a great addition to a collection or a great gift to give away.",1281484800,4,725,4.402985074626866
