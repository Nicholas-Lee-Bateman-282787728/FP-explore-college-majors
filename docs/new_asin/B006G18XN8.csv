4985442,5,B006G18XN8,"Greetings, Potential Buyers....

I am a strong advocate of early childhood education. I have purchased every baby babble series. My daughter loves this series. When I popped it in yesterday, she was instantly hooked. She communicates with the video and is at total peace. Her communication skills are evolving, where I see she is more confident with the her babble...words like two and toe, daddy and mommy are becoming more constant. She plays until she is exhausted. She ofcourse has numerous toys, a mixture of blocks and shapes.

I recommend this to any parent that has a growing child. I have introduced various speaking and learning dvds for our child...this one she loves the best, without any complaints.  She plays curiously and quietly, while communicating.

The quality of the video in this series also increased. The other series was not bad at all, but you can tell they put additional work in this one...I just heard her say ""da"" for ""D"", with the instructer....simple amazing.

Its important to puchase Babby Babble 1 through 3, allow your child to evolve. Expose them to a set of things and change up when they get frustrated, but not before. Bottom line...My child gives it with my support support 5 stars!",1328572800,12,1223,4.888888888888889
4985443,5,B006G18XN8,"We sampled many of the speech development videos on the market, and Baby Babble series became our favorite. The videos didn't look appealing for adults, but our son was captivated. I can draw parallels to a baby formula, which smells terrible to me, but infants love it. Growing in a bilingual household our son has issues with language development. First two DVDs definitely helped him, so we pre-ordered the 3rd part and waited patiently. He liked it immediately. The structure of this volume is similar to the first two. It covers some slightly more advanced concepts and topics. Speech therapists combine words with visual aids and gestures from American Sign Language. Each small exercise is followed by images of moving toys to keep the attention. Authors eschew classical music found in most of the baby videos in favor of simpler chords. The sounds are calming, after watching the video in the evening our son goes to bed without any fuss.
The much hyped Baby Einstein series does not come close to Baby Bable. It is evident that Baby Babble videos were created by speech professionals and  they deliver results.",1328227200,34,1120,4.925925925925926
4985444,5,B006G18XN8,This whole DVD series helped my son SO much. We knew something was wrong at his first birthday when we saw other one year olds saying words and our son wasn't uttering anything yet. He was just pointing. We started speech therapy and got all three of these dvd's and boy did they help. It got to the point where he came home from daycare everyday and asked to watch these videos. He imitated what he could and started saying more words and sounds. The format just captures their attention so easily and holds it for the entire video.  He's almost three and still asks to watch them once in awhile and we have almost conquered his speech delay.  I recommend them to everyone now and will use them from birth on for future kids.,1490745600,2,726,4.37037037037037

4985446,4,B006G18XN8,"Not as good as the first two but still a household favorite for my 1 and 3 year old.

4985452,5,B006G18XN8,"Buy this for the next baby shower gift! I wish I had it earlier in my daughter's development. It will help you learn some cool techniques to increase your child's speech. You can probably find it at your nearest library if you want a free copy, but I think it is very helpful, so you should check it out. One of the ways that it is useful is that it shows you how to play with your child and their toys. I had all of the toys in the video, but I did not realize some of the strategies that they used. I would buy this as early as for a six month old. I know that sounds very young, but you can start playing with them at that age. Let me know what you think!",1480377600,,658,3.8455882352941178
4985453,5,B006G18XN8,"My son loves these.  We got Baby Babble 2 from a friend and he loved it so much that we got this one.  It did seem to help him start talking earlier - we started showing it to him when he was around 18 months, and he picked up the phrases in Baby Babble 2 and 3 much before he started using other phrases, so it was helpful.  I even learned something, and can use the basic signs (ASL) that they demonstrate, which is neat.",1479686400,,423,3.9529411764705884

He is starting to babble and make more sounds. He is still working on pa sounds but we are watching this 3rd one to give him variety and a head start on future sounds.

We had considered paying $100/mo for Gemiini but I think this is even better bc we watch it daily and they incorporate toys to show concepts like ON or IN",1470441600,,469,4.211111111111111

I can already see after just a couple weeks of watching the Baby Babble videos he is beginning for flourish. First off, he thoroughly enjoys them! Secondly, he will ask for them by name 'baby babble!' He will mimic all of the words and sign language. I have bee very happy with them thus far. We have a ways to go, but I see improvements already, and I have Baby Babble to thank for that!",1465516800,2,540,4.356435643564357

HE really likes and listens to these 3 DVD's that I purchased...most especially if there are no distractions.  And sometimes let's you know he wants to watch them.  He has learned to be patient while the ""info-mercial"" is given in the beginning.  I play all 3 at least once a day.  We've had them for nearly 2 weeks.  At this time...no signs of speech improvement...but I know he's learning/enjoying them.  Most of the sign language he already knew.  I've rated these because of HIS reaction to them!",1462924800,,669,4.64957264957265

4985475,5,B006G18XN8,"I love the Baby Babble Series! This is a wonderful dvd series that really helped my son when we realized that he had a speech delay. My 2 year old was not echoing sounds and words until he started watching these DVDs. We started with Baby Babble 1, then 2 and I was so happy when I saw I could purchase the digital version on amazon. I love having it on my phone so I can show my son whenever he likes. He calls it ""my show"". The DVD is great because it shows how to basically use speech therapy techniques in your home. They use toys that are common, many of which my son had already. I like that the images are low key, not flashy or very fast moving. My son and every other child I have shown this DVD to is completely entranced. They LOVE it! The teaching portion of the DVD is also so very helpful. I enjoyed these DVDs so much and they helped our son so immensely. I also purchased the companion book that is published by the same wonderful ladies. When paired with early intervention and speech therapy, our son is now talking a lot and letting us know what he wants! You will love this DVD!",1459209600,3,1098,4.135514018691588

4985478,5,B006G18XN8,My son is 2 years old and was born prematurely. His speech is a bit delayed and knowing that he will most likely have issues with this in the future I wanted to stay on top of it. Kids don't focus on things for very long but they love toys. This video gets him to pay attention and after about the 3rd time of watching it he was already saying some of the words they were before they ever did. Periodically throughout the video they just show a toy that moves anf has bright colors to give a gentle distraction to the learning. Don't just turn it on and let them have at it either. Watch it with them. Show them your excitement over the video as well. My 2 older children will watch it with him as well and add a good job in here and there. All in all it was well worth it. It's teaching him ways to pronounce letters and words I wouldn't have thought about doing. Thank you.,1456358400,2,875,4.063583815028902

4985486,5,B006G18XN8,"We've used Baby Babble 1 and 2 for the past year for our son.  Our son was diagnosed to be on the mild side of the Autism spectrum.  When we started a year ago, he would only imitate sound effects.  He had no interest in trying to talk, though that also could be a result of his very, very, very talkative older sister that doesn't let him say anything for himself.  But fast forward to 10 months later and he's doing great, though he is now in an ASD program and has a therapist and was going to speech therapy.  I believe it's a combination of everything that is helping him out.  He now tries to say everything, and a lot of time we are surprised with how clear it is.  We play baby babble for him quite often, especially in the car.  He loves it and repeats almost everything that is said.  I know I can contribute some of his improvement to Baby Babble without a doubt.  Anything to keep him interested and wanting to learn and feel comfortable to try.",1451260800,2,957,4.208791208791209

He watched it from beginning to end and when it was over turned to me and said, ""Again! Again!  He even tried repeating almost every word they said in the video (which is NOT like him at all). I almost started crying from joy in watching him watch this video. I don't know why children love it so much, but it is obvious that these people knew what they were doing when they created this.  My son knows a variety of words, but will just not use them consistently and often struggles to enunciate them.  We've had him tested, and he's not delayed enough to qualify for speech therapy services, but I felt like I needed to do something.  I've only had the DVD for one day, but if my son continues to hold interest in it, I will most definitely be buying the other two DVDs in the series.

(5 months ago)  I do think these DVD's helped.  Parents can learn the appropriate way to talk to a child with speech delay, so that they can acquire language easier.  Basically, start talking just like the speech therapists do in the video.  That made all the difference for my son.",1426118400,2,449,4.349397590361446
4985512,5,B006G18XN8,"The baby babble series helped my very shy 3 year old come out of his shell by being more confident in his speech. He went from speaking maybe 5 words, to over 500 in the last 9 months. I bought the series on a hail mary, and a prayer. I thought he may have ASD or something else. Turns out he is just really shy, and wasn't confident in speech. This series was a true life saver for me and my Alex. Thank you so much!!!! If you are a parent of a child that needs help speaking, PLEASE try these. I don't know about babies, but for a 3 year old it is definitely worth it. I started with 1 for him even though it says for certain months, Please don't hesitate. Its not much money in the big picture of things.

Even the parent's portion, the short sign language session and the toy bin section. Note to parent in order to have success you need to be an active participant.  We watch it every night during dinner.  My son has developed the lip and mouth muscles and can repeat new learned words. We have watched all 3 videos since late fall 2014. During that time my son had no words. .. not even mommy or daddy. NOW!  He has a vast of words...colors, shapes, he says help n signs the word help, eat,water, and difficult words like octopus and even tries to pronounce dinosaur.

4985528,5,B006G18XN8,"My twin toddlers were a big fan of Baby Babble and Baby Babble 2.  I actually enjoyed watching and listening to the video as well.  The twins were riveted by the music and phonetics of sound of the two previous Baby Babble videos.  I'm not sure why they deviated from the ""original' formula of music and pronouncing sounds with the third video.  Quite frankly, this video seems to play awkwardly when there is just silence while a toy moves around the screen.  Although my twins seemed interested in the images and repeated the ""t"" sounds that one of the speech therapist demonstrated, they gradually lost interest during the frequent toy display in silence---which quite frankly had no purpose in promoting sound or language.  In the previous videos, toys playing around had a purpose such as a train passing by (with background music) and the narrator repeating word phrases like ""choo choo"" or a ball rolling down to the sound of the narrator saying ""down"" or ""fall down"".  In this video, this teaching narration was minimal as compared to the other videos.  It just seemed weird.  I actually thought something was wrong with my Roku or the video because the lack of sound and music was atypical as compared to the previous videos.  I ended up turning the video off after 10 minutes because it was boring.  The only reason that I gave this video 2 stars was that it did manage to motivate the twins to repeat the words of the speech therapists when they came on screen in the beginning.  Overall, I was disappointed in this video as compared to the previous Baby Babble videos.  This wasn't made with the same quality and care as the previous videos were made.  It didn't even start with an introduction which explains the outline of the video and who the speech therapists are.

UPDATE:  I increased my rating from 2 stars to 5 stars.  One week after purchase, I went back and played the Amazon instant video.  Apparently, when Amazon made the video available online, there was a problem which explains why there wasn't an introduction and music playing in the background.  It works perfectly now and I can see that it is made in the same vein as the two previous videos---which is a huge relief.  The twins enjoy the video.  I'm not sure if it because they are older or if this video is the best of all three, but the twins are more engaged and will pronounce the words that they hear.  Overall, I'm relieved that the problems that I identified in the above paragraph was due to a poor digitalization of the video by Amazon (or whoever) versus the video itself.",1415923200,2,2566,4.618101545253863

He loves watching the other DVDs in the series and can repeat everything the therapists say.  Its funny that he even knows the videos so well that he says the words before the images even come on.

I wish I would have got them when he was born.  They teach you how to help your child speak.  My son has went to speech therapy and the video's do the same thing but better.

She is now 3y3m old and won't stop talking - she still requests watching these videos simply because watching the toys and practicing the language skills are fun - Seriously, one of the best buys we ever made for our daughter!

Former review: We bought this only to find out there is no music or sounds other than the voice of Cory and Amy. The first two held our little guy's  attention, but this one has a too many gaps of toys spinning without music or other sounds. Maybe the instant video version just isn't working right.

I love how it reinforces what we learn from therapy, many of the parent tips are exactly what we were told in our therapy session.  The sign language is an added bonus.  My daughter loves them, is entertained by them when she learns, but also likes to show off when she knows something they show on the video too.

4985581,5,B006G18XN8,"My child has been watching the entire Baby Babble series since he was about a year old. He is 17 months old now and many of his first words (SPEAKING words, not just sign language) have come from watching these videos. Words like baby, daddy, mommy, up, down, out, more, truck, please, thank you, all done, eat, and countless others. The videos are designed to hold the short attention span of young children, and they definitely do. The intervals of music, incorporation of sounds, talking, simple objects, etc. ---all of those are specifically directed toward babies and toddlers. In my opinion, this series is better than Baby Einstein, Brainy Baby, etc. for the older baby/young toddler. It might be ""too educational"" for the really young baby. But, from 9 months to age 2 1/2 or maybe even older, I would say this series is THE BEST out there for speech, learning, and ""quiet time."". The series even focuses on certain letters like p,b, and m or t, d, n which directly coincides with the appropriate level of speech that a child is capable of learning as he/she grows. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE ENTIRE BABY BABLE SERIES (There are 3 in the series.) Oh and as an added benefit, the videos are quite calming for the parents and the creators' approach toward teaching the concepts is actually quite fascinating.  A nice break from some of the ""annoying"" shows and DVDs that are out there for kids. And an overall great way to expose your child to language/learning. One of the best products we invested in during my son's first year and a half of life for sure.",1373932800,,1560,4.6521739130434785

4985587,3,B006G18XN8,"The charm of the Baby Babble videos is the low production values and the high content of close-up speech and sign language.  Babies trying to learn really do pay attention to the enunciation and repetition of simple words.  The videos are mind numbing to an adult but that's because you're not trying to learn how to work your mouth and learn language at the same time.

I'm a fan of the first two DVDs but was a bit disappointed in this one.  The cuts are quicker and the transition effects are more obnoxious.  Editing has become easier in the years since the first volume was published, but more cuts are not necessarily better.  The slow pacing of the first two held my daughter's attention, but this one moves a little too fast. Instead of bubble bear billowing bubbles for 30 seconds, we have a rapid succession of toys without any action that can be followed.

Never thought I would be complaining about pacing in a speech pathology video but parenting does strange things to us all.",1365465600,2,990,4.590909090909091

4985608,5,B006G18XN8,"I have to say, at first glance of these DVD's, I was really worried my son wouldn't want to watch them.  They seem VERY VERY simple and downright bad (my older boys in their teens were making fun of it.  BUT, with my 27 month old son only speaking a few words, and my pediatrician saying that if at 30 months, he's not progressing we need to have him evaluated for delayed speech, of course I was looking for something with good reviews to try.  THESE DVD's HAVE GREAT REVIEWS (WITH A FEW NOT SO GREAT IN BETWEEN), BUT THE GOOD ONES ARE SPOT ON!!

 My son's vocab exploded within 2 weeks of receiving these. He was grunting the syllables for words he KNEW but wouldn't say and he could follow complex instructions, and he could figure out puzzles and locks after a minute or two, so we knew he was pretty smart. Imagine how cool it is to finally be called ""mama""!  I don't know how else to describe how effective these are, but to say that he went from having 10-15 words to an uncountable list!  AND he asks for these DVD's to be played on his own.... not something he does with any of the others. I truly feel like his confidence went up when he found he could mimic the two speech pathologists in the DVD.  THANK YOU CORY AND AMY!!!!!!",1356566400,,1238,4.238297872340426
4985609,1,B006G18XN8,"I have no earthly idea why people are giving this product any stars!!! I could do a better job using the existing toys that my son has, my phone's video camera and PowerPoint. For a video done by speech therapists, it makes no sense - the women barely move their mouths; they barely have any expressions - and the ones that they do have are creepy; and they do not also speak the word when they are signing. The items that they use to demonstrate words are not easy to understand (for ""water"" there is hand using a watering can pouring out fake blue tinted water and flowers in a flowerpot - for a child that doesn't know what ""water"" is, how would they know which item is ""water""? There are so many other ways to demonstrate water - a faucet, the ocean, a lake, a puddle, stream, etc.)

I'm also concerned about the bright, fast-moving graphics and techno music (not kidding) - not only are they inappropriate for young children that really shouldn't be watching much, if any, tv, and some of them flash which i think could cause a seizure in an epileptic. This video is REALLY, REALLY bad!!! I feel like my son might be regressing after having watched it. The supposed ""speech therapists"" that made this should be very embarrassed. The whole thing is really poor, poor quality.

My son is a late talker, but he picked up sign language very quickly at one-year-old using the Baby Signing Time series - highly recommend. The host of Baby Signing Time signs while speaking the words, the words are written on the screen along with cartoon exemplars. There is also quite a bit of video showing real children doing what is being taught. The music is catchy, child-like and along with the cartoons are completely age appropriate. Can't say enough about the Baby Signing Time series. My son asks (by signing) to watch it a few times a day.",1355961600,3,1834,4.537764350453172

She loves this one just as much and has it mostly memorized. She will attempt the word sometimes even before the SLP on the video does! Either that or she signs the words she knows on it.

Parents, you must play with your toddler and not leave it up to the video a lone though. Toddlers learn better through play than through repetition. I have noticed that since I started getting on the floor to play with him, he has learned a lot more. I copy the games we play from the video.

Baby Babble starts the vocabulary, and after the kid portion of the DVD, it gives a great parent tutorial.

Baby Babble 2 Focuses on the P, B, and M sounds, called Bilabial (made with the lips) all in the front of the mouth. (And includes more parent tips)

Baby Babble 3 Focuses on the T, D, and N sounds, called Alveolar sounds, because your tongue touches the bumpy ridge behind your teeth when you say the T, D, And N sounds.

Again great quality DVD, Cory and Amy (the Speech Pathologists who made this series) added new fun toys, and the DVD is made in the same format as the first two. New for this DVD, they Started adding 2-3 word phrases.

My boys focused on it the first time I showed it, and were interacting with this DVD just as they did the first two!

I HIGHLY Recommend this series!!!",1328832000,3,905,4.351190476190476
