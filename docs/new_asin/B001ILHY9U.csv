8311091,5,B001ILHY9U,"This film is a great sequel to Les Ripoux with the same cast and the same sceario - Montmartre and its sleazy side of life. Just a few films have historically lived up to their predecessors and this now joins that ranking, hence the 5 stars. It is full of humour, couleur locale and the acting is very realistic. I have already recommended this film to a number of friends because of its high quality and especially because it stars Philippe Noiret, an acting legend of the French cinema.",1395100800,,488,4.49438202247191
8311092,4,B001ILHY9U,"It's a fabulously funny old comedy.
Though French, it's has a universal appeal.
The only problem is that i failed to see this edition doesn't have English subtitles.
Can't seem to find one that does.",1348704000,,199,4.714285714285714
