5647103,5,B00BM4Q4KS,"You just can't go wrong with the ""Duke"".
Not that I'm partial. I have collected (and cherish) 97% of everything John Wayne has ever made an appearance in. Still searching for the other 3%.",1405728000,2,188,4.5588235294117645
5647104,5,B00BM4Q4KS,This is a movie we have watched three or four times already and plan to continue watching it over again.,1381017600,6,104,4.25
5647105,5,B00BM4Q4KS,The picture and sound is in top class. And what a thrill. John Wayne and sidekick Jim Toney return to Texas after the civil war to experience that carbetbaggers are terrorising  Texas. From here on it's shooting and riding and hiding and breathless suspence. Lovely Ann Rutherford is the lady and heavy Cy Kendall and henchmen Bob Kortman and Yakima Canutt are up to no good. What a powerfull trio of villains. This is simply the best of the best for b-western fans and others who will ride the trail with young John Wayne.,1369612800,8,523,4.5638297872340425

8570686,5,B00BM4Q4KS,"How great to finally see crystal clear versions of some of the early John Wayne westerns on DVD, Olive films have done a wonderful job here, and the quality matches the earlier 6 films put out by Warner Bros. a few years back. Yes, they are expensive with only one film per disc, unlike Warners 3 films per disc, but still worth it for most enthusiasts of the 'Duke'. Just hope Olive can do likewise with the Lone Star films if they can get hold of the original nitrate negatives from UCLA, no one has ever put out mint copies of those. If John Wayne's looking down from his corner of Heaven, I'm sure he'd be happy that someone is making the effort to preserve and make available his early films like this, They called them 'B' movies, but really they are very entertaining, and you can tell in spite of miniscule budgets, a lot of love went into their making, to me, they're 'A' movies for that alone!
Keep it up Olive Films, I'll support you all the way from Australia!",1491523200,,972,4.346153846153846
