8161796,5,B000LE172U,"I'm a little embarrassed to admit it, but I bought this series b/c the art on the box was pretty. You're probably thinking, smooth move dude. You're darn right it was. Rumbling Hearts is great. This is one of the most heartbreaking animes I've ever watched. It is about a group of four friends. just as the main character, Takayuki, and one of the girls, Haruka, start going out Haruka is hit by a bus and is thrown into a coma that lasts for years. After a very long bought with depression and drinking Takayuki's heart is being healed by Haruka's best friend Mitsuki. Mitsuki takes care of him and essentially saves him from a very sad ending. As feelings start to bloom between Mitsuki and Takayuki, Haruka wakes up. What do you do when your first love who you thought was dead and the girl that saved you from misery are both there and ready to be with you forever. Takayuki is thrown into a world of confusion. There's no way for everyone to be happy.

I was very touched by this story and I think it's a must see for any anime fan, of a more mature age. It starts out looking like a high school romance series, but quickly turns into an adult story. About everyday life and learning to live with grief. There is nudity, sex, and a lot of heavy and emotional content. It made this grown man cry. I can't imagine what kind of toll it could take on a tender hearted female. But it ranks up there with the best anime dramas ever! My only complaint is the length. I wish that it had went longer. It's amazing that they were able to develop suck strong characters in the 14 episodes that it ran. This series can be summed up in 1 word very easily...WOW!",1356220800,,1653,4.298076923076923
8161797,5,B000LE172U,"Rumbling Hearts sets out as a pretty regular school romance, punctuated by incursions into comedy and sports drama, featuring a familiar set of character types: the brash girl (Mitsuki), her shy companion (Haruka), the cool guy (Takayuki) and his buddy (Shinji). The series radically shifts gears the moment tragedy hits, and hit it does - big time. Haruka, who has fancied Takayuki for years and only recently started dating him, is involved in a car crash that plunges her into a coma for three years. Tormented by guilt, having been late for a meeting with Haruka when the accident occurred, Takayuki is thrown into a state of deadening depression. Mitsuki (the actual cause of Takayuki's lateness on the fatal day) seeks to shake the young man out of his apathy, and the two soon embark on an angst-ridden affair. The show chronicles the characters' efforts to come to terms with the drastic disruption that has thrown their entire lives into chaos and thwarted their academic and athletic ambitions. In the process, both Takayuki and Mitsuki oscillate between a desire to cling to the past, refusing to endure its irretrievable loss, and a yearning for new horizons. More often than not, they find themselves suspended between the two modalities without any clear sense of direction or purpose. Spectators are encouraged by turns to sympathize with the protagonists and to recognize their responsibility for their ordeal, appreciating their magnanimity one moment, and abhorring their selfishness the next. One of the programme's most effective diegetic traits is its eschewal of linearity in favour of a multidimensional approach that enables the action to move back and forth in time. This strategy serves to foreground the pervasiveness of insoluble tensions across the narrative fabric. In addition, the mutual inextricability of personal and collective destinies is persistently thrown into relief. The incorporation of motifs drawn from mythology and lore into an unsentimental anatomy of eminently contemporary sensibilities concomitantly augments the show's cinematic richness.",1179619200,,2090,5.394495412844036
8161798,4,B000LE172U,"When Volume 2 of Rumbling Hearts ended Akane had just bombshelled everyone's lives by revealing the truth to Haruka about how much time had passed during her coma and of the relationship between Takayuki and Mitsuki. While her heart might have been in the right place after watching all the lies around her sister continue for so long, the actual delivery could have been better. The shock of everything sends Haruka back into a comatose state, but this time you can sense that it's more a defensive mechanism than any actual physical ailment. All of the stress of his conflicted feelings and all the countless hours spent at his job and visiting Haruka and dealing with Mitsuki has finally caught up to Takayuki and he's become deathly ill. All of the character's lives seem to be falling apart. Even the usually upbeat and hopeful Mitsuki senses that her relationship with Takayuki could be at an end and sees no way to compete with Haruka's hold on the guiltridden Takayuki. Mitsuki feels that same guilt. There's no shortage of people that want to take blame for causing Haruka's accident all those years ago. But noone is able to grab onto the present and move on with their life, simply because they are held back by the human time capsule, Haruka. If none of the characters can break free from the past, then they are all doomed to live regretful and unfulfilled lives.

You could sense a mile away that Rumbling Hearts was not a series that was going to have a happy ending, well, at least not a happy ending for all involved. In a love triangle, someone is always, inevitably left out in the end. Not much really went on in this show plot-wise. But do love stories ever have a plot? What love stories truly deal with is strength, committment, and honesty, or the lack thereof. Takayuki is so busy being kind to Haruka that he doesn't realize that he is alienating Mitsuki. In fact, it takes him most of this dvd to even figure out his true feelings for the two girls in his life. But it's great that he cares enough to be conflicted. I would rather see him going through hell trying to know his emotions instead of picking the wrong person and suffering for the rest of his life. This was a great show and is one of the better anime I have seen this year.",1178582400,,2264,4.5085158150851585
