8039990,1,B00067YHVA,"This DVD release is a DISATSTER!!! I was ssoooo disappointed in this purchase; even though I paid next to nothing for it. I can't believe the company would waste even packaging this garbage!!! There were environmental resources wasted on the manufacture of this trash? Not even to mention the environmental consequences of you eventually throwing this thing in a landfill!!!

I wish I could tell you about ""Romance Of A Horse thief"" but the sound and picture were so incredibly bad I couldn't sit through it! ""Port Of New York"" is a disappointing teaser because you can watch the beginning but then the whole thing falls incomprehensibly out of synch; both picture and sound. This only leaves you to heightened exasperation because you will sit through much of the movie before this becomes just way to messed up to tolerate.

Please, please, please do not waste your money, (and more importantly your time), on this "" 2 for 1"" catastrophe. It's just too sad that a Yul Brynner fan would get duped into this trash can filler. Yul deserved better than this!!!! IT DOES NOT DESERVE EVEN ONE STAR!!! Totally beyond belief.",1187568000,,1119,4.822916666666667
8039991,2,B00067YHVA,"I was excited to find this 2-in-1 DVD release as I'm a huge Yul Brynner fan and both of these movies are hard to catch. Port of New York is an excellent film-noir which needs to be seen if only to catch a young, skinny Brynner make his movie debut as a very sinister drug boss. I had to give this 2 stars for the poor DVD quality of the Miracle Pictures release. The audio quality is out of synch by a few seconds in the last 20 minutes of Port of New York, enough to really mess with the story. In Romance of a Horsethief, it is rather muffled and unclear throughout, enough to distract and make following the story a bit difficult. Very disappointing!",1148428800,2,653,4.190476190476191
