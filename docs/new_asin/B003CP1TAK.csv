4109859,5,B003CP1TAK,"Goldhagen's work is elegantly logical, dispassionate, analytical and fact-based . . . resulting in some inarguable conclusions on man's inhumanity to man and how to manage and control and, indeed, stop it.",1303084800,12,205,5.4375
4109860,4,B003CP1TAK,"This is probably one of  the most important documentaries of the last 20 years.  It has just been shown on public TV in America.  After World War II some people had the illusion that the German mass murder of the Jews was some sort of isolated event.  Some people even said ""never again"".  In reality the majority of the world's victims of political mass murder were slaughtered after, not before, the defeat of Nazi Germany.  The biggest center of mass murder after World War II was Mao's China.  Mao even publicly endorsed political mass murder (unlike Hitler or Stalin).  Mao even praised the idea of a nuclear war that would kill most people on the planet as a good idea since it would lead (in his warped mind) to a victory for China.  The grim record of the post World War II world spread death from Rwanda to Cambodia to Serbia in the heart of modern Europe.

Official attitudes to political mass murder today are hardly encouraging.  The government of China has never been subjected to a judicial proceedings like the Nuremberg trials.  Quite the contrary, Mao's successors are now key allies of American big business in the so-called ""New World Order"".  There is a grim lesson here.  Mass murder on a vast scale can be considered acceptable if money is to be made by powerful global forces.

In the Japanese war crimes trials, the greatest Japanese war criminals, the operators of Japan's biological warfare campaign in China, were able to escape justice completely because America wanted their expertise.  Saddam Hussein was assisted in the use of nerve gas against Iranian troops by America.

The truly frightening aspect of all this carnage is the fact that the incentives for genocide in the coming 50 years will far higher than ever before.  The destruction and destabilization of the planet's environment is going to create a bitter competition for limited resources.  Hopefully, reform will prevent this but this is not likely since time is running out.

What you see here is a warning about what's to come, not a series of unfortunate events from the past.

4109870,4,B003CP1TAK,"This documentary is trying to understand or at least try to comprehend the underlying reasons for genocide in our human existence. The complexity and horrors of genocide are basically due to many factors and this documentary tries hard to pinpoint why it happens, but does not totally solve this question. My conclusion from Daniel Johah Goldhagen's documentary is that genocide is basically a systematic mass murder of a particular ethnic group, tribe, religion or culture by a regime in a country where deep seated prejudices have taken precedence over reason; And if a person who carries such deep seated prejudices becomes the leader of a country and they and their actions are not kept in check by the laws or the enforcers of the laws; well you can see what Adolf Hitler and his perpetrators did to those who had dissension against his propaganda and idealism.",1425081600,,866,4.938356164383562
4109871,5,B003CP1TAK,This film is so amazing. Honestly it is crazy how we let innocent people die because of politics. This inspired me so much that it influenced me to study humanitarian law in college. I remember watching this my sophomore year of high school and just thinking that genocide isn't something to just put aside. This documentary really hit home for me.,1413158400,,348,4.721311475409836

4109884,4,B003CP1TAK,"The title says it all. Usually when wars are fought there is a real goal, such as independence or simply defending your nation.

4109891,3,B003CP1TAK,"Thought provoking but one of those pieces where one is left thinking ""what are we supposed to do about it?""  Should the U.S. or (laughing) UN invade a country conducting genocide?  As far as I know Vietnam is the ONLY country that has invaded another (Cambodia) for their conduct of genocide and even then had something to do with Cambodia's incursion into Vietnam also.  Even then Vietnam was heavily condemned by the world community as a whole.  So, clearly there is no world wide solution to any future genocide.  In the annals of human history it has always existed and will continue to exist unabated!",1404086400,,606,4.733333333333333

4109893,5,B003CP1TAK,This is one documentary that is not only worth watching but find the book and read what's been going on in our world with its governments.  You'd never listen to a campaign again.,1402790400,,179,4.424242424242424

4109896,4,B003CP1TAK,"After the horror, the participants are consistently shocked at their inhuman behavior. That is of course the point, human nature is horrible. The absence of other human species speaks to the historical message of man's relentless drive to eliminate his competition for land, food, and mating privileges. War is just the civilized conduct of our genetic predisposition to kill.  Nothing new here...it is as it always was.  We have not evolved, we are victorious over the enemy and are only waiting for the next opportunity to justify our thirst for blood.",1400457600,,554,5.076923076923077
4109897,4,B003CP1TAK,"His interviews with people who have committed mass murders and atrocities prove that they are just like us: People with a strong belief system in what we perceive as immutable truth and willing to act on those perceptions. The step from strong belief to systemic, government approved violence is so easy to cross and, looking back on our crimes, so easy to repaint as a noble endeavor. He completely ignored how we decimated the Indians under the banner of ""Manifest Destiny."" A great lesson on how genocide starts, carries out it's purpose, and rests quietly in the collective consciousness of it's perpetrators.",1399939200,,613,5.019607843137255
4109898,5,B003CP1TAK,"We all know the U.N. has been absolutely ineffective when dealing with genocides. Perhaps you think you cannot make a difference in saving lives, and therefore do nothing. Benign inaction is a choice. A choice that allows millions to be killed. Goldhagen travels to genocide sites around the globe. He interviews murderers, victims, and masterminds of genocide. He also has a great concept of how to stop genocide. I strongly encourage you to watch this, become educated, and recognize you are not absolved until you become involved in stopping genocide.",1398902400,,554,5.166666666666667

4109900,2,B003CP1TAK,As with any demonstration there are multiple layers.  Several narrators get together and put a spin on the Occupy Movement and claim conspiracy theories such as a Communist Agenda. They trivialize what the occupy movement was about and spin tales of conspiracy agendas that are akin to paranoid schizophrenic rants.  They use tangential methods comparing the occupy movement to organized crime and basically spin everything to steer others as pawns into the extremist right wing Agenda and glorify the Nixon era etc.  Thumbs down on this hogwash.  Is a tad amusing to see idiots make fools of themselves by making false claims and angling cameras etc.  Clearly fascist propaganda.,1397520000,,680,5.201834862385321

4109902,5,B003CP1TAK,This is the second time I have viewed this film and it has not lost its impact on this viewer. The subject matter is often swept under the rug in our modern society since there is virtually nothing that can be done about such ferro actions by rogue states but it should not become transparent because ignoring genocide will only lead to more happening around the world.,1394582400,2,369,4.522388059701493
4109903,5,B003CP1TAK,"To me, the interaction between father and son makes this journey worth every minute.  The fact that the father is a holocaust survivor but is able to objectively view his experience is a wonder.  You can see how Daniel became the thought driven intelligent person he is.  I have watched it several times and will more than likely watch it again.  It is that good.",1394064000,5,363,4.538461538461538
4109914,5,B003CP1TAK,To be there with this man and his father as they confront the past was a privilege. I also learned more about the Rwandan and Bosnian conflicts. It has inspired me to learn more about genocide in the 20th century.,1393977600,2,213,4.35
4109915,4,B003CP1TAK,"Daniel Goldhagen is well known in academics. 'Hitler's Willing Executioners' and 'Worse Than War' are examples of his books. To understand his ability to write with such detachment is the essence of this documentary. Far more personal for him to travel to these places of genocide than to be in a research environment. Perhaps a more difficult concept for him to present to viewers . . . his ability as a lecturer is superior to that as a narrator. Meet his father and mentor, a survivor of 'The Holocaust.'

The information and footage is well presented and must evoke the tragedy, the absolute horror of genocide . . . victim and perpetrator. It is beyond the concept of 'mans inhumanity to man.' This addresses all the issues involved that lead to genocide and the inability of the UN to act in a responsible and timely manner. It is reasonably comprehensive and offers possible solutions.

This documentary may seem tedious to some viewer's but it is worth the time to try and understand the realities in life. Take the opportunity of a slower paced presentation to think about the information and what you, as an individual, can offer. Would you choose to be a bystander in these circumstances?

Suggested viewing of an 'education' in genocide available as Amazon instant video (prime eligible):
'Genocide in the First Half of the 20th Century'
'Never Again? Genocide since the Holocaust'
'Genocide: The Horror Continues'
'Genocide from Biblical Times through the Ages'
This series is fast paced and intended to present validated documentation of genocide/mass slaughter/political/military actions and the inevatible consequences without the responsible intervention of the international community. Narrated by Jon Voight.",1392940800,5,1727,5.205035971223022
4109916,4,B003CP1TAK,"The compass of mans violent reasoning stands yet to be stopped. The content is very heavy and not for the light hearted soul. Most of this deals with the explicit meothods trying to gain infromation on why individuals commit innocient murder and how it continues to happen in our world. Sad though the author has , or possibly is still driven to find out why for solutions to help understanding to stop atrocites from continuing. I would again not recommend content for young people.",1391472000,,483,4.761904761904762
4109917,5,B003CP1TAK,"I was amazed at the amount of information I missed before seeing this documentary.

4109919,5,B003CP1TAK,Very well written an amazing commentary on human nature.  Not to be missed by any serious student of history.  Can't recommend too strongly.,1389571200,,140,5.043478260869565
4109920,5,B003CP1TAK,"With respect to genocide, we always say, "" Never again "", but we always say it again and again. The 20th century had many genocidal episodes, with the deaths of millions. But there is no reason to believe the 21st century want have it's share, as we are becoming less civilized as time goes on. Wars without reason often appear to be related to genocide. The why, some believe, is to be blamed on hysteria, fanned by government leaders who have goals. This documentary tries to answer the question. Can it happen in America? The seeds seem to be already planted.",1387843200,,562,4.574257425742574
4109921,3,B003CP1TAK,"I have no issue with what is in this work, only that which is glaringly absent.
Two Genocides have been waged against the Voortrekker Boers. These Afrikaner
people endured concentration camps under the British where men women and children
were systematically imprisoned and starved in conditions that were deplorable and rife with
disease. Tens of thousands went to their deaths in these camps. The survivors are now
being murdered once again in a systematic manner with the ANC led RSA government aiding this effort.",1387670400,,517,5.166666666666667
4109922,5,B003CP1TAK,"Maybe, if more people watched films like this one, the world would start changing.
What could be more important and noble, than try to tell the story of these unspeakable events, try to understand ""how"" and ""why"", and think what if anything can be done?
Of course, even this formidable effort, just touches ""the tip of the iceberg"", but I'm endlessly grateful to Mr. Goldhagen for taking on the subject, and opening eyes, minds  and hearts in process.",1384992000,4,451,4.782051282051282
4109923,1,B003CP1TAK,"The film creator gives a tired and tedious review of the surface of every genocide. No genocide or War can happen without funding. Those entities have names and addresses and the film creator shows his weak character by simply attributing all of this to a flawed human nature---made possible by funding.

Even the current Sudanese struggles are funded by JP Morgan and China Petrol as they back Joseph Kony. Is this really as mysterious as this pseudo intellectual poses or if you give a madman power will he infect others who are downtrodden and disenfranchised to enter into a blood frenzy. Lets not focus on the match or the fuel but instead on the flaw of a percentage of humans to fall into this psychosis.

Do not stand for this as a historical work.",1381190400,4,756,4.634328358208955
4109934,5,B003CP1TAK,"At first I thought this was going to be a self serving documentary and then about 80% into the movie I finally realized his intent.
Bringing his father into the movie was a method of emphasizing empathy for the victims of these massacres or as he put it regarding them as if they were a member of your own family.
This especially true for us in the U.S. who have lived in a protective bubble for all of our lives. That was until 9/11.
The true criminals are those who are consumed by the power given to them through political authority which, for them, justifies their actions in brutally murdering an imaginary foe and innocent victims.

4109936,4,B003CP1TAK,"This is an excellent documentary by one man who has a personal stake in genocide, since he is Jewish and lost members of his family during the Holocaust.

4109937,4,B003CP1TAK,"I'd call this interesting, thought provoking, but informative only to those who have been fully ignorant about the number and locations of genocides in the past decades.

(personal opinion warning)Like so many other documentaries touching on this topic, this one yet again failed to review what happened _before_ the event. What is common among genocides? For example, why not mention that massacres are almost without fail preceded by governmental disarmament of the population? Is it so difficult to reflect on how many fewer would have been killed had they been able to defend themselves?(/pow)

I would have given this 5 stars had it provided slightly more discussion about similarities of the events, not just the killers.",1333497600,,727,5.258620689655173
4109938,2,B003CP1TAK,"To be fair, a reviewer must be inclined to view the entire documentary before writing his review and I did not.  However, this is because the first half of the film was unbearably uninteresting... and Goldhagen has a voice best suited for print.  Goldhagen takes the viewer on a world tour of recent genocide.  But he merely fingers at the surface of these events.  The viewer is left to wonder about much of the context of these atrocities, and their political or social causes.  I've traveled extensively in Cambodia and seen lasting effects of the Khmer Rouge there.  On those travels I wondered how, why, where humans convinced to exterminate their fellow man?  Goldhagen seems to tell us that humans are capable of horrible acts, of inhuman cruelty.  But this is self-evident by the existence of genocide. What is the trigger that leads us into this capability?  How does a Cambodian soldier turn in to a beast who killed infants?  Goldhagen seems well intention but fails short of delivering true insight.  Furthermore, his voice is, well, best suited for print and the first person nature of the documentary comes off as pretentious and conceded, whether it is or not.  Goldhagen would have been better off hiring a proper narrator and taking himself out of the center of the film.",1332460800,3,1288,4.831050228310502
4109939,2,B003CP1TAK,"Based on the documentary description, I was expecting more information on other genocides.  There was a brief description on the Chinese mass murders during the middle of the twentieth centuries and I thought the motives behind the Armenian massacres and Pol Pots regime could have used more description.  I also thought his conclusions, particularly on why people participate as executioners, was too simplistic. There were a lot of interviews with survivors, including the victims, executioners, and politicians.  These interviews were by far the best part of the documentary.  Their messages were heavy and I felt that Goldhagen could have cut his narrative in half and doubled the impact of the documentary.  The video footage and the matter-of-fact tone that the people in the interviews spoke were chilling and provided some really great insight into genocide.  What was disappointing for me was that I felt the narrator, Daniel Goldhagen, was way to visible in the documentary and consequently detracted from the overall message.  His apparent need to be seen really bothered me.  There were too many cuts to him during the interviews where he would be looking blankly at the speaker, or of him walking across a field with children around him.  He came across as self-righteous at times, particularly when he was trying to outline ways to prevent genocide in the future.  After interviews, he would frequently interject some of his own adjective filled thoughts, but what can you say (or add) after a man describes hiding in the forest and watching his sister and her family get hacked to death?  Even when he took his father back to his childhood home in the Ukraine I thought Goldhagen over reached.  While visiting, it became clear that his father was in a different world while thinking about the relatives who had been executed, while Goldhagen tried to make it some sort of picture perfect moment.

Overall, this might be a good introduction to genocide during the last 100 years, but if you are willing to pick up a book, I would recommend a Century of Genocide by Totten and Parsons.  They cover more genocides, providing political context and eyewitness accounts.",1329523200,15,2179,5.0334261838440115
4109940,3,B003CP1TAK,"Genocide happens everyday here in the United States. Abortions happen everyday now paid for by the US Govt. How can a nation that supports genocide go out into the international world and condemn genocide? The US military has killed millions of Iragi children mostly through radiation fallout, yet no one calls it genocide. Those children were innocent, most never born because of heavy deformity. That's genocide. That's mass murder. If the United States is to lead as a nation, other nations against international genocide, we the citizens must set the example by stopping the genocide commited everyday on our soil. What about the genocide commited by white european settlers against the Native Americans and Mexicans? What about the genocide commited by the French in Canada? What about the genocide commited by the Vatican with the Inquisition? What about the genocide commited by the Jesuits all over the world? In the first year of the Jesuits taking over the Inquisition, they tortured and mass murdered 900,000 Christians. Catholics are not christians. This documentary is well done in support of those who have faced extermination in the international world but it does nothing to shed light on the genocide commited in the United States or to expose it.",1324857600,3,1264,5.140776699029126
4109941,4,B003CP1TAK,"The author interviews people who have actually engaged in the killings of genocide. How he keeps his composure is beyond me but he does. He touches on the past of his own family of Jews who were pulled out their homes and executed. He goes to Bosnia, Guatemala, a Holocaust museum. To think that genocide never ended after the second WW is very scary indeed. It can happen to anyone, anywhere if just one person gets others to believe in his ""cause.""

This film should be a HS required viewing film. Maybe, just maybe it will open the eyes of teens as to why killing others is so unforgivable.",1322611200,3,593,4.440366972477064
4109942,5,B003CP1TAK,"This documentary is oddly dispassionate about a subject that questions the very essence of humanity. When I first started watching this film, I wasn't sure if the tone was correct for such a difficult topic. However, I came to realize that the film has to stand back from its subject a little because the film would be unwatchable otherwise. Investigation into genocide can speak for itself - the film did not need dramatics to convey the pain genocide causes. I greatly recommend this documentary.",1320105600,8,498,4.940476190476191
4109943,5,B003CP1TAK,The documentary is very informative and lively presentation of a burning issue of genocide. An eye opener on the subject of genocide. The writer or/and presenter has done a great job. Congratulations !!!,1319414400,4,203,5.181818181818182
8394386,5,B003CP1TAK,"Incredibly done to go along with the book. Though I must say, the novel is better. Which is saying a lot, because I still enjoyed this film. Really useful to introduce people into the world of inhumanity if they really did not know such horrors existed.",1465171200,,253,4.521739130434782
8394387,5,B003CP1TAK,"This film should be shown to university students in political science, philosophy, sociology, psychology and history classes; or, at least, the book should be required reading as part of the curriculum. It would be even better if many American adults would choose to view this film to gain unique perspective into this gruesome topic. As of now, (as I write this in June 2016) when the USA is engaged in one of the most bizarre presidential campaigns I've witnessed in my 50+ years of living in America (and as an American), this film should be a cautionary tale of what far-reaching impacts our political votes have in terms of how the innate character, qualities, and diplomatic skills any future American President and his or her cabinet may affect the entire world. Too often, citizens of countries, especially the wealthy ones, exist in apathy and distraction, seemingly oblivious of and/or lacking empathy for groups targeted for genocide or ""elimination."" That being said, I sign off with a ""Peace"" symbol.",1465084800,,1013,5.035714285714286

8394395,5,B003CP1TAK,"A rather compelling look into the ordinary people involved in acts of mass murder and/or genocide. Whatever causes people to visit their most primal urges with little regard for the probable outcome is sobering indeed. No doubt a tough film to make, a tough message to share and a tough memory to hold on to after the fact.",1448236800,,323,4.586206896551724
