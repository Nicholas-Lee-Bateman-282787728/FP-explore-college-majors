180936,4,1559409002,"A masterpiece of low budget cinema - allegedy an inspiration to David Lynch for Eraserhead and Romero for Night of the Living Dead. I'm not sure if that's true but it certainly has similarities. I totally enjoyed this  film, spooky, wierd and dreamy.",943920000,5,250,4.813953488372093
180937,3,1559409002,"I first saw this film in the early seventies on some late night Creature Features-type of show and was immediately enraptured by its creepy  atmosphere.  Everything about it from Candace Hilligoss' quirky performance  to the ethereal organ music made for a genuinely frightening experience.  In short ""Carnival of Souls"" is a genuine classic.
I just saw  it again last night on Public Broadcasting, if you can believe it, where  they were showing a new print with stereophonic sound and something called  SuperPsychorama.  And while I have always been a fan of technical  improvements in film technology.  SuperPsychorama is definitely NOT an  improvement.  It was like watching a bad acid trip, replete with retinal  trails.  The people responsible for this even tint the film a sickly green  during the parts where Candace ""slips"" back into the deadworld.  What hokum!  The film is much better in its original form without this  blatant gimmick.  I would've given this film 5 stars, otherwise.
I have  heard that this is a ""Director's Cut"" and that there are seven  minutes of additional footage added back in.  I did notice some different  things, and I would love it if someone would put this film out on DVD with  the extra footage.  But PLEASE get rid of the bogus effects!",941328000,3,1279,4.919811320754717

180939,5,1559409002,I saw this movie as a child on a show called Creature Feature back in the mid 70's and I must say it almost did what only one other movie did to me(Night of the Living Dead: the greatest horror movie of all time...That's  a another story).,931910400,2,239,4.085106382978723
180940,3,1559409002,"This movie has retained the feel of the $1.50 budget it must have had, but it does have moments of real creepiness.  There are even a couple of shocks -- the mysterious man who is following her everywhere she goes, the final  scenes in the Carnival.  It has the feverish feel of early Polanski, and  Ms. Hilligoss (Night of the Living Dead) is an unlikely (and passive!)  heroine.",916790400,,380,4.529411764705882
180941,5,1559409002,"It has always been my opinion that horror is an underappreciated genre.  No matter how good the film is, it is pre-labeled ""bad"" and ""trash"" by so-called movie critics, whose job they feel is to  only heighten the movies that fall into either the musical, drama, or  comedic categories.  How sad that such people will miss such a fantastic  film as ""Carnival of Souls.""  It conveys more mood and subtle  atmosphere than almost any film I have ever seen.  The story is intruiging,  and does not give away too much too soon.  Great performances from the  cast, a commanding use of light and film, Carnival of Souls is a chilling  Tour de Force.",914371200,2,642,4.584070796460177

180944,5,1559409002,"Amazing low budget production directed by Herk Harvey who made hundreds of educational films, this being his only foray into commercial work. Depending on who you ask, the budget was all of $17,000 or $30,000. The actors were local amateurs save for Candace Hilligoss who played the main character Mary Henry. Filmed in Lawrence, Kansas, with the Saltair carnival scenes shot in Salt Lake City, Carnival of Souls is a story of creepy horror set squarely into everyday life. The script is eminently quotable, yet not campy, written rather as ordinary people going about everyday life might hold conversation. There's some stilted acting, some off dubbing, some less than stellar scenes, but added together this makes the film play even more off kilter and decidedly weird.

After a drag-racing accident, Mary arrives in town to serve as church organist. Immediately the people around her realize there's *something* about Mary. She's hard, cynical, anti-social yet vulnerable and frightened. Terribly frightened. There's things only she can see, and times she turns invisible to the world around her. Otherworldy powers take hold while she's practicing the organ, turning the sacred into the profane. An organ score serves as the soundtrack, and when placed in context with the script, is incredibly effective.

Mary Henry - is she alive, dead, dreaming, or perhaps in a parallel universe? John Linden (Sidney Berger) the guy across the hall - friend or lecherous foe? Salt of the earth landlady Mrs. Thomas (Frances Feist) - why does her new tenant Mary act so odd? And what/who is that white-faced phantom lurking along the edges of Mary's vision (Herk Harvey)?

The ending scene is said to have inspired other directors of this genre and is truly the stuff of nightmares.

The transfer is crisp and clean, the black and white photography really shines. Considered a cult classic for good reason. No blood, no gore, no big special effects. Simply the chilling uncertainty of an unknown lurking terror.",1499644800,3,2002,5.113149847094801

now given a new 4k scan 1080p HD transfer which does look incredible, the best the film has ever looked actually
and also most of the extras have been carried over from the very old 2000 2 Disc criterion dvd
except for the 83min Directors cut version for some bizarre reason Criterion didn't include it on this new blu-ray reissue
which is tragic
so only the 78min 1:37:1 Theatrical cut has been given a new 4k scan and new 2.0 master mix
all of the extras plus the Deleted scenes have also been given new 1080p transfers aswell.
so if you love carnival of souls and desperatly want to watch the 83min Director cut

I mean, sure, the premise is delightfully creepy and creative, but the acting...my oh my, the acting in this is so terrible, cringing, and over the top that it makes what should be a disturbing, frightening film into more of a comedy, or like it's parodying itself, which was clearly not its intention. The music in this is eerie and cool, but again, the acting just ruins it, and gets very cheesy very quickly. I dunno, I guess I just don't get the hype of this. It's worth watching at least once, but it's beyond me why this has been overblown into a classic when it's so far from that.",1492560000,,700,4.351145038167939

180956,5,1559409002,"An atmospheric opus about a woman who has suffered a great tragedy.  Carnival of Souls reminded me of Ambrose Bierce's ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge.""  Although this 1960s movie is available in many public domain versions, the Criterion Collection version is the ultimate culmination in the presentation of this memorable piece of cinema.  The black & white cinematography is impressive as are the stunning settings. ""Carnival of Souls"" qualifies as a rather creepy, psychological, low-budget chiller that doesn't rely on conspicuous artifice other than the cosmetic variety to achieve its ends. Less functions as more in freshman director Herk Harvey's one and only theatrical feature. This is not the kind of horror movie that will keep you awake at night with the lights on and a crucifix in your fist. Ostensibly, the story deals with a young, single woman who appears to be the soul survivor of an automobile accident on a bridge. She is riding in one car with two other girls when another car nudges them during a game of chicken. The two guys in the other car watch in surprise as the vehicle plunges off the bridge and crashes into a river. Miraculously, our heroine Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) emerges from a muddy river and decides to leave town. She is a gifted organist and takes a job as organist at an out-of-town church. She rents a room at a boarding house run by a little, old lady. Later, she meets an obnoxious warehouse laborer, John Linden (Sidney Berger), who takes an immediate interest in her that she doesn't reciprocate.

As it turns out, Mary is more secular than religious. She takes the job for the money that she can make. When the minister (Art Ellison) catches her playing sacrilegious tunes on the organ, he gives her the boot. The next thing you know, Mary accompanies Linden on a date out to juke joint. The date concludes with Mary abandoning Linden. Wherever Mary goes, she winds up seeing either cadaverous people or walking among people who are sealed off in another world. Briefly, a well-intentioned physician, Dr. Samuel (Stan Levitt) struggles to help Mary with no success. Naturally, nobody around her can figure out what Mary's problem is. Harvey concludes this enigmatic outing with rescue workers excavating the automobile in which Mary rode from the river. She is as lifeless as her two companions.

""Carnival of Souls"" takes advantage of several interesting locations, principally Saltair Amusement Park, near, Magna, Utah. Indeed, this sumptuous setting does for this movie what the Overlook Hotel did for Stanley Kubrick's chiller ""The Shining."" Although the wooden performances don't bolster this evocative, haunting movie, ""Carnival of Souls"" is difficult to take your eyes off. Maurice Prather's plain but fresh black & white photography is stimulating stuff. Prather and Harvey make this little, 78-minute opus look hypnotic with a variety of intriguing camera angles that enhance scenarist John Clifford's Spartan screenplay. The downbeat ending and the dearth of exposition sabotage what is otherwise an interesting, almost poetic film. You will have to decide if everything that happens between the time the car falls into the river and the workers pull it out as the last thoughts caroming around inside the heroine's skull.",1483488000,,3291,5.087037037037037

180967,4,1559409002,Carnival of souls is a very good 50s horror film shot in gorgeous black and white. It has some terrifically eerie and frightening imagery and scenes especially in the last 10 minutes. Definitely stick around for the entire film. Some of it can be a little difficult to fully understand and there's some moments of odd ADR that doesn't match the actual dialogue but those are minor in the grand scheme. This film obviously influenced Romeo's masterpiece Night of the living dead and Tim Burton's classic Beetlejuice along with others. This is a very worthy and scary horror film and Criterion's blu ray is outstanding. I blind bought this which I don't do often and it was well worth it.,1472860800,2,686,4.725

180973,4,1559409002,"""Carnival of Souls""(1962) is directed by Herk Harvey. This is a film about a woman who survives a car crash, but who is then haunted by a strange apparition. This was Harvey's one and only feature film, which was filmed on a shoestring budget. David Lynch admired this black and white film with its stiff, odd acting and strange haunting feel. This film also reminds one of Alain Resnais' 1961 film ""Last Year at Marienbad"" with its statue like actors and haunting interiors.

This blu-ray set has a number of interesting special features, including deleted scenes, outtakes, a locations documentary, a video essay by film critic David Cairns, an interview with writer Dana Gould, excerpts from some of Harvey's industrial films, a history of the Saltair Resort in Salt Lake City where much of the film took place, and an essay by writer Kier-La Janisse. As always Criterion does a great job restoring the film. My only complaint is that Criterion didn't include the director's cut which was about 7 minutes longer. Evidently they didn't do so because the added footage was inferior (lower resolution) to the rest of the film. This version is 78 minutes in length.",1469491200,5,1164,4.878787878787879

180976,5,1559409002,"One of the all time great cult films. Not for everyone's taste but a true work of art that still fascinates countless fans. This Criterion Blu-ray shows the 35mm black & white film transfer in razor sharp clarity and beautiful sound. The last time I watched ""Carnival"" it occurred to me that the organ soundtrack is perfect not only because Mary is an organist and organ music is traditional for funerals, but also because the Saltair carnival building that she is drawn to had its heyday back in the 1920's when movies were silent and usually accompanied by an organ. So it's like the movie itself is straddling between the silent movie days with organ music, and the present with dialogue and other sounds. I think when the sound doesn't quite sync up, it makes the film seem like a weird dream, or perhaps part of Mary's strange fractured hallucinations. The interpretations are endless, which I believe makes the movie so fascinating to so many people. A true masterpiece. Highest recommendation.",1468972800,18,1000,4.853801169590644

180978,5,1559409002,"Carnival of Souls,"" made in 1962 by Herk Harvey, this low-budget black-and-white movie has garnered a cult following over the years from late-night TV broadcasts and its availability  usually in sub-par prints  on home video. The Criterion Collection release has given the film a technological dusting off, and it never looked better.

Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) is driving to a job as church organist when her car hurtles off a rural bridge into the muddy river below. Searchers believe there are no survivors when Mary emerges from the river, soaking wet and dazed. She has no memory of what happened and just wants to go on her way. But periodically and with increasing frequency, she is haunted by ghostly visions and mysteriously drawn to an abandoned carnival pavilion.

Director Harvey builds tension and makes mundane places look creepy and foreboding. The carnival sequences, in particular, suggest menace because of the settings disrepair and remoteness. Its unsettling to see a place that was once the hub of fun and happiness loom nightmarishly, with shadows seeming to close in claustrophobically. Hilligoss pretty much carries the film as her Mary tries to understand why she feels increasingly detached. As we see events unfold through her eyes, we are just as disoriented, just as rudderless, and eager to discover why Mary is burdened with unexplained fear and paranoia.

Bonus features on the Blu-ray release include selected-scene audio commentary by director Herk Harvey and screenwriter John Clifford; new video essay by film critic David Cairns; The Movie That Wouldnt Die, a documentary on the 1989 reunion of the films cast and crew; The Carnival Tour, a 2000 update on the films locations; deleted scenes; outtakes; and a history of the Saltair Resort in Salt Lake City, where key scenes in the film were shot.",1468627200,2,1839,5.137123745819398

180983,3,1559409002,"A solidly entertaining and, at times, pretty creepy supernatural horror film which doubles as a psychiatric character study. After surviving a car wreck, Mary, an aloof organist, is haunted by repeated visions of a man who seems to be pursuing her. She becomes increasingly distressed, and eventually seeks answers in a nearby abandoned carnival which she feels strangely drawn to.

For an older horror film, Carnival of Souls really does have some surprisingly effective and unsettling moments and has a lot of things going for it. It has a nice, creepy organ score, simple yet effective ghoul makeup, memorable locations like the abandoned carnival, and most off all, a warped and dream-like atmosphere. The best and most memorable sequences in the film really draw you in to Mary's troubled mind and make you feel like you're living in her confused version of reality.

Mary reminds me quite a bit of the schizophrenic protagonist in Roman Polanski's Repulsion as well as a bit of Scarlett Johansson in Under the Skin. She's attractive and seems put-together, but has an icy, distant quality and doesn't relate well to others. Although by the end of the film it becomes clear that the story is supernatural in nature, part of what I really liked about it is that much of the film also works as a portrayal of a first-break psychosis. Mary's character fits some criteria for schizoid personality disorder in that she is pathologically unable to connect with others, and furthermore lacks any interest in forming relationships. Individuals with schizoid personality disorder can have brief psychotic episodes, which are essentially defined by losing touch with reality and frequently involve hallucinations. Psychotic episodes are also commonly brought on by extreme stress, so given her recent near-death experience the pieces really do fit together nicely to explain her symptoms from a psychiatric standpoint.

In addition to the positives, there were definitely some things that brought this film down for me, the most distracting of which was probably the acting. Some of the dialogue scenes in this movie just feel so incredibly wooden. There are many instances when the characters feel like they are simply reciting their lines rather than actually having a conversation with one another. I guess you could kind of forgive Mary seeing as her character is meant to be aloof and awkward, but really no one in the film was any better and it often broke the immersion. And speaking of immersion-breaking, wow they really didn't even attempt to make it appear like Mary was actually playing the organ. Her hands don't come even remotely close to matching the music that she is supposedly playing and it's pretty distracting. Maybe it's just me though - it's a pretty big pet peeve.

Part of me feels like this movie would have been even better if it was a silent film that was completely backed by the great organ music. They honestly wouldn't have to change much of the story at all. The best scenes in the movie are already long, hallucinatory, organ-backed, dialogue-lacking sequences. If it had just cut down completely on the immersion-breaking dialogue and went fully avant-garde with it, the movie could've really, really shined. Regardless, Carnival of Souls was definitely a solid and creepy horror film and it's worth the watch for sure, just be ready to cringe a few times between the best parts.",1463702400,,3410,5.040780141843972
180984,5,1559409002,"One of the most nightmarish visions ever put to celluloid, and very nicely paced.  Due to the fact that it was made on the (very) cheap, but by a very experienced educational / industrial film-maker, the direction and photography are superb.

180987,3,1559409002,"I didn't really know much CARNIVAL OF SOULS, other than that it was a low-budget horror movie with a cult fan-base. What I got was certainly interesting, but hardly a masterpiece. The story is probably the weakest element, as the characters don't really have any depth or personality, and the plot is paper-thin. It's still a compelling watch, though, due to the atmosphere created by a creepy organ score and some excellent cinematography. So, it succeeds as a mood-piece even while failing at the narrative level. The story is about a woman who survives a car wreck and then takes a job as a church organist in Utah. When she moves into town, she starts seeing a ghostly figure and is strangely drawn to an abandoned carnival. This basically sets the stage for a series of sequences where she hallucinates a lot and starts questioning her sanity, as do the people she encounters. There were also a few scenes which kind of tap into human fascination with religion and the supernatural. She sees herself as a rational person, only taking the organist position for the money, but the things she sees bring her into conflict with herself and others. Ultimately, though, the film is mostly about the creepy atmosphere and imagery, which are quite good. One scene I liked in particular took place in the church. She starts off playing out of her organ music book, but then transitions into carnival-esque music, almost as if in a trance. There was also a lot of good on-location shooting. For a film with such a low budget, it looked fairly decent. The only real complaint I have outside of the thin story was that the sound mix was muddled in places, making dialogue hard to hear. Ultimately, CARNIVAL OF SOULS, is an intriguing curiosity which, despite lacking in terms of story, has some cool visuals and a suitably unnerving score.",1458864000,,1832,4.764150943396227

180997,4,1559409002,"Released in 1962, Carnival of Souls stars Candace Hilligoss as a young woman who survives a vehicle accident in Lawrence, Kansas, and then is troubled by a specter (director Herk Harvey) and other strange occurrences as she moves to the Great Salt Lake area for a gig as a church organist.

This is an eerie, moody  cult flick, but not scary at all. Its similar in vibe to 1961s Night Tide with Dennis Hopper. The creepiest part is the girls lecherous neighbor in Utah (Sidney Berger). Besides the haunting ambiance, what I like best about it is the portrayal of two intersecting dimensions: Someone in the spiritual dimension cant be seen or (for the most part) heard in the physical realm. While it's overrated and predictable, it's still an interesting ghostly period piece.

Shot in B&W, the movie runs 84 minutes and was shot in Lawrence, Kansas and Magna, Great Salt Lake & Salt Lake City, Utah.

181002,5,1559409002,"Regarded today as a landmark in psychological horror, this eerie classic 1962 thriller has been digitally re-mastered and pristinely restored. CARNIVAL OF SOULS, which originally was part of a drive-in double-bill with 1961's THE DEVIL'S MESSENGER, was using innovative breakthroughs in horror imagery without even realizing it at the time. The looming, now-iconic ""The Man"" character portrayed ghoulishly by co-writer/director Herk Harvey himself, could prove the quintessential predecessor to Julian Beck's Kane from the POLTERGEIST motion picture series, and the scene in which the malevolent undead slowly emerge from a lake -eyes open- to determinedly walk slowly onto the shore, has surely inspired FRIDAY THE 13TH's Jason Voorhees! One also cannot overlook our film's central plotline of the afterlife trying to reclaim a soul that was destined theirs, and clearly see that this same hook became the main impetus of the entire FINAL DESTINATION horror/mystery film franchise.  CARNIVAL OF SOULS looks and sounds better than ever, and though it was the only feature film that Herk Harvey ever worked on, it has garnered a cult following that shall have it living on in infamy alongside such stalwarts as NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, THE TERROR and DEMENTIA 13, among others.",1429401600,,1277,5.385

181018,2,1559409002,"Herk Harvey's Carnival of Souls is a film that deserves a once-over from any fan of atmospheric horror; while it falls short of any kind of technical or artistic achievement, it does manage to create a very unsettling mood. At least for one viewing. The issue with atmospheric horror is that it is by far the most difficult kind of horror to do well, because, in order for it to be effective, the audience has to always be fully immersed in the world of the film. The moment something happens to take the viewer out of that world, the whole premise falls flat on its face. While the score and the cinematography do manage to be quite unsettling at times, the film simply has too many flaws to be as effective as it wants to be.

As this is a B-Movie, one doesn't go in expecting Shakespearean acting, but one also expects to be engaged. Candace Hilligoss has a few moments of facial acting that convey the confusion that the character is experiencing, but for the most part she has nothing to say or do for a good deal of the run-time. This results in a protagonist who we never really learn anything substantial about, and thus is not engaging to watch. I understand that the film uses long periods of silence to try to draw the audience into an uncomfortable environment, but it just isn't nearly effective enough to justify how often this is done, especially when the same tactic has been done so well elsewhere. David Lynch has admitted that this film helped influence his style, and Eraserhead is a prime example of another film, made at an even lower budget, that does the same things Carnival of Souls tries to do, only with better results.

Many people complain about the score. Every piece of music in this film is performed on a pipe organ, and the score is very nearly wall-to-wall. At first, this is very ominous, with minor keys swirling, and notes bleeding into one another. After a half-hour however, the constant, grating music does less to build tension, and more to make the viewer consider putting the film on mute, if only to get a break. The film at least tries to justify this choice, having the main character be a church organist, but there are only a few scenes where she is actually playing the organ, and the rest of the music comes off as gratuitous. The mood would have been better served by a minimalist score throughout, with the few church scenes being the only times that organ music was used.

The cinematography is one of the few things about this film that I feel comfortable genuinely praising; there are so many odd, uncomfortable, and downright creative shots littered throughout Carnival of Souls that I wonder why the cinematographer, Maurice Prather, never went on to do anything more in the world of feature film. The man knew how to properly frame a shot, and he would do so from angles that could tell stories all their own. If there is any reason why this film should be preserved and viewed to this day, it's to educate aspiring filmmakers on how to not only set up a shot to capture the actors, but how to do so dynamically.

The story is almost non-existent; a woman is involved in a car crash, and afterward decides to leave her life behind to start fresh in a new town. Her journey crosses her path with a strange, ghoulish figure, and several odd characters who serve no purpose beyond padding the run-time. She goes to a boarding house where she meets the landlady and a weird tenant, only to leave without either of them contributing to her overall story or character arc. She gets a job playing the organ at a church, only to be fired a few scenes later for not playing church-ordained music. She visits a psychiatrist, only for him to not exist and actually be the ghoulish man from before. It's less a plot or story, and more a series of loosely connected events that happen in a certain order. Add on top of that a ""twist ending"" that 90% of viewers will be able to guess by the time the opening credits roll, and you have a film that should be lauded for its boundless ambition, and praised for a few redeeming qualities, but worth little more than a single viewing.

Which is why this Criterion Collection release baffles me to no end. On the one hand, this is the best print available, and Criterion certainly has worse films in its library (Armageddon). On the other, Criterion releases are generally priced anywhere from $10-25 higher that ordinary DVDs, this one being no exception. This is do to the great lengths the company goes to in order to distribute the best possible versions of classic and modern films. Here, for the same price you pay for Criterion's releases of films such as Godzilla, Charade, and Breathless, you get a movie that is worth watching in its entirety once, maybe twice. At best, this deserved a release under Criterion's ""Essential Arthouse"" banner, which generally retail for anywhere between $14.99-$19.99. If you really must own this on DVD, I'd personally recommend the Rifftrax edition. It sells for $9.95, contains both the original audio track, in addition to one featuring a comedic commentary by MST3K veterans Mike Nelson, Kevin Murphy, and Bill Corbett, and while the print hasn't gone through the meticulous Criterion restoration process, it's only slightly lower quality. The only things you really lose are the bevy of special features, and the theatrical cut of the film, which shaves ten minutes off the run-time.",1400371200,3,5421,4.654488517745302

The story moves along quickly, the intrigue growing with each scene. It is mysterious and dark, like a haunting nightmare. There are no surprise answers, no silly explanations of the events that unfold. Rather, the writer and producer - brilliantly, in my opinion - leave interpretation to the viewer's imagination.

Whereas most movies are a story in search of a setting, this one was inspired entirely by the location in which the main parts of the film were shot. The plot - well, it just fit into the scenery. And what a perfect fit! What a magnificent backdrop! What a truly amazing viewing experience! (I've watched it at least 40 times and still counting.)

Unlike other editions of this cult classic, the video on the Criterion version is as clear is if they'd shot the black and white just yesterday. The accompanying features are fascinating and well worth buying. How did the actors get picked?. Who exactly are they? What are they doing now? You get all that and more. Maybe the same irony will impress others. A couple of seasoned actors appear in the film, and yet the unknowns seem the better in their parts. And the story of the film's making is nothing less than engrossing.

The film's gloominess and sense of disconnectedness disappears with the splashy colors. Listening to Mike Nelson's running commentary was even worse, and not because I ""worship"" the original.

A remarkable first-and-only motion picture from industrial short director Herk Harvey (who also cameos as the undead man). This one's cult status seems to grow with each passing year. A must see!

181037,5,1559409002,"Carnival of Souls(1962) is a solid, surreal, low budget horror movie filmed in black and white. It was not a big hit in 1962, but late night TV airings helped the film reach cult status. Everything from The Sixth Sense(1999) to The Frighteners(1996) borrowed ideas from this movie. Carnival of Souls was directed by Herk Harvey. He made dozens of educational shorts for Centron. In Carnival of Souls, Mary Henry(Candace Hilligoss) survives a nasty car accident caused by some reckless drag racers! She moves to Utah and gets a job as a church organ player. Mary can see pale ghosts walking around. There are moments where people ignore her. Director Herk Harvey plays a ghost known as ""The Man"". Sidney Berger plays John Linden, an oily, charismatic guy who is attracted to Mary. Carnival of Souls is a creepy, atmospheric horror film that's low on violence. It feels ""dream like"" at times. It has an organ driven music score. Carnival of Souls was made with good taste and it's tame enough to show on TV. Filmmakers such as David Lynch and George Romero are fans of this film. A ""remake"" of Carnival of Souls was made in 1998 and it went straight to home video. The remake starred Bobby Phillips from The X-Files and Stargate SG-1. Some people have pointed out that Carnival of Souls feels like a Twilight Zone episode. I guess that's true. Candace Hilligoss is decent as Mary Henry. She was a really good looking B-movie starlet. Hilligoss looks lovely as she sees ""The Man"" staring at her from the first floor of a staircase. I first saw Carnival of Souls on a Netflix rental in 2005. Since then, it's been one of my favorite movies. Carnival of Souls is a classic film.",1352073600,3,1673,4.655405405405405

the special features on both dvds are numerous and as a true fan of this film i enjoyed them. this movie is one-of-a kind and finally getting praise it well deserves. its unfortunate that the distribution company did a poor job in 1962 as herk harvey wd have been financially able2 continue making films.

181041,5,1559409002,"Gorgeous blond woman drives off a bridge with her friends into the river.
She somehow walks out of the water, even though her three friends drowned.
A series of very strange happenings begin, including seeing a ghoulish face
suddenly in front of her at odd times.

A huge abandoned carnival pavilion figures prominently in this as well as an old boarding house where she rents a room.  The one other tenant turns out to be the biggest creep in the world, leering, sneering and pushing himself on her constantly.  That guy alone made my skin crawl.  No one in the history of the movies has ever portrayed a slimey creep better.

Pipe organs also are an important element, as the lady is a professional organist.  She suddenly is compelled to stop playing church music and begins to play scarey horror movie music on the church organ which causes the preacher to fire her with a stern lecture on playing the wrong kind of music.

Every character in this movie is spooky in a very natural way, vaguely reminding me of every creepy old or young guy I ever met.  The yucky old men lecture her sternly, feeling like they must let her know they are superior morally, including a doctor who wants to ""help"" her by playing her psychiatrist.
The young sleazeball in the room across from her is manipulating for all he's worth, saying ""you must not like me very much"", ""you're very cold, you must not like men"", ""this room of yours is very lonely at night, I'd be happy to keep you company"", and on and on, leering, peeking at her through the door, showing up unexpectedly, bringing her coffee as soon as he hears her alarm go off in the morning, and totally pushing himself on her unmercifully.
He is a perfect charicature of a creep, finally running away saying ""I don't need to get mixed up with a crazy lunatic like you"".

And then there's that ghoulish face appearing suddenly, looking through her window.
I had at least four instances of goosebumps, the hairs on my arms standing on end, as I watched this.  I can't remember when a movie did that to me.
This movie was written with not only an astute concept of what may happen after death, but also with an accurate portrayal of some types of characters that can be found in the real world that make a girl's skin crawl.
One of the most genuinely horrifying movies I've ever seen.  The setting, mood and atmosphere are guaranteed to give you chills.",1329523200,7,2395,4.533642691415313

181043,5,1559409002,"What is the going rate for cheap thrills? Carnival of Souls is arguably the first atmospheric, nightmare inducing, B horror movie. In the current times the only thing about this genre that remains terrifying is the sheer number of films coming out that rip off Carnival of Souls.  Yes you can pretty much find a Carnival of Souls knockoff in every bargain bin from Haddonfield, Illinois to Crystal Lake. If you have ever watched late night television you have watched this movie. It is a late night creepy staple.  Many famous directors weren't just inspired by this movie, they straight up stole ideas from it. The Gothic style, the creepy organ soundtrack, and the straight to the point low budget esthetic. All of these elements mixed with an old fashion country side creepiness come to together to form a classic horror film. Sometimes for many strange reasons things just happen to go intensely right. Carnival of Souls is absolutely one of those times. It came out in 1962 and is still spawning imitators. Don't go watch this film just go take a nap and have a nightmare: Its the same darn thing.

Mary Henry: It's funny... the world is so different in the daylight. In the dark, your fantasies get so out of hand. But in the daylight everything falls back into place again.",1325289600,4,1280,4.705357142857143

I loved ""Saltair"" which featured prominently in the movie as the Carnival and former dance hall. They don't make places like that anymore and that is a real horror.
Perfect for Halloween.",1319500800,3,349,4.46875
181046,5,1559409002,"Unconventional intro with no credits, jumps right into the action: the drag race down industrial America's early dirt roads, the old bridge, and the spooky music and ""Carnival of Souls"" opening title card. Beautiful. Wondrous early scenes of organ-ism with the reverend who looks like Al Gore, and the prophetic words ""Thank you, but I'm never coming back."" On the road, cheerful music turns to spooky organ music, the beautiful driver turns on a light to illuminate herself (something no driver would ever do), and then sees her first scary apparitions. Settlin' in at her new home, then sexxee bath scenes. The scene with the lecherous neighbour in the boarding house is practically scarier than the real fright-scenes. Scary wallpaper. ""I don't sleep so good as it is."" The landlady, a bit of a creep herself, brings up sandwiches for dinner with coffee. ""Coffee never keeps me awake."" And then we see her lying awake. And flirting with the lecherous/dimwitted neighbour. She slips into a negligee for some surreal shopping, and then down an escalator (symbolic) to check out the blissful netherworlds. Wandering around the spooky, deserted Saltair that she's oddly attracted to/repulsed by on a bright afternoon, taking in the amazing old architecture and space--tunnels, boardwalks with shadows coming through slated ceiling, a billboard woman that looks like her, so many beautiful screen captured. Great shadow-in-doorway photography, walking though the long shadows of the old dance floor in disarray and ruin, a solitary old space on the waterfront, Betty Blue with only Betty and no Zorg. Crazy dirge, 1920s dancers, morning turns to night, scary organ music. ""Your lack of soul.""

  - I hope she does leave.
  - I hope she can.

In some ways the film has some really bad acting, terrible dialogue delivery. ""But my dear... you cannot live in isolation from the human race, you know!"" But who cares--Candace Hildigloss (what a name!) is stunning in a glamorous 50s girl-next-door sort of way.

The amazing Saltair pavilion, which was in disrepair even in 1962 when the film was made, was in many ways the ideal location for a film like this--it had been built in 1893, but had been closed in the late 1950s (even after several resurrections). It is practically the star of the film itself.  Saltair once had the world's largest indoor dance floor, capable of supporting 2,000 dancing couples and two orchestras. The lake receded, then it flooded. Saltair burned to the ground twice.

With so many scenes that show parked cars, driving, racing, in-car shots, going into the auto shop, the car is very central to the movie. There some great, spacious interior shots and you really have to wonder how they captured them. Sinister voice says ""eastbound bus now loading, Gate Nine."" Eastbound, like over the river Jordan? ""Why can't anybody hear me?"" as she runs through the town. Can hear her own footsteps and the organ, but nothing else, until the birds chirp, and then the nightmare is over. Scary ghost dances with she, herself. Early Goths. She blends with herself at the end. The psychiatrist and the cleric give each other a deep meaningful look.

The Criterion Collection version comes in two versions: the 78-minute theatrical release, and an 83-minute director's cutcomes with gorgeous extras:

- a 39-minute reel of outtakes
- a 28-minute documentary on the film done by a Kansas TV station
- a sideshow that included the instructional ""Saltair: A History of Isolation"" and ""Saltair photo gallery."" These demonstrate Saltair through the ages, going from a 1892 architectural drawing, through the glory days in the 1920s when it brought in 500,000 people a year, down to the decay of the early 1960s. ""Three hundred tons of steel girders supported the large dome, which was similar in size and shape to the Mormon Church's Tabernacle on Salt Lake City's Temple Square."" After many ups and downs, the place burned to the ground in November, 1970. There is both a timeline-slideshow that includes postcards from all ages of Saltair and a regular slideshow of pictures, mainly of the 1920s heyday, when the lake was full of revellers.
- samples of Herk Harvey's Centron Films documentaries ""Star 34', ""Centron Commercial"", ""Signals: Read `em or Weep"", ""To Touch A Child"", ""Jamaica, Haiti and the Lesser Antilles"" and ""Korea: Overview.""
- a 4:42 minute documentary from KTWU Channel II called ""The Carnival Tour"" that showed where the film was made, which was mainly in Lawrence, Kansas. The intersection at 23rd and Iowa is now the area where the drag race started. Dirt roads have been paved to become Clinton Parkway, and the Lacompton Bridge, where the car dropped into the Iowa river, has been rebuilt. The Reuter Organ Company where there were some organ-playing centre is in Lawrence, and many of the rooms there had not changed at the time the news report was filmed. The boarding house the Mary Henry character stayed at is at 6th and Louisiana, and so is the exterior is used.

181048,4,1559409002,"I saw this at least 45 years ago and was so horrified that it stuck in my mind like a nightmare.  I have literally not seen it since then and was anticipating seeing it with great delight.  I can say without reservation that this is one of the best b-horror films that I have ever seen:  the actors are unknowns and often not that good, but there is a consistent mood of terror and morbid curiosity throughout.

An inhibited girl is in a accident that occurred while recklessly racing boys.  Somehow, after 3 hours submerged, she appears to the astonishment of the cops who are looking for the car.  From the get-go,  she senses that something is wrong, but decides to go to a new job across the country without visiting her parents first.  On the way, she starts seeing things, in particular a recognizable face.  Upon arrival, she feels this terrible unease, the whole place seems alien and almost threatening.  She meets a lively, somewhat drunken boy who rooms across the hall, a kind of connection to life that she feels is vital yet cannot accept.  Their alienation, after a brief mating dance, is very sad.

Strange things keep happening.  She develops a fascination with an abandoned amusement park, which she feels compelled to explore alone.  After a strange interlude where she appears to no longer exist - no one can hear or see her - she meets a stiff psychotherapists who tries to help but asks the wrong questions.  He concludes that she is ""unusually strong willed"".

She is a church organist on her first job.  Her music forms an integral part of the horrific atmospherics of the film, indeed she loses control and improvises a bizarre tune with swirling, uncontrolled hands as images of dancing corpses - so similar to the tubercular melancholy of Munch's Nordic paintings - overwhelm her.  I have seen this image in my nightmares ever since.  Her soulless music disturbs the priest who hired her:  he is the other moral pole opposite the psychotherapist.  As she begins to accept that she doesn't belong in the town, the menacing otherworlders began to appear in full daylight, at times she has fleeting visions or herself among them.  It bores straight into the viewers subconscious fear of the mysteries of death.  I will not reveal the ending.

181051,4,1559409002,"7.6.10-The Carnival of Souls opened with a sort of one on one drag race between the sexes, which led to a serious car accident. The large piano organ set shown was very nice. The set of the carnival was amazing. Mr. Lindon was an annoying, pushy creeper. His excuse was funny. He didn't want to eat alone. You think he would be used to it by now. Mary only accepted his presence because she needed a distraction from the nightmares and images she sees. My favorite scene is when she starts playing carnival music in the church and the souls of the carnival begin to dance. In my opinion music is music regardless of church affiliation or not, but this scene surfaced significant conflict with the priest that was already there.  It is weird how the character is traveling alone when she does not want to be alone. Then I see it is a process Mary goes through in realizing she is dead. Therefore some see her, and some don't. Those she meets, she can tell them nothing about herself. It seems like the priest knew more about the old carnival arena than led to believe. He steered clear of it. This horror film is good in that it comes together in the end to reveal the passage of death and the anxiety of dying alone and being afraid of it.",1284940800,3,1239,4.363636363636363
181052,4,1559409002,"As a lifelong devotee of the horror film, I can unequivocably state that this is one of the most creepy films I have ever seen. For sheer atmosphere, perhaps only the original Night of the Living Dead comes close. The fact that it is shot in black and white adds much to its power.

Unlike today's horror, which relies overmuchly on depictions of limbs being torn off, bare-midriffed female protagonists, fountaining gore and everyone using four-letter-words several times per sentence, this film here strips things down to the bare bone and gives one a dose of pure psychological horror completely devoid of so much of one frame of cheesy CGI! Amazing! This, my friends, is HOW IT IS DONE. The ""it"" in question being, scaring you to death.

Images from this film will stay with you after it is over. Long before the end of the film it is obvious that the protagonist is doomed; all that remain are the details and they are upsetting indeed. Eerie, sad, and yet subtle... the essence of alienation. And oh yeah... a great example of why looking out of windows after dark is a REALLY bad idea >:-) I am rating four stars only because of some minor flaws such as too much screen time being devoted to stuff like people packing suitcases and driving, etc. I hope they never seriously remake this; a classic should not be messed with unless it can be done better, and I seriously doubt that it can. This is a must-see for fans of the horror genre.",1279065600,6,1443,4.546153846153846

This single Carnival Of Souls (1962) DVD contains both the original black-and-white movie and a colorized version as well.  If you're in the mood for color, watch the color version.  If you want the black-and-white original, it's here, too.  When it comes to cult classics of the horror genre, I lump Carnival Of Souls into the same category as Night Of The Living Dead (1968).  This movie had an extremely low budget - it was made for $30,000, or $17,000, depending on the source.  Whatever it was, it was dirt cheap to make.  But in my opinion, sometimes low budget movies are better than the polished big budget movies with top-of-the-line actors and special effects.  When it comes to horror movies, a small amount of money can produce the same desired result as big budget movies, which is to scare the audience.  The goal is to create an eerie and spooky and scary atmosphere that taps into a person's feelings of fear.  You really don't need a lot of money to accomplish this.  A lot of low budget B horror movies are very effective.  Carnival Of Souls is one of them.

This movie was shot in Lawrence, Kansas and also at the Saltair Pavilion amusement park in Salt Lake City, Utah.  This movie stars Candace Hilligoss as Mary Henry, a church organist who survives a car accident in which her two girl companions died.  Throughout the movie, she often sees the ghostly image of a man (played by director Herk Harvey) practically everywhere she goes.  This man seems to be haunting her.  Nobody else but her sees this man.  It isn't long before she seems to become non-existent to the people around her, all of whom don't see or hear her.  Mary seems to be scared of unknown forces throughout the movie.  It also seems as if what is living and what is dead is a blur to her.  She can't tell the difference.  She basically is caught between the living and the dead.  She is even haunted by her own organ music, which changes from happier tones early in the movie to more sinister and darker tones while she's practicing at the church one night.  It seems as though ever since she saw the Saltair Pavilion for the first time, she became drawn to it.  The end of the movie has a bizarre ending that I won't reveal.  Watch it to find out what happens.

This movie's score is 100% theater organ, performed by Gene Moore.  That's it - an organ.  The organ music is eerie throughout the movie and seems to be off key a lot of the time (intentionally, of course) and has an underlying, subtle carnival melody during a lot of the scenes at the pavilion.  I must say I'm surprised that Candace Hilligoss only appeared in one other movie (The Curse Of The Living Corpse in 1964).  She is nice looking, has very good screen presence, and can act pretty well.

This movie can be classified as having subtle, atmospheric psychological horror.  This movie has no blood and gore.  Instead, the music, camera angles, lighting, howling winds, shadows, moonlight, clouds, and feeling of emptiness make this movie creepy.

This movie has been influential to many horror movie makers, including George Romero, David Lynch and John Carpenter.  Notice how the ghoul (the man who keeps haunting Mary) appears in windows and then disappears.  Michael Myers does the same thing in Halloween (1978).

The audio commentary by Mike Nelson of TV's ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" is obnoxious and useless.  He's a funny guy, but his commentary is pointless for this DVD release.

Do you like low budget B horror movies that are influential cult classics?  Do you like simplicity when it comes to horror movies?  Do you like horror movies involving carnivals?  If so, then check out Carnival Of Souls and buy this DVD where you get both black-and-white and color.",1262822400,11,3767,4.661094224924012

181056,5,1559409002,"Scenario: What would you do if you were suddenly plunged into a world where you didn't belong?

""Carnival of Souls"" was presented originally as a drive-in horror flick for teen consumption. However, it certainly was superior to the usual fare of the time. Had it been filmed in Europe instead of America, it may have even been given the status of an arthouse classic. It's maker, Herk Harvey, was a specialist in industrial films and, as the story goes, he made this ""B"" movie cheaply as somewhat of an experiment to see what he could do in broader cinema. In Harvey's only concession to glamour, he introduces the story with pretty young ladies and that serves as an obvious hook for the mostly adolescent-targetted audience the film would have initially reached. ""Carnival of Souls"" may have, in part, been inspired by a ""Twilight Zone"" episode called ""The Hitchhiker"". Be that as it may, this film really works.

Brief synopsis: A young woman thinks she has survived a car accident. Then, on a dark and lonely road trip, there appears a ghostly stranger who follows her everywhere and demands her hand in a macabre dance that takes place in a derelict carnival site. Mary tries to put this aside as an illusion brought on by the shock of her accident... or perhaps she is the victim of a stalker? So, after having arrived in a new state, our heroine attempts to work a normal job and lead a normal life. However, she periodically loses touch with the stream of life around her, seeming to go out of existence as far as the world is concerned. In one of these dissociation episodes, Mary is directed to a departure gate and, anticipating a way out, instead finds a bus loaded with souls who want to spirit her away. She flees from them and arrives at another gate but when she attempts to go through it, it is locked by the gate-keeper. Another interesting element is introduced when we find Mary in the dressing-room of a clothing store. She is initially unable to manipulate the lock, as if she still feels trapped in the car and trying desperately to get out: simple tasks have come to reflect her trauma. In fact, hardly anything in her world is what it once seemed. For example, the people appear as typical yokels but may hide a transcendental role as angels and demons directing her strange new journey (take special note of her annoying neighbour, Mr Linden, emerging from the waters with the other souls near the end of the drama). Mary is regularly drawn to the abandoned carnival site and wanders the grounds, alone and bewildered, occasionally startled by echoes of life once abundant there. She no longer feels an attachment to living people because she has become separated from her soul and is now a phantom, haunting her own world. This is a problem that needs to be resolved, so the characters in her strange new environment must play their part in uniting her with her soul and its brethren in death, a process she resists with the determination of one clinging to the last, thin threads of life. Mary Henry - Henry Mary, the name is interchangeable as everyman and the plot is emblematic of the dead warrior's journey in purgatory... The ending is less important; it only serves to complete the circle.

""Carnival of Souls"" is more ghost story than ""B"" horror. It is themed on dread and isolation; of being ""dragged"" into a corporeal nightmare, and so doesn't require the obligatory violence that attempts to shock the audience with scenes of blood-curdling murder. The eerie tale seems almost innocuous at first, but eventually inveigles its spell into the viewer's sub-conscious. I must admit, it got into my dreams once or twice, as did the creative music and some of the better cinematography.

Depending on the temperament of the viewer, this film could also be regarded as a dark comedy when seen from the perspective of a girl being pursued for her charms and talents by both the living and the dead, in a grotesque ""tug of war"". However, I prefer to think of it as existential horror rather than a veiled farce.

 ""Carnival of Souls"" has a few flaws in both script and filming but this can be excused due to the lack of financial resources available in its making. In spite of its ""home made"" appearance and some mediocre acting, this supernatural tale is surprisingly nuanced and hence highly recommended. Make sure it's the  black and white, 1962 director's cut.
Yes, it could have been done more professionally, but what do you want for 35 thousand dollars and less than a month to complete? This film deserves 5 stars for achieving so much with so little.",1254614400,4,4588,4.699004975124378

181060,5,1559409002,"Some brilliant directors only make a few movies. Herk Harvey made over four hundred -- but sadly, he only brought his astounding talents into one non-educational movie.

That one brilliant movie is cult horror flick ""Carnival of Souls,"" a nightmarish tale of a young woman who is lingering on in the world of the living -- and is pursued by the dead. Made for a piddling seventeen thousand dollars, this little gem is as eerie now as it was in the 1960s.

Three young women decide to drag race a car of young men -- and their car goes off a bridge into the river. Only Mary (Candace Hilligoss) staggers out of the water, seemingly undisturbed by the accident. The next day she travels to Utah for her new job as a church organist, but on the trip she keeps seeing a grinning, corpselike man watching her from the road.

Mary tries to distract herself with shopping, dodging her lecherous neighbor, and playing the organ. But she keeps seeing the corpse-man), having strange moments where nobody can see or ear her, and also finds herself drawn to a run-down former carnival pavilion. As the dead close in on her, Mary runs from them. But she can't escape what has already happened.

A simple plot, but Herk Harvey handles it with brilliant skill. There's a goofy moment here or there -- at one point Mary turns around to shriek into the camera lens. But most of the time, Harvey keeps the atmosphere piling on, with relatively little dialogue (the most memorable lines are usually shrieked ones like ""I don't want to be alone!"").

In short, Harvey had the ability to inspire something a lot rarer than fear or shocks -- dread. Mary's confusion, fear and denial are almost palpable as she wanders through the town. By the climax, it has transformed into a sort of nightmarish maze that Mary can just run through, with the dead people just a few steps behind her. And there's that creepy organ music all the time.

The ending is not so much a twist as the inevitable answer to all the bizarre events that came before it -- and it's a brilliant, bittersweet ending. Suddenly the ""invisibility"" moments and the dead faces make perfect sense, and we understand that Mary was not meant to be where she was -- having never lived, she could not bear to accept the inevitable.

Mary is also not your typical early-sixties heroine -- she's sharp-tongued (""Thank you, but I'm NEVER coming back here"") and kind of spinsterish by nature. What's more, she is completely detached from everyone around her, since she is not meant to be in the world of the living. Hilligoss (who only made one other movie) is absolutely amazing here, with her distant attitude and frightened eyes.

Brilliant and creepy, ""Carnival of Souls"" is a deserving cult classic. It's a shame that Herk Harvey never made another horror flick, but at least we have this one.",1249948800,3,2830,4.646

181062,5,1559409002,"This is one of the best horror classics ever.  It is a cult film that was never really popular in its time, but has recently resurfaced.  It is well worth getting.  There is no blood and gore, no sex, no bad language, just atmosphere and suspense.  A young church organist is in an auto accident and nearly drowns.  Shortly after that she accepts a position in another church. On the way to her new job she passes an old abandoned circus, which she feels strangely drawn to.  She is also followed by a creepy man who seems to be tied to the circus.  The music in the film is mostly ethreal organ music which helps create the film's tense, other-world atmosphere.  My favorite scene is the one in which she is driving and spies the circus building in the distance.  The car radio is stuck playing the strange organ music whilethe sun is settingg, and she nearly hits the creepy man.  The atmosphere was surreal and the movie maintains this feeling throughout.

The main character is also pursued by one of the most obnoxious suitors in movie history.  She accepts his company only because she is afraid of being alone as many strange things continue happen to her, including further sightings of the creepy man, a fugue like state and nightmares.  While this may sound a little contrived by todays standards, remember this movie was one of the first and it manages to be convincing even today.

181063,4,1559409002,"I'm specifically reviewing the Legend Films version of this DVD, with MST3K's Mike Nelson providing commentary. The first thing to be considered is the fact that this is a ""colorized"" version, and you will find that the ""colorization"" process has come a long way. In the early days, colorized films looked like black and white films with four pastel tints: blue, green, pink, and bronze. Nothing looked ""natural."" In this film, you will see a moment here and there in which a character has the old-style bronze skin tone, but those moments are too few to mention. ""Carnival of Souls"" was the forerunner of later...and better...films that followed, so the debate over whether this film should have been colorized at all is a matter of preference. The print is clean, it looks good, and that's what really matters.

This film was a wise choice for Mike Nelson's wise-cracking commentary (as well as the follow-up ""RiffTrax"" version with Kevin ""Tom Servo"" Murphy and Bill ""Crow Mach II"" Corbett). There are some killer scenes in the movie, blueprints that filmmakers still follow to this day...and long, long stretches of tedium. That's where Mike (on the DVD) and the ""Three Riffers"" (on commentary available from the RiffTrax Web Site) really shine.

Leading lady Candace Hilligloss made one other feature film...""The Curse of the Living Corpse,"" with a pre-""Jaws"" Roy Scheider...available on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Del-Tenney-Double-Feature/dp/B000C65YHG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Del Tenney Double Feature</a>&nbsp;DVD.

Here, she's more than up to the task of portraying the heroine with a constant sense of foreboding. It's difficult to discuss the film without using spoilers (although it is so well known among fans of the genre). Many directorial aspects are reminiscent of schlock-gore pioneer Herschel Gordon Lewis (minus the gore).

181066,4,1559409002,"I love this movie!  I saw this film a while ago (the Criterion Collection edition) and was amazed by the interesting storyline.  And the film is just over an hour so it's a fast paced story.

Herk Harvey and John Clifford came up with an interesting concept: Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) gets into what should have been a fatal car accident during a drag race.  She is uneasy in town, but she is leaving anyways to take a job as a church organist (although to her its just a job and the church is a place of business).  On her way there, she is stalked by a ghostly/ghastly man (scarily played by Herk himself).  She becomes even more paranoid when it appears as though people treat her like she doesn't exist.  The story comes to a thrilling conclusion with visually stunning scenes at the old carnival.

I cannot explain why I like this film, I just do.  I think the colorization is actually well done.  I have yet to listen to the humorous commentary so I cannot rate that.  Although, if you have the extra money I would go for the Criterion Collection: the film is cleaned up so the great cinematography at the end is crisp, as well as having the director's cut.

181069,4,1559409002,"CARNIVAL OF SOULS

This is a movie which will definitely make an impact on its viewer.  It is creepy in so many ways that there are few moments in the film that aren't discomforting.  It's also a frighteningly sad tale that touches on the subjects of social isolation, loneliness, disconnect from God, death--it's a big heap of Existential thought really.  It also has one of the most interesting film monsters of all time, this reoccurring ghoul who torments the movies protagonist to the point of a complete breakdown.

The movie focuses on a young woman, Mary Henry.  It begins with a drag race that goes badly and the car Mary is riding in goes into a river, killing the other two passengers but leaving Mary alive.  After this accident, she decides to move and find a new beginning as a church organist in Salt Lake City.  All seems well, but Mary soon finds she is being followed by a fiendish looking ghoul.  She never gets more than a quick glimpse of this man, but she is certain he exists and is afraid of him.

Coinciding with this apparition of the dead man is the apparition of a living one, her new neighbor, John.  He is a ghoul in a different way, but he is interested in Mary, too.  He's crude, greasy, likes booze for breakfast, and is interested in just one thing from Mary.  Under normal circumstances, she would probably have shunned this looser, but Mary is growing increasingly vulnerable as the ghoul becomes more prevalent and so she turns to John for comfort, surrendering her dignity to him just so she won't be alone.

But even this won't be enough to save Mary.  John recoils in disgust from her because of her visions, and Mary finds herself becoming increasingly alienated from normal society.  Not only can she not relate to men, but she commits an unconscious act of blasphemy in a church, has moments when she becomes suddenly invisible, and takes no joy in the lighter things in life.  The only thing that seems to give her comfort is the abandoned carnival near town.  It's inexplicable, but Mary feels drawn to this place, as if voices were calling her.  All the while, the ghoul becomes more frequent and rather than making quick appearances, he lingers for longer periods of time.  Eventually, the single ghoul is joined by others, and it becomes clear that Mary is fighting a force that is greatly outnumbering her, a force she can no longer deny.  She will find her fate at the pavilion, if not the answers to the riddle that has become her life.

Perhaps the most effective thing about this movie is that you get to experience it through Mary's eyes.  You get to feel all the oppressive lonesomeness and fear that she feels while being just as confused as to why this is all happening.  The film also makes great use of music.  Throughout the movie we are subjected to this bizarre organ music that comes over the radio or from Mary herself, but it blends so well with the scenes that you don't think about it.  Many of the best parts were also filmed on some great locations.  They are often spacious and bleak landscapes, void of human life.  Between all these elements, there is a continual feeling of disconnect from the world that hits home.

It's really somewhat of a tragic movie.  Mary is eventually driven to the brink of insanity, her mind and soul are broken by the strain of her ordeals.  The key to her problems lie with the ghoul, but facing him once and for all will be the hardest think Mary has ever had to do.",1224460800,,3469,4.537842190016103

Okay, so you have both Criterion and Image Entertainment releasing the same movie in the same year; a film that until then, had only known cruddy, ""Public Domain"", hell (on TV, $0.99 VHS and $1.99 DVD's) and with pretty much the same remastered picture quality, right?

Well here's where it gets very odd; the, Criterion set, has two versions of the film, a 78 minute theatrical version and an 83 minute Director's Cut, where as the Image Entertainment DVD has a running time of 82 minutes (note: all of the actual discs, corroborate, the DVD cases, printed running times).

So, one would assume that the Image disc, was culled from the same print used to create the Criterion, Director's Cut, seeing as the run times are so close, and as previously mentioned, the prints look very much the same...

...but you would be wrong.

The reason being, is that both of the Criterion versions have a scene near the beginning of the film where a police/detective, person, is interviewing the driver of the second car in the opening drag race, asking the driver his version of the events on the bridge, but this scene is absent from the Image version.

Now granted, this is a little 10 second scene, but it dose rise the question as to where Image got this pristine print from (as there are no restoration notes on the Image packaging) and why does it very from the theatrical version in this one scene (possibly others as well, but I've yet to do any serious, frame-by-frame, comparisons to all three films because, well, I do have a life, lol).

The scene in question is actually quite redundant, as we already have witnessed the events on the bridge, and know what happened, and it's non-inclusion in the Image version is seamlessly done, making it look, for all the world, like the scene was an added scene for the Director's Cut of the, Criterion version, but since this scene is also in the theatrical cut, one has to wonder (once again) where the Image print came from (and how much more is different between the three versions, for that matter).

Then there's the running time issues, as you would assume that the Image DVD would be the theatrical cut (possibly licensed from Criterion to provide a cheap alternative to the Criterion set, as was done with the movie, Zombi, which both Blue Underground and Shriek Show paid to have the film restored, and one put out a low priced, movie only DVD at the same time that the other put out a two disc special edition version) but where as the theatrical cut is 78 minutes, and it's Director's Cut is 83 minutes, the Image disc is 82 minutes (and is missing at least one scene that both the theatrical and Director's Cuts have).

Once I saw the extras, and how the director and crew of this film were best known for hundreds of ""Centron"" public service films in the 60's (another genre that was spoofed by the animated Simpsons ""Troy McClure""), it frankly cast a negative light on this film-as if this film was merely their triumphant apogee of a rather drab, cheap genre.  I want to emphasize, the film essentially has no story whatsoever, and the general direction of the story is pretty obvious, from the get go.  What drives the film are the one off set pieces on cold human cruelty and isolation, and utter hypocrisy.

It quickly grabs your attention when a car plunges off a bridge into a river.  There is one lone survivor that emerges from the water, apparently unscathed.  She has no recollection of the accident.
As the story progresses you are left wondering about her.  Hallucinations and nightmares begin to manifest, sometimes this woman seems disconnected from reality.
Now you'll probably see the ending coming, it's been done countless times by todays horror.  But I'm sure it was quite a shock back then.
For this low low price, this is a must own if you're a fan of classic horror.  I don't know if I'd splurge for the Criterion though, but it might be worth it...",1193011200,,851,4.596026490066225

181084,5,1559409002,"Legend Films presents ""CARNIVAL OF SOULS"" (Released: 2 November 1962) (78 mins) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) --- now in COLOR and Glorious Black and White --- Carnival of Souls is a horror film released in 1962 --- Produced and directed by Herk Harvey for an estimated $33,000, the movie never gained widespread public attention when it was originally released as it was intended as a B film and today, remains obscure --- Set to an organ score by Gene Moore, Carnival of Souls relies more on atmosphere than on special effects to create its mood of horror --- The film has a cult following and occasionally has screenings at local film and Halloween festivals.

Herk Harvey was a Lawrence, Kansas-based director and producer of industrial and educational films for the Centron Corporation --- While vacationing in Salt Lake City, he developed the idea for the movie after driving past the abandoned Saltair Pavilion --- John Clifford (Screenwriter), Maurice Prather (Cinematographer), Gene Moore (Composer (Music Score), Bill de Jarnette (Editor), Dan Palmquist (Editor) --- Hiring an unknown actress, Lee Strasberg-trained Candace Hilligoss, and otherwise employing mostly local talent, he shot Carnival of Souls in three weeks, on location in Lawrence and Salt Lake City. (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

The story line and plot, riding in a car with two friends Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) are forced off a bridge into a river --- Mary emerges from the river, as it appears to the audience that all have been drowned --- with a new job as the church organist Mary goes on with her life as she knows it --- a mysterious phantom figure that seems to reside in an old run-down pavilion keeps showing up and Mary must now confront her personal demons of her spiritual insouciance.--- just too much good to be said about this small masterpiece of independent film making --- once you experience the dreamlike qualities of this eerie masterpiece you'll never have another quiet nights sleep again.

Candace Hilligoss ...  Mary Henry
 Frances Feist ...  Mrs. Thomas, Landlady

181085,5,1559409002,"I had the misfortune of viewing this movie at the age of 7, late one night on New York television. I was unable to sleep for three nights straight afterward, and hold every other horror movie I've ever seen up to this one to see if they measure up. Usually, they don't even come close, resorting to cheap blood spatter and CGI tricks. The only notable contenders are THE HAUNTING (original 1963 Robert Wise version) and THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE. But don't watch *any* of these 3 films alone. Great spooky fun selections for a Halloween Movie Night.",1189555200,,548,4.545454545454546
181086,3,1559409002,"Carnival of Souls did not feel like an older movie, it felt like a movie from today that was made in black and white trying to look old, like the beginning of Night of the Creeps, but nothing in this movie is at it seems.

At the beginning there is a tragic car accident that you don't really see coming and it grabs you, one of the girls from the car Mary Henry suddenly appears on the shore of the lake where the car went into.  We don't know what  Mary was like before the accident but after it she leaves town to play organ for a church in Utah, which is just a job to her and business only.  On her way late at night a freaky face of a man appears out her passenger side window, freaky at first but after you've seen him a bunch of times it becomes repetitive.  She also notices a n abandoned carnival that looks like architecture from Moscow.

Mary moves into a rooming house with a landlady and a slimy pushy idiot of  guy who is constantly trying to get with her.  Mary mostly wants no part of him nor any man at all for that matter.

Throughout the 83mins of the directors cut Mary sees hallucinations and has episodes when nobody can see or hear her, is she dreaming?  Is she going crazy?  At times Mary reminded me of Catherine Deneuve's character in Roman Polanski's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Repulsion/dp/B0007GAG42/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Repulsion</a>&nbsp;although Catherine Deneuve was more effective, that is if she is in fact going crazy.

So, to recap, the beginning grabs you with a shocking accident you don't see coming, then quickly after we get some good atmosphere and creepy apparitions or hallucinations that lose there effectiveness as the movie goes on, and at 83mins I kept finding myself looking at how much time was left.  I'm not impatient I was into every minute of Lawrence of Arabia's 5 hours this just didn't keep me personally into it.

**Spoiler alert**

At the end we see the car from the beginning being towed out of the lake with her and her friends still in it and there dead.  So then the movie couldn't have been her dream or her going crazy.  My far fetched guess that I was thinking maybe Mary is trapped between Heaven and Hell.  The zombies at the carnival and her being drawn to it could be some kind of devils trying to take her to hell and the Priest where she plays the organ could be trying to help her as he encourages her to have faith, or I'm totally wrong.",1188086400,4,2467,4.568181818181818
181087,4,1559409002,"Like Edgar G. Ulmer's ""Detour"" and the original ""Night of the Living Dead,"" Herk Harvey's ""Carnival of Souls"" manages to be much better than the sum of its parts. Much of the camerawork looks cheesy, much of the acting is amateurish, and the basic logic of what's happening to church organist Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) makes no more sense than in most B-grade, on-the-cheap horror flicks. Nevertheless, Harvey (an educational and industrial filmmaker whose only theatrical film this was) shows a flair bordering on genius for poetically creepy cinematic imagery, and Hilligoss (who bears more than a passing resemblance both to ""Living Dead's"" Judith O'Dea and ""Young Frankenstein's"" Teri Garr) is extremely effective as Mary, an uptight and neurotic soul who suddenly finds herself beset by white-faced zombies no one else can see. So what if Hilligoss does a lousy job of faking her organ-playing? The image of the ghouls waltzing at double-speed to the wheezing, stinging organ music is one worthy of Murnau or James Whale. A word of caution: I saw the Rhino Video DVD of ""Carnival of Souls,"" and it is execrable--the print is scratched and pitted, with massive skips and gaps. If you care enough about this movie to buy the DVD, I'm certain the Criterion Collection version is the one to buy, no matter that it costs several times more than the other available versions.",1187827200,,1379,5.0
181088,4,1559409002,"Everything about this film suggests ""el-cheapo drive-in flick"": pretty woman, cheap thrills, low-budget, cheesy effects.  But somehow it adds up to more than the sum of its parts.  The directorial touches are actually well-conceived and artistic.  The acting is above-average.  And, the soundtrack score is fantastic.  It and the Salt Lake pavilion provide a wonderfully eerie and dreamlike backdrop that keeps the viewer entranced.

The Criterion package is, as usual, a bang-up job.  There are several entertaining extras.  My favorite is a news/documentary piece on the Salt Lake pavilion.  It provides a history of a very interesting piece of Mormon/Utah history.",1184544000,,667,5.524752475247524
181089,5,1559409002,"This is an amazing film. If you like horror movies, this is a must see. This film has more creepyness than new films costing 100 times as much to make.

I have one question though! the version I saw was actually filmed in and around Salt Lake City, UT and used the old Saltair pavilion! is there two versions of this movie out there?",1170806400,,316,4.180327868852459
181091,4,1559409002,"I saw this film as a kid and recently saw it again. It really holds up. The scene on the bridge sent shivers down my spine and all the carnival stuff holds up well. The musical score by Gene Moore is sufficiently eerie to keep the mood creepy. All praise goes onto Candace Hilligoss who plays Mary Henry in a very intense performance, that is both eerie and surreal. She really makes the film work. The directing by Herk Harvey is very good for a B movie. This movie goes on a little long but it is still worth seeing.",1169596800,,518,4.19

Plus you get the two original versions of the film, neither of which are colorized.",1166313600,7,395,5.253968253968254
181093,5,1559409002,"A few years ago I picked up a book in San Francisco that listed hundreds of cult films of the drive-in ilk, what fun!  I bought a collection of horror films, included in which was Carnival of Souls--which ties for my favorite film in the low-budget horror genre (alongside Night of the Living Dead). After viewing the film, I looked through my book and found that this obscure gem gets a fine treatment, ending with,  ""The best horror film you probably never saw.""  In short, watch it!

From the opening sequence and credits (music and visuals from another world--right up there with Mario Bava and David Lynch in its evocativeness), the viewer is entranced by the sense of alienation surrounding the character who, by the way, can endear us (sense of shared fate) and alienate us at the same time with her ice-princess demeanor (sort of Catherine Denueve).

Atmospheric, a description that still means something, best describes this film--aided by black and white format.  Music vascilates back and forth between the ominous organ music and upbeat road music accompanying Mary Henry out of town after a lapse of two days of being the only survivor out of three girls whose car goes over a bridge into murky water.  The sheer ""casualness"" and ""business as usual"" approach to handling the local tragedy makes this type of film infinitely superior to outrageous blockbusters, most of which dull the imagination--Silence of the Lambs always withstanding).

Things I love IN the film: the bridge (Americana), haircuts and shirtsleeves, guys at bridge scene gawking to tell story around dinner table we assume, and best of all--Mrs. Thomas with her can of AJAX and her boarding house:  ""Take as many baths as you want.  I'm not one to make a fuss about a thing like that.""

Heck, I may prefer this film to Night of the Living Dead.

Happy Horrific viewing!",1166054400,3,1851,4.841269841269841
181094,5,1559409002,"I first saw this film on video when it was ""somewhat"" restored in the 1980's.  Of course, it had the cult reputation of a long unseen film, and seeing it the first time was a bit of a letdown.  But when Criterion released it in this deluxe 2 DVD edition, I decided to try again.  I am very happy I did.  This is a real gem, disquieting, scary, incredibly atmospheric, and haunting (no pun intended).  I have always loved horror films that are quiet, that get inside your head, and really play around with your consciousness.  Films like that are The Sixth Sense, Kwaidan, Daughters of Darkness, Dreyer's Vampyr, the films of Kiyoshi Kurosawa (Cure, the original Pulse), and this film too.  They don't smash you over the head with violence and gore.  They end up disturbing you in ways you can't really explain.  As some reviewers have noted, Herk Harvey, the director, made only one feature film in his life, and this is it.  He was an industrial filmmaker who worked at Centron Corporation in Lawrence, Kansas (where much of this film was shot) all his life.  He made over 400 industrial films (those cheesy, ""how to"" films that get parodied to death on TV).  Harvey said he wanted to make a film with ""the look of a Bergman film, and the feel of a Cocteau one"", and he did.  There is much to like about this work.  The organ score is exceptionally creepy, the photography is very good considering how low budget the film was, and the Pavillion where we see the souls dancing is one of the best locations I've ever seen for a film.  A note to burgeoning filmmakers:  to save money, shoot at a place that has been abandoned, but has great atmosphere (Kubrick did this with Full Metal Jacket.  Hue City was actually an abandoned gas works outside London).  Some of the acting here is rather amateurish, but it doesn't really bother me too much.  Candance Hilgegrass is actually good, playing a cold, dispassionate woman.  Her performance is rather off putting, but it works rather well here.  Some of Harvey's industrial films are included on this set, and they're so incredibly cheesy.  You can probably safely skip them.  While this film didn't do rather well at first, I'm glad it got rediscovered, and Harkey got the credit he deserved.  Make sure you buy the Criterion edition.  There are some public domain copies floating around here, and they are more than likely horrible.",1164067200,6,2380,4.636363636363637
181095,5,1559409002,"Some brilliant directors only make a few movies. Herk Harvey made over four hundred -- but sadly, he only brought his astounding talents into one non-educational movie.

That one brilliant movie is cult horror flick ""Carnival of Souls,"" a nightmarish tale of a young woman who is lingering on in the world of the living -- and is pursued by the dead. Made for a piddling seventeen thousand dollars, this little gem is as eerie now as it was in the 1960s.

Three young women decide to drag race a car of young men -- and their car goes off a bridge into the river. Only Mary (Candace Hilligoss) staggers out of the water, seemingly undisturbed by the accident. The next day she travels to Utah for her new job as a church organist, but on the trip she keeps seeing a grinning, corpselike man watching her from the road.

Mary tries to distract herself with shopping, dodging her lecherous neighbor, and playing the organ. But she keeps seeing the corpse-man), having strange moments where nobody can see or ear her, and also finds herself drawn to a run-down former carnival pavilion. As the dead close in on her, Mary runs from them... but she can't escape from them forever.

A simple plot, but Herk Harvey handles it with brilliant skill. There's a goofy moment here or there -- at one point Mary turns around to shriek into the camera lens. But most of the time, Harvey keeps the atmosphere piling on, with relatively little dialogue (the most memorable lines are usually shrieked ones like ""I don't want to be alone!"").

In short, Harvey had the ability to inspire something a lot rarer than fear or shocks -- dread. Mary's confusion, fear and denial are almost palpable as she wanders through the town. By the climax, it has transformed into a sort of nightmarish maze that Mary can just run through, with the dead people just a few steps behind her. And there's that creepy organ music all the time.

The ending is not so much a twist as the inevitable answer to all the bizarre events that came before it -- and it's a brilliant, bittersweet ending. It was also the ending that has inspired creepy horror movies ever since. Suddenly the ""invisibility"" moments and the dead faces make perfect sense, and we understand what it is that Mary is really running from.

Mary is also not your typical early-sixties heroine -- she's sharp-tongued (""Thank you, but I'm NEVER coming back here"") and kind of spinsterish by nature. What's more, she is completely detached from everyone around her, since she is not meant to be in the world of the living. Hilligoss (who only made one other movie) is absolutely amazing here, with her distant attitude and frightened eyes.

This version doesn't have the loads of extras the Criterion one has. But it does have a well-colorized version, as well as the original black-and-white. The icing on the cake: Mike Nelson of Mystery Science Theatre 3000 does the commentary, which is the same sort of mockery they had for other such movies.

Brilliant and creepy, ""Carnival of Souls"" is a deserving cult classic. It's a shame that Herk Harvey never made another horror flick, but at least we have this one.",1162512000,11,3139,4.672101449275362

If you're willing to shell out for it, the Criterion version of ""Carnival of Souls"" is the one to get, especially since it includes both versions of the movie, nicely restored (if you don't have much money, try Alpha). When it first came out, five minutes were chopped off, and here the second disc contains those five extra minutes, reinserted. Nothing groundbreaking, but these little moments of utter creepiness add to the atmosphere.

Additionally, Criterion loads it up on fan-friendly extras -- galleries, interviews, company stills, tours of the Kansas town where it was shot, and other little goodies. The documentaries about the making of the film and its history are the highlight of the extra material, and this is mainly for the diehard fan.

181099,4,1559409002,"WOW! This is the first film that ever scared me $#!^less!!! This and the opening of Chiller Theatre (with the 6 fingered hand) spooked me to the bone as a small boy. As an adult, it seems laughable, but it brings back fond memories of my first childhood freak out scare. I doubt it would have the same impact for an adult who had never seen it as a child, or a child in this day & age with all the gore & horror and violence widely available to them on cable, with so many parents parking their kids in front of the [...] tube. This film is a timeless classic not because it was so polished & perfect, so masterfully written, filmed or produced or even well acted (although I have to give the actors some brief moments of brilliance) It was great because Herk Harvey accidentally tripped over some really interesting stuff. Call it quirky black comedy, call it cheesy tacky irony, call it a breath of fresh, yet very inexpensive air, call it what you will. This fractured flick will always be indelibly inked in my memory. My advice? Try to look at it with innocent childrens eyes & perceptions and it will be much more enjoyable (alone in absolute silence would be even better!)

181100,5,1559409002,"Carnival of Souls is one of my favorite kinds of movie -  the low budget horror film that manages to unnerve, and create a world of mystery and possibilities despite - and sometimes even because of - its lack of funding.  It's the only feature film made by the late Herk Harvey, and despite a lackluster initial release, it has become increasingly popular over the years. It ponders the question - when the emotionally dead actually die, do they even notice?

One of the director's best decisions was to take a considerable amount of his meager budget and spend it on a quality yet unknown leading actress in Candace Hilligoss.  She certainly was perfect for the lead role of Mary Henry. She is excellent at portraying someone who is emotionally hollow who has ironically chosen something that generally attracts people of passion - music - as a profession. In the hands of a less able actress, Mary's largely deadpan demeanor would have simply appeared to be the work of an actress who was unclear about her motivation. Harvey knew instinctively that poor acting in a low budget horror film always takes the viewer out of the proper element and instead makes the film campy - which is definitely not a word that describes this movie.

The film opens when a car filled with guys challenges a car filled with girls to a drag race.  Drag races in movies rarely yield anything but tragic outcomes, and in this case, the girls' car plunges off the side of a bridge and disappears into the murky river below.  As the local law enforcement attempt to drag the river, complaining because of its current height and low visibility that the car might never be found, one of the victims, Mary Henry, crawls out of the water, covered in muck and obviously in a stupor, but physically unharmed.  She remembers nothing about the accident. In spite of this tragedy, she continues with her plans to move west to Salt Lake City, where she's been offered a job as a church organist.  While on the trip west an eerie ghoulish face and figure, who looks a lot like Uncle Fester of the Addams Family, begins to appear out of nowhere and then disappear just as suddenly, and nobody seems able to see him except for her.

She takes a boarding room just down the hall from John (Sidney Berger), who quickly tries to put the moves on her with all of the finesse of a pimply-faced high school sophomore.  Berger was always proud of the fact that film critic Roger Ebert called him ""the definitive portrait of a nerd in lust"".  Mary sometimes rejects John, but sometimes welcomes his company just because she's beginning to fear being alone, considering the random appearances of the ghoulish figure. Mary is not the kind of person who needs people for companionship. Instead, unless they fulfill a concrete requirement like a car or a coffeemaker, or in John's case something that wards off the ghoul that stalks her, she is largely indifferent to their presence.

An abandoned carnival ground on the outskirts of town catches Mary's attention, and she begins to be drawn toward it, as though that strange setting might offer some sort of answer to her mystery.  What follows is two terrific set pieces, one involving her practicing her music in church only to be overcome by visions and a mysterious power that turns her playing into something `profane' that gets her fired from her job, and the first of two eerie scenarios where Mary seems to have become invisible and inaudible to all around her. The ending might have been considered surprising in 1962, but today it's pretty obvious from the beginning what is probably going on. In this movie, however, the entertainment is in the journey, not the destination.

What Harvey lacked in finances for special effects, he more than made up for in atmosphere, which cost him monetarily little or nothing.  His undead creatures are startling to look at, and the way he films their bizarre, macabre dances is both strange and unnerving.  When he claimed his influences were Jean Cocteau and Ingmar Bergman, he wasn't kidding.  Fans of those directors will notice how much homage is paid to them in this film, and how much those were the right two filmmakers to emulate to create the surreal mood of this particular picture.  Also, the unforgettable organ score by Gene Moore is perfect for adding just the right mood to this film.

The original version of the picture had five minutes cut out of it by Harvey's distributor, simply to make the movie fit better on a double feature billing.  With this DVD, you can compare that version with the restored director's cut, and I believe that the latter is definitely the better one.  Most of what was cut came from two scenes near the end, the second adventure of invisibility for Mary, and the final confrontation at the carnival grounds.  Harvey's version is decidedly creepier, with a much better flow to it.

Carnival of Souls was one of the first truly good low-budget out-of-the-mainstream classic horror films. The next one would be 1968's ""Night of the Living Dead"" by George Romero. This movie proves that talent, vision, and imagination can triumph over funding to create something lasting, memorable, and unique. Who would have thought that a film that cost only $30K to make would have people talking philosophically about the dividing line between life and death over 40 years later?  How many of the films made in the last five years that cost $100 million to make will have the same effect on audiences 40 years from now?  I doubt many if any will.",1156636800,25,5530,4.734375
181101,5,1559409002,"Some brilliant directors only make a few movies. Herk Harvey made over four hundred -- but sadly, he only brought his astounding talents into one non-educational movie.

That one brilliant movie is cult horror flick ""Carnival of Souls,"" a nightmarish tale of a young woman who is lingering on in the world of the living -- and is pursued by the dead. Made for a piddling seventeen thousand dollars, this little gem is as eerie now as it was in the 1960s.

Three young women decide to drag race a car of young men -- and their car goes off a bridge into the river. Only Mary (Candace Hilligoss) staggers out of the water, seemingly undisturbed by the accident. The next day she travels to Utah for her new job as a church organist, but on the trip she keeps seeing a grinning, corpselike man watching her from the road.

Mary tries to distract herself with shopping, dodging her lecherous neighbor, and playing the organ. But she keeps seeing the corpse-man), having strange moments where nobody can see or ear her, and also finds herself drawn to a run-down former carnival pavilion. As the dead close in on her, Mary runs from them. But she can't escape what has already happened.

A simple plot, but Herk Harvey handles it with brilliant skill. There's a goofy moment here or there -- at one point Mary turns around to shriek into the camera lens. But most of the time, Harvey keeps the atmosphere piling on, with relatively little dialogue (the most memorable lines are usually shrieked ones like ""I don't want to be alone!"").

In short, Harvey had the ability to inspire something a lot rarer than fear or shocks -- dread. Mary's confusion, fear and denial are almost palpable as she wanders through the town. By the climax, it has transformed into a sort of nightmarish maze that Mary can just run through, with the dead people just a few steps behind her. And there's that creepy organ music all the time.

The ending is not so much a twist as the inevitable answer to all the bizarre events that came before it -- and it's a brilliant, bittersweet ending. Suddenly the ""invisibility"" moments and the dead faces make perfect sense, and we understand that Mary was not meant to be where she was -- having never lived, she could not bear to accept the inevitable.

Mary is also not your typical early-sixties heroine -- she's sharp-tongued (""Thank you, but I'm NEVER coming back here"") and kind of spinsterish by nature. What's more, she is completely detached from everyone around her, since she is not meant to be in the world of the living. Hilligoss (who only made one other movie) is absolutely amazing here, with her distant attitude and frightened eyes.

The Alpha Video version of this is a good cheap version -- the picture is clear, though slightly tinted with purple in some scenes; it seems that Alpha got their hands on a very good print of this movie. Not a snap, crackle or pop to be heard on the soundtrack either.

Brilliant and creepy, ""Carnival of Souls"" is a deserving cult classic. It's a shame that Herk Harvey never made another horror flick, but at least we have this one.",1156550400,6,3100,4.601449275362318
181102,4,1559409002,"A starkly filmed black & white independent chiller that while not glossy, never looks cheap.  Both ""The Sixth Sense"" & ""The Others"" owe some debt to this ghostly & ghastly tale of a young tortured church organist who after escaping from a car accident fatal to all other passengers goes on a dark journey of self discovery.

The script along with the acting may not be up to polished Hollywood standards, but both are solid with instances of great, realistic dialogue spoken with conviction.  When her new boss, the pastor of a small community church asks the lead character why she isn't as spiritual as a church organist ought to be, she simply answers, ""I look at it as just a job.""  Candace Hilligoss comes off always believably and seems to get better and more convincing as the movie progresses.  All the supporting actors offer up decent portrayals that while may never sparkle, never truly flag the production as amateur.  One exception is Sydney Berger who plays the amorous John Linden unsuccessfully trying to date Mary.  Linden is the perfect counterpoint to Mary.  He's a lonely man looking for companionship and attempts to anchor Mary to a world she knows she can't belong to anymore.  It's subtle narrative touches like this one that set apart the film from so many run of the mill shock fests.

When the shocks do come, they are so nightmarishly realized that horror fans won't be disappointed.  Make no mistake, Carnival of Souls isn't a gore fest.  The scares lie in phantoms and imagery so bizarre and unsettling that one feels as if they've landed in a dream.  Movies should transport us - to another place - another time - or another way of thinking or feeling.  With Carnival of Souls, you'll be transported and absolutely never forget, nor regret the journey.",1154390400,2,1783,4.765472312703583
181103,4,1559409002,"Two cars drag race on a desolate stretch of road in rural Kansas.  One car runs off a bridge, plunges into a deep river and quickly sinks.  All three young women inside are assumed dead.  However, hours after the crash, one woman emerges from the river, alive and unharmed, but unable or unwilling to explain her miraculous survival.

That intriguing premise, ladies and gentlemen, is merely the pre-credits opening sequence of CARNIVAL OF SOULS.

I hadn't heard of this movie before.  However, quick trips to IMDB and Wikipedia tell me that I should have.  It was an cheap, obscure, throwaway flick when it was first released, but has gained a cult following in the decades since.  And it's easy to see why.  Because despite its flaws, there is a lot of atmosphere and horror here.

The story follows Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss), the young woman inexplicably left alive when all reason would indicate that she be dead.  Following the accident, she leaves town as she has been hired as a church organist in Utah.  During her trip, she is haunted by bizarre and unexplainable visions.  After her arrival, the sightings continue and she finds herself drawn to a mysterious, abandoned carnival.  Also, despite making a serious impression on a man living in her building, she begins temporarily slipping out of reality, unable to make herself seen or heard by those around her.

I'm not the first (nor will I be the last) to notice that CARNIVAL OF SOULS has the definite feel of a lost, elongated episode of THE TWILIGHT ZONE (indeed, it contains similar themes to ""The Hitchhiker"", although CARNIVAL is creepier and has more going on).  This is very atmospheric, very creepy and unsettling.  It's the kind of movie you watch and then don't want to look out of dark windows at night because if you don't look, you won't have to see what's out there.

I liked that the central character is both an identification point (we, like her, want to discover what is going on around her) and a enigmatic mystery.  How did she survive the car crash?  That event must have something to do with her visions, but what is the connection?  Why is she drawn to the carnival?

Of course, I found it difficult to watch CARNIVAL without being distracted by the cheap production values and numerous technical flaws.  While occasionally the mistakes add to the atmosphere of confusion, overall they can't help but detract from the film as a whole.  Keep in mind that this film gets a lot of attention based on how good it is despite its flaws.  So don't go into it expecting perfection.

However, those flaws almost enhance the genuinely effective moments, because they seem to rise like roses out of, well, if not manure, than certainly ordinary film making.  There are many creepy individual shots I'll remember, most of which concern the unnerving ghostly apparitions.  Sometimes simple, primitive special effects are more chilling than there expensive counterparts, and the shots of the specters stalking the protagonist are clear evidence of that.

I really enjoyed the ending of the film.  Sometimes a script will attempt to explain too much, leaving the movie feeling a little too neat.  Other times, the producers will leave things so vague as to render any coherent theory impossible.  CARNIVAL hit the magic median for me.  I got a lot out of the ending, and was happy to see that while there are numerous theories on-line ""explaining"" the conclusion, not one of them exactly lines up with my own.  I like that about a film.

The inexpensive Digiview Productions release of this DVD is quite watchable, and while I'm sure the Criterion version has a vastly superior picture, this is great for people like me who are discovering this for the first time.",1153180800,5,3741,4.810344827586207

From his crow's nest shots of her wandering through the deserted carnival to the scenes of her lone sedan traversing the twilight prairie highway, he unfailingly delivers a picture of un-peopled vastness--a vastness that cannot be breached by human or psychic outreach.

And that is what this film is really about--Mary Henry's inability to accept the fact that she has already departed from the world she continues to haunt.

Ultimately she knows, (as does her personal Charon--the Carnival Ghoul) that she must be reclaimed--and it is in her persistent refusal to yield to his summons, from which the conflict and tension of the film springs.

181110,5,1559409002,"""I don't belong in the world....something separates me from other people"" says Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) in perhaps the most lyrical horror film ever made. It is the unlikely 1962 masterpiece ""Carnival of Souls"" which philosophically fleshes out the premise of ""Twilight Zone's"" ""The Hitch Hiker"" episode (January 1960). The one where Inger Stevens (as Nan Adams) plays a young woman driving cross country who keeps passing the ""same"" man standing by the side of the road. Its masterpiece quality was unlikely because it was the low budget first feature film of Herk Harvey (a director of educational short films), using actors with little acting for the camera experience, and with a story structure adapted to fit sets and locations to which Harvey had free access.

One of these locations was an organ factory. This not only dictated the film's unique and beautiful score but it suggested a profession for the main character (Mary Henry), a church organist. With this they really got lucky because it brings in many disturbing religious images and undertones. A church organist seemingly possessed by her instrument, as her playing alternates between the spiritual and the profane, deeply disturbs her wrapped-too-tight"" minister who would have benefited from Pollyanna's advice about the ""rejoicing texts"". The organ factory also serves nicely for a Carol Reed-type angular crane shot with the huge organ pipes in the foreground and the diminutive figure of Hilligoss far below. This early shot sets the existential tone for what will follow. Finally, there is the moment when she is alone on the highway and her radio will only pick up organ music.

The other location is the abandoned Saltair Pavilion outside Salt Lake City. Much of the story takes place here as Mary Henry is mysteriously drawn to the place. Watch for this shot of her in front of a promotional poster for the Pavilion, on the poster is a look-alike blonde with the same hairstyle. Since the late 19th century, Saltair had been a family swimming/recreational facility built out into the Great Salt Lake. The huge pavilion looks like a strange cross between an Eastern Orthodox church and an Arabian Nights palace. The falling lake level doomed the swimming feature but the place operated as an amusement park until abandoned five years before the filming of ""Carnival of Souls"". At the time of filming the actual pealing paint, broken glass, collapsed staircases, and general disorder made for a better location than even the best production designer could have constructed. It also works well from a ""language of film"" symbolic perspective as Mary is shown walking through an unnatural circular passage, which reinforces other subtles off-kilter elements that occur throughout the film.

While much of the film's texture was the happy result of the low budget necessity of using these available locations, the casting of Hilligoss worked out even better. Probably cast because she was the most beautiful actress available for the price, Harvey hit a home run because she brings exactly the right sterile and distanced qualities that the film needs in its main character. Hilligoss might have been an acting-for-the-camera novice but she had extensive stage experience. Harvey was able to get an extraordinary nonverbal performance from her, unexpectedly taking the film deep into the concept of human alienation. Much like ""The Incredible Shinking Man"", with its existential theme of separation from society, ""Carnival of Souls"" also transcends its genre and explores the isolation of someone who feels they no longer belong. And like ""TISM"", the resolution is the realization that loss of identity is freedom, that the infinite and the infinitesimal are the same, that you are not alone because you are a part of something bigger.

The two occasions where Mary Henry suddenly becomes invisible to everyone are much more vivid because Hilligoss is so beautiful. Unlike a person of average appearance, an especially beautiful woman walking down the street is used to drawing stares from virtually everyone. For such a person the phenomenon of sudden invisibility would be far more jarring than for those who are used to not being noticed in the passing crowd.

For budget reasons, egg white was used on the faces of the ""dead"" cast members, including Harvey himself who plays Mary's recurring apparition. This has an especially eerie effect with black and white film and would be adopted a few years later by George Romero for ""Night of the Living Dead"".

Educational film veteran Frances Feist plays Mary's cherubic landlady and John Linden plays her slimy (on the make) neighbor. Both are excellent, and the disjointed and stilted acting style of their scenes with Hilligoss will remind many viewers of David Lynch's ""Eraserhead"".

The film starts with a drag race with a pair of young men running against three young women.  The car with the women goes off a bridge into the river and finally one of the women, Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss), crawls onshore.  After appearing to be fully recovered from the wreck, she leaves her Kansas town to work as an organist for a church in Utah.  While making this trip, she is haunted by a pale looking man who seems to be stalking her everywhere she goes.  In addition, Mary seems to be drawn to an abandoned resort by a lake near the town she is working in.  This sets up the remainder of the film where Mary has to come to grips of what her attraction is to this resort and who this ghoulish looking man is.

First off, I'm not a horror film buff, but I do recall seeing this movie on late night TV in the late 1960's as a kid and recall reading about it more recently as a highly recommended cult classic.  I stumbled across this Criterion DVD at a local Hollywood Video and decided to rent it mostly out of curiosity.  First off, it is clearly low budget and none of the characters are recognizable.  But I was impressed with the production quality for a film that cost only $30,000 to make in 1961, which is dirt cheap by Hollywood's standards at that time, and believe me, I've seen some real duds from the sixties with low cost independent films like ""Manos the Hands of Fate"" and many of those cheesy monster movies.  Most of the acting in this movie is respectable except for Mary Henry's neighbor played by Sidney Berger who comes off a little too wierd and over the top.  The story itself did nothing for me and if carefully scrutinized, the plot didn't make sense, but I enjoyed this film just to see how well a bunch of people with virtually no training in dramatic filmmaking pulled off a well-done production.  Also for nostalgic reasons, I liked watching the people, the cars and the surrounding atmosphere in this early 1960's small town movie.

The commentary by screenwriter John Clifford and director Herk Harvey is great for only the simple fact is that these guys had a dream and went after it and did it their way.  They also devote quite a bit about how they managed to do so much with so little money.  What's also more amazing is that most of the scenes were made with just one take.  I think any serious movie fan dreams about making their own movie, and it's a film like this that gives someone with some ambition and talent a lot of inspiration to make their own original project.

The DVD quality is near pristine.  The movie was restored but on occasion a few tiny specs of film deterioration could be observed.  The sharpness is just OK and the sound is very good.  There are plenty of extras in this double DVD package.  Personally, I can't see paying $36 for this DVD, but I recommend it for rental, especially if you enjoy independent, off-beat films like I do.

How does that happen? Sadly, it happens all the time.

(It happened to Judith O'Day, who appeared in the original Night of the Living Dead, and it happened to the gifted Marilyn Burns, who had the lead in the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Am totally baffled why these absolutely excellent actresses were never used again. I don't get it, and never will.

I mean nobody, BUT NOBODY HAS EVER TURNED IN A MORE POWERFUL FILM PERFORMANCE THAN MARILYN BURNS! Her turn as ""Sally"" simply fries your brain.

What does that tell you? Two things: Don't pay attention to  critics-- & it appears that those with the least amount of talent very often are praised to the sky.

181114,2,1559409002,"Carnival of Souls (Herk Harvey, 1962)

Herk Harvey's Carnival of Souls is your classic cult-hit B movie; it's terrible, but that it's terrible is half the fun of watching it.

The story concerns Mary Henry (stage actress Candace Hilligoss), who is the only survivor of a car full of women who lose control and veer off a bridge during a drag race. Wanting to get away from the scene of the accident and start a new life, she moves to, of all places, Utah to take a job as a church organist. She finds herself, however, plagued with hallucinations, fainting spells, and other such things that make her realize something is very wrong, while finding herself drawn to a long-abandoned carnival on the outskirts of town.

In order to really get at the entertainment value of this flick, you have to overlook a lot of things-- most notably, the painfully cheesy overacting. Hilligoss wanders through the film looking like a prototype of Nico (of The Velvet Underground and... fame), while her would-be suitor Sidney Berger (now director of the Houston Shakespeare Festival, so you have to figure the guy's got chops) hops around like a gerbil on benzedrine; Roger Ebert, in his original review, called Berger's character ""the definitive study of a nerd in lust.""

Director Herk Harvey, in his only production (!), shows himself to be a master of atmosphere.  There's not much to the story: after a near-death experience, a young woman (Candace Hilligoss) is stalked by ghosts.  She sometimes appears to become invisible to those around her and has a weird attraction to an abandoned resort out in the Utah desert.  I can imagine that this was the perfect drive-in movie; the images are of paramount importance and deliver an eerie experience without the necessity of distracting teenagers from their necking with the need to follow a story.  The film ends with a ""twist"" that is very passe today (and probably was in the 60s as well), but by this time Harvey has already delivered plenty of shivers.  Our heroine's mysterious end is a beautifully orchestrated black-and-white nightmare.

film maker Herk Harvey's lone entry into the commercial film

market, he managed to prove that a small budget could produce a

film that would somehow stand the test of time with a storyline that keeps you watching, without the gore, violence and overdone special effects of today's films.

This DVD is unique that it offers both the original Black and White version as well as a Colorized version, plus Mike Nelson's (of MST3K) optional commentary.

Candace Hilligoss gives a good performance as Mary Henry, a very bewildered and confused young lady who finally learns what her

ultimate fate is.

Berger as John Linden, the next door neighbor who also happens

to be the resident letch.

Adding much to the film were the many scenes shot at Saltair,

the then abandoned and damaged amusement park on the shore of the Great Salt Lake. Not only was Saltair, the inspiration for Herk

181117,5,1559409002,"Producer/director Herk Harvey's CARNIVAL OF SOULS (1962) is a brilliant and scary nightmare with an eerie organ score by Gene Moore and magnificent B&W photography by Maurice Prather.  Like a nightmare, it is a movie filled with eerie images and phantom characters who cannot be explained.  Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) survives a drag racing car crash in Lawrence, Kansas, then takes a job as a church organist.  She keeps seeing a pasty-faced ghoul in her rooming house that fellow boarder John Linden (Sidney Berger) does not see.  In a movie partly filmed in Lawrence and partly in Salt Lake City, Mary  finds herself drawn to the abandoned Saltair Pavillion amusement park on the salt flats.  A dream sequence-actually several sequences-has Mary present but neither seen nor heard in a department store and inside a bus depot.  But a bus is filled with ghouls for Mary, again a nightmare.  CARNIVAL OF SOULS climaxes with a terrifying and memorable dance macabre, with all of the ghouls dancing at Saltair's merry-go-round at night and Gene Moore's unforgettable organ music going nuts.  Is Mary Henry alive or also a phantom figure?  Did she really survive the car crash?  Who is The Man, as the head phantom ghoul is termed?  Harvey told a screening audience that there are a lot of things that happen at night, but cannot be explained in the light of day.  He was after ""the look of a [Ingmar]  Bergman and the feel of a [Jean] Cocteau.""  I have never seen a Cocteau movie; he made dream-like fairy tales.  And the film certainly does evoke the harsh B&W lighting and allegorical plots of Bergman.

I am reviewing the labor of love two disk Criterion DVD edition of CARNIVAL OF SOULS.  Disk one has a curious presentation of the edited version of the movie, running 78 minutes.  It played on the Deep South drive-in circuit in 1962, financed by a company (Herz-Lions) that went bankrupt.  Disk two has a restored and remastered 35mm print of the 83 minute Director's Cut, with very insightful commentary by producer/director Harvey and writer John Clifford.  The two men both worked for Centron Films in Lawrence, Kansas.  Raising $13,000 from local businesses in one weekend (!), Harvey shot his movie during a three week job hiatus with a drama student cast and a crew of six on location in Lawrence and at the Saltair Pavillion outside Salt Lake City.  The rest of the cast were local extras, approached by Harvey with a chat like, ""For $25 and an hour or so, can we borrow your store to make a movie?  You are the store manager and this actress here (Hilligoss) is unseen by you?""  He would approach strangers all over Lawrence and ask them if they would like to be in one scene of a movie playing themselves or a phantom ghoul for free or small change.  The town had fun!

 In the end, CARNIVAL OF SOULS got made for $13,000-plus $12 to pull a car out of a river and fix a broken fence.  But in 1962 no distributor knew what to do with an 80 minute B&W art film made in America, not Europe.  The movie was recut and booked, as I said above, on the southern drive-in circuit with something called THE DEVIL'S MESSENGER.  CARNIVAL faded fast from memory, without ever playing a walk-in theatrical engagement in the rest of the country.  But then something strange and wonderful happened.  CARNIVAL became a word-of-mouth cult classic from late night TV showings during the 1970's.  Fantasy and horror magazines wrote about it, film festivals begged to show it, and Siskel and Ebert reviewed it on TV.  Finally, in 1989, Herk Harvey, John Irving, and surviving cast members gathered in Lawrence's movie theater for a screening of the uncut movie.  This is all documented on disk two of this lovely Criterion set.

Ironically, as revealed on disk two, CARNIVAL OF SOULS was just one three-week gig for a writer (Clifford) and director (Harvey) who took a leave of absence from their jobs to make it.  Then Harvey edited the resulting movie after hours at Centron Films, where he and Clifford both worked.  Actually, Harvey joined Centron in 1947 and Clifford joined in 1960.  Harvey made a staggering 400 industrial and educational shorts over 35 years.  A slide presentation by Ken Smith, called CENTRON: HOLLYWOOD IN A LIKEABLE TOWN, documents the history of Centron and shows us five of the 400 films.  They range from job safety to juvenile delinquency to travelogues to personal hygiene.  During the 1950s and 1960s, Centron was a giant in producing short films for schools and businesses.  But Centron was slowly allowed to die in the mid 1970s after a company called Coronet bought them out to acquire a backlog of educational films.

Disk one for CARNIVAL OF SOULS takes us on a ""then and now"" tour of Lawrence and Saltair, and also gives us at least half an hour of Gene Moore's ghostly organ music over film outtakes.  In the end, we cut back to Harvey (who died in 1996) and Clifford (seemingly still alive).  ""It's nice to think our movie has that much hidden meaning and complexity.  What was our intention for this or that scene?  You are talking to two guys who can't  remember what they were doing last week.""  CARNIVAL OF SOULS is a masterpiece of the macabre, a real twilight zone nightmare, and certainly a must-see at Halloween season.  And Criterion, which admittedly is charging a lot more than other companies, has the finest print plus tons of interesting  bonus material.

181118,5,1559409002,"The special effects are cheesy. The ""surprise"" is no surprise. And yet this film holds the attention far better than most films with far fewer obvious klinkers and on far higher budgets.

The film's premise is the same as in ""Siesta"" and ""Sixth Sense"": the heroine is dead. She doesn't know she is dead. That premise is not obvious in ""Sixth Sense,"" becomes obvious in ""Siesta"" when the protagonist jumps from a roof, but is obvious here early in the film when she emerges out of nowhere from a muddy river after her car overturned and fell into it three hours earlier.

Our dubious heroine then embarks on a journey interrupted by visions of the dead and demented. Though thoroughly cheesy, the images of the un-dead are effective, and the owner of the boarding house looks as though she recently escaped from an asylum. The disorientation that the film-maker would have us associate with death is chilling. When the ""secret"" is revealed at film's end, the breathing of the two obviously living actresses is a welcome relief, and a fitting end to one of the best ""stinkers"" on film.

181124,5,1559409002,"""Carnival of Souls,"" the only theatrical film every directed by Herk Harvey, is a cult classic with a most deserved reputation that puts it almost on a par with dead George Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"" in terms of shoestring productions (In fact, the two films appear together on a recent DVD Double Feature).  There is a short list of black & white horror films made on the cheap that you should check out at some point (others would be ""Dementia 13"" and the original ""Little Shop of Horrors,"" although ""A Bucket of Blood"" is a better Roger Corman film).

Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) accepts a car ride from a group of other young girls, only to end up in a drag race that sees the car go over a bridge with only Mary surviving. Having taken a job as a church organist in Salt Lake City, Mary heads for her new home, passing a deserted pavilion on the outskirts of town. Mary is drawn to the ruined bathing center/carnival, but has bigger problems since she keeps seeing a leering, corpse-like man (played by Harvey) watching her. Again and again Mary has the eerie experience of suddenly finding herself in a silent world where no one seems to notice her. Eventually she returns to the pavilions to come to the terrifying realization of what has happened.

""Carnvial of Souls"" came about because Harvey drove by Saltair, the deserted 1940s tourist resort outside Salt Lake City, and decided it would make a powerful location for a horror film. Harvey recruited John Clifford to come up with a screenplay that would involve Harvey's image of dead bodies rising from the lake to pursue their victim. The finished product certainly evokes a nightmarish quality that makes you ignore the technical problems with overdubbing, campy performances by the supporting cast, and such. Hilligloss, trained in the Method by Strassberg but denied any hint of her character's motivation by the director (think about it), only made one other film, ""Curse of the Living Corpse"" (1964), but this film is enough to secure her reputation in the field.

Sidney Berger, the all too friendly guy down the hall at her boarding house, does a cameo as a cop in the 1998 ""Wes Craven Presents Carnival of Souls"" debacle, which does not compare on any level to this evocative horror classic. Given the high gloss shlock that is out there it is nice to see a horror film that is actually effective at creating a sense of unease without resorting to special effects.",1115683200,2,2447,4.7236533957845435
181125,5,1559409002,"One of the best things about Carnival of Souls is the way the sound and music create the film's atmosphere.  The first organ chords that open the film with shots of the river's murky surface foreshadow a later diegetic appearance of the same music.  The magnified sound of the boards of the fateful wooden bridge ratchet up the eeriness of the mood, and echo the distorted sound of Mary Henry's footsteps when, toward the end, in her last terrified flight through the town, the clacking of her heels on the street takes on a strange and unreal rhythm.

After the accident, we see Mary Henry from above, from the point of view of the crowd on the bridge.  She crawls out of the muddy water where the police have been dragging for the car, which had earlier plunged from the bridge.  This is the first of many times that she is viewed from an overhead angle.  The second time we see her from such a height is at the organ manufacturing warehouse, from the balcony where several of the workers, lured away from their various jobs as if hypnotized by her music, have gathered to see her practicing.  In this scene we learn that she is leaving for Salt Lake City to take a job as a church organist.  The installation supervisor wishes her luck, and tells her: Put your soul into it a little OK? (Spot the low-budget dialog, OK...?)

An interesting sound device occurs next in the car, en route to Salt Lake City.  We discover that the music we hear is not coming from the radio as we had thought, because as she turns the dials, nothing happens.  The source of the music appears puzzling to her as well.  Hilligoss is stunning here - crazy-eyed, her face in ECU lit by otherworldly light.

 The film was made in 1962, and so we never see a pack of Marlboros or a can of Pepsi.  But when Mary Henry arrives at the rooming house in Salt Lake City and we meet the landlady, Mrs. Thomas, she happens to be carrying a can of Ajax - quite amusing!

Most of the scenes are tense as Mary is often in claustrophobic spaces: inside her car, or with the cloying Mr. Linden, the neighbor, who continually forces into her space with his hands, face, and body.  Later, the minister too crowds her in the blocked area behind the organ.  The first peaceful scene is the one where she first visits the abandoned fairground, which inexplicably draws her.  Again we see her from high above when she enters the pavilion.

Probably the most important scene in the film occurs when Mary visits the empty church to practice.  She starts out with all the correct organ music, pauses to look at her hands as if they don't belong to her, and resumes.  But now the music changes.  It becomes the haunted carnivalesque score building on what we'd heard briefly in the opening scene.  Gene Moore is credited with the music, and it's superb!  Has anything been written anywhere about this?  (Did it influence the opening of Led Zeppelin's ""Your Time is Gonna Come""?)  She's become one with the organ, and we see her bare feet floating over the pedals, rows of choir robes shiver disembodied on their hangers, we see images of clouds over the moon then reflected in the water, saints frozen in the stained glass, and dancers in the pavilion in compressed time.  I think this is really an amazing cinematic moment!  It ends when the minister bursts on this scene, horrified.  He's heard all this, and shrieks: Profane! Sacrilege! He blurts out that he pities her for her ""lack of soul"" and instantly banishes her from the church, firing her from her job as church organist forever.

There is a particularly sublime shot in the film to watch for. It occurs in the scene of Mary Henry's final visit to the pavilion.  There is a long shot of the ballroom dancers in the dark pavilion, embracing and motionless, entangled with the long dangling streamers.  This is count one.  Counts two, three, and four occur like this: the strings of lights illuminate, the music starts, and the dancers begin.  The lights, the music, and the motion occur with a cadence so deliberate and careful as though counted out by metronome, and as if to suggest that everything will happen in order, as it should.  No need to hurry, no need to run.  This time we see Mary from a low angle, the sky behind her instead of the ground.",1112227200,14,4268,4.517601043024772
181126,5,1559409002,"I remember seeing this on TV in the 1970s and the final scene shot at Saltair in Salt Lake City is a classic of camp horror that seeps into your subsonscious.  With a motivation of nostalgia I attended the revived film festival screening in 1989.

  ""Carnival of Souls"" has become a cult classic and this 2 disc DVD contains everything you could possibly want to know about the film and then some.  How director Herk Harvey got the original idea based on the Saltair locale, and how John Clifford wrote the script.  As a low budget film it succeeds on many levels, the story being a version of the '40s Mercury Theater episode ""The Hitchhiker"" and the '50s Twilight Zone treatment.  Candace Hilligoss was a Lee Strasberg method actor when she got the offer to star in this film set in Lawrence, Kansas and Salt Lake City, Utah.  She was paid $2000, the only member of cast or crew to see any real money from the original film.

  The amateurishness of certain aspects of the film also are part of its charm.  The beginning uses voiceovers that are completely out of synch and you can see the car is empty as it goes over the bridge, but when the lead character Mary comes up on shore after the car/bridge accident the otherworldly feel of the film starts to take over.  The gothic pipe organ building
sets the atmosphere, and as she makes her way to Salt Lake City the ghoul (Herk Harvey) starts to appear.  Also of interest is the in town scenes where we get a good glimpse of 1961 street scenes.  One scene doesn't quite gel with the rest of the film, namely the scene where Mr. Berger (John Linden) brings Mary coffee in the morning.  She is so bubbly with dialogue such as, ""You're just what I needed this morning"", that she seems a completely different character than that in the rest of the film.  But as the ghoul keeps appearing and she keeps getting drawn to the carnival the scenes of mysteriousness that make this a great film get underway.  The Saltair building scenes are classic, an abandoned dance hall and amusement park full of ghoulish ghosts.  The fast-motion dancing ghouls and the end where they run past and jump up in front of the camera predate the same feel of Night of the Living Dead by 7 years.  As Mary wanders through the abandoned park, the true atmospheric essence comes to the fore.

  Much can be read into the theme of someone caught in a dimension between life and death, from the quantum theory of Schoedinger's Cat to the Many Worlds theory to ideas of purgatory, etc.  However as the writer admits the deeper aspects were not considered by him.  In the many world's theory we die in one dimension, but not in another.  If the dimensions overlap the death dimension can influence and change the life one.

  A few things to watch for:  When Hilligoss is running from the ghouls at the end she is happily smiling the whole time.  At the end you can see how the girls in the car, supposedly dead, are twitching (look for the middle one twitching her eyes)...then again they were in cold water.  Its weird because in an outtake scene they are not moving.  The priest fires Mary because her playing is ""profane"".  Well the playing doesn't really sound profane to me, and either way it's not a convincing reason to fire someone.  In the DVD outtakes we get some good extra scenes of the ghouls in the bathhouse, and some extra footage of Mary wandering through Saltair.  If you're into 1960s horror films with substance and atmosphere, this is at the top of the list.",1112054400,3,3500,4.508744038155803
181127,5,1559409002,"Well, I'm a pretty serious horror fan, I think, but I  lean heavily towards modern stuff.  I have some theoretical interest in pre-Night of the Living Dead horror cinema, but defintely not as much as I have for the post-NOTLD stuff, and I really haven't gotten around to seeing much pre 70's work.  Sure, I've seen pretty much all your classic Universal films at some time or another, though most of them so long ago that I couldn't really tell you how much I'd like them now.  Other than that, I haven't really seen a whole lot other than what you see on MST3K.(Which actually comes out to quite a few cheap old horror movies, even if they aren't in their original or intended form)  And, those films aren't too encouraging, naturally, though they aren't meant or expected to be. (Though I do rather like 'The Screaming Skull')  Despite all that, I was very interested in seeing this film since the first time I heard about it.  Fortunately, it didn't disappoint.  Certainly, not everyone in a modern audience is gonna be able to get into a film this old and cheap, but some if your the sorta person who can you shouldn't hesitate to check this out.

The basic setup is that our protagonist, Mary, is in a tragic drag racing accident, where her car is dumped off a bridge into a river.  Still, she seems unscathed by the incident, and goes on with her life, moving to Utah and becoming a church organist.(Funny, I didn't think that Utah existed in Movieland, or pretty much any of the south west or mountain west, other than an endless, nameless desert, perhaps inhabited by cannibals. Admittedly, it is mostly just endless desert, but we've got cities and lights and running water and all that.)  Things seem to be generally okay, except that she is haunted by strange visions of a desiccated, mysterious man(inspiration for the Tallman, I'll bet) eerie music, as well as other bizarre occurrences.  While reading about 'Carnival of Souls' I constantly here it compared to the 'Twilight Zone'.  This is not without good reason, as it does feel very much like that show. (Whether or not you enjoy 'The Twilight Zone' is perhaps the best test of whether or not you'll like this film.  Personally, I love it.)  As a matter of fact, the final revelation basic nature of this film are pretty much identical to that an early (and classic) 'Twilight Zone' episode.  Some may claim it's stolen, I dunno, but it doesn't really matter.  The film has some very good ideas of it's own, most of which are more interesting then the basic revelation of the film.

This film was definitely made on the cheap, something like 30,000 dollars, so you certainly aren't gonna see anything fancy, even by early 60's standards.  Still, it is competently made, with a very eerie, shapeless yet somehow still melodic organ score, and some striking visuals.  Scenes of ghoulish individuals rising from a lake or dancing about a deserted pavilion are particularly affecting, as is the apparent head ghoul, played by the films director, Herk Harvey.  In fact, pretty much all of the scare tactics used in this film are pretty cool, though I don't want to hurt it by going into any more specifically. The performances do tend to be pretty amateurish, but that rarely matter all that much in horror films, this one included.  They also appear to be trying to portray particularly banal, lifeless individuals, which makes their performances less of a concern.  The landscape, though shown relatively little, is quite effective, as it isn't gorgeous or lively, just cold and ugly and dead, which is, naturally, fitting to the tone of the movie.

The film isn't without  a few flaws.  First of all, Herk Harvey's character randomly appears maybe 2 too many times I think.  Also, the climax is less effective, as it often is when atmospheric films finally start to have something actually happen.  Still, it is very enjoyable as a whole.  Not a scary film, but a fairly eerie one much of the time, provided you are willing and capable of getting into it.  Perhaps a full-on five star rating is slightly generous, but this is about as good as I could hope for a horror film of this sort to be, so I'll let it stand.",1108771200,4,4181,4.672131147540983

One can understand how some  may say it's one of those 'so bad it's good' films but I think it is not really that bad. In fact the concept was great: a woman who dies in a car crash wanders the Earth in search of her soul, pursued by a dead man-apparently. The car radio only plays weird organ music; on the horizon she sees a haunting looking carnival dance hall ( or in her mind's eye); she gets sacked for her 'lack of soul' when playing the organ at a church; she has weird experiences at every turn; she can't connect with people and seems dissociated. Eventually her dead pursuer lures her to the abandoned carnival where she joins in the dance of the dead. No explanations, no blood and gore required, no mushy love interests, no high profile actors all adds to the haunting flavour. This movie has all the ingredients of something special but, sadly, on second look it falls well short of what I remember as an eerily haunting film in my youth.

181131,4,1559409002,"""Carnival of Souls"" is an odd, Twilight Zone-like movie in which a heady atmosphere compensates for an exceptionally uneven presentation. Yes, I know you've heard that about many other horror films, but ""Carnival of Souls"" is one of the few times where such a description is warranted. It's the atmosphere of the film - best likened to an eerie fever dream, that made ""Carnival of Souls"" a cult film. The often skillful black and white cinematography turns the often mundane - even banal - locations seem mysterious and even sinister. This doesn't turn the movie into a classic winner, but it does help explain why a public domain movie like this is still remembered today.

Virtually the entire running time of ""Carnival of Souls"" is devoted to a moody young church organist (Candace Hilligoss) obsessed with a ruined amusement park not far from her church. Her odd behavior justifiably confuses her sleazy, wannabe boyfriend and as the film progresses her breaks with reality are more and more disjointed. This isn't a standard B-movie stocked full of scares, but a consistently odd, unnerving film. The ending, if anything is anticlimatic. Several scenes in which the organist is being pressured by her boyfriend (Sydney Berger) are actually far scarier than any of the supernatural elements in the film.

The Criterion DVD also includes generous documentaries, galleries, and a ""director's cut"" which share more than you need to know about this film. It pushes my rating of the film from 3 stars to four. It's nice to see a B-movie given this respect. However . . .

The main problem with the Criterion DVD is that, no matter how you frame it, this _is_ a DVD of an obscure, uneven B-movie. The cheezy electric, whirling organ score is only occassionally effective and there's little attempt to have Hilligoss mime convincingly to the music on those scenes when she is the organist. Most of the supporting actors are downright terrible, and the film's pacing drags at times. This isn't an ""art movie"" no matter what the pretensions of its creators. To be charged nearly 40 dollars for it (even though it has extras and is restored)is a bit excessive, not to mention insulting. If you're a purist, buy a used copy. If you're just want a copy of the film for your collection, there are plenty of other, more inexpensive, versions around, including a colorized one.",1099353600,26,2366,4.880597014925373
181132,4,1559409002,"The opening credits of CARNIVAL OF SOULS appear on the screen across a turbulent body of water. This symbolic image is augmented by a haunting score of organ music.  Then the action begins.  Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) is the passenger in a vehicle with some female friends.  A car full of boys challenges the girls to a drag race through the country and it's off to the races. The speeding chase comes to an end when the girls' care accidently swerves off the bridge into the rushing, high-water river below. Hours later as the river is dragged and witnesses are question, Mary climbs out of the river. She is covered in mud, scraped up a little, and chilled from the water. She is alive, but the accident has wiped away her memory of how she escaped.

A week later, Mary moves away from her hometown and begins a cross-country drive to Salt Lake City, Utah where she has accepted a job as an organist in a small church.  During the drive, she is almost involved in another accident as she sees the face of a pale, death-like man appear in her window. She also becomes strangely intrigued by a closed Carnival Pavillion on the outskirts of the city. Mary soon settles into her new life, but begins seeing the pale man more frequently. She becomes obsessed with the closed and condemned carnival building outside of town and like the frightening man, the carnival begins to haunt her sleeping dreams and waking thoughts. Soon Mary experiences a phenomena where she cannot hear any sounds except the ones she makes and where other people seem oblivious to her prescence.  Mary is an excellent organist, an attractive woman, and a colorful individual but she is told by the preacher at her church, the neighbor next door who lusts after her body, and a counselor who listens to her problems that she seems to have lost her soul.  As the organ music picks up tempo, Mary's life snowballs out of control leading to a horrifying confrontation and bitter realization at the Carnival.

CARNVIAL OF SOULS was released in 1962 and was made on a shoe-string budget.  Along with the later 1968 film, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, CARNIVAL OF SOULS established the framework and set the foundation for the modern day horror movie.  Most of the acting in the movie is standard for a low-budget scary movie, though Hilligoss' performance stands out as a rare exception.  Hilligoss had some talent and it would have been interesting to see her in more movies (she only acted in one other movie besides CARNIVAL OF SOULS). The sets are scenery are pretty standard fare and nowadays the plot has been overly done, though in 1962 it was a fairly fresh and original idea.  Besides Hilligoss' acting and a few starkly vivid images, the other standout component of the movie is the score.  Organ music usually doesn't work very well as a movie score, especially in scary movies. However, the music in CARNIVAL OF SOULS is a key element in establishing the mood and tone of the movie. It's something to remember and like those catchy little advertisement jingles, can haunt one's musical memory for days.

Not everyone will enjoy CARNIVAL OF SOULS and many will find it quite cheesy today. Nevertheless, for movie and horror buffs, the film is worth watching for its cinematic legacy and cult appeal.",1098662400,,3277,4.716287215411558
181133,4,1559409002,"i was pretty into candace hiligoss in this movie.  hot babe!  the organ score in this movie really rules.  seeing candace organ ""sync""-ing throughout the movie is a corny yet pleasureable sight.  the organ score gives you two simultaneous feelings, first one of the sacred,the church, and the other of the carnival, somewhat bawdy and profane.  it was a very brilliant twist to have the lead charactor as an organist, because this duality carries the vibe of the whole movie.  it's really hilarious in the scene where she's jamming at the church to practice the hymns, and then she gets overtaken by the spirits or whatever and starts getting into some dark twisted carnival organ.  the spirits ""take over"" her fingers and she starts jamming evil organ in the church.

even though this movie seemed to tense out my girlfriend, i can't say i found it scary.  it's full of atmosphere, due mainly to candace's weird and kinda bad acting, the great organ music, and the wonderful setting of the amusement park pavillion on the lakeside.

the atmosphere is what'll attach you to it.",1098230400,6,1077,4.804347826086956
181134,5,1559409002,"The sound was horrible in this film. The acting seemed like it was done by high school students. The score was unneeded. The direction was horrible. Nothing was explained.

I loved this film.

I know, many of you are probably wondering why I loved a film that denounces everything I feel is needed in a film, but for some odd reason in this film it worked. This was a very scary movie. Not the kind of scary that you need blood or violence to make you jump, but the kind that the violins seemed to shrill your way to behind a pillow. I was really impressed that this film was released in 1962.  I would put money down that if this film were to be released today it would do really well.

As I watched this film, I made the comment that this could very well have been a Mystery Science Theater 3000 film.  There were certain elements to it that I could see Joel or the bots just making fun of.  So, in that sense, I am glad that I didn't see the film with those guys commenting through it, I may not have enjoyed it as much.  This was a film full of symbolism, of imagination, and of surprises.  I loved the way that Mary went from real life to when people couldn't hear or see her.  It showed that something supernatural was at work instead of just some crazy guy following her around. The carnival was spooky.  This is one of those films that you would put on at Halloween with a great bottle of wine and your best girl by your side.

Without giving too much away, I enjoyed how this film came to it's conclusion.  As the visions of the phantom man became greater and greater, it was obvious that the cops were getting closer and closer to finding the car.  I also enjoyed the fact that the ""undead"" of the film all came out of water to be reborn.  It was great foreshadowing to what would happen to Mary.

The director took many risks with the symbolism that he used, and it worked better than some films with today's CGI abilities.  You could tell as you watched this film that imagination was flowing with the writer of this film.  It proved that even without a budget you could make a film that would last the test of time, and even be remade over and over again. The surprises were easy, but fun.  I saw the ending of this film coming a mile away, but it still kept my attention.

Overall, this film is like a great wine.  Imagine opening a bottle of merlot from 1962 and having the whole afternoon to enjoy it.  That is how I feel about this film.  A definite for anyone to have in their collection!!

181135,3,1559409002,"This is a classic horror movie from 1962 filmed in Kansas, and at an abandoned theme park on the Great Salt Lake in Utah, ""Saltair."" There is now a colorized DVD available from Off-Color Films featuring a commentary track by Mike Nelson. I recommend the version with the commentary for vastly improved entertainment value.

The film itself is actually modestly creepy. It stars Candace Hilligoss as a schizophrenic, antisocial church organist with a major spiritual dilemma being taunted by beings from beyond the grave, led by Zombie-In-Chief, and also Director, Herk Harvey (famous for making many Centron educational shorts like ""Industrial Arts"" and ""Juvenile Delinquency."")

The plot is straightforward, and I won't reveal it here, but it involves drag racing, otherworldly (if not possessed) organ playing, and the creepiest boarding house in film history. The Off-Color DVD has several extras including the original trailer. I thought the movie was a tad better than Mike Nelson did, but while perhaps groundbreaking in 1962, it is tame if not boring in today's world. It is generally a credible effort with some genuine spookiness despite its dated appearance.

As an aside, the film makers decided on a soundtrack that was solo organ music, and the droning, buzzing noodling on the organ is extremely annoying in a very short while. It was evidently scored and performed by an organist who had not yet learned to play the organ.",1094688000,6,1437,5.132478632478633

181139,4,1559409002,"Carnival of Souls was made on a shoe-string budget by industrial filmmaker Herk Harvey and stars the enigmatic and beautiful Candace Hilligoss as the lead character who manages to be constantly isolated from everyone around her.  There are so many excellent transitions and shots in the movie it was obvious that who ever put it together had been an excellent film editior at the very least.  As the film has been extensively reviewed here I want to focus on the DVD releases.  Aside from the original cut of the film, 82 minutes, there where several prints that had been trimmed down both by the director and perhaps for TV although I have seen the complete film on cable as well as edited versions.  The Image ""movie-only"" release (by the way Image also co-produced the Criterion Collection release) has the complete version of the movie and best print that I have seen.  There is an active menu with some of the spooky organ music with icons for chapters and the films trailer.  At first I thought the icon for ""recommendations"" was just a link to a one page marketing promo.  However, if you click on the title boxes you get a trailer for each of the other Image releases shown.  Quite a nice little ""Easter Egg""!
  I am glad I have the other versions as well because I think the edited prints are also interesting.  The Alpha Video version actually has a slightly higher bit rate than the Image edition and only a tiny amount of pixelization here and there detracts from a very sharp picture, it clocks in at 77 minutes and is a great bargain.  The Diamond DVD release has an identical running time, but a lower bit rate and still some pixelization in a couple of scenes.  However considering that you get a copy of 1960's ""Horror Hotel"" with Christopher Lee included it is a great buy for just a few bucks.  Curiously, the Diamond edition ""Carnival of Souls/""Horror Hotel"" is supposedly out of print yet I found a copy in a store recently and got another new copy on-line for my little brother's collection.  Goodtimes has released ""Carnival of Souls"" with a high bit rate and sharp picture but a few more skips and pops.  Also, the running time is the shortest, 75 minutes, as it cuts out a couple more scenes such as when Candace Hilligoss stops for gas and directions entering Salt Lake City.  However, my Goodtimes edition is a two sided disc with ""Carnival"" on one side and a decent print of ""Night of the Living Dead"" on the other.  For those of you who don't like two sided discs, Goodtimes has also released both films seperately for just a few bucks each.  Criterion Collection has released the utlimate edition with two cuts of the film and loads of extras including a commentary.  However, it you are on a budget you do have other options.  So make some popcorn and enjoy the show.  Thanks, CAL",1089936000,7,2811,4.568862275449102
181140,4,1559409002,"Carnival of Souls is the horror movie Albert Camus might have made.  It's a lot like George Romero's original Night of the Living Dead - -  black and white, low-budget, a simple horror story that's really about human beings' isolation in their own skins.
The acting ensemble in Romero's film is consistently better, but Carnival of Souls only has one real character, and Candace Hilligoss as Mary is very good.  It's probably only her performance that has kept this movie around for over forty years.
It's 1962 in a small town, and two young guys in a hot rod and three young women in another car are drag racing.  They get to the bridge outside of town, finally going fast enough to feel alive when . . .
. . . Mary crawls out of the river, covered in mud, the only female survivor.  The other two girls paid the price for giving in to the thrill of the boys' challenge.
Seemingly unaffected (almost in the clinical sense of being without affect), Mary follows her plan to go to another small town where she's been hired as a church organist.  She doesn't believe in the church, though; she's a musician and playing the organ is just a job.
Mary's drive to her new town is the scariest bit of filmmaking I've seen in a long time.
Trying to settle into her new life, Mary starts to crack up.  Besides seeing an apparition connected to an old ruined carnival, Mary is suddenly unable to hear the people around her.
Three men say they want to help her - - a would-be boyfriend who's only interested in sex and leaves her when she lets her despair show, a doctor who violently shakes her and orders her to his office for his expert help, and the minister she works for who fires her when something possesses her and she ""profanes"" his church with carnival music.  Love, science, and God all fail her.
If Mary had only been able to hang on for five or ten years, maybe she would have found more satisfying work, or support from other women, or been stronger herself.  In 1962 Mary felt the nothingness eating her alive, but she couldn't see a way out in time.  She lost the race.",1086739200,11,2075,4.408376963350785
181141,5,1559409002,"Even being a fan of horror films, I never knew about this great film until the mid-90's.  The Sci-Fi Channel was having nightly film festivals in October leading up to Halloween and when I saw the promo for Carnival of Souls, it gave me chills.  The next night I watched (and taped) it, and have viewed it many, many times since.
Nothing conveys terror like atmosphere and things barely seen.  Director Herk Harvey, whose previous film experience was almost entirely in industrial films, captured these important aspects perfectly.  In the supplemental materials on the Criterion DVD, he explains how the sight of the old Salt Lake bath house became the base for this film.  When you see the old bath house, it is at a distance at first, in the evening, draped in shadows.  You wonder ""What is in there?  Is it empty?  Or could something else be there that shouldn't be?""
In the film, Mary Henry (played by Candace Hilligoss) is the sole survivor of an auto accident.  Afterwards she leaves Kansas to take a job in Salt Lake City, Utah.  As she nears Salt Lake, she sees, in the distance, the shadowy hulk of an old pavilion on the lakeshore.  She begins seeing images of a pale faced man (played by director Harvey) appearing and disappearing outside her car, in her boarding house, outside her window, etc.  The film deals with her attempts to come to terms with this vision, her sanity, her brush with death, and what role the old building (a former bath house, carnival, and dance hall) has to do with it all.
The film looks crisp and clear, even in night scenes.  No surprise, also, that it has an industrial film feel to it at times.  The acting is good, but not great.  Then again the occasional stiffness of some characters adds to Mary Henry's feeling of disconnect with the living world.  The townspeople have barely more life in them than the pale ""zombies"" that rise from the lake.  Mary's job as a church organist allows for a soundtrack full of pipe organ music that morphs from inspirational to horrific.  It is quite effective and adds to the already dreamlike quality that oozes from the film.
The Criterion DVD comes with 2 discs including the original director's cut and the theatrical versions.  Extras include a booklet, a photo gallery and history of the bath house, and a panel interview at a convention featuring Herk Harvey (wearing his ghostly make-up no less!), Candace Hilligoss, and Sidney Berger, who played Mary Henry's (...) drunken neighbor.
People spend millions, even hundreds of millions of dollars trying to scare you, and almost always fail.  Carnival of Souls succeeds and on a tiny budget.  There is a reason that this small film from 1962 is still a cult favorite today.  It works.  It's scary.  It will creep you out.  Buy it, rent it, just watch it!",1080518400,9,2792,4.683778234086242
181142,5,1559409002,"Carnival of Souls is a movie made, apparently, almost on a whim by two men who never made another feature film and stars an actress who was only in one other minor movie. With that sort of background, the rather unique finished product is maybe not so surprising. What is very surprising is that the movie turned out as well as it did.
Some of the other reviews have compared it to the twilight zone, and that is maybe the closest thing. They are from the same time period and have overlapping themes. The plotting for Carnival, though, is loose and leaves you wondering if there was a point -something you could almost never say about the twilight zone. Is it, like another reviewer stated, a hyper literal portrayal of a woman rejecting all the things that make life worth while and becoming an actual lost soul? I don't know that the movie lets us know enough about Mary to come to that conclusion. (Maybe it's all just a dramatized depiction of an undead beauracrat correcting a paperwork mistake.)
Plot, I don't think, is what this movie should stand or fall on.
Atmosphere seemed to take precedence with the film's creators(the director, Herk Harvey, told his writer, John Clifford, that he didn't care what he wrote about, except that he wanted to make a movie that had dead people dancing under the Saltair dome).  From this point of view, I think, the movie is very successful. Carnival effectivly creates a tone of strangeness and dread that is sustained almost throughout it's length. It reminded me much more of the silent film, Nosferatu, than any modern horror movie (the nearly omnipresent pipe organ score might have something to do with that).
Candace Hilligloss, who plays the main character, Mary, does an excellent job in her role as a brittle, eccentric young woman, right down to the hand and body movements. She also has the perfect looks for the part; doe eyed and blond, with long, pale hands that look like they were made for playing music (a church pipe organ, in this instance). It's a pity she wasn't in more movies (she, rather admirably, retired from films to raise her children). Another good actor who went on to do really nothing else on the big screen, Sidney Berger, has the only other very important speaking role in the film. He's also does quite well in a very unsympathetic part as Mary's slimy neighbor.
There's one scene in this movie that really sticks in mind; the one where Mary visits the deserted interior of Saltair for the
first time. The scene has no real action, aside from Mary just walking around, but it's effect is quite eery ( it concludes in an utterly sinister shot, which may possibly have been what Peter Jackson was thinking of in the dead marshes sequence of The Two Towers). What I believe this scene trades on is the strangeness, the unwholesome sensation that comes of being alone in a large, festive, public place. A personal experience of mine which parallels this scene -I'm certain it's part of why this movie had such an effect on me-  is my memory of walking around the desserted ruins of the massive, domed Baden Springs luxury resort in Indiana (it's since been gloriously restored, apparently) when I was a kid back in the 80's. I've never quite forgotten the lonely and desolate sensation it inspired.
Having said all that, I don't believe it's a perfect movie by any means. There's bad acting from bit players, at least a few near camp moments, mostly at the beginning (I was nearly expecting, was almost afraid, that the deadly drag race at the start of the movie would veer into a wooden PSA from some beefy sheriff). I think how much of an impact this movie has on you will depend on when you watch it, who you watch it with (watch it alone), and whether you will allow yourself to get caught up in it's mood. There's no real violence, nothing that will involuntarily repulse you. If you want to give it the MST3K treatment, parts of the movie will certainly lend itself to that, or if you sit in front of the television, cross your arms and determine not to let this film get to you, then I think you will very probably stand up unfazed. Speaking personally, I think there are a number of things that I'll never quite look at again in the same light, after seeing this picture.",1079740800,7,4257,4.6

On the second disc, there is a director's cut of the film, including some scenes not even shown on the VHS ""director's cut"" editions. One scene that is most notably absent from the original
is the scene where the priest talks to the church carpenter about how strange Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) is.

A woman named Mary (the stunning Candace Hilligoss) and her friends decide to drag race with a carload of guys. The girls are forced over the side of a very narrow bridge, plunging into the lake below. Mary rises from the depths, covered in mud, the sole survivor. Or is she? She moves to Utah where she gets a job playing the pipe organ in a church. Slowly, bizarre things start happening. She keeps seeing a sinister looking man -known only as ""the man"" (played by director Herk Harvey)-, first in her car window. Then, all over the place! She also slips in and out of a sort of dream state, wherein no one notices or hears her talking to them. Mary is also obsessed with an abandoned carnival she drove past. The atmosphere grows creepier by the minute! Is she alive? Dead? Somewhere in between? Candace Hilligoss only did one other film in her career (CURSE OF THE LIVING CORPSE by Del Tenney). In my opinion, this is to Hollywood's shame! She is brilliant in SOULS! Buy this classic immediately... UPDATE (7-9-17)- Well, since amazon has, once again, lumped a bunch of movies together, they've put my old review for the original black and white version of CARNIVAL OF SOULS w/ the colorized version. So, I'll review that too! Obviously, it's the same classic film. Does the colorizing add to, or subtract anything from the experience? Firstly, the color looks pretty consistent, almost as if it had been originally released in color. Ms. Hilligoss looks great! Her flesh tones are smooth and her beautiful eyes are bright green. The organ pipes, and the stained glass in the church are perfect. To be honest, the scenes I was most concerned about, were Mary's initial sighting of the CARNIVAL, as well as her dark, creepy encounters w/ the various ghouls. I was afraid that color might take away from the overall atmosphere of dread / doom. I'm happy to report that these scenes retain their eerie, macabre nature, even in color! As for the ghastly denizens of the night, in particular ""the man"", they are every bit as frightening. In fact, ""the man"" benefits from some greenish tint to his pasty face, adding a cadaverous hue. His ""under water"" sequence is actually better! He really looks dead! As for the ""dance hall"" segment, it's just as effective. Perhaps, even more so!

Despite the low budget and poor film quality, this 1962 masterpiece stands as a cult more than 40 years after it's release. Candice Hilligoss' fine performance will overwhelm you as she portrays a character caught in a purgatory between life and death. Her beauty alone will strike the viewer in a way few actresses can. Her physical acting, facial gestures, and line delivery will leave you wondering why this woman did not become a household name like Marilyn Monroe or Raquel Welch.
The story is as simple as it is complex. A woman is an innocent passenger in a car that gets into a drag race with some teenage thugs. The result is her car going over a bridge into a fast running, sandy river. As she crawls out of the wreckage covered in mud, the viewer thinks she has survived, but has she?
Ms. Hilligoss' character is a musician, an organist to be exact who takes a job as a church organist in Salt Lake City, Utah. As she begins her journey she is terrified of images of a phantom of sorts who seems to be seeking her out. Anyone who has driven for an average of twelve hours straight can tell you that driving can take its toll, and the mind can play tricks on a sleepy driver. However, after she checks into her room, she finds the same phantom lurking in the window, then in the hallway. Who is this creature, what does he want, where is he from?
The main point of the film is not horror, but human nature. Are we all alone in this world? Is everyone an island unto themselves. The lesson is thrown upon our character by a minister, a psychologist, and a would be male suitor. They all try to help her in their own way (except the suitor who is only interested in her for a chance to have sex). But our character waves a hand at them all, convinced that she can do it her own way. She is an independent woman who needs no man or companionship; a view that may have gone against society's thinking in 1962.
The male suitor (or 'just your normal guy' as he likes to call himself) is an obnoxious oaf to say the least. His headstrong pursuit of her is only his own selfish desire to have her. He's not an alcoholic he claims, yet he drinks at dawn. He quit college because he doesn't like to learn. This is not an ideal resume for a long term relationship for her or any other woman. When she is truly frightened by the visiting spectre, and she reaches out to him as a last resort for help, he runs. Not wanting to get involved, he was only interested in her for her body and his own sexual desire. Yet another lesson in this film for all the young ladies who care to pay attention.
As the story goes on Candace's soul seems to deteriorate. She slips in and out of reality and a strange sort of parallel world. This dimension looks the same as real life, but she cannot be seen or heard. The department store dressing room for example, shows how the lost spirit must learn that she is no longer of this world, but now belongs in the spirit world, where yet another companion awaits her.
Who is this man that haunts her in visions? We see at the end of the film that they are to be together forever. In the final seen where we see Candace's peek at her after-life. She screams in horror as the ghosts dance eternally as the haunt the carnival. She is finally captured by the ghosts and is spirited away. The police and minister are confused and baffled as her footprints and final body print leads nowhere. The minister gives a knowing look as if he has known all along, but says nothing.
The minister must have known there was something wrong with his new organist when he first met and eventually fired her. She had not the soul of a musician, she only had a knowledge for music. She was told this too by the organ builder in the beginning of the film. When she is possessed in the church and her true musician ship comes out as she plays without control, that is her true spirit, but the misinster fires her for 'blasphony'.
This film cannot be watched once and dismissed. It deserves to be watched over and over again. It is a timeless movie where something seems new every time you watch it. I applaud you 'Carnival of Souls'. One of the greatest movies ever made.",1064707200,15,4259,4.331664580725907

When she begins seeing a mysterious tall man and experiencing moments of non-existence, she starts to fear that she is trapped between the world of the dead and the world of the living. ""Carnival of Souls"" was made on a shoestring budget, but still remains to give me the creeps with its spooky organ music and otherworldy performances and direction.

The acting and direction etc. were pretty average but somehow it didn't seem to matter. It was the way the story unfolded that left the mark. Probably best seen without knowing the plot but I will still be getting this one because, in its own way, it is memorable.

181157,5,1559409002,"YOUR REVIEWERS NEED TO DO THEIR HOMEWORK.  I originally saw this film in SLC about 3 years after it was made.  The river may have been in Lawrence, Kansas, but the other scenes are in SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH and at the SALTAIR RESORT on the Great Salt Lake.  The scenes at the 'carnival pavillion' are of the SALTAIR ballroom and amusement park.  My parents met at a dance there in 1934 when the lake was still high but a small train ride was needed to reach the shore for bathing. Originally you just walked down the stairs to the water.  Later the pavillion, still on the original pilings (shown in the next to last scene) was just used as an amusement park.  I rode their huge roller coaster in 1956. The lake continued to receed, the roller coaster was blown down  twice by high winds and eventually the place was closed.  At the time this film was made, my high school friends and I used to sneak in and explore the condemned site. The 'prarie' referred to by one reviewer is in fact the Salt Flats and old beach area.  I saw this film when one of several efforts to raise money for restoring SALTAIR was in progress.  Arsonists burned the place down eventually. It was a stunninly beautiful place with one of the most beautiful ballrooms of the Victorian Era. We felt it as a huge loss of a city landmark.
Other scenes are in downtown SLC: the church where the heroine plays is an Episcopal church where my best friend got married, the water fountain scene is on the grounds of the City and County Building, NOTE the VERY WIDE STREETS! Salt Lake is known for them.  Many of the buildings shown still stand like ZCMI dept. store where the dress scene is taken (you can make out the letters set into the pavement as she exits the store) and Ron Wilson (the tire place with the mechanic) had a Chevrolet Dealership too,  the Union Station (train scene) stands but I'm not certain about the Grayhound Depot (the spot where I departed from SLC 30 years ago (though I return for several visits a year.)
I loved ""Carnival"" when I first saw it and I love it now for both the sites and the story. Which, by the way, recalls Ambrose Bierce's ""Incident at Owl Creek Bridge"", the French film of which was first aired in the US on The Twilight Zone around the time this film was made.",1057276800,5,2274,4.362559241706161
181158,5,1559409002,"This is a really fantastic movie. The tone is very spooky and the cinematography is great, as well as the haunting organ score. What struck me most is that the lead actress, Candace Hilligoss, is a dead ringer for Gwyneth Paltrow; the resemblance is both physical and in her mannerisms. Any Paltrow fans would appreciate seeing this. It's freaky! I am surprised Hilligoss didn't make other movies; she's a great actress and perfect for the role. The abandoned pavilion location (Saltair Resort) is fascinating. The history of the location is as spooky and interesting as the movie itself!

This is where the box is misleading.  When I watched the movie, I waited for zombies to come after her.  I think I better description would be ghosts since the beings are not material in any way and only she can see them.  Since this is an older movie, the special effects are minimal.  However, the filmmaker did well with what he had.
Because it is an older movie, the cast seems to really be projecting their voices to ensure they are heard.  This gives the movie the feel of being just a movie.  At no time will you feel like your are part of the action.
But the film is not bad.  If you are a fan of old horror films, then this would be an interesting film.  This is a story you can tell around a campfire.  For the average viewer, you may want to give this a skip.",1049241600,,993,4.072164948453608

I tried really hard to get into this one.  And I must admit that the main actress chick had a hauntingly wierd kind of a face that almost worked, if only she didn't have dialougue!!!

When I saw this film as a young whippersnapper, it frightened the pants and shirt off of me...leaving me ALMOST naked! In 1990, I bought the vhs tape of this  and it was great to see this movie again. It didn't scare me as much when I watched it again, BUT...it still scared me nonetheless. First, however, the film's flaws.

  For one, the acting is atrocious and some of the dialogue is pretty bad. And Mr. Lindsey, the other tenant in the boarding house, is the most annoying character I've encountered in any movie. What a creep this guy is! The actor who plays him does too good of a job portraying him...thank the Lord he never appeared in another movie again! The psychiatrist(or counselor) and the landlady have some very weak lines!
  HOWEVER..........
 Everything else about this movie is great! The zombies are very frightening, especially that man that the main character keeps seeing...indeed, the zombies may be the best actors in the movie!
Candace Hilligoss does a very good job in the lead role..she's quite stunning to look at and makes her character more sympathetic as the movie goes on.
  The movie has a very eerie, Twilight Zone feel about it and I like that the movie never really explains itself. David Lynch must have really loved this film. The organ music is very appropriate, tho' it's hard to know when it's being used as background music or when it's actually being heard by the characters in the film.
  I highly recommend this movie....

Carnival is the real treat here-- a minor classic guaranteed to get under your skin, especially if seen in the wee hours of the morning.  Hotel is uneven, but still above-average.  Carnival is the original theatrical version (I believe-- 80 minutes?); though I do own a VHS (which gives the time as 84 minutes) where some goofy special effects (called Super-Psychorama) are added briefly to enhance some scenes, but just detract from the atmosphere of the film--avoid this version.  The print of Horror Hotel was especially satisfying as I own the Screen Gems VHS version where the print is so scratched up it looks like the movie was filmed in a heavy downpour.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS!  Major beef: The background information on the films is reversed, i.e., the information in the Carnival of Souls section is actually for Horror Hotel, and vice versa.

It is not the greatest movie by any means, but it resembles Hitchcock's Psycho in its small size and independence from typical Hollywood.
The extras on this Criterion Collection gives greater insight to how a movie can be made and that anyone can really do it.

181165,4,1559409002,"This 1962 black and white cult classic was directed by Herk Harvey during a 3 week vacation. As the film starts out we learn Mary Henry is the only survivor in a car racing accident. The accident doesn't seem to fade her, and she is off for her new job in another city as an organ player in a church. As she drives to the new town she passes an old deserted carnival. Soon after she begins seeing a man following her everywhere, and has other weird things happen to her. She has nightmares, and becomes very paranoid. A doctor thinks all this is a result of emotional trauma from the crash. She doesn't think so. She believes her answer is at the carnival and she goes there to find out.
This film is amazing considering it was shot on a budget less than $30,000 and in 3 weeks. The direction is superb, and cinematography is wonderful. The script is pretty good for 1962, and would foreshadow some films of recent years. The whole film has an eerie atmosphere, with a creepy soundtrack. The only problems are the acting is not great, and on the DVD the audio of the dialog is low. For some the film may be to slow, but if you can handle that, then don't worry. Those are the only problems. If you picture yourself in the woman's situation you will see how frightening this film is.

181166,5,1559409002,"""Carnival of Souls,"" the only theatrical film every directed by Herk Harvey, is a cult classic with a most deserved reputation that puts it almost on a par with dead George Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"" in terms of shoestring productions (In fact, the two films appear together on a recent DVD Double Feature). Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) accepts a car ride from a group of other young girls, only to end up in a drag race that sees the car go over a bridge with only Mary surviving. Having taken a job as a church organist in Salt Lake City, Mary heads for her new home, passing a deserted pavilion on the outskirts of town. Mary is drawn to the ruined bathing center/carnival, but has bigger problems since she keeps seeing a leering, corpse-like man (played by Harvey) watching her. Again and again Mary has the eerie experience of suddenly finding herself in a silent world where no one seems to notice her. Eventually she returns to the pavilions to come to the terrifying realization of what has happened.
""Carnvial of Souls"" came about because Herk Harvey drove by Saltair, the deserted 1940s tourist resort outside Salt Lake City, and decided it would make a powerful location for a horror film. The man was definitely right on that score.  Harvey recruited John Clifford to come up with a screenplay that would involve Harvey's image of dead bodies rising from the lake to pursue their victim. The finished product certainly evokes a nightmarish quality that makes you ignore the technical problems with overdubbing, campy performances by the supporting cast, and such. Hilligloss, trained in the Method by Lee Strassberg himself but denied any hint of her character's motivation by the director (think about it), only made one other film, ""Curse of the Living Corpse"" (1964), but this film is enough to secure her reputation in the field. Sidney Berger, the all too friendly guy down the hall at her boarding house, does a cameo as a cop in the 1998 ""Wes Craven Presents Carnival of Souls"" debacle, which does not compare on any level to this evocative horror classic.  Given the high gloss shlock that is out there it is nice to see a horror film that is actually effective at creating a sense of unease without resorting to special effects.  Yes, the ending is predictable TODAY, but stop and think what things were like in the early Sixties before ""The Twilight Zone"" covered practically every ironic twist in the book.",1035849600,10,2441,4.779620853080568
181167,5,1559409002,"....The story itself is common enough: A woman (Patricia Jessel) is burned at the stake for witchcraft and she leaves a curse on the people of the town as she is consumed by the flames. Forward 300 years to the present day and we have Nan Barlow (Venetia Stevens) as a self determined college student who decides to write a paper on witchcraft. Her professor, Alan Driscoll (Christopher Lee), gives her directions to the town of Whitewood where 300 years earlier an alleged witch was burned at the stake. She goes to the town and after a few days disappears. Her brother then goes to the hotel where she was last seen, and runs into all kinds obstacles, not the least of which is the innkeeper of the Whitewood Inn, who just happens to look exactly like the witch burned 300 years earlier, and also Christopher Lee who happens to be a long ago resident of Whitewood
There is an old, blind priest who stays in his church despite the fact that he has no congregation. His granddaughter, Betta St. John (Patricia Russell), who seems to not be a witch, and has just returned to the town to take care of her grandfather, runs the local used book and antique store. She had befriended Nan before she disappeared and is now working with her brother, Dennis Lotis (Richard Barlow), to try and find out what happened to Nan.
Of course they run into the witches along they way and there is a showdown of sorts. The strength of this movie is in it's crisp acting and smart script. Especially notable are Patricia Jessel, Christopher Lee and Venitia Stevens. Despite it's low budget, the director, John Llewellyn Moxey, has made an altogether unforgettable film. ...The VCI Entertainment release is just what this movie has needed for years. An excellent transfer at 1.66:1 with two extra minutes of footage added from previous video and dvd releases. There is a commentary by director John Llewellyn Moxey and another separate commentary by Christopher Lee. There are also three interview segments with Lee, Moxey and Venetia Stevenson. Pretty impressive extras for a 40 year old low budget movie.
The commentary by Christopher Lee is interesting in that he has not seen this movie since it came out 41 years earlier. He is watching it with an interviewer from VCI who knows more about what is going on in the movie than Lee does. But Lee's ability to recall information about people and give anecdotal information is unsurpassed. He is literally a walking, talking encyclopedia of info on people he has worked with over the years.
This is one of my prize dvd's and I really cannot recommend it highly enough. ...",1034812800,2,2602,4.708333333333333

Candace Hilligoss plays Mary Henry, a young girl who survives a waterbound car accident. She promptly leaves her hometown, travelling to Utah, where she has been hired as a church organist. Mary is haunted by visions of a ghostly man (Harvey), and is strangely drawn to an abandoned pavilion where other apparitions seem to congregate. She periodically has strange ""spells"" in which she can't hear anything but her own voice, and no one around her seems to know she's there. She can't connect with anyone emotionally, including her overly amorous neighbor at the boarding house, the minister of the church where she plays, her landlady, or the doctor who tries to help her. If you've seen any horror films in your life, you've probably figured out the mystery; the plot is very simple, but that's not important. Atmosphere is the name of the game here, and Harvey (directing from a script he co-wrote with friend and fellow filmmaker John Clifford) lays it on thick: the film is eerily photographed; the amateurish performances of most cast members only enhance the dreamlike atmosphere; the all-pipe organ score drones dirge-like non-melodies endlessly throughout, sending chills up one's spine. There are many images in the film that were later copied in other great horror films: Mary emerging from the lake after the accident, covered in mud, looks alot like Carrie covered in pig's blood on prom night; the white face of the mystery man peering up into Mary's window resembles a simliar shot in HALLOWEEN, when Jamie Lee Curtis thinks she sees someone standing in her back yard; and of course the ghouls bring to mind Romero's zombies; I sometimes even wonder if David Lynch might have seen this film. But unlike those films, here we see nary a drop of blood in sight. This film proves that to make an effective chiller, a director need not resort to wall-to-wall gore tactics; in fact, there need not be any onscreen violence in order to generate suspense and atmosphere. Sometimes, violence, even gore, is necessary in a film. But in this case, gore would have destroyed the atmosphere. This is not only one of my favorite horror films, it is one of the best utilizations of a low budget I've ever seen. The incredibly eerie B&W photography, the jittery music, the stilted quality of the dialogue and performances (to some extent unintentional, no doubt)... the mood of this film is its most important asset, and as such, I think every filmmaker interested in working in the genre should take a look and learn. Sure, maybe there a few unintentional laughs here and there, and it isn't exactly horrifying, but overall it leaves you shaken. This will probably not appeal to slasher fans or splatterpunks.",1034467200,3,2888,4.956701030927835
181169,5,1559409002,"Much has been written about this 1962 classic film and a remake was even made in 1998, but the film still remains an enigma. The lighting, camera work, makeup and music score are all very original and still manage to haunt 40 years after it's release. The remake was a decent idea gone bad. Don't even bother with it.
In 1962, industrial film director Herk Harvey decided to make a horror film. He had previously made about 40 films for school and industry with such titles as: What About School Spirit? (1958), Caring for Your Toys (1954) , Street Safety Is Your Problem (1952) and Your Junior High Days (1961). He enlisted the help of fellow Kansans John Clifford (screenplay) and Maurice Prather (cinematographer) to help him and they recruited local talent to act in the film. The lead character, Mary Henry (played by Candice Hilligloss), only appeared in one other film. Most of the other actors have this movie as their only film acting credit.
There are many dvd releases of this film. Even the cheapest and most no frills copy would be worth owning and watching. The one that stands far above the rest however is the Criterion Collection version. This 2 disk set has an amazing amount of features including a 1989 reunion of the actors, writer, and director, Herk Harvey. It's quite the dvd set and you will know everything there is to know about all of the principles involved. I understand that this also may not be a good thing for some people...
So the basic story is that Mary Henry is involved in a drag race in rural Kansas that results in her car driving off of a bridge into a river. She manages to walk away from the accident, but afterwards she is haunted by a ghoulish looking man. She ends up getting a job as an organist at a church in Salt Lake City but is still seeing the ghoul man. She also starts felling compelled to go to an old, abandoned carnival. This is the basic story and I don't want to give away any more for those of you who have not seen the movie.
This really is a classic and somewhat of a landmark film. After making this film, Herk Harvey and John Clifford continued working for the same industrial film company as if nothing had happened. Over the years the movie started fading away from peoples memory until the advent of VHS tapes. The movie was a popular rental and it developed a cult following which prompted Candice Hilligloss to contact an aging Herk Harvey to try and make a sequel or remake. This fell through but eventually a remake (of sorts) was made titled ""Wes Craven Presents: Carnival of Souls"". John Clifford has the lead writing credit and at least one actor from the original, Sidney Berger, appears in the remake. But this is not an endorsement to rush out and see the remake. And this is not from some purists viewpoint either. It is simply confusing and nonsensical and resembles the original in title only. As for the original, buy it, watch it, make others watch it.",1034380800,3,2936,4.531073446327683
181170,4,1559409002,"So much has been written about this film over the years that I refuse to over-do it. To keep it simple, this is a low budget independently amateur effort about death that actually works. It works because the low budget just enhances the overall nightmarish quality. The heroine is a church organist who ""survives"" a fatal car accident and attempts to resume her life only to find she is haunted by specters of death. Creepy organ music permeates the b&w film throughout. The atmosphere is beautifully built up to eerie effect especially the on location shooting around a deserted carnival where the specters dance at night. This truly strange tale is best to watch late at night with the lights off and maybe a candle or two. I would also recommend turning a friend on to this who has never seen it. Just tell them it's a REALLY WEIRD MOVIE and that just about sums it up. It's wonderful to have it on DVD but stick with the Image or Criterion versions for quality and avoid the cheaper discs.",1034121600,,993,4.553072625698324
181191,5,1559409002,"""Carnival of Souls,"" the only theatrical film every directed by Herk Harvey, is a cult classic with a most deserved reputation that puts it almost on a par with dead George Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"" in terms of shoestring productions (In fact, the two films appear together on a recent DVD Double Feature). Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) accepts a car ride from a group of other young girls, only to end up in a drag race that sees the car go over a bridge with only Mary surviving. Having taken a job as a church organist in Salt Lake City, Mary heads for her new home, passing a deserted pavilion on the outskirts of town. Mary is drawn to the ruined bathing center/carnival, but has bigger problems since she keeps seeing a leering, corpse-like man (played by Harvey) watching her. Again and again Mary has the eerie experience of suddenly finding herself in a silent world where no one seems to notice her. Eventually she returns to the pavilions to come to the terrifying realization of what has happened.
""Carnvial of Souls"" came about because Herk Harvey drove by Saltair, the deserted 1940s tourist resort outside Salt Lake City, and decided it would make a powerful location for a horror film. Harvey recruited John Clifford to come up with a screenplay that would involve Harvey's image of dead bodies rising from the lake to pursue their victim. The finished product certainly evokes a nightmarish quality that makes you ignore the technical problems with overdubbing, campy performances by the supporting cast, and such. Hilligloss, trained in the Method by Strassberg but denied any hint of her character's motivation by the director (think about it), only made one other film, ""Curse of the Living Corpse"" (1964), but this film is enough to secure her reputation in the field. Sidney Berger, the all too friendly guy down the hall at her boarding house, does a cameo as a cop in the 1998 ""Wes Craven Presents Carnival of Souls"" debacle, which does not compare on any level to this evocative horror classic.  Given the high gloss shlock that is out there it is nice to see a horror film that is actually effective at creating a sense of unease without resorting to special effects.",1034035200,8,2204,4.769633507853404
181192,4,1559409002,"It was undoubtedly the low budget and no-name cast that kept this groundbreaking 1962 thriller off the radar for about 25 years. Only after a late 80's theatrical revival did audiences and critics begin to realize that ""Carnival Of Souls"" was a genre-defining entry in what we have come to think of as the ""modern"" horror film (well,a near photo-finish with ""Psycho"", at least!). Candace Hilligoss (who perhaps should have considered a stage name...""Candy Hill"", anyone?) gives a memorably haunting performance as an existential church organist (""It's just a job to me"") who emerges from a murky river hours after a seemingly fatal car wreck. Without giving too much away, let's just say Candace's ""reality"" proceeds to get even murkier as she aimlessly wanders a bleak Kansas landscape (hint: you'll soon begin to feel she's not in Kansas anymore!) This is the type of film that can be easily dismissed as laughable low-budget corn, or could inspire a 5,000-word Master's Thesis called ""Stygian Symbolism in The New Frontier: God and Existentialism in German Expressionist/Bergman-Influenced American Horror Cinema of the Kennedy Era"". At any rate, cognizant viewers will surely recognise the cinematic roots of ""Siesta"", ""Jacob's Ladder"", ""The Shining"" ""The Sixth Sense"", and even ""Eraserhead"" (the creepy and disturbing pipe organ soundtrack to ""Carnival"" had to have influenced Lynch).

181193,4,1559409002,"What is it about this film, that makes me want to watch it again and again?  It can't be the special effects; they are laughable.  It can't be the sound; the dubbing is the worst I've ever seen.  It can't be stellar performances by all involved; some of the acting and dialogue are horribly corny.
I think what makes this movie special, what has earned it a cult following, is that it traps the viewer within its own world, a claustrophobic, washed-out black and white world, a world on the edge of twilight heading inexorably toward an eternal darkness, a world where the heroine is slowly led to her doom, in spite of her desperate attempts to escape.  Lots of horror movies try to create this feeling of ""no exit"" but most try to do it with silly fright gimmicks and fail miserably.  This one uses a slowly constricting, strangely palid atmosphere centered on one character's increasingly odd experiences, eerie organ music, excellent cinematography, and an expressionistic landscape (a spider web shuddering on tree branches; a dark, abandoned carnival pavilion seen off on the horizon, a car pulled from a muddy river) to create a surrealistic sense of horror.  Candace Hilligoss, who only made this and one other horror film, turns in a stunning performance reminiscent of Kim Novak in Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo: distant, vulnerable, refined, yet repressed.  It's exactly what was needed here, and it makes her one of the most memorable horror actresses ever, in my book.",1033084800,7,1478,4.911646586345381
181194,5,1559409002,"_Carnival of Souls_ may not be a true film classic (even its director, Herk Harvey, didn't count it among his best work), but it's one of a precious few American films from the early '60s that qualify as serious works of art.

Extras abound on this 2-disc edition, but the most interesting of the lot pertain to the Centron Corporation, an ultra-low-budget production company in Lawrence, Kansas.  Most of the  crew for _Carnival of Souls_ (including Harvey himself) worked for Centron, which specialized in instructional films for public schools and corporations.  As a Centron employee Harvey would eventually direct nearly 400 short films, a few of which are featured here.

The DVD makes the persuasive argument that Harvey's ability to make the most out of extremely limited resources (as he did in _Carnival of Souls_) was a product of his many years as a director for Centron.  It also draws attention to the cinematic technique that goes into effective educational filmmaking, no matter how low the budget.

The 2-disc Criterion edition of _Carnival of Souls_ is a must-own for any cineaste who wants to examine the nuts and bolts of the filmmaker's craft.  (That said, less devoted cinephiles might prefer a rental.)  It revives and preserves, in the best manner possible, an artful low-budget horror film with a devoted cult following.  More importantly, it also brings attention to a long-neglected piece of American film history.  Kudos to Criterion for their excellent efforts.",1031443200,6,1490,5.115702479338843

181246,4,1559409002,"It only takes one word to sum up what makes the low-budget CARNIVAL OF SOULS a great horror film--atmosphere.  In their only commercial effort targeted for cinematic distribution, director Herk Harvey and his co-writer John Clifford whip up an ambiguous and unsettling narrative open to many interpretations--social alienation, emotional or mental breakdown, and feminist aggressiveness, to name just a few--and then pepper it with the palpable imagery of death and the afterlife.  And just in case the seasoned horror fan isn't unnerved enough, the spookiness is further augmented by a musical score comprised of an ethereal Bach-like organ music.  This creates a moody ambiance that reaches a bone-chilling apogee rarely achieved in even some of the more popular horror flicks, and by the time the film arrives at its haunting climax, viewers have sprouted goose bumps aplenty.
The story centers on Mary Henry, a young and ordinary Midwestern girl who is the sole survivor of a deadly auto accident.  In an effort to put the tragic accident behind her, Mary takes a job in a town several states to the west.  All of her efforts seem for naught, however, when she becomes haunted by spirits who beckon her to join them in a nightly danse macabre.  Ultimately, Mary comes full circle when events compel her to return to her hometown and face the truth about her own personal reality.
Wonderful as it is, CARNIVAL OF SOULS is not without its minor production faults.  Though actress Candace Hilligoss is outstanding as the pretty yet odd protagonist, many members of the supporting cast are obvious amateurs with little, if any, acting experience.  Director Herk Harvey was, by vocation, an industrial filmmaker who often peopled his productions with any ""soul"" who happened to be at hand, and it seems he adhered to this practice when casting this film.  In addition, it is glaringly obvious in some spots that the dialogue looping is either out of sync or is altogether different from the lines actually delivered by the actor.  Oddly enough, though, these few faults don't detract in the least from the strong, moody psychological narrative; if anything, they actually add to the surreal and creepy atmosphere.
CARNIVAL OF SOULS is one of those rare low-budget independent films that has risen above its modest beginnings, as well as some of its big-budget contemporaries, to become a cherished and well-respected cinema classic.  That it succeeds is a tribute to its creators, a handful of talented people who, against all odds, were determined to realize their artistic vision and to share that vision with the public.  And what a delightfully frightening vision it is!  A must-see for the serious horror aficionado, and a fun and creepy little curio for movie buffs of any calibre.",1004227200,4,2786,5.056768558951965
181247,4,1559409002,"I recently bought a Carnival of Souls / Horror Hotel combo DVD for dirt cheap, since I wanted something spooky for Halloween.  This DVD, if you can find it, is a great deal at $6! Carnival of Souls is the Blair Witch Project of the 1960s - a horror film made on a nothing budget that developed quite a cult following.  Sure, the acting is B-tier and the black and white film doesn't have that Hollywood slickness, but it's quite good!  Some of the images, especially at the end, are rather disturbing and even remind me of classic horror silent films.
The second film, Horror Hotel, is another great B-tier horror film from the 1960s.  I'd never heard of it, but I was pleasantly surprised by it, despite the silly title.  Christopher Lee has a small role in it, too.  Anyhow, it's a film about a college student who travels to a small New England town to do research on witchcraft for her term paper.  Of course, she discovers more than she bargained for (that's all I'll say about the plot, I don't like to give away plots).  The film reminds me a lot of the classic Italian horror film Black Sunday (with Barbara Steele) and Hitchcock's Psycho.  The photography is moody and eerie, and the film still has the power to frighten us, even in this day and age.
A few words about the DVD - both films are presented on the same side.  Sound is strictly monophonic and perhaps a little shrill at times, but it is overall quite acceptable.  The video quality varies.  Carnival of Souls was really crystal clear (surprising in a budget DVD) with only the occasional scratch or dust mark; the only thing I didn't like was this wavy thing that sometimes wandered across the image.  Kinda like some RF modulation wave (I'm not a tech-head, so that's the best I can describe it).  Still, unless you have the money to buy the very expensive Criterion DVD of carnival of souls (quite a good DVD, I hear), this DVD is more than good enough.  Horror Hotel's video is not as clear and tends to have a softer appearing image.  Kinda like watching a black/white film on TV, I think.  But the image is still very acceptable, and hey, for $6, you get two great horror films!  How can you lose?  I recommend this DVD if you can find it!",1004227200,4,2216,4.42716049382716

Also would many people get it now, you have to be of a certain intelligence to enjoy something like this, I mean clever and individual.

181254,5,1559409002,"Ethereal,haunting,creepy,depressing,otherworldly,euphoric,nightmarish,brilliant. These are only some words I can describe Carnival of Souls(maybe my favourite movie ever)with. Okay here is what to expect plotwise. A girl gets a ride with some other girls they challenge some guys to a drag race. Apparently these girls really are not racecar driving material because they go off into a body of water and only the girl they picked up survives crawling out from the water. The world is just not the same to this poor young lady after this. She sees the image of a cadaverous spectre in all sorts of strange places and the world seems to be slipping away from her. Now why I love this movie so much. Well for one I think I am a pretty odd and morbid person because no this movie could never be a blockbuster because it is not for all tastes. This movie truly gives you a feeling of death and the presence of the supernatural in ways no other film has. Yes the budget to this movie is low but no movie no matter how high the budget has been able to seemingly give you the feeling of being in the strange world of the dead that lies just behind the curtains of this comfortable world. It goes to show that being able to put lots of money into a movie has nothing to do with how good it is. True artists do not need million dollar budgets to create a great work of art. This Herk Harvey who I do not know much about is truly a great artist. I think he only directed one more movie after this one but I am not sure the title of it. It is sad though he had a gift for the surreal and gloomy. Now if you enjoy only what is normal and comfortable in film go and see whatever is big at the box office when you read this but if you are tired of modern society and its trappings you will love this movie! You can experience something truly incredible. If Poe was still living I think he would love this movie. Its as important to horror as many of his literary works I think. They have had good horror movies and they have had bad ones but they have never had one like this since.",999993600,3,2067,4.262086513994911

Harvey's film is a true masterpiece. He coaxes excellent perfomances from every actor involved in this movie, but the real star here is the director. What a shame; what a tragedy that this man did not receive the attention and praise he so richly deserved for this amazing and disturbing film. From the opening credits, one is keenly aware that this movie is a work of art, from the patterns Harvey discovered and lovingly framed in the moving water and sediments of a muddy riverbank, to the ingeniously placed titles as the film begins. No matter how many times I watch this movie, I never tire of seeing a true innovator at work. And no matter how many times I see it, I feel sorry that Harvey didn't produce any follow-up features, but happy that he left us this treasure.",999820800,6,950,4.56140350877193
181275,5,1559409002,"Yes, some of the acting is very bad. Yes, some of the sound is not in sync with the picture (a quality, in my mind, which adds to the ""out of body"" atmosphere.) And yes, some times the organ only sound track can wear a little thin (even though, for the most part, it makes the film.) Yes, this movie has some flaws. That's because it's shot on a budget of $30,000. By guys who made hygeine films for a living. Who also didn't have the cash to pay professional actors. All of these detials are completely unimportant.
To fully experience this film, you have to discover it in the way most of its fans do. On a TV set, in the early hours of the morning, alone, with the volume at an almost non-exsistent level. And it also doesn't hurt to be half way asleep. The scene in which Mary glances ""The Man's"" face in the window will jolt you awake like nothing else.
Some personal favourite moments: The above mentioned scene in the window of the car. The organ playing scenes (""Profanity! Sacralige!"") The scenes in which Mary loses all contact with the world of the living (these sequences caused me nightmares.) Candace Hiligos (a great performance, comparable to the best silent film acting.)

181276,4,1559409002,"My take on Carnival of Souls:  The artistic photography shows real insight and ability, the generally excellent Hilligoss performance is mesmerizing, and I think Sidney Berger, Frances Feist and Art Ellison perfectly fulfill their roles.  The minor characters are just acting like folk from small town Kansas (or Utah), so don't expect Lee Strasberg graduates.  The Gene Moore score is a custom fit, as is the Saltair setting.  The script is lightweight in many spots...the idea that the dead could inhabit a different dimension, side-by-side with the living is depicted visually more than by pointless banter.  There are some rough spots with jumpy editing and below par dubbing, and the pace is not intended for a viewer wanting Indiana Jones entertainment.  But when viewed as a series of parts that may be greater than the whole, ""Carnival"" is just an amazing, above average, low budget underdog saved from oblivion because enough people...intellectuals and commoners saw there was something different, something not of the commonplace in this film.  I recommend the Critereon DVD edition with crystal clear picture...its way better than previous VHS editions.",997747200,4,1164,5.327868852459017

And the organ music layers it on thick and creepy. A terrific movie.,994896000,4,377,4.5588235294117645
181278,5,1559409002,"""Carnival of Souls,"" the only theatrical film every directed by Herk Harvey, is a cult classic with a most deserved reputation that puts it on a par with dead George Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"" in terms of shoestring productions.  Mary Henry (Candace Hilligoss) accepts a car ride from a group of other young girls, only to end up in a drag race that sees the car go over a bridge with only Mary surviving.  Having taken a job as a church organist in Salt Lake City, Mary heads for her new home, passing a deserted pavilion on the outskirts of town.  Mary is drawn to the ruined bathing center/carnival, but has bigger problems since she keeps seeing a leering, corpse-like man (played by Harvey) watching her.  Again and again Mary has the eerie of experience of suddenly finding herself in a silent world where no one seems to notice her.  Eventually she returns to the pavilions to understand her final fate.
""Carnvial of Souls"" came about because Herk Harvey drove by Saltair, the deserted 1940s tourist resort outside Salt Lake City, and decided it would make a powerful location for a horror film.  Harvey recruited John Clifford to come up with a screenplay that would involve Harvey's image of dead bodies rising from the lake to pursue their victim.  The finished product certainly evokes a nightmarish quality that makes you ignore the technical problems with overdubbing, campy performances by the supporting cast, and such.  Hilligloss, trained in the Method by Strassberg but denied any hint of her character's motivation by the director, only made one other film, ""Curse of the Living Corpse"" (1964), but this film is enough to secure her reputation in the field.  Sidney Berger (the all too friendly guy down the hall at her boarding house) does a cameo as a cop in the 1998 ""Wes Craven Presents Carnival of Souls"" debacle, which does not compare on any level to this evocative horror classic.
This DVD collection is another outstanding member of the Criterion Collection.  Disc One has the original theatrical version (missing 7 minutes due to cuts by the producer), ""The Movie That Wouldn't Die! The Story of 'Carnival of Soul'"" documentary from the 1989 cast reunion, 45 minutes of outtakes with Gene Moore's organ score, the theatrical trailer, an illustrated history of the Saltair resort, and ""The Carnival Tour"" video update on the film's locations.  Disc Two has Harvey's original cut of the film and excerpts from industrial films made by Harvey, along with various essays, interviews, vintage photographs and memorabilia.  The commentary track is pieced together from interviews with Harvey and Clifford.  This is how it should be done.",989452800,7,2669,4.94407158836689
181279,3,1559409002,"""Carnival of Souls"" (the 1962 original, not the 1998 direct to video piece of crap called ""Carnival of Souls""), although maybe not the best or most well known horror film ever made, is certainly one of the most creepy and unsettling movies I have ever seen.
The film is about a young, pretty woman who, after having ""died"" in a car accident, finds herself being stalked by a pale, ghost-like figure who comes to her in nightmarish otherworldly visions of desperation and despair.
""Carnival of Souls"" is a cinematic wonder that just goes to show that you don't need a big name score composer, a big time director and cast, or a huge budget to make a good movie.  This is a true-to-form 1960's, black and white, B grade horror film that sets out to do one thing and one thing only, shock the living daylights out of the person viewing it.  It may not be the best movie ever made, and at times it can be quite corny and over-acted, but those factors only add to the nostalgic quality of the film.
To sum it all up, ""Carnival of Souls"" is a true horror movie gem that should not be missed by die hard fans of the genre (or anybody for that matter).
By the way, just in case your reading this review and wondering exactly how chilling this movie could actually possibly be, George Romero once said that ""Carnival of Souls"" was constantly on his mind while directing the original 1968 horror classic ""Night of the Living Dead"".",987897600,13,1421,4.461538461538462
181280,5,1559409002,"I had the great pleasure of seeing Carnival of Souls in its theatrical re-release in the mid-90s. Having seen it on video beforehand, I had some idea of what atmosphere the film created for the viewer. Seeing it in the theatre though was a completely spooky experience! Though the film may not be shocking or especially terrifying by today's standards, it still holds it own as an outre masterpiece of suspense.
A thousand THANK-YOUs to Criterion for bringing it to DVD. What a great package to have both cuts of the film, plus all the extra features (especially the extended montage of outtakes set to that bone-chilling soundtrack!) The documentary featuring the cast reunion is another bonus, as is the very interesting history of the SaltAir Resort from which Herk Harvey took his inspiration for the story.
The film is timeless in its use of stark black-and white, and light and dark to convey the extreme isolation felt by Candace Hilligoss' character, Mary the church organist. The soundtrack is quite eerie and used so effectively.
It is obvious how many ""horror"" films have been influenced by Carnival of Souls, in particular NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD by George Romero. The jerky/choppy editing style, the b/w photography, hysterical/hyperkinetic acting are all mirrored by so many present-day films. CARNIVAL is and always will be a unique piece of film-making. The excellent presentation on DVD shows it to its best advantage.

181281,5,1559409002,"I hesitate to use the word ""horror"" because as Boris Karloff pointed out, there is a distinction between ""horror"" and ""terror"" and this film definitely involves such distinctions. This is a ""terror"" film - a masterpiece of low-budget suggestion and fear, as opposed to the more disgusting gory motion pictures common today - an essential possession for anyone who cares anything about the genre that creates an eerie atmosphere and a sense of pure ""fear.""
Perhaps the reason for this is that the director, Herk Harvey, found a truly poetic inspiration in the source of his story - the haunting Saltair resort, which has been cursed by fires and floodings since it was first constructed at the turn of the twentieth century. This DVD features marvelous additional material, including a segment of postcards from the era, which, seen from the vantage point of the 21st century, are so strangely evocative of the later ""dead"" atmosphere that Harvey capitalized on. Candace Hilligoss is excellent in evoking sympathy for the heroine trapped in a frightening nether-world, and the scenes where she visits ""The Pavilion"" are among the eeriest ever filmed in creating a vivid sense of the supernatural.",983836800,5,1195,5.1020408163265305

But CARNIVAL OF SOULS undoubtedly has a place in this collection and should regain a new popularity among movie lovers.
Of course, the movie at times could be confused with a TWILIGHT ZONE episode but Herk Harvey's camera is a lot more creative and innovative than the television cameras of Rod Serling. Our new horror movies screenwriters and directors are after all not sheer geniuses, they steal a lot of their ideas from such movies as THE CARNIVAL OF SOULS. Even the so praised SIXTH SENSE doesn't seem so original after a screening of Herk Harvey's movie.

My parents, who were not big horror-film fans, adored this film-(my mother mistook it for a foreign film on first viewing).

She's haunted by a cadaverous  looking figure that no one else can see and strangely drawn to the  abandoned amusement park outside of town.
This film is long on atmosphere  and not well suited for anyone with a short attention span.  There is  something, though, about an empty carnival in the middle of the Kansas  prairie that is spooky all by itself.  This movie exploits its spookiness  for maximum effect.

Though made on a shoestring  budget, this is one of the most eerie and haunting films I've ever come  across, the kind of horror movie which really does leave a lasting  impression.
Out of three women involved in a car accident, only one  survives.  After managing to recover and start a new life in the city, the  survivor begins to find herself 'cut off' from the world, sometimes finds  nobody can see or hear her.  These are scenes anybody who has ever felt  alienated from society or lost in the world can easily identify with.  The  film is a wealth of unnerving images, such as the abandoned amusements park  and dance hall.
Another memorable aspect of the film is the dark-suited,  deathly-faced phantom who seems to lurk in every shadow.  Somehow I found  him a far more sinister and unnerving presence than Freddy or Jason.  It  must be the power of the imagination - the psychological threat of danger,  what might happen, is far more terrifying than simple acts of blood-letting  or violence.
All in all, this film is everything a horror film should be  - filled with haunting images, a sympathetic central character and a  clever, thought-provoking storyline.",967420800,8,1282,4.811059907834101

Imagine not knowing you've died, walking around as  a ghost and being unable to understand why nobody can see or hear you.  An  all-time classic, this is living proof that imagination and style are more  important in films than money and special effects.  The scenery is  wonderfully sinister and the abandoned funfair provides a powerful image.  Also noteworthy is Harvey's dark-suited ghoul, who, with his menacingly  calm intent and glinting-eyed smile, dominates his every scene and is a far  more nightmarish figure than the likes of Freddy and Jason.  The  soundtrack, consisting of organ music, is suitably atmospheric, and the  whole thing has a very artistic feel to it, very surreal.

181299,2,1559409002,"In 1962 when this film was released, it caused enough stir that theatre managers had to offer a disclaimer: no refunds.  Seems they were afraid that the ground-breakingly spooky, ""psychological"" plot would  frighten the weak at heart enough to make them leave the theatre.
I'll  tell you, though, for a Gen-X viewer in the year 2000 the refund would have  been for a different reason.  To today's viewer, this film is just plain  boring.  I found myself watching the film through to its end (not too  painful, at only 84 minutes) simply because I was hoping some shocking  ending would make it all worth while.  (The ending, in 1962, WAS a shocker.  But don't expect anything you won't have guessed well in advance.)
If  you have an interest in cinematics--makeup, lighting, framing, and other  film/theatric techniques--then you may get enough out of this movie to make  it worth a purchase.  But do yourself a favor and buy the cheap version.  The Criterion Collection DVD package, for a whopping $40 retail, offers a  Kansas TV station's sentimental, low-budget documentary of the film cast's  27-year reunion, at which they reminisce about how young they were back  then, how cold the water was in the river, and how hard it was putting on  their own makeup for the film.  These are the sorts of reunions I make up  excuses not to attend.

As Herk Harvey (the director) said, this film was shot on a budget that wouldn't have sustained the opening moments of  Back To The Future. However, this film is able to sustain a creepy and  oppressive atmosphere throughout, and that is the major achievement. Even  though I knew when every ""scary"" moment was coming, and I guessed  the ending 20 minutes before the film actually ended, that knowledge didn't  ruin it for me. That's how strong the movie is, that you can enjoy the film  even if you knew everything about it. The acting is stiff and the dialogue  is often stilted, but that just adds to the strange and dark atmosphere of  the film. And the Criterion release is a real gem. Two discs, the first has  the theatrical release of the film, and the second has the director's cut.  The film looks incredible. I've yet to see such an old and cheaply made  movie look so good. And the extras are also great. Documentaries, outtakes,  interviews, and oh, that organ music. If you're a fan of horror, you must  own this film. If you're a film buff, you must own it.

181314,3,1559409002,"Many viewers (including myself) caught this 1962 horror classic many many years ago on TV and some of the horrific imagery has stuck with us ever since.  However, although the film has a lot going for it - the haunting B&W ghouls, the moody organ music, the great Saltair location, etc. - it really doesn't hold up that well dramatically.  Don't want to trash a classic, but there's NO WAY you can't figure this one out in the first 10 minutes.  Still, it's the overall ethereal weirdness and haunting imagery that make it a well-deserved minor classic in the horror genre.  I do think CRITERION's DOUBLE (! ) DVD is a bit excessive, however....why have both ""versions"" of the film - the theatrical cut and the original director's cut?  Surely, no viewer will bother watching the edited theatrical cut (edited by the distributor to put on a double-bill) when the original director's cut (only 5 minutes longer - and nothing substantial really) is here.  Seems kind of pointless. Also, many of the extras on this Expensive DVD are a bit anal... maybe if I was a REALLY EXCESSIVE FAN of the film, I would want to watch an hour of boring industrial short films made by the company the director worked for....sorry, I don't care if they were made by Kubrick....they're BORING!  Some of the reunion footage of the cast, crew and director in 1989 IS quite interesting...but this DVD easily could have been a One-Disc release.  I feel like Criterion just wanted to milk us for more $$$ by including so much drivel....  I guess in the final analysis, though, Criterion should be commended for doing such a release at all.  If you got the bucks...buy it!",958694400,4,1645,4.680555555555555
181315,5,1559409002,"Almost as eerie and unexplainable for me as the film itself, is the fact that this film has made it to DVD and by Criterion no less. This movie is close to my heart because I know Larry Sneegas, who played the young hood  at the beginning who asks the girls ""Wanna drag ?"" (Larry was  also part of the production crew for this and many other  ""industrial"" films with director Herk Harvey). The historic  Englewood theater here in Kansas City showed CARNIVAL a few years ago as  part of a tribute to local film makers and what a treat to see it for the  first time on the big screen! Larry has been gracious enough to loan me his  VHS copy of THE MOVIE THAT WOULDN'T DIE documentary that Criterion has  included ... some great background on this small-but-mighty film and I  can't wait to see all the other ""extras"" on the disc as well.  I've seen both versions of the movie (again thanks to Larry) and while they  each work marvelously, who wouldn't prefer the director's ""more  zombies"" cut?  The reviews below really capture the film's essence,  so all I can say is ENJOY !",956188800,15,1075,4.3908629441624365
181316,5,1559409002,this film is incredible. it's so eerie and frightening and it obviously had a tiny budget. definitely one of a kind. it reminds me of occurrence at owl creek bridge by ambrose beirce.,955238400,4,183,4.575757575757576
181317,5,1559409002,"This is the only film to cause me to suddenly realize the horrifying reality of what had befallen the heroine solely on the basis of a series of seemingly insignificant events.  It doesn't rely on glitzy special effects,  maniacal slashers,  repulsive monsters or the last minute plot twist .  Instead, it uses real life moody settings, creepy music, and a tremendous  story to scare the living daylights out of you.",954115200,2,416,4.885714285714286

181319,5,1559409002,"This easily surpasses the amateurishly made  ""Blair Witch Project"". This even surpasses ""Night of the Living Dead"", ""Hush. Hush...

181320,5,1559409002,"This is one of those lost classics that deserves far greater exposure than it has thus far received.  Made in the early 60's, it is an eerie tale of a woman caught between a ""no mans land"" somewhere between life and  death.  The film evokes memories of David Lynch's work and that of George  Romero.  Clearly the two directors have been influenced by this midnight  classic.  The film borders on surrealism especially in scenes where the  madness begins to close in on our heroine in the most unlikely places.  Herk Harvey never directed another feature, preferring a life making  ""industrial"" films, but this effort ranks as a horror  masterpiece.  Thanks be to Criterion for releasing this classic....and  doing so in both versions.  What a mouthwatering prospect this disc is.  Let that organ play on.....!",949881600,3,809,4.932835820895522
7796010,2,1559409002,"Several times this movie becomes ""change the subject"" dull; other times the amateur actors react past-the camera like making a quick joke video for a friend.

7796014,5,1559409002,"In his stark and elegantly realised vision of death, madness and the fine line that connects the two, Herk Harvey has created a genre redefining masterpiece. By blending a broody atmospheric undercurrent that would have made Ingmar Bergman proud, with the whimsical wizardry of an early Georges Mlis, Carnival of Souls creates a rich, visual world that is both terrifying and terrific.

Technically masterful, every shot in this film has been composed like a poem. Bold chiaroscuro and claustrophobic blocking are used to create an ever-tightening vice of dread, suffocating the fragile mind of the protagonist.

It's as easy to wax lyrical about Candace Hillgoss' captivating performance as the strong-willed organ player who overcomes a terrible tragedy to rebuild her life in Utah. Equally stunning performances from Stanley Berger (as the rakish neighbour, Mr. Linden) and Frances Feist (as the ever-supportive landlady, Mrs Thompson) make for scenes that brim with energy, unspoken fear and often sexual tension.

But it's only on a fourth or fifth consecutive viewing that one sees the true hidden gem in a film that is otherwise a treasure trove. Art Ellisons' nuanced portrayal of the church minister is so finely tuned that you'd be forgiven for thinking he wasn't acting at all. But he was. Just very, very well. It is the minister who, in a way, represents the voice of reason in the film, hearing Mary Henry's haunted dirge for what it truly is. Forced into a terrible decision between Mary and his beloved congregation, the scene where the minister must request Mary's resignation is hard to watch in its unflinching honesty. In a few, brief seconds, Art manages to perfectly capture the minister's internal conflict at a pivotal moment in the film.

An enduring and rewarding classic. Not to be missed by serious film lovers.",1514764800,2,1839,5.099667774086379
7796015,1,1559409002,"Carnival of Souls is somewhat of an enigma. Those who have reviewed this film well before me have offered significant praise, but few have come away with my own sentiments: that this film is true cinematic garbage.
  Removing the obvious patriarchal nonsense evident throughout this low-budget nightmare would only be a marginal improvement. The plot is stale, predictable, and at times entirely ridiculous; why does Mr. Linden have to be a persistent (stereotypical CIS male) pervert? Why is Mrs. Thomas such an incredibly invasive landlord? And what did the monkey have to do with anything?
  Despite this film's numerous flaws, its one saving grace is found in the brilliant performance of Arthur 'Art' Ellison. Without his obvious dedication to his role, 'Carnival of Souls' would have been impossible to stomach. Art's portrayal of the humble minister truly sets a precedent for future films; the minister is a masterful depiction to which all clergymen of the stage and screen should be compared.
  The same can not be said of our lead actress. Alas, not even Art's confrontation with Candace Hilligross could breathe life into her annoyingly vacuous expressions. By the end of this trainwreck of a film, the viewer can at least raise their hands to the heavens, and rejoice: for you are longer being subjected to Candace staring out windows, scene after scene! The undead (souls) look like drunk birthday clowns, and can hardly be considered more frightening than Mr. Linden and his advances.
  Easily the worst carnival I've ever experienced. Ballroom dancing alongside an organ... in Utah. Thank you, Arthur Ellison, for doing your best to save this abomination. I rate one star, and it is for you alone.",1514764800,,1713,5.0928571428571425
