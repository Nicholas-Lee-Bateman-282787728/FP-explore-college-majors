1014357,5,6305369267,"I've been doing yoga for a couple of years, and every time I do this tape, it kicks my butt. I also think I get more of a sweat going with this tape,  than from a conventional aerobics tape. Also, I think Yoga Zone's routines  are very easy to follow. The instructors explain everything in good detail,  as you can't always turn your head to look at the TV, when you're upside  down.",966816000,15,383,4.205479452054795
1014358,5,6305369267,This is a wonderful yoga video. The workout is perfectly challengaing and  presented in such a wonderful way. I always feel great after doing this  workout. I highly recomend this video.,965433600,6,186,4.967741935483871
1014359,5,6305369267,"I was surprised how relaxed I felt after doing this--I thought Power Yoga  would be more like calisthenics than like stretching. You get stronger and  more flexible at the same time--what a deal! This is more difficult than  Bryan Kest's first video--more poses, more quickly.",965433600,10,276,5.088888888888889
1014360,4,6305369267,"Don't let the picture on the box fool you - unfortunately, this video never features that particular pose.  Otherwise, I recommend this video if you really want to strengthen and tone your muscles and work up a sweat!  This video is hard work and features many poses that will work EVERY muscle  group but is well worth it. I use it every other day.",962150400,6,349,4.421875
1014538,3,6305369267,"I bought this based on the good reviews. I actually bought the 3 pack but mainly to get this DVD. Turns out of the three I like this one the least. Like other reviewers said, I found it repetitious and awkward at times. It just didn't flow for me and I learned nothing new. It was nothing special. I prefer Rodney, Baron, Desi and Tara.",1361059200,,336,4.184615384615385
1014539,4,6305369267,This video gives a good overall workout for beginners or more experienced yogis. I like the focus of one side at a time.,1360972800,,120,4.260869565217392
1014540,5,6305369267,"This video is a definite workout. If you need easy breezy yoga that's more meditative, this isn't the one. It's 55 minutes in length, and you'll be burning calories from the start. Now I speak as an intermediate yoga student, so for those of you that have been at it for years, and are at the advanced level, or consider yourselves ""yogis"" this may be just another day of practice for you. I'm 5'4, and 194 lbs., so maybe that's why I sweat. They say yoga doesn't burn that many calories, or isn't as effective as a regular cardio workout, but I beg to differ; I FEEL like I've worked out after this video. It's done outside on the grass, which I love, cause I hate yoga videos filmed in a studio. Well, except for a yoga video I have by Kathryn Budig, which is done in a beautiful, open, high ceiling, indoor/outdoor loft style space that's well lit and somehow just makes me feel instantly peaceful, but that's an exception. I actually prefer all my yoga DVDs on a beach location, but I'm learning to be more flexible. This instructor is mature, well versed and pleasant, with two people accompanying her during the practice. She doesn't rush through poses, and never makes you push your body further than it can go.  You can tell by what they're wearing it's a little dated, but just ignore that in exchange for how you'll feel when you're done!",1359331200,2,1348,4.479674796747967
1014541,5,6305369267,"I love this particular workout.  I run at least 25 miles a week and incorporate strength training, so I'm fairly in shape and this DVD makes me work!  Good upper and lower body power moves.",1351641600,,189,4.371428571428571
1014542,4,6305369267,"This yogazone dvd is an hour of strenous work.  I wanted a harder workout than I had been getting with a yogazone collection I bought previously.  Well, this does the job.  The first half is a lot of sun salutations for each side of the body and then it goes on to balancing poses and some harder poses, like ""raven"" and ""screaming pigeon"", some of which I still cannot do.  You will be sweating and feel great after this workout.  I know I do.  After i week of doing this, I already felt a difference in my flexibility, etc.  Highly recommend.  May not be good for the very beginner.",1349740800,2,584,4.293577981651376
1014543,5,6305369267,"I have purchased other DVDs from Yoga Zone and have not been disappointed.  I really like the workout in this DVD.  It is challenging and really works my legs!  I though I would get bored with doing the same routine, but I have made some individual changes that prevent that from happening.  For the price, it's a great workout.",1343174400,,328,4.508474576271187
1014544,5,6305369267,"I have practiced yoga for eight years and enjoy the more advanced level classes at the studio I visit.  This DVD from The Yoga Zone is very much like those classes with emphasis on vinyasa flow, chair and the warrior poses. The routine does provide a challenging series of difficult poses. It is a good idea having one of the participants performing lower impact versions of the poses as an alternate for viewers.

The pace of the video is fast. I sometimes chose to linger in a pose, usually up dog, rather than rush through the vinyasa. The practice begins with the vinyasa sequence rather than providing a few minutes of warm up poses like spinal balance, cat and cow. It would have been nice to include these more basic poses before getting into the more challenging ones.  It would have been nice to mix up dog with cobra for the sake of variety.

Lisa Bennett is an excellent teacher and the flow of her poses is very good. She offers some good tips about the poses. I would not say that this DVD should be used by someone new to yoga. I started taking basic yoga classes and graduated myself over time to the more advanced classes. Yoga is not the easy relaxation exercise that many people think it is and can be very challenging. This is an excellent yoga video that I will be returning loading into my player frequently.",1336608000,3,1329,4.479338842975206
1014545,5,6305369267,This is my favorite power yoga dvd.  The narration is great and the tips for adjusting your posture are excellent.,1320710400,,114,4.7
1014546,4,6305369267,"This DVD was exactly what I was hoping for in a Power Yoga workout. It goes through a series of poses that not only stretch your muscles but also strengthen them. The legs get an excellent workout. I have used this at least a dozen times since I got it and have been able to see progress in both strength and flexibility. I have yet to master some of the poses but at least have progressed beyond collapsing from fatigue from some of the longer holds. The setting is a nice relaxing spot and the instructor has a nice soothing tone. She will remind you of how to correct yourself and will demonstrate on one of the students (one is performing the advanced variation while the other is performing the beginner variation).
 The DVD itself has a function to choose which portions you want to skip to which is a great feature but isn't really useful for this workout. The series of poses that work the legs are 20 min per leg and are separated, so unless you only want to workout just one leg you are committed to 40 minutes.",1271116800,5,1021,4.345549738219895
1014547,5,6305369267,"Other - I've been doing this workout for a long time on VHS but upgraded to DVD.  I used to play soccer and really messed up my knees doing so (running up concrete stairs, deep knee lunges around the field, way too much practice).  My knees would burn and grind.

Positives - This workout is pretty tough for the person that can't and won't do the above workout.  It's easy on your bones and muscles.  You can feel your muscles working and uses your own body weight to provide resistance.  The instructor is very clear and helps you get into the different positions correctly.

Negatives - The people leading it do sound kinda blah, but after you hear some of the other video workout instructors and know what they're going to say next in the video, you kind of enjoy the non-super-fake-excited tone.  The video does take a lot of time to do and seems pretty long.  For me it's a twice a week video so I can take less time on certain days and mix some cardio into my routine.",1269129600,,975,4.342541436464089
1014685,4,6305369267,"I like the format of this instruction video because the instructor is more focused on teaching than performing the moves herself.  It is setup with a beginner on her left and a more advanced student on her right and she spends a little more time focused on the beginner (appropriately) instructing on proper form.  The video has a nice flow to it and builds as the video progresses, one unique aspect is that she performs a ""complete"" sequence on one side of the body before moving to the second side.  At first I didn't like this as much but now I use this tape more than any other in my library.

The video feels a little ""dated"" due to the guys attire but I'm more focused on what I'm doing than looking at the video after the first few uses and her prompts are well-timed (because she is watching the students most of the time) and clear which is why I use it a lot!",1264896000,2,870,4.254545454545455
1014686,5,6305369267,"For the past month I've been using this DVD in rotation with some others for mornings when a trip to the yoga studio is not possible. I wanted to try this DVD because of its focus on one of my weaknesses. My legs and hips tended to give out during long balancing sequences. When I first tried this routine I couldn't get through the balance sequence on either leg. Then one morning I was able to last through the long-held half moon on my right side. A week later I wss gratified to be able to hold both sides and still maintain a calm, deep breating pattern. This routine is about an hour long and very intensive on the legs. There's not much in the way of pure core work and forward and backbends are covered but not with nearly the thoroughness she gives to the standing postures. Use this as an addition to some of your other DVDs to get your legs burning and hopefully to de-stress your mind.

I'd like to say that Lisa Bennett is one of the most appealing yoga instructors out there. (I think I may have a slight crush on her.) She is not only abundantly beautiful to the eye, but I can hear the smile in her voice and I sense that her smile is coming from a real place. To some she may come off as too perky, but I kind of like that. Her instruction is just about right, not to chatty but she keeps the student on track with gentle reminders now and then to focus on breathing. The poses are demonstated in their full and modified forms.",1247529600,3,1444,4.194244604316546
1014687,5,6305369267,"This is a great workout that can be used daily, without getting bored.  What I appreciate most about it, is that I do not have to fast forward through a bunch of introductory chatter every time I use it.  The assumption is that if you choose to use this video, you already have a basic knowledge of the poses and breathing techinques of yoga.  Lisa just gets right into the workout and there are no boring parts or fast forward material at all.  When I purchase a yoga video, I plan on using it repeatedly.  Many other DVDs I have used go on and on with introductory material, which is fine, but should be in a separate chapter, so that it may be skipped once understood.  This is not a problem with this DVD as Lisa gets right to it, without any nonsense.  Highly recommended for a great daily workout!  My butt has never been tighter, since using this workout!",1247356800,2,862,4.34375
1014688,4,6305369267,"This is a power workout, it will definately let your muscles know yoga @ this level is challenging.  It's a good challenge though.  If you're thinking of taking it to the next level this is the dvd for you.",1229472000,,206,4.256410256410256
1014689,5,6305369267,"Like some other reviewers already said, this one looks easier than it actually is! I still have only the VHS version and it's much loved to where I will soon have to get it on DVD!
I consider myself a fairly fit person; running and working out with weights, yet this tape always gets me sweating and working hard too!
I love all Yoga Zone workouts and I think you can't go wrong with any of them! :)",1222992000,2,399,4.128205128205129
1014690,5,6305369267,"I am a 40 y/o male in decent shape-completed my first triathlon this summer and work out with weights regularly.  I bought this DVD some 2 years ago as my introduction to yoga and have continued to use weekly without disapointment. Even with the experience I have with the DVD some poses on side 2 remain a little outside my ability but I skip the most difficult and still end up with a 45 minute challenging routine, which is ok as I enjoy the challenge of improving.  I think this DVD is great for people with a decent base, but maybe a little much for those with back problems or new to exercise.  BTW I am a chiropractor by profession.

1014691,5,6305369267,"Be prepared for an easy to follow, but challenging work out! Let me tell you, it is harder than it looks!  Think you are in shape?  Try this workout and then tell me!  I challenge you!",1202601600,,184,4.055555555555555
1014692,5,6305369267,"I started doing yoga with the Yoga Zone ""for beginners"" series a couple of years ago.  I definitely recommend that series for people new to yoga (particularly ""Total Body Conditioning,"" also with Lisa Bennett), and I still use them sometimes on days when I'm too tired for a really challenging workout.

Now that I am more advanced, I was delighted to find that this MUCH more difficult Lisa Bennett video is out there.  The way she arranges the postures into a flow is wonderful-- I find the time goes very quickly doing this video.  When I first started, I could only do the first 35 minutes: the warm-up.  Then I would collapse on the floor dripping sweat, and with my legs shaking.  It is very difficult to spend ~18 minutes working just one leg, and at first you may hate it.  But it's worth it-- it will really give you the results in your legs and thighs that you want to see.  After just one workout, you feel a difference.

The poses Lisa proceeds to in the remainder of the session are also advanced.  On a couple of them I still can't do even the modified version-- so I have to make up an even more modified version to build strength until I can get there.  Even so, I look forward to doing it, and love the feeling that I will be able to do the whole thing soon.

My only beef with this practice is that the only specific ab work is one boat pose near the very end of the video.  I assume that I am supposed to be getting abdominal strengthening by keeping my abdomen firm during poses, which I try to do, but this doesn't do enough to get rid of that (baby-related) stomach fat that is one of my main motivations for exercising in the first place.  However, this isn't enough for me to reduce my number of stars on this one.",1201305600,,1738,4.275229357798165
1014693,5,6305369267,"I read the bad reviews for this video and bought it anyway. Yes, she talks a lot, but most video instructors don't which leads to injury. If you are a practicing yogi looking for more than relaxation, this is a great choice. People who can't accept her talking are more the get-it-done type. Yoga is a process. No static positions. No crunches-til-you-die. Each position needs to be fully discovered and stretched. Her cueing allows that to happen.
Level wise.... it's very challenging. I'm a dancer and was constantly getting bored with the relaxation-focused videos that didn't do anything for stamina or strength. This definitely does. Chatter on, Lisa!",1199145600,4,656,5.083333333333333
1014694,5,6305369267,"This is in my top 3 favorite yoga DVDs, with my other two being Yoga Shakti and Yoga for Happiness.  This practice is approximately 1 hour, and I always end up pretty sweaty.  Lisa Bennett has a very nice voice.  There are two others in the DVD, one presents more challenging versions of the poses, while the other presents easier versions.  I use this when me legs need a good burn.

One note - Lisa presents several series of poses on one leg, then moves on to the other leg.  This is different from any other practice I have done.  Some people may not like this, however I found it to be a different challenge.",1176422400,2,613,4.278260869565218
1014802,4,6305369267,"I have been doing yoga in a studio for several years.  Even with experience, this DVD is challenging for me, yet enjoyable.  I definitely recommend it.",1176076800,4,151,4.769230769230769
1014803,4,6305369267,"I have been doing yoga for about a year and found a lot of the other videos out there to be too easy.  I wasn't able to do the entire video on my first try, but got a great workout. I won't get bored with this one since I will have to work up to it.",1174867200,3,249,3.4464285714285716
1014804,5,6305369267,"I love this workout!  I had it years ago on VHS and was glad to get it on DVD.  I tell everyone about this DVD because after just one workout, I feel SUCH a difference in my body!  The day after doing this DVD I feel taller, slimmer, my belly flatter - I LOVE it.  It can be challenging, and there is a point where my legs really hurt and shake while holding a few poses (it's the single leg poses) but the workout is amazing!  I tell everyone that they will sweat more with this workout than with an aerobic workout!  The sweat literally drips off of you!",1171065600,6,556,4.055045871559633
1014805,5,6305369267,"This is an amazing workout. It's incredibly intense and really well designed. Some of the moves are really advanced, but the modifications let me follow along until I can develop the strength to do them. And I'm sure repeated use of this tape will help me do just that (though it'll be a long, long time before the Raven becomes possible). The first few times I did the workout, I was completely exhausted. Now I'm only dead tired.

I like the inclusion of the balancing poses, as some of them were new to me at the time and they're a great way to build lower body strength.

I also love Lisa Bennet's voice. It has very soothing highs and lows and is perfect to meditate to. She's a great instruction -- she really knows her stuff and is very personable.",1153267200,8,755,4.385714285714286
1014806,5,6305369267,"The Yoga Zone DVDs are great for depth of information, structure of the practices, and duration -- realistic to allow practice every day.  I've tried a lot of power yoga DVDs, and this one most resembles the classes I've taken at a $100/month health club.  And that's saying something.  It's well paced, and while the warm up may be ""long"" for some, you're really warm for the later portions of the practice.  Great explanations, including pose modifications; good variety of poses, including some I hadn't seen in that swank health club class.  You'll break a really good sweat, and be prepared to slip into Child's Pose for a break, if need be.  And that's fine -- Be Where You Are, in yoga and in life.  This DVD should be in everyone's collection.  Namaste.",1147737600,11,761,4.669172932330827
1014807,5,6305369267,"Alan Finger's and Lisa Bennett's Yoga Zone Power Yoga for Strength and Endurance is an extremely fascinating workout.  Although there is a linearness to using one leg at a time during the initial standing pose sequence, keep in mind this is balanced with deep squatting and twisting.  I think the quick salutation pace really builds heat in the body, making this one of the most aerobic of the power yoga DVD's I own.  I particularly love the complex four part single leg standing sequence.  It seems that the raven pose is all I need to tighten up and firm my abs.  All in all, when I am done my chest, arms, back, butt, and of course legs feel really strong.  From a vanity perspective, I think my body looks its best after this workout.  anyone who wants to sweat and feel super strong needs to add this routine into their regimen.  This is truly a no nonsense workout.",1144195200,10,872,4.474683544303797
1014808,5,6305369267,"The best part of the Yoga Zone series is the level of instruction in how to perform the poses.  Alan Finger and his crew understand that mere observation and vague, vapid monologues about relaxation and breathing do not sufficiently explain yoga poses and practices.  Yoga Zone instructors do point out how yoga can lead to inner harmony and abstract notions of spirituality and being, but the majority of the series is spent telling and showing you how to perform yoga safely, emphasizing that yoga is not about competition with others, but with the self.  Some instructors are better than others, and some routines feel like repetitions of other DVDs.  I am writing this introduction to all of the Yoga Zone DVDs I own.  The following pertains to this particular DVD.

Yoga Zone's Power Yoga for Strength and Endurance can be very challenging for yoga beginners, those who have weak legs and a weak back, and especially for those who are overweight.  The routine is divided into two sections - one that builds heat and strength in your system and one that challenges your balance.  The overall routine relies heavily on the muscular strength and endurance of one's legs.  Expect to get sweaty doing this program.  The poses and exercises are performed in full and modified forms, but one should be aware that the modified forms are not necessarily easy.  I have lost seven pounds since beginning this program, and the extra weight I started with made some of the poses difficult to perform.  As I lost weight (and my stomach and waistline decreased), I began to be more comfortable while doing the routine.

The instructor is Lisa Bennett.  She has a pleasant voice and explains poses thoroughly (if a bit quickly).  She seems like a real person and does not speak over your head or get all mystical.  After all, power yoga is work, and one needs an encouraging coach to perform work, not a spiritual leader (which is often appropriate for other kinds of yoga routines).  Lisa Bennett is definitely a good coach and instructor, and this DVD is a fine addition to your yoga video collection.",1141344000,4,2092,4.798882681564246
1014809,5,6305369267,"I am a total beginner yoga fan and I have looked around at a number of videos.  This one is one that I can actually do the majority of.  I do struggle a bit with the balancing poses (partly since my legs are seriously tired 35mins into the video) but on the whole this workout is truly excellent from a beginner point of view.  I say this because you are offered modifications the way you ought to - most videos I look at always seem to show just advanced postures and assume you can do everything without your legs bent (or just don;t show you the beginner way).  I have had to go and practise in the conservatory my postures at night so that I can see from all angles in the reflection how my actual posturing is coming out.  I love some of the awkward chair stuff even though it really burns up the thighs.  This dvd sures does go fast as it progresses.  Still - if you're a beginner and you are looking around for some good videos and you're a little bit adventurous, try this one.  I first checked out the yogazone power yoga for beginners (which I found easy) and then have since moved up to this one.  My absolute favourite yoga video and I am struggling to find a series that suits me as well as this.  As a beginner learning from home, it's imperative I am shown the modified postures since I am very nervous I don't over-exert myself and cause injury by launching into advanced postures.  Just praying Yogazone release more power yoga videos... I am hungry for them now!",1140307200,6,1480,4.306859205776173

well the good news are : this is definitely a challenging yoga workout that is really good for leg and butt toning , the insructor is also very nice and has good instructions and pointers , also the outdoors set is really nice.

the bad news are: this is a very dull and repetitive practice , like other reviewers have mentioned. The workout is about 60 minutes , 45 minutes are standing poses vinyasa series like doing b sun salutations for the whole time just with different poses from time to time. every series of standing postures (there's 2) is performed entirely on one side and only after you worked the hell out of one leg you switch to the other one, it ends with only a few stretches (unfortunately) on the floor and bridge pose and then savasana. also the video quality is a little bad.

now it's up to you to decide if this is the kind of yoga workout you are looking for, I find this one too boring.",1138406400,4,980,4.258064516129032

I have had this DVD *unbeknownst to me, you know how that goes!* for over a year and I finally picked it up and did it and I got hooked. Since then I have bought Crunch Total Yoga, Brian Kest power yoga and MTV Power yoga. All these titles are good, but for some reason the Yoga Zone is my fave. It's very challenging (still have major hip flexer issues in Standing Moon posture!) but rewarding. Quick pace. Great instructor--she's a calming influence. I would very much recommend this DVD; I do most postures at the advanced (but not crazy advanced!) level and I am always thrilled with how I feel after. I would recommend heating your room as hot as possible to aid in sweating and flexibility. Hope this helps!",1132790400,6,845,4.423076923076923
1014884,5,6305369267,This is by far the BEST POWER YOGA DVD I have ever used!!!  It focuses SO much on the legs and glutes.  It's very intense and does the work you need!!  I wish that Yoga zone would make another Power Yoga DVD similar to this one and incorporate more difficult standing postures for the legs and glutes in a 50 to 60 minute session.  I wish more Power Yoga DVD's were like this one.,1127952000,2,380,4.094594594594595
1014885,5,6305369267,"I think this disc is better than some comments would suggest.  From my perspective, I saw little or none of the infomercial tone some reviewers commented on.  Perhaps previous negative experience with other Yoga Zone productions sensitized some viewers.  I also found the warm-up at the beginning of the disc quite sufficient to build heat, especially if practiced in a room that is heated and/or not over air-conditioned.  Also, viewers should of course take it easy with the first few poses till they warm up.

  Overall, the disc contains a clean, relatively simple flow-oriented routine which does a nice job of building heat and deep breathing.  There are relatively few of the more complex standing or seated postures, but the postures that are included are entered into in unusual and interesting ways.

  The disc includes a standing one-leg balance with a twist, which is not very common on yoga videos.  It also includes sequences in which you move from a twisting chair (thunderbolt) position back into a twisting lunge.  This presents a new challenge and brings the body into the position in a way that opens up new sensation and insight into the posture.

  For the money, this is a simple, enjoyable, challenging and very rewarding routine that is well worth checking out.  It is accessible and challenging at the same time, which is nice.  This will allow many viewers to have a great yoga experience without getting caught up in the details of a lot of unfamiliar poses.  Experienced yogis will like the chance to flow through a clean routine and build heat.

This is HARD for me, but nice because it is so long (about an hour I think) it takes awhile to do the whole thing, so I have something to work towards.  I am about 2/3 of the way after a month or so.  I would recommend doing basic yoga for awhile before trying this unless you're used to working out a lot.  But once you're ready this is the DVD to buy.  The instructor is really good and the exercises really work your leg and arm muscles.",1084665600,8,579,3.905982905982906

But this video moves too quickly to follow up for beginners. I never got through this video to the end. You will generate a lot of heat. Above all this is a great work out.",1073865600,,366,3.8933333333333335
1014888,5,6305369267,"I LOVE yoga zone videos, particularly the ones with Alan Finger. However, I consider myself an intermediate and have practiced yoga for a few years, and most of Yoga Zone's videos are for beginners. I wanted a challenging workout, and also a more Vinyasa (flow) style workout. This was perfect. This workout isn't led by Alan Finger, but the instructor is great. The instructor goes fast, so it's great if you don't like to hold poses forever while they explain basic poses, maybe not the best tape to start out on. You move quickly from pose to pose, mostly warrior, right angle and chair poses. Half way through this tape, I was literally dripping with sweat. However there's rests (long down dogs or forward bends) in just the right places to recharge you so you can do more. I definitely couldn't do the whole video, especially some of the balance poses (like half moon, revolved triangle and reverse right angle that also require strength), but I'm glad I have something to work towards. Extremely invigorating and relaxing!",1073520000,11,1029,4.8192090395480225
1014889,5,6305369267,"I love this DVD - what a great workout!  Straightforward poses (Warrior 1, Warrior 2, right angle, triangle, etc) are held for a long time for building heat, deep stretching and intense strengthening.  The tape is a bit slower than some other power yoga tapes, which actually leaves me feeling like I've gotten a more thorough and challenging workout.  The routine takes you through a series of sun salutation poses with long held awkward chairs and some great twists.  I have tried and will continue try out other Yoga DVD's, but this will ALWAYS be one of my regulars!!",1072051200,,571,4.737373737373737
1014890,5,6305369267,"I initially did not like this video upon first viewing.  It looked slow, and boring.  However, I actually tried it, and was pleasantly surprised.  The workout is not like a lot of today's Power Yoga DVD/VHS tapes where the pace is fast and furious.  Here the positions are held for a fair amount of time, and repeated several times.
The Yoga instructor starts out by throughly warming up the right side of the body and then the left.  Most of the poses are not pass the intermediate level.  The body is given a through stretch through slow repetition versus speed (i.e. MTV's Power Yoga and Rodney Yee's Power Yoga dvds).
Overall, the workout is slow and intense.  Please note that by slow I mean that the poses are held for a while, and the pace is not as aerobic as some of the other popular Power Yoga tapes, but you will still build up a meaningful sweat.  The cool down is also pretty rewarding.  If you are the type of person who loves a slow pace, this is definitely the dvd for you.  This is a great dvd to practice yoga to, and definitely makes me believe that you cannot judge a tape until you try the work out.",1069804800,5,1121,4.320574162679426
1014891,4,6305369267,"This video will leave you exhausted but in a great way.
The video is a real challange and I would not recommend it to any on who is new to the practice. As well Instructor Lisa does a great job in explaining the poses, and the secquence.  There is also two other Yogis in the video.  One to follow if you are more advance and the other if you are on the beginner/interrmediate line.
With any video I would really give this one five to eight tries before you put it away and forget about it.  If you can get the hang of it, it will become one of your favorite videos.",1068163200,2,566,4.035714285714286
1014892,4,6305369267,"Wow.. this Yoga Zone DVD is one of the best I've tried.  I'd consider myself an intermediate yoga student and I had a tough time with some of the balancing postures.  Most of the poses are very common and there are two other instructors in the video who move at a different paces.  Once you have done the postures, the instructor brings them all together into one movement.  It's very invigorating.  At the end, you move into Relaxation pose and you feel amazing.  It's a fantastic video for all levels.",1064361600,5,503,4.533333333333333

I can only do it once a week because it is so challenging, but I absolutely love it.  It works your legs, back, arms, and sides.  The instructor Lisa is very cheery, and the music is upbeat.  I recommend this for anyone that is very in shape, and desires a challenging workout. Go for it!",1057449600,3,404,4.493150684931507
1014991,4,6305369267,"I started doing yoga about a year ago, with ""beginner"" videotapes and some classes as well.  I really like this tape a lot, for those days when I want a more strenuous practice or want to work on getting in shape.  I usually don't do this whole tape two days in a row, because I find it VERY tough, and I am often sore the next day.
Even though I like to think I'm in pretty good shape, and I have always had strong legs, I can't get through this video completely without stopping to rest or doing modified versions of some of the poses.  After the warrior/chair series, they go straight into balancing poses, and this is where I usually have to stop for a minute -- by this time I'm sweating like crazy and my legs are burning, and you don't really get a rest before switching gears.  By the time they get to the floor poses, I'm so ready to rest my legs that I don't even mind the ""screaming pigeon"" pose!
I agree with the other comments about the lack of warmup on the tape.  I don't think this is a tape for real beginners, even people in good shape because although they do describe the poses pretty clearly, they don't go into the details of the breathing, except to remind you to keep doing it.  And the instructor is a little chipper for my taste.  But I find her very informative about the poses.
Right now, I am currently rotating this tape with Fat Burning Yoga by Crunch (which is excellent, and deceptively hard) and Yoga Mind & Body with Ali MacGraw (which is also terrific in a totally different way).  Both are good ""active"" tapes, especially compared with many of the Yoga Zone tapes (Flexibility & Tone, Stress & Conditioning) which are good for stretching and de-stressing, but you don't feel like you've had a ""workout"" after doing those the way you do with these. I have about 9 or 10 yoga tapes and this one is by far the hardest -- although I am about to get a Baron Baptiste and a Brian Kest power yoga tape, and we'll see how those compare.",1051920000,20,1965,4.291891891891892
1014992,5,6305369267,"I'm a yoga beginner, but I find that many of the beginner tapes aren't challenging enough to be interesting.  This tape is fast paced (Power Yoga) with enough holding and repitition to be very challenging over 55 minutes.  Also, no really difficult moves (like inversions) so it qualifies for the athletic beginner.  I recommend this tape if you are looking to sweat a little along with your stretching.",1047859200,4,403,4.897058823529412
1014993,4,6305369267,"This is a very good video but definitely not for the beginner level.  I got this one and the Yoga zone for Flexibility and Stress Release.  I can't get through the whole tape without a break.  The DVD says it's for all levels and they offer modified poses, but it definitely gets your heart rate up.  The Flexibility and Stress Release tape said it was for intermediate levels on the box and it is very manageable.  This tape will definitely give me a goal to work towards.",1041120000,9,473,4.390804597701149
1014994,5,6305369267,"I have a LOT of Yoga videos that I alternate with and I really like this one!
 It's not a very intense Power Yoga routine (like Bryan Kest or Baron Baptiste) but it doesn't claim to be one. It is in fact an INTRO type tape. I found it to be a great tape to use to alternate with more intense days. For a beginner it'll probably be pretty challenging and give them a great start.
 I prefer this tape to the Rodney Yee ""Stamina"" Power Yoga tape for beginners in that the Yoga Zone's tape's pacing and sequencing of poses seemed to open my body up more gently and feel less hurried.
 Both routines have a great flow, they keep you moving but not too fast. It built a degree of heat without being exhausting. The instructors are easy to follow and I enjoy their personalities as well(they keep things light yet have enough detail).
 The brevity of the routines make them very doable, there's no excuse not to do some yoga, even if it's only one of the 20 minute sessions.
 I've been doing Yoga for quite a while now so I may be jaded, but I felt that even someone new to yoga would have no trouble being able to follow this tape quite easily. The poses are explained very clearly.
 Other wonderful tapes you might want to look into are a four tape set by Rainbeau Mars called ""Sacred Yoga"". It's a vinyasa flow style series that can be used by a beginner to yoga or a more advanced student.

It is certainly challenging, but that is what keeps it fresh even after monthes of using the same tape.

Unfortunately, the instructor starts right in at the beginning without any breathing preparation whatsoever.  Although I know that traditional power yoga classes start off similarly, at home it's important to have at least some preparation because without an instructor right there to oversee there's no chance to give individual breathing advice when needed.
