8573935,4,B00BUBFDY6,"I've been looking for this drama for some time. My computer crashed on me & I lost my fansubbed version. Now, I have a hard copy. Awesome!!!

DVD arrived quickly & very nicely packaged. No damage during shipping.

Ratio is 4:3. Video quality is high def but wished there was a widescreen version, however the screen ratio was given in the description and I knew that I wasn't getting widescreen. There was one episode (I forgot which one) where a couple of phrases weren't subtitled. The $47 price tag seems a bit excessive but, it's probably because it's an import.",1397520000,,566,4.65
