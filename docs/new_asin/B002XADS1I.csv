8383547,5,B002XADS1I,"I used to watch this as a kid. Excellent educational animated cartoons about human body, human organs, and how body reacts to an outside influences. Good first biology lessons.  Cartoons little old fashioned. Set of 6 DVD's with 26 serials. The only odd thing is that sometimes in the movies they translate red blood cells in two ways. You need to have zone free DVD player to watch this DVD. This is the French series in German production (covers are written in German); dubbed in German, English and French. To set it on English language mode you need to go to the menu, enter ""MIKROSKOP"", then select language on the top of the screen, scroll down and enter one of the four/six cartoons on DVD (they are written in German). The cartoon will then play in English mode. I would definitely recommend this item.",1299283200,17,810,4.625
