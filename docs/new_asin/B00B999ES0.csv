5564432,5,B00B999ES0,"What took place in Egypt heading into the revolution was quite different when viewed from the inside vs. the outside. ""We Are Egypt"" absolutely provides a view that the international press did not portray and communicate, and subsequently the film brings to light many elements beyond the news' 'this is a social media revolution' headline.

It's rare to have a filmmaker embedded for as long as Paquette was (14 months), and even rarer to have one who really understood the ramifications of what was taking place and what was happening as a lead-up to the headline event. ""We are Egypt"" delves deeply into these issues, and more importantly, deeply into the emotions of the key people inside the activities. It provides the 'why' as much as the 'how' and serves as an incredible document that will explain to future generations what happened.

Considering the ongoing events today (many months later), ""We Are Egypt"" is a film that should be viewed by anyone interested in understanding the phyche of a nation trying to reinvent itself, the dynamics of government, and what a willful people can accomplish when they want to.

An important and historical work.

""To most of the world, the protests in Egypt looked like a spontaneous uprising. But according to filmmaker Lillie Paquette, it was actually the culmination of years of methodical organizing. We meet her and get a behind-the-scenes view of the buildup to a revolution."" -- The Current, CBC",1359936000,5,1452,4.983471074380165
5564433,5,B00B999ES0,"You'd think that a film on the Egyptian Revolution that ends before the fall of Mubarak would be incomplete and irrelevant in light of subsequent events. WRONG!  Lillie Paquette's documentary is a fascinating and brilliantly crafted insight into the people and emotions that led up to the Revolution. We all know from the news media what happened in Tahrir Square and beyond, but we don't really know why. Paquette's film supplies answers from the people who made it happen, in real time as they struggled to bring about the circumstances leading to revolution. Highly Recommended.",1359936000,5,581,5.11578947368421

8564605,5,B00B999ES0,"This film was captivating! Its timeliness, its comprehensiveness, its reality grab you in, scene after scene. The director was especially adept at capturing her interviewees' thoughts in a credible and candid way, even those who were a challenge to access. For many, it could provide greater insight into and a fuller background of the events we witnessed in 2011. For educational purposes, a great tool for initiating discussion of events in our changing world.",1360886400,,462,5.256756756756757
8564606,5,B00B999ES0,"""As a professor of Middle East politics, I'm always looking for material that makes U.S. students feel like they're actually there, and puts faces and voices to the names that they read about. ""We Are Egypt"" is exactly like that - a diary of events the year before the revolution that makes crystal clear both how much disgust and frustration Egyptians had with the regime and how brave and determined they were in their resistance to it. One of the strongest aspects of the film is the focus on men and women youth activists only slightly older than our students and to whom they can really relate.""

8564607,5,B00B999ES0,"I do not usually write reviews, but after watching this film, I felt compelled to deposit my two cents.

The entire world watched the Egyptian revolution seemingly out of nowhere. Who could have foreseen that there was even the basis for such change developing in Egypt? Well, director Lillie Paquette had that insight! This movie tells the story of the courageous activists who out of the love of their country, and desire for a better life for themselves and their countrymen, were the seminal agents of change in Egypt. This is a story of fearless democratic activists, young people volunteering as election monitors and the real optimism that imagined change under one of the most repressive regimes in the world.

Director Paquette follows a group of young, now a bit more famous, activists in their pursuit of democratic reforms. The filmmaker was obviously in the right place at the right time as the film ends with Mubarak's ouster from his dictatorial position.

I came away from watching this film, with a renewed sense of optimism about political possibility at large. Cynicism is rampant in politics, but as the revolution in Egypt continues to unfold, I think there is a real reason to resist the feeling of cynicism that accompanies any real political change. At many times in the lead up to the Egyptian revolution, the situation was beyond bleak. It is very difficult to predict political futures, but what we do know is that, as a society, we have to continue to work towards the future we would like to realize, as hopeless as it may feel at times. Change is slow and gradual, and not the result of the lone actors in history books. Meaningful reform is the result of the work of many many concerned citizens, popular support that we would do well to acknowledge, if only for a dose of optimism in our own lives. Well worth the watch, unbelievable footage, the story of the true guardians of the Egyptian Revolution!",1360540800,,1934,4.7844311377245505
8564608,4,B00B999ES0,"I am not an Egypt expert, but found this film to be insightful, original, and full of important lessons for other contexts.
We ordered special copies of the film from the producer for a screening on 29 May at a special event in Kabul. Several of those in the audience had lived in Egypt before, and a vivid discussion ensued over how things had changed between then and now, as well as which lessons could be learned for Afghanistan - very interesting to see our Afghan guests draw parallels that hadn't occurred to most of us. Everybody appreciated the film's rather unique perspective.
I can only encourage use of this documentary for anything ranging from high school/university discussion groups, debating clubs or just to widen your own horizon on an important (and mostly uncovered) part of the Arab spring.",1360454400,,813,4.856115107913669
8564609,4,B00B999ES0,"As a professor of Arab studies and mass communication, ""We are Egypt"" raises some important and pressing questions about how messages are crafted by democracy activists versus the regime at a crucial moment in contemporary Egyptian history. The filmmaker's vantage point allows viewers to contemplate and consider the role of US foreign policy in support of both the Mubarak regime and his young adversaries in the reform camp and the dilemmas faced by groups around the region that are advocating for change and are trapped between their own governments and foreign governments' national interests and security. More importantly it is a fascinating historical document that surveys the views and roles of various now-important players in Egypt politics, from April 6 activists to the ever-changing and yet relevant Ayman Nour. This film will not cease to be important for a long time to come.",1360368000,,893,5.251748251748252
8564610,5,B00B999ES0,One of the most informative films about Egypt. A must see for anyone seeking a more in-depth analysis on the revolution. Watch it!,1360368000,,130,4.695652173913044
8564611,5,B00B999ES0,The documentary goes a long way in showing what the sentiments and feelings of regular Egyptians were right before the revolution unfolded - something that was missed by most of the other films.,1360368000,,194,4.909090909090909
8564612,5,B00B999ES0,As other reviewers have said: this documentary started a year and half BEFORE anything actually happened in Egypt. It is the story day by day of the events leading to the final Arab Spring. Recommended must watch for everyone interested in these events.,1360108800,,253,4.906976744186046
8564613,5,B00B999ES0,"Unlike other recent documentaries on the 2011 uprising that toppled Egypt's dictator, many of which rushed in only in time to capture the historic scenes unfolding in Cairo's Tahrir Square, this documentary was begun over a year and half before the revolution began, and before the world's eyes became transfixed on Egypt. In the 18 months leading up to the revolution, before anyone knew what would happen, first-time documentarian Lillie Paquette had already been on the ground in Egypt, tracing the determined efforts of young democracy and labor rights activists who were risking tremendous odds to promote democratic changes under the then US-backed autocratic regime of Hosni Mubarak. ""We Are Egypt"" takes us on their journey and helps us to understand the various strains of social and political activism that had been brewing in Egyptian politics for many years and helps us to understand why and how these frustrations exploded in early 2011. It allows us to see these struggles through the eyes of Egypt's leading dissidents and youth activists. The interviews that followed the fall of Mubarak from power also help viewers learn first-hand about how to make sense of the complex social and political undercurrents that continue to unfold today in Egypt's increasingly heated and unfinished political transition.

NBC Nightly News anchor Tom Brokaw has said of the film, ""An important and ambitious documentation of the roots of the Egyptian Revolution...We're very fortunate to have this historical record."" Harvard University's Egypt specialist, Tarek Masoud, has said, ""Not only has Paquette interviewed practically everybody who matters (no small feat), she does so in a way that communicates their personalities, their hopes, and their not insignificant senses of humor."" The DVD also includes excellent extended bonus interviews, including discussions of memories of Egypt's 1952 Revolution with acting legend Omar Sharif, interviews with Mubarak supporters in the final days of his regime from inside his NDP party headquarters (before it was burned down by protesters), and thoughts on US foreign policy in Egypt by the Carnegie Endowment's Michele Dunne and MIT's Noam Chomsky.

Want to make sense of the continuing political transition still underway in Egypt's unfinished revolution? Then this is the film to watch.",1359936000,5,2336,5.414835164835165
