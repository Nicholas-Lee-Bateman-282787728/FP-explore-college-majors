4229370,5,B003YJ8FQ0,"My expectations were not that high for this latest AC concert DVD, but damn, I was wrong.  I love the new and different arrangements of these songs compared to the highly polished versions offered up on Live at Montreux from 2005.  That was a great band, half of them are back, and guitarist Keri Kelli and long-time/part-time Alice drummer Jimmy DeGrasso and the others make it interesting even if you've seen his more recent shows or concert DVDs.  Thanks to Alice for including Wicked Young Man (my personal favorite) from the great Brutal Planet CD, From the Inside, Nurse Rozetta, and Cold Ethyl.  Dirty Diamonds is another standout; Alice taunts the audience repeatedly with those cheap necklaces and it's just a great live tune.  There are lots of crowd shots which work well; Alice's interaction with the crowd and their reaction is always a big part of any AC show.

Other than Alice, how many classic rock stars' recent material can stand up with their classics - NO ONE else.  His voice has held up amazingly well and the man truly enjoys what he does and it shows.  As long as he can get musicians this talented and put on shows like this, I hope he goes forever.",1287100800,7,1175,4.615384615384615
4229371,4,B003YJ8FQ0,"Ive seen most shows here in Canada with Alice...from Welcome to my nightmare and
others that followed. The worst time came during the 90's when he up'd the tempo
on all his songs.
But now with this DVD, all is back to normal, we get to see and hear Alice at
his best...pretty good for a old guy heh !.

I Watched this DVD half asleep, and by the end i was ready to Rock and Roll again.",1286841600,,385,3.9358974358974357
4229372,4,B003YJ8FQ0,"I had planned to pass on the latest Alice Cooper DVD/CD combo, Theatre of Death: Live at Hammersmith 2009. After all, how many versions of ""School's Out"" and ""18"" does a guy need?

At least one more, as it turns out. Despite having two or three other video versions of Cooper shows in my home library, I added this latest set to my collection today, and I'm glad I did. Beautifully filmed, the recording captures a set list and theatrical show virtually identical to the one my wife and I saw just a few weeks back in Cleveland. Apparently, the Cooper tradition of only changing shows every other year still holds true.

Basically, this is Cooper doing what he does best: Serving as ringleader for a group of talented younger musicians and ripping through as many classic tunes from his repertoire as possible. Only a few songs from the last decade make the cut (""Dirty Diamonds,"" ""Wicked Young Man"" and ""Vengeance Is Mine""), with a few more obscure hits (""Guilty"" and ""Nurse Rosetta,"" the last being one of my favorite Cooper tracks from the criminally under-appreciated 1979 album, ""From the Inside"") inserted for good measure.

This DVD is better than 2005's ""Live at Montreux,"" largely because the theatrics are much stronger. The Hammersmith show offers super-sized syringes, a hanging, a guillotining, and a disturbing belt-sander-to-the-crotch sequence. Cooper's is in fine voice here, and damn if it doesn't get stronger past the halfway point when he serves up two ballads in a row ""Only Women Bleed"" and ""I Never Cry.""

Band members Damon Johnson and Keri Kelli (guitars), Chuck Garric (bass) and Jimmy DeGrasso (drums) offer a tight set. Garric is especially effective when he takes over lead vocal duties on ""I Love the Dead,"" giving Cooper a chance to prep for the one-two-three punch of the finale, ""No More Mr. Nice Guy,"" ""Under My Wheels,"" and ""School's Out.""

Weak points? Well, opening and closing with ""School's Out"" is overkill, even for such a seminal anthem, and I would love to hear Cooper give some of the newer songs from his oeuvre a chance live. With so many classics to choose from, it's a tough decision to scratch an old standby in favor of something newer, but I wish the ratio of old to new wasn't so skewed.

I'm glad I dropped sixteen dollars on this DVD. Doubtless, I'll give it at least one more play before Halloween. If you're into vintage hard rock with a theatrical flair, this one is practically nirvana.",1286755200,31,2445,4.781990521327014
4229373,5,B003YJ8FQ0,"vintage coop.

what he does differently on this dvd as opposed to others is bring back some of the old favorites never done before on past releases.a totally redone atypical stage set,that is amazingly fresh.absolutely worth the price of admission!!!

alice is a bit like ozzy in that he has an incredible sense of talent.this backing band is replete with a set of no name musicians who perform better than even ""brutally live"" personnel,who included eric singer,ryan roxie,and greg smith.

at one point he performs in a wheel chair,dressed in asylum issued clothing and doing songs about his stint in rehab off of ""FROM THE INSIDE"".his dark sense of humor is everywhere on this dvd.a man who has exorcised his demons,and can laugh at himself,while entertaining us.this man has jettisoned the belief that rock careers are generally short lived.he has masterfully thrilled us for over 40 years,and there is no end in sight.

this killer vid starts with power,and moves along seamlessly,on a pace that has no gaps.he is the ultimate showman,who never fails to satisfy.opening with ""SCHOOLS OUT"",he firmly grasps control,and you know and feel it.""DEPARTMENT OF YOUTH"",the anthem for rebellious youth screams next,followed by one of the finest live versions of ""I'M EIGHTEEN"" that i've ever heard.all the greatest COOP hits are here.

the second disc is an anthology of live performances with all his bands,including the first band, GLEN BUXTON,MIKE BRUCE,DENNIS DUNAWAY,AND NEIL SMITH.this is in cd form,but is just a killer collection of all the best.all the fabulous musicians are here.....DICK WAGNER,STEVE HUNTER,ERIC SINGER,RYAN ROXIE,STEF BURNS,DEREK SHERINIAN,AND SO MANY OTHERS.

it is a well produced vid,very clean with many angle shots,so you miss nothing.a true 5.1 surround recording that fills the room.an absolute gas,from start to finish.a must have vid,for any collection,but especially ALICE COOPER lovers.",1286409600,4,1921,5.386666666666667
4229374,3,B003YJ8FQ0,"i have been an alice cooper fan since the early 70's. i've met him, partied with him, seen him at least 20 times, and i admire him as much as just about anyone in music. alice is unique, original, energetic, excellent in concert, and one of the nicest persons you would ever meet. i couldn't wait for this dvd release. it was hyped as a new show and an alice cooper show like you have never seen before.  when i put this dvd in, i'm seeing the same old show i've been seeing forever it seems. come on alice. how many times do we have to see you decapitated or hung by the neck? we were seeing this ten years ago. it's getting really old. no one loves you more than i, but can't you come up with something new?  maybe you have too much on your plate and are not concentrating on your music enough because cds like ""the eyes of alice cooper"" and ""along came a spider"" really suck for someone who is capable of much better.  i also think this dvd is very weak compared to the last one. i hated to give it 3 stars, but actually thougt of giving it 2. sorry alice, but you are starting to bore me.",1286150400,2,1092,4.069767441860465

4229377,5,B003YJ8FQ0,"I love music. Everything from Alice to ZZ Top. Seen Alice 3 times. Oh, I remember when I was a lot younger, the things that were said about Vincent Damon Furnier. I couldn't have any of his 45's or albums, mother wouldn't allow. He was a shock rocker, and been at it for at least 5 decades. So, he obviously did something very right. Even though ""the establishment"" didn't think so. So I had to wait a little longer to buy vinyl. He's another who could just stand on stage and do nothing, of course he's above Kid. I said that about him too. This DVD is good. I think the one done in 05 might be better. My poor husband 20 years ago I'd crank up my stereo, and he dreaded hearing Alice and so loud. He's gotten to were he can listen to him, but he's not got over the loudness. I tell him ""if it's too loud, your to old"". I swear if I live to be 100 it'll be rock n roll and loud. And other kinds of music, and loud!
I do have a very old tape of him, quite different from this. Just can't imagine how mother knew. Word of mouth? The stupid reports on the tube?  And look at what they said about Elvis. Old Ed wouldn't show him from the hips down. LMAO",1396310400,,1150,3.9783549783549783

Some 40 years after Alice first showed us the way to blend visual entertainment with music, the entire show still works and still holds a few surprises, even for the long time fans like myself.  The Blu-Ray disc brings the show to life in ways that will make you appreciate your HDTV and the bonus audio disc allows you to take this wonderful concert on the road with you.

You know the songs, you've lived the anthems, you love the characters and you're just a few clicks of the mouse away from having the nice man at the post office deliver a copy of this wonderfully filmed and brilliantly performed show to your doorstep.

4229383,5,B003YJ8FQ0,"I recently saw Alice Cooper during the ""No More Mr. Nice Guy"" tour in Grand Rapids, Michigan as part of the outdoor ""Rock the Rapids"" celebration. The review said he did not interact with the 7,000 plus crowd enough but did he really need to? From the opening notes of ""Schools Out,"" he demanded and commanded the audience. No doubt, he was in charge.

Both shows ""No More..."", and "" Theatre..."" share much of the same set list. I did miss ""Clones"", ""Feed My Frankenstein (with a giant puppet)"" and ""Elected"" from ""Theatre..."" though.

One major arrangement change at "" Rock the Rapids"" was during ""Schools Out."" It incorporated the lyrics to the sing-along-song part (We don't need no education...) of Pink Floyd's, ""Another Brick in the Wall, Part II."" It was a nice touch which is hard to describe to others without actually seeing or hearing it. I wish this CD/DVD combo with two versions of ""Schools Out"" would have done the same.

Both visual and audio were crystal clear with a commodity not heard often in live albums; great background vocals. This was an impulse purchase due to seeing the recent show with my son. I'm glad I picked it up and look forward to revisiting a great Alice Cooper experience for years to come.

Although there are many live Alice Cooper shows to choose from, I would definitely recommend this to others.",1314230400,,1339,4.685106382978724
4229384,5,B003YJ8FQ0,"I was rather hesitant to buy this Blu-Ray performance of Alice Cooper live, because I just recently watched his previously released Blu-Ray release of ""Alice Cooper Live at Montreux"", and I just wasn't too impressed.  I even rented it twice to confirm to myself that I just wasn't all too impressed with that performance.  But, after seeing all these five star reviews of this performance, I figure that I can't go wrong picking this one up.  And I sure am glad that I did.

Don't think for a minute that just because Alice Cooper is in his early sixties, doesn't mean the he's too old to behave like a convincing mischievous child on stage, because he's just as wonderfully immature as ever!  And he still has his wonderful raw voice that we are all so familiar with.  And don't think that just because he's in his early sixties that he's going to look like some old man (a convalescent home, nurse-fed, bed-ridden, death candidate), because Alice has always looked like the Frankenstein clone we've all imagined him to continue to be.  He may have put on a few extra pounds (but, haven't we all?), and it may take less applied make-up to make him look scary, but that's what we expect from the legendary Alice Cooper.

And all his warped theatrics are here. The guillotine trick, the sloppy, skanky, psychotic nurse, and, of course, Alice as the baby killer himself strikes again!  It's all here, gruesome and tasteless as ever.

Now, if they would just release Alice Cooper's ""Brutally Live"" from 2000 onto High Definition Blu-Ray, I'd be a totally satisfied, happy degenerate myself.",1313884800,,1587,4.759124087591241
4229385,4,B003YJ8FQ0,"This is a great album for fans of Alice Cooper's live shows, the theatrics are great, Cooper's singing has somehow not faded even an inch, and the song list is pretty long so you don't end up feeling like it's way too short.  My only complaint is that Alice's setlists these past few years have become rather predictable.  What you will generally hear are songs from the classic Alice Cooper band albums (Love it To Death, Killer, School's Out and Billion Dollar Babies) a few cuts off his first solo album Welcome to My Nightmare, two or three songs from this past decade, and lets not forget his most successful hit Poison. that still leaves so many albums that constantly get ignored (it's a miracle that performing Nurse Rozetta even crossed Coop's mind) They could add songs from the Flush The Fashion , Special Forces, Zipper Catches Skin, and Dada.  Hell those later two albums have never had any of their songs played live I think it's about time they get their due. What about Raise Your Fist and Yell, certaintly he can fit Roses on White Lace, Time To Kill or Lock Me Up somewhere in there.  and when was the last time he played anything from Hey Stoopid or Last Temptation or even Dragontown. and hell although I understand why he never plays songs from Pretties For You or Easy Action you certaintly won't here me complaining if he ever decides to add at least one song from either album to the set. I understand that with such an extensive cataloge it's impossible to please everybody but there's still no reason that only 20 - 30% of that cataloge is getting any concert play. Like I said great show, great performance I just wish there weren't so many of his albums getting constantly ignored",1313539200,,1708,4.571895424836601
4229386,5,B003YJ8FQ0,"I was fortunate enough to catch Alice Cooper three, not two but three times while out on his 2009-2010 'Theatre Of Death' tour. While there is absolutely no comparison to experiencing a live show (especially one of his), this live DVD (same track listing as the CD) is a must-have. After I got this CD / DVD title, I was no longer interested in an 'Instant Live' artist-released recording that I had obtained over a year ago. Main reason is the sound quality wasn't as good as this official release. Couldn't believe he opened with part of ""School's Out"". Also loved being able to watch the classics (having new life breathed into them) such as ""Department Of Youth"", ""Ballad Of Dwight Frye"", two songs from his 'From The Inside' lp - title track and ""Nurse Rosetta"", ""Be My Lover"" (cool routine he does with the stripper and straggling the girl - during this number), ""Is It My Body?"", the timeless ""Be My Lover"", ""Killer"", ""No More Mr. Nice Guy"" and the traditional Cooper finale ""School's Out"" complete with Alice donning a top hat and his sword-slicing of the balloons that got away from the crowd. Plus, the new song he performs during this UK gig ""Vengeance Is Mine"" is much welcomed. Highly recommended.",1313366400,,1210,4.685446009389671
4229387,5,B003YJ8FQ0,"This is an excellent show. Alice is on top of his game in this show.

Not a lot of the new stuff on here, mainly old classics so most fans will be pretty pleased with the song selection. Personally the show is fantastic where Alice gets taken out at least 4 times - like Jason you really cannot take him out. Alice is especially vicious in this one - personally taking out a few of the cast himself ;)

Does a few select songs from Welcome to my nightmare, as well as From the inside. But all of the songs are great on this DVD.

Also has a bonus CD of the show (one for house - one for the car). It's not Alice in his heyday. And personally I think the shows are much better these days then they were 30 years again - they're very focused and not as hap hazard as when he was on the drink. He's also a lot more vicious these days too! A must have.",1309564800,,848,3.9186046511627906

I was listening in Dolby Digital 5.1.
  I have been a big Alice Cooper fan for 40yrs.  and to be honest, I could not follow the ""story""  of the serial killer  spider who falls in love with his last  victim..... just a great fast moving show with even better theatrics,  the guillotine scene looked more realistic than ever before!  and the contraption the put Alice in , with all the pointed shafts.. looked cool,  I'm still trying to figure out, how they did that!
  One more note, I saw this same show on 9-28-09 in CT.  except for one thing,  It was raining and the theater roof started leaking after a few songs in,  the show was stopped for a few minutes ...and Alice came out looking at the ceiling,  and kind of pissed,said something like what the f...k  luckily the water was dried up and the show continued!",1290729600,,1137,4.432038834951456

The DVD is excellent and is the complete show. However, the only thing that is a little disappointing is the CD. In order to fit the complete show onto one disc, they cut musical elements out of songs throughout the CD. In other DVD/CD releases songs were simply omitted. With this release they chose to truncate songs. This leaves this listener feeling a little cheated. However, there are the Simfy releases that can be bought for concerts from different cities throughout the tour that contain the complete show without any cuts.
The good thing about the CD is the audio quality. It lacks some of the music but what is there sounds really good. However, a song like The Black Widow instrumental that is a showcase for the band being shortened does it an injustice.
Overall, this is an awesome release and with all of the other full recordings available is not a bad document for one of Alice Coopers best tours in years!",1290470400,,1176,4.55188679245283

4229402,4,B003YJ8FQ0,"For the curious, here's the difference between the DVD soundtrack and the CD content: not much.

The DVD is just over 92 minutes, starting with about 30 seconds of instrumental intro and ending with ""Welcome to My Nightmare"" playing over the credits. Neither of those tracks appears on the CD. In addition, ""Only Women Bleed"" and ""I Never Cry"" are two tracks on the CD, but one chapter on the DVD; this is why both discs list 27 tracks. (The ""Nightmare"" end credits are a 28th chapter, and could well be the album version.) Other than that, the differences seem to be just little cuts to tighten up the show so it'll fit on a CD - 30 seconds here, a minute there, cutting out some of the incidental audio that goes with the more visual ""acting"" parts of the show. I haven't done an in-depth comparison yet, but that seems to be the case from looking at chapter and track times.

The inclusion of the CD booklet was a nice touch, and I found myself wishing I'd bought this in the ""CD with bonus DVD"" packaging instead of vice versa. That way, I could've put my Montreux 2005 and Hammersmith 2009 DVDs together in the Montreux case and the CDs together in this jewel case. Live and learn, though. I really would've preferred that the full DVD audio had been put onto the DVD as high bitrate MP3s, truth be told - that way, one disc would do everything.

Don't let the format nitpicks dissuade you, though - this is a wild show and a worthy addition to your collection, in any of the three formats.",1289347200,4,1495,4.389891696750903

There would be no KISS, Manson, Slipknot, GWAR, Rob Zombie, etc. etc. if Alice hadn't done it first. I saw the ""Welcome to my Nightmare"" tour back in the 70s and was blown away; apparently, so was Alice but I was too young and too in awe of the sounds and stage to notice. THIS concert is, for a number of reasons, even better, as Alice mixes old favorites with newer material, all done with a precision and intensity fitting for a man that has come to embrace both his sobriety and his place in the rock pantheon.

  With 4 executions, some great, no, SUPERB sound, this is a brilliant piece of Alice Theatre Rock. The ever changing master of this medium never does the show the same way, so it always hits someone who likes this or that version. For example, if you don't like this set, then try BRUTAL PLANET, another brilliant piece. But the variation in this work is in such things as having the Schools out reprise done in the Mirror ourfit.
I actually first heard the concert on the CD and it was great in the car sound system. But in 5.1 this is brilliant.

Other than KISS (who even claim to have stolen the over-the-top stage theatrics idea from Alice), nobody puts on a live show like him. There are 26 songs on both the Blu-ray and CD that were recorded in December 2009. The DVD runs for a little over 90 minutes and the CD is about 80 minutes long, but no songs are cut. The 10 missing minutes from the CD is the time he spends on stage doing his typical crazy stuff that we all love.

The picture and sound quality are top notch. Alice Cooper still sounds very good live and the band hits all the right notes. I also liked the all over the place song selection. You still get most of the classics, but we get a song here and there from the more recent albums too. This stage show blows away the one I saw some 9 Halloweens ago. Alice dies multiple times and we get all kinds of creatures and masked men running around on the stage.

If you're a fan this is a must buy of course. I've seen his other live DVD releases and this is my favorite by far. I can't wait to watch it again. Maybe I'll blast it Halloween night and scare all the kids away. More candy for me. Thanks Alice.",1288224000,13,1386,4.073260073260073

8409369,5,B003YJ8FQ0,"Alice Cooper must have performed most of these songs HUNDREDS of times in his career, so I found it amazing how much energy and excitement he puts into this performance. The backing band is one of the best he's had since the classic Love it to Death, Killer, School's Out, Billion Dollar Babies era. Don't expect a nostalgia act or some watered down run through of the catalog, this is FULL ON Alice & band rocking you like the first time you heard ""I'm Eighteen"" on the radio. And for those of you who wonder about such things, he looks and moves like a man much younger than his approx. 65 years. As a long time fan I would have liked a few more obscure but that would have just been more icing since I wouldn't have eliminated a single song from this setlist",1431734400,,761,4.291666666666667

8409373,5,B003YJ8FQ0,I have seen Alice Cooper in concert several times. His show is larger than life. He never disappoints. This DVD brings it all together. I saw  'The Theatre Of Death' tour live. It was unbelievable and unreal at the same time. Would recommend to any fan of Rock and Horror. If you like blood this DVD is for you....,1400371200,,314,4.322033898305085
