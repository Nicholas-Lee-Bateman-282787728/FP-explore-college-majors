8065506,5,B0009R21I8,"Once again we leap forward 100 years are more, and Blackadder is now butler to the feebleminded Prince of Wales (a terrifically funny Hugh Laurie), the son of the mad King George III.  This is the funniest series yet, with Lauries contribution pushing the show up to a higher level.  There are still dull spots, and not every episode is as good as the other, but this does somehow mash almost Monty Python/ Fawlty Towers level genius into a period sit-com.  Atkinson as Blackadder continues to evolve, less dashing and handsome here than in series 2, but more enjoyably (and understandably) angry and frustrated at his situation in life, serving a man with a tiny brain.  Theres also more physical humor in this season, and its pulled off very well indeed",1457222400,,755,4.740458015267175
