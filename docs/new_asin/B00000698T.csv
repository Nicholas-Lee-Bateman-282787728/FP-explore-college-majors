1192885,3,B00000698T,"Set in New Orleans ,this movie centres on a Catholic priest,Father Michael (Ben Cross) who ,despite his vocation does not believe in the devil or in the existence of demons .He comes to see things differently when he takes over a church where the two previous incumbents have been violently killed .It is not long before he finds himself confronting the title entity  a super-demon whose speciality is the corruption and murder of priests .At first the creature appears to him in the form of a luscious and ripe young woman ( Nicole Forher) but before too long it takes its altogether more revolting true form and the stage is set for the concluding battle between Good and Evil as the priest and the demon lock horns-so to speak.

The movie drags a tad in the middle but overall this is a neat little movie which does not stint on sights of the demon and the final confrontation is well done .

The effects overall are good and it boasts a pretty decent cast with solid performers like Hal holbrook ,Trevor Howard and Ned Beatty lending their formidable talents to proceedings .Tense ,well made and stylishly directed this is a good B movie for horror lovers",1124150400,7,1159,4.616504854368932
1192886,5,B00000698T,"This is a fun, entertaining MOVIE!  To say that this depicts the way SAAAY-TAN (insert your own impression of Dana Carvey's ""Church Lady"" here) works is absurd.

There are demons out there, there is evil, but to say that this is how they work?!? Come on.  Besides, that's a totally Christian concept. I like the saying ""It's your Hell, YOU burn in it!""

Now, about the MOVIE: Ben Cross does an excellent job as the doubting father until he is forced to concede that there is something going on.

I liked the concept of the annual battle between the champions of good & evil. Being held at this time of year (after the candle was extinguished) representing Jesus death was a nice, chilling touch...""our Lord lay dead"" to paraphrase that scene.

The representation of the demon Desidaria/Desdarius as being 4 legged instead of the ususal bipedal, horned 'devil' was a cool touch - I didn't expect that.

My only gripe with this flick is that it was never released on dvd.",1098316800,5,969,4.631578947368421

I agree that The Unholy is worth watching-I've seen it several times because it is so funny. I mean we've got priests calling from the dead-ON THE TELEPHONE, no less. My friend and I saw this back when we were in college and have been calling each other as Father Dennis ever since. This movie takes itself way to seriously-this is a great B flick, but certainly not all the raves I've read in these other reviews.

1192910,2,B00000698T,"20 great gory good-versus-evil minutes numbed by a stagnant 75 minute middle.  See this flick, but exercise your fast forward function.

The tone for this classy flick is set in the opening scene as a redhead in a completely transparent negligee seduces a Catholic priest mid-prayer.  This had me very worried that I was in for a smutty horror movie.  Thankfully, after a quick kiss (probably denoting the priest succumbing to temptation), she slashes his throat and leaves a gore-slathered gash that made the horrorhound in me gleefully ""SQUEEEE"" with joy.

So, to clarify, thats both babes and blood'n guts in the first five minutes.  This should be good!  I'll repeat a key word hereshould be good.

Recently and unexpectedly appointed, Father Michael (Ben Cross; Exorcist: The Beginning, Star Trek) joins  and re-opens Saint Agnes Church after he miraculously survives a fall from a building without injury.  Saint Agnes was closed after its two former priests died at the hand of a demon referred to as ""The Unholy.""  Okay, could be cool, right?  Right?

Unfortunately it seems to take this movie forever to get back to the fun.  We had boobs and blood in the first few minutes, then nothing but boredom for the next 75--during which the most Satanic thing we see is a possessed stirring rod, a windy bedroom and a crotch full of snakes.  I get that a crotch full of snakes sounds awesome, but they found a way to make it lame just for this movie.  Unlike so much other 80s horror, this film takes itself 100% seriously.  There are no tongue-in-cheek lines or deliberately ironic death scenes.

No, instead of filling screen time with fun, this film attempts to spin a thick web of dramaand fails!  This movie even managed to make call girls, insane asylums and Satanic cults come off as boring.  Now, I must admit I laughed during a stupid scene when Father Michael's dead predecessor calls him on the phone from Hell.  But overall this is numbingly dull.

So after a good five-minute opener followed by an unwarrantedly boring 75 minutes, our movie is finally reignited by a good old-fashioned gory disembowelment, some burning corpses, a dude vomiting a couple gallons of bloodoh, and the seductress from the opening scene is back.  You now have my attention!

It turns out our naked seductress is the demon Desidarius and, with the help of a fog machine, she transforms into a monstrous infernal quadruped assisted by some little toddler demons.  The finale is loaded with fun, weird, gory, sexual and disturbing imagery, and we get to see a lot of our demon monster.

My best advice to you would be to watch this movie for 5 minutes, then fast forward through the next 75 to the closing sequence.  That will turn a largely boring movie into a way-fun 20 minute gore romp.",1394064000,,2781,4.7635983263598325
1192911,5,B00000698T,"BLU-RAY VERSION
The new Blu-Ray of the unholy is excellent. Great extras and good commentaries. Interviews with Ben Cross and others related to the film. The score related commentaries are about 20 minutes each, and then the extra audio has separate score and the original score for the most part. The print is a great version and worth getting for fans of the Unholy.
--------
Usually if you were in a university residential college (which is mostly unusual for Tasmania and a number of Australian states) renting horror movies was definitely the Friday or Saturday night activity to do if you had nothing else to do. And, if you rented enough of the horror flicks you will be inordinately familiar with the name of the now bankrupt/defunct company VESTRON. I do not know who owns the majority of the titles but I suspect that a European or in particular a British distributor has some key rights to the VESTRON titles. At the time REANIMATOR, FROM BEYOND and the title mentioned here THE UNHOLY were all classic rental titles.
  The unholy is definitely an escapist title, and any criticism about believability is kind of silly in the extreme. Ben Cross became a staple for the kind of role he presented in the unholy and a good comparative example is the first season of POLTERGEIST: THE LEGACY. Films like the unholy were for people who wanted to have a scare and step over that threshold into the suspension of disbelief where you could enjoy a variation on a haunted house story, except that it involved a church, a holy man, and what is in my opinion a very extensive mythology. Once you can get past the suspension of disbelief factor, this is quite an enjoyable film. Ben Cross delivers a solid performance as a man of faith who goes from one who helps people but does not believe in the supernatural to someone who believes because he has experienced hell itself. I don't fully recall the version I saw in the late 80s, but this edit is extremely enjoyable and if you can get it for a moderate price it's worth it on DVD. Unfortunately the US obsession with downloads makes the very nicely packaged European edition quite a buzz.
  As potentially lowbrow as some of the Vestron collection might be seen, it would be nice to have some commentaries or some little extras with somebody who was involved with the production. But, since it has been more than 20 years since I've seen a lot of these titles, all I would hope is that they have at the very least stereo sound, or with a little bit of investment may be a 5.1 surround sound. If I recall correctly there was a Vestron film done in 1986 which involved a possessed puppet and the producer if not the director was Roland Emmerich, and the film is a real gem. Vestron deserves a lot more attention and it's very nice to see titles like THE UNHOLY available in DVD. Nice presentation and an excellent item if you can get.",1391904000,11,2883,4.570599613152805

This movie, even after everything I've seen...gave me the creeps! The storyline for its time, was very well done, the acting was good and the music added to the creepy atmosphere.

Father Michael begins running his parish and soon Desiderious begins her reign of terror and temptation and the battle begins. One of the acts of desecration is a poor dog  being slaughtered then lain on the church altar to both defile the church church and terrorize father Michael.

1192926,2,B00000698T,"Father Michael is called upon by the church to battle a powerful demon, The Unholy, which takes on many shapes in order to lure the righteous into damnation. Will the priest be able to resist temptation when The Unholy takes the form of a beautiful seductress? Camilo Vila's religious thriller is all guts and no glory, a cheesy display of bargain basement effects that lacks a compelling plot. Ben Cross stars as the sanctimonious Father Michael with strength and determination, never allowing the silliness of the creature or ineptness of the script to wear on his performance. What it lacks in substance, it makes up for in gore, however, with enough gut-ripping and throat-slashing to maintain a thread of interest. And hey, Nicole Fortier ain't bad to look at, either. Vila does attempt to inject a bit of mood and atmosphere in Father Michael's final confrontation with the beast, but it is too little, too late after a far greater struggle with pacing. 80's Horror fans can lump this together with THE UNNAMABLE, THE RESURRECTED, and THE INCUBUS for a cheesy movie night from Hell!

1192928,2,B00000698T,"Before I say anything about this film, I would first like to ask why is it that viewers who honestly come out and say that a movie just plain sucks are given a ton of ""not helpful votes"" by the other reviewers? Afterall, if a movie is not good, then it just isn't good. Please don't blame the reviewer for telling the truth and warning others not to waste their time and money on a bad film, and say their review isn't helpful.

So I happened upon this movie the ""Unholy"" and saw all of the highly rated marks (5/5 stars) given by past viewers. I also saw that many read their reviews and gave them a helpful vote. Thus, I bought this movie online to watch, and was really disappointed at the lingering/choppy pace of the film as well as the minimal plot and character development. Perhaps the special effects for this film were OK back when it was made, but I can't see how anyone could sit and watch the final battle where the main protagonist Father Michael stands against the incredibly cheesy powers of the demon ""Desidearius"" (???) without laughing until their chest hurt???!!! I also was extremely amused by the incredibly pointless, demonic phone call from another dead priest who phoned Father Michael just to say: ""Wuz up? I'm in Hell."" Yeah. I wonder what the phone rates are in hell, especially with all that heat and bad transmission?

So at the end of the day please people, please don't be so quick to write off a negative review...it could save others a lot of money, and it could prevent them from having their nights ruined by a complete botch of a film.

The Vatican closes the church until it can find a suitable replacement. A young priest, Father Michael (Ben Cross), experiences what may be regarded as a miracle when he survives, unscathed, a fall from a tall building. The Vatican reopens St. Agnes and stations him there, hoping that his miraculous experience has given him the spiritual strength to overcome whatever evil may await him in the church.

Father Michael doesnt realize it, but his superiors think he is The Chosen One professed to vanquish a demon who manifests itself as a seductive woman before killing sinners in the act of sinning. As Father Michael investigates the previous two deaths, he encounters some unsavory characters who hang out at a local Satanic nightclub called The Threshold.

Made in 1988, the film is essentially a B picture with an A-movie cast. Besides Cross, the cast includes Hal Holbrook, Ned Beatty, and Trevor Howard, all of whom add gravitas to the plot. Director Camilo Vila bogs things down with a sluggish pace, particularly in the early part of the movie. For the most part, the picture plays as a suspenseful horror thriller, but last act scenes involving cheap special effects diminish the overall impact.

Bonus materials on the digitally restored widescreen Blu-ray release include audio commentary with director Camilo Vila; isolated score selections and audio interview with composer Roger Bellon; audio interview with Production Designer and C0-Writer Fernando Fonseca; the featurettes Sins of the Father with Ben Cross, Demons in the Flesh: The Monsters of The Unholy, and Prayer Offering with Fernando Fonseca; original ending with optional audio commentary with producer Mathew Hayden; theatrical trailer; TV spots; radio spots; and original storyboard gallery.",1498435200,,1902,5.25
7904079,5,B00000698T,"Review is of the DVD as part of the 8 Horror Movie pack.

As of this writing, the Bluray versions is not yet available; but the DVD version is wonderful !  Not only is it Widescreen, but it has captions, which is something not always found in a movie of a pack that costs between $5.00-$8.00.  The resolution transfer is great and looks good on Bluray. No subtitles are available.

As far as the movie story is concerned, I agree with a VHS format back cover that states that the movie is more controversial than ""The Exorcist.""  Instead of finding a priest who's lost faith in the Catholic Church and its teachings and a reluctance to face a demon, even when it in front of him, ""The Unholy"" presents a priest (Father Michael) reluctant to accept miraculous events (his physical status alright, even after a fall from a tall building), and a reluctance to believe in the existence of the devil and demons (saying that they are beliefs of Medieval times) even though they are part of Christianity.

But what is more controversial is the Catholic Church official's position of the existence of events regarded as evil and miraculous.  Early in the movie, the archbishop tell Father Michael that witnesses of his fall from the tall building were ""taken care of"" by the Church, saying ""his holiness does not approve of miracles.""  And when Father Michael testifies to the archbishop of his witness to evil entity inside a sadist's apartment home, the archbishop tells him that his parish would be closed if he persists in his claim.  In the last half hour, an archbishop communicates to Father Michael his upcoming confrontation with the demon named Desidarious and how he must resist it in order to prevail.

Is ""The Unholy"" a horror movie?  Yes.  Is it a movie with controversial, theological themes?  Yes, but only if you pay attention to the dialogue.",1497916800,2,1852,4.73208722741433
