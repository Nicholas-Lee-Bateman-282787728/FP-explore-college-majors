8562554,5,B00B4YQVPY,"I loved this DVD. Matthew Arnold does an outstanding job presenting the best defense for the Crusades I have ever considered. Up until now, I was like many other Catholics who were ashamed of some of the actual and so called atrocities committed by the Knights Templar. I've always looked at the Crusades as being a black mark and a failed attempt on the part of the Catholic church, but many of Mr. Arnolds facts offer a somewhat different view of history. He brought out many historical facts unknown to me and also brought out many of the good things that were accomplished by the Crusades that are still being felt to this day.
I now feel that the Crusades are often misrepresented in history books and by the consensus of the people as a result of political rhetoric. This DVD will open your eyes to some startling realities. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who is into the history of Christianity, whether Protestant or Catholic. Yes, the Crusades have a definite impact on Protestants as well. A well presented documentary. Thank you for enlightening me!",1385596800,6,1067,4.711229946524064
