ROUND - A - BOUT!@",1409011200,,35,3.375
8553800,1,B00AMHFQWI,"Geez - what a rip-off.....this concert has already been released (in better, and more complete form) - so get the Live at QPR DVD instead - THAT is the real deal!  This is an embarrassing excerpt...with no documentary (or anything), despite what the cover says.  I have everything Yes, but have no need for rip-off crap products like this.  Who's lame idea was this?????!!!!",1375401600,3,374,4.8125
8553801,1,B00AMHFQWI,"I just ordered the Yes Live at QPR recently, and as the first reviewer wrote, this is just Part Two of that concert, no improvement in sound or video. There is no documentary, nothing extra. This is the kind of product that makes me hesitant to buy video releases without a company of real standing behind them. Shame on Amazon for not finding out more about this product before listing it. It's highly unlikely that I will buy future videos in such a speculative way.",1361577600,16,468,4.517647058823529
8553802,1,B00AMHFQWI,"It's just five songs from the ""Yes at QPR"" DVDs, and none of which are remastered. There's no documentary whatsoever and the cover is from completely different tour. Besides that...",1361491200,21,181,5.066666666666666
