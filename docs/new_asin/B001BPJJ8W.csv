3497757,5,B001BPJJ8W,"This movie is so bad I absolutely LOVED it!  But then I'm a big Mystery Science Theater 3000 fan.  Oh when I think of what they could have done with this movie!!!!  The acting is the worst, the plot makes no sense, it was apparently filmed in someone's backyard, and they have WAY too many shots of toilets for some reason.  You gotta wonder when a ""scary"" movie is rated PG.

On the plus side it's one of the funniest (unintentionally) movies I've seen in awhile.  The acting will have you in stitches, the plot holes will have you cracking up.  You'll spend many minutes wondering how in the world this movie ever made it into nationwide distribution.  And you can certainly watch it with the whole family. There's nothing remotely naughty or scary in it, although I embarrassed myself and jumped when the old lady opened her eyes unexpectedly.  Even so, I'm not sure why it wasn't rated G.

But, there's also something very charming about this movie.  It kind of reminded me of the old Nancy Drew/Hardy Boys series on TV which I enjoyed as a kid.  And it's actually filmed well - not a cheap videotape like you'd expect of an obviously low-budget movie.  The characters were very likable and the sets are as realistic as you can get.  I honestly have never seen so many bathrooms in a movie.  Despite the filmmaker's fascination with toilets, I truly would love to see this series continue.

Really, you gotta love a movie whose hero is saved by 50 turnips and a bag of tea candles!",1221696000,3,1485,4.50561797752809

8284182,1,B001BPJJ8W,"By FAR one of the worst movies I have ever seen. You HAVE to watch it with your friends to see the horrible writing, editing, camera work, and acting! Sarah Landon needs to annunciate, the male love interest wears too much eyeliner, and the male threatened by his past won't stop acting with his hands! Brilliant!",1483920000,,313,4.607142857142857

8284185,3,B001BPJJ8W,"Last week I happened to catch the movie Sarah Landon and the Paranormal Hour on an Encore channel. I very seldom watch a movie during the day, let alone turn on the television, but after reading the title on the menu guide, I thought I would give the movie a try.

  The Paranormal Hour begins with a seventeen-year-old Sarah Landon (played by Rissa Walters) returning to Pine Valley, California to visit her grandmother, Thelma Shaw. Before she arrives at her grandma's, she has car problems and stops by a local repair shop where she hears part of a disturbing story. She doesn't get the full story until she asks her grandma about it, who was more than glad to tell the tale.

  A young man, David Baker, is cursed! On his 21st birthday, which is only a few days away, he will be killed by his dead uncle, Ben Woods. Years ago, Ben's son, on his 21st birthday, was killed in a car accident that David's mother caused. David was known as a good kid and was getting ready to go to college, but then he learned of the curse and cut himself off from the world. He has become obsessed with the paranormal, and is trying to find away to stop his uncle.

  As his 21st birthday nears, his bother, Matt, and his new friend Sarah Landon try to prevent his death.

  Sarah Landon and the Paranormal Hour was released in limited theaters back in 2007 running only at 81 minutes, and was a complete flop at the box-office. I never remembered the movie ever being released in theaters, let alone every seeing it advertised. The ghost curse plot seems to be interesting, but the movie is ruined with bad actors with horrible dialogue, bad camera shots, and not enough action for a paranormal story. Rissa Walters who played Sarah Landon gave the only decent performance, but she is held back by the untalented co-stars. I felt like I was watching a bad TV-Movie rather than a theatrical release. I wonder if they used a first draft script instead of a final one. I sat there for 80 minutes, as I had to find out how it ended, only for the movie to end in somewhat of a cliffhanger, in which the producers were hopping to make Sarah Landon into a film franchise.

  I would only recommend the movie to families, as there is no bad language and nudity. There is some mild PG violence in it. It could be a good way to introduce a clean-cut haunting movie to your kids. Overall, I liked the premise, but I will never watch it again.",1339286400,3,2417,4.4
8284186,4,B001BPJJ8W,"Sarah Landon & The Paranormal Hour is a fun scare suitable for a tween and up audience.  If you are looking for ""movie theatre"" quality writing and acting (like some of the other reviewers) don't buy it.  If you are looking for a ghost story that won't leave you or your kids with nightmares get it.  Because of the way the movie ended I actually got online to find out if this was a book series so that I could buy the books...no such luck.  I would watch a sequal to this film with my tween age kids.  It is extremely refreshing to see drug free, clean cut, teens who are NOT drinking booze and bed hopping being portrayed in a movie...just sayin'.",1337904000,4,650,4.252032520325203
8284187,5,B001BPJJ8W,I love Indie movies and this is one of them. It does have a little cheese but that is what makes it great for me. I don't care what other people think. I think they did great with this movie. Not everyone can get out there and make anything so kudos!,1334534400,,250,3.9215686274509802
8284188,1,B001BPJJ8W,"Hackneyed storytelling and insipid performances are the hallmarks of ""Sarah Landon and the Paranormal Hour,"" an amateur-hour supernatural thriller that has all the professionalism and polish of an F-earning junior high school film project.

Sarah (Rissa Walters) is a 17-year-old girl who goes to stay with her recently deceased best friend's grandmother in a small mountain town in California. The minute she arrives at the place, she's plunged into a mind-numbing mystery story involving curses, avenging spirits, and a whole raft of poorly staged flashback sequences.

The actors read their lines as if they'd never performed for an audience before, either on stage or in front of a camera - which may indeed be the case with some of them - and Lisa Comrie demonstrates no more confidence or competence as a director than the performers do as actors.

""Paranormal Hour"" was the first in what was intended to be a series of mystery films with the Nancy Drew-like Sarah Landon character as the protagonist.  Fortunately, given everything that it's had to put up with lately, the world was at least spared that fate.",1301356800,,1116,5.048913043478261
8284189,3,B001BPJJ8W,"First let me say that this movie had some of the worst acting I've ever seen. As soon as the voice over began, I could tell that Rissa Walters was a terrible actress. The rest of the cast was no better. I decided to continue watching it anyway.

The story was actually pretty good for a movie obviously designed for a younger audience. It reminded me of Goosebumps and Are You Afraid of the Dark. And when I think about it, the acting was pretty bad in those, too. It's not overly complicated- the spirit of a young man's uncle is supposed to kill him on his 21st birthday and Sarah Landon arrives in town just in time to investigate and help stop it. It was a nice, basic ghost story for children.

There were parts that I thought didn't make a whole lot of sense in the story. Why make a big deal about the real estate agent? Why did the ghost of Sarah's friend Megan warn her to get out of the guest house when nothing happened there? But I found myself enjoying the movie despite these things and the terrible acting. The story moved quickly and I never found myself wondering how long I'd been watching. I might even watch one of the sequels if they are ever made. I'd just never pay to watch it.",1281398400,4,1201,4.240174672489083
8284190,3,B001BPJJ8W,"The scene where the guy is sitting inside a circle of turnips shaped like sculls with candles in them in a Halloween mask is worth the watching of this one ( supposed Druid ritual?).  The ""crazy"" brother is almost over the top enough. The costuming of the lead  leaves something to be desired.
For me the romance between the lead and the younger brother should have had more tension or pathos ( something more?)? The spirit villain isn't really scary enough and the sleep walking lady isn't very convincing as a threat?
For me this looks like a lot of first timer errors
in casting and costumes. For instance if the ghost had blood coming out his ears or something, it would have upped the tension level?
The location was pretty good and the old houses were nice:
actually more realistic than a lot of Hollywood products.",1244160000,,821,4.578231292517007
8284191,5,B001BPJJ8W,"I have to strongly disagree with the other reviews. I liked the small town setting, the characters, and thought that the houses were interesting. I thought the story was good, scary, and provided a lot of ""boo"" moments. I was impressed that there was not a lot of bad language, nudity, and gore. I wish more horror films were clean.  Just a good ghost story is enough for me. I'd say this film is like an adult version of a Goosebumps movie. The ending seemed to suggest a part two or perhaps a series which I will be looking forward to.",1223856000,13,537,4.316831683168317
