4482547,5,B004VFYOA2,"I am surprised by the reviewers who are rating down the product because of something which couldn't have been done better. You, Whitesnake lovers would be feeling better if there wouldn't be any video at all? I have seen worse video quality than that. The thing is that you can have it, watch it or listen to it, sound quality is superb. So put your snobish complaints aside and rate it for what it is - 5 star music event for generations to come. Stop spooking people away from buying this. There's no alternative to this release, is it?
  My only little personal remark is since it has some early songs there, I would love to see Cozy Powel behind the drums, but maybe I will be lucky to live long enough to see the dvd release of the 1984 Donington DVD concert. Buy it and enjoy it.",1307664000,5,785,4.297297297297297
4482548,4,B004VFYOA2,"Kudos to David Coverdale for finally releasing an album that long-time fans have been requesting for years.  I'm surprised this was released in such close proximity to Forevermore, but I'm not complaining!

As one previous reviewer wrote, the audio here is fantastic, and not surprisingly, the band's performance is strong.  How could it not be, with Steve Vai, Adrian Vandenburg, Rudy Sarzo, and Tommy Aldridge?

I don't have a problem withe the ""bootleg quality"" of the video.  It's actually interesting to see something that's not HD, but I do have one complaint about the video here.  I don't like the fact that 99% of the shots are individual close-ups of each band member and very, very rarely do you see a wide shot of the whole stage.  So it's a close-up of Vai, then a close-up of Vandenburg, then Aldridge...but never the whole stage.

But hey, I'm just glad to finally have a copy of this great show on cd and dvd.  At the end of the day, that's pretty cool.",1307491200,12,969,4.619883040935672
4482549,3,B004VFYOA2,"I was really looking forward to seeing this DVD when I saw it for release. Well i got it today and am really sad to see how bad the video is. In some cases it looks like a bootleg VHS. It's still good to see this version of the band in a live setting but just wish the image was better. The audio sounds great though, David is in top form and the band is perfect as always. For the price it is worth it but I doubt it will get repeated viewings. Get the version with both the CD and DVD and I am sure you will enjoy listening many times.",1307491200,3,537,3.8035714285714284
4482550,5,B004VFYOA2,"Great show,  Sounds & looks pretty good.  Not the quality of newer DVD's, but still a great show.  Whitesnake Rocks!",1376352000,,116,4.7
4482551,2,B004VFYOA2,"Great concert , music amazing, sure they cld have done a much better set , a few more of 1987??? its grainy , thats not the problem , its the PRODUCTION!!!! almost unwatchable,  black n white shots , slow motion shots , so regular, its terrible. its god 4 a cd , but almost unwatchabe as a whole",1366070400,,295,4.086206896551724
4482552,3,B004VFYOA2,"I'd have to say that this Whitesnake DVD is just ""OK"". The musicianship, stage performance and the camera work is exceptional. But, I was disappointed with David Coverdale's vocals. His voice stared getting irritating after a few songs. If you are a die-hard Whitesnake fan, then you'll probably love this DVD. If not, you might want to skip this DVD and look for another live performance from David Coverdale and the boys. I personally wanted this live DVD because I'm a Steve Vai fan. I used to own a Ibanez Steve Vai Universe 7-string guitar like Vai's and watching him play his Universe brings back memories of how Bad Ass that guitar was. I'm still kicking myself for selling it.",1358208000,,684,4.708333333333333
4482553,4,B004VFYOA2,"As most other reviews have stated...great audio quality and not the greatest video quality (resulting in my 1 star deduction).  Some of the video doesn't even match up with the audio, which is normally a deal breaker for me on a concert DVD.  Regardless, its a cool concert DVD for anyone who was into the 80's rock/metal scene.  It showcases Whitesnake's best lineup in my eyes.  So, its cool to have some concert footage (with stellar audio) of them in their heyday.

If you have any similar genre DVD's in your collection, this one will be a welcome addition.",1357430400,,562,4.636363636363637
4482554,3,B004VFYOA2,"I finally watched this, bought it about 2 months ago......better than I expected......

But, there is no way you can give it more than 3 stars. The quality of the audio would be 4 stars easily but the video is worth 2 at the most. The video is really bad. Let me put it this way: it is a video bootleg quality level.

But I read the reviews before purchasing it and would buy it again. The reason why I bought it was to see Steve Vai playing with David Coverdale. And the band is great with Vandenberg, Sarzo and Aldrigde. The entire band is motivated, energetic and dedicated through the entire concert.

David is singing great, really great.

Another reason for you to buy this is that Whitesnake gets worse every year after this. The real Whitesnake, for me, is the one of the first albums. after Bernie left they still could come up with some good albums, Saints and Sinners, 1987, Slide it In, but as time went by David sung higher and higher, and the music of the band got heavier and heavier. This is not a problem in itself. The problem though is that Whitesnake is not a heavy metal band and David is not Glenn Hughes. That is what makes it complicated. The album David did with Steve for example is one of the bad ones, unfortunately. They did not gel in the studio I think. It was the beginning of the descend.

Anyway, again, in this DVD David still has the incredible voive we know and love and seeing him together with Steve Vai on stage is an event in itself.

Buy it!",1343174400,4,1483,4.297491039426523
4482555,1,B004VFYOA2,"I don't see how anyone could sell,let alone watch this dvd. Quaitly of this dvd is so bad it is now in the trash where it belongs. I tried to review it before I bought it witch I could not. The cover was nice. Crap-Crap-Crap. No Thanks John J Smith",1320796800,,248,3.98
4482556,4,B004VFYOA2,"And seriously, Wright Brothers.. we have the space shuttle now. What were you thinking??

I can't believe people are criticizing this release for 20 year old video technology. Hello, wake up everybody. There was no Hi-Def smart phone blue ray technology in 1990. David didn't claim that this was stellar footage - in fact he made sure you knew up front that it wasn't. But fans (like me) have waited and hoped for 20 years to have something released from that era - and here it is.

I gave it a 4 cause there are a few things that maybe could have been done better - but like David said - it is what it is. And I'm glad to have it. Now, a few of you probably need to get back to watching your hidef Brittney bluerays and let the grown ups watch Whitesnake in peace.",1316736000,,765,4.197278911564626
4482557,2,B004VFYOA2,The problem with this video was it was shot for the concert screen so the fans far from the stage could see somthing. This video was never intended to be seen on your tv screen! Now if you are a Whitsnake fan i am sure you will like it but be WARNED it looks very BOOTLEG. Again it was shot for the concert crowd not for reproduction to be seen on any TV screen.,1315872000,,362,3.9054054054054053
4482558,5,B004VFYOA2,"I was in the military serving in the UK at the time of the Donington concert, and I was lucky enough to get to go.  Still have the ticket stub and the concert book.  All total it was a 13 hour concert with not only Whitesnake, but Aerosmith, Poison, Choir Boys, and Thunder.  It was an incredible show, and I have been waiting for this release ever since I heard it was coming.",1309996800,,377,4.136986301369863
4482559,2,B004VFYOA2,I have many Music Videos & watch them frequently. I was all keyed up to see this video on the music I love. When this DVD started I noticed it looked like it was out of focus some times. It looks like someone in the seats recorded this video & not professionals. I was very dissapointed in its quality. It goes from Black & White to color & back to Black & White ???? I still liked the video.,1309478400,5,392,3.9746835443037973
4482560,5,B004VFYOA2,"I was 18 when this show was recorded and I was a Whitesnake fan since the '87 album. I also collected the back catalog, including Coverdale's work with Deep Purple. I think 1990 is when they hit their peek. I remember seeing clips of this show and I always wished it would be released on DVD. It only took 21 years, but it's finally here. I haven't seen it yet, but I can't wait to relive my childhood memories. After 1990, I think Coverdale went downhill quite a bit. I'm not a fan of the stuff after the 90's.

On the other hand if you are a fan of his former band mate in Deep Purple, Glenn Hughes, he is still awesome.

4482561,5,B004VFYOA2,"When I knew that this DVD was going to be released, of course I was expecting to buy it, but after reading some reviews in here, I changed my mind a little bit. Finally I saw the product at a local store here in Mexico City and I didn't think it a lot and I bought it.
Yes, it's not the best quality video out there, but it's not the worst!! We're lucky enough to see this performance after 20 years!! It's better to have this that don't have it. Period.
GREAT PERFORMANCE, GREAT MUSICIANS, GREAT LINEUP AND PROBABLY THE BEST WHITESNAKE MOMENT OF ALL TIME!!",1308614400,2,557,4.264150943396227
4482562,4,B004VFYOA2,"If you were in high school in 1990 like I was, you remember Whitesnake as an arena rock powerhouse. For those of us who didn't make it to Donington UK for the Monsters of Rock festival that summer, this DVD is the next best thing to catching the headlining act in person.

Others have complained about the video quality here. The source tape is obviously a mid-grade videotape from the time period which has been in storage for the last two decades. It's unfortunate that the event wasn't captured on a higher quality cassette (rumor has it the video is what fans at the show saw on video monitors near the stage), but digital enhancement has made the best of a bad situation. Furthermore, superior re-mixed digital sound (5.1 surround) taken from the official BBC Radio broadcast goes a long way toward making up for the disappointing video. It's puzzling that an inferior videotape is the only official film of this 1990 show when, for example, Elvis Presley's Aloha From Hawaii concert was captured on professional grade videotape in 1973 and makes for a near perfect DVD.

A high-energy performance by the band (a superb Whitesnake lineup featuring Steve Vai and Adrian Vandenberg on guitars) makes this a fun concert video to be sure. I felt like I was transported back to those magical days of glam metal that I remember so fondly. The viewer can tell that after an intense summer of touring and performing, David Coverdale's voice was more raspy than usual at this show. On a few tunes, including ""Kitten's Got Claws,"" Coverdale sounds more like Brian Johnson of AC/DC than the Whitesnake frontman we know. This element somehow adds to the intensity of the performances and leaves one wishing for more concert DVDs from that period. WS Live at Donington 1990 was definitely worth the $ and two hours of my time.",1308528000,2,1818,4.75
4482563,5,B004VFYOA2,"C'mon, people! This was TAPED 21 years ago. T A P E D !!! As in video tape. No digital cameras. No 2011 technology. Most of my favorite bands from the 80's never video taped anything, so for this to exist in any form is a huge plus for me. My iPod and my Sony Cyber-shot digital photo camera record better video than what existed in 1990. I have bootleg concerts recorded within the past few months that look professional compared to this, but the technology in 2011 affords us that. This is a piece of rock history. This is a great concert. A great band. A great DVD to own. I personally love it and enjoyed watching it. I just saw Whitesnake 3 weeks ago and they ROCKED! Get over the quality and enjoy the DVD for what it is - a place in time we'll never get back to. These great, real rock bands aren't going to be around forever. Too soon these DVDs will be our only salvation in a world of boring, cookie-cutter, flavor-of-the-week rock music.",1308182400,7,948,4.272222222222222
4482564,3,B004VFYOA2,"I think Whitesnake's Slip of the Tongue CD is a hard rock materpiece.  Steve Vai added his fire and charm to the band's music already kicking into hard rock territory, pulling away from their blues / rock roots.  When Steve was invited to tour with the band on the Slip of the Tongue Tour Whitesnake peaked as a Live act, going on an exhaustive 1989 - 1990 tour, headlining everywhere.  Oddly enough, there is not ONE professionally filmed concert or show.  The band's day at Donnington was caught on video monitor cameras and Sir David quickly confiscated all camera tapes after the concert avoiding bootlegs to appear afterwards.  So with great anticipation and some low quality boots over the the last 20 years of the Vai-era Snake to whet our appetites, The Cov finally let his guard down and releases Whitesnake Live at Donnington 1990 en masse.  D.C. was quick to say take it for what it is during any promotion behind the release, and if you keep that in mind while watching it you'll enjoy it.  No it's not a professionally filmed concert, yes the video screens show many, and I mean many shots of Vai soloing but the camera is on Vandenberg, and vice-versa, etc., etc..  It's cool to see this, but the question is is it worth repeated viewings?  My answer is no.  Once is cool, but afterwards, there is no more visual excitement.  If you pick up the 2cd / 1 dvd set for a few more bucks then each of the stand alone releases than it's worth having, but if you can't afford both, then definitely pick up the cds only.  The sound quality is fantastic, the video imaging and quality is sub-par.  There was a reason this took 20 years to release, and quite honestly, the video part could stay in the vault.",1308096000,2,1711,4.498381877022654
4482565,1,B004VFYOA2,"I was anxiously looking forward to this video. I actually saw this Whitesnake line up  live concert back in 1990 when I was a baby. It was a good concert. To this day I'm a Steve Vai fan and his performance in the band gave it a twist.
I was hoping this DVD would bring back some good memories. Well? HELL NO!
This DVD is an INSULT. It is inferior on so many levels I don't know where to begin. The editing? The camera work? If a kid had an i phone to film a concert he would do a better job! Coverdale ought to be ashamed of himself for putting this piece of garbage out as an ""official"" release. It only makes himself and his band look BAD.Literally !
When Amazon promptly delivered this thing to my place I anxiously tore it open and put it in the DVD player. When I first saw the beginning of the first clip I was confused. Then when I realized what this VISUAL piece of trash was going to be , in fact, the whole concert experience,  I turned it off and put it away in disgust. What a waste!
I DEMAND an apology. And I want my money back. I was scammed. For you fans out there , Trust me. Don't waste your money!",1308009600,7,1117,4.004484304932736
4482566,1,B004VFYOA2,"THIS MIGHT BE THE WORST CONCERT DVD EVER..I TOTALLY AGREE WITH THE OTHER COMENTS, MUST BE A BOOTLEG. IF THIS IS THE BEST THIS RECORD COMPANY CAN PUT OUT THEY SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES! THE VIDEO IS DREADFULL AND THE AUDIO IS BAD. TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY. I AM VERY DISSAPOINTED.

4482567,4,B004VFYOA2,"...and that's the truth.  After 20 yrs, David was lucky enough to still have access to the raw footage of the show. I read that Whitesnake was the only band in the festival that let the cameras roll for the entire show.  This video was already warned as not even close to being HD, and is actually the footage that fans at the show saw on the big screens on the side of the stage.
  I personally have no issue with the video quality in and of itself.  My issue is that the camera person(s) didn't film David Coverdale enough.  There are plenty of shots of Steve Vais and other members. Come to think of it...there are enough shots of Steve Vai to make one think they are watching a Stve Vai concert.  The CD set is very well mixed by current snake Doug Aldrich.  I suggest, as did someone else here...you go for the CD/DVD combo and you will be very happy to have this in your collection.  You have to remember that Donnington '90 has been the most asked for release since they started their website.  I thank them for releasing this to us.",1307836800,3,1040,4.260204081632653
4482568,1,B004VFYOA2,"For the ones that are trying to justify this crap, no, we the Whitesnake lovers, as I'm since the late 70's, I'm 45 right now, have no excuse to accept such a poor video material in a form on an official release, shame on Coverdale to release this such a crappy poor material like that, period...Why not releasing it as a bonus DVD in their previous DVD, as a collector pack or whatever, knowing of that poor quality??? That will be 100% fair, but this crap (video wise, do not misunderstood me, the material itself is indeed IMO excellent, not the best Whitesnake, but very good) this is unacceptable in the 21st century...and we are not snobbish, as someone called us, we are very consequent with the demands of today's market, and BTW Whitesnake has a lot better eras than this one, a bunch of top notch musicians, did not made Whitesnake what it is today...see the early Whitesnake concerts from the 70's and see what their music is about, music, it is not about a show off, or impressive solos, or clothing, or nice brushed hair, it is about the band as a whole with feeling...

For the ones that are not satisfied, just simply make a copy, keep it in some drawer for a day that you are drunk and want to see something different, and resell the original while you still can, some may say it is illegal, but to me, stealing my money like that, in such a crappy product is also illegal...

PS: I'm a huge fan of Vai, have all his albums and videos as well, but I feel that he was a way too much for what was indeed needed in Whitesnake to sound like Whitesnake at that time, IMO a waste of talent...just my humble opinion...",1307836800,5,1627,4.348684210526316
