1418702,5,B00005AW01,This movie is rated PG.  Can anyone tell me why?,1170979200,2,48,3.8
1418703,1,B00005AW01,"I was very excited about these movies come out on TV a few years back, only to be severely disappointed.  I did not care for Lauren Lee Smith as Christy, or Diane Ladd as Miss Alice.  Smith was whiny and annoying, lacking the conviction Kellie Martin had.  And Ladd, whose work I normally love, was very sloppy, slipping contractions into the otherwise refined Quaker way of speaking.  Tyne Daly did so much better.  Watch the movies once just to find out who Christy chooses if you're dying to know, but beyond that, don't waste your time.",1169942400,8,540,4.583333333333333
1418704,5,B00005AW01,"The three part ""Christy"" series starring Lauren Lee Smith was phenomenal! I've read the prior reviews and honestly I think it all depends on how you approach the new series.  In my mind, Lauren Lee Smith, was the perfect Christy.  Physically she fit the part far better than Kellie Martin did. The chemistry Lauren shared with both of her male co-stars is entirely evident. After viewing this series, I became interested in watching the original ""Christy"" series starring Kellie Martin, which I had viewed two or three episodes years ago. I just didn't find Kellie Martin as interesting to watch in the role of Christy. Her chemistry with Dr. Neil was not obvious. To be honest, their substanial height difference bothered me.  To me, Lauren Lee Smith, fit the part much better. You can believe the attraction between Christy and Dr. Neil.  Since Dr. Neil is played by the same actor in both series, I've deduced that Lauren Lee Smith was simply a better choice to play Christy.  I just don't think I would have been as impressed by this series with Kellie Martin resuming the role of Christy.  Therefore, I am happy that it worked out that new actors in the roles of Christy and David Grantland needed to be cast, because I think the series was made much better for it.  My recommendation is to give this new installment a try, especially if your mind is open to viewing a new and better Christy in the title role.",1167436800,4,1415,4.636
1418705,1,B00005AW01,"The 1 star is for Stewart Finlay-McClennan returning as Dr. MacNeill.  As one reviewer mentioned, Kellie Martin played Christy effortlessly.  While Lauren Lee Smith tries her best, the performance is a bit...bland.  Some lines seemed a bit forced & having seen the CBS series, it was difficult not to be dissappointed--knowing what 'could have been.'  But it is worth the watch just for the story's sake.",1088726400,13,404,5.075757575757576
1418706,1,B00005AW01,"I came into this movie with lots of expectations and sweet memory from the original tv series but only found myself shocked and heart broken.
The previous viewer was right about the problem of charactors inconsistency which was the main reason that destroyed everything good left from the original series.  In my heart, Kellie Martin is always the Christy I remembered in the smoky mountain who was willing to fight for her children and Rand was the pastor who shared God's love in whatever he said or did.
All of the above was missing in the movies and to my worst nightmare, what the charactors portrayed was just the opposite!!!  The only actor I like is Dr. Neil McNeil.  Please bring back the original cast back to the film production.",1051920000,25,740,4.676923076923077
1418707,2,B00005AW01,"This uneven first entry in the ""new"" Christy movies has some good points, but falls down in character consistency.  Lauren Lee Smith displays the necessary perkiness and innocence as Christy.  The story is believable: Cutter Gap families resenting Christy's promotion of ""progress,"" an attractive aviatrix making a forced landing in Cutter Gap and attracting male attention, thieves stealing the little that the Cutter Gap families had.  Harriet Quimby was a real person, and I'd love to find out if she ever actually landed in the real Cutter Gap.
The big problem in this movie is characters acting in ways inconsistent with their established personas.  Miss Alice blasts Christy when she is asked for advice (and frankly, Diane Ladd does not project the combination of earthy realism and spiritual concern that made Tyne Daly's performance so believable).  David is obsessed with building a road to the exclusion of his pastoral duties.  Neil spouts off lines like ""I'm not a monk and I'm tired of living like one.""  None of these mis-characterizations were essential to the plot lines, so they just seemed sloppy.
This movie would be a good gift for confirmed Christy fans, but I can't recommend it to introduce anyone to the Christy shows.",1016841600,7,1243,5.063725490196078
1418708,4,B00005AW01,"This version did include mountain folk ""cleaned up"" and I agree that the original mountain characters, some of which returned here, seemed more realistic than those added for this particular adaptation; however, keep in mind that in the book and TV series Christy teaches the children and some of the women about hygiene and keeping things clean, so she influences them in this way.  One of the ways she makes a difference in Cutter Gap.",990230400,3,437,4.826666666666667

The acting, the sets, and the music was just breathtaking and I love every moment of the movie. You will sure enjoy it, if you have enjoy CBS's Christy TV Series with Kellie Martin! PAX has also aired on May 13th and 14th (2001) a new Christy movie titled: ""Choices of The Heart"" and it details Christy's very special wedding to none other then... Dr. Neil McNeil!!

1418711,3,B00005AW01,"This movie is a continuation of the Christy series that was on television several years ago.  It is based on the wonderful novel, ""Christy,"" by Catherine Marshall.  In this new movie, young Christy travels to a poverty striken mountain village to become the new schoolteacher.  In the tv series, the children looked truly poor and, in some cases, dirty.  In this movie, everyone is cleaned up.  The children are perfect little models and the cove residents are well dressed, with lots of make-up. You and your family might still enjoy this movie if you are die-hard Christy fans.

1418721,1,B00005AW01,"This movie is atrocious! I fell in love with the original Christy series though it left you with a cliffhanger. When I heard there were movies that continued the story, I couldn't wait to see what happened in the lives of all the characters. To be fair, I knew the cast of this movie was not the same as the original with the exception of McNeil and a couple others but, wrongly, assumed it would be fine. There is no real acting in this movie except for by Stewart Finlay-McLennan who is always, always fantastic even with a script like this one. The actress who portrayed Harriet was pretty good. The other characters lacked depth or true personality. Everyone seemed to be reading from cue cards or something. And what's with all the eyes-wide-open, bugged eyed looks??? The accent in the original series was also much more convincing. These people sounded and acted like they were performing a high school play! And the mission looked much more like a modern (for that era) home than a simple, rustic home built by the hands of a single, hard working preacher in the mountains of TN. If I hadn't seen the original series, I'd suggest Dr. McNeil should fly off with Harriet; they had much better chemistry than he and Christy! I'm incredibly disappointed and do not plan to watch the other movies. The only reason I even tolerated this one after the first 15 minutes was to hopefully see more McNeil! Total waste of time.",1454889600,,1424,4.610236220472441

1418738,2,B00005AW01,"Very disappointing. This movie seemed a cheap, not very accurate, nor satisfying, sequel, in my opinion. Everything disappointed except Neil McNeil's performance; although, even in his regard, I didn't appreciate the emotional distance between him and Christy in this story after the passionate ending of the TV series. To me, none of the characters were endearing (except Neil), nor the acting very good. The locale lacked the mysterious and majestic beauty of the series and the 'set' lighting was distracting. Every indoor season lacked the subtle illumination of candlelight. Obvious overhead spotlighting and shadows made it seem unrealistic. I hope the next two films are better, since I purchased all three after viewing the series, anticipating more of the story and quality I loved there. :(",1424649600,4,800,5.357142857142857

1418769,5,B00005AW01,"Please remember, that each of the original cast were asked if they wanted to return and finished the story. But a lot of them chose Not to - including Kelly Martin ( Christy ) and Randall Batinkoff ( David).

These newer Christy films were taken from Catherine Marshall's last known scribblings and notes she had written down for a sequel to the actual Christy Novel. ""The producers drew Christy's ultimate romantic decision from notes for an unfinished sequel Christy novel that were discovered among Catherine Marshall's possessions after her death.""

While I too enjoy the original TV Series with Kelly Martin, I like these 3 new Christy movies just as much - if not more! :) I had been hunting down the DVDs of them and finally found them. Sadly with the Kelly Martin version, they did not stay faithful to the book in a lot of ways.

I can highly recommend these newer Christy DVDs completely. They are: 1. Christy: Return to Cutter Gap (aka ""The Movie"") , 2. Christy: A Change of Seasons and 3. Christy: A New Beginning  ( aka Choices of the Heart part 1 and 2)",1387756800,,1067,4.570680628272251

I was thrilled when the movies came out and watched them.  I was disappointed that the original actors had not all came back, but the story was still worth waiting for. I have bought all of the series and movies.  It was a very good series and lets you see the kind of life the mountain people lived and what they believed in.

GREAT continuity as i said . SO , ""BUY IT , YOU'LL LIKE IT"".

1418797,5,B00005AW01,"Synopsis: In the year 1912, nineteen-year-old Christy Huddleston leaves home to teach school in the Smoky Mountains. But her faith will be severely challenged by trial and tragedy.

This is a wonderful story, written by Catherine Marshall, and based on her mother's life and true experiences woven into a masterpiece of fiction.  For those who live the visual more deeply than the written word, a beautifully produced TV series was aired on CBS in 1994/1995 and is available in its entirety on DVD.  It follows the original story well, departing in various areas, as TV/movie adaptations almost always do, but becomes a living story that holds its own.  Be forewarned, however - the series ran out of money and ended in a complete cliff-hanger (I sat for literally 5 minutes with my jaw on the floor, repeating over and over ""How can they POSSIBLY end it there????"").  However, PAX later released three made-for-TV movies to continue the story and bring some closure for loyal fans (see Wikipedia for the names and more in-depth information).  I was thrilled to find those, but also had to struggle through the disconnect involved in the fact that very few of the original cast members returned for those movies, so most of the main characters were played by different actors (and after two seasons of getting to know certain actors, that's really tough!!).

But, for a wholesome story with real depth, you must give ""Christy"" a try!",1266105600,11,1433,4.896694214876033
1418798,5,B00005AW01,"The movie is wonderful, although I had to return for an exchange because the movie was defective.  I haven't watched the new one yet.  I hope it's ok.",1238371200,,150,4.321428571428571
1418799,4,B00005AW01,What a heartwarming story!  Why can't we have more TV and movies like this!,1207526400,2,75,4.357142857142857

1418811,1,B00005AW01,"If you watched the Christy series and were left dieing the know the outcome...like me, you will be SOO disappointed with this video. The acting is HORRIBLE. It was hard to sit through and actually watch it all (but I had to know the ending!). The quality of cinematography was very poor as well. Don't waste your money on it!!! Truly a let down!!",1207267200,9,346,4.421875
1418812,5,B00005AW01,"Loved this series...it is hard to find wholesome movies to watch.  Have shared with my Christian friends and they are thrilled with them also.  Was a little disappointed that not all of the original actors returned, but this is a must see since the original left you not knowing who Christy married in the end.",1197936000,,310,4.618181818181818
1418813,1,B00005AW01,"I, as other reviewers, was very excited when this movie came out.  I wanted to see what happened after the series ended.  It was a big disappointment.  It did not follow what had happened in the series with a character that left Cutter Gap in the series being in the movie, along with basically the same story line of a student studying for college and his father objecting to it.  There were only two highlights to the movie, the scenery and a few characters being played by the same actors from the series, such as Dr. McNeal and Opal.  But if you are looking for the main characters (Christy, David, Alice, Fairlight, Ruby Mae) to be the same interesting, wonderful characters as they were in the series, you will be very disappointed.  These actors are awful, the scenes boring, and the story lines unoriginal.  If you want to know who Christy chose to marry, read the book or check out information about the ""real"" Christy as Catherine Marshall based the book on the true life stories of her mother.",1191628800,5,1004,4.575418994413408
1418814,1,B00005AW01,"This series is a sorry replacement for the original. Aside from Stewart Finlay-McClelan, the acting is terrible! I would only reccomend watching the last episode for closure from the original, but that's it.",1188345600,12,207,5.303030303030303
1418815,1,B00005AW01,This movie just was not Christy if you want to see Christy watch the original series starring Kellie Martin now that's how it should be played. There was so much about this that I didn't like that I won't even waste time saying it all lol. I don't usually give bad reviews but this one deserves it and I would hate for someone to waste their time and money on this one. Just a bad rendition of the story imo and I agree with a lot of the other reviewers it just doesn't work at all.,1187395200,14,482,4.03125
1418816,1,B00005AW01,"As I had watched the original series, the differences were very apparent in the change of actors, location and characters and even the theme of the story.  It would have been nicer to have had the ending of the original series as the flow wasn't good.  I was very disappointed with their new take on the original series.",1181433600,5,320,4.5
1418817,2,B00005AW01,"I was rather disappionted with this addition to the Christy series.  Not only were hardly any of the original actors in the movie, but the story went over ground already covered in the original series.  I found it redundent and annoying.  The girl who played Christy tried her best but I don't know how you can top the original.  Plus in the end it does not let on to who (the doc or the minister) Christy ends up with.  Read the book for the full story, it is definetly worth it!",1179878400,3,480,4.230769230769231

1418819,3,B00005AW01,"This movie is not like the TV series that we all know and come to love.

It is in my view stand alone movies not relating to the TV series at all.

If you approach the movie not comparing it to the TV series, you might actually enjoy this movie and the other two that follow.

This might not be a 5 star production but in my view it is a wholesome production with reference to God and the Bible.",1173312000,6,395,3.9125

For several years I have been tempted to buy these additional movies but didn't want to pay the outrageous prices; so I finally decided to buy the used but very good option and was very pleased!  By the way Return to Gutter Gap, Change of Season, and The New Beginning is just as good if not better than the original series!!!!  I was also glad to finally witness the love and marriage between Christy and Dr. Neil MacNeill.",1499299200,3,488,4.34065934065934
