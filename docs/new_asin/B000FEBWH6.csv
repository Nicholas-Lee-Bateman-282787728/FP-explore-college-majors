2562397,4,B000FEBWH6,I absolutely love Bridezilla's the second season is better than the first but I would definatly recommend both!,1155859200,4,111,5.222222222222222
2562398,4,B000FEBWH6,"Bridezilla: a bride who mutates from being a perfectly normal human being to being an obsessive-compulsive control freak when it comes to planning her perfect day.

I missed this show completely since I don't have cable, but I'm glad it's on DVD because it's trashy reality television in its purest form.  This show brings stories of Manhattan brides who, according to the narrator, are twice as stressed out and likely to morph into the aforementioned Bridezilla because of the stress of everyday life in New York.

The three featured couples were:

Karen and Emmet:  Karen's a PR director for H&M and Emmett is her banker fiance. They've already been together for four years, live together, and have a three-year-old daughter. Still, this doesn't stop Karen from wanting the perfect wedding down to auditioning different hair stylists, struggling to get the cut of her wedding dress perfect and finding a new florist at the last minute.  Karen is self-admittedly hard to please and they're my favorite couple by far. Karen's meltdown at her wedding reception is the stuff Bridezillas are made of.

Julia and Alan: Julia is a 43-year-old African-American beauty consultant who has been planning her wedding since her childhood. Having waited so long, it's obvious why she gets teary-eyed and emotional almost every time she even talks about the ceremony.  She meets with her wedding consultant two times a week for nine months leading up to her dream ceremony. She's spending her life savings on this ceremony so everything has to be perfect. I don't mention Alan because he's hardly in the show at all except for the actual wedding.

Cynthia and Matt: Cynthia is an actress who is marrying Matt, a stage director.  Accordingly, their wedding is filled with drama.  Cynthia's stepfather is bankrolling the $100,000 ceremony, so she finds other things to freak out about instead of money.  For instance: her therapist who wants to see her more often during this stressful time, her wedding dress which becomes unacceptable at her third fitting, and the hangover she gets from staying out too late the night before her wedding.

Some of the other things to look out for are a thirty thousand dollar engagement ring, a wedding planner who morphs into a Bridezilla, grooms who are completely oblivious and out of the loop, and finally a bride who has had a wedding planner for THREE years.  This 2 DVD set includes eight episodes and a recap of the first season as well as DVD extras including a third season preview and a New York bride cake dive.

This show is funny and it would be great to watch while planning a wedding just so you'll know how NOT to treat the people who are helping with your ceremony.  Besides just the couples, there are interviews with hair stylists, wedding planners, dress designers, and friends and family.  I would definitely recommend it for a low key night in with the girls.",1152748800,16,2904,4.869918699186992
2562399,1,B000FEBWH6,"Awful, i don't know how this show made it to another season after this one and after season 2. Too bad Amazon only sells the two awful seasons, I want to buy the seasons that are actually good.",1397260800,2,193,4.105263157894737
2562400,5,B000FEBWH6,my fiance loves the show and it was worth the price i will be purchasing the second season for my fiance,1382227200,,104,4.0
2562401,2,B000FEBWH6,the shipping and purchase was great....just not a fan of the show.,1380672000,,66,4.583333333333333
2562402,5,B000FEBWH6,I have started my collection of Bridezilla. I will be ordering more. I love watching it over and over again.,1364169600,,108,4.45
2562403,1,B000FEBWH6,"This show is advertised as if you will see brides gone wild. You will see brides become extremely rude and aggressive. You will see brides bringing people to tears. You will see brides fighting with florists and cake makers and venues. You will see brides fight and insult family members and friends to the point of tears.

NOT!

The show plays it up that you will see brides becaome uncontrolable. But. There are very few arguments, insults, or anything at all happening that would even closely resemble the bridezilla monster this show is supposed to be about.

Hardly any of the brides get too upset, or when they do, it's very controlled and mature.

Another fault of the show is that too many couples are introduced and their stories dragged out for too many episodes. You get confused as to who is who.

Honestly, this show is NOT what they advertise it to be.",1302134400,,866,4.597402597402597
2562404,1,B000FEBWH6,"This season is not nearly as humorous as the seasons that are currently running.  The brides ""talk"" about how mean they are and how upset they would be if a certain even happened.  Then nothing ever happens.  The season features one big wedding for 8 episodes with smaller weddings in between that are also dragged out.  I regret purchasing this item.",1274572800,,351,4.704918032786885
2562405,1,B000FEBWH6,"I was introduced to the show during later seasons. The current season (6) had become a bit too overly dramatic, even unrealistic (I still don't think any real bride, would smash her cake). So, I found myself longing for calmer, simpler days.

Enter Season 1 - the result of subtracting the loud, uncouth, rageful brides and replacing them with quiet, tasteful conservative ones - sure they're nice people in reality, but they make for dull tv. This show was simply about wealthy New York women and the irritations that they go through as putting a wedding together becomes their full time job. So, the show is pretty much about people buying stuff ($4,000 dresses, $10,000 engagement rings, etc). This is how the dullsville that is Platinum Weddings was started.

Subsequent Bridezilla seasons had set the bar too high of what a truly demanding bride is for me to be engrossed by this season.",1245542400,,892,4.823529411764706
2562406,2,B000FEBWH6,"I got this season because when it first came on TV I caught it in the middle and wanted to see it from the beginning. Minus one couple, this season was really boring compared to the other seasons. Didn't like it.",1178496000,3,212,4.195121951219512
2562407,5,B000FEBWH6,"The show is great. I am preparing for my wedding in August 2007 and the show, I think informed me of how NOT to act. I watched the show to get some ideas and insight of what people actually go through to prepare for a wedding.  I found that the show is hilarious to the extent that some brides do go overboard with emotions and preparations for their special day.  I recommend this season and the next 2 seasons for all brides to sit back and watch!",1162425600,4,449,4.149425287356322
2562408,4,B000FEBWH6,"I brought both the first season and the second second. Despite the production (i.e.: narration, visuals, editing quality) for the second season is better than the first, I liked the first season's contents better as it is about New York beautiful brides.  I think if you are a will-be bride or if you are a bridesmaid or a brides' close friend, it is worth watching. It helps you understand what causes brides to become bridezillas and what mistakes to avoid during the wedding planning. You will learn how to give her your support and what not to do to add to her stress.  If you are a groom, watching the first season will make you not want to get married. It is a must-watch for wedding planners. This show is not the most exciting show to watch but it is a good documentary of bridezillas.  I would recommend it.",1159056000,5,816,4.4630872483221475
8121524,3,B000FEBWH6,If you are a fan of the later seasons of Bridezillas this season may not be up to par for you. The producers were still obviously figuring out the direction of the show. Despite this the season was decent and I quite enjoyed the brides featured.,1471046400,,245,4.3478260869565215
8121525,1,B000FEBWH6,"I am absolutely returning these DVDs. Wow these ladies aren't Bridezillas! These are rich brides who sweat a little bit under slight pressure. All of the brides are in NY or NJ and most of the vendors are reused throughout epsiodes. Talk about boring! There are no tears, screams, or meltdowns, and absolutely no drama! For such an expensive season I expected the show to be similar to what I'd been exposed to on Netflix. This is nothing like Bridezillas season 10+.",1470528000,,467,4.7073170731707314

8121527,3,B000FEBWH6,"I love Bridezillas so my boyfriend brought me this DVD for xmas.. but this has to be one of the tamist seasons of the series.. the brides are much more memorable and demanding in the later seasons which I love!.. but this one had me bored,the brides where pretty lack luster.worth watching for true bridezilla fans but not collection worthy.",1451001600,,341,4.7

I decided to buy Season 1 and start from the beginning.

This Season put me to sleep.",1421193600,2,249,4.681818181818182
