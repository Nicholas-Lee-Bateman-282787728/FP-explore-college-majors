8352146,5,B002668W4W,"I have been told I am a gifted healer.  Thanks to Michael and this DVD.  At first I thought it wasn't working. Then he told me to concentrate on the audio instructions at the end for breathing and visualization to get the energy into my hands.  It worked and I, or whatever is working through me, have done some amazing things.  I just do what comes to me, but often just putting my hands on the person is all that is needed.  I can do distant healing over the phone or just mentally send the energy, even without the person knowing when I am doing it.  It works!!  This is one of the best things that has happened in my life.",1399939200,,626,4.12396694214876

Stellitano is deeply committed to helping everyone learn to use the gift of Healing Hands and become a healer. After a personal history of his evolution as a healer, he presents evidence supporting the existence of auras and healing energy and explains the body's chakras. Then, in an easy-going, guy-next-door style, Stellitano teaches meditative breathing, how to reach an altered state of consciousness, how to feel auras and how to use visualized colors for healing. Viewers are encouraged to watch the whole DVD, and then re-watch and practice as many times as necessary before putting the work to use. Technique is demonstrated in very specific detail as several clients comment on and review each process. At the end of the tape, Stellitano answers myriad questions: ""Yes, you can heal over long distances."" ""Yes, you can heal plants and animals."" ""No healing is ever wasted."" Stellitano challenges viewers to ""accept your power to heal"" as he shows that the power to heal comes not from a need to be loved, but from loving others.
