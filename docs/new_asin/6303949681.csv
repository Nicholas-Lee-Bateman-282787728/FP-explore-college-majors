7858613,3,6303949681,"Before I write this review, let me state that if you're thinking of picking this film up, there is a 4-movie set titled ""Urban Action"", and ""Black Samson"" is included with that pack for about 1/3 the price listed here.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/4-Film-Favorites-Urban-Action-Black-Belt-Jones-Black-Samson-Hot-Potato-Three-the-Hard-Way/dp/B002U4UZT0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">4 Film Favorites: Urban Action (Black Belt Jones, Black Samson, Hot Potato, Three the Hard Way)</a>

Samson is a strip club owner in Los Angeles, but he's a ""righteous"" dude, and does his best to keep his streets clean of drugs and violence. The mob wants to move into Samson's territory as they see it's been left untouched by the local drug kingpin, and see it as an opportunity to expand their presence.

This isn't a bad flick, but it's a bit slow compared to similar titles in the genre. What action there is, isn't bad, but there are long stretches where not much happens.",1453939200,,997,5.775510204081633
7858614,3,6303949681,"To get an idea of what Rockne Tarkington can do, check this out. I don't think there is another film with him and william smith together. One amazing trivia fact : Both Tarkington and William Smith were the original choices for ""Enter the Dragon."" Tarkington was to play Williams and Smith was to play Roper but Smith was over ruled by Bruce Lee who had script and casting approval. Bruce felt William was too tall and would steal focus by sheer height alone. Bruce gave the nod to John Saxon instead. Tarkington quit at the last minute because he felt he wasn't getting paid enough to be killed in the movie so Jim Kelly replaced him. But to get a feel for the chemistry that would have been in Enter the Dragon, watch this one. Its worth the nostalgia.",1366502400,,754,4.431654676258993

Seriously, this isn't that bad, not if you compare it to a lot of the other low budget movies made in the 70's and 80's. Plus William Smith is always fun. I give it two stars, worth watching on a rainy day when there's nothing else to do.",1212364800,,315,4.015873015873016
