8496492,3,B00116W276,"I always love the comedy of these videos, but I gotta say that I was dissappointed about the sound quality. The background music was overpowering. When the characters are talking, some background music pops in at times but it over powers the dialogue. Sometimes you can't appreciate the comedy because you can't hear it. I don't know about the other volumes but I wouldn't recommend this one.",1303603200,2,392,4.865671641791045
8496493,2,B00116W276,"Although I like the stories, the audio on it was horrible.  Seasons 1 & 2 were great, but seasons 3-10 sounded very bad.  While the characters were talking, there was loud music in the backround.  It's hard to tell what they're saying.  I had to turn up the volume, but after awhile the music just gets annoying.  I love Chespirito and this DVD would have been great if it wasn't for that.  That's why I don't recommend this DVD.  Just get Seasons 1 & 2.",1263427200,,454,4.270588235294118
8496494,3,B00116W276,"The characters in these programs are very humorous and lovable....I watch them on TV for enjoyment, but also to improve my spanish.  I wanted to get one that was subtitled, and that I could start and stop at will when I need something repeated.  Though this one advertises that it is subtitled, it is not. Very disappointing.",1207008000,2,325,4.684210526315789
