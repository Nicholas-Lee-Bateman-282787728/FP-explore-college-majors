8092271,5,B000BTH4MW,"The two gentelmen in this DVD can be described as amateur presenters at best but that is what makes this video worth the purchase. Though there were entertaining moments these guys were a couple of ""average Joe's"" who took their time to explain each step of the beer making process unlike professionals I have seen who seemed to focus more on trying to impress with their beer making ability. That is what makes this DVD a good buy for begining brewers because these guys make it easy to understand and take you through it step by step. It's just like they are there with you.",1298937600,,576,4.495238095238095
8092272,5,B000BTH4MW,"James and Steve teach you how to get started in Home Brewing, and they entertain you at the same time. I am on my third batch of beer and still refer back to this video to make sure I do it right.",1272326400,,196,3.6904761904761907
8092273,5,B000BTH4MW,"This is a very good, simple, and ""basic"" approach to introduce novices to home brewing.  I have brewed several batches and always go back to watch this video.  It's a very well done instructional video that doesn't scare anyone who might be interested in brewing.  Worth the money!",1250640000,,281,4.8125
8092274,5,B000BTH4MW,I Love this DVD!!!  I watched it 3 or 4 times and took some notes before I made my first batch. James and Steve include some really good recipes for first beer batches too. I am the kind of person that needs to see a process done and hear it before I attempt things and this DVD was perfect. If you are thinking of getting into brewing and are looking for a DVD to compliment your Start up books...THIS IS THE ONE!!!,1235952000,,416,4.073170731707317
8092275,5,B000BTH4MW,"First of all, Charlie Papazian's books are wonderful and have all the details you need to get started.  However, if you are like me and have a short attention span or are a visual learner, this DVD is the way to go.  James and Steve step you through all of the basic steps for creating your first batch of homebrew.  I watched this DVD three times, then brewed and had no problems.  Just like on his podcasts, Basic Brewing Radio and Basic Brewing Video, James presents an easy to understand and highly informative lesson on brewing from extract.  The only thing that I really wanted to see that was not on the DVD was bottling, but if you check the archives of the Basic Brewing Video [...], they do a series on small batch brewing where they step through from beginning to bottling.  I highly recommend this DVD if you are starting into brewing and want to see the process in action.  I purchased the DVD and Papazian's books.  The DVD helped me get started and after my first batch, the books helped answer some questions.  This is a great step into the wonderful world of homebrewing.  Cheers!",1208908800,4,1097,4.494949494949495
8092276,5,B000BTH4MW,"I got this book for my son as a companion to a home brew kit I gave him for Christmas.  This is his first attempt at home brewing and has used this book as his ""Bible"".  It is written for the newcomer to home brewing and has been very informative and instructional.  I recommend it highly to anyone thinking of brewing beer at home.",1171324800,,332,4.15625
8092277,5,B000BTH4MW,"If you are a visual person and would like to see how easy it is to brew your own beer, this is a great introduction.",1161129600,4,116,3.68
