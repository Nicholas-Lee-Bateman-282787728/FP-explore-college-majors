3100315,4,B0012Z363A,"Criterion have dealt us the perfect blackjack hand with Alan Baron's 'Blast Of Silence', a jack of diamonds and an ace of spades, at once cold and dark, sharp and velvet edged. The film takes from Aldrich and Fuller and sifts its existential themes through a Godardian disdain for continuity. The beautifully modulated voice over, delivered by the (exiled) Lionel Stander allows the photography to dissolve the relationship between narrative and emotional resonance. We are encouraged to experience the protagonist's(Baron)isolation as a cry of anguish in the newly evolving mediocraty of consumerism. He prowls the night illuminated by the shrill lights of department stores, lurking in the false havens of bars and the kind of New York apartments that only exist in movies. In this sense Baron creates a world just as Jean-Pierre Melville does, a cinema of essentials, a cinema stripped bare of the illusory fullness of imaginary space. The world of 'Blast Of Silence' is the world of actions not motives. This hit man exists only when he is in the game, his search for solace, for love, for affection are always already doomed, just as he is, to take it in the back, him and Jean-Paul Belmondo, falling forever into the projectors smoke filtered light.

3100316,4,B0012Z363A,"Blast of Silence is a low-budget crime drama that's closer
to a French noir than an American one. It was shot on
location in NYC and feels more like a black-and-white
documentary than a movie.

It's a character study with an uncomplicated plot: A hitman
comes to NYC from Chicago in order to make a hit. He
arranges to get a gun from his connection and has to kill
time (no pun intended) while waiting to do the job. It's
Christmas time and that depresses this professional killer
who grew up in an orphanage and has limited social skills.

He bumps into an old friend from that orphanage and
reluctantly goes to a Christmas party. He's an outsider
both figuratively and literally. He's like a more restrained
version of Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver except there is no
doubt as to what side of the law he is on (I still think Bickle
is a good guy though my wife thinks he's crazy.)

By the end of BLAST OF SILENCE, you do feel sorry for
the hit-man, however. There's a bit of sadness in his
misanthropy and you will not soon forget this film.",1221264000,2,1044,4.371134020618556

Allen Barron wrote and directed this anxious thriller, and also plays the hitman. His 77-minute 1961 noir is slim in plot, running time and budget, but rich in the inspiration it clearly offered to Martin Scorsese and Francis Coppola.

""Blast"" feels like a movie that's dated by today's standards but was probably unlike anything else around in 1961, at least this side of French New Wave ~ though it's interesting that Godard's ""Breathless"" was being filmed at the exact same time as ""Blast.""

Barron uses stark black-and-white photography and on-the-fly New York locations to great effect: The storm that serves as a backdrop to the climax is apparently real and is reportedly the only hurricane to strike the east coast during the entire 20th century. On the other hand, one scene shot in the Village Gate features a man who may possibly be the most abrasively monotonous nightclub singer ever committed to film.

The tiny apartments, narrow hallways and buildings of blank windows predict ""Taxi Driver,"" and one tremendously awkward date smacks of Travis Bickle. The clubs and cars and gangsters seem a little like outtakes from ""Raging Bull,"" and one particular assassination could've served as a test sketch for a later killing that appeared in ""Godfather Part II."" One nearly expects to spot Gena Rowlands and John Cassavetes, or the gang from ""Who's That Knocking at My Door,"" bickering in the background during other scenes.

But what makes this movie truly unusual is the narration, written by Waldo Salt and delivered by Lionel Stander, who's probably best known for playing the faithful driver Max on ""Hart to Hart. Stander's voice sounds like something cranked out of a tarpit with a hand winch. Salt wrote the narration in second-person present tense, which gives it the sound of a sympathetic and schooled observer, or possibly even an imaginary friend.

8248335,4,B0012Z363A,"Allen Baron directs and stars in a low-budget noir shot mainly on location around New York City in the early 1960s. Baron is a hit man arriving for an assignment in New York just in time for the holidays. A random encounter with an old school buddy sends his carefully hatched plot spiraling out of control. The film certainly has its problems: Baron's acting is fairly wooden, many will find the nearly continuous narration (by the gravel-voiced blacklisted actor Lionel Stander) distracting, and probably most will wish that Baron's character had turned his hair-trigger temper on the thoroughly cornball bongo player/vocalist in the Village Gate night club scene. But the film has many memorable elements too: the rat-loving gun dealer is genuinely creepy and disturbing, one gets a remarkable tour of many locations in and around 1960s New York, the mainly jazz score by Meyer Kupferman alternately blasts, jangles, and swings, and the final desolate scene hits with blunt force. I was drawn in enough to notice a comical discontinuity: rat man walks by the Village Barn where the Lou Harold Orchestra is playing, while seconds later Baron, who is tailing him, passes by and Gerri Gale is the featured performer. Regardless, this gritty early independent film is well worth viewing.",1388188800,,1286,5.099526066350711
8248336,4,B0012Z363A,"""Blast of Silence"" is a 1960s thriller about a hit man who comes to New York to do a job during the Christmas season. When he gets to New York he runs into old friends who make him want to leave the business. This conflict is well-represented in the lead character, played by Allan Baron, who also directed the movie. Baron reminds me of a Robert DeNiro of an earlier time. He's quiet, immensely conflicted, and undeniably cool.

This movie is a low-budget film noir, and it's got some flaws. Mostly, the acting is uneven and the story has a lot of second person narration. ""You get the creeps,"" for example. It's an original idea and I'm not entirely sure it works. But the cinematography and atmosphere of the film, presented in black and white, is fascinating. The movie shows New York City as a desolate wasteland of loneliness at Christmas.

8248338,5,B0012Z363A,"This film bridges the gap between classic 50s noir, and the more
complex, improvisational dark NYC films to come, first by Cassavettes,
and then by Scorsese.

Very reminiscent of, if not as psychologically complex, surreal, and
twisted as, the writings of Jim Thompson.

A hit man from Cleveland comes to New York for one last job.

The film uses 2nd person narration - 'You feel this', or 'You sense
danger'. It's an interesting technique I can't remember encountering in
a movie before, which plays with your head in a good way. Who's
narrating the film? Obviously the 'you' is the main character, but by
subtle implication it makes US him. The narration was written under a
pseudonym by the great blacklisted writer Waldo Salt.

Beautiful, stark and depressing photography - which I guess describes
the film as a whole as well.

A couple of terrific, odd supporting characters add to the nightmare
atmosphere. While some of the acting is variable, and a few twists are
too telegraphed, this is a film that has stuck with me.",1319241600,3,1027,4.8125
8248339,4,B0012Z363A,"I enjoyed the extras more than the movie. The documentary where Allen Baron breathlessly spoke about his unheralded film in 1990 and 2006 tied it all together for me. I believe the film itself is something I wouldn't have stayed with for long while channel surfing. I found this at the library and the scenario described on the case sounded too interesting to pass up. Beautifully shot and good acting despite the budget, it reminds me of The Hustler or Taxi Driver. Nearly every character in it could be taken as a loser. Frank Bono seems be unhappy in both possible futures: loner assassin or married architect. He could have easily been a popular guy if only he'd let friends get near. Big Ralph appears to have a single room apartment full of hamster cages and a bathtub covered with a plank so it can be used as a table.

It would be like if Robert DeNiro made a film in 1961 and then never acted again. Only directed. Baron is fascinating!",1294358400,2,945,4.494186046511628
8248340,5,B0012Z363A,"Director/star Allen Baron's skill as a comic book artist shines through on this remarkable no-budget noir masterpiece about hitman Baby Boy Frankie Bono just in from Cleveland for a bad Christmas in the Big Apple. Baron's film does have the look of a living comic book with Frankie moving from panel to panel, well-framed and perfectly composed, each shot almost a drawing. I can even imagine the thought bubble above Frankie's head. In fact, a little comic book illustrating this very concept comes packaged along with the dvd.
Bleak, existential, realistic...we watch as Frankie sets up his hit and kills time in NYC. Fate, the leading character in so many noirs like this one, steps in at the end to deal with Baby Boy Frankie. Well made and very well acted by mostly unknowns, this is one not to be missed. The extras, including a trip with director Baron back to the NYC locations 30 years later are fantastic.
I can well recommend this tight little classic to all lovers of the noir style, especially those who love French gangster films/ New Wave being produced around the same time. Definately 5 stars!",1250208000,,1110,4.786458333333333
8248341,3,B0012Z363A,"I liked the film but mostly as a camp B movie and low budget first film.  The Criterion DVD quality is excellent.  The extras are very good.

I love the NYC tracking scenes.  The City and the photography is the real star of the film.  Like Kubrick's Killer Kiss, you see the director's  photography background.

The narration is terrible and never needed to be included. Without all that nonsense it would have had some mystery to it and could have been mistaken for French or Italian noir. The written narration itself wasn't really bad but the spoken delivery was just bad and total cornball and all in all was not needed at all.  It took away all the mystery.

The Conga player should have irritated Bono enough to get taken out back and shot---that would have been ""cool man.""  The film's problems can be excused as bordering on parody of 50's noir films and TV.  Reminded me of various less supernatural Twilight Zone episodes and I almost expected Rod Serling at the end....""Frank Bono....blah blah...is now in the ""Twilight Zone."" Also reminded me of the 1948 film and TV series, ""The Naked City"" at times.

I like most of the music (except the horrid Conga player singing his obnoxious ""avante garde"" poetry.)  I can only excuse it as a parody of 50's Greewich Village.

I noticed that the film's composer lifted or imitated a riff from Bernard Hermann's North by Northwest---the scenes where Franky is trailing the Fatman and also when Franky is escaping the scene of the hit. You also hear it twice in the excellent Documentary.  I wonder if Baron even realizes it? He probably does.  At that point, the soundtrack shifts from the jazz sound and goes orchestral, with a very close imitation of the famous, high-tension,  Hermann riff.  Not exact, but I noticed it immediatly.

Afterall, Hermann  was the greatest composer for thrillers, so looking to him for some high-tension music, would not be unusual--No way Meyer Kupferman (the composer)  did that riff that close to the  ""North by Northwest,"" theme by accident.  The same riff has other Hermann variations in Vertigo, Psycho and later, Marnie.

Recommend viewing despite it's obvious problems, just for the NYC walking scenes, the Rat scenes and that bizarre club scene.  I also like the Club bathroom scene with Flies, buzzing around and landing on the fatman and Bono.  Very over the top noir house flies.

I think it misses the mark to seriously start comparing it to the better film noir classics.  It's really pretty camp.",1233446400,6,2494,4.791079812206573
