8080097,5,B000AXFSWM,"To be honest, before viewing ""Freedom to Marry"", I thought that marriage for same-sex couples was an unnecessary frill -and that the provisions of ""domestic partnership"" should be enough to protect them legally while ""commitment ceremonies"" should satisfy them emotionally.  I was wrong.  The film made it very clear that the rights granted under most domestic partnership laws don't come anywhere near the rights granted to legally married couples.  It also brought home to me why marriage itself is such an important human right.  A commitment ceremony is all well and good, but a marriage is the real deal and if you love someone, you want and deserve it all.  Freedom to Mary is a powerful film; powerful in a quiet and very personal way.  It provides a peek into the lives and deep emotions of some very likable, smart and courageous same-sex couples.

  The film also has some wonderful footage of the historic moment in time when mayor Gavin Newsom flung the doors of San Francisco's city hall wide open and hundreds of same-sex couples were married.

  ""Freedom to Marry"" is a moving film on so many levels - see it and show it to your friends and families.  It can change hearts and minds.",1128556800,19,1198,4.757281553398058

This film is definately one that you will want to own! It is very educational and I believe it is a must see for everyone, no matter what your views are on same-sex marriages!",1127433600,13,309,4.421052631578948
8080099,5,B000AXFSWM,"Bravo on a great piece of work. It'll go a long, long way toward

de-mystifying and un-demonizing the gay marriage movement. The folks in your film are much more ""like"" everyone else than they're ""unlike."" You might actually cause some people to think: ""Gosh, that could be me up there, denied my legal rights and forced to ride in the back of the societal bus!""",1127347200,12,362,4.569230769230769
8080100,5,B000AXFSWM,"Freedom to Marry is a gripping film that puts a human face on the issue of marriage equality. I have seen this film 30 times and every time it still makes me laugh and touches my heart. Audiences around the country have adored this film. Comedian Margaret Cho is hilarious in arguing why same-sex marriage must be legal, from how ice sculptures at gay weddings will end the financial deficit to how it's really Britney Spears who is ruining the ""sanctity of marriage."" The incredible couples in this movie and their children will speak to even the biggest skeptics of marriage equality. This is a great gift for friends and family and an informative attention-keeping teaching tool. Re-live San Francisco's Winter of Love. The revolution will be televised!",1127174400,9,756,4.9140625
