2196229,3,B0006UEVNQ,"From where I am sitting The Blair Witch Project pretty much nailed this concept the first time and lightning really doesn't strike twice.  However, this film does bring it's own personal quirks to the game and what results is a successful (barely) movie.  It does not succeed because it dresses a horror film up as a documentary (they even go so far as to continue the ruse on the commentary track).  Rather, it works as a battle between Hollywood and cinema.  Zak Penn does a great job vilifying himself as a nitwit who uses supermodels as crew members and guts the radio all in the name of production value. It did seem a little odd that the guy who wrote Elektra spoke of wanting credibility, but therein lies the magic of this film.  By lampooning his own history of making trash he created a film that wasn't trash.  That said the film is clever, but doesn't quite know how to deliver the laughs that it should.  Penn and Herzog work great together, and the way they use the mystique that is Werner Herzog is at times brilliant.  ***1/4",1110585600,3,1041,4.5
2196230,2,B0006UEVNQ,"This film cleverly comments on myth and also specifically perpetuates the myth of the Loch Ness Monster. Granted, it does this in a way that demands the viewer to almost humor the movie and give it props for trying.  I found that none of the gags were ever quite funny enough and the acting was often not good enough to pull the wool over my eyes.

What I will say having been a Loch Ness Monster fan as a child, was that the fairly anti-climatic climax of the film where the creature attacks the crew was fun. Not anywhere near as kick ass as Jaws though.  We never really get to see the Loch Ness Monster in this film. This is a sad thing as this film certainly didn't have enough laughs or acting to carry itself, and you just feel let down when the film ends. A retarded CGI of the beast would have made it all better! Two people drown but we don't believe it anyway. We really don't care. What did the movie accomplish? I am not sure.",1110499200,3,939,4.176795580110498
2196231,3,B0006UEVNQ,"What an odd little film this is.  It may be the first movie in history to be a fake documentary about the making of a fake documentary.  The story is this: real-life cinematographer is making a movie about real-life documentarian Werner Herzog.  Herzog is about to shoot a movie on Loch Ness about the monster.  They do and then everything goes wrong.

This movie is about a lot of things and I think it would have been better if it chose to be about only one.  First, it is about the clash of Independent and Studio filmmaking.  Werner Herzog is possibly the greatest living independent filmmaker.  In this movie, his producer Zak Penn (playing himself) is a big-budget screenwriter who lies to Herzog, hires actors, and tries to turn Herzog's documentary into a piece of Hollywood drivel.  Then, the ""real"" Loch Ness Monster attacks the boat and they all become stranded in the middle of the lake.

The rest of the movie can't decide if it wants to be a Blair Witch Project horror movie or a comedy about the Hollywood system.  It's not a bad film, but it gets silly.  We have Werner Herzog going hand-to-hand with the Loch Ness Monster and pretending that he really exists.

I love Werner Herzog - he is one of my filmmaking heroes.  His fans will certainly be interested in this film.  However, considering the great contributions that he has made to cinema, this isn't one of the films we want to remember him by.",1109894400,6,1418,4.571428571428571
2196232,5,B0006UEVNQ,"I saw this movie when it was in limited release last year.  It's a solid movie very much in the vain of Best In Show.  I didn't know who Werner Herzog was, but found his dry sense of humor fantastic - he carries the movie and is very convincing (you'll know what I mean after you see the film).  I went into the movie with no real idea what to expect and enjoyed the ride I was taken on.  I strongly recommend this film for fans of Christopher Guest's films.",1109635200,4,458,4.055555555555555
2196233,5,B0006UEVNQ,"I used to be such a huge fan of Christopher Guest's movies but it seems to me that recently, they've all started to feel exactly the same.  The same actors, the same jokes... I'm bored.  That's why I was pleasantly surprised when I came across this movie at a film festival.  If you like mockumentaries, this is like a breath of fresh air.  It's the story of how Werner Herzog tries to shoot a documentary on the Loch Ness Monster but everything goes horribly wrong.

Part of the brilliance of the movie is the use of Werner Herzog as the lead character.  As a fan of his, I never could have imagined that he would have appeared in a film like this.  The film sends up Herzog's reputation of being demanding and violent on the set perfectly... for example, in this movie, demonic producer Zak Penn pulls a gun on him (echoing the near-legendary confrontation between Herzog and Kinski in Aguirre).  There are a lot of moments like this for the cinefile who knows enough about the director to be surprised and amused.  Kudos to Werner Herzog for being such a good sport.

I should also point out that I have no interest in the Loch Ness Monster, but this movie kept me riveted by focusing less on the monster and more on the loons who think the monster is real.  Special mention must be given to the ridiculous and insane Cryptozoologist who almost steals the film.  Basically, anyone who is a fan of Werner Herzog or just wants some good laughs must see this film.  I am definitely looking forward to Herzog's next adventure...hopefully in search of Big Foot or something...",1109203200,19,1574,4.539007092198582

2196242,3,B0006UEVNQ,"Film directors with serious accomplishments to their name sometimes want to indulge in some light~hearted fun to stay sharp, but not have to be entirely passionate 24 hrs. each day. So they produce a 'mockumentary' such as this one by Werner Herzog. The funny thing is: he truly does know how to make major-motion pictures very real and engaging ~even-though THIS one's just an exercise for fun ~about the Loch Ness 'monster'.
  His attention to detail focuses on the personalities involved and he caricatures them brilliantly. and with subtlety. Of course he brings the entire production to Scotland where the legend lives. And he's very candid about the fact that it's a hoax, for starters. But he allows his entourage to become entirely carried~away with their own self~importance to this ridiculous project and THAT'S the basis for the humor in this story. They ARE funny, the crew who try to help as professionals, who're being paid to do a job (however pointless). They end~up having their clocks cleaned and their asses kicked by the Loch Ness monster ANYWAY. You laugh at how scary the thing suddenly becomes. Is Herzog a genius? I think so. This is a film you CAN show to young people say, on Hallowe'en night. Or in the dead of winter. lots of popcorn. It's FUN.",1465257600,,1272,4.80365296803653

I may be a novice when it comes to movies, but I will say this. My grandchildren wrote and produced better than he could and that was when they were 7 years old. And anyone who agrees to be in one of his movies better beware. As I watched this, I saw him taking advantage of everyone around him, lying, and cheating them. I feel for the families of those who died. Yet, all Zak could say is how if you watch any film, people die. The problem is that those people will live to make other movies. I suspect the ones who died in this one will never be seen or heard from again. He should be put in jail at least manslaughter for tampering with the radio.",1464998400,,800,4.00625

Really disappointed as its not up to par with other Herzog films. As for those who died in this drama, I don't even believe that.

SEE THIS FILM WITHOUT READING ANY REVIEWS. You will enjoy it to the max if you do as I suggest. All you need to know is the description provided on the TV guide: A filmmaker follows director Werner Herzog as he travels to Scotland to make a documentary about the Loch Ness monster. You also should be familiar with the fact that Herzog is a major German filmmaker who has made some great dramatic films and who, I believe, has turned to making documentaries over the past 20 years or so.

2196327,4,B0006UEVNQ,"Werner Herzog is one of the most respected filmmakers of all time and a praised documentary filmmaker. Zak Penn is a Hollywood screenwriter who has written films like Suspect Zero and The Incredible Hulk. With this film, a mockumentary, the two poke fun at these facts in what, at times, seems more like a real documentary than not.

It begins with Werner Herzog talking to John Bailey about his life and work for a documentary Bailey is making called Herzog in Wonderland. Herzog's next project is a documentary on the Loch Ness Monster entitled ""Enigma of Loch Ness,"" which is to be produced by Zak Penn. On July 27, 2003; Herzog and Bailey's film crew depart for Scotland, with Penn noticeably uncomfortable with a crew following Herzog. With the crew soon on a boat searching for Nessie, everything begins going wrong and Penn's ulterior motives for making the film are revealed to Herzog's disdain.

The ""plot"" of the film is intercut with interview segments. Also in the film is a loving homage to one of the more famous Herzog myths, where Penn pulls a gun on Herzog for refusing to shoot a particular scene. And, of course, Nessie makes a few (albeit brief) appearances.

I honestly don't have much to say about the film. It's interesting and better than Christopher Guest's previous mockumentary, but Incident at Loch Ness does grow tedious at times. The Loch Ness Monster and Werner Herzog are both incredibly interesting subjects and while watching this I couldn't help but think about how a real documentary on Nessie directed by Herzog probably would've been more interesting. However, Herzog is hilarious here and his willingness to make fun of all his career achievements is almost worth the price of a rental.

If anything, Incident at Loch Ness does feature one scene which I absolutely loved. Herzog's ""underwater scene"" was particularly wonderful and stood apart from the rest of the movie.

Incident at Loch Ness could've been a masterpiece with the talent involved but alas it's not. However, if you're even a little bit familiar with Herzog and/or the slightest bit intrigued by the Loch Ness Monster, the film isn't a complete waste of time. A lot of it is even quite amusing. A stand-out among non-Guest mockumentaries and for that reason alone it gets 4 stars rather than the more realistic 3.

2196329,4,B0006UEVNQ,"A truly scary documentary about the moment man finally comes in contact with a prehistoric monster which, up to the release of this film, has totally been hailed as one of the biggest hoax of modern day.  Hollywood dude Zak Penn teams up with famous German dude Werner Herzog to embark on a journey to Inverness in Northern Scotland where the Loch Ness, a lake, resides.  Shortly after Werner arrives, it becomes so clear that Zak Penn, as the producer has like, a totally major Hollywood production in mind, whereas Herzog thinks he is set out to make another Herzog meditation on the human nature and the pursuit of dreams.  As if!

When things start to fall apart, Herzog threatens to walk off, but instead other crucial crew members jump ship in the middle of the night.  What follows is just so like... unbelievable!  OMG! SHUT UP!!!!!! Here for the first time is totally clear, totally uncut totally unaltered images of the awesome Loch Ness Monster, totally unrehearsed, totally real.  This documentation will finally convert all the naysayers into believers.

Yeah yeah, the bookworms might harp and carry on about this film being an allegorical vehicle on the creative act that goes into film-making, that the search for something that doesn't exist is a metaphor akin to a sea captain's white whale, a president's WMD, or every man's lifelong search for the unattainable.  They may even add that Zak Penn is the embodiment of the capitalistic concept of film as entertainment, achievement as winning versus Werner's notion that film as revelation, and a discovery of the self.  Or they will haughtily observe that this film may be inspired from that other film from the 60s, the happening in the park, Psychosymbioxtstatsis, or that the mythical creature of the Loch Ness, is in fact, Werner, and that the notion of adventurous film-making, which Herzog pioneered and which so many of us believed in once, is now quickly being replaced by the easy CGI computer generated films, where an ant could easily push a steam ship over a mountain without even yelling at the cinematographer for a burger.  Like...whatever!

But let's face it, all these heady intellectual discussions pale to the moment you see what we all come to this movie to see.

Everyone's really mean to Zak Penn though.  I deduct one star from this film for Werner being such a total jerk to Zak.  It's totally uncool that a guy who does a movie about the Dalai Lama could turn out to be such a complete frienemy.  If you listen to the audio commentary on the second round, you will get more of it.  I honestly don't understand it.

Zak's just doing exactly what Werner does in all his films.",1230681600,2,2667,4.760869565217392

2196331,4,B0006UEVNQ,"Incident At Loch Ness is one of the best mockumentaries ever made. While not quite there with This Is Spinal Tap, it is a cut above many of the other contenders. The reason for this is because its star is German filmmaking legend Werner Herzog (who could be a Teutonic doppelganger for Gene Hackman) of Fitzcarraldo fame. The basic premise is that Hollywood screenwriter turned producer Zak Penn (played by the real Zak Penn- as all the folks in the film are `themselves') recruited Herzog and some other well known Hollywood types to dupe the press into thinking that Herzog was making a documentary film called The Enigma Of Loch Ness, all the while another filmmaker named John Bailey was shooting a documentary, called Herzog In Wonderland, about the making of that fictive film. Given the fact that not a shred of evidence for the existence of the Loch Ness Monster has ever been found, in nearly two thousand years, what this film is, then, is a fictive documentary on the making of a fictive documentary, or a hoax about a hoax about a hoax, or meta-meta-fiction. Yet, this does not imply the film is self-serious, in the least. Unlike, say, The Blair Witch Project, aka The Least Scary Horror Movie Ever Filmed, Incident At Loch Ness is played just for laughs, and, putting aside the absurdity that someone like Herzog would even undertake such a project, the real test becomes how many viewers will be gulled into thinking the film is a real documentary, for how long, and what will tip them off?
  The narrative in a nutshell- Penn, Herzog, and crew head off to Loch Ness, where they have some hilarious misunderstandings, including Herzog's threatening to walk off `his' film, because Penn- the character in the film, not the real director of the film- is trying to `spice up' Herzog's `serious' documentary with such things as fake Nessie props, and a gorgeous brunet Playboy Playmate Of The Year named Kitana Baker.... despite its vast superiority, Incident At Loch Ness did a fraction of the business The Blair Witch Project did. That mystery may, and should, end up the next `documentary' subject for Herzog to tackle.",1221177600,,2133,4.809264305177112

2196333,1,B0006UEVNQ,"Werner Herzog always will go down as one of the most enthusiastic directors of our time as a man who consistently sought/brought new images to the consciousness of cinema. As such I personally consider him a saviour through which I can vicariously enjoy the act of creation. With all that said, this mockumentary is an absolute travesty to behold. Herzog of all people is the least suitable (genuine) person I can think who would want to be made a caricature of and mocked. His work is so vastly his own art that I just cannot understand why he would participate in something like this which then trivializes him by making him the crazy fool. If one can imagine Roberto Benigni dressing up as Bozo the Clown and going through the sets/locations he used for La Vita e Bella, all the while making jokes and being filmed, then you have accurately gauged how 'Incident at Loch Ness' portrays Herzog.

Grandiose analogy aside, in the past Herzog has made light of himself, for example, by eating his shoe when he lost a bet to a friend. He subsequently lamented on film at having being put into that situation by his own grandeur of character. Even then Herzog was able to use that as a spearpoint to hurl about some inspiring cinematic ideas; in this there is nothing that comes close to being even atlatl in that regard. Furthermore there is also nothing new 'Incident at Loch Ness' brings to the 'field' of mockumentaries either; it neither invented the 'genre' nor re-invented it in any way than in pure amounts of trite.

Avoid this in any way possible as the death screams of Herzog being torn apart by this bear of a picture is a most unpleasant thing to have to waste time in witnessing.",1216339200,,1690,4.5927152317880795
2196334,4,B0006UEVNQ,"Let me start out by saying that this film is best watched with no prior knowledge of it so I'm delivering this review as spoiler-free as I possibly can while stil giving you a solid overview.  It you're interested, go see it.  Otherwise, I'd recommend you further research it only after you view it so that you can truly enjoy what a bizarre and brilliant little piece of independent filmmaking this is.

The film begins with legendary director Werner Herzog setting out to film a documentary about the Loch Ness Monster phenomenon, letting us know right off the bat that he isn't a believer and that he wishes to explore the human psychology that allows us to believe in such a thing rather than engage in any sort of monster hunt.  Accompanying him is big shot Hollywood producer Zak Penn, who never lets us forget that he's, well, a big shot Hollywood producer.  His vision of the film-to-be differs greatly from Herzog's more enlightened one and the two butt heads constantly as Penn cosistently outdoes himself on the douchebag scale, attempting to spice up the proceedings at the expense of the film's integrity by adding a manic supposed crypto-zoologist and a playboy model posing as a sonar expert to the crew among other things (matching jumpsuits?).  These touches are an endless source of amusement and insanity that mocks the process of modern mainstream documentary filmmaking by dissecting it, laying it out for all to see, and making you wonder: is there even such a thing as a true documentary, and are we all so easy to dupe?

References to Herzog's storied past abound, and the film continually pushes the limits of believability without ever letting you know just where reality ends and Hollywood begins.  Assuming you go into this film cold there will be a point where you will shake your head and laugh at yourself, Zakk Penn, and Werner Herzog at the obviousness of it all.  Where that point will be will probably vary from viewer to viewer, but you can't really say there's anything quite like ""Incident at Loch Ness"" out there.  The cynicism, goofy score, dry wit, colorful crew members, and bizarre happenings of this film will certainly give you a new perspective on this kind of moviemaking if nothing else.

Werner Herzog is nothing if not unique, and this is considered by many to be among his most bizarre and creative works.  While Zak Penn  impressively gets the director credit on this (Herzog produced and starred among other things), I think we all know who the true visionary is here.  ""Incident at Loch Ness"" lures you in with the promise of a legendary filmmaker exploring Loch Ness while skewering both Hollywood and the ""docutainment"" industry; daring the viewer to draw a line between real and staged human insanity.  This film is definitely not for everyone.  It starts out pretty slow and the humor and cynicism of it all may fly over the heads of some folks who were expecting either some sort of horror film or a straight documentary, but fans of the avant-garde should find this movie to be a breath of fresh air.  Check it out.",1201478400,2,3075,4.75
2196335,3,B0006UEVNQ,"The one thing that kept me from giving this film four stars was the ""Blair Witch""-like sense of doom hanging over the survivors clinging to the sinking boat in the last sequences.  (I'm not giving anything away: one of the first shots is of floating wreckage and a body at the beginning).  The last scenes made me wonder what a serious film of a darker threat under Loch Ness would play like.

But otherwise, this is still a pretty funny mockumentary that had laugh-outloud moments, usually involving the obnoxious ""producer"" making incredibly stupid statements or clashing with film director Werner Herzog.  That Herzog has dealt with crazy people on film before--like maniac Klaus Kinski in ""My Best Fiend"" and nutjob Timothy Treadwell in ""Grizzly Man""--makes him a perfect choice as the harried voice of reason trying to work with someone way over their head.  Herzog's reactions to super babe Kitana jumping into the loch in a string bikini or walking in on the producers with their fake monster are hilarious.

Is this for everyone?  I have no idea.  The sudden shifts in tone, from serious documentary in the first third, to Spinal Tap-like hilarity on the loch in the middle, to the final third in a foggy danger, might throw off most people...but I liked it.

(It might help if you see ""My Best Fiend"" and ""Grizzly Man"" first, although both of those films are serious documentaries--and funny in their own way!)",1186617600,,1419,4.830578512396694

I was watching on the Independent Cinema Channel and it seemed to be a legitimate documentary until they were out on the water, which is to say I would not chart very high.

It's Blair Witch made by intelligent honest talents, basically. And as with that film there may be some who would believe it until the circus music credits. And others who are insulted that Herzog and his director are saying, yes you are exactly that stupid.

Hopefully they will make a mockumentary on the last two national elections too.

Herzog would not make much of King Lear but playing himself he is largely brilliant.",1185667200,,745,4.586466165413534
2196337,1,B0006UEVNQ,"Never have I seen a film so painfully unenjoyable as *Incident at Loch Ness,* and I say this as a fan of Werner Herzog's oeuvre.  *Aguirre, the Wrath of God* and *The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser are magisterial works, and Herzog's performance in Harmony Korine's Julien Donkey-boy is mesmerizing.

But this film, I'm afraid to say, is an unendurable bore.  Overwhelmed by its rather maladroit attempt at postmodern cheekiness, obvious in its staging, derivative in its conceit, this film I turned off right at the point, some thirty minutes into the film, when a bizarre -- and, for someone of Herzog's stature, embarrassing -- stab at some sort of sophomoric humor involving a Bikini Team bimbo occured.

I have not the slightest idea how or why Herzog came to involve himself in this debacle, but, I have to say, it was quite sad to see his trading on his fame this way.

Therefore, if you know little about Herzog and his films, but are interested in knowing more, see *Grizzly Man,* see *The Burden of Dreams,* see *My Best Fiend,* and, for heaven's sake, stay far, far away from *Incident at Loch Ness,* lest you form a low opinion of an otherwise brilliant filmmaker.",1164412800,3,1169,4.71078431372549
2196338,3,B0006UEVNQ,"This may be the first mockumentary made... about a mockumentary.

The independent, creative mind clashes with big-budget in ""Incident as Loch Ness,"" a bizarre mockumentary-within-a-mockumentary (sort of a fictional ""Lost in Le Mancha""). It has some problems -- a slow pace and spotty humour -- but it's still an interesting little movie.

The movie opens in 2003, with an interviewer visiting Werner Herzog (played by... himself) for a documentary. Herzog explains that his forthcoming movie is a documentary about Loch Ness, and how people want to believe in a monster. For this, he's collaborating with Zakk Penn (himself again), writer of movies like ""Elektra,"" ""X2,"" and ""X-Men: The Last Stand."" Very, very mainstream.

But problems crop up as soon as they get to Scotland. Herzog finds that Penn has hired a Playmate/sonar operator, an exozoologist and a big inflatable plesiosaur. He's trying to turn the intelligent documentary into Hollywood garbage. But as Herzog decides to put a stop to it, something huge in the water attacks the boat...

This is a notable movie for two reasons: It's Zakk Penn's first indie movie, and it's the most bizarre movie that Herzog has ever done. And as we're reminded, he once had a riverboat hauled over a mountain, so that is saying something. At the end, it's hard to even remember that this was all ""wheels within wheels.""

Stylistically, ""Incident"" does exactly what it is supposed to do: twist reality, and turn the documentary on its ear. It's slow-paced and rather meditative, like behind-the-scenes documentaries are, and at times it's pretty dull. No outright funny stuff, but it has a sort of wry humour in scenes like the exozoologist showing off his tentacle, or the Playboy girl installing the sonar.

Then after the slow buildup, we get some surprises -- something massive swimming in Loch Ness, which bashes into the boat and cameras. At that point, everything speeds up. The main problem is the ending -- it feels like Penn didn't know how to end the movie, so he just... ended it. Like Herzog says, ""It felt empty.""

It's pretty easy for people to play themselves by definition, but Herzog and Penn actually do a good job. Of course, they're not playing themselves -- Penn is willing to make himself look like a Hollywood sneak, and that's pretty admirable. And Herzog plays himself as a crabby, brilliant filmmaker who values truth (cinematic and personal) more than anyone else on the tub.

Reality gets twisted into a Mobius strip in this mockumentary-within-a-mockumentary, where Hollywood and independent film collide with a bang. Definitely a weird one.",1151971200,5,2618,5.043981481481482

2196340,4,B0006UEVNQ,"It's not that easy writing a spoiler-free review of Incident at Loch Ness, an entertaining piece of mythmaking flim-flammery and an enjoyable addenda to Werner Herzog's own documentary filmmaking, following the director on his ill-fated Loch Ness film as he finds himself increasingly at odds with producer Zak Penn's interference. Considering Penn's commitment to authenticity involves as much window dressing and outright fakery as he can manage, that's not surprising, but when the fun is over it does manage to raise some points about the validity of documentaries as actual documents of reality in a time when the form's popularity has led to increasing sensationalism and `recreations' to stand out from the pack. But this is first and foremost the Werner Herzog Show, and he doesn't disappoint, whether it's his reaction to an unexpected addition to the crew (""She doesn't luke layk a sonar operator"") or arguing with his gun-toting producer who has obviously heard one Klaus Kinski story too many (""Zat's a myvvf! Ay neffer directed anybody at gunpoint!""). Some of the crew are too obviously playing up for the documentary cameras while the last third of the film overplays its hand, but it's hard to dislike a film with exchanges like ""Well, at least we're not dragging the boat over a hill."" ""Vat vos zat?"" ""Uh, nothing."" Although looking at the finished product, I couldn't help wonder how poor Kevin Cowle, one of the few genuinely helpful and competent people at Scottish Screen, felt about his screen credit here: first being famously taken for a ride by the producers of Beneath Loch Ness and now this...

Fox's DVD looks fairly skimpy extras wise but comes with an abundance of appropriately hidden features that greatly add to the fun, from deleted scenes - including Herzog talking about why he will only talk French at gunpoint or his stunned dizzy reaction to a nude sunbather, as well as more wisely omitted egomania from Penn as he describes the rigors of producing Osmosis Jones as his Fitzcarraldo - three commentaries, and a making of documentary about the making of documentary about the documentary Herzog never made...",1142726400,4,2146,5.045070422535211

This film could of picked any distingushed director to play the part of a "" director "" and the film still would of made that person seem silly for participating. In fact the whole film seems like it was made just for their own amusement. It has many inside jokes that don't always translate to us. But the main point is ' Why make another fake documentary that is supposed to

trick the viewer? ' I am guessing that was part of the plot due to sections attempting to be dramatic. Or maybe we are just supposed to think from the begining that the Loch Ness myth is not real and it would be ridiculous for anyone to even think so.

This means that we should be laughing from the very begining.

But many people do believe that myths are possibly true. Look at how many real documentaries are done about Loch Ness. Even National Geographic has taken the time to do a few.

If this film from the start took the comedic stand, say like Spinal Tap. Then you could be laughing from start to finish. But the film attempts with these obviously fake scenes of drama and even death to be taken as a possibility that what you are watching is supposed to be true.

In the end Herzog is too good of a director to be playing with this type of film. I would be just as dissapointed if Spielberg or even Cameron participated in a Blair Witch Project rip off. There are much better ways to make fun of the industry.

A number of the crew members are humorous and provide some good material, such as Michael Karnow as the Crypto-Zoologist who is convinced that nesse is the real deal from the get go, and Werner Herzog is in excellent form as he imitates his own obsessed megalomaniac self. The film definitely caught me off guard the first time I saw it, the fakery didn't become apparent until the plot became especially perpostrous as Penn pulls a gun on Werner, forcing him to film an idiotic model of nesse.

The film is extremely amusing and much credit must first be given to Zak Penn for concocting the whole thing, and a very close second to Werner Herzog who proved that he can poke a lot of fun at himself.

In its own strange way, this film gets beneath all the stories surrounding the Loch Ness monster, but doesn't go far enough.  The film makers are a bit too focused on themselves rather than the years of mythmaking that have gone into making Loch Ness the number one tourist destination in Scotland.

The film rather oddly follows the same form as Life Aquatic, leading me to wonder which came first.  It doesn't seem like Zak Penn invested much energy in this movie, pretty much shooting it on a shoe string.  It looks like it was the result of the dinner conversation that took place with Jeff Goldblum oddly enough present at the gathering.  Amazing how this guy keeps popping up in movies.

Hollywood screenwriter Zak Penn (""X Men 2,"" ""Robin Hood"") wants to make a documentary about the shooting of Herzog's film.  And will go to any length to create situations that will add drama and excitement to his film about a film.  He wants to win an award and be recognized.

Depending on your point of view and level of sophistication, ""Incident at Loch Ness"" is either a shocking, cautionary documentary about the perils of ""artistic differences"" during a difficult location shoot or a laugh out loud faux film about the hijacking of Herzog's movie by an overweight, egotistical, callous Hollywood hack who is directly responsible for the death of two of the documentary's crew members.

I liked the earnest, dead-pan consistency of all players in this quirky, off-center enterprise, especially Herzog's.  And the conceit is never alluded to even in the twisted commentary track.  When an angry Herzog confronts Penn's deception and ineptitude and walks out of the commentary recording session, Penn continues in fits and starts with other disgruntled members of the crew, finally ending with his acid-tongued, soon-to-be ex wife's comments.

The humor in this film is a recipe of dry and absurd irony, with preposterous situational comedy, as the most mundane mind imaginable (Zak Penn) attempts to work in concert harmony with a legendary genius-perfectionist (Werner Herzog).

How does a ""quintessential hack"" work with a ""profound genius"" to produce anything worthwhile?  He doesn't!  ""Worthwhile"" being the operative word here.

What's worse, is the idiot (Zak Penn) has no moral compass to guide his lack of skill and professional integrity, while the genius (Werner Herzog) is grounded in an unimpeachable personal and professional integrity, and a selfless dedication to producing excellence  (Zak Penn wouldn't even understand what I just said).

And it's not entirely lost on me that the existence of a Zak Penn character of this caliber, working behind the scenes, does indeed explain much of the ""crap"" I've sat through in a lifetime of film watching.  Hmmm...

I found the commentaries under extras/features to be even funnier than the film, as Herzog's disdain for Penn cannot even be contained enough to finish the (attorney-negotiated) commentary project.  Further, Penn's desperate ploys to get almost anybody--including his soon-to-be ex-wife--to contribute the constructive and relevant commentary needed to finish the DVD version of the work, had me laughing openly.  Nobody can stand this guy!

A film like this will do better without any preamble of hype.  It is low-key, dry and funny stuff.  It's not a Friday night party movie like ""Used Cars"" or ""Young Frankenstein"".

This is one of those films that having seen it once, I can pop it in while going over the month's expenses, cleaning house, or preparing dinner, and simply laugh over what I'm hearing.  And laugh I do...

The film's mockumentary style does set it apart a bit from other dry and offbeat comedies, like ""Pushing Tin"", say, or ""Rat""; both of which I'd give five stars.  But ""I Like It"" describes my opinion of this film better than, ""I Love It"", hence the four stars.
