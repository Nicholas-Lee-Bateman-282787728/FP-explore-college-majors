8355120,4,B0027V8638,"I'm a big Dan Crary Fan, and I suspect like many novice pickers, I'm too impatient to study tabs, read music, and learn the fundamentals.  With this in mind, the Thundershots Series is an effective tool that concentrates more on actually playing than theory.  For me, the DVD is helping me breakout of just playing chords and getting me to work on picking.  If you are a novice who has trouble on the fretboard, the DVD is not a panacea, this having been said however, Crary breaks down the melodies in small digestible parts, and I'm finding that if I play the components over and over, many times a day, I can reach a level of some competency.  Highly recommended.",1368576000,,666,4.525

A great video lesson, from a master player.",1362096000,,179,4.235294117647059
