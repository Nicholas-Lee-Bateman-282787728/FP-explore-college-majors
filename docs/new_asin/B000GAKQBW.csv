8129892,1,B000GAKQBW,"Seriously... theres a race where a stock full size Chevy pick-up goes against one of the 'race' cars in this DVD.  It's that weak.  I bought this as an add on to get the free shipping. I tend to watch car movies in my shop while I'm working on my cars, though I've never made it through more then a few minutes of this DVD in the year or so I've owned it.  It is pretty funny watching the wanna be racers in their compact econobox rides think they're breaking 16s though.",1203552000,,471,4.0978260869565215
