One of the best action series ever written for television, IMO.",1134432000,33,335,4.234375

2444053,2,B000BWFWGY,I spoiled myself by starting off watching season 6. I have just watched the first 4 episodes of season 1 and there is a huge difference. The bad guys are just as clever but there is very little in the way of the blockbuster action in season 6. Also Jack's wife is a whiner from hell and his daughter is nothing special. The old cliche of kidnapped wife and daughter does not help.,1200700800,,380,4.219178082191781

2444057,5,B000BWFWGY,"This show is ah-mazing! I love how it makes you think and has you on the edge  of your seat. I hated waiting for the next disc to come from Netflix, so I bought it.

2444060,5,B000BWFWGY,"24 is a direct descendent of the Saturday morning serials of the 1930s and 1940s.  At the end of each episode, the villain will spring a trap or something will happen that leaves viewers on the edge of their seat.  The nice thing about having the DVD set is you do not have to wait the week or suffer through commercial breaks.  This is not Shakespeare nor will you want to do much thinking about the story.  When my wife or I comment, the other always says, ""You are thinking, stop and enjoy the show"".  24 is pure escapist fun, sit back relax enjoy yourself.

The product description outlines the plot for each season; you do not need more than that to understand the bare bones of the series.  Being careful to provide no spoilers, you need to watch this in sequence.  Other story lines and character development are best enjoyed by staying in sequence.  The owners care deeply about the franchise, they put effort into character development, secondary stories and recurring minor characters.  This effort adds value and provides the viewer with more than just a shoot `em up.  The acting is good; you will develop an affection for the characters that is a requirement of a successful series and this is one!",1188086400,5,1211,4.61214953271028

2444065,5,B000BWFWGY,"I am enjoying these DVD's...trying to watch on TV weekly with commercials makes it a long, drawn-out process.

2444066,5,B000BWFWGY,24 is one of the best series i ever see. Jack Bauer is the best!,1178928000,2,64,3.3333333333333335
2444067,2,B000BWFWGY,"I don't like this show. It's very unrealistic and full of plot holes. The acting is sub par in spots and I really don't care what happens to the characters. The ""Kim"" storylines are dumb and distracting. The concept of ""real-time"" TV isn't that innovative if you ask me. There are a lot of cliff hangers and ""suspense"", but like I said, I don't care due to the aforementioned problems in the writing/logic and acting. On the up side, this DVD set is good quality. If you're a fan of the show, you'll be pleased to know that these sets look good, sound good, and have great extra features. That is, if you care. I bought seasons 1-5 at Costco last Christmas because they were on sale. I mean, who would want to miss out on the most intense, action packed show of all time? My girlfriend and I watched through season 4, but became totally burnt out with it. I never want to see another episode again, so I sold them on ebay and bought The Shield (a much better show...and that's a fact). 24 became stale because of the rigid subject matter, and repetitive situations. The show is about counter-terrorism, so there's no comedy (not that there should be) and no change in tone. 24 attempts to keep the same breakneck pace the entire season, which isn't dramatic (only superficial). It doesn't interest me and I don't buy it. At first we liked it but it quickly became apparent that 24 is fast on pacing, and sloooow on brains/logic. A lot of people disagree with me....hell, you're probably one of them. That's OK, because I've got better shows to watch like The X-Files, Millennium, The Sopranos, The Wire, Carnivale, Deadwood, Rome, The Shield, Stargate SG-1, Farscape, Lost, House M.D., Brotherhood, etc., etc. Check those shows out if you want the best that TV on DVD has to offer. If the plot holes and ridiculous stories don't bother you, then I say go for it and buy this set.

If you want specific examples of the plot holes, you either haven't been watching or are as naive as the writers. There are too many to list (5 seasons worth). If you've been watching for any length of time at all you'll remember Air Force One being taken out in mid air, extravagant plans to assassinate a ""potential"" US presidential candidate (all they had to do was snipe him out), being able to travel to anywhere in LA in a matter of 5 minutes or less, etc. I mean, the concept of the same man having to save the entire planet 5+ times in a row is absurd, and that's what the show is based on. Come on! But they try to come off so real and authentic. I don't know....maybe I just don't get it; if you do...good for you. Either way it's just not for me. If you want edgy, ""intense"" TV, I recommend The Shield.

P.S. - I realize I'm in the minority here. Go ahead and hit ""not helpful"". I expect most of you will.",1178841600,10,2797,4.38728323699422
2444068,2,B000BWFWGY,"Watch seasons 2-5 and you have an incredible portrayal of the man and the community that surrounds him. And you have great plot (with the dumb ""override"" section of season 4 a sorry exception). Maybe there was nowhere to go after season 5 but down. Season 6 so far takes the hoakiness to a new level. The new CTU characters are more unlikable than ever, even O'Brian's makeover seems to have really distorted her character. And Morris? Why should I care if he drinks or not? The potential of Karen Hayes to become a full-fledged character - as Michelle or the other female CTU head did - has so far been shelved and she now plays a one-dimensional 2nd fiddle to Peter McNichol's patented grimaces and ticks. Nadia and her boyfriend are absolutely sickening to watch. The scene of them making out in CTU was the most insulting and shallow moment I've ever seen on the show!

Mr. Sutherland has expressed concerns abou the freshness of the show. We've seen so many of these plot elements before! Nuclear threat, presidential threat, CTU tortures its own, Jack tortures an always-guilty suspect. Oh God, PLEASE don't let Kim appear again in another ""Perils of Pauline"" subplot!

There is no change in the tone. It's all at ""11"" all the time. That's fine for Casino Royale, but not for a series.

The few plusses I can think of: Bill Buchanan, Aaron Pierce, the Logans. Really almost every other character except Jack now either leaves me flat, annoyed, or angry.

The New Yorker published an in-depth article on Joel Surnow and 24 awhile ago. The political ideology and neo-con programming are really surfacing, as if the run-up to the November election was really on their minds during writing. Palmer's sister is pathethic--the most charactured bleeding-heart I've ever seen played straight.

Mr. Sutherland's concerns about the show, as expressed on Charlie Rose, are really not evident. I hope that those involved in the show are examining their consciences. Members of the military have reported to the production company that the show is glorifying torture and has itself contributed to problematic attitudes and practices in the armed forces. We can try to distance ourselves by assertig it's fantasy, but through the media, it is now shaping reality to its image. When will that start to gnaw at you, the audience member? When we know that we let ourselves get scared and tricked by that BS into starting a war that now is wasting a hundred civilians a day, can we celebreate a show that now pounds that rhetoric in as relentlessly as Rumsfield and Chency?

The show has reached the tipping point asthetically and culturally. Unless it can reinvent itself and put characters ahead of jingoism, it's time to end that beautiful dream and grow up.",1176249600,5,2749,4.8382978723404255
2444069,5,B000BWFWGY,"I don't have TV so I have been missing out on watching 24! I came across Amazon's Video Unbox Downloads and I thought I had found my answer. Sadly, Mac users are not supported at this time. Since I don't want to mess around with torrents, I thought I would just have to wait for this season to be over and the boxset to be released. After some hunting on the internet I found that the Fox Network videostreams the current season using myspace dot com! YAY! So there is no need to buy the current season's episodes! I'd rather save my money and buy the boxsets & now I also don't have to wait to see the episodes until that faraway boxset release date!

Fox's myspace page lets you watch the current season's episodes of many different Fox shows for FREE!

The new episodes for 24 are posted weekly (tuesday at 12am). This is especially nice for mac users since video unbox is still not compatible for mac users and the best part: it's FREE!!! Not only that, there are usually only 2 commercial breaks lasting less than 30 seconds each instead of the 3min30sec commerical breaks you have to endure over and over while watching the program on network television! It's free & it's legal; no hunting for torrents or waiting forever for the download to finish!

The quality of the video streaming on myspace (for FOX shows) is very good & I have not experienced any lagtime during playback. The screen size is decent (you can choose from two settings but have to select the smaller one to pause the videostream) & I've haven't experienced any audio synchronization problems either.

The systems requirement to watch the episodes on myspace are (for mac):
you must be running at least OSX & the following browsers are supported on at this time: Safari 1.3.2 (build 312.5) or later & Firefox/Mozilla 1.5 or later

watch them at: myspace dot com /24

Listing of Fox shows on myspace:
24, Prison Break, The War at Home, American Dad, Standoff, The Wedding Bells, Are you Smarter...?, Talk Show, The Winner, Bones, 'Til Death, The Loop, Vanished

For people who want to OWN the episodes: I recommend buying the boxsets new or used instead of downloading the videos and making backups.

I'm not writing a review regarding *actually using* Amazon's Unbox Video Downloads because it doesn't work for me (Mac User). My alternative suggestion of watching the episodes on myspace dot com are crossplatform user-friendly. As for the show: doesn't everyone already know it's terrific?! The most exciting hour on television (or myspace for that matter;>)! You also do NOT need to sign up for a myspace account to watch the videostreams.

ENJOY!

5 stars for the show & no stars at this time for un-mac-friendly-Amazon!

2444070,5,B000BWFWGY,"Jack Bauer is probably one of the greatest ""American heroes"" in the history of television. His take no sheist attitude and his determination to do whatever it takes to get results is by far the most hardcore and badA of any of my favorite characters on television or in movies. You can also watch as the seasons progress as Jack puts up with less crap and gives up beating around the bush, and just does whatever it takes to get what he's looking for. I had always heard about 24 and wanted to get into it, but jumping into it midseason was always hard to do. I borrowed season one from a friend and was instantly hooked, so much that i decided to go ahead and get all of them. Ha, i guess this show is a lot like crack, cause once you start it, believe me, you're hooked.. If you've got the time, you'll probably blow through several episodes and discs (maybe even seasons) at a time..

I've checked on it, and wanted to get all five seasons on dvd to catch up on the show to watch it on tv, but they're very expensive to buy individually, even used. There's no other way to get all of these without spending fifty dollars apiece new, or spending thirty-five or so used. This boxed set with the first five seasons, is without a doubt the best deal you can come by, and I highly recommend it. Buy it, enjoy it, and be amazed at and envy Jack Bauer and his hardcore awesomeness.",1175299200,4,1377,4.255725190839694
2444071,5,B000BWFWGY,"Please don't not watch this show, I think it is an illegal drug.  If you buy the massive box set, you will not want to do anything else.  There is an addictive substance in the box that will not let you stop watching.  On a serious note, this is by far the best show i've ever seen!!!!",1174003200,4,285,3.9649122807017543
2444072,5,B000BWFWGY,"My wife and I somehow never became involved in ""24"" until well into the 6th season when a neighbor loaned us the first season on DVD.  We casually began watching and soon became completely immersed in the story.  After watching the first season in 6 nights (4 episodes per night) we purchased the entire first through fifth season as a packege and are currently watching that.  It is absolutely gripping!

""24"" the series is too good to be found on network television.  This is HBO quality writing, production and acting but surprisingly Fox did it on commercial TV.  This is head-and-shoulders above anything we have ever seen on network television.  If the three major networks had produced more programming of this quality they probably would not have experienced continually declining viewership over the years.  ""24"" is so well written that no one will ever predict the outcome let alone what will happen in the next few minutes.  I can't imaging watching this on tv one week at a time with 4:30 minute commercial breaks throughout.  We will buy and watch successive seasons on DVD only.

2444073,5,B000BWFWGY,"24 is a wonderful series which has your heart beating at an accelerated rate throughtout each ""day.""  The format is great, with each episode representing an hour in the life of Jack and his crew, continued for a 24 hour period.  Since each episode tends to end at a transition point or some sort, you can't wait to see the next episode to find out what's going to happen next.  That's the beauty of watching 24 on DVD--you don't have to wait an entire week to find out.  Although my wife and I are watching the current season (day 6) as it's presented, catching up on the previous seasons is far more enjoyable.",1173916800,2,611,4.380530973451328

I'm slowing down now because I don't want to go through them before the end of the fifth season is over, and my husband is feeling neglected. Don't plan on watching the show and attemp to do something else. This series absolutely demands your full attention to detail. The plot is always changing and you can't guess what's going to happen next. It's the best series I've ever watched.

24 is a compelling, dramatic, intriguing series of interweaving plots and espionage. No obscenities were used which made 24 a great series.

I enjoy 24 because of all the above reasons.

2444101,5,B000BWFWGY,"This is a great series, even though when I first heard of the concept of breaking each individual show into hour intervals I laughed and thought it would never work. I was wrong. Keifer Sutherland's Jack Bauer is a bold and seemingly indestructible agent for a fictitious U.S.intelligence body - part Errol Flynn part James Bond. Throughout the series, Bauer has stopped an assassination attempt, thwarted a nuclear attack, been widowed, killed a witness, died, and become an addict while undercover.  Plus, it just gets better and better, with twists and turns in every episode. Of course, I would expect this with David Fury coming on board as part of the creative team to help ruin Jack's fifth and sixth days, so far.

This 5 season bundle is a great value for those of us who didn't collect any seasons of ""24"" yet. However, be aware that this is a 5 season bundle versus a special collector's edition.

A show that deals with a 24 hour period to stop terrorists who will do anything to harm others such as an assisination, kidnappings, blowing up dirty bombs (Nuclear), virus outbreaks, warheads to Nerve gas. In our post September 11th world, this show is an example that a hero like Jack Bauer to stop all roots of evil from being spread. There are also some plots & twists along the way such as a mole in season 1, the assisination of President Palmer in season 2 to Habib Marwan and the involvement of the Chinese Consulate in season 4, it no wonder why this show has been nominated for 12 to 15 emmys in the 5 seasons this show was on. Gotta love 24. Now for the box sets. If you would like to get this whole boxed set, about $180.00, this is the show for you if you don't have all seasons just yet. On the other hand if you would like to save some bucks, buy the seasons seperately to save some money.

The things I expect with this show is suspence, action, an intence fast paced roller coaster, plot twists, and thrills.  Fortunately I get all five in this hit show.  But what isn't expected in these intence four rounds of 24 hours?  The kind of suspence, action, the type of intence fast paced roller coaster, the types of plot twists and thrills.  Unfortunately for Jack Bauer once the clock starts to tick his 24 hour nightmare begins.  24 is a hard hitting show.  TV ads and sneak peaks into the new episode keep me waiting for the next hour of suspence, action, plot twists and thrills.  A question I would want to ask is would a day like these days go by slow?  As slow as the whole season goes?  Jack Bauer did say in season one ""this is the longest day of my life"" which I'm sure it was when his wife and daughter were kiddnapped while the same people responsible attempt to assasinate a senator running for president, and in between investigating about a traitor inside CTU.  What also lies in store for 24 is the sacrifices made.  All four seasons of this hit show are must haves for new and long time fans.",1154563200,3,1175,4.364055299539171

2444113,5,B000BWFWGY,"WARNING - This show just might ruin everything else for you.

OK so I'm not saying the show is perfect, there are a lot of little things about it that annoy me, heck some stuff doesn't even make sense but........

Overall this show is amazing.  It's kind of like when you watch a James Bond flick and you go, oh yeah right, like that would ever happen but you enjoy the action anyway.  But with 24 it's not just action.  The show grabs a hold of you and won't let go.  it's an adreline rush and an emotional roller coaster honestly I held back tears on more than one ocasion and I'm no bitch.  The only problem is it ruins everything else for you.  I really can't watch anything else anymore because nothing on TV even comes close.  I am a big Soprano's fan and thought that was as good as it gets but once I got into 24 I forgot all about the Soprano's.  It's really not fair to other shows and don't just take my word for it look at the other reviews here on amazon and the average rating.  Also it is consistantly rated as the number one show on tv amongst all the critics and in all the guides, Entertainment weekly, TV Guide, newspapers, magazines, everyone agrees 24 is the best show on TV.  But look you have to be in to that kind of thing, in other words the idea of anti terrorism has to appeal to you.  You have to like shows of this nature for example: The Soprano's, CSI, Allias, The Wire, The shield, House, Lost, ect.  if your more of a sex in the city or friends type of person who enjoys that light harted stuff then this is not for you.  But if you want your pulse to race, if you want to be on the edge of your seat, if you don't mind violence, and if you can take the emotional games the show will play with you then your going to love it.  I am writing this for anyone who has not already seen it.  Pick up season one and start from the begining, what ever you do don't try to get into it on tv five seasons after the fact, you must start from the beginin that would be like trying to watch Star Wars Episode 3 without seing any of the other ones, it just won't work you have to start from the begining but be prepared say goodbye to any social life you have for the next month while you catch up.",1148860800,9,2217,4.048165137614679

C.T.U(Counter Terrorist Unit) and C.T.U operative Jack Bauer(Keifer Sutherland)try and stop terrorist threats all within 24 hours which is in real time. What I like about this show is that Keifer Sutherlands character Jack Bauer is not afraid to do what ever it takes to stop a terrorist threat even if it is going against C.T.U or the President. Another great aspect of the show is they are not afraid to kill off main characters that you grow to love on the show, so you will never now what is going to happen next which keeps you wanting more.

Cheers!",1140739200,3,819,4.671328671328672
2444152,5,B000BWFWGY,"24 is an excellent series.  We travel extensively and rely on DVD's for entertainment in foreign countries.  We looked at other retailers and found that Amazon had the best deal.  I wish other series were this affordable.  Compare these prices to HBO series which are grossly over priced.

Thanks Amazon !!",1140652800,,306,4.921568627450981

2444154,5,B000BWFWGY,We got started watching 24 in 2004 and have been addicted since.  We tried to catch up with the earlier episodes when they started showing repeats but pretty soon we were missing hours and it became confusing SO we started looking for the whole series to purchase so we could watch it at our leisure yet not miss anything.  We haven't missed an episode since 2004 and this collection is well worth the money!,1140652800,,408,4.5
2444155,5,B000BWFWGY,"We thoroughly enjoyed the series.  We occassionally miss parts of the actual series throughout the year.  The series is so fast moving, you can miss a lot just missing one episode. This was great to sit down and see the seasons start to finish.  Seems like a lot of money, but you have to remember you are buying 72 hours of movies plus the special features. That's just a couple of bucks an hour.  Absolutely well worth the money.  We got weeks of entertainment.",1140652800,,463,4.464285714285714

The scripts are tight, the acting is great! I have even gotten my best friend hooked on it. This is one show that I refuse to miss!",1140652800,2,288,4.160714285714286
2444157,5,B000BWFWGY,"Saw one episode on tv and I got hooked instantly. So bad that I bought all 96 episodes at the same time. Maybe the only show that leaves with that feeling of, ""ummm maybe I'll see just one more"" every time! Must see from start to finish to truly appreciate.",1140566400,,257,4.16
2444158,5,B000BWFWGY,"Never watched the series on TV but caught an old episode and was intrigued by the plot.

So far I have watched the 1st 2 seasons.  The plots and cliff hangers are addictive.  This is an excellent series.",1140393600,,203,4.2894736842105265
2444159,5,B000BWFWGY,"Look.  I'm 34 years old.  I've had the misfortune of being tortured by Kiefer Sutherland's horrific acting from the late 80's through the 90's (except for Stand by Me).  I must also tell you to ignore all the over-publicized hype (commercials, constant re-runs on A&E, press, etc.).  Give Kiefer a second change neglecting his past.  Judge this for yourself as I have.

I have to tell you that despite all the above, this is likely the most fabulously exciting, leave-them-guessing, sitting on the edge of your pants, can't live until the next episode, best cast thriller of a TV show you'll ever watch.  Wow.  Almost enough said.  I had the misfortune of not seeing this show from seasons I.  I was home a few days last year and caught a few reruns on A&E.  Believe it or not, I hadn't even heard about the show (and I watch a good amount of TV).  I was hooked instantly.  This series (all 4 seasons) is worse than a bad crack habit if you're the slightest thriller/police/intelligence fan.  I started watching Season I in late November in a vain attempt to catch all 4 seasons before January's Season V debut.  I also tried to keep a family together, keep a job, and possibly get some sleep while doing so.  Sleep lost out bigtime.  There were nights I couldn't pop in the next DVD and watch 5 hours straight.  I'd walk into work like the living dead.  It was all worth it.

Look, yes there are the ocassional story lines which leave you guessing in the end.  Yes, there are some technical boo-boos for the nit-picky crowd.  Yes, there is the infrequent imperfect actor or two.  But no show is perfect.  The stories and format (24 hours) are what get me.  Again, this is perhaps the best TV I've ever watched.  It's more than worth every penny I paid for the set.

You will not be disappointed.",1140220800,5,1796,4.479876160990712

Well, I've been watching it and I'm hooked big time.  I now want to go out and get the other seasons.  This is one GREAT series and I'm disappointed I didn't start watching it on TV.  But another side of it, is I don't get commercials which is much better.

Thank you for whoever made this series.",1139356800,,465,4.2272727272727275
2444161,1,B000BWFWGY,"This is part of a trend in TV that I first noticed with West Wing - impart a false sense of drama, excitement, or urgency through talking fast and moving a lot.

In West Wing this kind of kinetic trick was achieved by having everybody walk very fast all the time as they talked about basically very boring stuff. 24 Hours has taken this approach to the usual boring subject matter of unconvincing bad guys threatening our no longer cherished Western civilization.

Jack Bauer jumps around like a flea and uses his mobile phone a lot while a shakey camera zooms in and out desperately trying to impart some urgency to this yawn-a-thon. Heck, this is just like one of those drab little ""Made in China"" snowglobes with tacky tiny Santas inside that you have to shake to get any kind of enjoyment out of.

A tip for 24 Hours devotees: If you want to make this 'kinetic' show even more exciting, hang your TV from an elasticated cord and bounce it up and down as you watch while jumping up and down on a pogo stick! Ha ha!",1139011200,4,1017,4.37037037037037

2444163,4,B000BWFWGY,"I'm a fan of 24, but never have been one big enough to buy any of the seasons on DVD. For me it's terrific escapist entertainment to watch once and that's it. Now with this huge set, the price of is a good deal for 96 hours of show, but only for major fans.

Season 1 and Season 2 are my favorites. Implasable they are, but exciting and well acted the are also. I just wasn't big on season 3, as it felt way to rushed and a little desperate. Season 4 was better but still not to the standard of the first two. If you watch the show you know what you're in for. If you never have go back and watch some repeats on TV, or the current season. My view is it's fine show, just not quite as good as say The Sopranos or CSI.",1138060800,,717,3.8445945945945947
2444164,5,B000BWFWGY,"I love the stuff this show is based on.  A big fan of the Tom Clancy type superheroes, Navy Seals, Special Ops, etc, as well as the classic cop shows like Homicide, NYPD Blue, Law & Order, Hill Street Blues and more recently CSI, THIS is an incredible show.  Been looking for all four seasons in one for a while.  Didn't realize there were so many fakes out there.  Can't wait for my order to arrive.  FOX has two great winners with this and The Shield on F/X.  The best two shows on tv right now and that's saying a lot considering the powerpunch that HBO packs.  The 4 hour season 5 premiere was INSANE as was last night's episode.",1138060800,3,633,4.225

2444166,5,B000BWFWGY,"This is one of only two shows that keeps my attention from beginning to end (this, and BTVS). I have to watch them on DVD because I hate waiting through commercials and/or waiting until next week, sitting at the edge of my seat....

I'm not sure what it is, I just love the formula. You can't trust anybody, you can't fully predict what's to come, and with the dark cloud of mass destruction always present, the intensity level just increases with every ticking second on the clock. I can't help but love it. And Jack Bauer will do ANYTHING he needs to get the job done, and save lives. President Palmer is a leader that will also go the limits to protect his people. No matter what happens, they never forget the bottom line... It's just an incredible show.

I agree though, with the other person about the spoiler photos before the episode begins. That's just WRONG.",1137369600,,868,4.522292993630574

  A very good action movie that can be viewed with the family. No profanity to distract from the plot. I am 77 year's old and hard of hearing so I have to really pay attention to keep up with what is happening. The voice sound is sometimes too
hard for me to hear as the background music is so high when I turn up the audio.
  It is too much of CTU taking Jack into custody so often as he is the one that
does so much for the country. He either prevents or deters a terrorest action only to be locked down when it is over.
