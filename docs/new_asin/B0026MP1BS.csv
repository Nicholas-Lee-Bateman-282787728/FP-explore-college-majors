Sometimes it is truly just about those moments you spend on the road and how the interactions mingle during those times. Once I let that set in for this film, I enjoyed it a bit more than just giving it a couple stars.

Three young 20-somethings travel cross country from their mutual friend's funeral to spread his ashes at a place in Mexico. We get some of the usual fare with a spirited woman, a reclusive video camera enthusiast and a rebellious son of a senator trying to be everything but responsible. On the trip they come across a mechanic (Wes Studi) who helps them in more ways than one. Admittedly, a short performance for him and it was not memorable, but I always like to see his variety.

The background/childhood friendships gets thrown into the mix through intermittent flashbacks, but the topic wasn't really hit enough to get a solid understanding of how everyone fits together. So that leaves how our trio learn from each other before reaching their destination. I did not care for how they wrote 2/3 of the outcomes, but that does not make it unrealistic.

The supplements include some average deleted scenes/outtakes, and the director's first film, a short called Gravity. Was not fond of the short's ending either, but I think we are seeing a theme of how this director likes his films to conclude. Do not expect story closure or a deep background on anyone here, you just get to watch a decent film on learning about life while traveling.",1248566400,5,1549,4.6875

But it was a train wreck. This felt like a high school History of Film 201 class project: no plot, terrible acting, absent story arc. There really was no point or purpose to this film.",1504137600,,219,4.214285714285714

8353185,1,B0026MP1BS,"Sadly, a phony account of the Camino.  The music was Puerto Rican, the food shown was Mexican.  On the real Camino, you are in a part of Spain where you will more often hear bagpipes than flamenco, and certainly not eat tacos from a food truck.  Learn about the real pilgrimage and a beautiful story about carrying ashes by the original movie, The Way by Emilio Estavez and Martin Sheen.",1499212800,5,387,4.5
