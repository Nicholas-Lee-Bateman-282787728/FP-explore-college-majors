3423656,5,B001962ELM,Great for anyone wanting to learn how to wakeboard or to learn how to throw big tricks. Got the DVD last spring and by the end of summer I had my whole family up and crossing the wake. I went from never wakebording before to wake to wake by the end of summer. This DVD helped me alot.,1366070400,,284,3.913793103448276

3423658,5,B001962ELM,Bought this for my boyfriend's birthday after one season of riding.  We are both beginner riders and really enjoyed it.  This movie is deff VERY informative.  :),1290988800,,161,4.888888888888889
3423659,5,B001962ELM,Instructional videos do not get any better than this.  I started with the beginner DVD even though I have been riding for many years and I learned things that imporved my basic riding skills that I never would have thought of.  There is not a thing that he doesnt cover in this video.  It is worth double the price!,1283126400,2,315,4.305084745762712

3423661,5,B001962ELM,The best training video on the market. Murray breaks everything down to where it is so easy. Simply the best one going.,1259280000,,119,4.454545454545454
3423662,5,B001962ELM,"This is a great instructional DVD.  The format for the instruction, however, is more focused on those who already have experience around a wakeboard.  Being a 8 year veteran of the sport I already had the first disc down pat, and the second disc I knew the majority of.  Where this DVD excels is the advancement of the Technique of tricks.  Its not the best I've seen in terms of teaching tricks but it suffices.  I would suggest this for any rider who wants to advance their riding.  Even if they know the majority of the tricks on the DVD.",1257033600,,541,4.36
3423663,5,B001962ELM,"I've boarded here and there for a couple years. Decided this year that I really wanted to get better on the board. This DVD shows all of the tools, techniques and body position that you need to know to improve your skills.",1246838400,,222,4.309523809523809
3423664,5,B001962ELM,"I bought this for my boyfriend's birthday, but I really wanted it for myself.  We just started wakeboarding this summer and this DVD came highly recommended from a friend.  Shaun Murray is an incredibly talented wakeboarder, but he's also funny, entertaining, and a great teacher.  The video is full of good information whether you are just starting out or if you are looking to add tricks to your arsenal.  It's is also beneficial if you are helping beginners; he is able to verbalize the key points that are sometimes difficult to explain... even if you have wakeboarding experience.",1224806400,2,585,4.938775510204081
3423665,5,B001962ELM,"This DVD was recommended to me when I bought my wakeboard, and yes this is excactly what you need to get started. It covers also advanced/super advanced, although It will surely take time to get there.
But really it helped my buddy and I to make great progress in just a few weeks.
a great investment.",1217376000,,301,4.392857142857143
8272083,5,B001962ELM,"Awesome instructional.  Still working my way up to the advanced stuff, but the beginning and intermediate stuff is really awesome.  Taught in a fun way that is entertaining and instructional.",1446336000,,191,5.333333333333333
8272084,5,B001962ELM,Very helpful. It brakes down each trick. This was the best money I have spent on wakeboarding stuff. I would highly recommend it.,1416700800,,129,4.6521739130434785
8272085,4,B001962ELM,"Let me start off by saying i love everything Shaun Murray puts out. I have rode multiple boards of his for 15 years and love what he has done for the industry, but i wasn't fully impressed with the DVD. the information is sound and the layout works but what killed me was the quality of the video and the lack of updated video. this is basically a mid 2000's recording with some added newer video and repackaged.  It wasn't like they went out and started from scratched. they reused ai say about 85-90 percent of older videos they took and mixed it with a couple extra tricks.  if it was 100 percent updated this would be receiving 100 percent.  with that said. get this video. i have been wakeboarding for 15 years and really haven't pushed my self nor had anyone push my self to further my skill so when i finally was able to buy a boat myself and have what i wanted i regained that enthusiasm i had when i first started and wanted to further my skill.  this does it. it shows you in slow mo and at speed how to do the tricks and even while being on a dock on how to twist or pull so you can see the movements closely.  Beginner, Intermediate or Expert you will learn from this DVD.",1415145600,,1184,4.175438596491228
8272086,5,B001962ELM,A must for anyone that owns a wakeboard. Takes you from how to don the board through the most advanced tricks out there. Very well done.,1409443200,,136,4.269230769230769
8272087,5,B001962ELM,This video offers something for everyone. I wish I'd had this back in June when I started wakeboarding at the tender age of 46. I could have saved myself a ton of pain and frustration! Starts at the first step and shows you how to progress to stuff I will never attempt. A must have for the beginner. Shaun keeps it light and slows things down so you can see what he's doing and even shows you what NOT to do.,1383696000,,409,4.061728395061729
8272088,5,B001962ELM,The bomb-dot-com.  Don't try and learn to wakeboard from your dumb friends who will get you hurt; buy this instead.,1381190400,,115,4.75
8272089,5,B001962ELM,"Great presentation.  The information is useful and actionable. It's easy to understand.

If I get past disc 1 I'll call it success.",1376524800,,131,4.909090909090909
8272090,5,B001962ELM,"I bought this wakeboard video for my boys who have been wakeboarding for a little while and know basics, but were looking for more tricks and help in jumping wake to wake. They LOVE this video because it has all the information you need and it's really funny and entertaining too! Already this weekend my son is jumping wake to wake, and I look forward to what else they will do, thanks to the help of this DVD. Highly recommend for wakeboarding instruction.",1372550400,,458,4.530120481927711
8272091,5,B001962ELM,This DVD set covers all aspects of wakeboarding from beginning to expert tricks. It has helped me at 58 years old to understand and execute the basics of clearing wake to wake jumps. I like the Learnwake.com videos but this is much easier to use and very well presented by Shaun and crew in a fun and ver useful manner.,1369094400,,319,4.333333333333333
8272092,5,B001962ELM,"This 3 disc set of training videos is well organized and very instructional.
Right from the basics to very advanced tricks, everything is explained in
great technical detail and filmed from mulptiple camera angles so
understanding new concepts is fun and easy to follow. Cant wait to get out
and try what ive learned, id highly recommend this dvd series to anyone
looking to get better at riding from beginner to expert.",1366329600,,420,4.847222222222222
