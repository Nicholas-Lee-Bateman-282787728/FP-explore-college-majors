2957077,4,B000VWYJ6S,"Like ""Little Man Tate,"" the 2006 Swiss film ""Vitus"" depicts the world seen from a young boy Vitus, whose exceptional talent (especially as pianist), he realizes, may not be exactly what would make him and his family very happy. That doesn't mean he doesn't want to play the piano - actually he loves it - which makes the whole situation more complicated.

""Vitus,"" helmed by Swiss veteran director Fredi M. Murer and starring actual 14-year-old pianist Teo Gheorghiu, effectively describes the life of precocious Vitus whose slightly deadpan face actually hides various emotions. The actors are unanimously good, Bruno Ganz in particular as Vitus' grandfather, who represents the wisdom only aged people can provide.

Though the film starts brilliantly with and focuses mainly on Vitus' life as young gifted pianist, it also introduces a variety of his talents including stock market in the second half, which, I think is neither necessary nor credible. ""Vitus"" could have been better without some of its subplots, for example, one about his father's job in company, which only prolongs the second half, or romance with his babysitter.

""Vitus"" covers the similar territory with ""Searching for Bobby Fischer"" (another great film) where a chess prodigy has to make a tough decision to stay what he really is. The same happens to Vitus, but not in the same way because Vitus' parents, flawed as they are, are more understanding. In fact, all characters are flawed, even Vitus himself, but they become realistic all the more for that, with the balanced descriptions of the adults.

""Vitus"" was the official Academy Award entry from Switzerland for best foreign film of the year 2006 though it was not nominated. Maybe with less subplots and themes it might have been.",1197072000,5,1764,5.072413793103448
2957078,5,B000VWYJ6S,"This is an incredible movie in the fact it takes on genius and the expectations of genius, only to make a full U-turn and follow the heart. It is a good example of not placing our expectations upon others...they will rise to their own level on their own, often surpassing our dreams. Only true genius can become self actualized and happy as a result of pursuit. This movie is not about piano playing, but finding your happiness in spite of the world around us.",1196985600,17,460,4.488095238095238

So if you did not get your fill of reading a movie While watching ""the passion of the christ"" please feel free to buy this product.  If you are like me and think that reading a movie takes the fun out of it then make this one a skip.  Movie makers could at least give us the option of an english soundtrack.  They can fit two versions of a movie on a disc but cannot include a dubbed version?  too bad for those of us who like to read books not movies.

2957080,5,B000VWYJ6S,"VITUS is a film from Switzerland that has garnered many accolades and nearly won an Oscar.  And yes, it is that good!  Written by Fredi M. Murer, Peter Luisi, and Lukas B. Suter and directed by Murer, VITUS explores the life of a child genius, a lad who from the age of five is obviously gifted in that he can play Bach et al after only a few months lessons and is able to read books and understand concepts that make his stance in a regular kindergarten class untenable.  But the film is less about the gifts of a child prodigy than it is a story of how a genius child longs for a normal childhood.  It is in the telling of the story that the audience is privileged to discover the joys and trials in a child's view of being extraordinary.

Vitus - played at age 6 by Fabrizio Borsani and at age 12 by Teo Gheorghiu - is referred to as a little Mozart by his parents Helen (Julika Jenkins) and Leo (Urs Jucker), and by the family friends who are amazed at Vitus' gift as a pianist.  But as is often the case with gifted children, they are overprotected, not allowed to engage in the normal activities of being a kid.  Vitus finds consolation in his grandfather (a brilliant Bruno Ganz) whose creative energy includes Vitus in his longing to fly and to build complex machines.  While Vitus continues his love for the piano he also takes risks with his beloved grandfather.  Vitus' intelligence serves him well in analyzing the complexities of his father's job and his grandfather's role in that position, and it is his genius that leads the family in a direction no one thought possible.  And of course with every story of an extraordinary young lad adapting to a puzzling world, there is also a love interest: Isabel at age 12 (Kristina Lykowa) is his fun-loving babysitter and at age 19 (Tamara Scarpellini) is the queen of his inexperienced heart and fill a void in Vitus' life that otherwise would be empty.  Fitting all of these subplots together is made magical by Vitus' constant playing of classical music - a feat the young actor is capable of performing on his own!

The cast of this film is not only gifted but is also endearing.  Bruno Ganz is a brilliant actor and he is matched by both of the young actors who play Vitus.  The story is tender but avoids bathos. It simply is an uplifting, inspiring, entertaining film.  A Must See!  Grady Harp, November 07",1196294400,26,2370,4.464037122969837
2957081,5,B000VWYJ6S,"VITUS-(2006-PG) was the Swiss entry in the 2006 Academy Awards for Best Foreign Film. It is a terrific family friendly film about a young prodigy (Vitus) who wants to grow up normal and his parents want him to use his incredible gifts and not waste them.  While his mother does come across sometimes as selfish in her desires, I imagine if we put ourselves in her shoes, we might struggle with the same tensions of how to let him grow up 'normal' and also not waste his gifts. Vitus then takes it upon himself to ensure that he will grow up 'normal'.  Through all this tension, he finds a friend in his grandfather who understands him and passes on his love of flying and woodworking, something his mother does not approve.  She goes ballistic one day when she sees Vitus learning how to use a saw because of what it could do to his fingers if he had an accident. There are also some clever little twists in the story that make this a very interesting and entertaining family movie.  [...].",1191715200,44,990,4.45303867403315

2957086,5,B000VWYJ6S,"This is what I posted on my FB Timeline:
Through the magic of Amazon Prime, my wife and I were able to watch ""Vitus"" -- a film about a child prodigy pianist. ... Well, more than that, actually, and that's why I bring it up.
This film from 2007 garnered a barely fresh 65% on Rotten Tomatoes and a 3-star rating from Ebert. Easy to miss at the time. Lord knows what kind if distribution this sub-titled film may have had.
We finally saw it last weekend, and we rate much higher on our scale. We found the characters well-drawn and charming. The plot worked for us, but required a 'suspension of disbelief' that is often essential in theater.
Anyway, we say, ""Check it out!"" You will hear some very tasteful piano music, and spend time with folks who are much more fun to be with than you will find in the latest 'Action' flic.
Note that the reviews on the Amazon site are more in line with how we rated it:",1461024000,2,905,4.267441860465116

(Not an idle boast, as I am not related.)
The relationships herein depicted are SO true for those who experience, or suffer, under the current deadly political regime, the, er, differences in human intelligence and, well, let's call it righteousness.
My personal opinion is that analogies are hard, but does your model fly, given gravity, the fluid, and solar output re: weather, and all that, play?
Mostly, it's fluid. Most of you, so sadly, will never get that. Thus, it comes down to aesthetics, in a non-survival mode.
Watched ""Dr. Zhivago"", ""Heartbreak Ridge"", ""The Expendables"", ""300"", besides this?
Know math?

2957144,5,B000VWYJ6S,"""Vitus"" is a Swiss boy, a genius and prodigy at the piano, being propelled to a career as concert pianist by his demanding Swiss and English parents far ahead of his own ability to manage such a protocol. This extraordinary film traces this boy's life ascent from adolescent to dozen-year-old quasi-adult in less than two hours. What is most impressive is the film begins as driven parents pushing the child to adulthood that morphs into a satisfying family drama with fantasy ingredients that keep viewers of all ages involved in what is a very adult tale.

As a classical music aficianado, I was drawn to this tale because of its msuical content. It doesn't disappoint in that regard with Vitus playing portions of Robert Schumann's Piano Concerto, Johann Sebastian Bach's Goldberg variations and a slice of Maurice Ravel's Alborada del Gracioso, among other piano pieces I recognized. The score also includes a snippet of Franz Liszt's Piano Concerto No. 1.

But this little movie transcends high art and the pain of growing into an artist to become a warm, humane and touching story about the most important things in life: love, family, wealth and poverty, success and failure, maturity, coming along and getting along, and growing up -- all through the actions of a six and 12-year-old genius living what seems like a lifetime in those six years.

Vitus's ascent is abetted by a sympathetic grandfather that mentors the young boy, teaching him about life through his art and encouraging him to follow his dreams, whatever they may be. You'll be surprised what some of those dreams -- all realized -- turn out to be! One of them, a set of actions where the boy essentially saves his father's business, requires a bit of attention and will probably go over your kids' heads (and maybe yours.)

Neither that nor anything else halts this from being a magnificent film for viewers of all ages and interests, its denouement leaving you as joyful and refreshed as the slow movement of a Mozart piano concerto on a spring morning. I encourage you to rent, buy, download or view ""Vitus"" any other way possible as soon as humanly possible. Even if you don't like reading subtitles this movie pays great dividends to anyone that comes into contact with it.

A final personal note: after studying German last autumn, this was my first exposure to Swiss-German and ""high"" German. It sounded like jibberish to me when I took my class but I began to understand the differences watching this movie. If you are an English speaker with interst in German, that's another item in ""Vitus"" that will interest you.",1365897600,,2597,4.84009009009009

2957152,5,B000VWYJ6S,"First, I'm going to make a list of things I want to see in a movie:
  - Great acting
  - A solid marriage
  - Unpredictability
  - Relatable characters
  - Cute kids
  - Heartwarming plot
  - Wonderful music
  - Wise old folks
  - Fantastic success
  - Brilliant people doing audacious things
  - Fulfilled hopes and dreams
  - Beautiful horses
  - A happy ending

This wonderful Swiss/German film has everything but the horses!

As a result of a rave review from one of you (in Nevada) on my JayFlix.net list, I checked this out of the library. The only actor with whom I am familiar is the great Bruno Ganz (""Bread and Tulips"" and ""The Manchurian Candidate"" - 2004). I have admired his work for many years. You wouldn't recognize any of the other names, so I won't waste your time. I will say that the little boy who portrays Vitus at age four is cuter than a button and the boy who portrays him later is a piano protg in his own right!

The story revolves around a young genius. You first meet him when he is four, already reading books and the newspaper. The boy has an IQ of 180, is a piano protg, is a mathematical whiz and is deeply unhappy. All he really wants is to be ""normal."" His teachers resent being ridiculed and his classmates resent him for his obvious superiority. His only respite from his demanding life is time spent with his undemanding grandfather (Ganz) in his leaky old woodshop, making boomerangs and fantasizing about flying airplanes.

His parents have a solid marriage and the boy is secure in their love, but he clearly sees how much his mother wants him to succeed with his music. His rebellions are par for the course, but also a little bit different from those of the average kid. His father is dealing with the ups and downs of the corporate world while his mother tries to keep the child focused on his piano. Neither parent pays much attention to the boy's other gifts or his frustrations.

Things change after the boy falls from a balcony and suffers a head injury. The unpredictable twists and turns had me deeply involved every step of the way! No car chases, no blowie uppie stuff, no sweaty bodies, not one gun is fired and no fruit baskets were damaged making this film. ...smile...

Check it out! (Rent ""Flicka"" if you want to see horses...I did... and I got this DVD from Amazon.com.)",1329782400,,2328,4.4821002386634845

The Special Features also give an opportunity to better know the extremely admirable writer/director Fredi Murer and the actor Bruno Ganz (who plays the main character's grandfather).

When the child prodigy main character has been diagnosed with brain damage and a loss of his musical skill and his extremely high IQ, he spends some time visiting his grandfather.  While visiting the grandfather, the child listens to some CDs and then secretly begins to play J.S. Bach's Goldberg Variations in his previously highly skilled manner.  I wept when the grandfather accidentally comes across this secret performance and then removes his hat and holds it over his heart in respect and gratitude (before quietly leaving the scene so that the boy can maintain his secret).

Watch it over and over. BTW, you will have to read it, it's subtitled. But don't be dissuaded by that fact. The titling is crisp and well paced.

2957166,4,B000VWYJ6S,"The life of a child prodigy is never an easy one, and six-year-old Vitus von Holzen is quite the child prodigy.  With an I.Q. so off-the-charts it's been classified as ""incalculable,""  Vitus is already such an accomplished pianist that he would give Mozart and Beethoven a run for their money in the musical genius sweepstakes.  Vitus' parents are justifiably proud of their son and understandably intent on affording him every opportunity possible for him to fulfill his rare, God-given potential.  But how is a boy supposed to have a ""normal childhood"" when he's eons ahead of his peers in intelligence and talent and when even his own teachers are intimidated by his knowledge?  Small wonder he's an arrogant, precocious little brat long before he's reached puberty (he's already planning on attending college at age 13).  Yet, at what point does a boy finally rebel against his ""specialness"" and seek the life of a ""normal"" child?  Well, in a shocking turn of events, Vitus comes up with a way of doing just that.

""Vitus"" is a superb German film that vividly captures the stress and strain of having an adult brain essentially trapped inside a child's psyche.  But the movie also brings into focus the nonstop struggle the parents go through as they attempt to find a balance between nurturing and cultivating the child's talents, on the one hand, and not making a psychological wreck of him on the other.  And how much of their obsession with the child's gift really just comes down to the glory he reflects back on them as parents?  And whose dreams are they really trying to fulfill through his success anyway, his or their own?

Brilliantly written by Peter Luisi, Lukas B. Suter and Fredi M. Murer, and solidly directed by Murer, ""Vitus"" takes us into a world we don't often visit in the movies - that of the mysteries of the intellect - and does so with ingenious plotting, complex characterizations and outstanding performances by a wonderful cast.  Julika Jenkins and Urs Jucker are excellent as the parents who certainly mean well but who don't always act in the best interest of their child, while Bruno Gans provides a strong emotional focal point as the loving grandfather who is the one person in Vitus' life who provides him with a safe place where he can live life without pressure and just be a normal kid.  The two young actors who play Vitus - Fabrizio Borsani at six and Teo Gheorghiu at twelve - don't hit a single false note in their portrayals of a character who is half grownup and half temperamental child.

Nobody is a hero or a villain in this film; they're just well-intentioned individuals trying to work their way through an unusual and challenging situation without making a total mess of it all in the process.

The script does lose its way a bit in the second half, wandering too far into wish-fulfillment fantasy and the arcane muddle of big business deal-making and stock portfolios for its own good, but that's a small enough flaw in a movie that otherwise provides an abundance of inarguable virtues.",1249603200,2,3041,4.763809523809524

It is engaging on so many levels which makes it an experience rather than just another movie you'll forget in a week. Vitus is a child prodigy being groomed to become a concert pianist and has an IQ that is off the charts. His parents, unaware of there actions, exploit him as most do with gifted children. Vitus want's nothing more than to be normal. He craves the attention of a loving grandfather and friends his own age but has to use his cleverness to be a kid. Faking an accident, Vitus is perceived to have brain damage, and loses his virtuoso piano playing skills. He is placed in a school with children his age. Only the grandfather is privy to the plot. With all the family's interpersonal relationships this movie blossoms into a masterpiece. Never does Vitus lose any of his brilliant skills. The self made boy becomes a wizard, manipulating his family and the stock market. This allows Vitus to afford a secret penthouse music studio and to save his beloved grandfather from poverty. There's a surprise around every turn. It's feel good ending leaves nothing but great satisfaction motivating one to say,""You got to see this movie!""

  Suffice it to say that Vitus is a one-of-a-kind child, brilliant and wise (with the help of grandpa) beyond his years.

  Unfortunately, in an attempt to make the many sub-plots work, some hokey elements are introduced which took some of the enjoyment out of the movie for me. At a couple of points, I literally had to say ""C'mon, give me a break!""

Filled with extraordinary piano music, romance, undying love, and the emergence of an intelligence that is far ahead of his years, Vitus grabs one's heart very early on and never lets go. Refusing to be controlled by his teachers, his mother and father or his peers, Vitus bonds with his eccentric grandfather who, being in his declining years, acts out a role as a living icon of humble wisdom and noble character for the impressionable young musical prodigy. As the story develops, we see that young Vitus is not just a musical genius, but has a mind capable of out thinking all the adults around him to create the kind of life he wants: which is to be 'normal' and not be treated special. After rebelling against those who would control him, he eventually fully embraces his talent and gives it to the world, but on his own terms.

2957184,5,B000VWYJ6S,"""Vitus"" represents - neither more, nor less - a marvellous urban fable, around the lives and times of a prodigious child, whose IQ is far beyond the average.

But, living in these times with such genius is not easy. Vitus finds in his grandfather the creativeness, the irreverence and the breakthrough of any kind of rule or discipline. As a matter of fact his grandfather finds in its free time, an opportunity to innovate, his passion is to fly; on the other hand Vitus' father is a very smart designer and really surprises and even aims the company to get immersed into the financial market; his mother is aware about the unstoppable talent of his child and promotes him.

Vitus' passion for the music is just a sample of his multiple skills. But gradually, he will be disposed to materialize the golden dream of his grandfather (thanks to a smart knockout as the nickname of Dr. Wulf , helping at the same his father of a secure bankrupt and returning him the place he deserved in the company.

The affective life of this teenager is marvellously carved in relief through two lovable girls. The plot is like a surprises box, that never let you quiet. The film exudes that kind humanity and love for life that we usually are accustomed to watch in previous European films, (such Kolya, The 400 blows or Forbidden games  for instance)

The great Bruno Ganz, despite his supporting role, is always welcome every time he appears, he is a real master of the acting, his infinite tenderness and legendary charisma have become one of these unreachable cult actors ( sharing honours with Hopkins, Armin Mller Stahl, Philipe Noiret , Jean Rochefort, Albert Finney  or Peter O ` Toole).

On the other hand, both children, virtuosi of the piano are extremely expressive in their roles as well as the rest of the cast. The fine direction, winged script and splendid edition process, make of this film a real treasure to collect.

3191574,4,B000VWYJ6S,"Like ""Little Man Tate,"" the 2006 Swiss film ""Vitus"" depicts the world seen from a young boy Vitus, whose exceptional talent (especially as pianist), he realizes, may not be exactly what would make him and his family very happy. That doesn't mean he doesn't want to play the piano - actually he loves it - which makes the whole situation more complicated.

""Vitus,"" helmed by Swiss veteran director Fredi M. Murer and starring actual 14-year-old pianist Teo Gheorghiu, effectively describes the life of precocious Vitus whose slightly deadpan face actually hides various emotions. The actors are unanimously good, Bruno Ganz in particular as Vitus' grandfather, who represents the wisdom only aged people can provide.

Though the film starts brilliantly with and focuses mainly on Vitus' life as young gifted pianist, it also introduces a variety of his talents including stock market in the second half, which, I think is neither necessary nor credible. ""Vitus"" could have been better without some of its subplots, for example, one about his father's job in company, which only prolongs the second half, or romance with his babysitter.

""Vitus"" covers the similar territory with ""Searching for Bobby Fischer"" (another great film) where a chess prodigy has to make a tough decision to stay what he really is. The same happens to Vitus, but not in the same way because Vitus' parents, flawed as they are, are more understanding. In fact, all characters are flawed, even Vitus himself, but they become realistic all the more for that, with the balanced descriptions of the adults.

""Vitus"" was the official Academy Award entry from Switzerland for best foreign film of the year 2006 though it was not nominated. Maybe with less subplots and themes it might have been.",1197072000,5,1764,5.072413793103448

Suter and directed by Murer, VITUS explores the life of a child genius, a lad who from the age of five is obviously gifted in that he can play Bach et al after only a few months lessons and is able to read books and understand concepts that make his stance in a regular kindergarten class untenable.  But the film is less about the gifts of a child prodigy than it is a story of how a genius child longs for a normal childhood.  It is in the telling of the story that the audience is privileged to discover the joys and trials in a child's view of being extraordinary.

Vitus - played at age 6 by Fabrizio Borsani and at age 12 by Teo Gheorghiu - is referred to as a little Mozart by his parents Helen (Julika Jenkins) and Leo (Urs Jucker), and by the family friends who are amazed at Vitus' gift as a pianist.  But as is often the case with gifted children, they are overprotected, not allowed to engage in the normal activities of being a kid.  Vitus finds consolation in his grandfather (a brilliant Bruno Ganz) whose creative energy includes Vitus in his longing to fly and to build complex machines.  While Vitus continues his love for the piano he also takes risks with his beloved grandfather.  Vitus' intelligence serves him well in analyzing the complexities of his father's job and his grandfather's role in that position, and it is his genius that leads the family in a direction no one thought possible.  And of course with every story of an extraordinary young lad adapting to a puzzling world, there is also a love interest: Isabel at age 12 (Kristina Lykowa) is his fun-loving babysitter and at age 19 (Tamara Scarpellini) is the queen of his inexperienced heart and fill a void in Vitus' life that otherwise would be empty.  Fitting all of these subplots together is made magical by Vitus' constant playing of classical music - a feat the young actor is capable of performing on his own!

The cast of this film is not only gifted but is also endearing.  Bruno Ganz is a brilliant actor and he is matched by both of the young actors who play Vitus.  The story is tender but avoids bathos. It simply is an uplifting, inspiring, entertaining film.  A Must See!  Grady Harp, November 07",1196294400,26,2370,4.464037122969837
3191578,5,B000VWYJ6S,"VITUS-(2006-PG) was the Swiss entry in the 2006 Academy Awards for Best Foreign Film. It is a terrific family friendly film about a young prodigy (Vitus) who wants to grow up normal and his parents want him to use his incredible gifts and not waste them.  While his mother does come across sometimes as selfish in her desires, I imagine if we put ourselves in her shoes, we might struggle with the same tensions of how to let him grow up 'normal' and also not waste his gifts. Vitus then takes it upon himself to ensure that he will grow up 'normal'.  Through all this tension, he finds a friend in his grandfather who understands him and passes on his love of flying and woodworking, something his mother does not approve.  She goes ballistic one day when she sees Vitus learning how to use a saw because of what it could do to his fingers if he had an accident. There are also some clever little twists in the story that make this a very interesting and entertaining family movie.  [...].",1191715200,44,990,4.45303867403315

Through the magic of Amazon Prime, my wife and I were able to watch ""Vitus"" -- a film about a child prodigy pianist. ... Well, more than that, actually, and that's why I bring it up.
This film from 2007 garnered a barely fresh 65% on Rotten Tomatoes and a 3-star rating from Ebert. Easy to miss at the time. Lord knows what kind if distribution this sub-titled film may have had.
We finally saw it last weekend, and we rate much higher on our scale. We found the characters well-drawn and charming. The plot worked for us, but required a 'suspension of disbelief' that is often essential in theater.
Anyway, we say, ""Check it out!"" You will hear some very tasteful piano music, and spend time with folks who are much more fun to be with than you will find in the latest 'Action' flic.

The relationships herein depicted are SO true for those who experience, or suffer, under the current deadly political regime, the, er, differences in human intelligence and, well, let's call it righteousness.
My personal opinion is that analogies are hard, but does your model fly, given gravity, the fluid, and solar output re: weather, and all that, play?
Mostly, it's fluid. Most of you, so sadly, will never get that. Thus, it comes down to aesthetics, in a non-survival mode.

3191641,5,B000VWYJ6S,"""Vitus"" is a Swiss boy, a genius and prodigy at the piano, being propelled to a career as concert pianist by his demanding Swiss and English parents far ahead of his own ability to manage such a protocol. This extraordinary film traces this boy's life ascent from adolescent to dozen-year-old quasi-adult in less than two hours. What is most impressive is the film begins as driven parents pushing the child to adulthood that morphs into a satisfying family drama with fantasy ingredients that keep viewers of all ages involved in what is a very adult tale.

As a classical music aficianado, I was drawn to this tale because of its msuical content. It doesn't disappoint in that regard with Vitus playing portions of Robert Schumann's Piano Concerto, Johann Sebastian Bach's Goldberg variations and a slice of Maurice Ravel's Alborada del Gracioso, among other piano pieces I recognized. The score also includes a snippet of Franz Liszt's Piano Concerto No. 1.

But this little movie transcends high art and the pain of growing into an artist to become a warm, humane and touching story about the most important things in life: love, family, wealth and poverty, success and failure, maturity, coming along and getting along, and growing up -- all through the actions of a six and 12-year-old genius living what seems like a lifetime in those six years.

Vitus's ascent is abetted by a sympathetic grandfather that mentors the young boy, teaching him about life through his art and encouraging him to follow his dreams, whatever they may be. You'll be surprised what some of those dreams -- all realized -- turn out to be! One of them, a set of actions where the boy essentially saves his father's business, requires a bit of attention and will probably go over your kids' heads (and maybe yours.)

Neither that nor anything else halts this from being a magnificent film for viewers of all ages and interests, its denouement leaving you as joyful and refreshed as the slow movement of a Mozart piano concerto on a spring morning. I encourage you to rent, buy, download or view ""Vitus"" any other way possible as soon as humanly possible. Even if you don't like reading subtitles this movie pays great dividends to anyone that comes into contact with it.

A final personal note: after studying German last autumn, this was my first exposure to Swiss-German and ""high"" German. It sounded like jibberish to me when I took my class but I began to understand the differences watching this movie. If you are an English speaker with interst in German, that's another item in ""Vitus"" that will interest you.",1365897600,,2597,4.84009009009009

3191649,5,B000VWYJ6S,"First, I'm going to make a list of things I want to see in a movie:
  - Great acting
  - A solid marriage
  - Unpredictability
  - Relatable characters
  - Cute kids
  - Heartwarming plot
  - Wonderful music
  - Wise old folks
  - Fantastic success
  - Brilliant people doing audacious things
  - Fulfilled hopes and dreams
  - Beautiful horses
  - A happy ending

This wonderful Swiss/German film has everything but the horses!

As a result of a rave review from one of you (in Nevada) on my JayFlix.net list, I checked this out of the library. The only actor with whom I am familiar is the great Bruno Ganz (""Bread and Tulips"" and ""The Manchurian Candidate"" - 2004). I have admired his work for many years. You wouldn't recognize any of the other names, so I won't waste your time. I will say that the little boy who portrays Vitus at age four is cuter than a button and the boy who portrays him later is a piano protg in his own right!

The story revolves around a young genius. You first meet him when he is four, already reading books and the newspaper. The boy has an IQ of 180, is a piano protg, is a mathematical whiz and is deeply unhappy. All he really wants is to be ""normal."" His teachers resent being ridiculed and his classmates resent him for his obvious superiority. His only respite from his demanding life is time spent with his undemanding grandfather (Ganz) in his leaky old woodshop, making boomerangs and fantasizing about flying airplanes.

His parents have a solid marriage and the boy is secure in their love, but he clearly sees how much his mother wants him to succeed with his music. His rebellions are par for the course, but also a little bit different from those of the average kid. His father is dealing with the ups and downs of the corporate world while his mother tries to keep the child focused on his piano. Neither parent pays much attention to the boy's other gifts or his frustrations.

Things change after the boy falls from a balcony and suffers a head injury. The unpredictable twists and turns had me deeply involved every step of the way! No car chases, no blowie uppie stuff, no sweaty bodies, not one gun is fired and no fruit baskets were damaged making this film. ...smile...

Check it out! (Rent ""Flicka"" if you want to see horses...I did... and I got this DVD from Amazon.com.)",1329782400,,2328,4.4821002386634845

The Special Features also give an opportunity to better know the extremely admirable writer/director Fredi Murer and the actor Bruno Ganz (who plays the main character's grandfather).

When the child prodigy main character has been diagnosed with brain damage and a loss of his musical skill and his extremely high IQ, he spends some time visiting his grandfather.  While visiting the grandfather, the child listens to some CDs and then secretly begins to play J.S. Bach's Goldberg Variations in his previously highly skilled manner.  I wept when the grandfather accidentally comes across this secret performance and then removes his hat and holds it over his heart in respect and gratitude (before quietly leaving the scene so that the boy can maintain his secret).

Granted, this case is very special because the boy is a prodigy on the piano with an IQ to match. The film is charming, witty, surprising and fun and everyone should see it. Rent it. Buy it. Watch it over and over. BTW, you will have to read it, it's subtitled. But don't be dissuaded by that fact. The titling is crisp and well paced. There's something you should know about my recommendations. I love to watch movies without knowing much of anything about them, that way the story can unfold with maximum impact.

3191663,4,B000VWYJ6S,"The life of a child prodigy is never an easy one, and six-year-old Vitus von Holzen is quite the child prodigy.  With an I.Q. so off-the-charts it's been classified as ""incalculable,""  Vitus is already such an accomplished pianist that he would give Mozart and Beethoven a run for their money in the musical genius sweepstakes.  Vitus' parents are justifiably proud of their son and understandably intent on affording him every opportunity possible for him to fulfill his rare, God-given potential.  But how is a boy supposed to have a ""normal childhood"" when he's eons ahead of his peers in intelligence and talent and when even his own teachers are intimidated by his knowledge?  Small wonder he's an arrogant, precocious little brat long before he's reached puberty (he's already planning on attending college at age 13).  Yet, at what point does a boy finally rebel against his ""specialness"" and seek the life of a ""normal"" child?  Well, in a shocking turn of events, Vitus comes up with a way of doing just that.

""Vitus"" is a superb German film that vividly captures the stress and strain of having an adult brain essentially trapped inside a child's psyche.  But the movie also brings into focus the nonstop struggle the parents go through as they attempt to find a balance between nurturing and cultivating the child's talents, on the one hand, and not making a psychological wreck of him on the other.  And how much of their obsession with the child's gift really just comes down to the glory he reflects back on them as parents?  And whose dreams are they really trying to fulfill through his success anyway, his or their own?

Brilliantly written by Peter Luisi, Lukas B. Suter and Fredi M. Murer, and solidly directed by Murer, ""Vitus"" takes us into a world we don't often visit in the movies - that of the mysteries of the intellect - and does so with ingenious plotting, complex characterizations and outstanding performances by a wonderful cast.  Julika Jenkins and Urs Jucker are excellent as the parents who certainly mean well but who don't always act in the best interest of their child, while Bruno Gans provides a strong emotional focal point as the loving grandfather who is the one person in Vitus' life who provides him with a safe place where he can live life without pressure and just be a normal kid.  The two young actors who play Vitus - Fabrizio Borsani at six and Teo Gheorghiu at twelve - don't hit a single false note in their portrayals of a character who is half grownup and half temperamental child.

Nobody is a hero or a villain in this film; they're just well-intentioned individuals trying to work their way through an unusual and challenging situation without making a total mess of it all in the process.

The script does lose its way a bit in the second half, wandering too far into wish-fulfillment fantasy and the arcane muddle of big business deal-making and stock portfolios for its own good, but that's a small enough flaw in a movie that otherwise provides an abundance of inarguable virtues.",1249603200,2,3041,4.763809523809524

It is engaging on so many levels which makes it an experience rather than just another movie you'll forget in a week. Vitus is a child prodigy being groomed to become a concert pianist and has an IQ that is off the charts. His parents, unaware of there actions, exploit him as most do with gifted children. Vitus want's nothing more than to be normal. He craves the attention of a loving grandfather and friends his own age but has to use his cleverness to be a kid. Faking an accident, Vitus is perceived to have brain damage, and loses his virtuoso piano playing skills. He is placed in a school with children his age. Only the grandfather is privy to the plot. With all the family's interpersonal relationships this movie blossoms into a masterpiece. Never does Vitus lose any of his brilliant skills. The self made boy becomes a wizard, manipulating his family and the stock market. This allows Vitus to afford a secret penthouse music studio and to save his beloved grandfather from poverty. There's a surprise around every turn. It's feel good ending leaves nothing but great satisfaction motivating one to say,""You got to see this movie!""

A loving grandfather plays a big role in this. (Nope, I'm not going to give much away here since it is very easy to spoil this movie by providing too much detail.)

  Suffice it to say that Vitus is a one-of-a-kind child, brilliant and wise (with the help of grandpa) beyond his years.

  Unfortunately, in an attempt to make the many sub-plots work, some hokey elements are introduced which took some of the enjoyment out of the movie for me. At a couple of points, I literally had to say ""C'mon, give me a break!""

  But overall, ""Vitus"" is a wonderful little movie about love, genius and growing up. Lots of fun.

3191677,5,B000VWYJ6S,"Vitus is an inspirational movie that is superb on many levels; the character development of a genius, child prodigy alone makes for a fascinating tale. But it is a love story and the evolvement of a very independent spirit that we witness here in the film. Filled with extraordinary piano music, romance, undying love, and the emergence of an intelligence that is far ahead of his years, Vitus grabs one's heart very early on and never lets go. Refusing to be controlled by his teachers, his mother and father or his peers, Vitus bonds with his eccentric grandfather who, being in his declining years, acts out a role as a living icon of humble wisdom and noble character for the impressionable young musical prodigy. As the story develops, we see that young Vitus is not just a musical genius, but has a mind capable of out thinking all the adults around him to create the kind of life he wants: which is to be 'normal' and not be treated special. After rebelling against those who would control him, he eventually fully embraces his talent and gives it to the world, but on his own terms. 'Vitus' is an admirable, feel-good film that says a lot about human nature and true intelligence. Highly recommended. I loved it.",1212019200,3,1220,4.652777777777778

3191681,5,B000VWYJ6S,"""Vitus"" represents - neither more, nor less - a marvellous urban fable, around the lives and times of a prodigious child, whose IQ is far beyond the average.

But, living in these times with such genius is not easy. Vitus finds in his grandfather the creativeness, the irreverence and the breakthrough of any kind of rule or discipline. As a matter of fact his grandfather finds in its free time, an opportunity to innovate, his passion is to fly; on the other hand Vitus' father is a very smart designer and really surprises and even aims the company to get immersed into the financial market; his mother is aware about the unstoppable talent of his child and promotes him.

Vitus' passion for the music is just a sample of his multiple skills. But gradually, he will be disposed to materialize the golden dream of his grandfather (thanks to a smart knockout as the nickname of Dr. Wulf , helping at the same his father of a secure bankrupt and returning him the place he deserved in the company.

The affective life of this teenager is marvellously carved in relief through two lovable girls. The plot is like a surprises box, that never let you quiet. The film exudes that kind humanity and love for life that we usually are accustomed to watch in previous European films, (such Kolya, The 400 blows or Forbidden games  for instance)

The great Bruno Ganz, despite his supporting role, is always welcome every time he appears, he is a real master of the acting, his infinite tenderness and legendary charisma have become one of these unreachable cult actors ( sharing honours with Hopkins, Armin Mller Stahl, Philipe Noiret , Jean Rochefort, Albert Finney  or Peter O ` Toole).

On the other hand, both children, virtuosi of the piano are extremely expressive in their roles as well as the rest of the cast. The fine direction, winged script and splendid edition process, make of this film a real treasure to collect.
