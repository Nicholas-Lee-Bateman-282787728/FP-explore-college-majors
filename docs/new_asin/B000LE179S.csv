2709246,4,B000LE179S,"Excellent stories, wonderful graphics. I love the way superman was made to appear more human with his ""failings"" just like any other human. Batman however is my hero, he always manages to steal the day. He is probably the best hero ever created.",1195862400,,245,4.72093023255814
2709247,5,B000LE179S,"The final entry in the DCAU created by Bruce Timm and Paul Dini develops an X-Men vibe when all the whiny, ungrateful humans of the world decide they don't like superheroes anymore and the government creates a plot to undermine superheroes everywhere and destroy them for no better reason than the fact that superheroes have the guts and power to improve the world while most mere mortals are just whiny, neurotic crybabies who like to bitch and complain about their lot in life instead of trying to improve it.

Sounds like fun, right?

Action packed and filled with quips, JLU is not without its flaws (they really flogged the will they/won't they element of Green Lantern & Hawkgirl) and at times bordering on pretentious, but still a good animated showcase for DC's finest.",1190160000,,777,4.834586466165414
2709248,5,B000LE179S,"These two seasons are without a doubt the most captivating comic-based series I have been able to find. Mysterious government agencies, intense battles, and few hysterical Batman and Flash episodes make this the single most impressive animated DC comics series on television.",1189036800,4,275,5.571428571428571
2709249,4,B000LE179S,I like these first two seasons better than the other seasons because it had a deeper meaning and better stories. I love super heroes and love the Justice League. Great fight scenes.,1188086400,2,181,4.6875
2709250,5,B000LE179S,"I am not one of those guys who, at 53, is into comics (sorry, Graphic Novels).  I bought JL Unlimited for my Brother In Law, who is.  He, his sister (My wife) and I have been watching the stories in order, and I was struck by the quality of the story lines and animation.  This series is about the same as a live action show, only animated.  There are a couple of things I would have done differently, however.  We ended up buying the JL seasons 1 & 2, which tells a lot of the backstories for characters like Solomon Grundy, and really need to be viewed before JL Unlimited.  One thing I would like to see the creators of these series change, would be to use 3D animation rather than the traditional 2D.  The state of the Art in animation is now there... and the title sequences are in 3D.  That would be the only thing I would change.",1187740800,,836,4.18125
2709251,5,B000LE179S,"I repeat, ""Do NOT buy season 1 and 2 together."" Buy season 1 and season 2 separately on amazon and save almost 10 dollars over buying them packaged together here. Just do the math yourself and see.

***Update (11/2/07): Amazon has changed their prices and now it is about 6 dollars cheaper to buy them together instead of separately. Before you buy, it is always good to check to see if it's cheaper to buy separately or together from amazon because one way is usually going to be cheaper than the other.",1185235200,37,504,4.478260869565218
2709252,5,B000LE179S,"I remember feeling a little disappointed after watching the 1st episodes of the Justice League series. Some bad decisions (in my opinion) regarding characters design and some dull plots have led me to the conclusion that the new series would never reach the same level of entertainment from the previous BATMAN / SUPERMAN shows. I am happy to say that I was wrong.

Justice League has grown in quality during its 1st two seasons and every new episode turned out to be better than the previous one. Even the characters design issues were solved. The 2nd season of the series presents some of the greatest stories from all DC Comics animated series.

After Season 2 final episode, the creative team responsible for the series embraced the challenge of taking the series to another level by creating the Justice League Unlimited, a group of super heroes formed by as many ""good guys"" from the DC Comics Universe as possible.

The result was great! Justice League Unlimited - Season 1 presents what I consider to be the best arc of stories from all of DC Comics Animated Series.

It is hard to say more without revealing important aspects of the series, but I don't think I'll be telling much if I say that this particular arc involves a complex plot and offers a new perspective about super heroes: Is it a good idea to have so much power in the hands of few super heroes? The search for the answer for such question resulted in a great development for the series and a must-have collection for all DC Comics fans.

Justice League Unlimited - Season 2 is good entertainment too, although not as great as Season 1. But it definitely concludes the whole Justice League series beautifully and lets us fans wishing for more episodes... I really hope that happens someday.",1181606400,11,1764,4.6957928802588995
2709273,3,B000LE179S,"The Justice League Unlimted Seasons 1 & 2 are ok, but not as good as the original Justice Leauge.  The stories jump around and the immense roster will keep you scratching your head.  But all in all is decent if you are a DC fan.",1247529600,,228,4.044444444444444
2709274,4,B000LE179S,The Justice League Unlimited is the second best animated series to come out in a long time with Batman the Animated series still being the best one. The writing for most of the episodes was top notch. The prodect itself played great on my Playstation 3 game console.,1247184000,,266,4.5625
2709275,5,B000LE179S,"Before Grant Morrison dredged up every Bat-reference conceivable for his ""BATMAN RIP"" series (including the Club of Heroes, whom I'm pretty sure no one thought about for years, if not decades), the crew at Warner Bros. Animation created JUSTICE LEAGUE UNLIMITED. And UNLIMITED it was.

Unlike the old ""Super Friends"", where it seemed none of our heroes could punch anything but a robot (Violence on TV, you know), JUSTICE LEAGUE UNLIMITED had a lot of fights, blood (which could only be shown on CARTOON NETWORK), and Superheroes who were not necessarily Superfriends.

In addition, JUSTICE LEAGUE UNLIMITED had extended arcs of episodes that were anything but kiddy fare.  An Alternate Earth where Lex Luthor became president (and the WATCHMEN-like solution Superman comes up with).  Secret government facilities dedicated to taking the Justice League out of commission with their own metahumans. Even the ultimate fate of Bruce Wayne was revealed(neatly tying into ""Batman Beyond"").  STAR WARS - THE CLONE WARS benefitted from the fact that viewers would watch multiple episodes of a story arc, instead of demanding ""done in one"" episodes.  Even when JUSTICE LEAGUE UNLIMITED did a ""done in one"", chances are it would tie into a bigger story later on.

While not having the awesome color scheme of the original BATMAN - THE ANIMATED SERIES (never topped since), the series did showcase almost 70 years of heroes, from the A-List (Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman), to the cult (The Question), to the obscure (The Shining Knight? That's obscure and a half).  The series was obviously produced by people who love these guys.

Best of all, Amazon is offering a great price on this set. About a year ago, you were lucky to get just ONE of these DVD sets at the price Amazon is now charging. So clear your shelf and get this set. And don't forget to leave some room for the inevitable BATMAN THE BRAVE AND THE BOLD DVD set (no announcement yet, but here's hoping...)",1246924800,,1961,4.954268292682927
2709276,3,B000LE179S,"Well, I think it's new for dvd as 2 years ago. I want to watch it if the other children want to see it like other of them.",1244419200,,122,3.392857142857143
2709277,5,B000LE179S,"I missed this in its first run, but it's a gem than any DC comic fan will appreciate.  While all the ""big guns"" are here, many stories focus on more obscure DC characters, often brilliantly played by familiar genre actors as voice talent.

My absolute favorite (worth the cost of the series to my mind) is Jeffery Combs (""Re-Animator,"" ""The 4400,"" countless ""Star Trek"" episodes from multiple series) as the Question, in a storyline that puts the character up against a far-reaching conspiracy that only he understands, and in an unlikely romance with the Huntress.  Great stuff.",1240185600,,579,4.948453608247423
2709278,4,B000LE179S,"I will begin by stating (for those who don't know) that Justice League Unlimited is actually a continuation of the Justice League animated series.  So, if you're interested in this series, I recommend buying Justice League Seasons 1 & 2, first.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Justice-League-Season-One-DC-Comics-Classic-Collection/dp/B000CSTK3S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Justice League - Season One (DC Comics Classic Collection)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Justice-League-Season-Two-DC-Comics-Classic-Collection/dp/B000F4RH8O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Justice League - Season Two (DC Comics Classic Collection)</a>

In this series, the Justice League has expanded to include another 50-60 heroes.  Some of the new members are Green Arrow, Captain Atom, Vixen, the Question, Black Canary, Huntress, Supergirl, & Vigilante to name a few.  Some people don't like the fact that they added so many extra characters.  It's true that they didn't get to focus as much on the original 7 but I enjoyed the expanded team.  It made me want to learn about all these heroes I'd never heard of before.  I actually got&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-DC-Comics-Encyclopedia-Updated-and-Expanded-Edition/dp/0756641195/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The DC Comics Encyclopedia, Updated and Expanded Edition</a>&nbsp;(which is an awesome book, by the way) so I could get the back story on everyone.  It's really fascinating.

This part of the series has the same fine quality of animation as Justice League.  The storylines are suitable for both adults and children.  (I'm a 27 year old woman & I don't have kids.  I just enjoy the show.)  The voice actors are still great.  I give it 4 stars because the special features were somewhat lacking.

I will also admit that, like a lot of other female viewers, I developed a bit of a crush on Batman after watching this series, especially the episode ""This Little Piggy.""  I could watch that & the episode ""Kids' Stuff"" (hilarious) over & over again.

It's really a shame that this show was pulled so early.  It had a lot of potential.",1233532800,,2197,6.290969899665551
2709279,5,B000LE179S,"When the original Justice League series ended, Hawkgirl was out of the group and the remaining members vowed to rebuild their organization. BOY, did they ever as virtually every character in the DC Universe makes an appearance during these final two seasons.

The episodes have already been covered by other reviews so I'll just go into the highlights of both seasons of JLU.

Season 1:

*The Cabnus angle and how Lex Luthor was manipulating things behinds the scenes.

*Seeing The Flash get busy and actually step up and be a real hero in one of the final episodes of Season 1.

*The Once & Future Thing, Pts. 1 & 2 - New revelations that will change things for 3 JLU members.

*New revelations about the future Batman, Terry McGuinus which should've been the finale for Batman Beyond but I am glad its here on JLU!

Season 2:

*The Legion Of Doom makes their appearance.

*More revelations about Hawkgirl and Green Lantern

*Hawkman (the real one) appears

*Supergirl comes into her own and The Legion Of Super Heroes make their first appearance since Superman: The Animated Series.

*Darkseid returns for one more fight with Superman and the JLU

Overall, a good collection to add to your DVD's! As usual, has something for kids but sophisticated enough for adults.",1212537600,,1268,4.788018433179723
2709280,5,B000LE179S,Execellent.  I enjoyed so much seeing the 2 seasons.  Thanks.  They arrived on time.,1207958400,,84,4.857142857142857
2709281,4,B000LE179S,"Being a fan of the show, I was quite happy with this DVD set.  The stories are not necessarily for children, and can be enjoyed by anyone.  The video and audio are good, but I wish there were more commentaries by the creators, maybe by even some of the voice talent.  The little they had made me wish there was more.  Still - if you're a fan of this show, I would recommend picking this up!",1206748800,4,390,4.092105263157895
2709282,3,B000LE179S,"There was always more to the DC Universe than the 'top sellers'. JLI pulled out all the stops and brought in many more characters, giving them their own spotlight and showing us that they're not second-rate. And when they went back and forth in time, they pulled in even more. Lotsa good memories of comic books long gone.",1201392000,,322,4.568965517241379

8161851,5,B000LE179S,"This series was great follow up to Justice League TV series which featured the Big Three of DC(Superman, Batman, & Wonder Woman) plus 3 other popular but, lessor known heroes(Green Lantern, Hawkgirl, & Martian Manhunter). DC and cartoon network then went all out and expanded the team to like 30 plus characters. I think this series was not only one of the best cartoon tv series of the 2000s but, one of the best tv series of that decade period. This show had wonderful writing along with awesome animation (current cartoon shows should take note). The show did great job of highlighting the menagerie of  personalities and relationships amongst this superhero team including some of the more obscure DC characters (Like who the hell knew about ""The Question""?). The series is a combination of episodic and ""one off"" stories. I think this show really set the tone for the current crop of well done live action comic book based movies. I hope DC is able to capture some of this magic in their upcoming Justice League movies because Marvel sure did for the Avengers.",1425686400,,1065,4.788043478260869
8161852,5,B000LE179S,"And better than most of the live-action DC interpretations also, great writing, ideas, humor, art & especially staying true to source, as much as is possible.

8161853,5,B000LE179S,"As the title of my review states, if you grew up on these shows, as I did, then you need to get all of the shows in the continuity created by Bruce Timm and his crew.  That ranges from Batman TAS to JLU.  I'm not kidding when I say that I grew up on these shows since I was 5 when Batman started and I was in high school by the time JLU ended.  Considering that and the fact that my love of the DC Universe has only grown, I had to get this.",1257033600,,441,3.6702127659574466
8161854,5,B000LE179S,"My 11-year-old daughter and I used to watch Justice League/Justice League Unlimited every night on the Boomerang cable channel.  When the BoomerAction block dropped Justice League, I bought all the episodes so we could watch them together whenever we wish.

I'm a long-time DC Comics fan and know the Justice League members and their adversaries quite well.  Danielle knows most of the heroes and some of the villains.  We both enjoy watching Justice League/Unlimited.  What more is there to say about that?

The package includes every episode of the JLU series, plus commentary and special features.  Nothing is omitted from the programs that originally aired.

If you're a Justice League (or DC Animated Universe) fan, Justice League Unlimited Seasons One and Two are must-have items.  Highly recommended.",1254787200,,807,5.291338582677166
8161855,5,B000LE179S,It's mandatory that you love this product. The only down side is they only made 2 seasons. Bummer,1253923200,,97,4.444444444444445
8161856,5,B000LE179S,"I have the entire Justice League Series including the Justice League Unlimited and after watching the entire series 5 times I can say without reservation that this series is by far the best animated series that I have seen to date.
Not only is the art work splendid and un-reliant on the popular Japanese style animation, but the writing and casting is simply great! It is so refreshing to watch an animation that does not rely on obscenities and profanity for ""realism"".In fact I find it difficult to find fault with the full story. I would have done a few things differently were I in charge of the production but they are so minor that I won't even bother to list them here. My only criticism is the manner in which the series ended. I won't give any details on any if the episodes only to avoid spoiling it for first time viewers, but I will tell you that you will not be disappointed with this series. There may be one or two that you may find not up to the standard that the producers have maintained throughout the series but even they will grow on you by the third viewing.
I want to be the first on Amazon to call for another episode to properly end the series for a new beginning. PLEASE LET'S PUT PREASURE ON THE CREW TO COME BACK AND GIVE US ONE MORE EPISODE.
This series is deffinately the standard to strive to beat.",1249776000,2,1330,4.3453815261044175
