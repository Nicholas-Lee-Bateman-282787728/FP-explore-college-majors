8705173,4,B00UB8KUP6,"Great Peter Greenaway  visually stunning, typically controversial. The margrave loves freedom of speech until he hears what he doesn't like.",1486425600,,140,6.0
8705174,4,B00UB8KUP6,"I am a fan of all of his work. To a non fan or a newbie, this movie gas the most straight ahead plot. As us case with all of his films, total eye candy and great soundtrack.",1484697600,,173,3.5789473684210527
8705175,4,B00UB8KUP6,"Amazon needs a separate review for faulty DVD's so it's not confused with the quality of the movie. This is Greenaway at his most mischievous and profane, challenging conventional good taste with his intellectual gymnastics and masterfully ingenious visual innovation. I need to watch it again, there is so much going on inside Greenaway's brain.",1482451200,,346,5.3090909090909095
8705176,1,B00UB8KUP6,"When I purchased this almost a year ago, I did not own a Blu Ray player.  I just bought a unit that plays Region 1 only (this disc is Region B.)  Now the Amazon website has a huge disclaimer saying it will not play in North America.  That was not on the website when I bought this item, so I'm sure many have complained about the same issue.  Very disappointed  that I won't be able to view this film, as I am a huge fan of Mr. Greenaway's work. Waiting to hear about a refund.",1465430400,,477,3.9789473684210526
8705177,1,B00UB8KUP6,"Alas, I couldn't see this video.
As listed on Amazon, this disc should play on Regions A, B and C.  The disk package says Region B, Therefore this won't play on my region A Blu-ray player.
Shame on Amazon for misleading description.",1431043200,3,232,4.523809523809524
