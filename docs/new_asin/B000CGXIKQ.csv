But I can say without a doubt, that Combat Mortal is the best worst film I have ever seen. Basically no one has seen this aside from maybe a few dozen people. This is one of the most under the radar kind of indie films you can get your hands on. It's more like getting a copy of someone's home movies.

Dr. Zee Lo has made a few films now over the past 20 years, Martial Medicine Man, Chasing The Dragon and this my favorite of all his work, Combat Mortal. Do not confuse this with Mortal Kombat, aside from the similar theme song, martial arts and the film title, that is where all similarities between the two die. Dr. Zee Lo, or Dr. Z, is a real, licensed  doctor out of the greater L.A. area and claims Bruce Lee as his grandmaster. This film has no special effects or wire work. Or even a very coherent script. Aside from the sloppy script, the awful supporting cast (though there are a few great performances), Dr. Z's terrible impersonations of Bruce Lee and Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau, some poorly staged fights, and basic lack of cinematography, this film is highly entertaining. Costumes? Nope, pretty sure these ""actors"" just showed up in the clothes they were already wearing. Around the middle of the second act, this film really falls apart and doesn't really have a third act, but it does have a decent denouement. Dr. Z's character Billy Lee works as a Bounty Hunter while trying to make it as an actor in Hollywood, yet for some reason is hired by the L.A.P.D. to be a bodyguard for an actress who is being threatened and harassed. Some scenes were clearly written as an advertisement for the Dojo where Dr. Z trains, there are also a few shameless plugs for Dr. Z's liniment, and there are bits of dialogue used more than once in numerous scenes which can induce a strange sense of Dj vu in a very crappy kind of way.

I realize it sounds like I am bashing this film. Film is art, and so it is subjective. While it is easy to point out flaws in peoples work, or make fun of people online, I am simply jesting to entertain. Which is essentially what this film does, though unintentionally. This film was self-funded, meaning there is essentially no budget. I can't fault Dr. Z's production value, and being that this film was made before the revolution of house hold computers I can see how the credits, editing and mastering could have been very difficult without the proper equipment. If you want to be entertained and laugh and yell at your tv screen, then this film comes HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Also, for extra fun times view this and Gymkata as a double feature, that's a sure fire way to impress your friends with your taste in s&%##y movies.",1381968000,5,2778,4.453831041257367
