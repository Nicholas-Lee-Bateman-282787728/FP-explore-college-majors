884937,3,630447587X,My 3 and 4 year old daughters like it. My eldest is learning addition so she understands it. However I was surprised that the format isn't very clear. It seems to quickly jump from counting to addition then to subtraction (a more difficult concept). I wouldn't recommend it unless your child has had some exposure to addition. And I agree with another reviewer about the attitude on Mr. Websley. This is the first LeapFrog video I've bought; not sure if I'll buy more.,1110672000,9,468,4.650602409638554
884938,1,630447587X,"The Math Circus is a disaster. After a REALLY GREAT EXPERIENCE with The Letter Factory and The Word Factory, The Math Circus is not reccommended. It can not be compared with the prior videos of Leap Frog in any way.  My child (3.5) never watch it all over.  It's very boring to him.  Also, I don't like the grumpy and aggressive attitude of Mr. Websley in this video.  It doesn't make sense and is not in armony with the teaching process of my child.

I reccommend to Leap Frog to separate the counting from 1 to at least 20, and the recognition of numbers in one video and the addition and substraction techniques in other.  They don't mix together for a 3 years old child.",1108684800,12,674,4.352
884939,3,630447587X,"I have to agree it was disapointing. I would not go as far as not teaching anything, But there is definitly a hotch potch of information here. I think it reinforces the visual numerals, and shows there is more than counting to numbers, but I do not think the adding and subtracting in the way they have shown it will teach much to a child without previous adding and subraction knowledge. Maybe  a good reviewing tool. However compared to their other products this is not at all comparable. Maybe rent it or borrow from a friend before buying this one...I had high hopes for this product, glad I purchased the video not the DVD!",1107820800,6,628,4.508771929824562
884940,4,630447587X,"The only ""real"" problem I have with this video is that it doesn't count up to 20...only 1-10 and it's only 30 minutes long.  My son is 3.7yrs. old and he already knows how to count to 10.  My son really liked it and asked to watch it again after it was over.",1106870400,5,258,3.849056603773585
884941,5,630447587X,"This video gives kids a great introduction to math...numbers, counting, addition, & subtraction.  Highly recommend.",1106438400,,115,6.666666666666667
884942,2,630447587X,"I bought this DVD after my son learned most of his letters from the letter factory. My son enjoys the other 3 Leapfrog DVD's but since day 1 he just walks away from this one. It's boring.. they don't spend enuff time on the numbers themselves (but it did teach him the number 0 wich I'd forgotten about) and the quidgets don't even count out the numbers (ex. they say 3+2=5 instead of 3+2=5. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.) If your child already knows his/her numbers than maybe it'll be more interesting to them. My son doesn't ask for this video.. I recommend BumbleBee Kids 123's or Brainy Baby 123's. If all else fails there's Sesame Street's 123 Count With Me (wich my son LOVES and asks for almost every day). This DVD was a waste of time and money, I'm going to try Richard Scarry's 123's and probably will sell this one on eBay..",1104883200,52,821,4.303225806451613
884943,2,630447587X,"Compared to other leap videos, this one falls short.  It spends more than half the video teaching counting from 1 to 10 and blasts through the addition and subtraction without much explanation.  The video should have assumed the kid knows how to count to 10 and focused on the title of ""math circus"" and its claim to teach addition and subtraction.  Do look to other leap DVD titles like letter and word factory I & II those are great!",1104796800,9,435,4.481012658227848
884944,5,630447587X,"Unlike the previous reviewers I thought this video was great.  Though it could be longer, it gives kids (mine are 4.5 and 2.5) a good introduction to basic math concepts: association, addition and subtraction.

One of the problems small children have is that they memorize numbers and can ""count"" but they don't associate the numbers with an actual quantity.  This video uses small white mobile cubes called ""quidgets"" to teach them that numbers `correspond' to a certain number of objects.

My kids are pretty engrossed by this video and I am overjoyed that I can now give my four-year-old simple hand problems and she can solve them.

Video Outline:

--Numbers are produced: ""0 to 10"".

--Numbers are associated with corresponding numbers of quidgets, coins, fingers, etc.

  For example, no quidgets, then one quidget.  The white box gets a number 1 which jumps onto it and stays.

  Two quidgets stack vertically... the number one jumps off and the 2 jumps on and so forth.

--A song with 1 quidget, then 1 coin, then 1 finger and a 1 ""digit"" color worm... and so on until there are 10 quidgets, 10 coins, 10 fingers and a 10 segmented worm.  The quidgets are piled vertically, and the worm grows horizontally until it is 10 units long:  all numbers are shown in their worm segment.

--Then to the circus.

--Review of counting with quidgets stacking vertically.

--Using a high wire act with two swings, the quidget's do addition and then subtraction.

Two quidgets, for example, swing across and are joined by another quidget from the other swing.  The numbers 2 and 1 drop off and the number 3 sticks itself to the stack of three quidgets.  The reverse is done for subtraction.

--At the end, stacks of ten quidgets are flung into the ring until their are ten stacks of them demonstrating how we can go from 10 to 100 by ten's.",1104192000,236,1834,4.69496855345912
884945,2,630447587X,"After buying the great leapfrog ""letter factory"" and ""talking word factory"" this DVD has been a big disappointment. It does not explain anything! Your child will gain no knowledge from seeing this DVD!",1104019200,4,201,5.121212121212121
884946,2,630447587X,I have to start by saying that I love leap frog products.  In this case I was highly disappointed.  It does not explain the concept of math it just starts adding things together.  The songs were not intertaining and my 3.6 year old was not interested.  Overall not a good purchase.,1103760000,5,281,4.450980392156863

885312,2,630447587X,"We have a lot of the other LeapFrog videos and have watched them countless times, and my daughter still asks to watch them over and over again.  My daughter knows all her letters as well as the sounds they make, and can spell quite a few short words and she's only 3.  She loves the Letter Factory, the Talking Words Factory, Phonics Farm, the Amazing Alphabet Adventure, Math Adventure to the Moon, Numbers Ahoy, Numberland, Adventures in Shapesville Park, and the Magnificent Museum of Opposite Words.  I think we have others too, but those are the videos that come to mind right now because those are the videos we have watched the most.

So, knowing how wonderful all those videos are, when I saw ""Math Circus"" I got very excited thinking that it would help my daughter with some basic math, because as much as I work with her on things, let's face it: seeing familiar characters and singing fun songs makes it much easier for her to focus and remember things.

I think we've played this DVD twice.  It was such a huge let down.  My husband watched it with our daughter and told me it was awful.  I tried to sit down with our daughter and watch it a few days later, but by the first song, which was so annoying I couldn't even bring myself to sit through any more of it, I got up and listened to it while doing other stuff.

Honestly over half of the video is just counting, it only goes to 10, and it is very repetitive and annoying.  Numberland, Math Adventure to the Moon, and Numbers Ahoy all count to ten and they are wonderful with fun songs in them.  My daughter can count to 100 with very little help, so she didn't need this video to spend 15 minutes counting to 10.

The Zero always being late and saying, ""I'm just a BIG nothing!"" is definitely NOT something I need my daughter repeating.

The addition and subtraction parts are random numbers being thrown together without a good order or explanation.

On top of all of that the voices are different which was just weird.  Honestly, my daughter has more fun doing addition and subtraction with me when I use her ""Lots of Links"" and she has never asked to watch this video after the two times it's been played in this house.

I guess this is a ""lesson learned"" thing.  We were able to watch most of the other LeapFrog videos on Netflix before we bought them, and this one wasn't on there, and now we know why.  This was such a disappointment I'm not sure if we will be buying any more LeapFrog videos without watching them first.",1392940800,5,2494,4.396514161220043

I show both of these videos in my Kindergarten class often and the kids love them!  The one fault I find with this one, is it covers a few too many concepts in one video for my (classroom) needs.  Part of the video is too easy and part of it is too hard. The kids tend to get a little bored when the concepts start going over their heads.  I'm looking forward to trying the other number video that is out (the moon one)since it sounds like it is broken down into a more basic set of concepts, but I only have a VCR in the classroom and I can't find anything other than the DVD.

The ""tricks"" such as the countable objects--""Quidgets""--work pretty well, and a lot of math facts are introduced in a relatively short time, but all in a fun and entertaining way.

By the way, despite the reviews, I strongly prefer this to ""Math Adventure to the Moon,"" which is much sillier, more lightweight, and less focused.",1275264000,2,643,4.871559633027523
885679,5,630447587X,"I am an elementary school teacher, previously an early childhood teacher.  For the last 3 years I have been teaching 3rd grade math.  One of the biggest problems with children, even in the third grade, is a poor understanding of numbers, what they represent and what basic operations actually do.  Mental math is at an all time low.  When they reach my class, many children are behind and struggle to catch up.  Having a strong foundation in number sense is imperative for future success in mathematics.  This video helps young children understand what exactly a number stands for and what is happening when numbers are added or subtracted.  The video is 30 minutes long, it has catchy songs, and a story line most kids enjoy.  Is it enough to teach a child everything they need to know about numbers?  No.  However, it helps a student understand these concepts much better, and helps build the foundation they need to succeed.

This video is part of the LeapFrog DVD series, which are the best products LeapFrog has ever released.  Other highly recommended videos in the series are the first three phonics videos:

The Letter Factory teaches children the names and sounds of all the letters in the alphabet.  The vowels are only given their short sounds at this point, but that is ok for this level of learning.

The Talking Words Factory teaches children how to put letters and their sounds together to make simple words, mostly with the consonant-vowel-consonant pattern and a few consonant blends.

The Word Caper movie goes on to introduce silent E, long vowel sounds, and vowel-vowel combinations.

This video series is highly recommended.

PS  REMEMBER - Look at the title of the movies before purchasing.  This is the re-release of the older video series (You don't mess with a great thing!)  If you have the older DVD's in good working order, then you don't need these titles.  LeapFrog has released some newer videos which you might be interested in.  None are better than these originals though and they do not target the same skills.",1272326400,85,2045,4.829971181556196

It begins counting 1-10, with some imaginary thing called a Quidget(?). Then it proceeds to addition and subtraction at an incredible pace, and ends with multiplication, 10x10.

First of all, Professor Quigly is completely different (different, annoying voice and different mannerisms).  Second, there aren't really any familial-type interactions between Leap, Lily, and Tad like there are in the other videos. My daughter still likes it (she's 7 months), but it feels like it was more of an afterthought to the Reading/Writing videos.

885793,2,630447587X,"In my first review (quoted below), I detailed the disappointments we felt with this video.  And truly, compared to the reading Leap Frog videos, it *is* inferior.  However, our 6 year old kindergartener has learned more than we realized from watching it.  He'll spontaneously bring up math equations he knows the answer to (from the video), which sparks others which he does not know (3 + 3 + 3 = 9...but what is 6 + 3?, for example).  He's excited and interested in math and counting, which is priceless.  If I could change my star rating to a 3 1/2 or 4, I would.

""We have all the reading videos in this series and were really looking forward to the math one.  Though my son definitely enjoys watching it, it is far less helpful in actually building his math skills than the others.  There's too much information and it's too confusing - widgets or fingers or trapeze artists or whatever - adding sums, subtracting, no repetition...The value in it is encouraging his interest in counting and numbers, but he's not learning anything new at all.  The reading videos, in contrast, have sparked his interest *and* taught him a lot about rules of grammar, phonics, basic word building, etc.""",1188777600,9,1189,4.677884615384615

Leapfrog would have been better to make 3 separate DVD's - Numbers to 20, Addition, Subtraction.  I am a school teacher and you never introduce number sentences (3+2=5) until children have a firm understanding of basic nember concepts (one to one correspondence, number order, before and after etc...).  The DVD is still entertaining for children but I wouldn't recommend buying this one for educational purposes.

If it stuck to the nice slow pace it began with, and stuck to addition it would've been great. But it speeds up too quickly with addition, and then starts throwing subtraction at you as well.

885964,4,630447587X,I love these Leap Frog DVD's. I don't think this one is as good as the Reading/Letter one's but it is still good. My daughter (3 years old) doesn't stay in front of the tv watching it like she does the other ones. I think it is a little hard for her so she doesn't pay as much attention. The ideas go pretty fast for this age I think. A little hard for them to grasp all at once. I think she will get it over time though.,1154217600,3,421,3.7954545454545454
885965,2,630447587X,"Parents and children who loved the other Leap Frog DVDs about letters, words and reading will find this one disappointing.

Advertised as beginning math, this one is mixed up in its focus, spending quite a bit of time on recognizing the numbers from 0 to 10 (especially zero) and relating them to &#8220;quidgets&#8221;, then quickly jumping to addition and subtraction without sufficient explanation or introduction of the concepts.  Starting with simple counting, by the end of the 35 minutes, they're showing us ten times tables up to one hundred.

Very young children will probably like the repetitive cowboy &#8220;numbers&#8221; song, and may even stick around for the &#8220;circus&#8221; acts and accompanying slapstick routines, but the concepts advance too quickly for this age group.  Kids who already know their numbers won't learn anything new from the beginning of the presentation, but then again, they probably won't learn anything from the rest of it either.

Clearly one should not expect kids to learn math in 35 minutes, which makes you wonder what they were thinking when they made this one.  A more sensible approach would be to have different DVDs for each level, as they did in the reading series, so that they could spend more time going into the nitty-gritty, and making it fun.

This one is a rush job, and was not properly thought out for the intended audience.  Definitely not a tool you should count on to introduce your kids to math.

Our younger boy is in speech therapy, and seeing these DVDs has improved his articulation of letters.  I love that he requests to watch these.  I will hear him sounding out each letter along with the Frog, and know he's developing skills.  Our older son has picked up on how to build words and spell with this series.
