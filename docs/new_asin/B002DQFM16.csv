8365849,5,B002DQFM16,"Ready Willing and Able certainly has quite a fine storyline but there was also quite a storyline behind the scenes. It was to be Ruby Keeler's last musical at Warner Brothers and Ross Alexander, who killed himself before the film ever hit theaters and who should have been billed as the leading man, got fifth billing posthumously because Warners tired of his failed relationships with women to cover up his true romantic preference. Nevertheless, the film is still entertaining; the plot moves along well and I wasn't ever bored! The song and dance numbers impressed me, especially the one at the end of the film and the beautiful ""Too Marvelous for Words"" which is essentially spoken to Ruby Keeler's character by Ross Alexander's character.

When the action starts, we quickly meet down and out songwriters and would-be Broadway show producers Barry Granville (Ross Alexander) and Pinky Blair (Lee Dixon). They desperately await their big break into show business all the while stalling for time to hold onto their piano so that it won't be re-possessed! Barry and Pinky think they may have struck gold when Jane Clark, a talented British actress, arrives by ship from England--looks like Amalgamated Pictures top brass man Edward McNeil (Addison Richards) will fund their show if they can get Jane to star in it! Of course, would-be agent J. Van Courtland (Allen Jenkins) also wants a piece of the action; he races down to the docks to meet the ship and he signs Jane to a contract so that he can get 10% of her earnings.

However, what no one knows is that the Jane Clark they all think is the great British actress and star is actually just an American chorus girl travelling with Clara Heineman (Louise Fazenda) and the rest of a chorus line. Jane (Ruby Keeler) and her pal Angie (Carol Hughes) think up a plan for Jane to hit the big time by Jane pretending to be the real Jane Clark but this leads to tremendous complications and problems. Will the show open with Jane starring in it? Watch and find out!

Of course there's more to the plot than what I've already told you and I won't write much more to avoid giving out spoilers. I hope you will watch and enjoy this film as much as I did! Suffice it to say that the rest of the film shows how all of the issues play out and the musical numbers are grand.

Look also for solid performances by Hugh O'Connell as Truman Hardy; Wini Shaw as the real Jane Clark; Jane Wyman as Dot and Adrian Rosley as Angelo. May Boley has a nice cameo as Mrs. Beadle.

Ready Willing and Able is a fine motion picture that is unjustly forgotten. The acting by all is terrific and I loved the cinematography, choreography and the sets. I highly recommend this film for fans of the principal actors in it; people who appreciate romantic comedies with musical numbers will not be disappointed.",1370304000,4,2830,4.629482071713148
8365850,5,B002DQFM16,"This is a fantastic film from 1937. Not only is the acting actually quite good from the major players, The soundtrack is to die for. The score by the great Richard A. Whiting and Johnny Mercer is one of the best from this era of film making. The timeless ""Too Marvelous for Words"" still ranks as one of the best movie songs in Hollywood history. This is definitely worth seeing.",1364083200,3,378,4.414285714285715

8365852,4,B002DQFM16,"Ready, Willing, and Able is a frivolous movie, fun but without a lot of substance. The story concerns two musical writers (Ross Alexander, Lee Dixon) who are told they can have $50,000 to finance their show if they get English musical star Jane Clarke for the lead. They do sign up Jane Clarke (Ruby Keeler), only she's an amateur American dancer who is only pretending to be English for the opportunity to star on Broadway.

The two reasons to see this movie are Keeler and Alexander, both at the end of their careers with Warner Brothers. Keeler only made one more film before retiring from the screen. Alexander commit suicide soon after this film was completed. Both are talented for different reasons. Keeler was a sweet little girl who became famous for her dancing. Although by today's standards it is not immensely impressive, her sweetness prevails and keeps us interested in her. Alexander was a very talented actor filled with personality, and although he had no singing voice (his songs are dubbed in this film), he shines as a true talent of the screen. As a musical, this one lacks. The number are not wholly impressive, especially in comparison to some of the other Warner Brothers efforts from earlier years (care of Busby Berkeley). But this movie is worth watching for the stars. This film also features Allen Jenkins, Louise Fazenda, and a young Jane Wyman.",1325808000,4,1376,4.830508474576271
8365853,3,B002DQFM16,"Ruby Keeler, most famous for her signature debut role as Peggy Sawyer in ""42nd street"", has always been a butt for criticism for her amateurish presence on screen. This had a lot to do with the sappy roles which she was given in the Busby Berkeley spectaculars, the films everyone knows and remembers. What has not always been recorded is that Keeler improved with every film appearance, learning her craft like so many other film personalities by acting in films. You watched them develop up there on the screen. ""Ready Willing and Able"", released in 1937, was the last musical which Keeler made at Warner Brothers before her famous husband, Al Jolson, walked out on his contract taking her with him. A lightweight musical farce, the film demonstrates easily that Keeler had developed into a delightful leading lady and her line readings and mannerisms here are a long way from her gaucheness in ""42nd Street"". Add to that her overwhelming charm, cute Irish looks and undoubted dancing ability and her reputation is secure. She is better than the pundits would tell you. This film has some very good features:

 - the classic song ""Too Marvelous for Words"", imaginatively staged with Keeler and Lee Dixon tapping on a giant typewriter
 - the torch singer Winnie Shaw, famous for her rendition of ""Lullaby of Broadway"".  Shaw has a voice reminiscent of the great Helen Morgan, but stronger, and her singing is superb. It is a real pity that one of her numbers is curtailed.
 - a sprightly leading man, the rising Ross Alexander, who tragically committed suicide before the release of the film. Warners immediately downplayed his role and the theatrical trailer, which appears on the DVD, refrains from mentioning him.

The DVD print is adequate, better than some of the other of these unrestored and very expensive Warner's Archive releases and the only extra is the aforesaid theatrical trailer.",1261526400,11,1896,4.946540880503145
