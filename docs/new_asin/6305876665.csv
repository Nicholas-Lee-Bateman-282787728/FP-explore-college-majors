1084616,1,6305876665,"I searched for this movie for ten years. I was happy to find it here. But the quality of the dvd was awful. Almost half way through it began to freeze and distort. Then it just went back to the main menu, the last half will not play. Guess I should not have cheaped out for the import.",1372377600,,285,3.9310344827586206

1084618,4,6305876665,I liked this video and it reminds me of the romance of my youth.  It's nice to remember Matt Dillon looking so young.  And I've always had a soft spot for Hoyt Paxton similar to my feelings for Brian Dennehy.,1357603200,,208,4.175

1084664,4,6305876665,"I hadn't seen this film in a long time and had forgotten Tonja Walker was in it... I have been a fan of hers for a long time. This must have been one of her first movies.

Matt Dillon was believable and charming and also illicits great sympathy. Cindy was good too. A great coming of age to real love story.",1144195200,3,307,4.032786885245901
1084665,4,6305876665,"Okay so this may not be THE best Matt Dillion film but you must admit he is rather darling.  The film has some touching moments and some really weird ones (Lora Mae....she is TOO much!)

There were actually 2 endings to this film.  One in which the character Ginny died and the one that is on this DVD.  I wish they would have shown both and added a few extras.  It's a worth buying to add to you Matt Dillion collection.",1140912000,5,421,4.148148148148148

1084667,3,6305876665,"This is an early Matt Dillon movie.  He looks like he's 17 years old.  Cindy Fisher plays the sweet rich girl that falls unexplainably in love with a local poor heartthrob. Hmmm, yes, he's good to look at and Dillon is polite, but it's hard to say what quality of speech or physicality attracts Fisher. Then there are the usual difficulties of youth and thorny parents.  This one has a twist that only seems to happen if the setting is the South, Texas, or Bill Clinton's hometown of Hope, AK. I won't let the main complexity out of the bag, but our star-crossed lovers have their hands full.

There's plenty here to thrill and enchant a teen girl.  The plot is all melodrama, soap opera, and teen-sex stage show.  There are elements of humor to relieve the relentless drama: a greased pig contest, a drinking bout, prep boy gets sick on a carnival whip, or Dillon pays for Fisher's kiss at the same carnival.  These chuckles reminded me of American Pie, a later and far superior film.  The drama is Rebel Without a Cause, but it's inferior to the older film.  Again, this one is for Matt Dillion fans and teen girls.",1105833600,6,1117,4.49009900990099
1084668,5,6305876665,"If you enjoy Matt Dillon, you will enjoy this film. I thought Matt brought a lot of heart to the film. Cindy Fisher is excellent as well. Rent or buy this film today. If you have seen this movie on video and were not happy with the way it ended, see it on DVD it has the happier ending.",1002153600,18,286,3.864406779661017
1084669,5,6305876665,"I loved this movie for a few reasons.  Other than the love story plot, it deals with lies and deception.  It shows how damaging to a relationship,  even indirectly, deception can be.  Another reason I am extremely fond of  the film is the fact that it was filmed in my home town and our rival town  ""down the road"".  The majority of the local filming was in Sealy,  TX our rival town.  The other town involved is Bellville, TX.  The scene  with the outside of the wedding chapel is about a block from the square of  the county seat of Bellville.  The Independence day dance scenes were  filmed in Sealy at the old high school gym.  Many of my friends were extras  on the dance floor.  Where the drinking scenes were in the locker room, I  dressed as a high school basketball player waiting to face our big rival:  the Sealy Lady Tigers.  This is a wonderful movie with lots of local color.  Come visit our quaint little towns in Austin County, Texas.  We're about  50 miles West of Houston on I 10.",965347200,9,998,4.333333333333333

7896716,2,6305876665,"Ginny (Cindy Fisher) had been away at school and has come home. She is dating Richard (David Underwood) but has eyes for Jack Duncan (Matt Dillon). This is a small Texas community. Ginny is from money. Jack is not. The opening was a clue to the plot twist which one can figure out before the next clue at 30 minutes. The twist was apparent.

I thought Cindy Fisher had an unconvincing performance. I half expected for someone to throw something off the Tallahatchie Bridge with Bobby Gentry doing a closing tune. Low grade drama.
