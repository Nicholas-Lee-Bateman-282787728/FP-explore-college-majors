1802393,4,B000077VQA,"jet li wasn't inthis movie :)
this was an ok dvd. the fighting is on point. The actting is hmm.. unique. It'svery comic booky. Black masks hair annoyed me.
They fleshed him outsome more character wise, but I alwayswonder how do vigilante heros afford all the cool stuff they have since they don't work.
 i'd say part 2 goes ina different direction then one. 2 is lighter, he's not as brooding, andthere are room for sequals now withthe introduction NEW CHARACTERS  who lived till the end of the movie :)",1042070400,2,503,4.5777777777777775
1802394,2,B000077VQA,"OK, This movie is there as a B-Rated Movie.
The CGI is to fake and yet still cool. The Fight Scenes are not like Jet Li's style. Andy On makes a great Black Mask,But I cant really except him well as I did with Jet Li.
His Style of fighting is well done with Yuen Wo Ping's Fight director.
Story:[Stinks].
Plot:[Stinks]
MOVIE:it's ok
To Buy this movie:Go ahead if you have BLACK MASK 1
Also This movie doesnt have the HIP POP soundtrack Like it did with the like the first movie. And theres Too many Monster's.
And to much to take this Movie seriouslly.
I love HK Movies,but this makes it too amature than Pro.",1041897600,2,609,4.258620689655173
1802395,1,B000077VQA,"I've always really liked the original Black Mask, starring Jet Li as the costumed hero fighting fellow supersoldiers. With it's exciting wire fu action scenes to the charms of Jet Li, (which came through despite the dubbing) it was a fun movie to watch. The sequel isn't. Although it's credited to Tsui Hark as director and Yuen Woo Ping as the choreographer, it bares none of the qualities that made either famous. Most of the action combines badly done CGI, even worse CGI characters, and villains in Power Rangers-quality prosthetic make up.
The new Black Mask is played by newcomer Andy On, who will probably never work again. He's a horrible actor with nothing to work with. The rest of the cast is made up of people you've seen before, but don't remember. WWE superstar Rob Van Dam, ex-WCW wrestler Tyler Mane, and ex-porn star Traci Lords make up the wrestler villains, along with a token black guy to take on BM in a series of unexciting fights. They're lead by 2 guys I didn't remember until the end, one played by the shop owner from The Crow, and one played by the military dean from Episode 39 of the Sopranos. Neither do well in their cardboard cutout roles.
For fans of bad movies, you might get some ""so bad it's good"" entertainment, since this is grade A material for that.",1041552000,9,1289,4.584415584415584
1802396,2,B000077VQA,"Hey, remember that Jet Li movie a couple years back? The one with the hip hop soundtrack, cool fight scenes and decent story? This isn't anything like the first. As a fan of Tsui Hark I expected better. From the lame fight choreography to the bad plot and villains, theres nothing to the movie that makes it stand out. It wouldn't even be so bad if it was a clich , at least it could've been a competent one. I had a hard time caring about anyone in the flick, even the protagonist,  and when you basically have a superhero story, thats a death nail. Bad costuming didn't help either.",1473120000,,584,4.3090909090909095

1802443,1,B000077VQA,"Not much of a sequel to the original Black Mask movie with Jet Li.  This movie reminds me of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle story line when it first came out to theaters.  The fictional animal like transformation is very basic and used in high school production.  The fight scenes are okay but not at the level of the first Black Mask movie.  The story line is falls way below a ""B"" rated movie.  Dialog from a foreign film should never be graded but the content (story line) should have creative flow.  This is something that may appeal to a 12 year old child but for the original fans of the Green Hornet and the Black Mask, this story line doesn't connect with any of the previous creation.  Donnie Yen starred in ""Legend of the Fist: The Return of Chen Zhen"" and showed a stronger connection with the original Black Mask film.

Just my opinion of course.

The story line was mediocre at best. The special effects were terrible and the movie would have been much better without them. The only possible feature of redemption may have been the action. Unfortunately, the action was poorly executed and the camera work served to detract from what little action there was.

The story: desperate to find a cure for his abnormalities, the genetically-enhanced superhero called Black Mask (Andy On,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/True-Legend/dp/B0055CP9EK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">True Legend</a>) finds himself under siege by two adversaries - his creators, who've sent a lethal doctor to retrieve him (Scott Adkins,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Undisputed-III-Redemption/dp/B003FXXNH6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Undisputed III: Redemption</a>), and a pro wrestling federation led by a mad scientist (Tobin Bell,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saw/dp/B0006SSOHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saw</a>&nbsp;series) who's enhanced his performers with animal genes to create vicious man-monsters.

There's also a bit about a ""DNA bomb"" that's going to mutate the entire human race, but you don't have to worry about until the last third of the movie. Until then...who let in the pro wrestlers?

Wrestlers don't always make the best film fighters, outside of the ring, but with Yuen Woo-Ping supplying choreography, I felt confident that I'd see some cool stuff...until director Tsui ruined it for me. No doubt in wanting to give the film a Hollywood-type feel, the action content is less about well-filmed hand-to-hand matchups and more about erratic editing and a flying camera constantly trying to divert attention away from the actual onscreen fisticuffs (which are already in danger of constant interruption through the cutting way to other scenes). There's literally only one fight that's respectable, and sadly it isn't any of the ones featuring the wrestlers in their kaiju suits.

In keeping with the Hollywood-style production, Hark over-relied on CGI-modeled city- and ocean-scapes, not to mention digital inserts and models in every other scene. This goes on for such long stretches that occasionally you can't help but think you're watching a video game being played - a video game with outdated graphics, so after a while it seems like a SyFy production instead. There really is no around this, so it's enough to ruin the movie, but there's some enjoyable silliness to fall back on. A doctor character played by Teresa Herrera is so phobic of being touched by men that she freezes up like a mannequin whenever Black Mask lays a hand on her. At times, the movie tries to play this straight, but it doesn't top the scene wherein a mutated Black Mask and she wrestle around and sentimental music plays. (SPOILERS) Late in the movie, Scott Adkins shows ol' Jigsaw who's boss by separating his head from his body and keeping it sustained on a machine (""I got rid of the parts I didn't need""). The movie proceeds to end bearing a number of loose ends, including the state of a couple characters (Tobin Bell's among them) and failing to explain why it's supposed to be a happy ending since Black Mask is still being hunted by his creators.

If you go into this with high expectations, your rating will be lower than mine, but watch this like you would a National Geographic special and you can appreciate its strangeness.

1802479,3,B000077VQA,"One more electronic game transferred from the console to the screen. Absolutely no human density since the only interesting element here is the fights, battles and other struggles. Add to the humans some genetic manipulation and the game is won. Men become monsters and super brains become dark thinking machines. The hero is invaded by the wrong genes and saved by some genetic antidote. He finds a good doctor on his road, and that good doctor is a young and nice woman, good-looking too. The point is there is hardly any human dimension in this film. It is based on the scare differences can produce among human beings and this scare is the tool used by the bad guys to take control of the whole planet, if possible. We are here in the alternative fright of the beginning of this century. The first one is nuclear power, but it comes from last century. The new one is genetic manipulation, chemical or even germ warfare, etc, those things you breathe in and inhale and that transform you in one night time. This is of course a real scare and at the same time good support for the western states that have decided after 9/11 to turn security minded, and only security minded. The theme had been used vastly by Stephen King before, in the 1970s, and by a handful of other writers, not to speak of all the B series film on the subject. The point is here that the film has practically no depth since it is based on the scare among people who have no kind of human feelings, really. You do not even invite a girl to go out for anything else but sensual pleasure and showing off power. The rest is small talk without any profundity. But it is charming to the eyes and the monsters are nicely ugly.

1802480,3,B000077VQA,"okay, i have watched this movie a couple of times, and i cannot disagree that it is terrible.  however, i think it is one of those movies which is so utterly pitiful that it becomes comical.

there really isn't any redeeming quality to this whole movie; acting, special effects, choreography, character development, plot, ect. - all bad.

Thing is they are over the top bad, so when you watch it the first time don't go into it thinking that it will be some great martial arts movie like the first, otherwise you'll just be bitterly disappointed.  Instead, you should watch this for the goofy action and ridiculous storyline, then its entertaining.  I like to get a large group of friends together and watch bad movies like this to laugh sometimes.",1151884800,,748,4.723076923076923
1802481,1,B000077VQA,"This movie definitely brings the franchise down several notches. The first movie gave you Jet Li in an exciting superhero/martial arts film with plenty of makes Hong Kong action movies great. This time not only don't you get anything even close to resembling a Hong Kong action film you get a completely mess from what apparently is supposed to be a revamped version of Black Mask.

When I say revamped I mean butchered. As in they changed the whole concept of who the Black Mask is and what his past is. No longer is the Black Mask a military experiment gone rogue. He's now a genetically enhanced mercenary who works for a giant brain... gone rogue. The plot is something I would expect from Roger Corman when he was making quickie monster movies in the 50's. Basically the first movie didn't even exist. Why did they even call it a sequel? The story kind of branches out into two different plots that seem to get mixed up with each other more than compliment each other. Character development on the good guys was entertaining enough with characters like Dr. Leung (Teresa Herrera) but the bad guys were hard to peg. You can't really tell if you should either like or hate some of them and it stays that way throughout the entire movie.

The acting is functional with much of the main characters. Traci Lords and Teresa Herrera did give some depth in their performances. John Polito is always a good actor to have in your pool. He can give a shine to any script. The rest are average. The action itself is very lacking compared to the first movie. This being an American made film maybe they just couldn't get the same choreographers I suppose. Still the martial arts are what made the first movie really stand out. Without that same level of action the sequel severely lacks. The worst part about this movie is the special effects. ALL of it is CG. Not just any CG. Bad CG. It's painfully obvious every time a computer animated whatever happens. About the only good thing in production is the design concepts for our hero the Black Mask and the main mercenary villain.

Where the first Black Mask was a thrill to watch this one hardly measures up to even the most basic of martial arts or superhero movies. The plot feels contrived and the special effects are terrible. If you are a die-hard martial arts fan you might find this movie worth checking out if there is nothing else to do. For the rest of you I would just recommend doing something else. Anything else.",1141862400,,2469,4.556306306306307
1802482,4,B000077VQA,"I agree with many reviewers when I say ""What the hell is this movie on?""  Black mask versus a giant brain versus evil wrestling mutants?  Very strange.  But in the end I think that's a good thing.

You're not going to see many movies like this.  For its uniqueness alone it earns 4 stars in my book.  While not nearly as good as the original Black Mask (the loss of Jet Li doesn't help) it is a heckuva lot weirder.  The story seems cobbled together from different elements, but they still managed to make something coherent.

Tsui Hark's direction is always more interested in being cool than clear, and here it shows.  The action scenes can be hard to follow.  But how many mutant martial art movies are there?  Guyver 1 & 2 are the only ones that come to mind.  This movie is better than Guyver 1, not nearly as good as Guyver 2.

1802486,1,B000077VQA,"I suppose what made this movie such a let down was the fact that Jet Li made no return and there was nearly no return from any other character in the original cast.  This movie is a cheesy knock-off of X-Men and while the director overly uses his computer generated effects in an attempt to accentuate the picture and make the movie a bigger hit, it only makes the movie worse.  The martial arts scenes are so lame that I was surprised to see no use of onomatopoeia following every punch and kick.  The characters are laughable and cannot be taken very seriously.  For those hoping to see a great movie involving Jet Li, don't be fooled. He does not appear in this movie at all, and to buy this movie would simply be a wasted effort.",1072483200,2,733,4.328467153284672
1802487,1,B000077VQA,"Famous Hong Kong director Tsui Hark brings back cult action film ""Black Mask"" (the original featured cool Jet Li) which he once produced.  But this remake minus Li is simply awful.  Sorry to say this, but IT STINKS.  Consdiering that fact that Tsui Hark once helmed exciting ""Once Upin a Time in China"" series, it is sad to see this downfall.  What happened to him?  Is that because he made ""Knock Off""?  Or ""Double Team""?
Anyway, if you have to see ""BM2"" keep this in mind.  Story is low on credibility, but that doesn't matter.  If you hear the hero of the film in mask is an ex-super soldier, and a bunch of bad guys (including pro-wrestlers genetically turned into monsters!!) are aiming at his life for whatever reasons I don't know, it's OK.  Just give me good actions, and I'll be happy.
And the film's stunt coordinator is Yuen Wo Ping, which means something to action flick fans.  Sadly, the actions here are far below the level we can expect from his name.  Actions are fewer than they should be, and they are just standard ones, nothing special (by his standard, of course).  After watching Jackie or Jet or even Keanu, it is a huge disappointment.
The only interesting factor I can find is its casting; the ""mask"" is a newcomer Andy On, whose action and acting is just passable.  Of more interest is the participations of Jon Polito (as wrestlers' manager), who is regular of Coen Brothers.  The wrestlers are played by Tyler Mane (in ""X-Men"" as Siber Tooth); Rob Van Dam who is really a wrestler; Andrew Bryniarski (seen as ""Leather Face"" in new ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"") and Tracy Elizabeth Lords as 'Cameleon.'
Tracy Lords?  Yes, that's her.  Surprisingly Ms. Lords is good, but actually, her character undergoes very cheezy CGI-processed metamorphosis, so don't expect much.  This silly, cheap CGIs are so awful, killing any potentials of the film.  You know it is a problem when the images you can see on PS2 look better and convincing than the one you're looking on your DVD.
Curiously the film looks as if washed-out; all colors seem faded and things look blurred.  I watched it in theater in Japan, but I think things are not different elsewhere.  This sort of flim condition is often seen in Bollywood films, and if you prefer clean, clear-cut colors, you may not like the images of this film.  But of course, if only there's some redeeming quality in it, I would ignore thiese techinacal matters.
""Black Mask 2"" is really awful in whatever way you judge it.  Just take my advice, or at least, you can stick to the original.  It is far better.",1067212800,,2565,4.638580931263858
1802488,1,B000077VQA,"Why? By the gods of hell did they make this movie. The first Black Mask was difficult enough to watch. This was probably the worst movie ever made. They tried to make it look like a comic book but failed. I mean the plot (if you can call it one), seamed to be written by a 10 year old with brain damage. A giant brain in a jar was given credit for creating Black Mask and another guy wearing messed up glasses. Another freak was using animal and plant DNA and splicing it with his wrestlers. Well, one wrestler freaks out and turns into probably the worst looking monster ever created. They all end up turning into really poorly thought out monsters (all except the lovely Traci Lords). The whole movie is filled with terrible CG and bad fighting. The makers of this movie tried using big named low grade actors and just E grade supporting players to try and pull this crud fest off. Tyler Mane (hoping to do better than his Sabretooth role, nope), Rob Van Dam (he really should hurt his manager for this movie), And Traci Lords (the poor woman really needs a good break, but sorry this aint it).

This sequel however, is cheesy from the get go. It's no wonder that Li refused to be in this misfire of a movie. Not only is the acting terrible, but we are bombarded with really bad CGI, and a plotline that makes absolutely no sense at all. About the only good things I can recommend about this film are the creature makeup and the fact that Tyler Mane is probably using this movie as acting practice to reprise Sabertooth with many more speaking lines in either an X-Men sequel or a Wolverine spinoff movie.

1802494,2,B000077VQA,"Before I start I have to say that it looks like they put a lot more money into this movie. Cheesy as it was it actually was shot very well. So if they're going to put this much money into something this bad why can't they make a 3rd live action movie of the Guyver. I mean the first one was stupid but the second one is why I think it's cool enough to deserve another sequel.
 Ok that being said, first of all I love Jet Li, so when I saw the first Black Mask, I hated it because the dubbing was horrible and they over did it with the rap. It may have good rhythm but it just doesnt mix very well in a fight scene. I see a martial arts film I expect the music to get the adrenaline pumping.
 The good thing about this film, it doesn't look dated. Unlike the first black mask which was made in 1999 this one doesn't look like it was made in the 80's. The music wasn't annoying and instead of using horrible dubbing they actually got actors to speak english very well. The first 10 minutes or so in this film are the best, after they enter the city thats when it's no longer a Black Mask movie. It's more like the game Bloody Roar. I mean it's like they completely abandoned the first 10 minutes of the movie and just started it all over with the wrestlers. If they had stick with that it might've done ok without Jet Li.
 I gave it 2 stars because of the fight scenes and the way the movie looked. Sorry but I've seen plenty of HK movies and they all look very dated. What really [is bad] is that it seems they put a lot of money into this and went through a lot of trouble with the fight scenes and effects and only came out with this garbage.
 Two Stars, in my opinion rent it only don't buy it. The DVD doesn't even have any special features except three trailers. And as for the actress who freezes up whenever a guy touches her, I think most guys when they saw this movie said to themselves That's not what I would've done if I was with her.",1042243200,,1945,4.0310880829015545
