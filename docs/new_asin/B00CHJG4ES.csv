5722224,5,B00CHJG4ES,"Great 3 hour concert for Miku fans. She sings all her hits from project Diva 1 & 2. She is joined by other vocaloids like Rin and Lin, Luka, Meiko, and Kaito. Overall, this is the best Miku concert there has been. The 2014 Los Angeles Miku concert used all these animations but omitted a lot of the costume changes seen on this Blu-ray. Cute costumes are fun for Miku fans and this concert delivers. I'm 100% content with this purchase and was happy with the quality of the footage, the sound is great with a home theater.
Note that the disk does not have subtitles and is broken up into two Blu-rays. The third disk is a small documentary on the concert.",1417996800,,655,4.333333333333333
5722225,3,B00CHJG4ES,"This is a great set, The best mikupa to date. My only complaint is the lack of anything but japanese subtitles. I understand its not technically intended for international audiences but they really missed a great opportunity by not shelling out for a translator. Considering there are english subtitled bootlegs available for download, the box and included porch (POUCH) in this set isn't going to be enough for many western fans.",1403913600,,430,5.070422535211268
5722226,5,B00CHJG4ES,"This particular set went beyond my expectations. Iis after all the legendary,well talked about 3 hour Kansai Mikupa. The only complaint I have is that it does NOT allow you to change camera angles (a lost art & feature on DVD & Blu ray) especially with the Bly ray disc.but overall for a foreign concert disc,it was literally packed with so many extras. The Mikupa booklet documented every concert & showed pictures of even the merchandise that was sold.""The Porch"" (spelled phonetically & pronounced Pouch in English) was also included. On top of that,there was a third bonus risc with clips of the concert from all over Asia & Japan. At the price I paid,it was actually less than Japanese Retail Price too.

8581782,5,B00CHJG4ES,"What an amazing concert. Probably one of my favorite concert videos, actually. I'd originally logged on just to ""window shop"" the Vocaloid concert Blu Rays, with no intent of buying them, because I couldn't really justify paying over $50 for a concert, even if it came with some cool stuff. Then I spotted this little gem. Over three hours of Vocaloid goodness, a little draw string bag, and concert book for under $40; how could I turn down that offer? Also, I bought it used, and was pleased to see that it was practically like new (and Kudos to the seller for getting it to me way before it was expected to arrive).

Now onto the concert itself:

Before I saw this particular show, I'd seen a few clips from previous Hatsune Miku events, but never a full concert, and I gotta say, this one was by far one of the best. For starters, other concerts footage that I'd seen had the projector directly behind the glass wall that Miku and the others are projected on, but for the Live Party 2013 show, they put one at each of the top corners, which got rid of the annoying glare that appeared every time they passed in front of it. Unfortunately, for some reason they decided to put the bass player behind the glass, so instead of a mildly annoying glare, you see him through Miku for almost the entire show. However, that shouldn't deter you from wanting this product; the quality of the show, the totally awesome songs, and the amazing performance by the band are enough to make up for this little faux pas. And while I'm not a huge fan of the first song (Secret Police), the show only gets better from there. I wish I could say more about this concert, but I don't think my words could do it any justice, so you'll just have to get it and see how awesome it is for yourselves.

P.S. I kind of wish that Meiko played a bigger part in these shows. I mean, Kaito gets two songs, so why can't Meiko?",1455408000,,1894,4.344632768361582

8581788,5,B00CHJG4ES,"This is a must-have for any Vocaloid fan, or anyone that enjoys unique and creative music entertainment.  Well produced, well edited, lots of interesting camera angles, great band performance, and clean sound.  I watched it once through my system speakers in 5.1 DTS and was not terribly impressed, but I've never been impressed with my 5.1 setup.  The vocals sounded distance and lost in the ambience of the auditorium, and the band instruments sounded muddled and difficult to hear, especially the guitar solos.
I watched it again playing the 2 channel track through stereo headphones and it was a completely different concert.  The vocals are bright and clear, and I can hear every instrument, and lots of other things I've never heard before.  I highly recommend listening through stereo headphones.

This is a great deal.  Unbeatable price for a 3 hr. concert.  Delivery was fast and the product was authentic and complete.  I ordered from Tokyo Sea Blue Market.",1428105600,2,967,5.031446540880503

8581790,5,B00CHJG4ES,"This set includes the following items: 3 Blu-ray discs, an insert booklet with lyrics (in Japanese), a little mini-program which contains information about Miku's backing band, information about some of Miku's tours in 2012-13, some illustrations of Miku and friends, and information about various swag that could presumably be bought at the concert.  The insert also shows all the costumes used during the performance.  The box also contains a souvenir canvas pouch and a ""Memorial Photo File"" which has a glossy 4"" by 6"" ""photo"" of Miku, Luka, Rin, and Len.  Be advised the photo file is bigger than the artbox; mine was wrapped together with the artbox, so it could conceivably get separated and lost.

All this swag is nice, but the real attraction of course is the concert.  Fans who attended the concert sure got their money's worth, as the concert runs 191 minutes (counting the 10 minute intermission). Here's the complete setlist.

ENCORE

37. Tell Your World
38. Letter Song
39. Starduster

Most of the songs should be familiar if you've played the various Project Diva games. I'm not sure why the concert is broken up on two discs, as I'd think a single blu-ray could easily accommodate the entire concert. It's a little annoying having to switch discs at the intermission...

The third disc contains alternate performances from other shows around the time the main concert was filmed.

About the concert itself:

The good:

The setlist is quite varied. There's some newer material, as well as some older songs (PoPiPo, My Time). IMO, the inclusion of Time Machine, Two Breaths Walking, Melancholic, and Hatsune Miku no Gekishou justify the purchase, but every fan will no doubt find some favorite song is missing from the setlist (Odds and Ends!).

There are lots of costume changes. I count 10 different costumes for Miku.

The crowd is very into the concert, especially when they are singing along to ""Melt"". After watching Miku on David Letterman a few weeks back in front of a very ""meh"" crowd, I realized how much better it is when Miku has an enthusiastic audience!

There are some cool effects, like Miku floating above the audience during Hatsune Miku no Gekishou.

I've always thought Miku sounds best live, as a live band seems to give the music a little more of a bottom end. Every now and then, Miku can get a little shrill and I think the live band evens out the sound.

The not so good:

The stage is set up a little bit weird. For most of the concert, the bass player stands directly behind the screen where Miku is projected. When the stage is not dark, this means you can see him ""through"" Miku. This is a little distracting at times.

Maybe I'm a big jerk for saying this, but I could have done without all the instrumental solos.

Meiko seemed pretty shall we say ""bouncy"" during her one and only song. It was a little distracting; at times it was if the breast physics from the Dead or Alive games had taken over.

PoPiPo got abbreviated for some unknown reason. The Engrish verse is omitted completely.",1418428800,12,4546,4.784891165172855
