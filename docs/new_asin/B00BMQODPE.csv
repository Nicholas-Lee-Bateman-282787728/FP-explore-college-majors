5647783,3,B00BMQODPE,"WARNING: I have a family member in the cast, my son David Yuzuk plays ""Grease"" Cohen.

That said, I grew up on World War 2 submarine movies and USS Seaviper has an interesting twist on Germany and Japan's interest on developing nuclear weapons.

The important thing to keep in mind is that this is an indie movie and doesn't star Clark Gable, Burt Lancaster, Glenn Ford, Kelsey Grammer, or Cary Grant as the captain . . . nor were millions of dollars spent on the production. It is in that context that I gave the movie 3 out 5 stars. And, if the interior submarine sets look real, they are. USS Seaviper was filmed on a World War 2 submarine, the USS Drum in Mobile, Alabama.

I am not here to critique the film or praise my son's performance (although I did enjoy it), but rather to suggest you buy the DVD and make up your own mind.",1369180800,3,835,4.272151898734177
5647784,2,B00BMQODPE,"The makers of this film cleverly avoided the insignia errors that frequent low budget productions by omitting them altogether except for the three star admiral. The USS Seaviper is sent on a classified mission to Sumatra. Along the way they decide to engage the enemy and give away their position. On the island they recover a downed pilot who informs us a German U-boat is there along with a Japanese destroyer escort.

Most of this low budget  film involves underwater drama on the submarine.  The trailer for this film gives too much away. The mystery is the cargo.  The film is designed to be a pseudo history. The acting was better than the script, which isn't saying much.  Worse than an Asylum production, but better than a Tempe Video.

5647793,2,B00BMQODPE,It just sounded like a really cool movie! Sadly it fell short.  The acting is well just shy of a High School play!  The story itself had a great base to it.  But it just never gets there.  I am not sure if it was the bad acting that made it hard to connect to the Characters in the story.  There are times when it was all I could do to stay awake!  Way to much time with the sub just sitting and being depth charged.  I wish I could say something good about the movie.,1439856000,,468,3.8125
5647794,1,B00BMQODPE,"I knew from the beginning this movie was going to be bad, it was.  I respect the memories the guy had of his father, but that's all.  Acting was grade C, character interaction was lousy, effects were lousy, money was wasted. Lots more to say, don't feel like it.  Again, I respect the guy's father and his service, that's it and why I gave it one star.",1439337600,,352,4.223880597014926

5647809,3,B00BMQODPE,"This true story needed the attention of my other favorite films.  The story was true and extremely exciting, but the film was done poorly.  Needs a redo. With some real great actors, directors and exit some of the filler stuff which had no bearing.  The crew was always at odds.  I don't know if this was true, but I thought, in the beginning they picked the most elite crew, and all the time they argued.  Now I'm confused and await a proper story on this true epic.",1402704000,,467,4.32183908045977
5647810,1,B00BMQODPE,"This is non-professional Hollywood at its worst. The actors had no talent, they did not try to read their lines well and the producers failed to give the actors proper uniforms, no one had any rank nor did they act in any way like they were in a disciplined force.

I purchased several copies of this movie and have sent them to friends who all thought the movie was very good.

5647833,2,B00BMQODPE,"I wanted to like this movie, but I found the weak acting a bit too much to overlook. Yes, it's low-budget, etc etc etc - but really, I've seen second-year film students produce better films for homework assignments.

Also, one key aspect of the movie was quite offensive to me. I don't want to spoil anything for anyone who might watch, but there's a subtle implication that one of the major American innovations of the WWII era was in fact stolen from the Germans and Japanese. I find this insulting to the memories of the countless American engineers and scientists who did the real work.",1370131200,,590,4.619047619047619

During their mission, they must also stop the Germans from delivering a high powered weapon to the Japanese.  If you enjoy independent film making, this was really well done considering the budget constraints. It was also shot on a real ww 2 submarine, which hasn't been done in many years.  This was also a passion project for director Ralph Villani, who fulfilled his dream of shooting on the very submarine his father served on.",1369872000,,503,4.704545454545454

8570955,1,B00BMQODPE,"The worst war movie or submarine thriller I have ever seen, and that's saying something (*cough cough* Company of Heroes).  Apart from the uniforms and military terminology being completely inaccurate and making no sense (tolerable in some cases) the plot was slow going and made little sense, the acting was terrible, dramatic scenes so overdone half the movie is literally just the actors breathing heavily, and the action scenes were so poorly written that they might as well have been left out altogether.  I wish I had only rented it, the trailer was deceiving.  If you want a good submarine thriller, watch Run Silent Run Deep.  If you want a WWII action movie, watch the Dirty Dozen, Big Red One, etc., but don't waste your time and money here like I did.",1482710400,,762,4.75
