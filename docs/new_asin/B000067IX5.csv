1715667,3,B000067IX5,"This film is well done but I cannot bring myself to give it higher marks for one reason...it is quite obviously plagiarizing
the Italian classic by De Sica, ""Ladro da Bicicletta"".  Had the director made some admission of this fact on the DVD cover, I would have felt better about the film (maybe he has done so elsewhere).  If he has, I would then be quite happy to withdraw my criticism.

1715668,5,B000067IX5,"Beijing Bicycle is the Chinese version of the Italian film Bicycle Thief, and with this in mind the audience should not be disappointed.  The story is about two teenagers who live in Beijing. One of the teenagers has just arrived from the countryside and the other has lived in the city his whole life. A social economic message is delivered through these two teenagers, an owner and a thief of a mountain bike, and is intertwined with adolescent obstructions of coming to age.

 Panaramic shots of hundreds of bicycles parked in Beijing.
 Shots of brand new *huge* high rise apartment buildings.
 Much larger than anything you've ever seen in the US.
 Amazing.
 Bicycle chase sceens in the old streets of Beijing.

 It's a pleasure to see something
 different from the cookie cutter world we know in the US.
 No Starbucks, McDonalds, or Walmarts.

One thing I really enjoyed was the director's use of
symbolism. There's a clip where every time a certain
young woman walks by you hear her clop-clop high heals.
I can't say too much with out giving away some of the
fun but it is really suprising how such a subtle
effect can turn out to be so powerful!
The casting was great. The acting was so good that a
during the beginning of the film I thought I was
watching a documentary.
Anyone whose spent a period of his life where $10 is a lot
of money can relate to the events and charactors in the film.
The story is about the incredible struggle for
human dignity in the face of inhumanizing poverty.

1715751,4,B000067IX5,"I saw bits and parts of this film last night on TV and decided to check it out again on dvd.  It is quite surprising that a movie about a boy losing his bicycle can be compelling. It is a harrowing account of innocence lost and honestly, it is a bit brutal. It is a tale of a young man and his lost bike.

Plot synopsis partially derived from back cover:
Set in modern-day Beijing, this powerful and evocative drama depicts, in brilliant detail, the daily struggle that the millions of citizens of Beijing face day in and day out. When a young man, Guei, arrives in Beijing from a rural village he finds a job as a delivery boy. Discovering that must make 60 deliveries before he can pay for the loaned silver mountain bike which he needs for his work, he sets about to become the most efficient and diligent worker in his team. However, when he has almost finished paying his debt, his world is smashed by the discovery that the bike has been stolen. After a night spent running all over the city, he eventually spots a young man riding the bike. But when Jian, the new owner, claims to have bought the bicycle at a market, Guei enters into an often power struggle that will lead to violence and humiliation. In order to resolve his plight he must find the determination to fight for what is rightfully his.

The film is directed by Wang Xiaoshuai, he makes a realistic vision of what goes on in his native land. There are metaphors aplenty in this little film and some use of potent symbolisms here. The movie begins with a sweet ""coming of age"" drama that is symbolized by Guei's joy in riding a bike. After his bike gets stolen, the gloom and dark side of adulthood shows its face.  Innocence is doomed; it becomes lost, while brutality, envy, and arrogance become more of a necessity or figurehead. This is all symbolized when Guei first takes his bike back. The bicycle I believe symbolizes Guei and Jian's soul (more of Guei's) or rather their transformation from optimistic innocence into their realization of the (sometimes) disappointing reality of life.

The film's main premise is actually a bit darker than one might expect. It has the potential to totally depress its viewers. If you didn't get the symbols, one might think that the film is too simple because the film does focus  on two young men do going back and forth stealing the bicycle back from each other. It may get a bit repetitive. However, the film's message is actually not that simple. It also portrays Guei a gutsy, resourceful young man and totally committed to his cause while Jian is more of a whining, overbearing brat who depends on others. Two human characteristics are represented.

Thankfully, even with its very significant shift in tone, the director manages to pull off some lighter moments with pretty girls Zhao Xun and Gao Yuanyuan. They give us a break in the testosterone laden violence that makes up most of the film by brightening up the proceedings.

VIDEO/AUDIO: 1.85 ratio anamorphic widescreen. Clean and bright video transfer with good colors. The transfer isn't perfect, it has minor edge enhancements. 2.0 surround track in Mandarin is sufficient for this type of film.

Parting thoughts:
Although a lot of people may think Jian's actions in the final act is illogical, but I think his irrationality is why it hits more at home. Who says teenagers are rational or logical? BEIJING BICYCLE'S unflinching and realistic climax is dead on. In reality, even nice guys like Guei end up taking the fall for the arrogant Jians of the world. Sadly, this is cold fact.

1715752,4,B000067IX5,"This is one movie where you just want to jump in and do something. My story is like some others I know; I kept seeing this movie on the shelf at the video store. I thought it looked ok but not interesting enough to spend money on. Thank god it finally came on TV and I think it was worth the wait. The movie is about a young man named Guei who is looking for work in Beijing. He's lucky and finds a delivery company and is happy about his new job. Guei is given a bike to complete his deliveries, after working for a while he will earn enough to buy the bike. After running into some trouble with a delivery and being extremely late picking up a package he returns to get his bike only to find out it was stolen. Guei then gets fired because the package was received late and now he has no bike. Guei is so determined that he asks his boss if he finds the bike could he have his job back. His boss is so impressed by this that he says yes.

Ok so maybe so far the story may not appeal that much but then another main character is bought in. Jian is a not so spoiled but very bratty school kid and somehow he ends up with a new bike that looks exactly like Guei's. In the movie everyone has a bike and they're very important. Jing's father is not bringing in enough money to get him a bike. His father believes in his son but just can't afford the bike so this kid is planning on doing anything to get a bike. Guei finally catches up with Jing and the two start a little war over the bike. The big problem is that Jing has a bunch of friends and Guei has none so you can imagine what happens every time Jing catches him.

Maybe some people will find this movie a bit funny I just couldn't. Guei played by Cui Lin has a presence and face that really makes you feel his pain. To some the movie may sound crazy but this guy did nothing wrong and ends up in a series of truly unfortunate events. He needs the bike to get money to live and the punk kid wants a bike to impress girls and ride around with his friends. Honestly the real genius lies in these characters, what some people may hate I believe are great performances by Cui Lin. He is a powerful character and looks and acts very realistic, trust me you'll feel him.

I did find the movie very frustrating at times cause the repetitive beatings got on my nerves. Also I think the director messed up by focusing a greater majority of time on Jing's life when Guei's could've developed and become and really become the sole of the story and not the bike itself. Guei is the more powerful actor and character. Overall this was a decent film that could've been better. The dialogue was not so good, when you expect or really want someone to speak nothing happens and your left with too many minutes of silence. There are a few unexpected things that come and a little bit of comedy. Once again that acting made this movie what it is and Cui Lin one great actor. Would I watch this movie again? Maybe not for a while but it is definitely worth at least one watch.",1190937600,5,3012,4.127768313458263
1715753,3,B000067IX5,"I remember my first bike.  It was a Huffy.  It didn't have a name and I believe my excitement for it only lasted one summer, but it did get me from point A to point B, and I will always remember it for those solid memories.  What would be my actions if during that one summer of joy my illustrious bike were to be stolen?  Would I bring about wrath and vengeance upon anyone that dared cross my path?  Probably not, but it would have been fun to have an adventure like the two boys in this film.

To make it simple.  Boy is trained to be a courier.  Bike is given, but needs to be paid off.  Bike is nearly paid for when it is stolen.  Boy goes bonkers.  Change story.  New boy finds love with new (stolen) bike.  He makes more friends.  He is the rooster of the farm.  Then, these two boys meet.  Violence begets violence.  Boy looses girl.  Boy continues to loose job.  Violence ensues.  Cut to visionary ending about the life of a bike.

Was this a documentary?

""Beijing Bicycle"" kept my attention, but left me utterly confused as to who to root for.  For the first hour of the film, I found myself on the original boy's side, but somehow changed midstream, but then changed back, only to find myself apathetic towards the end.  This is not the consistency that I like my oatmeal.  A lumpy camera gave us a sympathetic eye towards both of our characters, leaving us with nobody to love or to hate.  I needed a definition with this film.  I wanted to root for one character and only one character.  By giving me passion for both I didn't really have any emotion towards the ending, which could have been quite dramatic.

I loved the music.

I loved the cinematography.

I loved that it promoted smoking.

I loved the characters - individually, but I needed a defined bad guy and a defined good guy.  Don't get me wrong, when Vader picks up the Emperor at the end of ""Jedi"", I felt sympathy for the bad guy - but think of what the film would have been like if the Emperor kissed Vader right before he fell.  That is the emotion happening with ""Beijing Bicycle"".

Could I watch this film again? Absolutely, but I could not sit still.  I would know what was going to happen with our characters, I would know what feelings I would have for both of them by the end, and I would still find myself apathetic to any of their causes.  One is strong, while the other is weak.  It was like black vs. gray instead of black vs. white.  I would call this film a ""Study of Cinema's Gray Zone"".

I will suggest this film to friends and family as a one time viewing.  It was a decent outing for a film about a bicycle, and would have no problems buying this DVD for my old Huffy that is still rotting away in the garage.  I think he would like it.

What are my thoughts?

I give this film an ""Ehhhhhhhhhggggggggggggggaaaaaaaaaaaaa"", as I feel weight on my shoulders as I thumb the edge of this DVD's box.",1173225600,2,2890,4.262476894639557
1715754,4,B000067IX5,How hard do we hold onto things that really matter to us? Is the bicycle a metaphor - or is this movie just a study in human stubbornness. You decide. Highly entertaining too.,1171497600,,175,4.333333333333333
1715755,5,B000067IX5,This is a wonderful story of a chinese migrant kid who moves from the village to Beijing to find a job and all the problems that come with it.

I recommend this movie for anyone who got attached to something they worked hard for and lost it through misfortune. I had my bike stole several times as a kid. Amazingly, my parents kept buying me another one but sometimes I had to wait awhile.

1715757,1,B000067IX5,"As opposed to films which invoke the viewer to question consciousness and worth based on their quality of film making and story, ""Bejing Bicycle"" is one of those pictures where the viewer is forced to find a deeper meaning 'within' because the movie is simply lacking plot, character, and integrity. If the director was trying to call upon the viewers empathy - this was another failure on his part linked to Bejing Bicycle. After the third time the bicycle is stolen - come on already - you start to watch the clock.

1715788,4,B000067IX5,"Yet another masterful drama from China, this is a story of poetic irony.

Guei, the son of a poor street merchant, moved with his father from the country to the city of Beijing, China's capital. Guei is hired by a delivery service that seems to make a habit of hiring uneducated country boys and is immediately assigned the task of studying the streets of Beijing to make deliveries. He is offered a bike to tackle the task and is promised to hold ownership over his wheels once he has earned 600 yuan.

For the first quarter of the movie you see this boy undergo the task of earning 600 yuan with much difficulty. It seems every delivery has its obstacles and challenges. Guei is estranged, far from what he is familiar with, and it is mostly his unworldly and nave disposition that gets him into trouble, with no fault of his own. And yet circumstance demands he gets punished for his mistakes. The director demonstrates again and again how everyone in the city is unsympathetic and indifferent toward Guei's ignorance.

But in the end, he finally makes his 600 yuan and is about to claim ownership over a possession other than his clothes: a Silver Mountain Bike. Unfortunately, it gets stolen during a final delivery and this is when the story really begins. The unknown thief pawns the bike and another boy, Jian, buys it with stolen money.

Meanwhile, Guei gets fired from his job and out of desperation, he makes a deal with his boss that if he were to somehow locate and reclaim the bike, he'd get his job back. So now Guei undertakes a mission of locating a bike in a city where bikes on the streets are as numerous as there are cars in New York City. And countless quarrels and violent encounters become inevitable between the two teenage boys once Guei discovers who has his well earned bike.

When Jian comes into the picture, you see the life of another boy who is so ashamed of his poor livings in the city that he delivers a sad display of denial whenever he leaves his home, by dressing in a coat and tie whenever he associates with his friends, forgetting for a few hours that his housing is no more than a tight, miserable hovel. And his new mountain bike only reinforces this fantasy of wealth he plays every time he is with his friends. He starts dating an upscale girl and his dream evolves.

But much like the story of Guei, everything slowly but surely falls apart for poor Jian. Guei takes his bike back from Jian. Jian's girl leaves him for a much better looking man. Jian's little fantasy world is shattered when his father shamefully reveals that he is a thief and the bike was bought with stolen money. And the loss of such small sentimental possessions brings each teenager to a breaking point and it is interesting to see how the two very different, yet similar boys handle the situation.

A story of irony. I am not sure exactly what it is trying to imply, if anything at all, but if I were to guess, I would guess that this story is about a city that is inhabited by people who dream of better lives which they can never have. Even a side character, a pretty young girl which always buys soy sauce from Guei's father has everyone convinced that she is rich and the owner of a big house she is always seen in, but with a sad expression. Later in the movie it is revealed that she was just the house keeper and she got fired for wearing her employer's expensive dresses, playing out a fantasy much like the social fantasy Jian played before his whole world came crashing down.

Either that, or the story is about a bike that has a curse on it because whoever touches the damn thing is overrun by the worse luck imaginable. Even the pretty girl that always bought soy sauce from Guei's father got touched by the bike when Guei was racing it home.

For China travelers and vacationers, this movie would really stimulate old nostalgia. You get great scenes and stills of the ancient city, both the modern and the old segments, like the Hutongs where the two boys dwell.",1153267200,2,3996,4.478021978021978

The dilemmas, conflicts, confrontations and choices the two main characters struggle through alone and together foreshadow the coming social upheaval the Chinese Coummunist Party leadership created with its One-Child policy: young males will outnumber young females by 60 million in 2020. The bicycle is a metaphor for economic opportunity and upward mobility in a ""classless"" society. No money, no wife. No wife, no children. No children, no future. Both Gue and Jian fight hard to keep what they believe is rightfully theirs,only perhaps to be outflanked by the third young man who is wealthier, more worldly and can afford leisure: he is the object of the young woman's affection near the story's end. The movie predicts a nothing-to-lose battle where the two young men join sides. What will happen in China if poor farmers, migrant constuction and factory workers and disafected students rise up as almost happened in 1989 Tiennamien?",1146009600,2,1094,5.257142857142857

Our plot surrounds the lives of two young boys. Living in China, the most practical mode of travel is by bicycle, and both boys, althought living in different societal environments, crave a good bike like American teens crave a good car. When one of the boys steals the other's bike, conflict quickly follows and we see the dire desperation fall on both the young men as they outwardly show an indomitable necessity to have ownership of the bicycle - something so trivial to most, but something that becomes the object of life and death for both of the boys.

""Look, she's wearing another dress,"" he then says, 30 seconds later.  ""You know her?"" his friend incredulously asks.  ""She comes for soy sauce all the time.""  ""A city girl"" (who sports 3 different outfits in under a minute and a half). "" A big pile of clothes. So wasteful!  Stop looking,"" say the shop-owner after his friend has taken his 3rd look).  ""It's not good for your health.""  Some days later, off camera we hear heels on the pavement as these two guys sit on the stoop of this guy's little shop.  We see only her shoes (and skirt of her dress) until she reaches the shop, not seeing her head to toe until she is almost out of camera shot returning from whence she came, bottle of soy sauce in hand.  It's just over an minute-long scene, but it's refreshingly free of any dialogue, and is marvelously effective; not to say intriguing.  Hollywood's book of filmmaking presupposes that a director must hook his/her viewers by no later than 10-12 minutes into a film if it is to resonate with viewers---something this film does with the above mentioned scene at just under the aforementioned 12 minute mark.  Then we follow this friend who can't imagine how some live so well, as he struggles in his job as a bicycle messenger...until he loses said bicycle, and thus his livelihood, which panics him.  Here is where the film works especially well, too.  Unlike in ""The Bicycle Thief"" (the famous Italian made film of some decades ago), we really feel for this hapless fellow & can understand how important a seemingly inconsequential bike really is to him.  Life's struggle really is apparent in Beijing Bicycle, but the film pushes its luck so that by the end of the film we are glad we don't have to concern ourselves with thoughts of this guy's bicycle anymore.  But the film is worthy of watching, nevertheless (especially to get a feel for the life led by many Chinese even now---I viewed this film and wrote this while in China myself, incidentially).  Interestingly too, the attractive woman from above makes two more appearances in this film in proximity to these two guys, but says not a word to either; nor they to her.  These scenes really bespeak the longing for a better life that the Chinese folks in this film struggle to make for themselves.  If you want to learn something about present-day China, and watch a better than average film, to boot, than give Beijing Bicycle a try.  Cheers!",1133740800,2,2543,4.648769574944072
1715793,3,B000067IX5,"This is a simple story of a country youth trying to survive in the new China with little more than determination and hard work.  At the end of the film you get the impression that Director Wang Xiaoshaui's verdict is that this is not nearly enough in a fast changing modern China and I'm not sure that he's incorrect.

The film itself is enjoying although the style is derivative.  The film has a quasi-documentary feel because of the lack of name actors recognizable to Western audience.  The denouement is unsatififying and leaves me wanting more in terms of resolution, although I do not normally consider such de reguer in a movie.

In the end, one can view the film as a snapshot of the modern youths of China if so inclined, as the director may have intended it to be.  But it lacks depth viewed in this context and the theme could have been developed with more subtlety and nuance.

1715794,5,B000067IX5,"this movie centers on the controversy over ownership of a bicycle

which both owners have paid for.  Guei--a poor country boy had legitimately paid for the bike out of his earnings as a courier--and just as he makes the last payment--the bike is stolen by a person who's never revealed--who then sells the bike to a used bicycle store where Jian puchases the same bicycle with money stolen from his father.  While Jian's claim seems phony--since he purchased stolen goods--he and his bully friends want to invalidate Guei's claim, by force if necessary.  Eventually a compromise is reached--the bicycle will be shared with each having possession on alternate days--a very unfair compromise-due to Guei's authentic claim and purchase as well as the fact that he actually needs the bicycle for his job-while Jian merely wants the bike to cruise with his friends and impress a girl.

This movie may sound banal in description-but it's actually very well done and quite entertaining.

Some reviewers seem to want to impose their own perceptions of propaganda into this story--but anyone who's ever known the poverty of Guei will understand his commitment to finding and keeping his bicycle--it's as simple as that!

An excellent movie--probably fine for all ages--but there is a brief nude scene with Guei--for those who find such things offensive (no frontal nudity!) and there is some violence-though relatively mild by current standards

1715795,4,B000067IX5,"Great stories are driven by conflict, and ""Beijing Bicycle"" presents a conflict both intense and enigmatic. Western viewers might find this movie's ending troublesome and unsatisfactory, but if you have any notion of Chinese culture and Asian thought, a few things come through quite strongly in this movie. And because of this Asian perspective, any comparison of ""Beijing Bicycle"" with Vittorio De Sicca's ""The Bicycle Thief"" is inappropriate. The culture of Rome post WWII (""The Bicycle Thief"") is quite different from today's Beijing.

Guei (Cui Lin) is a country boy come to the city of Beijing where he lands a job as a bicycle courier. He is given a bicycle and through a form of indentured servitude, he has the opportunity to own the bike after his employer collects 80 percent of his fees. After that, he owns the bike and he splits his fees with the company 50-50.

But Guei is naive in city ways, and finds himself treated rudely by a young clerk at a spa, who appears herself to possibly be a country transplant trying to make good in the city. When he manages to get out of this situation and return to his bike, he discovers it stolen.

Enter Jian (Lee Bing), a self-centered and relatively immature teen who has the hots for a girl and steals money from his parents to buy a bicycle so he can be with this bird. He hangs with a group of other self-absorbed teens, perhaps rendered indolent by their middle-class status. They attend a prep school and indulge in the latest Western fashions, as well as take glory in video games.

Guei tracks down his stolen bike and discovers that Jian has it. There is a protracted struggle (had this been dealt with more succinctly with more attention given to the relationship that developes between Jian and Guei, this movie might have warrented five stars) which leads to a compromise. Even though Guei lost the bike to theft, Jian bought it (with money stolen from his father) from a shop. This compromise works for the most part until Jian is overcome with jealousy when the girl he fancies opts for a slick youth with dyed hair and fashionable sunglasses. His assault on this other youth leads to a showdown in the alleys of Beijing where both Jian and Guei get the bejeesus knocked out of them and Gui's bicycle is destroyed. Yet Guei clings to his bicycle and carries the wreckage across Beijing, presumably to attempt repairing it so he can keep his job.

Confucianism is very strong in China, which is why perhaps that communism has continued there for so long. Guei is the good son who knows his role and is willingly to humbly fulfill it. Jian, on the other hand, is spoiled and self-indulgent. Everything he does centers on his self-interest. Even his giving up the bicycle after he realizes the girl he longs for (who is just as fickle and self-absorded as he is) has gone for another boy has no merit. He gives it up not because someone else (Guei) values it, but because it no longer has value for him. Is this movie a comment on the indolence of today's Chinese middle class? Or perhaps of all middle class sentimentalities that are so materially driven? Probably so. But if Guei is the good son, how come he gets the raw deal at the end?

This is where a Western mind might miss the message. Guei, like Jian, is also attached to something that is false: the bicycle. This is graphically portrayed with Guei clinging desperately to the bicycle as the others try to take it away from him. He is obsessed with the bicycle, and he pays for this obsession as well. But he doesn't give in like Jian has. Guei knows his heart, and he knows what he must do. Guei is not distracted for long by petty desires. Recall that Guei is obsessed briefly with the beautiful, yet enigmatic, rich girl. Yet she turns out to be a ruse as well, just a country girl who has fallen for the false allure of wealth. With that glimpse, Guei sees what can happen to him.

This movie is beautifully complex and compelling. It's one drawback is the mid-section, which dwells too long on the conflict of the bicycle and avoids the richer territory of what makes Jian and Guei compromise.",1122163200,,4125,4.58130081300813
1715796,5,B000067IX5,"I identified strongly with the struggle of the two teenagers, which took the concrete form of fighting over the bicycle.  There was one scene in which the middle class boy and his gang struggled to wrest the bicycle from the peasant boy's grip, but after hours of struggle, they were unable to.  Somehow it was understood that they would not kill the boy and so the peasant boy hung on to it by sheer grit and determination, which as portrayed seemed almost superhuman.

Somehow, knowing the Chinese (communist) mentality to a degree, I knew there had to be a strong underlying message, and sure enough, it came through to me that was this---- that peasant strength was more than equal to the more effete efforts of the middle class, the bourgeoisie.  The message went beyond the ideological, but was also strongly socio-economic and psychological; the peasant boy's motivation for advancement, opportunity and freedom from poverty, was stronger than the middle class boy's motivation, merely to have a bicycle with which to impress his girlfriend and keep up with his peers.

The middle class boy was shown to be a liar and a thief, disrespectful of his hardworking father.  His rage was somehow understandable as his sibling, a younger sister, was seen as getting more advantage in schooling.  The father promised the son a bicycle, but instead spent the money on a private school for the girl.  That was a typical middle class family conflict, not as serious or severe as the peasant boy's drive to escape poverty.  The bicycle was his key to financial independence, while for the middle class boy, he stole the bike and lied about it, a moral weakness which came from his 'easy' life and relative indulgence.

Another political message came through subliminally, that the middle class boy didn't deserve the bike because he was morally corrupt.  It is as if being middle class automatically makes a person morally corrupt, and yet his rage was equal to that of the peasant boy, who felt cheated. robbed and denied a chance to escape poverty.

The peasant boy's morality was shown to be on a higher plane, as he finally consented to use the bike on alternate days.  That was the compromise which came from the near-death battle in the streets, one peasant boy against a multitude of middle class boys.  There seemed to be a peace and accord for a time, but toward the end, the middle class boy wanted the bike all to himself and fought almost to the death for it.

Finally the two boys were both bloody and beaten, the bicycle bent and broken, but the peasant boy limped back to work with the frame, as if to repair it and own it at all costs.  It ended almost as if the message was that the human condition cannot be overcome, that there will be endless competition, struggle and suffering, as long as there are haves and have-nots.

I found the struggle emotionally gripping on many levels, the truths piercing and vital, so I cannot understand how it was that so many critics were unmoved.",1094860800,9,2995,4.717850287907869
1715797,3,B000067IX5,"The movie began tragic and ended, not an inch more so, tragic. Basically, it is two hours of bad things happening to good people, not through a series of mischance, but simply because their lives are terrible and there's no possible way to get around it. The film was downright depressing with nothing of a therapeutic or cathartic effect. I say that because the characters go through no emotional development, or physical development for that matter, so that at the closing of the movie, you feel as if nothing has happened. Also, none of the characters are really likeable, and you can hardly summon up enough feeling to call it compassion. [I should also note right now that all the characters are male, save two females we only see at the corners of the still story and the still camera-just hardly there, beautiful and unattainable.]

But unlike most movies I've been watching on my dear IFC (which has run out of real independent films and are resorting to old Jennifer Lopez movies), this one is memorable. I say this because I know I will remember the details of Beijing Bicycle at age 72, when I very well will have forgotten the names of my very own grandchildren.

Alright, I just read some reviews of this film, reviews by non-asiatic, non-thirdworld people, probably the same people who guffawed in the most un-funny (pardon, no SAT vocab seems to come to mind) parts of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, an altogether very un-funny movie. Ah, here's one: The story is about the incredible struggle for human dignity in the face of inhumanizing poverty. Mmm. Right. I would say that poverty is what makes us most human, and the comfy cushions we're living on right now make us damn near godly. An eminent critic awarded this film with the words ""emotionally satisfying""-I interpret this as his way of saying it is excruciatingly painful to watch, being that pain can too be an emotion, and in that case, I can't disagree. Next: ""there is no needless dialogue"" meaning there is basically no dialogue-a few monologues here a few grunts there, all the while the camera never moves... sounding a bit like Zhang Yi Mou's work, no? But ha! It's not! The producer's name is actually Wang Xiao Shuai, which translates to Wang Little Hottie.

The acting is glorious, by the way.

Watching this film was analogous to watching The Passion, refreshing in a way that continually dangling your heart on a thinning string can be-which is definitely an experience worth having. so, if you see it in blockbuster, by all means, go for it.",1092787200,,2530,4.75626423690205
1715848,4,B000067IX5,"This film was about a boy from the country coming to the city and landing a really good job as a bicycle messenger. He gets a really cool bike to use and finds out they will take money out of his earnings to pay the bike off and make it his. This bike symbolizes so much to this youth, it is his ticket out, his chance to make something of himself. The bike is a status symbol, not just to him, but to all kids his age, therefore making it valuable and worth taking. Thats exactly what happens, the bike gets stolen. Because the owner marked it with a personalized scratch, he feels he can find it somehow in this large city of bikes. His boss doubts him and fires him with the promise that he will hire him back if he finds it, this is done in a real sarcastic way without any compassion. The story continues on with his search, retrieval, combative takeover and negotiation, all in that order. It sounds somewhat boring but the emotional scenes add a punch to this movie. There is not alot of needless dialog and we experience the film more with the visual images and the good acting of the two main characters, both boys. I really liked this film. I would like to go to this city and experience it fully. The rhythm of the film moves along just like a bike moving down a meandering road. Worthwhile viewing.

It's not your usual movie fare and any reveiwer that says they've been to this bustling city that wakens slowly every morning and could not idently with our main characters plight, don't know what they are talking about ....

1715850,1,B000067IX5,"As a person who is married to a Chinese, visited Beijing twice, and have seen mostly excellent Chinese films in the limited selection of non-Hong-Kong stuff available on DVD, this was a shock for us.  The first few minutes of the film are passable, introducing the main characters, and providing a few nice glimpses of Beijing as lived by poor migrants versus (apparently) richer folk.  After this, things go downhill fast. A good summary: a bicycle is stolen back and forth, and there's an escalating series of fights.  By the last hour, the movie is reduced to gang fights and various people hitting each other with bricks and rocks.  Nothing of any consequence really happens in the last hour; there's no character development, no romantic development (despite some hope of this early on) beyond truly high-school-movie-level stuff, and you just want this thing to be OVER!
So, do yourself a favor.  There's great Chinese films out there...""Shower"" is a truly brilliant and poignant film of modern Chinese life, check out ""The Road Home"" for a different, rural look back.  Even going to Panda Express is better than this.  Or, if you even wanna see well-done versions of people beating on each other, get ""The Warriors"" or ""Scarface"" or something.  This is a major disappointment (though I might've give it 2 stars if not for the excessive length).",1082505600,2,1351,4.920704845814978
1715851,4,B000067IX5,"OK, let's see if I can get this straight...This guy comes in from the countryside to get a job in the big city (Beijing, of course).  He gets a job as a courier.  It is a dream job, because they give him a brand new bicycle the first day, and all he has to do is work really hard to pay it off.  He is very happy about being paid to ride a bike around Beijing all day.
Well, he finally gets the bike paid off, but it gets stolen.  Then he gets fired because he failed to deliver an important document and the customer is angry.  His boss is very upset with him, but tells him that he can have his job back if he finds his bike.  So he becomes obsessed with finding his bike, especially since he has paid it off, and the bike belongs to him.  By a stroke of fortune he finds the bike at a park.  He grabs it and takes off.  But the new owner, a city kid, is not happy to see it go.  At first, our sympathies are clearly with the country kid, because who would take the side of a thief over a pour kid from the country who is just trying to make a living?  But the thief didn't actually steal the bike, so he isn't really a thief.  Except he actually is a thief because he took the money with which to buy the bike.  Except he doesn't think of himself as a thief, because, well, its kinda complicated-you have to watch the movie..
So what happens is that the city kid's friends all gang up on the country kid, and they kinda have it out in what looks like the shell of an abandoned construction project.  But the city kid and his friends are not able to take the country kid's bike away, `cause he is holding on to it for all he is worth and crying real loud.  Finally they agree to take turns using it.  The city kid and the country kid actually become friends, and that would seem to be the logical end of the movie, but it's not, because the city kid bonks this other gang kid on the head with a brick because he took his girlfriend.  So the gang kid retaliates and the country kid gets caught in the tangle.  Lots of twists and turns in this flick...oh, I forgot about the neighbor lady who is obviously a high-society city lady, but actually turns out not to be...hmmm...not too sure how she fits into the picture.  I guess she is kind of a symbol for what is going on between the two main characters.  The plot-especially the end-leaves a little to be desired, but it does give one a feel for life among the youth in China who are coming of age in a society addicted to change.  And if you think of it as an all-expense-paid guided tour of Beijing, it really isn't a bad movie.",1052438400,,2581,4.061264822134388

In the back of my mind, I said to myself you wanted to bulid upon your Asian cinema collection here is a movie to do so. I was not disappointed at all. It reminds me how close yet so far. The determination of this guy to recover his bicycle was funny and truly amazing. The student was a selfish guy who purchased the bike from the black market. He stole money from his parents because of a promise, sometimes parents can not always follow up on good intentions. The scene where the student and his(school boy thugs) er I mean classmates. These young boys had the moxies to try and negotiate someone else's property cracked me up. Neither one was willing for the other to have the bike. An agreement to share the bike was made. Near the end the alley scene is worth a few << on the dvd or vcr. Let's say it's jaw dropping, what desperation will make you do. Let's just say the brother had no choice.

Both films tell the story of their protagonists' struggled path, but this particular film, at the end, does not bear a sweet fruit.

1715854,4,B000067IX5,"Who would have thought that a bicycle become the star of this show?  For mainland Chinese, bicycle is something that they can't live without.  This movie was made in Beijing and it explored the uneasy relationships between the city people and out-of-towners who are going there for better job prospects and thus, better life.  The story revolved around this country boy who secured a job as a courier boy and he was presented with a state-of-the-art bicycle which meant to facilitate him in his job and to portray the image of his company.  He meant to work to a certain level to pay off his bike and when he was on the verge of doing so, his bike got stolen and naturally, he lost his job.  Due to his determination and stubborness, the boss agreed that should he manage to find the bike back, he would get his job in return.  Then, we were introduced to yet another character, the person who was using his bike.  Did he actually steal his bike or did he buy the bike from vendor who stole it?  Along the way, we got to catch a glimpse of the alleyway lifestyle called ""hutong"" and how the downtrodden lived their lifestyle.  Both of them loved the same bike wholeheartedly.  One needed it because it's his livelihood & the other person wanted it for his lifestyle.  Can you imagine what would happen when both of their lives collided?  Sparks and fireworks ensued, and the ending was a spectacular climax with quite an explosive ending.  Furthermore, there were other subplots which displayed of us the mentality of people from different social stratas, and attitudes of mainland Chinese when push comes to shove.  Personally, this movie is akin to a symphony or poetry in motion.  It might be slow for some but their very reason of disliking it is the very reason of me liking it.
