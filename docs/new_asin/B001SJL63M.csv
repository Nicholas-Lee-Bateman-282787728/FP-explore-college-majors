8339908,5,B001SJL63M,"Great movie.  Sadly, not pressed, or burned on M-DISC.

I completely understand that obscure movies like this may not economically justify pressing a disc.  However, I would have gladly paid a dollar or two more for a disc that would last forever.  Instead, they burned the movie on the old-fashioned, purple dye type disc that are only good for around 5 - 7 years. M-Disc last 100s of years.

This review is for the actual item I received from Amazon. If you are after a, ""pure movie review"", I suggest you look at the International Movie Database. There you will find many reviews without regard to the delivery mechanism.

This is a Great Movie.  The image quality is excellent. Humorous and well acted.  Lots of the the extras on the DVD.",1515974400,,742,4.6106870229007635
8339909,4,B001SJL63M,"LIVING ON LOVE is one of the six ""lost RKO films"" from the 1930s that were kept in custody of producer/director Merian C. Cooper until Turner Classic Movies snagged the rights and subsequently aired them on April, 2007. LIVING ON LOVE (1937) is a goofy romantic comedy that reconstructs the plot of RAFTER ROMANCE (1933). I do think that RAFTER ROMANCE plays as more watchable on the strength of Ginger Rogers' superior performance over Whitney Bourne's and the original film's more saucy sensibilities. By the time the remake came around, the Hays Code was in place and so dictated that LIVING ON LOVE not be as freewheeling, be more pedestrian.

Blame that tricked-out radio, I guess. The busybody landlord (Solly Ward) of the Venus de Milo Arms boarding house is keen to keep up payments lest his beloved radio be taken away. But what to do with the Russian acrobats who'd already paid up for a month, except that there's no room reserved for them? And what to do about two other tenants who lag months behind on rent? The landlord arrives at an unseemly (for its time) arrangement. Never mind that he sweetens the pot by lowering the rent to $15 a month, he forces the two delinquent tenants to take turns inhabiting the basement apartment in 12-hour shifts, from 8 to 8 with 15 minutes of leeway either way. Wholesome New England girl Mary Wilson (Whitney Bourne) works during the day as salesgirl to the Aladdin Electric Shaver Corp. Grouchy starving artist Gary Martin (James Dunn) toils away at night. Mary and Gary have never met face to face, and this plot conceit then allows for a series of comic misunderstandings and mistaken identities. Tempers flare. The roommates in absentia get on each other's nerves and communicate solely by way of these nasty notes. And, of course, coincidence rears up and they strike up an acquaintance at the local diner and fall in love but without the one knowing that the other is, in fact, their sworn nemesis.

To lump in further conflict, Mary and Gary must fend off their respective unwelcome suitors - she, her boss on the prowl, the mannered Ogilvie O. Oglethorpe (Franklin Pangborn); he, the comely but pushy sausage heiress (Joan Woodbury).

James Dunn and Whitney Bourne have okay chemistry; these two together aren't about to incite hearts to a-fluttering. I don't know too much about Ms. Bourne - she wasn't in a lot of movies - other than she's really pretty and her acting's passable. James Dunn, as the romantic male lead, frankly lacks the build and the looks and the charisma. His particular talents render him a better fit as a character actor. I did like the scene in which he demonstrates the artistry of the dunk. He made Red Skelton proud.

3 or 3.5 out of 5 stars for LIVING ON LOVE. Maybe I still foster a juvenial streak because what I enjoyed most were the pranks that kept on escalating. If you're pining for the frothy, sophisticated brand of humor normally associated with Cary Grant and Myrna Loy, you'd best move on. Levity here translates to unsuspected lobsters in bed, wayward alarm clocks, and a parade of exotic animals stymieing the artist's slumber. It makes for a raucous battle of the sexes. My favorite act of meanness may well be the salesgirl's hawking the artist's wares out on the sidewalk (without his permission, natch), her crude sign touting him as ""the world's worst artist"" and her pricing his ""masterpieces"" at 38 cents. The topper to that scene is that kid eyeing one such painting: ""Mom, can I buy this one? I can use the canvas for my sailboat."" Ha! So, yeah, this movie got some good belly laughs out of me, but, man, if I were those roommates, I swear the aggravation isn't worth the lowered rent of $15 a month.",1468281600,,3713,4.698924731182796
8339910,5,B001SJL63M,Remake of Rafter Romance that is equally as well done in my opinion... I adore James Dunn who starred in many Shirley Temple vehicles as well as 1945 version of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.,1429833600,,186,4.3428571428571425
8339911,3,B001SJL63M,"This romantic comedy is a remake of the Ginger Rogers film from 1933,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rafter-Romance/dp/B001SJPLE2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rafter Romance</a>. Gary (James Dunn), a struggling artist, and Mary (Whitney Bourne), a broke sales clerk, are railroaded by their pushy landlord into sharing a basement apartment in 12-hour shifts. Rather than resenting their mutual enemy, the landlord, they choose to despise each other. They never run into each other at the apartment, but they both get irritated at the way the other uses the shared space, and they get even by playing mean-spirited tricks on each other. For example, Mary substitutes paint thinner for Gary's mouthwash, and he plants a lobster in her bed.

Outside the apartment, Gary and Mary meet at a neighborhood restaurant, begin seeing each other, and fall in love. But complications arise from the unwanted romantic attentions of a sausage heiress toward Gary, and from the sexual harassment of Mary's boss--and of course the fact that neither suspects that their worst enemy is also the person they love.

Fans of Hattie McDaniel may find it of interest to see her sister, Etta McDaniel, in this film. She plays the part of the landlord's maid. This movie has plenty of Yiddish jokes, as did the first version, some of which may be offensive to modern sensibilities, and there is more emphasis on slapstick humor than in Rafter Romance.

This movie is one of six RKO films presumed lost for many years--another is Rafter Romance. Turner Classic Movies acquired the rights to these films in 2006 and first showed them in April, 2007.

Overall, this story has a clever premise, and if I had not seen it so soon after viewing Rafter Romance, I might have liked it more than I did. Unfortunately, it suffers greatly in comparison. The actors aren't as good, and the chemistry between the two principals is almost nil. I'm also not a huge fan of slapstick, and all the humor in this movie comes from that source. If you only have time to watch one movie from the 30's with this premise, I recommend Rafter Romance over this one. If you have time or money to try both, however, watch them and compare and see for yourself which you prefer.

I'm betting it will be the version with Ginger Rogers.",1284854400,4,2321,5.049608355091384
