2072897,5,B0002A2VXM,"Another of Horton Foote's stories, beautifully adapted to the screen and the second  of his stories following a young family just after the turn on the century. Beautifully acted and most engaging.",1231200000,,197,5.15625
2072898,5,B0002A2VXM,"It takes a certain sensibility to enjoy the small but hardly insignificant pleasures of a Horton Foote story. Like Chekhov before him, he brings together a group of fully-drawn characters with hopes, aspirations, disappointment and sorrows and provides us with a glimpse into their interconnected lives. Set in the years before WWI, in a small Texas town not far from the Gulf, this story centers around a young married couple expecting their first baby as the bride's parents come to terms with her marriage - an elopement with a young storekeeper they regard as below her station. Also figuring in the story are an alcoholic boarder in their rooming house, a simple-minded friend of the young bride, and a relative who seems to be losing his mind and mysteriously comes and goes, handing out money.

The first half of the story takes place on Christmas and the second half on Easter, the two chief holidays of the Christian liturgical calendar. The Valentine's Day of the title, which comes between them, is the couple's first anniversary. Together, they represent the cycle of birth, love, and death that seems always at the background of whatever story Foote has to tell. A small-scale film, structured in the style of a stage play, ""On Valentine's Day"" has wonderful performances and evokes a place and time long lost in the American past.",1213488000,15,1344,4.920704845814978
2072899,5,B0002A2VXM,"Horton Foote is a playwright and screenwriter of the gentlest, most powerful kind. His beginnings in small town Texas has informed most all of his writing ever since. He has written for broadway, live television and hollywood. He wrote the amazing screenplay for ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" based on Harper Lee's book. He wrote the films ""Tender Mercies"" and ""Trip to Bountiful"" (based on his play) He's won the Pultzer Prize for his play ""Young Man From Atlanta"" (1995). Many of his plays have ended up on video/dvd and ""On Valentine's"" is one of them. It was first shown on PBS.

There is a series of plays written by Mr. Foote called ""The Orphan's Home Cycle"". Nine terrific plays, gentle and rewarding individually...put them together and you have a gorgeous epic that spans decades. The plays follow a boy named Horace from childhood to adulthood.

The middle three plays of this cycle are: ""Courtship"", ""Valentine's Day"" and ""1918"" and are all on DVD and available on Amazon.

""On Valentine's Day"" picks up two years after ""Courtship"" and takes place in a small town Texas rooming house where Horace and Elizabeth live as man and wife.  A baby is on the way and it's Christmas Eve. There's been a divide between Elizabeth and her family because of who Elizabeth decided to marry and this play is about the reunion of the spirits and the love of a family as it comes back together. (Made all the more poignent because Horace is an ""orphan"" and is counting on Elizabeth to be her family.)

Other residents of the rooming house give a view of the world around them and the delicate script gives a profound and addicting take on life and what makes up love, family and security.

 ""On Valentine's Day"" stands alone as an amazing timepiece. Put the film together with the previous chapter, ""Courtship"" and then the next chapter: ""1918"" and you have an amazing statement of life in small town America from 1915 to World War I. You have a dramatic poem about love and endurance. You also have an important document of Amercan theater by having a record of this great playwright's work come to life.

The same wonderful cast is in all three films, offering great continuity of performance and sparse, tender storytelling.

2072900,5,B0002A2VXM,"Horton Foote's trilogy was produced for PBS years ago. It was called ""The Story of a Marriage."" The first in the series has now been released as ""Courtship,"" the second is on ""Valentine's Day"",  and the last is ""1918"".  Horton Foote who is one of America's greatest writers paints a wonderfully accurate portrait of the slow pace of Texas life in the early part of the 20th century. What might seem slow pacing to those used to action-packed drama, is really Foote's beautifully sparce but meaningful language. This was a time when gentility mattered above all else. As was the case in small southern towns, the odd and eccentric were protected and cared for by the town, while hopefully kept out of sight. Foote embraces  the damaged and the frail,  weaving their lives along with those of the main characters, to portray a quiet tale of compassion, love and strength of character. The characters will stay with you forever.",1119225600,72,925,4.79874213836478
2072901,5,B0002A2VXM,"This is the second movie in a projected series based on the plays of Horton Foote. (""1918"" was the first.) This time the year is 1917, the place still rural Texas, and it's a slice-of-life look at a single family in their day-to-day trials and tribulations, which include drunkeness, insanity, and financial struggles. It can be slow at times, but like ""1918"" it's always absorbing and very realistic. Worth seeing.",1112054400,8,415,4.942857142857143

This is part of a trilogy in which all 3 films are excellant (""1918""gives us a good 'picture'of the era when life as known then began to change into what we have today with it's own attendant ""woes""), but for my money, which was not unreasonable, (though a bit steep, when acquiring all 3 films), the middle film of the 3,""On Valentines Day""goes right up near the top of my all time bests. I only put the A&E version of ""Pride&Predjudice""above it, but then I feel it is the best movie made of any era,""Valentines Day""crowds it though! I keep two copies of ""Valentins Day"" on hand so if the one goes I won't be without, it's that valuable, can bring you right out of ""the mean red's, as ""Miss Holly Golightly says, but then that's another (right near the top of my list) film and we were discussing Horton, here, who rarely dissapoints.

The characters were fairly likable, but the plot was just tedious and the staging was obviously a film of a stageplay..  perhaps some like that, but why not take more advantage of cinematic freedom of movement?",1426723200,,439,4.662337662337662

This play/film, like those mentioned, celebrates our capacity to love and tolerate the whole person--every character is fully developed instead of stereotyped.

Foote's central characters, newlyweds Horace and Elizabeth Robideaux, are acted with what might be termed ""British"" sensitivity (high praise!), and even his subsidiary characters are fascinating -- particularly Uncle George and Cousin Bobby. Though leisurely (some might say ""stagy"") in director Ken Harrison's affectionate realization, ""On Valentine's Day"" remains a gripping narrative.

2072971,3,B0002A2VXM,"With Matthew Broderick on the cover and with the other reviews I had read, I was really expecting something different here.  In fact the part Mathew Broderick plays is quite minor.  The story shows a sweet, growing relationship between a young husband and wife as they experience the last few months of their first year together.  I was never sure where the story was going, as it seemed to be moving from one story line to what seemed just a vignette.  Eventually the scenes intertwine, but there is no ending or any kind of closure to the main situations.  I look forward to seeing both the first and third of this series (I didn't want to afford the first one, which was quite a bit more expensive) just to see if there is some resolution to the story.  The style reminds me slightly of stories by Elizabeth Gaskell.  No flash or grabbing story, but a ""day in the life of"" kind of feel to it.  I enjoy character studies, so I don't mind the quieter stories.  But I didn't get a lot of depth to any of the characters to study.  I wanted a deeper look into these characters, especially since there was not a lot of action.  I'm not highly recommeding this, but will withhold further judgement until I've seen the other parts of this series.",1244332800,11,1241,4.422907488986784

8024883,2,B0002A2VXM,"If you need something to help with your insomnia, this is the movie for you! I usually adore period dramas but this was such a disappointment. I found my eyes wandering to the wonderful antiques in the room, rather than the faces of the actors because the furniture was often less wooden than the acting. It's really disappointing because I feel like this could have been an excellent film in the hands of a better director and screenplay writer.",1464825600,,446,4.658227848101266

8024885,4,B0002A2VXM,"This is a very absorbing story for the right viewer.  Its basically a story of family and and many of the somehow familiar struggles that they deal with in daily existence.  Nothing over the top!  Really more about situations that are probably familiar to many who will watch this film.  I think the simplistic portrayal of two generations is presented in such a way that many will identify with different aspects of it.  Its not light hearted however, and in some way it reminded me a little of A Long Day's Journey.... its apparently a true story and no doubt that is why it seems so real.  If we could or would, I think many people could write their own version of such a story!",1464220800,3,681,4.408
