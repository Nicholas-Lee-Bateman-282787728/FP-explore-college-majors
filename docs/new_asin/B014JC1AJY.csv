8730980,5,B014JC1AJY,"I was worried this movie would be too dark, but it was not. It is sad how the Orthodox in Israel have treated the Russian immigrants. In the end, we are all Jews. You have a people (Russians with Jewish Father or Grandparents) and they are brought to Israel as Jews, beat up in Russia for being Jews, and in the end of their arrival to Israel told- ""You're not Jewish"".  It's a shame we spend all our time trying to tear each other down. In this movie, it shows some of the prejudices Russians faced in Israel. It also shows the crime some Russians brought to Israel with them, but in the end it takes one person to believe in you to change you and your whole world.",1497398400,,666,4.162790697674419
