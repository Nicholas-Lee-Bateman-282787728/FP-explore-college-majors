2644671,3,B000HWZ4ES,"Didn't like the fact that Teahouse of the August moon portrayed the Japanese as uncivilized people...particularly Brando's character perpetuated this idea and it was not amusing.

the other dvds were ok",1163289600,5,202,5.516129032258065
2644672,5,B000HWZ4ES,"It isn't merely his brilliant acting and physical beauty, but that extra quality people in show business call ""stage presence."" Only 2 of these titles (JULIUS CAESAR and TEAHOUSE) are among the very best of his 38 major films, but all 5 are ample proof--if proof is needed--that Marlon Brando is one of our most enduring stars.

JULIUS CAESAR: Shakespeare gets the fancy Hollywood treatment, with a young Brando heading an impressive cast, and he more than holds his own with the likes of James Mason, John Gielgud, and Deborah Kerr. His Marc Antony is a fascinating interpretation.

THE TEAHOUSE OF THE AUGUST MOON: In this film of John Patrick's Pulitzer Prize-winning play, Brando is the sly Japanese(!) interpreter for a group of Americans in postwar Okinawa. He wouldn't be cast in the part today (they'd find an appropriate Asian actor), but it remains one of his best comic performances.

MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY: A solid remake of the classic, not as good as the original and way too long, but worth a look for Brando's complex portrait of Fletcher Christian. And the cinematography is stunning.

REFLECTIONS IN A GOLDEN EYE: Perhaps his most offbeat role, as a repressed homosexual Army officer who prefers (nude) Robert Forster to (nude) Elizabeth Taylor. John Huston's film of Carson McCullers's novel is certainly--umm--naked, a kinky but interesting oddity.

THE FORMULA: Brando only has a couple of scenes in this film version of Steve Shagan's bestselling thriller (George C. Scott and Marthe Keller are the actual leads), but it's awesome to watch him and Scott locking horns. Nobody could play a charming villain as well as Brando (see THE GODFATHER), and the subject of this film (the formula of the title) is surprisingly timely.

So, you decide which are your favorite Brando films, but these 5 are all interesting examples of his work.",1162771200,35,1853,4.980582524271845
2644673,5,B000HWZ4ES,"Glad to see this box set released; none have been previously available on DVD.  Brando still has a number of movies that are unavailable:  Viva Zapata!, Desiree, One-Eyed Jacks, Bedtime Story, The Nightcomers, Christopher Columbus-The Discovery and The Brave.  Hopefully these will be coming out in the future. Brando is the greatest actor of all time and redefined the art.  His work should be available.  Thank you Warner Home Video for this release!",1161734400,4,452,5.136986301369863

Having said that they are all films of most exelent quality and content. My favorites are Mutiny on the Bounty where  Brando and Trevor Howard cannot be asked to be better actors.  This same movie is more than spectacular filled with beauty, exquisite scenes and superb acting. its a 5 star +++ movie. Tea House of the August Moon... the other is a side of Brando no too commonly seen, a happy comedic actor who interprets an okinawan transalator who gets his way with the newly ocupation army just after WWII.

2644900,5,B000HWZ4ES,"Because Marlon Brando all but dropped out of movie-making during the last 10 or 12 years of his life (except for Apocalypse Now, where his role was drastically reduced because he weighed more than 300 pounds, and was deemed by the director to be unfit for a major role), many movie goers no longer remember how talented and accomplished Brando was at his best.  I had seen all of the Brando films that are included in this package, but wanted to have them available to re-view at convenient times.  To date the only one I've seen from the package I bought is ""Mutiny on the Bounty"".  But it's a masterpiece.

2644904,5,B000HWZ4ES,"Believe it or not, I had not seen ALL of the movies in this collection ... ever.

Suffice it to say, each of the movies in this collection is a classic ... and in my more senior years, I REALLY ""get it"". For example, like virtually ALL educated Americans, I had to read William Shakespeare's ""Julius Caesar"" first in high school, then again in college ... and, never mind the strange ancient English, I had no idea about the true meanings of deviousness, treachery, betrayal, and tragedy. Indeed, the familiar funeral oration over Caesar's murdered corpse, where Mark Antony sways the easily manipulated Roman crowd ... a Marlon Brando classic ... was amazing. Indeed, in a special feature commentary by actors such an aging Dennis Hopper it is explained how Brando in that one scene changed Hollywood acting forever.

I could gush about each of the other movies in this collection, but for the price you cannot beat the quality and quantity of entertainment. Also the quality of the DVD sound and images are crisp, evidently having been made from digitally well restored prints.",1347840000,8,1079,4.858695652173913

2644950,3,B000HWZ4ES,"The time is late 1948 and the setting is a U.S. Army post in Georgia, bordering on a forest preserve...

A Southern amoral wife called Leonora (Elizabeth Taylor) finds a way for her stream desire in an adulterous affair with Lt. Col. Langdon (Brian Keith), carried on almost openly...

Leonora gives aperture to her forcefulness and vigor in a passion for horses and riding... She is attached to a handsome white horse she calls Firebird and she provokes her husband by telling him that the animal is indeed a stallion with the emotional nature of man...

Leonora's husband (Marlon Brando) is a devious, insecure, impotent Army major, a hidden homosexual preoccupied with an unsociable, lonely rider who canters around the field in the nude and whose sexual emotional stress is diminished, secretively, at the bedside of the major's wife holding her clothes and looking fixedly at her marvelous hot body...

Private Williams (Robert Forster) is another lonely man fascinated by the fiery Leonora and her thoughtful and gentle comments to him... He takes to visiting the Penderton house at night looking attentively in the windows, observing with total recall and complete joy Leonora's nakedness, but also watching the Major in his study...

Keith's neurotic wife (Julie Harris) is well aware of her husband's affair with Leonora but she only feels well from her close friendship with her houseboy, Anacleto (Zorro David), an affected companion who shares her penchant for the arts and is in every way the opposite of her abrupt, strong husband...

Flavored with bitter insinuations and insulting sarcasms, Brando and Taylor's few scenes have enough flames to burn the silver screen... He's a tormented human being while she's delicious but shrill and insensitive... Aware of her physical beauty she fights back when she's rejected, instigating him with her impudent, insolent, shameless manner that offend his very being...",1231632000,4,1924,5.210355987055016

2644953,4,B000HWZ4ES,"""Mutiny on the Bounty,"" though noted for Brando's controversial interpretation of the Fletcher Christian role, has to be one of the best-looking, best scored, and most exciting historical dramas ever filmed. Brando's acting is fine, even with the foppish demeanor, and he is matched by the equally good Trevor Howard as the domineering Captain Bligh, Richard Harris, Hugh Griffith, and Percy Herbert as respective crewman. Polynesian actress, Tarita, is exquisite as the native girl smitten by Christian and veteran Frank Silvera is also on hand in the many of his ""ethnic"" roles as a Tahitian interpreter.

The extras on the disc are short and interesting for the film buff and the casual fan.

Brando gets to show that he can do Shakespeare with the best of 'em as he tackles the role of Mark Antony in ""Julius Caesar."" His delivery of the legendary soliloquy is stunning, showing the power that this man had in his youth. The film also benefits from a superlative main cast, including James Mason, Greer Garson, Deborah Kerr, Edmond O'Brien, and Sir John Gielgud, as well as able support from a gallery of familiar character actors (John Hoyt, John Doucette, George Macready, and Alan Napier). Miklos Rozsa supplies a magnificent score, foreshadowing his Oscar-winning music for ""Ben-Hur,"" a few years away.

""Reflections in a Golden Eye"" is a strange film and Brando's southern ""accent"" is a bit forced and the story itself is not interesting enough to warrant repeat viewing.

""The Formula"" is a thriller that doesn't. Even the scenes between Oscar-winners Brando and Scott don't spark any flames.

And ""Teahouse of the August Moon"" is an embarrassment to all parties concerned, languishing in a swamp of stereotypes.",1172361600,4,1722,5.092198581560283
2644954,3,B000HWZ4ES,"I purchased the set for Reflections, Mutiny, and Caesar so I am not disappointed. However Teahouse is an

unwatchable embarrassment. It may have worked on stage, however on film it is torture, and Brando as an Asian is beyond the limits of credulity. Abysmal was a capital A.",1171584000,4,275,4.729166666666667
2644955,5,B000HWZ4ES,"""The Marlon Brando"" collection is quite easily one of the best collections

to come out recently (and there have been many).  We all have our favorites, and I have mine.  I would buy this just to get ""Teahouse of

the August Moon"" and ""Julius Ceasar"".  And, ""Teahouse"" is far and away my

favorite.  Mr Brando plays an interpreter on Okinawa, working for the US

Army...along with a fantastic supporting cast.  Every one of these films

is worthy and shows the range of Mr. Brando's abilities.  I would say ""You

Can't Go Wrong"".  Then, you might want to add ""Sayonnara""...which is lavish, dated, and sad...but well worth watching...and it will round

out your collection.  I am a big fan of the ""Teahouse of the August Moon""

and ""Guys and Dolls"" Brando...and I tend to keep quite a distance from

""The Wild One"" Brando.  I would add that whatever your tastes, Mr Brando probably has something of interest to share with you, so go for it.",1171497600,12,939,4.621951219512195

Altough thes are not Brando at his very best, they are most important in showing the wide range of roles he could play. The whole set is very well presented and I would recommend the set, not just to Brando completists, but also to those who only know him from his more famous roles, The Godfather, On the Waterfront. The man will be sorely missed and this set goes a long way to showing what a great actor he was. There are not many 'film stars' around today who could hold a candle to him.

A must for film collectors and admirers of Huston as a director. The color treatment adds immeasurably  to the  power of the narrative and lends a hypnotic and dreamlike edge to this disturbing and provocative film. Get it.
