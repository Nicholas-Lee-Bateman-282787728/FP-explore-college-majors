2261931,2,B00092ZMH0,This is a must for everyone and for all ages. Hilarious and very down to earth comedy. Just seeing Ted Knight will make you laugh and his actions will tickle every part of you. Great stuff and I highly recommend it. Unfortunately there are only 2 seasons and wish there were more. Too Close for comfort is the most satisfying comedy series you will ever find.,1170720000,4,359,4.454545454545454
2261932,5,B00092ZMH0,"Too close for comfort is a very enjoyable sitcom that overflows with 80's charm and innocence! The first two seasons had a few duds and the series did have some severe growing pains before it reached its stride, but the ride is worth taking! Once the actors settle into their roles and the writers begin to ""get with it"" the series finally begins to shine as brightly as the first episode from season 1 had promised!

The characters (and actors) are all very likable and the series is a great flashback to 80's simplicity, optimism and just plain FUN. The characters are all people you'd like to know (well, maybe not monroe, hehe) and that's part of the charm for this series.

Rhino got it right with this release, the episodes are uncut and there are many extras (a few commentaries and a short ""cast reunion"" segment). Let's hope they hurry up with the release of the THIRD season, and who knows what will become of the ""Ted knight Show"" episodes which were all renamed as ""too close for comfort"" when repackaged for syndication?

The only sad thing about watching a series like this is that you know that it has to end, and like so many other great t.v. series the ending came much too soon for Too Close for Comfort! It's Actually a shame they eventually reworked the series into the Ted Knight Show for the final year, it would have been really nice to have had another season that followed the original premise that made all of the fans love the show!

I've watched them all and I'm ready to buy some more, so come on Rhino and start up the DVD press again!

2261933,5,B00092ZMH0,when will we see season 3?,1136246400,10,26,3.5
2261934,5,B00092ZMH0,"There's no doubt about ""Too Close For Comfort: Season 2"": it is wonderful.  The fact that all 22 episodes are uncut is honest and fortright.  The audio commentaries on 2 episodes from Nancy Dussault (Muriel) and Jim J. Bullock (Monroe) and 2 other episodes from Lydia Cornell (Sara) and Deborah Van Valkenburgh (Jackie) are refreshing; sharing with us their experiences with the show and working with their late star, Ted Knight, who died on August 26, 1986.

The ""Too Close For Comfort"" reunion featurette was a hoot and a pleasure surprise.  The first season set was alright but not great.  Season 2 was far better and when the show was truly funny.  If Season 3 follows the path of Season 2, people will buy.  I know I would.",1121904000,23,728,4.640625
2261935,5,B00092ZMH0,"Needless to say I was very happy that Rhino released season 2 in it's original format! The packaging was excellent and I especially enjoyed the Cosmic Cow icon that pops up on the episode selection list. It was also nice to be able to immediately skip the show's opening(after a few episodes it gets redundant) and go straight to scene selection!

Eventhough Too Close for Comfort was not one of the funniest sitcoms of the 80's, I bought it because I hadn't seen it in years and I actually enjoyed seeing Ted Knight playing the funny overprotective Dad. My only complaint is I wish Rhino would re-release season one with unedited episodes and I'm thankful for the reviewers on Amazon who let people know about the syndicated version before deciding to purchase it!",1121644800,17,765,4.7518796992481205
2261936,5,B00092ZMH0,"Well, I think everyone was a little upset by Rhino's first season release of Too Close for Comfort.  It was the cut up, syndicated episodes with no special features, but not this time.  I am surprised Amazon doesn't mention it, but there are several commentaries on episodes from the second season.  Nancy Dussault and Jim J. Bullock team up to do several commentaries as do Lydia Cornell and Deborah Van Valkenburgh.  If you are a fan of the show and was a little put out about the first season as I was, I think you will like season two a lot better.",1121212800,12,552,4.382352941176471
2261937,5,B00092ZMH0,Which makes me even more excited about the second season.  Apparently Rhino has listened to us fans who were very upset by the syndicated prints in the season 1 box set.  TVShowsOnDVD.com was the one who broke the news by posting an article about it.  I can't wait!,1113264000,8,265,4.479166666666667

8056991,5,B00092ZMH0,"I enjoyed this set. I got it from Walmart last year and have been checking Amazon for more than 6 months for 2nd season.  I see it is available now, will be purchasing.  I enjoyed this show when it was on tv. The only star from this show I have seen recently is Monroe, when he was on a kid show on nick network.  I really miss the 1980's comedies.  Tv was good back then.",1259971200,,372,3.92
8056992,5,B00092ZMH0,"First of all I didn't know ""Too Close for Comfort"" was out on DVD. I was so happy to find out it was. So I purchased Season 2 from amazon. I've got to say it is a great DVD. It brought lots of memories while watching it. The audio and video of the show are great after so many years. And the eppys are UNCUT!!

I would love to see Season 3 out soon on DVD.",1229817600,5,356,3.6842105263157894
8056993,3,B00092ZMH0,"I just read about this show on Wikipedia. I remember seeing this show as a child, but don't remember much about it. The only thing the show haunted me with was it's opening theme song, sounding like something the band ""Steely Dan"" would've done. According to Wikipedia, they said it is believed that ""RHINO ENTERTAINMENT"" have lost the rights to the tv series. Therefore no more seasons will be available until further notice.",1199750400,5,426,4.8493150684931505
