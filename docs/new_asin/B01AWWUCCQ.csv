7613792,2,B01AWWUCCQ,"Let me clarify something, I don't hate the cartoons. It's the product. Inspector Clousseau is one of the most underrated cartoon characters in history. These cartoons are hilarious. The problem I had was that when I got the DVD, the cover had the gaudiest hole ripped along the side. Ironically Deux Deux's expression says it all. I was very disappointed that amazon does not take more care when preparing this for shipment. It's obvious this was done by some machine while it was being packaged but, still. But future buyers do not be deceived: These cartoons are AMAZING. My DVD set was not.",1505606400,,593,4.766990291262136

7613806,4,B01AWWUCCQ,"I recently purchased several Mirisch-DePatie-Freleng cartoon sets, and have to say that Kino Lorber has done a great job presenting beautiful restorations of these timeless classics. Although my favorite of the bunch is ""The Ant and the Aardvark"", I was also a devoted fan of ""The Inspector"" when it ran as part of the Pink Panther animated series. Originally made in 1965 to 1969, this set features all 34 episodes of ""The Inspector"" on two discs. The crazy late sixties color palettes look great and all the prints look better than I imagined they ever could. A few episodes suffer from subpar sound, but I have no doubt that it's as good as the source material would allow. A couple of the episodes were a tad slow or derivative, but overall I was thrilled to see these again; my particular favorites are ""Cirrhosis of the Louvre"", ""Le Escape Goat"", ""Bear De Guerre"", and ""La Feet's Defeat"".

Pat Harrington, Jr. brought ""The Inspector"" to life with his perfect voice acting, and the animators and directors did the rest to make a series that can be enjoyed by all ages, and to add to the enjoyment this set has some extras including interesting critical commentaries on a few of the episodes, and two documentaries, both of which are well worth watching.",1473465600,5,1258,4.744292237442922
7613807,5,B01AWWUCCQ,hubby loves them,1472428800,,16,4.666666666666667
7613808,5,B01AWWUCCQ,"All 34 shorts of The Inspector are here in this 2-disc DVD/Blu-ray collection, all in their original Fullscreen format, and all remastered in HD! The Pink Panther would end up having a whole bunch of affiliates in his TV series over the years, and The Inspector was the first of them, all made by DePatie-Freleng Enterprises! These discs contain a bunch of extras; many commentaries by legendary toon historians like Jerry Beck, Greg Ford, Mark Arnold, and others; and 2 short documentaries that can also be seen in the DVD/Blu-ray releases of The Ant and the Aardvark & CrazyLegs Crane, about how DePatie-Freleng came to be and the history behind some of its best-known series of shorts, other than the Pink Panther! Not even Boomerang airs the Pink Panther anymore, nor his affiliates' shorts, nor more recent incarnations! As my big sister puts it, ""today's world s(tin)ks!"", and that's why I tell everyone I know, via Facebook or in person, you're better off owning as many classic toons as you like on home video as possible! As for the main programming, you never know what The Inspector and Sergeant Deux-Deux (pronounced ""doo-doo"" if you'll pardon how it sounds) will face next, especially with Deux-Deux forgetting to say ""Oui"" instead of ""Si"", on account of his being more Hispanic than French! Adios, I mean, Au revoir, monsieurs and madamoiselles!",1471478400,,1359,4.964912280701754

7613811,5,B01AWWUCCQ,"Even though this starts to look like being similar to Peter Sellers' classic bumbling Inspector Clouseau, (and eventually was modelled after Sellers' physical shape,) these cartoons have a language, mentality, and humor all their own.  For one, this Inspector is actually competent, but prone to making the wrong decision at the worst, inopportune time, all to comedic effect.

These cartoons were made in the 1960s, and though they can be dated in some respects, the humor is timeless, which is the main thing for these cartoons. Recommended for all ages, since there is no swearing, or anything approaching vulgarity in these cartoons.",1469232000,,637,5.235294117647059
7613812,4,B01AWWUCCQ,"I love this show. I'm glad it's all available, and it looks pretty good.",1468972800,,72,4.214285714285714

7613820,5,B01AWWUCCQ,I finally have all the Inspector cartoons. Yeah!,1466380800,,48,5.125
7613821,5,B01AWWUCCQ,"Utterly charming, witty and stylish, the 2-disc collection of all 34 ""The Inspector"" cartoons which were originally screened in cinemas in the mid to late 1960s are wonderfully inventive and thoroughly entertaining.
Each cartoon runs at the snappy pace of just over six minutes (in most cases you may wish they ran a wee bit longer) and are beautifully animated with very funny stories and characters. An added bonus are the clever story titles which deliciously mash French and English e.g. ""Reaux, Reaux Your Boat"", ""Cirrhosis of the Louvre"", ""Unsafe and Seine"", ""Napoleon, Blown-Aparte"", ""Les Miserbots"", ""Sacre Bleu Cross"", ""Tour de Farce"", ""Crow de Guerre"", ""Carte Blanched"", ""Bomb Voyage"", ""Le Pig-Al Patrol"".
Superb voice characterizations by Pat Harrington Jr. and Paul Frees, stylish background artwork and title layout and excellent music scores (mainly by Walter Greene) with that infectious, unforgettable Henry Mancini theme, all make this Pink Panther inspired series an absolute delight.
The Inspector, his Spanish speaking gendarme Deux Deux and the blustery commissioner have not aged at all in this timeless collection.
This release also contains two interesting and informative documentaries on the DePatie-Freleng studio and audio commentaries on some of the films.
Personally, I am not a huge animation buff but feel very chuffed to have added ""The Inspector"" to my collection.",1466294400,7,1398,5.506976744186047
7613822,5,B01AWWUCCQ,"I have been waiting this for decades, great documentaries as a bonus.",1466121600,,69,4.833333333333333
7613823,4,B01AWWUCCQ,"This two disc set covers the entire run (1965-1969) of The Inspector series, which I remember seeing interspersed with The Pink Panther, The Ant & The Aardvark and Tijuana (aka Texas) Toads on Sunday morning TV. Menus are widescreen but the shorts themselves are presented in original aspect ratio (1.33:1), matted left and right.",1465948800,4,330,5.12962962962963

7613826,5,B01AWWUCCQ,"Finally, the complete collection! These are hilarious toons; Pat Harrington makes an excellent Clouseau, doing his own version of the character instead of trying to directly mimic Peter Sellers. About halfway through the series, story quality became somewhat uneven, but there are real gems (such as 'Cherche la Phantom' and 'French Freud') even among the later episodes. Highly recommended!",1464825600,2,391,5.6440677966101696
7613827,4,B01AWWUCCQ,"One of the most enduring and endearing inventions from the DePatie/Frieling animation studios - Kino Lorber has collected virtually every one of The Inspector shorts presented herein in stunning new transfers. There are a couple of caveats - the audio on several of these shorts badly bungled or perhaps, irreversibly damaged - sounding tinny, strident and muffled. Otherwise, color reproduction is superb and these shorts are virtually free of all age-related artifacts. Some light edge enhancement sporadically intrudes. But honestly, these are a whole lot of fun and looking pretty darn spiffy in 1080p. Buy today. Treasure forever.",1463184000,7,635,5.489795918367347
7613828,5,B01AWWUCCQ,"I just viewed it last night and it was totally hilarious!  I only viewed the second disc because I know what's on the first one.  Now I have two discs of the first 17 cartoons.  I'm keeping this 2-disc set and will give the other one away.  Now, how about creating a LOONEY TUNES disc with Speedy Gonzales and Daffy Duck with uncut episodes?",1463011200,3,341,4.28125
7613829,5,B01AWWUCCQ,Perfect! Excellent new release! Wonderful transfers of the old favorites! Worth every penny!,1462492800,,92,6.153846153846154
