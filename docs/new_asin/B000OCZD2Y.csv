Hope this to up my game as soon as I have a chance to get out where the trout are.  Oh, and by the way, the sales  and delivery service were great.  Thank you.",1457568000,,307,3.734375
8184649,5,B000OCZD2Y,Very complete and amazing video. Content is so complete. The narration is poor though. The content of the narration is fine but the delivery is weird and boring.,1301702400,,161,4.785714285714286
8184650,5,B000OCZD2Y,"Not as polished looking as some productions, but certainly more insightful, educational, and genuinely interesting. This DVD changed the way that I operate on the river. I've always been pretty confident that I knew what the trout were up to below the surface, and where they were holding, but this film illustrated that I've only been seeing half the picture. The view from under the water will surprise you, and ultimately help you catch more fish.",1237680000,3,450,4.934210526315789

I might calm down in a few days and be more rational!",1186531200,,74,3.411764705882353
8184652,4,B000OCZD2Y,Excellent underwater fimwork and pleasant narration. This first in a series has only a few new insights for an experienced flyfisherman but those are quite useful. A pleasant way to spend an hour especially if you are watching with someone you are introducing to the sport.,1185580800,4,273,4.956521739130435
