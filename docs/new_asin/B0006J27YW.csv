8041767,5,B0006J27YW,I have many fullmoon movies and this one was good.,1500336000,,50,4.1
8041768,3,B0006J27YW,"This really wasn't terrible.  It's as good as a ""B"" movie can be.  You got three stories, all of them take place in a different room of the same building....LMAO...kind of ridiculous stories.  Acting was pretty good though.  Rent before you buy.  I bought this just cuz it looked like it might be good.  I don't regret buying it because I knew what I was getting into, but I'll encourage everyone else to rent.",1206489600,,410,4.472972972972973
