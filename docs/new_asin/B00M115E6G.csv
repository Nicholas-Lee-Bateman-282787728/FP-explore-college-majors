6546214,5,B00M115E6G,"I love that someone somewhere gave this the green light because of the track record of the production team because something this crazy usually doesn't see the light of day. The plot revolves around Sheen a character from Jimmy Neutron who gets in to one of Jimmy rockets and blasts off to a strange unknown planet. Once there he crash lands into Dorkuses (the main foil of the series) house and is greeted by the emperor who takes an immediate shine to him. From then on Sheen can do no wrong. Whatever the problem the first idea that pops into his head will incredibly work usually in the most round about way possible. Its one of those series where the main character is so stupid and incompetent that he should fail at every turn but doesn't. He's pretty much a little Inspector Clouseau. He's main companion is a talking chimp who by some twist is very capable and smart and tries to be the voice of reason (only to be proved wrong again and again). The crazy banter that comes out of Sheens mouth is just hilarious and even my wife (who does not like cartoons) can't fight off a chuckle now and then.

Now I see a couple of reviewers really hate this but I see one thing in common with all of them, they mention Jimmy Neutron. Now I've only watched a few episodes of that show so I have no special attachment to that version of Sheen so perhaps thats why I enjoyed this. I myself have seen characters I love been rebooted into something I hate so I feel that pain but I feel this series really needs to be given a chance on its own. Besides as far as I'm concerned Jimmy did it on purpose. I mean who covers a rocket with notes saying ""do no touch"" and ""do not push"", this is the smartest boy in the world and he knew Sheen would not be able to resist. Either way with Amazon video's and youtube you can watch an episode and decide for yourself.",1438473600,3,1851,4.273504273504273
6546215,4,B00M115E6G,"No, your eyes are not deceiving you! Sheen, the wacky sidekick (or one of them) of that Boy Genius, Jimmy Neutron, is now the star of his own show! Well, to be more precise, he WAS the star of his own show for a while, but not a very long one --- only a long enough while as to be able to include the entire series in one 3-disc set. (Although, if you like the show, the fact that you don't have to buy multiple sets to get all of the episodes IS convenient!) And, as much as I like this show, I have to admit it isn't for everyone. It's VERY wacky, VERY weird, a bit gross... and the main character is Sheen. Just that fact alone is probably enough to drive a lot of people away, lol. The show being so ""not for everyone"" is probably why it didn't last longer than it did.
Having seen several if not all of these episodes before I bought this set, I kinda knew what I was in for. I find the show to usually be pretty funny, but I can see how a lot of people would be put off by it, including Jimmy Neutron fans. It may have a Jimmy Neutron character on it (as well as one who is very clearly ""based"" on another one), but it is VERY far removed from that show... VERY far indeed. (And I'm not just talking about the distance between Earth and Zeenu!)
I personally enjoy this show, and I think it's really cool to have the entire series in one set. I was initially a little worried that the discs wouldn't play in my DVD player, as it's an older one and these discs are in the DVD-R format, but so far they've played just fine in it. I find the picture quality to be a bit rough, but it's good enough for me. And for three discs, the price wasn't bad at all!
If you haven't seen this show and don't know if you'd like it or want to buy it, watch it elsewhere first, if possible. If you like Jimmy Neutron, don't just assume that because you like that show, you will like this one. That assumption could turn out to be a BIG mistake!
(And by the way, in one episode there is a joke that many people may find insensitive concerning seizures and swallowing your tongue. I will concede that that joke was out of line --- in fact, it's one thing that prevents me from giving this set five stars --- but it isn't something to hate the entire series over!)",1432166400,2,2248,4.0539325842696625
6546216,2,B00M115E6G,"Why...? WHY...? WHY?!? Why does this show exist?!? Why does it exist to insult our intelligence as a species?!?

As you may or may not have surmised, I don't like this show. I feel it is an insulting waste of time that is the epitome of laziness and the belief that you can throw anything at your kid and it's okay because they're just kids. DON'T DO THIS! Don't subjugate your child to anything that you wouldn't be willing to sit through. In fact, don't subjugate yourself to this! It's heinous! Pure unadulterated awfulness!

HOWEVER, with that said, I can't give this one star, as it does give what's being advertised. It's the full show, it's at a decent price, it technically is a good bargain. HOWEVER, I will not recommend that you buy it. It's an insultingly lazy show that should never serve as a child's source of entertainment.

My recommendation? Try the original movie and show, Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius and The Adventures of Jimmy Neutron. The character Sheen is far more developed and likable there, and you can actually have some intelligent adventures with a cast of likable characters that include a boy genius, his less intelligent female rival/love interest, a music lover, and a quirky but lovable goofball. It's the parent show, it's the better show, don't waste your time with this mess, go watch Jimmy Neutron!",1427068800,4,1336,4.774891774891775

6546219,3,B00M115E6G,"I will give this three stars because I really like how Nickelodeon is creating these complete series DVDs for its fans, so just about any will get a seal of approval from me.

HOWEVER: This is a series you should do some homework on before you go and buy it. I personally didn't like the series because it's yet another that thinks it's a good idea to make the comedic sidekick the main character. As such, you may not appreciate its humor or how thick-headed Sheen is. The writing and characterization is nowhere as good as Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius (why didn't that get a complete series DVD?) and as such, may not be your thing.

My strongest advice: Take a look at a preview of the series online, and see if this is up your alley. If it is, by all means, go and buy it. If not....settle for Rocko's Modern Life the Complete Series instead if you must have a Nicktoon title.",1421884800,3,877,4.341463414634147

8669565,5,B00M115E6G,An excellent kid's series that was FAR too short-lived. My only regret about buying it for my 12 year old is that the DVD set of the entire series is too short. Nickelodeon should have gave this series a few more years!,1517529600,,219,4.238095238095238
