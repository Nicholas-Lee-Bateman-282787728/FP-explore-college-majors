8643708,3,B00INMLT9I,"I liked James Cagney in the beginning when he generously pays the medical bills for his love interest's boy. When he returns to New York, he loses himself over a Park Avenue aristocrat who seems only fascinated by the novelty. He's even willing to undergo plastic surgery so he can be more attractive to her. The story suffers as Cagney becomes more cagey and desperate for sex. After he learns who the Park Avenue girl really is, he returns to his original love interest but it all seems rushed and frantic. Missing is the tenderness and deep feeling from the beginning of the film.

Recommended for Cagney fans only.",1531094400,,618,4.669724770642202
