Little Bear is so sweet and loves his mommy and daddy so much, and there is a great comradry with his friends too. It teaches alot about being a good friend and being a good and caring child.",1288051200,,299,4.2631578947368425
8462936,4,B000UV36PA,"If you are looking for good cartoons for very young children to watch, the ""Little Bear"" series is an excellent choice. These videos are nonviolent, reasonably engaging and intelligent, and they generally teach good values and problem solving. It's not great art, but it is entertaining and won't insult your child's intelligence. Based on a series of books written by Else Homelund Minarik in the 1960s, this is good family fare -- you can park your kid in front of these films and not have to worry about disturbing or inappropriate content. Whew! Thank goodness. The episodes are short and each disc has quite a lot of content on them... a lot of bang for your buck. These have been big hits around our household.
