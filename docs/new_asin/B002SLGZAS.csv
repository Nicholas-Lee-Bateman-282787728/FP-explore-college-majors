8379440,2,B002SLGZAS,"This movie and the people were just strange.  Peter Bunch one of the hostages (in purple shirt) was laughing throughout the film for no reason.  Very strange and peculiar.  I am not familiar with this relief organization, but I can't understand how they would send such inexperienced young women who don't appear to know much about the Islamic culture to live in such a hostile and dangerous place.  And then they show a Jesus movie to a Muslim family??  It was all just creepy.  Of course GOD saw them through all this nightmare, but do these kind of people realize that though they think they are saving the world, they are over their heads, and not in a western country.  There are a lot of people who have to risk their own lives to rescue them because of their ignorance and stupidity.  I'm glad they all got out safe, but I hope everyone involved learned some hard lessons about inserting themselves in cultures that don't want them.",1528588800,,939,4.580838323353293

8379443,5,B002SLGZAS,"""Kabul-24 is filmmaker Ben Pearson's penetrating look at the unwarranted and terrifying intrusion of the Taliban into the lives of a small group of Christian aid workers in 2001. The film's special focus is on an international team of eight 'Shelter Now' volunteers in Afghanistan, two of whom were Americans, all of whom for no apparent justification were imprisoned for 105 desperate days till, finally, through answered prayer and behind the scenes maneuvering, they were rescued by American Special Forces. Pearson's sensitive and thorough unfolding of the story kept me on the edge of my seat cushion all the way through. One of the things that really grabbed me - without spoiling it for anyone - was the reveal of exactly why the Taliban swooped in with their loaded Kalashnikovs and grabbed the workers and the timing of it. There was a diabolical method to their madness. Pearson's storytelling is evenly paced and suspenseful; nothing crucial to the sequence of events is left out. The visuals and soundtrack are top-notch, interwoven with interviews of the former captives, other key characters, and the excellent narration of Jim Caviezel (""The Passion of the Christ""). This film is, and I believe will probably always be, THE definitive media revelation of what really happened during those fateful days to those brave "" Kabul 24."" At the end of Pearson's film, my faith in God and in his ultimate wise purposes was wonderfully affirmed. A must see!""",1264896000,7,1463,5.049586776859504
8379444,5,B002SLGZAS,"This tells a story that was huge news in America for a short period of time right around September 11th, 2001. In the States, we learned of the 2 Americans involved in this hostage situation by the names of Heather Mercer and Dayna Curry. As is want to do in most stories of this magnitude, the backstory is far more compelling than what we're shown on the evening news and the chat shows. I think most people would be shocked to realize that there were a whole group of hostages from a few different countries around the world. There were even many Afghanis that were initially imprisoned as well.

The writers did a great job tying together how this incident was strategically planned by Al Qaeda well in advance and what had seemed like a loosely related, almost coincidental event to the larger terrorist attacks in the US wasn't coincidental at all. I'm very happy that this larger story than most Americans had been aware has been told and is now cemented in history for all who are interested to learn about it. Since this area of the world is still such a fluid situation that will impact us for a very long time, it's worth picking this up for continued education purposes.

The production value is extremely well done. The editing, writing, cinematography and direction is excellent. The story was engrossing and the presentation was straightforward with very creative use of effects without cheesy re-enactments. It's the real people revisiting the actual places and telling it straight from their hearts. Well done. I'd recommend it very highly for all audiences.",1262736000,3,1575,4.808118081180812
