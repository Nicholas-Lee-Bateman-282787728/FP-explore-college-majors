8489440,5,B005Z554BU,"Amazing concert by Pink Lady, singing all their hit songs.  Not sure why Amazon is say that this CD does not play in US players because I just received it and it plays just fine only Alienware Laptop with no problems.  I love the packaging and it even comes with a booklet that has photos of Pink Lady from the tour.  Would definitely recommend purchasing this if you're a Pink Lady fan.  Don't be scared by Amazon saying it doesn't play in US players.",1433116800,,452,4.345238095238095
