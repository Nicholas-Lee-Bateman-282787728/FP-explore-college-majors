8422943,5,B004CE116M,"This review is specifically for Haunted History of Savannah Georgia as I got that individually on DVD. It is well done with clean video and narrated by my favorite voice in the series. I think on or after 2000, the narration changed from Michael Dorn (Star Trek The Next Generation) for the better. People that love this series know what I am talking about. This is one of my favorites in the series.

The program highlights the following:
~ Colonial Park Cemetery/Two gentlemen that ended up buried not far from each other and at one time had a duel.
~ The Pirate's House Restaurant and Inn (Captain Flynt and Secret Tunnels)
~ The Old Pink House Restaurant (Dates back to early 1770s, Oldest surviving building in Savannah, Several ghosts)
~Bonaventure Cemetery/Plantation
~Fort Jackson (Civil War)
~The Marshal House Hotel (Juliet Gordon Lowe/Founder of the Girl Scouts), (Nellie/Willie Gordon)
~Hamilton Turner Mansion
~General Mercer House (A murder scenario took place between owner and hired help that involved a gun)

All in all, one of my very favorite in this series of Haunted History programs. Well worth it!
DVD is well narrated and very clean.",1412035200,,1157,4.989637305699482
