8159119,5,B000KVROXK,"Great set. I've done others by the same trainer, but keep coming back to these. This was ideal for when I was slightly past starting my fitness journey. If you are in the 2-5lb range on hand weights, these are fantastic. (People using significant weight would find this too easy.) I still come back to them when I want to be active without hurting myself - but early on, these we plenty hard enough! It's kettle-bell based so the light weights are extra effective. It's high-rep so there is some cardio burn too. The legs and abs workouts are my favorites, but the arms and the buns workouts are great too. The ""Envy Girls"" premise is a little kooky, but I wasn't looking for high-grade cinema. I was looking for a good workout and it consistently delivered (off and on) for years.",1470182400,,781,4.507042253521127
