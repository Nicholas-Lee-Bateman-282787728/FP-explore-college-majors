4336049,5,B004E5I2N4,"The new release of Perfectly Prepared is everything you could hope for!  I tried the original and it was good but I wasn't thrilled with the exercise instruction provided.  I actually commented on that fact in my review of the original and Perfectly Prepared sent me their newly released fitness DVDs which are a great improvement!  I am thrilled with my new exercise program, with the pregnancy, labor and delivery instruction I have received and feel so much better prepared to become a mom!  I am also very impressed with the great customer service I have received from Perfectly Prepared.  Well worth the investment!",1297123200,3,620,4.923076923076923
8426509,1,B004E5I2N4,"Everything I am about to write is about the Labor and Delivery DVD. This is not a good option for a woman who plans on getting an epidural or is open to the idea of getting an epidural, as it really pushes unmedicated childbirth. The only women they have talk about their experiences did it without medication. That's a wonderful option, but I would have liked information on other options too. It's very dry and there are way too many moments that just show black and white photos of the instructor during childbirth. While some of them are beautiful, they don't help the viewer learn much of anything about labor and delivery. They talk about practicing relaxation techniques and breathing, but the instructor only briefly mentions how to breathe or ways to relax. (There is a separate CD with information about relaxation and pain management.) I didn't like some of the men in the video, either. One of the women talked about what a great coach her husband was. He lied to her repeatedly and kept telling her he had buzzed the nurse when she wanted an epidural so that she'd make it through and stick to ""their plan."" I understand that women who really want to do the whole thing unmedicated might be really disappointed later if they don't, but if a woman requests pain relief, I don't think it's OK to lie to her or deny it for the sake of sticking to a plan she created before knowing what the experience would really be like.",1463875200,,1432,4.554263565891473
8426510,5,B004E5I2N4,We are first time parents and pretty much clueless about the entire birth process. The DVDs were very informative and we now feel that we have a much better understanding of what to expect when our daughter is ready to enter the world. We plan to practice the relaxation and pain management techniques many times between now and March in hopes of making it the best possible birthing experience.,1356220800,,395,4.739130434782608
8426511,5,B004E5I2N4,"My doula recommended this to us and I'm very happy she did.

I'm having my first child and watching this video gave me a pretty clear picture of what I was dealing with.  I'm doing a natural birth and this video is leading you to strengthen that ideal in my opinion. (that's what I was looking for.)

The videos were extremely helpful and useful information not just for me but for my husband as well.  It has COUPLES doing the interviews not just the moms.  My husband appreciated that a lot because it gave him an idea of what they felt as well.

I found the Pain and Relaxation Audio CD the best part of the whole box set.  The hostess explains the different methods of relaxation and then she goes a step further by actually doing a self hypnosis walk through and then talks you through one.  I put those last three tracks of that cd on my phone and I listen to it when I go to sleep at night.  And I'm going to take that with me to the hospital.

I would TOTALLY recommend this.  I was clueless about Labor and delivery and this went above and beyond what I was expecting :)
And an even bigger plus for those going natural.",1346976000,,1128,4.2
8426512,3,B004E5I2N4,"I was looking for a video that would take place of the traditional birthing class- this combination of CD's did not really satisfy my needs. It was informative but I found it hard to stay focused during the video, too mellow, basically not someone I could sit and listen too. It was very pro- natural/no epidural. I felt frustrated with that b/c I have chosen the epidural and emotionally tugged at my decision. There are a lot of CD's but only one actually short dvd of an actual birth class, the others are a workout cd, and two audio CD's that I had no use for. In hind-sight I would not have bought this product for my needs.",1339632000,,629,4.338983050847458
8426513,5,B004E5I2N4,"I work ""banker's hours"" and the hospitals in my area don't offer a birthing class that fits my schedule (even the evening ones would start while I was still in the office). After some initial research I found ""Perfectly Prepared: Birthing Class in a Box."" My husband and I thought that for the price it would be perfect. We could watch or listen to the information together in the comfort and privacy of our own home. I am the kind of person that doesn't like large crowds and am very particular who is near me and especially my baby belly. The delivery of the information is a little dry and mechanical, but it's thorough and not candy-coated like oh so many of the books and such on pregnancy and childbirth. I honestly prefer dry and mechanical to cutesy and childish.

On the DVD ""Labor & Delivery: Experts on Birth"" they cover both medicated birth and natural birth options (and actually mentioned the Bradley Method of childbirth which I will be trying with this child). The audio CD's ""All About Labor"" and ""Relaxation & Pain Management"" are handy to listen to on my commute to work. I love that it comes with DVD's for toning and prenatal yoga to help you prepare your body for the great task ahead.

I love this product for the information and convenience. I can refer to the materials at my leisure, and while I don't have a birthing instructor to ask questions, my midwife and her staff have been very thorough with any additional questions I have. If you are unable to attend a birthing class with your hospital or want to have information on hand for your own reference, I highly recommend this product.",1338336000,,1616,4.568965517241379
8426514,3,B004E5I2N4,"Overall, I've been pleased with this.  The information about labor & delivery and exercises you should do to prepare is good, but I was expecting the exercise portions to be less informational and more like a workout video I could pop in and do a few times a week or even daily.  I was disappointed there, the toning DVD shows you what to do and tells you how many of each to do per day, but it doesn't compile it all into a workout routine.  The yoga DVD was very disappointing for me because I already have a wonderful prenatal yoga and this one moves too quickly through poses that are very awkward for me with a belly and while I had to stop and rest once to get my heart rate down, it didn't have a good steady workout flow.  The labor & delivery CDs and DVDs are good however, so I'll just continue to use the yoga I like.",1335830400,,828,4.124223602484472
8426515,3,B004E5I2N4,This was very helpful. I however did not like the fact that there were 3 cds and 3 dvds. I wish it would have had more dvds. The dvds were very educational. I would have liked to have seen an actual delievery. It would have helped prepare my husband and i more. The 3 cds they had were somewhat helpful. One was a little long and the other was repetative of the laboring dvd. I don't think that for what you get it is worth the cost. I purchased this because they cancelled the only lamaze class in my area. I think it came close to filling in the information i would have received at the class.,1330905600,,595,4.094017094017094
8426516,2,B004E5I2N4,"My husband and I were really disappointed with this product overall.  The lady that presented the information (Becky) sounded totally rehearsed and computer-like, which was completely distracting and hard to follow.  We did enjoy a couple of the interviews from the doctors.  The other major disappointment was the ""All about Labor"", ""Relaxation and Pain Management"", and ""Birth Options"" were basically audio books that were so boring to listen to.  The toning and yoga dvd's were fair if you don't have any other options but I won't ever use them.  I wouldn't waste your money on the perfectly prepared but if you really want to check Becky's dvd out, try the Labor 101, which is the cheaper version (it has the 1 Labor DVD that and 2 audio books).

Personally, I'd recommend the ""Laugh and Learn about Childbirth"" by Sheri Bayles, which is a lot more enjoyable to watch, cheesy but better. The only downfall Sheri's Labor dvd was she spent so much time introducing the couples in the class (that could have been edited out).  I've watched all the Laugh and Learns and even though they were basic info and could have expanded more, I enjoyed them.  The Perfectly Prepared and Labor 101 versions were just painfully boring to watch.  The other dvd's that I thought were great were the ""Happiest Baby on the Block"" and ""Baby Human"" series.  Good luck.

A side note about the dvd case packaging... The dvd packaging itself was really poor, which held all of the dvd's and cd's in one case.  The inside holder was broken when I opened it and 1/2 the discs were just loose because their individual holders weren't adequate to hold the discs.  Unfortunately they were scratched up because of this.  (This wasn't a shipping issue, it was a product issue)",1329264000,2,1748,4.764119601328904
8426517,4,B004E5I2N4,"The information on these CDs and DVDs is fantastic, better than some of the expensive classes I have been to. She is an experienced Mom and midwife and has probably seen it all. If you are interested in a natural birth, this is a useful set. Plus you can listen on your own time and repeatedly until the words stick in your pregnant mush brain.
My issue is with her incorrect pronounciation of a lot of words. Maybe it's nit-picky but she says stuff like ""tellbone"" instead of tailbone and ""berdthing"" instead of birthing. There's many more but I don't want to put them in your head. She talks really calm and peacefully so it might not be good for car trips when you are already tired.",1326153600,,686,4.409448818897638
8426518,5,B004E5I2N4,"I absolutely loved the Perfectly Prepared set! I just delivered my 7th child. I have delivered 2 children with the epidural, twins by c-section, and this was my third natural labor. I have gone to Lamaze classes, Bradley birthing classes, and gone with a midwife. This was my first delivery where I prepared myself with the Perfectly Prepared CD/DVD set. I can honestly say what a difference it made! I love how the relaxation techniques are taught and practiced after the workouts! I thought I was relaxing during a previous natural delivery and was surprised at how sore my feet and legs were after delivery. My midwife explained that it was because I was so tense during and after my labor pains. She tried to get me to relax, and I honestly thought I was! During this delivery, the same midwife checked my pulse between my transition contractions and laughed about my pulse indicating that I wasn't even slightly excited. :) I was able to endure my 27 hour labor as I know from previous experience, I wouldn't have been able to because of this set! Thank you Perfectly Prepared for helping me have the strength I needed to have a successful labor and delivery!",1309219200,11,1164,4.682926829268292
