7827391,5,6302531780,"This is a fun mini-series about American private school life based on the novels of Owen Johnson--better known for his novel ""Stover at Yale"", which was a favorite of F. Scott Fitzgerald.  Too bad this mini-series is not available on DVD.",1386720000,,238,4.804878048780488
7827392,5,6302531780,"If you've ever imagined what it was like growing up in the Victorian or Edwardian eras, you may enjoy checking out this late 1980s mini-series. Kind of like an American version of Rudyard Kipling's ""Stalky and Co.""(or more recently, the Harry Potter books), it's based on the reminiscences of a man named Owen Johnson. Johnson, who went on to become a moderately well-known writer and columnist, attended Lawrenceville School in New Jersey in the late 1800s, though this adaptation is set c. 1905. The school is still operating, though it's now co-ed. The types of people described in these stories will probably be familiar to anyone who's made it through their teens -- the jocks, the nerds, the hustlers, the wallflowers. Some good performances by the young actors -- some of them are still working in showbiz, like a startlingly-young Stephen Baldwin (as the boxing fan ""Gutterpup Lazelle""), and Dave Foley who plays the long-suffering ""Ironsides"" Smith (and also ""Welsh Rabbit""). A sunny, good-humored look at a bygone era before the internet, TV, and cell phones -- suitable for kids of all ages.",1357171200,,1102,5.027322404371585
7827393,5,6302531780,"I saw this mini series years and years ago and it has always had a special place in my heart.  Based on the amazing writings of Owen Johnson, this film is entertaining, funny, witty and loads of fun!  I recommend it for the entire family!",1161302400,4,238,4.266666666666667
7827394,5,6302531780,"Starring Zach Galligan of ""Gremlins"" and ""Waxworks"" fame, ""The Lawrenceville Stories"" are an innocent and impish foray into the friendships and rivalries of silver-tongued ""Hickey"" Hicks (Galligan), entrepreneur Doc Macnooder (Albert Schultz), and the sly Tennessee Shad (Nicholas Rowe). Set in a turn-of-the-century boarding school, these American Playhouse adaptations of Owen Johnson's ""The Prodigious Hickey"" and ""The Tennessee Shad"" are gently funny programmes suitable for the whole family. Movies which do books justice are few and far between, but when you have such fine actors in roles replete with witty dialogue and good-natured pranks, it's easy to overlook a plot change or two... Well worth the purchase if you're a fan of PBS programming.",1043971200,11,754,5.62280701754386
