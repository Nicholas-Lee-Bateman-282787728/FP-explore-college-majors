8146238,1,B000ILYYAI,I don't know but this does not look digitally remastered. It's so blurry that we could not watch it for even a minute without getting a headache. Rip off and waste of $$. Sorry I bought it. If I could I could give it a 0 rating.,1233360000,2,228,3.872340425531915
8146239,4,B000ILYYAI,My husband wanted this to see Gene's Martin guitar. He was very happy with the dvd.,1229040000,,83,4.25
8146240,3,B000ILYYAI,"Weall knew Gene couldn't act. He said so. But I, who now have absorbed great music from Bach to Stravinsky, still find his singing, not to mention his uncanny nose for a hit, absolutely charming. There is something to a man who is liked if not even loved, by both men and women.
Autry and his studio created a new genre. Many of his films, although simple and predictable in part, dealt with many of the problmes of the modern west( water, forestry, modern ranching and frarming methods) that were part of the New Deal reforms of the Roosevelt administration.",1193875200,6,559,4.6
8146241,4,B000ILYYAI,"If Gene Autry is remembered at all these days, it's probably for his classic  recording of ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer."" Sports fans may recall that Autry was the popular owner of the Los Angeles Angels baseball team. But, once upon a time in the early 1930s, unassuming Gene Autry was THE singing cowboy. Some years before Roy Rogers came along we had Gene, his horse Champion, his guitar and the Melody Ranch.

Dozens of hour-length westerns in the Autry catalog are a fine testament to this decent man who once entertained legions of fans with his clean-cut yet exciting cowboy films. Ten of those fine old westerns are offered on this DVD set, so grab your Stetson and spurs, pard and let's get ""back in the saddle again!""

Eight of these, plus an incredibly diverse selection of cowboy films are on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WESTERN-CLASSICS-100-MOVIE-PACK/dp/B000MQCB1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WESTERN CLASSICS 100 MOVIE PACK</a>.

8146242,5,B000ILYYAI,"Who wouldn't like Gene Autry, the perfect cowboy hero?  Well, he couldn't act worth a lick.  His movie characters were one dimensionable.  The plots were shallow and more than a bit obvious.  His singing sometimes erupted at strange moments.  Still, these B movies evoke Saturday mornings at the Madison Theater in Mansfield, Ohio, of my youth when I judged not harshly and enjoyed more.  Why else would I like these 10 examples of Autry's work?

As he grew older and could not longer play the romantic lead, could no longer sit a horse with some realism, he used the money he made to acquire the Los Angeles Angels baseball team.  The players loved him, as movie fans had loved him.  Apparently he had an aura of goodness about his head.  That aura is still there, as I watched these movies.",1183420800,8,792,4.5928571428571425
