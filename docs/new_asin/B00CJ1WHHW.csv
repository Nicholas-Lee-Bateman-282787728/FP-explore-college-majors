5723127,5,B00CJ1WHHW,"I was not introduced to Col. Bruce until 1991. But because Capricorn Records and the HORDE tour, my opinions about music haven't been the same since.  He and his band the Aquarium Rescue Unit turned what I thought could be done musically inside - ""out"".  I was only a teenager at the time, but after seeing the Col. live with this band, the possibilities of music and my interests in its various forms began to expand and I must credit Col. Bruce Hampton for pushing  my musical horizons 'Out"".  He has taught so many folks, so many great lessons.  In the words of the great Col. Bruce Hampton: ""Ain't no egos under water""

We've all seemed to know so little about the man until now.  This documentary is extremely well done, we've been waiting for this for a long time.........Kudos and Muchas Gracias!",1379808000,4,803,4.573426573426573
