The spiritual thread Sue brings to her life and co workers of loving acceptance and looking to God for help is part of my own life and isn't about religion but being a reflection of a loving and forgiving GOD!",1382745600,3,345,4.672131147540983
5005387,5,B006MJSK4G,Great series. Very happy to finally own it. Now I can watch it whenever I want to. Well worth watching,1381276800,,102,4.15
5005388,5,B006MJSK4G,"There is a real Sue Thomas and she is deaf and she worked for the F.B.I. This series can give people an idea of what it is like to be deaf. We started watching this series from the beginning when Sue
Thomas was first hired. The actress Deana Bray who portrays Sue Thomas is deaf and has an appealing on screen presence. There is a special dog that Sue Thomas owns and  the dog tells her when the phone is ringing or someone is at the door. The dog is funny and very empathetic as animals can be. The series keeps the same group of people throughout and they all work as a team to make the show work. I suppose many people would say there is some predictability to the various episodes. I do not recall any swearing or sexual references or situations. The elements of real danger and deaths of people would make this inappropriate for small or sensitive children. If you have any deaf friends or acquaintances please recommend this series. This series really illustrated how VERY difficult life is for deaf people in a 'hearing' world. Wholesome entertainment say I.",1376006400,4,1065,4.489690721649485
5005389,5,B006MJSK4G,"Enjoyed all volumes.  Thought the cast was outstanding.  Deanne and Yannick along with the other cast members made the series very entertaining.

5005394,5,B006MJSK4G,"I love this show and wish that the networks would bring it back.  It is funnyy, up to date, exciting and makes you want to be there in the Bull Pen with them. They left some loose ends when they ended the show and I would love to see them resolved.  You can't help fall in love with the cast, especially Sue, Jack, Levi and Bobby.  There are a couple of episodes that I remember watching on GMC but when I bought the set they weren,t in it.  Am I missing a set?  I have volumes 1-5.",1328313600,3,482,3.9278350515463916

8500960,5,B006MJSK4G,"I'm required to pass on from my sister a five star rating. I got this for my sister for her birthday in 2013. This helped her complete her set. I know for years she had asked for it but it wasn't available on dvd for the longest time. I watched a few episodes on tv and recognized Yannick Bisson of Murdoch Mysteries Fame. It seemed like an interesting show and I could see why she liked the show so much. So to fans of this show, I would get this set. Deanne Bray plays the title role of the deaf woman who uses a hearing ear dog as a very intelligent and capable F.B.I. agent. Very good dramatic show.",1486339200,,603,4.07563025210084

Although Sue and her co-workers  are of a well above average moral character, they still seem like real people.
