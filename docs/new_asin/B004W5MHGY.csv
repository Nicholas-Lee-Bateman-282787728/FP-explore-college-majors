4485393,3,B004W5MHGY,Saw this on Syfy channel Wolf is hokey acting is OK don't know what else can I say typical made for TV movie you want it to end just because you get tired of looking at the wolf not as bad as some but not the greatest slasher/horror movie I have seen,1376438400,3,250,3.826923076923077
4485394,4,B004W5MHGY,"SyFy Channel has become famous (infamous?) for producing original campy sci-fi horror movies that premiere on Saturday nights.  'Monsterwolf' is one of these.  It's a simple ""bad guys get what they deserve by vengeful Native American spirit"" movie.  It's also got the expected ""old love interest returns and reunites with old partner"" B-plot.  And of course there's a ""pretty girl in the shower"" scene, a requirement for any low budget sci-fi horror flick.

This kind of movie will never win any awards but I enjoyed it nonetheless.  Of course the point of these movies isn't to win any awards but to have some good fun with a bucket of popcorn for 85 minutes and 'Monsterwolf' does that quite well, better than other SyFy original movies I've seen.

As long as you go into 'Monsterwolf' expecting a popcorn flick and not much more you should enjoy it.",1374796800,3,852,4.794520547945205

4485400,5,B004W5MHGY,"*The SyFy channel recently aired the movie ""Monsterwolf"" (Screen Media), which I had seen before but enjoyed immensely, so I popped some popcorn and sat down to watch it again.

A work crew for an oil company were ordered to drill to explore for oil on land that was not yet acquired by the company they worked for. In fact, this land belonged to Native Americans, whose Chief Turner (Steve Reevis) refused to sell to the unscrupulous oil magnate, Stark (Robert Picardo). The crew unwittingly unleashed an avenging spirit - an ancestor of the tribe who performed a ritual which transformed him into the form of a giant wolf - whose sole purpose is to protect his people and land.

As Sheriff Bennett (Marc Macauley) is investigating the deaths of the work crew members (who were all decimated), Stark brings in an attorney to help sway both the tribe and the nearby townsfolk to sell their land to him. This attorney just happens to be Sheriff  Bennett's daughter Maria (Leonor Varela), who left the small town to work in a big city law firm. Her homecoming (and the circumstances that caused it) are awkward for her, to say the least - especially when she encounters old flame Yale (Jason London).

Meanwhile, the wolf is on a furious rampage -attacking townsfolk that do sell their property to Stark. Inevitably, a hunting party goes after the beastie, only to find out it's immune to bullets and other weaponry. Chief Turner summed it up nicely, ""It's a Spirit. How can one kill the wind?""

Although the FX weren't the greatest, the story was well told. I loved the shamanism and Native lore included in it, and of course it was great to see corporate greed getting what it oftentimes deserves.

4485401,5,B004W5MHGY,"The movie is awesome and quite good too. An ancient wolf sprite comes to attack those who are destroying the land and how the these hunters try to kill it, but one by one they get killed. And now, it's up to this woman, her boyfriend, and the boyfriend's best friend to find a way to stop this wolf sprite. At the end they were able to defeat the wolf sprite and send it back to the sprite land. And the funny part at the end is I thought the two men were arrested because they didn't do jury court, but instead they were going to a bachelor party. And the woman put the dust of the wolf sprite back in it's seal where is to remind people about it's wrath. Now if you people think this movie is bad, try watching Hydra, Carny, Mosquito, Moth Man, and Razor Tooth, these movies are terrible, but Monster Wolf and Basilisk the Serpent King are the best creature attack movies.",1315353600,3,874,4.208333333333333
4485402,1,B004W5MHGY,"You would think that movie characters would learn. If you in any way violate or dishonor American Indian lands, some kind of ancestral spirit... thingy will appear and rip your face off. In movies, not in real life (sadly). So guess what the plot of the horribly-titled ""Monsterwolf"" is, and how things pan out -- lots of explicit blood, guts, pseudomystical stuff, a sloppy plot, and a few good actors who are given almost nothing to work with.

In the small Southern town of Crowley (be terrified!), the oil company boss Stark (Robert Picardo) is desperate to get ahold of Indian land, presided over by Chief Turner (Steve Reevis). Since Stark works for an Evil Oil Company that will destroy the environment, he has brought in Maria, a local-girl-turned-NYC-lawyer who he hopes will give him an edge.

Oh, and he's also sent workers to start blasting illegally... only for them to be horribly murdered. Turner says that it's the Kachinawaya, a vengeful wolf-spirit that has come to defend his tribe from the oil company ""tribe."" For some reason nobody believes him, even though people keep getting horribly slaughtered by a saber-toothed wolf who cannot be killed by bullets, grenades and a SPEEDING MACK TRUCK.

Meanwhile, the down-home kindness of Crowley's pure-hearted country hicks have thawed Maria's cold lawyer heart. To stop the Kachinawaya -- as well as Stark and the assassins he has called in -- she must dig back into her own past.

If they crammed any more cliches into ""Monsterwolf,"" the entire movie might have burst into flames. We've got a tragic backstory, an environmental message shoehorned in, some faux-Indian lore, an evil oil company (boo! Hiss!), and a cast of blandly generic characters with blandly generic roles to play. It's like if Al Gore decided to make a movie about American Indians' plight.

And the plot is an absolute mess, mainly because the second half tries to introduce.... PLOT. The climactic plot twist is incredibly stupid and predictable, and stuff like Maria being American Indian is only introduced most of the way through the story (it's only ESSENTIAL TO THE PLOT). Additionally, there are all sorts of insanely stupid moments, like an arrowhead necklace being FIRED FROM A GUN. Guns don't work like that.

And like many Syfy movies, the special effects are HORRENDOUS -- the perpetually bloody-mouthed CGI wolf is less frightening than ""Red Riding Hood's."" Also, the budget was apparently too low to spring for a flashback sequence, so the scenes involving the origins of the Kachinawaya are depicted by scribbled cartoons. Huh?

Picardo and Reevis are easily the best actors in this, and they are CRIMINALLY misused. Both of them are playing flat stereotypes -- one the gentle, wise American Indian in tune with nature, and the other an amoral, maniacal murderous corporate money-grubber who is always on the edge of a psychotic break. Neither one really has any characteristics beyond that.

The rest of the actors are blandly mediocre. Leonor Varela does what she can, but her character is so utterly unremarkable that you don't really care if the virtues of small-town America are bringing her back to the ""good"" side. And most of the other actors are pretty dull, and never really developed.

""Monsterwolf"" is a big choking mass of bad writing, limp characters and a smack-you-in-the-face environmental message that makes you want to leave your car running. I'll stick with other movies for my wolf quota.",1305590400,22,3463,5.008695652173913

On orders from the Evil Oil Executive, who is not told about the flame, they use C4 to blow it up.  Instead of being shattered, the circular artifact acts like a stargate, but SG-1 does not come out.  Instead the monster wolf leaps out in full attack mode.  The  monster wolf later proves to be a ""good"",  environmentally friendly, ""green"" wolf who votes with his or her teeth.

The Evil Oil Company Executive asks the Noble Indian why he won't cooperate.  The Noble Indian, excuse me I mean Noble Native American, replies that the Evil Oil Company's methods are an environmental hazard.  The Evil Oil Man (is there any other kind  in modern movies?) says to give him a break, he is drilling for oil, it's like complaining that harpoons are anti-whale.  Ha ha.

This Desert Eagle is the boss, and he says we go"" and the chopper pilot seems both bored and slightly irritated as he agrees to take the guy up, as if being held at gunpoint by a bleeding madman is a minor inconvenience.

4485493,5,B004W5MHGY,"How Refreshing!!!!  A few weeks ago a friend and I were shooting the breeze and complaining how all the damn ""horror"" or ""monster"" movies these days were just recycles of the ""same old same old""; a van full of brainless, nitwit teenagers (or a sorority, or a.....), who get their tails into a crack somehow and wind up being stalked by a psycho killer (or killers)  or ghost killer and who get killed off one by one in some horrible, ghastly fashion (this going back to, essentially, the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", and onward to ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th sequels, and then continuing ad nauseum and ad infinitum) .They get offed because they do stupid, brainless-teenager things that just SET THEM UP to die (a recent TV commercial makes fun of this stupidity with ""Hide In the attic!"", ""Hide in the cemetery!"" lampooning). And they all DO die until one is left who manages to ""kill"" or ""defeat"" the threat vehicle. BUT....in the biggest, most tiresome clich ""shtick"" going...they never REALLY  defeat the threat: the very last scene in the film will ALWAYS show that they ""missed"" something and the evil STILL
 SURVIVES. This is supposed to be a ""surprise"" twist ending but it is sooooooooooo infuriatingly clich these days that it is NO surprise and NO twist. You see the damn thing coming twelve miles off and feel IRRITATED when it happens EXACTLY as expected! ""Oh PLEASE!"", you
groan....to no avail. How wonderful would it be to actually see the threat met and defeated?????????  Sure, there is still evil in the world. And
still threatening things. But THIS thing...whatever it was...got TAKEN CARE OF!!!!
And what if you had ADULTS taking on the boogeymen? Like in the ""Good Old Days""! No teenagers versus the ""Creature From the Black Lagoon"". None ever took on ""Them"". Kids didn't defeat ""The Deadly Mantis"" or the ""Snow Beast"", the ""Tarantula"" or Chris Lee's ""Dracula""
 (the best kids could do was take on ""The Giant Gila Monster"" and ""The Blob"").
Another thing: how tediously clich are werewolf type movies? They all use the old MADE-UP lycanthropic scenarios of Curt Siodmak from
 his Universal Pictures days: werewolves are created by being bitten by another were, they operate under a full moon, they usually take silver
 bullet-riddling to be eradicated.  Ho hum. Nobody reads historical folklore accounts  anymore? The werewolves mostly operated in the DAYTIME. There was NO full moon required, and being ""bitten"" didn't generally make you a werewolf...being CURSED through black magic
(like in ""Wolf Cop""!!) typically did (watch the HILARIOUS werewolf spoof ""Wolf Cop""; evil sorcery curses officer ""Lou Garou"" as a lupine)....OR by turning YOURSELF into such a beastie by pledging yourself to the Devil. They were also usually QUADRUPED, rather than bi-ped, and often were manifested forms, rather than transmogrifications from human bodies (Hollywood's favorite gimmick). As a dillitante paranormalist/cryptozoologist who intereacts with field researchers on ""such things"" I am well aware that many ""werewolf"" (or ""dogman"") sightings/encounters seem to involve something not quite material and that can be observed to materialize and DE-materialize in a ghostly
 fashion (or in a green mist). This ""thing"" in this movie seems to do just that sort of thing (minus the green mist) and I found this intriguing. Is
 this the best lupine booger movie ever made? certainly not. But it is quite a bit more entertaining than most by-the-numbers hairball flicks Ordered it not expecting much and ended up being pleasantly...VERY pleasantly...surprised.
Had ADULTS in it! Wow! Had a story you could follow that wasn't utterly inane! Despite the fact that the TITLE pretty much SUCKS...the movie itself does NOT. Acting is GOOD. Photography and editing is GOOD. Sound is GOOD. Rationale of the story line is intriguing. You can carp about the American Indian/Shaman aspect of itas being clich , but that element intrudes into a LOT of ACTUAL paranormal investigations of wolf creatures nationwide. I like Robert Picardo's  (Star Trek, Voyager) a-hole businessman creep in it. The wolf creature actually mostly kills people who need killing and you WANT killed (with one or two exceptions). And you WANT it to get Picardo in the end...and it DOES (LOL! Spoiler alert!). And, best of all...there is NO indication of the ""trick"" ending there! No gimmicky set up for a sequel.
 Ahhhhh. Fresh air! On the whole, I find this flick to be an entertaining little kick that I may watch again soon.  Well done, SyFy guys!",1437091200,5,4523,5.060483870967742

Although the story line was rather predictable, there was enough ""action"" to make it watchable.  The main characters were likable enough that even though I was rooting for the wolf I was glad they didn't get killed off.  Acting overall was good, although it might have seemed better if I could have heard all of the lines.  In order to not keep the downstairs neighbors awake I had to set the volume low enough to soften the overly loud ""background"" music, and that meant I couldn't hear a lot of the dialogue.  But the plot was pretty straight-forward, so I knew what was going on even without all the talking.
