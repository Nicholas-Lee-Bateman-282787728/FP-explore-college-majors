There's been movies about leprechauns, munchkins, gremlins, etc.  But, for them to make this  movie with the Scarecrow and do it in a relatively convincing way, then I  give it a thumbs up.  And although I don't want to reveal what parts,  because I truely want you to order this video, there were 2 convincingly  scary parts in this film.  Now, buy the damn tape! :)",944611200,3,491,4.148936170212766

718937,4,6303853013,"This film, after Dark Night of the Scarecrow, was fairly good as well, but this film had major supernatural overtones, the back story is cliched, but good anyway. Director Jeff Burr, of Stepfather II put a character actor team together and made a fairly good spooky thriller, the trailer made it look pretty interesting to me, and I wasn't disappointed. The disc release should've come long before it did, I saw it on video first, but the disc didn't come with cc/subtitles, and this one needed one or the other, as a result, I'm holding on to both formats. I also wish certain disc releases would retain their video copy case designs, but a lot haven't done that. Plus, I don't think this ever got a sequel, and that's not always a bad thing. The special effects, though mainly physical, instead of CGI, helped make it work.",1390262400,2,825,4.619047619047619
718938,4,6303853013,"I remember watching this movie in the mid 90s when it was still fresh. I recalled the ""wild orgies"" scene very well...it was extremely cheesy and hilarious. I found out that Night of the Scarecrow was getting its long overdue DVD/Blu-Ray treatment, so decided to buy the High Def version...got it for 20 bucks and some very little cents. The movie is just as cheesy and campy as I remembered it, and I loved every bit of it. The scenes when the scarecrow uses his ""finger"" to impregnate, or attempt to impregnate, women, is disgusting in a guilty pleasure sort of way. The special effects are actually pretty good for a low budget horror flick of this caliber. Besides the impregnation and ensuing ""birth"" scene, the part when the mayor gets crucified is awesome, and the expression and laughter of the scarecrow is truly disturbing and creepy. The back story to the movie is clich, but it works. As mentioned, get ready for a laugh at the orgies scene. It's so over the top and bad acting you can't help but giggle. Actually, the whole movie is full of bad acting, but what do you expect from a low budget slasher about a killer scarecrow? It adds to the charm. Now, about the Blu-Ray, It isn't amazing, but for an 18 year old slasher that is definitely no classic in the genre, it's decent enough. There's beautiful detail in the scenery, especially the corn field in the opening credits. The locations are nice to look at. The daytime outside scenes are of course nicer than the inside and nighttime scenes. The special features are sorely lacking, but anything is better than nothing. There's a 3 minute vintage making of, which the only good scene is showing how the ""mayor crucifixion"" scene was done. There's an 8 minute photo gallery montage of behind the scenes and production correspondence, in tune with music and the director commentary. It's not bad, actually. There's also a full length director commentary for the feature, but I haven't listened to that yet. Overall, if you enjoyed this movie when you were younger, I'd recommend getting it for nostalgia reasons. If you never seen it before, but like cheesy low budget horror flicks, or scarecrow flicks in general, then it's a good viewing.",1381190400,5,2208,4.72279792746114
718939,5,6303853013,this was a great movie it was very suspensful and kept your attention I dearly loved this movie happy to add to my colllection,1373760000,,126,4.291666666666667
718940,4,6303853013,"Okay, at times the scarecrow in question looked and cackled like a demented Muppet.  I quite liked it.  I also enjoyed the vertigo inducing flight over the cornfield during the opening credits.

As horror films go, this one is par for the course.  The story/history of the scarecrow is pretty much what one would expect from a fairy tale.  The townsfolk several generations back needed a crop booster so they turned to the resident warlock.  A bad bargain was struck in order for the town to prosper.  Several orgies later, the same townsfolk got fed up, stole the warlock's spell book, lashed him to a cross, waited impatiently for him to die, burned his body, stuffed the bones into a casket, stuck the casket into the ground, and placed a cement slab over the top of it.  How were they to know that some yahoos, eons later, would break the seal with a bulldozer?  Common mistake uneasily rectified, several bodies later.............
I enjoyed seeing several members of the cast struggling with the material.  I often wonder what goes through the minds of actors playing these wacked-out roles.  Take Gary Lockwood for example, playing the obligatory stinker/mayor who knows what's going on but chooses to ignore it until he is face to face with the scarecrow.  What went through his mind..........I once starred in a classic, 2001 a Space Odyssey.  Ah, those were the days.  Now I'm hung on a wall with a sword and a poker sticking through me.  Where did my career go wrong?

Not to worry, your shame went for a good cause; it ain't art but I liked it!",1371513600,4,1555,4.661764705882353
719038,4,6303853013,"NIGHT OF THE SCARECROW is one of the sillier, yet quite enjoyable entries in its sub-genre of killer-scarecrow movies. The best is probably DARK NIGHT OF THE SCARECROW, but this one is certainly not the worst. The heroine, Elizabeth Barondes is beautiful, and not a bad actress. The scarecrow it / himself is fairly non-threatening, but gets the job done. This scarecrow is possessed by a warlock that the town folk killed long ago. Now, he's back for revenge, and to acquire his eeevil spell book. My one beef w/ this movie is that they decided to make him talk. I find scarecrows far more frightening when they keep their stitched mouths shut! This is especially true here, since they couldn't resist giving him some wise-cracking lines to spew. Ugh! Anyway, gorehundts will rejoice at the gooshier scenes, and the rest of us can be thankful that this scarecrow doesn't use Kung Fu...",1367366400,,886,4.7973856209150325

719040,4,6303853013,"The cast is unknown, but do a decent job, anyway. Yes, it's a slasher film, with a weird back story, but in the supernatural world, it would make sense...to some. The special f/x are impressive, some of them looked alot more real, than those made on a computer nowadays, though I'm sure some computers were used. I just got this on VHS, but I hope it gets the DVD treatment eventually, because I will buy it again.
Director Jeff Burr makes it rather moody and creepy, throwing in a little humor periodically. This film never had a sequel, and didn't need one. Don't confuse this with Dark Night of the Scarecrow, oh no! That was good, this was better. Check it out, you may be suprised.",1309651200,,686,4.4523809523809526
719041,5,6303853013,"Night of the Scarecrow is by far one of the finest 90's B horror we've seen in a long time. Yeah that is a strong way to start out. Naturally, you know by now that the Sid brothers are the worlds foremost 90's B enthusiasts. Maybe because it brings us back to a time we'd walk into the local video store on a Saturday night, pick up a great new release B, load up on the snacks, and have an evenings worth of laughs.  There's just something about 90's horror that's so great. Filled with sub par acting and an awesomely B grade plots, the 90's had it going on. Which is why we were so pleased to come across Night of the Scarecrow....this thing is good, we want to be friends with it. The movies is essentially what all 90's B horror should emulate.

Right off the bat you open up with a creepy tripped out scene from a crows point of view, moments before he gets finished off by the scarecrow. After this we are introduced to the resident small town hicks of Anytown USA. Lucky for us the sheriff was the bank manager who gave Kramer $25 dollars for nobody saying hello, and all the trades worked out. The real problems begin once the town's two young punks get wasted, steal a tractor, and unleash an evil warlock spirit that possesses a scarecrow. This scarecrows is all about the business. This thing tears people apart in some of the most intense Death Scenes since Appache getting impaled by Matt Collins. The towns only hope lies in the hands of an outcasted daughter and her beau that looks like a Razor Ramone impersonator. You can pretty much map out the plot, which is what any good 90's B allows you to do.

So obviously we were all about Night of the Scarecrow from the opening scene up until the captivating ending. We're sure the haze in the air helped, but no matter what this movie should be viewed by everyone at least once. It may even be one of those movies Sid has to throw in rotation every few years. Every year would be sacrilegious being that annual viewings are reserved for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Ring/dp/B00069QD74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Ring</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween/dp/B000RIWAVW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween</a>.

Do yourself a favor and find a way to view Night of the Scarecrow...it will be the equivalent of being chased with a pink turkey baster, then enjoying your Christmas presents.",1303948800,4,2870,5.35920177383592

We told the clerk at the movie store this and he directed us to Night of the Scarecrow. Scary enough for a few high school girls when *gasp* why is everyone getting naked?! HA corrupted by the video guy. This movie was so bad that we couldn't stop watching. Like the old car crash adage. We couldn't turn it off. I think it started to have a plot, as far as B movies go but the end left me wondering  now what? am I the only one who didn't ""get"" it?!!! Is there a sequel??!!! does anyone care??!!!! I do! What happened to the naked chic?? why was she naked in a barn??!  wasn't she itchy?  all in all this is a great movie if you plan on having a few drinks before you watch it. its ten times better.",1123372800,,822,3.9696969696969697

7853908,4,6303853013,"This is a fast-paced supernatural/slasher film that keeps you interested from beginning to end! This plays like a slasher film with supernatural overtones...but the key elements of the slasher genre are all here...so, I'd recommend this one to fans of slasher films!
The kill sequences are unique and original and the early CGI effects shots are pretty impressive...for 1995.
Some of the kills in this one can be rather bloody and gory...but not excessively gory like many of today's horror films!
Overall, this one clocks in at around 85 minutes and it's a fun movie to watch.
Now, as far as 'killer scarecrow' films go, this one ranks at the top of the list! The scarecrow in this one is a cerebral killing machine.
Dark Night of the Scarecrow is a great made for television flick...but is quite tame compared to this one!
1988's Scarecrows has more impressive looking Scarecrows in it...but it's not nearly as fun as this movie is!
So, if you want to see a slasher film with a scarecrow violently killing people...then this is the film for you!",1472169600,,1047,4.758241758241758

7853910,2,6303853013,"It would appear that the only thing that a scarecrow doesn't scare is a crow. Basically, this mishmash has to do with ""sacrificing"" a young man by tying him up on a platform near an old scarecrow that occupies the same area and leaving him alone with the intent of coming back and freeing him the next day. However, in the meantime, the spirit of the young man is absorbed by the scarecrow who then comes to life as a result and wreaks havoc on everyone associated with the sacrificant. How to destroy the scarecrow, stop the carnage, possibly restore the young man who gave him life, and keep the viewer from laughing at the plot line comprises the balance of the film. This is merely a tepid variation on the same old same old ""Scarecrow"" movies. From Stephen King's overdone ""Children of the Corn"" to every other ""Scarecrow"" movie ever made, we've seen it all before.  It's about time to call a halt to ""Scarecrow"" movies. But they're low budget and make money. So be prepared for ""Child of the Scarecrow"". One final note: This scarecrow looked like a left over from a mummy movie. It's also disarming to see how fast the scarecrow can get around and outrun anybody he's after.  Look for him in Rio. And why are all scarecrows male?",1470614400,,1235,4.508928571428571
