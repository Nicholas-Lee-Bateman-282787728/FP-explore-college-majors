7870456,5,6304396066,"when my kids were into trains- this was the BEST.  Entertaining and informative, Whistlestop Willie is also funny to adults. Fast-paced and lyrical including a serious note on the essence of safety around trains and train tracks. Hope it's available on DVD... it's a good one. I was surprised when he took off his hat for some reason I didn't expect him to be bald.  :)  OH- and my youngest wanted to know if Whistlestop Willie could come for his birthday party.",1316476800,,462,4.609756097560975
7870457,4,6304396066,"This video has the three great qualities of quality TV for children:  (1) It is fun: railroad expert ""Whistlestop Willie"" (played by Hardin Minor) puts in a lot of fun and enthusiasm, with juggling skills and some corny humor.  (2) It is educational: This video shows steam and diesel locomotives, a trolley, a pullman sleeper car, a railroad turntable, and of course, a caboose.  There is also a demonstration of a tiny model steam engine.  All this is presented in an engaging fashion for little kids who love trains -- it never gets too slow and it isn't too much.  (3) It is safe (and wholesome).  There is a nice segment on railroad safety, and safety is emphasized throughout.

While Whistlestop Willie's character is too silly and over-the-top for most adults and older children, it is just the right stuff for preschoolers, and depending on their temperment, even some pre-adolesants.  My son (2-and-a-half years old) loves it!",1109376000,,935,4.910828025477707
