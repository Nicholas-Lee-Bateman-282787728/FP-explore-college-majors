8706510,3,B00UGQHASS,"Biographical account of a white man who changed his skin color and hair and posed as a black man traveling thorough the South. Dated but dramatic and a good historical representation of the times. Slow moving in parts and sometimes too philosophical rather than just presenting the action in scenes. The book is good and the movie, although progressive for its time, could have been better, but this is a movie interesting enough to watch.",1475020800,,439,4.866666666666666
