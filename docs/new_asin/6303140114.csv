It starts out with James Woods doing a special on the making of the video in which we get a rare glimpse of the singers performing in the choir. We meet Warren Wiebe aka ""The Velvet Rain Man"" whose comment is nonsensical but his singing is great! It's a shame this guy left us too early and never recorded his own album.
But we see many better known faces from the world of music (Celine Dion, Peter Cetera, The Pointer Sisters, Will Smith the artist then known as Fresh Prince), movies and TV (Meryl Streep, James Woods, Jon Lovitz) and
sports (Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, etc.) A true masterpiece!",1212278400,,697,4.410852713178294

Couldn't really give either one as gifts as I had intended.  The good thing is that they did work alright, just the appearances were very disappointing.  I think they should've stated how very used they were...one said like new, but that was not true.",1198972800,,425,4.48051948051948

Our American troops won the hearts of all of us, young and old, rich and poor, famous and not so famous.  The entertainment world wanted to create something very special to send to the soldiers in the Middle East, so they collaborated with David Foster, a lyrical genius, and came up with VOICES THAT CARE, a moving song which pays tribute to the courageous women and men who were stationed overseas in Desert Storm.  The video shows the making of this song, and through interviews with the celebrities, the writers and the musicians, you are given an inside look at this powerful song that became an anthem of our nation.  The scenes are quite moving as you witness big name stars dedicate their time and talent to this worthy undertaking.  Enjoy this one -- it's a new American Classic piece of music and video making.",1055980800,2,902,4.6125
