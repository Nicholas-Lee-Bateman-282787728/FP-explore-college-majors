8213409,5,B000UJB5C8,"I am graduating myself from being a ""spa' massage thereapist to a medical massage therapist in a personal injury clinic. I needed to get up to speed in medical massage quickly. My employer said that Ralph is the best teacher for that. I took a workshop of his and also got the whole collection of medical massage videos. They are EXELLENT! His seminar was EXCELLENT too. I've learned a lot very quickly and am seeing results from my work with patients. I also got the Travel TP charts to refer to & am using as much TP therapy as possible as it is so effective. Ralph also teachers tp therapy as part of his curiculum. He's a very nice person too and really has a mission to spread these valuable teachings to help humanity.",1318896000,,724,4.41044776119403
