7993953,5,B00009WVLM,Again I am a major nerd - used to watch this show on KIDS WB on Saturday mornings with a big bowl of cereal and the box and jug of milk by my legs. LOL! Its toned down due to it was geared towards kids - only draw back: it wasn't all packaged together like S3 which was all one set and they STILL have not realeased S4 on DVD! I love X-Men anyways!,1386288000,,348,3.7162162162162162

7993956,5,B00009WVLM,"This disc contains the last four episodes of season one of X-Men Evolution.  The episodes as above stated are 'Shadowed Past,' 'Grim Reminder,' and 'The Cauldron' parts 1&2.  This show promotes good values and I love the lessons it embodies and teaches about Trust, betrayal, and acceptance.  A would recommend for anyone out there even if they aren't fans of X-Men.",1273190400,,366,4.967213114754099
7993957,5,B00009WVLM,"X-Men Evolution was a great series because it presented entertaining stories about three-dimensional (albeit super-powered) characters. I did not understand or appreciate the X-Men stories until I happened to encounter this series, which is basically an origins saga created by intelligent writers and gifted artists. I am now hooked. This particular DVD wraps up the first of four seasons (although, as of today, the fourth and final season is not (yet?) available in DVD).",1267574400,,474,5.418918918918919
7993958,3,B00009WVLM,"I thought the season finale was kind of lame with Magneto.  I like the old X-Men cartoons much more, but these are OK if you're a Marvel or X-Men fan.",1256256000,,150,4.0
7993959,5,B00009WVLM,"A great lil DVD.  Nicely presented, well written episodes!  A ""can't miss"" deal!",1123891200,2,80,5.076923076923077
