2486481,4,B000E3L7MI,"I bought this because Robson Green was in it and it was pretty good. Kinda weird seeing ancient England covered in brand-new custom homes. The plot was alright. Dealt with all the usual topics surrounding wife swapping or as they call it here, 'The Lifestyle.' Basically just another paranoid tale saying 'sex equals death'. Apparently nobody in it is capable of just having sex and then going home.",1184025600,9,399,4.882352941176471

2486484,2,B000E3L7MI,"Warning: this mini-series is three hours of sex games followed by three hours of thriller. It would have made a decent movie but was a disappointing, slow and overly explicit mini-series. Six hours is plenty of time to guess who did it!",1152057600,14,236,4.642857142857143

8105237,4,B000E3L7MI,Robson Green is one of my favs.  This is not the best story he's every chosen to appear in but his acting is great just the same.  I'm a big fan of Wire in the Blood so it's interesting to see him as an ordinary citizen instead of a police consultant.  This series is also dark.,1368489600,2,278,3.9285714285714284

8105240,2,B000E3L7MI,"""So you love Robson Green. Well, in Take Me, this release from Koch Vision, we certainly get to see quite a bit of our blue eyed boy. In more than one sense. Take Me originally aired on ITV in the autumn of 2001 as a six part mini series.  Each episode opens with Robson running through the woods with another bloke, carrying a shovel and what looks suspiciously like a body in a bag. You will probably gather that something rather nasty is about to transpire."" Pam Lawrence

'Something is very, very wrong' can be taken very literally. Six hours of a film that could be reduced to three very easily. It was not until the third hour that the beginning of the malevolence could be felt. Robson Green plays Jack, who works for a company that buys large corporations for a song and then sells them for a pretty penny. We meet him when he is in the middle of buying the shipbuilding firm that his father worked for. No one is happy about this and all the workers bang the pipes as he walks out. A portent of things to come?  Kay his wife does not seem to do much of anything but roam from her marriage. We see them in a new house as they prepare to move from the city to the country to overcome Kay's dalliance and put their marriage back together.  They have two children who don't seem to be part of the family. The eldest, a teen, seems to have more common sense and intelligence than her parents.

So, here they are in the new community meeting and greeting their friends. And what a collection they are-the first party they are invited to turns out to be a wife-swap. Neither Kay nor Jack partake of this party this time.  Kay's sister lost her child in a tragic accident and she too, is taking part in these partner swaps. And, then there is the couple across the way, fun and beautiful at first glance and then we begin to realize....

This film does not have much to offer except for a glimpse of middle class life in Britain, and the decorative sense or misense of many. The plot what there is of it, does not appear until too late when we don't really care any longer.  The acting is so-so, too much time for so little.
And, the ending is so bizarre that it does not seem to be part of the film.

""From the very beginning, something bothered me about Take Me. Halfway through the first episode, I realized what it was. The sexual revolution, at least as shown here, is over. Key parties and other such wife-swapping bonanzas became popular in the '60s and '70s, after the family-friendly '50s and before everyone realized that there were serious consequences for this kind of lifestyle. Although there are still some swingers clubs around, it does more than strain credibility to suggest that an entire neighborhood would be involved in these sexual shenanigans.""  Jake Pearson

There is not much to recommend about this film. If you want to see Robson Green at his best, watch 'Wire In The Blood"".
