8201250,3,B000RL21S6,"I LOVE Pete Seeger. He's a national treasure! And, using his celebrity name, he has helped clean up the Hudson River. He helped build and promote the sloop ""Clearwater"" and create the Annual ""Clearwater Folk Festival"" every June. This DVD tells the story. For that it gets five stars. BUT, though the package says it runs 20 minures it's actually only 26. More importantly, that's all there is on the DVD. NOTHING EXTRA. It seems a shame that PBS would have not added something extra to it. A selection of performances from the Clearwater Festival, maybe, or even something more about the Hudson River. The film is definitely worth watching but I downgraded rating to 3 stars for ""environmentally unfriendly"" since it's a full size package with only minimal contents.
