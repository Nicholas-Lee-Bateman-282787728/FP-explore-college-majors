8106967,1,B000E7PZ0O,"I ordered this film to show to high school social studies students. Big mistake. The visuals are composed exclusively of the type of dull illustrations seen in old history textbooks, many of them black and white, with a lot of repetition. The narrator is not a professional; my guess is that he is the producer of this film. His voice is monotonous; he sounds like he's reading from a long, dull term paper. The music is rather dull chamber music. This was so boring, even I had trouble paying attention, and I think Thomas Jefferson is a fascinating historical figure.

I don't know what the producer of this film thought he was creating or who he though his audience is, but the result, this tepid and monotonous film, is certainly not worthwhile.",1206921600,15,749,4.674242424242424
