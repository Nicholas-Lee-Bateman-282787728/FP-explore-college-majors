7368283,3,B013LWX67W,"these are packed so tightly that Night & Day is barely watchable.  Already damaged out of the box. So Sad, the other three were OK, Mr and Mrs Smith had some areas that were skippy.  Good price, but now I have to replace one of them anyway, so maybe not such a good price. ?",1461715200,,274,3.963636363636364
7368284,4,B013LWX67W,"4 Spy movies in one box. Full of action and a bit of comedy these four movies will entertain most of the family. Mr. and Mrs. Smith are a married couple that are spies that think their spouse is a normal working person.  When they have a contract to do a hit on each other, things get real interesting. Knight and Day has Tom Cruise is a spy that has gone rogue, and when he falls for a lady his world is turned upside down. This Means War has two spies fighting over the same woman. Whenever one goes on a date the other keeps track of them and things get weird and funny. Date Night has a couple start out on a normal date and then one thing after another goes sideways. All four movies are quite entertaining. I personally enjoyed Knight and Day and This Means War so much I go back and watch them over regularly.",1454630400,,816,4.132075471698113
