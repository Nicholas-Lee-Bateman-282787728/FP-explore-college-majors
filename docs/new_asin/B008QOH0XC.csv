8529711,4,B008QOH0XC,"I bought this to learn about Nostradamus, who is covered in detail in this dvd.  I didn't expect to learn about anyone else of interest--but I did.  Billy Meier is also a very intriguing character.  The entirety of this seeks to inform about how we are certainly living in the end times. It seems so obvious, you can feel it, but people still need facts to believe.  This presents facts",1383177600,,386,4.4714285714285715
8529712,4,B008QOH0XC,I didn't realize when I ordered this that it was a 3 disc collection so that was a cool surprise. I watched this over a couple of weekends. Enlightening to say the least.,1362960000,,170,4.181818181818182
8529713,2,B008QOH0XC,"This three disc series is not any new production.  It is simply the repackaging of three movies that already existed.  Disc 2 is the Billy Meier Story, which is an interesting film, but I already own that one.  So I was disappointed to say the least.  Disc 1 is just a film with the basic regurgitated Nostradamus story.  That's good too , but I've heard it so many times. I was looking forward to seeing some new prophecies from some different people but that is not in this collection.",1352764800,,487,4.426966292134831
