4463695,5,B004SKIPS2,"I witnessed the event on this DVD as it happened both on Tv and on my scanner radio. That was one hell of a scary thing to see. I remember how frantic the police were to get innocent bystanders out of the way and figure out how to stop him. No one can know for sure what was in the poor man's mind when he stole that tank but with this documentary you get a great deal of insight into his life and why he might have done it. An very well done video. It certainly was very lucky he had no ammo/shells for the big gun. If he had had some there's no telling what might have happened. As i watched this i remembered the famous ""Killdozer"" incident too.",1431734400,,648,3.9923076923076923
4463696,5,B004SKIPS2,"Wow! What an extraordinary film! Every bit as expository of our system's total corruption and indifference toward its own population as ""Roger and Me"" -- with a real eye toward the growing trend toward violent repression by our police forces. Don't miss it!",1418428800,2,257,5.0
4463697,4,B004SKIPS2,"That's what the neighbors say about this speed freak who stole a tank and went on an urban rampage in San Diego.  And oh, he also was digging a gold mine in his suburban back yard, with a shaft 17 feet deep!  But he was just a regular guy!
A fascinating glimpse of a lower middle class suburb in the 1990s, where everyone is descending into the gloomy depths of drugs and/or alcohol.",1387929600,6,383,4.232876712328767
4463698,5,B004SKIPS2,"This is a fascinating documentary about the world and San Diego, Calif.  It takes the news story of a plumber who drove a tank on the highway and was shot by police and opens it up into a much larger exploration of post-industrial malaise in America.

The documentary shows how meth spread to San Diego via imperial wars such as Vietnam.  There's also some interesting commentary by a cop there about how meth is a lower middle class drug because it appeals to the idea of self-reliance.  Thus, meth emerges as a drug both imperial and Emersonian.

I found it especially interesting how we meet the tank driver, Shawn Nelson's, friends and neighbors and get to know them before we realize that they're meth users/ addicts.  Especially poignant is the repeated testimony that there were lots of guys who wanted him to show them how to become plumbers too.  There's a real sense of being stuck and locked in at the bottom here.

The essays are also excellent.  They put the film into context.  It would be a great film to use in a class discussing Mike Davis' City of Quartz or any of the books on the use of American urban space for control and surveillance.",1344643200,10,1157,4.545893719806763
4463709,5,B004SKIPS2,"Sure, he was a nutty tanker but he was unnecessarily killed. Why:
No ammo for the 105mm main gun and no one to load or shoot while he was driving
No co-ax machine gun
No fifty cal. mounted in the cupola.
The tank was bellied and immobile when they shot him
Should have been able to subdue him with non-lethal force.",1473552000,,315,4.180327868852459
4463710,4,B004SKIPS2,Always wondered what happened here and this gave me a lot of insight.,1472774400,,69,4.384615384615385
4463711,1,B004SKIPS2,"Nonsensical attempt to canonize a seriously misguided/mentally ill meth-head who stole fed. property as the saint of, what, Polk County, FL? (Yeah, I know this story does not take place in Polk, County, FL). This ""documentary"" really sucks. Inconsistent & uninentertaining, with unidentified (often, in critical instances) characters, prepare for a schlocky waste of time.",1470355200,,372,5.781818181818182
4463712,2,B004SKIPS2,This is not a documentary its a collage of news footage that if you live in So Cal as I do you saw it all...no  new insight at all unless there are still some people that are not aware that METH SUCKS!,1469664000,2,201,3.7857142857142856
4463713,2,B004SKIPS2,"Does not take a rocket scientist to see most if not all of these characters are meth addicts. The female who is most prevalent in this terrible doc is definitely "" tweaking"" during every conversation.  Pitiful doc.....",1466121600,7,218,4.891891891891892
4463714,2,B004SKIPS2,"A bit of interesting material but mostly nonsensical interviews with local metheads, as some other reviewer has noted. ANd no, it doesn't explain what he's doing riding around in a tank.",1465603200,5,186,5.032258064516129
4463715,2,B004SKIPS2,Watch this. It's BORING.,1463270400,,24,5.25
4463716,5,B004SKIPS2,"Unfortunately, the director, Garrett Scott, died soon after finishing this film.  A freak ""accident"" or something more sinister.  His research into the shady side of San Diego might have ruffled the wrong feathers.  Read ""Chameleo"" to find out the rest of the story.",1463097600,2,266,5.1395348837209305
4463717,1,B004SKIPS2,A chamber of commerce documentary on the growth and death of the suburbs. Great...all I care about is the tank rampage but there is very little about that in this movie. Nice opportunity to listen to a bunch of loser meth heads though...,1462924800,2,237,4.534883720930233
4463718,1,B004SKIPS2,"Absolutely the worst documentary film I have ever watched. The gist of the story could have been told in ten minutes. Local meth head loses his family, his house and his mind  then goes on a last ride in a sixty ton tank to prove.. you decide because the film makers never make that point clear. Instead they pad on thirty minutes or more film to suggest (stretching a point so thin that it breaks instantly) that Hitler, WWII, and the economic downturn of the eighties all conspired to ruin Shawn Nelson's life. To back up this theory they interview every meth head they can find ad nauseam. Save your money.",1453593600,10,609,4.486486486486487
8439883,3,B004SKIPS2,"It's more of an inside look at the rotting innards of our empire. Really don't learn much, but you get to see the effects of meth on white blue collar America. The attempts to link this to war are quite superficial and do not stand up under scrutiny. I could argue that even without war, an industrial society would have addiction problems. I did like the DEA agent observing that crystal meth is the drug of choice for DIY individualists.",1523232000,,439,4.5
8439884,5,B004SKIPS2,"This documentary is what happens when the government gang stalks people. The quote near the end of the story about how Shawn would be in one part of town and over hear people talking about the same stuff he was just talking about in private to friends. And would then be on the opposite side of town and people would be talking about this same thing. Thats the truth behind where all our tax money goes. Testing military tactics on unknowing addicts. We are supposed to be free people, yet this shows what happens when your lively hood is taken away, drug culture is pushed and faith is stripped from man.",1522972800,,605,4.45945945945946
8439885,3,B004SKIPS2,My husband remembered this story more than I did.  It was an okay program.  I'm glad I watched it.,1522022400,,98,4.105263157894737
8439886,1,B004SKIPS2,"Tedious film.  Watching his drug addled pals trying to explain how the idiot who stole the tank was really a good guy leaves me wondering why I bought this crap.  A lot of the video taken during the rampage wasn't even used.  I remember well how the jackass repeatedly rammed a bridge support trying to knock it down, and they used none of this material. Rather, I had to listen to half an hour of useless history regarding the aircraft industry in San Diego.",1520985600,2,459,4.440476190476191
8439887,3,B004SKIPS2,"Entertaining as I used to live in Clairemont.  Production quality and research could be a lot better but with so many clear drug users to interview it would be difficult to punch up.  Also ""A Suburban War Story"" as the tagline is a bridge too far.  Spoiler alert: man steals tank as revenge against city because he wasn't getting mineral rights to the gold he believed was buried in the backyard of his suburban house where he dug a super deep hole.  Some people attempt to argue that he was not on meth - good luck with that.",1515196800,2,526,4.336734693877551
8439888,4,B004SKIPS2,"In 1995 a man who with many issues (drugs, joblessness, parental deaths and possibly more) troops down to the local National Guard Armory and hijacks a tank! For twenty three minutes he runs rough shod over cars, streetlights, and anything else he encounters along the way.

Weaved into his...rampage is a history of the San Diego area, its former prosperity associated with the Defense Department and that with the loss of those high paying jobs much of the area is plagued with drug use. Interviews with family, friends, neighbors, and police as well as actual footage of the occurrence.",1508025600,2,589,4.94949494949495
8439889,5,B004SKIPS2,"Priceless 90s moment flashback. Some of the best helicopter footage of that decade's signature slow motion car chase. They family and friend interviews are extra special. The movie needs subtitles for English-Speaking watchers. Although, part of the fun is trying to figure out what these people are trying to say.",1499817600,,314,5.3
8439890,5,B004SKIPS2,Enjoyable short film but rent it from the library for free.,1497830400,,59,4.454545454545454
8439891,1,B004SKIPS2,So this thing cost 14$ and is 57 minutes long. A pathetic meth head stole a tank and went rampaging around town. I just saved you 14 dollars and 57 minutes of your life.... Your welcome,1494115200,,185,4.166666666666667
8439892,2,B004SKIPS2,"No clear reason is ever given; just a mixed bag of wackadoos, druggies, conspiracy nuts, and the occasional disparaging cop spouting opinions and ideas about what they think made him do it. A waste of my time, so I  am glad I watched it with a free trial of sundance!",1481414400,2,267,4.34
