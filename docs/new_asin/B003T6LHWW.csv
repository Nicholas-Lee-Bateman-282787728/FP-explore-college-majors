4190174,5,B003T6LHWW,"This is the ultimate collection for those of us that grew up in the 60's and 70's. For me it isn't the holidays without the peanuts and this collection gives us those great classics in stunning blu-ray. The bonus features are a nice addition, giving us 3 more episodes of the gang and who doesn't like more peanuts. I would have liked a complete holiday collection that included the easter beagle, be my valentine charlie brown and happy new year charlie brown though. Maybe a future collections of those is coming.  Overall though this is a great set to walk down memory lane with and to share with your kids.",1289260800,,610,4.545454545454546
4190175,2,B003T6LHWW,"The video quality of these specials on Blu-ray is, as was the case with the release of Charlie Brown Christmas last year, simply the best these specials have ever looked on home video, period.  That would make them an instant purchase, if only...

Warner Home Video remastered the audio of all these specials with a very cheesy faux 5.1 surround, giving the audio a hokey, echo-filled sound that just sounds very, very wrong.  They sound as if they were processed through a ""faux surround"" mode found on the cheapest surround processor available.

Worse, because there is an echo added to the tracks, even if your processor or TV has a ""mono"" mode you CANNOT restore the audio to the original mono soundtrack most of us have heard for years, meaning that if you buy these for any kind of decent experience you need to WATCH the Blu-ray but sync up the DVD release for the AUDIO.

Warner Home Video could have EASILY included the original mono soundtracks as well, but decided that hokey fake surround would be a better choice, so ironically, sound quality-wise the mono Spanish audio tracks are BETTER.

As most of the reviews concentrate on the VIDEO quality of these releases, you likely would never know until you placed these discs in your player, hit play and wondered just what went wrong with the sound.

I can't say to stay away - I'll keep mine for the video quality and because I doubt I could get a decent price for these on the second-hand market - but be warned that if you are expecting that sound you've heard from years of TV runs or on the DVDs, you'll be SORELY disappointed.

Update:  Note the 2011 release of this collection features the same horrid 5.1 DD mix as the earlier release.  Stay away if you like the audio until WB gives us the original English 1.0 track back...",1288051200,207,1794,4.578125
4190176,3,B003T6LHWW,"I purchased this set through amazon and received it today (October 7th, 2010). Prior to purchasing this set, I also owned the standard peanuts holiday dvd set that was released a few years ago.  I purchased the blu-ray dvd set because I thought they would be a better quality than the former.  Honestly, I do not see any difference in the quality of the blu-ray dvds in comparison to the standard dvd set.  My blu-ray player has an upconverter and so the standard dvds are upconverted to a better quality.  I reviewed both sets (blu-ray and standard) and honestly could not tell a difference between the two (in terms of quality).  So, for those who own the standard dvd set and question whether it is worth the money upgrading to blu-ray, if I were to offer any advice, it would be to save your money...that is unless you're into collecting blu-ray dvds and feel the need to obtain this set for its special features.

To be fair, I found that the special features make up for some of the lack in quality of the blu-ray dvds.  It is interesting to learn about the histoy of each holiday specials and how the Christmas special was almost never produced.  For the special features and the amount I paid for this set ($34.99), I didn't feel too bad about the purchase.  I am disappointed in the quality but found that the special features make up for some of that disappointment.

Again, the quality of the dvds are not as great as I had hoped, but the special features are worth the consideration.",1286409600,36,1495,4.5241635687732344
4190177,2,B003T6LHWW,"While I'm as much a fan of the peanut specials as the next guy, here there's only three half-hour specials, which isn't much of a collection. Where's the second Christmas special, Valentine's Day, Easter, even Arbor Day?

If ALL the holiday specials were included, I'd snap it up. With just the three everybody's seen a bajillion times already, I'll stick to the library. There were over 30 animated specials produced; why not release them all in one giant collection instead of releasing them in 'collections' of two or three at a time? Sorry, Charlie.",1286150400,5,553,4.882978723404255
4190178,4,B003T6LHWW,"Warner has done a wonderful job remastering these time-tested classics, cherished by both
the young and the young at heart. Beginning with ""It's the Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown"",
this is the hands-down best looking version out there. Nicely restored intro and exits
from the original commercial spots are a highlight too! Many versions actually lop-off
cues, which was horrible to me. Even that hard splice just before THE END pops up is fixed!
The improved definition is noticeable right away with the opening scene where Lucy plops
the pumpkin down on the living room rug before carving into it. The rug pattern presents
a complex pattern, which looked either normally washed out or has a moire' pattern (on dvd).
Here it is rock-steady! The original mono audio should have been included though, as the
creation of a stereo surround mix actually muffles it's clarity.

  For ""Thanksgiving"" the overall image is more subdued and soft, but that is how I always
remember it. The added clarity and color are strong and make a solid impression. This is
a close second to the Halloween special, but holds a special place in my heart. The audio mix
is much better this time around, although would it have killed Warner to include the mono track?
You get a second Special: ""The Mayflower Voyagers"" which is always welcome!

  ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" is the crown in the collection and looks quite nice on Blu Ray!
There is a fair amount of print damage, so expect that. Audio is decent, but still falls
rather flat. No version (including this one) offers the complete original broadcast version.
But the majority of the cuts were sponsor trims (Coca-Cola was the first sponsor).
The scene where the kids are throwing snowballs at a can (of Coca-Cola originally)is here,
but has a generic label can now. Linus crashing into a fence with a Coke sign
is still MIA.  This message driven Special has always worked, but it rings even more true as
the times get more challenging. A true classic in every sense of the term. The ""collection""
on Blu Ray is a much better value than buying them individually, as it will cost nearly twice
as much buying them singly. No Holiday tradition is richer than sharing these classics with the
family each year. The inclusion of ""It's Christmastime again, Charlie Brown"" is a welcome addition.",1278028800,,2320,4.828715365239295

4190193,5,B003T6LHWW,"In honor of A Charlie Brown Christmas's 50th anniversary (on December 9th, 2015), here's a review of the rare 6-disc combo set of ""the big 3"" Peanuts specials, complete with bonus features that're the same on both formats. All 3 DVDs are reissues of the original 2008 Remastered Edition releases, but all 3 Blu-ray discs are new, but with no commercials at all on the Halloween and Thanksgiving discs; the Christmas Blu-ray disc automatically plays A Charlie Brown Christmas after revised commercials for this set only on DVD & one for Charlie and Lola. Whether you grew up watching ""the big 3"" or you're just seeing them for the very first time, this set truly is a must-own, be it a DVD set, Blu-ray set, or this 6-disc combo pack; 2 discs per case. However in 2014, The Mayflower Voyagers & It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown have been dramatically restored for This is America, Charlie Brown & the 50th anniversary DVD of A Charlie Brown Christmas, in a similar manner to the Looney Tunes Platinum Collection, but they still appear great in this collection, even on Blu-ray! All 3 sets in this collection contain behind-the-scenes short documentaries about how the feature programs came to be, including important bits with Bill Melendez, who sadly passed on the same day The Great Pumpkin became a Remastered Edition DVD by itself (September 2nd, 2008). A Charlie Brown Christmas has become one of the greatest and longest-running Christmas specials of all time, right behind Rudolph, due to its lessons about Christmas and commercialism and its timeless universal appeal. It's The Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown is THE longest-running Halloween special of all time, and saved the Mendelson/Melendez studio from ""going belly-up"" as my mother puts it, and will turn 50 in 2016! (Its documentary proves blockbusters aren't just for movie theatres or the old movie rental place!) When I typed this, it was around Thanksgiving, and A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving was said NOT to be seen every year since it first aired, like the first 2 holiday classics I mentioned, but like those 2, it HAS been seen on ABC every year since 2001! This one proves Thanksgiving isn't just about big dinners, traditional and otherwise, but for giving thanks for what we have, and for being together. The bonus specials are a hoot in themselves, if you remember them being televised on Nick from 1998 to 2001 or so; Its Magic, Charlie Brown is how Snoopy took up magic and made Charlie Brown invisible in his magic show, allowing him to finally kick the football from Lucy (obviously unseen)! The Mayflower Voyagers was the first of 8 specials for the miniseries, This is America, Charlie Brown, and lets the Peanuts gang take part in the famous voyage of the Mayflower and in everything that led to the first Thanksgiving. And last but not least, It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown was originally on VHS only at Shell gas stations, just before being seen only once on CBS in 1992, and possibly on Nick obviously more often that that. The 2 later Christmas specials, in Snoopy's Holiday Collection DVD, have been on ABC every year since they first aired (unedited AND otherwise!), but have NEVER shown the 1992 Peanuts Christmas classic. But I digress, it features Charlie Brown selling Christmas wreaths before Turkey Day and trying to buy the Little Red-haired Girl (known as Peggy Jean here) a $25 pair of gloves for her Christmas present, as well as Peppermint Patty and Marcie being in a Christmas play, and Sally saying ""hockey stick"" instead of ""Hark!"" in said play, similarly to the first-third of the last episode of the Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show, which is also in Snoopy's Holiday Collection. All 6 classics and 3 documentaries look and sound amazing on DVD AND Blu-ray; both separate versions have recently been reissued in single DVD/Blu-ray cases, but it's still great to own this 6-disc combo pack as it is, even though it doesn't mention having DVD copies in it; it only mentions the Blu-ray discs! No home video collection should be without ""the big 3"", especially for families, and for toon experts like me, hence my nickname here! Good grief, what a set this is!",1416873600,3,4172,4.885754583921016

4190203,5,B003T6LHWW,Every holiday season we have made a tradition of watching the Peanuts holiday specials on TV. Of course we would miss numerous episodes.

I have the 6 disc version which I do not believe they sell anymore, but don't be too bummed as the real selling point is the blu ray high def versions of the old classics.

A CHARLIE BROWN THANKSGIVING is a nice bonus but the special itself doesn't quite stand up to the level of the previous two.  The actual bonus features accompanying the 3 DVDs in this set are enjoyable and informative, but everything really rides on the two main features as far as true value is concerned.  All of the specials look and sound great.

As prices for these DVDs tend to fluctuate, when I purchased this item it was at roughly $20.  The individual specials tend to sell right around $15 to $18 a pop, so if you can snag this collection when it's around the price I got it for you should be very satisfied.",1324252800,,793,4.360544217687075

The only drawback I would say to this set is that for the money, you really don't get a lot of content.  Each special is roughly a half our long.  You get a bonus episode on each disc but, once again, price could seem a bit steep if you don't know what you are getting.
