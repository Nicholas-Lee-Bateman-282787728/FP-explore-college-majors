332059,4,6301464303,"3 1/2 stars
A juicy comedy on the sexual foibles of the rich, that doesn't take itself too seriously. It was made by the just deceased (2000, when this was originally written) Paul Bartel (Eating Raoul), and obviously inspired by Paul Mazursky's (who plays a cameo role) own 1986 comedy, Down and Out in Beverly Hills, which was itself a remake of Jean Renoir's 1932 farce, Boudu Saved from Drowning. Jacqueline Bisset heads a motley crew of a cast. Much of the film's charm is due to Stanley Myers' (The Deer Hunter) excellent score, especially his ""bed rondo.""",1051660800,2,562,4.744897959183674
332060,5,6301464303,"From the clever mind of writer/director/actor Paul Bartel comes this hysterical, yet screwed-up view of one weekend in the lives of two Beverly Hills households. Revolving around a fading British soap opera star, Clare (Jacqueline Bisett), her recently-divorced neighbor Lisabeth (Mary Woronov) and their butlers (Ray Sharkey and Robert Beltran), the story involves every major and minor character in subplots that intervene with one another.
Featuring an all star cast with such stars as Ed Begley, Jr., Wallace Shawn, Paul Mazursky, and Arnetia Walker, the film goes through many hysterical, yet wickedly delicious turns. The most memorable one is the twisted, diabolical film opening that involves murder (it turns out to be a dream). Arnetia Walker is wonderful as the trashy, yet funny Aunt Tobel who happens to be the mistress who ruined Lisabeth's marriage to her gynecologist husband (Shawn).
The film features one of the most beautiful piano scores I have ever heard. Along with Arnetia Walker's powerful, stirring renditions of two classic songs (""Natural Woman"" and ""Let's Misbehave""), the film's soundtrack is memorable. It is a great shame that it was never released.
With themes involving homosexuality, bisexuality, pornography, sado-masochism, this film will not be appealing to conservatives who can't enjoy a wonderful farce of life among the rich, snobbish community known as Beverly Hills. Paul Bartel who directed, wrote, and starred in the film did an superb job of poking fun at one of America's most recognizable communities. Like many present-day comedy directors such as the Farrelly Brothers and Keenan Ivory Wayans, Bartel pushed the limits of good taste and morality with this film. The results will have most rolling on the floor laughing.
On a sad note, two of the film's stars died shortly after the film's release. Rebecca Schaeffer who played Clare's daughter, Xandra, was murdered by an obsessed fan. Ray Sharkey, passed away from complications of AIDS. Their performances will live on on what I consider one of the best farce's of the 20th Century.",1038960000,22,2084,5.2990936555891235

332062,5,6301464303,"After seeing ( and loving) ""Eating Raoul"" with these 2 geniuses, this movie just added to my devotion. The bonus in both movies is Robert Beltran- who was drop-dead gorgeous... what ever became of him?
 The ...price tag for an old, used movie nearly scared me off, I guess it was worth it. It really is a terrific, hilarious movie.",1021593600,5,331,4.516666666666667
332063,4,6301464303,"I was amazed to see Robert Beltran has great comic flare. For once he didn't die, got the girl and acted like he was really enjoying the role which made me enjoy the movie more. Even a certain scene was tastefully done because of his relaxed acting style. Beautiful smile, glad to see it so often in this surprising well done little movie. Beltran handle himself well and I got to see glimpses of the Chakotay character that he at times brought to life so well on Voyager. If you like Beltran or more adult comedy this would be for you. Beltran and a few of his fellow actors from Eating Raoul seem very comfortable with each other and it shows. Not quite as dark as Eating Raoul but gives Beltran a chance to shine again. I think he succeeds without over acting or making the character of Juan look stupid.",999907200,5,807,4.3509933774834435
332064,4,6301464303,"Paul Bartel's funniest film after EATING RAOUL, SCENES FROM THE CLASS STRUGGLE IN BEVERLY HILLS is possibly his most clever as well. Featuring an all star cast the film starts with a bang and never lets up. Mildly schocking, extremely irreverant, not quite as dark as most of his other works, it still holds up well after several screenings. The direction is crisp, the music is first rate (especially two pieces for piano by Debussey) and the acting is all first rate. Especially terrific is Wallace Shawn. Often laugh out loud funny, this is one of Bartel's better movies and possibly one of the best comedies of recent years. Sort of a kinder and gentler John Waters, Bartel's delightfully wicked sense of humor certainly does have some bite. Very clever and more deserving of a reputation than it has. Worth a look for sure!",994896000,5,828,4.756944444444445
332173,3,6301464303,"A friend of mine had a video store and she gave me a copy of this movie.  I watched it with my mother! We thought it was hysterical and I immediately rewound it and watched it again!  I took it to my Uncle's-he watched it and ALSO immediately watched it again! Since then, I went on to lend it to various people and the majority of them thought it was hysterical.  The two people that didn't like it really hated it. And one girl I loaned it to never spoke to me again except to say that her husband loved it!  It's full of crazy twists and turns and it's very racy.  I think you should watch it for yourself, there were so many stars and plots going on. It's soo crazy to explain the plot but if you're not a prude, give it a shot.",1188691200,2,732,3.9863013698630136

332175,5,6301464303,"If there's one reason (even though there's plenty) to catch this hysterical flick set in the privileged homes of Beverly Hills it's Arnetia Walker's brilliant turn as ""Aunt"" Tobel. Watch her make friends with Jacqueline Bisset's dog Bojangles, watch her naughty porn appearance, watch her facial expressions...just watch her.

If Oscar loved to laugh, Walker and her brilliant timing would've taken home an Academy Award for her work here. Her suggestion to Wallace Shawn about what to do with ""a nice piece of corn off the cob"" is worth the price of admission. She even sings Let's Misbehave as the closing credits roll. Pure Magic!!!!

332178,5,6301464303,"Directed by and starring Paul Bartel of ""Eating Raul"" fame, SCENES FROM THE CLASS STRUGGLE IN BEVERLY HILLS is an outrageously funny comedy that will easily have you screaming with laughter if you have any sense of humor.

Set in a Beverly Hills mansion, this is an upstairs/downstairs story of a rich divorcee (Jacqueline Bisset) who temporarily moves in with a widowed friend (Mary Woronov) while her house is fumigated and two of their employees who have a wager on who will bed the other's employer first.

Co-starring Ray Starkey, Ed Begley, Jr., Wallace Shawn and the late Rebecca Schaeffer, the film boasts a colorful collection of eccentrics.  One of my favorites is Dr. Van Kamp (Paul Bartel) who plays a Beverly Hills diet doctor who heads up a scam charity called the ""Hunger Project"" and casually utters one of the film's most famous lines: ""When you get a bunch of rich fat people who are determined to get thin at any cost, some of them are going to die. It's a rule of thumb.""

Another favorite is Aunt To-Bel, an African-American gold digger played brilliantly by Arenthia Walker, who meets Peter (Ed Begley, Jr.) in Las Vegas and takes an entire weekend ""to really get to know each other"" before visiting Peter's sister in Beverly Hills.

If this film weren't so absurdly hilarious, some could take offense at what at times is a pretty raunchy film, but because SCENES FROM THE CLASS STRUGGLE IN BEVERLY HILLS is so playfully funny, there is nearly no chance that it will offend anyone with a sense of humor.  For this reason, I highly recommend this DVD.

that I have ever seen!
Back in 1990, when this movie came out on VHS,
a freind turned me on to it and told me
that I would love it's outrageous plot lines,
fiendishly clever humor and the expert acting of its
ensemble cast, and boy was he right!
I gufawed through the whole thing and almost
choked on my dinner at one point!---

332181,5,6301464303,"That is the question.  It resembles a French bedroom farce in some respects, but it is also a scathing satire of Hollywood mores and human foibles in general.  But most of all, it is a hilarious movie the likes of which a major film company would never produce.

The themes are adult.  This country seems to be incapable of making adult movies that appeal to adults.  It caters to a teenage mentality and the lowest common emotional/mental denominator.  This picture happily fills that gap.

Jacqueline Bissett, in the female lead, an actress trying to make a comeback is wonderful (but I am biased ... I am madly in love with her!).  Begley, Shawn, Sharkey, Schaefer and the rest of the cast are equally terrific and you have the feeling that they are an ensemble cast.  They really work well together.

The picture of the idle rich that the film portrays is not a very flattering one, and the servants are shown outsmarting them at one point.  Mmm... sounds like ""The Marriage of Figaro"".  But the film is never heavy-handed and never loses its deft touch not matter how outre the material.

This is not your typical Hollywood offering, and undoubtedly will offend some thin-skinned, conservative people.  But if you are a free-thinker with a good sense of humor, you are going to love this film.  Buy it!!!",1095120000,4,1309,4.704845814977974

This movie can be used as one of the best examples of why independent movies/directors are necessary in today's society. A comedy without being slapstick, I can watch this movie over and over again and still find myself laughing outloud. With Paul Bartel no longer with us (his death came much, much too soon), you need to watch this and discover a true genius who had been, unfortuantely, underappreciated in his lifetime.

7812232,2,6301464303,"My low rating for this DVD is strictly for the language problem with this specific Italian import and has nothing to do with the merit of the film, which I rate as five-star. The DVD's audio/subtitle choices are Italian DD 5.1, Italian Stereo, Italian Stereo with Subtitles, and English Stereo with Subtitles. The first problem is that when you select English, you do not always get the English version. You may have to try several times to get English. Second, when you do get the English version, you also get Italian subtitles which can not be turned off--at least I have been unable to do so. So you have to understand that the English Stereo with Subtitles means just that: WITH Italian subtitles. If any other customer has found a method to turn off the subtitles, please let me know.

Another complaint with this specific DVD release is the picture quality. Although I looked forward to a DVD release of this movie, my VHS to DVD transfer is as good or better than this release.

In summary, if you can overlook the Italian subtitles after getting the English language to work, you will enjoy this film, which I consider one of the best comedies.",1355270400,4,1153,4.647058823529412

In short, a weekend with two Beverly Hills families and friends and servants turn into a sex-fest with everyone in bed with whom they are NOT supposed to be with. Who knew that rich people had it so rough?! And in such a funny way. If only...

The DVD is Region 2, but if you have all-region player or know how to make a region-free copy, you're in business. Even well worth using a region change on a PC drive, if you have more than DVD drive. Sad that it's not released on DVD in Region 1 or Region Free.
