2896249,5,B000TAN8ZA,This is one of the most popular Korean Historical Dramas. I would recommend this to every American/Asian couple. This has all the drama a love a woman would want and it has plenty of battle scenes any guy would like. For all those American/Asian couples out there she can watch in Korean and the English subtitles are great. I understand a little Korean so I'm completely informed as to what is going on in the show. I bought all four volumes.,1229040000,2,443,4.481481481481482

8208544,5,B000TAN8ZA,"This series is long --- 80 episodes. But I never found it to be boring, it has always engaged me. While it's engaging and exciting, I have to admit that it drags sometimes. It's so obvious that they tried too hard to extend the series.",1374019200,,235,4.2444444444444445

8208547,5,B000TAN8ZA,They are trying to get those other guys out of their country and unite. I can get behind that. You would think the other princes would figure out that fighting Jumong is a losing proposition. This was great. I liked the arms race and the boys growing up to be better men concept. The mysticism is interesting. Make a better sword! Use your smaller numbers to better advantage. I enjoyed this a lot.,1334707200,,398,4.465753424657534
8208548,5,B000TAN8ZA,"This is the first Korean drama I ever watched and it still remains my favorite. Despite the length (81 episodes), it never failed to keep me interested. I became very fond of many of the characters and was sad when I finally watched the last episode. Many impressive battle scenes and a wonderful soundtrack.",1331683200,,308,4.722222222222222
8208549,5,B000TAN8ZA,"Finally, some of the bad guys get killed, and some of the Korean words are sinking in. However, Daeso's anger and Youngpo's shifty eyes are wearing thin.

Great color, great story. Can't get enough.",1303948800,,198,4.823529411764706
8208550,5,B000TAN8ZA,"You don't have to be an american/asian couple to enjoy this show. I come from an american multi-racial background and I absolutely love this show. I started renting Jumong vol 1. I realized very quickly that I was hooked and I could not stop watching until I saw all 7 discs of vol 1.  After that I had to buy vol 2, and 3(volume 4 is on the way)so that I would not get interrupted. For any serious movie goer it is simply a treat to watch a marathon of good storytelling.",1274486400,,472,4.130434782608695
