Plus the animation quality is excellent.  The music is great, and the best part are the characters. ^-^ hope u guys give this anime a chance, its the best.",1198886400,2,370,4.3478260869565215
2828663,4,B000PY30ZS,"If you liked My-Hime, you're gonna love this one, and if you've never watched it you're still gonna enjoy My-Otome regardless, because the stories are not related, so it's perfectly safe to start with this one.
  The music and the characters are beautifu and I think the story and the series in general are WAY better than My-Hime.  It's kind of weird because some of the original characters are also present in this one, but it's almost as if they were actors playing a different role, because some of them don't even have the same personality.
  If you were a fan of Shizuru from My-Hime, I HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU GET THIS ONE.  In My-Hime, she didn't have much of an influence on the story until the final episodes, but in this one, she is one of the most important characters and deservedly and effortlessly takes the spotlight on ocasion; just watching Shizuru fight in the first episode is worth the whole $21.99.  If you watch your Anime on a good sound system, I suggest you turn the volume all the way up, because the background music during this scene is absolutely mesmerizing, and combined with the sound effects, the art and the animation, will even give you chills; I'm not even joking.  If you don't know who Shizuru is, you'll fall in love with her watching this scene alone.
  You might as well consider this a 5-star review.  I'm not gonna tell you why I gave it 4 stars because first of all, I don't wanna spoil the scene for you, and second of all, it's highly a matter of personal preference, so a normal person probably wouldn't pay attention to it anyway.
  The bottom line is: if you're looking for a series with great music, beautiful characters, intense action and a gripping story, don't hesitate to get My-Otome.  It has something for everyone.",1188864000,10,1768,4.589171974522293

8193772,4,B000PY30ZS,"Arika dreams of becoming an Otome. On the planet Earl, Otome serve their master and country. They are considered a strong military power on their own, so they are very coveted by all the nations. Arika's mother was an Otome. In hopes of becoming one herself, Arika joins the Garderobe Academy. Garderobe Academy is where young women train to become Otome, but only a select few actually gain the honor. Here Arika gains new friends and enemies very quickly. Her unusual circumstances make her a controversial figure.

This is a pretty good start. It's not really a sequel to the original My Hime series. It has a similar plot, and some similar characters, but it's not connected to the events of the original. You can watch this one without seeing My Hime. At this point I've watched half of this series, and I prefer the My Hime series. I liked the character, Mai, better than the main character in this one, Arika. The characters in this show aren't as good as the 1st series. On the other hand, if you've seen My Hime and liked it, this one will probably make you happy as well.",1356307200,,1081,4.543589743589743
8193773,5,B000PY30ZS,"5 STARS because it is very funny with action/adventure,it is worth watching also it is done well & creative .ARIKA makes it funny with a few other characters. Now what i do not like is when they speak of deaths & wars. The prices was simple also.",1355961600,2,246,4.25531914893617
8193774,5,B000PY30ZS,"I enjoyed this Anime collection very much. You can find other reviews that will tell you all you could want to know about the story and content. So in summation it was amusing and enjoyable.
In its way as good as the original My-Hime. Buying from sellers of good used dvds I bought this collection for a price a little less than a collection box set would normally cost. The shipping cost can be reduced if you go directly to the sellers web site when ordering more than one item. Make sure you can trust them.",1253577600,,510,4.322916666666667
8193775,3,B000PY30ZS,"Alright first off, I am writing this review mainly comparing this series to it predecessor My-HiME (which has fairly similar characters but is completely unrelated otherwise).  Standalone, this series is pretty good I guess, but if you have seen My-HiME first, and come out of that one with high expectations for this one, you might be slightly disappointed.

Story:
My- Otome sets the basic plot in the first couple episodes with the typical layout.  Loudmouth, stubborn, and often clutsy main character wants to become an Otome.  For the next 8-10 episodes, there are little stories showing some of the events Arika goes thru on her journey to become an Otome.  These stories do not build on a bigger plot much at all and mainly introduce you to the vast cast of characters.  During this time the humor is very childish an repetitive, centering around everyone making fun of Arika hair (saying she looks like an ant), her complete lack of knowledge of the real world due to her isolated upbringing, and other mindless immature squabbles between characters.  The anime picks up in the second half, but by that time I found myself not liking the immature versions of the HiME characters that I already know and love.  The HiME series only spent 7 episodes introducing characters before diving into an immanse plot that kept you wanting more, right til the end.  I also found the humor in that one to be much more clever and over the top at times, rather than repeating the same few jokes over and over like in Otome.  Anyways moving on...

Characters:
Once again I was a bit letdown by most of the characters in My-Otome.  It's kinda hard to compare them to the HiME ones, because it seemed that the more minor a role they played in HiME, the more major a role they had in Otome and vice versa.  While I cannot compare any characters directly, I can say that the ones in HiMe had more deeper relationships with each other overall.  In Otome, Arika is your typical good natured girl, who doesnt think twice about helping people.  She has her grand dream of becoming an Otome, which nearly everyone else makes fun of her for because of her inexperience compared to everyone of the other girls in the academy.  Actually for Naruto fans, Arika and Nina are pretty much identical to Naruto and Sasuke in terms of personality and attitude towards each other.  I found that at the start I found myself not liking any of the main characters due to their dispositions.  As the main story started to progress in teh second half and the characters started 'growing up' and realizing a lot of things, I found myself liking them more, especially Mashiro when the story started focusing more on her and her issues (intently being vague here as not to give away spoilers).  Nevertheless, if you are looking for deep, touching moments in this anime that really make you feel what the character is going thru, there are a few, but nothing that compares to some of the most powerful ones in HiME (Mai's complete mental breakdown from traumatic events, Mikoto's choice between her friends and her family, the whole hidden relationship with Natsuki, and the whole part where the HiMEs didn't know if they could trust each other.  Those had a far more serious and emotional tone than anything in Otome).

Music:
The music in Otome was composed by the same person who did HiME (and Tsubasa Chronicles and Rozen Maiden).  The soundtrack was better in some ways and worse in others.  A lot of the music in more calm, mellow scenes felt slightly out of place at times, but was more lively than that of HiME where it was mainly calm piano tunes.  When I first heard the main battle theme of Otome (which is titled MATERIALISE!), I found the high pitched opera like vocals to be not only hard on the ears, but it made the whole song sound way out of place.  I did not like it at all, and prefered battles where they kept the instrumental portion of the song but got rid of the lyrics.  I ended up liking the song a bit more as I heard it a few times, but to this day I still don't like the lyrics.  The rest of the battle songs were pretty good, on par with most of the battle songs from HiME, but none of them could even come close to the song titled Mezame from HiME which is still one of the best anime songs that I have heard in any anime I have seen to this day.  I also really enjoyed Alyssa's song from HiME titled Only in Fairy Tales.  It had a creepy vibe to it, yet was calm and almost trance-like at the same time.

In summary, if you haven't seen My-HiME then you will probably enjoy My-Otome a lot.  If you have seen My-HiME then like me and most of my friends who have seen both, you might feel that Otome was missing something.  HiME I found was more geared towards an older, more mature audience.  It managed to blend in a lot of humor, and fun without ever taking away from the whole serious emotional-driven storyline at it's core.  Otome to me was the opposite.  It seemed more geared towards a younger teenage audience with it's childishly behaving characters and immature silly humor that was at times annoying and overused keeping me from getting completely into the characters and their problems whenever the series tried to take a more serious turn.",1217462400,,5246,4.538788522848034
