It's an entertaining movie if you ONLY want to watch it for the fight scenes... If you want more...this is not the movie for you.",1115510400,2,281,4.755102040816326

Let me just say that Donnie Yen is magnificent in this movie and all his fight scenes are great to watch. I place him up there with the magnificent four alongside Bruce Lee,Jet Li,and Jackie Chan. He's just so fast and I've never seen anyone kick as fluent and consistent as he does. The film...well, the plot is the usual Wong Fei Hung trying to rid of foreign opium traders and opium all together while a corrupt official tries to prevent that...Beggar So gets thrown in the middle and becomes an addict himself by the official, who wants to use Beggar So to kill Wong...plan fails, So gives up opium, and he join sides with wong..the movie's best fight scenes are only the ones with Donnie Yen...The actor playing Wong is kind of weak...not only that, but this movie gave a really bad portrayal of Wong...First off, Wong does't kill women regardles of whether they're bad(he killed 2)...Second, he doesn't look to kill willingly...In this movie, it seems like if someone needed to revenge his/her masters death against some official, Wong says, ""No prob...Don't worry""...huh?...historically, Wong is not this kind of person...and lastly, no one ever takes Wong's fights...although i was glad Donnie came in to interfere and fight the last guy, the real Wong doesnt allow that...stick with Jet for Wong Fei Hung portrayals...nonetheless, Donnie was great as usual, but what kept this far from 5 stars were the inconsistency of Wong, some bad acting, and a lot of nonsense moments...there tend to be fights for no reason at all...also, theres a really ugly and annoying bucktooth girl plus some guy with a mohawk haircut...id suggest viewing before owning because donnie has far more better flicks than this...check out iron monkey, tiger cage I and II (awesome), Once upon a Time in China 2 along side Jet, and Wing Chun w/ michelle yeoh...Heroes is more die hard fans...thanks for reading",1007942400,11,2026,4.858381502890174

Donnie Yen is masterful in this movie and the guy who plays Wong Fei Hung is better than i had expected.  This movie did not lack any quality fight scenes as there were plenty and very well done.  It is the same genre as the Once Upon a Time in China and Fong Sai Yuk series.  Little note: Check out OUATIC part 5 it is worth it.  Donnie Yen should be in the same status as Jet Li because he fights just as well and he is quick and powerful.  Hopefully, with Iron Monkey being released in the US, his Hong Kong movies will be released to the North American market, just like Jet Li's movies were after he did Romeo must Die.  Donnie does have a role in the upcoming Blade II with Wesley Snipes.  Anyways, is you are a fan of great kung fu fighting and the OUATIC type, then get this movie, it rocks.",1003449600,,942,4.114754098360656
7918950,5,B00003JRBY,"Heroes Among Heroes seems somewhat of a secret sequel to the Once Upon a Time series; it contains the same motives, almost all of the same exact characters who even looked very similar to the actors. However, you'll notice the difference with Yuen Woo Ping's touch of amazing visuals, classic humor and great action.
In this film, Donnie Yen plays Beggar So, a rich, righteous, and rebellious son who prefers hanging out with the beggars. The conflict centers around the contraversal use of Opium, and eventually, Beggar So runs into heated conflicts with the villagers, gangs, government and drugs. The best action scenes are towards the end (watch Donnie Yen's very cool ""drunken style"" very unique, he is so graceful and super fast).
I got a kick out of this movie, it goes on top with my other favorites like Iron Monkey. Good quality fighting. Good acting. Lots of action and comedy. Just try not to think too much of OUATIC, instead... keep your eyes on Donnie Yen...it worked for me!",981072000,6,990,4.795321637426901
7918951,4,B00003JRBY,"This is more of the same from the master Yuen,and is a movie that goes by his movie making guidlines which is throw together a mess of a movie and have some great fights in between,but hey I love most of these, and with  Donnie Yen at the lead it's well worth checking out with Donnie Yen pulling  off more amazing tricks like only Yuen can make him do. The fights are all  pretty good,but nothing classic except for maybe the last fight with the  bad guy played by xiong xin-xin (club foot from ounce upon a time in china)  where Donnie Yen uses his own version of the drunken style which looks  amazing. It's too bad Yuen can't make every movie as good as Tai-Chi  Master,Fire Dragon,or Iron Monkey,but alot of his silly ""throw  together a bunch of good fights movies"" can still blow most anything  else out of the water, even with a good story because no one can top his  choreography. So if you like Donnie Yen and don't mind sitting through some  silliness then definitley pick this one up.",960076800,4,995,4.382513661202186
