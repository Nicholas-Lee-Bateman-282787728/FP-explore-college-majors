7659234,5,B01BKTG026,"Never have I had as much fun working out as I do with Jessica Smiths routines!!!  Over the years, I have transitioned back and forth from different trainers, programs and workout styles, but never have I found as much satisfaction, happiness, and the results Ive sought, than what I get when I use Jessicas workout DVDs and programs.

Having purchased, and done every DVD release and YouTube routine Jessica has released, I oftentimes wonder before I purchase, if each new DVD will be an added investment and benefit to my goals, or will the newer DVDs simply be a rehash or previous moves/exercises.  Each time I am surprised!  This DVD is unique and special in and of itself!  I am glad I made the choice to add this DVD to my collection.  This DVD, comprised of multiple short walks (including warm up, cooldown and stretching segments) to be one of the MOST EXCITING, ALL-INCLUSIVE (Jessicas larger workout sets/programs excluded) systems shes released that incorporates short mix and match routines.

This DVD set comes in a study, hard-shell case and includes a 5 minute Warm Up and 6 individual walking routines that include cardiovascular work, strength training for upper and lower body, as well as total body, standing abdominal work, tabata style intervals as well as a 5 minute cooldown and bonus 5 minute stretching segment.  The routines (warm up/cooldown/stretch excluded) are 12-16 minutes from start to finish.

The start menu includes and Introduction with Jessica, explaining the various routines on the DVD and includes the option to customize your workout, mixing and matching as many routines, in whatever order, youd like for the day, or you have the option to play all of the routines.

The routines include a 3-Fitness-Level Option as with most of Jessicas routines.  Again, we see Jessicas Mom, Debbie, performing the low impact and modified options, and Beth, on performing the advanced options, including higher impact.  Jessica demonstrates the intermediate moves.

The set is the same as Jessicas previous Walk Strong series,  from what appears to be a high-rise apartment with wide windows, showcasing a variety of Miami weather, including sunshine, rain and fog, while traffic moves in the back ground (dont worry, its not distracting).  The set and outfits are colorful enough to be interesting, without be distracting.  There is no abundance of exposed skin and the body types shown are realistic, and motiving.  Jessica and crew are peppy, maintain smiles throughout.  As with all of her releases, Jessicas careful cueing, bubbling personality and energy make the DVD what it is.  No drill-sergeant cuing, no yelling and she does EVERY SINGLE MOVE WITH YOU!

Included as a count down timer that starts from the beginning of the workout, and counts down to the end of the routine.  NOTE:  You cannot turn off the timer, and this may be a distraction to some people.  Personally, I was having so much fun, I didn't even notice it.

The music is excellent, and NEW!  No repeats from previous DVDs.  The music is more electronic/dance style with hints of 90s/2000s dance songs in the beat of the moves.  Songs speed up and down depending on the move you're doing.  Really fun.  The music is simply instrumental, no voices so as to have no distraction.

EQUIPMENT REQUIRED: You will need a study set of walking shoes, approximately 3x5 feet of space, a flat resistance band, yoga mat, or soft surface, and a chair (for the stretching segment)

This DVD is a valuable addition to ANY Jessica Smith fan, and would be a great DVD for those who have progressed from her earlier walking DVDs, and are looking for something that is a bit more.  It would also be a great DVD for anyone just starting out with Jessica Smith who may not be wanting to invest in a pricier DVD set, but still wanting to get the benefit of a total body system.

***********************************
I am providing a Walk By Walk review including caloric burn of each routine below.  Please note, I am a 35 year old female, and an intermediate to advanced exerciser weighing approximately 145 pounds.  I used a Polar FT4 heart rate monitor to measure my caloric expenditure for each routine.  Your calorie burn may differ from mine based on your fitness level, starting weight, age, and other individual factors.
**********************************

Warm Up (5 minutes):  35 calories burned, typical warm up including walking in place, side to side movements, and focus on the warming up the major joints including the shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, ankles and the feet to prepare you for the walks to come.

Mile 1; Steady Burn (15 minutes):  160 calories burned. My favorite of the cardio routines.  This one starts off fast right out of the gate and keeps going until the finish.  This walk is a mix of some of Jessicas standard moves (side to side movements and grape-vines with clapping, hamstring curls etc), and fun combinations and mixes of different moves using upper and lower body at the same time.  Everything is worked from arms, to abs, to legs PLUS balance and agility.  5/5 stars.

Mile 2; Upper Body Sculpt (15 minutes): 130 calories burned.  This routine really works your arms!  I felt I got as much benefit using the simple, cheap resistance band as I would have using my heavier, and pricier set of dumbbells.  This workout was done in super set fashion, with multiple sets of exercises including 2-3 moves, then repeating.  This routine was not simply upper body, the lower body, including the core, and back were worked all in conjunction with each other.  A few of the moves include bicep curls standing on the band, triceps while working the hamstrings at the same time,  and bow and arrow pulls with plie squats.  5/5 Stars.

Mile 3; Lower Body Toner (15 minutes): 120 calories burned.  This routine had a lower body focus, but was extremely joint friendly!!  I loved that, as I have a tendency to experience knee pain with other workouts.  The band was used for side to side movements that worked the outer thighs, side lunges to work the glutes and hamstrings as well as sneaky upper body movements.  There was some balance work as well.  The last 5 minutes of the routine were done on the floor, with the band, and included pilates-inspired moves including clams to work the outer thighs more, inner thigh work, and hip bridges.  I will be feeling this tomorrow!!  5/5 Stars.

Mile 4; Cardio Interval Abs (15 Minutes): 150 calories burned.  LOVE LOVE LOVED this routine!  If you're a fan of Jessicas older Cardio Abs DVD this is very reminiscent.  Jessica includes 3 sets of moves, with a tabata style interval in-between lasting roughly 2 minutes.  This routine works your core 360 degrees THE WHOLE TIME!  NOT ONCE do you get on the floor to do ab work!  I love that.  Lots of standing moves incorporating upper body twists, knee raises, punches, and the legs!  5/5 stars.

Mile 5; Total Body Tune Up (15 Minutes): 145 calories burned.  If you want a routine that does it all, this is the one to pick.  You will see a lot of the same moves from the Upper Body and Lower Body Miles, as well as some repeat of some of the ab exercises, with the addition of other movements focusing on balance and stability.  Movements again are done in superset fashion, with 2-3 different exercises, repeated in a set twice, then you move onto a new set of moves.  You need the flat resistance band for this walk.

Mile 6; Speed Walk (12 Minutes): 115 calories burned.  Get in and get it done!  This routine is similar to Jessicas YouTube walking routines, but faster paced, it is mostly comprised of moves you normally see in your other walking routines, side to side steps, hamstring curls, grapevines, cheerleader arms.  Super upbeat, fast, and fun!

Cooldown: (5 minutes): 35 calories burned.  A complete cooldown while walking at a slower pace, to bring your heart rate down.  Not a lot of stretching, but that is including in the short stretching routine.

Stretch (5 Minutes):  Incorporates a high-backed chair to help with balance with stretching the glutes, hamstrings, inner thighs, back, shoulders, arms.  So refreshing!  Dont skip this one.",1456876800,175,8165,4.843094721619668
7659235,5,B01BKTG026,"I have all of her workouts and will continue to add any new ones she does to my collection.  I love the mix and match option and also that there is an added bonus stretch session.  This is perfect to add on to her other workouts.  This morning I did the Cardio Interval Abs after I completed the Cardio Core Walk from one of her earlier videos.  I am amazed how she can come up with similar types of workouts, but still keep them fresh and with new moves and I think they just keep getting more fun.  I plan on using the workouts on this video as add ons to her other workouts....I have been working out with Jessica for a couple of years now and am able to do all the advanced moves with heavier weights, so now I am ready to increase my workout time.  But, you can also use each of the 6 miles as a stand alone workout with the warm up and cool down, or mix them up.  It would also be fun to do the entire thing at once.  You have a lot of choices.  This video, along with her other videos are perfect for any fitness level and also gives you a great variety.",1456790400,14,1061,3.9669811320754715
7659236,5,B01BKTG026,I just got it and am watching it now.  I love the music!!!!  It is at the perfect sound level. I was disappointed in the music on her Walk Strong 6 Week Transformation. Those workouts you can't hear the music and her voice is too loud. The music really helps to motivate me and keep me going. Thanks for getting it perfect on this.  The workouts look great. I will update after I have done them all.,1456617600,8,399,4.1558441558441555
7659237,5,B01BKTG026,"Another great DVD from Jessica Smith! I love how you can program this DVD to play the segments you want to do. There are six different ones with a warm up and cool down. There is also an additional 5 minute stretch if you want to add that also. Each mile is different: some use a resistance band, some are faster, have an ab focus, or simply focus on the walk. However, her ""walking"" isn't just walking. She includes lots of different moves--none too complicated, but enough to keep it interesting. If you are one who gets bored by the walking workouts that are mostly just walking in place, you'll love the variety of this and any of Jessica's routines!",1532304000,,654,4.458333333333333

7659239,5,B01BKTG026,"Firstly, I've been exercising for what seems like a million years and have bought dozens of dvds.  I figure if I get bored I won't exercise hence the hundreds of  programs.  I been suckered into buying every piece of ""miracle"" ""motivational"" equipment (although some simply looked ridiculous so a big no go!).  I started  doing Leslie Sansone about 5 years ago and of course own all of hers.  I like the idea of low impact aerobics and Leslie certainly does too.  I really enjoy her workouts and feel like I really do get a good workout.  So, in my quest to overcome boredom I found this dvd.  I did three segments plus warm up, cool down and stretch today and YIKES...Fabuloso!  The first one I did was her #1 Steady Walk (15 minutes) and at the conclusion I was beginning to sweat.  I then moved on to her #2 Upper Body (15 minutes) that incorporated the use of a stretch band.  Well, normally, I use 2 bands together but NO WAY with her.  Not difficult, just challenging.  My arms ached when over....goodie!  My last was her #3 Lower Body (15 minutes).  This was really great.  Some standing and some on the floor (by this time I was getting pooped, so floor work was welcomed).  I completed with her Cool Down (5 minutes) and Stretch (5 minutes).  All concluded in about 1 hour.  Let me tell you I was dripping with sweat and feeling great!  Here's something I NEVER say...""Can't wait to do her again!""  Highly recommend for just about anyone...oh, and she's not some crazed, over zealous, unrealistic lunatic...very likeable....",1529280000,3,1533,4.6

7659242,3,B01BKTG026,"I really enjoy Jessica Smith work outs, but this one was not challenging enough and did not make me feel as if I were exercising.  I recommend her other work outs, Build Balance & Strength and Boost Metabolism & Muscle.",1528329600,,219,4.475

Great toning segments in this workout and love how the workout is structured.  You can do all or a little and she is excellent at showing all three levels with her Mom Debbie doing low impact and Beth showing high level with Jessica doing intermediate or high impact.  I have workouts by other instructors but have to force myself to mix it up because I like Jessicas style so much.",1517616000,2,539,4.583333333333333

7659262,5,B01BKTG026,"Love Jessica Smith! I have worked out for years at the gym and hardcore bootcamps and ended up burning out.  I was always sore,  my knees and ankles hurt and I had developed adrenal fatigue. My naturopath doctor told me to stop the intense workouts and just stay active,  he recommended walking more than anything.  Jessica Smith dvds make me feel great without killing myself. I love this dvd because it is simple but time flies because it is so upbeat.  I love the toning excercises too, I feel I am getting an all-around full body workout with this dvd without taxing my body! So far I have lost 6 lbs over the past month using her dvds and eating healthier. I have about 8 of her dvds and also the walk strong and walk on sets. I honestly cannot decide which is my favorite. They are all wonderful! You don't have to kill yourself at the gym to get in shape and that is why I love Jessica Smith so much! Plus, she is the most pleasant and genuine instructor our there, and you can tell she truly cares about her audience!",1514332800,6,1025,4.290155440414508

7659265,2,B01BKTG026,"I have mixed feelings about this DVD.  It definitely is not a walk dvd; the walking is incidental to working with the resistance band that is used throughout most of the six mile segments.  There are a variety of knee twisting movements throughout.  The pace is uniform through, that is, very fast.  I do give it two stars because the aerobic nature of the work here is really good.  The music is boring and repetitive.  On the bright side, Jessica's instructions are detailed, albeit fast.  Be ready to work hard especially if you have absolutely no knee problems.",1510617600,5,565,4.704081632653061

7659269,4,B01BKTG026,"I wish this dvd came with a resistance band since she uses one in this video.
I can't decide who i like better... Jessica's workouts  or Leslie's sansone.
In Jessica's workouts you do burn and sweat ALOT more and she does MANY MANY  more different moves than Leslie.

As for Leslie's videos she tends to go a little more slower  ( which is better for me ) and i like that there is a large group of people in her videos and plus the music is way better.
Though my heart rate doesnt beat as fast doing her videos.

As for now i will probably switch back and fourth between the two.",1504569600,6,579,4.133928571428571
7659270,5,B01BKTG026,"This is my second DVD by Jessica.  I really like her moves because they aren't the basic 4 steps that Leslie Sansone uses, although, I love Leslie's DVDs, I just wanted some variety.  As soon as I received this, I did it and I really liked it.  I like Jessica's workouts because her moves are different, challenging but still easy to do.  I really like her toning segments, they really fatigued my muscles I was using.  Her DVD doesn't come with the exercise band but, I had one from Leslie Sansone's DVD.  I also purchased one on Amazon, which is the 7 Ring Stretch and Resistance Exercise Band by FOMI.  I wanted a band that was more durable.  But I digress,  I really enjoyed this DVD and I actually was able to do all 6 miles because of the mix of cardio and toning segments.",1504483200,3,779,4.317241379310345

7659272,4,B01BKTG026,"I really like the cardio workouts, but I struggle with the ones that use the band.  I would find it easier to do toning workouts with weights.  However, I would give the three cardio segments 5 stars.  They are excellent.  With this video, you can mix and match your segments, so I usually just use the cardio ones.  This is worth the price just for the cardio.",1502755200,,361,4.3283582089552235
7659273,5,B01BKTG026,"A great workout no matter what age.  Easy on the joints and I can feel myself getting stronger with just 2 miles 4 times a week.

7659281,4,B01BKTG026,"If you want to try some of Jessica Smith's most challenging exercise routines get ready to use a resistance band. Is there anything this woman can not do with a resistance band? It boggles the mind how creative she is. It took me a few weeks to get through all the routines and they do seem more difficult than her regular walking videos.

The warm up is simple except there are some balancing challenges. Can we say figure 8 and do it at the same time? Apparently Beth in the video has trouble balancing. She is normally doing the most difficult moves but the figure 8 really got to her. So if you can do it better than Beth you will be really proud of yourself. The move includes standing on one foot and drawing a figure 8 out in front with the other foot. Sounds simple no? It isn't!

There are six miles to enjoy and each has its challenges.

Mile 1: This has moves you will recognize but it is pretty fast paced. Looks like it was filmed in an apartment overlooking a freeway. The moving traffic is not too distracting but the mirrored or metal leg of a table shows a reflection of the exercises which can be annoying if you pay attention to it. But don't worry too much. I sort of forgot about it eventually.

Mile 2: This is very difficult and includes use of a resistance band. I'm telling you a resistance band when used properly is much more difficult than weights.

Mile 3: Some of the moves will leave you panting for breath. There are also some nice floor exercises.

Mile 4: Cardio insanity is what this is. Don't look twice but what are those windmills? Help.

Mile 5: With a full body workout you can achieve a lot if you stick with this mile. Great uses of a resistance band, although I had to double up and tie two bands together. If you have a very long band this won't be a problem. But if you are tall get ready with two bands together.

Mile 6: This is very fast paced with a lot of annoying clapping. If someone tells me to smile and also claps I get annoyed apparently. As an introvert this was almost too much to handle.

There is a lovely cool down you can select after each mile but if you want to do the stretching routine you have to go and choose that at the end. It is not included in the automatic organizing section. So there is no button for the stretching routine. This is fine sometimes because I don't always want to do it. But it would have been nice if they had organized it so the stretching routine played right after the cool down.

Overall this is a great DVD full of really creative moves and uses of a resistance band. I will probably avoid doing mile 6 too often but the rest of the miles were fun.

I adore the customization options of this DVD being able to pick what miles I do. It's perfect for a quick workout if I don't have much time, or if I have time I can choose how many miles I want to do.",1493510400,,379,3.7974683544303796

If you want a high impact workout that will leave you drenched in sweat this is your girl. It's not just walking in place she has created moves to tone and tighten specific areas ,I can see baby abs poking through from her standing ab exercises , this is the best program I've had yet . I'm moments away from purchasing another DVD . I'll be working out with her for life",1493337600,20,476,4.184782608695652

7659290,4,B01BKTG026,"I really like this 6 mile mix. First what I like best: ability to choose which mile walks to do and in which order to do them. I love the speed walk which can give you a mile in 12 minutes. I like her pace, her directions and the fact that you can do low or high intensity depending on your level or mood. I also love the timer/clock on the bottom corner that tells you how many minutes are left. The music could be greatly improved, it's very quiet in the background and a little bland. I'm a zumba fan and really get moving with the right music. Overall this is a great workout and will check out her other videos.",1490227200,2,616,4.057377049180328

7659300,5,B01BKTG026,"I wanted a program that would allow me to exercise in a limited space during the winter months and when my allergies prevent me from going outside. This is perfect! I can create my own program, including 1 mile or a number of miles (according to my daily needs and time limitations), a warm up, and a cool down. Each mile targets different areas or serves different purposes and so I can develop a program to focus on what I most need to work on. And, I really love that the miles include three people performing them: one who does a lighter intensity mile, one person who does a medium intensity mile and one person who does a more intense mile workout. That way, I can follow the person who is doing the mile I am most comfortable with. This video is so innovative and so customizable that it feels like I have a personal trainer. And, the price is well worth it! I couldn't be happier! Thank you!",1484784000,,899,4.325443786982248

7659306,5,B01BKTG026,"Okay, so I think I have made this statement with every review of Jessicas workouts, but this one is truly one of my favorites because it is so versatile.

This gem of a workout has 6 1 mile workouts, each clocking in at about 15 minutes each.  Its all there, cardio, intervals, toning and stretching.

As usual, the set is filmed in sunny Florida.  Jessica, Beth and her Mom, Debbie, are all dressed in bright tops.  Beth is doing the advanced moves; Debbie is doing easier/low impact moves and Jessica is doing something in between.

I just love doing this workout during my rest week, or if Im recovering from an injury or illness.  Its a nice way to get the blood moving without killing myself.

You can customize this workout as well.  For the toning sections, you will need an exercise band.

The sections:

WARM UP
You will warm up from head to toe.  My favorite moves here include shoulder rolls and ankle circles.

MILE 1  STEADY BURN
This section is filled with traditional moves, done at a steady pace.  Some of my favorites here include:  jogging arms punch up, traveling wide knee lift and zig zag.

MILE 2  UPPER BODY
Some of my favorite moves include:  side to side step with chest press, bow and arrow step back, bicep curls with curtsy and figure 8 arms with march.

MILE 3  LOWER BODY
There are 10 minutes of standing and 5 minutes of floor work.

Some of my favorite moves include: side leg lift, pulsing one leg squat, alternating glute lift, clam shell with tubing and bridge with band across pelvis.

MILE 4  CARDIO INTERVALS
I love interval work!  The interval moves include:  windmill, figure 8 scoop and double knee squat chop.

In between each interval you will do some active recovery like alternating knee lift with circle arms.

MILE 5  TOTAL BODY
Some of my favorite moves include: chop with band, alternating front step with chest fly and heel dig with bow and arrow.

MILE 6  SPEED WALK
Some of my favorite moves include: side to side step clap, wide skater tap and cheerleader arms.

There is also a nice cool down and stretch.  Although, I must admit, I rarely do these.

If you are looking for a fun and versatile DVD that has it all, this one is for you!",1483920000,7,2189,4.486005089058525

I did the entire 6 miles first time out. I regularly incorporate walking DVDs into my exercise regimen.  It's non-stop and you may have to work up to the 6 miles if you're a beginner.

7659323,5,B01BKTG026,"I am new to the Jessica Smith work out line, a couple months in, and I must say - I love it!  I have been trying different at home workout videos off and on for 10 years now - and I always eventually don't get enough results and/or I get bored.  Not with Jessica!  I think I've truly found someone I will keep working out with.  The main reason I love her videos - her choice of moves, sequencing, pacing and options for different levels of difficulty always make me feel like I'm challenging my body and getting results without being miserable or unable to keep up while doing it.  That's it in a nutshell - it's so easy to keep going back every day, and to not dread your workout - that's worth a million bucks!

Other things that contribute to my love of Jessica videos - She's got great energy, she describes what you're supposed to do in detail, she reminds you what to focus on at just the right time when you probably stopped focusing on it.  I don't get bored, I love (almost) all of her music, it's always upbeat and fun to listen to, which cannot be said about all workout videos.  And when she talks, she doesn't sound goofy - she makes me smile!
I think I've finally found someone I'll keep coming back for.

Specifically, this workout video is super! She's got 6, 15 minute workout options to mix and match, all of which have a specific goal, are a challenge but not too overwhelming.  I love that I could do a different sequence of video segments for weeks using only this video.  I can't say enough good things about Jessica Smith's creativity and ability to motivate me, I am so grateful I found her workouts.",1478131200,7,1625,4.33003300330033

7659342,4,B01BKTG026,The workout is a good variety of toning and cardio.  It is easy to pick which miles and in what order needed.

Each mile is something different and she makes sure to keep the activity up the entire length of the mile so that you don't slow down at the end of one mile and then start over for the next mile.  As long as you do the warm up and cool down then each mile offers a great workout for the entire length of the mile.  LOVED it.  So glad I took a chance on a new walk workout with a new trainer.

The three toning workouts-upper body, lower body and total body do not involve as much walking as others but they will get you a little sweaty and they do the job they are meant to do!  The abs workout involves intervals and is tough but effective.  My favorite is the steady burn but I know changing up my routine is important to keep the body guessing and this DVD gives you that variety.  I like the fact that you can customize this to what you want to do that day and that the warm up, cool down and stretch are all separate chapters.",1468108800,,618,4.256410256410256

I really like the cardio workouts on this DVD (that don't use the band), but I've also used the band workouts a couple of times, and they are growing on me! Recommendation: get a good 6-foot band. I was using a shorter band (something that I had lying around the house) on some other band workouts before this one came out, and that just didn't work as well.

I like the customization menu so I can easily select which miles I want to do.  Jessica is a wonderful instructor and a great mix of business/friendly, without being overly chatty, giggly and annoying (ahem, Leslie Sansone).

Pros:  I really enjoy Jessica's teaching style.  I like that she praises you for joining her to work out and isn't a, ""drill instructor"".  I enjoy the movements.  Many are original and unique.  She keeps the arms moving which helps with toning and caloire burn, and boy does it burn!  Appreciate the countdown timer.
Cons:  This DVD is also quite blurry as if it has been dubbed a few to many times.  This is why I deducted one star.  .",1465257600,3,503,4.32258064516129

I break a sweat from mile one and feel challenged, but not exhausted through the entire workout.

7659402,4,B01BKTG026,"I've been a Leslie Sansone walker for years. And many of us know that when we see any workout with 'miles' in it, we think of her. So, I had some biased views going into Jessica Smith workouts for the first time. Turns out, I actually prefer Jessica's methods than what I was used to becuase she adds way more variety than just the same thing, but had some annoying cons to it.

Menu Page
1) Introduction
2) Play All
3) Customize Workout
4) Bonus Stretch
5) Credits

Now, if you read the description earlier, the details are self explanatory. However, I did not like the order of the miles in its original setting. So, I went by mine.

*My Customize*
1) Warm up

2) Cardio Interval Abs Mile - After the warmup, I already have energy reserved, and I can just blast myself through this mile. In the original setting, this was Mile 4, and I was already very tired by the time I got to Mile 4. In this Mile, it should have been called the ""Cardiac Arrest Attack"". She WILL burn you out. But I LOVE her interval mixes becuase she does each interval differently rather than just jog in place all the time. Her Intervals are three times throughout the walk for three sets each, and this is the toughest mile in the DVD. She doesn't do anything drastic like Gliad or Denise Austin. However, I didn't really feel anything in my abs.

3) Upper Body Sculpt Mile - I switched to this because it helps to cool me down after that intense interval mile, and I didn't want to go into another tough mile after that. So, I'm doing something more graceful and pleasant in this mile. However, this was a very teeth-gritting workout becuase her arm sculpting barely had any breaks between sets. I was VERY fatigued, which made me go half-time then her double time. Some of her moves are unique, but there were many I have already seen before. But Phew!!

4) Steady Burn Mile - Self explanatory. You're moving steadily, but you're still burning away. This was originally Mile 1.

5) Lower Body Toner Mile - This was one of my favorites becuase she introduced very unique tips in how to burn the glutes without those annoying squats and lunges. So, this got me really excited. The only trouble I had was that when she had me walking side to side on the resistant band, my band snapped into two. I used my other band and it happened again. So, you might want to invest in different resistant level bands. I personally think if we're going to walk with the bands, it's probably better to either use tube bands, or use a band that's thicker. She does get on the floor for a few movements during the last 5 minutes of the mile.

6) Speed Walk Mile - This is the shortest mile and and it's where you walk briskly. She barely has you jogging, unless you want to modify it. You're moving around fast, so be careful.

7) Total Body Tune Up Mile - To me, this sort of combined some of the upper and lower body miles together. There were some of the same upper body movements, but the majority of the mile consisted of different things. Remember when I said the band snapped for the second time? It happened here. So, I had to modify.

8) Cool Down - Really good, doesn't rush through it.

9) Stretch - I really like her stretches becuase she's getting a variety of muscles. She'll use a chair with you to balance on it, and sit in it. She doesn't get on the floor at all. There were stretches I had never seen before, but were impressed with.

Overall, I'm REALLY glad I bought the DVD. I'd say I might have burned between 300 to 400 calories. But I'd only do this DVD when I'm energetic, becuase man...she'll kill you.

Thanks Jessica",1464048000,14,3603,4.359701492537313

The offer three miles (upper body, lower body and all over to ping) are great, too.  I would highly recommend this dvd.

7659418,3,B01BKTG026,"This is an upbeat workout video and you really do sweat. The drawback for me is that there are too many twisting type moves and a lot of them are FAST.  My knees and ankles are both very sore--and that's not a good thing! I would not recommend this for folks with joint issues.

Also, she doesn't give instructions well enough. I've done a million workout videos and even I was confused and had to stop and watch what she was doing a few times.

If you want to get your heart pumping and burn fat then I would highly recommend Jessica's five mile walk video. If you're like me, over 45 and need some cues to help you along, then go with the five mile walk.

In conclusion, I sweat buckets during both videos so I think I'll be sticking with the one that doesn't cause me pain. Lol",1461024000,17,780,4.18

7659423,5,B01BKTG026,"This 6 Mile Mix is amazing. Unfortunately, because we live in a rural area with very limited internet connection, I am not able to watch Jessica's YouTube channel. I am so happy that Jessica offers her walking programs on DVD for purchase.

This DVD gets right to the point. You have a warm up but then you get to work right away. There is no fluff or wasted time. I have done each of the miles and have enjoyed them all. However, I can only do 3 miles back to back but hopefully in the next few weeks i can work up to 6 miles without stopping.  One thing that is great about this DVD is that you can pick the type of miles that you want to do. Do you want a lot of cardio? Do you want your workout geared towards your abs, upper body or lower body?? You choose what you want to do or if your feeling up to the challenge, play all of the miles. Jessica's mom is in the back showing you the modified steps if you need to take it a bit easier and her friend is on the other side and she kicks it up a notch if your needing more of a challenge.

I feel so good after completing any of Jessica's workout. If you are currently on any of Leslie Sansone walking programs (I am, and love her too) and your wanting to add a little spice into your DVD collection, I would absolutely recommend adding this DVD!",1460332800,7,1299,4.0271317829457365
7659424,5,B01BKTG026,"It's a great program. I have tried about so many exercise videos, and Jessica Smith's are the best.

7659426,5,B01BKTG026,"I am 66 years old and have been walking with Leslie Sansone for a number of years (since I retired from a hectic job).  I say this because this is not a beginner workout for a 60 year old woman. I can keep up with Jessica, but not her high energy friend. Her mother is also there doing low impact moves.  The decor is interesting and while I am working out I am thinking - how did they paint that wall, what is the floor made of etc.  I can hardly hear any music and wish I could, but then I may not be able to hear Jessica who is all business with energetic enthusiasm. This girl really knows her stuff and is creative in her movements and themes.  When I tell people about these walking workouts they just can't imagine how versatile and inventive they can be. ""How can just walking be a workout?""  I am sweating during and for a time after this workout.  If you are trying to get your 10,000 steps in for the day you should probably skip the second and third mix because they are slower and you use bands.  The rest of the miles will give you a little over 2,000 steps. It is good, it is hard, and it seems worthwhile.  I will continue checking out all of the Jessica Smith dvds.",1459987200,10,1182,4.108695652173913
7659427,5,B01BKTG026,"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this video!  I do at least one walk from it each day since I like to mix up my routines daily with a few of her other videos.  I only recently tried Jessica Smith after becoming bored by all my old workouts.  Jessica is FUN and I find myself excited to go and spend my time working out again.  Just within the last couple months of doing her videos I have found my core to be much stronger, my stamina much improved and muscles becoming more toned.  I have lost weight and inches.

Also just an FYI- you will want a 6ft resistance band.  I accidentally bought a 4ft which works for the arm exercises but not for all the things she will have you doing.",1459900800,4,670,4.107692307692307
7659428,5,B01BKTG026,"Like other reviewers metioned, I was hesitant to purchase this DVD because I already own ALL of Jessica's workout DVDs along with many other walking DVDs by Leslie Sansone.  I thought to myself, how different could this DVD possibly be from the others??  But I decided to purchase this DVD because I noticed that it's featured in phase 2 of Jessica's 6 Week Total Transformation program (I'm currently doing another round of the 6 week program which I absolutely LOVE & highly recommend).

I got this DVD today, and because I'm a basket case I did all of the miles today .  And I am just so impressed with this DVD!!!  I don't know how Jessica does it!  I don't know how she manages to create all these different moves; she really is like an artist.  For example, I thought the Cardio Interval Abs mile was going to be similar to the other ab workouts she has, but it was quite different, intense & refreshing!  Also the Total Body Tune Up mile was such a great burner; I just loved the ""lawnmower"" row/lunge combo move.  I love working out with the resistance band, it works the muscles in a different way from hand weights.

If you're new to Jessica & you're debating between this program and her 5 Fat Burning Miles or her 15 Minute Fast Fat Blasts, GET THIS ONE.  You won't regret it.  This DVD is so complete & versatile.  It contains cardio, strength training & a lovely stretch session. This will be my new go to DVD for traveling.  As a matter of fact, I think Jessica should consider creating a PDF workout calendar just for this DVD because I'm willing to bet that people can get great results from just using this DVD alone.

I am an intermediate (slightly advanced) exerciser & I still got a great workout from these low impact exercises.  I like to switch between high impact & low impact workouts.  I just completed Jillian Michaels' BODYSHRED program & I started to experience some knee discomfort towards the last few weeks.  Like Jessica says, if your workout is causing you pain then it's not right for you!!! So, I listened to my body and immediately decided to start another round of Jessica's 6 Week Transformation program.  My body now feels so much better & my knee discomfort is gone (and I'm still seeing results).  I can't wait to start Phase 2 of the 6 Week program & add this DVD to the routines!!!",1459555200,26,2326,4.492857142857143
7659429,5,B01BKTG026,"This is an excellent walking set from Jessica. The series gets you moving in a short amount of time and it has a lot of variety to keep it interesting. These are 15 minutes (approximately), and there are upper body and lower body routines with a band. All good! Perfect for adding on, but this DVD is also programmable, so you can string together the perfect routine for your mood that day. As always, Jessica is clear with her cueing, there are three levels to pick from if you need to, the music works, and I like the look of her new set, even though it isn't out doors. This is worth the purchase",1459468800,2,599,4.2631578947368425

7659431,4,B01BKTG026,I just purchased the workout and have used it once.  Unfortunately the DVD blacks out for moments while playing or the screens is filled with static.  I can still do most of the workout that is on just by coninuing the current move until the screen clears up. Due to this I am returing the DVD and re-ordering with the hope the next DVD does not have the same issue.  I always enjoy Jessica Smith's workout and it seems that I will really enjoy this one once the DVD works properly.,1459382400,,482,4.274725274725275

Just did the Cardio one and the fast walk after missing working out for a week and thought I wouldn't make it through but I did.  I want to start on Phase II of the walk strong workout soon.

7659437,4,B01BKTG026,"I liked this 6 mile mix but I was dissapointed with the set (that's why I gave it 4 stars). I loved it when Jessica's workout DVDs were outside. I live in Canada where 6 months out of the year, it's cold here with snow so it's so nice to be able to workout outside in Florida, at a park, close to the beach, at a pool, marina, anywhere outside.

7659439,5,B01BKTG026,"This a fantastic cardio/strength workout. As usual, Jessica finds a way to keep things fresh so you're never bored with the workout.  Thanks to the other reviewers who provided a detailed description of the workout. This workout is so easy to customize. I love that you can get a great sweaty workout without punishing your joints. As I age, I find that I can't do a lot of high impact, jumping moves and Jessica's workouts allow me to get a good low impact cardio workout. Love, love this workout.

7659444,5,B01BKTG026,"I was skeptical when I first got this DVD and I wasn't sure I'd like it. You see, I HATE strength training and I absolutely hate the stupid stretchie band (I still don't know why I hate it). However, this was an awesome DVD. I like that each mile had a different theme, such as steady burn where you're just walking fast, upper body sculpting and lower body sculpting, all while walking.

However, if you're like me and use a step counter, you may want to throw it out the window because the miles are based on the timing, not the steps. What I did (for tracking purposes) was count the minutes in each mile, subtract what my tracker said (which is fairly accurate) and claim the rest as strength or weight training. Plus, on those days where you truly don't want to do any strength stuff, just skip the band altogether and use just your body weight...it will still get the heart pumping!!!!",1458345600,2,891,4.432926829268292
7659445,5,B01BKTG026,"Jessica is by far my favorite trainer. She's just so personable, supportive and motivating. I love that she offers a ton of free workouts on her YouTube channel but I purchase her DVDs to be supportive of her. This DVD is fantastic! It incorporates everything you need and I absolutely love that I can program my workout exactly as I want for the day. I enjoy working with resistance bands because I feel they work your muscles in a different way. I just cancelled my gym membership because why pay money to get in my car, drive and workout on someone else's schedule? I can get a great workout in my own home on my schedule. Love that!",1458345600,3,636,4.398305084745763
7659446,5,B01BKTG026,"When I purchased this a few weeks ago I thought I would use it as an add-on to other workouts,  but for me this is a stand-alone. I get a total-body, cross training effect when I add this into my weekly routine. Just feels different using the resistance band instead of dumbbells. It is customizable so I typically set it up for a 60 minute workout. I am thrilled to be a part of the JS community. Isn't she just the best, most personable trainer ever? Keep the workouts coming and I will by them. I've never been more fit, flexible and strong in my life. (Hint to the walkers out there. It's not just walking for six miles. She will show you how to get the most out of your workout time, and how not to get burned out or bored.)",1458172800,5,729,4.133802816901408
7659447,5,B01BKTG026,"Probably Jessica's best DVD to date!  Fast walking, slower walking, toning upper and lower body, standing abs ... it has it all!  All you need is a medium 6 ft resistance band for the toning miles and a mat for a short legs floorwork segment.  Great music too! (instrumental, no vocals).

All 6 miles (each 15 minutes) plus warm up and cool down (5 minutes each) can be played in any order or you can just program to play a few of them.  You have 8 segments to choose from (warm up, cool down and 6 different miles) and you can repeat the same mile again back to back (up to 8 selections maximum).

Beth, as usual, shows some advanced moves while Debbie demonstrates the easier variations.  Jessica leads at an intermediate level. There is also a countdown timer on the screen for each mile.  Filmed on location in a contemporary apartment.

A MUST HAVE walking DVD!",1458086400,13,866,4.464968152866242
7659448,5,B01BKTG026,"If you are like me, and you know you need to strength train, but feel like you missed something when you are done if you don't get enough cardio in to get the endorphins going, then you will LOVE this workout!!  I buy all of her DVD's because I always FEEL so good when I do them.  This one is no exception!! My favorite way to use these workouts is to put the upper and lower sections together as one longer session, or add the cardio sections to the end of another workout to get the feel-good endorphins going.  These workouts are PERFECT for that!  And the Cardio Abs Intervals one is much harder than I anticipated  - in a good way!  It is definitely do-able, but you will definitely feel like you got something done when it is over.  Thanks so much Jessica!!",1458000000,8,764,4.263888888888889

7659450,5,B01BKTG026,"Love it. There's enough detailed reviews to see what it looks like ! Jessicas cueing is spot on and it's a great mix of cardio and strength. I lift weights usually, but boy the band can be just as challenging. Jessica is the first fitness instructor to nail a lower body mile with the band! Nice job! If you unsure about lifting or want an intermediate day this is the one to start with! I have all her DVDs and this is up there as one of the best, also Jessicas enthusiasm and positive demenour are always so welcome. Just do whatever you can a manage today, is her motto! I love her attitude and her workout style. Thank god for her!!",1457740800,2,636,4.221311475409836
7659451,5,B01BKTG026,I have 2 other dvds of hers. I love them. When I saw this one was new. I wanted to buy..So I did buy. I do love this one to. Its fun and a great workout. I like about is you can pick anyone you want to do. Mix and Match.,1457654400,2,220,3.3333333333333335
7659452,5,B01BKTG026,"This is an awesome walking dvd! I loved every mile. Jessica has done an amazing job with this one. I feel it's one of her best walking programs yet, much better than her 5 mile dvd. She is perfect as always with cueing and encouragement and her two workout partners do a great job at showing the different modification options. The toning miles, phew, they work you. I'm a huge strength training fan but rarely use anything other than dumbells so using the stretchy band was new and dang it works the muscles in a totally different way than dumbells do; you will feel the burn for sure!  One of my favorite miles was the abs one. I like that Jessica incorporates a type of hiit mentality in that one, something a little more intense than say previous walking dvds she has produced. I highly recommend this one. It is fun, gives you a good sweat, and tones you up! Great job Jessica!",1457568000,14,882,4.411042944785276
7659453,5,B01BKTG026,"Used this DVD for the first time last night, and purely by chance, I picked the miles that didn't use the resistance band.  I do have one, but had forgotten that you needed it for some of the segments on this DVD.  Anyway, I really enjoyed using this video, and I can see it becoming one of my favorites.  A couple of things -- I am not a fan of Jessica's cueing of new moves, and that's a comment relative not just to this DVD (but it's more pronounced in this one).  Most of the time, she doesn't count down to a change or give you much notice at all, just BOOM and you're doing the new move.  But, this is a very minor issue and once I've done the various miles a few times, I'll be able to anticipate most of the changes.  My only other negative comment is that, for some reason, the bonus segments (chair stretch, etc.) aren't part of the customizable menu.  So if you want to add the stretch at the end, you have to do your miles and then go back to the main menu to select the bonus segments (warm up and cool down are part of the customizable menu, though).  All in all, this is a great DVD.",1457481600,7,1099,4.055555555555555
7659454,5,B01BKTG026,"I purchased this BRAND NEW Jessica Smith 6 Mile Mix from Amazon and got it Tuesday night when it was released. I did the warm up, cool down, bonus stretch and miles 1-4 on Wednesday; and then miles 5 and 6 the next day so I could post this review this week.

I really like the customized menu! I tried it out on Thursday with selecting the warm up, mile 5, mile 6, mile 1, and cool down. The cool thing about the custom menu is that you can select any workout you want to do, in whatever order you want to do!

If you want to do just the strength training segments with the band-you would select mile 2, 3 and 5. If you want to do just cardio-you would select mile 1, 4 and 6.

I highly recommend always doing the warm up and cool down segments because miles 1-6 are fast paced and she gets right into the workout. The bonus stretch segment is really good as well! You will need a chair for the bonus stretch.

The warm up and all the mile segments show a countdown clock on the bottom right of the screen. The cool down and bonus stretch do not have a clock countdown. I like the clock feature because when Im feeling a little tired I can always push myself to do more when I see what little time I have left. Its also really helpful for my 5 year old to be able to see the clock when hes exercising with me.

The first day I tried the workout with a friend and we both agreed that the time went by REALLY fast (and we did 4 miles!). I was pleasantly surprised that although I have alot of home workout dvds and Jessica Smith workout dvds, that this one is very different! She has alot of new movements and patterns that Ive never done before.

I was hesitant to buy it because sometimes resistance band workouts irritate my upper back, but I love Jessica Smith workouts so I bought it anyway. IM SO GLAD THAT I DID! I really love it and plan on doing this workout with her phase II calendar rotation with other Jessica Smith workout dvds. I made sure to the bonus stretch both days so my back wouldnt hurt after using the resistance band and I haven't had any trouble.

Jessica and the cast are using 6 foot resistance bands but she says in the intro segment that you could use whatever length you have at home. I only had a 5 foot one which I used and it worked fine. I knew a 6 foot one would be better so I bought a set online to use the next time I did this workout.

The music is great and just loud enough to be heard. The usual cast of Beth and Debbie are in it which I love! Debbie shows modifications and Beth shows the more advanced higher impact movements. This dvd uses the same background set as her Walk Strong DVD set.

Here is the time breakdown for each segment so you can plan accordingly:

Warm up (6:10 mins)
Mile 1 Steady Burn (15:47 mins)
Mile 2 Upper Body Sculpt with band (15:25 mins)
Mile 3 Lower Body Toner with band (15:35 mins) *you are on the floor from 10:50-15:35.
Mile 4 Cardio Interval Abs (15:25 mins) 3 rounds of 3 different intervals
Mile 5 Today Body Tune Up with band (16:05 mins)
Mile 6 Speed Walk (12:15 mins) with jogging
Cool down (5:00 mins) no clock
Bonus stretch with chair (5:50 mins) no clock",1457049600,125,3141,4.134426229508197
7659455,5,B01BKTG026,"This DVD provides so many mix-and-match options.  The tempo and variety of moves are great.  As usual, Jessica takes the intermediate level, and her mom, Debbie, takes the beginner (and lower impact) version.  The third background exerciser (I'm sorry I forgot her name), takes the advanced option.  There is an easy-to-navigate menu so you can pick the segments you would like to do.  I know I'll get a lot of use out this DVD.",1456876800,3,428,4.72972972972973
7659456,5,B01BKTG026,"I'm a huge fan of Jessica and her attitude towards fitness so I couldn't wait for this DVD!  I found that the cardio/fat burning miles were much more challenging than those in her Walk On: 5 Fat Burning Miles program and loved the inclusion of resistance/strength training.  Jessica as usual is her perky self and is joined my her Mom Debbie (beginner modifications) and Beth (advanced).

A breakdown:

Mile 1: Steady Burn (15 minutes)

This wasn't too intense but my heart rate was definitely elevated throughout the entire routine.  If you're familiar with Jessica's moves most will be familiar; step in and outs while traveling back and forth, side to side steps, travelling knee crunches, and a LOT of hamstring curls (turning in different directions).  It wasn't my favorite on this set but I did work up a sweat.

Mile 2: Upper Body Sculpt (15 Minutes)

I have a hunch I'll be feeling this tomorrow because I'm used to dumbbells and although the resistance band is also used for strength it does so in a different manner.  There's not much of a cardio component but your upper body is definitely challenged (depending on the level of resistance you opt for; Jessica has a medium band)!  She does bow & arrow pulls for the back and arms, presses for the chest/back, bicep curls with leg crossed behind/curtsy, tricep kickbacks, bent over rows, pressed forward with knee raises, and figure 8s for the abs.  For most moves she does two sets so by the time the second comes around you really start feeling it - I know my back was definitely waking up!  This was a quick and effective upper body routine that's a good alternative to just using regular weights because Jessica incorporates the band into almost every move.

Mile 3:  Lower Body Toner (15 Minutes)

Another quick and effective routine!  Split stance squats with on foot on the band, squat kicks, back kicks while raising the band overhead, the ""Oompa Loompa"" (both feet on the band moving side to side), and side kicks; all really target the glutes and thighs.  Jessica finishes on the floor (you'll need a mat) for inner thigh lifts, 90 degree clamshell raises, and bridges.  This, along with the upper body band segment, are great add-ons if you want a burst of strength training after a cardio session.

Mile 4:  Cardio Interval Abs (15 Minutes)

This was the toughest for me because you take off fast, never slow down and have a rotation of high intensity interval moves thrown in.  It was also the most effective as far as bang for your buck: a lot of cardio plus creative abdominal work.  Jessica does windmills, high knees, skaters with an ab twist, squat chops, lunging figure 8 chops, etc.  You don't get much of a break with this one but I felt as though I'd just done a HIIT program by the time it was over.

Mile 5:  Total Body Tune Up (15 Minutes)

Most moves were done in the other routines using the resistance band but if you want an all over quick workout this does the trick!  Oompa Loompas, bicep curls, tricep kickbacks, chest presses with a lunge, upper back rows, ab chops, etc.  Another good add-on after a cardio session to get the muscles burning.

Mile 6:  Speed Walk (12 Minutes)

This was my favorite!  It was fast, fun, and the music was great.  Lots of grapevines (I love grapevines!), fast side to side steps with rotations (i.e. face one wall, face the other wall, etc.), jogging with arm punches, etc.  Even though the moves were familiar the energy was there and I had a smile on my face as Jessica was doing rah-rah arms while jogging back and forth.

This DVD is a great addition to anyone who loves Jessica and her enthusiasm!  I have to note that the music was a HUGE improvement over some her prior programs, which tended to recycle the same songs.  It never bothered me but I loved the change up as far as the music went; everything felt like a perfect fit during the cardio portions.  I also was happy with the wide variety of routines and incorporation of the resistance band since it was a nice break from typical weight training.  If you have Jessica's Walk On: Walk Strong and were as thrilled as I was that Jessica added in more weight work you should like that this program also provides an equal focus on cardio and strength.  Highly recommend!",1456876800,39,4257,4.591511936339523
