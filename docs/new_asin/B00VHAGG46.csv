8710188,4,B00VHAGG46,"Elizabeth Streb is a force of nature which cannot be contained.  She has invented a language onto her self and her dance company which is uttered, spoken, sung and shouted in time and space and in such a way as to reinvent dance.  This wonderful exploratory documentary hits with a thud to the chest and mind - high praise in the vernacular of Ms. Streb!",1431302400,,354,4.430769230769231
