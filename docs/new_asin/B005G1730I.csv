8470987,3,B005G1730I,"Bought this because I'm a huge fan of Lou Doillon.  Love her new album ""Places"" -- Not sure whats exactly on in this film or why she played this role... I do know it's a very personal act.

Whenever I watch or listen to Miss Doillon she is running from and towards something .. notably a lost love of some sort.. and fully expressing ""that"" seems to be an obsession which makes for great art.. (Edvard Munch, Klimt comes to mind).  She's been shadowed with her incredible extended family (do the research yourself it's extensive) and I know she'll overcome all of that past stuff.

Just be yourself Lou!",1385424000,,603,4.504587155963303
8470988,3,B005G1730I,"Adapted and directed by Laure Charpentier from one of her own novels which was banned when first released 40 years ago. Gigola captures the zeitgeist of the Parisian lesbian underworld of the 1960s.

When the film begins, we see a young, innocent, Georgia (Lou Dillon) deeply smitten with her schoolmistress Sybil. Upon graduation, she convinces Sybil that she truly wants a life with her and to embrace her lesbian identity.

A few years later, Georgia has transformed herself into Gigola. With slick hair, a snakehead cane, elegant suits and impeccable style, Gigola rules the night. The night however is full of many things and to acquire money, Gigola must become just that, a gigolo and a seducer of much older women. Rich women who appreciate her charms dote on her with jewellery, money and cars.
Soon she rules Pigalle's nightlife along with the gangsters and pimps, acquiring her own prostitutes who service both men and women. When she meets Danny in a bar, she believes that she has potential. Gigola soon seduces her, purchases her from her pimp, buys her new clothes and begins Danny's transformation into Cora. Sadly, Danny's drinking problem mars this promising relationship and we begin to see the temperamental and vengeful side of Gigola.

Through flashbacks, we learn that Gigola's first love, her schoolmistress Sybil committed suicide many year's ago. Still tormented, Gigola is unable to love or allow another woman to love her. Instead, she deals with the loss by disappearing into the night - ""The night is for forgetting, easy money and flirting with death"". Slowly the layers peel away until we see how Gigola's own demons have influenced the present day woman.

After a particularly bad night Gigola wakes up in a hospital room from an overdose. Her doctor reminds her so much of Sybil that she relentlessly pursues her upon release from the hospital. Will she be the one who helps her forget the past?

Gigola is a unique film that captures a little known chapter in Parisian history when the nightlife was full of ambiguity and identity and sexuality were undefined.

8470990,1,B005G1730I,The first copy of this DVD I recieved would not play past the twenty-eight second introduction. I returned it to Amazon and the replacement did the same thing so I returned that one too. They may be simply bad DVD's or were for some region other than USA.,1322956800,,255,4.333333333333333
8470991,1,B005G1730I,"French film.
So Bad.
Weird.
Very looong story short. Ugly French girl drops out of med school to become a pimp, and has a thing for OLD women.
Warning ** very unappealing sex scene with  a 70 year old woman.
Spoiler** she wants a baby, so she sleeps with a guy, changes mind gives bb away. end.
Would never recommend this film.",1321747200,2,327,4.274193548387097
