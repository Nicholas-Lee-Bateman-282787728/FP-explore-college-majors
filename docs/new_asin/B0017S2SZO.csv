8267033,3,B0017S2SZO,"Secret Agent, 1936 film

This is based on a play taken from the book ""Ashenden"" by Somerset Maugham. Maugham's book was a fictionalized story of his work as a British agent during the Great War; it was first censored and banned from publication. A British officer is sent to Switzerland to prevent a German agent from traveling to Arabia and getting them to revolt against British rule. We hear bombs from the German air force over London. Ashenden will take the place of the last British agent who died suddenly. His job is to find that German agent and stop his mission. Ashenden will be helped by the ""hairless Mexican"" (who has curly hair and isn't a Mexican), a mercenary called The General. Ashenden was given a wife to better hide his status in Switzerland.

An old man visits a store to buy chocolate. Outside he discards the candy to read a secret message telling him the British agent has arrived. Ashenden finds the contact has been silenced. We see scenes at the casino, where a man claims a lost button found by the dead organist. Ashenden figures him for the German agent, as this Englishman has a German wife. They arrange to go on a mountain climb. Back at the hotel Mrs. Ashenden spends time with the suspect's wife. Their dog senses something is wrong. Later they find they eliminated the wrong man. (Was it too easy?)

The General has discovered a secret German spy post, and they can now discover the German agent by visiting this chocolate factory. Their presence is reported to the police, but a fire alarm allows an escape. Their payoff allows them to get the name of the German agent. Now they must intercept Robert Marvin at the railroad station, or get on the train going to enemy territory. There is a dramatic confrontation, then an explosive ending to the train trip. The happy ending follows the moral conventions. [Was this echoed in ""From Russia With Love""?] This story illustrates why a secret agent needs a cover name and a low profile. A real spy would never be as well known as ""James Bond"".",1487721600,,2027,4.625
