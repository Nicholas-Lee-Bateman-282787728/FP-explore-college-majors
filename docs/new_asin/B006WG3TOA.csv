8505634,5,B006WG3TOA,"Though Amazon lists this as a Region 2 DVD, the copy I received had no technical information about the disc whatsoever, and it worked just fine on my Region 1 player. The LJCO's 2008 performance at Jazzfestival Schaffhansen was filmed in a 1:33:1 aspect ratio, with the image blurry at the edges -- the image sucks, but the sound is fine.

It's wonderful to have this video document at all. Eleven of the band members from the 1989 recording, which I've loved for years, reprise their roles here, joined by half a dozen new players -- well, seven, since the band now carries two drummers. A concerto grosso for improvisers rediscovering tonality after years in the free jazz wilderness, ""Harmos"" is a forty-five minute orchestral work loaded with unforgettable highlights: those amazing air raid trombones at the very opening; Trevor Watts twisting himself into a one-legged stand during his impassioned alto solo; a furious trio for trumpet, baritone, and drums; that gorgeous quartet ballad for alto player Pete McPhail and pianist Howard Riley; and the Parker-Guy-Lytton trio, as incendiary now as I remember them from a Berkeley performance in the 1990s. If you care about creative, jazz-based music at all, you owe it to yourself to hear ""Harmos,"" and then to seek out the rest of the LJCO's recorded output, which won't be easy.",1487462400,,1334,4.955357142857143
