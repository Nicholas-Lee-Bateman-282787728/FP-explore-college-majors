3960514,5,B002NX70GE,"This movie is very sweet and moving, about a love that starts in freshman year in high school, between an innocent girl and the schools' tough guy, and he's a player too. He sees her in the hallway, falls instantly in love, and never looks back, never again looks at another girl.
This is not a mystery, so this is not a spoiler: she has a miscarriage, and what's probably unusually different about this boy is that he mourns the loss of their baby as much or more than she does.
As another reviewer said, she was the victim of a gang rape, but I didn't see this as gratis at all. It addressed a sad and all-too-common problem with relationships after a rape, and that is, that far too many men cannot be with their wives or girlfriends again after a rape. But this boy never wavered for even a moment. I believe that rape was included in the story as a test of his love, and he passed with flying colors---othewise, this love story would have been moving anyway, but not nearly as powerful.
He fiercely protected her from school bullying over this, and when she told him she was no longer afraid, he immediately made love to her. What I'm saying is, he showed her his love in every way possible, including with his body, and I don't think that's a little thing. It helped lift this high school story from a
 ""love ya 'til I die"" kind of thing into a deep and serious committment.
Worth every cent and more.
Of course there is more to this story than this. Give it a try, you might like it too.

This paragraph is a later addition to my original review, because I've just re-read the other reviews and feel I'd like to to express my feelings about something someone else wrote: I don't think this movie is appropriate for children, because there are two scenes that make it obvious the couple is having sex. It's not pornographic, there's no nudity, but definitely kissing, then they are in the bed (covered up)and he's on top of her making sexual movements. The second sex scene is on the school library floor, he removes her outer clothing and moves down on top of her. Again, this is not nude or pornographic, but it's extremely obvious what they are doing.
I personally would not show this to children. I went into some detail here, so that at least you could know that maybe you should watch first by yourself before you make a decision about kids, or even young teenagers. Also---the gang rape-they do show the boys throwing her down on the ground and overpowering her, then fade-out. It's not as graphic as the scenes between the lovers, but if you show it to kids, you'll have to explain it. The kids are going to want to know what just happened. Just thought you should not be misled.
Even later addition: I hardly ever do this because I don't like to detract from the video at hand, but-you must see this actor in ""Last Cinderella""!",1316908800,11,2842,4.42175572519084
3960515,5,B002NX70GE,"My daughter has wanted this movie for a long time and we are so pleased to have found it through Amazon. This is a beautiful Japanese drama that is definitely worth the purchase. Very much a tearjerker, but a heartwarming and wonderful story. The acting was superb and we definitely felt able to empathize with the characters. Beautifully done movie all around.",1309651200,,361,4.838709677419355
3960516,5,B002NX70GE,"As there is not a review for this film, I felt the need to post one. What can I say, even though I had to read the subtitles through out, what an absolutely beautiful, gruelling and deeply upsetting film. Once the water ducts broke open they never stopped, even as the ending credits scrolled up and away I was still aching over the story. Although rushed at the beginning, slightly exaggerated in parts, for example an unnecessary rape scene (however I must state this is insinuated, as most scenes are in the film. You never actually see any kissing or sex although it is implied throughout.) I believe this film is right up there with Titanic and Atonement. It is a love story. It is a gruelling and upsetting but wonderfully brilliant story. It covers first love, first break up, bullying, miscarriage, denial and death. The beautiful and light beginning makes you warm up to these two kids, with all the time in the world to fall in love, that as everything unravels beyond their control you just can't help but feel for them and want so much for everything to be ok for them. What I feel I really must say is give Koizora a chance, you won't be disappointed. I stumbled upon it by chance and am so glad I did. It is a terribly sad but incredibly beautiful story.",1298419200,10,1268,4.469827586206897

8375548,5,B002NX70GE,I loved this story! It was so well written that I forgot they were teenagers and I cried for 3/4 of this movie.,1407196800,,111,3.869565217391304
8375549,4,B002NX70GE,"First off, if you're planning on watching this movie, have a tissue box ready. Secondly, prepare yourself for one of the saddest love stories ever written.
This movie is based off of what I understand to be a cellphone novel, which is basically just a story written on a cellphone. Having watched the movie and learning this I understand better why the movie is paced the way it is. While there is some time at the beginning where the characters are developed, it still felt like it dived into the drama pretty quickly. A lot ends up happening but with a limited time frame, they really had to, and was still handled well as the characters continued to develop well and so did their relationship. That being said, I really feel the need to emphasize that a LOT does happen. While watching it I paused it for a second for a bathroom break and I noticed on the run time that I was only halfway in. My first thought was ""Halfway? What MORE could happen?"" but more things do happen, and not all of them sad.
In all honesty the move was pretty fantastic and well on it's way to being one of my favorite Japanese movies, or even one of my favorite movies in general. The only reason I docked the one star was for the ending. Without giving in spoilers away, all I'll say is that it was badly done. I don't know if they were cramped for time and just threw an ending together without much thought or what. I've noticed most people don't seem to mind it, in fact I feel it would be safe to assume they probably love it, but for me every time I think about it it just makes me mad and all I can think about is how it's one big fat lie.
For those who want to know, I'll explain. If you don't want to know any spoilers (although I don't go into detail I hint quite heavily at how it ends) this is the end of my review.
*SPOILER*
As I was watching the movie I thought, ""Whoa, this is such a raw and powerful story"" but when I saw her turn around and smile at the end, I thought ""This is such a movie."" I get they were aiming for some hope at the end, but they could have easily gone about it in a different way that felt more real. I feel some other people who are like me and have lost someone they loved will agree with me, that it's just too clean of an ending and is such a lie. Even if they cut out the smile the ending still would have made sense and conveyed that hope and left a little happiness. I may be being overly sensitive about this one bad part in an otherwise wonderful movie, but I can't help myself. It just didn't fit and really ruined the whole ending for me.",1402531200,,2568,4.127744510978044
8375550,5,B002NX70GE,"I'm sure this will be one to watch again.  Reading subtitles and watching the movie takes two viewings--the second to see the actors in action.  To figure out the ""whys"" of it all was very cleverly done and kept me wanting her to make the right choices. Find out for yourself how it all ends.  :  )",1392163200,,298,4.175438596491228
8375551,5,B002NX70GE,"This movie was a pleasure to watch. The story revolves around the love story of Hiro and Mika. I will not spoil the ending, but I almost cried. This movie is similar to ""A  Walk to Remember"", ""A Millionaire's First Love"", and ""My Girl and I"". If you have seen any of these movies than I think you know where the movie is headed. This movie overall has brilliant acting and a beautiful story that will likely bring you to tears. If you're a fan of romance movies or Japanese movies, this is a must-watch!",1386115200,,503,4.294736842105263

8375553,5,B002NX70GE,"this movie will touch and keep touching you long after you have watched it. i had to make myself watch the ending tho i knew it would break my heart because i loved the characters so much. muira haruma (who plays hiro) was amazing to the end. i didn't understand why they made his character do what he did sometimes but you just have to suspend reality when you watch this and enjoy it for the beautiful love story that it is. the drama is very good, as well, but knowing how the movie ended i still can't watch the last two episodes. maybe someday.",1363651200,2,549,4.238095238095238
