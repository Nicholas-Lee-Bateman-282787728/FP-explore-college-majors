8583594,1,B00CMTCJXS,"This is an international no-region release. The default language is, I believe, German. You do have the original English version, but there are no subtitles. My wife and I both prefer to have the sound lower with subtitles. For list highway, the audio levels between the dialog and da solos is huge, making either the music way too loud, or the dialog too soft. This the desire for cc.",1482537600,,385,4.594202898550725
8583595,5,B00CMTCJXS,"I bought this when it was on sale - when the price of it thru a third party vendor was the same price roughly as the Criterion release of M. Drive. Astounding deal compared to what is out there.

I've watched 1 of the 3 so maybe this review is a little early, that particular film looked great. I'll be watching Lost Highway tonight and will report my findings - but I can tell you that all previous home video releases of LH have been just criminal. I smashed my old Canadian version of it because I hope no one who wants to see LH ever finds it - because if you have or find that and watch it, trust me, you still haven't seen the film.

Also eager to see if the image quality is improved on Inland Empire, which is a favorite on mine. Due to the method of it's production I'm not anticipating a whole lot of clarity - but I want it in the best possible detail and if the one film I've seen in this set is any indication - it'll be very very worth my time.",1466121600,,958,3.984375
8583596,5,B00CMTCJXS,"Thanks to this German company for producing the best-looking Lynch set ever. Lynch's last three films are lovingly produced for Blu-ray in this region-unlimited edition. I bought it after a long and frustrating wait for LOST HIGHWAY in proper frame ratio, and wow! It knocked my eyes out.",1465776000,5,288,5.020833333333333
8583597,2,B00CMTCJXS,"Beware! ""Mulholland Drive"" does not have extras,at least none I can access, despite there appearing to be some on the blu-Ray menu. Luckily, Criterion has their version out now so I'll be get to that one as well.",1446163200,,212,4.605263157894737
8583598,4,B00CMTCJXS,"Four stars, with the caveat that if I was German, like this set, I'd probably give it five. As none of these films are available on Blu-ray in the US, this is likely the best we'll get for a while (Lost Highway finally arrived on a bare-bones DVD just in time for Blu-ray to take over).

The burning question is ""will this play on US Blu-ray players?"" The answer is that yes, it will, or at least it will play on a PS3, and therefore likely will play on other domestic models. You'll have to switch the spoken language to English (the films are, somewhat bizarrely, dubbed in German rather than subtitled), but the menu is quite easy to figure out even if you don't speak a word of German.

The subsequent issue is whether or not it's worth the price for the upgrade. The price issue you'll have to decide for yourself, but the picture quality is certainly an improvement. One of the very first shots (post-credits) in Lost Highway, featuring a strung-out Bill Pullman sitting in a dimly-lit room, is grainy and smeared-looking, but fear not; it's by far the worst-looking shot in the transfer, which picks up the ball quite nicely after this worrisome start. The blacks are incredibly deep and rich, and as anyone who's seen the film can attest, it has some very dark scenes which are given due justice here. Mulholland Drive looks just as good, though it was in less need of an upgrade than the more dimly-photographed Lost Highway. This brings us to Inland Empire, which was shot on standard-def digital video to begin with. One might think there was only just so much resolution that could be coaxed out of the source material to begin with, but the fact is that it does look better here, though, just as with the DVD version, the quality is widely variable from shot to shot (the ""clock room"" upstairs from the theater in the film's closing act is still quite grainy, and one shot of Laura Dern's face in a darkened car is barely-recognizable mush). In all, it's the best way to watch the film, but for one caveat: the scene where Lost Girl tells Dern's character how to burn a piece of silk with a cigarette and peer through the hole, which was in barely-audible English with subtitles, is now missing the subs. (The Polish segments are still subtitled as before.) For anyone new to the film, this will make the scene really hard to follow, and if there was ever a film that didn't need to be harder to follow, it's this one.

UPDATE: I recently got an X-Box for its 4k player, and discovered that the bonus features WILL play on that unit. Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive feature numerous interviews with the actors and on-set documentary footage. Inland Empire features just two trailers for the film-my previous advice about keeping the DVD version for its abundant extras still applies.
All three films have bonus features attached, but for some reason none of them will play. They'd likely have been German language-only, but still, it would be nice to be able to look at them. It makes this set a perfectly fine upgrade from the bare-bones Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive DVDs, but hang onto the standard-def Inland Empire DVD if you've got it, as it's stuffed full of bonus material that isn't duplicated here, even if you do manage to play it.",1421280000,9,3261,4.599656357388316
8583599,4,B00CMTCJXS,"Movies look great and play just fine. Supplemental materials only play audio, no picture. I bought this for the movies so I am happy.",1412553600,2,133,4.583333333333333
8583600,5,B00CMTCJXS,"Only way to get Mulholland Drive in Blu-ray. German product, but plays fine in my American deck.",1410307200,2,96,4.705882352941177
8583601,5,B00CMTCJXS,Until we get more Lynch blu-ray releases for Region A (don't hold your breath) this is the best way to get your hands on all three of these films in HD. They do play in Region A blu-ray players. The only thing you'll have to do is change the audio over from German to English which is an English 5.1 and sounds great. Get your Lynch fix with this set!,1408665600,11,351,4.0285714285714285
