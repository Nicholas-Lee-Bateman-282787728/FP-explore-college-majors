8643504,4,B00IN3L1NQ,This is an older version of Alice in Wonderland with stop motion animation. There are a lot of split screen scenes. I liked it but the quality of the picture and the sound is not that great. I still liked it because I have not seen another Alice movie like this.,1451088000,2,262,4.1568627450980395
8643505,3,B00IN3L1NQ,"I mainly just write this review to warn other collectors, like me. This is the same film as the one on the pink DVD Amazon lists as Alice in Wonderland (1950). For some reason they show a different date and make no mention of Lou Bunin anywhere in the pink DVDs store page on Amazon which makes it quite confusing.

Anyway, if you own the pink one already then you technically have this one too. The difference is quality. The pink DVD release has a much lower quality and looks like it was copied over from a VHS tape to DVD. While both are blurry from age, and not spectacularly filmed in the first place, this one is visually superior. So if you are curious which one to get and haven't already got this one in your Alice collection it does seem like this is the better of the two as this one appears to have been transferred from the original film. As such both color quality and look is overall better. The pink DVD also has tracking lines throughout the film, like you get on a VHS player, where as this one does not. The pink DVDs color is off, where purples (for example) show up lighter blue and seem too bright so they glow the wrong color. At least, the colors on this version (which, again, appears to be a direct film transfer) are much different and do not appear smudged like in the other version.

I know this is all technical, but that's not really super important. Since both are different transfers of the film, and I'm a weird collector, I don't mind having both of them, but people should know that it is the same film and what the differences are. This is the one to see.",1450483200,20,1593,4.289036544850498
8643506,4,B00IN3L1NQ,"The transfer is quite mediocre, and the colour is atrocious.
Having said that, this is a quite fascinating re-telling of the Carroll classic making quite clear who the ""originals"" were of Dodgson's fanciful; creature, and using some marvelously lurid puppets to bring them to life.
Imagine a collaboration between Jim Henson, Edward Gorey, and  Terry Gilliam, on an Ed Wood Budget, and you'll get just an inkling of this work.
Buried upon its ""release"" (virtually NOWHERE!) because of competition to the Disney version (this one is FAR more accurate) it should be seen by every serious fantacist.",1398297600,6,596,5.144329896907217
