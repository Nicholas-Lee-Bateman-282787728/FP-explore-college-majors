8275252,1,B000KWZ1M0,"My eyes popped when the DVD arrived as on its cover it said running time : 25 mins. I should have spotted it when I checked it out on Amazon but I didn't so I deserved to be ripped off. It's a very short DVD of 25 mins and yet it covers around 12 dishes. So you can imagine how brief each segment is...[]... Worse still, the production is decidedly amateurish. The narration is robotic and lifeless. The camera angle is very unprofessional. The presentation of ingredients and cooking process is dull and unappetizing. I watched the DVD once and decided to get rid of it. A total waste. I won't recommend it except to my worst enemy. My worst buy on Amazon. Enough said.",1264982400,,670,4.368
