""James Brown - The Godfather Of Soul""  provides insight into the development of his music in general, thanks in  part to comments from Stevie Wonder, B.B. King, and biographer Bruce  Tucker. For the already initiated the very rare stills which permeate the  production,  plus the c. 1969 live clips of ""Please, Please,  Please"" and ""Say It Loud, I'm Black and I'm Proud"" should  make it more than worthwhile. (Looka here - How about a future expanded  edition with long excerpts from the 1968 TV Specials? Just kidding...).",965347200,3,683,5.2407407407407405
