2299218,5,B0009KQP64,"This is the 4th Miss Spider DVD I have purchased through Amazon and it will definatally not be the last.  My daughter was mezmirozed by the colors right from the start and now at 18 months can follow the story line.  ""Spider"" was one of her first words!! My husband and I really appreciate the valuable messages in each story and having a few of the bugs being adopted is really cool since she has a few adpoted cousins.  We really don't mind having to watch it a million times.  Dont pass up the oppurtunity to add this to your collection- cant beat the price here at Amazon either!",1163635200,,583,4.321100917431193
2299219,5,B0009KQP64,"My 2 1/2 year old received this DVD from her Grandma as a gift. I watched all 8 episodes with my daughter and we have been hooked every since. My daughter's favorite episode is ""Sing It Sister."" She'll sing right along with the characters...""la,la,la,la,la...lady bugs"",etc.

The animation, storylines, and moral lessons are great. My husband even watched a couple of episodes with us!  This is a great show and I hope it says around for awhile.  I plan on ordering more Miss Spider/Sunny Patch DVDs soon.",1131494400,2,505,4.848837209302325
2299220,5,B0009KQP64,"My 4 year old daughter loves Miss Spider so when I heard that this DVD would be released; I was quick to pre-order it. All the episodes are great. The music and voices are so soothing. The storylines are good with wonderful values. As a mom, I am really impressed with this series. Hope there will be more to come on DVD!",1122595200,,321,4.193548387096774

8062818,5,B0009KQP64,"Great movie for kids with vision impairments!

We purchased this Little Spider All Pupa'ed Out DVD movie for our 11-year-old disabled daughter with vision issues. Delivered super-fast as always, thank you Amazon! This movie keeps her attention for hours. The characters are big and have bright colors. The quality of this DVD looks amazing on our HDTV! This is our second Miss Spider movie that we purchased because our daughter loves these videos so much.

Currently, this one is her favorite DVD to watch. It features 8 stories that run for a total time of 93 minutes. You can pick a favorite story or play all stories back to back. It doesn't automatically play, like some kid DVDs, you do have to hit play with the remote or on the DVD.

You can look up Miss Spider on YouTube to see if this DVD will gather your child's attention. The quality of this DVD is so much better than YouTube and is convenient to have, so you can use without the internet. This DVD is a bargain and I can't wait to get more of these Miss Spider movies to add to our collection :-).

8062822,5,B0009KQP64,"My son has been watching this video for over a year and he still loves it! He loves to say 'cookie' and 'butterfly'. The songs are terrific, and he is always trying to sing them. It has nice stories and even when it is a bit scary, it is not too scary. I believe it teaches him alot, I highly recommend these series. I actually get a few minutes to myself when they are playing.",1271116800,,378,4.053333333333334

8062824,5,B0009KQP64,"My son is 2. He LOVES Miss Spider. I mean borderlined obsessed with this silly cartoon. We have Comcast cable and ""on demand"" carries Miss Spider, But, only a few episodes at a time. Whenever he is tired , or not, he wants to lay down and watch Miss Spider. It makes my husband and I laugh because we hear him Laughing, singing and saying the lines.( I'm not kidding  when I say he loves this show) He adores Bounce-he is our fav too. -He  has actually started being so kind to everyone because it teaches such nice manners-
This is one show that I am so glad that he watches. It's quite funny at times. As a parent you dread having to sit and watch certain childrens programs. I am sorry to say that I too know the words to these episodes.
  I didn't know what to get him for Christmas. I Know that he is now getting just about all  the DVD's. Now, he doesn't have to watch the same 4 shows over and over again. I never knew they made so many movies! YEAH!",1196553600,,957,4.096256684491979
