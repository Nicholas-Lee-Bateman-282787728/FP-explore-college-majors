2080974,5,B0002E34C0,"Top notch, first rate production!  The presentation produced the same feelings of awe, wonder, and excitement about the universe that Carl Sagan's series used to evoke.

Visually stunning and greatly thought provoking.  And most refreshing, not a lightweight treatment of the ideas - the theories of mediocrity and priveledge as to our place in the cosmos are covered completely; no strawman here!

Get this one and Unlocking the Secrets of Life together; I've bought over five copies of each as gifts with no disappointments or returns.",1105660800,21,537,5.209302325581396
2080975,5,B0002E34C0,The Privileged Planet sets forth numerous enlightening facts about Earth's unique place in the universe.  Students from about 12 years to 100 will find valuable information set forth in clear logic with vivid illustrations.  The video uses factual information to counterbalance and refute so much of the pseudo science popularized in most educational settings.  This one is well worth the price!,1097712000,6,395,5.442622950819672
2080976,5,B0002E34C0,"Viewing audiences will be treated to an intriguing discussion about the possibility of detecting purpose or design in nature.  The movie summarizes and illustrates key points of ""The Privileged Planet"" hypothesis that was first presented by Astrobiologist Guillermo Gonzalez and Philosopher Jay Richards in their superb book of the same title.  It functions as a wonderful companion to the book and also stands upon its own as an enjoyable, first-rate film.

""The Privileged Planet"" contains stellar animation and good accompanying music.  The film features the unforgettable John Rhys-Davies (from Indiana Jones and LOTR fame) as narrator, and his incredible voice captivates you from the opening moments of the movie.

The film also includes several other scientists (such as Paul Davies, Donald Brownlee, Robert Jastrow and Seth Shostak), who provide background information on scientific discoveries and also chime in with their respective points of view.  The DVD also contains plenty of worthwhile special features, including a fun Q&A section.

Viewing audiences will be treated to an intriguing discussion about the possibility of detecting purpose or design in nature.  This film has the advantage of presenting such ideas in the context of physics, astronomy and astrobiology-so there is none of the rancor that generally accompanies the discussion of such ideas in biology.  It is very refreshing, indeed.

This is a delightful film, with serious intellectual substance and high production values.  It is highly recommended!

(This reviewer is a staff member of the Center for Science & Culture.  However, I became intrigued by the hypothesis prior to any working relationship with CSC.)",1097452800,59,1697,5.505791505791506
2080977,5,B0002E34C0,"Very entertaining and information-packed and professionally produced. Good enough and significant enough that if one were to see but one movie in a lifetime, ""The Privileged Planet"" would be a good choice!

Gives many reasons, especially from the relatively new discipline of astrobiology, that confirm the properties of our physical universe, and especially our planet earth, are uniquely ""fine tuned"" to be able to support intelligent life. Shows how our precise ""position"" in the universe and its particular laws of physics and chemistry -- with their particular and precise mathematical constants and constraints -- have been exceedingly helpful not only to support intelligent life but also for our ability to ""see"" the properties of our solar system, our galaxy and the structure and properties of our universe as a whole.

Among other things, the presentation shows how full solar eclipses caused by the unique size and particular orbital relationship with our unique moon enable us to conveniently discover much -- first about our sun and then about the rest of universe.

The presentation lets the facts themselves ""cry out"" -- ""Creator""! -- apparently an intelligent Designer that wants man to be able to study and understand His handiwork! No particular religious view is advanced, though the historical thread of the presentation confirms that the belief in a rational universe created and governed by a Lawgiver did lead to the genesis of ""modern science"".

I commend this presentation to the vital education of every person!",1097366400,24,1538,5.290983606557377
2080978,5,B0002E34C0,"From the folks at Illustra Media comes their latest nail in the coffin of exhausted theories on the evolutionary process.

  Its a pretty big nail too.

  This is the first well produced video that I've seen on the concept of the Anthropic Principle, the observation that our habitable earth...is just a little too perfect for life to exist when compared to the rest of the known Universe.

  I'm pleased to see Dr. VanMeurs doctoral dissertation of a review on a video he's apparently never seen.

  So for everybody else...here's a review by someone who HAS watched the video.

  Very well produced and digitally filmed.  The graphic presentations are excellent and near the level of the first edition in this series.

  The scientists interviewed are very articulate and not out to bash you with the concept of ""God"" but to point out that the concept of our Universe actually teeming with life... is something that seems to fly in the face of the known facts.

  FOR EXAMPLE:  If we just took the space between Alpha Centauri and the star we call our Sun (about 4.3 light years)  there seems to be only about a 2 mile layer of atmosphere that is known to be habitable by humans, without the aid of some sort of equipment.

  Most of the video spends its time on the major points of the Anthropic Principle...right kind of sun, location in the solar system, location in the galaxy, atmosphere, presence of water...etc.

  I wish there had been more video of the earth's landscapes used...simply because our earth is beautiful...and the respect this video gives it is breathtaking.

  I found myself being in awe of the minuscule proportion of my existence as compared to the rest of the universe, yet somehow trying to figure out in all that space...why so little of it is accessible to a human being and why are we concsious of this fact?

  The video should be an excellent starting point to start any discussion on the eternal question... ""Why?""

  Its been said that the Intelligent Design movement is dangerous.  Dangerous to who?  Those who have the most to lose in a debate I guess.  Those who have no answer to the ""Why?""

  One technical flaw...on the bonus features, one of the pages on the Q & A section has no picture...but still works.",1094515200,377,2250,4.656410256410257

2080981,5,B0002E34C0,"Documentary of a brilliant book that reveals that the same features in Earth's design and location that make it suitable for life and protect it from cosmic cataclysm's - e.g. supernovae - also enable us to peer deeply into the universe and discover the great Designer's intent. It provides an unassailable argument for an Intelligent Designer of the cosmos, by showing that our privileged planet has dozens of specific features that are essential to the formation or sustainment of life; and the improbability of all of them occurring randomly in any other planet in the universe is, pardon the pun, astronomically great. They also show how the size and location and location of our sun and moon allow for the perfect total solar eclipse - from which important discoveries have been. All this affirms what Solomon wrote: ""It is the glory of God to conceal a matter; it is the glory of kings to search out a matter"" (Proverbs 25:2). Only our foolish generation could attribute a genius and beauty of design at every level that is immeasurably greater than ours to an unthinking, dead cosmos that is infinitely deader and stupider than we are.",1503878400,,1142,4.861538461538461

2081057,5,B0002E34C0,"""Because of the reflection of sunlight the earth seems to be sitting in a beam of light, as if there were some special significance to this small world..."" ~ Carl Sagan

Have you ever wondered about the meaning of life? How did we all get here and what is our purpose? Well this DVD does not exactly answer these questions except to imply that there was a Creator. I did not find this film to be overly religious. It seemed more scientific to me.

What this film basically deals with is our position in the universe and how special it actually is. The fact that life exists in a hostile universe is amazing. This film shows how amazing it actually is.

I loved the discussions about how the earth is in a ""Goldilock's zone"" - not too hot, not too cold. If we were any closer to the sun water would evaporate and if we were farther away the water would turn to ice. So you can see logically how perfect our placement is in regards to the sun and other planets.

There are some bonus sections on this DVD that are really worth watching. I enjoyed watching Candice Hansen explain her viewpoint on the famous Voyager picture of earth.

So this is not overly religious, has nothing to do with evolution and I don't think will offend anyone greatly as it presents scientific facts in a logical way.

Then there's the thinking of old minds like Stephen Hawking, old thinking based on old and refuted science of the 'dark ages'; Hawking is trapped in a prison of his own body, and although he may've been once 'brilliant', logically he must suffer some mental issues clouding his sanity. The possibility of life elsewhere is beyond scientific absurdity (Borel's law) - This presentation exposes a Liberal God hating media as well, and this presentation present findings with solid science and delivered with humility.

The people who made the dvd are scientists at the top of their field, and they put the message across in such a clear way that our earth is not only unique in the universe but shows such evidence of intelligent design right down to the last detail.  The placing of our earth in the universe is so precise that it enables us to see so much from our vantage point here on a spiral arm of the milky way galaxy, that we can now realise the vastness of space and just how many billions of galaxies there are.  It is reassuring to know that the creator cares for us so much that he has given such attention to detail!  He really wants us to appreciate what he has created.

Various scientist are interviewed regarding their field of study and how finely tuned the universe is that allows life to live on this planet.  There is a very good case made that makes it abundantly clear (I think) that life could not just happen.  I would recommend this to anyone.  This would also be good to watch with high school/college aged kids who are dealing with the pressure to conform to evolutionary belief at school.

2081122,5,B0002E34C0,"This is a beautiful documentary, well-made and well-reasoned. A number of scientists, astronomers and cosmologists are interviewed in it, whose discoveries have revealed that in 20 fundamental parameters our planet is expertly designed and ""fine-tuned for life."" These are such mathematically precise parameters that they cannot be there by chance. Our Earth is also located in a special position in our galaxy that is best suited to make the scientific experiments and do the scientific observations necessary to reveal the true nature of the Cosmos, and only humans were given the complex brains capable of making these fundamental scientific observations and discoveries.

It thus appears that the Intelligent Designer has so arranged His ordered Cosmos (rather than a Chaos) so it reveals significant things about Him, just as any human artist is revealed in his or her creations. And He so designed and made human nature so we can ""think His thoughts after Him.""

The Apostle Paul said basically the same thing about 2,000 years ago when he addressed the leading ancient Greek Philosophers and scientists gathered on Mars Hill in Athens, in these words (Acts 17:25-28, RSV):

""...since he himself gives to all men life and breath and everything, And he made from one every nation of men to live on all the face of the earth,
having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their habitation, that they should seek God, in the hope that they might feel after him and find him. Yet he is not far from each one of us, for `In him we live and move and have our being'; as even some of your poets have said, `For we are indeed his offspring.' ""

In other words, Paul was saying the Creator-God arranged things so He could be discovered and known through His works!  In fact, in his letter to the Romans (1:19-20 RSV), Paul actually stated those people who don't see the Creator in His Created works are ""without excuse""!

""For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. Ever since the creation of the world his invisible nature, namely, his eternal power and deity, has been clearly perceived in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse....""

In recent years, over 600 different scientists, representing many different scientific disciplines, living all over the earth, have become convinced of the inadequacy of their earlier materialistic views of the universe. They have come to the conclusion there must be a higher INVISIBLE INTELLIGENCE, a Higher Spiritual Reality, beyond the material universe, Who is the Source of the ""irreducible complexity"" observed in the little wonders known as ""biological machines,"" and in the extremely complex CODED INFORMATION in the DNA CODES that are the ""Source Codes"" for all life on this Planet. All earlier Materialistic and evolutionary theories are inadequate to explain the complex designs and ""Source Codes"" in the Genomes of all life forms on our planet. Only a HIGHER INTELLIGENCE, outside and beyond the material Universe, could design and create all life forms, and create Human conscious beings who can recognize Him in our marvelously designed and fashioned ""Privileged Planet.""",1367539200,2,3192,5.022684310018904

2081136,5,B0002E34C0,"This DVD explains the uniqueness of planet Earth in the universe as the only world we know of that harbors life as well as the unique circumstances that allow life on planet earth.

This DVD is a very well-made and polished production with excellent cinematography, CGI and special effects as well as the wonderful voice of John Rhys-Davies narrating the video. I was very impressed with the quality of the presentation as well as finding it both interesting and enjoyable.

The DVD itself revolves around the idea that Earth is priviledged and different. I believe it does a very good job of showing the many things which allow life to exist on our planet from the position of Earth in the solar system in the ""Goldilocks zone"" (not too hot, not too cold) to the recycling iron core which produces a magnetic field capable of shielding from solar winds to the presence of a large moon that stabilizes the Earth's wobble, thus allowing stable temerate zones. I was truly amazed by the sheer number of requirements required for a planet to be capable of supporting life.

The DVD not only shows what makes Earth special, but also shows how our place in the Milky Way galaxy is also in a favorable zone for allowing life to exist, far away from black holes, novas and other phenomona which would render our planet lifeless. The DVD then moves on to a discussion of meaning in a universe we have been told is simply matter and energy combined by random chance. Are the chances too low for an Earth to have ever been created by pure random chance? I think many would agree after viewing this DVD and I was impressed by the strength of the arguements in favor of an ordered, created world in which there is purpose and meaning.

In conclusion, this is a very well-made DVD which is entertaining and succeeds in provoking thought in the viewer. I give this video five stars.",1356566400,4,1868,4.6006006006006

Why are there numerous factors that make life possible upon Earth and why is Earth the best place for scientific discovery, are two questions that the presentation attempts to answer.  I would say that those interviewed do a very good job of providing answers.  The Privileged Planet is very thought-provoking and the thoughtful viewer will likely want to watch it many times.  There is a great deal of good material here.

We often hear from the naturalists/philosophers that the earth and life on it are  mere products of chance.  Also, we hear that life must have appeared very easily in other parts of the universe.  All a planet needs is water and there is going to be life.  We hear also that Earth occupies no special place in the universe.  The viewer will find much in The Privileged Planet that indeed challenges these oft-heard notions.

The cinemetography is amazing; anyone who loves astronomy will find much here that is amazing to watch including a full solar eclipse over India; and not only are their great pictures of astronomical objects, there are excellent animations of probes making their way through our solar system and a rover doing exploratory research on Mars.

The film's content is not just for the specialist but for the general public as well.  There is food for thought here for everyone.  Questions are asked that philosophers, scientists, and the ordinary person have been asking for centuries: is planet earth a product of chance or was it created for a purpose?  The viewer is left to make up his/her own mind.

I especially liked the quote from Copernicus: The mechanism of the universe, wrought for us by a supremely good and orderly Creator....  One speaker interviewed commented that this was not a conclusion of Copernicus's but an assumption.  For me the quote from Copernicus gives the answer to the reason why Earth is so well-suited to life and is an ideal place to conduct scientific discovery.",1319932800,9,2101,5.2395209580838324

Because these people only want to prove their faith (an affront to God, if you ask me.  Theologians have no place proving the existence of God.  That is what faith is all about)

2081173,1,B0002E34C0,"The argument for purpose - the basic one which this DVD seeks to profess, exists in a basic false duality. The first five minutes casually represent science as a worldview that is governed by what they call a ""principle of mediocrity"" - and by extrapolation, the idea that ""nothing is exceptional"" or ""nothing is significant."" This is a philosophical typification that lacks any depth, and overlooks the actual thoughts and opinions of scientists. The film is not really concerned with such matters, of course, the ""principle of mediocrity"" being basically a polarized straw-man for the relativistic perspectives of astronomy and science. Throughout the film, this opening designation serves as a shallow waste receptacle. Clearly, the producers think in basic dualities- in this case the notion of ""Incidental"" or ""Accidental,"" which they disingenuously present science itself as holding - versus the teleological stance of ""Design"" and ""Purpose."" This film goes on to raise up the latter position, in order to shadow the former, all the while being a daftly oversimplified endeavor in and of itself. This basic lack of philosophical depth or dynamic inquiry betrays the film's true role - that of subtle ""trojan horse"" proselytizing for a belief in an interventionist creator and designer. This signature is distinctly Judeo-Christian, yet this film purposefully mutes most indication. I find this somewhat dishonest.

This film best illuminates modern religious thinking, along the lines of the recent ""Intelligent Design"" philosophy, a modern clone of the same age-old teleology which constantly pulls at the emotional centers of the human psyche. It is no surprise that a philosophy such as ""Intelligent Design"" is popular and appealing to Western culture (particularly the USA), which is steeped in both interventionist deities who literally interact with their believers, and prophetic religious thought. The USA also tends to exhibit intellectual difficulty / aversion to relativistic concepts requiring broad educated perspective, and with complexity itself. The perceived 'complexity' of something is not a function of the object being observed, rather, it depends only on the level of knowledge / capacities of the observer! History routinely shows this, as the tyranny of physical evidence, and increased systemic understanding prevails consistently. Thus, here we find another modern ""god of the gaps"" injected not into the territory of the unknown, but into the area of complexity, betraying the same sort of incredulity. This film also shows the highly provincial paradigms that have resulted from these elements of thought. Logically, how are we even to distinguish designed from un-designed in a non-comparative sense? Each of these distinctions relies on basic familiarity with the other. Now of course, design theorists do this routinely, applying their skills to palpable territory- such as archaeology and geology. Yet clearly, the film's philosophers for ""design"" are not design theorists in any true, palpable, scientific, or even earthbound sense. They allude to the detection of supernatural design, merely by saying ""it's highly complex,"" and completely bypassing all the logical steps to that conclusion (and hoping the layman audience won't notice). Despite what they may say about the ""mediocracy"" or ""materialism"" of science, logically, their very own argument doesn't fly at all when broken apart into it's own basic assumptions. The public rarely goes deeper than this argument's superficial, emotional aire of ""divine"" coherence.

The film's boldest (and daftest) attempt to push it's point is with a series of ""prerequisites"" for complex life, each assigned a numerical value. The purpose of this is to depict a sense of astronomical unlikelihood as to the coalescence of all the known ""factors"" required for complex life. To the scientifically literate mind, this section is quite unscientific. While indeed some of these prerequisites are accepted by astrobiologists (the science of developing life) as applying universally, many are not, being arbitrary or premature suppositions. Human beings are in fact comprised of the most common elements in the universe, in the same relative ratios as they occur in the universe. We are carbon-based, and carbon also happens to be the most chemically active, and dynamic element in the universe. In only the last 10 years alone, we have already observed 400 extrasolar planets - mainly large ones detectable by their sheer gravitational pull on parent stars. Solar systems are in fact routine among medium class stars such as ours. All this comes only from observing our own stellar neighborhood, a very miniscule part of our enormous galaxy. It will likely turn out that life itself is routine also, as our technology becomes even more refined as to detect it's traces - but to be perfectly fair it is too soon to know, and as such, imprudent to say for sure. The film conveniently leaves out such basic modern observations such as this, which would of course keep things in good, level scientific perspective. One of the most ridiculous ""prerequisites"" - the existence of large planets in a solar system to shield small ones - is a view as arcane as it is laughable. One of the liabilities of our solar system having large planets with immense gravitational influence, is that they can actually direct asteroids into earth's path [See: BBC ""Wonders of Our Solar System,"" Episode 4). Also, by only it's proximity, the moon does a much better job of ""deflecting"" space matter than any distant planet ever could! The logic behind the ""large planet"" point alone should send out a gigantic red flag.

There is so much that we don't know about the universe; it is a true frontier, of an unimaginable scale. Despite centuries of terrestrial advancements, astronomy is yet still in it's infancy, often defying our understanding and expectations. Our hypotheses of gravity & star formation indicate that we should expect to find old stars in the tumultuous center of our own galaxy- and yet we find young ones. Astrobiology is itself practically a brand new science, being mere decades old, and drawing from studies of astronomy, chemistry, biology, and abiogenesis. What would be strangest according to astrobiology, and perhaps most indicative of outside 'design,' is not the obvious fact of complex life existing in a stable system where it is expected. If we find life where we would not expect it, that would be something truly unique- perhaps like the extreme-ophiles on the sea floor of earth, which exist against all odds. These interesting new sciences are just budding, and constantly changing as input from almost all fields of science comes in. This film is neither illuminating, in depth, or accurate on any of these important/related subjects, instead glossing over such basic knowledge and observations about the universe, with such a basic lack of curiosity. There are many facts which the audience must be familiar with, in order to have any substantial perspective of what is being said. In fact, this film depends on a certain ignorance in it's audience.

This film follows the expected two-model pattern so common to creationism, leaving most who watch it with the false sense that they ought to have ""one"" point of view, or ""the other"" - or choose one ""side"" or ""the other."" The logically false two-model idea, that if one side doesn't know something, or points out some ""weakness"" in the other side, that somehow it defaults to the proposal of the ""side"" doing the criticism. This, of course, is fundamentally illogical. Yet, this film is not about provoking thought, but rather leading (or; misleading) it to a distinctly religious (and provincial) conclusion held by the producer. Anyone who is actually interested in the nuances of logic, critical, broad-perspective thinking, and science, cannot help but be simultaneously amused and chagrined at this ""pop-culture"" dispute that exists in it's own unique intellectual vacuity. It is very sad indeed that people go on & on about these subjects, never able to exit the paradox of their own illusions. Very sad indeed.",1260144000,16,8161,5.256134969325154

For those who are mind numbed robots schooled in the closed society of Darwinism (as I was for many years) then this is a must watch.  Have the courage to question your premis and to try to open your mind to new thoughts.  It may not change your mind, but it will help you see the other side of the argument.

It explores the issue of whether or not Earth is a unique environment in terms of supporting complex life in the vastness of the Universe.  The contention is that there are extremely few possible locations in the universe that could possibly support complex life forms.

This study is based on the work of Dr. Guillermo Gonzalez (PhD Astronomy) and Dr. Jay Richards (PhD Philosophy).  They contend that out of all of the places in the universe (composed of billions of galaxies and billions of stars in each of those), there are an incredibly small number where life can exist.  This is due to numerous necessary factors including such things as water, gravity, temperature, oxygen, chemical composition, etc.

It is very well researched and extremely thought provoking.  Although only one hour long, it is loaded with information.  I plan to get the book also to more fully absorb their work.  Highly recommended!",1237420800,7,971,5.056603773584905

The producers have wisely allowed the viewer to ponder the meanings of the FACTS about our galaxy as they are revealed....and point out that it is indeed incredible that we can even discover these FACTS in the first place.  Could it be because the Creator chose to allow them to be revealed through the mysteries and phenomena of solar eclipses? Through the discoveries we have been able to make about the complexity of our planet and the utter improbability that this was all random chance?  It takes more faith to believe it was all random chance!  This production was very well done, and included outstanding visual animations as well as interesting discussions by scientists about our galaxy's properties.  Clearly, the majority of people will draw the same conclusions and recognize that there is a stamp of Intelligent Design on our universe.  It fills you with an even greater love for the God who loved us first, and created us in His image.  Those who choose not to see this are truly to be pitied, for they are missing out on THE most incredible blessing this life has to offer, not to mention for all eternity.

Recognizing the inherent human need to seek out and relate to patterns, it is easy to see how people either knowingly or unknowingly get duped.
It may be uncomfortable for people to accept that perhaps we are not special in the scheme of the universe, that the Earth is not particularly important outside of our own understanding but discomfort is never a criteria for doubt. You may not like reality, but that doesn't mean you should ignore it and replace it with comforting concepts to get a nice, fat, warm cozy working.

Beautifully filmed, logical, filled with facts I hadn't known about what it takes to make a planet where life can exist. The author's thesis is further that the same conditions that make life possible also make possible scientific study of the sun and the universe. Only perhaps 1 in a trillion trillion potential planets would have these properties!

In fact, everywhere we look in nature, the evolution model fails to produce evidence of NON-design, which ought to cause us to conclude that there has to be a Designer. This particular video concerns astronomy and cosmology, but the pattern exists in biology, geology, paleontology, history, archaeology, and their subdivisions. [...]

It's interesting that Guillermo Gonzalez, the astronomer who authored the book from which the video was made (The Privileged Planet: How Our Place in the Cosmos is Designed for Discovery) -- was denied tenure at Iowa State U strictly because the authorities don't agree with his viewpoint!

It's a battle between Religion and Religion.  Just read how the opponents of this video attack it, and you see that they are guilty of the exact tactics they are the accusing video of taking.  Most throw out thoughts that are blind, unsubstaniated, and without credible source.  I can't help but think of the story of Lazarus and the rich man (Luke 16:20).  Those who cannot hear, will not hear.  ""But even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing, whose minds the god of this age has blinded, who do not believe, lest the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine on them."" Second Corinthians 4:3-4.  It does not matter who, not even if the greatest and most beloved scientist in the history of science (not even Newton, Kepler, Galileo, Bacon, Kelvin, or Fleming amount to much in the eyes of those who disagree with them) came to say they were wrong.  Not even if we stored Mega, Giga, Tera bites of evidence against them, using their own formulas and theories, would they admit they were wrong.

It's a refreshing change to watch a scientific discussion of the Earth's uniqueness in the solar system, if not the universe.

Scientific theorists can project their own point of view and that is their right, just as it is the right of people to listen and accept or reject it. This DVD presents some very strong evidence that the earth was placed in its ""privileged"" position for a purpose. Some may reject this assumption, but I have yet to hear an alternate explanation that resonates with me.

Some people may resent the inference of an Intelligent Designer for whatever reason they can think up. However, their reasons seem to me to be as prejudiced and biased as those who think the world was created in seven 24-hour days or is a flat saucer on the back of a turtle swimming through space.

If you want to hear a plausible and scientifically based presentation for the Earth's unique status in our solar system then you will enjoy this fascinating DVD, ""The Privileged Planet""

Its a must for the video library and I usually don't like these types of films too. I remembered watching science films in school and college and they always seemed to bore me and  it made a great time to catch up on sleep, but this film was so not the case.
This was originally recommended to me by a friend to watch and I'm so glad I did because this film got me to stop and think for once instead of getting lost in my own reality of things, which is to be only entertained.
This film uses Science and mathematics to prove how unique and rare the Earth is, while showing how amazing and small we truly are in the grand scheme of things.  I was not only entertained with the quality of this film and its production, but also learned a great deal about our earth and the Universe because of their unique relationship.  Its a film that really made me think for once with out telling me how to think or drawing my conclusions for me.  It was truly refreshing to have that prospective while enjoying the awesome pictures of our Earth, Universe and beyond.  I might have to rethink that maybe Science and mathematics are not as boring  and useless after all, so for that it has opened up a new prospective of learning.",1184803200,9,1324,4.331983805668016

Either that, or redshift is not a function of retreat speed, but rather that redshift is evidence that light is affected over great distances and suddenly drops to a different energy level just as an electron does when it changes from one orbital path around a nucleus to a higher or lower one. If redshift is the result of tired light, we have lost the ability to say how old the Universe is, indeed we never had that ability.

2081242,4,B0002E34C0,"Copernicus, we are told early in this presentation of an earth that is uniquely and improbably endowed to support complex life, thought the impossible.

It is a notion that is gripping many cosmologists, physicists, and the like in our time. Predictably for the advance of human knowledge, any robust questioning of received wisdom provokes defensive and emotional reaction. Students of the intellectual movement called Intelligent Design (its detractors consider it a religious rather than a scientific enterprise) have grown accustomed to disproportionate responses, an observation that is born out by a quick scan of the reviews of this DVD on amazon.com.

Yet the questions raised here are real. They merit a reasonable response, either by way of affirmation, rebuttal, or at the very least the admission that the queries posed here deserve further investigation.

Though this reviewer is sympathetic to the presentation here, one must admit that an overwrought narrative voice (John Rhys-Davies) and a mysterious soundtrack do not advocate the argument before its skeptics. Yet the photographic images surely drop the jaw of the most religious and the most atheistic of viewers in honest astonishment. Perhaps *here* is modest common ground, waiting to serve all parties as home turf.

After all, as one of the interviewees reminds us, when faced with the uniqueness or not of the solar system we know, 'either answer is interesting'.

The PRIVILEGED PLANET argument assumes that the basic laws of physics as we have come to know them are active and presupposable throughout the universe. Once established, this methodological assumption permits inspection of other planets we know something about in order to discern whether the factors that permit life here are detectable there. One must investigate not only the *number* of other test cases that are out there, but also the presence or active of the life-cultivating factors that make life possible here on earth.

These factors, currently estimated to number about twenty, include:

-liquid water
-a terrestial planet with plate tectonic activity
-an oxygen/nitrogen atmosphere
-a large moon that stabilizes the earth's orbit at a convenient angle
-a circumstellar habitable zone that depends upon a certain kind of star
-shielding from major collisions

The argument is that such a combination of factors is highly unlikely to appear in conjunction anywhere, and certainly more than the one time we know about.

Proponents of Intelligent Design calculate that our planet is 'rare in the universe'. It is quite another move to venture religious conjectures based upon such rarity. Such a conjecture can be abbreviated as 'the question of significance'. Here the title of the DVD comes into play. It asserts that our planet is not only 'rare', but also fortunate, favored, or 'privileged'. That is, did a mind arrange this improbable convergence of factors?  Is there something more to be detected than a 'cosmic lottery'?

The Discovery Institute mounts a cumulative and incremental argument that suggests correlations unlikely to occur other than by some intelligent design. Even our ability to observe the universe aligns with the habitable nature of the earth in that both appear to be unique to our solitary planet.

Not only astrophysicists and cosmologists ought to exercise the capacity to admit puzzlement and awe before these questions. Philosophers of science are just as inevitably drawn in, particularly when one considers the discoverability and intelligibility of the universe vis--vis observers.

These arguments, placed upon the table in the public arena, do not require a religious answer. However it behooves honest observes to join the question of how the universe as we know it came to be and then to ask whether we can know why?

The postulation of a mind is perhaps not the only plausible answer to these conundra. Yet if such a postulate explains the data more coherently and more economically than any other, what will we do then?

It seems fair to ask.",1172966400,9,4037,5.256609642301711

The evidence presented in this DVD could be just as correct as any other theory, for belief in either takes a measure of faith. This point of view is more believable.

In my opinion, the evidence gathered and presented in this DVD has a more logical progression to a conclusion than the leaps over the gaps we are expected to take with evolutionism.",1172275200,9,583,4.752475247524752
2081244,4,B0002E34C0,"This documentary discusses the possibilty of life emerging on other planets in the Universe besides Earth. While many people assume that since the Universe is nearly infinite, there are many planets very similar to Earth upon which life may exist. This film calls into question that reasoning and runs down a list of factors that must exist in order for life to form and thrive on a planet. For instance, the presence of liquid water is vital to life, and temperatures conducive to maintaining it are found only in a certain range of distance from a star (not too close and hot and not to far and cold). They list a number of factors and since they supposedly all need to be in place for life to exist, the conclusion is that it is a long shot for life to have formed anywhere else. It is an interesting point of view which seeks to offer the opinion that despite the vastness of the Universe, we may live on the only planet that fosters life.",1172016000,7,943,4.425287356321839

The Privileged Planet is a thinly veiled appeal for Intelligent Design.

The science in the film starts honestly enough with numerous observations of the remarkable beauty and complexity of life on earth. But when the list of wondrous observations is completed and the work of science begins, this film takes a sharp right turn into speculation and theology. The calculation used to speculate on the rarity of life in the universe (us on earth) is laughable.

2081260,5,B0002E34C0,"In this video you will hear compelling reasons to conclude that Earth is unique in the universe, and designed as well. The two points are made seperately first, then combined toward the end.

To make the point that the Earth is unique a small set of various factors that the Earth requires to sustain life. Some examples include: temperature range, distance from the sun, the type of sun, the size of earth, the type of atmosphere, the moon tides, the size of the moon, the appropriate ""wobble"" of the earth and tilt of its axis, the amount of water, the amount of solid earth, location in the galaxy, etc. The chances of such a combination of these and more reasons are beyond astronomical...and that's the point. You shouldn't expect that you can travel across the universe and find another planet so finely-tuned to support intelligent life.

The second point points out reasons to believe that there is PURPOSE built in around us, not just one or two coincidences, but apparently designed conditions with the purpose of our learning. Examples like: the size and closeness of the moon seems to perfectly fit in a way that not only eclipses, but leaves just enough room to show the sun's corona, which was used to discover the sun is made of mostly hydrogen. Or placement in the galaxy allows us vision of not only our own galaxy, but of many others as well. That the math that governs physics is fairly simple, so that we may understand how physics works.

Lastly, the film brings up the amazing balance of phyisics that is so precise that to do something like make gravity the slightest bit stronger or weaker would make life impossible. And there are numerous necessary settings that you wouldn't expect randomness to produce.

Everyone should see this film and think about what would expand these ideas or disprove them. Very thought provoking, and significant to all our lives.",1165363200,18,1884,4.769938650306749

They further claim that since Corpernicus' discovery that the Earth was not the center of some solar system or galaxy, then this means a demotion for mankind, thus knocking them and their planet out of any potential privileged position.

This graphic and well done DVD seeks to provide a challenging cosmology for this.  From research on eclipses and other measurements done during SETI and other scientific research and speculation, the theory is put forward that earth is in a privileged position, a pale blue dot swimming in a band of light whose location among arms of Milky Way provides rare conditions in terms of light and temparture and gravity, etc. to provide atmosphere and protection to sustain life, and this life's ability to discover its cosmis position and laws governing such.

Yes it posits the principle of intelligent design, but it in no way attacks any of the sacred cows of modern science. In fact, it is not anti anything.

2081265,2,B0002E34C0,"This program presents some very strange ideas.

1) Since intelligent life in the universe is rare, ""chance"", ""insignificant"", and ""accident"" are not apt in describing earth- ""purpose"" and ""intelligence"" are. Shame on the descriptions of Carl Sagan and Copernicus.

2) Choice of adjectives notwithstanding, life only exists where sentient beings have the most opportune conditions for making discoveries. One has only to marvel at the ease with which complicated mathematical theories fit on a single piece of paper to see the proof of this, or that earth is positioned at an opportune place within the Milky Way galaxy for astronomical exploration of the Cosmos.

By the end, I wondered if I was clueless to a hoax, if this video were an ""accident,"" or if I had missed a punchline somewhere. Then all was revealed to me in an ""elegant,"" ""intelligent"" and ""purposeful"" way. A near eastern tribal deity by the name of Yahweh appeared before me and cleared my path of obscurations. He said, ""My followers destroyed my opposition- worhippers of my wife Asherah and other local deities I had grown tired of - so that they could comprehend my purpose through an unwieldy combination of astrobiology, astronomy, and monotheistic propaganda. Choose to follow one of my three generals: Moses, Jesus, or Mohammed. Then you will be able to comprehend the purpose, intelligence, and design of my vast universe- which was no accident and is quite significant. Charles Darwin is not even a platoon leader for my troops, much less a member of the Triumvirate.""

All became clear to me: a 1 in a trillion ""chance"" means worship Yahweh, Jesus, or Allah.

Psa 19:1-2 KJV  To the chief Musician, A Psalm of David. The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament showeth his handiwork.  (2)  Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night showeth knowledge.

Now that is interesting that David said night unto night showeth  knowlege long before the telescope was ever invented.

Mat 11:25-26 KJV  At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.

I think it interesting that the very concept of Intelligent Design (i.e. The Universe was created by God for His purposes) has come to be so maligned by some who can't prove God exists or not, that they seem to think that with enough jeering it will simply go away (and to anyone with discernment that's not science but a thinly veiled satanic enterprise).

This video is scientifically understandable and cinematically beautiful.

It is revealing that those reviewers who have attempted to discredit this video attack it as being ""christian propoganda"", ""fundamentalist garbage"" etc, etc. Actually, christianity, Jesus, or anything related to Christianity is totally absent from the video, except the idea that the universe has purpose and is intentionally created. But this conclusion comes at the very end of the video, and if you've watched it through to the end you will have already arrived at the conclusion yourself by paying attention to the irrefutable scientific knowledge of the physical properties and processes that make life on earth possible and the discovery of creation possible.

This video goes into the very fundamental essential parameters for a habitable environment, and the ""coincidence"" that they all exist on our planet. But takes it further by recognizing that earth is also the best known location in the universe for DISCOVERING the physical properties and processes of the universe. This is illustrated simply and compellingly in this video.

(One elegant example which is expressed w/ beautiful visuals is the total eclipse of the sun example. ""Coincidentally"" in order for there to be the sort of total eclipse of the sun that can reveal the spectrum of the sun as it is darkened by the blockage of the moon you essentially must have perfection in design. The sun is about 400 times larger than the moon, so for it to work, the sun must also be precisely that far from the moon from our perspective on earth. Basically, since the sun is 400 times larger than the moon and 400 times further from the earth than the moon is, we enjoy these total solar eclipses. But these eclipses also provide the exclusive processes by which we can understand the sun's spectrum, which enables us to pursue an entirely new discipline of astrophysical research and discovery.)

Ultimately, especially if you view the DVD extras and do your homework, it's obvious this is a propaganda tool made by christians, and it's in lockstep w/ so-called intelligent design (also debunked).  This would be a great poetic or philosophical romp, but because it's really portrayed as hard science, it in the end becomes misleading.

Oddly, there is no mention of the well-known Anthropic Principle, which is all this DVD is. Oddly, no counter-theories are presented, such as the background of multiple universes implied by string and other theories.  No mention of Hawking's direct counter-arguments to anthropic principle. The facts are cherry picked using confirmation bias. There's a nagging tendency to compare Earth to other planets in our solar system, rather than to all planets in the universe (major math error there).

The authors are ""surprised"" that conditions on earth seem so rare. Certainly a lottery winner is likewise initially surprised, but a lottery winner would recognize that the rules of statistics were not violated by him/her winning.

Yet, given the much higher complexities of the universe, and especially of life, many are willing to take what seems to me, an irrational position.

Many reviews are contending that just because the odds of chance are so high, doesn't mean that there was a creator.  Then what does it mean??

If we both agree that chance/evolution could not explain our existence, then we must follow that to its logical conclusion that God's existence was not by chance.

The Bible says God always was.  He was not created nor did He evolve.  He always was.  Like it or not, this would be consistent with our findings that chance/evolution is beyond reality.

Can I explain how God could have always existed?  No, but this does not mean that he didn't.  What it means is that there is much more to learn that will be revealed to us when we see Him. In fact, the Bible is full of statements (Old and New Testaments) that discuss this.  Einstein put it this way:

 A response to eSkeptic's online film review

Given the recent events in Dover, Pennsylvania and El Tejon, California, not to mention President Bush's comments last August, Intelligent Design (ID) is no longer flying under the radar for most people.  Consider the recent film review of The Privileged Planet video ([...]) by Charles G. Lambdin for eSkeptic ([...]  Mr Lambdin apparently did not follow the main premise of the video, and apparently has not read the book either.  Instead, Mr. Lambdin provides readers with his interpretation of the videos claims.  Let us take a closer look at Mr. Lambdin's view of the video and its claims.  (For those interested in a light hearted, but detailed account of the material covered in the video, see [...])

Mr. Lambdin begins his article as the usual anti-ID conspiracy theorist frequently does, commenting on the infamous ""wedge document"" and supposed shady methods for ID proponents to gain public acceptance of their view.  Rather than deal with these issues, which have been dealt with somewhat elsewhere (e.g. see the Discovery Institute's articles on the ""wedge document"" at [...] it is more pertinent to discuss the particulars claimed by Mr. Lambdin regarding The Privileged Planet video.

The Earth is located in the circumstellar habitable zone around the sun; this is a ""Goldilocks Zone"" that allows for liquid water, a vital component for life.  This is the first item Lambdin takes issue with:

""(The film ignores the transitional twilight zone between the dark side and light side in which life might exist.)""

This is likely ignored because it is complex, technological life - life that would be able to make the kinds of scientific discoveries we make about the universe around us - that The Privileged Planet deals with. The possibility of life in the ""twilight"" zone is less likely to be of an complex, technological life due to the change in weather that is likely to result from being in such a place; basically, it is likely that simply dealing with the weather would engage whatever life could exist in that arena full time. We have the luxury of having ""down time"" from dealing with the elements, which is sometimes credited for scientific progress or even the birth of science itself as we know it.  More to the point, with respect to this particular item, The Privileged Planet is interested in degrees of habitability, not just mere habitability.  In fact, in the video, it is even specifically mentioned that to argue for design based exclusively on habitability is not appropriate (this will be discussed at more length later in this response).

Next, Lambdin discusses the carbon cycle portrayed in the video, and its necessity for oxygen based life, noting that the video ignores mentioning non-oxygen based microbes found deep in the ocean:

""(Never mind the microbes found at thermal vents in the ocean or at significant depths in mines - which do not require oxygen.)""

It is likely that the ocean thermal vent microbes generally rely on the ecosystems ""above"" them in order for their survival and the majority (if not all) of those systems do require oxygen; in other words, they're likely not a very ""independent"" life form. Additionally, there are some microbes that do require oxygen. And for those that live in rocks below the ground, there's mounting evidence that these organisms feed on organic matter that has filtered down from life above (e.g. fossil fuels). However, more to the main point - neither of these types of life do much to qualify for complex, technological life - that is, life that is capable of scientific discoveries. Extremophiles (i.e organisms that live in these kinds of extreme environments), are even specifically discussed on page 37 of The Privileged Planet book, in a section entitled ""Extreme Evironments.""  The book specifically discusses these in further detail and provides mainstream references as well. However, more to the main point - neither of these types of life do much to qualify for advanced technological life - that is, life that is capable of scientific discoveries.  Again, it is not simply mere life that The Privileged Planet is interested in - it is the correlation between degrees of habitability and the ability to make scientific discoveries.

To his credit, while reviewing a few of the many factors required for life, Mr. Lambdin does at one point seem to acknowledge that these are perhaps a ""specific type of life:""

""(Again, it could be argued that these are merely the factors that allow for a very specific type of life and are not even necessary for a number of earth creatures).""

To this we would say: exactly! That's correct!  Recall that it is life that would be capable of making scientific discoveries if the conditions are right for them to be made. It's not about any life, but that specific kind of advanced technological life that is the main type of life of interest in the hypothesis put forth in The Privileged Planet.

Anytime one discusses the possibility of intelligent life elsewhere in the Universe, the Drake equation almost inevitably arises.  This equation was first put forth in 1961 by Frank Drake in an attempt to ascertain the variables contributing to the likelihood of intelligent, communicating life existing elsewhere in our galaxy, such that interested parties would basically look in the right areas.  Some of those factors are discussed in the video and assigned probabilities.  Mr. Lambdin subsequently takes on the task of doing some probability calculations based on the probabilities noted (specifically, 1/10 for each of the factors) in the video.  (We would like to point out that we welcome and would like to encourage such kinds of calculations for many of the claims made in ID - as well as in neo-Darwinian evolutionary theory; these are some of the crucial calculations required to determine the validity for some of the claims made for each of these theories.  In other words, both proponents and opponents of ID and neo-Darwinism should be willing to get into the numbers, as Mr. Lambdin does, to help establish legitimacy of claims made.  Dr. William Dembski has provided seminal books and papers on such calculations for ID, which will be discussed in further detail later.)

First, Mr. Lambdin discusses the lack of an appropriate discussion of the probabilities proposed and the resources available in the Universe:

""In The Privileged Planet it is stated that if we assume that the odds of each of these factors occurring are the same, and if we fix these odds at one out of ten, then the odds of all of these conditions coming together in one location are 1/1,000,000,000,000,000. These odds are so remote, the authors conclude, that it is unlikely that a planet would be habitable due to chance alone, and so the best inference is design. These odds might be remote, to be sure, but there are probably a lot of planets! This simple point is glossed over in the film. Interestingly, the film gives an estimate of more than 10,000 billion billion star systems in the universe, and 10 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy. Oddly, no one in The Privileged Planet bothers to put such estimates together with the film's 1/1,000,000,000,000,000 odds of habitability.""

Actually, it is mentioned specifically in the video that the odds provided are actually larger than what is likely the case. Additionally, they do specifically note that there is a vast probabilistic resource within the universe - however, paying attention to the probabilities is crucial. In fact, in the book, a revised Drake equation (see Appendix A, on p. 337) is proposed to include additional factors that are now considered to contribute to the likelihood of civilized life existing in the universe. In the book, some of the particular factors are specifically discussed and shown that the actual probability is much smaller than 10% (p. 340-341). Since there is still much being learned in this area of cosmology, it is likely that many of the factors will be substantially less than 10%, and additional factors may need to be added. This is evident based on the revised Drake equation proposed in the book along with some of the specific factors shown to be substantially less (orders of magnitude less in fact) than 10%.

But, more to a key point made by Mr. Lambdin is that mere low probability for life is sufficient for a design inference.  This is incorrect.  As discussed previously, it is specifically mentioned in the film that this is not their justification for design; it is the correlation, the pattern, between habitable locations with locations well suited for making discoveries.  Mr. Lambdin misses this central point in the video.

As Mr. Lambdin continues, he performs the actual probability calculations, based upon the noted conservative numbers in the video, to arrive at ""10 habitable planets due to chance alone.""  It is claimed by Mr. Lambdin that these numbers are far too conservative based upon the results of extra-solar planet searchers:

""Astronomers who search for extra-solar planets find that about one in ten star systems they search contain planets.""

A few key points that Mr. Lambdin does not mention are worth noting here.  The extrasolar planets found are generally unlike our Solar System planets:  their orbital location and eccentricities are markedly different.  Most of the extrasolar planet have orbits very close to their stars or have elliptical orbits (i.e. noncircular).  In the former condition, these planets would not be within the circumstellar habitable zone (i.e. many of the planets are too close rather than in the `Goldilocks Zone' allowing liquid water).  For the latter case, the extreme temperature variations, caused by being close and then far from the star during the planet's orbit, prevents relatively stable temperatures and weather.  Neither condition allows for complex technological life the luxury of ""down time"" to pursue studying their surrounding environment (assuming they could even live at all with these conditions).  (For those interested in learning more regarding these findings, refer to the section `Distant Wanderers' on p. 94 in the book.)  In other words, our Solar System is rather unusual based upon the extrasolar planets found thus far.  Yet, Mr. Lambdin pushes his reasoning with the following:

""Using Gonzalez and Richard's own odds of habitability, this suggests that there may be one billion habitable planets due to chance alone. And even this may be a conservative estimate!""

That last statement has to be reconciled with the flawed reasoning previously exposed. It does not make sense to think that it could be conservative, or else planet finding would not be as involved as it obviously is.

As Mr. Lambdin apparently thinks he is on a key counter argument here, he provides an additional reference to suggest that there may be as many as 48 million habitable planets in our galaxy alone ([...]) and follows with:

""If this figure is in any way representative of other galaxies, then the number of habitable planets in the universe would be staggering.""

There's an important point to be made, which Mr. Lambdin even mentions, but seems to neglect in his final grandiose claim: they are only using a part of the Drake equation. In other words, they're not including all of the factors necessary to arrive at a habitable planet. In fact, this is even specifically noted in the cited article:

""Nevertheless, there are a number of other important factors, which may significantly change Nhab. Some of those are:
* the presence of a large moon,
* the presence of a giant planet to shield the habitable planet from comets and to scatter asteroids,
* the abundance of long-lived radioisotopes,
* extinction from gamma-ray bursts and so-called superflares."" (p. 24, last page of the 3 page article)

Apparently, Mr. Lambdin is unaware of the fact that in order to arrive at realistic or reasonable numbers for claims regarding habitable environment, one must account for as many factors as are known. Otherwise, we're left with numbers that leave the incorrect impression regarding chances of prospective habitable planets.

Mr. Lambdin moves into a critique of the latter part of the video, which deals more specifically with the main idea of The Privileged Planet: habitability correlates with measurability.  He suggests some of the statements made are irrelevant to the topic of design:

""The other arguments in The Privileged Planet amount to pointing to coincidences and citing them as evidence of a divine plan, which is, of course, a non sequitur.""

It may be a non-sequitar as it specifically relates to inferring design of the cosmos. However, it is relevant when considering the philosophical implications of The Privileged Planet, which are in contrast to the ""pale blue dot"" idea (which is how the video opened).  That is, implications of design differ from the Principle of Mediocrity (i.e. our place is not special and any musings of importance are simple human fantasies).  In this context, such philosophical wonderings are appropriate.

As the main thesis for The Privileged Planet is mentioned numerous times in the video (i.e. habitability correlates with measurability), Mr. Lambdin seems to miss it and instead suggests it is begging the question:

""It does not make sense to talk about science and discovery as though they could occur independently of life, which is done in the film by suggesting that the correlation ""between life and discovery"" could be anything less than perfect. If there is no life, no conscious beings, then who or what is doing the discovering? How can ""discovery"" exist without discoverers?""

This reviewer is getting stuck on semantics here and totally missing the point. The main idea for the argument is that the conditions that allow for life are also, for the most part, the same conditions that allow for discoveries; it's the correlation of these conditions that allows for an inference to design. So the key concept here is ""conditions"" allowing these things - not the things in and of themselves. The author's argument here apparently totally misses this key concept which is specifically discussed in the video as well as the book.

Lambdin continues along the previously mentioned `interesting coincidences, so it must be design' reasoning by relating the curious similarities between President Lincoln's and President Kennedy's assassinations.  He claims that it is merely coincidences, coupled with personal incredulity, that are the basis for the design claims made in The Privileged Planet.

""As I am unable to imagine otherwise, these coincidences are too great to have occurred due to chance alone, so there must be some Intelligent Assassin behind it. Thus runs the reasoning throughout The Privileged Planet.""

The reviewer is completely missing the main argument in The Privileged Planet with this characterization, as discussed previously. First, it is not a matter of being ""unable to imagine"" other habitable planets along with the necessary conditions for making discoveries that Gonzalez and Richards make the design claim; it is specifically because of what is objectively known to be required for conditions for both habitability and measurability that the design assertion is even conceivable.  In The Privileged Planet (in both the video and the book), they explicitly make the reference that probabilities alone are not sufficient to arrive at a design inference. In fact, they even go so far as to say that rarity of life in and of itself is insufficient to make a case for design.  Again, as mentioned already, it is the apparent relationship between conditions required for life coupled with conditions required for scientific discovery that support the design argument; we should not expect that these conditions should be compatible in the way we find them from chance or logical necessity. Comparisons are even made between other environments to drive the point home that it is degrees of habitability and measurability that are of specific interest in The Privileged Planet.  This is the main argument of The Privileged Planet. It is unfortunate that Mr. Lambdin completely misses the fundamentals of the argument and, instead, constructs a strawman for his critique.

Discussions of the ability to do science as it relates to neo-Darwinism are discussed in the video, and commented on by Mr. Lambdin.  He is perplexed by some statements along these lines:

""Such statements as, ""We evolved to hunt and gather food, not to do astronomy,"" display a complete lack of understanding of evolution. It doesn't really make sense to say that we evolved to do anything.""

I find myself laughing at this one since again the author is focusing solely on the words (i.e. semantics) and not the intended meaning. The point of the statement quoted is to get the idea across that astronomy provides no immediate benefit to daily survival, yet hunting and gathering food does. In other words, if you could hunt and gather food better than another, you're more likely to live. But, what benefit does being able to do astronomy provide as seen in the typical ""survival of the fittest"" concept of early humans?  This is the curious part about our Universe and the situation we find ourselves in on Earth: the Universe around us is intelligible, but there is no reason we should expect such to be the case from logical necessity.

Mr. Lambdin continues his dismissive discussion of these curious facts by suggesting that because improbable events do occur, we should not be surprised by the ones discussed in The Privileged Planet.

""Statistically unlikely events are, in the long run, likely to occur: There are 280 million people in America, therefore one-in-a-million odds will happen 280 times a day in America. It does not make sense to say that 280 miracles happen a day in the United States, any more than it should seem miraculous that someone will win a lottery.""

Richard Swinburne provides an analogy for this flawed reasoning. Consider that you've been sentenced to death by a firing squad, consisting of sharpshooters. Upon your forlorn execution day, the dreaded words of ""READY! AIM! FIRE!"" are heard - yet you live! But, you shouldn't be surprised to find that you are not dead, because if you were, then you wouldn't be around to observe it. Therefore, you shouldn't be surprised to find yourself alive. But this assumes the very thing one is trying to prove: that by chance alone you are alive. Does this make sense? Is it rational to claim that you survived due to an incredibly (hugely) beneficial bit of luck? Or is an alternative explanation more likely, such as the sharpshooters intended to miss, or filled their guns with blanks, etc. In other words, your living was intended or designed.

Lambdin continues his ridicule of The Privileged Planet while mischaracterizing the key arguments of it and ID in general.

""Ignoring such facts, The Privileged Planet repeatedly beats into the viewer that the coincidences in nature require an Intelligent Designer. Intelligent Design theory begs the question by not having set an objective criterion for what is ""too rare"" or ""too unlikely"" or ""too complex."" ""

Mr. Lambdin must be completely unaware of the work by Dembski, the upper probability bound of 1/10^150 & 500 bits. As is documented in No Free Lunch (NFL) ([...]), design theorist William Dembski (Ph. D. in Mathematics) specifically discusses the objectively identifiable probability limit in order for something to qualify as complex specified information (CSI) (see [...] for an article on ID jargon); it basically is 1/(10^150), which corresponds to 500 bits in terms of information (see Sec. 1.5, 2.8, and especially p. 156 in Sec. 3.8). Additionally, in NFL as well as The Design Inference ([...]) (TDI), he goes through specific example probabilistic calculations in applying his methodology for CSI determination. This includes human phenomena (election control, TDI pg. 9-20, intellectual property protection, TDI pg. 20-22; forensic science, TDI pg. 22-24; data falsification in science, TDI pg. 24-26; cryptography, pg. 26...) and non-human phenomena (SETI, TDI pg. 26-32; general randomness, pg 32-35; simple lifeforms, TDI pg. 55-62; the bacterial flagellum, NFL pg 289-302, 292 & 293 specifically). In any case, whether or not Dembski can successfully apply his ideas is a matter of debate-Dembski has dealt with many problems regarding false positives, false negatives, and clearly defined his terms (see, for example, The Design Revolution, where Dembski addresses a large number of such objections). Dembski's ideas can be applied in science-we can calculate the level of CSI in a biological structure, just as Dembski does for the flagellum in ch. 5 of No Free Lunch.  (For those interested in further refinement of Dembski's treatment of CSI, dated 8/15/05, see [...])

But, the main point of The Privileged Planet is not that our situation is ""too rare"" or ""too unlikely"" or ""too complex."" In fact, this is specifically mentioned to be a poor argument for design in the video and the book (the book actually has a section at the end dealing specifically with objections, similar to this).  As stated previously, it is that design is a reasonable inference based on the correlation between the conditions required for life and conditions required for scientific discovery. Because Mr. Lambdin never accurately portrays the principal argument in The Privileged Planet, his criticisms do little to cast doubt on the novel ideas proposed.

With the frequent mischaracterizations by critics of Intelligent Design, confusion abounds in the minds of the general public. Perhaps this is the goal of critics who are unable to provide rational criticisms of an idea they simply don't like. To admit that there may be something to ID would be to admit they might be wrong. Luckily for science, personal pride usually does not win the day. Let's hope for the benefit of the scientific enterprise, the evidence is allowed to speak for itself, and the chips fall as they may.",1139097600,31,22195,5.0917608156516945
2081276,5,B0002E34C0,"The more we learn about single-cell creatures (as demonstrated in the DVD, ""Unlocking the Mystery of Life,""), the more obvious it seems that our universe is intentionally designed. The same is true when go into the opposite direction. Though the universe is vast beyond imagination, ""The Privileged Planet"" argues that the earth in unique indeed. The many conditions necessary for life converge on the earth, something unlikely to occur anywhere else. In addition, the earth is situated in one of the best observation points (i.e., for a planet with an atmosphere) in the universe.
The movie is well produced with excellent effects. Some of the authorities quoted are evangelical Christian scientists, while other scientists are non-committal (thus bolstering the argument). But the evidence is in: earth is very likely the only planet in the universe capable of sustaining advanced life while at the same time offering an ideal glimpse at the stars. Fascinating.
Although no evidence can persuade a person against his or her will, this DVD should make open-minded skeptics consider the many ""coincidences"" that must ultimately be beyond coincidence. Great for the thinking person, but easily understood by the masses.",1138665600,36,1218,5.348958333333333

Why is water the key to life? How do we know that scientifically, the universe can only support carbon-based life forms? Is is accident that the earth has all of the conditions necessary for complex life-forms, and has the best conditions for scientific discovery?

Check out the extras, question and Answers.  Note 5 & 6.  Jastrow steps on his own arguments, and admits his conclusions:

Summary of his quotes:  ""Everything scientifically points to creation because there is a definite begining to the universe.  I CANNOT believe in this as creation because I am Agnostic!""  ????What Jastrow?

The pictures from space of the earth are awe inspiring on their own.  All the DVD extras are exellent.

This DVD presents the ideas of scientists, agnostics, physicists, philosphers, and a mix of everything in-between in an attempt to answer whether or not Intelligent Life is here by merely the number of possibilities or if the physics of the universe suggests that carbon based life can exist anywhere else at this time.

2081278,3,B0002E34C0,"The Privileged Planet is an extremely well-made DVD.  The basic science facts included are mostly accurate and up-to-date.  The narration by John Rhys-Davies is easy to understand.  I can summarize the content by saying that The Privileged Planet is an odd mix of Intelligent Design and Don Brownlee and Peter Ward's Rare Earth Hypothesis with a touch of the hard version of the Anthropic Principle.  The earliest portion of the DVD is a nice introduction to the Copernican Principle or the Principle of Mediocrity - a working principle in science that says that our circumstances here on Earth are most likely not unique or particularly special.  Somehow the authors of the DVD take this cautionary principle in science, a subject that deals with the secondary causes of the philosophers of old, and equate this with a statement that says that the Earth has no purpose, a subject usually associated with philosophy, religion and the primary causes of those old sages.  The last half of the video goes on to try and demonstrate the uniqueness of the Earth and then equate this with a need for a creator.  The DVD mixes testable scientific ideas with untestable religious views.  Even if the hard version of the Anthropic Principle and the Rare Earth Hypothesis are correct, those ideas do not require a creator.  If the Earth and the universe were unfavorable to us, we wouldn't be here to have this discussion - no creator needed for that to happen.  Most of the students I studied geology with were religious - Jewish, Presbyterian, Catholic, Mormon, etc. - and these people had no problem with the ideas of mainstream science.  We often discussed primary causes and each of those people had their own take on where those primary causes intersected with science, but they kept their personal religious views out of the science lab and lecture hall.  Science doesn't discuss ideas about primary causes like the existence of a creator because they are untestable by the methods of science.  Science is neutral on the existence of a creator.  Ultimately, The Privileged Planet is bad science and bad theology.",1133049600,24,2108,4.934844192634561
2081279,5,B0002E34C0,"Why is it so hard to believe, I don't find it hard.  It has always been obvious to me as an engineer.  The trouble with the Priviledged Planet is it makes it clear to non-scientific minds.  Herein lies the trouble for the folks that refuse to concede that we humans are special.  The production is done sans the nerdy arrogance of present day science.  It is done humbly and with awe of our place in the universe.  If you feel anything other than good after seeing this DVD, you need to see the doctor, or maybe, just maybe, go to church.",1131062400,21,538,4.2772277227722775
2081280,5,B0002E34C0,"I'm absolutely baffled at how many reviewers bring up the subject of ""evolution"" in their reviews of this DVD.  Be they for it, or against it, they seem to base their opinion on it based on how they feel about ""evolution"".  However, this DVD actually does not really take on that topic at all!  What it does cover is something along the lines of Peter Ward's ""Rare Earth"".  The uniqueness of earth in its ability to foster life.

Yes, it does have more of an Intelligent Design slant, which isn't suprising considering who made it, but there is nothing actually against the theory of evolution in this video at all.  If you decided to love or hate this DVD, don't base your opinion of it on your opinion of Darwinism (be it for or against).  That's really not the substance of the video, and anyone who thinks it is is completely missing out on the focus of the video.

This video is really well done, and features narration by John Rhyes Davies.  If you're interested more in this subject, I'd definitely recommend the book ""Rare Earth"", or the DVD ""If We Had No Moon"" (narrated by Patrick Stewart).",1128038400,245,1100,4.515151515151516
2081281,5,B0002E34C0,"Sorry, Mr. Bafflegabber...but your little dog example is quite a ""delicious"" argumentative fallacy!  The proofs contained in this work are more properly compared to evidence in forensic science.  In order to determine foulplay when a body is found, CSI folks look for signs of intelligent design, intent and method of said foulplay.  They do not need to witness the culprit commiting the crime!!!!!  The article you cited was also taken out of context.  In order for a theory to be deemed scientific by the community of scientists over time and region, there must exist a statistical significance in probability.  We look at Mt. Rushmore and believe it was manmade, but that does not mean we can rule out chance absolutely!  It just means that it is statistically impossible to be chance.  Not only that, but there exists a specificity included (images of historically proven Presidents) that helps us to rule out chance, though it's not...impossible!

2081282,5,B0002E34C0,"A thoughtful gaze cast beyond our atmosphere begs questions as to the how and why of time, exsistence, and purpose; questions which no sane person can, or should, ignore. In acknowleging the metaphysical dimension inherent to physics and cosmology, Gonzales and Richards join company with Kepler, Einstien, Hawking, Davies, and common folk like you and me. The

Privledged Planet film is a an excellent introduction to the more detailed book of the same name. It's a provocative guide through current evidences in physics and cosmology, which challenge the Copernican Principle and its cousin, the Principle of Mediocrity. Stimulating analysis such as this is what energizes science to move forward in the pursuit of truth, in this case looking not just at what the cosmos is, but to what it says.

If the tone of vulgar, sophmoric derision found in some of the negative reviews sounds eerily familiar, one should hardly be surprised. Defenders of orthodoxy never welcome dissent, or open inquiry for that matter, and visceral reactions are predicatable when such people sense a heretic in their church.  The Privleged Planet has committed no sin against the empirical enterprise known as science; it merely refuses to genuflect before the doctrine of philosophical materialism.  Gonzalez and Richards

have laid out a persuasive, testable argument and set a good example. Science, understanding, and the pursuit of truth will be better for it.

2081283,2,B0002E34C0,"I am very open to the idea of intelligent design yet I thought this documentary did a less than brillant job making their point. Their evidence was scarce and I found most of the ideas and concepts irrelevant to the whole issue of purpose and meaning. I believe there is a much stronger argument for intellgient design and I was very dissapointed that this documentary didn't hit on key elements. The documentary basically tried to promote the correlation between the ability of a planet to host life to that planet being an optimal place for scientific discovery. Yet this is a poor arugment because there are no other planets (in our knowledge) that have life and thus we only have earth as a test subject.  We don't know the discoveries we would be making had we lived on another planet and we don't know that if another planet did have life, that it would be an optimal place to make scientific discoveries. There just simply aren't enough test conditions to make that assumption.  A large part of the film was dedicated to discussing the wonder of solar eclipses and how the distance and size of the moon was perfect for producing it. It was tangential and made no point because one has to remember that you can not seperate an object from its inherent qualities. Thus, the ONLY way solar eclispes can exist is with those exact properites of the moon. That is the basic definition of solar eclispse. You can not argue that had the condtions not been right, a solar eclipse woudl not have been possible. Of course not! A solar eclipse is by nature defined by a certain formula and only happens when those conditions are met. Overall I was dissapointed with this film and expected more. I am sorry that of all the documentaries that promote intellgient design, this film is being nationally shown and in fact, premiering at the Smithsonian.",1119484800,17,1843,4.667692307692308
2081284,2,B0002E34C0,"This documentary is produced by the fundamentalist christian movement whose agenda it is to get Darwin's theory of evolution banned from schools and have it replaced by ""Intelligent Design"", which really just means creation, as put forth in the bible. As can be expected from a documentary with an agenda to convince the viewer of a certain point, rather than being open minded, it does not really go anywhere. It keeps repeating the point that ""scientists agree"" that life could not have developed anywhere else in the universe.

The other reviewers here must be people associated with ""the cause,"" this really is not a five star production simply because instead of sincerely investigating the subject with an open mind you get science, contorted to fit religion.",1119225600,14,765,5.071428571428571
