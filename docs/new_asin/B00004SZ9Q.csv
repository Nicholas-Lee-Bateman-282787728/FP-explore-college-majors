8492378,5,B00004SZ9Q,"Villa is a gritty portrayal of an American Hero. Mexico is America too and America first. Villa is shown to be a man of incredible contradictions incredibly flawed, yet gifted as a General and eventually a Statesman.  Director Phillip Rodriguez paints a powerfully stark and arcane picture of  Villa, skeched from the memories of people who knew, and a few that  actually loved him. This is the type of American History that should be  taught in school, a must for any High School or college History class, for  teachers who don't want to sugar coat the real.",959040000,5,559,4.721649484536083
8492379,5,B00004SZ9Q,Phil Rodriguez has done an excellent job in producing and directing this video. Pancho Villa was such a brazen individual and leader that it is very hard to distinguish the myth and reality. The video testimonials are  interesting in reflecting contemporary Mexican politics and sentiments  through the eyeglass of history. I would recommend this video to anyone  interested in learning more about this period and time.,957484800,4,419,5.318181818181818
