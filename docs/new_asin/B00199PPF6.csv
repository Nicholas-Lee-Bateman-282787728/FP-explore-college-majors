3430178,5,B00199PPF6,"When I tried to rent 305 at Blockbuster, it was sold out. I had to drive across town to a different store to rent a copy. I think the gas cost me more than the rental.

We watched it tonight with our family and loved it. It's original and authentic. The Office meets 305 approach is so funny and engaging that I bought a copy from Amazon.

I want more Darryl and Claudius, more deadly carrots and rolling pins, more he-she oracles and battles with giants.

Will there be a 305.5? I think they left it open for that possibility. I'll be waiting.",1216252800,4,544,4.262135922330097

3430211,5,B00199PPF6,"I was so pleasantly surprised! I went in expecting some stupid, raunchy, Scary Movie-esque film, but found a delightful, silly, ALMOST family-friendly comedy. I loved the continuous non-sequiturs and the ""out of left field"" one-liners. I'd love to meet these guys and make a movie with them!",1508112000,,291,5.212765957446808

3430214,4,B00199PPF6,"Not terrible...I didn't expect to watch more than 5 minutes or so, much less the whole movie.

Of course, it's not a great movie, but I did find it to be light-hearted, entertaining, and humorous...not LOL funny, but humorous.

Not a bad way to kill a Sunday afternoon.  I mean, I'm away from home, holed-up in a hotel room in Scottsboro, AL and it's been raining all day.  Given the circumstances, what the hell else am I going to do?  This movie was an okay way to kill the time.  On the other hand, if I had been at home I probably would have done something different with my time.

My biggest complaint is that they mixed the background music a little hot.  There are some points in the movie where the dialogue is hard to understand because the background music is too loud.  A little more audio mixing would have made this a better experience.",1507420800,,849,4.391025641025641

3430230,4,B00199PPF6,"Once I got over the cheap looking FX, I found to my delight that the movie was cleverly scripted and actually had a story line.
Give this a fair go, you may be pleasantly surprised as I was.",1422057600,,190,4.026315789473684
3430231,2,B00199PPF6,"I actually ordered this based on reading some of the reviews which were posted on the site. Granted, it is silly and at times funny. But overall I found it to be boring and repetitive. I suppose we all have different tastes, when it comes to watching comedies. I personally found the comedy version of 300, much funnier and more entertaining than this particular movie.",1402358400,,369,4.6923076923076925
3430232,1,B00199PPF6,"I saw the movie ""300"" that this lame parody is supposedly modeled on. Too bad they didn't see it. None of the key scenes are replicated in the obviously lo-tech movie. No people get pushed into holes, no inspiring speeches, etc. Instead, they decided to present this as a documentary (wtf?), so that much of the time the characters are talking to us as if being interviewed. Dumb idea. The actual jokes must be there, but I'm not going to waste another 83:49 looking for them. Stupid, stupid, stupid. The original short is included as an extra, and that's not much to brag about either. Yea, the original movie was ripe for satire, but THIS dreck is not the movie to do it. Instead, like most of Saturday Night Live, they take one potential joke, and instead of hitting and stopping right there, they instead extend and extend and extend, never knowing when to just quit. Wanting to say something nice about the movie, the Aurillia character, played by Heaven Peabody (I assume that's her real name) is fairly cute. Her flashing eyes are nowhere near enough to save this movie.",1355270400,,1077,4.643979057591623
3430233,2,B00199PPF6,"The only thing I can think of is that the director was trying for a Mel Brooks feel. What he got instead was an incredibly unfunny satire. This one really looks weak when compared to Go Tell the Spartans, which was in itself not a first-rate movie. Perhaps with better writing and a more measured approach it could have been a better film.",1254268800,,339,4.396825396825397
3430234,2,B00199PPF6,"Everyone should view the youtube short under the same name, along with the two trailers for this movie. They are all very clever and funny. But, you should stop there. This feature does not live up to the high standards set by the shorts. The acting is subpar/overacted and the humor just isn't there. Not to mention that the soundtrack just gets annoying. The witty humor of the internet clips remains only during the scenes taken from the online videos, but everywhere else is dry. It was very hard to stay awake throughout the whole thing (whereas I still watch the youtube short). The special features are interesting, but the overall plot and movie itself was very disappointing. It was filmed very well, and i could deal with the cheesy special effects because it didn't take away from the humor of the internet clip. In summary, 305 was very disappointing.",1243814400,3,863,4.76
3430235,5,B00199PPF6,"awesome!!!!! daniel n dave holecheck once again did it!! i remember when we used to hang out at the broadcasting building back in school and u showed me ur first movie ""Arizona"" when it was still in post-production....this movie is different from ""Arizona""...this one totally rocked my stomach so hard....funny as hell!!!!! keep up the good work friend. hope one of these days, we actually work together on a movie with bigger budget where i can actually stop directing TV commercials.",1243468800,,485,5.0
3430236,3,B00199PPF6,"This is a stupid/funny spoof of 300 and The Office. Although I've never watched the office, I think I get most of the jokes, because Claudius is holding that cup every single time we see him. Claudius is kidnapped, and the 4 other Spartans must save him. The visuals and backgrounds look pretty fake, but if you have a great sense of humor, you'll probably like 305!!!!",1221264000,,369,4.522388059701493
3430237,1,B00199PPF6,"Pornos have better actors. Gandhi was funnier. Peanuts is more interesting. 10,000 is more historically accurate. Music videos for local bands have better production value.

There's nothing done well in this movie, in fact to call it a movie is to debase the medium. The acting is horrible, far worse than any local theater production I have ever seen other than elementary school performances. The writing is horrible, filled with tired cliches, melodrama, and nonsense. The filming is horrible, all done in front of a blue screen that doesn't seem calibrated correctly.

It's not worth watching at all.",1219622400,7,604,5.153061224489796
3430238,5,B00199PPF6,"This is obviously not a big budget studio production; but that being said, these guys produced one hell of a great movie!  It's not the most brilliant piece of art ever created, but who cares because it's damned FUNNY!!  Very fluid storytelling with a great no-name (at least for now) cast and tons of laughs in every scene.  If you have laughed (or even chuckled) just once while watching The Office then I highly recommend this movie to you!",1216425600,4,443,4.582278481012659

8273023,4,B00199PPF6,"305 could have been a Mel Brooks film.  In fact, if Mel had ever seen this, he'd have enjoyed the hell outta it.

Low budget, dumb story line and funny, funny, fun-ny!",1517097600,,167,4.1875
8273024,3,B00199PPF6,"305 tells the story of the 5 misfit Spartans who didn't make the cut due to them being too fat, blind, or just idiots. When they get a little overzealous and run off to fight some Persians, leaving the goat road they were tasked to watch unattended, the Persians make short work of the 300 and the 5 misfits are on the run. This spoof of both ""300"" as well as ""the Office"" was funny enough, for the most part, and I enjoyed it immensely more than the completely cinematic excrement that was ""Meet the Spartans"" despite the extremely low-budget of this film. Hey here's an idea, give the makers of THIS film $30,000,000 and let the extremely untalented duo of Friedberg and Seltzer have to scrounge up pocket change for Their so-called 'films'",1516752000,,742,4.544776119402985

8273029,2,B00199PPF6,"Really wouldn't recommend it. I would venture a guess at a $500 budget, five outfits, and one green screen. Maybe a flashlight or two.
Not knocking the guys for making it, just saying it really wasn't worth a watch in my opinion. Made it two minutes in then skipped around to see if it would get better...it didn't.",1512000000,,315,4.448275862068965
