8488143,4,B005WWGSCK,"June 8, 1968, the day that many stopped to pay respect to Robert Kennedy as his body was carried by train to Arlington Cemetery from New York.

This documentary is a tribute to a trip of a few hours that ended up taking all day.

Paul Fusco, a photographer, ended up taking one thousand pictures from his window on the train, of the many people from all walks of life, who paid their respect for the latest member of the Kennedy family to be assassinated.

This dvd shares some of these people's memories of the sad day, in interviews with them, from archival footage and actual words from Robert and Edward Kennedy. All this brings forth a moving sense of hope that Robert Kennedy inspired.

Robert once said, ""What we need in the United States is not derision. What we need in the United States is not hatred. What we need in the United States is not violence and lawlessness, but is love, and wisdom, and compassion towards one another and a feeling of justice towards those who still suffer within our country, whether they be white or black."" This statement cemented him in people's mind as he hated the way America was at the time.

At the time, I remember watching the news on television when they showed Robert's funeral train and all the people along the train tract. I can still remember thinking that no one in America's history that has effected the country the way John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy did, and at the time of Robert's death many people must have felt despire and a loss of hope.

The sight of so many people showing their respect for one man who tried to make a difference, effected me emotionally, even though I could not imagine the loss the people felt for him. Their differences were put aside for one moment was overwhelming. I always think what Robert would have thought if he could have seen the thousands of people showing their reverence for him.

This documentary is a moving account of the people's final tribute and deserves more than four stars, but I was disappointed by the fact it was too short, and I was hoping to see more of the pictures than I did. There should have been more interviews with the people also.",1372896000,6,2177,4.524173027989822
