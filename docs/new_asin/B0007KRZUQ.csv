2216493,5,B0007KRZUQ,"I own this DVD it is a Japanese import special edition it has Both DTS 5.1 and Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround sound, fantastic picture. It also includes a gallery with wonderful animated menus. I think that this was only released in Japan on DVD if you have bought other japanese imports then you know that they are usually high quality. So if you can get your hands on this gem do so. It is in NTSC format and will play on most american and other region 1 DVD players. I highly recommend this one.",1123632000,5,494,4.26595744680851

2216495,5,B0007KRZUQ,"There is only one concert in the world better than this one by Olivia Newton-John-that is Diana Ross' 1979 concert from Ceasar's Palace. I have been looking for both for decades. I did not care what format the concerts were on--DVD,VHS, BETA, A TABLE CLOTH, A LONG ROLL OF TISSUE PAPER OR A NOVA BEHIND ORION.  Olivia outperformed herself and surpassed all expectations. Her beautiful, pure voice has always been overloooked and under rated.  She has always been one of my favorite perfomers. After watching this concert, new generations can truly appreciate a true star. The only way you will not like this concert is if you are trying to get a disablity check from the government.  Great performances, no songs to fast forward, and a beautiful class act with a beautiful voice. Her performance was nominated for a grammy that year. It shall remain one of life's mysteries why she didn't win. There are others who have sold more records, filled more stadiums, covered more magazines, but few who deserves the praises as much as Olivia. This concert is only one reason.",1106265600,17,1069,4.830601092896175
2216526,5,B0007KRZUQ,"The voice of an angel, Olivia Newton John delivers here with an excellent concert I haven't seen since the 1980's. An excellent buy for people who appreciate a God given talented voice that is Olivia.",1425859200,,200,4.742857142857143

2216528,4,B0007KRZUQ,"I originally saw this on laser disc (which I can no longer watch because the player gave up the ghost !). I was a bit concerned with some of the reviews, but had really wanted to be able to watch it again so I bought the DVD. The video quality may not be the best, but that may be a consequence of the age of the original production. That said, it's certainly adequate. The thing that really impressed me was the surround sound. It was really a great sound and made the whole purchase worth it (IMHO). Like some other reviewers, I did miss the lead in that was in the original production, but I wouldn't consider that a reason not to purchase this DVD.",1420243200,3,652,4.224

2216556,5,B0007KRZUQ,"Not the best quality, but given this is all we have of this former HBO special, I'll take it. After just getting to visit with Olivia recently, it reminded me how fabulous she was in the '80's and how she still can bring the house down. As is evidenced by her sold out Las Vegas shows! I'm so happy to have this DVD as part of my collection. The opening sequence of the original concert is under the special features section on the menu.

2216563,5,B0007KRZUQ,"Brought back so many memories. What a great video, especially for the time. I thought the sound and video was great!",1355184000,,116,4.571428571428571
2216564,5,B0007KRZUQ,"DVD arrived quickly and in fine shape. There are less expensive listings, but I prefer dealing with USA based sellers. The DVD is Korean and viewing requires the correct sound setting each time. Instructions are included but judging from one review, not everyone gets them. This was 1982 - 18 songs taped in analog, with no high definition or widescreen. I'd like HD too, but there wasn't any then, so tough cookies. It's good enough. Regarding content - those unfamiliar with ONJ (younger than 30+) will key on hair, clothes and other anachronisms. Shoulder pads!

  Now, this is an outstanding stage performance by a truly talented professional, working with other accomplished musicians and singers. Ogden, Utah was near the end of a 50 city tour, so they'd done maybe 60 or so shows by then. Practice makes perfect. Nobody misses a note! Well, maybe. There is editing, special effects are simple, and this could be parts of two shows rolled into one. Still, Olivia does some songs even better than the studio versions; she absolutely drills the vocals while channeling a succession of personae to great effect.

  Having only seen her back in 1980 lip-synching and bunny-hopping to ""Magic"" on ""The Midnight Special"", I never knew how good a singer and performer ONJ really was. Thanks, You-Tube, for leading me to this concert. She's also (at 34) unbelievably fetching. Well, looks count, that's why it's called ""show biz"". Aretha Franklin is a fabulous singer (her ""I Say a Little Prayer"" is unmatched), but I've not searched for a video of her skipping across a stage in a short skirt while belting ""Xanadu"".

  Olivia is brilliant; her vocal command, audience rapport, fluid movements - not just dancing, but precise, perfected movements and posture - all mesh with a killer band and Tom Scott's inspired arrangements. This sweet, slender girl without big bazooms or booty, not sporting a massive crucifix or a dress of meat, radiates conflicted desire, loneliness, regret, or innocence for 4 convincing minutes at a time, live! Watch and be transported by sheer performance artistry. Plus, she's skipping and spinning across the stage in a really short skirt... ""Xanadu-ooh-ooh..."".",1342656000,12,2190,5.061111111111111
2216565,5,B0007KRZUQ,I was excited to find this concert I went to during college. It plays well and has good sound. Even though it is an import you only need to reset the settings as described in the cd to watch and hear in english.,1328486400,2,211,3.9302325581395348
2216576,4,B0007KRZUQ,"First, I feel the need to remind people that this concert was shot on NTSC video (not film) using 1982 camera technology.  The video quality is obviously not perfect, but it's the best you can expect for its time.  I have the VHS version, and the DVD has noticeably better picture quality.  I also have the Video Gold collection, and the PQ is pretty much the same.  I don't get why people are complaining about color qualty as if the differences were like night and day.  They're not, and besides, color quality is really difficult to judge for such an old concert, especially with the stage light colors constantly changing.

The sound quality is excellent, particularly the newly-mixed DTS track.  The 5.1 and 2.0 Dolby tracks are also nice, although you'll need to turn up your volume to hear them at the same level as the DTS track.

It's true that English subtitles automatically appear during the program, but you can turn them off by simply pressing your ""Subtitle"" button a couple of times (you'll need to bypass the Korean subtitles as well).

My only true complaint is that the slideshow intro was cut out of the program and placed in the Special Features section.  This ruins the effect of her career build-up and anticipation of her walking out on-stage.  Ah well, maybe I'll splice them back together again if I decide to make an .mpg file for playback on my WD TV Live.

This DVD is no longer available directly through Amazon, but I got a brand new shrink-wrapped copy of it through eBay for $5 including shipping.  Overall, this DVD was a good deal for only $5.  Plus, that's one more VHS tape in my dwindling collection I can get rid of!",1307059200,2,1655,4.585034013605442
2216577,5,B0007KRZUQ,"If you can tolerate turning off the Korean subtitles every time you put in the disc, you will enjoy this concert.  This is Olivia at the peak of her carreer and the concert is an absolute joy to watch.  Note that the disc is in standard definition, shot in 1982 and will show its age on newer widescreen TVs.",1291420800,2,308,4.203389830508475
2216578,5,B0007KRZUQ,"Olivia is a excellent singer I love her and i had her olivia in concert before but i lost it so I am so glad I found the dvd version of her concert online here, it brings back a lot of memories of my childhood",1287446400,,209,3.6666666666666665
2216579,4,B0007KRZUQ,"As others have noted there are several sound settings. If you find the one that works best on your equipment the sound is quite good.

The video quality is at best fair. The color balance is off on the transfere and a pink dress becomes red... a lot of things end up red. But it is more than watchable if you enjoy seeing Olivia Newton-John's live performances.

If you have both disks of the ONJ Video Gold set then you already have 6 or 7 of these songs. And I mean not just the same songs but the same performances. If you have seen the Video Gold version you will not be able to watch those songs from this DVD because the color is just so much better on VG. But this DVD contains all 18 songs from the concert and on the ones you haven't seen the better transfere of you will enjoy to the max. At least I did... I do. I watch them every now and again. But for the duplicated songs I can only watch the VG version.

If you enjoy watching ONJ's energetic live performances from her prime this DVD is a must. But if you are only a casual fan you may find the video quality and especially the color balance very distracting. For the casual fan I would suggest you may do better with a audio CD or the Video Gold DVDs. I have all of the above and wouldn't have it any other way. :)

Oh... also as noted by others the version of ""You're The One I Want"" from this concert just doesn't work and I don't care if we are talking this DVD or VG. For that song watch the movie ""Grease"" or do without. But that still leaves 17 other great songs.",1263600000,,1536,4.0594059405940595
2216580,5,B0007KRZUQ,"MCA owns the master recording to this concert. Attention Olivia Newton John fans all over the world, IF you want to see this concert released properly and fully WRITE LETTER TO MCA Records. They most likely have the master tape just sitting in a vault here in Hollwood collecting dust. WRITE WRITE and get them to go into the vault and release this concert on DVD. You Owe it to Olivia to do it. MCA the time is NOW!",1252368000,3,416,4.2784810126582276
2216581,2,B0007KRZUQ,"Here's my review:  short and simple.  A DVD should have superb sound and video quality, this DVD has good sound and video quality.  The scrapbook montage is deleted from the intro, which was present on the VHS version.  For those of us who went to this tour, that's how the concert started.  When you hit play, it abruptly starts with Olivia bursting out of the curtains.  It was poorly done, and should have stayed as the original VHS version was.  One should not have to go to the special features section to see this.  Hopefully another video company will release this video the way it should have been, with true special features.  At the very least, a discography section.  This lazily made video almost gave me a heart attack!!",1251849600,,733,4.612403100775194
2216582,4,B0007KRZUQ,"As a huge Olivia fan, I was thrilled to find this available on DVD.  My VHS copy never survived.  As the disk menu started up, I heard great sound and saw great picture quality.  But when I hit play, no more sound.  I was freaking out.  Couldn't imagine why the sound worked so well for the menu and speacial feature, but not the actual convert.

Then, I changed the audio in te set-up page to DOLBY 5.1 instead of DTS sound, and like magic, it worked fine.  However, That's where the accustic sound is slightly dated and not as crisp as we might be use to. Oh, how I wish the DTS sound was working.

Picture is fine and acceptable, sound is ok.  overall, I'm still very happy to have this in my collection, it is a rare find and worth the price I paid.

For those who think the dvd left out the original opening, it's located in the special featues. It's the montage of photos with an overture of her music.

Compair THIS concert from 1982 to her new concert dvd, the Live from Sydney Australia, and it's great to see how she has changed, but never lost her style of high class.  She is one INCREDIBLE performer.",1245110400,9,1113,4.247619047619048
2216583,4,B0007KRZUQ,"I'm so glad to have found this DVD of Olivia live in concert.  If you like her early stuff then this DVD is for you.  Performing Magic, Jolene, Make a Move on Me, Xanadu and hits from Grease.  It skipped here and there, but still am completely satisifed with this purchase.  FYI - In the case that you think you have no sound like I thought when I first put it in, I had to go into features and make some audio changes.",1236643200,,419,4.0120481927710845
2216584,5,B0007KRZUQ,"Do not expect it to be as high of quality of video as seen on the latest recorded dvd's the tech was not there when this concert was originally taped,but is still great quality and the dts sound is execellent. If you are a fan of Olivia Newton-John this concert is a must for your collection as she is a fantastic live performer and she was at the top of her of her fame when this concert was done.",1225238400,,398,4.050632911392405
2216585,5,B0007KRZUQ,"I saw this concert on tv when I was in my teens and as a huge ONJ, I loved it.  As an adult, watching this DVD, I still love it.  I felt as though I was in my teens again.  The songs are great, Olivia looked and sounded fantastic.  The only thing that I was disappointed about then and now is that when she sings You're the One that I Want (from Grease), it is not with John Travolta.  The guy that she sings it with is just ok but I don't care for him too much.  Specifically, not for that song.  He's talented but he's not John.  This is a great DVD, however, the subtitles can get a bit annoying.  Fortunately, I have been able to look past them.",1214352000,2,649,3.9307692307692306
2216606,1,B0007KRZUQ,This DVD ended up being a BOOTLEG and had a horrible picture and NO sound!!! Beware of this seller - I got ripped off!,1209427200,,118,3.9583333333333335
2216607,5,B0007KRZUQ,"I was also at this concert 3 times when it came to Northern CA.  I think the video quality is very much like VHS quality (I have the laser and laser looks better), but the sound and the concert is incredible.  It captures the feel of the concert.  The opening titles are on the special features (which is really cool).  ONJ sings all of her songs fully and the backup singers are FANTASTIC (especially on ""Let me be There and If yo love me let me know).  ONJ has lots of energy.  It is a tour of her GREATEST HITS played at their best.  I definitely recommend this concert DVD even though the video could be cleaner.",1201651200,,616,4.213675213675214
2216608,2,B0007KRZUQ,"What a blessing, to have this artifact from Newton-John's days as a live concert artist. As I watched this video recently, I wonder what Olivia might think to see this- Surely she'd smile at the long-ago image of herself as a live performer on stage, only slightly past her prime as a top songbird of the 1970s. Casual fans might howl at some of the constumes and non-hit LP filler tracks being churned here. But for those rare few who absorb Olivia's each sigh as a penny from heaven, you'll find something delightful with this long forgotten concert. I for one am glad to see it preserved before the original sources decomposed from age...imagine if this had been lost forever, rotting away in a storehouse with other forgotten efforts of the 1980s- Perish the thought!",1194912000,,771,4.718518518518518
2216609,4,B0007KRZUQ,"I'm giving this DVD four stars mostly because I was in the audience when this concert was taped and seeing it again brings back some fond memories. If you are a fan of Liv you will greatly enjoy this DVD.

Be aware that this is a Korean produced DVD and the quality is not as good as it could be. One reviewer commented on the sound reflecting the acoustic quality of the 80's. Actually I think the quality of the sound is more of a manufacturing issue than the live recording. This concert recording was done by Home Box Office and shown on their cable network soon after the concert. The sound was great in that version. Too bad they don't release a DVD themselves (are you listening HBO?)

Another issue with the Korean version is that they cut out the entire opening sequence for the show. But don't let that stop you from buying.  Since this is the only version of this concert available I recommend going for it. It's great fun and seeing Olivia sing most of her hits is enjoyable. By the way, she had a bad sore throat that night but you would never know it from her performance.

An interesting side note is that Olivia was on a national tour and the stop in Ogden Utah was not long after most of the radio stations in Salt Lake City had banned ""Lets Get Physical."" Part of the opening sequence of the show projected newspaper headlines about the ban on a giant walk through screen. When she stepped through that scene her fans showed the stations what they thought of the record ban and cheered her on.",1169683200,25,1511,4.366548042704626
2216610,4,B0007KRZUQ,"Olivia fans will definitely want to own this DVD, although sadly the ""Music and Images"" introduction seen on both the videocassette and HBO versions of this concert has been cut out. That was a fun part of the show that is definitely missed.",1169510400,,241,4.627906976744186
2216611,5,B0007KRZUQ,"Taped during a 1982 concert when Olivia was 33 and at the height of her fame, Olivia absolutely shines as a performer. Watching this DVD has allowed me to understand why Olivia once was the Diva of Pop prior to Madonna and Whitney Houston. I wasn't even an Olivia fan prior to watching this DVD, and now, I am.

I think her talent and showmanship have been highly underestimated and even underappreciated.

Yes, this DVD has somewhat of a cheesy early 80s feel, but anything of that era looks sorta cheesy these days.

The subtitles are both in Korean or English. The sound can be heard either in DTS or Stereo. Although the sound quality isn't bad, it is recorded using early 80s acoustic technology and it isn't exceptional.

Don't let Olivia's early 80s music videos dissuade you from buying this DVD, she is a different type of performer live and this DVD captures her in it.",1161907200,23,879,4.579617834394904
