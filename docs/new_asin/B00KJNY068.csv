8659563,1,B00KJNY068,"Strongly advise against buying this DVD due to its terrible visual quality (virtually unwatchable).  This is too bad, as it is basically a fun Arabian Nights fantasy flick, although it would have been better without the talking camels.

Hopefully a properly restored version will eventually be released at a reasonable price.

This is a region two disc, so naturally you need a region code free DVD player to view it.",1409875200,2,417,4.928571428571429
