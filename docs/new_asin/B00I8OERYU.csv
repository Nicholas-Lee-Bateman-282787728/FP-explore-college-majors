There is nothing prurient or graphic; instead the film concentrates on the emotional connection and relationships between people.. Some of the couples are less than kind to one another: the unhappy lady who's been married 4 times cracks impotency jokes about her ailing husband, the  ""polyamorous"" fella who can't understand why his girlfriend isn't on board with his proclivities - they've broken up 27 times, another woman who feels shamed by her husband for having gained weight and thinks that's the reason he cheated on her, an unpleasant, a self absorbed young woman who starts a fight on camera, the couple rebuilding after her graphic discovery of his cheating. Some of the stories are wonderful - a tough guy who is brought to tears when talking about the love and trust he has with his wife, the religious young Egyptian couple who are incandescent with happiness, the couple who had been married 71 years who embodied the kindness and acceptance that a good marriage should have. I was very moved by the same sex couples and wish every person who doesn't believe in marriage equality would watch this movie just to see two people who love one another who happen to share the same gender. When one do the fellas starts crying about his love for his children, I cried right along with him, I would be very curious to see a follow up documentary and see who is still actually together some years later. I'm guessing Mr Polyamory and his bipolar girl are not,",1493683200,6,1537,4.8

Will we always remain as brainwashed as to vehemently encourage selflessness in everything except when it comes to sex with anyone else but our respective husbands and wives? Isn't that the biggest hypocrisy that we praise and love newness in just about everything else except for when it comes to new sexual partners, responsibly selected and enjoyed? Well, I am not sure my review will even get beyond Amazon Reviews' gatekeepers LOL. If it does, I am sure I will get plenty of heat from readers who still live in the dark ages of sexual enjoyment.",1471996800,3,706,4.795081967213115
