8175485,5,B000N7ZAR8,"Jeff has such love and passion for the animals, gets right in there, let's us experience and learn while watching him take all the risks!  He makes learning about animals fun.  Even if you are watching just for fun, his antics and enthusiasm are infectious.  I recommend it for kids of all ages, especially the grownup ones.  Great to watch on family movie night.",1363996800,,363,4.625
