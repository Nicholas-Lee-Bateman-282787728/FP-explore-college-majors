8192128,2,B000PKG6GW,"Two college couples drive to a remote region to stay at a house Sue Walker inherited from her real family, from which she was separated at nine. One guy in the nearby town had that classic small town ""parents are cousins"" lazy eye. They can only get preaching on the radio, but there is cell phone service, but alas none of them seems to own one. Fornication is sin and the wages of sin is death.

The one couple likes to play pass the doobie and hide the sausage. Sue has numerous visions on her way there, the old preacher, and a young girl about 9 years old. Weird things happen at the house as it is clearly haunted.

The movie was done well for a low budget but suffered from some really bad plot flaws, like not remembering your sibling with whom you lived with for 9 years.",1289347200,,780,4.228187919463087
8192129,3,B000PKG6GW,"The movie was okay for the most part, but it just has too many flaws to be really good. However, it could have been something great. Unfortunantly, the plot is badly disjointed, The ending made no sense, it rips off a scene from The Shining (which was a little funny), and was not all the way horrifying. The acting is terrific though, and it has it's creepy moments, but other than that...all I can say is that it could have been something awesome, but in the end, it just all fell apart. I thought it was OKAY, thats all.
grade C-

the end...",1279152000,3,544,4.281553398058253
8192130,1,B000PKG6GW,"The actors are corny, the story lacks anything to get you remotely interested ........... Just awful.  Killer DVD cover but I've seen HS Plays better than this.  AWFUL!",1278806400,2,168,4.964285714285714
8192131,1,B000PKG6GW,"I only paid $5 dollars for this DVD that contained four movies and this was among the four so i don""t feel like i lost any money__but i did lose thirty minutes of my life after i ejected it halfway through>

this hideous exercise in nothing literally looked like something a high school kid would film with his home camera and got a group of his buddies to enact four miserable charactes.  One idiot boy calls everybody ""Dude"". The girls are forever screaming about seeing somebody in the woods and so they make the ""Dude"" boy go check it out. The girls are too afraid to look themselves, you see, so they send somebody else who might be murdered--and the ""Dude"" boy does so eagerly.

There is zero rapport among the cast. They all act like they can hardly wait get away from the camera so they can go smoke some weed or guzzle some beer or hangout on their cell phones.

It's amazing that a movie so inept managed to get a DVD release. That gives me hope. I think I'll get out my cell phone and run over to the nearest Wal-Mart and make a quick 1 and 1/2 hour movie of shoppers wandering around the specials on dog food, kinda like a bunch of zombies, and sell it tothe SyFy Channel--which would probably flip out over its authentic look of real life.",1272585600,8,1252,4.314893617021276
8192132,2,B000PKG6GW,"I love horror movies, and for some reason I'm addicted to horror movies that no one has ever heard of...because sometimes you can find a good gem every now and again.  But in all honesty...wow.  This was terrible.  The acting is horrible, the story line is aweful (not to mention very confusing), and it just wasn't scary at all.  I have to admit, in the beginning I thought it might wind up being creepy, but I was wrong.  Save your money on this one, at least I only spent seven dollars on it.  The only reason I gave it two stars was because it gave my husband and I a chance to cuddle.  Other than that, I wish I would have skipped this one.",1271635200,2,645,4.153225806451613
8192133,1,B000PKG6GW,"This movie sucks. Although the cover may suggest something good, it really isn't at all. It lacks the professionality of pro-movies; everything looks and sounds amateur. And no, its not scary at all. Total waste of money coz i bought it new!, Dawm it.",1263168000,6,251,4.7272727272727275

me to take it of their hands to burn",1227398400,6,110,3.8260869565217392
8192135,5,B000PKG6GW,"this movie was well crafted. with excellent performances from all. if you want to find a good ""low budget"" movie to watch with friends, this is one you should add to your list. the camera work was very well done, the story kept you interested, the sets and location were well thought out, and i enjoyed the subtle yet incredible special effects.",1188518400,22,345,4.580645161290323
