Yes, they are actually employees of Jon, but without them, he would never have made it. Bon Jovi grew up as a band, as their fans grew up. Their music and lyrics represented adulthood, and even ventured into country music that the fans were listening to. Just remember, Bon Jovi is a band, Jon Bon Jovi is a solo act. He needs to give credit to his band and he just won't do it.",1503100800,,474,4.10752688172043
8440063,5,B004SPQ6UQ,This is an unauthorized bio of the band  I liked the dvd it to me was very well made.  They centered on following the timeline of the band.  There were some interviews from the members of the band.  There were clips from performances. I read some of the reviews that were unfavorable but I bought it anyway.  I'm glad I did I love it. If you are an die hard fan buy it you may find something new.  It is based on the band's accomplishments not on  gossip.,1366156800,2,455,4.1022727272727275
8440064,1,B004SPQ6UQ,Very little music. Disjointed interviews.  Not what I expected at all.  Save your money and buy another DVD or video.,1363392000,,117,4.8
