3744844,5,B001P9N93K,"Another wonderful Thomas DVD in new CGI animation format.  It is wonderful to see Thomas talking and more expressive.  My 2 1/2 yo son and I love to sit together and watch each story.  I love when Rosie announces in one story ""I'm driving the Carnival Special!""  It also has a bonus Rory the Racing Car story and this one gets my son laughing up a storm with the helicopter lesson.",1252022400,2,381,4.323943661971831
3744845,1,B001P9N93K,"My son has loved Thomas since he was 2. He has mild autism. Kids love Thomas-not just for the characters-but because it is predictable in setting and style. Yet new stories make it fresh each time.  The new animation makes their mouths move like Jay Jay the Jet Plane-not like Shrek.  The original Thomas stories were grounded in music and a great narrator's voice telling the story.  It is too bad they have once again ""fixed"" something that was not broken.  I wish they would stop trying to take things over the top. Our kids don't need it.  I agree with the other reviewer who gave it one star.  My son got very upset and demanded that we turn it off.  He now suspects every Thomas DVD I bring home and we have to make sure its the ""old"" Thomas.  Too bad they sold Thomas to a bigger company. It will never be the same again.",1243296000,8,828,4.262820512820513
3744846,5,B001P9N93K,"I think you just can't go wrong with Thomas & Friends. The programs always contain positive messages, they are wholesome in nature and yet still exciting enough for children to enjoy. There are always great lessons in that the characters make the same types of mistakes that everyone is prone to make. We see the consequences from being in a hurry or just plain fooling around, becoming jealous of others or lying to cover up mistakes.

These episodes feature the new CG animation, which means better facial expressions for the trains and townspeople. As always, the same great life lessons of discovery, friendship and cooperation are most certainly included.

In Thomas and the Billboard, Thomas becomes upset when he is inadvertently excluded from a photo taken of all the trains. Although it was a genuine mistake by the photographer, Thomas heatedly blames another train, which causes a whole new set of problems.

Steady Eddie refers to Edward, one of the older and most reliable trains. Because of his reputation, Steady Eddie is given the special job of delivering valuable cargo. He feels proud of his status and takes an alternate route where more people can admire him, instead of taking the directed path and gets himself into hot water.

Rosie's Carnival Special: Rosie is specially requested by Sir Topham Hatt to be one of two trains to transport the Carnival Special. Rosie is greedy and wants to do it alone, which causes an accident. She realizes that working together as a team can be very rewarding.
These are three of the six episodes on the disc. Also included are Mountain Marvel, Henry Gets it Wrong and Don't Go Back. Each one has its own valuable lesson which kids will benefit from, and plenty of action in the train yard they will enjoy.",1242518400,7,1765,4.8344370860927155
3744847,1,B001P9N93K,"My sixteen month old son loves Thomas & Friends.  This new ""improved"" version is fully computer generated.  As soon as he saw their mouths moving he FREAKED OUT and cried until I turned the DVD off.  I don't recommend buying these newer DVD's for smaller children.  It may be cool for older kids but it's frightening for youngsters who are used to the classic Thomas series.  It's a shame they had to ruin it.",1240790400,4,409,4.472972972972973
3744848,5,B001P9N93K,This DVD is a new series where Thomas and every characters are animated.  It's pretty neat to see them animated and move more than just their eyes and their mouth expressions.  PBS started playing these episodes and I'm glad they are finally out on DVD for when we travel.  My 4 year old LOVES Thomas and I have to admit I was pretty excited when these episodes came out on tv too.,1240099200,6,381,4.263888888888889

8332768,5,B001P9N93K,"Wow, my six year old son loves Thomas and the rest of the little engines on the Island of Sodor. This was a whole lot of fun to add to his collection and he has already watched it too many times for me to count. Any Thomas fan will adore this little DVD. A++",1414195200,2,258,3.7962962962962963
8332769,5,B001P9N93K,Having 18 grandchildren and 9 of them boys we see a lot of Thomas!!  This is a good one.  It was a present and our 5yr old loved it!,1388707200,,132,3.5172413793103448

Some parts, they already have memorized.

Great story and wonderful lessons, as well.",1371427200,,150,4.730769230769231

8332772,4,B001P9N93K,These are fun Thomas stories. I strongly prefer the CGI videos over the old school Thomas videos. My 2.5yo seems to have no preference. I agree with previous reviewer that Rosie and Emily sound like trannie trains. Emily's voice is deeper than Henry's! But this is not a deal breaker to me. It's gives me something to laugh at when I am reaching Thomas overload (which happens frequently in my house).,1293580800,,401,4.661971830985915
8332773,3,B001P9N93K,"I purchased this video because my 2 year old son loves Thomas and my daughter likes it as well but wants to see more of the female engines. This particular video has Rosie and Emily in it which I was very excited about....until we watched the video! Wow, the first time I heard Emily speak I was floored - she sounds like a man! This is no exxageration. I have seen her in other episodes and she does not sound this way! Later when Rosie is featured, her voice is slightly better and not as alarming, but still not very feminine at all. I just can't believe that whoever chose these voices thought that they were appropriate. My daughter even asked me ""Mommy, why do they talk like that?"". I hope this is fixed on all future episodes because it is very offputting. Sir Topham Hat's voice is also overly deep and overbearing. On another note, it is great that they have introduced Rosie and hopefully will continue to introduce more female engines for the little girls out there who like Thomas.  The stories are great but think this deserves 3 stars because of the poor voice selections.",1279324800,2,1087,4.48989898989899
8332774,1,B001P9N93K,"My kids love Thomas the Train with the old George Carlin, Ringo narrations.
We tried these new 2009 Thomas videos and our son cried when he saw the mouths
moving and the talking Topham Hatt. Our daughter turned her head away and was scared until we turned it off. Enough said, THESE STINK. Why do they have to always
""fix"" what isn't broken.",1267228800,3,341,4.428571428571429
8332775,5,B001P9N93K,"I bought this movie for my 3 year old son. At first he was not happy about ""talking thomas"" and wanted to watch an old Thomas movie. The next day he asked to watch ""talking thomas"" and enjoys watching it every time now.
I am also a preschool teacher, and for a special treat on Fridays we watch a movie. I brought in this movie to watch, every single boy I have LOVED it and always ask me if we can watch ""Talking Thomas"" for movie day.",1253664000,3,436,4.022988505747127
