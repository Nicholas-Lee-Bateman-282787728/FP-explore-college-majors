535296,4,630301836X,I really enjoyed it when it first came on the USA network 1990 i watched 3 different times. Sammi Davis is awesome as the Bride who kills people who gets in the way of her finace.  If saw another one I recommend is Called  Hush Little Baby it is the same type pf movie.  There are some very  talented people in The Perfect Bride like Kelly Preston (John Travolta's  wife) Liden Ashby (from The defunct Melrose Place) Tamara Clatterbuck  (Alice Johnson from The Young and The Restless. So i really hope u liked it  like I did.  It keeps u on the end of your seat.,960595200,9,562,4.235849056603773

7834677,2,630301836X,"Sammi Davis stars as a psycho bride who wants to prove to herself that her new husband is not like most men - piggish and self-occupied - and when she is eventually deceived, she plots his murder and the murder of friends and family of his who get in the way. Even the chase scene towards the end and the performances of Kelly Present and Davis can't make up for the otherwise bore and amateurish feeling of this film. The script is written as though it were a SCT skit, and the stunts are terrible. It's often entertaining in some ways, but the majority of the time, you're left sitting there looking at the screen and thinking: ""Did I once have that sort of haircut?""",1071792000,3,669,4.36
