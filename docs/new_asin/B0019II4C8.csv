8326217,5,B0019II4C8,"This video is a favorite of mine.  I view it on a regular basis especially on days that have been extra stressful. In the producing of this DVD The producer didn't film even one tall building, highway, or shopping mall. You won't even see more than a couple of human beings. What he does show is a gorgeous voyage through the natural wonders of Arizona.

He takes us on a sensory journey through the unique and amazing natural beauty of Arizona. I daresay that numerous Arizonans have not explored many of the places that are depicted in this video.

This video is great as a vacation keepsake or a wonderful gift for anyone who loves beauty.

The 40 minutes of photography is set to lovely music and no annoying narration. The music complements the piece by being quiet and calm. So peaceful. I rate it 5 Stars.",1216425600,2,812,4.503401360544218
