974349,3,6305177317,"Here is another of those little movies, that catch your attention and end up staying on your mind long after they end. While flipping through the movie channels, I came across Land Girls. I just happenend on the roll in the hay scene between Anna Friel and Steven Mackintosh. Well naturally, I stopped my surfing to take in this wonderful and comedic moment of the film. Having been hooked, I watched the remainder and like other reviewers was surprised to learn of the ""Land Girls"".  Yet another aspect of the Second World War that I had yet to learn.

The three woman Catherine McCormack, Rachel Weisz, Anna Friel are a delight to watch. It would be difficult to imagine three more appealing women in this setting. Mackintosh is equally appealing as a young man stuck on the farm and for some reason passed over by the recruiting boards. And yet, what a lucky fellow to pass his days with such lovely and interesting women.

So, it is true that the Merchant and Ivory crowd will probably find this moving more appealing than the average ""meat and potatoes"" film viewer, but this movie has just enough spice, energy and beauty to hold even the non-chic flick viewer's attention.

It certainly held mine through successive viewings. I guess I hoped that she would finally step off the train at the end...I guess I really wanted that ending. Watch this engaging film and see if you too...don't wish for the same ending.",1225065600,4,1418,4.682730923694779
974350,5,6305177317,"My husband and I often rent or buy films about WWII. His father was a pilot who suffered severe injuries in the war. He married a girl from South Hampton. She worked in a factory throughout the war. Her father refused to go into bomb shelters. He'd sit on the lawn, drinking a pint, cursing the Germans. We had seen Steven MackIntosh in the ""Prime Suspect,"" episode 5, wherein he played a hideously vicious gang leader. He was as fascinating as Bill the Butcher in that role. ""Land Girls"" started out sort of Larky, with 3 girls off to work on a beautifully real old fashioned farm. The scenery is amazing. The Plough horses are lovely. You get a glimpse of Joe's kindness as he brushes down one of the horses, with Ag watching. Altho' he is hard put to turn down the advances of these young women, Joe eventually falls in love with one.  Ralph Bellamy has a touching role (he played the imaginary room-mate in ""Beautiful Mind"") Every member of this cast was brilliant. Nothing turns out as would be expected. It's a point of pride with me that I rarely ever cry but my husband and I had tears in our eyes during many scenes (especially the end) of this elegantly told story.  Do buy it! I shall watch it over & over again. Blessings on everyone involved in the making of this lovely film.",1204156800,4,1289,4.411764705882353
974351,4,6305177317,"Yes, the scenery is wonderful, but the book is paced better. And, having grown up on a farm, how the heck did they think anyone would thresh grain in the winter? Where were the historical advisers? Threshing is done in the hottest part of the year, usually July.",1153785600,5,262,4.479166666666667
974352,4,6305177317,"I bought this movie after I returned from a trip to Somerset and Devon and wanted more of the scenery to savor.  (I have a habit of regarding all movies as basically travelogues).

I was not disappointed...the scenery is exquisite.  What surprised me was that the movie itself is very good. (I had not heard of it before...just found it in search of Exmoor movies, and I had never heard of the program that sent young city women to work on farms during WW II).

Rachel Weisz was outstanding...it was easy to see from her performance that she is ""going places.""",1141603200,4,560,4.514851485148514
974353,4,6305177317,"Being English, I can relate to the trauma's of this wonderful movie. It is real life of war torn England in the face of defeat. They could not have picked better actors for this movie and the scenery of land and the farm are excellant..One could really """"smell"""" the farm house and it's surrounds..wonderful!!",1090540800,13,309,4.7407407407407405
974354,4,6305177317,"I came across this movie a few years ago and decided to buy. The movie tell the story of three youngs British women who during WW 2, join the Woman Land Army (Women were need to work the fields, while the men were in combat) And this experence changed theirs live for ever. The action and locations are great. A great movie for any fan of this era.",1055635200,12,348,4.132352941176471
974355,4,6305177317,"I WAS AN 8 yr. OLD ENGLISH BOY DURING THIS PERIOD OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR..THIS MOVIE IS SO CLOSE TO THE TRUTH THAT IT IS UNBELIEVABLE. MANY A YOUNG WOMEN IN MY AREA WERE LAND GIRLS WHO MARRIED SERVICEMEN OF ALL COUNTRIES AND HAD THEIR DREAMS DASHED BY DEATH. THE FARM YARD SETTINGS AND THE SOUNDS OF THE ANIMALS TOOK ME BACK ""HOME""--ESPECIALLY MILKING TIME--I KNOW--I RATE THE MOVIE AS ""BEAUTIFUL""",1019952000,10,398,4.541666666666667
974356,1,6305177317,"I like World War II dramas particularly the ones that delve into the more obscure aspects.  Many interesting character dramas have evolved, notably, Schindler's List, Memphis Belle, The Americanization of Emily, Tuskeegee  Airmen,  and Hiroshima. Even the bio pics: Patton, Truman, Eisenhower all  provided interesting perspective for me, where I had none before.
The  idea that England had a Woman's Land Army in WWII, whereby women went to  take over farm chores as the men have gone off to war, sounds interesting.  Women of all shapes and sizes, and backgrounds banding together for the  common good, yep, it definitely has possibilities.
Now add Catherine  McCormack in the lead, a woman who has the opportunity over the next few  years to surpass Michelle Pfeiffer, as the beautiful woman who CAN act,  throw in stunning  period locations and costumes, and Land Girls should not  fail.
But fail it does.
The story of these three women (McCormack,  Rachel Weisz, Anna Friel) is limp and un-centered, where, by comparison,  The Tuskeegee Airmen is driving and informative.
Pass on this mess, and  if you want to see more of Catherine McCormack (aside from Braveheart)  choose Dangerous Beauty instead.",950400000,11,1205,5.160621761658031

7884118,5,6305177317,"This is a terrific WW2 movie, heartfelt and true to life, of young women becoming farm workers in Britain.  Since so much food and supplies sent by the U.S. were sunk by German u-boats, keeping British farms productive was imperative while their men were away fighting. I must say that I enjoyed this movie more than the TV version (which was good but seemed to go on as long as the war itself). This movie is very concise and to the point. HOWEVER, I've been looking to buy it for years and never could understand the unavailability of a Region 1 DVD of a quality film with this great cast.",1502150400,,591,4.372727272727273

7884124,4,6305177317,"Exceptionally good choice of actors, and thankfully including realistic hard outdoor work while showing typical weather conditions of the country and the limited conveniences in war-time and of the era. I grew up in the 50's and 60's and it was a bit too liberated as compared to where and when I grew up, but then, maybe I wasn't! I liked it in the same way I like Foyle's War episodes. I wanted to see this older production before seeing the current Land Girls series. I will watch it again....",1325894400,,496,4.522222222222222
7884125,4,6305177317,"This movie gave me a further glimpse into how women supported the war effort while the men were fighting the war.  I've often heard about women taking over men's jobs in the factories making parts for war machinery, but had not thought about nor heard about those who took over working the farm fields.  They not only filled a vacancy left by the farmer's sons, but broke new ground in order to increase the production needed to feed the troops as well as those left behind in the country.  One of my favorite actresses was in this film and that was my reason for purchasing it.  I'm very happy I did.  I enjoyed the storyline as well as learning something new!",1317600000,,661,4.429752066115703
