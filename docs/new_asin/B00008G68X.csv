7982468,5,B00008G68X,One of the greatest voices of all time in a captivating heartfelt performance.  She give her all in this one.,1366934400,,109,4.45
7982469,2,B00008G68X,"I thought I must have gotten the wrong product; but checking the other reviews- I can see I've got the same thing. I bought ""Used-Like New""; and it is as good as if brand-new. This is a Japanese??? official BMG Product.  Bad sound? I did what the other reviewer said and played with the DVD audio settings and managed to get a much better sound than the default. I was hoping this was the HBO special I remember that was great with her brother, Bobby Brown, and many others. That one is known as ""Classic Whitney"" from a  3 night concert in Wash DC 1997. As far as I can tell, HBO never released that good one on DVD or VHS, and it was awesome. By comparison this is terrible. This DVD comes from another HBO special; ""Welcome Home Heroes""; 2001 or 2002, looks like on an aircraft carrier or something.
On this DVD, like another reviewer remarked; a number of songs are missing. Fortunately, all this and much more is available out on the 'tube- absolutely incredible amount of material out there. However; it does have all the songs that it says it has on the back cover of the DVD case.
Wanna Dance w/ Somebody
How Will I Know
Medley=Didn't we almost Have it all/House Not a Home/Where Broken Hearts Go.
All the Man I Need
Name not Susan
Anymore
A Song for You
Revelation
Who Do You Love
Greatest Love
Also the menu on the DVD doesn't work right; for instance, menu says: ""I'm Your Baby Tonight"". But it can't be selected, and it's not on the DVD. But it is out on the 'tube.
I don't know what some of those other reviewers saw in this- but to me, it's strictly a 2nd or 3rd rate performance at best; with lots of very short brief little moments.  My like-new copy is going right back for sale as used, but I don't recommend it unless you're some kind of collector. Again, check the 'tube for lots and lots of REALLY, great Whitney stuff.",1227052800,2,1840,4.312138728323699
7982470,4,B00008G68X,"This concert catches Whitney during a time when she couldn't sing a sour note if she tried.  The music pours from her.  And the audience is amazing.  The excited U.S. military persons in attendance yelling & cheering her on, and the VOICE with all her stage presence...it's hot.  Whitney has a way of being sexy & sensual, while maintaining such a demure and truly classy poise. Her soul shines through when she sings.
  The downside to this DVD is the fact that it looks like it was filmed with some kind of a cheap bootleg poor quality camera and some of the songs, including I'm Your Baby Tonight and Saving All My Love For You are on the menu screen but are not available (which is quite frustrating).  I suggest finding the actual DVD of this concert entitled Welcome Home, Heroes. That version is longer, includes several more songs and features and looks professionally filmed.
So, Whitney gets FIVE STARS, but the DVD gets 3.",1219190400,,933,4.618181818181818
7982471,3,B00008G68X,"This DVD certainly shows its age - the costumes and production from 1991 look even older - a hangover from the 1980's.

When I first played it the sound quality was terrible, you could hardly hear Whitney sing at all. However, I found that by disabling 5.1 surround sound, and running an 'auto' scan on my DVD/sound system, the audio balanced out OK (I assume it is encoded in stereo only), and Whitney's voice was 10 times better.

The stage scenario is a bit cheesy - and the scene with the American kid  on the stool and his constantly interferring sailor dad got a bit annoying, but as this is the ONLY live DVD ever produced by Whitney, I guess we will just have to enjoy what we can!

Looking at it from a current (2006) point of view the feeling is one of lost brilliance, and a tragic conclusion to what should have been the greatest singing career in history - can you image what she could have done if she had continued?

For me the slow songs come across the best, but the program is a short one, and you are left with a slightly dissapointed feeling on the whole.

A must for true fans who just have to have some live footage, but for the slightly curious this is best avoided as it does little justice to the womans greatness - get a CD instead!",1148342400,4,1258,4.264705882352941
7982472,5,B00008G68X,"You'd be a ""FOOL"" not to purchase this dvd.",1116115200,4,43,3.888888888888889
7982473,2,B00008G68X,"The reason I've given this 2 stars is because of how terrible the sound quality is.  She is OBVIOUSLY singing VERY VERY well, and her voice is PERFECT, but it's so hard to hear her and at some points you can't!

The songs and song choices are good, but this simply isn't just worth the money.  It's sad that I was so excited for this and spent so much money for it and ended up being SEVERELY disappointed.",1107475200,4,406,4.17948717948718
7982474,2,B00008G68X,"I must preface this by saying I am one of the biggest Whitney fans out there. Prior to her drug addiction days, Whitney always sang perfectly and no one (including Mariah Carey and Aretha Franklin) could compare to her.

Nonetheless, I am still disappointed by this concert. Whitney's microphone is turned on too low compared to the rest of the music.  The overall effect is that her voice barely seeps through the music.

This is particularly disappointing because it's clear that Whitney did sing very well in this performance.  Indeed, her rendition of ""A song for you"" where the backgroup music is softer shows how spectactular her vocal abilities were.  Unfortunately, the rest of the songs are marred by the overbearing background music",1105056000,6,742,5.0
7982475,5,B00008G68X,"This is a nice live dvd to add to your collection. Whitney really shows why she's the greatest in this one. Just to inform anyone who is thinking about purchasing it, this is from her first album up until the I'm Your Baby tonight album. Just a heads up, because i was looking for some songs from the bodyguard myself. But it is still an awesome show. I remember when It came on HBO, but i didn't remember in detail what she performed. (over 10 years ago). But If you like NIPPY, you'll enjoy it anyway because it's her doing her thang ! !",1070064000,14,539,4.1923076923076925
7982476,5,B00008G68X,"Whitney Houston Welcome Home The Heroes is one of the best concerts she has ever done.  This concerts had great arrangements that met her vocals head to head.  The absolute favorite songs on this video is "" All the Man that I Need"" because she brings a little slow remix to the arrangement that was already beautiful.  The other song is "" A Song For You"" which is a Donny Hathaway song that she made into her own.  She really did those two songs some justice.  The video is great. It will be a perfect addition to your concert collections.  If you're a true fan, this video should be with the South Africa Concert and The Classic Whitney Concert that came on HBO, that you should have taped when it aired.",1067472000,4,705,4.343511450381679
7982477,5,B00008G68X,"I own this concert in LVD(Laser Video Disc)version (1991). Indeed, a very ""interesting"" concert in many respects :
1)Whitney Houston sings for the American troops coming back from the first war against Irak : this concert is produced ""with the cooperation of the Department of the Navy and the Department of Defense"". I might be wrong but, Whitney Houston is the first Black singer to be hired to sing for the American troops.
Let me tell you that she has unanimous backing from all these KIDS!

2)The Director is David Mallet : he also directed some of Tina Turner's concerts : good ""prises de vue"" and so emotional...
3)Whitney Houston's performance in this concert is so excellent that you'll need to play it over and over again...
4)I like ALL the songs performed in this unforgettable concert but ""All the Man that I Need"",""Greatest Love of All"" & ""A Song for You"" are my favourite : Whitney is at her best !
""WELCOME HOME HEROES WITH WHITNEY HOUSTON"", Live in Concert, is just a moment of pure emotion : she's talented, she's beautiful and above all, the soldiers seem so terribly relieved to be home.
THIS CONCERT IS ALSO A HISTORICAL MOMENT !
It will also probably make you think about what's happening NOW.",1058832000,16,1215,4.677570093457944
