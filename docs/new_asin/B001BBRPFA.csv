8282597,4,B001BBRPFA,"Excellent images. Soundtrack, while not bad, could use some re-work to match the quality of the video.",1503100800,,102,5.0588235294117645
8282598,5,B001BBRPFA,It was everything I was looking for in pictures of nebulas.,1467244800,,59,4.454545454545454
8282599,5,B001BBRPFA,I loved it . the pictures were awesom and the music fit the pictures. To think of all the millions of galexies that exist in our universe is mind blowing.,1425081600,,154,4.166666666666667
8282600,5,B001BBRPFA,"I was looking for a video that had stars, planets or space in it as well as relaxing music. This video is exactly what I had in mind! It has beautiful, clear galaxy imagery with inspiring music. I would order more videos from this company...very pleased with my purchase.",1334620800,,271,4.551020408163265
8282601,3,B001BBRPFA,This is an excellent collection of images of the universe but the music-well it didn't work. So watch this on mute and crank-up your own tunes and all will be better.,1325462400,,166,4.387096774193548
8282602,5,B001BBRPFA,This is amazing.  You can watch it with or without captions.  The captions are so informative.  The images are captivating.,1318809600,,123,5.05
8282603,2,B001BBRPFA,This DVD was disappointing.  The subtitles talk about the pictures but nothing is really explained (ie previous knowledge is needed to understand what they are talking about).  Saving it for a day I am sick/absent.  Hopefully that will be after we have covered most of the material that has to do with stars,1317340800,,307,4.754716981132075
8282604,5,B001BBRPFA,This is an awesome DVD!  You will want to watch this video over and over!  The images are the latest ones from the telescope in 2008! The optional subtitles are a great way to learn about the star images. Everyone who has seen it has been absolutely amazed!,1232668800,7,257,4.333333333333333
8282605,3,B001BBRPFA,"This DVD has some spectacular pictures of celestial objects in the heavens as seen through Hubble telescope. Stargaze and Stargaze II, the early versions of Hubble pictures were produced in 2000 and 2004 respectively and the current DVD was produced in 2008, which has about 43 minutes. It has pictures of galactic and stellar nebula, violently exploding stars, colliding galaxies and the turbulent interstellar gases giving birth to new stars, interstellar dust and from the reflecting & refracting light emerges a sublime celestial beauty in variety of colors. In its 17 years of exploring the heavens, NASA's Hubble Space Telescope has snapped nearly 500,000 images.

Since stars emit radiation at various energy levels, the pictures of Hubble telescope are analyzed in conjunction with Chandra X-ray telescope, and Spitzer telescope. Chandra is useful for very hot but low density cosmic bodies. Hubble is useful for high density objects and Spitzer is useful to look at the extrasolar planets. The spectacular lights of Helix nebula, gamma ray bursts. The Schumacher - Levy 9 comet that hit the giant Jupiter is spectacularly captured by Hubble. The light produced upon impact of Jovian surface is very luminous. The Sombrero galaxy looks elegant and very majestic across Hubble image. You can also view the Columbia space shuttle crew that installed the solar panels and a new camera in 2002. It looks marvelous to see the astronauts fiddling with nuts and bolts in space.

The simulation (animation) of star accretion around a black hole, the fantasy flight into the galactic center (black hole), stellar disc formation (planetary nebula), globular cluster formation and the spectacular galactic collisions between two galaxies and how the gas is spewed over a wide distance in intergalactic space and its reformation into one united galaxy.

Hubble is about 350 miles above the surface of earth, and it has achieved numerous victories in its 17 years of operation. It helped to detect the oldest planets in the galaxy, determine the age of the universe, study the structures of stellar nebula, pictures of deep space galaxies; galaxies that were formed when the universe was about a billion year old. It also helped to understand how stars die; either through violent stellar explosions (supernova) or disappear gradually without the spectacular burst of supernova. It took pictures of Mars when it was closest to earth in 2003, and it shows fine details of Martian surface with polar ice caps, and the valleys that looks like water once flowed across the planet. This DVD is fine addition to our personal library.
