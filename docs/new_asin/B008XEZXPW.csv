8532154,5,B008XEZXPW,"This is a really good series. As of collection 4, the girls started getting annoying. This collection is filed wit huge amounts of feels and some of the best episodes in the series. I just wish there were collections 5, 6, 7, and infinity, I mean it's easier to keep track of with this many, but I wish there was more. There's not much more to say, I've already written 4 other reviews(including my anime list). I can say now that Psychic squad is a show to must watch and buy",1469836800,,476,4.241758241758242
