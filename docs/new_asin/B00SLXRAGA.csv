Over 1,000 movies later I had watched all of ""the classics"" Citizen Kane, The Godfather, Cassablanca, Raging Bull, etc. but I was missing something. That thing is a grown man in a cat suit stopping kids from being bullied. The other night I had my boss over for dinner and happened to have Cool Cat Saves The Kids on, at first he was a little bit confused as to what I was watching, but as soon as he saw Cool Cat handle Gun Safety, he offered me his position as work.

6991442,5,B00SLXRAGA,"Clearly Cool Cat is meant to represent this generation of children, they're all in pacts and act how society wants them to act: exactly alike showing no difference in personality. I think the bully represents the one being who rebells against society, he's trying to tell Cool Cat ""why? why do you act the same? Can't you see we're all falling for life's game?"" him destroying the sandcastle is shattering Cool Cat's psyche, Cool Cat is now confused asking himself ""was he right? Am I just another pawn?"" Vivica A. Fox and Erik Estrada are most likely the antagonists of this film ""people use to pick on me, and than I learned how to react"" is the Vivica saying ""you must eliminate all individual thought and mind from yourself, learn how to be the average child going through adolescence, just as I have!"" the reason why the bully's accent is so hard to understand is because we're seeing the events through Cool Cat's eyes, because society wants him to think like everybody else, all Cool Cat hears from the bully is gibberish, he assumes the bully is doing crimes against society when in fact he is not: the bully is saving society! Destroying the sand castle was meant to shatter and break Cool Cat's mind, trying to make him join the rebellion, of course this backfired thanks to Vivica and Erik. Spray painting the wall is meant to represent the bully shattering society's boundaries, he's trying to break the shackles from society's limit in the individuals thought, Derek Savage is Cool Cat's representation of himself, anything that Derek says he must obey, Derek orders Cool Cat to wish everybody a Merry Christmas and a happy holidays because it is meant to represent society's thought on how most of the world is Christian, he says happy holidays because he hopes it does not offend those who are not Christian, but lets think about this for a second: not once does Cool Cat mention specific holidays like Hanukkah or Kwanzaa, judging by the crowd of people who came to see Cool Cat I'm going to assume that over 40 percent of them were not Christian, not only does this masterpiece judge society's shackles but it judges the thought on religion itself! Cool Cat running through the streets is himself running through his mind asking himself ""what am I? Who am I? Am I just a tool? Another worthless life to be forgotten?"" as he says to himself ""no! No! I am different! I will break the walls that separate human life!"" as this change occurs, Derek becomes a positive force for Cool Cat, telling him to find a meaning in his life, the exercise provides proof of this! As Cool Cat begins his rebellion against society, he joins forces with the children who are too young to find meaning, because of their age they have not found themselves, showing how we can shape children's role in life, will they be another copy? Or someone who will change the world? As the rebellion begins Cool Cat finds a gun, this is meant to represent society's law and police force, showing how the police will use violence in order to keep the walls of society stable ""we should tell our parents and teachers about this"" actually means ""this is proof, this is proof about how our freedom is limited and dull, we must show the authorities this proof to bring down the order"" at this time, the bully who is responsible for freeing Cool Cat takes a turn as his rebellion goes to extreme. Taking Scott's lunch money is the bully's way of showing force and violence to the authorities that have built society's walls, the bully wants to break the walls, Cool Cat wants to show the wall builders that they too can change, change society as a whole, this is a fantastic plot twist that only the genius behind this film can pull off, as the final line by Derek is delivered ""look!"" it is meant to leave the viewer wanting more! Wanting to build hype! But in the end the viewer is left in disappointment, which is to represent humanity's thought of hope, do we take our hope for granted? Or do we let others control our hope? This trailer represents THE FEW of the messages Cool Cat delivers! This film no only deserves an Oscar, but a Nobel Peace Prize! All other artistic media should be put to shame because of Cool Cat, bless you all for making such a masterpiece!",1425081600,72,4249,4.5847568988173455

6991447,1,B00SLXRAGA,"I bought this movie for my kids expecting a nice family friendly movie about bullying and gun safety, and that's certainly not what I got. What I got instead was a movie about a 6ft tall man in a cat suit who has sexual relations with a man referred to as ""Daddy Derek"" and his own mother. Imagine Fifty Shades of Grey, but with furries (a furry, if you aren't aware, is someone who dresses up like an animal, sometimes as a kink/fetish) Not only that, but he's also in a sexual relationship with two underaged girls and promotes dangerous acts such as crossing the road without looking both ways. At one point, he even plants a gun in one of the little girl's backyards to try and frame a little boy because he has a crush on the little girl (the one Cool Cat's doing sexual things with) He calls the police and the innocent boy is sent to jail, because Cool Cat is horny, jealous pedophile.  Daddy Derek also drives around in a van and picks up kids off the street, where he then takes them back to his house to use as sex slaves and converts them to his religion ""Groovyism"". Later in the movie, Cool Cat and Daddy Derek do a sacred dance known as the ""Boogie Woogie"" to try and summon their Grooy overlord. Cool Cat gets high on acid, as well as a mix of various other drugs, and has intense fever dreams that are both disturbing and gory. Cool Cat also goes onto FaceBook and tells 5 teenage boys to hang themselves. Once they do, Cool Cat burns down their houses, murders their families and dances on their graves. He also has a threesome with the two underage girls (while still on the dead kids graves). Later on there's an intense and, quite frankly, disturbing scene in which Cool Cat, his mother, Daddy Derek, the two underage girl and 10 of their sex slaves have an orgy that involves, bondage, gagging, role play, blindfolding, marking, hair pulling, burn play, cross dressing, rimming, fisting and blood play. The orgy is so intense that 5 of the sex slaves die in the process. The remains members of the orgy eat their remains off of each other's naked bodies.",1507939200,5,2075,4.417754569190601
6991448,1,B00SLXRAGA,"This movie is utter garbage. It teaches children terrible lessons like that anyone who has no friends is a bully and constantly which hurts children who have no friends. He also encourages things like opening anonymous text messages and cool cat sometimes contradicts himself like when he says to always look both ways before crossing the road but then runs across without looking not long after. There's also a sexual relationship between Daddy Derek (That is actually his name in the movie) and a cat lady. Also, I'm pretty sure that if cool cat was a real person then he'd be on to catch a predator. Overall, the only part of the movie I enjoyed was when some guy walked outside, saw the atrocity that is cool cat, and imminently walked backwards into his house.",1506211200,,765,4.674074074074074
6991449,5,B00SLXRAGA,"Wow. I will admit at first I was put off by the cover art, but boy was I wrong! ""Cool Cat Saves The Kids"" is more than a film; it's an amazing cinematic achievement. Dives deep into the human condition and what children of today do when faced with serious issues like guns, bullies, and unsolicited text messages. Another little treat this has to offer is a nice song you'll be singing for days (I can't believe it got snubbed for Best Original Song) called ""Cool Cat Likes To Rock and Roll,"" sung by the insanely talented and unbearably sexy Derek Savage, who also plays Cool Cat's father. Cool Cat himself is a complex character. Friendly and always willing to help, but also tormented by his own demons and the incredible pressure of being in the Hollywood Parade. The bully is one of the most memorable and evil villains in recent cinema. He spray paints signs and even brings a gun to school. There is a scene involving his arrest that serves as an astounding social commentary on the myth of white privilege and how no race is safe from police brutality. There are also cameos by the beautiful Vivica A Fox and Erik Estrada, whose line, ""Dere 'e is!"" will go down in history as one of the most memorable quotes ever to be put on film.

I cannot recommend this film enough. The whole family should watch together, even with its darker themes and mature subject matter. A lot of the one star reviews are by people who clearly missed the allegories in the movie. And remember: Cool Cat Loves You!",1505865600,4,1499,4.490842490842491

Story
This film seems to be a harmless anti-bullying/gun safety p.s.a. movie at first glance, but is much worse once you start watching it.
The supposed plot is that the title character is to save kids from bullying, peer pressure and teach them about gun safety, but it tells the morals in a completely wrong way, since the adult characters are the ones who do all the saving in this film instead of Cool Cat.

Production
The pacing is atrocious, with multiple filler segments, bad special effects, atrocious editing and sub-plots that have no proper cohesive sequencing. It's ironic that the bully character is the only one who sounds like the only one who did their lines in more than one take.

Critical Reception
Now for the infamous part, how the film's director handled criticism of his product after it was released.
Initially, Derek Savage took reviews criticizing his film well, even applauding one review by YouTube user Your Movie Sucks. After a parody Cool Cat Twitter account opened up though, Derek got extremely pissed off and went on a flagging frenzy, filing fraudulent DMCA strikes against multiple reviews of his movie. Derek repeatedly harassed a couple of reviewers by e-mail, with YouTube user I Hate Everything receiving the lion's share of the abuse, including threats of legal action if he didn't take down every video he made involving the character. Derek even went so far as to dox another YouTube user who made a parody of Cool Cat joining ISIS and threatened to send said user's address to ISIS, both of which are felonies.

In conclusion, this is a lazily slapped together hodgepodge p.s.a. that over explains everything, is creepy on so many levels, and marketed by someone who claims to want to stop bullying, only to resort to bullying anyone who dares call his awful product out for being awful. Do yourself a favor and avoid this film like the plague, there's better educational films to spend you money on.",1504051200,,1961,4.862275449101796

6991462,1,B00SLXRAGA,I saw the YourMovieSucks and I Hate Everything videos of this film and wanted to get a copy of my own to show to my friends only to find within the first 10 minutes that Derek Savage had re-edited the film the remove some of the more notorious lines and bits talked about in the YMS and IHE videos. Things like Cool Cat encouraging kids to read texts from strangers and even hilarious background mistakes like the guy accidentally walking out of his house in the middle of a take have either been redubbed or edited out of the film (undoubtedly in response to the YMS & IHE vids because it's well known by now that Derek Savage has seen both of the videos). In essence meaning that a lot of the funnier elements of the film that would encourage someone to watch the film purely out of ironic pleasure have been removed. So be aware that if you're going to get a copy of this movie either try to find an older copy of the DVD that wasn't made in 2016 or watch the YMS & IHE reviews to catch glimpses of the more hilarious parts of the film.,1488153600,10,1039,4.2

6991471,5,B00SLXRAGA,"Stirred by the visionary power of ""Dark City,"" I revisited Derek Savage's ""Cool Cat Saves The kids"" and once again fell under its eerie spell. The movie has a plot that defies common sense, but its very discontinuity is a strength. It makes ""Cool Cat"" hallucinatory--a nightmare without the reassurance of a steadying story line. Few films have ever been more visually exhilarating

What many of these movies have in common is a loner hero who discovers the inner workings of the future society, penetrating the system that would control the population. Even Batman's villains are the descendants of Butch the bully, giggling as they pull the levels that will enforce their will. The buried message is powerful: Science and industry will become the weapons of demagogues.

Cool Cat Saves The kids does what many great films do, creating a time, place and characters so striking that they become part of our arsenal of images for imagining the world. The ideas of Cool Cat have been so often absorbed into popular culture that its horrific future city is almost a given (when Albert Brooks dared to create an alternative utopian future in 1991 with Defending Your Life, it seemed wrong, somehow, without Satanic urban hellscapes). Lang filmed for nearly a year, driven by obsession, often cruel to his colleagues, a perfectionist madman, and the result is one of those seminal films without which the others cannot be fully appreciated.",1480723200,10,1435,5.0

6991477,1,B00SLXRAGA,"I'm reviewing this as a product and for its contents. My purchase was through the official Cool Cat Saves the Kids website which includes a book and poster.

For the actual product, the entire package is cheaply put together with a clear homemade DVD label sticking to a bulk-produced DVD collection and lacking the solid matte feeling you get from bigger budget DVDs.

The fold-out poster is disturbing. Yes, the product details do mention that the poster will be folded with noticeable creases, but the art...Just, why? Why even put in the effort to print the poster when it doesn't convey anything about Cool Cat being a good role model or standing up for what is exemplary to kids? It's just a poster of his gaping toothless smiling face. I've tucked it away in a dark corner so I won't have to look into those dead black eyes every time my head turns to the wall.

As for the book, well, it's a book. The construction is what you'd expect from a simple kids' book, but the art is equally horrendous as the packaging and quality. Something's wrong with the proportions of the legs and hands. Ironically, the bully is the most presentable figure in the illustrations because he's purposefully drawn to be unlikable. Cool Cat, in contrast, looks so out of place with his enlarged head and legs that are sometimes scrawny and sometimes outright wrestler levels of buff. Why is he orange? It's gross. That's my opinion, but my opinion is that he's gross. Butch is right: he has a big nose--a big stupid nose that cats don't have in real life. I know this is an artists' rendition of Cool Cat, but it's a poor one which makes me think Derek Savage scraped the bottom of the barrel for a cheap artist. At least someone got paid, I hope.

---

Onto the actual movie and its contents. I'm not an avid movie watcher. I can't consider myself a great critic, but as a viewer, I can afford to be a little critical. My goodness, this movie as a whole is awful. The sets are cheap and simply there, the music is lower than stock-quality in terms of royalty free soundtracks you can use in this current decade, and the lighting and sound are shoddy at best. Actually, looking back to the credits, I don't believe anyone was particularly responsible for the sound editing and lighting, which makes sense when looking at the end product.

Same goes for sound. Cool Cat's voice has a reverb to it, most likely from speaking into his helmet. The real actors' voices aren't much better, as in indoor scenes, the effect of recording in a real kitchen creates a slight echo that bounces off walls and gives it a hollow noise. Outside, the wind clips into the microphones, and there are a few times when you can hear soft whispering or breathing from crew members or actors off-camera.

I honestly can't believe there were so many people in charge of the cameras, and somehow the director managed to screw that up. In the very beginning shot, you can see the shadow of the cameraman walking into the house. Could you not just wait for the sun to change directions before filming the very first scene of the movie, or were you on a time budget? Wait, I take that back. Time couldn't have been an issue because it looks like this movie took a few months to film. In the first part of the movie, you can tell it looks like late spring or mid-summer from the clear weather and clothes everyone's wearing, but in the later part of the movie, everyone's starting to break out their pants and jackets. The rose bush in front of the main house that was once green and blooming became brown and wilted. At the school where they were also filming, the sky looked overcast, something that usually occurs in the cooler months in Los Angeles. Either that or they filmed in the evening when school shouldn't even be in session. Ugh, I can't believe I even paid attention to that. Moving on.

For those who have seen the reviews on this movie circulating around, you know the basics of the plot: Cool Cat is running for school president when Butch, the bully, starts to intervene with his campaign signs. Through a series of mishaps, Cool Cat must endure basic methods of bullying from vandalism, prank calls, cyberbullying (though for the light of me I can't imagine how Butch got Cool Cat's e-mail), physical assault, theft, and posing potential gun threats. There are subplots involved with Cool Cat going to a parade and winning a writing contest, but more into that later.

If you take away the fact that Cool Cat seems to tower over everyone, kids and adults included, it's still hard to relate to Cool Cat as being a ""cool cat."" He screams obnoxiously in a voice that could only be expressed by someone stereotyping a hyperactive go-getter. That's not cool; that's annoying. I personally would never want to hang out with someone who could make me potentially go deaf.

Cool Cat's enthusiasm is more draining than it is engrossing; several times I tried to wonder what sort of...middle-schooler(?) teenager(?) elementary school kid(?)...would even speak like the main character. He's too hyped about everything. He's excited about waking up, eating ""nutritious meals,"" exercising, doing work, having fun, etc. That's great and all, but he goes out of his way to verbally express every fiber to his enthusiasm to the point of non-believability. Phrases like ""Exquisite"" and ""Awesome!"" can only take you so far. Also, he has this innate urge to laugh with an echo in his mask whenever finishing off a phrase now and then. My gosh, he might laugh more awkwardly and frequently than Johnny from ""The Room.""

The other actors aren't great, either. You can tell they're actors because of their enunciations and child lisps when they speak. I know it's hard to recruit kid actors, but there's a strange aura of immersion breaking that makes me see the entire movie as scripted and unnatural. This is a recurring problem with most films focusing on anti-bullying messages, but with this film and a man in a cat costume, the director could have gone out of his way to address some problems more realistically.

That brings me to the actual focus of anti-bullying messages presented in the film. Cool Cat, himself doesn't really do anything to solve the problem; it's more of a series of conveniences and plot devices that get him out of a situation. This is a kids' movie, sure, but it fails to tackle the seriousness and magnitude of real-life situations where kids can be isolated and hurt because of bullies. With this age range, most kids who are bullied experience it in a school setting, not in a suburban neighborhood.

The movie makes bullying seem as easy to stop as having a fortunate celebrity pop in or trying to look for the positives. The movie also makes a message at the end of saying you can stop bullying by claiming Cool Cat is your friend, but think about it: in a real-life scenario where you claim that Cool Cat will save you, you're going to get made fun of or beaten up. Kids can't indulge in their fantasies forever, and I believe Derek Savage might still have sentiments for his created imaginary character, hence why there are elements in this film that idolize Cool Cat as such. It's incorrect and wrong to depict anti-bullying this way because it makes it seem so simplistic. There are plenty of cases where the best thing to do would be to go to an adult and work out problems, but Cool Cat shoulders his own problems amongst his friends and in his dreams. The two cases where seeking an adult out are appropriate, but neither of them are carried out by Cool Cat, himself.

There is a surreal chapter of the movie involving gun safety. The threat happens when Cool Cat and company are looking for treasure in their backyard when they stumble across a gun. Everything else aside, why was there a gun in Daddy Derek's backyard? And if it was a threat, we are to assume it was loaded. Okay, why was there a LOADED gun in Daddy Derek's backyard? This question is never answered, and I'm only assuming it's Daddy Derek's backyard because otherwise this movie would be encouraging kids to stroll onto neighbors' private property to steal their ""treasure."" After discovering the gun, the kids do the smart thing and hurry to tell an adult, also pointing out that reaching out to an adult in the midst of possible violence is not snitching. That's a fair point to make, so I'll give the movie that.

However, later in, Butch takes the gun, and Daddy Derek goes out of his way to contact Butch's father. I don't understand this. If everyone knows that Butch is such a bully, why hasn't Daddy Derek confronted Butch's father on the matter before it escalated to this? I guess it doesn't matter because while Butch's father, James, I think it was, says that he'll look into the gun that Butch stole, we never hear from him again. Either the plot point was dropped, or this could be an insight into how parents of bullies are negligent and ignorant. But from the rest of the movie, I think it's safe to say that the plot point was dropped.

By the end of this movie, we don't get any redeeming results. The other ""bully"" character comes back to apologize, but we never see what really happens to Butch. Sure, we know he gets detained and arrested, but has he learned his lesson? It seems like a big deal to get arrested twice in a row and not think about turning over a new leaf. I wish Derek put some time into that to show that you shouldn't always wait for bullying to escalate to gun violence and getting arrested in order to obliterate the threat of a bully. There are several other ways to solve bullying, and there are different angles as to why people are bullies. Never did the movie address why Butch was a bully other than simply enjoying the torment he causes on others. *Sigh* Maybe I'm looking too into this.

There's also a meta section of the movie where Cool Cat is writing a story about Trolly the Trout, another character Derek created, but the frustrating and unrealistic part about this scene is that Cool Cat wins the contest effortlessly with a cheap story that a 4 year old could write. To sum it up, Trolly the Trout swims upstream and makes a friend. And he keeps swimming and makes more friends. The End. And he wins $100. Heck, if that's all it took, I'm sure we'd have a lot more blooming amateur writers in today's society.

Also, Cool Cat becomes school president, but we never saw his classmates vote for him or have a reason to vote for him. If you're going to be school president, give me some reasons as to why I should vote for you. From what I got in the campaign posters, all I know is that I should vote for Cool Cat. But why? Is it because you're cool? Because you're not, Cool Cat.

Lastly, there were the plug-ins they used to try to sell the movie. There were two starring actors that show up for one scene, but it's clear that they're not taking anything too seriously. Erik Estrada seems like he's high during the entire thing. At the closing message, he goes on to say something like, ""It's so uncool to be a bully,"" but he practically slurs his lines to where I can't help but think he's drunk or high on something. I wish I was, too.

And then the parade. It was a painful sloppy mess of the icing on the urinal cake. I'd be happy, too, if my character was featured in the local parade, but it was so pathetic and sad. There was a small crowd catering to Cool Cat, and his vehicle used in the parade was so uninteresting compared to the floats. There was a constant stock sound effect playing over background of ill-fitted music, and I have to imagine the cheering was way softer when Cool Cat strolled down the red carpet. I honestly wonder if the man in the suit likes his job or not because half the time when he's not actually doing anything, he looks like he wants to shoot himself in the foot.

There are SO many other things I didn't mention, but all in all, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. It's not even great to listen to as background noise like with some other bad movies because of Cool Cat's voice and the parade scene with the screaming. Derek Savage is equally bad to listen to with his weird accent and pop-ins of ""Well, hey/ Wahay."" Derek may have been in Playgirl magazine for his looks, but his acting makes it seem like someone dropped him on the head when he was a baby--multiple times.

The plot is terrible, the messages are shallow and over-simplified, the acting is nonexistent, the cinematography is worse than some homemade video projects, and the overall feel of the movie makes me uncomfortable. Just don't buy this. Don't. After what I've read about the director and his involvement with people criticizing his movie, it's not worth it to support his future projects. His childish demeanor and sentimental attachment to his childhood fantasies gets in the way of any creative aspect he might genuinely have. I believe he even goes out of his way in his autobiography to mention that he's single. So he doesn't have kids. Good riddance, someone like him doesn't deserve to breed, anyway.",1476057600,,13051,4.568376068376068

Also, Derek Savage, the guy who made this pile of dung about the evils of cyber bullying has been exposed as a huge cyberbully himself via youtube.  He even impersonated a law firm threatening to sue a youtube channel for giving this awful movie a bad review.  On top of all that he made his own response video to ""haters"" in a very aggressive and threatening tone.  It's all still easily accessed, simply search youtube for ""derek savage"".  He lashed out in an extremely childish way simply because people reviewed his movie as a pile of garbage.

There is little anybody can say about Savage's directing because it leaves all in such a state of pure astonishment that they are left dumbstruck.

I strive to be as cool as Cool Cat in my crusade to wipe out bullies from the face of this earth.

Seriously, though, screw this movie. I really want to believe this was clever satire. No one could truly and genuinely want to make a movie this bad, with sloppy editing, subpar acting, cringeworthy, unrealistic dialogue, and overall abysmal execution. Targeting kids as the audience still does not excuse this movie's poor quality and lack of real substance. Cool Cat Saves the Kids absolutely fails at portraying the complexities and nuances of bullying and being bullied. Often times, kids would be both victims and bullies (I would know, because I used to be one of them, unfortunately). The world's not so black and white. Cool Cat Saves the Kids's portrayal of the world as such is insipid, naive, and borderline insulting. Cool Cat sets a very poor example for kids in the movie itself, and even more so when you consider that the creator, Derek Savage, blew up on YouTubers roasting his movie, and went on a copyright abuse spree, becoming a harassing cyberbully himself. Oh, the hypocrisy and irony. Avoid at all costs, unless to watch the hilarious YouTube reviews if you want a good laugh.

The audio is a bit messed up in some places, the movie feels long when in reality it's only 75 minutes (15 minutes less than the average movie), the editing is weird, and the dialogue is often strange (especially with how dated some of the lines are...""Groovy!"" hasn't been said seriously in at least 20 years, and there's plenty more strange lines like ""Exquisite!"" and ""Identify yourself!""). Some of the morals are either bad or told badly so they become worthless in teaching kids things (yelling at bullies to quit bullying them and that ""they're friends with Cool Cat"" would likely increase the bullying. It's sad and shouldn't be true but it is the likely reality). The characters are mostly awkward and weird in how they act (Butch the Bully, his lackeys, and Vivica are the only ones that actually bring life to their characters). The songs are mostly terrible (the green screen one, after it gets past the intro with Cool Cat rapping, is actually done rather well), the story is VERY loosely put together from three of Cool Cat's adventures from his books and has stupid scenes like the Hollywood parade scene (that should be under the ""extras"" portion of the DVD, if the DVD had an ""extras"" section).

There's plenty more but you get the point. The sound and editing and visuals and such are somewhat excusable due to this not being as big of a budget but a bad script is not as even a penniless person could write a great script with enough help and inspiration. Overall this film is great to laugh at but not for much else. I'd give it two stars, especially since the package came a day earlier than expected, but due to the movies high score currently (3.1) and the whole ""Derek Savage v.s. I Hate Everything"" debacle, I'll mark it as a one star (which isn't to harsh based on how terrible the actual movie is...even a terrible movie like Batman & Robin had a coherent plot that made sense. Granted, Mr. Freeze and Poison Ivy teaming up doesn't make sense, but the rest of the general plot seemed to work).

The part that really spoke to me, if I had to choose just one (because there were so, so many parts that clicked with me), it would be Cool Cat's lofty insight into art critique and the philosophy into what makes something beautiful, as demonstrated when he writes his novel, Trolly the Trout. My only complaint is that the run time was not any longer than it was, even though I was surprised how many big, thought-challenging ideas they incorporated into the production of this film. Many will say this is a good kid's movie, but I humbly disagree - this movie is one of the best movies I've seen for anyone, be it adult or child, young or old. The messages of human empathy, what it means to exist, metaphysical realities extending far beyond our own, and how communities gather around important pieces of art to appreciate what it has to offer in all respects.

Dear Derek Savage,

Im sure you had good intentions for making this film and I commend you for that. However, there are dire issues with your film. I repeat, dire.

Below is a list of the many discrepancies you neglected to address. Though, bear in mind that this is not all of them.

Item, Kids don't care about having corner offices.
Item, My belly feels great! What the crap?
Item, By the way, its ""Dreamland"" or ""Dream Land.
Item, The dialogue pops on more than one occasion.
Item, Kids don't care about Alice Cooper.
Item, Kids don't care about Van Halen.
Item, Quit living in the 80s.
Item, Go buy some new jeans. And tennis shoes do not compliment blue jeans. Please understand this.
Item, Green screen room being shown ruins the magic. Also, Cool Cat has a green discoloration for all green screen scenes.
Item, All these cars from 80s TV shows WILL GO RIGHT OVER THESE KIDS HEADS.
Item, So, is Cool Cat a bro or is he your son? Make a decision in your script.
Item, Convince him to stop bullying. In a personal sense or general sense. The way you word it makes it seem like the good guys are, in fact, bullies.
Item, So the kid, Cool Cat, gets the master bedroom and bath then?
Item, Cool Cat draws attention to his nether regions in this, more than once.
Item, Cool Cat didn't look both ways before crossing the street, after giving that same advice to his friends. Terrible!

You know what? Just scrap everything. Just get rid of it all.

Sincerely,

A concerned viewer

i don't know if any of you are horror fans, but there is a very widely known movie known as the ring or ringu.
if you're not familiar with this film, please search the premise on imdb, i will summarize it here:
there is a tape that exists which kills its watcher seven days after they watch it.
i have reason to believe that this is that tape.
after trying to watch this film with my girlfriend, i turned it off after 5 minutes
she, however, watched the entire thing
she messaged me, distressed and afraid that night, saying that she had received a threatening phone call.
the person on the other end, as in the ringu series, said simply, ""seven days""
as the movie foretold, a week later, she died. her autopsy proved no discernible cause of death.
after this, i sent an email to derek savage on the matter. he replied a day later.
""do not look into this matter any further. or you will be next.""
i am afraid.

no but seriously, please, for the love of god, do not buy this film
as a proclaimed lover of s****y movies, me and a friend could not bear to make it through more than 20 minutes of this film.
in the past, we have watched all of foodfight, the room, birdemic, and other notoriously awful films.

I can't say I would recommend it if you're trying to teach your kids about bullying / gun safety BUT I myself love bad movies and this is all I could of asked for.

Here's the ""plot"":

Cool Cat is a super cool furry whose best friends with this random kid named Maria, who is helping him make signs for his class president campaign. While they're working this kid with a speech impediment named Butch sees them and decides to send them mean texts. Anyway, Daddy Derek is married to a furry named Momma Cat and he has to go to Hollywood for ?? some reason. Cool Cat joins the parade!! But first he has to perform two horrible songs (and check his emails only to get cyber bullied again) Then there's a writing contest and Cool Cat writes the beloved classic ""Trolly the Trout"". But soon there's trouble in paradise!! Butch is stealing candy!!

As soon as that problem is solved, Maria, Cool Cat and some random neighborhood boy decide to dig up stuff and they find a gun! Oh no! Butch sees the gun and takes it. But don't worry, Cool Cat saves the day, wins the writing competition and becomes class president!!

Some other stuff happens too but you need to see it to believe it.

Highlights: Daddy Derek flirting creepily with Momma Cat and the cop who arrests Butch the Bully is apparently a famous porn star.",1451779200,3,1589,4.503472222222222

The comic sans should have been the warning, I ignored those small warnings, and decided to press on. To say cool cat is creepy would be a large understatement; those blank, lifeless eyes give Lady X a run for her money. He has no eyelids, and just blankly stares at everyone with that blank, expressionless face. Maybe it's just me, but as the movie went on, I couldn't see Cool Cat as anything less than a child predator, and potential serial killer. They creepy undertones in every interaction he has with children is nothing short of messed up.
 I didn't realize how far I had gotten into this nightmare, until the scene where Cool Cat replies to online bullying (which is the wrong message to give to children, but moving on...), and then the guy in the suit decides to take a plethora of drugs before filming, seeing as how Cool Cat is spazzing out on his bed, still with his eyes wide open, and having a bad reaction in the closet. Any chances of redeeming this mess were killed off in that one segment. From this point on, it would turn into ""Dalmations 3"" cringe territory.

6991555,3,B00SLXRAGA,"I first heard of this movie from two YouTube movie review channels, and I had to see it for myself.

If you are looking for a ""So bad it's good"" movie for a ""bad movie night"" with a few friends, then definitely buy this; you won't be disappointed. If you're a parent, and are looking for something to teach your kids about bullying, then I suggest you give this one a miss. The advice given in this movie is awful at best, and harmful at worst.

Examples of this would include a scene with Cool Cat and a young girl, where she receives a text message from a bully. Cool Cat's advice when the young girl asks if she should open a text from a number she doesn't recognise (the bully) is: ""Sure! Who knows, you might have won a prize or something!"" (I'm paraphrasing, but you get the idea). When she receives a second text from the same number, Cool Cat's advice is to ""[open it], as maybe [the bully] feels bad about what he said and wants to apologize"". When Cool Cat receives an email from a bully, he replies with ""Maybe if you were nicer, then you would have more friends, and friends are cool!"".

Later on in the movie (which, by the way, is a series of short movies stitched loosely into one movie), Cool Cat is talking about the importance of always looking both ways when crossing the street. Which is definitely a good thing to teach kids, I'll give them that. Cool Cat, however, promptly ignores the advice only minutes later, when he runs across the street without looking at all.

The movie wraps up with Cool Cat rather abruptly stating that the correct way to deal with cyber-bullying is to ignore any bullying messages that come through. This is contrary to what is shown in the rest of the movie.

I can see that the creator, Derek Savage, definitely had good intentions when making this movie, and I do believe that he genuinely wants to help people. This has been marred, however, by his recent attitude towards negative reviews, demanding that they all be removed from YouTube, and threatening to sue the people responsible.

In conclusion, if you are a fan of things like ""Birdemic"" or ""The Room"", then this is a great movie to watch, and you'll definitely have a good few laughs while watching it. This aspect of the movie is the sole basis for my three star rating. I would not recommend this for parents to show their kids for educational purposes.",1448668800,5,2369,4.472222222222222

6991576,1,B00SLXRAGA,"This movie is riding a high star rating solely based on an ironic cult following it received after YourMovieSucksDOTorg reviewed it. At the time he made that review, it seemed Derek Savage, the writer, director, producer and an actor in this movie, might be a good guy who had good intentions, but just had horrible execution. It was assumed he was taking the negative reviews in stride.

But now Derek Savage has become a cyberbully himself attacking critics who leave negative reviews of Cool Cat Saves the Kids on Youtube, using false copyright claims to have them removed. So it's time real reviews, instead of the mocking 5 star reviews, come out.

Cool Cat Saves the Kids offers a few snippets of good advice here and there, such as looking both ways before crossing the street, finding an adult if you see a gun left laying somewhere it shouldn't be, not responding to cyberbullies, and standing up to real life bullies.

The real problem is the fact that whatever the movie says to do, it then shows Cool Cat doing the exact opposite of - and with stellar results making it appear what he did was the right choice. For example, minutes after having a whole scene about looking both ways before crossing the street, Cool Cat races out into traffic without looking both ways just so he can chase down a child and have that child arrested. In another scene, Cool Cat responds to online trolling and cyberbullying by telling the person they should be nicer so they'll have more friends, and friends are cooooo-ool! We all know the rule is 'don't feed the troll', but nothing negative comes from this interaction and Cool Cat forgets all about it until the very, very end of the movie (over half an hour later) when he, for no apparent reason, announces the only way to handle cyberbullies is to just ignore them.

The movie also has an extended scene of creator self-adulation where Cool Cat goes to Hollywood to be in a parade. He spends about 15 minutes pointing at old cars in Hollywood that most 25 year old adults won't recognize/care about, let alone the intended audience of under-10s.

And the production values? Comic sans font on scene transitions - except for one transition that managed to get a normal font - rather ugly and even frightening imagery of a sun and moon rising/setting to show day's changing, excessive use of day changes (day seems to be about 10 minutes long in this world) and all sorts of issues with sound - from muffled, incoherent dialogue to mics getting slapped repeatedly mid-scene to music sounding like it's recorded underwater.

The whole movie is the fevered dream of a self-aggrandizing writer/director/producer who doesn't actually understand children at all and just thinks he can capitalize on this niche because he saw a few children's safety classes and happens to have a furry, orange catsuit in the basement. Kids dig 6' tall men in furry, orange catsuits, right?! (And he only has one; Mama Cat is the same suit with some fake lips and a dress added).",1447372800,108,3005,4.7251908396946565

I also used some markers. Then I went out to find some kids to save, but lost my grip on reality. I thought I was the angel of vengeance, and it was time to purge the heretics. Long story short, two days later I woke up in a gutter next to an empty bottle of gin and a tattered mariachi hat. I feel like I made a difference. 5 stars.

8698870,5,B00SLXRAGA,"Possibly the greatest movie to grace my eyes, Derek ""Pu**y Spank"" Savage comes out with ""Cool Cat Saves The Kids"" after writing the critically acclaimed manga series of the same name.
There is some continuity between the books and this movie ""ie. Cool Cat had a father who died in the 2nd Vietnam war"" that you'll miss if you do not read the books so I'd highly suggest you read all of the previous books so you don't get lost.

8698873,1,B00SLXRAGA,"Some reviews say this movie is terrible. They are correct. Some reviews say it's hilarious. They are also correct.

It's a vanity project born of someone with a curious amount of money to throw at absurd children's educational entertainment, like if Tommy Wiseau tried to make a Sesame Street ripoff. Do not buy it for educational value. There are several instances where a lesson is taught such as ""look both ways before you cross the street"", immediately before the de facto exemplar for good-child behavior, Cool Cat, charges into the street without consequences. It seems to carry the message of, bullies are simply born into being friendless losers, and must be quarantined from society. At one point, Cool Cat himself states the only reason not to answer bullying with violence is it will get you into trouble. It's also full of shameless self promotion, both in the form of Cool Cat wearing shirts advertising the book series this spawned from, to director/writer/father of Cool Cat, ""Daddy"" Derek Savage having a scene that revolves around showing off an expensive collectible guitar he owns in real life.

Should you buy it just to entertain children? Probably not. If it becomes their favorite movie, Cool Cat's is not a voice you want to hear coming from your living room twice a week.

Now, should you buy it to entertain your adult hipster friends. That's why I bought it, direct from Daddy Derek's website. Honestly, I enjoyed this movie. So many things are done so wrong. Every scene seems to raise new questions about what Derek Savage did with a giant bipedal cat woman to produce a giant bipedal cat boy. How old is Cool Cat? The plot makes far more sense if you imagine Butch the Bully is not an angry, misunderstood child, but is instead some kind of supernatural creature; the Bully, mankind's natural enemy. At one point he simply yells, ""I love being a bully!"" And will the music videos ever end?

If you enjoy other terrible movies, it's honestly a pretty good time. But the director/writer isn't someone you should give your money to. He disseminates horrible lessons to children, has a history of illegally harassing people who make fun of his movie, and when despite knowing this I bought his movie with the promise of a Cool Cat poster to hang on my wall with my other horrible hipster garbage, it was shipped without one. My attempts to contact Daddy Derek, or whoever manages his website, have been met with silence for over a month.

So. In a nutshell, hilariously bad movie, don't buy it for kids, if you're the sort of person who boycotts things for sport, you might want to know who you'd be giving your money to.",1511740800,4,2647,4.733188720173536
8698874,2,B00SLXRAGA,"I bought this DVD because I find this movie hilarious. Cool Cat is basically ""The Room"" of kids movies. But when I got a DVD copy off of Amazon, it was edited unlike the Digital Copy.

The edits we're small but very noticeable compared to the digital version. But it still made me mad. Scenes edited out included Cool Cat making a creepy hand motion while laying down. They also added a scene where Butch the Bully is Jealous of Cool Cat being in the parade.

 Also, this movie was made by a man who bullied those who dared to review his movie(Most Notably IHE and Bobsheaux).",1511049600,,576,4.364485981308412
