1817593,5,B00007JZYH,"Henry Fonda, Yul Brenner...fantastic portrayals of shadow warriers of the Rodina and their adversary, the United States. There was a deadly chess game during the 60's and 70's depicted in this classic film. The Soviet Razvedka had penetrated U. S. and British counter espionage services as well as ALL levels of our governments. During WW II the British Security Coordination Service ran agents from Rockefeller Centre in NY using Venona and Bride intercepts of KGB and GRU intrigue in Mexico City where the Nazis and the Mexican PRI worked in complete unison against their glavni vrag-America. These partnerships continued against us through this film's depiction of events in the 1960's. The FBI was defenseless against the skilled spies of the USSR.This film does depict the treachery of Kim Philby, et al in British Intelligence at the time. I think the giddy Joseph McCarthy was right all along!!!",1389398400,5,902,5.142857142857143
1817594,3,B00007JZYH,"My high school French wasn't up to the translation task, but fortunately almost all of Yul Brynner and Henry Fonda's scenes were in English, as we a few other crucial scenes to keep the English-speaking viewer from becoming totally lost. The acting was sufficiently expressive that it also helped in spite of the language barrier. Virna Lisi does a marvelous brief scene that completely catches the masculine sex appeal of stars like Yul Brynner! Brynner's performance is excellent - I believed him even if Henry Fonda didn't. I gave it 3 stars because so much of it isn't in English, but I might watch it again so maybe I should have gone with 4. If you are a Yul Brynner fan, I think you will enjoy this one. If you understand multiple languages, I am sure you will enjoy it.",1362614400,4,777,4.557142857142857
1817595,2,B00007JZYH,"Although attractively priced and featuring excellent image quality, this is a strange choice for domestic release. It's essentially the French-language version of Henri Verneuil's ""Le Serpent"" and NOT, as the packaging implies, ""Night Flight from Moscow,"" the version marketed to English-speaking countries. Most of the movie is in French, with the scenes featuring Henry Fonda, Dirk Bogarde and Yul Brynner mostly in English. Except sometimes not. (Russian- and German-language dialogues add to the linguistic mishmash.) If you have VHS copies of ""Night Flight from Moscow,"" you'd best hang onto them.

This is the kind of studio-bound spy movie one euphemistically describes as ""Gallic"": two gunshots, one car crash and miles of polite conversation. The villain's identity is painfully obvious to everyone except the other characters. As ""Le Serpent,"" its focus is mainly upon Philippe Noiret as a French intelligence officer framed as a Soviet mole; there's not much for the ever-fine Noiret to play, but his sympathetic, hangdog expression does much of the work for him. In this cut, one also gets quite a bit more of Michel Bouquet as an Inspector Javert-like inquisitor tasked with ferreting out double agents. The impeccably naturalistic Fonda (whose princely walk is one of the movie's rare visual moments of style) and a grumpy-looking Brynner are so reduced in prominence as to be ""guest stars,"" but Bogarde's sardonic presence and unique manner suffer relatively little from the Francophilic editing. The biggest losers are actors like Farley Granger and Robert Alda, whose lines are simply overriden *en Franais* by an officious narrator.

Although Verneuil was sufficiently well-regarded in his day to attract the attention of American studios, he is not nearly as good at cloak-and-dagger fare as his contemporary, Jean-Pierre Melville. The latter's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Army-of-Shadows-The-Criterion-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B0047P5FSQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Army of Shadows (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray</a>] will always be an espionage classic. ""Le Serpent"" is, alas, a curate's egg that will be of interest only to fans of its international gaggle of stars. As Bogarde wrote to a friend, it wasn't a film, ""it was bread.""

UPDATE: If you activate the English-language subtitles via the ""Subtitle"" button on your DVD remote, instead of going through the DVD menu itself, much of the French-language overdubbing is removed. Supplements include four alternate-language scenes, one with Virna Lisi. Another is the final Bogarde-Noiret confrontation. In the latter, Bogarde delivers his French-language dialogue with such flair that it's mystifying that he was (poorly) overdubbed elsewhere in the picture. Playback in HDTV exposes digital artifacts and damage to the print that might escape notice on a standard TV.",1348444800,7,3185,6.057649667405765
1817596,3,B00007JZYH,I must say that I bought this movie  because Yul Brynner was in it.  In those scenes that he is in he is great but over all I think that the  producer  used the  three big stars to draw people in .  The script is weak and the movie could have been a lot better.,1322438400,,261,3.6545454545454548
1817597,4,B00007JZYH,"Those who complained that the movie is in French most likely never finished watching it. Ture there are conversations (<15%) that are in French, Russian or German, but you can simply set the subtitle and audio in English.

Excellent spy movie. Very well made.",1306368000,5,259,4.886363636363637
1817598,3,B00007JZYH,"The director could not make up his mind whether to make this movie like a feature film or a documentary; it switches back and forth and leaves one off balanced. The basic plot is that a Russian spy defects with the names of various Soviet moles in NATO. The question is whether he is lying or is he telling the truth. Then the whole focus changes to France, Germany and Britain and those men that have been mentioned by the defector. There are some boring parts, like when the film is being narrated as a documentary about the CIA, yet there are arresting scenes when the film begins to be like a feature film (I am deliberately not being specific in order not to spoil those scenes for the viewer).",1304640000,5,699,4.384615384615385
1817599,1,B00007JZYH,"Even if you select ""English"" for the voice track, the movie is 80% in FRENCH with English subtitles.  Neither Yul Brynner nor Henry Fonda is the leading actor, as one might expect, but rather the actor most prominently appearing in the movie is a French Secret Service man played by Philippe Noiret.  What English is not in subtitles, is dubbed in.  This is a very poorly produced movie, made for a French audience, with only token support for English speakers, as you can expect from the French snobs.",1242864000,5,502,4.681818181818182
1817600,4,B00007JZYH,"This is almost like a documentary in telling the story of the CIA taking a Russian defector to safety back in the 60s. It gives a good background on what the spy game was like then and an in depth look at the workings of the CIA at the time. This is not nail-biting action, but a good overall look at the spy business in a more intellectual study. I recommend it to those that enjoy spy novels the most and I think that even those that enjoy the James Bond action movies may find it interesting. Great performances by Yul Brynner and Henry Fonda.",1173830400,24,546,4.20952380952381

7977342,4,B00007JZYH,"Great Movie,based on fact,terrific acting,and the only reason I give it four stars and not five is because of the quirkiness of the French Director,who insisted for accuracy's sake,on some of the dialogue being spoken in French and Russian,in addition to English. I appreciate his concern for maximum integrity,but it does little for the viewer,and probably accounts for the reason why this film has become something of a forgotten gem.
For whatever reason,the film is also available with an alternative French title,""Le Serpent""but don't be fooled,its the same film,and it has the same problem in terms of some tri-lingual dialogue",1492732800,,632,5.33
