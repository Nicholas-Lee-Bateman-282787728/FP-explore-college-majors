Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Nakadai fan, and I have nothing to say to detract from the Kobayashi film, but this was definitely worth two hours and a few minutes for me. Maybe you too, if you are a fan of the genre.

It is dark, it is sad, it is torture, but the big fight at the end is worthy. Big-time.

Thanx Miike, you've delivered another masterpiece of beautifully filmed anguish.",1343347200,2,607,4.260869565217392
