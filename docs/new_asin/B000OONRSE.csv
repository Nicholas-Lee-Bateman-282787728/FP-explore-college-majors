8185863,2,B000OONRSE,"Actually I've met the Author Mrs. Stockwell and she certainly knows the in and outs of hypnosis. I was disappointed in the run around she never quite gets to when it comes to actually describing the ""Doing"" of hynosis, the techniques are vague. I would not recommend anything of Stockwell, if you want to learn the ""Doing"" aspect of hypnosis.",1257638400,2,342,4.716666666666667
8185864,2,B000OONRSE,"Being a healer and spiritual adviser for the past few years I was looking forward to gaining some new insight into hypnotherapy.  Maybe even pulling out some techniques that could enhance my own practice.

Unfortunately this video failed to deliver on this.  The video is primarily a few taped conversations with some hypnotherapist regarding their craft.  The production is poor, equivalent to public broadcasting in the 80's.  A couple of the interviews were hard to understand when the interviewing person asked questions seemingly far away from the microphone.  There were also headers between scenes that said ""STEP by STEP guide"".... I can tell you their were no ""STEPS"" to be taken away from this at all.

On a positive note, the therapists seemed well educated and knowledgeable about their field, which at least gives you a professional aspect to what they are discussing.

This video states in its description that it ""offers a demystifying introduction to hypnotherapy"".  I guess it does this, however I think for $30 you would expect much more.  Respectfully I have to not recommend this video. If you must see it, maybe a trip to the library or netflix may be in order first.
