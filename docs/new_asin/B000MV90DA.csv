2750274,5,B000MV90DA,There are so many things today which can cause us to miss church on sundays. So believer or not education on Biblical historical figures is a good thing. Joan of Arc with Ingrid Bergmen is as good as it gets. The kids will be entertained and so will you.,1351987200,4,254,4.204081632653061
2750275,5,B000MV90DA,"If you belive in God (Jesus), faith, love, saints, freedom. this movie is a true story and a true message for everyone to watch. Increible movie, top performance by the main character, and best the message this movie bring to the audience. I loved this movie and will watch it many times. - The meaning of love is only the begining -",1320019200,5,333,4.387096774193548
2750276,2,B000MV90DA,"Unfortunately, this version has subtitles that you cannot eliminate.  You MUST see the subtitles in either English, or two versions of Chinese.
All subtitles appearing on the screen are very distracting while trying to watch the movie.",1299628800,10,235,5.351351351351352

I can play it on my laptop, but not on the desk top computer!  Please help me out",1298073600,,154,3.78125
2750278,5,B000MV90DA,"Captivating from the opening through the end, even if the story is well known.  Seeing certain versions of movies are better than others.  This is one of the best.  Subtleties are more obvious the older I get and see the politics of her efforts.  Remember, this was a very young girl, not a woman yet to us these days, that gained the favor of a country and an army.  Difficult for anyone to do these days.",1296345600,5,406,4.2894736842105265
2750279,5,B000MV90DA,"This movie is a ""classic"" about Joan of Arc.  It is not my favorite but was well done for the time.  My favorite is by far the French movie, ""Joan The Maid - The Battles / The Prisons"".  I write this short review only to give this movie more than "" 3 "" stars that a customer gave it because ""the shipper was slow to ship"" - NOT a reason to give the ""movie"" only 3 stars.",1290556800,6,370,3.779220779220779
2750280,3,B000MV90DA,"I complained about not receiving my movie and it came in the mail today. It was way longer to arrive than it should have been. Maybe it got lost in the mail or something. It does not take over a month to receive DVD's in the mail. Never the less I have received my copy and I will review it as soon as possible
  Thank You

8172778,5,B000MV90DA,"This movie is a classic !  Since copies are now selling at impossibly high prices, I decided to try this subtitled version which was available at such a reasonable price.  I am so glad I did.  Some people have found the sub-titles irritating, but I am just so happy to be able to watch this wonderful film that it seems a  small inconvenience.  (The English sub-titles were obviously translated by a non-English speaking person and are actually a bit humorous at times..just to say.)  Although there have been more recent film versions of Joan of Arc, this to me remains the absolute classic,best !",1429747200,2,598,4.701923076923077

8172781,1,B000MV90DA,Very far from historical truth.  Joan of Arc is portrayed as a saint with visions.  She does not act like a commander.,1414800000,,118,4.318181818181818

Ten star, unfortunately, we all know what happens to Joan in the end, but even with that, and the music behind it, we all know she saw Jesus.  It was beautiful.  Love it!!!!!
