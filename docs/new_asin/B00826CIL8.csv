It was a good DVD and I actually love these kinds of Japanese movies, so I would have given it a five star, but you need a 3D TV to watch it on!

I have to go to a friend's house, who has a 3D TV, every time I want to watch it. It isn't that piratical in the long run.

I give a 3 Star, only because you have to watch it on a 3D TV.

Note that I didn't buy this from Amazon, but somewhere else, yet I am going to buy it again here at Amazon, because my friend with the 3D TV hasn't given my copy back -,__-",1350950400,,549,3.520661157024793
