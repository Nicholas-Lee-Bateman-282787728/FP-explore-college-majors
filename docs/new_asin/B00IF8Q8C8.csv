6263478,3,B00IF8Q8C8,"By adequate, I mean not inadequate and by staple, I mean not novel. It doesn't try to break new ground. Its got a real retro flair. The setting is contained,  split between a college dorm and on campus, there's an old  asylum, (just a building; not operational anymore). The asylum is a little creepy and generates some atmosphere. The protagonists are likeable enough and the main antagonist is the best character, though an over the top one. After all, he's in an insane asylum. Too little is made of him, imo. He is most effective when in his own skin, as opposed to possessing/impersonating other people. The film started off as a 4 but then it got weighed down in the middle, where it went on for too long. The ending picked up but not enough to boost it back up to a 4 experience, so it remains a 3. I watched it while doing things on a rainy evening, and it fit the bill for that, especially given the lack of alternatives. The production values are decent. Its not one of those shot like a soap opera. Compared to lots of other ones on here, its a 'real' movie.",1400889600,2,1069,4.34
6263479,3,B00IF8Q8C8,"This offering from Anchor Bay studios fits into the ""teenage ghost story"" category.  I gave it 3 stars because it was a good effort trying to tell a story that would have been better suited for heavy CGI effects.  Instead of depending on cheap thrills and over-the-top special effects, HOUSE OF DUST offers a fluid story that feels more like a mystery than a traditional horror or thriller.

The best aspect of the film was the acting.  The cast did a wonderful job transitioning their characters on screen.  The transitions gave the impression that something was genuinely wrong and would continue to get worse.  It was this use of fine acting that created the atmosphere in which so many questions were formed.  I admit it was difficult to tell if this really was a ghost story or something of a psychological thriller.  Those questions weren't answered until the final sequences of the film.

As for the special effects, there was nothing really fantastic.  However, the filmmakers were smart to use just enough ""ghosts"" and sound effects to pique interest.  The plot of ghostly infestation and sub-plot of mental insanity were constantly fighting for supremacy.  It was that key point of the story that kept me watching until the very end.  The dialogue, in my opinion, was a little under par.  Some of it was bordering on cheesy but once again the actors and actresses managed to make even the worst lines sound natural to the character they were portraying.

The premise of the film has been done a dozen different ways but I think HOUSE OF DUST did an excellent job.  What it lacked in scares it made up for with good storytelling and convincing characters.  Worth a watch.",1400544000,3,1680,4.757785467128028
6263480,4,B00IF8Q8C8,"There are very few places as creepy to me as abandoned mental institutions and, as such, I find they are excellent locations for horror films.  I am a firm believer that many things happen behind closed doors that the public may or may not ever find out about; and what better place to perform illegal experimentation on human beings than mental institutions?  This is the premise for HOUSE OF DUST, an upcoming horror flick from Anchor Bay.  But don't let the mysterious title fool you; this is a haunting film that will make you squirm.

I love the title of this film because it fits on so many levels.  It is menacing and foreboding, but it also describes a bit about the filmin an indirect way.  Not to mention it sounds scary as hell.

HOUSE OF DUST is shot well and has a nice, dark overtone throughout the whole movie.  The production value looks high, although my sole complaint about how the film is made is the CG blood-splatter effect in the opening scene.  I think I would rather see nothing at all rather than see cheap digital effects; the results tend to take me out of the film.

Thankfully, that is my sole complaint about the film.  The concept is fairly unique, and the story moves at a steady pace.  I particularly like the ending; I will not say anything about it, so as to not ruin the surprise, but its definitely something I didn't see coming.

I am curious as to why HOUSE OF DUST is rated R, though.  I don't recall any major language (certainly nothing you wouldnt hear in a PG-13 film), and theres no gore or nudity to speak ofso maybe the horror elements are too intense.  Im not sure.

But HOUSE OF DUST is a definite winner for me, and I recommend giving it a look.  The film will hit store shelves next week, so make a note.",1399852800,10,1756,4.37037037037037
6263481,2,B00IF8Q8C8,"Warning: spoilers!

Underwhelming supernatural thriller about some college students who go into an abandoned mental hospital and end up getting possessed by the spirits of some disturbed patients who met violent deaths there.  House of Dust is handsomely filmed and has some creepy ghost effects, but the lazy script, uneven acting and penny-pinching production values tends to outweigh the movie's strong technical elements.

The problems begin with the opening scene set in the 1950's where a group of mental patients are lobotomized and then burned alive in a giant furnace.  Drills in the skull and people burned alive would normally be creepy, but when you combine them in a sequence that makes absolutely no logical sense then not so much.  There's some indication that the opening scene is meant to be a tall tale told by one of the characters, which might largely justify the ludicrousness of the whole thing, but since the character only has one very short voice-over line at the end of the sequence you never get a sense that anyone is telling the story.

When the heroine is introduced three different characters in two different dorm rooms remark that she's weird.  The problem?  At that point in the movie all she has done is look for her room--and she's dressed completely normally.  The movie wants to establish the fact that she's strange without doing any work whatsoever to create a character.

The abandoned asylum that the students visit is actually on the university campus.  What kind of university is going to allow a large, abandoned building in the middle of its grounds?  Wouldn't it be an eyesore and a negative when trying to lure students to the campus, not to mention a potential hazard since college students are very likely going to want to use the building to party?  Wouldn't the university re-purpose the building or tear it down rather than simply let it stand there boarded up?

There isn't any reason that the abandoned hospital had to be part of the campus other than sheer laziness on the part of the filmmakers.  The movie also shoots itself in the foot with unnecessary penny pinching moves--the entire university seems to have only ten students and all of them are taking the same Abnormal Psychology class.  The class itself doesn't even have a teacher--just a slide projector.  Hiring some extras to make the campus feel like an actual campus would have been an excellent idea.

To give you just one example of how terrible the writing is--during one admittedly amusing scene a normally mild-mannered and gentlemanly student is in the dorm room of three coeds when he is taken over by a spirit from the asylum.  He picks up a pair of panties, sniffs them and loudly says ""Oh, yeah.""  Not only are none of the girls creeped out by his behavior but they invite him to stay for shots.

When the characters aren't speaking and the visual effects are allowed to carry the movie House of Dust is a decent supernatural thriller--but the rest of the time it's very bad.",1399680000,4,3006,4.809338521400778
6263482,4,B00IF8Q8C8,Saw this in San Francisco as part of ANOTHER HOLE IN THE HEAD film festival. There is no reason why this film should be R-rated.

6263487,3,B00IF8Q8C8,"There has been a glut of horror films released over the past decade. It seems like everyone has realized that the lowest budgeted film that can be made is a horror film and that it makes for an easy entry into the world of film making. Coupled with a legion of horror fans who have adored so many films they want to emulate and you find an overabundance of horror movies coming out, most of them bad. So it's nice to see one every once in a while that might not have a big name starring in it and might use bits and pieces of other movies but that entertains at the same time. Movies like HOUSE OF DUST.

The movie focuses on a group of college students beginning a their year. New to the group is Emma, a young girl with some serious issues relating to her mental stability. Shy and withdrawn, Emma is egged on by her roommate Gabby to join in at the party some students are having that first night there. Gabby's boyfriend Dylan is on hand as well as his roommate, Kolt. Emma has caught Kolt's eye and he attempts to win her trust that night.

The group heads back to the dorm from the party and while walking across campus they go past a building covered in ivy and sealed to all students. The abandoned building was once and asylum that housed numerous patients including one notorious serial killer. While these students don't know it, in the opening sequence of the film we witnessed him killing some of the staff as well as his incineration in the oven in the basement. Seeing a building like this how can you expect kids not to try and break in? They do so, eventually finding the oven and accidentally knocking over a container of ashes. Guess whose ashes they were? Suddenly things begin to happen the kids.

Emma begins seeing things and worries that it is her mental problems come back to plague her. Students start to turn up murdered or missing. Kolt begins to change his behavior, becoming more anti-social and violent. With each passing day the hold that the spirit of the serial killer begins to take hold. Whether the kids in the film will survive or not is a toss up until the end. What's really nice here is that rather than do what's become far too typical in most horror films, leaving it open ended for a possible sequel, this one actually does offer a closing.

The scares here are not too intense and the acting is surprisingly well done by all involved. That is not to say that it's surprising because they don't possess any talent but surprising because it's rare to find someone with actual acting ability in most low budget horror films these days. While perhaps not Oscar worthy, each and every member does a believable job here.

While the die hard horror fans out there will probably not find this movie gory enough or will feel that it's been done before, it still offers a fairly fresh take on the subject matter while at the same time not portraying the kids involved as total idiots. I don't recall any scenes that had that ""look a trail of blood, let's separate and find out where the killer is"" moments. Instead we get a decent story, a few chills and enough horror for the non-fan to enjoy the movie.",1405382400,5,3139,4.423875432525952
6263488,2,B00IF8Q8C8,It's clear right off the bat who the final girl will be.  It's a movie about college teens that bust into this closed down mental hospital that's conveniently right on their college campus and accidently inhale some evil cremains.  Did I mention you know who the final girl will be.  Horrible acting by the final girl's romantic interest.,1404518400,,338,4.793103448275862
6263489,2,B00IF8Q8C8,"Could have been a better movie... but, it is slow building the story line, then drops you like a rock.
It does have its moments, but if you like your horror with some degree of being satisfied with the moments of the scare..
pass this one up, and wait till it is free. It will be a better movie knowing you did not have to pay for it!!",1402704000,,335,3.9411764705882355
6263490,3,B00IF8Q8C8,"The film opens with Lobotomy Asylum House of Horrors where a patient gets burned alive in the crematorium and ashes placed in a can on a shelf with a bunch of other people. This is followed by ""Inspired by true events.""

The film centers on a college (Eastern Connecticut State University) foursome. Dylan (Eddie Hassell) and Gabby (Holland Roden) are a couple. Dylan's roommate is Kolt (Steven Grayhm) a nice guy who goes commando (note shorts in opening shots) and doesn't drink. He sees new girl Emma (Inbar Lavi) who he takes an instant liking to, due to watching too much MTV. Emma takes meds and has cleavage of which we see very little of either.

Then to the shock and surprise of the viewing audience (plot spoiler) they go exploring said abandoned asylum against the direct orders of an overweight campus cop (Justin James Lang) driving a golf cart.. They make their way to the crematorium where they spill and inhale the dust of the house. (True Story: Canisters of remains were once found in an abandoned asylum.)

At this point the haunting thing begins.

The film was based on a good idea. I liked the plot. The cast lacked on screen chemistry. The horror factor was ineffective and the dialogue was bland. Character build up likewise was ineffective. Emma, the main character, we never got to know, even by the end of the film. Gabby gives us an explanation of what is going on with Emma about 40 minutes into the film, by which time you should have figured it out on your own.

Okay as a rental.

6263491,1,B00IF8Q8C8,"this flick started off promising, a bit of lame acting, but not quite as bad as some of the other even lower budgeted films lately. It mainly follows 4 college kids. One a dork who reminds me of that annoying oldest kid from Home Improvement, another a dork, then two chicks who walk around in their pajamas for most of the movie.

They venture into an old closed down mental hospital that just happens to still be right on campus, and unlocked. Not even a fence around it, not even barred or boarded up windows. I guess the dean just doesn't care if anyone goes in their or not, least not as much as tubby the security guard.

Anyway, you can guess they go in, and, well... ghosts attach themselves to them. Which beleive me, sounds more interesting in writing than it is to watch the film. When the kids try to go back to day to day life on campus, some weird things begin to happen until the end of the movie puts a gun to it's head and pulls the trigger.

Overall... like I said, it started off OK, but by the end of the thing, it goes way down hill, and you actually just don't care about any of these characters, you actually want to see them all be killed off. Which is why the film gets 1 star.",1401408000,,1202,4.172413793103448
