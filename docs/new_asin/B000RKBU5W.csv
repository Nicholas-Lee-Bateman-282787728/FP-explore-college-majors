2868636,5,B000RKBU5W,"I watched 'Life on Mars' when it first aired in the UK and was blown away. The casting is spot-on with earthy larger than life though believable characters. The scriptwriting is inspired, with pathos one moment, tension the next and a liberal smattering of humour and one-liners. The directing and editing are sublime, with the car-chases kept snappy and short, the eerie and slightly demonic 'Test Card Girl' directed to her chilling best and the emotional connections between the characters kept simmering all the way through. The best cut in the whole series, in my view, is the one where Sam tyler is knocked down by a speeding car in the first episode. Wonderful.

The US version is going to be awful, so get this original version!

Season Two is just as great...",1190937600,4,768,4.7669172932330826

2868638,5,B000RKBU5W,"The premise of Life On Mars sounds strange - a modern day cop has an accident and wakes up in 1973 - and it could have misfired very badly. It doesn't, though! John Simm is perfect as DI Sam Tyler, the modern cop who's suddenly policing a very different Manchester. He brings the right mix of vulnerability, confusion and depth to the character. Is he mad, in a coma, or has he gone back in time? he doesn't know, and neither do we.

Philip Glenister plays DCI Gene Hunt, Sam's new boss in 1973. He's crass, foul-mouthed, sexist, bigotted, and has an insult for everyone. He's also corrupt, but he's not the bad guy...everything is shades of grey.

Life On Mars is a fascinating show. On one level it's a cop drama, but there are a lot more levels underneath it. Add to that a fantastic soundtrack, and it's a show you will watch over and over again.",1187395200,35,850,4.3734177215189876
2868639,5,B000RKBU5W,"I have been watching this series for the past month and find it one of the best I have come across. The premise is You have a modern day cop, Sam Tyler, who after having an accident ends up in 1973. As he states in the opener, he is not sure if he is mad, in a coma, or back in time. The series would make you believe all three are the answer.

The gem here is Sam's interaction with DCI Gene Hunt as they come head to head over policing. Sam brings the modern analytical methods where as Gene bashes heads mainly and relies on his instincts. With a solid set of supporting characters the show has kept me well enteretained.

This DVD is the first of two seasons. The show is now continueing into a sequel called Ashes to Ashes, minus John Simm. And they are also in the works with an American version.

I would recommend this show anyone.",1185235200,21,839,4.166666666666667

2868641,5,B000RKBU5W,"There aren't many TV series I'll watch more than once. And even fewer I'll watch 2-3 times. Then there are those I come back to frequently, and this one -- the original UK version of ""Life on Mars"" -- is among the very rare that I've watched a dozen times or more.

I can't say exactly why the story struck me so, especially since there was a fair amount of 1970s British culture that I didn't get until I began looking it up. But there's enough familiar for even this Yank born in the 1960s to recognize and feel nostalgic about.

Plus there's the metaphysical angle, and the uncertainty as to exactly what's happened to Sam Tyler, especially since some of the events in Tyler's version of 1973 can't be entirely explained away as a dream. In fact, the Internet boards still debate whether the occasional anachronisms in Tyler's Manchester are entirely TV production accidents or if some were put in there on purpose (One I keep remembering is how Sam's wristwatch is a fancy analog and LCD model -- a watch that absolutely could not exist in '73.) The producers have been cagey about it.

Besides the show getting the period (almost) completely right, the actors are fantastic in their roles.

Anyway, it's a terrific show, and after watching it a bunch of times via Netflix rentals, I decided to get the blu-ray sets, both of the eight show seasons of Life on Mars...and I've watched them twice through each already. (Now I know the sequel series ""Ashes to Ashes"" wasn't quite as well received, in large part because they did away with a lot of the ambiguity, but I liked it anyway; I really wish the Beeb would allow that one out on something other than region-locked DVDs...)",1418515200,6,1680,4.59

2868646,5,B000RKBU5W,"It's taken me long enough, but I've finally gotten around to watching the show that people have been raving about for years: ""Life on Mars"", a police procedural with a twist: the protagonist is a contemporary investigator transported back in time. Beginning in 2006, Sam Tyler is a detached and efficient officer on the hunt for a serial killer when his girlfriend (and subordinate) goes missing during the investigation. In a bid to track her down, Sam is hit by a speeding car and wakes up in unfamiliar surroundings. It doesn't take long for him to ascertain that it's 1973, though how and why he's there remains a mystery. Is he in a coma? Has he travelled back in time? Is he just mad?

Stumbling back to his precinct to find it looking more like a dark and steamy gangster hideout than a police station, he immediately butts heads with his new Detective Chief Inspector, Gene Hunt, who naturally thinks the new recruit has a few screws missing. Thrown in the deep end and with no way to get home, Sam struggles to maintain his responsibilities as a police officer with hints (usually audial) that he's actually lying in a hospital bed in 2006.

Popular enough to warrant&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/a-spin-off/dp/B0041OJ9JY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">a spin-off</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/an-American-remake/dp/B001XRLWLU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">an American remake</a>, the show is a gem due to the fact it doesn't just ride on its ""fish out of water"" and time-travelling conceits. Along with the immersive recreation of life in the 70s and the underlying mystery of what's actually happening to Sam, each episode involves a case that takes a sharp look at issues such as police corruption or ""the ends justify the means"" mentality, blending them beautifully with the characterization, the time period and the overarching themes of the show. It's a winning concept.

Notably, Sam is determined to hold fast to his 21st century training, even in the face of his peers' contempt and bafflement. Appalled at the lack of organisation and corruption in the system, Sam insists on transparency, correct procedurals and institutional rights for prisoners, making him a thorn in the side of nearly every other officer on the job. It would have been easy to simply have Sam struggle with the rudimentary technology (no databases or cell-phones here!), but the writers are clever enough to use the unique scenario to craft several compelling moral situations. When a dangerous criminal is held without any evidence, is Sam right to release him? When a prisoner dies in police custody, should he investigate his co-workers or let sleeping dogs lie? And there is yet another layer to the proceedings, for Sam is not always in the right when it comes to imposing his values on the past. There are times when his tenacity takes things from bad to worse, and you end up wishing that on some occasions he would just go with the flow.

Then there's Gene Hunt. Violent, sexist, homophobic, foul-mouthed, corrupt - this is not an amusing ""politically incorrect"" figure played for a few naughty chuckles, but a man who genuinely crosses the line many times: scaring children, humiliating suspects, accepting bribes, tampering with evidence... He's a great character but a terrible person, and it comes as no surprise that Sam instantly butts heads with him. The two of them is what happens when an immovable object meets an unstoppable force, and since neither one are prepared to budge an inch, don't expect a light-hearted jokey bromance between these two.

And yet despite the fact that they're constantly at each other's throats, a semblance of equilibrium gradually emerges. They each have skills that the other one lacks, and figuring that out is the first step on the road to a decent partnership. One day at a time, Sam begins to adapt. Helping him along the way is his rapport with fellow policewoman Annie Cartwright, who provides a friendly face and a dash of cold water when she repeatedly reminds him that she's not a figment of his imagination (and who is quietly amazed at Sam's ability to treat her like a college instead of ""a skirt""). It turns out being stuck in the 70s has its perks, namely a chance for Sam to reconnect to his childhood: his mother, his neighbourhood, his memories - and of course the decade's greatest hits, which the show delights in belting out over various action sequences.

Still, questions remain. Why has Sam been brought back to 1973? What does he have to do in order to wake up? What's the deal with the strange visions he has of wandering through a forest and of a running woman in a red dress?

With only two seasons containing eight episodes each, another strength of the show lies in its tightness of structure and plotting. There is very little filler here, and what results is a story with a clear beginning, middle and end, not to mention a re-watchable quality. Watching for the second time around it became clear to me that Sam was frustrated by the red-tape and paper work that stymied his attempts to put a suspect behind bars, only for him to realize first-hand what it was like back in the days when such restrictions weren't in place.

Most television shows (or books, or films) get by on one really good idea: ""Life on Mars"" manages three: the 70s setting, the surreal mystery surrounding the circumstance of Sam's condition, and the keen eye that is fixed on social issues and the differences between past and present. There are so many nuances and character quirks that tie all these threads together, that I was left satisfied that the show lived up to its hype. Topped off with great performances by John Simm and Philip Glenister (the former keeping the surreal scenario grounded; the latter throwing all restraint to the wind) it all amounts to an excellent piece of television and an example of great storytelling.

The DVD is also a bonanza of extras, including the usual ""making of"" featurettes and blooper reels, but also an in-depth look at the show via interviews with the cast and crew, as well as a DVD commentary for each episode - something virtually unheard of in most DVD releases.",1387756800,3,6259,4.999040307101727
2868647,5,B000RKBU5W,This is probably one of my favorite shows of all time. The sequel Ashes to Ashes is a must have as well. Both have some of the best series endings ever.,1383177600,4,152,3.935483870967742
2868648,4,B000RKBU5W,"I enjoyed Life On Mars. It's not the best series for marathon viewing, as the episodes have a certain sameness to them, but it's enjoyable overall. I kind of wished there was a little more character development, though...Gene stays basically the same throughout, as do all the other characters. The ending (last episode of Series 2) could have been after any of these episodes and felt about the same. So, have fun, watch a few at a time and you'll like it, but don't enter in expecting anything too deep or meaningful.

Regarding some other reviews: there are indeed region codes with blu-ray: A, B and C. Way more blu-rays than DVDs are released unlocked and not region coded, but that seems to be locking down a bit...I've seen at least one UK blu-ray that started out region-free and then was re-released with a Region B coding. And Eureka's release of ""Touch Of Evil"" is only available as a Region B set, for instance.

As far as Life On Mars, the consensus online seems to be that the disks (at least the original release) are region free but that the extras were unviewable - often this happens with blu-ray out of region, as extras are usually in SD, and UK-formatted SD doesn't work on most US systems. But it *is* listed as a Region B in the Amazon description, so buyer beware (or do some more research on this specific title first).",1368576000,3,1344,4.549586776859504

Yes the DVD has region that is UK but BluRay does not. Maybe someday when there are Bluray recorders everywhere for $100 but unitl then no.  Region codes were made SIMPLY for COPYRIGHT/PIRATING purposing. its a lot easer to control several smaller crowds than one large crowd. Bluray technology was made with higher recording protection so they didn't bother and being a more expensive process would have been unprofitable to make in regions. With that being said, you can relax and now that buying this Bluray will be a rewarding experience if  you watched the USA version and likes it. you will LOVE this one, and though some of the stories are close they are not the same so its not like wathicng a remake although THIS is the original and USA managed to change the storyline to fit the more braindead USA crowd..sorry, im an American and American tv is tiring..always trying to teach new PC or telling a story so a retard can understand. Brits make better shows, if they had the budget of the Hollywood jeews there would be a lot better movies out there. John Simm actually plays the role rather than a softy joke that the USA actor,but cant cut the actor, gotta play by the hooknosed masters. cant wait to order season 2 after I get back form vacation.

This episode is no exception to that rule, but I did notice the version I originally got hooked on with BBC America apparently cut out some bits from these!  I know there was one scene I don't remember at all, not graphic but must've been for US airtime.  Beyond that, you know... :)

I have noticed the runtimes on these are 52 minutes, whereas the average runtime for a US-based show is 41 minutes at best - commercials!!  Sometimes I'd rather have the BBC for the content, the shows seem more in-depth and entertaining.

Not much here to the series, this was a point where they started trying various storylines to see where it could all go thinking it would last for years.  Funny thing is Sam keeps telling things to Annie about his 'reality', but later on it's like it's never been mentioned?",1339804800,,879,4.45625

2868662,5,B000RKBU5W,"The concept sounds like it would never work but it really does. A by-the-book modern-day cop in England is involved in a car accident and when he wakes up, he's in 1970's Manchester where the rules of policing were more relaxed and beating up suspects the norm. The contrast between the present and the past is done with deftness and the period setting never feels like a party trick because the costumes, sets and scripting all feel natural. The acting is spectacular from everyone and the constant almost science fiction wobbling about whether our hero is slightly insane or just dreaming is kept spinning without feeling forced. Often it's laugh out loud funny too (given a penchant for British humor. Some people won't get it). They tried to remake this show in the US but it is not the same. Watch the original.
Warning to those new to UK shows: the British season (called a series) is six episodes long, not 12-22 like here in the States. This show ran two seasons, which means you get a total of 12 episodes; it doesn't feel short though. They get it all said in that 12.",1338681600,,1078,4.561855670103093
2868663,5,B000RKBU5W,"I saw this show on BBC America in 2007.  This is one of the best television shows ever made.  The concept is amazing, after Sam Tyler (John Simm-The Master Dr Who) has an accident-is he in a coma, is he dead, or did he go back in time?  Can he trust his senses? John Simm is a brilliant actor. He's very low-key, but intense.  He can play a range of emotions without going overboard.

The original concept was supposed to be a sort of ""Wizard of Oz"" type thing, with Sam trying to ""wake up"" (get home.)  You can kind of see some of the Oz characters, the scarecrow, the tin man, the cowardly lion but sometimes one of two of the characters are composites of the Oz characters.  Not sure who's supposed to be Toto, though.

Philip Glenister as DCI Gene Hunt is your shoot first, let God sort it out type of policeman but he gets results.  He's the type of cop that went on instinct in 1973 and was usually right.  His methods are violent, though, compared with modern techniques. Glenister plays it over the top because Hunt is over the top.

Watch it-you will be amazed.  This is what good television is supposed to be.",1337040000,,1119,4.301435406698564
2868664,5,B000RKBU5W,"On the surface, ""Life on Mars"" resembles a by-the-numbers police procedural from the 1970s. And the series does indeed pay homage to such shows in a way that resembles a Tarantino film's affectionate references to cheesy elements of 1970s pop culture and Hong Kong action flicks. But imagine that kind of material refracted through a mind-frack of the David Lynch ilk, and you'll have a sense of what ""Life on Mars"" is like.

As with other big hits from the BBC, LOM demonstrates the value of hiring talented people who possess strong training in their craft, i.e., serious writers, actors, and directors. In the US, only the best HBO shows compare. John Simm and Liz White are gifted artists who repeatedly show us that ""less is more"" by skillfully using understatement and nuance to produce powerful, moving performances.  Really, to some degree, every creative contributor to this series does so.  It's refreshing when the audience is asked to use its intelligence.

Simm is brilliant and utterly convincing.  But most memorable is Philip Glenister as the neanderthal Detective Chief Inspector. Glenister throws himself into the outrageously politically incorrect role with a heroic lack of concern for the consequences. It's a star-making performance in a high impact meditation on human relations, technology, and existentialism.

2868665,5,B000RKBU5W,"Sam Tyler, a detective inspector with the Manchester police, is involved in an accident and finds himself back in 1973, where he has been demoted one rank but is still in the ranks of the police.

Sam thinks he's in a coma. He occasionally hears doctors, his mother and others in the present speaking to him, but he can't respond. Meanwhile there are villains to catch and standards to uphold on the mean streets of Manchester.

The series has a lot of fun comparing ethical policing standards between the two eras. According to the writers, the 1970s was a time when policemen routinely banged around suspects taking no account of their civil rights. The police also took bribes, protected gang bosses, engaged in casual sexism and racism and spent every free moment getting drunk in the pub. The series also has a good laugh with the technology of the 1970s -- mountains of manila folders, clunky walky-talkies, no DNA, primitive pathology -- as far from CSI as one could get.

This is an absorbing series. The character of Tyler's new boss Gene Hunt, an unreconstructed bastard with all the wrong instincts but a heart of gold, is wonderful. The other actors also do well.",1314489600,2,1175,4.75

The accents can be little difficult to pick up in the beginning, but it gets easier after you view a few episodes.

While the ensemble cast in the US version was strong from top to bottom, the UK series belongs to Philip Glenister as Gene Hunt.  The Sam in this series seems particularly weak in the presence of DCI Gene Hunt, and the actors playing Ray and Chris tend to fade into the background, although I found this version of Annie a bit more lively.

First an admission - I watched the 1st 3 episodes, but lost interest, so I skipped to #8.

After 3 episodes, I could find little either original, nor plausible in the whole premise.

It's a good cop/bad cop series - been done.
The good cop has special abilities that help solve crimes - yawn!
It's set in 1973 Manchester - ok, Manchester may be original, but there were cop series in 1973.
The plots to each episode are rather dull.
The underlying storyline doesn't appear to be going anywhere, nor does there appear to be any foundation behind it.

I thought that at least in the last episode, something of the premise would be revealed, but no .. he lets everything be.

BTW, as a good cop, if I've got a murderer in my grasp (a murderer who just attempted to kill me), it doesn't matter who you are, you are nicked.

2868674,5,B000RKBU5W,"WARNING! THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS!

""Life on Mars"" is a British series with some pretty odd twists. The main character, Sam Tyler, is a police officer from the year 2006 who mysteriously finds himself in the year 1973 after a traffic accident. It's never made clear whether Tyler is a time traveller or just dreaming the whole thing. However, his physical body still remains in 2006. Are we to believe Wikipedia, Sam Tyler is actually named after Rose Tyler from ""Doctor Who"", a series featuring time travellers.

Tyler is a very progressive, politically correct and law-abiding police officer. Back in 1973, he is shocked to find a police force infested by racism, sexism, homophobia and corruption. Forensics are almost unknown, and most ""investigations"" are carried out by simply beating up the usual round of suspects.

But no, the series isn't ""PC"" in and of itself. Rather, it's built around the tension between the soft cop Tyler and his rogue colleague Gene Hunt (who doesn't understand that Tyler is from the future - he thinks Tyler is simply transferred from another district). The constant conflicts between the two are quite fun to watch! Eventually, of course, they are forced to co-operate.

The plot of most episodes revolves around the usual murder mysteries, but Tyler also meets people from his past which forces him to reflect more deeply on his own past and present. Some of the crimes investigated in 1973 turn out to have connections to events in 2006. Occasionally, our hero is tormented by a supernatural character known simply as the Test Card Girl, who makes him believe that he is going insane (as well he might, meeting a character like this one!).

This DVD contains the first season of ""Life on Mars"". Another DVD features the second season. Only two seasons were produced, but there is a later series, ""Ashes to ashes"" in which Gene Hunt meets another police officer from the future. It seems the concept was too good to drop...

So what happened to Sam Tyler, then? Were his experiences in 1973 just a dream, or did he actually journey back in time? The series never really explains it. In the last episode of season two, Tyler apparently dies in 2006, but his alter ego is happily stuck in 1973. Or is it? The end of the last episode could also be interpreted as a near-death experience. Usually, I don't like series with inconclusive endings. I mean, I'm old enough to remember ""Twin Peaks""! However, ""Life on Mars"" is so well done, that the inconclusive ending feels like a logical part of the show.

Five stars.",1268352000,,2559,4.802272727272728
2868675,5,B000RKBU5W,"I waited a long time for the UK Life on Mars DVD. Not having the BBC cable channel I was familiar with the story after seeing the US version (which I liked, even though a lot of viewers panned it).  I also was familiar with John Simm through his appearances on DR WHO.

If you like time travel and/or British/US police drama from the 70's era then this is for you. It is fantastic. 5 stars.  I have finished the first season and started the 2nd.

Also I am looking forward to the follow up series Ashes to Ashes which continues the time trip ten years later with a female lead  and the return of most of the cast including the great Philip Glenister.  BBC America get this series out to the US DVD buying public.",1268092800,3,712,4.198529411764706
2868676,5,B000RKBU5W,"As someone who is a die-hard mystery reader and sci-fi fan, I was intrigued when I saw this show advertised on BBC America.  After watching the first few episodes, I was throughly hooked.  So much so, I requested the seasons 1 & 2 DVD sets as my Christmas gift!  If you are a fan of shows such as ""Lost"" and ""FlashForward"", you'll probably really enjoy the ""Life on Mars"" series.

As the prior reviews state, the basic premise is modern-day Manchester cop Sam Tyler (John Simm) is in an auto accident and ""goes back in time"" to 1970's Manchester.  Everyone is expecting DI Sam Tyler to show up at the Manchester PD, except for Sam, who is completely freaked out by the situation (and his 1970s-era wide lapel duds).  Sam has to figure out how to interact with his 1970s colleagues Ray and Chris, deal with his tough and chauvanistic boss Gene Hunt (a phenomenal performance by Philip Glenister, btw), ponder potential romance with a WPC, and, of course, figure out how he can ""get back"" to modern-day Manchester.

Some thoughts on how UK Life on Mars compares to the US version:  While the US version does try to keep the basic characters of the UK series, the two series really diverge and end very differently.  I have to say I did not really get into the US series, but then I had already watched the UK series and was somewhat biased.  The UK series is definitely gritty and darker then the US series.

Re: how Life on Mars compares to ""Lost"": As a Lost fan, I do think there are similarities in the shows such that fans of one will want to check out the other.  One big difference between LOM and Lost is that LOM episodes really become about Sam living in the 1970s and trying to approximate ""normal"" life.  So while we are interested in what happened to Sam to move him into the 1970s and how he can return to the current time, a lot of the enjoyment with the series is watching Sam acclimate to his new life and the ""team bonding"" of Gene, Sam, Ray and Chris.

If you enjoy the UK Life on Mars series, I also recommend watching ""Ashes to Ashes"", which is available (as least right now for US viewers) on the internet (see YouTube).  (This is because BBC America has a cunning plot NOT to make any money by trying to sell the US-format DVDs while it decides whether it is going to show Season 2 here in the US.)  This is the sequel to Life on Mars, where a female detective ""flashes back"" to the early 1980's, to join up with -- you guessed it -- Gene, Ray and Chris.  Ashes to Ashes is more comic/not as dark vs. LOM, but very entertaining.  As someone who was a teenager during the early 80's, I almost enjoy it more than LOM sometimes!  Happy viewing!",1266796800,,2661,4.350202429149798
2868677,5,B000RKBU5W,"After watching and enjoying the American version, I was delighted to get the UK version Series 1. I was very good and now am waiting to get the Series 2 (UK version). Loved the English take on the show and because I am an Anglophile considered it a great series - a great addition to the US version.  A must see!",1265068800,2,312,4.114754098360656
2868678,5,B000RKBU5W,"It has questions but it doesn't answer them with a bunch of other questions like shows like Lost. It's a confident little story driven by superb characters played by truly great actors such as Simm and Glenister. The dialog is punchy and pretty fast. When you look at a show like 'House', you have the patient of the week- the case of the week. And you have the bigger picture stuff concerning the show's stars. Well sometimes, the patient of the week gets lost. And that's the truly interesting stuff. Never does this happen in this show. We get enough of a taste of the trauma that Sam is going through without it impacting heavily the case of the week.

The show has moments that can be quite chilling and then parts that are hilarious. Nothing really dominates. No crazy love story out of control, no overpowering story of Sam trying to get back and the story does not get stuck. It's all very well handled and you get the feeling that audience respect was high on the writer's list of priorities.

Again, a snappy dialog and a mysterious storyline is driven to the higher level by fantastic actors who you are drawn to straight away.",1262390400,,1138,4.519417475728155
2868679,4,B000RKBU5W,"The premise of this show is very misleading. Does Sam ever use his 21st-century police skills to solve whodunits? No, his knowledge comes in handy only occasionally, with mixed results (actually, it blows up in Sam's face more than not). Will Sam stand up to Gene Hunt's crooked department and its laid-back fascism? (95% conviction rate, ""More reliable than rubber johnnies"" boasts Gene.) Nope, actually, Sam often comes around to Gene's point of view. And so on.

At the start, Sam Tyler's lover/partner is abducted by a serial killer. In the midst of tracking her down, he's hit by a car and flung back to the 70s, where the killer is already at large. If this were an American cop drama, the apprehension of the killer would form the basis of a multi-season story arc. However, in Life On Mars, it's resolved quickly, with Sam left confounded as to why he's still stuck in the past. Time travel? Coma? Insane? The most plausible answer is all three...

An oft-cited complaint by many reviewers here is Sam's lack of regard toward how crazy he looks. However, since this 70s world could all be taking place in Sam's head, it makes sense its inhabitants would ignore Sam's jittery behavior, or simply not notice. Even so, it's disappointing that Gene Hunt, a bull of a man, automatically crumbles when faced with one of Sam's preachy diatribes. Just who's in charge here? It's funny to see Phillip Glenister squinting and making odd faces during Sam's lines, as if to say, 'This isn't right. I'm in the wrong script.' In one episode, Gene barks, ""YOU'RE NOT IN CHARGE, TYLER!!"", only to fall silent and acquiesce immediately. Oh well.

John Simm doesn't strike me as a cop, regardless of the decade. But if you need an actor to look believable while screaming at a television set, he's your man. We don't learn anything about Sam in 2006 (He's literally whisked away to 1973 within the first ten minutes), which is unfortunate, though we later find out he has serious daddy issues. I can't say it's the most enthralling story arc I've ever witnessed; call me primitive, but I wanted to get back to the parts with Gene swearing and punching people.",1262390400,,2149,4.725333333333333

I liked John Simm in Doctor Who and I had seen a preview for Life on Mars and thought it would be pretty good, but I was not prepared for such an emotional meat grinder! It is outstanding in every possible respect - breathtaking music (I will never hear the song Life on Mars again without choking back tears), very intense drama, head-spinning and oftentimes extremely creepy surrealism, brilliant and witty writing, and laugh-out-loud hilariousness. John Simm and Philip Glenister are ... well ... gosh, I don't think words have been invented yet to describe how amazing they are - they're so phenomenal together that I literally couldn't figure out how they established such a complex relationship with very few words between them (mostly punches, actually). It is not exaggerating in the least to say that every other series that I currently enjoy (and there are some true stunners among them) now seem lackluster in comparison.

The entire series contains a total of 16 episodes over two seasons, but contains more depth and emotional impact -and just plain brilliant entertainment- than most series can achieve over many years.

Quite possibly the best TV show ever made.",1260835200,6,1220,4.9754901960784315
2868682,5,B000RKBU5W,"They say we most identify with the decade of our childhood. That must be true for me, because I have always been somewhat obsessive about the 1970's. So, when I first heard the premise for the BBC show ""Life On Mars"", I knew I had to see it. Well I wasn't dissapointed. ""Life On Mars"" is a wonderfully entertaining and intriquing bit of television.

For those who don't know, ""Life On Mars"" is a mix of different genres. Its part police procedural, part psychological thriller, all mixed in with a healthy dose of sci-fi. The premise revolves around DCI, Sam Tyler (John Simm), who is on the hunt for an elusive serial killer. Through a series of circumstances, he gets hit by a speeding car. When Sam awakens, he suddenly finds himself as a DI in the year 1973. Life as he knew it is entirely different. Gone are his modern glass and steel offices. Gone is modern technology. Gone are the use of modern forensics. Gone is the ideal of doing things by the book. Gone are the PC ideals that govern our society.

Instead, Sam finds himself in the dark, grimy Manchester Police HQ. This is the kingdom of DCI, Gene Hunt (Philip Glenister) a large, menacing man, who is use to getting things done his way (usually involving violence). The other officers are not much better. They are basically thugs with badges. Police work usually involves either planting evidence or beating confessions out of witnesses and suspects. Sam's one beacon of understanding is a young female WPA named, Annie Cartwright (Liz White).

During the course of the show, Sam tries to solve police cases using his modern sensibilities, all while acclimating to his new enviorment. Sam also experiences a series of hallucinogenic clues, that infer, that he might actually be in a hospital, suffering from a coma. Could he be dreaming all this? Can he find his way back to real life? Or is he just delusional?

This really is a fantastic show, that is both exciting and thought-provoking. It poses many philosphical questions and situations. What is real life? How do we know if we are dreaming? If you had the chance to go back in time, would you meet yourself or your parents? If you had the chance to effect something in the future...would you do it?

This is a well written show with wonderful performances from it's main cast. It also has an amazing soundtrack, that highlights the British hard rock/pop/glam sound of the early 70's (David Bowie, Thin Lizzy, The Sweet). One word of warning though. Do not mistake this show with the American version, that ran for one season on ABC. While, the American version was O.K., it just can't compete with the much superior U.K. version.

I highly recommend the original U.K. series, ""Life On Mars"". A great show!",1260403200,7,2728,4.696652719665272

2868685,5,B000RKBU5W,"I enjoyed the American version when it was aired, and decided to try the original.  Many state that the UK version is better, but I can't entirely agree.

Several of the episode are extremely similar in plot, etc..., but for a few (particularly the 1st episode) I prefer the US version.  Whats the phrase I'm looking for..... ""Bigger budget"" ?  Anyhow, if I had to choose any single reason why, it is because the US version feels more like 1973 (to me).

However, I also remember my disappointment as the US series progressed.  Strong out the gates, to a rather weak finish.  I don't get that same feeling here.  The UK version draws me in more with each episode. Perhaps it is what one of the other reviewers complained about; Sam's constant psychotic breaks.  I'd say with the UK version they are a bit more true. That is to say, less directly noticeable to other characters in the show (most of the time).  They could probably both tone it down a bit, perhaps with Sam actively disguising his problem (""Yeah, I was messed up before, but I'm all better now""). Anyhow, the US version was a little too over-the-top with the whole Sam acting crazy an no one doing anything about it; I think thats why I stared to sour on the US version of the show.  The UK version is still a bit to much overt acting out with no consequences, but still, it is a bit more restrained than the US interpretation.  Lets face it, in the final episode of series 1... Sam points a loaded gun on his boss allowing a suspected double homicide suspect to flee (permanently), and general crazy behavior.  The repercussions for him? A few pints at the pub. Thats asking for a lot of willing suspension of disbelief.

2868689,5,B000RKBU5W,"The BBC version of ""Life on Mars"" is a gritty, fast-paced crime drama that is in style of ""Starsky and Hutch"", ""Streets of San Francisco"" and ""Hill Street Blues"".  It is nice to see the hard line investigations on the street-none of the fluff that comes with current shows.  The detectives solve crimes with logic and instinct, not with the fancy gadgets like computers and even less on forensics.

""Life on Mars"", like its' U.S. clone, is not your typical cop show. It has a supernatural feel.  The main cop, Sam Tyler (brilliantly played by John Simm), lands in 1973 after an an accident.  His life is a constant struggle to be a 21st detective while trying to find out what has happened. Besides fighting the criminals, Tyler has to deal with the voices from his own time.

Even so, he finds a place in 1973-building relationships with the other cops, especially with Annie.  They learn to respect Tyler and his unusual instincts and methods.  Philip Glenister does a nice turn with his portrayal of Tyler's commanding officer, Gene Hunt.  The rest of the supporting cast make a good fit.

2868690,5,B000RKBU5W,"After being intrigued with our American LIFE ON MARS, we tuned into the UK set, and were totally blown away. The character of GENE HUNT is iconic, and as memorable as any cop, including DIRTY HARRY.

If you aren't adept at strong British accents, and many of the relevant parts of the culture of UK 1973, it still won't set you back.

If you hollered and screamed at the ending of the USA series (I did, in disbelief, pain and exasperation), don't worry. You can rest assured that you can scream all over again, with joy and pain and tears (I did!). It's over. What a great sense of loss!

Hang on, you can still see GENE HUNT, and CHRIS SKELTON and RAY, but don't even THINK about checking out ASHES TO ASHES before you get to scream at the 8th episode of UK Life of Mars.

And just for fun, after you've checked Wikipedia and found there was a pilot made for USA TV, with none other than Colm Meany (STAR TREK) playing Gene Hunt, and if you can find it, you're officially an obsessed fan. (I am!)

Phillip Glennister has created a GENE HUNT that is beyond the poor script they gave Meany, and IMHO, far superior to our dear HARVEY KEITEL's  GENE HUNT, which at first viewing looked to be memorable....

2868692,4,B000RKBU5W,"Sporting a fascinating premise, ""Life on Mars"" was so good that American TV decided to do a remake (which is just as good although has different cultural references obviously). While tracking down a serial killer that has kidnapped his ex and collegue officer Sam Tyler (John Simm who played ""The Master"" later on ""Doctor Who"") gets hit by a car. When he wakes up he's in the same place (although it looks radically different)in 1973. He find he still works for the police department but a radically different one that does things ""outside"" of the book and lacking the modern techniques he's used to using. He plays along not knowing what else to do. Is he in a coma (likely based on what we've seen) or has he somehow truly been thrown into the past? Needless to say his different police techniques and the respect for the rights of others brings him into conflict with his boss (Philip Glenister).

Sam finds the possibility of romance with another police officer (Liz White), occasionally gets into punch ups with co-workers when he disagrees with them and encounters mysterious voices/messages via his television set, the telephone and other devices from the world he has left behind.

The show examines a number of themes but the central mystery seems to be WHY is Tyler in the past? is he there for a purpose. The show features excellent performances from the supporting cast and the writing is top notch throughout although a couple of episodes were a bit predictable.

I am disappointed that Acorn Media has elected to break this up into ""series"" sets. The first season only had eight episodes and the second is equally as short. Given the price I would have expected both together here. Acorn has licensed the extras from the other DVD set. We get featurettes with interviews of cast, writers, directors as well as commentary tracks by cast and crew. There is also an outtakes reel, Audio commentaries for every episode with cast and crew,Interview clip with director Bharat Nalluri,""The Music of Life on Mars"" featurette with composer Ed Butt and""Get Sykes"" featurette with production designer Brian Sykes.

2868696,5,B000RKBU5W,"""LIFE ON MARS"" is life in Manchester, England, in 2006. Then Sam Tyler (John Simm), a cop, is hit by a car. Beep-beep-beep and we are in 1973 Manchester with Sam now a detective investigator, but with all the 21th century crime investigation knowledge from before the accident.  He has morals, and in an emotional dilemma.  He is an honest, smart copper.  In Sam's own words, ""Am I mad, in a coma, or back in time?"" Sam can't 'phone home' because mobile's have not been invented yet.

It's a time-travel, British police drama, cop show with parallel plots. Always a crime to solve. Always the returning sounds and images of the ICU ward and medical efforts to bring Sam back.

Gene Hunt (Philip Glenister) is an older cop of the 70's who is quick to punch a suspect, an arrogant man, a drinker, arrests without evidence, and will fight Sam Tyler over his ""different"" ways of investigating. Gene goes for the guy, in his crime-solving thinking, and with his fist to get his way. A protagonist you learn to love to hate.

Annie Cartwright (Liz White), is the bonny looking policewoman of 1973 who is a ""friend"" of Sam, often taking his side.  Britain has some great acting stars, and this show concept is a good twist on a police crime series. It's no wonder, the US tried to keep it going--but alas, without the U.K. stars.

8 episodes, each about an hour. But this DVD is also packed with MORE BONUS FEATURES THAN I'VE EVER SEEN BEFORE. Every episode can also be watched with audio commentaries using cast, crew, writers, producers, directors, etc. DOUBLE THE FUN. Added to that is SUBTITLES, via Acorn Media (Thanks ACORN).  There is a two-part interview/discussion about ""How did the series get its start?""  It has a music featurette.  There are outtakes-bloopers.  And more.  A LOADED DVD SET MAKING IT A VALUE.

The series cleverly uses period music and recording artists at key spots in the episodes.  It adds to the 1973 side, but the crime solving is 21st century, with some 1970s snags.  Good stuff.

The main theme behind the series, Sam and his time-travel, reminds me of a great book series, ""Outlander"", by Diana Gabaldon.

""LIFE ON MARS"" is unrated, but not for children. If rated, it would likely be PG-21, R, or, in a few fast scene flashes, more.

An extremely confused Sam discovers he is now a Detective Inspector with the same police force, now serving under DCI Gene Hunt (Philip Glenister). He is unable to work out if he has gone mad, suffering a coma-induced delusion or has somehow really travelled back in time. As he tries to figure out what is going on, he discovers uncanny parallels between the case the team is following in 1973 and his own investigation in 2006 and realises he may be able to save Maya by changing history, but if all of this is in his mind, how can that be?

Life on Mars was a huge smash hit for the BBC when it aired as two seasons in 2006 and 2007. Its spin-off/sequel series, Ashes to Ashes, has maintained this success with that show's third and final season due to air next year. A US remake, which resets the action to New York City, was well-received earlier this year but low ratings saw it canned after half a season (although they got a - pretty ludicrous - explanation for their mystery in the final episode). This is 'high concept' TV, where the writers can sum up the idea in one sentence and the TV exec's immediate reaction is ""We have to make this."" The original thought was to make a straight 1970s cop show, but this ran into difficulties since any realistic show would not paint the police of the time - sometimes racist, misogynistic and hopelessly corrupt - in the best light. By having a modern, by-the-book, politically correct copper joining a 1970s team they created a very strong opportunity for drama and social commentary which, by and large, works well.

The show is bolstered by its two leads, John Simm and Philip Glenister as the confused Sam Tyler and the magnificent Gene Hunt (""An overweight, over-the-hill, nicotine-stained borderline alcoholic homophobe with a superiority complex and an unhealthy obsession with male bonding,"" - Sam), an old-school dinosaur of a copper who believes that hunches and leaning on informants is a more reliable method of nailing crooks than forensic evidence and psychological profiling. These two actors first worked together in the mighty State of Play and are here reunited to stellar effect. Both actors - among Britain's best actors around at the moment - bring their A-game to this show. Glenister has a particularly tough job as Gene Hunt could become a figure of fun and caricature very easily, but he keeps the character rooted in reality. The writing is also fair, suggesting that whilst Hunt's methods for catching crooks are inept by modern standards, the lack of bureaucracy and paperwork does have benefits, with Hunt's methods sometimes working when Tyler's methodical plans fail to produce results. In fact, the episodes usually work best when Tyler and Hunt's different approaches work in tandem together.

The supporting cast is also very strong. Liz White is superb as Annie, the only person in 1973 whom Sam confides his predicament in, whilst Dean Andrews as thuggish copper Ray is also great in a role that could have been very two-dimensional. He is very much Sam's enemy on the team, but Gene recognises his limitations (which fuels his vendetta towards Sam even more), which culminates in the penultimate (and best) episode of the season. Marshall Lancaster does a great job as Chris, a younger copper torn between Gene's old-school policing and what he sees as the more efficient and fairer ideas introduced by Sam, although he has arguably the least to do of the main cast in the first season.

As the season continues, the episodes are generally divided between whatever the crime of the week is and what is going on in Sam's head (Sam suffers auditory and visual hallucinations which gradually convince him he is really in a coma in 2006) and how these impact on one another. This is a difficult balancing act to juggle, and sometimes you do wish they could just drop the weird stuff going on with Sam to just have a 'chalk and cheese' buddy cop show episode once in a while. At the same time, Sam's own internal journey is fascinating as the writers seem to confound the audience every time they think they know the rules. At least twice Sam seems to do something in 1973 which effects his present in 2006, and at one stage has what appears to be memories of one of his colleagues from his own POV as a four-year-old, which leaves the question of what is really going on very much up in the air. At this stage of the game things are left very ambiguous though. Some characters seem to know more about Sam's predicament than they are letting on, but others react to Sam's apparently insane outbursts in a more realistic and appropriate manner. What is going on? Well, we've still got a while to find out (the final episode of Ashes to Ashes promises to explain everything about both series), but the journey is a hell of a lot of fun, accompanied by a phenomenally good soundtrack.

Life on Mars, Season 1 (****) is part social commentary, part drama, part comedy and always extremely entertaining, excellently-acted and well-written. It is available now in the UK (DVD, Blu-Ray) and USA (DVD).",1245888000,2,5846,4.76604146100691
2868698,5,B000RKBU5W,"'Life on Mars' is that rare thing: a comedy/drama series that is both funny and dramatic.
It has a premise created solely to glorify the antics of Detective Chief Inspector Gene Hunt (!): a hard-bitten, hard-drinking, foul-mouthed 70's copper, who thinks nothing of beating confessions, planting evidence and falsifying records in order to  ""get another scrote off the streets..""
Reactionary of course, but satisfying.

Modern pc PC Sam Tyler is mortified.
Hurled back through time by a hit-and-run driver and unsure whether he's comatose, insane or dead; Tyler makes the best of it - utilising 21st Century progressive policing in shoot-em-up, mind-me-flares, drop-your-knickers-darlin' 70's Manchester.

Incorporating modern techniques such as psychological profiling and crime-scene confinement, Tyler quickly rubs up against Hunt's kick the door in and cripple everyone inside methods.
They inevitably lock horns and it's fascinating.

Aided and abetted by Annie Cartwright (Liz White - drool factor 8 on the pointless slobbering after sexy actresses scale), a put upon but wily WPC, who is slowly coming to terms with Tyler's unique predicament, while often resembling a referee.

He receives messages from the 'other side': warnings about future events, updates on his medical condition and declarations of love and support from his family, whom he meets (including himself); resulting in an unnerving series of events - suspenseful and moving in equal measure.

The only drawback to 'LOM' is the speed in which some very complicated and seemingly convoluted cases are conveniently resolved in order to accommodate the 55 minute episode running time.

Other than that, it's Brit telly at its standard-bearing best. The performances are uniformly (sorry!) excellent, the locations and fashions precise and even the soundtrack - basically a cascade of pointless 70's rock - works well in the context.  Very dodgy glam and soul in perfect tandem with the blaring visuals.

To the one-star rater, I understand that 8 episodes seems a bit shy for what is being paid.  However, these episodes waste nothing, so their value is increased versus more episodes full of filler.

Also, remember that the execs at ABC cut the American remake short, and it ended badly.  Perhaps if they had given the show at least a second season, it might have been better.  As it is, we're stuck with the crappy ending leaving us empty.  THIS VERSION WILL NOT LEAVE YOU THIS WAY.",1245542400,,611,4.4324324324324325
2868700,5,B000RKBU5W,"I did not have the opportunity to see this original U.K. series before watching the U.S. series (which I enjoyed and am sad it did not continue on).  I was able to get an advance review copy and was eager to compare it to the remake.  I had wondered how the 1970's U.K. references would relate to a U.S. viewer.  I am no stranger to U.K. television, so I may have an advanage in that respect.

I was pleased to find that the relationships to the U.K. police proceedures of the 1970's seemed parallel to those of the U.S., and the music of the time was international.  The transition of the U.S. viewer to 1973 England works just as well as the U.S. remake. Sure, I am not as familiar with the U.K. cars of that time, so I assume they are accurate for the period, but that does not matter.  The series works for a U.S. viewer, and that is great!

I found it interesting just how much carried over to the U.S. re-make, yet the actual personalities of some major characters are distinctly different.  I find the U.K. DI somewhat more pleasent than the Gritty U.S. character.  But yet the U.S. character was an interesting character.  It is much like comparing the U.K. ""The Office"" to the U.S. re-make, they both work with slightly different character personalities set in the same situations.

DISC 1 has episodes 1 & 2 (no names given) and also includes the first half hour of a 64 minute U.K. DVD special on making the series ""Take A Look At The Lawman"" deleased May 15th 2006, followed by an all-to-brief 3 1/2 minute interview with the director.

DISC 2 has episodes 3 & 4 then concludes the U.K. special ""Take A Look At The Lawman"".

DISC 3 has episodes 5 & 6 and analysis of the music used in the series.

DISC 4 has episodes 7 & 8 then some out-takes, I have not had a chance to watch these yet.

The shows run about 58 minutes each. While the shows do not have regular closed captions, they are SUBTITLED.  The English 'accents' are not heavy, but some viewers may want to keep these up when an unfamiliar British word is used.  Fortunately the shows are anamorphic widescreen & the stereo sound is expecially pleasent during the music.

I do have one minor issue with the DVD authoring: about 12 minutes into the second episode of discs 1 & 2 (episodes 2 & 4) there is a pause for a layer change.  I think it would have been better to try to keep the full episode on one layer, preventing this brief interruption in music & ambient noise.  I think they could have worked it so that the layer change occured in the bonus material.  Maybe newer players will not pause as long as my older player.

Overall a good presentation.  I can not wait for the second series to come out in November 2009.

THe first season (series if your British) was 8 episodes. Some may quibble about the price, and perhaps rightly so... but British DVDs cost more due to licensing fees. That's just the way it is, check out Doctor Who for 99$ for only 13 episodes. It sucks, sure... we all want cheaper DVDs, but what really counts is if it's worth it.
Life on Mars IS worth the 40$ price tag, I'd pay more if it was the only way to see this show. IF you've only experienced the American remake... which I won't comment on here... then you have to see the original.
Life on Mars is at its core a 70s cop show. Complete with the fantastic car, and the driving that seems to always find boxes and trash bins to knock over, as well as the coppers who care more about the end result than the way they got there. But added to this mix is that possible sc-fi edge. And I say edge because you step into this show not knowing anything for sure. So you watch, and you laugh, you ponder, you get confused and you get hooked. Without a doubt unmatched, in my honest opinion, in terms of acting and writing.",1243382400,6,1218,4.143459915611814

The UK version, i.e. the original, is truly a masterpiece.  Buy it (at any price), and watch it in peace and quiet with the best quality A/V setup you can manage.  You will not be disappointed.

For the record, I'm an American, and I had to create my own sort of British slang glossary as I went along.  For me, this was half the fun.  (The fabulously obscene Gene Hunt was the other half.)

2868706,5,B000RKBU5W,"This series knocked me out when I first saw it on BBC America.  Much as I liked the American remake (primarily for it's great cast), this is the real deal.  Simm and Glenister are magnificent as modern and old-school DCI's, respectively.  Simm plays Tyler as an efficient, by-the-book leader, while Glenister is John Wayne with a Brit accent.  Their relationship is the joy of the series. This program has a much grittier, ""French Connection"" feel than the remake does.

If you like this series, I highly recommend that you check out the original BBC miniseries of ""State of Play"" with Simm in the role that Russell Crowe plays in the American remake and Glenister in a supporting role as (naturally) a Detective Chief Inspector.  It also features James MacAvoy (""Atonement""), Kelly MacDonald (""The Girl in the Cafe"", ""No Country for Old Men"") and the wonderful Bill Nighy (""The Girl in the Cafe"" and ""Love, Actually"").  While I haven't seen the remake, I am willing to wager that it couldn't possibly be better than the engrossing original.

Also, if you want to take a gander at a Brit series that was an obvious inspiration for ""Life on Mars"", check out Series 1 of ""The Sweeney"" starring the great John Thaw as head-cracking, rule-bending DCI Jack Regan and Dennis Waterman as Detective Sergeant George Carter.

This is NOT a short season. In Great Britain, seasons are 8 shows. If you watched it on BBC, you waited a year to see the next season. Doctor Who is the only current British show to have 13 episodes (like an American season). You end up with 16 total episodes, each a year apart.

As for PRICE: a full season of Doctor Who is between $65 and $75 per 13 episode season, so the price is absolutely in line with that. Judging the British counterpart by its American (failure) is a really poor idea by someone who doesn't *know* anything about the British season and has now artificially lowered the rating of this superior British piece.

BBC's Life on Mars was amazing as it came out. It really ignited my imagination. John Simms gives a stellar performance. If you like the American series, the British series is much tighter, has better symbolism, reminds viewers that the past is different than the present, and it puts into perspective modern detective work as it's performed without CSI and million-dollar-crime labs.

Sad to say, it was real.

I'm never going to like the US Version, and as far as I'm concerned there is only ONE series called Life on Mars, wih John Simm and Philip Glenister. This was utterly brilliant show -- everyone I've ever shown it to (Americans included) have become instantly hooked.

This is a gritty, edgy, dark show. At times confusing for Americans (some of you don't know what a Party 7 is, I'll tell you now it's rather vile beer that comes in a tin can meant for about 7 people, you have to open it with chisels and hammers. That's the number one question I get from my American friends when they are watching this show). There might be a slight language/cultural barrier to those who are not British. Fear not -- this isn't something that you will never adjust to. After about two or three episodes, most of my friends stopped asking me to explain what the characters just said because it's easy enough to understand.

Brilliant, crisp writing, brilliant three dimensional characters, fab directing, you really can't get any better. This is one of the best shows produced by the BBC in decades.

If you happen to have seen the US series please give this version a chance as well. While the premise is the same they are very different in tone.

He is quite simply hilarious. Simm by contrast rather underplays his role, the exact thing to do as Gene Hunt is the real scene stealing ""star"", but the chemistry between the 2 is excellent, and all of the supporting cast are wonderful.

My only small niggles are really the way that Sam doesn't have as much fun with his ""future knowledge"" as he should do, he doesn't go placing bets for example (although he ""knows"" that Red Rum will win the Grand National as Gene has picked it on the office sweep). But then if you think back to 1973 yourselves, you might be hard pressed to remember a lot of detail. Who won the FA cup? (Sunderland beat Leeds 1-0,  I think, but its 1976 before I could tell you the next one (Southampton beat United 1-0 I think!). Three years to wait to place a bet is a long time! Oh, there was a sugar shortage in 1975, a drought in 76 and the Silver Jubilee in 77. Which might enable Tyler to ensure he has sugar for his tea, water for his lawns and a stock of Union Jacks but not useful information. So perhaps I am being a little harsh!

2868716,5,B000RKBU5W,"Life on Mars is a cop show set in 1973 with a big twist - the lead character, Sam Tyler, is from 2006.  He is everything a modern cop should be - professional, methodical, meticulous, and politically correct.  When his girlfriend (a fellow police officer) urges him to follow a hunch, he scoffs.

Then, in a speeding turn of events, his girlfriend is kidnapped and he is hit by a car.  When he wakes up, he finds himself in a time so removed from his own, he might as well be on Mars.  The embodiment of this world of prehistoric policing is his new boss, DCI Gene Hunt.

The fascinating chemistry between Tyler and Hunt is what makes the show.  Although the show initially condemns Hunt's brute force technique, Hunt is never painted as a villain.  Instead, he and Tyler work out a balance, and make an excellent team as they start solving crimes using Hunt's instinct and Tyler's careful evidence-gathering.

Another gem of the show is Annie Cartwright, a long-suffering but good-natured Women's Division police constable.  She provides Tyler with a sympathetic ear and level headed advice, and their easy flirting is fun to watch and never feels forced.

The first episode is perhaps a little too packed, as it sets the premise, introduces Tyler to his new world, and has him work a case that may be connected to his girlfriend's kidnapping 33 years in the future.  The second episode eases the pace, though, and the show falls into it's satisfying groove.

Every episode has has laugh-out-loud moments and great one-liners, moments of suspense as the characters tackle a case, and moments of creepy surrealism as Sam wonders what reality really is.

Bizzare enough I hear you cry, but it only gets weirder and weirder.  I have to say that my view might be biased,(ok, the series was filmed local to where I live and have grown up, and yes ok, there are some scenes in the 2nd series that were filmed at my local car showroom) but it does make compelling viewing, if only for you to try and work out what on earth is going on.  It is cleverly filmed, mainly out on location.  A lot of our technology has been cleverly disguised for the filming! (see if you can spot any sattelite dishes on the houses!)

2868718,5,B000RKBU5W,"One of the most unusual, subtle, and philosophically sophisticated series to grace the small screen!

Our first glimpse of DCI Sam Tyler isn't very promising.  He's coolly efficient at his job, but doesn't seem to derive anything more than a grim satisfaction from it.  He's dating a subordinate, which tells you everything you need to know about his social life.
Then he is thrust into a bizarre situation: after a near-fatal car accident, he finds himself in 1973.  Why 1973?  He doesn't know. Complicating Sam's already impossible situation is that some of his senses (especially sight and touch) indicate that he is in 1973, while others (especailly hearing) indicate that he is lying comatose in a 2006 hospital bed.
Lost, confused, and frightened, Sam attempts to work out what has happened to him... and how to get home to 2006.  If he can't trust his memories or the evidence of his own senses, what can he trust?
Very slowly, Sam begins to change.  He smiles.  He rediscovers and reconnects with what he's lost--a family cat, football matches, then his mother and father.  We see that 1973 Manchester is, economically, a much bleaker place than 2006 Manchester... but it's also warmer, more organic, all earth tones in contrast to sleekly modern 2006, which is filmed in cool blues and greys.  Sam's 1973 bedsit is hideous, a garish riot of oranges and browns, but it's also more lived-in than his spotless white-and-chrome 2006 flat. But 1973 isn't a lost paradise, either; ""Life on Mars"" doesn't hide 1973's flaws or film it through a rose-coloured camera lens.  It shows us what we have gained, and what we have lost along the way.  We see that the reforms in policing that stifled Sam and his colleagues in 2006 are a direct reaction to the police abuses Sam sees in 1973.
Sam's 2006 knowledge and sensibilities are both boon and liability.  He's had a thorough grounding in criminal psychology and modern forensics, and he's extremely well-acquainted with drug crime, which is only just beginning in 1973.  But he never seems to realize the extent to which casual racism and sexism affect life in 1973.  He treats WPC Annie Cartwright, the lone woman in the department, as an equal--which she appreciates--but doesn't understand why everyone else doesn't.  He sees in her a talented cop being underused; he's right, of course, but he thinks that all he needs to do to further her integration into CID is to draw attention to her abilities.  To no one's surprise except Sam's--certainly not Annie's--the men react with undisguised contempt.
It's this sort of subtle contrast between 1973 and 2006--the weaknesses inherent in being from the future, as well as the strengths--that really set ""Life on Mars"" apart.",1197331200,39,2724,4.925601750547046

2868720,5,B000RKBU5W,"Bear with me now, it is a series about a modern day cop who gets hit by a car and ends up in a coma.  The next minute he is standing in an abandoned inner city lot wondering what the heck just happened!  We soon discover he is in the 1970s version of his life.  Is he tripping on hospital drugs?  In a coma induced delusion?  Or, really transported back in time?

These questions are asked by both the audience and the main character.  You would think this plotline is a one trick pony and grow old fast, but it never does.  The scripts are ingenious, the characters fascinating, great and obscure 70s music tracks all add up to a memorable trip down memory lane.

Personally, I have great memories of growing up in the late 70s but the grimy and realistic portrayal of that time made me re-examine that period.  I loved the grit of each episode and nothing is quite what it seems in this series.  The corrupt leader (DC Hunt) of the unit is not all bad - there are lots of shades of grey here.

I have also seen the second series and highly recommend that as well.  A note to die hard fans: although there was only two series of this program, ""Ashes to Ashes"" was made with DC Hunt due to the high popularity.",1192233600,,1210,4.208695652173913

8201158,5,B000RKBU5W,"This was our second time through.  This is a very clever, well-written series.  I'm not sure if it would have worked without John Simm as Sam Tyler, who brings just the right mixture of bewilderment, sadness, and determination.  Philip Glenister is great as Gene Hunt. And you have to love Liz White as Annie Cartwright , so sweet, but so strong.  And you have to love the early 70s British Rock.  Some of it is instantly recognizable from the U.S. charts; others were huge in Britain but never crossed over.  I don't know how they could afford to get the rights again to all that music.",1439164800,3,587,4.490566037735849
