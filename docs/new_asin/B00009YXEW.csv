1898346,5,B00009YXEW,"It's great to see one of The Boys' best features and some of their funniest short subjects coming out on DVD. Let's hope, however, that ALL of their features and shorts will be forthcoming. I would love to see a series of discs, each containing one feature and a few shorts until the entire L & H catalog is released.",1059436800,7,317,4.3
1898347,5,B00009YXEW,"Finally, those of us who love comedy can say there is justice. For too long ""The Boys"" have been ignored while a host of their impersonators have been given the red carpet treatment in terms of DVD and VHS releases. I hope that this will signal the release of such treasures as ""Way out West"" and ""Two Chumps at Oxford"" not to mention all those brilliant shorts. I did purchase some of the Lost Film series on DVD a year ago-they only serve to whet the appetite. I have two young children(13 &11) whom I have successfully converted to fans of the duo through viewings of old tapes. In an era where vulgarity and sledgehammer sexual asides are considered the epitome of high class comedy, the genius of Stan and Ollie will show a new generation that it is possible to make everyone laugh at the same time without offending every 2nd person.",1058140800,10,839,4.490196078431373
1898348,5,B00009YXEW,"Good to finally see that the original Laurel & Hardy movies will be released in all their original slendor. Well, at least that's what we all hope for... A large VHS video collection of their movies was available here in the Netherlands in the 80s, but on DVD the boys have not been treated well, apart from some nice releases in Germany. Let's hope this will be the start of a fine series.",1057622400,5,390,4.3561643835616435

Let's just hope(and pray)that this won't be the last and they'll put every one out soon!! What would be even better(hope you guys are reading this)is if they added the foreign shorts/features,too along with the American versions...But,for now,this box set is perfect and hopefully there'll be more to come!! Thanks alot guys!!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!",1056672000,5,527,4.921348314606742

1898357,5,B00009YXEW,I am a long time L&H fan  so anything they do (including reading the phone book) would be great IMO.  This one was done near the end of their careers and Laurel was having health problems while Hardy has lost some weight.  However they didn't let it interfere with the motion picture which was shot overseas.,1445990400,,308,4.464285714285714

1898398,5,B00009YXEW,If only for The Music Box you have to get this.  The Music Box is the flick where they're delivering the piano up the huge stairs and it's an Academy Award winner back in the 30s.,1386892800,,179,3.9722222222222223

Many middle school young people have little or no knowledge of Laurel & Hardy and they absolutely loved the Music Box. So glad I could find it and share it with them.",1373500800,,294,4.175438596491228
1898401,4,B00009YXEW,"This was an excellent example of the Laurel and Hardy routine, and contains the famous line - ""....another fine mess..."".  Stan Laurel's dimwitted calmness is a perfect offset to Oliver Hardy's know it all attitude.  I think the wives in this movie have very interesting roles, and bigger parts than I've seen in other movies.",1372982400,,326,4.909090909090909

much and as well as my family also. to funny for words.",1360368000,,169,3.473684210526316
1898404,5,B00009YXEW,"This is the funniest Laurel and Hardy film that I can remember. I saw it on Turner Classic Movies on television and I had to have it for my film library. The feel of this movie is almost like Gleason and Carney in The Honeymooners. Ollie and Stan try to flim-flam their rather strong/aggressive wives into believing that Ollie is ill and must go on a cruise for his health; meanwhile, Stan and Ollie really are going to their lodge convention to have fun with the guys. The interplay between Stan and Ollie is, as always, hilarious, and when their scheme starts to unravel, the deception and lies only accelerate! This is a domestic farce that I was willing to pay a little more for because I was really entertained. If you love Laurel and Hardy, this is a gem!",1358899200,,761,4.442857142857143
1898415,5,B00009YXEW,This was a Christmas gift and my brother loved it.  Laurel and Hardy are always good for a gentl laugh.,1357257600,,103,4.15
1898416,5,B00009YXEW,Extremely funny.  It gave me a good laugh.  This one is not on a much as their other movies so it is a good one to own!,1356307200,,119,3.3703703703703702

1898420,5,B00009YXEW,"One of the boys best vehicles,The boys belong to a club called The Sons Of The Desert. The group is preparing to go to another city on a convention. Of course,MRS Laurel and,MRS Hardy say no. The boys think of a way to go. Once at the convention they,needless to say get into all kinds of trouble. The convention is being filmed and MRS Hardy and MRS Laurel go to the movies and find out where their husbands are when they see the newsreel. They catch the devil when they come home.
A cut scene,The boys are in a bike parade leading the other members. Of course,with  them in the lead, problems galore. The boys and the parade wind up in the nearest fountain.(The film shows The Sons on foot parade with no bikes in sight.)
The Official Laurel and Hardy fan club is called Sons Of The Desert.
A MUST HAVE if your a Stan and Ollie fan.",1328313600,,834,4.245283018867925

1898422,4,B00009YXEW,"I bought the dvd as a backup to my VHS copy which, I've begun to wear out. The notes on the VHS box indicate that the film runs ""86"" minutes; the dvd notes the run-time is ""68"" minutes. I haven't played them back to back, yet. The film remains one of Mr. Laurel and Mr. Hardy's BEST!",1322524800,,283,3.982456140350877
1898423,5,B00009YXEW,"Brilliant!  My daughters, ages 9 & 8, and I have watched L & H for about 5 years now.  We love Great Guns too - maybe still our favorite but Sons of the Desert is right there.  L & H pack so much comedic talent in to one scene that you can view them numerous times and still catch something new each time.",1321920000,,305,3.8095238095238093
1898424,2,B00009YXEW,Bought this for my son .. the tape is ok ... but not worth the money. The quality is good but still not worth the money.,1315872000,,120,3.6538461538461537
1898435,5,B00009YXEW,"The unquestionable star of this DVD is Sons of the Desert! This is one greatest comedy performances of all time. So getting this DVD is worth this little treasure alone! The others; The Music Box, Another Fine Mess and Busy Bodies certainly have their moments while County Hospital is only so-so. But again, you get this for Sons of the Desert and the rest is just icing on the cake!",1309910400,,383,4.485714285714286
1898436,5,B00009YXEW,I was raised watches these two masters of comedy. My sons enjoyed watching them as they grew up and mimic the silly mannerisms emoting many a laugh in our home.  It was finally good to replace the old VHS for DVD.,1308009600,,213,4.195121951219512
1898437,5,B00009YXEW,"I love watching these old classic Laurel & Hardy films.  Having met Stan Laurel twice in 1963 as a young woman, it is also a personal remembrance.  These two were the original ""Dumb and Dumber,"" but did it with such charm and grace.  They will live on through their films.

I would love to collect all their movies, but so many are not available in the U.S.A., which is appalling since they were filmed here.  Their films were also historical archives of how Los Angeles looked in those early movie days, how people dressed, lived, and worked at that time.  The stairs in the film ""The Music Box"" (in this collection) still exist in the Silver Lake district of Los Angeles and even have a plaque at the location commemorating the Academy Award-winning 1932 film.

L&H were the epitome of Hal Roach's genius by virtue of him promoting them, yet they were also comic geniuses in their own right, especially Stan, who wrote, directed and even edited many of their productions and those of other comedy stars on the lot.

I am so happy to have found a DVD with some of my favorite L&H classics.  I hope more will become available on Amazon.",1303257600,,1136,4.529411764705882
1898438,5,B00009YXEW,"This is one of my all-time favourites and this movie is a riot! Ollie's wife is one nightmare of a wife (""Don't you sugar ME!"" she snaps at Ollie at one point), and Stan's wife is out duck hunting. He's inhaling the wax fruit at Ollie's house when the little Mrs. trots in with a shotgun. It just gets loonier and loonier. How these people, esp. the women, kept straight faces throughout all this mayhem is beyond me. At one point Ollie's wife empties the entire kitchen cupboard in what has to be record time. One of my favourite Laurel and Hardy shorts ends with Ollie's house burned down to the ground (courtesy of Stan), him, with a black eye (the wife) sitting in what's left of an easy chair, and wearing what I believe to be some sort of lodge uniform with a bent sword (wife again). Stans reaction is something like: ""Well, I'll be going home now..."" And Ollie gives this little goodbye hand flourish and that was the end. These shows used to be all over the tv when I grew up, one of the perks of being over 42.",1301961600,3,1020,4.290155440414508
1898439,2,B00009YXEW,"I was disappointed with this purchase which was mostly old silent shorts.  There was one movie worth watching. If you like silents this may be ok for you, but this is certainly not the best of Laurel and Hardy",1300147200,7,209,4.358974358974359
1898440,4,B00009YXEW,It was a good movie with the standard pops. i wondered what the sound and video quality would be like and wasn't disapointed.  the sound was good and the video part only had a few area that weren't to good but it didn't take away from the movie at all. i would recommend this to any fan as part of there video collect.,1299283200,,318,4.0476190476190474
1898441,1,B00009YXEW,"None of these are Laurel and Hardy films and all of them are so bad that no one bothered to renew the copyrights on them. Most of these were made before they were a team, and the rest are guest appearances they should have avoided. For die-hard fans ONLY - and even they might regret the purchase.",1297555200,15,297,4.228070175438597
1898442,5,B00009YXEW,"Though the quality doesn't match the British DVDs, this is by far the best DVD available for U.S. DVD players. Unfortunately, a legal battle in the U.S. prevents their best work from being released on DVD. Every other DVD available in the U.S. feature L&H movies that are so mediocre that no one bothered to renew copyrights. ""Sons of the Dessert"" is definitely the duo's best movie, though their best work was their 20 minute ""2-reelers"" made between 1927-29 (silent) and 1929-1934 (with sound). Anything before or after is sub-par or horrible. ""Music Box"" and ""Busy Bodies"" are two of their finer shorts, while ""Another Fine Mess"" and ""County Hospital"" are sub-par, but still enjoyable, works from their best period. If you still have a VCR, buy Cabin Fever's excellent collections of their shorts, released in the late 80s and early 90s.",1296000000,3,840,4.922535211267606
1898443,5,B00009YXEW,"This and 1937's ""Way Out West"" are the 2 great Laurel and Hardy features. ""Sons of the Desert"" takes a simple premise - the boys want to attend a fraternal lodge convention in Chicago over the objections of Mrs. Hardy, and mines gold with it.
Every scene in the movie is loaded with visual and verbal humor. There's one scene where Hardy is soaking his feet in a big bucket of hot water. Naturally, all 3 people in the scene wind up soaked to the bone and after the bucket is emptied, it is thrown for another belly laugh. Fans of slapstick will certainly love this movie but there is much verbal humor as well.
When it appears that their lie about going to Honolulu for Hardy's health has been exposed, they improvise a lengthy and hilarious story of how they arrived home from Honolulu before their ship- ""We shiphiked."" This is really a great comedy well deserving of it's classic reputation.",1295913600,6,895,4.530864197530864
1898444,5,B00009YXEW,"You can't go too wrong with a collection headlined by ""Sons of the Desert"", one of Laurel & Hardy's best features. Sort of an exploration into the relationship between Stan & Ollie and their patient but quick-tempered wives (L&H were usually incurring the wives' wraths on film, mostly because they were so dumb). A little white lie about Ollie taking a Hawaiian vacation (with Stan in tow) to ""cure his illness"" is really an excuse for the boys to sneak off to ""The Sons of the Desert"" convention stateside. It's a tale that's beautifully played out, with every joke & sight gag hitting the mark as the story's twists & turns inevitably lead to disaster (in typical L&H fashion, with Laurel getting ""rewarded"" for telling the truth & Hardy's pompous nature to ""stick to the lie"" gets every dish, pot & pan in the kitchen thrown at him). Look for Charley Chase in a riotous supporting role as an obnoxious fellow conventioner.
The handful of shorts following are top-notch L&H nonsense: The Oscar-nominated ""The Music Box"", a study in frustration as Stan & Ollie's efforts to deliver a jangling piano up a steep hill to a mansion get nowhere fast; ""Another Fine Mess"" is a daffy comedy filled with offbeat gags as the boys ""pretend"" to be butler & maid at a mansion; ""Busy Bodies"" is a violent comedy of destruction as Stan & Ollie wreak havoc on themselves & reduce their workplace to kindling; and ""County Hospital"" has Stan caring for a gout-ridden Ollie...which Stan is, of course, anything but ""helpful"".
The DVD extras are a nice touch, with interviews from various admirers of the team. Not a bad offering from Lionsgate!",1283817600,3,1628,4.756183745583039
1898455,5,B00009YXEW,"The Sons of the Desert is one of the best Laurel and Hardy films. It is truly a classic. This DVD set is great, I'm not sure what others are complaining about. Charley Chase has a great cameo in the film as well.",1265587200,2,212,3.953488372093023
1898456,3,B00009YXEW,"There's no need to rehash the problems associated with this Hallmark disc, I agree with all of them.  I'm not waiting any more years for a decent L&H set(and probably end up with something as bad as the new Little Rascals set).  I'm just going to go ahead and order the Region 2 set because that is apparantly the only way I'll get complete, unedited L&H films.  It's just too bad they wasted disc space with colorized versions, but with good B&W versions it will be worth it.  It's horrifying to even ""think"" about these colorized versions being on the disc.",1252195200,,559,4.5049504950495045
1898457,5,B00009YXEW,"Movie is 5-stars.
I believe I received a bootleg, pirated, copy of the Lions-Gate / Hallmark version, because the faces were washed-out, which is caused by making a copy, of a copy, lightening the faces each time. I have seen other, rented versions of both the shorts and the feature that had a much better picture. I doubt Hallmark made the picture quality worse by remastering. Though remastering is not restoring and Hallmark could have only turned up the brightness level and called it remastering. However, no other reviewer has complained about washed out faces. So I believe I received a bootleg, pirated, copy, which I returned. I then bought a different version elsewhere online, from Movies Unlimited, with a different cover, by a different studio, Nostalgia Family Videos, which was a good print that I am keeping.

The feature is about Laurel and Hardy lying to their wives, trying to keep from getting caught, and regretting lying to their wives.",1240963200,2,959,4.956521739130435

1898459,3,B00009YXEW,"Despite a lot of customer reviews that say this L&H set is not technically strong, I found this to be a worthwhile purchase.  Actually, the transfer is good but it is obvious the films could benefit from a cleaned up soundtrack (pops/clicks/hiss pervade the audio).  But these films are hilarious and imminently enjoyable. SONS OF THE DESERT & THE MUSIC BOX are a must have, surely their best works. Only THE THREE STOOGES, in my opinion, surpass them in laugh power.  Oliver Hardy's ""slow burns,"" when he turns and looks right in the camera in response to Stan's antics always bowls me over.  You won't be disappointed.",1209513600,,620,4.766355140186916

1898468,2,B00009YXEW,"An absolute dud from ST. CLAIR ENTERTAINMENT.

The solo piano used as backing for most of the silent films in this set in no way matches music to action, and is in fact a dub from a scratchy LP-- clicks and pops abound, especially in gaps between the songs.

THE PROGRAM--
LUCKY DOG (1918) - Their first appearance together. Stan bumps into stick-up man Ollie, who then delivers the future team's first ever line: ""Stick 'em both up, insect, or I'll part your hair with lead."" The plot turns on the difficulties Stan's mongrel dog brings him.
Hardy appears again later, disguised as the Count de Chease. It's clear from his interactions with Stan in the mansion scene that the two comedians meshed nicely, and needed to be teamed up.
Quality is poor- a dark, washed-out first reel. Although the second is brighter, it's filled with repaired breaks and jumps.
THE TREE IN A TEST TUBE (1943) - L&H's only color film is a short made for the Dept. of Agriculture. Silent footage with a voiceover, as we see all the amazing products made from processed wood. Print damaged by persistent scratches and color aging.
THE FAMILY JOOLS (1931) - Cameos by L&H, Wallace Beery, Buster Keaton, the Keystone Kops, Edw. G. Robinson, Our Gang, Norma Shearer, Hedda Hopper, Joan Crawford, Harold Lloyd, Gary Cooper, Maurice Chevalier, Barbara Stanwyck, Joe E. Brown, Fay Wray and a dozen other stars of the era. A clear print, with good sound.
STAN'S HOME MOVIES - Boring silent footage of mostly family and children. Good quality print.
WEST OF HOT DOG (1924) - Laurel comedy. A mulitigenerational grayish copy. Take-off on ""West Of The Pecos.""
MUD & SAND (1922) - Laurel again, as a matador, complete with requisite bullfight climax. Washed out and dark copy.
ORANGES & LEMONS (1923) - Stan once more. Slapstick at a citrus packing operation. Fair quality print.
HOP TO IT BELLHOP (1925) - Ollie with Laurel look-alike Billy Ray, as two clumsy bellhops. Another multigeneration dub.
THE SAWMILL (1921) - Practically unwatchable print. Ollie has a bit part in a lumberjack comedy.
PAPER HANGER'S HELPER (1925) - Just a bad-looking copy.
ENOUGH TO DO (1926) - Stan Laurel Production, starring another actor. Bridge building sillyness.
KID SPEED (1923) - Ollie in support as Dangerous Dan McGraw, in a story of auto racing. Typically washed-out copy.
YES YES NANETTE (1924) - A Laurel-directed Hal Roach short, with a minor league cast and Petey, the mutt from the Our Gang comedies.
FLYING DEUCES (1939) - Another multigeneration, dull & dark dub of a famous L&H movie.
BONUS: LAUREL & HARDY GAG REEL - Not-so-funny snippets from some of the movies on this disc. A fitting close to five hours of disappointment.",1172880000,16,2693,4.852173913043479

It's about how Laurel & Hardy, playing married next door neighbors and Lodge brothers can go to a Lodge convention even though their wives said no.

1898484,4,B00009YXEW,"Go to Amazon.uk and you will find the whole Laurel and Hardy collection (all together or as seperates). There are 21 DVDs in a classy collectable box (DVD 21 is a documentary about the two). The quality is brilliantly restored and has colourised versions as well (may appeal to younger ones).

All the best are here (including early silent ones, extended versions and even some in other languages), apart from The Flying Deuces (made at another studio - MGM I think) and a few of the lesser quality ones (post 40's) which are not as good anyway.

The only problem is that they are Region 2 (PAL) so you may need to get a multiregion DVD player and television that can play PAL.

The cheap DVDs you see around do not contain any of their better stuff (particularly the Hal Roach shorts of around 1930-1940 or the feature films such as Blockheads, Way Out West or Sons of the Desert) but any Laurel and Hardy is worth getting.

The colourised versions are 'television friendly' i.e. with cuts here and there - but it is worth watching them to see Stan's bright red hair and some of the colour tones of the time. However, the black and white versions are by far the best, with clear sharp images (restored) and they remain uncut (Laughing Gravy is on twice, one is extended and has the original ending - a rather grimmer ending at that!).",1133740800,10,1335,4.5041322314049586

of this tour de force, ""City Lights"" did not seem particularly funny to me. So,if your comedic taste demands

genius, by all means take the maudlin road to Chaplin, i.e.,""The Kid."" If, on the other hand, belly laughs galore

are your preference, ""the boys"" (Stan & Ollie) will more than satisfy you--- especially in this

compilation of their most hilarious films (""Sons of the Desert,"" ""The Music Box""), plus other side splitting

gems. Also included is fascinating data on the team and their work, and on Hal Roach, the man who brought them together.

1898489,5,B00009YXEW,"Does anybody not know who Laurel and Hardy are?  Arguably the funniest and most prolific comedy team in movie history - at least I'd defend that argument - Laurel and Hardy were among the few silent slapstick comedians to make a smooth transition to talkies. In fact, they hit their stride and did some of their best work during the sound era.  This disk contains two of their great shorts, `Sons of the Desert' and `The Music Box,' a very good  `Another Fine Mess,' and two very funny, representative two-reelers - `Busy Bodies' and `County Hospital.'

SONS OF THE DESERT (1933 - 65min.)  The boys want to go to a Sons of the Desert convention in Chicago, Mrs. Hardy wants to go to the mountains.  With the aid of a veterinarian Ollie feigns a nervous breakdown and plans a long cruise - with Stanley - to repair his shattered nerves.  Of course, the cruise ship sails to Hawaii at the same time the convention is being held in Chicago....  This one had more belly laughs per minute than anything else I've ever seen.  Best bit - the events that lead Mrs. Hardy (Mae Busch) to angrily call Stanley `wax eater.'

THE MUSIC BOX (1932 - 30min.)  The boys have to deliver a piano-sized music box to a home located at the top of a long flight of steps.  Winner of the Academy Award in 1932 for Best Short Subject, Comedy.  Sisyphus may have made mythic tragedy out of pushing a heavy thing up a hill, but Laurel and Hardy use it to deliver one laugh after another.

ANOTHER FINE MESS (1930 - 28min.) The vagrant boys are chased into a empty mansion by the police.  Colonel Wilburforce Buckshot (James Finlayson) has just that morning left for a six-month safari in South Africa, the maid and butler are out, and Lord and Lady Plumtree arrive to inquire into leasing the mansion while Buckshot is away.  With the police prowling about outside, Stan and Ollie are forced to impersonate the Colonel and staff - Stanley as both butler AND maid - to avoid arousing the suspicions of the Plumtrees.

BUSY BODIES (1933 - 19min.) The boys wreak havoc in a carpenter shop.  As was true in many of their shorts, there's really no plot to this one.  Just one visual gag after another.  It should go without saying that two-reels is more than enough time for Stan and Ollie to raze a carpenter shop.

COUNTY HOSPITAL (1932 - 19min.) Ollie is in the hospital recovering from a broken leg.  Stanley comes to visit him.  Again there's not much plot to speak of here. Ollie's leg is trussed and elevated and it's only a matter of time before Stanley, inadvertently and with the best of intentions, more or less reduces the hospital room to rubble.

 The transfer prints are in okay, although not pristine, condition.  The gags are relentless.  I laughed out loud during every one of these, sometimes so hard that my stomach hurt.  I recommend this disk without reservation.  Laurel and Hardy remain the most likable of all comedians - their real life friendship finds its way into their performances, and it's an embracing type of friendship that somehow we feel we share in.  These are the good ones - no UTOPIAS in the batch - and they should appeal to all ages, although parents of young children may want to explain to their charges that we don't wap our friends with wooden mallets or bust a baby bottle full of milk over someone's head.",1122681600,16,3322,4.543771043771044
1898490,1,B00009YXEW,"It is a shame that American film classics ( like L and H) get more attention and love outside of the US than in it.

I just bought the Universal Laurel and Hardy 21 Volume Box set which is only available in Europe from Amazon UK (region 2). This set is EVERYTHING people are saying it is. It is a complete film history of the boys which starts with the boys early silent films ( some solo efferts) and goes though the Hal Roach Features. All the prints are restored and of pristine quality. A truly beautiful set and a worthy tribute to the boys. There are some missing films ( I assume for copyright reasons) such as Babes in Toyland, The Devils Brother, Bonnie Scotland and Flying Deuces.

To acomadate these DVDs I bought a region free DVD player off Amazon,which is the only way to go if you really want to collect. The DVD player was very cheap, plays beautfully and is well worth the investment. As a side note if you have a region free player all the DVDs in the Universal Box set are also availble as single dics, in case you don't want to spend all the money at once or just want a few of the films.

1898491,5,B00009YXEW,"This is a pretty bad copy of Laurel and Hardy's work. This is what I think the studio should do:

  1. Release all 32 silent shorts that have both Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. BOTH OF THEM. No Charlie Chase shorts with only Hardy; no shorts with just Laurel; BOTH!!! They should put them in chronological order (starting with LUCKY DOG) with four shorts on a DVD. That makes eight DVDs.

  2. Release all 40 sound shorts (chronologically) that have Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. They should release ten DVDs with 4 shorts on each disc.

  3. Release all the full-length movies with Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. They include PARDON US; PACK UP YOUR TROUBLES; THE DEVIL'S BROTHER; SONS OF THE DESERT; BABES IN TOYLAND; BONNIE SCOTLAND; THE BOHEMIAN GIRL; OUR RELATIONS; WAY OUT WEST; SWISS MISS; BLOCK-HEADS; THE FLYING DEUCES; A CHUMP AT OXFORD; SAPS AT SEA; GREAT GUNS; A-HAUNTING WE WILL GO; AIR RAID WARDENS; JITTERBUGS; THE DANCING MASTERS; THE BIG NOISE; THE BULLFIGHTERS; NOTHING BUT TROUBLE; and ATOLL K. Release them separately. One movie a disc.

  4. Release a two disc DVD set of movies that have Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy in only small parts. Such shorts as THE STOOLEN JOOLS; ON THE LOOSE; WILD POSES; ON THE WRONG TREK; and THE TREE IN A TEST TUBE and the full-length movies THE HOLLYWOOD REVUE OF 1929; HOLLYWOOD PARTY; and PICK A STAR.

  5. Each DVD should have trailers of that short or movie (if available), photos, production notes, subtitles in French, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Mexican, and whatever other languages they think the DVDs should have.

  These DVDs should be painstakingly remastered with state-of-the-art technology so that each film has the best sound and picture quality. Also, no sets. We comedy lovers like to chose what movies to watch and not have to buy a whole set (aka: It's a Gift). Also no colorization of any kind.

  So that makes 8 DVDs of their silent shorts, 10 DVDs of their sound shorts, 23 DVDs with their full-length movies, and a two disc DVD set with their short movie appearances.

1898492,3,B00009YXEW,"I looked at the Hallmark dvd and I feel that it is indeed inferior to what one would expect in a restored version. I e-mailed Hallmark and inquired about plans to present the L&H films in the restored manner as described by other customers. I received a brief reply saying that no plans were in the works. Hallmark released two of the former Cabin Fever Little Rascals series but nothing more seems to be forthcoming from that series. Hallmark strikes me as strictly a corporate money maker with no aesthetic appreciation for film history. When Cabin Fever Videos' had releasing rights to the Little Rascals, their lead-in showed an excitement about the product. Hallmark seems customer unfriendly to me and could care less. Why don't they just sell the Laurel and Hardy and The Our Gang rights to someone who would treat these series with the respect they deserve?  I am looking into the German series along with an all-regional dvd player. It is an unfortunate situation especially in the wake of contemporary interest in America's film heritage.",1112745600,14,1048,4.887640449438202
1898493,1,B00009YXEW,"I never thought I would see the day that I would rate any product that contained the greatest film comedy team of all time,Laurel and Hardy,with just one star!!
But it seems Hallmark has managed to elevate banality,mediocrity and utter codswollop to an entirely new level.
And it is with no small sense of regret that I have to say this.
I have seen most of these films in their European release formats and to say these Hallmark versions are far inferior to those would be an understatement. The European mindsets' credo generally seems to be when releasing anything whether it be audio or visual to obtain the best possible sources from which to work with then do the necessary work in order to release the best possible product that you can. All related North American industries should have taken a page from their book YEARS ago!
Here are just a few examples of what I have noticed in this Hallmark DVD:
All of these prints seem to be incomplete and the original elements used are average to worse in condition. No effort it seems was used at all to obtain the best possible negatives from which to work from. And what ""work"" has been done is strictly basic digital transfer with a slight alteration for contrast. In other words the films look a little better than their VHS counterparts but countless imperfections of all sorts run rampant throughout ALL of these pictures and have astoundingly not been corrected in any way.
'Sons of the Desert' does not contain the original MGM opening(with lion roar and music....the same for most)and it inexplicably has fade outs for what appears to be commercial breaks!! I can only surmise that this print originated from some TV showing in days past. Now that's quality!
'County Hospital' gives us a print of the ""Film Classics"" 50s version complete with the opening ""plaque"".
'The Music Box' has a horizontal tape glitch line(!) running from bottom to top just as Stan opens the back of the wagon near the beginning of the film.
The rest of the shorts are again totally average in their transfers and quality.
Let me state clearly that ALL of Laurel and Hardy product that is extant is available in its' original theatrical format(i.e.as orginally seen) with proper opening sequences intact and
accompanying music. So there is no excuse whatsoever that Hallmark would/should release an INFERIOR product such as this.
And although I sympathize with those who have longed for The Boys to be released onto DVD(I am one of those!) there is no way we should just en masse accept anything that is thrown at us. We as consumers,not to mention the men who made these wonderful films,deserve nothing short of the best,and that is FAR from what we got.
In conclusion this release shows what is wrong,has been wrong,with the entire audio/video industry for much too long a period in North America. Inferior product foisted on an unsuspecting public either through faulty/inferior manufacturing or,as in this case,just plain indifference. It is about time we became more pro active
about this multi-billion dollar a year industry who without OUR hard earned money/support would go nowhere fast.
We should not accept such tripe as this Hallmark release and as such they deserve our utter contempt.
Stan Laurel when alive could not stand to watch his films when run on TV because of them being cut to fit time restraints. I shudder to think what he would think of this release of his films. These men deserve so much BETTER!",1112572800,23,3459,4.805369127516778

1898495,3,B00009YXEW,"I was pleased to find a Laurel and Hardy DVD being offered as you really don't find too many ""out there"", at least here in the states.

However, in spite of the fact that the disc cover promotes these films as being digitally remastered...they arent. I think MANY companies use this term a little too liberally. Transferring a film to DVD, doesn't automatically make it digitally enhanced or digitally remastered.

The L&H shorts chosen for this DVD all had a fuzzy look to them...far from what is considered pristine. The sound well, this WAS back in the early 1930's. I could've accepted a little hiss if the picture itself had been sharper. The original Hal Roach negatives for these shorts exist and should have been utilized. Cabin Fever Entertainment did and AWESOME job with it's Little Rascals VHS release several years ago. Those prints (from original Hal Roach negatives) looked GREAT !!!  Why couldn't Hallmark have done the same ??

I gave this DVD three stars for Laurel and Hardy's entertainment alone, these guys gave it their all in these shorts. The enclosed extras weren't too bad either. It would have been 5 stars if Hallmark had lived up to their end of the bargain and given us sharp prints.

Buy this DVD if you're a REAL Laurel and Hardy fan, but don't expect too much and don't pay too much for it either. I only spent $11.00 US dollars for it and feel it's not worth more than that.",1107561600,11,1408,4.616

1898497,5,B00009YXEW,"Anyone familiar with and repulsed by today's TV and film ""comedies"" will find this DVD such a breath of fresh air. I hadn't seen Laurel and Hardy since I was a child 60 years ago. It was quite an experience to encounter their hilarious comedy routines again and to realize how their genius, as seen just in this DVD, planted the seeds for the likes of the Three Stooges, Lucy and Desi and Jackie Gleason's Honeymooners.  The ""Music Box"", in itself, makes this DVD a must-see to brighten anyone's day.  So the sound quality was not up to today's standards, but who cares?  If you concentrate on the humor, you'll never notice the technical flaws.  Besides, that's how audiences heard them during that era.",1105401600,,704,4.653225806451613
1898498,4,B00009YXEW,"Without a doubt, I enjoyed every minute of the four short subjects and single feature film included here. Laurel and Hardy were at their creative peak in the early 1930s and this DVD captures them at the height of their powers. Buster Keaton can be baroque, Mr. Bean can be devilish, and Jackie Chan can be acrobatic, but absolutely no slapstick comedians could ever duplicate the otherworldly innocence of Laurel and Hardy. They're truly timeless, and all of the material presented here is priceless. It's a treat to see something other than awful public domain footage of them on DVD at last. And, it's a pleasure to see their classic short subject ""The Music Box"" once again. It's a real treasure.

However . . . despite what the box says about being ""digitally remastered"" I see no evidence of remastering. The sound clicks and pops just like it did on the old VHS' I remember. The picture quality isn't the sharpest. It isn't a step back, mind you, and it's always good to have films in the relatively permanent DVD format, but this isn't what most people think of when they think of digital remastering. I also had problems with the DVD menuing system used here; compared to what Universal's used for their multi-film packages, this DVD is rather cumbersome. The extras are adequate; nothing to get excited over but nothing awful either.

There are no subtitles. I was very surprised at this. As a rule, DVDs have subtitles for at least one language. Considering Laurel and Hardy's multi-national appeal, the lack of subtitles is a drawback. Also, I'm assuming this is an item that an older crowd would especially enjoy, and older persons who are hard-of-hearing rely on subtitles to fully enjoy their DVDs.

True, the price is definitely right for the collection, unlike the recent Marx Brothers boxed set from Paramount, which features an equally questionable ""remastering."" Buy this DVD for the exceptional laughs that Laurel and Hardy's hijinks provide, but don't expect this to be a gloriously refurbished product.",1105228800,5,2025,4.915204678362573
1898499,2,B00009YXEW,"I found this DVD to be almost entirely devoid of laughs.  There were a few genuinely funny moments - the boys breaking into a dance routine as they clear up a mess, Stan Laurel impersonating a maid, the nanny complaining that she was kicked ""right in the middle of my daily duties"".  But on the whole, I was left wondering why these routines were ever considered entertaining.  The jokes are repetitive, milked to death, and often seem to involve little more than Oliver Hardy being in physical pain (ha ha, Ollie sat in boiling water, ha ha, Ollie got crushed under a piano, ha ha, Ollie stepped on a nail).  Also, apart from the two leads, almost no-one on this DVD shows signs of being able to act.  Yes, I know that these old Hal Roach comedies had to be produced quickly and cheaply, but that doesn't make them any funnier to watch.  Frankly, I was bored, and that is the only test that matters.

  Just to establish my credentials, this review isn't simply the reaction of a man who doesn't like physical comedy - I'll laugh at Charlie Chaplain, Buster Keaton and Rowan Atkinson's Mr. Bean.  Nor is it the reaction of a man who can't laugh at old non-physical comedy - I'll laugh at The Marx Brothers.  But I didn't laugh at this.  I tried.  But I didn't.

  If you enjoy the Three Stooges, Abbot and Costello, or fat men hurting their bottoms again and again, you may find this DVD hilarious.",1097798400,4,1399,4.448818897637795
1898500,5,B00009YXEW,"Film content descriptions of Laurel and Hardy`s films are unecessary and have been done many times by many people. As has been said there are several versions of the `boy`s` films available throughout the world. All of the sound films of Hal Roach apart from ` Fra Diavolo` enjoyed extensive restoration in Europe several years ago.  All of the silents have received similar treatment in the US under the `Lost Films` series.

The point of this contribution is to remind you that Amazon is an international treasure trove of dvd versions from which you can select the best of the best.

I have utilised Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk for many years selecting the fruits of these films.  For example I have collected the wonderfully restored silents from Amazon.com and the collection of 21, yes 21, dvds of superb sound films from Amazon.co.uk.

Therefore use Amazon as the excellent international source it is and ensure you have the best versions of any film virtually anywhere in the world.

One little tip when buying from Amazon UK you will need to have a multiregion DVD  player and a TV capable of handling the Pal (UK) system.

So I was happy to come across this and own it now. I am happy with the picture and sound. And that classic ""Sons of the Desert"" all by itself is worth the price.  The U.S. does not give Laurel and Hardy the attention they deserve in terms of DVD releases. Why is it that so much more of their work is available overseas then here, when they are American film icons? I don't have the surplus cash to invest in a DVD player to play overseas DVDs, but its not a bad idea.",1092960000,,628,4.024
1898503,2,B00009YXEW,"For those who have never been able to enjoy these films except on LP-mode VHS tapes, this is a treat.

 However, for those of us who have seen these films for years on 16mm Blackhawk prints, then VHS, then 3M laserdiscs, this DVD is a serious step backward in the technology's potential. The ""TV"" print of ""Sons Of The Desert"" is abysmal, as has been stated many times before, and rather than source out the best materials for a proper presentation, all the shorts are old videotape transfers.

 Just because Hallmark owns the rights the the product, don't expect them to throw away money to make this a product heads above the PD material you can buy at any Wal-Mart for $5 bucks. Their purchase of the rights to the prime Laurel & Hardy and Little Rascals materials from Cabin Fever is simply a leverage move. Where are all those pristine Litlle Rascals videos hosted by Leonard Maltin now?

 The British DVD's are far better (go to amazon.co.uk and see for yourself). Invest in a multi-region player or region-free software for your computer and watch these (albeit sped-up PAL versions) in all their visual glory. EVERY feature and sound short is available.

 I was so disappointed in this DVD that I went to a well-known auction and bought out-of-print 3M laserdiscs of these titles and they look so much better than the Hallmark DVD. Thanks to a digital camcorder with an A/V input and professional video software, I now have DVD's that put the Hallmark disc to shame!",1091404800,12,1474,4.686046511627907

But at least the prints of MUSIC BOX and COUNTY HOSPITAL have some of that crisp sunny look that one also associates with the best prints of silent comedies[especially in the Robert Youngson complilations.]I think the exteriors on HOSPITAL are brighter than they were on the 80's LAUREL AND HARDY SHOW package,and the greys are pretty good for a Film Classics print. BUSY BODIES is dark in comparison,but at least it's better than those contrasty 16MM prints that were once the norm. I think that the transfer of MUSIC BOX is the one prepared by Janus in 1978 for public TV,because I recall being struck by the clear sound quality[hiss notwithstanding]and this is duplicated on the DVD.I would love to find out why the Kirsch group restorations were not used.

1898508,3,B00009YXEW,"This collection of Laurel and Hardy films contains five total selections.  Four of these are short films (about thirty minutes in length), while the fifth is a full-length feature (about an hour long).  It's a fun set of material; nothing outrageously wonderful, but it's all quite entertaining.  Here are some quick comments on each of the movies:
Music Box -- Ah, who among us hasn't at one time or another had to carry a heavy and bulky item through a maze of difficult obstacles.  Most of us probably have, but I doubt many have caused quite as much destruction (or has had much fun) as Laurel and Hardy in this film.  Winner of that year's Academy Award, and it's an honor that is well earned.
Another Fine Mess -- The opening to this one is surreal.  Instead of a written listing of credits, a pair of identical twin blondes dressed as page boys come out and recite the credits orally.  Kitsch city!  The short itself is fairly amusing.  The boys end up impersonating the occupants of a stately home in entertaining fashion.  Hardy becomes the rich owner, while Laurel dresses up as both the butler and the maid.
Busy Bodies --  Never mind the Star Trek technology that is slowly entering reality -- Laurel and Hardy listen to records in their car years before the first onboard CD player is invented!  There's good potential for gags here; the boys are working at a woodworking factory (it looks like your high school shop class).
Country Hospital -- This time Laurel and Hardy are creating havoc at (you guessed it) a country hospital.  Fairly run of the mill stuff here, but the sequence of an anesthetized Laurel driving through the city streets (courtesy of a hilariously bad back screen projection technique) is impossible not to laugh at.
Sons of the Desert --  The disc's only feature-length selection.  This, along with most of the selections on this disc, has some good moments, and some bad moments.  There's a gag involving a pair of adjacent doors that just goes on for too long.  On the other hand, there are some hilarious sequences of Laurel and Hardy going to extremes to keep the truth about their vacation from their wives.
Many of the jokes don't seem to have dated terribly well.  This isn't really the fault of Laurel and Hardy though; after all, they weren't to know that generations of comedians would be stealing material from them.  Because of that borrowing, a lot of this disc may seem familiar even if you've never seen a second of Laurel and Hardy before.
Hardcore fans of Laurel and Hardy may complain that the image and sound quality of this disc is not as good as it could be.  They're right, of course, but that shouldn't affect most of us who are just looking for some fun from the bungling but well-meaning pair of comedians.  This disc isn't what I would describe as a ""must own"", although I'm certainly not unhappy that I bought it.  It makes for a nice change of pace from today's comedies.  It's nice to have something to watch with the younger (and older) members of the family that is actually funny in its own right.",1070150400,6,3065,4.614391143911439

NO MORE ""FLYING DEUCES"" AND ""UTOPIA"" RELEASES!!!!!!!!!)",1069200000,,353,4.9
1898510,5,B00009YXEW,"There are a number of Laurel & Hardy DVD's out there and many of them are not so good, featuring them in some of their latest, and sadly, weakest works (Utopia, Air Raid Wardens etc.).  This DVD is not only excellent quality, it has some of Laurel & Hardy's strongest works.

It includes ""The Music Box"", which deservedly won the Oscar in 1932 for best comedy short. In it L&H spend the day taking a piano to the top of an unbelieveably long flight of stairs. You remember! What a hoot!.

It also contains another of their feature length films, ""Sons of the Desert.""  In it Hardy fools his wife into thinking he and Stanley are taking an ocean voyage to Hawaii for his health while they in reality are going off to revel at the Sons of the Desert convention in Chicago. Check out Stan lounging at Oliver's house surreptitiously eating his third piece of waxed fruit in the past month. Mrs. Hardy wondered where her living room fruit display had been going. They are at their best.

 The three remaining, shorter works ""Another Fine Mess"", ""Busy Bodies"" and ""County Hospital"" are also very well done with L&H both being in their comedic prime  particularly in the first two.  The DVD also contains some nice extras including a location tour of some of the sites for their early movies as well as biographical information.  It's great for L& H fans.

I hope someone comes out with another DVD with some of their other best works, like ""Block Heads.""  I also wish that those who sell the DVD's (like AMAZON!!) would not simply list ""Laurel and Hardy volume XX"" as the title, but would make it easier to discover WHICH of their films are included on that DVD (i.e. the dog ""Utopia"" or the gem ""Music Box""). Look at the listings. It 's almost impossible to easily discern which is contained. Since Laurel and Hardy never made a film titled ""Boxed Set volume 6"" we need more information!!

1898511,5,B00009YXEW,"""The Boys"" as Stan Laurel & Oliver Hardy were affectionately called are finally on DVD thanks to Artisan Home Entertainment.  Artisan does a grand job bringing us 5 of The Boys 100 movies to this Digitally Remastered DVD. Including their only Oscar film performance in ""The Music Box (1932)"".
Hal Roach introduced these two comedic genius' in 1926 from then on for the next 25 years they charmed us with 100 films.  These timeless comedy feature films (greater than 60 minutes)and shorts have been enjoyed by millions and generation after generation have laughed endlessly.  Even today after 50 years since their last film scores of die hard fans gather monthly to share the joy of this teams genius.  The ""Sons of the Desert"" Tent Society/club named after one of Laurel & Hardy (L&H)finest movies (included in this marvelous DVD) is a world wide organization. Each ""TENT"" (there are hundreds) is named after one of their films or significant film event.  Some of these ""Tents"" are listed  in the Special Features.
Summary:  These films are presented beautifully on this DVD with digitalized picture & sound.  ""The Sons of the Desert"" is their most famous feature film.  L&H belong to this exclusive boys club (spin off of the Shriners)of the movie title name.  They need to go to the annual convention but must go on a planned vacation with their wives.  L&H now come up with the perfect scam to get to the convention.  But as all Laurel & Hardy comedies all things go haywire and we laugh endlessly to their predictable fate.  ""The Music Box"" is their only Oscar winning film short.  L&R go into business as movers.  Stairs & piano provide us with the hilarity.  ""Another Fine Mess"" This phrase was used by Ollie frequently in L&H movies.  Escaping from the police our hereos seek refuge in a mansion & as only the boys can do end up as butler, maid & owner (briefly).  ""Busy Bodies"" L&H work as construction factory assembly workers.  In a very short time they destroy the place innocently only as the boys can.  Finally ""County Hospital"" Ollie is in the hospital bed with a full leg cast recouperating.  Along comes Stan for an innocent visit.  You can only imagine what happens?  This is a funny short.
Special Features:  Artisan does a great job giving us background information of ""The Boys"".  Key to Laughter Tribute - several stars comment on L&H genius & timeless comedy.  Then And Now Tour - Culver City pictorial of Hal Roach Studios, famous L&H film locations then and now.  Hal Roach Articles, Photo Montage, Tent Sites and Biographies of Stan Laurel, Oliver Hardy & Hal Roach.
This is a great DVD for everyone who loves timeless comedy and to watch one of the greatest comedy teams ever.  Enjoy.",1067126400,4,2710,4.745182012847966
1898512,3,B00009YXEW,"The newest video offering of Laurel & Hardy by Artisan Home Entertainment is reason to celebrate despite some disappointment. The digitally remastered DVD disc provides beautiful transfers of The Music Box, Another Fine Mess, Busy Bodies, & County Hospital. It appears that the same restored source material that was used by RHI, broadcast on American Movie Classics during the mid 1990's, was used. The picture is sharp with stunning contrast. Two audio options are offered -  Original 1.0 Dolby Monoral or Restored 2.0 Dolby Monoral Audio. I was not able to notice any difference in comparing the 2 audio options on my home theatre system but assume that the latter option is supposed to have less pops and hiss when played through a traditional television set. The ""Restored"" feature lists a warning - ""Due To The Age of the original audio there are areas of poor quality and/or missing sound"". Enough said. I'll stick to the original sound that I'm accustomed to.
Unfortunately, neither audio option can help the sound or image of Sons of the Desert as presented on this disc. Artisan has chosen  (or given by Hallmark) completely inappropriate material to transfer from. They have used a television master from the 1980's complete with commercial fade out/fade in's intact and ""new"" recordings  of Leroy Shield music inserted to underscore scenes where ther has been no musical score before. The music used is obviously from  album's recorded by Ronnie Hazelhurst entitled  Laurel & Hardy Music Box Vol. I & II. Scott MacGillivray has pointed out to me that this version of Sons of the Desert is several minutes shorter than the original release length with the ""Wax Fruit"" footage and ""Chicago Convention Opening Montage"" being expertly edited so that they are not missed to the casual fan. Other trims are not obvious and the film is still extremely entertaining for anyone who has not seen this film before. The quality of the picture is very disappointing, espescially for those of us fortunate enough to see how beautiful the European release DVD of Sons of the Desert is.
Special Features on this disc include King of Laughter Tribute - a 10 minute excerpt from a longer Hal Roach Documentary broadcast in the early 1990's on The Disney Channel. The excerpt praises Hal Roach, rightfully so. Unfortunately, some of what is said by the narrator is misleading or incorrect. ""Hal Roach taught Laurel & Hardy how to improvise"" & ""how to milk a gag"" are 2 such inaccuracies. The documentary also states that Roach made a conscious effort ""trying to clean up Hollywood's image"". They demonstrate this with a scene from Block Heads - 4 years after the Production Code went into effect. Ridiculous! There are some very nice clips from 10 Laurel & Hardy films and very nice words from Dom Deluise, Steve Allen, Mel Brooks, and John Hughes.
Hal Roach Articles is a reprinted article by Cliff Barr from 1987 entitled Movie Mogul Still Drinks and Loves The Ladies - At 95! The article is factual and celebrates Hal Roach and his career. It was very nice to read.
Then & Now Location Tour provides pictures of the Studio and what is currently sitting on that property. Also included are then and now looks at The Music Box Steps & The County Hospital.
We also see Stan & Babe's gravesite and Babe's more prominent monument erected by the Sons.
Photo Montage provides a slideshow of movie stills - 12 from Sons of the Desert. 6 from The Music Box, 8 from County Hospital, 6 from Busy Bodies, 5 from Another Fine Mess, 12 Hal Roach stills, and a final 2 stills of starlets that I cannot identify. The slideshow is underscored by an audio track of Marvin Hatley's Honolulu Baby as heard on the S.O.D. soundtrack - the opening title music from The Music Box - and a blues piece that suggests late '50's New Orleans to my ears.
Some of the stills were new to me. To check how unique some stills were, I showed the montage to two knowledgeable Sons, Gregg Hammond and Jack Roth. Both agreed that they were seeing some of these stills for the first time.
Tent Societies is a supposed to be a partial listing of Sons of the Desert Tents. 11 Tents are listed but only 6 Tents listed are currently active. They do instruct the viewer to use his or her internet server's search engine to find a tent in their  area.
The Main Menu and lead-ins into the individual films are artistically accomplished except for the Menu background music being 10 times louder than the films soundtrack. The viewer quickly learns to lower the volume quickly during the end title or be blasted  by music as the player returns you to the Main Menu.
Despite all the disappintments that I've pointed out, let me once again state how beautiful the four short subjects looked. The DVD lists for only $19.98 and comes highly recomended and seems to be a perfect gift for friends and family. I also encourage everyone who buys this DVD and agrees with my opinion - please mail your comments to Hallmark and Artisan so that we might enjoy future volumes without the problems of this current offering.",1064620800,16,5059,4.735527809307605

Some of the best-loved comedies of all time, the greatest comedy duo in the history of movies, and new digital technology to make it all seem like new. In Germany, two dozen DVDs of Laurel & Hardy sound and silent masterpieces have been restored, remastered, and released to great success. Hallmark (current owners of the Hal Roach films) had no interest in releasing them stateside, but apparently the entreaties of classic comedy lovers made them cough up this release. So what did we get? Barely adequate transfers from 20-year-old video (not digital) masters. Inserted ""fade outs"" where the extra commercials went for TV showings. Re-release credits instead of the often brilliant original opening credits. In short, Hallmark/Artisan used the least amount of effort, time and expense possible to release these films to the home market. This release should rival the much-talked-about Charlie Chaplin reissue of a couple of months ago, instead it was tossed onto the market with no care or thought. Shame on them.
So, L&H fans are faced with a dilemma: purchase the disc and hope Hallmark does better next time, or ignore it and get an all-region player to buy the German discs. My advice? Shop at amazon.de.",1063929600,181,1255,5.009569377990431

Even worse, ""The Music Box"" has an unforgivable transfer glitch at the beginning that should have been fixed. By comparison, ""Busy Bodies,"" ""Another Fine Mess"" and ""County Hospital"" look pretty good, yet the latter short doesn't include the original Hal Roach opening credits!

When you compare this DVD with the quality of the ""Lost Films"" DVD's. It's to bad the same people did not restore the sound films as well.

The best, most beloved comedy team of all time made about 100 films in 25 years.  Laurel & Hardy, Volume 1 (Artisan) is a single disc with five digitally re-mastered (e-wash, audio fixes and signal corrections) titles.

Stan Laurel was a genius, it's said he could stand still in front of a night club audience and bring them to screaming hysterics without saying a word.

1898518,1,B00009YXEW,"These movies have obviously been dubbed from 16mm reduction prints!  Notice in ""The Music Box"" a bar of distortion appears horizontally across the screen then moves upwards.  This sort of distortion only appears on video tape!  What you have here is a third generation dub!  From 16mm reduction to video (for television distribution) to DVD.  The feature ""Sons of the Desert"" fades out and back in a regular intervals for the nonexistant commercial breaks!  It's not only irritating but disappointing as well since Edie Adams never materializes to pitch Muriel Cigars and no glimpse of Barbara Feldon to lustily entice me to shave closer with Gillette!
Any apologist who says, ""well, they look good considering they're 70 years old!"" ought to see some of the older silent comedies Kino International has on DVD duped from original 35mm negatives!  The contrast is sharp, no scratches and no video distortion. What Hallmark has done is absolutely criminal in my view.  It's like painting a moustache on the Mona Lisa!",1062460800,25,1016,5.041916167664671
1898519,5,B00009YXEW,"I just opened my new copy of Artisan/FHE/Hallmark's ""Laurel And Hardy"" compilation DVD and must congratulate the companies involeved in putting together an absolutely first rate disc!
From what I've read from other reveiws, the feature film Sons Of The Desert presented here is from a TV version, but for me it is just the way I remember seeing it, and the picture has been sustantially cleaned up since the poor VHS releases in the 80s. All of the films here have been given relatively ""clean"" audio remasters, which do not add any extra and unwanted sound effects and have been kept in their original mono format without trying for any fake stereo seperation. In addition, the original mono tracks with all the pops intact have also been included, which do have slightly more dynamics in the top range.
The films presented are some of The Boys' best - the main feature Sons Of The Desert being a good first choice for inclusion. Their Academy Award-winning The Music Box is a perhaps obvious but nonetheless welcome inclusion, while Busy Bodies and Another Fine Mess were two of my favorites that I used to watch on 8mm film with my Dad in the late 1970s. He's not around any more, so it was with mixed emotions that I sat and watched these again - but the magic of Stan And Ollie is simply undeniable.
The final short, County Hospital, was one that I did not recall straight away, but features the usual mix of clever dialogue and slapstick that we have come to expect from Laurel And Hardy. What would be great to hear from Artisan/FHE/Hallmark is if they have plans to issue a series and what titles we can expect from them.
Unlike Chaplin, Laurel And Hardy's films have never gotten the home video respect they deserve. Unfortunately, they were working for somebody else - Hal Roach - and were one of a few acts that made movies there, unlike Chaplin who owned his negatives, which have been preserved over the years. The Stan And Ollie films have changed hands on a number of occaisions, from theatrical re-issues and TV sales, and a number of home video incarnations that have done nothing to restore any remaining negatives.
While this edition only features remastered prints as opposed to a complete digital restoration, these are the best these films have looked and sounded in decades. This collection is very recommedned to fans of Laurel And Hardy, as well as those interested in the short comedy film format, and comedy fans in general. The presentations are great for their age and history and as I said above, Artisan/FHE/Hallmark should be congratulated on putting together a first class disc.
Most surprising was the addition of a few special features. I thought that one full feature and four shorts was quite enough, but the distributors have taken it upon themselves to add a ten-minute study of Stan And Ollie's comedy by several top names in this field (Dom DeLuise, Mel Brooks, John Hughes) as well as a ""location tour"" (stills of several locations as seen in the films and how they look nowadays), Fan society contacts, and biographies for Stan, Ollie and Hal Roach. As if this is not enough, each film (including the shorts) have between five and ten chapter indexes for locating favorite scenes!
All in all, my five stars are for the overall presentation and assembly of the disc. The menus are very much in keeping with the title cards from the films, and the animations between menus were just a delightful added bonus - especially the one for Busy Bodies - just terrific! As I say, these are not the absolutely definitive digital restorations, but since that does not look likely anyway, these are the best way to see these films.
I have a number of tapes featuring Laurel And Hardy, including earlier incarantions of a couple of these films. This disc is the best I have seen these films look and should belong to every Stan And Ollie fan. The tearaway security strip along the top made mention of ""Volume 1"" - let's hope that this sells well enough for the companies to continue the series with quite a few new volumes to come!
Once more, a fine looking mess they've gotten themselves into, courtesy of some long awaited and much deserved care and attention finally given to them by the creators of this disc. More, please!!",1062460800,,4257,4.700133868808567
1898520,4,B00009YXEW,"While there are some obvious flaws in the choices Hallmark ( where are you MGM?!!)  made in regard to the source materials, the content, of course is impeccable. Putting aside the brilliant sight gags, it is always amazing to watch two men being so wonderfully, purely and gut-bustingly funny. Despite having seen these films dozens of times, I was particularly bowled over by the nuances Stan and Ollie brought to these two characters. In a era, where - in some lesser circles - the word ""genius"" is applied to the work of the Three Stooges, this DVD is a welcome reminder of true artistry. Shoddy treatment by corporate media types can't dim this.
Where Hallmark/Artisan truly stumble is in the features. Apparently Hal Roach was still alive during the DVD's production (when did they start this thing?) and the narration goes to great pains to emphasize Roach's contribution, as if he also wrote and directed the Laurel & Hardy films. Roach may have provided them with a nuturing workplace, but it was Stan Laurel who was the real creative force behind the team. Anybody who knows anything about film comedy is aware of this.
This might have been mentioned, but the breathless narration, (which was apparently written by a Hallmark administrative assistant who knew nothing about Laurel & Hardy) was  too busy stressing their ""wholesomeness."" The fact is that Stan & Ollie are not some sort of kiddie act, but important comic artists who deserve serious and respectful documentation. Get a clue Hallmark.",1062201600,2,1507,4.952569169960475
1898521,5,B00009YXEW,"I grew up on Laurel and Hardy, so as funny as it may sound coming from a 21-year-old, I found myself getting nostalgic watching these old movies.  I was worried about this particular release, since I had heard mixed things about it, but I knew I would have to purchase it anyway and find out for myself.
The buzz has been that Sons of the Desert has been edited.  This is a partially true claim that is pretty misleading.  It does appear that this was a ""TV version,"" and there are clear fade outs and fade ins for commercials.  It appeared that the entire film was there, though.  However, after watching the DVD I compared it with my old VHS just to be sure, and the entire movie is here.  Curiously, background music has been added to Ollie's ""nervous shakedown"" scene.  This music was not in the original version, but does really add or take away anything from the movie.
The fade outs are a little annoying, and the addition of the music to one scene seems pointless, but this should please everybody but the most stubborn of purists.  Sons of the Desert is probably Laurel and Hardy's best feature.
The Music Box and County Hospital are two of their best shorts, as well.  Another Fine Mess and Busy Bodies were never my favorites, but they are amusing nonetheless.  The DVD case claims that these films have been ""digitally rematered.""  There is still quite a bit of hissing and crackling on the audio, particularly on The Music Box and County Hospital.  After comparing the DVD with the VHS of Sons of the Desert, the picture seems cleaned up a little, but neither the the audio or video is ""remastered"" enough to blow your socks off.  Still, this is a fun edition to own.  The special features are brief but fun.
I'll give it four and a half stars, and round it up to five.  Probably not the outstanding edition that die-hard fans were waiting for, but it's much better than not having them on DVD.  Let's hope that more volumes will follow.",1062028800,7,1950,4.497159090909091
1898522,3,B00009YXEW,"It is wonderful that they finally brought out Music Box and some other favourites in DVD .
I would love to see Laurel and Hardy's Murder Case. Oliver the 8th, Dirty Work, The Live Ghost and Swiss Miss come out in DVD.
These are wonderful shorts and a movie.",1061942400,,257,4.26530612244898
1898523,5,B00009YXEW,"This is an excellent DVD. Please buy it so that Hallmark will release the rest of the shorts!

1898524,5,B00009YXEW,"Somewhere I saw stated that this is volume one, which hopefully means more are on the way.  These are some of the best transfers of these classic comedys I've ever seen.  I give a lot of credit to whomever put this together, as they did a superb job, and it looked more like a labor of love rather than another attempt to cash in on the greatest comedy duo of all time.
The films are sharp and crisp, and about as good as you can expect from source material that's about 70 years old.  There is two audio tracks available, original and enhanced (which I think means cleaned up a little).  There are also some fine extra features including a short retrospective of Hal Roach and the duo with narative by Mel Brooks, Dom DeLuise, and John Hughes, a comparative look at the locations using photos of the past and present where some of these movies were made that was very interesting, a still gallery with excellent photos, and fairly thorough yet concise biographies of Stan, Ollie, and Hal Roach.  The menus are set up beautifully, including chapter stops.  Even the text is in the classic art deco style from the period.  My only minor little gripe is some of the text a little smaller than I would like, making it hard to read.
There are five features included, starting with 'Sons of the Desert' which runs a little over an hour.  The rest are shorter features, but, in total, you are getting close to three hours of stuff here, and it's definately worth the price.
My favorite feature on here is 'The Music Box' in which Stan and Ollie are movers and have to lug a piano up a huge flight of stairs.  This particular feature won an academy award in 1932.
I give this set my highest recommendation, for what it's worth.",1061942400,4,1720,4.452229299363057
1898525,4,B00009YXEW,"Artisan presents its first Laurel & Hardy DVD, containing vintage material produced in the 1930s by Hal Roach. Laurel & Hardy fans have been waiting for this release, and this writer's reaction is mixed.

""Sons of the Desert"" is a genuine comedy classic, with Stan and Ollie sneaking off to a lodge convention without telling their wives. But beware the DVD's claim of ""digitally remastered"" -- this version was broadcast on TV's ""Laurel & Hardy Show"" in pre-digital 1986. The film is incomplete, with edited scenes (the ""wax fruit"" and ""convention"" are shortened), overdubbed background music, and frequent fade-outs for commercial breaks. The editing is good, so casual fans and general audiences will enjoy the feature, but dyed-in-the-wool Laurel & Hardy admirers will resent all the tampering.

The DVD's featurettes and short subjects have better picture quality, and appear to be taken from excellent 35mm and 16mm prints. ""Another Fine Mess"" (vagrants Stan and Ollie pose as butler and householder to escape the police) is the 1990s restoration that aired on the AMC cable network; it has the original Hal Roach titles and is superior to older video and TV editions. ""The Music Box"" (the team's Oscar-winner where the boys move a piano up a long flight of steps) and ""Busy Bodies"" (Stan and Ollie in a carpentry shop) are also fine presentations. ""County Hospital"" (visitor Stan ruins patient Ollie's hospital stay) is taken from a 1940s ""Film Classics"" reissue print but the quality is equally good.

This writer noticed a very occasional light scratch or stray debris in the image, but the flaws are minor and should not detract from your enjoyment unless you are a perfectionist. The menus and bonus features use some clever optical effects.

Too bad Artisan hadn't consulted a better print of ""Sons of the Desert,"" or paid more attention to the transfer, but it's great to have this choice material on DVD at all. Here's hoping Artisan will continue its Laurel & Hardy series.",1061769600,43,1988,5.015151515151516
1898526,4,B00009YXEW,"First let me say that these films are the BEST that Laurel & Hardy ever did, they are ***** films!  I was excited to get this DVD, finally we were going to see the great restoration work that was done in Europe and sold on DVD there.
I have seen their DVDs, and this is NOT the restored version!
Problem 1)  Over compression causes digital artifacting that makes SONS OF THE DESERT look like VHS at times. The transfer is the old grainy U.S. TV tape.
Problem 2)  THE MUSIC BOX is compressed from a damaged video tape, there are wrinkles that appear as the boys are unloading the piano.
Problem 3)  COUNTY HOSPITAL is a grainy copy from the Film Classics re-issue negative.  The European DVD is authored from the original MGM issue negative. Leo the lion roars a greating to you to let you know that Europeans are about to see a fine transfer.  In the U.S., our DVD only has the soundtrack of the roars over the grainy re-issue titles.
Problem 4)  BUSY BODIES, while it does have the nice original MGM titles, is grainier than the European restored release.
On a slightly positive note, ANOTHER FINE MESS did not undergo restoration in Europe, so their version looks as grainy as ours. It does have the original title section with the two girls reciting the credits.
There is a fair documetary that used grainy clips from other shorts not on this collection (giving us a preview of how bad the future DVDs might be) and some nice stills showing you some locations as they look today.
Hopefully Artisan & Hallmark will re-master this DVD so that those without access to the European DVDs can enjoy these five classic movies the way they were meant to be seen: sharp without artifacting, on two discs.",1061769600,227,1698,4.529411764705882
1898527,5,B00009YXEW,"Like most baby boomers, I grew up with Laurel and Hardy -- at least the Film Classics versions of their Hal Roach shorts ""as seen on TV"".
I loved ""the boys"", of course, but envied my father (also a great fan) who told me often, ""you should have seen these two-reelers on the big screen when they were new.""  The TV prints, run once too many times through a station's film chain, left much to be desired.
During the 1970's, many Laurel and Hardy films were available as 8mm prints from the legendary Blackhawk Films. As a young man I bought a Super 8mm sound projector -- at great expense -- and collected many of the Blackhawk releases -- at even greater expense -- just so I could enjoy Stan and Ollie's work on my own little version of a big screen.
Eventually, the projector, the films and my interest went into long-term storage, but I never lost affection for Laurel and Hardy. A few years ago as I waddled into middle age, nostalgia took a toe-hold and I purchased a few VHS copies of the Roach studio shorts. Mostly what I got were bad video dubs of ragged prints with soundtracks that sounded like a distant AM radio station signal during a fierce thunderstorm. Mostly what I got was disappointed.
So, as soon as I saw this DVD advertised, I pre-ordered it and waited with no small bit of anticipation for its arrival. I have not been disappointed. While the quality of the presentation -- the ""feature"" add-ons and clarity of the films themselves -- is not astonishing, this DVD is a vast improvement over any previous video release of these wonderful entertainments. The picture quality is very good; much better than VHS. The soundtrack -- digitally reworked and cleaned up -- is even better.
The selection of films is decent. ""Sons of the Desert"", of course, is an acknowledged favorite and ""The Music Box"", is arguably the best of the L&H ""talkie"" shorts. The others: ""Another Fine Mess"", ""Busy Bodies"" and ""County Hospital"" are fine, though not necessarily part of a ""best of"" collection. Hope springs eternal, though, so I take this good but not great selection (and their alphabetical order) to be a good omen. I am hoping, as are many of us nostalgic baby boomers, that this will be only the first of a long series of equally pleasant DVD releases from Hallmark Entertainment. All in all, this new DVD is well done and very welcome!",1061510400,2,2349,4.5928571428571425
1898528,3,B00009YXEW,"There was incredible excitement at our house when we found this DVD at Amazon. My son even used his own money to buy it. While the picture quality is good, and the films on the disc are some of their best, I must say I'm a little confused by a few ... choices ... made for this compilation.
Oddity number one: No matter which audio track, digitally restored or unrestored, you choose for ""The Sons of the Desert,"" there has been some very low-volume background music added to Ollie's ""nervous shakedown scene,"" and perhaps others. (I've only had time to spot check). I believe the music is from Beau Hunks recordings, also available on Amazon.
  Don't get me wrong; I love the Beau Hunks. But I'd rather see a ""restored"" Laurel & Hardy film exactly as released, or, maybe with a deleted scene added back in. For instance, ""Laughing Gravy"" is available this way, and has typical Hal Roach underscoring for the deleted scene added from modern recordings. That, at least is defensible on the grounds that the deleted scene probably would have had underscoring in 1931. But I don't know why someone would add music now to a scene that was released without it.
Oddity number two: The sound track for ""Another Fine Mess"" isn't synchronized properly. You can spot this when Officer Harry Bernard complains about Stan answering, 'Yes, ma'am."" Bernard hits his chest twice. The sound is late. Ditto when Stan and Ollie slam the front door. This short suffered from missing elements when it was being restored in 1986, but synchronization shouldn't have been a problem when it was transferred to DVD.
While the picture quality of all the material was generally quite good, I believe there are better elements available. For instance, camera negative for ""The Music Box"" was extant as recently as 1986, and ""County Hospital"" as of the same date was available in the studio lavender composite. The print of ""County Hospital"" in the DVD has quite a few scratches in it, and although they're not dramatic, it's not likely a lavender would suffer from scratches.
Still, it's good to see the boys in above average copies of some of their best films.",1061510400,11,2133,4.762162162162162
1898529,5,B00009YXEW,"These are not the exact originals, indicated by the fact that the MGM lion is heard but not seen.

1898530,1,B00009YXEW,"Hallmark owns the rights to the  Laurel and Hardy sound films. They  do not care about using the best available prints. The kirch Group in England only used the best available 35mm originals for their Laurel and Hardy dvds. We in America get a Dvd with added ""modern sounding"" music and a TV print, not the original masters. Hallmark does not care and will not respond to emails. I will not buy ANYTHING by Hallmark or Artisan until they get it right. Hallmark will not sell the rights to people who really would do something for the preservation and restoration of these films. These films have never been ""remastered"" in America. A very angry fan.",1061337600,10,649,4.6347826086956525
1898531,1,B00009YXEW,"I just finished skimming thru the Hallmark Laurel and Hardy DvD. The news for fans of Stan and Ollie is NOT good.

SONS OF THE DESERT has that annoying hair in the gate at the bottom of the left hand side during the opening credits, artificial fades in the middle of scenes and even worse, added music that was NOT there originally!!!!, ANOTHER FINE MESS has scratches and lines that could have easily been removed by a proper digital restorer, BUSY BODIES same problem along with an obvious glitch during the boys ride to work. MUSIC BOX has dropout lines that were obviously on the master tapes. And the sound transition from the menu to the opening titles is sooooooooo loud, it will make your ears bleed. I could go on, but why bother. These were the same masters used for that dreadful LAUREL AND HARDY SHOW back in the 80's. Purposefully tampered with. Hallmark could have used the gorgeous restored masters released in Europe, but no. Send Hallmark a messege, DO NOT BUY THIS DVD. Demand they make this right. John Field.

1898532,5,B00009YXEW,"The unavailability of classic Laurel and Hardy sound films in America has amounted to nothing short of national criminal neglect -- especially since several European companies have gone to great length (and expense) to restore many of them.
Hopefully, this DVD will be the first in an eventual complete series of Stan and Ollie that will rectify this failing. More hopefully, this DVD will contain those restored editions circulating in Europe and recent limited theatrical U.S. release.
So, what we have before us at long last is a collection containing one of the greatest full-length comedies ever made (SON'S OF THE DESERT), perhaps THE greatest short comedy feature of all time (the Academy Award winning THE MUSIC BOX), two solid ""B"" shorts (BUSY BODIES & COUNTY HOSPITAL), and the interesting, if not classic, ANOTHER FINE MESS.
To focus on just one, few films are so etched into the common psyche as MUSIC BOX. Anyone who has ever seen it -- even as a small child -- remembers assending the Steps of Sisyphus, and the ""mechanical blunderbus"" piano with a seeming mind of its own. One of their many surrealist masterpieces (it's not by chance that Dali once credited the Boy's BELOW ZERO as his favorite film) every scene shimmers with a kind of internal Magical Reality. How can that flimsy awning support a giant piano with massive block-and-tackle? Is the horse Susie actually consciously planning Ollie's indignities? Yet, the world of 1127 Walnut Ave. -- the ever receding house ""on the stoop"" -- is as real and inevitable as gravity.

Now, with a world of over 100 additional L&H films to choose from, can we at least hope for a volume two?",1061078400,,1653,4.861702127659575

Just the idea of them moving a piano up a long, steep flight of stairs is enough to get you laughing.  The sight gags and physical comedy were Laurel & Hardy at their very best.  It is obvious why this short won the 1932 Oscar for best short subject.  Eight years later, the Three Stooges did a similar short involving moving ice blocks (which melt) up a very similar flight of stairs in their short ""An Ache in every Stake.""  ---------  ""Sons of the Desert"" is probably the duo's best feature length film.  Stan and Ollie concoct a wild story about Ollie needing a rest for his health...in Honolulu.  They really want to go to the Sons of the Desert convention in Chicago, which their wives have forbidden.  It would have worked, except the ship they were supposed to be on sinks, and the wives find out.  This funny film was made about fifteen years before Jackie Gleason's ""The Honeymooners"" went on the air; you can see the influence this movie had on the Honeymooners with the wild schemes of the fat loud mouth, and his mousey side kick, while trying to keep secrets from the wives.
