4829695,5,B005LOBWA2,"Cartoons from all eras, flawlessly remastered (no strange restriction to titles from 1953 and later).
Full-screen option throughout.
No double-dipping, except for reasons of completeness.
No weak 1960s cartoons, except for reasons of completeness.

If the ""Looney Tunes Super Stars"" series had been like this from the start, I suspect sales would be stronger. If there's such a thing as justice, you'll be rewarded for getting it right this time.",1326499200,14,446,5.371428571428571
4829696,5,B005LOBWA2,"As the other reviewers have already noted, this DVD is done right, all the classic Pepe Le Pew cartoons in their original aspect.  Can a similar DVD of all the Chuck Jones Roadrunner and Coyote cartoons be far behind?

My only suggestion is that these cartoons are best enjoyed one at a time.  I don't recommend watching all 17 one after another.  Why not add a cartoon to your evening movie, thus simulating the experience of those of us who saw these in theaters?",1326067200,10,465,4.5
4829697,5,B005LOBWA2,"Finally, after three years of rip-off DVD's, Warner Brothers releases another excellent Looney Tunes DVD collection.  This has the complete Pepe le Pew cartoons including the Sylvester & Tweety cartoon ""Dog Pounded"" where he makes a cameo appearance.  Everything about this one is perfect.  I wouldn't be worth a scent if I didn't own this DVD.",1325376000,29,344,5.107142857142857
4829698,5,B005LOBWA2,"I have the first five of the Looney Tunes golden collections, and have waited for this Pepe Le Pew collection for much too long!  Pepe has long been one of my favorite Looney Tunes chaaracters and this set has all seventeen of his shorts! It is a terrific addition to any collection of cartoons.  My only complaint would be the dvd is a bit of a pain to navigate but Pepe made up for it.  They are all enjoyable, but one of my favorites is the ""Wild about You"" where Pepe becomes enamoured with a wildcat from the zoo.  No matter how many times she attacks him, he keeps coming and utters one of my favorite lines.  After a ball of frenzied scratches, a confused Pepe says ""I hope I hold out!""  Hysterical!  I am so glad Warner Brothers listened to all the fans requests and gave us this collection.  It's priceless.",1325289600,38,816,4.322368421052632
4829699,5,B005LOBWA2,"Writer Mike Maltese came up with the idea of a cat disguised as a skunk getting chased by an oversexed French version of the genuine article for Chuck Jones to use in 1945's ODOR-ABLE KITTY, but the idea of a continuing series was laughable. After all, the punchline of that cartoon was that the skunk was henpecked and the French accent fake (not to mention the cat he had been chasing was male -- draw your own conclusions). But it must have been in the cards that the skunk was destined for stardom. He returned as ""Stinky"" in 1947's SCENT-IMENTAL OVER YOU, and achieved immortality when Jones won his first Oscar for FOR SCENT-IMENTAL REASONS in 1949.

This release collects all of the Jones unit's cartoons featuring Pep Le Pew in one neat little package, and makes no discriminations or reviled alterations like earlier ""Super Stars"" releases did. Everything is present and accounted for in full-screen, and none of that ""1954 and on only"" nonsense (making the excuses for the selection on the Foghorn Leghorn release pretty flimsy). The cartoons look absolutely stunning too, allowing one to truly appreciate the work of designers like Robert Gribbroek and Maurice Noble.

In spite of this being a selection of cartoons from one of the most important animation directors of all time at the height of his power, poor Pep's cartoons don't exactly shine when stacked in a row like this, given that nearly all of the cartoons follow FOR SCENT-IMENTAL REASONS' formula - a black cat gets a white stripe on her back and Pep tries to woo her. It's not Jones and Maltese at their most creative; these were their bread-and-butter pictures after all. Still, the Pep formula doesn't embrace a hip iconic status like that of the Road Runner series. Don't judge too harshly though - all of these cartoons were made over a period of some fifteen years, when reuse was an accepted practice in short subjects and the chance of actually seeing a Pep cartoon at the theaters was one in fifty.

In spite of any aesthetic shortcomings, ""Zee Best of Zee Best"" is a solid and watchable compilation, much more so than the Speedy Gonzales disc on the fourth ""Golden Collection"", and any of the Warner guys' attempts at formula beat the spitfire out of the other studios'. Plus, you get two oddball selections: Art Davis's disgusting ODOR OF THE DAY, featuring a skunk that looks like Pep but isn't, and DOG POUNDED, a Friz Freleng Tweety & Sylvester classic with a cameo by the skunk at the end. Abe Levitow's REALLY SCENT (him filling in for Jones on a sabbatical from the studio) is also an underrated, charming gem, with the cat _wanting_ to be with Pep!

So be like Pep himelf with the ladies, and just _go_ get this without hesitation! Vive L'Amour!",1324944000,88,2737,4.7196652719665275
4829700,5,B005LOBWA2,"There really haven't been many Looney Tunes collections on DVD or video that haven't been able to sparle in the way that they honestly could've been. With anticipation surrounding the upcoming Looney Tunes Platinum Collection coming to Blu-Ray soon, there seems to be a reintroduction to what made them famous in the first. While that idea might be a good one, there seems to be a much stinkier one that actually smeels sweet in the future. That one comes from Chuck Jones favorite French skunk, Pepe Lew Pew. It has been over 65 years since the world was introduced to that seductive gem. But honestly there had been only one collection of his tales back in 1986 with Pepe Le Pew's Skunks Tales, as a part from the 80's warner Brother Golden Jubilee 24 Karat Collection. Now a more perfection Pepe will be coming to DVD.

The Looney Tunes Super Stars Pepe Le Pew Collection is the jolt that Warner Brothers has really needed to give that fell short for the past several years. The collection really is the definitive Pepe, that includes all, and I mean all of Pepe's shorts in one DVD set. Every single cartoon that Pepe Le Pew was featured in, whether it has been on DVD before like Odor-Able Kitty, or the Oscar-winning For Scent-imental Reasons, all the way to A Scent Of The Matterhorn. Absolutely nothing feels like it was left out. The DVD feels fresh and new, giving a fresh feeling, unlike the way a skunk does smell. The collection of have all been remastered beautifully, and deliver well for die hard fans from Chuck's favorite loveable skunk, or for anyone whom hasn't yet seen the classics that made him distinctive from the 40's to the 1960's.

Honestly, there is so much that Warner Brothers could've said with their DVD collections from the Looney Tunes gang from the past few years but didn't, and they really make it up right here. I absolutely recommend this for die hard Looney Tunes collectors, and for anyone that has been awaiting what had made Pepe Le Pew the cutest stinker in Hollywood. This is definitely a must buy for you DVD collection, and for anyone that has been into today's cartoon favorites like Spongebob Squarepants all this time. The Looney Tunes Super Stars: Pepe Le Pew Collection really is a scent that still smells beautiful today, as it did back then.

I would say great deal for six bucks!  Although, my did case did arrive with a slight crack but I really don't care about that.  I'm just happy that I now have all of Pepe's episode and that one episode he makes a cameo but hey!  At least you can say you own all his appearances right?  If you're a big fan of Pepe then you should definitely own this if you're just a Pepe fan I mean.
Also great to see all the different versions of Penelope and the different animals he's chased.
And the box art is so cute too!  And it does includes subtitles!
Side note:  The first time I played it it only played six episodes and I was like oh no!  But after button pressing it played all the episodes so if it happens to you I guess I'd say just button smash?",1471737600,,821,4.0

4829729,5,B005LOBWA2,"Beautiful picture quality, complete cartoons, just fantastic and exceeding all expectations. The very positive reviews by others led me to buy this without hesitation.  One or maybe two reviewers commented that there were some cartoons that were not Pepe le Pew cartoons. This is not true, he's in ALL. He makes an appearance, at least, in the couple of cartoons that are not particularly focused around him. In one short, he makes a brief appearance of only a few seconds at the end. In the other, there is a long lead up to Pepe le Pew with other characters, but then he indeed becomes the main character.

My mother happens to love these Pepe le Pew cartoon shorts, as I do, although they were new to her upon seeing this DVD. I must disagree with the small number of reviewers who say that watching these consecutively reveals them to be extremely similar; I do not find that to be the case at all. Obviously, Pepe has his stand-out qualities that are going to be reinforced in each episode, but the plots and other details are quite different, and you will not feel that you are watching the same thing, over and over again.  Not unless you are someone who simply doesn't like the character anyway, in which case you won't be happy after watching even one.

Highly recommend this DVD.",1463011200,,1289,4.591304347826087

The DVD is sparkling, colorful and ideal with cozy characters in Paris, France.

You will enjoy all 17 cartoons in almost two hours on one DVD. The quality was in color and the entertainment was light-hearted for the eyes. The cartoons provided nostalgia for me as I watched it recently. Fans of Pepe Le Pew will enjoy this collection.",1450224000,,884,5.096551724137931

Other than that its still a great collection containing some my favorite looney tunes cartoons featuring my second favorite looney tune character including the 1949 academy award wining short For scentimental reasons which had producer edward selzer accepting the award and proving him wrong about what he said before that, ""theres nothing funny about a skunk who spoke french"" and thus shutting him up.

Then, like a bolt from the blue, I found this DVD and, miracle of miracles, ALL of the original Pepe cartoons are on this disc!  All of those years spent trying to find them-wasted!  All here in a low price.  Now my kids watch it and love Pepe too (they go around imitating his funny lines), and get to see him in all the entirety, no old scratchy VCR lines.  Well worth the money, go buy it now!  I promise it is as cute and funny as you remember when you were a kid.

For a cartoon skunk he is good looking especially when he sits on a chair or on the ground.,1388448000,,277,3.793103448275862
4829822,5,B005LOBWA2,"I will tell you right up front why this collection received 5 big stars. It is because EVERY Pepe Le Pew
cartoon Warner Bros. made is here. No filler. No ""friends"". Just Pepe. Well, except for ""Dog Pounded""
where he makes a cameo appearance. So only really 16 cartoons, but you get the drift. But at least
now you can call yourself a ""Pepe le Pew Completest"" when you pick up this treasure.

There are no frills, no extras, no booklet, but all 17, uh 16, cartoons are here on this one disc. What a
concept; to actually include them all and not try to get 2 discs out of 16 'toons by including other non-
star type Warner Bros. characters.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Looney-Tunes-and-Merrie-Melodies-A-Complete-Illustrated-Guide-to-the-Warner-Bros-Cartoons/dp/0805008942/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies: A Complete Illustrated Guide to the Warner Bros. Cartoons</a>&nbsp;by Jerry
Beck and Will Friedwald. There are descriptions of every cartoon made and cross-referencing indexes in
the back. ]

This disc allows you to pick either the Standard version or the Widescreen version, in a ""Matted"" format,
that preserves the original aspect ratio and is enhanced for widescreen televisions.

The sound is in Dolby Digital English Mono and subtitles can be found in English and Francais.

Anyway we all know the formula, and there are some deviations, but it's Pepe's suave demeanor and cool
pseudo-French that makes these cartoons sparkle as he chases the poor faux-skunk around and around
looking for L'Amour in all the wrong places.

In the first cartoon, ""Odor-able Kitty"" (1945), the new character has not quite been fleshed out yet. The
skunk's name is Henry and he has a family! Also, 'Henry' chases a Male cat with the ill-gotten white stripe
down his back. Later episodes the chased cat is a female. C'est L'Amour.

BRAVO to Warner Bros and to the person who saw fit to just do the right thing this time collecting all 16
of those cartoons on une disc. Merci, merci!",1384819200,3,2145,5.2

Coyote,Yosemite Sam,Porky Pig,Sylvester,Tweety, and Foghorn Leghorn often. But Pepe was seen so infrequently that he got by with all of his cartoons being almost alike.

4829877,5,B005LOBWA2,"It's an excellent collection of Pepe Le Pew cartoons for collectors (along with the Foghorn Leghorn DVD). It features all of Pepe's 15 cartoons from 1945 to 1962 all directed by Chuck Jones (except one which is ""Really Scent"" from 1959 directed by Abe Levitow) and it also features 2 of his oddball appearances, ""Odor Of The Day"" (1948) where he doesn't act like the character since he goes against a dog and ""Dog Pounded"" (1954) which is actually a Tweety and Sylvester cartoons and Pepe only has a cameo roll at the end.

4829879,5,B005LOBWA2,"I played this DVD for the first time yesterday & I laughed, chuckled, etc., at so many of the ""tunes"" with ""Pepe"".  He was one of the characters that I loved the best on Saturday afternoon at the movies when I was a child.  I was truly delighted when his was on; it made my afternoon.  If you love french accents by Mel Blanc & the antics of ""Pepe"" & his ""amour"", you won't be disappointed, not at all.  This DVD  is worth the price & I shall play it again & again & again..........",1332979200,,482,4.031578947368421
4829880,5,B005LOBWA2,"Yes, a few of the cartoons have already been released on DVD before, but it was nice of Warner Bros. to package ALL the Pepe Le Pew cartoons onto one convenient DVD! The restoration quality is really good on all of the cartoons. I prefer watching them all in fullscreen, so I get the full picture (after the controversy the first Bugs and Daffy Super Star DVDs caused when they were cropped into ""fake"" widescreen.)
Pepe Le Pew has always been one of my favorite Looney Tunes characters (what's not to love about a male amorous skunk with a heavy French accent?) so of course, I just had to have this DVD. It also includes the prototype Pepe's debut appearance in ""Odor-able Kitty"" (it has a surprise ending, along with a cameo appearance by an impostor Bugs Bunny!), ""Odor of the Day"" (the only short where Pepe acts strangely out of character throughout and has nearly no dialogue), even ""Dog Pounded"" (a classic Sylvester/Tweety pairing that is new to DVD, which ends with a Pepe cameo.)
Now that Warner Home Video is getting better with these Super Star DVDs, I can't wait to see what they come out with next!",1332720000,,1113,4.57

4829884,5,B005LOBWA2,"I've made the mistake of picking up the other Looney Tunes Collection DVDs, and have been disappointed every time... until now. Whoever was overseeing this collection actually knew what they were doing. They've included an option to see the cartoons in the intended full screen or the cropped wide screen. They've also included nearly all, if not all of the Pepe cartoons. These include the first one which features a very different Le Pew. It's interesting to see the evolution of the character throughout the series. There were several that I had never seen before. These included some rather racy jokes, so I'm wondering if that's the reason I never saw them on television.

My only complaint is that they aren't offering these in a blu-ray format, but it's still well worth buying. I hope that WB has realized they botched the earlier collections and have decided to take a different path going forward.",1327881600,5,907,4.8896103896103895

4829888,5,B005LOBWA2,"This series of bare-bones ""Looney Tunes Superstars"" releases pales in comparison to the ""Golden Collection"" series, and has been flawed in many ways from the get-go. The Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck discs included cartoons cropped for a phony wide screen format, the Tweety and Sylvester disc didn't have a single new-to-DVD cartoon, and the Road Runner disc, while fine for the Looney Tunes completist, was filled with latter-day, non-Chuck Jones cartoons. The Foghorn Leghorn one is excellent, but padded out with one-shot cartoons and lacking many of the Foggy cartoons we've all been waiting for.

This one finally got it right. While there are no special features, the majority of the cartoons are new to DVD, and all are dazzlingly restored. Plus, it's the complete filmography of one of Chuck Jones' most enduring characters.

If you're not familiar with Pepe Lew Pew, here's the idea: A cat (or the occasional other species) paints herself to look like a skunk on purpose or by accident, and is pursued by the amorous French skunk. While most of Pepe's victims have little objection to his romantic advances, they quickly smell him and have second thoughts.

Although they're formulaic, and a few of these cartoons in one sitting is more than enough, they're still funny, and if you like Pepe, Chuck Jones and the hilarious writing of Mike Maltese, buying this is a no-brainer.",1326672000,25,1382,4.974025974025974

8478389,5,B005LOBWA2,"LOONEY TUNES SUPER STARS-PEPE LE PEW-ZEE BEST OF ZEE BEST: Director extraordinaire Chuck Jones' overconfident, love-starved Maurice Chevalier-channeling skunk was one of the most original, if underrated of all Looney Tunes characters (and what a character!). Although basically a one joke premise...Pepe mistakes a black feline (who has inadvertently acquired a white stripe) for a female polecat...Mel Blanc's fractured French, salty songs of woo, and malodorous malaprops made every adventure a laugh riot. Pepe played against type only once, in a silent slapstick Arthur Davis-directed short pitting him against a kooky canine...he also made a surprise cameo in the Tweety and Sylvester episode Dog Pounded. Zee Best of Zee Zee Best collects all 17 amorous adventures, including the Oscar-winning For Scent-imental Reasons...and, you should pardon the expression, there's not a stinker in zee bunch.
