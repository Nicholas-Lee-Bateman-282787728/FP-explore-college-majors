5324883,5,B009G70MZQ,"Ahh,  one of the best seasons yet.  Suspense, danger, humor, family bickering, and bad weather.

The familiar boats and captains are back. A little older, a little more wrinkled, a little grayer, and a little more susceptible to injury.

The captains set the tone for the season. The difference is remarkable in the atmosphere and attitude of the crew.

The Harris brothers are on board,  Josh on the Time Bandit and Jake on the Northwestern.  Josh seems to fit right in, working hard and making future plans.  Jake, he's still the Jake we know from earlier seasons and still troubled.

No dissapointments this season.",1352505600,2,618,4.865384615384615
5324884,5,B009G70MZQ,"here we have another installment of the popular discovery channel series ""Deadliest Catch"": season 8. this season we find the harris boy's making the transition to other boats. jake boards the deck of the northwestern and josh finds a new home on the time bandit. big storms and plenty of ice during opilio season await the fleet this season. the fate of the corelia marie hangs in the balance as the boys try to gain more experience on there new boats. the conelia is not featured this season but the hope is she will return next season. on the time bandit the crew says goodbye to fallen friend and deckhand justin tennison with a touching burial at sea. capt. keith and the crew of the wizard have a near fatal incident with a new greenhorn. kodiak capt. ""wild"" bill wichrowski Has a hard time breaking in a brand new crew. bill also grows tired of his son's (zach larson) lackadaisical effort on deck and confronts zack with true ""wild"" bill bravado. seabrooke captain scott campbell goes to all lenghts to become a ""legendary"" name on the bering sea. elliot neese struggles to maintain his seat as captain of the ramblin' rose after the owner threatens to send a new boat out to replace the rose & neese if elliot can't catch his quota during blue crab. what is nice about this set is that it puts the ""after the catch"" series in order after the corresponding ""deadliest catch"" show. the only way to purchase this set (as of 10-29-12) is through the discovery channel web site at [discovery.com/tv/deadliest-catch]. it retails at $49.99 + shipping. please don't get ripped-off by the joker trying to sell it here for over $70.00. go to discovery.com and get it $20.00 cheaper.",1351468800,19,1681,4.6632996632996635

5324900,5,B009G70MZQ,I bought this for my sons-in-law who live in Australia.  They watch the show when visiting us.  We sent them the DVD's so they can watch the old shows and look forward to the new episodes when they come for another visit.,1401753600,,221,4.238095238095238
5324901,5,B009G70MZQ,Deadliest Catch fans are not going to be disappointed!  I do not have the ability to watch this show live so must wait for the DVD's to become available for sale at Amazon.  It was worth the wait though and I've watched it several times now.  Any fan of DC will of course love Season 8.  Fish ON!,1399507200,,296,4.051724137931035
5324902,5,B009G70MZQ,It was good as expected with the adventures they go through with work and their personal life; which one don't realize.  It still kept us on our toes or the edge of our seat.,1399334400,,174,4.117647058823529

5324904,4,B009G70MZQ,"For some unknown reason it's NOT closed captioned so with the noise of the weather, you miss a lot of the dialog.  I hope the next season has closed captioning!",1395273600,,160,4.333333333333333
5324905,4,B009G70MZQ,"Season five is the most interesting. However, I enjoy all of the series and am waiting for the rest to become available.",1393372800,,120,4.5
5324906,5,B009G70MZQ,I truly do not know why a series about guys fishing for crabs in dangerous arctic waters is fascinating but it is. Maybe it is because it is real!  These guys are not actors and the scenes are definitly not filmed on a holywood back lot.  The dangers and satisfactions of wresting a big catch from mother nature are all real.  This series is probably not for everyone as it can be gritty and a bit dark but I am not aware of anything else like it on TV.,1392681600,,453,4.067415730337078

5324909,5,B009G70MZQ,Each Season gets better and better with of course the exception of Elliot and Jr.  But don't let them stop you from getting and watching this.  Love the extras with the After the Catch also.,1376697600,3,190,4.4
5324910,5,B009G70MZQ,Another great season for Deadliest Catch! I've already watched it more than once and just wish it was a longer season.,1375747200,,118,4.666666666666667
