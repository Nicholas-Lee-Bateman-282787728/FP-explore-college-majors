1196185,4,B000006PE1,"This film, made after the highly provacative ""Pandora's Box"" is somehow sweeter, more tranquile and contemplative in its depiction of a  young girl who's lost herself down the wrong tracks. Louise Brooks is at  her most beautiful here- I wonder what Pabst was thinking when he planned  this film after the release (as in a venting of sexual violence, guilt and  idolatry; not the film's release to cinemas) of Pandora's Box. Here Louise  plays the victim throughout- not the femme fatale who must die in her own  trap in Pandora. Her character- a fine, delicate spirit who must inhabit  sorrowfully the vile places of the professional woman companion and hang  with the vile men who frequent those places- is possibly the most  compelling heroine of the whole silent era.",965433600,6,771,4.9147286821705425
1196186,5,B000006PE1,"Louise Brooks in her most challenging part. Innocently pushed in a world of sin and decadence, Miss Brooks gives the peformance of her life. The movie has everything ,all the clichees from orphanage to brothel,but plays  with them in a most becoming and ironical way. Nothing is taken to  seriously,every other character besides Louise Brooks is played in an  almost hysterical and over the top style,but this only more is a testament  of Louise Brooks great and very convincing performance.

1196187,5,B000006PE1,"Following the classic ""Pandora's Box"", Louise Brooks once again plays a character that is more than a match for her men.  Just about every  experience a woman can go through in life happens to young Thyamine - rape,  birth, death, slavery, prostitution.  But she never loses her belief in  her own moral strength and superiority and is  ultimately trimuphiant.",923529600,5,360,5.016949152542373

1196190,3,B000006PE1,"Since ""Diary of a Lost Girl"" is my favorite Louise Brooks film, I was looking forward to it being released in blu-ray. I have to admit, I am disappointed in this Kino release. I own the 2001 Kino regular DVD edition of this film and I find it superior to the blu-ray edition in picture, sound, and music.

The 2001 edition, in my opinion, has a sharper picture, clearer sound, and much better soundtrack music. Joseph Turrin's full orchestra music in the 2001 edition is beautiful, lush, and fits in perfectly with the film. The piano music in the blu-ray edition is okay, but is sometimes annoying and distracting

The picture quality in the blu-ray edition is my biggest disappointment. The picture is often soft without much high definition, while the 2001 edition oftentimes has a much sharper picture. And the Louise Brooks short subject ""Windy Riley Goes Hollywood"" is a much better print in the 2001 edition than the one used in the blu-ray edition.

I know that trying to present blu-ray editions of silent films from the 1920's can be very problematic, and I applaud any company such as Kino and the Criterion Collection for continuing to make available these wonderful films from the silent era. And I will continue to keep purchasing  blu-ray editions of silent films as they are released. I just wish this classic Louise Brooks film in blu-ray had been better.",1464912000,9,1372,4.776371308016878

1196192,5,B000006PE1,"This is a black and white silent film featuring Louise Brooks in the title role.  It does get to be kind of long after a while, but, it is actually a very serious movie with a strong message.  While probably more autobiographical than the film makers realized, as Louise Brooks in real life was sexually abused at a young age, the story centers around a well to do girl who has just finished her confirmation.  (In Germany that is an important coming of age milestone, to officially join the Church.)  After her maid gets fired (probably due to rejecting the advances of her father), Louise Brooks' character meets the Pharmacist downstairs to find out what happenned.  Unfortunately, she finds out all too well what happenned.  As the pharmacist drugs her and rapes her and she ends up having a baby.  In the meantime, her father has taken up with the new housekeeper who is more manipulative than the previous one and she arranges to have Louise Brooks' character's baby sold (one gathers to be killed) to a midwife and places Louise Brooks' character in a reformatory school.  The school is overly strict and the girl is puzzled as to why she is there.  She ends up escaping with the aid of a friend who is also down and out, despite his high birth, and through a series of circumstances ends up working in a high class brothel.  Thankfully, there is a happy ending to the movie.  And what impresses one the most throughout the film is how adept Louise Brooks is at conveying likeability and innocence (through no fault of her own, but she was anything but, in real life) and a waif like helplessness. Her eyes draw one in to the character and her looks, even though not as eye catching as some of the later Golden Age Hollywood stars, really stand out as a cut above.  One really feels drawn to her as a friend and a person.  And it is interesting how the plot of the film so closely mirrors her own life, with the impacting message being how terribly difficult it is for the young women to be sexually taken advantage of.  In a way, even though from 1929, the plot and message of the movie feels decidedly modern at times.",1459641600,,2127,4.490909090909091

Pabst lost interest in Brooks (or did Brooks lose interest in Pabst? She was known to love very freely; even Chaplin had a fling with her). Pabst filmed Brooks in Pandora's Box in such a way that her beauty was incandescent. In Diary, she looks dumpy in some scenes (she drank heavily). There are some good scenes and set pieces, but the plot here is driven by lust and Pabst no longer lusted after his American star. It shows. After this film, there were a few cheap movies made here and there, a descent into alcoholism, poverty in a crime-ridden neighborhood, and years of illness.

1196219,5,B000006PE1,"I must admit I am irrationally transfixed by film star Louise Brooks who was born the same year as my grandmother for Pete's sake.  Stunningly beautiful, she follow her success in ""Pandora's Box"" with this German film also directed by Georg Wilhelm Pabst.  Brooks plays Thymian who appears to be a woman in her late teens.  She is the daughter of widower Robert Henning, a well off pharmacist.

The story opens when housekeeper and governess Elisabeth (Sybille Schmitz) is being discharged for being pregnant.  It is never clear but the most likely candidate for fatherhood might be Robert or his creepy assistant Meinert (Fritz Rasp).  Meinert who clearly has a penchant for sex (flips through photos of naked women when he's not filling prescriptions), entices the nave Thymian to meet him late at night.  We see a passed out Thymian carried onto Meinert's bed and the next thing you know, she's preggers.

The extended family meet as kind of a board of directors to decide Thymian's fate.  Robert, by now has hired a new housekeeper, Meta (Franziska Kinz) who he eventually marries.  Snoopy Meta discovers Thymian's diary and finds that Meinert is the father of the unborn child.  The family elders decide they must marry.  When Thymian refuses she is dispatched to a reformatory for wayward young women.  The baby is sent to a midwife.  The reformatory is very structured and the girls are constantly pawed by the thuggish brute and his wife that run the place.  Count Nicolas Osdorff is a family friend of Thymian and helps her escape along with another young woman, named Erika (Edith Meinhard).

Thymian is determined to find her baby, but once she gets to the midwife's apartment she learns the baby has died.  Heartbroken, Thymian finds the Count and Erika who have returned to Erika's old job site, an upscale brothel.  Brooks is excellent as she slowly changes from a somewhat innocent and withdrawn Thymian to a more worldly woman.  Still, this isn't a life she wants, so an agreement is made to marry the Count although he has been cut off financially by his wealthy Uncle, also a Count.  Upon the untimely death of the young Count, the elder adopts Thymian and introduces her to the ladies of society.  It turns out that one of their charities is the refomatory where Thymian had escaped a few years earlier.

This is a brave film that deals with many of the taboos of the time, even in Europe.  The Kino version is very good.  Certainly no film of this era is perfect, but the restoration is well done with clean intertitles and a nice Dolby Digital 2.0 musical score by Joseph Turrin.  It includes a 10 minute sound featurette starring Brooks called ""Windy Riley Goes Hollywood"" that was directed by ""Our Gang""/""Little Rascals"" star Fatty Arbuckle who was blacklisted at the time.",1382313600,,2796,4.799163179916318

1196228,5,B000006PE1,"Black and white silent movie with English subtitles. Sound track relevant to the story. Original title ""Tagebuch einer Verlorenen""

Thymiane (Louise Brooks) not aware of the relationship her father had with another of his housekeepers Elisabeth (Sybille Schmitz); she is confused as to why the housekeeper had to leave and ultimately why the housekeeper committed suicide. The pharmacist Meinert (Fritz Rasp) downstairs is more than willing to show her what happens when one gets too friendly and does so when Thymiane faints.

This results in an offspring. The father pays the pharmacist's debt in exchange for making an honest woman of Thymiane. However she reneges and holds out for love; naturally this is unacceptable so she and her diary are sent off to a correctional institute for lost girls. Her offspring is handed over to a midwife.

Will her father come to his senses or is he falling prey to his latest housekeeper Meta (Franziska Kinz?)
Will she break out of the oppressive institute or just learn evil ways?
Will her old friend Count Nicolas Osdorff (Andr&eacute; Roanne) come to her rescue?
Or will he have problems of his own when he is out cast?

We find ourselves sitting on the edge of our seats, kibitzing even if we saw the movie before.

1196229,5,B000006PE1,"Louise Brooks had a reputation for being ""difficult"" to work with, but you'd never know it when you see this extraordinarily gorgeous woman cast her magic on film. A lot of people may say, ""A silent film? Aren't they kind of boring?"" If you want to change that attitude, induce them to watch any of the very few Louise Brooks' films--particularly this one--to change their view. DIARY OF A LOST GIRL is completely modern in subject matter, direction & acting style.

There is little I can add that the other reviwers haven't covered. The title could have been DIARY OF A FALLEN WOMAN, but I like ""Lost."" However, neither term applies to Brooks' character who was betrayed by the men in her life at an early age. She is sent to a ""reformator""  a la Magdalene Sisters) after being raped & subsequently made pregnant by her father's handsome but cheesy business partner. The reformatory with its grotesque male director & mannish ""dorm mistress"" is a chilling glimpse into reactionary mores & twisted sexism. This is just the beginning of a truly epic exploration of a woman who learns to define herself despite the social realities that try to drag her down. However, this is not a morose or depressing story--because throughout her ordeals, Louise Brooks projects a positive image. She shows compassion even to the people who have tried to destroy her. She eventually finds her role in society with grace & sensitivity.

This is not a tear-jerker, rather it is a brilliant affirmation of life. For people who've never seen a silent film, this is a good place to start because DIARY OF A LOST GIRL is both beautiful, engaging & very relevant.",1320105600,29,1640,4.767605633802817

1196231,5,B000006PE1,"""Diary of a Lost Girl"" is a great movie because director, G. W. Pabst, knew exactly what he was doing with the wonderful material that Louise brooks offered as a star: A perfect face with the perfect hair and styled to frame it, a lithe body that simply seemed manufactured for dancing and fainting gracefully, and a luminous presence on the screen that is unforgettable.
The film is a horror story on growing up the wrong way: Thymian (Louise Brooks) is the daughter of a wealthy merchant (Josef Rovensky) that owns a pharmacy. Since Louise's mother has been dead he has developed a wondering eye that has led to involvements with the housekeepers, and we suspect that Elizabeth, the one that leaves the house devastated on the very day of Thymain's confirmation party, is not the first to get pregnant by him. Elizabeth, in true fim noir fashion,  commits suicide. Louise then catches Meta, the new housekeeper, (Franziska Kinz) who looks like a first-class manipulator,  in the arms of her father.  Thymian is so overcome by the suicide and her discovery, which make her father clearly responsible for it that she will fall into a similar trap. Meinert (Fritz Rasp), the greedy-yet-attractive and lustful manager of Henning's pharmacy, moves in on her, Thymiane then faints in his arms and her slender neck looks perfect for a vampire bite, actually, with a neck this white and beautiful Louise should have made an entire SERIES of vampire movies, it was a sadly missed opportunity of the time.

Meinert does not bite her, but he does rape her at some point after or during the fainting spell, for later, she bares his child. This child is the first stepping stone for Thymian's downfall. She is sent to a reformatory that is so sordid and hideous it inevitably forces her to escape. It includes a headmaster that looks like a medieval executioner and a sadistic headmistress who enjoys exercising the girls to utter exhaustion with the mad beating of a cauldron to mark the time, while she writhes in what can only be an early depiction of a ""lesbian-mistress"" in bachic ecstasy. Thymian confides everything to her diary, and when they try to get it from her, she escapes with another girlfriend under the protection of her well meaning, but useless friend, Count Osdorff (Andr Roane).

This escape lands her in a brothel where she finds refuge and employment. She is reluctant at first to plunge into the 'demimonde' of Weimar Berlin, but eventually becomes one of its shining night creatures, and we see her dancing with clients in exquisite flapper outfits. There is a turn of fate that finally, at her father's death, allows Thymian to inherit the full mortage of the pharmacy, but that would imply casting out in the cold the heinous Mete and her two young children, fathered by Thymian's hyper-sexually active father. Thymian in an act of excessive and un-called for generosity, gives that dreadful woman all the money, partially because of the supporting role excellently played by one of the children that runs to her and  plays on probably a combination of frustrated motherly feelings (her own child had died) and her own experiences about he kind of harsh life that awaits them. The winning formula of the plight of the innocent, trapped in a bad turn of fate saves their day and the only one that acknowledges this act of true 'noblesse oblige' is the lawyer that bows and kisses her hand as if she were a princess, as well as slapping Meinert very nicely when he calls her a 'slut'.  Mete lives up to our worst expectations and does not even say 'thank you' though she has taken 45,000 marks, most probably the largest sum she has even heard of, that clearly do not belong to her, but because she is a housefrau, and NOT a fallen woman, she naturally feels entitled to it. I must confess this is very frustrating to watch from a more modern stand point: My hands were itching to drag that cow by the hair and make her give back at least 1/2 of the money she had stolen from Thymian totally and completely through the ruse of emotional blackmail. Thymian however does not have these reactions, and returns to her life in the brothel quite calmly, her plans to marry the Count and start a new life completely shattered by this act of impulsive selflessness. Upon hearing the 'goodness' news as she arrives, the Count jumps out the window, literally.
At the Count's funeral Louise Brooks strikes one of her greatest moments and one of the most unforgettable images of the Silent Screen as the perfect widow. Her veils floating in the wind, her expression and poise the ultimate in mourning chic, her simple black frock absolutely stunning. She recalled Balenciaga's famous axiom ""There is nothing more elegant than a young queen in mourning"". This does not go unnoticed by the elder Count Osdorff, who decides to take her under his protection. So Thymian does start a new like as the widowed Countess Osdorff. She even returns to the reformatory as a member of the Board of the Charity that supports it. By one of those twists of fate the elder Count's relations are on the board and they invited Thymian to come fro the one day a year that they show up, have lunch and discuss the charity. Unfortunately it happens to be the one day when they are reviewing the case of a girl that ""keeps on escaping from the reformatory"" which happens to be, of course, the one that escaped with Thymian and introduced her to the brothel. Thymian stands up for her though, and that makes for a happier ending than we could have expected from this suicide laden fim noir.

This version also includes ""Windy Riley Goes Hollywood"" (1931)  the disc's supplemental material. This 'short' comedy seemed very long to me, as it was boring and trite.  Jack Shutta looks handsome enough as Windy `Cannon Ball' Riley who is on a record-breaking nonstop automobile drive from New York to San Francisco, but an accident that changes the road sign misleads  him to end up in Hollywood, where after a series of dull interchanges with the police, and others he winds up working for a film studio as a 'publicity man' which is a glorified title for messenger boy in this case. The film does offer a look at what early sound was like, which is pretty dreadful. The only redeeming point in watching it is the brief moment where Louise dances, at a rehersal,  which makes one regret that she did not starr in a series of musicals, as she is very good at it. I have to say though, she has an uninspired performance here, dramatically different from the impression she makes in ""Diary of a Lost Girl"". The good thing which happens by accident though, is that in comparing the two films,  it certainly makes one appreciate what a talented director can do with a good actress over what a regular one comes up with. Her voice sounded good, but was not particularly impressive in this movie. I definitely think she could have made a great career in talkies, but from what I understand about her biography, she was very busy at the time with a love affair, and was not happy with Hollywood, she turned down the role that Jean Harlow got instead for ""The Public Enemy"", and after that happened it pretty much sealed her fate with 'the studio system'. I guess she could have gone back to Europe had she wanted to, but Louise was done with the movies, and her legacy is definitively with the Silent Screen. One can not help but thinking that she did the right thing, although she may not have planned it that way, as we remember her for those few wonderful movies, and do not have to regret the weak performances that could have come from works similar to the unfortunate ""Windy Riley Goes Hollywood"".",1248652800,3,7670,4.668393782383419

The plot moves at a brisk pace, and the sadism in this film is downright funny.  The acting throughout is excellent, and there's a tall completely bald actor who has some very amusing scenes - he puts on lipstick, for example.  Well portrayed characters and a good plot make this movie still vibrant so many years later.

She has a screen presence that's hard to describe. Aside from her obvious beauty she transmits something in her eyes that jumps across three quarters of a century and confronts you as a woman of contemporary society. Very little of the usual silent film hand-wringing and eyelash-batting takes place here, instead she draws us in with subtlety, thankfully at the hands of a great director.

The camerawork is genuinely moving, genuinely beautiful in many ways. A few times I found myself hitting the pause button to admire a still frame, worthy of hanging in a gallery on its own and out of context.

1196235,3,B000006PE1,"I am giving this most recent version on DVD of the Pabst/Brooks collaboration 'Diary of a Lost Girl' just three stars.

Like their previous effort 'Pandora's Box',this film will never be shown in its' complete form. Both were butchered by censors in Germany,Europe and in North America for their ""explicit"" content and to make it more palatable for the particular countries' audiences.

I have personally seen over the years about six different versions of this film and all have subtle differences or complete ommissions. This is the most comprehensive version but it does have its' differences both subtle and major.

One major piece returned to the film is a scene on the beach where the customer who first 'took' Louise as a brothel employee,now returns asking if she remembers him. It's nice to see it there but because of the previous cuts to this film it does nothing to advance the plot and could easily have stayed out.

Throughout the film there are a few scenes I have noticed,like the previous reviewer,that have alternate takes inserted that differ with the /90 VHS version. Furthermore there are also scenes which the VHS version does have and this DVD version does NOT have. An example is the ""lottery"" scene where Louise is being auctioned off in the nightclub. In the VHS version there are two cuts to the reaction of the his father,wife and assistant. The most telling and important of the two showing his wife smirking at Louise has been ommitted from the new DVD version. VERY unfortunate as it does so much,among other things,to emphasize Louises' hurt and abondonment.

Another scene reinserted in this new version is the dancing lesson scene. The ""restorers"" in Europe refer through sub-titles  that Louise is teaching dancing at the brothel where she now is staying. This is her attempt to earn a living ""legitmately"".I have seen this scene before but it was never referred specifically to as dancing. In fact I have always considered that she is giving exercise lessons NOT dancing lessons. She comes into the room with a small ""drum"" and stick(no phonograph or radio in sight),she takes off her robe to reveal anything but a dance outfit,the patron starts knee squatting as he lasciviously eyes Louise,then Louise proceeds to do upper body bends. No dancing takes place here. Pabst knew of Louise's dancing abilities of course which were used to good effect elsewhere in the movie but here I think this is just supposition and a liberty taken on the part of the restorers of this new version that had them put ""dancing"" into the titles instead of what it really was.

Another point of contention I have is the inter-titles or sub-titling. There are some that have been repeated from the VHS version but others newly inserted that have been,as far as I can tell,newly created. For example and in keeping with the lottery scene,there is a moment where Louise makes eye contact with her father. The shame on his face is mirrored by the shame on Louises' face who starts to cry. As a topper to this poignant moment Dr. Vitalis who has lost in his bid in the lottery to Count Osdorff starts to cry. After a moment Louise looks away to see the Doctors' face,another one who needs consoling but about whom she can do very little but offer an empathetic glance. It is a great scene and one in which I've never seen a sub title but this new version gets one from the doctor who tells her not only is she now lost but they all are. This scene has always stood on it's own and this sub-title is totally inappropriate,it simply does NOT need one!

Another criticism is the music. I would have liked to have seen a new orchestral score but it is my oppinion the music of the VHS version and the appropriate mood and lift it provided was much better suited to the film than this electronic driven score that at times detracts from the picture totally and spoils it.

Lastly is the inclusion in both the VHS version and this new one of the two ladies at the beach who come upon Louises' step uncle and her. She calls to the uncle ""Cousin Osdorff"".Again until I saw  the VHS version this card showed her calling his real name. The versions I have known previously refer to this woman and the one with her as two acquaintances of his who do charity work and who then ask for Louises' help in their cause. Here we have them as related and the one lady asking if she can ""help care for"" her. Why would she need ""caring"" for by anyone as she is obviously being cared for quite well by her step uncle? If this is the real original sub-title(which I doubt unless proven otherwise)then some important footage is missing here.

Technically this new DVD version,new footage aside,has a much better contrast than others I have seen previously and is clearer but it still has some major blemishes throughout(some VERY distracting) and I thought it should have received a little better treatment than it got.

In conclusion I would say this new DVD version is mostly unsatisfying. We are given new footage which fleshes out alot of areas but some footage(though minor) has disappeared. Also the sub titles(which for the most part are intact from previous versions)have some newly added ones which are not appropriate/accurate and some that should have been excised altogether. Also the music does nothing for this version at all. It's all done cheaply on an electronic keyboard and I think the scorer was at times looking at an entirely different picture.

Though we will never see a truly ""complete"" 'Diary',it is my oppinion that the VHS version(for all its' flaws) is the best so far. It comes closest to the the mood and spirit that Pabst intended.",1148169600,43,5650,4.700707785642063
1196236,1,B000006PE1,"A young, upperclass woman named Thymian is excised from her family when a combination of incidents including her father's affair with the housekeeper, the death of the governess, and her rape by her father's business partner resulting in impregnation causes the family as a whole to send her away (for various reasons, some of which are unknown) to a reformatory.  The draconian actions of the reformatory cause her to run away with a young Count, but unfortunately he is penniless and they have nowhere to go, so she gets stuck in a brothel of sorts where she lives until circumstances bring her back to her family and eventually lead her to a new life and new identity, from which she learns compassion for the other ""lost girls"" of the world.

Technically, that's what it's about.

At least, that's what happens.  The problem with this film is that Thymian is the only character with any motivation, and it's a slight and unfocused one at that.  For the first half of the film, indeed, one at least can be forgiving to the film because the characters inherent (and physical) beauty at least provides some sort of motion to the storyline.  Unfortunately, since the characters have no motivation, and since the director seems entirely unwilling to let anything tragic have its due in the world, the movie skips past what could possibly be a beautiful and tragic ending and continues for another hour or so on tangents without importance or design.

At first this discursiveness seems rather stunning and unexpected, but a quick look back over a few points of the first half of the film start revealing that indeed, it seems Pabst really didn't have a clear understanding of overaching tones, themes, motifs.  He has a storyline and names for characters, but no personalities or plot.  For instance, the name of this movie: DIARY of a Lost Girl.  The beginning is quite clear and obvious the importance of the diary to the character of Thymian, but not only does it not sustain its direct duty to bring her some form of closure, revelation, or salvation, it also simply disappears after a certain point and is never heard of again.

Furthermore, the movie strives to close up all threads with an opportunistic idea that everything can work out, but it closes up threads that needn't be included or are even merely incidental in the story arch.  I repeat: the characters lack motivation.  Since the characters lack motivation, what are they supposed to do to win, or lose, or react to events?  They have nowhere to go or expand, and thus the ending keeps getting further and further away.

Most distressing about watching this film is it's complete lack of understanding about tone.  It goes to extremes that seem at first to show the incredible level of conformity, decadence, ignorance, or whatever, but eventually go to far and fail to make an organized statement.  Little nods to lesbianism are included for no real reason whatsoever.  And what about Thymian's tendency to pass out before being taken advantage of?  If it's meant to show her lack of control over the situation, it's a very maudlin and over-indulgent attempt.

In fact, why does Thymian want to hide the identity of the father of her baby when she was quite clearly raped?  Some rape victims tend to victimize themselves by claiming that they deserved it, but there's no hint, nod, or involvement of that dysfunction.  Why does the mistress of the reformatory derive such pleasure at the exercise of the girls?  There's no clear evidence to support that she's sadistic, lesbian, or any has any form of motivation besides the  fact that showing her wild grinning face seems a good way to get a reaction from the audience.  Why is the housekeeper turned stepmother so stern, and furthermore, why can't she seem to make any face other than her one stern one?

Sometimes this film goes to lengths, also, to go further into depth about things that don't deserve such treatment.  Most of the ending seems to be an attempt by the filmmakers to take control of the theme (which they don't have) by reintroducing arbitrary characters and involving them in entirely new plotlines that don't have any coherent or enthused meaning on the overall storyarch.  Basically, as soon as the Count's son inexplicably kills himself, the movie becomes saturated with false pretentions towards positivity, endurance, and ""love"" without taking the time to admit that the entire movie has already ended.

From there, the whole thing begins to fall entirely out of control and gets worse and worse until roughly about the beach scene and beyond, which if by that point you're still paying attention and caring about where the characters are going, you're just going to be lead to one of the most antithetical climaxes in film history.  Yes, the Count actually said that line, and yes, that's all you're left with.

There are various close ups of Brooks which demonstrate that she was not only a talented actress, but a true vision of beauty. Her face is absolutely flawless. Buy this movie today on DVD, you will not regret it. The DVD also contains the eighteen minute movie short, "" Windy Riley Goes to Hollywood"", where one can hear Louise Brooks talk! This was directed by Roscoe "" Fatty"" Arbuckle under an assumed name. Arbuckle's life and career were devasted by a scandal in the early 1920's, he died not long after making this film short.

This film is more sentimental, tragic, and less sexually charged than it's predecessor, and for that reason does not gain a higher rating from me (Pandora's Box being more riske`).
The film is in true black & white (no tinting on this version), and the score is a very suitable composition that is quite appropriate here. The Kino DVD is a fine piece of work and I recommend it to any fan of Brooks or the silent era.
I'm just baffled as to why no one will produce a Region 1 version of ""Pandora's Box"" on DVD, and give us Diary of a Lost Girl, (somewhat inferior in quality to Pandora's), instead. If only one Louise Brooks film should be transferred to DVD, Pandora's Box must be the first!
But Diary of a Lost Girl is still a good film, and has one or two surprises up its sleeve. I will recommend it on this feature if for no other reason: there aren't many films I can name that are quite like this and Pandora's Box; they are truly unique and quite unlike any other in the history of film.
I also recommend this DVD for the extra short-film ""Windy Riley Goes Hollywood"". Not because the short is any good, (it's actually pretty lousy), but because it was the first ""talkie"" by Louise Brooks.

*** REVIEW UPDATED OCT-22-2015 ***

A young girl goes through various trials of womanhood in this 1929 German silent classic ""Diary of a Lost Girl"", directed by the great G. W. Pabst, who often made sympathetic films about the plight of women.  Like his 1925 classic ""The Joyless Street"" (see my July 5, 2013 review of an overseas DVD edition), this film is an indictment of immorality and cruelty in European bourgeois society at the time.  American actress Louise Brooks plays the title character, who goes from a chaste teenager, to an out-of-wedlock mother, a reform school escapee, a prostitute, and a countess.  Although Brooks will always be most famous for playing the iconic Lulu in her previous film with Pabst, ""Pandora's Box"" (Criterion DVD is currently out of circulation but a new edition is in the works), ""Diary of a Lost Girl"" gives her a tremendous character arc to show her acting talent.  Like other great films of its time, ""Diary"" suffered censorship and cuts that resulted in lost footage.  Several restorations have been done in the past, and a near-complete version has been made with prints from various sources.  The Kino Blu-ray I'm reviewing (ASIN: B013CG19D0) now represents the latest restoration.

I am quite pleased with the Kino Blu-ray.  Both the film itself and the 1931 sound short ""Windy Riley Goes Hollywood"" (in which Brooks has a speaking part) are presented in HD.  Even though the print quality of ""Diary"" is far from pristine, with quite a few print damages, skipped frames, and shots of poor visual quality due to inferior print elements, the picture quality as shown on the Blu-ray is still a big improvement over the 2001 Kino DVD (ASIN: B00005QW58).  Blu-ray's high definition enables plenty of film grain to be shown.  For some, grain should be digitally removed, but for others, it should be retained in its full glory, and I belong to the latter group.  The ""Windy Rily"" sound short, however, is from the same inferior-looking and sounding print as that on the old DVD, without subtitles nor closed captioning.

Also noteworthy for me is that the Blu-ray's running speed is quite a bit faster than that on the 2001 Kino DVD.  The Blu-ray runs 109 minutes, excluding credits, and the old DVD runs 114 minutes, excluding credits.  With the Blu-ray's 4% higher speed, the film plays better, in my opinion, with actors' movement looking more natural and the pacing seeming more right.  The music accompaniment, an effective piano solo by Javier P&eacute;rez de Azpeitia, also seems faster paced as well, and for the better too.

The Kino Blu-ray inexplicably shows the film in 1.28:1 aspect ratio, resulting in the picture slightly vertically ""stretched"".  By comparison, other video editions, including the 2001 Kino DVD and a recent British Blu-ray edition, show it in 1.33:1, thus looking more correct.  To be fair, the stretched image on the Kino Blu-ray is not as severe as, for instance, that on Criterion's recent ""Dressed to Kill"" Blu-ray (a problem that has since been fixed).  In fact, I have to admit it did not bother me very much in my viewing.

The latest restoration of ""Diary"" was done by European restoration companies, and they used reconstructed German inter-titles for the restored film's worldwide release.  Kino's Blu-ray presents the same inter-titles, with optional white English subtitles that occasionally overlap with the white, rather large German titles.  Kino's old DVD, however, uses English inter-titles.

The Kino Blu-ray comes with an excellent full-length audio commentary by Thomas Gladysz, the director of the Louise Brooks Society, which is an online info archive devoted to Brooks.  Unfortunately, there are many long stretches of silence during the commentary.  Gladysz talks about the actors and crew, the film's artistry, the historical background, and the social climate at the time the movie was made.  At one point, he recommends that we check out a documentary on the life of one of the minor actors in the movie, Kurt Gerron (who plays the portly, friendly figure of the brothel), but didn't mention the title of the documentary.  That film is the 2002 Oscar-nominated feature documentary ""Prisoner of Paradise"", about Gerron's life and career that were cut short by the Nazis.

Kino's Blu-ray cover sheet is also reversible, showing the yellow cover design that is similar to the one used on the British Blu-ray/DVD edition by Eureka.

Other than the aforementioned speed difference between the Kino Blu-ray and the old Kino DVD, the two editions present the same cut of the film in terms of footage.  The 1990 Kino VHS tape, however, uses plenty of alternate footage that came from various editions of the film.  Below is my original 2001 review that compares such differences.

*** ORIGINAL 2001 REVIEW OF THE 2001 KINO DVD AND 1990 KINO VHS ***

This new Kino DVD version of DIARY OF A LOST GIRL contains footage that has been added, re-edited, and even RE-SHOT, compared to Kino's 1990 VHS version.

I did a side-by-side comparison of the DVD and the 1990 VHS tape version and found that director G.W. Pabst had apparently shot two versions of some scenes -- one version being used on the 1990 VHS version, another on this DVD. Most of the differences are minute, such as actors standing on slightly different spots or posing or gesturing a little differently. For instance, at time 00:02:39 on the DVD, Thymian (Louise Brooks) is standing at the doorway with her arms bent. But in the 1990 VHS version, the same shot shows that her arms are straight. At time 00:03:43 of the DVD, Thymian bends forward (toward camera) to pick something up on the floor. In the 1990 VHS version, she bends sideways (to viewer's right) to pick it up. A few re-shot scenes, however, have more drastic differences, with the tone and mood of the scene altered considerably. At 00:04:50, Meinert raises his eyebrows and nods at Thymian, who returns a flirtatious smile. In the 1990 VHS version, however, Meinert only smiles softly, and Thymian's expression is more restrained. At 00:07:52 of the DVD, after Thymian sees what Meinert wrote in her diary, she turns her head slowly and stares incredulously at Meinert for a moment, then locks her diary. In the 1990 VHS version, she simply locks her diary and never looks at Meinert.

Kino emailed me a list of about 80 differences between the 1990 VHS version (which they call the ""English version"") and the new DVD version (which they call the ""German version""). The list reveals there are actually some scenes on the 1990 VHS version that are not on this DVD. Regarding the re-shot scenes, the list is apparently not inclusive, for I've personally noticed a lot more re-shot footage on the DVD. For instance, the sequence in which Elizabeth the housekeeper begs Mr. Henning to let her stay but finally she has to leave is composed entirely of re-shot footage. (Note how amazing it is that these actors were able to give the same great performances twice! But since the two versions are nearly identical, one wonders why Pabst would bother re-shooting at all.)

And I haven't begun to mention the newly added footage -- scenes not on the 1990 VHS version at all, but on this DVD. The new scenes are sprinkled throughout the DVD, resulting in about 9 minutes of material, some of which quite startling. One shows the guard in the reformatory, after catching Erika putting on her makeup, uses her lipstick to write on his note book, ""Punish Erika""; then he draws a heart shape next to it, revealing to us what he exactly means by ""punish"". Another rather risque scene shows Thymian in the brothel performing some gymnastics in a swimsuit in front of her clients.

The new DVD, which Kino calls the ""German version"", still uses English title cards. Their wordings and placements have been significantly changed compared to the 1990 VHS version. The differences in placements, of course, have resulted in the film being edited differently. Some title cards now have more explicit, even risque, wordings. One reads, ""So you have had your way with the housekeeper too,"" alluding to the unspoken relation between Mr. Henning and Elizabeth. In the scene where Meinert tries to seduce Thymian, the title card shows him saying, ""I'll tell you all about Elizabeth tonight, Thymian. BIG Thymian."" The DVD has one incorrect title card. It shows what Meinert wrote in Thymian's diary to be ""Meet me 11:30 tonight."" The time should read 10:30, as indicated by a later shot of a clock. The 1990 VHS version does have the correct time on the title card.

The score used on the 1990 VHS version is a mixed bag of violin solo, piano solo, jazz, and classical orchestration.  The DVD has a more elaborate orchestration for the score. The old score is not included on this DVD.

The video transfer of the DVD came from new source material and it looks much less battered, sharper, more detailed, and better contrasted than that of the 1990 VHS version.  Still, the improved picture of the DVD is nowhere near the sparkling image quality of, say, the Criterion DVD version of HAXAN or THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC.

The DVD also includes a rarely-seen sound film that stars Brooks, titled WINDY RILEY GOES HOLLYWOOD. The sound era was believed to have ended Brooks' acting career. But in this film, her voice sounds just fine to me. The video transfer of this 18-minute 1930 comedy film has a heavily-battered picture transfer and a very hissy soundtrack (not many prints of this film exist, we are told). And there are no subtitles or closed captioning. But all the dialogs register pretty clearly. This short film is available only on the DVD version, not on the 2001 VHS version (which is not to be confused with the out-of-print 1990 VHS version that I referred to throughout this review).",1006300800,126,9797,4.879445449065702
1196243,5,B000006PE1,"WOW!!!  I never in my wildest dreams thought this silent film classic starring Louise Brooks was coming to DVD!  I thought for sure Pandora's Box (Ms. Brooks' most famous film) would come first.  And furthermore, I thought Criterion would be the company to release the film, but it looks like Kino's will have the honor.  That's not bad, either - Kino's has a LOT of good foreign/silent/independent films, and I've always liked their VCR tapes, so I'm looking forward eagerly to Diary of a Lost Girl.
For those not in the know, Louise Brooks was the ultimate flapper girl of the 1920s.  She was probably more famous for her haircut, beauty, and lifestyle than her films.  But her film legacy is firmly established by two German films she made after leaving Hollywood briefly - Pandora's Box and Diary of a Lost Girl, both by G.W. Pabst (one of the legendary silent film directors).  Both films, if you can find them, are absolute classics.  The German expressionist style has rarely been more beautifully captured than in Pandora's Box (Hitchcock used this style too in a lot of his early black/white films).  And I was lucky enough to find a beat-up VHS copy of Diary.  If you like silent films, you can't go wrong with this film either!  The imagery is stunning, Louise Brooks looks gorgeous and gives a moving performance a young lady who, having lost her virtue, is consequently shunned by society and has to learn to care for herself.  I don't like to give away plots, so that's all I'll say, but I am looking forward to owning this film on DVD!  Highly recommended!",1004227200,43,1571,4.669090909090909

7904642,4,B000006PE1,"A frank, yet puzzling offering. In part is due to the cinematic style in which Pabst filmed - the realistic, socially astute Die Neue Sachlichkeit (the New Objectivity or New Sobriety) which followed expressionism. Die Neue Sachlichkeit infused graphic subject matter with a veneer of fantasy. Although uber explicit and highly creative it can be somewhat much to absorb.

Louise Brooks, brought to Germany by Pabst for this film, is superb and decidedly *the* compelling reason to watch. Valeska Gert, cast as the sadistic wife of the reformatory master (a leering, nightmarish Andrews Engelmann) is another. Gert's inimitable performance veers into the erotically absurd. She was known for her pioneering performance art and has been called by some a groundbreaker of the punk movement. Whatever, certain scenes she played will remain seared into my brain. Go Valeska!

I recommend this overlong, terribly uneven film for its esoteric cinematic style and brave approach to forbidden subject matter. As in the sympathetic manner in which brothel workers are portrayed. The only place our betrayed, mistreated heroine Thymian finds any sort of understanding and genuine friendship.

7904644,5,B000006PE1,"an excellent film of course, decent soundtrack. What's sad regarding all old film of this era is the lack of preservation. It's so sad to see so many missing frames and overall deterioration of course, we all wish people had managed to preserve these so we could see them in a more intact presentation.

Louise Brooks is charismatic and charming, the acting is great all around. I find the story intriguing enough because there wasn't much they could portray in the silent era, either blatant comedies or dramas of this nature.

Highly enjoyable none the less.",1489968000,,560,4.822916666666667

Brooks wrote that Brooks Pabst as director refused to discuss the details of a performance with her and never held group discussions with his actors: ""He wanted the shocks of life to release unpredictable emotions."" Nor did he encourage his actors to associate with one another. ""Every actor has a natural animosity toward every other actor, present or absent, living or dead,"" she wrote, and Pabst used that tension to enhance the emotions in a scene.

The plot of the movie is a complex soap opera, with unwanted pregnancies, women forced into prostitution, and various endings of different episodes in the journey.

The reason to see the film is to see a great actress at the top of her game and in her last successful film. She plays Thymian and Ebert writes that the movie is ""entirely the story of Thymian.... Louise Brooks didn't have a personality or screen presence that lent itself to supporting roles. If both young women are victims, neither is helpless, and the men who would exploit her find their evil turned against them. In a world of cruelty, the Brooks characters stand as enduring figures. How she accomplishes this is the mystery of her acting. ""The great art of films,"" she wrote, ""does not consist of descriptive movement of face and body but in the movements of thought and soul transmitted in a kind of intense isolation.""""

As I write this review, all I can do is remember how she was able to communicate so very much with so little.

7904646,3,B000006PE1,"There are so many great reviews that give the synopsis of this 1929 silent film, but truly the only reason to watch is to view the fabulous Louise Brooks.  The film is convoluted, pieced together, and makes little sense but it is impossible to take your eyes off of Ms. Brooks and I don't know if it was that she was that good of an actress or just mesmerizing.  It's hard to believe that the film is over 80 years old and yet Brooks is as contemporary today as she was 80+ years ago.  It's worth it to buy or rent just to see her though I didn't particularly like the film or the acting of anyone else in it.  But she is so natural and it is impossible to take your eyes off her when she is on screen.",1473465600,,702,3.992857142857143
