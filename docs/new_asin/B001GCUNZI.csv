3600260,2,B001GCUNZI,"It started off pretty good. I liked the beginning when it showed the classic 1950's. It was kinda scary a few times with those 'Whisperers' The things that got to me were seeing the people burn after the plane crash, dying in the subway, and the depressing ending. Nicolas Cage did a really good job, as did everybody else, and thought the special effects were pretty cool, but toward the end seemed silly, involving some kind of alien/angel/demon thing. It was confusing toward the end. I probably wouldn't recommend KNOWING!!!",1237507200,,528,4.877777777777778
3600261,3,B001GCUNZI,"Are events random or pre-ordained?

50 years ago, the students of Dawes Elementary created a time capsule for the school's 50th anniversary.  The children created drawings depicting what they believed the future to hold.

Only one student, Lucinda, seemed almost possessed in her writing of a series of numbers instead.

Young Caleb (Chandler Canterbury) is a present day Dawes student who is handed the page with the numbers on it.  Thinking it's important, he takes it home.  His physicist Dad (Nick Cage) tells him it's just random numbers until he sets his cup down and realizes the date for 9/11 and number of fatalities are listed there.  From that one bit of information, he extrapolates all the world's catastrophes, including a few that are yet to come.

""Knowing"" answers the question I asked above, yet manages to pose more than that.  The screenplay, written by Ryne Pearson and Julie Snowden, is a tightly paced science fiction thriller that barely leaves a breath in between action sequences.  Effects are reasonably well done.

Whether you like or hate this story will well depend on your take of the above question and your personal theology.  The film is well worth watching if you are a staunch Nick Cage fan; however, some of the scenes may be too intense for 'young 13's.'

3600262,3,B001GCUNZI,"Even if Knowing didn't divide itself between supernatural thriller and mind-bending sci-fi, there's still the simple fact that the plot is hinged around a predicament so overwhelming that its conclusion can't possibly resolve itself satisfactorily - at least not to those unwilling to accept possibilities far outside the reality presented. The amount of contentment derived by the finale is subjective of course, but the majority of the film feels focused on setting the groundwork for a more linear mystery. At least director Alex Proyas' expert grasp on building suspense and crafting creative tension-filled catastrophes helps to ease the more psychologically jarring bits.

During an elementary school ""time capsule"" project, troubled young girl Lucinda opts to write down a string of seemingly random numbers instead of the expected crayon drawings of flying cars and spaceships. Fifty years later, the capsule is unearthed and Lucinda's cryptic scribbles are given to Caleb (Chandler Canterbury), the son of science professor John Koestler (Nicolas Cage). When Koestler discovers that the numbers are actually a code that pinpoints the exact day, coordinates, and death toll of every major disaster for the last five decades, he begins a desperate hunt for clues to help aid him in his quest to stop the final few numbers' ominous predictions of tragedy from coming true.

Director Alex Proyas certainly has a taste for science-fiction and nightmarish fantasy. Knowing presents itself as a psychological thriller, but early on delves into supernatural terror. If that isn't enough to rattle audiences, the leap to extreme science fiction concepts later on might be too much to handle. Although the ideas are outlandish, it's the mix of genres that is likely to disappoint viewers getting wrapped up in the nail-biting suspense.

And suspense is the most plentiful aspect in Knowing - a shocking plane crash, a devastating subway derailment and much more are done with such attention to horrifying detail, fierce white-knuckle thrills, and ear-piercing boisterousness (or the tried-and-true fear of loud noises) that admiring the film for its intensity isn't the least bit difficult. Whether or not the pondering of determinism versus randomness, the creepy occult apparitions, or the religious implications are enough to outweigh the curious path of resolution, the pacing is exceptional and the use of Beethoven's 7th symphony (2nd movement, Allegretto) really hits the spot.

3600460,4,B001GCUNZI,"Knowing is quite a good film, helped by the fact that you don't really know what is going on in the overall scheme of things for most of the movie.  Basically at Nicolas Cage's character's son's school, a time capsule was buried 50 years ago.  All the kids at the time left messages, pictures and stuff for a future kid to read.  One strange girl just left a bunch of random numbers and she was pulled kicking and screaming away before she finished it.  Not sure why the teachers would have bothered to put that into to the time capsule, but they did, and Cage's son is the lucky recipient of getting to read that one.  He steals it and takes it home, where Cage decides he'd like to copy it and writes it onto a huge whiteboard.  I guess his printer doesn't have a scan function to photocopy the thing.  Cage begins to work out the numbers are dates, and on those dates events have happened that have killed corresponding numbers.  Some dates haven't happened yet.  What should he do?

It's a simple film and overall nothing special.  But it does have some good scenes with a plane and in the subway that are alone worth watching the film for.",1509408000,,1144,4.374407582938389

Cages character is a well defined and rounded guy in the film, and the tone of the film is very much this character in its story drama and his issues. It does take a little bit before the film settles into its well done overall dramatic tone also as we get to know Cages character.

I won't give anything more away than that in piecing together an over arcing film narrative within the story's more fantastical elements.

Cons: convenient plot; ending possibly, depending on the individual

""What happens when the numbers run out?""

.

the plot

Eight-year-old Caleb and his elementary school unearths a 50 year old time capsule from the third grade class from fifty years ago.  The class of 1959 had to write a story or draw a picture of what they thought the year 2009 would look like.  Most of the children had received crayon drawings of spaceships and flying cars, but Caleb received an envelope with a piece of paper with penciled in random numbers filling up both sides of the sheet.  On the outside of the envelope the name Lucinda was scribbled on the outside giving the reader the information of at least the first name of the author of these numbers.

Caleb brought home the paper, even though it was supposed to go back to the school.  His father, John, is a pretty smart college professor who notices the numbers.  He puts it aside until later when in a fit of drunken insomnia he accidentally takes another look and notices the numbers 091120012996.  Right away the numbers 09112001 jump out at him as it would any American (09/11/2001), and as he goes on the computer he finds that the 2996 after the date is the actual number of people killed during that terrorist attacks in NYC.  There are other numbers after these, and he finds out later that they are coordinates; longitude and latitude.

As he decodes the whole sheet of paper he sees that there are now are three more dates toward the end that haven't happened yet.  Will he be able to stop these very near future cataclysmic events?  Will he be able to convince anyone?  And what about Lucinda the little girl who wrote them, what happened to her?  Find out when you watch Knowing.

the breakdown

Knowing had definitely held my attention for the full two hours, and I enjoyed most of it, but I can see how some would have some major problems with the film.  First off, these numbers, (for the most part) have all to do with events in the USA, and even more conveniently right around John's (Nick Cage) house, the guy who just so happens to have the sheet of paper and is smart enough to decipher the randomness of the numbers written.  To try and enjoy this film, this factor must be put aside and you have to accept the facts as they are laid out.

Nicholas Cage is a good choice for this kind of character.  A brilliant professor who has lost his faith either due to the fact that he grew up a pastor's son, or that his wife was killed in a fire a year ago.  My guess is probably both.  The poetry of how this unfolds comes right after the scene when John is telling his class that he believes that life is nothing but meaningless accidents, a world made up of how nothing is because of predetermination or design.  Later that night is when he finds the sheet of paper filled with numbers.  John must face the real choice he has to make, a choice he thought that he could put off until he was on his deathbed.  Does human life serve an actual purpose?  Is there actually a grand design to the universe?  It sure seems so now, doesn't it John?  Even if this is all bad news, dealing with deaths on a grand scale, it still shows undoubtedly the fear that maybe his father was right, at least partially.

Caleb was played by Chandler Canterbury, the youthful actor who portrays the young Benjamin Button in the Brad Pitt flick, seemed to fit the part.  He seemed to be perpetually sad, probably since the day his mother died, and also because his father refuses to help him feel better about the situation by not giving any affirmation on the subject of heaven at all and the possibility that he would see his mother again.

The prophecy numbers in question were given (presumably) to Lucinda by the whispering voices of a small band of ""people"" for some unknown reason.  I say the reason is unknown because there doesn't seem like there is anything you can do about future events, and the girl Lucinda probably wouldn't be able to make heads or tails of it anyway once she awakened from the trance.

Admittedly, I expected more from this.  The ending still has me undecided on how I feel about it.  For me, it gives an alternative to John's father's views, which rubs me the wrong way, and therefore it comes across as a not so subtle platform to preach it's message of deluded fantasies.  On the other hand, it was kind of imaginative, but in a juvenile way.  Ultimately, this is one of those movies where we're going to make up our own minds about how we feel about it, and depending on where we stand in life with certain beliefs - you'll either love it or hate it.

A great movie. I'm not one of those people who mock everything Nicholas Cage, although he's not one of my favorite actors either. But the story carries this film anyway. An excellent apocalyptic movie which is the first, to my knowledge, to employ the fascinating story of Ezekiel's mysterious account of UFOs and angels, in the Bible. I was surprised to learn that this film's director also directed the '90s movie THE CROW, which was one of my early favorite films. And, though my tastes have changed from that latter film's kind of story, its director has unknowingly accomodated my present tastes, with this film. KNOWING is definitely an under-rated, under-discussed masterpiece of global proportions and spiritual and theological significance. My only complaint is similar to another reviewer's only complaint (and which moves me to give this film 4 stars instead of 5, like that reviewer): the ending was so awesome but it left me hungering for more of the graphics and for clarification about the new location of the children.

He continued, 'With expert and confident storytelling, Proyas strings together events that keep tension at a high pitch all through the film. Even a few quiet, human moments have something coiling beneath. Pluck this movie, and it vibrates.' Ebert later listed it as the sixth best film of 2009.""

And the aliens give each child a white rabbit -- a bunny? It's phony mysterious symbolism, that's what it is. And then the world is destroyed? Really?

This movie grabs you, takes you for one crazy, spooky ride, and then makes you glad you stuck with it to the finish. Why only 4 stars then?  Well, I liked the ending and would've loved just a bit more clarification, but that's all.",1483920000,7,490,4.4

For a movie that is somewhat depressing I really liked the way it was done. The world is coming to an end by fire (Biblical) but Cage's son and his girlfriend / future spouse? will survive. The religious themes don't bother me in the slightest. In fact, it's part of the reason for the hope that Cage and his family have. I liked how they made the aliens appear to have 'wings' on their backs, which is exactly how traditional pictures of angels are depicted in antiquity. Might not an alien looking like these aliens be perceived as an 'angel' by someone born on Earth over 2000 years ago? I've often wondered if something like this may have happened tens of thousands of years ago . . . that the Earth may have been 'seeded' with humans, who originated elsewhere in the universe.

3601398,4,B001GCUNZI,"Well, when I watched this movie I really did not know what to expect from it, Nicolas Cage's movies are like Forrest Gump's chocolate boxes, you never know what you are going to get, however I must say that I wasn't disappointed, I mean, is not Leaving Las Vegas which will probably remain as Cage's best movie ever but it still accomplishes its purpose, it entertains and different to what many people must probably think a movie doesn't always have to be a master piece to be entertaining, if you are expecting real art you should go to a museum.

That said I must confess how amazed I am of the way how so many reviews tried to destroy this movie, I normally don't pay much attention to critics and even less to people that pretends to be one, mainly because their quality standards tend to be inconsistent, just to give you a couple of quick examples, movies like Armageddon and Titanic which are to me two of the most overrated movies ever have a better rating than Knowing, ... are you guys serious? I understand Nicholas Cage isn't probably your favorite actor but, Armageddon? Titanic? Really?

I won't talk about the plot cause to be honest with you I hate people doing that, specially if haven't seen it yet, however and going back to my previous comment If you were able to tolerate Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck together this movie should be no challenge to you, just don't expect too much from it and you might actually like it, grab your popcorn, look for a comfortable spot and give it a shot.",1447286400,,1507,4.4963503649635035

3601402,5,B001GCUNZI,"Got to admit to being a little 'bias' i've enjoyed watching most 'Nicholas Cage' films down the years, this one being no exception, Some of his early movies included 'Con-Air' 'Face/off' and 'The Rock' ( all three available on 'Blu-ray ) the first two of which transfer to this format rather well i might add.
This film ? ........50 years ago at a new school a class of pupils were asked by their teacher to draw pictures of what they think it will be like in fifty years time, the drawings would the be placed in envelopes and buried in a 'time' capsule to be opened up by a future generation of pupils 50 years down the line, one pupil 'Lucinda' fills her page with numbers that she believed voices in her head were telling her to do.
Well the 50 years has passed, the capsule is lifted from the ground, opened and the envelopes handed out, 'John's' ( Nicholas Cage ) son is handed 'lucinda's' envelope, when opened a sheet full of numbers means very little, until 'John' try's to make sense of them...chillingly the numbers seem to make accurate predictions of
forthcoming ( from 50 years earlier ) disaster's including the 9/11 attack and even giving the numbers killed.
all the dates on the paper are not used up, there is more to come, 'John' believes he can warn the authorities of what and where things will happen, but will anyone listen ?
'John' decides that he must look up 'Lucinda' but only finds her daughter 'Diane' (Rose Byrne ) 'Lucinda' had died some time earlier, at first 'Diane' does not wish to discuss her mother's predictions, but when what 'John' tells her 'happens' 'Diane' does take notice.
There is a more sinister prediction, can 'John' with his son, 'Caleb' and 'Diane' with her daughter 'Abby' find shelter using the numbers, the chase is on, also who are these people that seem to be stalking the children ? ?
This is a really good sci-fi movie, with plenty of tension along the way to maintain your interest, as my headline suggest's the special effects within are pretty awsome, a good purchase on the 'Blu-ray' format, one last thought, what is portrayed toward the end of this movie is not just sci-fi..........it could just happen ? .............enjoy.
Many Critic's have not rated this movie that highly, I think it's a cracking watch.",1446163200,,2273,4.642679900744417

3601441,4,B001GCUNZI,"I know a lot of people have less than favorable things to say about this movie.  For me, it hits just right.  I like the color pallette and the costuming.  I like the 'science for the layman' aspect.  I don't mind a little suspension of disbelief.  I like the notion of background religion that isn't overbearing, but the scifi trope that if another culture is scientifically advanced enough, we of lesser technology and knowledge my view that race as supernatural (I liked the movie Prometheus for the same reason).  I like the emotion evoked in the certain knowledge of having to say goodbye to the people we love; not just because it is inevitable for all of us, but sometimes it is also for the best.  Finally, I like that this movie's core is about having, keeping, cherishing, and releasing the relationships around us.  This was not a movie that was designed for future studies in film school, but it was a good story for a rainy night with my two toddlers-we left the room for the apocolyptic & wreck scene-, wife, and some popcorn (I might have snuck a milk-stout in too).  I got to use my 'what-if(?)' and 'what-would-you-do(?)' imagination discussing what we would do in similar circumstances with my wife.  We didn't have to think to hard, though, either.  So, bottom line.  It was fun and quick and even if the writing was a little bit thin, the actors, wardrobers, set designers, and location scouts really did a good job (I mean, I would love to have that house Nick Cage's character lived in!).  How many reviews compliment the behind the scenes folks, eh?  Ha ha.",1440633600,,1580,4.616487455197133

3601499,3,B001GCUNZI,"WARNING! Meh. Not the best film I've seen but not the worst. I don't usually write reviews of movies that are average, simply because the average tends to sort itself out. The makers of this film held their cards too close to the vest for too long. The premise and eventual ending were definitely interesting but they just didn't deliver with a real 'Main' character. I like Nicholas Cage, big fan. This was not his best work. Could have been much better without the sudden ending and some allusions to said ending. No spoilers. Watch it if you like...still meh. Oh, and the WARNING! was just because of the douche who put that up to make you watch the movie.",1438214400,2,659,4.5

3601548,3,B001GCUNZI,"Meh... I thought it was okay. I would caution, as another reviewer did, that for some reason people feel compelled to put spoilers in their reviews so consider that when reading (there will be no spoilers here).

If you're looking for a Dooms Day flick, as I was, I don't feel this is entirely satisfying. It is a lot more focused on spirituality than traditional sci-fi -ness, so if you're not into that you probably won't be into this (and vice versa - if you really like 'God-y' things then you may find this movie exceptional). I felt the beginning moved quickly/at a good pace to let us know what was going on, but there were scenes that were overly drawn out and just made me roll my eyes at the Director's poor attempt to add dramatic effect. This was most overly done in the final scene. It felt like someone just didn't want their story to end so they held us hostage for two full minutes of nothing but same-ness and over-loud musical accompaniment. By the end I was honestly just glad it was over.",1435622400,2,1008,4.419354838709677

3601679,5,B001GCUNZI,"Excellent story line, excellent production. My only caveat is that Koestler (the main character) confused the planning done for him, his son, and humanity with the assurance of an afterlife. I lost that thread, if there was one. Anyway, the movie is well worth seeing (as I have thrice).",1425945600,,287,4.877551020408164
3601680,2,B001GCUNZI,"Great idea for a movie but horribly executed.

Let's get the most obvious things out of the way...completely horrible acting by almost all characters as well as the writing. No worries, Cage just parks his truck ANYWHERE along a busy street in downtown NY to go underground in the subway and miraculously, it is still there probably at least 30 min later (would have gotten towed in a heartbeat in real life). When they decide to go 'underground', the leading lady Diana, is quite familiar with where everything is in his kitchen even though she has been to the house 1 time! Cage kneeling down when the ship comes (over-dramatic). Why such big ships for only 2 children?!?! What? They need to do more research into the science of these events and at least make an effort to marginally portray the real deal if a solar flare were to really hit.

Granted, I decided to watch the movie because I was bored and feeling sick...I am an atheist, so I told myself I could just pretend these angels were aliens! But, again, it is hard for me to not comment on religion as a whole. This movie just yanks my chain...religion seems like a sick, perverted joke. Why do these supreme being like to watch humans grow up and screw up a whole world? It is like a child with a really screwed up ant farm and when the entire farm is about to be destroyed, he takes 2 of them and places them elsewhere to watch it happen all over again. Weird and twisted. And why even have ships in the first place?!? Didn't god make everything and everyone? Why not just beem me up Scotty to the new planet? Why even let the flare happen? Why not let the flare happen and restart from the very, very beginning again (Adam#2 and Eve #2!) It seems weird to me that people want to worship something that is basically us in a glass jar with things watching us all the time...

Lastly, more about the movie itself...I will give that the movie has a concept that could go somewhere. Heck, I would even say that this movie could have gone almost in an Ender's Game (later books) sort of way. This was not a scary movie but they tried to make it scary with the music, lighting and creepy men and places. Why are they visiting that trailer at night? Why did they have to make those men super, duper creepy and scary looking? What was the point in that? What is up with that music? They went WAY overboard with the way they tried to portray the movie as scary.

I wish they did a later shot of the earth completely destroyed way after the flare.

Definitely not a movie I would recommend to someone looking for a legit entertaining movie with good acting. It is fine for a boring, lazy afternoon.",1425859200,,2652,4.371196754563894

3601985,5,B001GCUNZI,This a movie about a little girl in the 50's that could see into the future.  In a elementary school class assignment.  All the kids where given the assignment to draw pictures of what they thought the future would look like to put into a time castle.  For the class of kids 50's years later to open it up.  The little girl wrote a bunch of numbers that predicted every event that happened in life.  Up to the year the castle was opened.  Which was the end of the world!!,1406246400,,471,4.177777777777778

3602057,3,B001GCUNZI,"SPOILER ALERT!
It was OK and seems to be generating debate, which is usually a good thing. To me it is pretty clear that the intent was as an ""I Told You So"" fantasy from the Rapture crowd that chickened out at the end and introduced aliens instead. In that sense, it's a bit broken. If I had to guess, the Studio got involved and changed the ending at some point.

I think people are finding it ""spiritual"" because it does some good work between the characters and plays on universal themes about parenting, family, loss, etc.

All the symbolism from religion, conspiracy-theory stuff, and cosmology doesn't really add up to anything coherent. I'm giving it 3 stars for being an entirely competent thriller/drama and having very good special effects.",1404086400,,751,4.769230769230769

I had never seen the movie before but caught the last half of it on television so ordered the movie to see the whole thing.
To keep from spoiling all but the ending all I will say is you MUST watch this excellent movie which ends with the entire world being destroyed, all but a select few human beings and Cage is NOT one of them. Now that you know that, go order the movie from Amazon, forget the popcorn, take the phones and turn them off and prepare for a thoroughly good movie!",1402272000,,554,4.285714285714286

I won't drop any spoilers, but I found this movie very interesting personally because I know a number of people who believe what happens in this film is our real destiny as a species. To them, however, these events are something to be celebrated while this movie is a horror movie (or at least a very intense movie). ""Recognizing"" those ""real world"" elements, in fact pulled me out of the movie in a way that makes it rather hard for me to say whether I thought the film was well-done or not.

There's a little bit of stereotyping about teachers; the story was confused. . . it didn't make sense. . . it couldn't decide what kind of movie it was. It was very confusing about who the characters appearing in the darkness were. . . there were always frightening, and yet he let the children go with them.

So, it's one of these films you can watch over and over again, or at least I can.  The one thing about this film, is the whole film has some kind of dark mood to the movie.  Sometimes I think of movies as depressing, but I think of this movie as entertaining.  It has some scenes with it's dark atmosphere.  It has an interesting plot of numbers on a paper representing numbers of events where a certain number of people died, and a couple of events haven't happened yet and are yet to happen in the movie.  It gets really fast pace and intense when John is anticipating the next event.

3602124,1,B001GCUNZI,"I'm a big fan of Cage so I thought I'd give this a shot.  Knowing has an intriguing, atmospheric opening flashback, set 50 years ago when a school time capsule is buried, but the movie quickly falls apart when it moves to the present day.  Plot is largely incoherent with holes big enough to drive a truck through.  Various allusions to the Bible, angles, and End of Days apparently has persuaded many people into thinking its somehow spiritual, but I don't see it.  This movie will appeal to people who like to think that many will be lost and just a few saved when the ""end"" comes.  Of course, those folks invariably believe they will be included in the ""saved"" minority.  Anyway, the movie has a trite ""dues ex machina"" ending, standard fallback when the director has painted himself into a corner and doesn't know what else to do.  In summary, another 2 hours out of my life and 4 bucks out of my wallet that I'll never get back.",1395532800,,933,4.452941176470588

The rest of the cast is good except for Miss Bryne who is given the pathetic role of a hysterical women. Not a movie that will inspire a cheery mood.

It's not even a cursory examination of spirituality, for that matter.  This adventure is a curious mix of numerology, occult visuals and popular Christian themes as the protagonist ""peels away the onion layers"".
The Christian themes and imagery, however, are just feedstock for a ""here's what's REALLY behind the curtain"" proposition.  (I'm trying not to spoil.) This being the case, the notion that this film is spiritually evocative misses the uprights--wide left.",1380499200,4,590,5.32258064516129

I don't know if this movie becomes suspenseful after the first 48 minutes, but that's all I cared to watch. Everything seems rather or entirely predictable. Or, more accurately, simply not engaging. The performances are okay, but none of them are exemplary. The special effects are grandly spectacular, but without engaging characters and plot, they're no more than bright lights on the screen and loud noise through the speakers. The premise of the plot is as promising as anything on film regarding clairvoyance. But it just didn't deliver for me, or, as the hundreds of Amazon reviews seem to imply, a great many other viewers.

However, the story line never gets deep enough to develop any of the characters, or the issues implied - it's just superficial. The story also never commits to a belief, either in the religions of science, spiritualism, or Christianity - no sides are taken. Too bad.

The movie was entertaining enough to watch the whole thing (usually I will turn it off if it's a bore). Lastly, I think the video is typical of contemporary cinema, without any depth. Sorry.",1376611200,2,536,4.702127659574468

Gage stands out and carries most of the acting chores in the film. The supporting cast do their job competently while scenic design and Directing aid in making this one of the better science fiction films around. One can debate whether or not the ending is a let down from the quality of the remainder. I am on the fence on the issue.

3602312,4,B001GCUNZI,"Heard about this one through a friend and with some urging I tried it out. As I am no Nicolas Cage fan I was prepared to hate it but VERY surprisingly, I really liked this movie. A different kind of take on the End-Of-The-World genre of films. Just moody enough, just visually appealing enough, and with a REALLY toned down, almost somber performance by Nicolas Cage. Who knew? Without spoiling the plot, the synopsis is that a set of discovered numbers ends up being a kind of code that points the way to specific dates of disastrous events that have occurred and will occur. This apparently also includes the end of the world. Rent this for a reasonable price on something like Amazon Instant and approach openly to the film. You will be as pleasantly surprised as I was.",1370304000,,773,4.568345323741007

3602314,5,B001GCUNZI,"""Knowing"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: In 1958, as part of the dedication ceremony for a new elementary school, a group of students is asked to draw pictures to be stored in a time capsule. But one mysterious girl fills her sheet of paper with rows of apparently random numbers instead. Fifty years later, a new generation of students examines the capsule's contents and the girl's cryptic message ends up in the hands of young Caleb Koestler. But it is Caleb's father, professor John Koestler, who makes the startling discovery that the encoded message predicts with pinpoint accuracy the dates, death tolls and coordinates of every major disaster of the past 50 years. As John further unravels the document's chilling secrets, he realizes the document foretells three additional events -- the last of which hints at destruction on a global scale and seems to somehow involve John and his son. When John's attempts to alert the authorities fall on deaf ears, he takes it upon himself to try to prevent more destruction from taking place. With the reluctant help of Diana Wayland and Abby Wayland, the daughter and granddaughter of the now-deceased author of the prophecies, John's increasingly desperate efforts take him on a heart-pounding race against time until he finds himself facing the ultimate disaster -- and the ultimate sacrifice.

The cast led by Nicolas Cage (as John Koestler) is excellent! The directing by Alex Proyas (who did the adaptation to the story) (who also directed ""The Crow"" (1994), ""Dark City"" (1998, also story & screenplay) & ""I, Robot"" (2004) is excellent! The story by Ryne Douglas Pearson & the screenplay by Pearson, Juliet Snowden, Stiles White (both who also did the screenplay to ""Boogeyman"" (2005) & the upcoming ""Poltergeist"" (2011) & Stuart Hazeldine is excellent!

The music by Marco Beltrami (who also did the music to Proyas' ""I, Robot"" & was nominated for an Oscar for his work on ""3:10 To Yuma"" (2007) & recently did the music to ""Max Payne"" (2008) & the upcoming ""Repossession Mambo"" (2009) is excellent! The cinematography by Simon Duggan (who also did the cinematography to Proyas' ""I, Robot"" & recently did the cinematography to ""The Mummy: Tomb Of The Dragon Emperor"" (2008) is excellent! The film editing by Richard Learoyd (who also did the film editing to Proyas' ""I, Robot"" & also did the cinematography to ""Jet Li's Fearless"" (2006) is excellent! The casting by Gregory Apps & Teresa Redlin is excellent! The production design by Steven Jones-Evans is excellent! The art direction by Sam Lennox is excellent! The costume design by Terry Ryan (who also did the costume design to ""King Kong"" (2005) is excellent!

This is an excellent thriller that keeps your heart racing and your mind thinking. This is different and more original than one might think. This is one of Nicolas Cage's better movies.",1369526400,,2866,4.979123173277662

3602397,1,B001GCUNZI,"I will just point out the things that strike the most either because of being non sensical or being plain creepy in this movie.
COMPLETE SPOILERS ahead:

1.-The Lucifer people (Lucifer being known as the first name or angel name of the devil) are the ""saviors"" of these ""preselected"" kids.
2.- The fact that the girl is completely ok with her mom's death.
3.- There are no people on the street when the actual flare occurs, right after John drives through hundreds of them.
4.- If John believed that the location of the woman that wrote the numbers was the ""safe"" place why didn't he even tried  to tell anybody else except the her daughter about it?
5.- How easily John gives up his child to complete strangers, after they're called Lucifer people just because he knows what's happening with the solar flare.
6.- There are no reports from ANY space agency until THE LAST minute. No one else asks John any questions.
7.- The fact that the main character is named John, just like the person who wrote the book ""Revelation"" or Apocalypse.
8.- How aliens in their ""human"" form resemble the evil alien children from the Children/Village of the Dammed movies:
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054443/
9.- The children singing, ""This little light of mine. I'm gonna let it shine"" in the ceremony when they're taking the capsule with the envelope that Lucinda wrote out.
10.- How come no authorities became involved in John's quest? He called the FBI for the train accident. When the alien shows up at his house and shows the kid what was going to happen was an opportunity to freak out and call the police. Also, how come he was a witness in all those accidents and yet no authority tries to interrogate him?
11.- The 666 in the pan when John is watching the news and sees there are going to be 81 dead on the train accident on the piece of paper.

Let's break those few things down.
1.- There are certain crazy conspiracy theories about how mankind is nothing but an alien experiment. That we're constantly under surveillance to see how we behave. That is something the movie could have pulled from. Why did the producers decided then to call them Lucifer people?  If that's not disturbing I don't know what it is. What gives the aliens the right to select kids to proliferate other planets? And most importantly why is salvation of the human race associated with Satan in this movie?
2.-The most creepy part is when the girl replies ""I know"" to John trying to explain what's going on with her mom with complete indifference. Not a sense of relief, or sorrow or anything but complete indifference. That is also disturbing.
3.-After all the disasters that are shown throughout the movie with people going under explosions in a plane crash and people being run over by a derailed train why did they refrain to show the rest of the catastrophe?  Are they pretending to have some decency while they give the message of the movie?
4.-This is just your typical movie disconnection. John could have asked for help and on the meantime help get his friends and family saved. Of course, little he knew that the location was nothing but a pickup point.
5.- This does not make sense at all and I completely disagree with what other reviewers mentioned about ""knowing"" in this film as an act of faith. Because first of all, if he started believing in what his father the preacher mentioned he realizes these are NOT angels. Secondly, they are named Lucifer people, several times by the girl and everybody seems to be ok with it. Even in the end the son of a preacher who's in the middle of an spiritual crisis because of the events he's being involved with.
6.-Another ""poetic license"" with movies completely stop making any sense in order to push the story forward. Sometimes because of time limitations.
7.- John and Lucinda, the names of the protagonist and the girl who writes the message. John being the name of the prophet who is known as writing the Apocalypse, the book in The Bible that predicts what happens at the end of this movie. Lucinda, it basically means ""light"" in Latin, just like Lucifer does: http://wiki.name.com/en/Lucinda
8.-Just go to the IMDB link and search for the Children of the Dammed or Village of the Dammed. A movie about a group of creepy evil kids who exert mind control in people and are ALSO aliens.
9.-Again they leave out the part that mentions satan in the song. http://www.hymns.me.uk/this-little-light-of-mine-favorite-hymn.htm and how come the children in a public school where a resentful father(John) who fought with his own father(the preacher) are singing that song?
10.-This just doesn't make any sense and is one of those things they use to push the story forward, but it leaves the story less believable.

All in all in a very brief, yet incomplete manner I have to say in this review this movie left me with a sense of insulting my intelligence and not closing any loop holes or questions it leaves open.
Because:
1.- It is perfectly ok for the Lucifer people to take away your loved ones.
2.- According to the movie what was believed to be angels are actually demons who are associated in their name. Further down the road it turns out that demons are according to the movie, actually aliens who want to preserve selected people from mankind by saving them from the solar flare and taking them to another planet.
3.- It is supposed to be ok to believe that ""knowing"" is believing that aliens can save your children.
4.- The lack of common sense in the movie.
5.- The agenda to portray Lucifer people as the knows you have to ""know"" about and the ones who save mankind.

Though the movie is tedious and unimaginative, it makes up for it at the end where, in the best British detective tradition, the characters avoid distracting action by standing around and explaining what the hell the movie has been about, which apparently is that hateful aliens come to your planet, steal your children, kill you and yours, then destroy your planet.
At its best -- even at its mediocre -- science fiction is about possible futures bounded only by the imagination of the writer.
This movie, on the contrary, is about no future, so there is no point in imagining anything.

You will not be able to press a remote button to get to the option menu. You will have to fast forward through the movie previews to get to it.

It is 1959. The teacher, Miss Taylor (Danielle Carter), instructs her students to draw a picture for the time capsule they are going to bury on the school grounds. 50 years from now, they will unseal it and bring up the time capsule for the children then to see their drawings. A particular girl, Lucinda (Lara Robinson) does not make a drawing. Instead, she is in a hurry to write a series of numbers on the paper. It fills the entire page. Is it a formula? Being impatient, Miss Taylor takes it from her.
 After the time capsule is buried, Lucinda disappears. Miss Taylor finds her in a school closet with her fingers bloody from scratching the wood. She says she hears whispers.
 Now it is 50 years later in 2009. Caleb Koestler (Chandler Canterbury) attends the time capsule ceremony at his school. The envelope he is given contains the paper with the series of numbers. The other kids got a drawing.
 At home, John Koestler (Nicolas Cage) tells his son that he has to take the paper back to school. It is their property.
 Later, John accidentally puts a drinking glass on the paper. It makes a wet ring. He dries it off, but with the ring, he recognizes something. He begins to write the first few numbers on his white board. He discovers it has to do with 9/11 (September 11, 2001). The other numbers have to do with other tragedies and disasters. Now he is left with the last set of numbers. He is horrified. It has to do with tomorrow. He is in the knowing.

Also in the cast: Rose Byrne, D.G. Maloney, Nadia Townsend, Alethea McGrath, Liam Hemsworth.

 The rest of this movie might as well be from an episode of ""The X-Files"" or worse.

3602441,4,B001GCUNZI,"This is an interesting film, because it defies typical Doomer Fiction stereotypes.  It could, obviously, be considered a disaster movie as well as apocalyptic -- but it also strays into themes that could represent science-fiction and/or Christianity and other forms of spirituality, depending on how the viewer chooses to interpret what they see.  Without giving away too much, expect to see allusions to what may or may not be Angels, Extraterrestrials, the Tree of Life, and Adam and Eve; as well as the vision seen by Ezekiel in 1:4-6 of the Old Testament, which some have interpreted as a description of an encounter with an alien spacecraft as seen through the eyes of a Bronze Age prophet with no frame of reference to help him explain what he was seeing.  Best of all, I think, the film makes no hamfisted attempts to tell you what you're seeing; the viewer is free to interpret it however they see fit, and the film's final moments speak a great deal about Faith, forgiveness, new beginnings, and letting go.",1361491200,,1016,4.7942857142857145

I happened upon it, read the synopsis, and bought it.  I'm not a big fan of Nicholas Cage, but he was understated (and therefore good) in this film.  A Harvard astrophysisist (Cage) becomes convinced that something terrible is about to happen to the entire Earth, due to a page of a child's seemingly meaningless series of numbers that has been buried in a time capsule for 50 years.  It seems to have foreknowledge of 9/11 and other disasters.  As Cage's character gradually unravels the mystery, a truly frightening picture takes shape.

As with many apocalyptic blockbusters it doesn't bear close scrutiny but it does entertain reasonably well for a couple of hours. There's nothing very notable about it apart from its rather gloomy portentousness. This isn't a cheery movie, and it would have benefited greatly from some humour to diffuse the unrelenting sense of impending doom.

3602483,2,B001GCUNZI,"There's a reason this movie has an average of but 3 stars.  I'd hoped that those who suggested it was for ""intelligent viewers who liked to question"" would prove to be right.  I like movies that leave one pondering, but this didn't cut it, not for me or my husband. The behavior of the mother of the little girl, (once that mother discovered that her mother had been right), was unbelievable, as was the main character's repeated failure to accept that he was powerless. I'm wrong, if  the central message is, ""We delude ourselves when we imagine we are in control, and can outmaneuver, or force our will upon, spiritual forces.""  If I'm wrong, it deserves more stars. But, it was never clear as to whether it dealt with spritual beings, or space travellers from elsewhere in the universe.  Not all stories are mysteries; and many good stories leave outcome conclusions to the viewer or reader.  However, a good mystery provides clear clues, foreshadowings, to all the answers, if one watches it closely enough.

We will implode one way or another, whether you believe it to be by god, or aliens. I believe it will be by us humans and mother nature. look at what we are doing to our home, our planet.

I won't bother to list all the ways that the various parts of the film did not hang together LOGICALLY because with hundreds of reviews and comments before me surely these must have been covered and I don't want to be here all night just to defend saying that this was a silly film. I am pretty forgiving about big-buck films and small-buck films. But this one was a bomb across the board however one want's to classify it.  Even seeing it largely as a religious film it falls quite short of the average ones that make the big screen. Of course it is above Bibleman, even though Bibleman does actually does move some viewers and get a few high ratings.",1352678400,,919,4.4
3602508,5,B001GCUNZI,"What a deeply spiritual film about love and trust! Love between parents and children, and the mercy extraterrestrial aliens have for human beings. It's also about trust in a Supreme Being (God). My favorite line in the entire movie is: ""This (Life) is not the end! and the reply,""I know!"" It's also about the ultimately ridiculous dichotomy between spirituality and science! What a brilliant and cathartic story!

One must be patient while watching Knowing. This is NOT a film for children, the faint of heart or someone looking for a good time! The story does not come together until the very end. There's also a lot of hysterics! How would any us react in such a desperate situation? Knowing, is about making personal sacrifices! It's not a story to make the viewer feel comfortable!

I could have done without the graphic violence of one disaster after another! But Knowing makes a point of not taking this life for granted and that one should live in the present moment as much as possible! The other obvious message is that loving relationships between people are the most important part of being human!

I was reminded while watching Knowing of my Astronomy professor, who said, ""Human beings would be like ants to an advanced extraterrestrial civilization. Why would they care about us?"" Maybe they would care about us! Knowing makes its case that it's certainly plausible!

Thank you Hollywood for making a mature Science Fiction film for an adult audience! It took a lot of courage to make a movie so deep in a world so crass and shallow!

It has some beyond reality themes, but they are not so far out that you lose ineterest.  There are many scenes that encourage you to stretch your brain and think.  These ideas have been expressed by other reviewers. who have described them more completely.  There was one scene at the beginning where Cage's character is giving a college lecture and brings a philosophy question to the students - is everything completely determined by what has happened in the past?

3602515,3,B001GCUNZI,"We saw the movie ""Knowing"" last night. At first it was riveting and Nicholas Cage did very well as the pivotal character. The disaster scenes were well done and the premise of clues coming out of the ground by way of the time capsule captured my imagination. That's where it all ended. We weren't told anything substantial about the young girl who had formulated the codes, the ""angel/aliens"" seemed to appear without purpose or explanation, the interaction between Nicholas Cage and his estranged parents was not explained further, and the business about the black pebbles, the images of God and the prophet, the rabbits and the concocted ""spacecraft"" went by the board. It certainly didn't make sense that the characters seemed not to be bothered by 150 degree heat as the solar flare was evolving - Cage still had on his jacket and no one was sweating or even discussing the heat! In the end, the movie left the viewer wishing for more, but receiving little. Despite the promise of a blockbuster ending, it all came to naught.

3602516,1,B001GCUNZI,"I have mixed feeling about this movie. I like it and I abhor it.

I like the movie-making craft of it.

I abhor the psychological manipulation and propaganda. This movie uses sci-fi and suspense techniques to dishonestly deliver an ultimate message of one-sided religious salvation.

That, is disgusting.

On one hand, this is an entertaining film with good acting. It kept me guessing all the way to the end. The acting was very good because I believed in and had feelings for the struggles of the characters. I wanted them to succeed. I wanted them to survive. The special effects were quite good (but somewhat derivative and familiar), the disasters elicited my sympathy and compassion for the victims. The plot had plenty of twists and plenty of ""Oh, I didn't see that one coming"" situations and some of the visual effects were quite remarkable.

On this level, the film could have been a major winner.

Until the end of the thing, the great final reveal (which I waited for two hours to discover). Then, I felt a wave of major disappointment -- no, more, I felt used and cheap. Oh, I got the reveal all right, and it was a derivative disappointment.

You see, it is revealed in the end that this movie is a quasi-religious morality tale masquerading as a science fiction/paranormal thriller. It sinks into a mindless and soulless symbolic religious exposition of the then popular ""Rapture - Armageddon"" tripe that some religious groups hope and pray to take place as soon as possible. I, for one, am sick of having this stuff appear on TV and the movies so much.

And with that bit of nasty trickery, the movie went, in my mind from a major winner to a major loser.

***** Spoiler Alert ****

It turns out that the real protagonists in the movie are mysterious men in long coats who appear and whisper to children (that in itself is extremely creepy). Adults can see them, but they won't talk to (or whisper to) adults. Why Not? Who are they? Oh, and they drive cars.

A. Are they time travelers from the future come to change history?
B. Are they beings from another dimension, an alternate Universe getting crossed with ours?
C. Are they benign space aliens?
D. Are they semi-benign angel/aliens who aren't so benign; they'll save some people but not others.

The correct answer is D, and the people they save are two children and two bunnies to take them to a new planet where they can re-start the human race. There's even a big tree in a meadow filled with wheat on this brave new world. For symbolism, remember the Biblical ""separate the wheat from the chaff"" of the gospels and you get some of the judgement morality going on here.

The bunnies obviously represent innocence and fertility, and of course have a link to Easter, which represents the religious resurrection and all that stuff. Talk about driving home a point!

--------------------------------

There is often a certain amount of awe in science fiction films that feature benign aliens. They are advanced, strange, mysterious, and likeable. This movie tried to use some of these aspects to win our awe and admiration, but my thinking is they are worse than the Martians from ""War of the Worlds"".

Why?

At least the Martians were honest. They wanted to conquer the planet. They wanted to kill everybody for no other reason than to kill them and take over the planetary resources.

The aliens in this movie are righteous messengers who only save the supposedly innocent. No adults are innocent, of course, because in Rapture thinking, everyone over the age of 6 is worthy of destruction, except the Rapturists who make this stuff up themselves.

This is religious Us-vs-Them thinking and reeks of self righteousness. It helps to remember that the concept of the Rapture was invented by a 12 year old Scottish girl in the 19th century who was overcome by a fever. So save the children, the aliens must in this tripe... and to hell - literally - with everyone else.

Which happens at the very end. As predicted, the earth is consumed by fire (a popular Biblical prophecy) from a massive Solar Flare (not suggested in the Bible). No one survives, the earth is consumed - yes, even the animals are guilty, guilty, guilty - sinful creatures that they are! Humanity in the form of children - and Bunnies, the only innocents in the animal kingdom - get a new lease on life on a new planet in a galaxy far far away. Where the aliens deposit them and then leave. That's right, two kids have no need of parents, education, the protection of what society can offer... just some wheat (for food) and a tree which, if memory serves, they'd better stay well clear of!

This movie has some clever plot twists, some very good special effects, plenty of accidents and destruction to satisfy the most blood thirsty in the audience. On that level, it works as a moderately cheap thriller.

It's the overwhelming and smarmy sense of self righteousness that overtakes the last 30 minutes or so that is nauseating.

We've seen great movies about benign space aliens, The Cocoon series, ET the Extra Terrestrial, Close Encounters, AI, and others. So we are set up to expect benign space aliens to be honest and decent folk.

This movie is ultra cheap because it plays on that sense we have developed from truly great films, and delivers a bunch of self righteous fakes. The aliens appear benign in the end (though creepy at the beginning). How benign is it to separate a young boy from his father (don't worry kid, you're going to survive but your Dad is going to burn in Hell!) But the aliens are thin, tall and glowy-glowy, so they must be really cool guys. NOT.

Watch the skies, watch the skies!

And don't listen to strange men in long coats who like to whisper.

Better, don't buy this movie. Rent it if you must. Although it is on TV,

So just wait for it. But be ready to tune to another channel.

I suggest Bugs Bunny.",1345334400,8,5879,4.647683397683398
3602567,3,B001GCUNZI,"Knowing(released Mar/09)starring Nicholas Cage,is an ambitious movie which works on several levels,trying to be many things,all leading to one bigger dynamic. Does it succeed?....let's see.
Cage is an astrophysics teacher,and a widower with a young boy to raise. With flashbacks we see that the public school his son attends is opening a time capsule,50 years after it was put into the ground. Back then a class was picked to submit drawings from each student to put into it. One student's submission was just a seeming jumble of numbers;meaningless. Each student upon the capsule's opening is given one of the letters,and Cage's son receives the page of numbers. He brings it home and dad takes a close look at it. Through some research he discovers the numbers are actually dates,map coordinates and a body count. The older dates and places correspond to incidents and accidents which have taken lives,quite accurately indeed. When he becomes personally involved in one of the incidents that has been seemingly predicted,he knows he has come upon something extraordinarily mind and life changing.
He finds out that the girl who originally wrote the paper has passed away,but he manages to track down her daughter,who herself has a young daughter. The daughter does not take his presence and persistence with any grace at all. She promptly leaves,wanting nothing to do with Cage. However circumstances will draw the pair back together. In the meantime Cage becomes personally involved with further predictions and incidents. Also his son is being increasingly visited by men,unknown. They talk to him,whispering,and telling him they want him to come with them. Cage eventually sees them too,but cannot understand their purpose.
When the two parents come together once more they go to her mothers house. There Cage discovers further mysterious clues,especially some strange black,smooth stones;the same type that one of the strange men had already given to his son. While there four men appear and surround the vehicle with both children inside. Cage's son has the where with all to honk the horn,which scares the men off and gets the attention of the parents,who comes swiftly running. Cage goes after the men and actually finds and confronts one. But Cage is blinded by an extremely bright light which emanates from the man's mouth.
Cage re-examines the document's last lettering to find 33. His lady friend thinks it is EE,not two three's. Cage agrees,saying it stands for""everyone else"".The last date is finally approaching and it is the day she said her mother told she would die. Cage gets a brainstorm and goes back to MIT where his worst fears are realized. There is a gigantic solar storm headed Earth's way which will wipe out all life as it is known. At first it is thought that hiding in a cave will do the trick and that is where they start off to go. But along the way Cage realizes this storm will kill everything,no matter how far underground they go. The place where they should be going is in or near her mothers home. However she has taken both children,and while at a gas station the strange men arrive and take both kids. She follows them but is killed by a side swiping transport truck. Cage arrives at the scene only to find her dead body. He continues on to her mothers home,driving into the forest until he comes onto a dry riverbed full of the self same smooth rocks that he has seen over and over. Following the river bed he finds not only the children but the men. It would seem these are not ordinary men. His answer soon comes as a spaceship hovers above,sending down an energy platform in which to transport up....the aliens and just the children. The whispering was only heard by the children and as such was meant ONLY for them. Father Cage has a tearful send off with his son as he and the girl are taken into the spaceship.
We see that there are other ships around the world also leaving the planet,presumably with similar human cargo. This has been a bare minimum rescue mission for the aliens to keep alive and someday repopulate the Earth. Cage returns to his father and mothers home and we see the surface of the Earth consumed by fire,taking all life with it. The children are then seen on a far distant alien planet,set for their new life there.
Had the movie ended either when Cage is on his knees as the spaceship lifts away with the children,or after we see a plethora of spaceships leaving the earth,that would have been a much better,and I think,a more intelligent ending. As it is,watching the earth being destroyed and the children on some distant alien world,is really unnecessary and gratuitous. And speaking of gratuitous,the violence during the subway train wreck scene,should never have been shown. A runaway subway car runs smack dab into another,sending it careening off its tracks and into a crowded subway station. We get to see many,many folks dying of some horrible injuries,from many angles including inside the train. This was just mindless and senseless killing in grimy detail which I thought detracted from the film terribly.
Cage and company do a good job in the acting department,and a good sense of suspense is kept going throughout the film.
Technically speaking the film is in its' original w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp. There are two featurettes on the films making and commentary.
All in all this is a nice film starring Cage,which could have been better. There are alot of divergent elements that come together in the end,but it seems at times the film is trying to do a little too much at once. That coupled with the weaker ending and the violence for violence sake,takes away from the films punch. 3 1/2 stars. Recommended.",1345334400,,5709,4.844421699078812
3602568,5,B001GCUNZI,"I loved this movie, I have watched it many times. I believe in Aliens, physic happenings, so for me it was an awesome movie. It very spiritual, but it made me feel just how small and vulnerable we are in this universe. THAT'S OK THOUGH.",1345075200,,236,4.266666666666667
3602569,3,B001GCUNZI,I rented this movie to watch and found it reasonably entertaining for most of the film.  However when it came time to start tying up loose threads at the end it turned cliche and left me unsatisfied and disappointed.,1344902400,,216,4.538461538461538
3602570,5,B001GCUNZI,"What a huge disappointment!

The first hour of KNOWING is absolutely wonderful, containing some of the most exquisitely beautiful effects work and cinematography I have ever seen.  The story is riveting, the characters compelling and at least two - no, three; no four disaster sequences are both gorgeous and shocking in terms of the imagery, editing and dynamic sound effects.  The cinematography by Simon Duggan is always stunning.

However, early in the film,when the son is hearing ""voices,"" I began to worry and warned my friend that this sequence is apparently related to a subplot ""where we probably do not want to go.""  Boy, was I right:  the final forty minutes is garbage.  Just awful, the result of an over-written script and dopey ideas that take us nowhere.  The point is that the kid rises to Heaven at the end.  Heaven is pretty, but the feeling is of total Hell.  How could what began as an excellent movie be turned into such crap?

I will still buy a used copy of KNOWING in blu ray (the only way to see it) which Amazon.com carries beginning at $2.80.  The effects sequences in the first hour demand extra viewing.  The problem is the horrible last forty minutes.  Even with friends over, I will not show this film in its entirety.  If you need a conclusion or what people like to call ""closure"" - and this film could die of closure - read a book.

I rated this film five stars.  The  disappointment of the last forty minutes is almost lethal, but the preceding hour is so incredible - almost magical -- that I must concede and give it five stars for its beauty and suspense.",1342483200,2,1594,4.572438162544169
3602571,1,B001GCUNZI,"such crap? It's unbelievable.

The ""whisper people"" aka aliens, aka angels of some sort came to the doomed humanity with the sole purpose to save two kids and two bunnies. Even if you presume there were more of these aliens all over the world and they had planned to save more kids and bunnies (maybe some other fauna, it's hard to find any sense in this devastatingly stupid story.

Fifty years of whispering to no end. They might have just landed and grabbed those kids. It would have taken a few minutes at best.

3602572,4,B001GCUNZI,"I have a guilty secret: I really rather enjoyed this film. I know that is wrong of me. On finishing it and recommending it to a friend, he told me it was something to do with scientology. For those in the know, this is apparently quite obvious, but for me it was not clear at all. Instead I just enjoyed the story for what it was.

Some people may think the story was obvious, trite or who knows what. For me, the major plot twist came as a surprise. As such the story captivated me and the special effects were good. I am not sure whether Nicholas Cage is type cast or whether he really cannot act any differently, but in this movie he is much as he always is, for better or for worse.

Things start out with a school girl in the 1950s who is to bury a time capsule holding pictures of how the children see the future. The girl inserts just a page of numbers, and when she is prevented from finishing the page she claws them into a cupboard door instead. fast forward 50 years and the capsule is opened, and a sequence of intriguing and disturbing events follow.

The ending of the movie was perhaps a tad disturbing, but all in all this was a movie that was good enough for me to recommend to others.",1340928000,3,1202,4.172413793103448

3602577,4,B001GCUNZI,"To my surprise, I actually liked this film, although it may have been because of my low expectations, as I remembered the disaster which was ""Next"", another Nicholas Cage film on a vaguely similar theme.

In this film everything is about surprises so avoiding spoilers is really crucial. Let it be said then only, that the film begins with Jonathan Koestler, a professor of astrophysics (Nicholas Cage) getting his hands on a document which was written 50 years ago by a freaky (and probably mentally unbalanced) little girl named Lucinda Embry. The document is just a page of seemingly random numbers - however Koestler decides to consider it as a mathematic riddle and tries to solve it. And he succeeds - to his considerable annoyance...

What follows is a quite skillfull investigation thriller, with Koestler looking for more information about Lucinda Embry. But soon things get much, much more complicated and the film turns in fact into a kind of modern horror, with an atmosphere sometimes reminding of the old ""Omen"" or the more recent ""Ring"" movies. And then arrives the third part, which takes us into a direction which I for one completely didn't expect. And it gets REALLY scary at that moment! And please believe me, you will never again think of number ""33"" without a little bit of unease...

I admit that I may have liked this film a little more than it deserves, because I genuinely like to watch Nicholas Cage, even in his worst movies (of which this one is definitely not) and here he has a role in which he can actually show his talent. Rose Byrne, who plays the... well, main female part, is also excellent. There are also two younger characters, children Caleb and Abby, who gradually become more and more important for the film - the young actors Chandler Canterbury and Lara Robinson who play them give a great show and add a very emotional and dramatic touch to the plot.

So all in all, although not exactly a masterpiece, this film is a very pleasant little surprise. Mixing thriller, horror and... well, other stuff, it can offer a very satisfying ""Film on DVD"" evening. Be however warned, that like in most good ""thriller/horror/other stuff"" films, the ending can be a little upsetting. Enjoy!",1337731200,2,2222,4.793733681462141

3602579,5,B001GCUNZI,"The agnostic in me does not like the idea of predestination one bit, but as a cinematic achievement, there is no way I cannot give this movie five stars. I found it captivating and there were many parts of it that were unpredictable, even though you often ""knew"" what was coming, just like Nicolas Cage's character.

John (Cage) comes across a page of written numbers that accurately predicts catastrophic events - much like many documents in real life claim to have done ( in real life I generally think that is pretty silly). For the movie, I suspend this disbelief and just enjoy it. The one thing I think John did wrong was attempt to stop the events that had not yet occured. Even when you know where they will happen, seriously, what can you do? You don't know if it will be a madman with a bomb, an earthquake, a plane crash, or even a wayward bolt of lightning that starts a huge fire. Short of evacuating the entire area and all surrounding areas, that would be pretty difficult. If it is in fact predestination, everyone knows even evacuation won't work. By showing up, he just puts himself at risk as well.

I thought the end was a bit overdone. The effects were nice, but most of the movie was based on intellect, so it didn't quite seem to fit. At least it made everyone's fate clear, however.

One thing: Why are aliens always portrayed as a higher intelligence? (At least, when they are not portrayed as violent beings set on taking over Earth.) Just because they have the technology for space travel doesn't mean they are more intelligent than humans. Personally I think too much intelligence (technology) leads to violence. Just look at how the advancement of technology like facebook and bombs have hurt people. Although I must admit the aliens in the movie seemed pretty advanced. They wanted to give people a new chance to start over. Incidentally... weren't there more than two children chosen? There were more than two spaceships.",1332288000,5,1952,4.6686046511627906

What transpired though had me at the edge of my seat.

Nicolaus Cage stares as a widower raising his young son, whose school celebrates its fiftieth anniversary by digging up a time capsule that was buried on the eve of its opening. Inside they find pictures the children in the past drew, plus a very odd letter filled with numbers. As Cage's character studies these scrawls further, he discovers that each set of them tells of a certain disaster that is about to take place including date as well as number who die. Within minutes, he as well as the watcher begins an adventure to find out exactly what the numbers are running down to.

With over the top, but well done special effects, this movie is a wild and weird ride that begs the question of what is going to happen next. Storyline moves at a steady pace, but beside, Cage and his son, the minor characters are numerous and are almost fly by night, never giving the audience a chance to really care about them. Great twists keep the film entertaining and though not one to own, it is definitely a movie to rent, though definitely not for the young ones. Recommended for those thirteen and older, in my opinion and even then, I urge parents to watch it first.

3602653,4,B001GCUNZI,"I enjoyed this movie.
It is about earth getting burned to a crisp by solar flares.
There is mention of EE and ET.
EE stands for EveryoneElse
ET stands for ExtraTerrestrials.
The ETs communicate telepathically with certain individuals in the movie, warning them of the cataclysm that is to come .. and offering the children the chance to ride a spaceship? off the earth and away from the end time.
A page out of Ezekiel is found by Cage.  Ezekiel is one of the suppressed ? books of the Bible ... it speaks about a chariot of fire in the sky. (UFO or the burning sun ?)
The movie also mentions going underground to survive the solar flare / apocalypse.  It is a coincidence that many major governments have dug huge networks of underground tunnels?  Many say that the earthquakes in Denver and Virginia were nuclear blasts which eliminated the underground hideouts ... (someone does not want to let the elite 'get away' so to speak ...)
ok, white bunny rabbits, two children, a boy and a girl.... off in the space ship ... to reproduce and start over...
The aliens don't want Cage to come along for the ride ... the fact that he is always brandishing a pistol (aimed at the aliens) was not helping his cause....
In the end, even though Cage found his spiritual side, he feels quite distraught over the loss (physically) of his only child.
Whoa, the final heat wave reminds me of the pre-heat sequence of a nuclear blast.  Wild.
Those were really cool space ships ...
Rocks play a prominent role in the movie.
I think that the writers are trying to clue us in about the reversal of the magnetic poles of the earth, which, according to the Wiki entry for Earth's magnetic field, happens every several thousands of years ... and is recorded for all posterity ... in rocks ... Interesting.
The question left ...
Is this truly prophetic or is it disinfo spread by the cabal to encourage us to accept our elimination ?",1318982400,2,1911,4.530434782608696

3602677,2,B001GCUNZI,"Like most big budget films, the characters in this one are flat and one dimensional. Especially the children. About the only emotion is Cage's usual over the top screaming, though the leading lady gets some good screaming in as well. Other than that there were flat performances all around. There was minimal character development, and what there is did not give me a sense of emotional investment in them. If you don't have interesting characters, and you don't have a great story, what have you got?  Still, the film does have some good points. The storie is ok, nothing unusual, but one thing I liked about it is that the details were actually well thought out, a rarity in films of this nature.

Though I am not a fan of Cage (the man almost always looks like he is either on prozac or valium half the time and screaming and yelling like a badly behaved child the other half) I thought this movie might be good in spite of him.  But the truth is that this film  would not have been saved by a great actor, it may have been slightly better, but not enough to make a real difference. In fact, to be fair, Cage's performance was probobly easily the second best in the film. The effects were good but could have been better as well. In one action sequence (not giving away anything here, I don't think), there is a plane crash  which looks good but the aftermath is just rediculous. People on fire, running every which way... it just looks rediculous. Nothing like what a real plane crash looks like. The survivors almost act like video game characters. Completely unbelievable. Additionaly the flames are obviously computer generated, which just adds to the mediocrity.

But in the end it was just another disaster movie with a couple twists. Some good, and some, one in particular, entirely too cliche and utterly superflous to the story. However, I have to give the film makers credit for not going with the standard Hollywood ending. It made me feel a little less dissapointed in having sat through the entire movie

Spoiler Alert! Ok, I'm just gonna go ahead and say it. The alien ending (as well as their appearance through out)  was just trite, and cliche and did absolutely nothing to add to the movie. It was completely pointless and if anything, only served as a detractor to the film. It  made me feel kind of like I was being coddled by the producers. As if it would be just too much to see a child die in a movie, even if we don't actually see it.

3602679,2,B001GCUNZI,"This is most certainly a religious movie. Nicolas Cage plays an agnostic professor whose wife has just died. He's dealing with those feelings while trying to raise his son.

His son's class digs up a 50-year old time capsule and discovers a piece of paper covered with numbers.

These numbers predict the time and place of major catastrophes. There's one more number that predicts the destruction of the planet.

Knowing begins as an interesting thriller but then devolves into a slightly confusing, religious/sci-fi mish-mash.

I long for the days when Nicolas Cage made good movies. What happened to him and his decision to make some really bad films lately?

This film is vague enough to not give the audience black and white answers but it's clear enough that you understand what the writers were trying to say...at least in the last 15 minutes it becomes clear.

This is a movie that should have been much better than it ended up being. I'm still waiting for a decent movie with Christian themes.",1313107200,,1001,4.824561403508772
3602680,2,B001GCUNZI,"When telling a story here's a humble suggestion:  Decide where you wish the story to go.  Nothing wrong with a horror/metaphysical yarn, and there's certainly nothing wrong with a science fiction tale, but when the two are tossed together like my socks in a dryer's spin cycle the results are as convoluted and as unresolved as our current national debt.

Thus the case of KNOWING, an inevitable clunker that starts (like so many do) with some heady promise.  A piece of paper, authored by an eccentric child, buried in a time capsule for 50 years, becomes the possession of scientist/widower/heavy rye drinker John Koestler (has Nicolas Cage made anything worth a hoot lately?) and his young son, Caleb (a somber Chandler Canterbury).  The paper contains nothing but what appears to be random numbers; but upon heavy consumption of alcohol John discovers the numbers have predicted the dates and casualties of calamities that have occurred over five decades--and disasters about to occur.  Good heavens!  Accordingly it is John's task to do what he can to avert these future disasters; meanwhile Caleb is haunted by dark-cloaked figures that remind me of geek fraternity pledges during rush.  And everything moves at gale force towards a moronic ending that tries to hybrid sci-fi and metaphysics--with a pair of rabbits thrown in to make sure this howler gets the guffaw it deserves.

Granted, the movie looks and presents itself well in the beginning, and garners the necessary hook effect, plus the special effects when it comes to the disasters are spellbinding. . .yet none of this can keep KNOWING from dissolving into pure nonsense and lame pizza supreme.  No telling what I'm bound to discover when I put away some hootch and study my bank statement.

3602681,5,B001GCUNZI,"The best way to describe Knowing is like this- it's Final Destination meets War of the Worlds or 2012. That pretty much describes what to expect. It's not exactly the same but the comparisons work in both cases (but moreso with Final Destination). The only difference is that, instead of a group of teenagers being killed one by one and running around dodging death, it's just one man (the character of Nicolas Cage) and instead of aliens taking over the world, it's just the END of the world.

Back in the year 1959, a group of children were assigned to draw a picture as part of a classroom assignment that would be stored for 50 years.  The pictures were stored in what was referred to as a time capsule, buried right there on the school property. Well one of the little girls in the classroom isn't quite right. Instead of drawing pictures, she jots down several numbers in a row. The teacher is annoyed and confused because the girl didn't follow the assignment the way she was supposed to. However, the teacher never threw the assignment away and put it inside the time capsule with the other drawings anyway.

I don't want to spoil *exactly* what happens after this segment (because giving away everything is preposterous in my opinion). Anyway, 50 years later the school finally releases this time capsule by digging it out of the ground.  Each of the classmates of 2009 receive a drawing except for Nicolas Cage's son who receives the numbered paper.

He brings the paper home (even though he wasn't supposed to according to school rules) and later that night it's discovered by Nicolas Cage that each of the numbers on the paper represents an exact date when a deadly and horrific disaster was/is to occur. Since the paper was written in 1959, it correctly predicted every single event up until 2009.  The numbers would represent an exact date, the number of deaths, etc.

The tricky thing about the storyline from this point forward is that, there's still 3 more disasters to come, and two of them happen to involve Nicolas Cage himself.  Throughout the film he meets up with several different people trying not only to prevent the events from taking place, but finding out more information concerning the little girl who wrote down the numbers back in 1959.  Another element of suspense is the occasional appearance by the aliens.  They were never overused and were always kept short and sweet to effectively add to the suspense.

I thoroughly enjoyed Knowing. I thought it was an extremely entertaining edge of your seat thriller. It's true the plot switches in a new direction somewhere after the halfway point when we discover the third incident on the paper involves a MUCH bigger disaster (and the preventative measures that were necessary).

I definitely WON'T spoil how it all plays out either. If I did, well, then there'd be absolutely no point in watching Knowing at all. Just know the second half will remind you of that film 2012 with elements of War of the Worlds. Fantastic movie.",1312416000,,3006,4.759615384615385
3602682,3,B001GCUNZI,"First of all my real rating is 2.5 Now I still don't get the point of the catastrophe list. What purpose did it serve? Why was that girl chosen to write one in first place? Was that her assignment? To warn people about the disasters? well she didn't do much about it, actually she didn't do anything but to scare the hell out of her daughter. If no action was taken through out 50 years and the main event takes place in 2009 why list the disasters from the past and how they even relate to each other? Anyways ""Knowing"" is a decent film with a peculiar story that if presented properly could have worked better. I think the main problem is that it has no direction whatsoever, just questions and more chaos at each turn. Yes I know that this is the very reason we watch apocalyptic movies in first place. But sometimes bringing elements to the explanation that have not been properly presented before make for eye rolling at the end. In other words you kill the suspension of belief you build up all thought out the movie. I do have to say that unlike ""2012"" where the destruction effects were laughable and unrealistic. ""Knowing"" features some pretty scary scenarios. The plane crash alone ranks into one of the most realistically done things I ever seen. Scary stuff indeed",1311984000,,1276,4.528138528138528
3602683,4,B001GCUNZI,"After reviewing what my fellow Amazon-ers have said regarding this movie, I've decided to put my two cents in.

I liked it enough to buy it.

I welcome a movie where it pushes into thinking about the 'what-ifs' that maybe out there waiting for you, for all of us.

What struck me the most is Nick's character (MIT Professor) and his father (Pastor/Preacher) and how Koestler's sensibilites are demonstrably conflicted.  His religion is science and he has summarily dismissed his father's
teachings (and faith).  It seems to me that even though it's not harped on (remember when his sister says to him that she'll pray for him - he just says...don't! (as in don't go there)).  At the end though, he has to face it (and find a kind-of peace with his father...and maybe his heavenly father, too (that isn't made totally clear), but, in the end, he accepts his fate - he has no choice...nobody does!

That conflict is at the heart of the film - but I guess, that the religious view was minimized, folks missed it!

Regardless of anyone's view - this film is definitely something ""to think about.""

Even though it was a disaster, that was the ""best"" plane crash I've ever seen in a movie, I mean the effects in this case were outstanding...

One more thing, at the end of the movie, notice how when the ""whisper people"" as Nick's son into the movie ""morph"" into their ""true"" forms, those things on their back look strangely like ""wings""?  One could see how ancient man, upon seeing them would mistake them for...""angles"".

Is it the best movie I've ever seen?  No.

Is it the best sci-fi movie I've ever seen? No.

Can I recommend this movie?  Yes, definitely

See it for yourself - and decide!

well, that's my ""two cents""...

I give the movie Knowing...4 stars!",1311552000,8,1758,4.594855305466238
3602684,5,B001GCUNZI,"I know this film has received a large number of negative reviews but I thought this is one of the best scifi films I have seen in a long time. I won't give away the story but I found it very interesting because it merges biblical eschatological prophecy from the book of Revelation with science, mathematics to be more precise, as it plays with the mysteries of the obvious unity of fractals vs the synchronicity of  a Mandelbrot Set. The last two references are hints as to how the film is ideologically structured while bringing in biblical references to justify and bring unity to the two. I don't want to give too much away but if you are somewhat familiar with biblical mythology of end times and what we now know from science then this film may be interesting for you.  The script is tight!  The visuals awesome though a bit gratuitous in its depictions of destruction.

(Only creepy/helpful aliens can do that, and only for rare, special humans.)

There are also quite a lot of annoying goofs in the movie, many of them having to do with being filmed in Australia but supposedly set in the northeastern USA (Massachusetts and New York).

3602718,3,B001GCUNZI,"It is 1959 and students at an elementary school are asked to write letters and make their predictions for a time capsule that will be buried in front of the school and not opened for fifty years. When we arrive at 2009, we find Nicolas Cage as an astrophysics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a widower, with a young son named Caleb. Professor John Koestler drowns his marital sorrow each evening with rye or bourbon on the rocks.

Barely remembering that his son is in the ceremony for resurrecting the time capsule, he shows up to watch his son receive one of the many letters put there by the class five decades earlier. The contents of the envelope are not like the one's that other kids received. There are no pictures of rockets or flying saucers. There are only numbers, that his father pockets, only to pull out later and decipher with interest. Some of the numbers are recognizable as Koestler starts putting slash marks between them for them to make sense. Thus, 9112001 becomes 9/11/2001. The professor spends the night attempting to decipher possible dates with computer searches. The child fifty years earlier was obviously on to something. She predicted one disaster after another with a full page full of numbers, but what do the last numbers followed by two letters, EE written backwards?

His one distraction in solving the puzzle is keeping an eye on his son who has one hell of a nightmare and is visited by silent strangers several times. Soon he begins to think the numbers and the strangers have something to do with his son. He searches for some answers with a fellow professor and the daughter of the girl who wrote the numerical Book of Revelations fifty years ago. Cage is running out of time, as there are remaining numbers to figure out and events that have yet to occur.

Most of this flick had me on the edge of my seat. Nicholas Cage's acting adds to the suspense in spite of a mediocre script. One tragedy he witnesses, in particular, is literally breathtaking for its cinematography. Shortly thereafter, the theme starts to lose its edge and it eventually crashes with a thud, as it turns into a sci-fi ending that reminded me of E. T., Close Encounters, and another movie that was equally unmemorable, where an asteroid hit the earth and caused a tidal wave.

3602720,5,B001GCUNZI,"Nick Cage has had a career that has had it's ups and downs and I do not like every film he has made. Even the National Treasures series isn't my cup of tea, but I really enjoyed the film 'Next'(yes you heard me right!). 'Knowing' requires the same kind of suspension of disbelief, but is a much tighter story. My 5 star rating for such films is because I love old sci-fi films. If we look at the majority of sci-fi from the 50's to present, there are always going to be a certain amount of silliness involved. For that reason, I was able to enjoy both this film and 'Next' for what they are, fantasy sci-fi films with lots of entertainment value.

'Knowing' also has some of the most breathtaking FX of any film showing some extreme carnage with disturbing realism.

3602722,3,B001GCUNZI,"This movie reminds me of a Dean Koontz novel.  It's superlative in characterization, plot development and mood creation.  But it was terribly weak in terms of plausibility, resolution and, finally, emotional satisfaction.

I haven't been able to take Nick Cage seriously since seeing him in ""Raising Arizona.""  In my mind he'll always be the clueless yet lovable H.I. McDonough, aspiring father and incompetent desperado.  So I simply can't appreciate his attempt to play the role of a brilliant math professor.

The premise had enormous potential.  A 50 year old time capsule is opened up and inside is a complex numerical code that predicts a series of disasters, including the end of life on earth.  It finds its way into the hands of Cage's son, who, along with another child, soon experiences visits from creepy looking tow headed dudes with poor communication skills.

Cage deciphers the message and tries to prevent the disasters, but fails.  As the film climaxes he and a lady friend struggle to save themselves and the children from a massive solar flare that will microwave the globe.  But running around in the background are the aforementioned blond guys, who seem especially interested in the kids.

I won't tell how it all ends, except to say this: don't go into this movie looking for a happy ending.

What was good about it?  Several things.  The producers succeeded in creating an underlying feeling of menace that gradually builds to the climax.  If you like suspense films with lots of atmosphere you'll enjoy this.  The characters are fleshed out nicely, not stereotypical horror movie victims or geeky scientists.  The child actors perform their roles well, coming across as specially gifted without acting like smug brats.

Lastly - and this should go without saying - the special effects are excellent, and the disaster scenes are well choreographed.  I felt like I was looking at footage from a real life plane crash and subway derailment.  Nicely done.

Where the film fails is in getting me to suspend disbelief.  I simply couldn't buy major elements of the story.  Fifty years ago weird alien/ET/surfer types drive a little girl nuts with mathematical prophecies of Doomsday. Them, five decades later, they engineer the discovery of the girl's numerical prognostications by the son of a mathematics professor.  All of this is to ensure that the boy is protected from the coming events.

Ostensibly they are doing this for altruistic reasons.  But why would such benevolent and virtually omnipotent creatures not prevent the calamities they know are coming?  Why would they choose such a convoluted and troublesome way of safeguarding their ""chosen ones?""  And why can't they open their mouths without making such disgusting sounds?

The movie tries to evade these shortcomings with the old ""some things are beyond our understanding"" ploy.  The problem is that they use this to explain everything that happens in the film.  But if the events are that incomprehensible then why am I wasting my time watching them?  I could be drinking bourbon or watching reruns of ""Hogan's Heroes"" instead.

The same weakness carried over to the end, which tried to be inspiring and deeply thoughtful but was neither.  We're led along a confusing and ambiguous journey only to end up more confused than we were in the beginning.

There was a great deal of pseudo-philosophy woven into the story.  It was of the supermarket novel, Oprah Book Club variety, meant to appeal to people who thought ""The Secret"" was a profoundly meaningful book.  I was not impressed.

All in all, this wasn't the worst way to spend two hours or so.  But don't pay more than a buck or two.",1295827200,2,3675,4.970443349753695
3602723,3,B001GCUNZI,"1950s Lucinda Embry (Lara Robinson) is a psychic with a gift for prophecy.  She inserts her prediction in a time capsule that is opened in modern times by MIT astrophysics professor named John Koestler (Nicholas Cage). Koestler's wife died, sapping him of his faith, and he and his son Caleb (Chandler Canterbury) are adrift without her moral center. Not really believing in anything, Koestler recognizes a pattern in Embry's numbers that presages tragic events. Embroiled in this conspiracy theory is Embry's daughter Diana Wayland (Rose Byrne) and granddaughter Abby (Lara Robinson, playing both parts). It's not long before Abby and Caleb become friends due to their common bond with the Whispering People, SPOILER: AKA the Nordics.

Popular media has mapped out the stars pretty thoroughly in the past few decades since Close Encounters of the Third Kind debuted. Everybody knows about Grays: short, spindly, with big heads, big eyes, and little else.  The reptilians are less well-known but still well-established thanks to the television series ""V"".  But Nordics are virtually unheard of in Hollywood, if only because their blonde hair, blue eyes, and white skin, seem like a particularly WASPY variant of alien life. Knowing aims to correct that.

Knowing, like Signs, tries to transform a world-spanning event into a deeply personal one with partial success.  Knowing takes the same premise - that something terrible is about to happen and only one person (Nicolas Cage as John Koestler) is smart enough to do something about it.  What Knowing does right is reinforce its premonitions of doom with terrifying personal tragedies like a plane crash. Indeed, that single scene is a horrifying centerpiece that dwarfs the actual Armageddon threatened by Koestler's discovery.

The blessing and curse of Knowing is its inherent selfishness in building an entire plot around one person's interpretation of world-spanning events. It teeters between the leap of faith necessary to believe in prophecy and the objective truths of disaster - the date of a crash, the number of deaths, the GPS coordinates.  All of these numbers are disputable, but Knowing takes them as Gospel.

Once Knowing commits to a narrative framework - aliens or angels, science or faith, the movie either reinforces your world view or utterly contradicts it.

3602725,3,B001GCUNZI,"KNOWING will find an audience, whether that audience is the science fiction aficionados, the spiritualists, those waiting for 2012 ideas, or those who enjoy thrillers.  It is a mixed bag - based on a story by Ryne Douglas Pearson who adapted it for the screen with Juliet Snowden and Stiles White - that depends heavily on the audience's perception of Nicholas Cage: after a string of films that cast him as a mad man it is nice to see him in a humanistic role. Alex Proyas directs.

50 years ago a school closed and the new school that opened to replace it called for a ceremony that included the burying of a time capsule full of children's drawings about what they felt the future would hold in 50 years.  At the ceremony the enveloped drawings are dispersed among the class and Caleb Koestler (Chandler Canterbury) opens an envelope that is simply a page of numbers: Caleb begins to hear voices, but is reassured by his widowed astrophysicist father John Koestler (Nicholas Cage) that it is probably due to Caleb's hearing aide.  But as John examines the list of numbers with his fellow associate Ben  (Phil Mendelsohn) he begins to discover that the numbers are not random but are instead dates of horrible accidents or events followed by the number of lives lost in that event: the obvious number sequence is 9/11.  John follows events that are predicted and finally discovers that an event listed as the last number set is predicting the end of the world.  The little girl who made the original list lived a strange life and in her lineage is an adult  (Rose Byrne) who has a daughter Abby (Laura Robinson) who is Caleb's best friend and also hears the voices Caleb hears. Together the two families explore the ramifications of the numbers and the film speedily progresses to a fantasy ending.

The story itself is interesting and the acting is fine - up to the point that the inevitable CGI effects take over.  Then it becomes a matter of taste as to whether the viewer needs to have details splashed all over the screen or merely keep the story in the imagination of the viewers' minds.  As Hollywood so often forgets, sometimes less is more, and in this case what could have been a rather tender film becomes another loud apocalyptic disaster sequence.

3602746,1,B001GCUNZI,"First, I very very very rarely write a review BUT I just watched this movie on cable (thank heaven I didn't buy it or rent it) and had to put in my two cents. What a promising plot, what a great cast, and what absolutely poor directing. Even I could have done a better job. I know Nicholas Cage can act so I HAVE to blame it on the director. He was either flat or loggy or just plain unbelievable for even the simplest scenes. Even his drunken scenes felt faked. And please... work with the kids for scenes where they have to cry... I lose the moment when they make me laugh because its so bad. I was pretty hopeful since I love sci-fi and will let alot slide... but like I said, the plot was a good story, too bad the director couldn't guide the actors to pull it off. Give it a look if nothing else is available and you'll see what I mean. (The mom - forgot her name - at the end was sooo bad and acted sooo unbelievable, I was thrilled we had finally reached the end of the movie.)",1292198400,,984,4.025510204081633
3602747,4,B001GCUNZI,"Knowing stars Nicolas Cage. It was a wonderfully suspenseful movie, and Keisha was sure she was going to have to wake me up to go downstairs with her the next morning when she got up for work. The movie presented a very interesting plot: 50 years ago a school fills and seals a time capsule. One of the students hears whispers and writes this mysterious sheet of paper filled with random numbers. When the capsule is opened, Nic Cage's son gets this sheet of paper and starts to hear whispers and see these strange people. Cage, a brilliant astro-physicist at MIT, works out the numbers to dates and locations of disasters, along with how many people will die. He sets out to stop and rescue people, also trying to figure out the mysterious last sequence.

Up through this point I enjoyed the movie, despite myself. I was expecting something lame with some explosions, but instead I received an intriguing storyline with characters I enjoyed. There were some cool graphics, and there were some suspenseful scenes.

Then everything went out the window. The movie went from being pretty good to absolutely ridiculous. Keisha said to forget about waking me up. Thriller and Suspense were discarded for something a bit more deus ex machina. And that was it. The end. It turned out it was complete lamesauce, like my initial thinking.

And more than this, what is up with Hollywood's love affair of the end of the world? Its seems to be a very common theme these days. Perhaps they sense that their civilization is coming to an end when this is the quality of art it produces?

3602753,3,B001GCUNZI,"I watched the new Nicolas Cage apocalypse movie Knowing (2009) last night.  I've never been much of a Nicolas Cage fan...I don't think I own any of his movies.  But there are a few of his films that I like.  I did enjoy the two National Treasure movies, even if they were sort of cheap Chinese-made knock-offs of Indiana Jones.  And Knowing could have been a great movie...it just wasn't.  But it was ""entertaining"" on some level.  I actually really liked the first and second acts of the film (as I learned in Cinema History class, all movies have a basic 3-act story structure).  The mystery and thriller tension are great.  And the pace of the editing is nearly perfect since I was intrigued by the story.  It's the ending that failed to deliver on the promise of the beginning.  Stargate (1994) with Kurt Russell and James Spader is another movie that has an incredible beginning but just fails at the end in my opinion.  I remember seeing Stargate at a special free preview screening that I won tickets to while in college.  Upon viewing Stargate a few more times over the years, it's grown on me more and more.  So maybe Knowing will be a movie like that.

From a filmmaking point of view, the most fascinating aspect of Knowing is that it was made with the Red Digital Cinema Camera, which is a relatively new American made digital movie camera system that is taking the film industry by storm.  It was initially developed as a prototype in 2006.  I just learned about it from my classmate Tarek who is enthralled with the camera.  This is the first movie I've seen made with the Red camera and I can't really tell the difference on my 40' HDTV from movies made on 35mm film.  Of course ALL movies are digitally edited today...so while they may be filmed on actual film, they get scanned and then edited digitally and then put back on film to be sent to most movie theaters for projection...kind of an archaic system, huh?  But until the Red Camera, digital cameras just haven't had the look and feel of film.  So it is with this new system that I think the digital revolution will finally come to Hollywood movies.

The Red Camera is really an ""indie"" camera system that was developed by the founder of Oakley, billionaire Jim Jannard...you know, the sunglass company.  Check out a great blog about the Red One camera on Wired Magazine's website: Analog Meets Its Match in Red Digital Cinema's Ultrahigh-Res Camera.  What I love about the Red Camera is that it costs about $20,000...a cost that is going to make movies much more affordable.  Of course technology is only one aspect of a great movie.  In the end, the story...and its execution by all of the people involved in making the film (director, actors, producers, etc.)...is what makes a movie great...NOT the camera!  But if more of us storytellers can tell our stories, the more possibilities for great movies.",1286323200,2,2878,4.616141732283465

This sheet of numbers falls into the hands of a scientist who discovers that they predict various disasters. This is the second time over the past two years that I have seen this film, but this was the first time that I had seen it on blu-ray, and this really is the way to see this film. It's a beautifully directed apocalyptic sci-fi film that looks and sounds amazing (DTS HD Master Audio;5.1 Dolby Digital). There was one scene of a forest fire that was so vivid with the crackling sounds of fire that I felt I was right in the middle of a forest fire.

Chandler Caterbury was incredibly engaging in the role of Caleb Koestler, and again was perfect for his role! In regards to the overall plot, can you say ""Nostradamus?""

The people who wrote the screenplay seem to have made the mistaken assumption that the average moviegoer is also well-read and educated.  This, sadly, is not the case.  The plot line of Knowing is rooted in some rather obscure and/or less-than-mainstream ideas.  These include Chaos theory, the ideas of Von Daniken, ancient astronaut theory, astrophysics, and certain alternative facets of spirtuality.

If you are the type who likes a movie that makes you think and question then this will be perfect for you.  And if you like it then spread the word to your more intelligent friends!

This occurs despite the fact that the space aliens do not bother to speak a word to anybody and throughout the first part of the movie scare the wits out of all parties by their creepy behavior including ""whispering"" to various humans who are then misunderstood by the unknowing medical profession as having hallucinations and institutionalized. Cage's Father accepts the premise that he cannot go to the new home because he is not one of the ""Chosen."" The apocalypse threatening the earth is...wait for it... THE LOSS OF THE OZONE LAYER! This causes the earth's crust to explode because of the Overheating which takes place in a matter of minutes.

3602810,2,B001GCUNZI,"Movies can be entertainment.  Movies can be thought-provoking.  KNOWING tries to do both, but accomplishes neither.  I was expecting a thriller, but when I googled the movie halfway while watching this, I came across the words ""science-fiction thriller"" which made me think: bad news.

Bad news because the movie is intrinsically a human story, but the introduction of sci-fi aka unexplained Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind elements confuse the conflict.  KNOWING is about Nicholas Cage stumbling across the greatest secret the world has ever known - a Nostradamus like prophecy which subsequently turns out to be a neither fish nor fowl.  It's hard to rate for that.  The acting works on Cage's part, as does the premise, but the execution at the end is so dissatisfying that you're better off reading the Bible than watching this.

Unfortunately, the nice special effects only make this film appear indulgent than meaningful.  Director Proyas simply isn't deep enough to make a real statement, and he shouldn't try.  This reminded me of an M. Night Shyamalan film...cryptic at the beginning and no wiser at the end.  Another similarly epic / introspective belly button film was The Fountain by Darren Aronofsky.

So give this a miss...and watch a rerun of Rod Serling's Twilight Zone instead for offbeat cryptic storylines that succeed.  Or go watch Armageddon...(or any end of the world films) which will essentially give you the same buzz with an ending.  The filmmakers should be applauded for trying to make a different kind of film, but like Danny Boyle's Sunshine - KNOWING just doesn't work.",1281484800,2,1601,5.061068702290076

Cage plays the part of an atheist MIT physics professor who believes the events of the universe are simply random accidents. But as all anti-atheist movies goes he discovers god at the end of the movie. This film tries to duplicate the emotional scenes in 'Taken' where the parents of the child being taken by god like aliens (who are wiping all life from the planet to start over with new life on another planet which is enviromentally pure.) Cage grapples with the aliens begging them not to take his son who also begs to stay with his dad (sound familiar?) After his son is taken the professor is found next morning still upset and  lying in the spot where his son was taken (another hammed up scene from Taken). He then meets with his father and girlfriend where they all rejoice to the realization they will meet again in heaven.

I agree with many of the previous posters who pointed out that the whole numbers thing, while interesting as a plot device, was totally pointless. That information didn't empower anybody to do anything. It wasn't even needed to get the kids to the location at the end (the aliens took care of that). A major plot thread that goes nowhere is a bad sign. BTW, it's possible to view this in a totally non-religious context. Yes, Cage sort of get's the spirit and reluctantly reconciles with his dad, but even though an afterlife is alluded to in those emotional moments, there is never a shred of evidence thrust upon the viewer (thankfully, as far as I'm concerned).",1276646400,2,1004,4.646067415730337

3602857,1,B001GCUNZI,"Warning: Spoiler.

I love Nicholas Cage and own most of his movies, but this movie is pointless.  The whole story leads up to the world being destroyed.  If there is a point, it is that there is nothing anyone can do about it.  Since movies (and stories) are about characters effecting change, this movie has none.  It does not even qualify as a tragedy.  If you really hate someone and want to depress them, recommend this movie.

What makes is sadder, is that the acting is not bad.  The special effects are pretty good.  The science and storyline do not make a lot of sense.

What gives these aliens the power to tell the future to such great accuracy?  Predicting a star's life-cycle, perhaps, but all the details down to a specific person born, raised, being a physicist, having a GPS and driving by an airport at a specific time, nope.  Can't see it.  Time travelling, maybe, but that is never shown, so clearly the writers are saying prediction.

What is the point in leaving a prediction?  So a dad will let these all powerful, all knowing aliens take his child?  Not seeing it.  Were there hundreds of other time capsules and theoretical physicists having written similar papers giving up their children around the planet?  There was a whole fleet carrying kids away to this other planet.  Did none of the other kids need a parent to let them go?

Why do they want just little kids?  Did human evolution simultaneously reach a pinnacle in a single year?  Or are adults already considered mentally polluted?  The kids are old enough to have watched television, learned history.  Why not take babies (for example: Ember)?  But then who would take care of them?  So what is the purpose?  It is never explained.

Why are these special children hearing and being picked up at a time that coincides with a cosmic stellar event?  Are the aliens just grabbing whoever is acceptable?  Or did they cause the stellar flareup?

Some reviewers have said this is a depiction of Scientology.  I am not familiar with the religion.  The movie might make sense to someone who had adopted a view of the world based on faith in god-like aliens who choose ""special"" children for a ""heaven"" planet for their own mysterious reasons and ""hear"" their call.

This under-rated sci-fi drama from 2009 is a good example.  Heading a cast of mostly nobodies, Cage plays a widowed scientist whose son comes into the possession of knowledge of the future, including the end of the world.

The basics earn this movie its stars, including the character development, special effects and cinematography. But the bizarre plot earns it five stars. It exhibits qualities of several different film genera, including horror, suspense and sci-fi. It is a very interesting mix and makes for an equally interesting movie.
What stood out to me throughout the film, however, was the thick religious tone. The movie began so innocently (excluding the possessed girl) with the elementary students singing ""This Little Light of Mine."" As religious aspects make up the climax, I will not elaborate further. I don't like spoiling surprises. But ""Knowing"" includes a very deep and twisted religious tone that will haunt you in your nightmares for the next week.

3602864,5,B001GCUNZI,"This has to be the best movie I've seen in a very long time!  I was dumbfounded to try to understand why so many people knocked it.  The movie constantly had me thinking that it was entertaining me and how much I was liking it, it seems I kept thinking in the back of my head that it was supposed to have some bad parts which made so many give it lower ratings. But instead, I kept thinking what a great movie it was.  This movie has gotten way too many bad raps so I had to take time out to tell others to watch it and by all means don't miss out. I never expected such a smoothe running film, it was very realistic.  At first when these strange people were lurking around the kids I thought they were some psychics coming to warn the kids and that they were supposed to be the ones with the so called ""knowing,"" but the writer keeps you guessing about them, right up until you get filled in with the actual explanation.  And I loved that I didn't know what that was all about, not until it was time to know it.  The flow of the movie is excellent!  Its a series of events that any sane intelligent person would react to exactly as Nickolas Cage did, the acting was superb, it actually revived my faith in him as an actor, which sadly I had been losing totally.  He managed to get himself into a great flick this time!  I just wish there was a better way to find out when an excellent movie like this is out there to see, no one told me, so I'm here now to tell you, if you believe me, to go have a good time watching something very entertaining.  Near the end of the movie I thought the mother was doing the wrong thing, regardless of whether she had any right to do what she was doing, it was realistic, it doesn't matter if its what ""you"" would do in that situation, it was what she did and in real life people often do things ""we"" ourselves would have done differently, so its not a flaw in the movie its just realism.  But when you see what happens due to her choice, ""then"" suddenly you realize how perfect it is to the movie, how it proved whe her own mother had told her, awesome!  Well thought out by the writer, my hat is lifted way up there in highest regards, I'm impressed!  Also, I love when a movie has something extreme in it, its what makes you get your money's worth.  This flick impressed me in other ways too, instead of just showing things as people expect them to be, it made its own unique stamp on fresh new ground, making itself an original idea.  Which is why when the movie ended I was so surprised that it was so unexpected, each scene bursting with unique originality.  Then another scene, and another, finally it really was over and I was astounded, saying out loud; what a great movie!!  Last night I had told a friend I was going home to watch a new movie, this morning I had to call that person to say, it was the best movie I've seen in a long long time. I said it was one of the best movies I'd ever seen.  There were some powerful scenes, boy did I get my money's worth, I can't stop emphasizing that.  Some of the things I've said here would make more sense to you if I gave examples from exact scenes in the movie, but that ruins it, a review isn't supposed to be for telling everything that happens in a movie.  And it isn't supposed to spoil the movie for you before you get to see it. Now then, go watch the movie, see if you love being entertained.",1269561600,,3391,4.116843702579666
3602865,1,B001GCUNZI,"I was honestly very hopeful that when I bought Knowing (after waiting for the price to drop) that it might be a movie I could watch more than once and enjoy. Not even close. Not because it had that 6th Sense kind of quality where once you know the ending you can't really get into it. This simply was a blandly written and poorly directed movie where Nicholas Cage was not at his best. In fact, his timing and mechanics were way off and it looked as if the director was afraid to direct him. Cage's character never really becomes anyone worth relating to. No flashbacks, boring or absent dialog, no personality, no supporting characters with any character, even his son is as boring as dirt. The best actors were the ones in the beginning before the marque actors showed up. You can blame the writers for the poor character development but also Cage looked as if he mailed it in, which for him is still pretty passable, but Cage could only handle the basics and many of his motions looked telegraphed. That took us out of the movie a few times but was forgivable. What was really poor were the missed opportunities this movie presented coupled with the far reaching stupidity of the overall plot once you knew where it was going. I even held out hope for a long time that it wouldn't go where I worried it was going but at every turn it continued to go straight ahead into oblivion. It didn't help that everything up to the ending was completely superfluous to the ending.

PLOT WARNING: The beginning started out promising. We had children making letter & pictures for a school time capsule but one child seems disturbed and makes a list of numbers. All the pictures are placed in the capsule. Fifty years later in the present the time capsule is open and each student get's one letter. Cage's son gets the letter with the strange list of numbers. After some boring dialog and a very sloppy and poorly choreographed spill of Cage's drink on the letter, Cage becomes interested in the list of numbers. He quickly deduces their meaning despite having hint and no clear epiphany moment. He never brings us on the journey of his mind.....he simply figures it out. It's a list of tragedies that have all come true except the few remaining numbers set for the next few days. Better directing, a few more scenes and deeper dialog could have made this part of the film a great addition to the movie. MISSED! They could have made the discovery enjoyable but they seemed too hurried to present what came next, which unfortunately was NOTHING! Sure, there are plane crashes and mysterious visitors but the director found every way possible to strain any suspense out of all of it, mostly by never building the characters or adding the necessary dialog to connect them or make them interesting. The same held true for the plot where we had a lot of intriguing events that were never logically threaded together. It was beginning to look like another Wicker Man as you finally realize that the ending was going to make the journey a waste. And it was a waste. Cage goes off following the path of destruction but ultimately stopping nothing and saving no one during what should have been a series of very suspenseful events. The director missed a ton of opportunities to make this a real thriller but at the end of this tail-chasing exercise, Cage discovers that these predictions can't be stopped and that no one can be saved, at least not by him or any other person. Then, these silly stones appear which turn out to mean nothing. The alien visitors show up at times, presumably to take the children, and they could but never do and instead haunt them with voices and visions and possession. The movie goes on and the predictions come true and the last one predicts the end of the world. Another unexplainable epiphany leads Cage to discover the cause of this world ending event which is a massive solar flare that will incinerate the Earth. No stopping that, so we realize the world is going to end. For some unknown reason Cage knows that the government will tell everyone and for some stupid reason the government does. Then the movie really goes flat as Cage again chases his tail and has another unexplained epiphany sending him to find some missing numbers that return him to a location where the visitors would leave from. The writers then unnecessarily kill off the one supporting actress that was building any kind of character. Cage watches her die then catches up to the visitors using the newly discovered numbers. The kids who originally wrote the numbers never needed them since the visitors were simply going up to the kids wherever they were, and the kids did not know what the numbers meant anyways. The numbers didn't help Cage since everything still came true and Cage was not allowed to go on the spaceship since he was not called by these very selective visitors. Cage arrives in time to say goodbye to his son and watch the aliens take his kid along with his now dead friend's kid to a new world with a bunch of other kids and animals in ships in a Noah's Ark type of event. A not-so-tearful goodbye with his son since the heartless aliens won't take Cage, and then they are off. Cage returns home to his estranged family who are estranged for no reason. The predictions served absolutely no purpose in the movie since the kids did not know of them and the predictions did not lead to anything positive. The visitors take the kids and the reason for the predictions? They simply come true. Cage's son actually has to say the prediction were meant to prepare them in some way just to give these useless predictions meaning to the movie goer which of course, if you have to say it then they did not. Why are the last three tragedies centered around Cage's character anyways when there were ships leaving from all over the Earth supposedly with other kids? The predictions from the aliens are meant to be intriguing but again have no affect on the outcome. In the end Cage's son goes off to a new world where they have tall grass and a big tree of life in the center which I guess was meant to give us an Adam and Eve feel. The Earth is then engulfed by a solar flare with some nice effects that came way too late.

I could have given this movie two stars but this movie should have been a 4 or 5 so they are losing a star for screwing up a free lunch. They had opportunity all over the place. Let Cage save the world! Let him struggle a little more to figure things out, then let it mean something. Make the death toll numbers a little off to account for human error vs alien exactness. Make the predictions important to the outcome and when Cage figure's it out let him make SOME difference. Let Cage take over an alien ship. Anything but a list of unchangeable predictions provided by a group of antisocial aliens for absolutely no reason except there is a movie audience. I'd settle for slapping Cage's agent for going from Adaptation to Weather Man to Wicker Man to Ghost Rider to this. There is a disturbing trend to Cage's selections as he has gone from stretching himself with fringe and unpopular roles with descent actors like Adaptation and The Weather Man to unfinished plots with unsatisfying endings. Now I need to find another movie to satisfy my Sci-fi fix and Cage is left to fix his finances and career, and decide if he wants to make a movie worth watching ever again.

UPDATE: I gave this movie away last year. Never missed it. After reading these reviews, I am tempted to watch it again with a morbid 10-car-pile-up kind of intrigue, but when I flash back to some of the scenes I quickly remember why I gave it away. Thank God it's not in my collection. Watching this film again would lead me to bleed from my eye sockets. As I read the phoney 5-star reviews I recognize there is a real effort to maintain the ratings by publicists but if you can avoid the pain of watching this despite the Sci-fi label and the lack of any good Sci-fi out there, then you will not have the horrific memories of this movie I have. Can I sue the director for pain & suffering? I'd sue Cage but he has money issues. Watch this mess at your own risk.",1268438400,2,8159,4.507765023632681

1 Disc Widescreen Edition (2009)Knowing poster

Oh boy. Nicholas Cage. *Cracks knuckles* Let's get down to business.

Knowing was directed by Alex Proyas who has brought us such gems in the past as I, Robot and The Crow so he knows how to tell a mystery story. I thought he did a ok job bringing the movie together, but both the plot and lead actor had some flaws.

The story follows Nicholas Cage's son gets a piece of paper out of a time capsule that has a series of numbers covering the whole thing. By coincidence, Cage notices a few numbers match up with a date and number of casualties of a news worthy tragedy. Soon he is dissecting the whole sheet like a mad man and looking up every other sequence to match it with another tragic event where lives are lost. It absolutely kills me that he is supposed to be an astronomer/professor/numbers guru and takes sooooo long to consider that the section of numbers at the end of each sequence could be coordinates to the location of the disaster. Why isn't that his first guess? I thought he was supposed to be genius level. It's already hard to get past that surfer dude accent so please don't dumb this down for the audience, we're all way ahead of you.

This movie is hard to watch only because of Nicholas Cage. There are some movies I have enjoyed him in (City of Angels oddly enough and sometimes Ghost Rider), but all in all he is always playing the same guy with the same surfer voice! The supporting actors don't and probably can't make up for this because they aren't given much to work with. They are solely there for Cage to talk to and think out loud around because he's in almost every scene.

If you can ignore him, this movie is worth watching for a very small handful of sequences. Get past the boring stuff and watch for a plane crashing beside a highway and people running out of it engulfed in flames! Amazing, terrifying, heart-breaking, and exhilarating all at the same time. There are creepy no-face men stalking Cage's son and handing out black stones and they give a couple good scares. Anytime there is a special effects destruction scene, it makes it worth sitting through the rest because they look amazing and we all love some good old-fashioned explosions and destruction, don't we?

I expected this movie to end the way a lot of these destruction movies do but I was pleasantly surprised to see them stay the course and not make up a deux ex machina at the end. I respect that. The plot I blow a raspberry at. The visual effects made me sit up and take notice. I could've cut this movie down to 20 minutes tops to see the good parts.

Disc Extras:

For such a big disaster movie idea and special effects, you'd think the audio commentary with the director would be interested but honestly it was so boring that about two-thirds though I turned it off. He's a dry, boring speaker and the other person with him has to keep prompting him for general information about the film people might be interested in. There's a making-of feature that talks about how these actors came to be cast in this film and how the little girl plays two parts. The most interesting part of that feature is showing how the airplane crash sequence was shot. For all you fanatics into doomsday predictions, there's a feature called ""Visions of the Apocalypse"" that goes over how accurate the information portrayed in the film is to actual events in time and how ancient people over time viewed the coming of the end of the world and is probably the most interesting extra on the dvd for history buffs.",1267401600,,3574,4.50462962962963
3602928,4,B001GCUNZI,"I've only just got around to seeing this film/movie (March 2010). A competent film of its type. The CGI was not too cardboard and generally realistic. This story is not an uplifting one but then it could never be. I haven't read all the reviews - too many - so someone else might have picked up the flavour of Childhood's End by Arthur C Clarke. I read it years ago so I can't remember if there was the prediction element, but I certainly remember being very depressed by it for some time. But, hey, if we expected every film/story to be jolly, we'd all be deserving of deletion from the planet.

3602929,2,B001GCUNZI,"I loved it...but it was much t-o-o long.  It could have been a 60-minute special on cable.  The special effects (particularly the plane crash on the highway) were spectacular, but the in-between scenes were l-o-n-g and boring.  Nicolas Cage has been much better in his previous films...this one he shows how lethargic he can be...almost like he wasn't too thrilled to star in this lazy sci-fi sleeper.  Don't get me wrong, it had its moments...but it seemed to rob and steal from other flicks...like ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"".  I'm not sure why the children had little rabbits when they were escorted to a new planet...but the ending just didn't seem to fit the drum roll I was expecting.  This film was all over the place.  It is worth a rental, but not a buy.  Nicolas can do much better than this.  Granted, he's not the heart-throb of ""Moonstruck"" anymore, but he needs to be cast in quality films.  This one was poorly scripted and edited.  I hate to see actors lower themselves to this level after so many years of success.",1267315200,,1040,4.628415300546448
3602930,4,B001GCUNZI,"This is the first review I have ever posted to Amazon and I am writing this because I felt compelled to dispute the reactionary opinions I read about this film.  I want to address really briefly the four main problems people have with this film: the subpar acting, the CGI, its supposed multiple personality disorder, and the themes of the film.

First of all, yes, Nick Cage is the star of this film.  Yes he has done many, many horrible films recently and because of that many people have written him off as an actor and have a tendency to be predisposed to hating whatever he does next.  I also had my doubts going into this film, but I'm a fan of Proyas so I gave it a shot.  I felt that Cage's understated performance was surprisingly believable and perfect for the tone of the film.  Obviously films like Adaptation etc. have shown us that Cage can, in fact, act so lets try to be reasonable and not write off an entire production because of one person's past mistakes.  Also his hair is pretty normal here, which is a huge plus.

Many people have also made flippant remarks about the CGI effects in this film.  I've watched these scenes with the purpose of picking this element apart and found nothing.  The CGI is TOP NOTCH!!  These epic set pieces are beautifully staged and shot, I seriously cannot believe that these people have watched the same film as I have and I too can't stand it when CGI is haphazardly thrown together.

I agree that there is a lot packed into this storyline, a story line that is equal parts horror, drama, sci-fi, and apocalyptic. I've got to say that there are plenty of movies that have attempted this sort of hybrid before and failed miserably, but this is not one of them.  Every 'personality' this film evokes blends seamlessly together, complimenting each other, and each has a purpose in telling this epic story.  Never did I feel like something was out of place or laughably inserted just to please the director's indulgences.  Yes there are outlandish and ""unbelievable"" elements to this story, but this is a story about finding a greater meaning in life, about events that are part of a bigger picture working together harmoniously for a greater purpose.  This is about finding faith...so understandably those without faith will find it hard to stomach.

This brings me to the themes of the films, which will be a little touchy for people so try to have an open mind.  We live in a world that praises the individual, that promotes that power of self, and our ability to control our destiny.  A film that so blatantly shows a man's journey from a dark place where he believes everything is random and there is no meaning or purpose to life, to a new perspective where he is part of a predetermined destiny (releases control) and embraces faith, would cause today's ""individual"" to become uncomfortable and react as if he is being boxed in or preached at.  While this film mirrors certain religious themes, it certainly is not ""preachy"" (in fact from the commentary alone Proyas practically refuses to paint it in a religious light), and it leaves much to be interpreted by the audience.  I think this is a bold move, which I respect and admire, which treats the audience with respect, but it is a move that has sadly proven to be dangerous in the age of the individual.  Remember, the more we reject bold films like this, the less studios will be willing to pay for them, leaving us with more 2012s.

As for the blu-ray disc, well its no surprise that a film so universally maligned would get a rather bare-bones release (hence four stars), but there are some bright spots.  Besides the fact that you will be able own what could quite possibly become the next cult film ala 'Dark City', the video is pristine!  Shot with the latest Red Camera digital technology it was made to take full advantage of the blu-ray format.  Other than that, obviously, Proyas' commentary is definitely one of the more interesting I've heard.  If you still haven't seen this because of all the negative propaganda give it a shot.  If you like it, fight the power, and give it a second life on blu-ray!",1267142400,,4126,4.592087312414734
3602931,2,B001GCUNZI,"""Knowing"" rides the trend of disaster films.  But unlike 2012, its lead is an astrophysicist (a real smart guy) and a single father rather than a novelist and a single father (but a real nice guy).  I give credit to the trailer.  It's well done and played with my curiosity.  So, okay I bought.  I gave Knowing the benefit of doubt.

Nicolas Cage is an astrophysicist and an apparent numerologist.  Nick performs fusion on the two sciences and discovers an incoherent scratch paper done for homework 50 years ago by a troubled child holds the secrets of the future.  Then the story turns from cliche to outright odd.  Black pebbles, visions of inflammable wildlife, and senile old women, confuse and bedazzle Cage as he struggles to find anyone to listen to him before something ""big"" happens.

The best part of the film is its premise and how Cage gets caught up in it.  Its interesting to see how the story comes to a character rather than the other way around.  There are two impressive disaster scenes.  One is visually stunning while the other is Final Destination times ten.

Cliches: The character that is most anti-social and least comfortable with has all the answers for society.  The lead can't interact with a family member and has a near debilitating personality problems.  Reaching for a revolver out of nowhere while the character has already convinced us he's not the type to know how to use one.

The finale is what is controversial.  Not just what but how.  Some argue the symbolism while others its entertainment value.  Its good enough to trick you into thinking its a thought-provoking sci-fi film.  Don't take my advise, look up the 100 things you can learn from ""knowing"" on another site known for its internet movie database.

3602933,3,B001GCUNZI,"The primary reason I gave this good movie only three stars (and thus agreed with the average Amazon reviewer) was the ""so, so"" writing and animation work at the weak ending. While the film director was following a very good idea for a storyline, this plot was so good that it raised my expectations to levels that could never have been satisfied by almost any mass produced CGI ending! I think Hollywood is getting very good at animating the end of the world. It just needed a little more care at the content of the ending and I can't believe that writers this clever can't deliver one which lives up to the great plot. It would appear that this is a very common problem with good sci-fi films, that is endings that don't live up to the build up! That is what separates good sci-fi films from really great ones.

I was riveted.  The story is suspenseful, thrilling, inspirational, unsettling, morbid and hopeful all at once.  I watched it again with my wife and she brought out several points I had not seen.  It deserves repeated viewings.

3602956,2,B001GCUNZI,"*PLOT SPOILERS*

In 1959, a grade-school Nostradamus puts a piece of paper containing seemingly random numbers into a time capsule.  When the container is opened fifty years later, it turns out that the numbers were not random at all but rather numerical predictions of future disasters, pinpointing the dates they were to occur and the number of people who would lose their lives in them.  Enter John Koestler, a professor of astrophysics at MIT, who decodes the messages and becomes convinced that if he can just get others to heed the warnings, he'll somehow be able to avert the catastrophes.  Unfortunately, John soon discovers that these piddling little disasters are mere warm-up exercises for the Big Cataclysmic Kahuna that is to come...

In ""Knowing,"" the cliches of plot and character come fast and furious.  John is a single dad who turns to atheism after his wife dies in a hotel fire, convinced that nothing happens for a reason and that life is nothing more than a series of random events, blah, blah, blah.  As usual, the atheist - an egg headed scientist, naturally - has to be shown that there is indeed a higher power somewhere controlling our destinies.  I guess we're just supposed to accept that fact and not question the appalling nature of that being's actions as he proceeds to wipe out an entire planet (the movie manages to combine elements of the Adam-and-Eve and Noah`s Ark tales into a single story).

In the tradition of ""Armageddon,"" ""The Core,"" ""2012,"" etc., ""Knowing"" is an apocalyptic chiller that reduces the destruction of all life on the planet to the level of a cheap carnival thrill ride.  Nicholas Cage - who is stuck in yet another of those Droopy Dog save-the-world roles that have become all too prevalent in his career of late - does what he can with a script that starts off with a reasonably intriguing premise, then fritters it away on giggle-inducing hysterical-crowd scenes and a dopey subplot involving extraterrestrials that should have Steven Spielberg suing the makers for copyright-infringement.  And the be-fruitful-and-multiply ending is as queasy as it is implausible.

There are additional wooden performances by other members of the cast, but the kindest thing would be to let them remain nameless and to forget that any of them were ever even in this picture.",1263513600,,2320,4.93573264781491

 I even didn't hate it until the last half hour - forty five minutes.

  But it passed by all the possibilities for intrigue, for really unique things happening, and then jumped completely to (SPOILER ALERT) ALIENS.  In the last fifteen minutes.

  it's yet another end of the world, we're all going to die, movie, with very little to recommend it.  The interesting parts or the potential for itneresting things are bypassed and ignored, or not developed enough.

Granted, the ""end of the world"" plot has been done to death, but this was a unique spin. With great characterization and riveting action sequences, this film had it all in the can.

Up until the end, when it suddenly turns into a Snuggle commercial.

What was unutterably galling was the in-your-face message that ""Knowing"" imparts. The gentle, wise aliens arrive, but only to save the cutely precocious but oh-so-annoying children. Yup. Lest you doubt that we live a child-centric nation that reveres all things small and darling (who are cuddling bunnies) and worships youth over maturity and wisdom, ""Knowing"" will hammer that home. If you dream of beautiful planets inhabited by attractive Caucasian children running through fields of gold, you'll find ""Knowing"" divine. Heck, just fast-forward so you can see the happy-ever-after. The last 30 seconds are the entire movie in a nutshell.

Sad thing is, it could have been so much better had the powers that be had the courage to step outside of the box and give it a real ending--even if it were far more brutal.",1262908800,,1218,4.96078431372549
3602959,4,B001GCUNZI,"Nicholas Cage stars in one of his better films as a widowed father who is raising a son (Kaleb).  On the 50th anniversary of a time capule at Kaleb's school, the time capsule is to be opened.  The audience got to see the time capsule being created in 1959 where the students were asked to draw pictures of what they thought the world would be like in 50 years.

One of the girls just put a series of what appeared to be random numbers.  This girl appeared to be possessed by some unknown force that was making her write the numbers.  That paper and the drawings get removed from the capsule in 2009 and distributed to the school to see if any of the kids had predicted correctly.  Of course Kaleb happens to get the paper the girl had written the numbers on.

Through chance, Kaleb's father (Cage) looks at a section of the letter and he seems to see a pattern.  The first pattern he sees is the date of 09/11/01 with a number after it.  Cage looks up the World Trade Center attack on the Internet and discovers the number matches the number of deaths that happened on that date.  Cage then starts checking all the other numbers and finds they sequentially match other disasters that had occurred since 1959.

Cage then notes that there are possible disasters listed after and he tries what he can to prevent them from happening.  Cage is then led to look for the woman who had written the original document but she had died several years prior of an overdose.  Cage then goes to find the woman's daughter who is a divorced mother with a daughter Kaleb's age.  The woman becomes frightened of Cage when he starts asking her questions about her mother and the impending disasters.

The movie keeps the audience riveted throughout as Cage tries to avert disasters and figure out the last prediction on the paper.  There are a bunch of mysterious men that seem to be like evil spirits that keep approaching Kaleb and the daughter of the the divorced mother.  Everything seems to be moving towards a disaster of world proportions and Cage must figure out the end of the prophesy or all that he knows may perish.

This movie has the feel of the recent movie The Forgotten but that movie was disjointed and disappointing at the end.  This movie is a compelling tale in which the audience is never bored and tries to guess what will happen next.  Well worth buying, renting or catching it when it comes to cable!",1261785600,2,2405,4.485057471264367
3602960,2,B001GCUNZI,".....so says a bewildered Nicolas Cage when he finally understands where the story is going. I know exactly how he feels.

`Knowing' is a mess. While it contains some fascinating and thought-provoking ideas, it combines them in a very forced and ham-fisted way. This is a film where major plot twists and revelations come out of nowhere, not in a clever way, just a jarring one.  What begins as a standard Nicolas Cage thriller quickly turns into a disaster flick, only to morph into an M Night Shyamalan quasi-spiritual epic by the third act. Think `Signs' crossed with `The Day After Tomorrow', with a dose of `National Treasure' and `2001' thrown in. Only not nearly as interesting or focused as that might sound......

It's such a shame, because Alex Proyas has shown that he can pull these sorts of ambitious, multi-layered stories off with `Dark City'. In its own way, `Knowing' is just as ambitious as that sci-fi masterpiece, but at the same time it seems to be trying to pitch to an audience of action and disaster movie fans. So Proyas has to try to balance depth with mass appeal, and just cannot pull these two disparate threads together. So on the one hand you have ruminations on chaos-vs-determinism and scepticism-vs-belief, but on the other you have flashy CG action, corny ""you complete me"" moments, and cringeworthy flag-waving. It makes me wonder who this film is meant to be for; there are enough elements to attract Cage action fans, disaster movie lovers, and those wanting intelligent sci-fi, without really pleasing any of them.

The performances of the leads are okay but nothing special, especially Cage, who can play these sorts of roles in his sleep and barely gets out of second gear for most of the film. Australian Rose Byrne does her best with a script forces her character to go hysterical in the third act for no apparent reason other than to further the plot. And fellow Aussie Ben Mendelsohn is there solely to be the clich'd tut-tutting sceptic who doubts the hero. Arguably, the child actors out-do the adults, with both Chandler Canterbury and Lara Robinson doing a good job with their roles. Robinson in particular is quite disturbing as the young Lucinda.

In summary, `Knowing' is a film of enormous potential that it never fulfils. With a tighter script and more focussed direction, this could have been another sci-fi masterpiece, or at least another eye-candy disaster flick. As it stands, though, `Knowing' is neither one thing nor the other; too heavy for action fans and too lightweight for sci-fi fans. It's sad to see Proyas lose his mojo as badly as this.",1261699200,,2607,4.836322869955157

3602985,1,B001GCUNZI,"I actually have been told that some people believe the world is going to end in 2012.  I've heard this again and again from people who seem to be bright.

""Knowing"" is yet another film about the end of days.  A theme which has taken over the thoughts of many people, most in the United States, for several years.

I am always troubled  by such films as ""Knowing"" for film technology has become so clever that the lines between truth and fiction blur more and more with every new story that comes along.

This film is fiction as is ""2012"" and the many other flicks out there that are making money by making films about current fears and obsessions of many, many people.  Fears and obsessions which seem to grow whenever there is a real or perceived as real crisis such as our economy bottoming out and the repercussions from that event.

Where I take exception is with people who will see this film as yet another reaffirmation of their fundamentalism and their fatalism.  And people who will see this film and forget they are simply watching some screenwriters creation.

It is time to talk common sense.  It is time to debunk the beliefs of anyone who believes this world will end.  And it is time to look at these films as ONLY entertainment that is scarey but nothing else.  The same way I as a young person looked at ""The Thing"", the 1951 sci-fi film, which was scarey and therefore fun to watch but did not leave me with the real fear that our world was about to be invaded by malignant bloodsucking carrots.

Some years ago, several end of days films were made.  Among a group of people they were quite popular.  As if death and destruction on a worldwide scale could ever be called popular.  The technology was poor as was the acting.  The intent of these films was to spread the word of evangelical faith and the belief that ""Revelations"" is nothing less than a road map of what will actually happen to all of us....someday.

""Knowing"" walks in those same shoes.  It takes that book in the Bible and adds a purportedly scientific and therefore credible interpretation to the story.

Frankly this film is nothing less than a clever promotion of the end of days beliefs so many many evangelicals embrace and have been for many years now promoting like crazy.  A slick and well done version of how the end will come that so called non believers could believe.  Right down to the end with the innocents and the ""tree of knowledge"".  A second chance for Adam and Eve to do ""the right thing this time"".....

I can't imagine what is more offensive.  The lame attempt to once again preach to the masses, meaning us, about a ludicrous idea that some will live and most will die in a fiery end.  An end run around common sense to actually get otherwise intelligent people talking about something evangelicals believe as gospel and promote as our collective future.  And our collective end.

Nicholas Cage is a great actor.  A great action actor.  But when he makes these types of films I'm not surprised he is bankrupt.  The same intelligence that should have made him police his accountants more was also lacking when he signed on to this propaganda.

End of days films seem to be very popular and if one stops for a moment and thinks about the religious belief behind these films, uses common sense in other words, one sees how obscene such beliefs are.  I am deeply troubled as a admittedly religious woman by anyone who anticipates happily such a dreadful end to this incredible world we all share when it also means that life, all life as we know it, ends.  Life which has committed no evil.  No wrong.  No sin.

One must always stop and remember how the Christian bible came about and the times in which it was created.  Terrible times of religious persecution and paganism reaffirming itself.  When I look at ""Revelations"" I do not see prophecy but propaganda.  How better to garner converts to your flock and keep them there than with a dreadful saga of the end of days in which only the converts will be saved.  As for the book of Revelations itself, one does not need medical training to see the ravings of a someone truly ill with insantiy. Not saintliness nor foresight but true madness.

Whenever a film comes about in these very troubled times that walks lock step with evangelical end of days obsessions it is important to remember that regardless of what we think we have done which gives us shame or sadness, we do not get a reset button.  It is up to each of us to instead do what we can in the future to live life in a better and kinder way.  The world is not going to end at all.  Those who think themselves saved, a group set aside to survive the imagined, and sadly hoped for, holocaust of holocausts, will not saved.

End of days obsessions have bubbled to the surface of christian faith throughout the last 2000 years.  In this country many times have we believed the end was coming.  It never did.

And it never will.  ""Knowing"" is yet another spin on this obscene idea cloaked in scientific tech speak and real sci-fi special effects.  But it is no different from the hackneyed films about this belief nor from any other end of time flick.  What it does is offer marginal believers a more acceptable way to swallow what is essentially a very evil idea and one only we, humans, could invent.

Instead of watching ""Knowing"" why not rent or buy the 1951 version of ""The Thing"".  Another sci fi film with humanistic beliefs throughout of ignorance and knowledge, of good vs. evil, of struggling with fear and the unknown, and the capacity of people to pull together and support oneanother.

Do your brain, your sanity, your faith whatever that is, and your humaness a rest and shun end of days films as the bunk they are.  There are large groups of people, mostly in this country, who want you to believe that the world is going to end, yet again, and in the not too distant future.  Films like this and ""2012"" do nothing but feed your fears and promote a terrible belief, an obscene fantasy, and in uncertain times like this we none of us need these types of films.  Real life right now is hard enough without a fantasy ""reset button"" that makes this, our true reality, all go away.

If you can watch this film and go ""golly gee"" at the special effects then enjoy.  If you are one of those people who are troubled by ideas being promoting in churches across this country about the end of days, then avoid this film and watch something else.  Don't feed your troubles, your anxieties, your fears, and your doubts.  See these flicks for what they are.  Gimmicks embracing apocalyptic ideas to get your hard earned money and frankly, gimmicks to promote a idealogy which goes against nature, against faith, and frankly against god.",1261267200,,6749,4.525619834710744

3602987,3,B001GCUNZI,"Firstly, to read and understand this review, you must have watched the movie. Last time I checked, a review is giving one's opinions about a movie, not summarazing it. There's plenty of those out there already to cover that base.

Now, I know this film was tagged with the title ""sci-fi"", but it goes beyond that. It fits more easily into the slot of spiritual, if you ask me, because there are so many references to God and the Bible and the after-life in this movie, that people who aren't into that sort of stuff will initially hate the movie.

Yet if you are willing to take a double-take, like what I did, and scroll through the movie just one more time, you can brush aside some of that to try and dig deeper, to realize what the director attempted to convey to us, the audience.

This movie confused me to the point of mildly hating it. It was unlike any disaster movie I'd seen before- it intertwined with more powerful, thoughtful concepts and bizarre, abrupt plot-twists, and even a strange ending. I think the director knew that the typical formula of disaster movies was beyond being thinned-out, and he wanted to produce something different to rock the world of thrillers in a modest yet touching way.

He failed.

The movie deals with too many concepts, too many parts, and too many secrets and plot ideas that I feel they forgot to tie up some of the loose ends. For example, I don't think they ever explained why the Whisper-People talked to Lucinda, yet didn't carry her away at the end- instead, she was dead. And why did the two children begin to hear the Whisper-People? Why did Caleb start scratching down dates if the world was going to end? And they never explained about the rocks. What was important about them? And the ending was so bizarre that it just threw me. Some scenes were too dramatic and over-gritty to be believable, and the special effects were sketchy at times. And why rabbits? Why the heck did they throw rabbits in at the last five minutes of screen time? When the credits rolled, I said, ""That was sucky.""

Yet at the same time... I'm hesitant to just throw away the movie as a failure, because it grappled with some interesting topics, and there were a few things I liked about the movie. To name just one, I liked how, unlike other disaster movies, the world truly did end, and no last-minute realizing brought us to the stupid relief that the world won't end after all. It stays true to it's movie cover, and the world does end. It suggests other worlds, a strange heaven-like world for the children, that makes me wonder if it is touching at Adam and Eve?

Anyways, it's definently worth one or two watches, to just get your opinion and try to understand more than just the disaster-film it's cracked up to be. It's deeper than that, but the director failed in making that the main concept, of making us concentrate on the gold values this movie could have offered, and instead slicked it up with faky CG, slow action, overly-dramatic sequences, and questionable acting.",1260576000,,3017,4.575925925925926

I think the religious undertones in this movie don't really detract from it as much as they make you think about where exactly we draw the line between proof and believing in something that we can't explain.  I personally believe that science and spirituality share more common ground than either side might realize, although I consider myself an agnostic.  I don't know if I'm right or not, and don't want to spoil the ending, so I'll just say that I looked through it with more ""Sci-Fi"" lenses than spiritual ones and really enjoyed the movie and the ending.

It took me two nights to get through the whole movie, I fell asleep the first time about half way through, now if that is because the movie is a little on the boring side or because I just can't hang past 10:00 at night I don't know.

  Here is the plot. Fifty years ago some manic depressive lookiong kid named Lucinda who hears voices and likes to draw numbers all over the place comes up with an idea for the school to plant a time capsule that will be dug up in fifty years. Lucinda drops off one of her pages full of nubers into the capsule to be found in the future by Caleb and his father John Koestler(Nicolas Cage) a professor of astrophysics at MIT. John Koestler somehow in a drunken stuper is able to figure out one night that the numbers pertain to dates and death tolls of every major disaster for the last fifty years. After going through all the dates John comes to the conclusion that there are still three disasters to come and if that's not enough  Caleb is being stalked by the men in black, and hears them whispering in his ears. John is able to figure out the third set of numbers next to each date refers to locations of the accidents that he uses his GPS to figure out where they will occur. He tries to stop a disaster in Manhattan subway station but fails. John eventually hooks up with Diana Wayland (Lucinda's daughter) who at first doesn't want to deal with him but comes around after the subway tragedy. Together they go to Lucinda's mobile home to search for clues and find out the last event is basically the end of the world. John and another professor figure out that a massive solar flare is heading to Earth and this is the last disaster from Lucinda's paper. I won't ruin the rest of the movie but it takes a turn for worst, and weird from here on the movie goes in a pretty lame direction.

  So whats the final verdict on this movie, rental at best, it starts off okay but is pretty slow moving and the ending really sucks. Nicolas Cage offers nothing and is his usual boring self that is probably part of the reason I fell asleep the first time trying to get  through this thing.

Cage, an astrophysics professor at MIT, works with the numbers and discovers that they are predictions of disasters by dates and longitude and latitude settings.  Cage tries to prevent these disasters from occurring.  This is the surface gist of the plot but there is so much more going on, much of it metaphysical and spiritual in addition to being sci-fi.  This film has some of the most gorgeous sci-fi effects imaginable. For those into action-adventure special effects, those are great too.  Cage is quite good here.  He has been in a fair amount of bad movies in recent years but this is not one of them. To say anymore would ruin the plot line, which is very engrossing as it unfolds.

The film ended up just a plodding mess, and at some times didn't make any sense.  The ending should have been cut off at the second-to-last scene, too, as that very last scene was just so silly and stupid, it cast a bad light on all you had just seen.  Darn it!  For me, it was watchable and at times, it was enjoyable, but was not the film I WANTED to see.  I can't understand how the final film could have been put on the market the way it was-didn't anyone actually see it before it's release??  Where were the editors here?

I was not bored, which I usually am, by the action sequences. And in the end I was not left, which I usually am, feeling that the movie was utterly predictable and will not stick with me for much longer.  This movie sticks, at least for me.

3603054,4,B001GCUNZI,"The problem in reviewing any movie is that in all likelihood one will inadvertently reveal too much and spoil it for others.  And I'm afraid I will as well.  Personally, I think this movie works best if people forgo looking at any of the reviews and see this film fresh and without prejudice (so rent it first).  That being said, here is my review.

KNOWING is an eye-popping movie with excellent visuals and special effects ... the airliner disaster had my jaw dropping.  It is also very effective as a countdown thrill ride.  I loved its ambiguities, but because of this, many people have different interpretations and either loved or hated this movie with equal ferocity, depending upon which interpretation they perceived.  Two such movies with similar conflicts are Stanley Kubrick's, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY and Steven Spielberg's (in honor of Kubrick who was to direct this movie) AI: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.

In 2001, ambiguities run rampant.  What did any of it mean?  What's the monolith all about?  What exactly turned HAL into a killer?  What in the heck happened in the entire last act?  In AI, one will ask many questions as well, especially, who were those creatures at the end?  Aliens (as so many believed) or highly advanced robots who were seeking knowledge of their creator (humans)?  People either hated these movies or loved them depending upon their personal interpretations.  Hint ... they were NOT aliens in AI.

In many ways we see the same ambiguities concerning KNOWING; are the creatures aliens or are they angels (or even a combination of both if one thinks our belief system was alien influenced)?  If one really watches and pays the least bit of attention, one ""should"" clearly see the director's intent.  Hint ... they were ... ________ (meaning: find out for yourselves).

I thought KNOWING was an entertaining ride that kept me interested throughout, but as we begin to understand that we may be looking at a disaster of mega proportions, other questions of why and for what purpose does this list of numbers serve, begins to settle in.  Is our universe random and chaotic?  Or is there an order and design that is impossible for us to grasp?  In truth, neither interpretation matters much because there is nothing the human race can do about cosmological events.

I felt that this movie was quite thought provoking (plenty of discussions around the water cooler).  Personally, I loved the numerology concept of this movie -- a random set of numbers that perhaps aren't as random as we thought on first look, which in itself raises more questions ... as does the Bible Code -- a meaningless set of letters and numbers that form words and meanings that can be found on any written page and book, while people see precisely what they want to see?  Or something else that is far more compelling and meaningful?).  There are many subtleties in this movie, far more than first meets the eye, and several that I didn't pick up on until the second viewing, including the significance of the boy's hearing problem (obviously, I'm not the only one to miss this).

I also liked the movie's pace, allowing the tension to escalate as each piece of the puzzle was laid out before us.  All in all, I'm happy to have this film in my fledgling blu-ray library.  To me it is an impressive film that allows the viewer to search his or her own mind on the questions it tries to raise.  I find this a strength, while for others it's a weakness -- there is a wide difference of opinion in the merits of this film, which I think was the director's intent all along.

For what it is worth, I viewed this movie on an LN40B630 Samsung HDTV, using an Oppo BDP-83 blu-ray player and a Zvox 2.1 sound system.  So what's my rating?  Times have changed, and I don't think I should just rate the movie, but also the blu-ray qualities as well. That being said, here are my ratings:

Video = a solid 9 out of 10 (some absolutely gorgeous and pristine scenes as well as some really stunning ""wow"" moments).

Audio = 8 out of 10 (even without a 5.1 or 7.1 system, I was impressed with the audio track -- it enhanced the entire movie experience).

Movie = a very solid 8 out of 10 (a very good movie, but a bit problematic in areas because of the purposely conceived ambiguities, which created its own plot hole).  And while the child actors were no Haley Joel Osment  or Dakota Fanning, I felt they did a credible job.  All-in-all, a much maligned movie (as was 2001 and AI) that I felt wasn't given nearly the credit it deserves.  BTW, and just to let people know where I'm coming from, I thought 2001 was a 5-star classic, while AI was a near-classic and a wonderful tribute to Kubrick.",1253664000,2,4687,4.62590799031477

Recently my wife and I watched the two end of the world films The Day the Earth Stood Still and Knowing. And while the acting on both could have been better, and the effects on TDTESS were much cooler, the message from Knowing is one that I enjoyed much better, and thereby the movie was one my whole family enjoyed quite a bit.

That message is that disaster could happen any time, but even with all our faults humanity, is something and needs to be a part of the universe.  We enjoyed the tension (such as it was) and while the subplots were merely distracting, the overall message was one to hold to and maybe even work on.

3603067,5,B001GCUNZI,"In all honesty, I only watched this movie because Roger Ebert gave it 4 stars.  I remember seeing the preview long before the movie came out and then almost instantly forgot about it.

Based on his review, I went to see the movie with 2 of my kids.  For the first half or 3/4 of the movie, I was beginning to think Ebert had failed me.  It's not that I didn't think it was a good movie.  It just seemed mediocre.  The whisper people were pretty creepy, but still, it didn't make the movie much better.

Near the last 30 minutes of the movie, I changed my mind completely.  The last part caught me totally off guard and I loved the movie for it.  For a moment I thought Nicholas Cage was going to fix the global wide problem (I don't want to give away too much of the movie) and they were all going to live happily ever after.  However, I was wrong.  The ending was very sad, but still managed to leave us all on a happy note.

I went back and saw it a second time and was able to appreciate the entire thing.  I was able to sit back and wonder if we're alone in the universe or not.  I'm convinced we're not alone.  But if we're not, who else is out there?  And are we in charge of our own destiny or is someone else in charge?  Are the creatures we see as aliens the same creatures we've seen as angels?

This film starts off with a little girl who hears voices and she writes down a bunch of numbers that gets put into a time capsule. She then scratches the final number on a door; You would think they'd send her to an insane asylum but she just lives out her life normally. Caleb, the son of John (Cage), gets the numbers when they open the capsule and now he hears voices as well. John is becomes obsessed to find the numbers mean something. The action picks up with a vicious plane crash and John seeks out the daughter of the girl who made the numbers. You know its easier just to watch the movie then explain the whole damn thing. Overall, the movie had a good pace but it always felt like it was lacking something. It also feels like it's been done before but does hook you in, even if you don't want too watch the rest of it. The ending was unique but again it felt like something i've seen plenty of times before. It really felt like an M. Night Shyamalan movie from beginning to end.",1253232000,2,1246,4.127572016460905
3603069,2,B001GCUNZI,"I suppose I should just let movies make stuff up but when they put Cage in a classroom as a teacher to completely misrepresent two philosophical concepts it puts me offside. Education is so poor these days that movies may be the only place that some people get to learn about these things.  Firstly there's not a dichotomy of ""determinism"" vs ""randomness"" in science or scientific philosophy.  Secondly determinism does not mean ""for a purpose"" and randomness ""for no purpose"". If I went round making a movie where I had professors stating things like there are two schools of thought ""Jesus was a God and did not bodily visit earth"" and ""Jesus was just a man who merely died on a cross"", I think a few people would get mightily upset.  This is because that is a misrepresentation of each of the two schools of thought and it is also making it seem like there are just two.  This determinism vs randomness scene is much much worse than that.  Then, a few scenes later, a cosmologist is seen reviewing a list of numbers with Cage which predict ""past future events"" accurately (past future events meaning that the prediction was verifiably made in the past, but has accurately predicted events between the forecast date and the date of review).  Cage's character has found the single biggest scientific archaeological find in history. Such an item would be of intense interest to every scientist of any persuasion.  But this cosmologist remarks ""Every scientific bone in my body says to ignore this?""  Whaaaat!!!?!!? Overall the Cage character has two key attributes: atheism and depression.  The movie tries to claim that the two are determined by each other until Cage relents in the end.  Aside from the anti-science theme in the movie, the movie was OK.  I didn't think they spent enough time developing the characters, so you couldn't care about them when things happened.  I think its because Cage's character was just so unbelievable that you couldn't develop a rapport with him. I think the reason people found the ending cheesy is that they don't know enough about modern pentecostal theology to recognise it.  This movie is a born again christian flic and is an interesting insight into their fantasy world.

3603073,5,B001GCUNZI,"""Knowing"", Nicolas Cage's latest foray into modern film fantasy (along the lines of his offbeat ""City of Angels""), is, at face value, an involving science fiction movie that evolves into a rather unsatisfactory religious one, with a very 'Old Testament' view of the Apocalypse, and a resolution that some may find redemptive, and others, depressing. But this is a film that, like the cult classic, ""Donnie Darko"", is far more than what you see, and may become, in time, just as popular, with novel 'takes' on predestination vs. random acts, subtle clues of the nature of the Divine, and questions raised that simply refuse 'easy' answers.

It is nearly impossible to review the film without giving away 'spoilers', and ""Knowing"" is best seen without the baggage of other viewers' predjudices, but I can praise the film's script (combining large-scale catastrophic events with a human story of a father's love of his child), extraordinary special effects, excellent production values (convincingly recreating Boston in Australia, where the film was made), and performances (Cage's film career has been a checkered one since he won his Oscar, in ""Leaving Las Vegas"", but this is one of his better performances in recent years).

The DVD's 'Special Features' include two documentaries, one very good (on the making of the film), and one, rather silly (a look at the end of the world, as seen by scientists and various religions, that attempts to make disasters still billions of years away seem imminent).

It must be doing something right to inspire such a broad range of feelings.  It really is a film (like most of Proyas' directorial efforts) that bears repeated viewings, thought and discussion.

3603095,2,B001GCUNZI,"Overall, I thought this movie was incredibly weak.  It did manage to build and maintain suspense and tension via spooky characters, lots of symbolism, and some intense special effects, but these devices were seemingly thrown together randomly, resulting in an incoherent mess.  Yet, even amidst this chaos, I can still imagine that the right ending might have been able to magically tie things together in a way that made the movie work.  Instead, the actual ending was utterly contrived and juvenile, and made no sense in the context of the preceding events, so it totally negated the few virtues of the movie and ultimately torpedoed the movie rather than saving it.

Also, when I watch a movie, I try to discern themes which teach life lessons.  This movie did have such themes, but drawing them out was like pulling teeth because of the manifold weaknesses of the movie, so I have to credit these themes more to myself than the movie.  A movie should at least meet the viewer half way ...

Finally, the acting was no better than acceptable, and it seemed like Nicolas Cage was mostly just going through the motions.  The other actors weren't any better.  And I guess I can't really blame their lack of commitment, given that the movie is so poorly composed, and thus probably beyond the rescue of even the best actors in the world.

Needless to say, I can't recommend this movie, not even for the sake of mindless entertainment to pass some time.  The only reason I'm giving it two stars instead of one is because there's still (a little) room for movies to be worse than this one.",1252540800,2,1585,4.66546762589928

It appears to have supernatural and demonic feelings in the beginning of the film, but as the movie progresses, while having you at the edge of your seat, you begin to see the whole picture. It went nowhere near where I thought the movie was going to go. I thought it was going to be a kid movie, in fact! I recommend this movie.

3603098,1,B001GCUNZI,"""Knowing"" is easily one of the dumbest, worst movies I've seen - there are spoilers in this review so don't read if you really have to see this and don't want me to ruin it even more than the filmmakers did when they committed this abomination to film.

Spoilers;

The plot goes like this - In 1959 school children put drawings of the future in a time capsule to be opened 50 years later. One poor girl is compelled to write down a string of numbers as her prediction for the future. These numbers of course are the key to the plot - they document every disaster with death tallies, date, and location of each for the next 50 years. At the burial of the capsule, two ""janitors"" place the capsule in its chamber. These ""janitors"" turn out to be some of the aliens who are choosing worthy children for salvation.

Now, if these aliens know all the dates and locations of all the world disasters for the next 50 years, including the apocalypse, why do they have to go through such a convoluted scheme of whispered, physic messages to torment one poor little girl and drive her insane. They could have simply given someone the message that they will be chosen to go to a new Eden in some sort of Rapture-ish end of days scenario. Instead, these omniscient aliens need to make a little girl crazy, wait for her to get pregnant, have a daughter, wait for the daughter to get pregnant and have her own daughter and then whisper spooky stuff to her.

At the same time, they have to wait for one slightly disabled boy to also be born, and by fate come into possession of the original paper with numbers from the girl in 1959, so he can bring it home to his borderline alcoholic father to discover the pattern and meaning of the numbers. Huh?

There's no explanation as to why this boy is hearing impairing - birth, accident, what? There's no apparent effect on anything because of this - hearing or lack thereof has no bearing on anything in the story. Yet we are repeatedly made aware that this boy needs a hearing aid.

We are never given any reason as to the selection of the two children by the aliens. The little girl is the granddaughter of the girl who scribbled the numbers, but the boy has no connection to anything, other than as a means of delivering the note to his father. But the numbers are nothing more than a documentation of events that will happen. Knowing about these disasters brings no ability to change the results. None of the disasters can be averted, so what purpose do the numbers serve? There is no purpose. The children could have been taken to the alien ship at anytime in there lives, as the aliens have been watching and whispering for at least the last 50 years. Why wait for the last day of life on earth and make for such a panicked departure? Oh, because it makes an exciting story! That's the only reason we get any of the big set pieces - jet crash, train crash - other than showing death and destruction, they mean nothing to the outcome of the story.

There are stones that are cryptically found throughout the movie. These are presented as if they have some profound meaning, yet there is never any payoff as to what that meaning me actually be. Are they representations of the souls of the dead? Are they representations of the saved? Who the hell knows? Why give us so many scenes that feature these stones and then never give a clue as to their reason for being in the story?

There's a lot of theology built in to the story, from the obvious Adam and Eve, Tree of Life, Eden stuff, to other devices. Cage's character is the son of a pastor, although he had turned his back on religion and led a life based on science. Only at the end, as he is about to die, does he turn away from science and embrace religion again. There are many allusions to eternal life and resurrection, including the heavy-handed bit about his wife dying in a fire in Phoenix. Ooooh - Phoenix, fire, rebirth...wow, how deep!

This movie was blatantly propagandizing, incredibly implausible, badly conceived, and a total waste of 2 hours of time. Awful. Hopefully if you read this, you will spare yourself the pain of watching it too.",1252281600,22,4142,4.446640316205533

3603103,4,B001GCUNZI,"Viewers wanting to see ""Knowing"" staring Nicholas Cage might expect a film not all that different from his ""National Treasure"" series or even perhaps ""The Da Vinci Code"" as from advertisements the story appears to center around an aged parchment with a series of numbers scribbled across it that seemingly predicts a series of disasters. However, by the film's conclusion, the apocalyptic symbolism alluded to is much more complex and potentially confusing than one might initially suspect.

After a series of catastrophes Cage's astrophysicist character witnesses as a result of deciphering the cryptic document, one begins to get the impression that the transcendent presence guiding events is more of a tangible one rather than a force in the background. Hints of this are introduced when mysterious figures reminiscent of less than normal looking versions of Men In Black begin to stalk Cage's son as well as the granddaughter of the character who wrote down the prophetic string of numbers in a flashback set fifty years in the past.

In most films one usually gets a distinct impression as to the forces overseeing mankind's eschatological destiny. Usually they are traditionally supernatural or more in the vein of what moviegoers would consider extraterrestrial or interplanetary. Seldom do I remember a film where the distinctions were blurred or melded to such a degree as in ""Knowing"".

For example, viewers were first given a hint of this as Cage and one of the adolescents come across an illustration depicting Ezekiel's wheel within a wheel. The overt supernatural overtones continued to increase with interactions with the Men In Black, especially when a blinding lights emanates from one of their mouths when confronted by Cage and as Cage's partially deaf son picks up a message over his hearing aide from the ""whispering people"".

By the time of the movie's climactic act, Ezekiel's wheel within a wheel has descended to the rendezvous point where it has arrived to whisk the children under Cage's care to safety away from the earth endangered by a gigantic solar flare. Not even at this point did screenwriters clarify where they came down theologically. For example, as Cage proceeded to board the craft, he was informed that only the chosen could enter.

Did this mean only those professing belief in God (about the best you can hope for from Hollywood as a positive ascent to the need for a relationship with Christ would be out of the question) since earlier in the film Cage's character hinted at lacking faith in a conscious divine power. Or more likely, were these tots suppose to be Indigo Children, a new classification of adolescent hypothesized to be the next step in human evolution as a way to explain a myriad of phenomena from such as why these children have IQ's higher than their parents to bratty teen behavior.

The distinction between garden variety extraterrestrial and angel is further blurred when these entities drop their humanoid facades to reveal themselves to be energy beings reminiscent of the Taelons from the early seasons of ""Gene Roddenberry's Earth: Final Conflict"". The obfuscation continues until the end of the film.

As the craft carrying the two children away from the earth lifts into space, the viewer realizes that these two youngsters were not the only two saved as they join a convoy of similar vehicles. Once more, while the average viewer might be sitting there dumbfounded as to what is being depicted, the viewer peripherally in the know will wonder if they have just seen a space age interpretation of the Rapture where it is believed that the saved will be whisked away by God to safety before destruction comes upon the world or rather, as non-dispensationalists have hypothesized, or how the masses will be duped into a pseudo-rapture orchestrated by so-called ""flying saucers"".

Even after all of this, ""Knowing"" at its end dumps even deeper metaphysical symbolism upon the viewer to wade through. For after the earth is destroyed with the elements burning up with a fervent heat as foretold in II Peter 3:12, we see the children running through a field towards a very distinct looking tree that could very well be the Tree of Life. But as with other moments in this film, we are not given any definitive answer as to whether the children are in Heaven or merely on another planet.

Those that go into ""Knowing"" expecting a supernatural thriller will not be disappointed. However, what they may not know about is the symbolic dialogue regarding some of the most profound spiritual issues facing the world today.

3603135,4,B001GCUNZI,"This is not my usual kind of movie to watch but I like Nicholas Cage. It is very exciting and you never know what is going to happen next. It's not predictable like many.

I'm not going to spoil any of it for you. It's a mix of science fiction. suspense, drama. Scary to the point it could be real, erie.

3603136,2,B001GCUNZI,"I gave this movie 2 stars; but if it wasn't for the decent special effects, I would have given it 1 star. Why? Because of all the false teaching regarding Creation and the End of the World. Aliens did not put us on Earth; aliens will not save any of us when it is destroyed. Jesus is the beginning and the end; the Almighty, the Creator. There is much evidence from the Bible that Jesus will return soon. Unfortunately, movies like Knowing and 2012 are spreading lies about the End and other matters.

Read what the Bible says about the End. Make no mistake; you will know when it happens, and you will know that God is bringing the End (it will not be some natural or man-made disaster). Take a moment and read 2 Thessalonians 1:7-10, and Revelation 6:14-17. View my profile; visit my website. May God have mercy on your soul while it is still the day of salvation.

Maybe some will like it more than others, but I won't be buying a copy.  Not worth it in my opinion.  I think the movie would have had a much better ending had it wrapped up in a more interesting man-driven conspiracy.",1251331200,4,516,4.171717171717172
3603138,4,B001GCUNZI,"I thought this was a very decent movie, with suspense and many questions opened. MAJOR SPOILER ALERT!  I took the ""Knowing"" in the title to work on more than one level.  On two factual instances: for the young girl in the 50's, having special Knowledge did not make her happy or give her peace; for the Cage character, Knowing that a catastrophe was going to happen did not mean he could avert the catastrophe. These two together also bring up all kinds of questions about fate, is it fixed, or are we ""trapped"" on a time line that cannot be altered?

I think that some reviewers take it as a given that Cage reverted to the Christianity of his father and sister in that last moment before death. To me the ending of the movie left this wide open and viewers could hope or see it as they wished.

If I, like the Cage character, knew I was going to die, I would seek out my loved ones because that, to me, is the underpinning of life. And that's what Cage did.  Cage's father said, ""This is not the end"", because he and Cage's sister Knew there was a heaven after death.  Cage did not argue with him because it was not the time, and, there was no need to.  The Cage character said, ""I Know"". He could say this, not because he suddenly believed in heaven, but because of his Knowing that his son and the other rescued children would carry on humanity.  In this one small poignant scene, we have two kinds of Knowing, and both are profound, both are comforting, both are valid.

The father and sister didn't know about the aliens. If they had Known about aliens, who probably weren't Christian (Christianity being an earth religion), would this have changed what what the father and sister Knew?

3603139,4,B001GCUNZI,"Knowing was really good. The end is kind of weird but for you religious folks out there, if you think about God making a revelation with the new world, the end is kind of like that.

3603140,4,B001GCUNZI,"Besides the fact that it seems like we have 'the world is going to end' movies every year, I still think that this approach is fantastic.  ""Knowing"" takes you on a mystery adventure.  It's not predictable and it's certainly not one of those movies you watch when you don't function.

""Knowing"" makes you think.

Nicholas Cage is fantastic in this movie as a father who's just trying to survive after his wife's death and dealing with his son who has a hearing impairment.  He looks like a madman half the time and then is a hero.  We follow the journey of a girl who left a ""drawing"" in a time capsule that's given to Cage's son in the movie, and it takes them to the girl's daughter and granddaughter.

After some misunderstandings, they are able to work together to follow the clues that have led to every major disaster in history and a few more that are coming to uncover what is coming.

The death of everyone else.

But the movie doesn't just end with the world exploding and everyone dying.

""Knowing"" is beautiful and funny and chilling.  It has beautiful special effects and a magnificient storyline.  Truly, it keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time and makes you cry.",1250899200,,1189,4.5046728971962615

3603142,3,B001GCUNZI,I am not a Nicholas Cage fan but I decided to watch this movie because of the subject. It was okay though A LOT of segi affects. I didn't care for the ending.

It also points to 2012 solar storm and what happens leading up to the apex of the event and how it would look on Earth as it occurs, how the media reports and how government agencies respond all the way to the end.

The cast works well with nic and his portrayal of the central character, they add to his emotioal portrayal in subtle ways that the audience is always able to follow what is going on in his world and his current and future choices.",1250899200,,673,4.6
3603174,2,B001GCUNZI,"I watched this movie without ""knowing"" anything about it.  If you don't know anything about the Bible you may like the film. It was very predictable in that it steals ideas from the Bible, and twists them with SCI-FI wierdness.  If I was going to see an end times movie this with themes close to the Bible I would rather have seen it be more factual.  Maybee Nickolas could have done his finger thing from Gone in 60 seconds, at least then I would have laughed at it more.  If you were going to steal ideas might as well be from your own work!",1250812800,2,543,4.1923076923076925
3603175,4,B001GCUNZI,"This movie couldn't decide what it wanted to be- it began as horror which remained speckled throughout, then turned towards a 'Day After Tomorrow' weather survival type film, and ended as a classic sci-fi thriller. There was even an un-explored love interest. While I wish it would have been more definite in style, I quite enjoyed the fast pace and creative twists.

The soundtrack was horrible. The CGI, however, deserves its own sentence: it was amazing. Usually my family makes it a game to decide what is practical effect and what is CGI, but they were blended so well none of us could find the seams! *SPOILER* They also took used effects- plane crash- and shot them from a totally new angle. This made the whole experience seem new and shocking. Loved that scene :)
I hardly ever buy movies, but this is one on my list. The tension was there, and the effects made up for the plot holes. (The father allowing his kid to just leave with 'strangers' like that is totally unrealistic.)

*SPOILER* They did make a mistake with the ending. We should have seen less. I was pleased with the mystery and wonder of the 'whisperer people' from the beginning, but after they took the kids from the dad and rose up into the sky the scene should have ended, and the melting world should have closed the film.

All in all- 4 stars. (Five if they had cut down that one end scene :)",1250812800,,1372,4.502008032128514
3603176,4,B001GCUNZI,"When I saw this movie advertised I wanted to see it, but somehow missed it in theatres. I've enjoyed films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Seventh-Sign/dp/0767817737/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Seventh Sign</a>&nbsp;and this seemed in the same vein. I did have some reservations.  If these numbers are predicting future events, either the hero manages to stop them or he doesn't - where does that plot go?  Surprisingly, it actually went somewhere and there was an unexpected supernatural/scifi element as well.

Nicholas Cage is at his best when doing a lighthearted role, as in the National Treasure films, so this was a bit of a stretch.  Still, he performed the role fine and had good chemistry with the little boy playing his son.  Most are familiar with the synopsis about the son finding the list of numbers that predict disasters, but the filmmakers added more mystery with ""whispers"" that the son (and the little girl who wrote the numbers) can hear.  The subplot added a lot of suspense and outright creepiness to what would have been a simple, been-there-done-that numerology tale.  This was more a scifi/disaster flick, and the special effects were top notch.  There appears to be a lot of upset regarding the ending - love it or hate it.  I thought it suited the movie very well, although I would have ended it about 2 minutes before the creators did.  I felt the very last scene was unnecessary, and a bit cheesy, but it didn't ruin the film by any means.  It's also possible a lot of dissatisfaction comes from ""reading too much into it.""  The spiritual element, the religious angle, etc...all of these are viewer perception.  Give it a chance and make your own judgment.

Overall, this movie starts out slow but really builds momentum and suspense with a couple good twists.  I agree with other reviewers that if you really don't like Nic Cage, then this movie won't satisfy you.  But, if you're looking for an entertaining thriller and don't have unreasonably high expectations this was well worth seeing.  I'm glad I bought the DVD as I will rewatch it.

The extras on the DVD are actually pretty good, considering it is only a single disc edition (and most seem to be bare bones these days!)  There is a commentary track and two extra features: a standard ""making of"" featurette about 10 minutes long and a featurette on apocalypses across cultures/religions that is about 15 or so minutes.  The second was very interesting including interviews with scientists, professors and the filmmakers.",1250812800,,2566,5.0933014354066986
3603177,3,B001GCUNZI,"Boy, I had low expectations for this. It got pretty hammered by the critics (except Ebert, who gave it four stars?!?) And the plot sounded like 'National Treasure'(help Nicolas Cage unravel the mystery!) meets 'Next' (Nic Cage does sci-fi!). And both those movies really sucked. But maybe I should have trusted director Alex Proyas more. After all, he did make a true 4-star classic with 'Dark City'; and while this movie may not be in that class, it is an above-average sci-fi/horror/thriller.

While the end-of-the-world storyline is okay, there are a few things that lift this up above the mundane. There is a horrific plane crash; then a little while later there is an equally harrowing train crash. There's the creepy men in the forest, right out of 'Dark City'. And there's the fact that the ending isn't completely Hollywood-ized. Plus, there's the added little bonus that it's supposedly set in Boston, so we can have fun with the geography (""how did he park in the Copley garage and then walk into the Museum of Science?"").

I can sit and nitpick at this all day long, but honestly, what's the point? As long as you go in with lowered expectations, you can expect those expectations to be met, you can enjoy the good scenes and laugh t the bad ones, and you won't feel you've wasted the past 2 hours of your life.

I watched this on a double-bill with 'Transformers 2'. I thought that movie would be fun and entertaining, while 'Knowing' might be barely watchable. Who knew that the exact opposite would be true? 'Transformers 2' couldn't even meet my low expectation, while 'Knowing' was far better than expected.",1250640000,2,1623,4.7686832740213525

If you like catastrophe scenes in movies (such as the film Armegeddon) there are a couple really good scenes in Knowing, particularly the Airplane crash scene which was so well shot and so convincing I had to watch it about 5 times.

The best way to start is to look it up on IMDB, and then look at the resumes of the two script writers.  They essentially have none.  It really, really shows.  The film starts off well, with a couple of picky contradictions that I forgave.  I shouldn't have.  They were the canary in the coal mine, warning of either poor research or total noncomprehension of the topic.

After a decent first hour, the script started compounding it's mistakes, like a six year old caught in a lie.  Not only are the aliens, given their power and knowledge, irrational, but the parents in the movie get a terrible case of the stupids.  The cast really tries to salvage the script.  However (spoiler alert) you just don't wave a gun at the aliens who are saving you son from certain death, especially when you already know he is about to die!  This, and several other truly awful moments, make me utterly unable to recommend the film.  My wife found it ridiculous also, and she and I are opposite ends of the movie watching spectrum.

From the trailers, and for the first two-thirds of this movie, that's where I thought we were headed, yet again. Things turn out a little differently this time, though. John Koestler is an widowed astrophysicist with a young son who comes into possession of a fifty-year-old coded document that precisely predicts dozens of disasters: Date, number of fatalities, and GPS coordinates. Turns out the little girl who made the predictions grew up, had a daughter of her own, and committed suicide. Now the daughter has a daughter, and she's hearing alien voices. And so is Koestler's son. There's one more disaster on the prediction list -- but no coordinates, because the entire Earth is involved. I kept waiting for the last-minute reprieve -- the solar flare would erupt in the other direction, or something -- but no. The prediction of the End Of The World indeed comes true. The performances all are competent but not remarkable, the script is pretty well done, and the score isn't bad, either. The script includes a few too many moral lessons for my liking, but whatever. As long as you don't object to the earth and all its inhabitants -- or nearly all -- being destroyed in the last reel, it's not a bad film.",1250208000,,1316,4.776315789473684

3603242,5,B001GCUNZI,"I'll start out saying that I read numerous reviews about this movie after I saw it. I was compelled to write this review (my very first one) because of the varied comments about the final scene. Most reviews gave a favorable comment about the first 90 min. but were sour, disappointed, or enraged about the end. I thought it was refreshing to see a new approach on how,why, and where we might end up. This movie is fiction. It was all it was ever ment to be. A reminder from and old song "" Well God only knows, and God makes his plans, the information is unavailable to the mortal man "". Any instituion or anyone who thinks otherwise has been drinking too much Kool-aid. The movie itself was, I thought, well written and well directed.

3603243,4,B001GCUNZI,"It's particularly revealing in the behind-the-scenes documentary on the Blu-ray for ""Knowing"" when the director is credited with bringing a more spiritual appraoch to the movie ""Knowing"" and when said director proclaims that he sees arguments for both a faith based explanation for the mysteries of the world and a science based approach, one can see why the movie turned out the way it did.
Though on the surface a purely science fiction movie with people exhibiting special powers and the earie presence of some ""spooky"" looking strangers (whose identity is pretty obvious from the get-go) and a closing sequence that bears more than a tip of the hat to the ending of ""E.T."", this movie also features an underlying element of faith and religion in both its symbolism, approach and visuals.
The plot for the movie is what initially drew me into the movie. In 1959 a new school is preparing for its grand opening and so children at the school are asked to draw what they believe the world will look like in 50 years, for a time capsule to be opened in 2009. The idea is that of a young loner of a girl, but when it comes time for her contribution to be placed in the capsule it is a sheet of seemingly random numbers.
Jump forward 50 years and the capsule is bieng pulled from the ground. The envelope containing the numbers is given to the son of a widowed Physics professor (played by Nicholas Cage). Later that night the professor examines the paper and begins to see dates in the numbers corresponding to disasters in the world.
What follows is oftentimes predictable and other times horrifying as we witness a plane crash (together with burning victims and people on fire) and another incident (which would be a spoiler to reveal) before Cage realizes the meaning behind the letters EE and that there is one last disaster he must face.
There is no doubt a message here and the ending is very predictable, telegraphed early on, but I really found myself enjoying this movie. The picture on this Blu-ray, as one might expect from a movie released in this era of high definition, is fantastic and the audio flawless (I literally felt like I was there at the site of the plane crash). The bonus features are a little light with a documentary and a rather dry commentary, but I would recommend picking this movie up.",1250035200,,2316,4.637469586374696
3603244,1,B001GCUNZI,"The reason being for my use of the line from Willy Wonka (the LSD trip tunnel scene) is because it relates to the movie's wasted potential of a concept. So picture this- Nic Cage in a thriller in which he's some sort of Nostradamus-like figure. Cool, right?

WRONG.

It's hard to believe that anyone would give this over 2 stars. Ebert obviously needs to adjust his meds if he gives it 4/4. Or maybe the older he gets, the more senile and easily pleased he gets? I dunno, you decide.

Maybe I'm being harsh on this movie by giving it one star, because for the first half it's actually quite good. For the first half. Nic Cage stars as an alcoholic widowed scientist who has a near-deaf son. His son attends the opening of a time capsule  at school and the object he gets os a piece of paper with a bunch of numbers on it, and each of them predicts a disaster.

For the first half, I enjoyed it. Then the second half stumbles in like a drunk man with no sense of direction.

Throughout the second half, Cage barges in on a lady's life and tries to convince her about her mother being psychic in THE WRONG WAY POSSIBLE, Barges in with the lady on her mother's trailer home, and far more other things. It also consists of randomly-drawn-from-a-hat-of-scene-ideas scenes. And than that ""twist""... HUGE WTF MOMENT.

I'm not a Nic Cage fan, but I decided to rent it on blu-ray anyways, and had the picture and audio quality not been so good I would have turned it off halfway. THe movie was a 3.5/5 until the second half, then it was lowered to a 1/5. ANd I don't mind a movie ending on a depressing note, as long as you can feel for the characters. I did not. I was just happy the movie ended.

Granted the special effects are good, the acting is average for a Nic Cage movie. But this movie is so bad it's almost like a parody of supernatural suspense.",1249948800,2,1848,4.305475504322766

""What do we do now?""
""How about some aliens?""
""Sure. Put that in.""

About half-way through this movie there is a scene where a forest is on fire and a moose comes running toward the camera, completely engulfed in flames. That moose was one of the lucky ones -- he didn't have to stick around for the last half of this complete crap-fest of a movie.

Nicolas Cage plays a brooding single-father MIT scientist whose life is all screwed up. You know his life is all screwed up because he drinks alcohol. Directly from the bottle. Only very messed up people do that. His son, played by a boy-shaped robot who talks. like. this. through. the. whole. movie. receives a sheet of mysterious numbers from a 50-year-old time capsule.

After spending another pathetic, miserable, lonely night with alcohol and Tivo'ed Discovery Channel programs, Nicolas Cage figures out that this one piece of paper has every ""tragedy"" or ""disaster"" that has ever happened for the last fifty years. From 9/11 and the recent tsunami all the way to a hotel fire that killed 30-some people. Seriously. Every tragedy as bad as or worse than a hotel fire on the entire planet for the past fifty years is on one piece of notebook paper. Quite an achievement.

Here's where the plot really picks up. There are three future dates left on the paper. Cage talks to a scientist buddy, whose reaction is pretty much, ""Wow, the date and death count of every disaster for the last fifty years is on a piece of paper that's been buried underground for half a century. As scientists, we should ignore this completely."" Riiiight.

Cage basically walks into the first disaster, way too late to do anything about it. He tries to stop the second disaster, but he doesn't really know what the disaster was going to be and probably wouldn't have been able to stop it anyway. So here's Nicolas Cage, batting 0/2 on the whole ""preventing-disasters"" front, his robot-child who hears whispers in his head coming from Spike from ""Buffy"", and one last date which foretells the mack-daddy of all disasters. The total annihilation of the planet. ""How am I supposed to stop the end of the world?"" whines Cage. And so he doesn't.

The rest of the movie is an incoherent mess. Throughout the whole movie, they make a huge deal about these little black stones, and then the movie ends and you're like, ""What was the deal with the black stones?"" Every living being on Earth is about to be char-grilled in a huge wall of fire, which obviously converts the atheist scientist immediately to Christianity. A handful of children are saved by space creatures and/or angels, while the other 6.7 billion or so people die a horrific death.

But then you think -- wait, if everyone just dies in the end, what was the point of all that running around trying to prevent tragedies? It's like if you watch ""Die Hard"", and Bruce Willis is running around an office building trying to save the hostages from the terrorists, and then before he can save anyone, LA is nuked and everyone dies.

The upside, of course, is that after watching all of the soulless, wooden acting in this movie, by the time it is ending you're really rooting for the giant wall of fire anyway.",1249776000,8,3253,4.704745166959579

3603250,5,B001GCUNZI,"_The Knowing_ (2009) is an excellent and bizarre science-fiction film which has one of the weirdest endings I have ever seen.  The film stars Nicholas Cage as an MIT professor of astrophysics who studies the sun.  The film begins with a disturbed young girl who writes a series of numbers on a piece of paper for an assignment at school.  This page of numbers is placed in a time capsule along with other drawings by kids to be opened at some future date.  In the future, Nicholas Cage is teaching a class when he brings up for discussion the issue of determinism.  Cage maintains that the universe is truly random and that ""things just happen"".  Later on, we see Cage's young boy receiving the list of numbers after the time capsule is opened.  Cage begins examining the numbers and discovers that all dates refer to a series of disasters.  On his way to pick up his boy from school, Cage suddenly finds himself involved in a gigantic airplane crash and tries to rescue the few remaining passengers from the flames.  This too turns out to be predicted in the list of numbers.  Cage approaches his friend at MIT and tells him of the list, but his friend claims that Cage is only seeing pattern where there is none.  Cage also tries to contact the mother of a young girl, who as it turns out is the daughter of the disturbed woman who wrote the list.  Later on, Cage is involved in a subway accident that too is predicted on the list.  This leaves one number left.  The woman with the young girl, played by Rose Byrne, makes contact with Cage and tells him that this date is to be a catastrophe and her mother had predicted that she would die on that date.  Cage suddenly realizes that this date will involve a gigantic solar flare that will complete destroy the earth as a habitable planet.  Meanwhile, the young children are being contacted by a group of mysterious individuals known as the whisper people.  Cage and the woman decide that the only way to possibly survive is to go underground.  However, through a series of mishaps the woman drives off and ends up at a gas station.  Here, we are to discover the truth of her mother's predictions.  The film includes one of the most bizarre endings I have ever seen in a movie as the whisper people attempt to save the human race.  The ending scene is biblical in proportion featuring reference to the Garden of Eden and the Tree of Knowledge, offering mankind one last hope for survival.

I thought this film was interesting in that it takes seriously religion.  The film shows that there is indeed pattern in the universe.  While the film ultimately will succumb to alien influence and gnosticism, it does seem to be one of the few to take the Christian belief seriously.  The ending is extremely unexpected and this is part of the reason that makes the film so good.  Highly recommended!",1249689600,4,2841,4.543307086614173

3603304,3,B001GCUNZI,"OK, can we all agree that Hollywood has to stop the cinematic trainwreck that is Nicolas Cage?  Clearly, he is not the same actor he was in the 80's and early 90's.  I can't put my finger on exactly when, but somewhere along the line his acting transformed from quirky, understated and unpredictable to the king of cliches and bad hair plugs.  He is now a one note actor playing the same character in every role he takes.  Knowing is the perfect film to highlight this point.

For those who don't know the plot, Nicolas Cage plays John Koestler, an astrophysics professor at M.I.T.  He is a recent widower and has a son, Caleb.  Via the opening of a grade school time capsule, Caleb comes into possession of a sheet of paper containg a string of seemingly random numbers.  At home, Caleb's father notices the paper and figures out that the numbers are not random, but in fact are more meaningful than anyone could ever imagine.

Initially, the film does a good job of building intrigue and suspense with these plot tools.  I'll admit I was sucked in and ready to follow where the story led.  Sadly, by the end of the film I was left feeling that Knowing was a potentially great film, instead earmarked by a littany of missed opportunities and poor execution.

Knowing has very grand aspirations in its premise and in the beginning had me believing it might just achieve them.  But far too often the film lowers itself by incorporating stock and/or just plain stupid characters, frequently laughable dialogue, recycled plotlines and a rather deflating ending.

Some may feel this movie is well cast.  I do not.  Given the sub-par dialogue, this film would have really benefitted from better acting.  Nicolas Cage is the biggest offender here.  His performance was uninspired and frankly felt to me as if he ""mailed it in"".  I didn't believe for a second that he was an astrophysicist at M.I.T. because Cage makes no effort to sell the role.  Instead, he trots out the same hangdog mope he seems to play in all his films these days.  In fact, they may have to start giving his raised eyebrows their own credit, since it appears to be the only expression left in his acting repertoire.

Predictably, there is a female interest woven into the story.  And while the writers deserve some credit for not foisting upon viewers a romance between her and John Koestler, that should not suggest that her character helps the film.  Quite the opposite.  The character is stock, one-dimensional and wholly unnecessary to the plot.  Hers is a tacked on ""by the numbers"" role obviously doomed to be a plot martyr from the first scene in which she appears.  Her character is also profoundly stupid which is proven time and again in the final act.

The most frustrating aspect of Knowing is the maddening unevenness of the plotline.  At times, I was captivated by events on the screen only to be brought back down to Earth a few minutes later by podnerous dialogue or incredibly stupid behavior on the part of the main characters.

On a positive note, there are a few action scenes that are undeniably breathtaking and the film is worth seeing just for those moments.  I am not overstating the matter when I say they are some of the best action sequences I've ever seen on film.  These scenes foster a palpable adrenaline rush that will leave you wanting more.  But instead the plot quickly reverts back to its previously morose mood, snail's pace and in the process pulls you back down with it.  I am sure this was by design, but frankly, it hurts the film rather than helps it.

The build up to the closing act is sizeable and makes big promises which, toward the end I began to doubt it could keep.  Sadly, those doubts proved to be well founded.  The last half-hour feels rushed, sloppy and lacks focus.  Where we expect to be blown away, we instead receive a highly derivitive amalgam of two or three different Spielberg endings (Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T., A.I.).

All these flaw however cannot keep me from recommending the film.  The premise is full of promise after all and there are a few moments of inspiration that make the trip mostly worth taking.  But in the end you are still left wondering what this movie could and should have been.",1249430400,4,4246,4.6305220883534135

The rest of the movie is a discovery of what this mysterious writing means and how the principal characters deal with the implications.

A great hook, to be sure. However, if you are looking for an uplifting movie, I'd recommend you'd pass. The special effects are disturbing, graphic, but not necessarily gory. There is a certain detachment throughout which mollifies some of the impact of the concluding, fantastic ending.

I watched this because the premise was intriguing for a science fiction movie.

The first scenes are in a school back in 1959.  The teacher asks the class to draw pictures of what the world will look like in 50 years.  All the Fifth Grade children drew pictures, except for a prescient young girl, Lucinda.  She writes numbers all over the page that turn out to be dates of future tragic events.  Lucinda looks dark and ghoulish - It is hard to figure out why she has this power and where she came from.

The story then fast-forwards 50 years to the opening of the time capsule and the envelopes with pictures distributed to the current class.  You wonder why the script did not stick to the time capsule and the reason Lucinda knew the dates of tragic predictions.  We see shadows of her that disappear but then realize she recently passed away.  Then we see polished black rocks show up - I never understood why.

A young hearing impaired boy gets Lucinda's numbers.  His father is an astrophysicist (Nicholas Cage) that dithers in his MIT classroom about ""Determination"" and ""Random Chance"" - of planets being places for intelligent life.  Because of his high intelligence he quickly discerns the numbers are dates and death tolls from disasters that happened after the capsule was buried.  There are three dates that nothing has yet happened.

Then the movie jumps from one rabbit hole to another - nothing makes sense to the point of the original plot.  We hop from the father's drinking, the loss of the mother, wondering where Lucinda came from, solar flares, hearing aid issues, helicopter parenting, issues with parenting and parents, then we have a leap of faith that aliens for some unfathomable reason want to take a young boy and girl to another planet,

It is very hard to categorize this film. I call it a science fiction-disaster thriller. It starts out like a horror film with a very wierd girl and a time capsule that is perserved in 1959. It contains letters written by children and is opened in 2009. Each of the present day children, including Nicholas Cage's son Caleb (Chandler Canterbury - who gives an awesome performance), gets a letter. Caleb gets the letter from the wierd girl that contains nothing but numbers. But soon we find out the numbers are days and location numbers of all disasters from 1959-2009. Two are shown in the film in spectacular fashion. Caleb and his dad eventually find the relatives of the wierd girl who wrote the letter in '59; a woman and her child. I will not spell out the whole story here but the two disasters we see and all the others mentioned lead to a day in 2009 that earth will never forget.

The last scene between Caleb and his dad is simply heart breaking. The last disaster is visually impressive as well. The ending will inspire you.

I think the movie is trying to discuss the subject of determinism and randomness as Nicolas Cage briefly talked in the beginning of the movie.. It doesnt matter if the people in black turned out to be aliens or whatever, I think the message is: the universe is not random and everything is done in a determined way and you KNOWING the future changes nothing because everything is already pre-determined..

It was only when Nicolas Cage submitted to this faith, that he was able to give up his son (he believed he would be with him in another world forever and ever) although in the beginning of the movie he didn't believe in God or heaven or anything..  I have read some reviews about this movie and they mostly discuss it as a movie about disaster prevention: IT IS NOT.

The little girl in the beginning of the movie writing the prediction paper is nothing, just a tool to give you the future on a piece of paper, it could have been anything else (a paper falling from the sky, or Nicolas Cage dreaming of dates, etc...). I believe the girl writing is not important to the message the movie is trying to convey, she is just the tool the director/author used to give the future on a paper (because of you think about it, there is no purpose for the aliens for humans to know the dates..it is not like they believed humans can stop disasters from happening). So, the alien thing is totally irrelevant to the story. In fact, you can think of the aliens and space ship as God sending angels to save the children, but again it is irrelevant and does not serve the main message at all so I will not dwell on this.",1249084800,2,1853,4.316091954022989

Koestler's cosmology is one that favours an indifferent universe in which humans suffer at the whims of unfathomable random chance. Secluded in his crumbling country house with only an ever-present bottle of Whiskey and Albinoni for company, Koestler finds his nihilistic paradigms radically shifted after stumbling across a piece of paper, unearthed from a school time capsule buried in nineteen fifty nine, which apparently contains a numerical code predicting the dates and locations of the major natural and man-made cataclysms to have befallen the planet within the last fifty years. Koestler's sense of unease is further pricked by the fact that at least three of the predicted dates have yet to pass...

Thus you are introduced to the central conceit at the heart of Alex Proyas film. Well, actually not in that order (you do discover, within the first five minutes of the film, exactly who is responsible for the numbers on the paper) and it was this deflation of potential suspense and mystery, along with a few other directorial and stylistic choices, which just prevented the film from being a latter day classic of existential unease, as far as I was concerned.

Proyas as a director has always been variable.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Crow-Miramax-Dimension-Collector-s-Series/dp/B000059XUO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Crow (Miramax/Dimension Collector's Series)</a>&nbsp;- despite it's seismic influence within the Goth community - was always a film that I could take or leave; I thought&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-City-Director-s-Cut/dp/B0018O4YT0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark City (Director's Cut)</a>, bar the first twenty minutes or so, was a work of genius; and I consider&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Robot-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JN0T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I, Robot (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;to be not only one of the worst films ever made, but probably 'the' worst adaptation of a science fiction novel (if you want to see what it could have been in the right hands, I strongly recommend that you check out Harlan Ellison's unproduced film adaptation,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Robot-The-Illustrated-Screenplay/dp/1596870419/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I, Robot: The Illustrated Screenplay</a>, which was published a few years back). That said, this film is one of Proyas more servicable efforts. It is by no means a classic, but it does have a weirdly compulsive sensibility all of it's own that hooks the viewer and, more importantly, and in opposition to most modern Hollywood cinema, it takes it's own sweet time to unfold the plot and develop the characters. On the downside, it does concede to the dictates of overt Spielbergian Blockbuster schmaltz in far too many places, which detracts from the power and ambiguity of the film as a whole.

Performances are decent enough - Nicolas Cage, with a few exceptions, has always been an actor who has irritated me due to his propensity to saddle his characters with quirky affectations. Thankfully, that proclivity is kept to a minimum here and we are treated to a gaunter, quieter more reflective character (something which he does excel at when he chooses too  - see his excellent turn as 'Yuri Orlov' in the brilliant&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lord-of-War-2-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000BYA5GO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lord of War (2-Disc Special Edition)</a>). Rose Byrne also makes a decent fist of her screen-time as a character whose life has been haunted by the notion of prophecy. Sadly, the two child leads - who turn out to be an intrinsic part of the plot - are merely servicable within their roles, which was something of a let-down.

On the production side, Whilst the foggy, autumnal cinematography was a treat, I found the CGI effects to be extremely weak (but then I always have found CGI to be unconvincing). Marco Beltrami's string-laden score was also, for the most part, a treat for the ears - up until the point where the John Williams imitations became too overt.

On the whole, this film probably only deserves three stars, but I've given it a four star rating because it very deliberately sets out to lead the audiences to their own conclusions about what they have witnessed - something of a rarity in today's big budget cinema. There is a lot going on beneath the surface here. Some of the mythological and religious references are overt (naming a male lead experiencing portents of revelation-style disaster, ""John"" is fairly obvious ) and some are very subtle (the use of the rabbits - the rabbit having long been a mythological symbol of death, change and transcendence in many cultures) and the final image is as positively Old Testament/Kabbalistic in its symbolism as its possible to be without conceding outright to the dictates of an overt theological interpretation of events.

Proyas should also be commended on his decision to see this dark vision through to it's logical conclusion; I do wonder how many battles he had with studio executives to get his denouement filmed and approved.

A decent film which suffers at the hands of commercial notions of film-making, ""Knowing"" is definitely a film that I'd advise that you rent, before you buy.",1248825600,,5645,5.767106842737094

You might recognize Chandler Canterbury from Benjamin Button, or that really creepy episode of Criminal Minds; He plays a naive boy that can't figure out that the voices that are whispering in his head are aliens.

This movie is a mish-mash of themes: horror, suspense, and disaster; NONE of which are properly or successfully vindicated through its execution. Nicholas Cage gets the one star on this review for singularly carrying a mediocre script, while the rest of the cast flounders along behind him. The special effects were impressive, but even good special effects weren't enough to save this horrendous movie OR add another star to this review. The brief touches on theology are ill-formed, poorly executed, and inconsistent; it's like the script writers were having a theology war and nobody won so they just threw it all in the movie. The story progression, while well written at times, was mostly too sporadic and fragmented to follow without intense effort. And the story itself just continues down a path towards absurdity until it becomes completely unbelievable..... until in continues further to the point that will have you yelling things like ""You have GOT to be KIDDING ME!"" and ""Oh, COME ON!"" at the screen by the time the movie concludes.

3603414,1,B001GCUNZI,"Oh man where do you start with this thing? By looking over the 100+ reviews posted here, it seems you either love this movie or you hate it. I am firmly lumped into the hate it group.

What starts off as a nifty little flick with a decent premise, soon devolves into a craptacular CGI disaster film, that begs the question...what is more frightening:
1. The premise set forth in the film?
2. What is happening with Nicolas Cage's hair?

Don't worry no spoilers here, but let me lay out the basic premise. In 1959 a newly built elementary school decides to commemorate the occasion by burying a time capsule which will be opened in 50 years. All of the 5th grade kids are asked to draw pictures about what life will be like in 50 years. One little nut-job who looks like Winona Ryder fused with Wednesday Addams scrolls out a series of numbers instead of drawing a picture. Now flash forward to the present day, and you have Nicolas Cage as a single father mumbling about a bunch of stuff to his son, who is not deaf, yet still wears a hearing aid and speaks in sign language. What? Well the fifty years have gone by and Cage's son gets possession of the numbers list written by the wierd little kid five decades earlier. Cage mumbles a bit, and you realize his hair is growing in one seriously odd pattern starting about halfway back on his skull. Cage suddenly begins to see a pattern in the numbers while on a one night bender and mumbling some more. Showing all the emotional range of Keanu Reeves on a bad day Cage senses something bad is coming....we know this because the overly dramatic musical score tells us so.

While the premise of ""Knowing"" has some potential, as the film plays out, you will lose all interest. The characters are cookie cutter Sci-Fi channel composites, the CGI is abundant and cartoony, and by the draw droppingly asinine conclusion you will just find yourself angry that you've wasted two hours. I honestly wouldn't recommend this flick to anyone. ""Knowing"" is just a huge mess.",1248739200,7,2010,4.54696132596685
3603415,2,B001GCUNZI,"I cant even readily identify what genre this movie belongs to, because it fails on so many levels. The writing was so disjointed that it managed to spend 2 hours criss-crossing between sci-fi, spiritualism, numerology, and impending apocalypse without making any kind of coherent statement. At the end of the movie, I was left with a 'what did I just watch?' feeling. It starts simply enough with a numerological message scribbled by an odd young girl thats placed in a time capsule. Lo and behold when the capsule is opened, it ends up in the hands of an astrophysicist who readily deciphers it as containing a roadmap to dates, locations, and casualties related to all major disasters in the past 50 years with more to come. It tries unsuccessfully to establish that everything is ordained, that things are not random, and there's nothing we can do to prevent fate from unfolding. When aliens (yes, aliens) start gathering 'chosen' children to be evacuated from the impending apocalypse (rapidly approaching in the form of a massive solar flare) there's a sense of pointlessness. It's never explained why some are chosen or why aliens are even bothering to save them. Throw in a dose of spiritualism to confuse things even more, and you'll get a sense of the utter lack of direction in this mess.",1248739200,6,1298,4.851351351351352

I gave it a three for some good suspense and very good special and visual effects, notably the plane crash and the end of the world.

But for aliens that are supposed to be smart enough to travel to other worlds, these guys are really DUMB.

They take the kids in order to save them and reseed another planet with them. OK, it's nice to know that they consider the human race worth saving.  But, these are KIDS!  Why didn't they take ANYONE along to help them survive?  Dropping them into a field of ""wheat"" is great--how are they going to get food/shelter/other necessities for life?

And the biggest DUH! for me is that of all the species that the earth has--they choose to save BUNNIES?  Excuse me; I have one word for you--AUSTRALIA!  Anyone with the sense to search the internet knows what introducing rabbits did to the environment there.

3603417,1,B001GCUNZI,"!!!Fear not, this review is spoiler free!!!

 Now, let me start off by saying I have nothing against religious movies. As a matter of fact, I find it can add some interesting flavor to a plot line if done right. That being said, this movie is terrible....& I would really like the two hours of my life I wasted back.

 At first, I was starting to groove on it...but it's like the creator of this flick lost his focus half way through. It's full of plot holes big enough to sink a planet into, the acting is obscenely horrific, & the only intelligent people in this movie are the children.

 I seriously suggest skipping this one. I wouldn't even call this movie a guilty pleasure...All it accomplishes is making my brain hurt from the sheer mass stupidity of the whole experience.

 If you really want a good good religious movie...there are plenty out there. We aren't exactly short on decent disaster flicks either. If you really want the too combined there are still better options than this one.

  Personally, I suggest you go out & pick up a copy of Stephen King's The Stand. It was a mini series (based off a book, of course) released on the SyFy Channel back in 1994. It blows The Knowing out of the water as far as religious/disaster movies go. The acting is good, the plot is well written, & the characters can actually manage to conjugate a whole sentence without having to pause dramatically every other syllable uttered.

 That's my advice on this movie. Hopefully you'll take it...because seriously folks, you're just better off not knowing.",1248566400,,1555,4.631386861313868

3603421,1,B001GCUNZI,"Right off, I have a request: can the writers of ""Seventh Heaven"" please stop writing Sci-fi? Honestly, I love a good horror/scifi film with religious concepts (I loved ""The Prophecy"", ""Constantine"", ""The Order"",etc), but this one slammed the viewer over the head with religion and sat back smug about it. What do I mean? Well, as soon as we are introduced to Cage's character we learn that he is a MIT professor who is teaching chaos verses determination theory in his class and that he favours the logical, nontheist based theory. Can you guess how happy his home life is? He is the single father of a hard of hearing boy and drinks himself to sleep at night because his wife died in a fire. Oh, and just to bludgeon you some more with how off course and empty his life is, his father is a minister (can someone tell me how a supposedly selfless man of the cloth lives in a house easily worthy 3 million dollars? No one touched on that) and Cage has turned his back not only on God and his family but has surrendered to ""Godless"" science and alcohol. Hmm, can you guess how this film will end? If you said (spoiler) by Cage finding that logic and reason really are the tools to a sane life and quitting drinking for rational reasons you haven't been watching the morality plays that now masquerade as scifi these days. Honestly, can there be one film in which the overeducated professor isn't rendered souless and crippled until he turns to some higher power? I bet AA people will love this one, it's straight out of the ""Blue Book"".
 Long story short, Cage's son is given a series of numbers written 50 years ago and left in a time capsule which ultimately predict the end of the world. Why is he given this? Can Cage do anything at all to stop it or to try and save humanity? Nope, it's just a doomsday clock. What a freaking let down. Oh, some aliens who appear in the form of angels show up to take a few children away to another planet (I suppose to repopulate the human species) in an obvious Adam and Eve allusion, but that raises the questions: why not take their parents? Wouldn't the children be happier and better adjusted if accompanied by their parents? And what if they don't like the kid with whom they are paired (hey, the two main kids only knew each other for two days. They might actually detest each other after spending some time together)? Also, if the aliens didn't save us because we're ""unworthy"", why continue the species? Obviously everything that makes us human in found in the chosen children. Their offspring will simply destroy this new planet. And on and on. This film had so many holes I felt as if I were watching Swiss cheese.
  I love a good apocalyptic film (The 6th Day was one of the ones I liked best) and a healthy dose of religious influence almost always adds a bit of drama, but this failed on every level. I'm sure Christians will hate the ""Aliens as Gods and Angels"" concept presented in the film, and secularists such as myself are sick of religion being presented in socalled scifi films as the panacea to all life's sorrows. Mazel tov, writers of this film, you managed to create something which irks people on both sides of the God debate. Now go hole yourself up in a church and find real religion or just try to be normal and live your lives. Either way, stop pushing this cotton candy propaganda on the American public.

You can read the back of the DVD box to 'know' what this movie is about, but what it won't tell you is that it's really about nothing.  The message is: ""Humans are stupid to think that knowing anything is any kind of power or control over their existence.""

Knowledge isn't any kind of power because we (especially Nicholas Cage) can do nothing with that knowledge to forestall tragedy or doomsday.

What's worse, it's ALIENS that control our fate.  Aliens that look kind of like angels in the end.  If they have that kind of power, why not stop the stupid solar flare?  Oh, I guess there are limits.

By the end of the movie, one is left thinking ""Well that's depressing what's the point of life?""

Made me want to by one of those suicide kits from 'Children of Men'...at least that movie had a point.

There was literally no point to this movie AT ALL.  Just someone wanted to obliterate humankind (and all living things on Earth) with a solar flare, so they stitched together a poorly plotted movie to achieve that.

Some people need to stop selectively reading science magazines.

3603445,5,B001GCUNZI,"Knowing was an impressive story about a man whose son receives a long letter with a series of numbers on them.  The man, played by Cage, is a mathematician at MIT, single dad, misses his wife and longs for a better time.  After receiving the letter, a series of the numbers leads Cage to review them showing that they seem to reveal dates and catastrophies.  He now knows that more is to come.

We find him solving more and more clues as he races from one place to another trying to see if the messages are there to help him solve them.  The writing ends mysteriously and Cage has to have help in solving the remaining clues.

Since we live in a time where disasters have seemed to excelerated recently, there is a some intriguing thought around the movies overall concept.  Cage does an excellent job with his intense nature.  Lara Robinson is in the movie twice, as a young girl who is becoming friends with his son.  She also plays her own grandmother as a little girl back in 1959.  Very cool stuff.

This is a great sci fi end of the world story.  Much more interesting than the recent 'Day the Earth Stood Still.'  Great effects, great story, and at least the message is not anti-humanity.  Definately worth it for the sci fi and prophecy buff.",1248307200,3,1250,4.425438596491228

These numbers used to crack the code of destruction come from some unknown force, a force determined to save what little of the human race it can before the end.  That's really all you need to know - oh, the acting is wonderful, the special effects suburb and the movie, if you watch it with an open mind, should stay with you for a long time.  I did NOT see the Bible in this movie, as some did, but that's part of the beauty of it.  What you see might just match your beliefs, whatever they are.

The scenes were powerful and managed to be exciting, even when they probably shouldn't have been. The film will practically cripple your emotions at points and your jaw will drop in surprise. These are the makings of a great thriller.

The special effects are also particularly impressive, though I was disappointed that quite a bit of the story's biggest plot points were a bit predictable. There was also pretty dark lighting during scenes that became really annoying, and I don't know why directors persist on making the scenes too dark for the viewer to see. It doesn't build suspense and it just becomes a strain on the eyes.

Knowing is a great film that I highly recommend to anyone who likes a good thriller, Nicolas Cage, or relatively good special effects (though some of the CGI became pretty annoying). It's not the best film ever, but it's still one of the best films of last year.",1248220800,,1039,4.672131147540983

This is one of those rare movies where the ending CAN and DOES ruin the whole movie! I mean honestly Nicolas Cage coulda just sat in a chair the whole movie and the end result would have been the EXACT same! This movie's ending makes the ending the ""The Village"" look fantastic!

If you don't like to think or be challenged, you won't like Knowing, but then why would you think you wanted to see it? Great special effects/ CGI and a well written but still mostly unpredictable script make Knowing a cut above most movies released recently.  I say mostly because If you are paying attention the general end of the movie is talked about in the first scene, not extremely subtly (the telescope scene)  and little pieces are added in a sometimes obvious manner (the sun discussion in Cage's class) , but on the flip side there were elements (tropes) that I was sure were going to be utilized and weren't. for instance (minor spoiler perhaps), ""knowing""  Rose Byrne is pictured as the grown up version of the little girl who wrote the number list in the first place, and deeded her property to her daughter (also played by Rose Byrne)  I assumed that she wasn't dead as supposed and we were going to be 'treated' to a reappearance.  didn't happen, and I was pleasantly surprised.

Whatever your view (I myself and deeply convicted that we are sustained and drawn to ONE creative BEING...JESUS CHRIST) Knowing presents thought provoking scenarios that most movies steer clear of.

(I am biased with anything with Cage in it!) Good characters, but some action just not believable.  Good story line, moved along at a good pace.  Nice visuals.  Probably more scary than The Haunting of Connecticut (which I watched the day after watching this.)  Natural disaster is far more scarier than paranormal I guess.

3603455,3,B001GCUNZI,"I was REALLY looking forward to seeing this movie...all the previews made it look downright awesome, and I gotta admit, for the first 90% of the film, it really was pretty great. Classic, taut supernatural thriller very well done. The special effects are on par with anything out these days--the plane crash was worth the price of admission alone, easy--but unfortunately, Hollywood has a problem with finding decent endings for otherwise decent films.

The opening was eeerrrie! As the school featured in the film was getting ready to close up a Time Capsule, one girl takes a little longer than the rest of the children writing down a note to be opened up and read 50 years later. She was SUPPOSED to be writing what she thinks the world will be like in the future...unfortnately, she is caught up into some trance-like state which takes over her and she ends up writing numbers, a seemingly endless string of random numbers on both sides of the paper, single-spaced. The teacher considers (briefly) leaving it out, but places it inside anyway. What we don't realize at that moment is she wasn't entirely finished writing when the teacher forcibly removed the paper from her hands. She is then compelled to finish writing the numbers elsewhere.

Jump ahead 50 years and the same school is celebrating the opening of the Time Capsule and before long, Nicolas Cage has our list of numbers, and after the initial surprise that he just so happens to ALSO be an MIT graduate in (shock) Math, he accidentally discovers a pattern (the accident of which made me groan slightly because of what I like to refer as, the 'Coincidence Factor')...he figures that each set of numbers refers to a date, an accident and the EXACT number of casualties. Some numbers in between take a bit longer to decipher, but being our dashing hero, he figures that out before long, too (it refers to the exact latitude and longitude of each disaster). Could this be possible? A mathematical genius could quickly calculate that it is quite literally impossible for ANY human to have the ability to predict the future with such pin-point accuracy. What is even more amazing is that there are a few numbers left that haven't as yet come to pass. Does our hero eventually come to KNOW and not just believe that they represent something that WILL happen no matter what? Well of COURSE he does.

Right at the end, the story takes on a Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull Sci-Fi twist that quite literally left me 100% flat. Enough to erase the 90% of the film I truly enjoyed...well almost. I won't spoil the absurd ending for you except to say this: I really, REALLY disliked it. You may have a different take on it altogether, but for MY $$, I walked out half thinking it was okay, and half thinking I had wasted my money.",1248048000,4,2804,4.672064777327935
3603456,2,B001GCUNZI,"This movie was predictable.  And, when it tried to shake things up, I though the storyline disappointed.

It seems like it didn't know what type of a movie it wanted to be.  It started by trying to be a thriller/drama that turned into an apocalyptic Sci-Fi movie (and a not very good one at that).  It failed as a drama because it never developed the characters enough to make you care about them.  The sci-fi elements were predictable.  I believe that the scene at the very end of the movie was added only because they wanted to add some special effects.  I'm all for special effects but not when they don't help advance the storyline.

Nick Cage was himself as usual and I am no big fan of his, but he is ok in this. Ok, him and his lady interest are the worst parents in the world constantly leaving the kids by themselves in cars and stuff whist they hunt for clues, meanwhile mysterious strangers are giving them pebbles. Which makes a change from sweets I suppose.

The trailer made this look so much better, and I felt let down after seeing the best bits, but I don't rate this as the worst film I have seen by a long chalk. It does feel like an M. Night Shyamalan film, and it is full of religious imagery, but I didn't see this as a recruitment film for Christianity, the religious element serving to act as a counterpoint to illustrate determinism versus entropy. And of course we are no nearer answering those questions, but I was entertained.

Spoiler alert. The world was not created in 7 days 5000 years ago, That is obvious nonsense. One can see how these ideas came about (evolved if you will), as our ancestors needed a model to explain the world about them and came up with the best guess they could at the time, all cultures have done this throughout history. Now we have scientific method to guide us, not perfectly, but at least we are looking logically at the world around us. If science reveals a unified ""theory of everything"", then we can have a nice argument about if this mathematical symmetry is due to the hand of a divine creator or just the laws of nature. But making the universe in 7 days. No.

3603494,3,B001GCUNZI,"""Knowing"" starts very promisingly. The introductory part about a little girl hearing voices is strong and spooky, told with atmospheric photography, suggesting that something terrible is going to happen. Then, in the film's equally powerful mid-section it does happen, twice, and these set-pieces (about a plane and a subway) are gripping and intense. However, things start to look wrong, even ridiculous, in the last 30 minutes, maybe as bad as the ending of one recent Keanu Reeves film.

The story of ""Knowing"" revolves around an MIT professor John Koestler (Nicholas Cage) and his recent discovery about the fate of the entire humans, which, encoded in numbers, has been hidden in a time capsule for 50 years. While he is obsessed with the idea, his son Caleb (Chandler Canterbury) starts to hear strange noises, see weird things (a moose on fire, for instance), and meet strangers.

""Knowing"" has several strong moments (greatly helped by its visuals), but the script (especially its final chapters) does not live up to the film's fairly interesting premise. The ideas which are at first intriguing start to sound ludicrous as the film goes on - why a time capsule in the first place? - and, what is worse, the film is predictable. Who are the men in black the boy encounters? You can guess the answer easily and by the time you know your answer is right, you wish it wasn't.

I enjoyed watching the film as thriller until the concluding chapters where things look out of control, trying to show as much as it can while ""less is more"" approach is more appropriate.

3603500,5,B001GCUNZI,"This is a surprisingly good movie!

It raises some fascinating issues and philosophical dilemmas within an unusual and unigue story line, incorporating philosophical questions about the future, the past, life on earth, life elsewhere, coincidence, fate, loss, predilection, faith and more.

Most importantly, it raises several age old questions: Why are we here? Is there a method to the madness? Is there a afterworld? Where do we go after we die? And, do we have a purpose? IF so, what is it?

STORY
Nicholas Cage portrays a professor of astrophysics at MIT who comes across a mysterious piece of paper written by an ""unusual"" little girl in the past. He is both tormented and intrigued by issues raised by the paper's implications.

He and his young son are soon immersed in perplexing adventures involving strange chains of events, mysterious strangers, astounding coincidences, galactic intercession and solar planetary repercussions. Fascinating.

It had some excellent special effects, good story line, good acting by both Nicholas and his young ""son,"" excellent one-liners and much more.

The movie has adventure, science fiction, psychological intrigue, mystery, emotion, disaster, all tied together with Cage's cagey and intense acting. He seems to give us his all, as usual.

Plenty of attention is paid to detail and science - evidently the writer consulted with an array of scientific and medical professionals and it shows.

I paticularly love one of the first scenes with Nicholas teaching his class at MIT. He raises a rather interesting question in an interesting way... The movie then goes on to attempt to illustrate a response.

Not to give anything away, but this question raised by Nicholas deals with fate, purpose, the beyond.

All in all, a surprisingly engrossing and entertaining movie.

(If you're sensitive to disaster / apocalyptic type movies, then this may be a bit over the top... but for sheer thinkability and entertainment, it does the trick : )

A philosophical note: Is it all in the ""knowing?"" In other words, knowing something may not be as important as believing you know something... because in the end, do we ever really know about destiny, the forever, fate, coincidence, the future, life after death?

But, once we believe we know, that's all we need...

Another phonomenal movie that MUSN'T BE MISSED:

CONTACT with Jody Foster and Matthew McConaughey
http://www.amazon.com/Contact-Jodie-Foster/dp/0790733226

CONTACT is probably one of the finest science fiction movies ever made. It raises probably the most important and relevant to our situation today.

CONTACT was written by the great physicist, Carl Sagan. This is probably why it's one of the most intelligent movies ever written.

At one time, didn't appreciate the question posed by the movie. But, today, older, smarter and wiser, I can see that the question is the most important question we have today.

I don't want to have a spoiler here, so will review the movie CONTACT, and in my SECOND review will discuss this question.

Jody Foster and Matthew McConnaughy are phenomenal - he's never been more charming, she is totally believable as a linear PhD astronomer. You cannot help but love them both...

One last note regarding Nicholas Cage... this movie, ""KNOWING"" is his greatest. (Subjective viewpoint i know!  ) It's so tightly done, wound and coiled so neatly and cleanly with scientific, philosophical and human intrugue. And his character goes through the gamut of emotions, from drinking, loving, caring, not caring, raging, fearing, dreading, and finally, but last but not least, knowing.",1247875200,3,3608,5.227430555555555
3603501,2,B001GCUNZI,"Expectations quickly declined when I saw Hollywood's depiction of M.I.T. students and further declined when the prof gave a lecture that was more at an advanced middle school science or high school science level of discussion.

And of course they drive around in cars, hide in the woods and transform into energy somethings when desired.

There are a few other predictions yet future, and most of the film is consumed with his efforts to stop them from happening.

3603516,4,B001GCUNZI,"Besides Roger Ebert,  who awarded the film 4 stars, people haven't been to kind to Knowing. Perhaps it's the presence of Nicolas Cage, a true love him or hate him actor. The fact that there is a spiritual theme may have contributed to audience indifference. Whatever the case, I did not have high hopes for Knowing. What I saw surprised me.

A quick, vague synopsis does not do the film justice, but Cage plays John, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His son Caleb's elementary school exhumes a time capsule buried 50 years previously and Caleb is given a mysterious list of numbers. After noticing 9/11/01 on the list, John discovers that the numbers are the dates and death tolls of world disasters of the last 50 years, with a few more on the way.

That's all I want to say about the plot, but there's also Diana (Rose Byrne), the daughter of the girl who made the list, who becomes involved in John's plight. And, who could forget, the mysterious blonde men who begin appearing to Caleb.

I need to clarify immediately that Knowing is not perfect. I have a few complaints; one being the convoluted script. First of all, I'm pretty sure that list missed a few dates, right? Secondly, the mysterious blonde guys are certainly not the most original idea and it becomes clear what their purpose is early on. While this didn't stick, I didn't find them particularly ominous in the beginning. Finally, Cage's performance seems at once inspired and then will turn wooden without warning. There are a few scenes that should've required him to do more takes (or perhaps less). Particularly embarrassing was him yelling ""you want some of this?"" before hitting a tree with a baseball bat.

However with the bad comes the good. The visual effects in this movie are very impressive. The plane crash scene is horrifying and much of the last 20 minutes or so are incredibly impressive. Not just impressive, but also horrifyingly realistic. I haven't seen any other films by director Alex Proyas, but he's obviously a very talented, visually creative director.

Mind-blowing visual effects aside, I also found Knowing to be a genuinely exciting, suspenseful, and thrilling movie...Something that surprised me considering how rejected it's been by audiences. This is not a typical blockbuster science-fiction film though, so I guess it's not all that shocking.

The best advice I can give to someone who is planning on seeing the film is, simply, watch it with an open mind. It's no masterpiece and I doubt you'll expect what it offers. Knowing is a dark, spiritually-themed science-fiction film. It's entertaining, affecting, and beautifully made. Make no mistake about it, however; this is not a happy movie.

3603523,4,B001GCUNZI,"Cage turns in a Cage performance, which you either like or don't. I like it. I liked him in National Treasure because he's smart, understated, and inherently a good guy trying to do good things. His character is a bit more tortured here, but it's the same essential style. The other characters mostly worked as well. (The children's acting, in my opinion, wasn't quite believable, but then considering their age, you can't complain.)

The special effects are great. When bad things happen, they happen in grand style. Between the special effects and the acting, the story moves along well, and does a good job of asking you to contemplate how knowing certain events would change either the events, or who and what you are. On that level, it's a great movie.

The ending, sadly, is seriously over the top. But for a $3 rental I'm not complaining.

(Spoilers are happening here, because I want to rebut a few reviewer's comments.)

If you've read Arthur C Clarke's ""Childhood's End"", you have this movie in a nutshell. The plot isn't identical, but the central idea is: mankind gets toasted, but aliens save some children and bring them to a better world. The end. The only real difference is that in Clarke's version, the aliens are largely responsible for the earth's end; in this movie, it's presumably not their fault. Even the mental telepathy element is an echo from Clarke's story, as is the idea of prophecy. The only amusing twist is that Clarke has the aliens resemble devils in appearance, and here, of course, they look like angels. If Clarke was around, I think he'd have grounds to sue over this movie. Given that he only died a year before this film came out, it has the slightly creepy feel of someone just waiting for him to kick off so they could steal his basic idea without interference. Add a pinch of Zelazny's ""Flare"" and you have the whole plot.

I find it amusing that someone here ranted about how this was an ""Intelligent Design propaganda film."" If this was, so was ""2001 - A Space Odessey"" - and if anything, 2001 is even more so, because that book and movie spell out clearly that aliens directly meddled with human evolution. Later in Clarke's writing, he ties the aliens to religious belief. It was one of Clarke's themes. I can only assume that whoever made that comment doesn't know much about science fiction, and the rich tradition it has of aliens interfering with humanity's upbringing.

Besides, most intelligent design proponents are Christians. How many Christians are going to happily put up with the idea that angels are really aliens in spaceships? The claim of propaganda absolutely doesn't wash.

As for this being a spiritual film, as some others have said, I suppose it depends on how you define it. For me, that aspect of the movie failed badly. Here you have compelling evidence that these aliens (angels presumably don't need spacecraft to get around, so calling them outright angels just doesn't work for me) are behind the Ezekiel vision (that's not a new idea either), and at least some amount of prophecy. The only conclusion you can get to, watching this film, is that religion (at least Judiasm and Christianity) has it wrong, and is really only a confused misunderstanding of what these aliens are about. That's not a very spiritual conclusion. Admittedly, a bunch of aliens who can absolutely foretell the future across 3,000+ years, as these guys clearly can, are more or less God-surrogates for any story's purposes. But that doesn't make this story religious; nearly the opposite.

As for the story itself... Childhood's End hung together pretty well. This movie doesn't. The aliens could have dispensed with the 50 years of prophecy thing entirely, and scooped up the children they wanted at any time. A little telepathy, a spaceship, and explanation that the world is about to burn... that would probably be more than convincing enough. The whole psychic/foretelling angle made a great story hook, but it should have been the hook for a different story.

Also, Cage's character finds his faith in the end... after a dramatic demonstration that faith is a story about aliens. Huh? That made no sense to me whatsoever. It's nice to see a film that treats religion with a tiny bit of dignity, but the only religions that really work with this film are scientology, and even that's a stretch.

Finally, the epic scene near the end, of a wall of flame wiping out cities... it was very dramatic, but it was poor science. The film managed to offend against science and religion, at points, while trying (I think?) to nod and be friendly to both.

Fun story, though, and that's all I personally was after when I rented it. Take it for a fun detective story with an over the top ending; a sort of B movie with A+ effects.",1247616000,5,4774,4.753623188405797
3603524,3,B001GCUNZI,"There is no question this movie is watchable with plenty of mystery and action in it.  The idea of the time capsule being dug up with a mysterious paper filled with numbers that predict disasters was pretty good, especially after we start witnessing the disasters and the helplessness of Nicholas Cage's character trying to alter the predictions.  This was done well and seemed to be working towards a great ending.  On a side note, when they noticed the letters EE in place where numbers should have been in the code, I knew what it meant right away.  I don't know why it took the cast so long to figure out the meaning.  Anyway, what ruined this film for me was ***SPOILER ALERT*** the intervention of aliens.  As I watched the movie, much like as I watched THE FORGOTTEN, I was thinking to myself: ""Please don't be space aliens.  Don't ruin this film with space aliens!  Find a way to wrap it up without resorting to the old cliche of space aliens""  Well, it was space aliens.  Gosh, how about an original idea for a change?  This was so lame.  Not only was the idea tired but the execution of the idea with the ethereal figures taking the children up to the ship (think 'Logan's Run' and the LASTDAY event.) It worked in 'Logan's Run'. It didn't work here.  There were some nice things in this movie.  The plane crash was done well as was the subway crash.  The truck slamming into the Jeep Grand Cherokee was awesome.  This movie had greatness written all over it for the first hour.  I read another review that said Nicholas Cage was just doing the same character he did in the two National Treasure movies.  That's pretty much right, but I still think he gives a pretty good performance.  The bottom line here is that this movie is watchable and some (maybe many) people will find it a great film.  I just feel that it could have been much more and that the writers just opted for an easy way out to get a story done, rather than actually think about and create a real killer ending.",1247616000,,1990,4.429752066115703
3603525,4,B001GCUNZI,"I thought this was a very interesting movie. The special effects were well done, but didn't overshadow the story. I think it's great that the ending kind of leaves it up to the viewer to draw their own conclusions. Not very many movies make me want to go online to see what other people are saying about it and see how they interpret the ending. With most of the shallow movies that pass for sci-fi these days I think it's great that a movie opens itself up to so much discussion. I'm also glad the movie didn't take the easy way out with a ""hero saves the day"" approach. This movie makes me think of ""A.I.Artificial Intelligence"" by Steven Spielberg in that it's not necessarily a happy, feel-good movie, but at the end you can't stop thinking about it. I appreciate that there are directors out there who are willing to take a chance on turning off some viewers by offering up something besides sci-fi eye candy (Michael Bay, I'm talking to you)and giving us something to think about. To anyone trying to decide whether or not to give this movie a chance, I would say even if you don't like the ending it will be better than most of the movies that pass for sci-fi these days!",1247616000,,1178,4.408256880733945
3603556,5,B001GCUNZI,"Any time a viewer goes to the movies, he or she brings her own personal experiences, belief system, self-identity--all the things that make us who we are. One set of beliefs this particular film, ""Knowing,"" addresses is spirituality. Another is the age-old debate: Is the Earth determined by randomness or is its course affected by determinism? ""Knowing"" definitely offers a conclusion.

An amazing thing--to me--is the negative reaction that films and books receive if their theme concerns spirituality, particularly established religion, and specifically Christianity. Just what happened in these lives to make religion so untenable and negative? Though not in-your-face blatant, ""Knowing"" is definitely a movie threaded with Christian theology.

Nicholas Cage is a college professor of physics at M.I.T. The important lecture the viewer is privy to is a review of the long-standing, unanswerable debate involving the theories of determinism and randomness. Was the earth deliberately set into motion, or did it just happen? At one point, done through subtle directing, Cage's character is a religious believer--after all, he grew up in a home in which his father is a pastor. But there is a schism between them now caused by the death of Cage's wife in a catastrophic hotel fire. Why? Cage has no answer other than to let his religious beliefs expire.

Since then Cage has languished during his private time, relying on alcohol to appease his loss-stricken soul. The premise of this film is to show the reaction and spiritual evolution of one human when faced with a final eschatology.

But getting there includes the viewer in this trek to the truth. We watch Lucinda, an important early character, concertedly write a series of numbers, front and back on a blank sheet of drawing paper, in a 1950's classroom. She is responding to the teacher's instruction: Draw what the Earth will look like in fifty years. These drawings will be placed in a time capsule, to be opened in fifty years. Fifty years later Nicholas Cage's son draws the numbered sheet. He too begins to hear the Whispering Ones. Through a determined act? a random one? Cage's character begins an exploration of the shocking meaning of these numbers. Are you seeing the thread being woven before you?

Reaching the final scene of the film is much like opening a Chinese puzzle box. The final solution--the final truth--lies inside the last box. This final truth is not included in biblical literature except through suggested possibility. Cage's last scene shows he has definitely returned to the beliefs of his father. Again, the spirituality of the film is definite, but not smashingly presented. I have merely picked up those threads to present in this review. Back in context, they are much less noticeable.

As for Nicholas Cage: He is not my favorite actor, although I like most of his work. In my humble opinion this role is his best and one he approaches quietly and thoughtfully. Cage does not overact (as he tends to). His sobbing scene is so genuinely acted, he had me sobbing with him. I like this Nicholas Cage--this subtlety he brings to the role. He ""gets"" the premise of the film. Because I would have labeled Cage a Hollywood type in political and religious beliefs, his acceptance of this role and his portrayal of it really are surprising and even astonishing.

""Knowing"" is a film of questions and an answer. Is it the answer you bring to your viewing? That answer probably will determine whether or you like the film.",1247616000,2,3507,4.984615384615385

_______________________________________________________________________

I realized I was watching Dianetics by L. Ron Hubbard!  This was a commercial for Scientology!  Now before anyone starts in with the ""YOU FULL OF ITs"" out there, hear me out!

All I have to say is Xenu--you Scientologists can explain it if you want.  This movie had Nic Cage (Scientologist) in it--although it could have had Tom Cruise, John Travolta, etc as the leading man and the message would have been the same, and maaaaaaaybe get judged a little harsher (Ahhhhhhhem,,,Battlefield Earth)!  But it has all the trappings of a Scientolgy meeting!

There are some reviewers on here that would have you believe that this is a movie about God, Christianity, or ""Intelligent Design."" However, this movie is based strictly from the mind of L. Ron Hubbard!  From his OT II teachings, Hubbard believed that 75 Million years ago, Earth was seeded by alien (sound familiar).  If you have seen this movie, then it should sound VERY familiar!  The only ID mentioned is SEEDING, a form concocted by scientists to replace the existence of a Higher Power.  So you want more....here ya go:

Facts:

""Knowing"" means Scientology according to their beliefs...

Lucinda's character in the movie is born in 1952( the year of Scientology creation).

Nicholas Cage is a confirmed Scientologist.

Aliens bringing humans to start a new world is how humans got to earth (as Scientology believes).

If you want to get pumped full of propoganda of the Scientology form, then this is the movie for you!

If you get angry about aliens seeding a planet and spreading the human race across the far reaches of the universe, then you might want to look elsewhere...

And if you think this movie is an undercover attempt by Christians to spread ID, 1) do the research, 2) Know what you are arguing, and 3) realize that Christians don't make God to be an Alien Race!!!!!!!",1247529600,22,2057,4.956140350877193
3603559,4,B001GCUNZI,"[SPOILERS] By no means was this was movie as sophisticated as ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" and it had a lot of plot holes, but it was still a good flick. In the tradition of movies like ""Stargate,"" this movie manages to include several mythological elements - specifically Biblical references, without being too preachy or religious: Ezekiel's Vision, the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, Adam and Eve and the Tree of Life. It does make you think.

Furthermore, ""Knowing"" maintained a sense of urgency, and the ending was interesting because no one ends up saving the world like they do in just about every other disaster movie ever made.

To D. M. She, the the person who criticised the movie for not foreshadowing important events: There was plenty of foreshadowing, some of it subtle, some of it quite explicit. You just weren't paying attention.
1. John discusses the sun with his students (and later with his colleague) - foreshadows the solar flair.
2. The museum Diana and John visit features a variety of extinct animals, foreshadowing future extinctions.
3. The name of Caleb's school is ""William Dawes,"" a horse rider who warned minutemen of an impending invasion.
4. Diana finds a ceramic angel that she crafted for mother - foreshadows the arrival of the angels.
5. The picture of Ezekiel's Vision hanging in Lucinda's trailer is a direct reference to the alien ship.

In any case, foreshadowing (or the lack of it) is not indicator of how good a movie is.",1247529600,8,1464,4.848
3603560,3,B001GCUNZI,"The first 45 minutes of this film was worth the money spent to view it.  It begins as a taut Sherlock Holmes mystery filled with some dynamite special effects.  The crashing of a large jet passenger plane outdoes the plane crash scene in Cast Away.  Sadly, there was no way to explain the strange happenings without employing a very dissatisfying ending.  When all was said and done, no explanation was given for anything that happened.  Why was the child that started the circle of events chosen to do so?  Why was it necessary for Nicholas Cage to figure out the meaning of the list of numbers?  What good did it do?  It seems that the mysterious strangers had power enough to eliminate the need for all the hard work.  They actually eliminated the need for the making of this movie.  Watch it until the plane crash, fast forward to the special effects showing the total destruction scenes.  You may think the movie wasn't bad at all.",1247443200,,936,4.578313253012048
3603561,1,B001GCUNZI,"I am amazed that people actually liked this movie.  My dislike for this movie has nothing to do with my feelings for any of the actors or my taste in movies.  I'm a well rounded person and enjoy movies from all genres.  This genre is one of my favorites which is probably why I was so disppointed.  Nic Cage's acting skills have just gone so far down the tubes.  I have no idea how he went from being such a great actor to stuff like this.  It's like he (to use the phrase) phoned in his performance.  This movie is so ridden with cliches and Nic's acting is just horrendous.  And it's all too easy with how things come together.  The ending was preposterous at best.  The special effects were amazing though, it just didn't have a good script or movie to go with it.  I love this genre though and was really hoping for this movie to be great.  It was disappointing as ""The Happening.""  The only reason I didn't turn it off was because I wanted to see how they would wrap it all up.  Largely unsatisfying.

****SPOILER ALERT****
They never explain who the blonde mute people really are.  We get it, they're aliens who've come to take these two children away.  And they are obviously supposed to be the new Adam & Eve....complete with the tree of life, but where did they go?  Is it a new earth?  And if they mutes took them there, why do they need these two children to repopulate this other planet?  Also...longitude and latitude are very specific.  So when Nic's character finds the exact spot where a disaster was supposed to happen and then he goes away from the spot and gets on a train and rides away and then the disaster happens, he's no longer at the original place where the disaster was supposed to happen.  Again, just disappointing.",1247443200,12,1745,4.4043887147335425
3603562,4,B001GCUNZI,"Based upon the trailers, I thought this was going to be a movie along the line of ""National Treasure"" with puzzles to solve and clues to follow. While there is that element, it was much more weighted toward the thriller/sci fi aspect that I expected. Even though it was different, I still thoroughly enjoyed the movie and kept my attention during the entire two hours. It was very intense!

Nicholas Cage does these kinds of roles exceptionallly well and I thought he was perfect for this role. The rest of the cast is good and I appreciated that the woman in the movie wasn't just a dumb blonde sterotype -- she actually added interest and intrique (who also happened to be a brunette).

Good thriller, good escapist movie, fun on a Saturday night !",1247443200,,750,4.58955223880597
3603563,4,B001GCUNZI,"My mom and I decided to download this on my apple TV. Me, her, my step dad and step brother watched it. What I liked about it was that it seemed to be like a sci-fi movie from the 80s. Not sure why. It also seemed like it all took place in a small town. Which it did not. It just felt like a good movie to watch on a Saturday night.

The movie is about a man whoes sons class gets to each take a picture that was drawn 50 years ago by the students of their school. They were told to draw a picture of what they thought the fuiture would look like. Then they put it in a metal thing and put it in the ground under a mark showing where it was. Well the kids all got there picture but the mans son gets something different. He gets a paper that has a list of numbers. The boy brings it home (though he was not supposed to) and the man sees it and looks at it. He comes to realize that the numbers are dates. Dates of major disasters that would happen. Then he realizes that their are two dates that are yet to come. He decided to try and stop the things from happening. Can he do it?

That is as much as I can say without giving to much away. The movie kind of goes in to religion. Well, I think it does. I don't think people who are super religious would like this movie. Even people who just believe in God may not like it. Just remember though, it's only a movie.  In the end, someone who believes in nothing, may come to believe in everything.

The movie was 2 hours and 2 minutes. Some of the stuff that happened was really stupid and seemed pointless. Also, sometimes, stuff would just drag on and on and on. This didn't really bother me though, because the story was so neat. The actors did a really good job as wello. I was really impressed by the young boy who played the son.

I must say though, that this is a sad movie. I mean VERY sad. I mean sometimes stuff happens in movies that makes you tear up. But this.... wow. I guess you could look at in as being good as well, because..... I don't want to say why. But sometimes endings are the key to new beginnings.",1247356800,2,2071,3.9927536231884058

3603565,3,B001GCUNZI,"Nicolas Cage isn't really my cup of tea. If I end up seeing a film with him in it, it's more because of the intriguing plot premise rather than that Cage is starring in it. And, often, I see a movie in spite of his being in it. Regarding KNOWING, its sci-fi hook is what made me want to go check it out in its theatrical release. Stupid me. Later on I actually got mad that a friend gave me the DVD to this movie.

KNOWING has been praised some, panned a lot. The f/x is sometimes quite stunning; the plot is certainly high concept, providing plenty of talking points for armchair theologians and philosophers. There's no denying that the film starts off very promisingly, the prologue instantly drawing you into its ominous mood. In 1959 a little girl with tormented eyes intently scribbles random numbers on a sheet of paper, this to be her contribution for her elementary school project, a time capsule to be buried and dug up fifty years later. In 2009, astrophysics professor John Koestler ends up with the cypher and to his horror learns that it predicts global disasters, with respective locations and body counts encoded. Even worse, there are dates still set in the near future, and that the final date may spell the end of the world. This is pretty ideal for Nicolas Cage's style of mannered, on-edge, semi-creepy acting. And to coax him to even more over-the-top lengths, his character also happens to be presently suffering a crisis of faith. It's been a while since Restrained Performance and Nicolas Cage had been on speaking terms. When Koestler's kid asks him, ""Don't you think you're acting... kind of awkward today?"" - I halfway expected the response to be ""'Cause I'm Nicolas Cage, baby!""

Determinism or randomness: which of these forces fuel our lives? Do we really control our fates, or does everything run on some sort of metaphysical schedule? This topic is a source of lecture for Professor Koestler, but the film right away informs you as to which corner it's in. But raising an abstract subject matter doesn't an intelligent picture make, not when other elements in the movie fall apart. But the good things, first. I have no problem with how the film ended, or rather its overarcing concept. It's certainly a change from how movies of this sort usually finish up, and that's fine. I don't even mind that there's an echo here of that religious spirituality made eloquent in SIGNS. The special effects are pretty good, I thought. There are three main f/x sequences, all nicely rendered, with the first one being quite spectacular. As mentioned, the sci-fi hook pulls you in, and the suspense builds and builds, up to a point, before it collapses into silly buggers.

It's the connective tissue which falters; it's the messed-up niggling little things which softly pounds on you like water torture. It's been a while since I saw the movie in the theater, but off the top of my head:

- In the face of irrefutable evidence, why do supposedly clever people persist in adamantly discounting it? I guess a case could be given that the apocalyptic alternative is so frightening that the only recourse is to deny, deny, deny. But numbers don't lie, brother.

- And if the cipher was placed so as to prepare the way for the end of the world, why was it buried for all those years and then dug up only in time to warn of two catastrophes before the big one? Seems to me, that's a pissspoor way of preparing anyone.

- The film goes to the well so often with the mysterious figures in the woods (the Whisper People) that the impact is soon lost.

- When a guy on fire runs screaming past Nicolas Cage, our hero's reaction is to yell out ""Hey! HEY!"" - and then move on.

- I hate to dump on kids, but the kid actor who plays Cage's son is stiff and annoying. Lovely Rose Byrne was welcome on the screen, until she got too shrill later on (I know, I know, who wouldn't be shrill when the end of the world is nigh); and I've already mentioned my feelings on Cage's performance. I wish, though, that more screen time were given to Lara Robinson, who is so effective as the haunted little girl Lucinda Embry and, later, Lucinda's granddaughter Abby.

- The nod to CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND is not appreciated.

- With other films already having done so, maybe it's not too soon to start using 9/11 as a plot device, but, still, I couldn't help but kind of resent it.

- Unlike this movie, I hope that looting isn't our automatic response to learning that the world is going to end.

- And why the black pebbles again?

- SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS in the next few sentences: With the grown-ups not getting the governor's pardon, the film's closing shot reveals the children who were saved by extraterrestrials disembarking on a brave new world, ostensibly to make a fresh start for the human race. But didn't the extra-terrestrials read LORD OF THE FLIES or maybe GONE? It doesn't bode well for the future of humanity...

For those curious enough, the DVD's Special Features include: Director Alex Proyas's audio commentary; ""Knowing All: the Making of a Futuristic Thriller"" (almost 13 minutes long); and ""Visions of the Apocalypse"" (17 minutes) which explores apocalyptic signs and numerology and other related material, including how badly the sun can eff us up should things go seriously wrong.

Ending on a positive note, I will say that I liked this one enough to rate it 2.5 out of 5 stars. I think it's better than that remake of THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL or 23, that other underwhelming film about numerology. And, on a general cinematic level, it's heaps better than SON OF THE MASK.

This film started out strong and then dove into typical sci-fi with hints of sinister stalker films.  After the concept of the numbers was abandoned for out-of-this-world plot, the film lost some of the required ""suspension of disbelief.""

The concept of a series of numbers predicting disasters was intriguing until the plot changed.  Some may say that the numbers had to come from somewhere or some source, and I understand that.  The source of the numbers, once revealed, left a lot to be desired in my opinion.

Some of the effects are very good, and a few of the scenes are pretty intense, but in the end the characters accomplish not one single thing, and the events of the film take a course of their own and leave the players behind.  The worst part of the movie, as my girlfriend and I are discovering after having finished watching this horrible film less than an hour ago, is that the events of the film are proven so meaningless by the ending that we now sit wishing they had saved their Sci-Fi FX budget for something more worthy and instead drew up a short closer to the lines of the original ""Bambi Meets Godzilla"" cartoon (Google that if you aren't already wearing a knowing smile).  Please believe me, more was accomplished in the cartoon that in the entire film of ""Knowing"".  And the more we sit discussing the film, the more we wish we could get those two hours of our lives back.

Unlike her classmates, one introverted young girl who also came up with the suggestion, creates a list of seemingly random numbers. When the capsule is unearthed, her contribution is given to Caleb (Chandler Canterbury), son of astrophysicist John Koestler (Nicolas Cage).  Through a series of events, Koestler comes to discover the numbers are not random but rather a list of dates, fatalities and locations for a range of disasters that have occurred over the ensuing half-century.  As a scientist, Koestler has doubts regarding the rationality of belief in omniscience and the premise of determinism, with his questioning exacerbated by the loss of his spouse in a hotel fire a year earlier and estrangement from his pastor father.

Over the course of the two hour movie, Koestler, his son and eventually, the daughter and granddaughter of list's creator are confronted by a smattering of eerie events and the inability to circumvent the realization of other disasters on the dates and locations noted on the list.

It occurred to me I'm not sure I have ever encountered a movie or book as difficult to review without imposition of spoilers because this movie, once one reflects on all of the symbolism and hints provided early on turned out the only way it could have, as an exposition on the implications of faith and science with the science fiction components only serving as devices to attract an audience but in reality easily dispensable appendages to the story line.

There is mystery and suspense with just enough special effects to maintain one's attention for most of the movie, certainly up to the last half-hour or so when the course of events, predestined by earlier scenes, becomes a tad tiresome, especially for those who may not subscribe to any of the religious precepts the movie strives to convey. It is a movie that could instigate philosophical/theological discussions of its' higher concepts but in the attempt to meld science fiction and a multiplicity of religions, viewers expecting emphasis on the former may exit uninspired.",1247270400,8,2255,5.083783783783784

By now you are thinking that this is one of those second rate formula prediction of the end of the world sci-fi movies. Any censure correct. However, there is a lot more to this movie. Many underlying stories and psychological problems. Not those namby-pamby psychological problems of today, but universal problems between people. There are enough twists and turns in this leads to dead-end alleys in this film to hold the most ardent sci-fi or mystery reader. This film is definitely time well spent.

Just a quick note for those that are enamored in Blu-Ray; the action and color and sound you are looking for you will find in this film. Even though this was designed to be a psychological thriller the director purposely made sure that, we receive plenty of action and color and sound.

3603643,5,B001GCUNZI,"Why read this first? Because hopefully there are no spoilers here. In so many of the reviews for this movie, as well as others on Amazon, people seemed compelled to give a total synopsis of the movie all the way up to the end -- especially if they didn't like the movie.  It's like if they didn't care for it, then nobody else needs to see it. Well, I'm glad that I didn't read any of the reviews here before watching KNOWING because I enjoyed not knowing and being able to decide for myself.  And my opinion is that KNOWING is a very fine movie.

The previews tell you what you need to know:  A time capsule which contains school children's drawings about what they think things will be like in 50 years is opened in the present day. An astrophysicist (Nicholas Cage)gets hold of one submission which is a lengthy series of numbers. He discovers that the numbers predict future disasters, most which have happened, but a few that are still to come.  His mission becomes to avert the disasters. There-- that's all you need to know about the story, now sit back and enjoy the movie.

Here's what I am knowing:
1)  If you hate Nicholas Cage you will hate the movie.
2)  If you are a total science fiction geek you may not like this film as for me it was more spiritual than scifi.
3)  If you don't like spiritual things, don't like God or the Bible, or don't want to be thinking about anything like this then you should stay away from the movie.
4)  If major disasters are something you don't want to watch a movie about then this one is not for you.
5)  If you prefer mindless comedy or romance, Knowing probably won't be at the top of your list.
6)  This was my kind of movie-- I was thrilled, entertained, and uplifted in the end.  I rented it, but I will probably want to add this to my collection.",1247270400,629,1800,4.289940828402367

Because, the aliens at the end of the movie went too out of their way to get the kids. All they had to do is take the kids in the middle of the night and start over. Not like the kids would remember, it seemed as if their minds were erased when they got to their new homeworld. Of course Nic Cage would still be the messed up & doubting guy he is at the beginning, but I found his personal journey weighing down the movie anyways. So instead, the underrated I-Robot director Alex Proyas throws numbers in there, and disasters. But all of it is for naught at the end, so it kind of seems pointless. Again, the film tries to ask these deep questions about philosophy, but again, the movie's questions are worth thinking about the way they are posed here. So it's again pointless.

But don't worry, if you like prolonged and lingering shots of people and animals burning alive, you've come to the right place. If you like shots of people getting crushed by subway cars, then this is your movie. If you like shots of the end of the world overlaid by inappropriately joyful classical music, then this is the movie for you. If I wanted all that, I could have watched Final Destination, but ""Knowing"" thinks its way better than it is, and it disappointingly falters under its own weight. Also, you should probably be off world, or at least on the other side of the world when a solar flare strikes Earth. Those things are a b**ch!",1247270400,2,2096,4.399484536082475
3603645,3,B001GCUNZI,"Knowing starts out strong, with a '50s era flashback to a creepy kid obsessed with numbers, that also serves to remind us that this film is aiming for something of a '50s science fiction vibe.  As part of the opening ceremony for a new elementary school, kids put pictures of the future into a time capsule, with plans to open it up 50 years later.  The creepy dark-haired girl puts her list of seemingly random numbers into the mix, along with the crayon drawings produced by the rest of the kids.

Fifty years later, of course, Nick Cage plays a single father and MIT astrophysicist whose belief in providence was shaken by the death of his wife.  When the time capsule is opened, and his son gets the numbers, and as he comes to see what the numbers mean, it becomes apparent that even senseless tragedy may not be simply random.  Alex Proyas channels&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Close-Encounters-of-the-Third-Kind/dp/B000VECAD0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a>&nbsp;for a number of plot elements and for a religious sense of mystery that drives the film, but aims less for a sense of wonder as dread, until things start to get silly.  Still, it's a fun ride and well worth watching, and comes to a satisfying finish.

In what follows I won't give away the end, but may say too much for some, so if you don't want spoilers, stop reading .... The creepy atmosphere of uncertainty and dread that director Alex Proyas sets up to begin with gradually gives way to hokey and predictable developments as, in classic Hollywood style, Cage's scientist and his personal and family dramas become perfect microcosms of events of cosmic significance.  Where saving the world and falling in love and reconciling with family and healing old wounds all come to amount to the same thing.  My wife and I could not help but laugh out loud as Nick Cage promised his son with utter sincerity that he wouldn't let anything happen to him - even as it had just been proven to him beyond reasonable doubt that he had no power to prevent the calamities the mysterious numbers were predicting.  Or when Rose Byrne's character, faced with the destruction of the world (including herself and her daughter) explains how devastated she would be without her daughter if the upcoming disaster causes them to be separated, and Nick's character nods, knowing exactly how she feels.  Of course, and the thing that would really get me most about my entire city (including myself and my entire family and everyone around me) being destroyed in a nuclear explosion is that I'd miss my dog and be sad about being separated from my wife and kids.

And what about the numbers?  Apparently supernatural beings wanted to warn us about impending disasters by revealing the numbers to a young girl.  Of course, that didn't help much when the numbers ended up in a time capsule for the duration of most of the disasters.  I guess the girl who knew them lived long enough to let others know about them, but they thought she was crazy.  Still, even those who knew about  and wanted to avert the predicted disasters were unable to change their fate - so what was the point of a bunch of pale supernatural beings sitting around watching to be sure the kids made the right predictions if they couldn't do anything about it?  Perhaps, I guess, to convince them that the final prophecy was real and so they should go along?  Why not just explain things to the kids, since clearly they were able to?  It might make sense if somehow the plot established that their only means of communication was through numbers, but that's not the case, as revealed in the course of things.  There's a lot here that doesn't make a lot of sense, except as a way of tying some kind of voodoo fascination with numerology to an apocalyptic scenario.

Still, I have to say, in spite of the eventual goofiness as the film became overly melodramatic, it was a lot of fun to watch, and had a satisfying end.  In some ways the hokey elements add to the appeal - it's like watching '50s science fiction, where the wild implausibility combined with the seriousness of the characters gives just the right balance of melodrama and intensity to keep you on the edge of your seats and smiling.  Proyas manages to keep the characters interesting, and has a strong visual sense both for creating a vivid atmosphere in the ""ordinary"" moments and for creating extraordinarily convincing scenes of destruction.  I'm not sure what is his fascination with pale ""watcher"" type villians - since if you look at all his films that's what they are, from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-City/dp/B0018O4YT0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark City</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Robot/dp/B00005JN0T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I, Robot</a>&nbsp;(note the similarity of the robots to the scary types in this film) - I can't remember&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Crow/dp/6304765231/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Crow</a>&nbsp;well enough to say if it fits there as well (I saw it in theaters when it first came out, and that was a long time ago).

3603646,1,B001GCUNZI,"Last night I watched Knowing. Don't. Avoid at all costs. I was curious, and it was only $1 at the redbox, so I went against better judgement and said what the heck thinking if it was horrible, I'd just shut it off. Well, it wasn't horrible until the very end, so it keeps you hanging on hoping there's something more to it AND THERE ISN'T!

Here's the WHOLE story, so don't read ahead if you don't want it spoiled.

In the 50's there's some little girl at a school that hears voices that tell her things. She writes down all these numbers they tell her on a piece of paper. Her whole class sticks things in a time capsule and the teacher grabs this note from the girl as her ""contribution"". Fast forward 50 years to present day and the current same grade class at that school opens up the time capsule and each kid in the new class looks at one thing from the old class.

Cage's son gets the note with all the numbers. Cage is a drunk cause his wife died a year earlier but he's also some kind of super smart MIT professor, yeah right I know. He sees the numbers and figures out that all the numbers refer to dates, locations, and number of people killed in big events for the last 50 years.

Then his son starts hearing these voices also. He tracks down the daughter of the lady who wrote the numbers down in the 50's and her daughter is also hearing these voices. So first he tries to stop a couple of the events from happening with no luck, and then he figures out that the last numbers she wrote probably mean the end of the earth.

Then he ""remembers"" how he did some study on how some super flare from the sun could wipe out all life on earth, and as the weather there had been getting hotter and hotter recently, wonders if all this is connected. Wow huh? What an amazing (sarcastic) coincidence that all this just happens to line up for this moronic story?

Well anyways, turns out the whispers the son and daughter were hearing were from these strange ""whisper men"" who they see following them around and in the end the son and daughter are taken by those men who turn out to be aliens up into a spaceship so they can help repopulate the earth after it's destroyed the NEXT DAY by the solar flair. Turns out there's all kinds of these aliens all over the world scooping up a select few people and also animals and stuff to be ""saved"". Very Noah's Ark I know.

So the sun does it's thing and everything on the earth's surface is spectacularly vaporized. So there's no point to any of it.

And if you think about it, the whole thing doesn't make any darn sense anyways. The whispering aliens said only those who heard their call could leave on the space ships, ok, so then explain to me how the child 50 years before was hearing their voices when things weren't to be over for 50 more years? If she hadn't lost her mind and killed herself from the 50 years of whispers in her head would they have also taken her?

Oh my gosh I can't believe I wasted 2 hours watching that stupidity. I know people have different opinions on movies, but I cannot believe all the positive reviews here. People, it's a movie about nothing. There's nothing more than that. There's no secret message & no hidden meanings.",1247270400,5,3206,4.303482587064677
3603647,4,B001GCUNZI,"I was really pleased with Knowing. The first half was really interesting, and the characters are not only believable, but we can understand their pain and how they live. From the aha moment the code is revealed, we are thrust into wondering what will happen on the predicted day. I know some people were wanting to see more accidents and predictions, but I think there was a limited amount of time available to do so, and the movie gave just enough to verify the future was known. I won't go into too many details to spoil it for you, but I thought the end of the movie was really good. If you like science fiction movies regarding the end of times, etc... then you will enjoy the movie.

Bottom Line: I was happy with the film, it was a bit longer than many, but wasn't boring at all. The ending was a bit of a surprise, but in a good way. So, if you enjoy Science Fiction or Suspense, Knowing is worth watching.",1247184000,,913,4.277456647398844
3603648,3,B001GCUNZI,"This title seemed intestesting at first blush and held my attention until the unearthying of the time capsule after which it was downhill all the way.

Oddly reminiscent of Next and number 23 at times, this pseudo science fiction/suspense/horror flick left more questions unanswered than not. There is a basic fault with the entire premise which is why did the aliens not just come and kidnap the people they wanted at the time rather than go through all of the palava they took us through.

By the time I had got to the end of the somewhat predictable movie angered by the weird economics they must have had on the alien world that they could send all these spacecraft billions of miles just to pick two kids up per ship and take them somewhere else which had a single tree, I was just exasperated.

It was a good job it only cost a dollar from a kiosk because it is not worth any more than that.",1247184000,2,897,4.391566265060241
3603649,4,B001GCUNZI,"I love this genre, first of all. KNOWING reminds me in some ways of one of my all-time favorite end-of-the-world films, WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE. As another reviewer has already pointed out, it's an excellent blend of Biblical prophecy and science fiction. I was impressed with the manner in which the story unfolds, as Nicolas Cage's astrophysicist character comes to the realization that the world is about to end...and why his son seems to be connected to the prophecies. The cinematography is impressive, and the special effects--the plane crash scene in particular--dazzling. Sure it has its flaws, but they're so minor that they don't detract from one's enjoyment of this exciting and thought-provoking film.

3603650,5,B001GCUNZI,"I really enjoyed this sci-fi thriller.  Suspend disbelief (some will think the premise is not that far-fetched) and enjoy the plot as it unfolds. A word of caution for parents--before you let children view this it would be a good idea to preview the movie. There are several very realistic special effects that would absolutely cause children to become upset or to have nightmares.  Note: these special effects are different than those of fantasy movies such as Lord of the Rings where the audience, even children, know that the creatures do not exist in reality---e.g. a very realistic airplane crash across a highway; animals and people being burned alive--but these horrible and very realistic scenes last only a few minutes and are only a very small part of this film.  This movie has a very novel plot and the ending is spectacular, although in the last few minutes the viewer can anticipate what the outcome is going to be.  Nicholas Cage plays the part of a distracted and brilliant college professor who very quickly solves the mystery of the numbers--the speed and ease of him figuring the meaning out is unrealistic, but it does not detract from the plot.  If you enjoy a very unique and novel plot in sci-fi movies you should enjoy this.  This movie is a keeper.",1247184000,,1273,4.763636363636364
3603651,2,B001GCUNZI,"I read the description of this movie on imdb.com and decided to give it a try, so I rented it.  I began watching it, and the beginning was kind of weird and didn't really grab my attention like it should've, with some girl hearing voices in her head while writing numbers on a sheet of paper in school.  The movie ran its course, and I began seeing myself enjoying it, and I could see that it was going to be one of those movies with an incredible ending.  I just wanted to find out why all these things were happening and who was behind it all!  However, when the last 1/2 hour showed up, the whole movie turned horribly childish and weird, with some men dropping down in some spaceship to save the children.  Long story short, Nicholas Cage does not complete what he set out to do (which is save the world), and everyone dies except the 2 children that the alien.... or angel... or whatever kind of men in a spaceship decided to save.  So, why have the protagonist in the story not complete his task and make everyone go ""Yay"" at the end?  Why make the end so depressing and allow Cage to eventually just give up and accept the fact that he's going to die?  Oh yeah, and after everyone dies, you see the 2 children that are saved running in some field that's kind of like and island in the clouds (maybe it's heaven) while spaceships are flying all around.  That's the end!  Sorry for the spoilers but this movie is definitely not worth spending 2 hours to watch it.  I do not recommend buying or even renting this movie.  Stay away unless you want to waste 2 hours of your precious life.",1247097600,,1590,4.298657718120805
3603652,3,B001GCUNZI,"I want to start by saying i had trouble just giving this movie 3 stars. The movie plays out just like the previews showed. Cage gets numbers and they predict events. The movie is well acted. The directer did the a good job. Lighting, sound all good.

My problem with this movie is the source material. This movie really shows that everything can be good but it really comes down to the script. It was just poor. The movie dragged, the twist were predictable, and the ending well i don't want to ruin it.

If there is one reason i recommend seeing this and a major reason i bumped the stars up to 3 is the special effects. The movie is not really a action movie but there are a few scenes showing off amazing special effects one scene with an airplane being better than what a lot of action movies can pull off.

If you liked the new version of The day the earth stood still then i can recommend knowing otherwise rent it or forget about it, its not worth the $15 or whatever they are asking for it.",1247097600,,998,4.214659685863874

3603654,5,B001GCUNZI,The premise of the movie really is do happenings have a reason. Are they preordained or are they random in nature.  The prospective of the writer is they are preordained and there is a great plot showing this and how Nicholas Cages' character finally comes to grips with his ultimate mortality.  It examines briefly where the idea of angels come from and what ancient prophets may have saw thinking it came from God but it isn't dwelled upon. I loved it and recommend it to anyone. It was a thoroughly enjoyable film just as the remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still. Some of the special effects were awesome. I think it got some harsh reviews that were unwarranted. Nicholas Cage does a great performance in this movie as he does in all those in which he appears as part of the cast. I plan on buying this movie. Reviewers are just people and it is merely opinion. Watch the movie and see for yourself. Many times they just don't like the genre or storyline but it doesn't mean it is a bad movie because of the reviews.,1247097600,,1022,4.402116402116402

3603686,2,B001GCUNZI,"I went to the movies to see this film, and while it started out very good and on the road to being something magnificent, when it was time for the big reveal towards the end of the movie, it was not only a gag, but made everything else seem so pointless.

I'm not going to spoil the movie for those who are really interested, but it started at No. 1 opening week and plummeted as word got out on the plot and conclusion.  Notice the marketing of it too, in the past week leading up to its DVD release, whenever they showed the studio's other DVD release this week, 'Push' (which was another terrible movie I must add), they also add at the end for you to pick this movie up as well on the same day.  Who does that?  That's not clever marketing, but a sign that this movie was a big fail (it took in just under $80 million).  That should tell you something.

I just remember a bunch of sneers and curses when I went to a sold-out showing opening night when the movie wrapped.  Though the final scene was intense and epic, it was a waste.  The advertising of this film had you thinking you were getting a movie in the vein of 'Signs' 'The Day After Tomorrow' or 'Independence Day' but very misleading.  The acting performances were decent, but knowing that it was a Nicolas Cage film (with the exception of probably his rebound in the 'National Treasure' franchise), I should have definitely passed!  Rent this movie or buy it used, it's not worth more than $9.99 IMO.",1247097600,,1466,4.336996336996337
3603687,3,B001GCUNZI,"An interesting tale that I went into blind. Again, this newfangled notion of Knowing all about the various aspects of a film spoils things. More than likely, it is because I am growing older and used to a movie naturally unveiling its secrets and charms. Perhaps, the youth of today, who were born into the information age are naturally conditioned to expect a synopsis that will make sense with the subliminal every-scene-flashed-before-your-eyes trailers. At any rate, it was nice to let this one unfold on its own.

Knowing is a decent, well made film. It stars Nicholas Cage. Cage is a reliable actor because he plays himself, as he believes the character would be as Nicholas Cage. Audiences accept Cage in this way. We like him as a measured lunatic (Honeymoon In Vegas), a funny lunatic (Vampire's Kiss), and a full on lunatic (Wild At Heart). When allowed to, Cage steps out of his skin and into roles fashioned for the big boys (Leaving Las Vegas). He excels in such surroundings, but you get the sense he does not love them.

Chandler Canterbury is fine as Cage's young son burdened with having to grow up too soon. Rose Byrne turns in a nice performance as a link to the to the mystery Cage so desperately needs to resolve. Both provide welcome company to Cage's tossed-into-the rabbit hole existence.

Special effects abound, and the CGI just keeps getting better with each new release. Several CGI sequences in 'Knowing' are profoundly realistic. The computer gaming industry pushed visual and audio technology to greater heights until Hollywood got a hold of it. The town did what it does best: make magic. These days, teams of amazing technologists can be as important to a film as the cinematographer. After all, they will be replacing them one day.

My only grousing with `Knowing' is in some of the run of the mill goofy movie dialogue. However, it is minimal, and I tried to chalk it up to the characters `state of shock' disposition. I would have liked to see a bit more science, especially from the academia angle that was introduced early on. However, it is addressed in the `special features' section.

The story line is pretty much equal parts fantasy and science. As a sci-fi fan, I rate the film a respectable six out of ten tribbles. I would like to compare this film to some favorable films I have seen, but it would give too much insight into the plot. In addition, I would rather be sparse in a review so you might enjoy the surprises as well.`Knowing' is a nice rental when you're in the sci-fi mood.",1247097600,,2531,4.678651685393258
3603688,3,B001GCUNZI,"I've come to the conclusion (actually wonder why it took me this long) is that with movies, everyone will have their own opinion and likes and dislikes.  Everyone has the right to be a movie critic, but it's really up to the person deep down whether he or she likes a movie or not.

Given Knowing, I have to admit I'm glad for Pay Per View, for it saved me several dollars as I viewed it that route instead of purchasing it.

 Granted, Nicholas Cage is one great actor, even though his list of movies is near mind boggling as it seems he's in three to four movies a year. The movie's concept is a creative one, how simple numbers can be formulated in such a dramatic fashion to forsee disasters and doom.  Honestly, I wanted to dislike the movie's ending for I'd have preferred a more heavenly, peaceful ""rescue"" by angels as opposed to this movie's more scientific approach with the ""chosen few"" being saved by speechless, expressionless human forms which in the end turn to silverish alien beings and fly away in space ships. While I have my own beliefs, I had to respect this movie's unique approach.

  But hands down, depending upon the type of person watching this movie, it's not necessarily a good movie for those who are sensitive. Nicholas Cage spends so much of this movie just so miserably unhappy, depressed, and feeling as if there's no purpose.  The young girl in the movie's beginning sequence who starts it all by writing the numbers on a piece of paper is so unhappy and scared, it was near disturbing to watch.  The disaster sequences were one part stunning, but at the same time, graphic to the point I felt nauseous.  True to a disaster, people are injured, some horrifically, and die.

The most depressing part of this movie, however, is what I feel the most realistic depiction of how many would act given such a global catastrophe would occur. Senseless looting, violence, threats to police and other officials, and general chaos seems an inevitable factor and it's very well depicted in this movie.  Not expressing that everyone would act this way, the last scene of Nicholas Cage's character reuniting with his family before the catastrophe struck atleast was a shimmer of light in the chaotic darkness.

Those who like science fiction will probably like this movie or those who like Nicholas Cage will.  Some won't.  It's all a matter of personal opinion.  Personally, after watching this movie, I'm ready for a comedy marathon, though....

William",1247011200,3,2486,4.741860465116279
3603689,3,B001GCUNZI,"I've become something of a Nicolas Cage fan the past few years, due largely to the National Treasure films. What I saw of Knowing seemed intriguing. Having just watched the film, I'm a bit conflicted about how I feel about it. For the first 3/4 of the film, it's a creepy, suspenseful movie, with strangers hovering about watching the kids, odd lighting and quick edits to build the feel. All this works quite well, then the last quarter kicks in. Here we have the sci-fi angle, and I must say it felt jarring after watching it up to that point. Having aliens come to save chosen ones of the human race to start civilization over again seemed a cop-out after the downright creepiness of the movie before. Nicolas Cage does a good job during the creepy (and best) part of the film, then really has nothing more to do than stand wide-eyed during the ending. I guess it's an example of writing something so horrific in a story line that the only way out is to write aliens swooping in to save us. The special effects are incredible, especially the plane crash and the Independence Day-type end of the world. Overall, the movie as a whole isn't bad, it's just that the ending seemed so out of whack with what the best part of the movie was building to. The supernatural quality is what made the film work at first, what with the whispering that only one girl could hear. Later, when other kids, but not all, started hearing the same whispering, it felt right in the film. But to have that explained away as ""only the chosen ones could hear it"" seemed trite. I guess I'll have to watch it again to see how it takes a second time around, but I confess to being a bit disappointed in it.",1247011200,7,1680,4.405144694533762
3603690,5,B001GCUNZI,"I noticed early on that ""Knowing"" had been receiving scathing reviews from cinephiles who called the movie ""cliche,"" ""trite,"" and ""derivative.""  Most of these criticisms were impassioned and seemed to compare the movie to false estimations of what the film should have been.  There is nothing wrong with wanting a movie to subvert or defy your expectations; but there is something unfair about not recognizing a film for what it is, especially when the movie succeeds so brilliantly in achieving its end result.  ""Knowing"" starts off like a typical apocalyptic thriller rooted in numerology.  But slowly the momentum of the film builds with each carefully crafted scene, so its suspense dissolves into a profound study on loss and letting go.  ""Knowing"" is about knowing your place and role in the universe, and accepting it; and as hard as it may seem, letting go of your loved ones for their betterment -- even if its at odds with your own private longings.  The ending could have played out many different ways -- with us not seeing where the children ultimately arrive so that Cage's character is left only ""knowing"" in his heart -- or having faith.  Proyas is a benevolent director, so he allows us to see that the children indeed go on to a better place (whether this scene is the last thought in Cage's head or a scene that takes place outside of Cage's existence could be a subject of debate) because the story is trying to help us understand when it is necessary for our own peace to let go of our philosophical Materialism.  I think it's unfair to label this movie as ""cliche"" -- Proyas and writers simply used the generic conventions of your standard ""end of the world"" movie to turn the genre on its head and give you something more lasting than special effects.  For those of you who loved this movie -- read Arthur C. Clarke's ""Childhood's End,"" a novel which Proyas alludes to in ""The Knowing.""",1247011200,74,1909,4.708708708708708

Cage despite many reviews is marvelous and very empathetic as a grieving widower who has disconnected from life and going through the motions of being a father.  The film is really a journey of Cage's evolution as a scientist who discovers Faith, reconnects with his family and makes the ultimate sacrifice for his son.

The movie works on many levels but a primary one is the tug of war between religion and science Pre-determination or control over one's destiny. The story does not attempt to take sides in the debate just ask the viewer to think about these questions.  The tension builds with each revelation until reaching a horrifying climax.
All the characters are well fleshed out and the film is intelligent and well constructed.  One of the best Science Fiction movies to come out of hollywood in decades...",1247011200,2,977,4.690058479532164
3603693,2,B001GCUNZI,"First a quick comment on the blu-ray. The quality of the picture was relatively good standing up to today's modern releases with the one exception of some poor smearing in the darker portions of the picture. And no, it's not my TV, I'm a tech so trust me on that, it's likely due to over processing the picture (DNR, Edge Enhancement, etc).

Onto the film - and attention SPOILERS ARE PRESENT!! So if you haven't seen it yet and plan to then please don't read this review.

The premise of of Knowing is something that often captivates a large audience. Dramatic scenes of destruction are always impressive, and often disturbing to watch. I wasn't much impressed with the scenes here as they seemed a bit silly. Yeah yeah, I'll save the nitpicking but some of the scenes made me chuckle. All that aside though the movie was relatively entertaining until the second half. As you probably all know already Nicolas Cage gets this sheet with numbers from his son who got it from the time capsule his school buried as a project 50 years ago. He quickly comes to realize the dates are all related to catastrophe's that involve loss of life, even on a relatively small scale. 81 deaths and it's listed? He soon realizes he has the date for the end of the world, everyone's death, but of course... there's NOTHING he can do whatsoever to stop it. I mean, it's a huge solar event, what can he or anyone do? So... what is the point of the list? And if this final date is the ""big one"" what is the point of knowing all the previous dates with much smaller casualties? Surely not to save anyone's life because they'll all die anyway when the final end hits. So there I am still in the movie wondering what the heck the point of the list even was. It served no purpose neither did discovering it.

But wait, there's more... that's not what truly ruined the movie and made it utterly ridiculous, leave that for the aliens! That's right... aliens! Holywood just can't ever be creative anymore, just cue in the obligatory aliens. At this point, the movie turned from something that was weak but relatively entertaining to utter sillyness. So, these aliens come down to take select few individuals to a new world to start over the human race. Of course, Nicolas Cage who is supposed to be an MIT Professor doesn't have the qualifications to be chosen as one of the saved people to restart the world. Nope, the aliens take his young son and the grand daughter (also a child) of the original note writer as well as other people that you don't see, you just see the ships lifting off.

So at the end of this silly escapade I had to stop and think what the whole point of the movie is. It's called Knowing... OK so Cage ""knew"", he found out. But what else? Nothing. All we have here is no logical reason for the purpose of the dates and nothing anyone could do anyway to stop the end of the world. I can't understand why the aliens would have bothered to give all these other dates to the ""receivers"" when none of it mattered in the end anyway.

Here I thought the movie would be a bit more clever and involve using the knowledge to prevent disasters and still have some clever explanation to the point of it all. None of that here. If you're inclined to still want to see this you're best off renting it for sure. At least you might get a really good laugh at the alien scenes in the end. :-)",1247011200,2,3371,4.404494382022472
3603694,3,B001GCUNZI,"I had given up on buying anything Nicolas Cage worthy after that disastrous remake of Wicker Man which should have buried his career.  Well, I did sort of enjoy Lords of War and Bangkok Dangerous but nonetheless when I saw previews for this movie I wasn't going for it.  That is until I bought my Bluray Player.  So, I got hoodwinked by technology into buying this movie.  Though I must say that my expectations were Sarah Palin low for this movie and all I was hoping for at best was some great special effects and on the latter I was proved a prophet and on the former, the movie wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.  Overly cliche'd and predictable, of course.  You knew what would happen pretty much going in but the fact of the special effects with the plane crash scene, the train crash, at the end when the mystery men are actually aliens, and the apocalyptic ending is absolutely stunning on Bluray along with the surround sound.  This isn't in no way going to make us forget about other way better apocolyptic movies in the past, but this holds its own as a decent sci-fi thriller.  If Bluray has done anything it's taken an average movie with great special effects and made it enjoyable to watch.",1247011200,,1209,4.4389140271493215

I guess everything must get 'hollywoodized' to make it more appealing. The perfect example is Cages characters are always extremely brooding, melodramatic, usually with some kinda vice (booze). Granted he, plays that character to a tee, but it always adds an element of unrealness to me (why not have him a normal, well adjusted guy with lots of friends, etc,etc). At some point in all his flicks, there enters some female potential love interest ( Cage probably stipulates this ha!) ...That's OK sometimes, but time after time, movie after movie , it starts feeling like they're shoehorning the typical relationship angle into the movie. And they never fail to be knockouts, lucky Cage. Bangkok Dangerous and Next, same deal. This movie, of course the female lead HAS to just happen to be gorgeous , maybe the aliens were hoping for a hookup between Cage and the female lead before they took off with their kids, ha.  The gist of this gripe is, these type movies Cage makes lose a BIG bunch of gravitas , because of all the typical hollywood angles they always want to throw in, and their are other examples too....CGI effects that look CGI, aliens that seem to want to spook the heck out of the kids, yet tantalize the parents by not ever saying their true intentions, just standing and looking ominous then zipping off until the end...Maybe it's a combination of watered down writing and producing/directing or screenply...all that said, like other Cage movies, it's still mildly entertaining but could have been much more striking and realistic in another writer/director/producers hands...maybe.",1247011200,,1810,5.033333333333333
3603756,4,B001GCUNZI,"M. Night Shyamalan's Signs purported that it would illustrate that everything in life happens for a reason. Knowing starring Nicholas Cage and directed by Alex Proyas, comes closer to making this argument.

Nicholas Cage is John Koestler, an astrophysicist who is mourning the loss his wife while  raising his son, Caleb (Chandler Canterbury) as best he can. In one of his classes John broaches the subject of Randomness versus Determinism, is life a series of random events that man seeks to find meaning in, or do events happen for a reason? Is Earth the right distance from the Sun for life to flourish just by chance or did some force place it there? As part of a school project a time capsule is opened at Caleb's school where 50 years earlier the students put in the capsule their visions of the future. Caleb gets Lucinda's, a strange young girl who wrote a series of random looking numbers on a page. Is Caleb receiving Lucinda's paper a random act? Or was it meant to be? Almost immediately Caleb starts hearing garbled messages from what he calls the whisper people. John discovers the page in Caleb's backpack and looking it over starts to notice the numbers correspond to dates of tragedy's and the number of people killed. He is shocked to see the date of his wife's death on the page, and that there's three more sets of numbers that haven't occurred yet. John sets out to find the meaning behind the numbers and avert the coming tragedy's.

John enlists the help of Diane Wayland (Rose Byrne) and Abby who are the daughter and granddaughter of Lucinda, to see if they can help decipher the meaning of the numbers. Lara Robinson plays both Lucinda and Abby and she ably evokes the strangeness of Lucinda, and the innocence of Abby so well, I almost thought they were two different actresses. As John and Diana struggle to make sense of the numbers the whisper people seem to have an inordinate amount of interest in the children and their numbers seem to be growing, but their presence isn't what it seems to be and leads to a conclusion that is at once unexpected and emotionally moving.

I found the movie to be both interesting and the choices that are made by Cage's character and by Caleb to be moving.

Without giving away too much of the ending, a lot of reviewers have said how they thought the ending relied to heavily or resorted to a Biblical ending. I didn't see it that way, I see it more as a case of, if aliens came to Earth thousands of years ago our ancestors would see these beings and their characteristics as being those of gods or angels, and not necessarily Gods or angels.

I thought Cage's performance in Knowing was moving, and at times he related the characters pain so well it was almost palpable. It seems he's returned the power to his acting. The rest of the cast was equally engaging, I've already mentioned Lara Robinson in her dual role. Chandler Canterbury is engaging as Caleb.

The bonus features. The making of documentary is interesting with some insight behind the production of the movie, especially in it's earliest stages. There's also a documentary the Visions of the Apocalypse which features scholars talking about the ramifications of the end of the world but it drags on a little too long. The directors commentary I found flat and uninspired as if Alex Proyas was uninterested in doing it or just didn't know what to say about his movie.",1247011200,,3399,4.64559068219634
3603757,4,B001GCUNZI,"While not a perfect film, I really enjoyed how this film hearkened back to the science fiction of old.

When I first saw this movie, I wasn't honestly expecting much - it's a Nicholas Cage flick afterall. Surprisingly, I was really getting into the story and actually enjoying the events as they unfolded up until the scene at the gas station towards the end of the movie. It seemed that the writers just gave up at that point. Nothing the protagonist did throughout the entire scope of the film mattered at that point, since the main objective the was carried out by the intervention of ""mysterious creatures"" and not through the actions of the ""hero"". I did find humor in the slam against religion, since I am about as anti-religious as they come, but it was still not enough to save the story from the absolute absurdity that it descended into.

My two stars are for the Blu-Ray quality of the disc, as I hear it is quite top notch. The movie itself gets 0 stars from me though. Sorry.",1247011200,,1040,4.468421052631579

The child who discovers it in the capsule shows it to his father, who starts to see patterns in the numbers.  Patterns that aren't real nice.

Lately, we've seen a lot of movies which have 'surprise' endings that make you think 'Wow, never saw THAT coming!'.  This tries to be one of those but not in a good way.  After moving along one path, the movie suddenly turns into 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'.  It's jarring and frankly it gave me a headache.

When I was a kid in high school creative writing class, one of the things we learned was 'Never write yourself into a corner that you can't get out of without pulling a rabbit out of your hat, because that's cheating!'.  Too bad the writers of this script didn't take that class.  They even included the rabbit!",1247011200,4,925,4.4523809523809526

The special effects were out of this world...literally...(especially the subway scene...WOW!)

So as not to create a spoiler, I won't go into any details, but seriously, folks, this kind of thing is not beyond the reach of possibilities! Kind of spooky, if you ask me! One more thing of note: I especially like the dark feeling of gloom and foreboding throughout the picture. Usually when a lot of people are in a flick (large crowds), its hard to achieve this effect; it was not problem for this crew! They definitely had a KNOWING of what they were doing!

I doubt any of these people on Amazon who gave this movie any less than four stars are truly film critics. There is no way anybody could have any KNOWING of the movie genre and rate it as such. Don't listen to them, this one is a GEM!

3603761,4,B001GCUNZI,"What if you had a way to see the future? Would you try and change things? Would you save everyone you could from possible disaster? Or would you even believe that you had the ability to do so? All of these questions come into play in KNOWING.

The film opens in 1959 with a group of children preparing to include their items in a time capsule to be opened in 50 years. One girl in particular, Lucinda (Lara Robinson), seems to be deeply disturbed. Her contribution, rather than a simple drawing, is of a series of numbers. She goes disappearing only to be found with bloody nails scratching into a door inside a basement closet at the school.

Fast forward to present day. Nicolas Cage stars as John Koestler, a professor at M.I.T. who is dealing with the recent loss of his wife and raising a son on his own. His son Caleb (Chandler Canterbury) attends the school seen earlier where they are about to open the time capsule. Each child is given a letter left by the previous children and of course Caleb is presented with Lucinda's.

For some reason Caleb takes the letter home rather than return it to the classroom. When John begins looking at it, his analytical mind goes into overdrive and he begins to see a series of combinations in what appear to be random numbers on a page. A quick check of each set online and he discovers that the numbers all seem to be the dates of major catastrophes over the past 50 years with the number of deaths at each one following. The only problem is that a third set of numbers with each one seem to mean nothing.

John presents this hypothesis to his best friend at work who passes it off as coincidence. As he races off to pick his son up from school, John finds himself stuck in traffic near the airport. Looking down, he notices on his GPS that the numbers coincide with the numbers next to today's date. As he walks up to see what's going on, he turns to watch as a plane falls from the sky, raking its way over the stopped traffic and coming apart in a nearby field nearly killing all on board.

John pursues the links between all of these. In an attempt to find answers he contacts Lucinda's teacher from 50 years prior. Through her, he discovers that Lucinda died a few years earlier. Researching deeper he finds that she had a daughter named Diana (Rose Byrne) and sets out to meet her.

The meeting with Diana and her own daughter Abby (also played by Robinson) doesn't go well. The next date listed is tomorrow and the coordinates show downtown New York. John attempts to stop the disaster by calling in a threat to Homeland Security but things don't turn out as he hoped.

While all of this is going on both Caleb and Abby are visited by strange men in black. They seem to be communicating with them but without speaking. When John sees one of them he attempts to stop him but the man disappears.

The film works its way to the climax when the final numbers listed come into play. As John and Diana try to find out just what the answers are to the last numbers time begins to run out. Is this to be the end of the world? Is there hope for the future? And with the knowledge that something catastrophic is about to take place, will he be able to alter that future enough to make a difference?

Questions of pre-destiny versus religion play throughout the film. John is a scientist whose belief was shattered with the death of his wife. At the same time, his father was a minister who John battled with when her death came about. Whether or not all is set in motion on a random basis or planned ahead by some higher being is never quite answered here but left for the viewer to determine.

Cage does a great job here, completely believable in the role of the pragmatist whose faith in science begins to weaken with the more things he sees. At the same time it's his belief in science that helps him discover the clues he needs to solve the puzzle of the numbers.

A film like this depends on great special effects and this one displays them in spades. Most are glimpsed in the previews for the film but that doesn't lessen them while watching. Especially gruesome yet believable is the sequence involving the subway train.

The film offers an ending that might surprise some. It also offers a chance for people to either witness hope or to decide that when the end is near nothing matters. You as a viewer must make that decision. And the path taken in watching KNOWING is one that offers entertainment as well as a thought provoking film.",1246924800,,4488,4.407004830917875
3603762,4,B001GCUNZI,"Just a note a reminder--you may disagree with my review well then write a review. The voting system is supposed to be (but rarely used for)whether or not a review is helpful in helping someone who knows nothing about the product about whether or not its worthwhile.

Faith is subjective. One person's faith is someone else's superstition. Is the world filled with random chance or is everything predetermined? Alex Proyas' underrated film ""Knowing"" tackels a lot of difficult questions related to themes and questions in a creepy science fiction disaster movie. The film spirals out of Proyas' control at the conclusion but until then it's a riveting thriller with a surprisingly religious subtext (if you choose to see it that way)that plays into the themes of the film. While those who aren't religious may be put off by the film, I'd suggest approaching it with an open mind as the film is open to interepretion (listen to Proyas' commentary track and don't be too literal minded and you may enjoy the film). The deus ex machina conculsion may be a bit hard for many people to swallow but Proyas does set it up fairly clearly.

SPOILERS:

John Koestler (Nicholas Cage)believes that life consists of random events strung together until his son Caleb receives a note from a time capsule buried fifty years before suggesting otherwise. It seems that the list made up of a series of what appear to be random numbers aren't random at all but predict a series of disasters. Koestler becomes obsessed with trying to try and prevent these tragic things from occurring but ends up uncovering a much scarier truth.

""Knowing"" got slammed by critics when it was released. One of the few film critics to pick up on the film was Roger Ebert and his observations on the film are on target. Maybe the timing of the film impacted the critical reception of the film or they saw a different film from what I saw; I found Alex Proyas' brilliantly realized film a fascinating examination of faith and the trials we face each and every day. The film has two briliant set pieces but that are visuall stunning. Whether or not you buy into the story isn't important--just go along for the ride if you don't. ""Knowing"" may be a popcorn thriller but it's one that deals with some important questions. It may come up short with its explaination and resolution but you have to give director Proyas props for trying.

END OF SPOILERS:

The last third of the film spirals out of Proyas control but everything that he sets up still manages to pay off. Whether or not you buy into the ending of the film (which admittedly for some will appear to come out of left field much as the ending for ""The Prestige"" seemed to as well), the shift in tone and genre will depend on if Proyas has sucked you into the story.

The Blu-ray looks marvelous with a richly detailed image. The first film that Proyas has shot on digital video the film has rich inky blacks and the autumn color scheme works for the film. It's accurately captured well here. The DVD probably looks quite good as well but I haven't seen.

The extras are minimal but good--we get an intelligent observant commentary track by director Alex Proyas and an unidentified member of the production team. We also get a standard ""making-of"" featurette as well as a very good featurette discussing apocalyptic beliefs throughout our history.

As Roger Ebert accurately points out in his thoughtful review and blog about the film, ""Knowing"" focuses on the questions of determinism vs. free will. It doesn't give us easy answers and director Proyas leaves the answers hanging. As with Proyas' previous work ""Knowing"" is about the world we believe we live in and the one underneath is revealed to us during a crisis.

""Knowing"" is a suspensful, well made flawed thriller and while it isn't perfect, it's a solid thriller and very entertaining. What lifts Proyas' film from the average disaster movie are the hard questions about faith, belief systems are the strong performances and the two major set pieces in the film. Proyas tackles themes of faith in our chaotic universe which is a difficult and often daunting theme in today's films. I don't know that I agree with his beliefs but he makes a darn compelling film anyway.",1246924800,2,4244,4.738482384823849

3603765,5,B001GCUNZI,"If you want to go into the movie ""fresh"", do not read this. Spoilers may be peppered within the following review. I did my best not to give to much away.

I was highly anticipating this movie. I did not get the chance to see it in theaters, but the Blu-ray experience is just as good.

I was disappointed when I heard mixed reviews about this film. After hearing ""it was just ok"" again and again, I did not expect such an original story with great directing. Despite the few bad reviews, I was still excited to see this movie.

This movie is dark. It is quite morose at times. There are many sequences of terrible tragedies which will burn images into your mind. The special effects are very well done. The directing was perfect for such an eerie movie. Acting was solid. Nick Cage did very well. Finally he picks a great script with a concrete plot.

The movie seems longer than it is, but in a good way. So much happens. I didn't want it to end. Just when it started to slow down, a huge twist or action scene popped in and blew me away.

Many people complained about the end of this film. I believe the end of this movie completes it in such a way that I never would have thought. I did somewhat see the end coming, but it took it to a completely different level that I was not expecting. That's what I loved about this movie. Just when you think something is about to happen, it happened bigger and better than expected. Then it takes it further and completely pushes the limit.

Knowing is one of the more powerful movies I have ever seen. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen and I was almost brought to tears by the powerful depth and intensity of the plot with the characters involved.

Some of my favorite movies are Stay, Perfume: The Story of a Murderer, The Fountain, Sunshine, and anything by Wes Anderson.

You owe it to yourself to at least check out this movie. If you are a Cage fan you will love this movie. He hasn't played such an intense role since 8mm and Face/Off. The better of the many movies I have seen in the past five or so years. Well worth it.",1246924800,3,2076,4.251269035532995
3603796,4,B001GCUNZI,"I think what makes walking into ""Knowing"" a bit difficult is the director, Alex Proyas. Known for directing the awesome ""The Crow"", the great ""Dark City"" but the ho-hum ""I, Robot"", the frequency that he puts out big projects pales in comparison to heavyweights like Peter Jackson or Steven Spielberg (though definately more frequent than James Cameron) but looking at Knowing, a fairly conventional and ambitious thriller, you kind of go ""we waited, 4 years since I, Robot for this?"" But Knowing, for all its faults it's quite engaging and it's a rarity in the movie industry which is not only a thriller with some weighty topics but a movie with balls.

The film centers on John Koestler, a professor at MiT who specializes in astrophysics and wonders about the debate between random circumstances that lead to a certain point or whether everything is predetermined. This will be tested when his son receives a letter from a school time capsule 50 years earlier with seemingly random sequences of numbers. By accident/fate/whichever, he notices a pattern which makes him see what the numbers mean: the dates and the number of deaths that have occured in every major world disaster over the past 50 years with 3 that haven't yet occured. So with the help of Diana Wayland, the daughter of the woman that wrote the numbers, John tries to stop disaster from happening.

Really, I've always loved these kind of stories with my favorite kind being part of the ""X-Files"" tv show or stuff like ""Unsolved Mysteries""; there is a weird fascination in things beyond our control or understanding and it's what makes topics like UFO's, ghosts, psychic abilities and whatnot interesting because there's as much debate and cynicism as there is intrigue. ""Knowing"" plays off this quite well with the idea of events that are seemingly random or pre-planned. Course this makes it easy for the screenwriters to put in some, what would've been convenient things, and giving a spin on it. John sets his wet wine glass on the numbers page that so happen to contain ""9/11/01"", one of the more famous dates in terms of disaster. But in terms of topics and what the film is trying to say, it can create some discussion.

As for the movie itself? It will most likely divide many people. There's a slow pace to the film and it doesn't really have that building feeling towards the climax but instead the big setpieces (the first being arguably one of the most terrifying plane crash depictions on film) kind of break up all that chatting and the brooding. And the idea of John's family being very religious whereas he doesn't appear to be has the idea of what would've been a very thought-provoking debate but instead it feels almost surface level. Oh and the twist involving these weird dudes? Completely ludicrous to the point where one might watch it unfolding and think ""...what the hell?"" At least Dark City had an awesome albeit slightly unnecessary twist but here it's like ""um, yeah, okay"".

As far as acting is concerned, Cage does what he does best: sound bored when he's being serious and yelling certain sentences when he's mad so to that end, it's Cage being Cage. Rose Byrne, one of my favorite new actresses, doesn't have much to use but makes the most with what she has and the kids, who I normally can't stand in movies since they're such brats (that kid from the ""Day the Earth Stood Still"" remake? UGH!) are actually good but in the end ""Knowing"" to me I felt had a satisfying whole but troublesome parts to it and the hit-or-miss in the acting and dialogue is part of it.

This movie to me is what the Day the Earth Stood Still remake tried to do: deliver a ""message"" but do it right. It's got 3 fantastic set-pieces, a completely off-its-rocket twist, acting that ranges from great to good to decent even in the same character and certain things don't feel fully explained (what the hell's up with the pebbles?) but Knowing could be a really cool movie, one of the many you'll see this year that entertains but might forgot or just plain stupid.",1246924800,,4040,4.708628005657709

Who (or what) is truly behind the prophetic numbers is a question the film leaves open, somewhat, for debate in the final act. Director Alex Proyas tries to make a film that on the surface seems to pit religion and science against each other, but his final message is, ""Yes, Virginia, there is a purpose to everything."" That message comes in a bold and cinematicaly pleasing way in the last 20 minutes of the film, unfortunately it is almost lost amidst a muddled mess for the first hour and twenty minutes with poor pacing and a surprising lack of suspense.",1246838400,,649,4.603448275862069

3603801,4,B001GCUNZI,"Knowing is a film for people who like Science Fiction. This is not a ""left behind"" film although it contains religious elements; but it doesn't beat you over the head with them like a ""left behind"" movie. It has a very life-affirming, positive message and held my interest until the end.

Nick Cage stars as a scientist who finds a long-buried document, written by a child, that predicts future events. This leads him to investigate the origins of the number-filled note. Some people called this a ""thriller"" - not really. It has some loud moments, stuff does blow up in the film, but I wouldn't call it a thriller.

  I like the director, so I gave this film a chance. Movies that involve themes like this are tricky to do, especially now where theatres can be full of Flouride-drinkers and/or Zealots. Proyas should get some credit for trying to make interesting films - sometimes he comes up with a ""Crow"", other times he comes up with a ""I. Robot"". This film is more of a ""Crow"" than an ""I, Robot"".

3603802,4,B001GCUNZI,"I was definetly surprised with this movie. I had not seen any previews for it, so was not sure what the movie was about. I have always been a ""Nicolas Cage"" fan and knew that I wouldn't walk away from this movie empty handed. I was right! What a ride! Great Movie!! I loved the pace and attitude the movie gave you, the ""not knowing"" what happens next. I love to be able to watch a movie and not have it figured out in the first 30 mins. I give this movie 4 stars. A great flick to watch at any age, however, I wouldn't recommend it for children under 13, due to some scary images. I was a little disappointed with the end of the movie. Not to ruin it for those who haven't seen this movie, but you know what they say, ""it's just a Movie!"" I'd Watch it Again in a Heart Beat! Entertainment all the way!",1246665600,,802,4.01875
3603803,2,B001GCUNZI,"Anytime the words Nicolas Cage and science fiction are thrown together in the same sentence, nothing good really seems to arise.  Knowing this (no pun intended), I went into Knowing based on the fact that it is helmed by Alex Proyas, the man who brought us genre classics The Crow and Dark City, and has since been saddled with the likes of I, Robot, and now Knowing.  Cage stars as an astrophysicist whose young son (Chandler Canterbury) discovers a time capsule that holds some frightening predictions.  Some of which have already happened, and sure enough, the rest are to follow happening as well, with father and son caught right in the middle naturally.  Predictable mostly throughout, Knowing succeeds during some truly horrifying sequences (including a brilliantly filmed plane crash), but ends up getting too plodded down in itself.  Cage is his usual funky self, but he just doesn't seem like the right kind of fit here.  Rose Byrne, who is so good on TV's Damages, ends up being pretty well wasted here as well in a supporting turn as a woman who has ties to the findings, and the cast as a whole doesn't offer anything memorable in the least.  Still, the few times that Knowing works, it works well, right up until the end which you'll either see coming a mile away or find yourself with eyes wide open.  Either way, Knowing doesn't offer anything you haven't seen before, and seen done better either.

3603805,3,B001GCUNZI,"Nicolas Cage stars in this science fiction movie with an interesting plot that begins in 1959, when a school teacher asks her pupils to draw pictures of how they imagine the world will be fifty years after, to be put away in a time capsule which will be opened in 2009.
Instead of drawing, one of the girl pupils, which seems to be possessed at the moment, begins to write numbers on a sheet of paper, without any particular relation with what she was asked to do.
Not understanding what has happened, her teacher takes away the girl's paper, and put it inside an envelope, which is after put away in the time capsule, where it stays until fifty years later.
In 2009, Nicolas Cage's character is a proffesor at the M.I.T. in Massachusets, who, having recently lost his wife, is feeling depressed, and tries to give his only son all the love he lost when his mother passed away.
The boy, who is now a pupil at the school where the time capsule experiment was held, receives the envelope where the girl's paper with numbers was put away; and his father discovers that those numbers indicate dates when different disasters were going to happen from 1959 until the present time, as well as the quantity of casualties that each one of those events would cause...",1246233600,2,1257,4.566371681415929
3603845,5,B001GCUNZI,"Nicolas Cage hasn't had much luck in the land of the mainstream in recent years, and frothy duds along the lines of Next and Ghost Rider certainly haven't done much to alter this pattern. Enter Knowing, a sci-fi flick that took a very similar marketing approach to Cloverfield, releasing mysterious, subject-veiling trailers which left the viewers wondering exactly what sort of movie it was they were previewing. It is, in theory, a dangerously hit-or-miss approach to advertising, but it may be appropriate in this case. Knowing's opening scene occurs in the mid-50's, with an elementary school teacher explaining to her students that they must draw a picture of what they believe the future will be like and then place the drawings in a time capsule, which will be opened several years from then. A seemingly disturbed little girl has other plans. Rather than drawing a picture of the future, she furiously jots down a series of numbers, and we are given an indication that she is hearing voices telling her to do so. At the actual burying of the time capsule, the girl vanishes, only to be discovered in a hallway closet by her teacher as she continues to scribble the numbers onto the closet door with her fingernails; she then tearfully asks her teacher to `make it stop.' Fast-forward several years later, and we are of course at the reopening of this time capsule, and of course our protagonist-or, more accurately, the protagonist's son-obtains the mysterious little girl's list of numbers. Cage's character, the recently widowed astrophysicist John, doesn't believe there's any significance to the scribbled number sequence, but of course the wild series of events that follows proves otherwise. One fateful night, John happens to notice a pattern to the numbers-that they align with the dates of nearly every major global disaster and tragedy since the date it was written-plus a handful that haven't happened yet. John then goes through the by-the-numbers sequence of trying to get everyone else to believe him, which of course throughout the majority of the movie no one does. But when the first disaster that the number sequence predicts actually happens, John gains a deeper understanding of what he's come across. All the while, Caleb continuously comes across a pale-faced, trenchcoated man who seems to be the source behind mysterious voices ringing in his head and a series of horrifying visions of chaos and destruction. Knowing does an excellent job of keeping the audience's attention, and most shreds of plot predictability are drowned out by the sheer mystery and suspense that pulses throughout the entirety of the film. Knowing is an action-thriller (with more thrill than action), but it also succeeds at maintaining strong undertones of eeriness and dread, and in that light it nearly comes off as a high-class pseudo-horror film; it's the subtle, slow burn type of horror moviegoers don't see much of nowadays. M. Night Shyamalan should be taking notes. One of Knowing's strongest assets is the one thing it has that most movies of its kind don't: genuine shock value. Knowing is shocking until its very end (which is particularly shocking, not in exactly what happens, but what happens to the story's characters), and although the movie's `big picture' might head in the general direction of what viewers might predict, it's unlikely that the final outcome of the characters will be expected. Nicolas Cage is the star, but he may be the film's weakest link. Cage's occasionally awkward, cheeseball approach to acting is at times an ill fit for this particular role, and it leaves one to wonder what the movie could've been in different, more capable hands. Regardless, the film works in nearly every other aspect, and it keeps viewers on the edge of their seats, guessing what'll happen next, like any good horror/action/thriller flick should. Knowing is a movie about tragedy, so it's only natural that many of its events are indeed tragic, but it does a much better job of maintaining a sense of hope in the wake of tragedy than wholly miserable movies like Premonition and 28 Weeks Later did. In the murk of today's teenybop horror and torture porn, Knowing actually does what the likes of The Happening set out to do, and it does it in a much more tasteful and much less melodramatically morbid manner. It's a rarity in the 00's: an end-of-the-world movie that actually works.",1246233600,2,4410,5.001360544217687
3603846,4,B001GCUNZI,"KNOWING is an odd but interesting film.  While it is not what you expect it to be, it certainly holds your attention to the end.  Spooky and creepy, yet surprisingly and strangely uplifting at the end, KNOWING is a unique and unusual movie that comes at you from a lot of different directions.

KNOWING is many things, many genres all woven together.  It starts off almost as a horror film, with a young girl, Lucinda (Lara Robinson), haunted by ""whispered"" voices that only she can hear.  The voices compel her to write down a series of numbers and to seal them in the school's time capsule.  Lucinda then disappears and is later found locked in the school's basement with bloodied fingers and terror-filled eyes.  Now fast forward 50 years to 2009, and the opening of the time capsule.  MIT astrophysics professor John Koestler (Nicholas Cage) and his young son Caleb (Chandler Canterbury) are present at the opening.  Caleb receives Lucinda's envelop, the one containing the series of numbers.  When this happens, we realize that Caleb, too, can hear ""the Whisperers,"" and this is no coincidence.  As John begins to unravel the shocking mystery of the numbers, the Whisperers step up their contact with Caleb, sending John into a fury of protective, parental rage.  At this point the movie has become a mystery/disaster film:  do these numbers really predict what they seem to predict, can the predictions be changed, how is his son involved, and what does it all mean?  John needs empirical evidence to believe anything, and in this case, he is getting that scientific evidence in spades.  As KNOWING reaches its bombshell conclusion, the genre switches again.  With an end that is both sad and hopeful as well as filled with Christian symbolism and references, this film melds sci-fi and religion in an extraordinary and thought-provoking way.  While you may be taken aback by the ultimate conclusion, it certainly is a ""revelation"" that will make you question what you believe.  Free will or predestination?  You will have to draw your own conclusions.

The plot of KNOWING is fresh, bizarre, and intense.  I was riveted to the screen from the beginning.  Very few book or movie plots surprise me anymore, but this one kept me on the edge of my seat and kept me guessing until the very end.  I always enjoy Nicholas Cage, and his performance of man who has seen and experienced way too much is excellent.  His gut-wrenching decision at the end is the right one (IMHO), but as a parent I can certainly understand the devastation of that decision.  The special effects in KNOWING are out of this world, especially the disasters that John witnesses - they are outstanding; I was literally gasping for breath and cowering in my seat.  The underscore of KNOWING is a perfect accompaniment to this film.  It kept my heart racing, my pulse pounding, and the air filled with tension.  Wow.

It is actually very hard to write a review about KNOWING.  It is certainly NOT a feel good movie.  But it is provocative and mind blowing.  Whether you believing free will or determinism, religion or science, or you can blend it all together in your own belief system, KNOWING will make you reconsider what you believe and why you believe it.  RECOMMENDED, especially for those who want more than a light, fluffy film.",1246060800,6,3307,4.817051509769094
3603847,1,B001GCUNZI,"Obviously, the long winded reviews must be from the studio releasing the movie.  I would appreciate the section named ""Customer Review"" to be by people who paid to watch the movie, not people who get paid to watch and review favorably the movie.  I won't delve into the reasons behind why such a typecast ""actor"" (I use the term loosely) keeps getting work from Hollywood.  The movie grossed 38 million at the box office so for some reason people continue to watch his movies. If a movie script comes out that has a major conflict that needs to be solved, no one seems to be on the same page as the character in peril, and time is running out, Cage's agent is the first call out.

Moving on, the movie has taken 2 hours from my life, so I will take the time to save others from the same mistake I made by choosing to watch this movie (mostly because I had a free ticket for the movie).  The CGI is not very good. Just about every scene that has a tragedy someone is being burned to death.  I got that the director was showing hell on earth, literally, for just about every carnage depicted throughout the movie (minus the derailing of the subway which killed 81 people in its path and yet managed to spare the lives of Cage and a pregnant women he felt the need to save who were in front of the subway which took out another subway, 6 concrete pillars, 45 feet of concrete siding of the subway tunnel and dozens of people who tried to outrun a subway gone mad). Actually, the entire movie can be summarized in that scene.  A complete and utter train wreck which is unbelievable, a complete mess, and takes too long to end.

The acting from the children to the adults in the movie was at best laughable.  The story had more holes than Cage's hair plugged head.  The infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type a given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare.  Unfortunately, I felt as if a monkey wrote this script but wasn't given a typewriter.  Instead the primate only had 2 hours,its feces and a whiteboard to work with.

3603851,5,B001GCUNZI,"I've been a fan of Alex Proyas ever since I saw The Crow, after Brandon Lee's untimely death.  The atmosphere he created would become his trademark in films such as Dark City, and again here in Knowing.  People seemed to either get this movie, or totally miss the point.  I think some of that falls on Nicholas Cage, as he is usually cast in such average fare that people seem to expect only a certain type of movie from him, forgetting the varied roles he's played in Valley Girl, Vampire's Kiss, and Wild at Heart.  This film plays against that type and really juggles your expectations until the very end.  It reminded me a lot of ""The Fountain"", in that it is a brilliant work that requires some thinking on the audience's part, and benefits from repeated viewings.  Like that film, the exposition and resolution of Knowing are left up to the viewer to interpret, although some subtle clues are given to those sharp enough to spot them.

This film is at its heart a religious allegory, explaining humanity's need to create religious dogma of different faiths to explain basically the same questions; where did we come from?  and what will happen to us in the end?  It was so refreshing to see a film maker tackle this subject without identifying with one specific religion, and I think this is a benefit of Proyas being of Egyptian heritage, as that is a very mixed society of Muslims, Christians, and Jews.  The ending that so many people found a left turn was the logical resolution to the clues that had been given; the wheel in the religious etching was obviously a ship, the angels above man were the visitors, the fire below was the approaching Armageddon, the cover to the time capsule even had an inscription resembling said wheel almost as a marker to man that there lay the warning to them of what was to come.  The entire theme was basically laid out in the classroom scene at the beginning of the film, predetermination vs. free will, the mention of the sun, and the father's discussion with his son about possible life on other planets.  Once you put the pieces together, it was a pretty cool and fresh interpretation of Christianity, and by extension, all religions on Earth.  As was referred to in Revelations, angels would return to the Earth in its final hours to rescue the innocent and righteous from the fires of Armageddon, which is exactly what happened.

The theme of faith vs. science was even more blatantly referred to in the finale of the film, after Nicholas Cage had lost his faith due to a freak accident killing his wife, in the end he returned to his family home, and made peace with his preacher father.  He knew that the universe had a plan for humanity, and even if they didn't believe in the same religion, he had found peace with his life knowing things would continue as they were meant to.

This movie has some of the best disaster scenes in any movie that I have seen. The scenes were very intense and realistic.

3603854,2,B001GCUNZI,"Have to agree with Tom Keogh's review of the movie.  Very accurate description of the movie.  Nothing profound or emotionally charged at all, I think those reviewers should start taking their prozac again.  Nicolas Cage presents us with his usual bad acting, not sure how he keeps finding work in big films.  The script wasn't all that great either, and was very predictable and full of cliche.  Been there, seen that.  Maybe think of this as a montage or homage to sci-fi past, a little of everything thrown into the mix.  The first time the pale mutes appeared, I knew the ending of the movie, and they appeared very early in the movie.  Nicolas Cage's character became very melodramatically obsessed way too early and made the entire leap from suspicion to ""knowing"" way too quickly, it was very unnatural.  For die-hard sci-fi fans, this is about as good as ""Next"", another Cage psychic phenomenon that also fails to deliver anything new, believable, or worth spending money on.  Watch it if you can see it for free and have nothing better to do, otherwise pass on this for something truly original that actually has a creative edge and mysterious unpredictability like ""Stay.""  Maybe this movie will work well for a 14 year old amish boy who has never seen any television or even a movie of any kind before, but anyone who has seen any science fiction will find this trite and contrived, and anyone with a brain will also find it predictable and cliche.",1244592000,3,1458,4.700787401574803
3603885,4,B001GCUNZI,"I loved this movie because it actually dared to toy with some profound ideas -- especially the apparent conflict between Free Will and Determinism.  It's amazing how many evangelicals insist on their carved-in-stone conclusions about ancient Biblical prophecy and at the same time hold that God endowed his human creatures with Free Will.  Can you have both?  Not in my universe.

Maybe life and reality as we perceive it is open-ended.  We make it up as we live out our lives.  And along the way the Creator explores His own nature in and through us?

This film is sly and brilliant and actually about something.  I am amazed at the posted reviews that just don't get it.

SPOILER ALERT:

The other thing that's cool is the visual reference at the climax to the so-called ""spaceships of Ezekiel.""  The 6th Century BC Hebrew prophet who saw descending crafts that looked like rotating ""wheels within wheels.""

Humanity is rescued for a new beginning.  Is the title a clue to the idea that finally, we have hope and that life  is not a meaningless existence in a cold, uncaring universe?  Is that the other meaning of Knowing that we can safely embrace?  what we can safely Know?  Is there anything we can actually know besides that we exist?  perhaps there is.  As someone once said, ""Finally, one is left with the notion that the universe is a love story.""

3603886,2,B001GCUNZI,"With a Nicholas Cage film there's supposed to be thrill and suspense.  And yes, the film starts that way.  There's this building wonder about what the #s ultimately mean, and where the movie--and the world--are heading.  The settings are mostly dark, the music ominous.  However, over time another sense begins to build--that perhaps the grand meaning will prove disapointing.  A little over an hour into the movie that 2nd intuition overtakes the thrill of suspense, and by the end, there is dispair.  A movie that a few may find profound (mostly those that believe in childhood innocence and perception vs. the decayed and corrupt worthlessness of the adult world), but many will find disheartening and hopeless.

The acting was fine, and the technical work quite good.  It's the plot, the story itself that killed it for me.  Perhaps it's the optimist in me, but I left the theater feeling spiritually sullied, and psychologically saddened.

And the creepy people after the protagonists gave the film an additional edge.

SPOILERS:
Things get real crappy near the end. They resort to a odd hybrid of alien involvement/religious influences. And the religious influences are quite apparent and obvious. I myself am not religious, so count me biased on not being real happy with this at the end of the film (obvious adam and eve/noah's ark stuff), but what's worse is (MAJOR SPOILER!) the Nicholas Cage character dies at the end... which makes the entire movie pointless. What point was there of him knowing all of this when he, and most of the people on the planet, die anyway? Why would the aliens bother letting someone like him know? Maybe I missed something, but I still think it was very lazy screenwriting.

He stumbles the special paper written 50 years containing number sequences, as the plot unwinds we realize these number predict disasters.  Soon the last disaster date is unraveled and it is just a day away!  Can it be stopped?  Is it possible to escape?
The movie starts slow, the plot and dialogue are predictable and the initial special effects were laughable; I kept waiting for Mystery Science theater aliens to appear. I did ponder if I should cut my losses and leave.  However, I enjoy Cage and I figured I had already wasted an hour, why not another?  The last 45 minutes moved much more quickly and the cliche sci-fi material started to come together in a more believable plot.  This was aided by drastically better special effects, perhaps the director was saving his funds for the last five minutes.  If someone else had the lead the story wouldn't have been convincing.  The other actors were overall average, the actor portraying Cage's son was a bit weak.  One other point, I noticed in one of the disaster scenes that there wasn't one person overweight out of 100's in the crowd, not even the police officers!

3603894,5,B001GCUNZI,"""Knowing"" is superb Apocalyptic horror from director Alex Proyas (""I, Robot"" and ""The Crow."")  It combines Biblical prophesy, extraterrestrial phenomenon and astronomical science to create an incredibly unique, suspenseful plot.  The grisly depiction of disasters will leave you breathless.  Nicholas Cage's performance is one of his best yet.

  In 1959, Lucinda suggests to her teacher that her class plant a time capsule filled with drawings of what the future holds.  In lieu of robots and spacecraft, the strange girl scribbles numbers that appear to be random.  Fifty years later, the capsule is unearthed.  Lucinda's paper is given to Caleb, son of MIT professor John Koestler (Cage).  The professor makes a startling discovery.  The numbers are dates for disasters that have occurred around the world over the past fifty years.  There are also dates for disasters yet to happen, including one that will be the Biblical Apocalypse.

  This strange film is very provocative.  It asks the questions:  How will the world end?  When will it end?  Sometimes it's better not to know.  I always thought mankind would be destroyed by a nuclear holocaust.  However, a natural disaster - perhaps like the one that caused the dinosaurs to become extinct - could destroy us.  Will there be hope for mankind's survival - and from where and from whom will this hope come?  ""Knowing"" is a great disaster film for fans of Apocalyptic horror such as the modern ""Deep Impact"" and ""Armageddon"" or the classic ""When Worlds Collide.""",1240444800,4,1519,5.110204081632653
3603925,5,B001GCUNZI,"The key to watching ""Knowing"" is that it is a modern version of a 50's Sci-Fi movie, and with that comes some things that really work and a few things that are a little jarring until you catch on.  I won't describe the plot for you because the other reviewers here have done it so well.  But I want to make a couple of points about this movie.  First, it uses special effects in the service of the plot!  This is not your typical Hollywood Special Effects Extravaganza where it is essentially effects strung together like beads on a necklace, only there is virtually no plot or the director was apparently not looking at the actors during shooting (how else can you explain Keanu Reeves in The Day the Earth Stood Still?)  The effects are used sparingly, but when they are used they are SPECTACULAR and realistic!  You won't find people outrunning a shock wave or explosion blast here.  You won't find slowed down action sequences played 10 times.  The effects are just great.  Second, I think the filmakers went out of their way to add in a bit of hokum to give it that 50's feel.  That was a brave move, because it messes with the timing a little bit, but helps to make the movie unique.  Third, an ending with GUTS.  I can't say more without spoiling it, but you'll see what I mean.  Fourth, Nicolas Cage.  Need I say more?  This is a really creative, thought-provoking movie that is definitely worth your time.",1239753600,3,1414,4.46875
3603926,3,B001GCUNZI,"At the opening of a time capsule, Caleb Koestler (Canterbury) receives a sheet of paper covered with numbers.  When he shows it to his father, John (Cage), he becomes obsessed with the 50 year old sheet of paper.  He comes to discover that the numbers represent all of the major disasters that have occurred over the past 50 years including the date, death total, latitude, and longitude.  His investigation also leads him to Diana (Byrne), the daughter of the little girl who wrote down all those numbers so long ago, and her daughter Abby (Robinson).  Together they try to figure what will happen when the numbers run out.  Meanwhile, the kids are being watched by mysterious strangers who might be the key to solving the mystery.

""Knowing"" is an odd movie that starts out odd and gets progressively odder.  Normally that would not bother me, but for some reason, ""Knowing"" just got too ridiculous for me to walk out of it with a positive feeling.  I suppose I understand what the movie was trying to accomplish, and there was some interesting moments, but overall it just left me feeling disappointed.  The special effects are solid, and there are some action scenes that are pulled off really well.  Nicolas Cage gets some points for trying something different, something he does often, but that is not enough to save this film.  I can't recommend it.",1239580800,2,1356,4.776824034334764
3603927,1,B001GCUNZI,"I don't know why I do this to myself. I always try to challenge the editor or critic and go ahead and watch films. Knowing was just about as dismal as the editor had pointed out. Midway during this film it got so self-involved I had no idea what sort of logic the main character was basing his theories on. The last scene was just the cake. It is sad to see that so much money and resources were wasted on this film and by no means am I being sarcastic.

I love movies that make you think in circles like this one does. This movie is like a blend of science fiction and faith (more faith in my opinion), and it's a whole different kind of end-of-days type film. The graphics are fantastic, and the acting is pretty solid even though Nicolas Cage does most of it.

I guess I'm just too easily impressed compared to other reviewers. I thought this movie was a little scary and somewhat suspenseful, and it kept me on the edge of my seat. The ending holds up and makes the film feel complete and sort of refreshing. It's fun to think about afterwards. I highly recommend it.

3603929,2,B001GCUNZI,"I watched this movie expecting it to be a mindless piece of entertainment, and in that sense it lived up to my expectations.  Yes this review contains spoilers.  I really cannot understand the positive reviews found here.  I found the movie to be very inconsistent and quite a let down.  I have to assume no one associated with making this movie did it to tell some analogy of a deeper reality, I also assume it is just a sci-fi thriller.  But even at that it is a totally stupid premise.  It would appear the movie is promoting the panspermia hypothesis of the origin of our planet.  So let me see, aliens started life on this earth and a little before life on earth is to end due to a random solar flare, they decide to take two earthing specimens to another place to continue human life.  How brilliant!  Or wait, the movie also belittles the Christian faith and belief in an eternal creator God (replacing Him with aliens) since no one on earth is resurrected and Jesus does not return to earth before it is destroyed.  Since Nicolas Cage's father is a pastor this aspect of the movie isn't accidental.  And whoever thinks there might be a dual meaning to the aliens, as in maybe they are angels or whatnot....last time I checked God doesn't ride around the universe in a fleet of spacecrafts, He doesn't really need one.

So that then brings us to the whole story put forth in the movie.  Why are these intelligent aliens so stupid.  Why transmit some dates about natural disasters to take place in the future, then have them buried in the ground for 50 years so that a guy can read them, understand them and agree to give his child to them.  Why didn't they just come whenever they wanted and get whoever they wanted?  Oh, maybe they didn't want to infringe on humans ""free-will"" and came up with this elaborate scheme of coded numbers in a time-capsule so that the children would be given to them rather than taken by them? And lets not talk about the meaningless black shiny rocks.  Hmmm, have I left anything out?  So how are the numbers a warning to the people of earth if there is no means of escape?  Like ""we're warning all you earthlings that you will die tomorrow, and did we forget to tell you....there isn't anything you can do about it.""  Kinda wish they wouldn't have told us, don't you think?  I'm beginning to wonder if all the people who give positive reviews of these types of movies are paid employees of Hollywood or else the dumbing down of America is happening at a much faster rate than I ever realized.  In conclusion, as a 2 hour piece of mindless entertainment it is fine, because that is what it is, but to try and assign it some cinematic significance only shows how silly we've all become.",1239494400,4,2723,4.458585858585859

[spoilers, of course!]
  One of the most scary movies that I have ever seen!  Rarely Have I seen a ""Horror movie"", done with style, good acting, very very good special effects; most such other movies lack something in certain areas.
  I address this review, as I am not going to repeat what other good reviewers have already stated, I address this review to those people who
are ""psychic"" and to those people who will look for ""occult hidden meanings"" in this movie, as I feel that Knowing will become a real Cult Classic, over the years, *especially* as 2012 approaches and the sun begins to act up
with solar flares!
  Hidden meanings are There, all right!
John's son also writes out a series of numbers, and John also yanks this sheet away before the sequence is finished.  I was able to see part of the number written on the desk, it was ""15523"".  It spells out,
""JESUS CHRIST""!  Also, the ""EE"", at the end of the girl's letter, is ""33"", the number of Jesus!
  I am beginning to think, as an amatur occultist, that this movie
has Information encoded within it, about the end times and our collective fates.  That the ""Joke is on us all"", in that this movie *is* a prophecy
for us, to ""soften us all up"" to accept the future that may arrive very soon!  Few people, as of yet, have delved into the hidden meanings.
  One of the major ""conflicts"" in this movie, that to me infers a ""behind the scenes inspiration from above"" manipulation, is how all through the movie the bond between John and his son, is stated over and over, the ""You and me forever in eternity"", whereas only the two children go and John remains behind. I see that the ""hidden messege"" here, is that
""EVERYONE ELSE"" will go, at the end of the age, as if Jesus returns, he will take all of the people who were ""the other thief on the cross"":  those who rejected salvation!
[that John will meet his son, when the firewall kills him, in that Land with the tree.]
Thus there will be very very few ""left behind"", if some ""end times"" event happens, near 2012!

3603931,4,B001GCUNZI,"While it may not really be the most credible science fiction film ever made, or even the best of its own sub-genre, the ""End Of The World"", KNOWING is a long way away from such incredible tripe as BATTLEFIELD EARTH or the recent (and thoroughly unnecessary) remake of THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL.  Its storyline isn't always credible, but it worked for me just the same.

The premise of KNOWING, in that an MIT professor played by Nicolas Cage, has discovered a parchment hidden in a time capsule at his son's school that was buried there fifty years ago with a random set of numbers that foretold of horrors that would befall us between 1959 and 2009, and the ultimate horror that would eliminate the human race, is a brilliant and even frightening one.  It's especially so when he learns what the first sequence of numbers means--911012996, meaning of course the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, which killed 2,996 people.

Indeed, this is a film that involves both science and religion, which often seem to bump into one another both in the reel world and the real world. Cage gets involved because one of the disasters told in that parchment was an apartment fire in Phoenix that killed his wife and eighty others a few years back; and when he comes into contact with the daughter (Rose Byrne) of the disturbed schoolgirl who wrote the parchment, he desperately tries to protect himself, her, and their two children (Chandler Canterbury; Lara Robinson). In the end, however, knowing what the numbers on the parchment mean can only lead to the tragic conclusion that the film gets to eventually--that The End can't be stopped.

Despite some occasionally lame dialogue in the screenplay, KNOWING elicits a fair number of scares and plenty of suspense as it goes step by step towards The End. Its blend of science fiction and Biblical prophecy was, for me, rather interesting, because it did not totally dismiss the prophecy aspect out of hand (which so many on the far-right lunatic fringe say Hollywood has done for the longest time), and yet it also avoided the ham-fisted soapbox shouting of the ""Left Behind"" series. The special effects here, not surprisingly, are quite good, verging on operatic; and the music score by Marco Beltrami interestingly appropriates the ominous Allegretto movement of Beethoven's Symphony No. 7 at a couple of points in the film as a musical prelude to the inevitable.

KNOWING probably won't go down as being among the best science fiction films ever, let alone of the End Of The World variety, but it works well enough, and it has provoked a lot of consideration about the impact of science and religion on the future of humanity.",1238371200,42,2678,4.823529411764706
3603932,4,B001GCUNZI,"The title of this review is as much of a spoiler as I will permit myself to make in this review.  It also describes why this film is so good, so thoughtful, so original and ultimately so effective.

No plot synopsis.  Read the one from Amazon, it's pretty good.

This is a review, mostly, for those who have already viewed the film, or those who want to know what they're getting into.  This is not some run-of-the-mill special effects extravaganza.  The ending works on an emotional level and a philosophical level more than a CGI spectacle, though you get a bit of that too.  So, if you're looking for a disaster/action film, move on, this isn't it.  If you're looking for a faith vs. science, science fiction film, then I emplore you to check this film out.

Most movie goers, going by some mediocre to negative reviews on this site, seem to want thier films easily packaged.  You can have one, maybe two ideas but that's it.  Pack it full of more dimensions and folks seem to get scared.  I've read many-a-review by people who think they're the second coming of Roger Ebert who go on and on about what films should be, not having a good structure, not knowing what it wants to be, etc...The truth is, these people are the victims of the generic effect the Hollywood blockbuster has created.  They are so used to being fed the same mind-numbing formula films that anything else just scares them, or makes their brains hurt.  It's sad really.  This is not a formula film.  Sure, it's got aspects of Sci-Fi, disaster films, paranoid conspiracy thrillers, and religous parable, but it could not be described as any one of them.

My favorite thing about this film is that it can be taken two ways and still be a valid take.  Some might take it as a straigh end-of-the-world Sci-fi film with undetones of Close Encounters.  Others may see it as a modern look at the heavens and the story of Noah's Ark or Adam and Eve.  The film allows both to work. ***MILD SPOILER***  Sorry, just one.  Watch the 'visitors' at the end of the film.  One might automatically assume they are alien beings, but then watch them closely as they float back inside their 'craft'.  What are those trails flowing from their backs?  Are those wings or just particles emitting from their bodies.  In human form are they pale and sculpted because they are angelic or because the aliens hid their true form inside dead bodies of men?  Look at the 'craft' itself.  Does it look like one thing, or perhaps two?***END OF SPOILERS***

The acting in the film is all top notch.  In the last few years Nicolas Cage has starred in films that were terrible(Bangkok Dangerous, Wicker Man) or just mediocre(Ghost Rider, Next).  He seems to take projects that seem intersting on paper, but just turn out be less then the some of its parts on film.  He has reclaimed his niche in this film.  He is very good doing three things that most of his parts require him to do, be an intelligent man, an every man, and bugg eyed and mad.  He makes the trasitions natural.  Every emotion rings true, and it's been awhile since I've seen this from him.  The final scene almost had me choked up.  It really worked.  Of course, Marco Beltrami's score really adds to the overall effect.  Beltrami has scored many of Dimesnions low-budget horror flicks over the years, but I've always felt his scores were interchangeable.  This one sticks out and it's very good.

The special effects are excellent.  And once again, I find myself writing a review about a film with hi-tech special effects, but isn't about them.  What's going on in Hollywood?  Are they actually waking up?  Particularly, the plane crash sequence, the same glimpsed in the trailer, is extremely effective and creepy.  It manages to be terrifying, and surreal all at once.  Cage's performance is also spot on, as he plays disoriented and shocked as he tries to save burning victims escaping the wreckage of the crash.  This scene will be stuck in my brain for awhile.

Why not 5 stars, you may be asking?  Well, I had two minor complaints with the film.  Firstly, there is a lot of focus made on shiny black stones throughout the film.  They are handed to characters as well as appearing as various points in the plot.  When they're origin is revealed, I'm afraid I didn't find their importance or impact on the goings-on to very important.  It was like they were vague red-herrings without a major point.  I could be wrong.  Maybe they have a symbolic meaning that I missed.  If so, I would love to hear your, dear readers, point of view or opinions.  Finally, I felt Nicolas Cage's family, sister and pastor father, became relevant to the story too late into the narrative.  They still have impact when they show up and the closure is brought, but I felt some more of them at the top would've been better.

The directing is top notch.  I've always been a fan of Alex Proyas(The Crow, Dark City, I-Robot, and the underrated Garage Days).  All his films contain visuals that don't leave the brain, with the exception of I-Robot, which had less impactful visuals then I had hoped for.  He paces the first half out languidly, sets up the characters and their dilemmas.  It's all up to the performers to keep you glued to the screen.  When the first disaster happesn, despite the trailer giving it away, it really hits you hard and unrelentinglly---surprised this one got passed with a PG-13 rating.  Some of the final visuals after the conclusion has played itself out are really striking as well.  The sound design of the film is really excellent too.  Lots of created ambient sounds that amp up the creep factor.  Whispering always seems to get to me, but mass whispering just drives me nuts---see the film if you want to specifically know what I'm talking about.

I myself am a proud atheist.  I find myself subscribing to the belief of not knowing, but have a hard time accepting a lot of life's explanations.  I'd prefer to stick with not knowing for now.  This film will appeal to those who think they know, and truly believe their is a preordained fate for us all, over-seen by an all knowing diety.  But it will also work for those want a clever sci-fi fantasy.  While my belief system tells  you where I take this film, I do appreciate the added value of it possibly meaning something else.  Plus, atheist or not, some religous imagery is just engrained into my psyche from growing up in this country, so they make great and dramatic filmic imagery.  Good stuff.

Finally, this film is for those of us out there that are sick of the carbon copy formula films without depth or ideas, the constant influx of remakes that bring nothing to the original film's narrative besides new fangled special effects, and it's not for those who don't like films that seem like one thing and then give you another.  This final point I will never understand.  It almost seems as though the modern movie-goer would be happier knowing everything about a film before it plays out.  The minute it side steps their narrow vision they turn off to its narrative.  I once read that before Robert Zemeckis released What Lies Beneath and Cast Away that he did a poll regarding the creationg the films' trailers.  He found that the public likes it when the trailer gives away most of the films major sequences and plot details.  They feel more comfortable and safe knowing all before the viewing.  Hence why in What Lies Beneath you knew that Harrison Ford's character had an affair with the ghost, but the film takes an hour for the main protagnist to figure it out.  We all knew from the trailer that Tom Hanks gets off the deserted island in Castaway.  Kind of took some of the drama out of the film.  I find this train of thought to be boring and sad.  Films like Knowing should be lauded.

The bottom line is that solar flares would really suck....The ending of the film manages to be both a bummer and hopeful at the same time.  Cetain characters do find solace and their own sense of closure.  What ultimately matters the most thrives and is justified.  You can learn just as much from a sad ending as you could from a happy one.  Basically, if you're one of those bums that didn't like The Mist because of its ending, please skip this film, and spare us your very sensitive and overly emotional reaction to a film that's about seen and unseen hope as it is about any of the many ideas it contains.",1238371200,11,8391,4.5684563758389265

Although it drags a bit during the buildup, the ending really pulls all the stops for effects, emotional string-pulling, and possible sequel-baiting.

A lot has already been said about the movie's premise, so I won't go there. Even more would spoil crucial plot surprises (and there are a bunch), so I won't go there either. That leaves me talked out faster than this enjoyable movie deserves. It successfully combines elements of the creepy thriller, omens-unrolling, supernatural, and catastrophe genres. Even if credibility hits a slick spot now and then, the over-all experience is what a movie-goer pays for: good entertainment.

3603946,5,B001GCUNZI,"I saw this one in the movies.  Nicholas Cage plays an excellent part in this 2009 movie release as the single father of a young boy who begins to get messages in numbers.  But, let's start at the beginning.

It is 1959 in a small Massachusetts town.  Lucinda Embry (age 10-ish) is staring at the sun in a strange way.  The brand new school has decided on a special project.  They are going to fill a time capsule with stuff, to be dug up in 50 years.  In the classroom, the students are all tasked to draw a picture for the time capsule.  Each picture is folded and sealed in an envelope.  Each envelope has the name of the child who drew the picture written on it.

As the other children are busy drawing pictures, Lucinda is writing numbers.  The flow from her pencil is very intense, very fast--It appears to be automatic writing.  But time is up, so the teacher, Ms. Priscilla Taylor, grabs all the papers for the capsule, including Lucinda's.  Lucinda was not finished writing her numbers.  Later, you find the police and everyone else scouring the school grounds looking for Lucinda.  She has disappeared, but is found in a closed, unharmed, but scratching on the door until her fingers are bloody. She says ""Make them stop, please.""

Fast forward 50 years, to 2009.  Nicholas Cage is Professor Kessler, an astrophysics teacher at MIT.  He has a son (age 10-ish?) named Kalum (or something like that).  Kalum's mom died and they both still miss her very much.  Of course, Kalum goes to the same school that Lucinda went to.  The 50 years are up and it's time to open the time capsule.  Priscilla Taylor is still around, looking quite elderly, so she is an intregal part of the celebration.  Ms. Taylor opens the capsule and each child gets an envelope to open.  Well, guess who gets Lucinda's envelope? (Hint-Kalum.)  Kalum sees all the numbers and even sees a figure in the distance.  He hears voices in his head, too.  Kalum takes the paper home even though he is supposed to leave it at the school.  Coincidently, his father just happens to start looking at the paper and sees some kind of pattern in the numbers.  Intrigued, the Professor begins to research dates on the computer and realizes that these are all dates of disasters around the world, including the numbers of people killed in each and the GIS coordinates of the locations where each happened.  There are 3 dates at the end that haven't happened yet.  Of course, the plot thickens here and off we go!

I found this a very interesting movie.  So far, everyone I know that has seen it has thoroughly enjoyed it.  I enjoyed the storyline and Nicholas Cage does a great job with the part.  (He always puts his heart and soul into a role.  Even when the movie he is in isn't good, Cage is always good.).  Anyway, this movie is great!",1237766400,2,2802,4.520958083832335

In this case, I've just returned home from the theater and felt compelled to write a review. Overall, the movie was rather exceptional, especially for a ""disaster flick."" Nicolas Cage was well-cast, the story was certainly compelling (albeit a bit quirky) and had all the qualities one might expect for this type of movie - great (if horrific) special effects, space aliens, articulate characters, sci-fi stuff, suspense, religious undertones, and much more.

The reason I've decided to review this movie now, however, is not because of its overall quality (more than likely 4 or 5 stars) but because of the horrendously interpreted butchering of Beethoven's 7th Symphony, which is one of the greatest works of music of all time. While I always enjoy the use of good (and, in this case, great) music in movies - something that can greatly enhance many movies (for example, I recently watched Master and Commander, on DVD for the zillionth time because the music, which included pieces by Bach, Mozart, Boccherini, etc. is exceptional - the Sydney Studio Orchestra, which played (not performed) Beethoven's 7th for Knowing was literally  one of the worst, most hideous butcherings of the piece I've ever been subjected to. While the selection of Beethoven for specific scenes seemed to be somewhat appropriate, the horrendous slaughtering of it distracted so much from the movie that I'm going to have to listen to real performances of it, by real orchestras, before calling it a night in order to detox from the movie. While the second movement of Beethoven's Symphony # 7 is one of most sublime, powerful, and deeply moving masterpieces of all time, the Sydney Studio Orchestra played it so fast that it felt as if it were Rossini's William Tell Overture: need I say more?

So, if you're a musician or a music lover, my suggestion would be that you take a bathroom break or get some popcorn the moment you recognize the Beethoven: I promise, you'll be glad you did and the movie will be far more enjoyable.",1237680000,4,2173,4.899456521739131
3603949,3,B001GCUNZI,"KNOWING is a film that tries to do too much.  It is a numerology film that attempts to impute cosmic significance to long series of numbers that purport to show present and future accidents and calamities--sort of a movie version of THE BIBLE CODE.  It is a ET-oriented film that shows space aliens in a manner that Spielberg envisioned in that these aliens have constantly morphing bodies and fly in spaceships that avoid the traditional cigar or saucer shape in favor of a vessel that morphs its physical form as easily as do its occupants.  And it is an end-of-the-world actioner that suggests that our tenure on earth is likely to come to a premature close. The problem here is that it never decides definitively in which direction to go.  It starts off on a numerology note as Nicholas Cage examines a sheet of numbers written by a little girl fifty years ago and buried in a time capsule. He soon learns that each set of numbers corresponds to a date of a horrific catastrophe and the number of fatalities involved. So far so good.  Just this alone is more than enough cinematic grist for the mill.  Unfortunately, the movie inexplicably drifts into the realm of alien contact with non-speaking, leather-raincoated strangers attempting to kidnap Cage's son all the while ""whispering"" to his mind and allowing him to see apocalyptic visions of a near future in which the world is burning.  Finally, it drifts into a weirdly blended kaleidescopic mixture of all three that relates to how these numbers connect to a picture of Nostradamus reaching out his hands to touch the sun.  There are plenty of special effects thrills along the way including a plane crash and a train derailment that have to be seen to be believed. There are too many questions posed that remain unanswered.  This in itself is not always a bad thing but I got the feeling that some--like the ubiquitous little black stones--were inserted merely to emphasize the weirdness of the entire plot mechanism. Then there is the acting of Nicholas Cage.  This is the second consecutive film in which he can foretell the future.  In both cases, he plays a character who seems overly stunned at his ability to do so and spends the bulk of both roles as one who has a monomaniacal mission to prove his thesis.  The result is that we tend to see him as proving a point rather than entertaining an audience.  Thus, KNOWING ends as a movie in which we are knowing the plot but not feeling it.",1237680000,3,2454,4.665893271461717
3603950,5,B001GCUNZI,"What a deeply spiritual film about love and trust! Love between parents and children, and the mercy extraterrestrial aliens have for human beings. It's also about trust in a Supreme Being (God). My favorite line in the entire movie is: ""This (Life) is not the end! and the reply,""I know!"" It's also about the ultimately ridiculous dichotomy between spirituality and science! What a brilliant and cathartic story!

One must be patient while watching Knowing. This is NOT a film for children, the faint of heart or someone looking for a good time! The story does not come together until the very end. There's also a lot of hysterics! How would any us react in such a desperate situation? Knowing, is about making personal sacrifices! It's not a story to make the viewer feel comfortable!

I could have done without the graphic violence of one disaster after another! But Knowing makes a point of not taking this life for granted and that one should live in the present as much as possible! The other obvious message is that loving relationships between people is the most important part of being human!

I was reminded while watching Knowing of my Astronomy professor, who said, ""Human beings would be like ants to an advanced extraterrestrial civilization. Why would they care about us?"" Maybe they would care about us! Knowing makes its case that it's certainly plausible!

Thank you Hollywood for making a mature Science Fiction film for an adult audience! It took a lot of courage to make a movie so deep in a world so crass and shallow!

3603951,5,B001GCUNZI,"""Knowing"" is in the same genre of ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"" -- a solid, creepy, smart, and ultimately satisfying mix of the supernatural and the seemingly ""everyday"".  Nicolas Cage is at his best, and the ending, while giving no spoilers, was (I believe) extremely satisfying, if a bit predictable.  I could have done without the absolute last scene -- it would have been better implied than overt.  But nonetheless, ""Knowing"" is a great moviegoing experience -- a smart, exciting mystery/syfy/thriller roller-coaster ride.  Highly recommended viewing (especially for M.

3603953,5,B001GCUNZI,"""Knowing"" achieves a level of greatness so few science fiction films ever achieve. It's not merely an engaging mystery--it's a deeply thought-provoking fable that's just as frightening as it is intelligent, and it ultimately makes a statement so profound that I was left completely awestruck. I don't often have an experience like that at the movies, and for that, I'm indebted to director Alex Proyas and writers Ryne Douglas Pearson, Juliet Snowden, Stiles White, and Stewart Hazeldine. They've successfully crafted one of the year's most stimulating films, taking the audience on a suspenseful, emotional, and ultimately (albeit unconventionally) redemptive journey that poses interesting questions on the nature of things. A movie like this could have easily placed technical achievement over character development, and thankfully, that didn't happen; we care just as much about the people as we do about the spectacular special effects.

The story begins in 1959, when an elementary school class is asked to draw pictures of what the world will look like fifty years later. What they draw will be put into a time capsule, which will be reopened in the year 2009. Rather than draw a picture, the quiet, disturbed Lucinda Embry (Lara Robinson) writes out a series of numbers on both the front and the back of a piece of paper.

Flash forward to the present day. We meet an MIT astrophysics professor named John Koestler (Nicholas Cage), who teaches his students that two theories on the nature of the universe have been proposed. On the one side, we have the determinist view, which states that everything happens as the result of a predetermined--and more importantly, a predictable--sequence of events. How, for example, could the Earth be located at just the correct distance from the sun to sustain life? On the other side, we have the random view, which states that absolutely nothing can be predicted, that life, the universe, and everything happened as the result of cosmic coincidences. What exactly does Koestler believe? Here are some clues: His wife died some years earlier, and he's openly stated that the existence of Heaven can't be proven.

As it so happens, John's young son, Caleb (Chandler Canterbury), goes to the same school that Lucinda Embry attended fifty years earlier. The day comes when the time capsule is unearthed and opened, and lo and behold, Caleb gets the envelope containing the numbers Lucinda wrote. He then takes it home, thinking the numbers might mean something. John initially thinks nothing of it ... until he places his wet glass of hard liquor on it and leaves a ring. Was it a predetermined act or a random act that led to a ring being formed around very specific numbers (the significance of which I won't reveal)? More important, was it a predetermined act or a random act that landed Caleb with the page of numbers in the first place? While I won't say what the numbers refer to (and this is in spite of the many ads that give plenty of hints), I will say that what John discovers changes him forever, forcing to consider ideas he never thought he would be able to consider.

To describe more of the plot would do you and the film a great disservice. Much of the story thrives on an engrossing mystery that only gets more unsettling with every passing scene. Visual motifs, such as shiny black pebbles, burning landscapes, and silhouetted figures emerging from the forest add great psychological weight. The same can be said for a house so old and ramshackle that, under different circumstances, it would be mistaken as being haunted. It ties in wonderfully with the psychological states of the characters inhabiting it. John is a solemn, broken man, estranged from his father, often detached from his son, occasionally dependent on a bottle of alcohol to drown his sorrows. Caleb is expectedly precocious but surprisingly fragile, always yearning for that which has been lost somewhere along the way. For the first time in a great while, we have a story that can actually support such characters; were it not for the awesome nature of the final fifteen minutes, John and Caleb would be nothing more than melodramatic clichs.

There are two more characters of great importance. One is Lucinda Embry's daughter, Diana Wayland (Rose Byrne), who enters John's life in a way that reaffirms the notion that nothing happens randomly. The other is Diana's daughter, Abby (also played by Lara Robinson), who, like Caleb, has been contacted by the creepy silhouetted figures, eventually called the Whispering People. Watch John and Diana as they search through Lucinda's abandoned home in the middle of the woods--the fear they express is disturbingly convincing.

Like last summer's ""The X-Files: I Want to Believe,"" ""Knowing"" is one of the best cinematic surprises of recent memory, a meaningful and absorbing allegory made with intention of challenging the audience in matters of spirituality. It's difficult to say whether or not this film takes a religious stance; that would depend on your own view of the nature of the universe. There are, however, a number of religious implications, the least subtle of which is revealed in the final shot. This might account for some early reviews, where words like ""overwrought"" and ""preposterous"" came up. From my perspective, those who feel that way have failed to look any deeper than what was presented in the ads, which only scratched the surface. Contrary to what trailers and TV spots have been promising, this is not your average science fiction thriller. Serious time, effort, and thought went into ""Knowing,"" one of the best films I've seen so far this year.",1237593600,169,5653,5.002125398512221
3603954,4,B001GCUNZI,"Initially I figured that the TV previews for Knowing had pretty much given away the majority of the plot; to summarize briefly what the trailers described, Nicolas Cage comes into possession of a list of numbers which predict the dates and death tolls of worldwide tragedies. I found the movie itself, however, to be surprisingly unpredictable from start to finish aside from already knowing the basic plot. There were very few times where I was able to guess what would happen next, keeping me in suspense and very much entertained by the dramatic and oftentimes quite intense scenes throughout the film. The special effects are stellar, and the storyline was great as well. As far as the acting, it wasn't particularly outstanding but for the most part Knowing had a well-selected cast. I'd give this film four, perhaps four and a half stars... definitely recommended.",1237507200,3,870,5.006896551724138
