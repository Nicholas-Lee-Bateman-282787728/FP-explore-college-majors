7793803,5,0965381862,"My third graders and I have just finished the Notes Alive video for On the Day you Were Born.  We are all amazed. This was a superbly done video with  excellent graphics and accompaniment.  I can't begin to describe the looks  on my students' faces as we watched the book come alive with such a  brilliant video.  I've attended one of Debra's workshops and was delighted  to have an opportunity to share this adventure with my students.  The book  and tape are an excellent learning tool for any age student - preschoolers  to adult! As a culminating activity, we are illustrating what we think the  earth looked like on the day we were all born. Thank you Notes Alive and  thank you Debra Frasier.",967161600,11,698,4.540322580645161
