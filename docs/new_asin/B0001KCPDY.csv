8013555,5,B0001KCPDY,Home brew copy but better than nothing. Wish it could be better quality for such an important Brecht story but there wasn't the will in the entertainment biz to do it right,1369526400,,172,4.40625
8013556,5,B0001KCPDY,"This is one of my favorite movies in the 'charming and sweet' categories. The ending is a little too pat and predictable, but never mind, that was then. I can't believe there's no DVD for it either.

I didn't know there was a VHS.... I saw it in a movie house many years ago and the film itself was not of very high quality, so any VHS copy couldn't be any better than the original.",1296864000,,382,4.093333333333334
8013557,5,B0001KCPDY,"Sweet, simple, moving, funny, well acted French film of an elderly woman `finding' herself after her husband's death, and the struggle her family has in accepting and dealing with the new her.  Quietly subversive, it's based on a story by Brecht.

While we're set up to expect a tragic tale of an old woman widowed and alone, instead we're treated to a wonderfully life affirming saga of how it's never too late to change, to grow, and to become young in spirit.  A great theme song, too.

The saddest thing is that such a wonderful (and well loved) film is so hard to find. This best I've been able to do is this very rough quality VHS tape from some years back.  This minor classic is worthy of far better.  None-the-less the film is good enough, that if your local, hipper video store has a copy, it's worth a rental, or buying a copy if your vhs player is still working and one shows up here or elsewhere.  (BTW, the other reviewer refers to an a low rent DVD copy, and I concur that whatever they got was probably pirated.  I've never been able to find a legit DVD release)  On the other hand, the VHS tape appears to be 'official', just not very good.",1279065600,3,1157,4.344186046511628
8013558,1,B0001KCPDY,"Amazon is selling this product as a new original and genuine DVD, which is not. This is a frudulent DVD produced by a company that copies and sells pirated merchandise. I'm amazed that Amazon is selling this product. Not only the copy is illegal, but it's also incredibly bad. I haven't checked my card statement yet, but I hoped that they returned my money after I sent the DVD back. Shame on you Amazon!",1205971200,4,405,4.486486486486487
