8054003,3,B0007YJGNQ,"The DVD is in French, both the talking and writing.  Listening in English is by way of voice overs.  You can still hear the French conversation in the background with a female voice translating to English.  If you want a good example of what I am talking about I refer you to the origional Blade Runner movie.  Since the parts that I have watched so far only use men, I find it a little distracting that they use a female voice.  Also, they do not always translate some of the written text.  I am giving it three stars because the voice overs to English may not bother some people.",1518307200,,581,4.284403669724771

8054006,3,B0007YJGNQ,"I was somewhat disappointed by the DVD
First of all, it is labeled all regions, which is not true. You ought to have a special DVD player to watch it. Secondly, with more than ten (10) years of formal training in martial arts, I was expecting better than that regarding self defense.

Three (3) stars.",1203897600,,301,4.472727272727273
8054007,5,B0007YJGNQ,"This is by far the BEST self-defense DVD I have ever seen! This DVD taches you real street self-defense that is easy to learn and practiccal for stree use. This is the only DVD I've ever seen where they teach you with multipy angles and in slow motion. They also teach you multiple strikes, which is exactly what you need to do to win against any attacker on the street!! This DVD was as good a special forces traing in hand to hand combat training class. Buy this DVD , you will learn so much from one little DVD. I only wish they made a whole series of these DVD's!",1182211200,12,567,4.163636363636364
