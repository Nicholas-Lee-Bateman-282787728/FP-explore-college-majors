3078509,2,B00127RAIK,"Unearthed, another disappointment from the second round of the After Dark Horror Fest, is a pure creature feature with piles of blood and gore thrown on for good measure.  Too bad that Unearthed is a dim-witted and cliched ride for the most part that borrows way too heavily from other (and better) films of the genre.  Emmanuelle Vaugier (Saw II, CSI: NY) stars as an alcoholic sheriff who, along with a handful of others, runs afoul of a bloodthirsty beast that looks like a cross between the Xenomorphs from the Alien franchise and the monsters from Feast.  And while Unearthed is derivative as can be, it does manage to be a little bit enjoyable, and the gore effects are very nicely done.  However, Unearthed ends up going down the predictable route as the film moves forward, and the cast (including Hellboy II's Luke Goss, Charlie Murphy, and MC Gainey) don't do themselves any favors either.  All in all, you'll see much worse monster flicks in your life, but in the end, Unearthed, like most of the rest of the After Dark Horror Fest lineup, just isn't worth the trip.",1221091200,,1077,4.677248677248677

3078511,2,B00127RAIK,"After watching three of this year's After Dark Horrorfest films it's very apparent that this year's batch is a few cuts below last year's and Unearthed does nothing to raise the grade.  An archaeological dig in a remote New Mexico town releases a creature that's been trapped for 900 years and it soon begins preying on the town's residents and the only road out of town has been blocked by a fuel tanker accident.  Hmm, small desert town, residents trapped, a creature feasting on them...yeah, seen it before.  It was called Tremors and it was vastly superior.

The town's regular residents include alcoholic sheriff Annie Flynn (Vaugier), Rancher Rob Horn (Gainey) Scientist Nodin and her grandfather (Means).  A few passing motorists also find themselves trapped in the little town, all there to buy gas from the service station run by Grandpa.  As Nodin tries to analyze the creature's alien DNA and find a means to kill it, Sheriff Flynn attempts to keep the rest of the survivors alive and one step ahead of the beast.  I'd love to tell you what the creature looks like but that's somewhat difficult.  We get only fleeting glimpses of the thing as it dashes by the camera.  On top of that, much of the film takes place at night with those green glow sticks as the only source of illumination.  It sort of looks like the Xenophobes from ""Aliens"" but done in poor CGI.  Director Leutwyler borrows liberally from numerous other films including Descent, Relic, and Reeker.  In fact you'd be hard pressed to find one original idea in the entire film.

Nodin eventually figures out some sort of voodoo scientific solution about the characters DNA and making a poison from uranium but by that time, I was nodding off and only wanted the film to come to a merciful end.  Vaugier usually is able to give a bit of a spark to some of the low-budget films she's been in but seems completely bored here.  I didn't buy her role as a guilt-stricken, alcoholic sheriff at all.  Frankly she looked just too good.  Gainey is a great character actor but he seemed out of place.

Leutwyler also loves doing that thing with the camera where he has it shake and bounce during some of the monster's attack scenes, presumably to make it seem more real and get the feel for the attack.  It's a novelty trick that doesn't work and this, along with the choppy editing, only serves to annoy the viewer and make the creature even harder to see.

With three down and only one more for me to review, my hopes are fading fast for finding one good film in this year's group of Horrorfest releases.  Borderland, please save the day!

Extras

This is another grip about this years Horrofest films.  Half of them have no special features at all except for the Miss Horrorfest webisodes.",1214179200,22,2756,4.635051546391753
3078512,4,B00127RAIK,"After reading the initial reviews here at Amazon I skipped seeing this film. When I did finally see Unearthed, I was impressed. Sure, a person could go back and see ""Alien"" or ""Aliens"" for the 20th time ... but why not explore how others may create the ""Alien Genre"".  In the case of Unearthed, it is a rather good exploration of the alien topic.  Good acting, good alien monster, reasonable gore, very watchable, far better camera work than ""Cloverfield"", mildly creative plot and dollar-for-dollar a better movie than AVP 2. Movies like ""Alien"" only comes around once a decade. No point wishing all sci-fi films were that good, they never can be. It is just too much too ask Hollywood to be that creative. Unearthed is a very watchable sci-fi thriller for tonight ... you might even be tempted to watch it again some hot summer night when you wonder
why the mighty Anasazi Native Americans mysteriously disappeared ... which they surely did.",1211673600,,943,4.779141104294479
3078513,2,B00127RAIK,"I had high hopes for this one...I thought it would be at least decent.  I watched the first hour and my boyfriend and I both fell asleep.  When we finished the movie later, we were disappointed.  The creature looks sooooo fake.  The first time it really shows it when it jumps on the back of the truck I busted out laughing.  Before that, I still thought it could be good.  But it didn't get any better.  I had read that it was a cross between tremors and alien...well, yea, it looks like a second hand version of the aliens in alien, and, yea, this comes underground...but it just didn't work.  I think Tremors is 10 times better, but that just might be because I've always loved Tremors.  And Alien...well, lets be serious...this just doesn't compete.  So far the one I have disliked the most out of the horrorfest.",1209081600,,817,4.45945945945946
3078514,2,B00127RAIK,"Every Saturday night the Sci Fi Channel has a movie at 9, or 8:oopm Central time if you live in Omaha.  Unearthed would be a typical Sci Fi Channel Saturday night movie.  It is watchable but kind of hokie and a film that you really don't want to pay money to see.  This one will be on Sci Fi no doubt in the not too distant future.  If you absolutely can't wait, go ahead and rent it.  This is not one to buy though for sure.  The creature is not very good and the acting isn't much better.  The characters have nothing in the way of development.  The alcoholic sheriff looks pretty darn young and attractive to be as pathetic a figure as she is supposed to be.  And how do you consume that much liquor and still manage to function at that level anyway?  Oh well, none of the latest films from the afterdark horrorfest have been that scary so far.  I haven't seen them all yet, but ...well, this is about Unearthed.  Watch it so you can say you watched it.  No other reason.",1207094400,,974,4.172043010752688
3078515,4,B00127RAIK,"Having liked both the above mentioned titles, I don't see how you could not like this little film.  Granted, the budget wasn't as big as ""Alien"" so the CGI beastie looks a bit fake from time to time.  But, the kills were great and there was just enough blood to keep the kid in me saying ""Cool!"".  This works great as a DVD horror title.  Have an open mind and just enjoy the flick.  But can someone explain to me why Luke Goss has a facial tattoo?",1206230400,4,448,4.103448275862069

3078517,2,B00127RAIK,"""Unearthed,"" the second of the 8 Films 2 Die 4 from Horrorfest 2007 I am checking out on DVD, is a dormant monster brought to live to kill (almost) everybody in the movie type of movie.  The setting is a desolate New Mexico town, so isolated that an oil tanker can turn over and block what is apparently the only road out of town.  Equally important to the plot, the oil tanker was coming to deliver gasoline to the place run by Grandpa (Russell Means), which means the bad news for the people who show up in the first part of the movie is that there is no gasoline for them to get out of town.  The good news is that all of the women in this small town in New Mexico are big time babes.  But then there is the really bad news that a monster has been, well, unearthed.

Our heroine is Sheriff Annie Flynn (Emmanuelle Vaugier of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saw-II/dp/B000CRR31U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saw II</a>), who has an incident in her past that everybody is always making veiled references to; in fact, when Grandpa does not bring up the incident, Annie does herself, before going back to drinking to forget what everybody keeps alluding to.  It gets to the point where you expect the strangers who show up to be fodder for the creature to all know about this incident as well.  By the time the deep dark secret (that everybody knows about) is revealed, I was totally apathetic.  Caya (Beau Garrett of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Turistas/dp/B000N3AW6G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Turistas</a>""), Ally (Whitney Able), and Nodine (Tonantzin Carmelo), are other babes on the menu, whith Nodine being the important one since she is not only Grandpa's granddaughter, but also a botanist.  Yes, it is strange that a botanist would be of big help in explaining the monster in a monster movie, but that is part of what attempts to make this monster different.

I noted that once people started dying that there was not a whole lot of discussion about what was happening, although I suppose it does make sense to a certain extent not to engage in conversation while fleeing.  But then we get to a scene where there is an explosion of exposition (who knew that pictographs could be so detailed?).  The most interesting character int he story is Kale (Luke Goss), a tattooed archeologist who is sort of Mulder and Scully wrapped into one as he is out there digging alone to prove his Anaszi ancestors were wiped out by something more personal than drought.  Most of his dialogue comes in the exposition scene, and you are never sure if he is crazier than he is smart or the other way around.  But you know full well that the last man standing in this horror movie is going to be a woman, so you take his presence with a  grain of blood-soaked salt.

I was stunned that ""Unearthed"" was made by writer-director Matthew Leutwyler because I had absolutely loved his previous film, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dead-and-Breakfast/dp/B000A3DGEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dead and Breakfast</a>,"" which I thought should have been the next great midnight movie in the ""Rocky Horror"" tradition.  Of course I realize that you cannot make a career out of zombie musicals and it is not like Leutwyler should not be trying to make serious horror films (remember, Steven Spielberg's first World War II movie was neither ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saving-Private-Ryan/dp/B00001ZWUS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saving Private Ryan</a>"" nor ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Schindler-s-List/dp/B00012QM8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Schindler's List</a>,"" for which he won Oscars as Best Director, but the raucous comedy ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1941/dp/0783231032/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1941</a>"").  But there is nothing memorable about this film, which like way too many films these days suffers from the overuse the hand held camera.  Beyond that, ""Unearthed"" comes across as a film cobbled together from bits and pieces of other films.  I was thinking that you could take the end of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Duel/dp/B000063UR5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Duel</a>,"" most of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Feast/dp/B000GLL1U6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Feast</a>,"" and some moments from ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien/dp/B00011V8IQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien</a>,"" and edit together a better movie than this one.  Across the board ""Unearthed"" comes up with too little in the blood, gore, suspense, shock, and any other department you want to mention from the horror film checklist.  The net result is a horror film that avoids being offensive, but has nothing to particularly recommend it to fans of the genre.

The only bonus feature on the DVD are the Miss Horrorfest Contest webepisodes, which are included on all of the DVDs in this round of the After Dark Horrorfest (good to know that a scream queen can actually scream).  The absence of any extras besides the standard choice between English and Spanish subtitles squelched any second thoughts about rounding up instead of down on this one.

3078518,4,B00127RAIK,"I saw this film last year at the Tribecca Film festival and was quite pleased with the production value. Apparently it was pretty low budget, but with the special effects, and stunts (explosions etc.) the film makers definitely got their monies worth. The characters are also extremely rich for a horror film, which I found refreshing. Not the same old teen, sexy, slash em up film. This film actually has mystery and character development. Charlie Murphy is also quite humorous in it as well. This one is definitely worth seeing.",1205452800,4,530,4.9

The sound also up and down so constantly needing to turn volume up or down, makes this not very fun. The characters were o.k. & acting of them o.k. I DID like seeing Native Americans in a Movie at all as they are sadly always missing from all Movies. That fact gave it 1 star extra. Defeating this monster with radiation is a strange way to me b/c the humans would die also...so that made no sense but the worst thing of the whole Movie to me was the few trying to escape constantly getting vehicles that run out of gas when there were plenty of vehicles around.

3078732,1,B00127RAIK,"I had to read the reviews after watching this to find out what I had just watched.  The plot as described sounds like it might have been a good movie if I'd have been able to see what was going on in the dark and hear what was being said.  I had the volume up loud enough to disturb my neighbors but I still couldn't hear much dialogue.  I had no problems hearing all the sound effects and the horrible, monotonous ""music"" effects.  Maybe if a decent director was in charge of this, and real producers, and they could get a good sound crew and lighting technicians, then this might be a fairly decent movie.  I'm not going to hold my breath on that, though.  I certainly won't be watching this one again!  I'm ashamed to admit that I watched it the first time!",1480464000,2,760,4.236111111111111

3078921,1,B00127RAIK,"I've been waiting to give a rating on this cheap and pathetic movie after about halfway through the movie.  Please interpret my 1 star as a negative 5 star.  I didn't start with high expectations but did expect that it'll be your typical low budget movie with mediocre acting and semi-humorous sci fi effects.  I was curious to see the ""unearthed"" creature and how the cast will battle against it.  BE WARNED:  you won't see it...you won't see anything for that matter.  Very seldom do you get a movie so poorly made that most of the movie is in the dark, so dark you can't see much.  Now, if you are legally blind and just listening to the sounds, then you might give it a better rating than me.  But if you want to watch a movie with the expecting of seeing something on your screen, move on.  Don't get me wrong, there are well-lit parts of the movie but that only entails actors talking to each other.

A tanker filled with gasoline has an accident and catches fire.  When she walks by the cab of the truck, all of the tires are in good shape as well as the paint on the cab.

Plenty of characters to be victims, no character is really safe, and there are some good tension moments. There was plenty of blood, some explosions, and decent gore.

The creature effects were almost made for television level CGI. The acting was so so. Story was so so. At one point they had plenty of cute girls and a cute boy but no hanky panky or nudity.. Also, some of the characters were just stereotypes which isn't necessarily a movie sin. I think the sheriff, hot power fem with a dark past and alcoholism, got on my nerves worst of all.

When they found the green glow sticks they could have used a couple of cases not just one stick.
I am not commenting on the acting, I think it could have been a good movie if someone cared about it when it was made. I would have given it zero stars if t that was possible.",1474329600,2,623,3.7557251908396947

3079711,4,B00127RAIK,"And I actually have watched it twice and would watch it again. I saw things in it the second time around that I didn't see in the first viewing. I am particularly intrigued by the use of darkness and light in the movie. Another element that stood out in the second viewing was the abuse of an American Indian girl by a white man, which is a real problem on Indian reservations. That incident acts as a kind of foreshadowing of the ultimate doom carried out by the creature. Of course, this is often a theme in ""monster"" moves--that these monsters are some kind of divine retribution for or manifestation of the meanness of humans. It is always interesting to see which characters actually make it through the movie to the end. This movie ended somewhat differently than might be expected.

Finally, the movie has two of my favorite actors: Russell Means and Emmanuelle Vaugier. Because Russell Means has now passed, seeing him in any movie is a treat. And Emmanuelle Vaugier just has an intriguing look in every part that I have seen her in. I found the acting to be quite entertaining. As with many movies, most characters are stereotypes. And this movie may have a bit of tongue-in-cheek associated with the genre. But the lines were delivered in a believable way: The actors sounded like they were actually talking to each other and not just reciting lines.

If you like monster movies and have an hour and a half to spare, I recommend that you check this out. It is definitely action packed and has some interesting characters to boot. By the way, the movie was filmed in Utah.",1444003200,4,1581,4.602836879432624

3079964,4,B00127RAIK,"I live for good monster movies.  This one purported to be one.  Unfortunately, it had an inauspicious beginning featuring a series of electric flashes, stray images, scenes indistinguishable, layered amongst the credits.  All of it was confusing and did nothing to introduce the story, which is about the `unearthing' of a creature/monster with bad intentions.  Then there's an off screen crash of a gas tanker which neatly traps everyone on the other side of the highway.  There's nowhere to go but back and no way to do that without gas.  We quickly learn that the town drunk is their sheriff (Emmanuelle Vaugier).  Cattle are being killed, people are disappearing, and there's a tattooed yahoo excavating.  All of that spells trouble for the few people trapped in the middle of nowhere, bent on ruining the few workable vehicles they have left to them.
That's a pretty basic premise to deal with and hard to screw up, especially considering just how many films have successfully based their story on that exact formula.  And yes, this film has some very stylish photography when you can see it.  Too bad they decided to film most of the action at night with the aid of flashlights, glow sticks, an explosion or two, but little else.  Seriously, what's the point in designing a potentially interesting creature if you can't quite make it out when they even bother to give it any screen time.  The few glimpses they allowed are barely enough to pique one's interest.  I was left wanting more.  I will say it's decently paced, the acting isn't bad, the dialog isn't hopeless.  People are excoriated by the truckload, and quickly.  But it's so dark I could barely see any of it.  Still, I liked it well enough to keep it for future viewings.",1410134400,,1740,4.765886287625418

3079988,3,B00127RAIK,"Like a number of the ""8 Films to Die For,"" this entry in the original 2007 series leaves something to be desired.  I got excited when I saw that Charlie Murphy landed a role in the film, but, unfortunately, Unearthed leaves him little room to be funny.  Yes, I know this is a horror movie, but I've found that a little dark humor can sometimes make this kind of clich&eacute;d, formulaic B-movie a little less painful to watch.  The only laughs you might get out of Unearthed come at the expense of the CGI monster, and those aren't the kind of laughs you want in a horror movie.  The CGI isn't all bad overall, as some of the close-up shots of the monster (apparently a blood relative of the monster in Alien) play out pretty effectively, but the long-range views, especially those showing the monster in motion, pretty much scream the word fake.  While I'm criticizing this brainchild of writer/director Matthew Leutwyler, I also have to point to a number of unanswered questions, inadequately developed subplots, significant leaps in logic, and plenty of self-produced fodder for the likes of a Mystery Science Theater 3000.  One of my favorite moments comes during the lead-in to the film's final act, when a character who was previously at a loss to explain what was going on suddenly lays out the entire story for us in great detail.

The last thing Sheriff Annie Flynn (Emmanuelle Vaugier) needs is the unleashing of some ancient alien killing machine on four legs into her relatively quiet desert community.  She's already haunted by a tragic accident that will surely cost her her job when the townsfolk have their say at a town meeting scheduled for next week; she's well on her way to becoming a bona fide alcoholic; and she has never gotten the respect she deserves just because she's a female - and rather an attractive one, at that.  She is also very young, which made it hard for this viewer to really accept her as a full-blown sheriff (if we extrapolate using Vaugier's age, she would have become sheriff at the tender age of twenty-seven).  Getting back to the monster, he is basically an old Indian legend unearthed and brought back into the world by a rogue Indian archaeologist (they thought he was mad at the university) who wanted to prove that his people were indeed all but decimated centuries ago by a monstrous creature.  I think we can all agree that he definitely proved his point.

Alongside the sheriff, our list of would-be survivors includes two blondes and a hitchhiker they picked up along the way to California, a businessman (Charlie Murphy) who - like the other strangers - is stranded there because the gas truck that was supposed to replenish the tanks crashed several miles down the road (and the next town in this desert landscape is well over a hundred miles away); a young botanist who came back home to help take care of her Native American grandfather, and - of course - the idiot who unearthed the monster in the first place.  They spend most of the movie fleeing from one place to another in diminishing numbers as the monster takes them out one by one.  By the time they finally come up with an appropriately cockamamie way to stop the thing, you start to wonder if anyone is going to be left to actually execute the plan.  Don't worry too much, though, because you probably won't care a lot about any of the characters (although I must admit I was seriously rooting for Charlie Murphy to survive).

I guess the film gets a little gory in places, but it's certainly not enough to land Unearthed on any gorehound's list of must-sees.  In fact, there's really nothing special about this film at all, which is why I'm giving it three stars - a rating which is probably a little generous on my part given all of the film's plot holes and logical leaps.  Unearthed won't bore you to tears, but it's not really going to get your heart pumping, either.",1282003200,,3894,4.6351744186046515

3079991,1,B00127RAIK,"Unearthed (Matthew Leutwyler, 2007)

There was a time when I would have said that the great Russell Means lent a little class to every movie in which he appears. That time, unfortunately, has now passed forever with Unearthed, the latest outing for Dead and Breakfast director Matthew Leutwyler. Now, this is not Russell Means' fault by any stretch of the imagination, but it's depressing to see that he's no longer batting a thousand.

Plot: Annie Flynn (Emanuelle Vaugier), an alcoholic sheriff in a small southwestern town, is going to be forced out in a week after the town holds a no-confidence election. She's managed to hang onto her job for a year after the incident that caused the town to lose faith in her (and her to lose faith in herself), but everyone's lost patience. So, needless to say, something earth-shattering has to happen in that last week to give herback her confidence and let the town see her as a savior. Of course, that is, if anyone's left in the town by the time the mysterious, seemingly supernatural killer (this isn't a spoiler, we see what's happening in the opening scene; the only suspense there is what it is) is through eating its way through them.

As is usually the case with films picked up by the guys who run the After Dark Horrorfest, this wasn't actually a movie that was too scary for theaters; it's a movie that was so mediocre, even by the standards of the crap Hollywood's been churning out and calling ""horror"" for the past decade or so, that no studio would pick it up for distribution. Unearthed stands apart from the usual Horrorfest fare in that there's actually some starpower to be found here; former model Vaugier has recently been taking a turn on TV's CSI:NY, while male lead Luke Goss should be familiar from Blade II. But it's the supporting cast who'll really wow you--aside from the great Means, you've also got M. C. Gainey, Beau Garrett, Whitney Able, and other folks who, if their names don't look familiar, their faces will. Shouldn't surprise you, then, that the acting is above average for a Horrorfest outing. Problem is, the acting isn't enough to carry the ridiculous script, which combines the worst parts of seven or eight Sci-Fi Channel Original Movies without taking any of the good from them. (See how much this movie has addled my brain? I'm conceding there may be something good in Sci-Fi Channel Original Movies.) Given a few original twists, or Leutwyler allowing someone better to write the script, this might have been a good movie. Of course, had that happened, it wouldn't have been a Horrorfest movie. Sometimes, you really can judge a movie by its cover (and its distribution company). *",1242950400,2,2674,4.758620689655173

Are you a fan of the After Dark Horror movies but feel that some of them don't live up to expectations?  This is definitely one of the top installments to avoid.  The only way I could fathom this movie being any worse was if it had a lot lower budget and the creature was some halloween costume from Wal-Mart.  Actually maybe that would have made it more amusing.  Unfortunately this doesn't make the so-good-it's-bad list either.  Just boring all around.  Skip it.,1241740800,,583,4.592233009708738

Some of the moments of action were really good.  The tragic backstory of the sheriff sort of petered out though. And everything was really dark and hard to see. Overall, despite all these complaints the movie was not horrible, but not super great either.",1239321600,2,416,4.621621621621622
3079994,3,B00127RAIK,"If you've seen Alien, Tremors, Invasion of the Body Snatchers and The Thing, you've pretty much seen this movie before and it's been done better.

I don't hate this film but there is really nothing that distinguishable about it that sets it above some of the titles I've already listed.  The creature itself looks a lot like Alien, actually it's entire head is almost the exact replica.  I'm sure if HR Giger knew there would be a lawsuit pending.

The plot revolves around this ""creature"" terrorizing a small village and primarily a plant scientist and her father.  A dig has unearthed this title creature and it is now lose.  We are told in the film that it's over 900 years old and it's up to our crack crew of ""heros"" including a drunk female sheriff, the scientist, the indian father and some passerbys that can't leave the area due to a truck blocking the highway, one of the earlier kills of the creature.

Generally that's it.  I can't highly recommend this unless you just want to kill about 90 mins of your time and you have nothing else to do.  Again this movie was not horrible but it certainly is not original but if you have some friends that like horror and you want to have a movie festival of bad films, this would be one you might like to include.  Don't expect greatness but it is entertaining.",1232323200,,1313,4.4789915966386555
3079995,3,B00127RAIK,"I saw _Unearthed_ on the Sci Fi Channel recently as one of its Sci Fi movies of the week (usually every Saturday night and sometimes on Sunday night). Though in years past they had been unwatchable and awful I think the last two years they had considerably improved in terms of casting, acting, writing, production values, and special effects. Heck even the titles have gotten more sophisticated; it used to endlessly amuse my friends and I that it wasn't hard to guess what _Ogre_ or _Basilisk_ was about.

 The premise of this movie was pretty good. There is a small town in the American Southwest, the site of some mysterious dig in Anasazi ruins, a dig that unearths something awful, something alive. We don't know much about what is uncovered at first but it is terrible and the creature unleashed kills the driver of a tanker trunk of much needed gas for the town's apparently only filling station, destroying the truck and blocking the road. The townsfolk, mostly ranchers, and a few people passing through the area are stranded, at first merely upset at the inconvenience but later worried as something is killing livestock and then people.

 It is up to the town's sheriff, Annie Flynn, played rather well by the attractive Emmanuelle Vaugier, to investigate. She is apparently something of an alcoholic, not because she is a worthless individual but because she is still dealing with stress and grief from some un-discussed (at first) trauma in her recent past involving a little girl and a hostage situation. Most in the town dislike her, saying openly to her face that they will gladly vote her out of her job at the next town meeting (there are overtones of sexism too). Annie acknowledges this but still says she has a job to do and with her loyal deputy does the best she can to calm the townsfolk and find out what is afoot. She does have a few supporters, including the grandfatherly Native American man who owns the filing station and his visiting botanist daughter who is there ostensibly to help her grandfather but really still doing research (thus explaining the useful lab equipment at the gas station that come to such good use later).

 The movie becomes basically a story of the scientist trying to understand the creature and find a way to defeat it (its background, while underdeveloped, I have to admit was interesting) while in other scenes Annie tries to keep the townsfolk and travelers alive and kill the monster.

 The monster special effects were pretty good though the creature could have been shown more often. I think they still have problems making CGI creations really ""live"" in a physical environment with sets and actors, probably part of the reason why these movies tend to gravitate towards flying creatures (look at all the Sci Fi Channel movies of the week involving gargoyles, sphinxes, gryphons, pterosaurs, and dragons). At times it still didn't seem part of the same world but I think they have made great strides in that area.

 The movie does have its flaws. I thought some of the characters were a bit underdeveloped or even stereotypical, such as the very loyal, over earnest deputy, the hateful, boastful, arrogant, sexist rancher tycoon, and the urbanite African-American traveler. The person doing the dig, the one who uncovered the creature, and his motives was very undeveloped and I thought the weakest thing about the movie. He came off as a bit  crazy with unclear motives, not like any real scientist I have ever heard of.",1224806400,,3485,4.830536912751678
3313006,2,B00127RAIK,"Unearthed, another disappointment from the second round of the After Dark Horror Fest, is a pure creature feature with piles of blood and gore thrown on for good measure.  Too bad that Unearthed is a dim-witted and cliched ride for the most part that borrows way too heavily from other (and better) films of the genre.  Emmanuelle Vaugier (Saw II, CSI: NY) stars as an alcoholic sheriff who, along with a handful of others, runs afoul of a bloodthirsty beast that looks like a cross between the Xenomorphs from the Alien franchise and the monsters from Feast.  And while Unearthed is derivative as can be, it does manage to be a little bit enjoyable, and the gore effects are very nicely done.  However, Unearthed ends up going down the predictable route as the film moves forward, and the cast (including Hellboy II's Luke Goss, Charlie Murphy, and MC Gainey) don't do themselves any favors either.  All in all, you'll see much worse monster flicks in your life, but in the end, Unearthed, like most of the rest of the After Dark Horror Fest lineup, just isn't worth the trip.",1221091200,,1077,4.677248677248677

3313008,2,B00127RAIK,"After watching three of this year's After Dark Horrorfest films it's very apparent that this year's batch is a few cuts below last year's and Unearthed does nothing to raise the grade.  An archaeological dig in a remote New Mexico town releases a creature that's been trapped for 900 years and it soon begins preying on the town's residents and the only road out of town has been blocked by a fuel tanker accident.  Hmm, small desert town, residents trapped, a creature feasting on them...yeah, seen it before.  It was called Tremors and it was vastly superior.

The town's regular residents include alcoholic sheriff Annie Flynn (Vaugier), Rancher Rob Horn (Gainey) Scientist Nodin and her grandfather (Means).  A few passing motorists also find themselves trapped in the little town, all there to buy gas from the service station run by Grandpa.  As Nodin tries to analyze the creature's alien DNA and find a means to kill it, Sheriff Flynn attempts to keep the rest of the survivors alive and one step ahead of the beast.  I'd love to tell you what the creature looks like but that's somewhat difficult.  We get only fleeting glimpses of the thing as it dashes by the camera.  On top of that, much of the film takes place at night with those green glow sticks as the only source of illumination.  It sort of looks like the Xenophobes from ""Aliens"" but done in poor CGI.  Director Leutwyler borrows liberally from numerous other films including Descent, Relic, and Reeker.  In fact you'd be hard pressed to find one original idea in the entire film.

Nodin eventually figures out some sort of voodoo scientific solution about the characters DNA and making a poison from uranium but by that time, I was nodding off and only wanted the film to come to a merciful end.  Vaugier usually is able to give a bit of a spark to some of the low-budget films she's been in but seems completely bored here.  I didn't buy her role as a guilt-stricken, alcoholic sheriff at all.  Frankly she looked just too good.  Gainey is a great character actor but he seemed out of place.

Leutwyler also loves doing that thing with the camera where he has it shake and bounce during some of the monster's attack scenes, presumably to make it seem more real and get the feel for the attack.  It's a novelty trick that doesn't work and this, along with the choppy editing, only serves to annoy the viewer and make the creature even harder to see.

With three down and only one more for me to review, my hopes are fading fast for finding one good film in this year's group of Horrorfest releases.  Borderland, please save the day!

Sure, a person could go back and see ""Alien"" or ""Aliens"" for the 20th time ... but why not explore how others may create the ""Alien Genre"".  In the case of Unearthed, it is a rather good exploration of the alien topic.  Good acting, good alien monster, reasonable gore, very watchable, far better camera work than ""Cloverfield"", mildly creative plot and dollar-for-dollar a better movie than AVP 2. Movies like ""Alien"" only comes around once a decade. No point wishing all sci-fi films were that good, they never can be. It is just too much too ask Hollywood to be that creative.

I had read that it was a cross between tremors and alien...well, yea, it looks like a second hand version of the aliens in alien, and, yea, this comes underground...but it just didn't work.

It is watchable but kind of hokie and a film that you really don't want to pay money to see.  This one will be on Sci Fi no doubt in the not too distant future.  If you absolutely can't wait, go ahead and rent it.  This is not one to buy though for sure.  The creature is not very good and the acting isn't much better.  The characters have nothing in the way of development.  The alcoholic sheriff looks pretty darn young and attractive to be as pathetic a figure as she is supposed to be.  And how do you consume that much liquor and still manage to function at that level anyway?  Oh well, none of the latest films from the afterdark horrorfest have been that scary so far.

3313014,2,B00127RAIK,"""Unearthed,"" the second of the 8 Films 2 Die 4 from Horrorfest 2007 I am checking out on DVD, is a dormant monster brought to live to kill (almost) everybody in the movie type of movie.  The setting is a desolate New Mexico town, so isolated that an oil tanker can turn over and block what is apparently the only road out of town.  Equally important to the plot, the oil tanker was coming to deliver gasoline to the place run by Grandpa (Russell Means), which means the bad news for the people who show up in the first part of the movie is that there is no gasoline for them to get out of town.  The good news is that all of the women in this small town in New Mexico are big time babes.  But then there is the really bad news that a monster has been, well, unearthed.

Our heroine is Sheriff Annie Flynn (Emmanuelle Vaugier of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saw-II/dp/B000CRR31U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saw II</a>), who has an incident in her past that everybody is always making veiled references to; in fact, when Grandpa does not bring up the incident, Annie does herself, before going back to drinking to forget what everybody keeps alluding to.  It gets to the point where you expect the strangers who show up to be fodder for the creature to all know about this incident as well.  By the time the deep dark secret (that everybody knows about) is revealed, I was totally apathetic.  Caya (Beau Garrett of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Turistas/dp/B000N3AW6G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Turistas</a>""), Ally (Whitney Able), and Nodine (Tonantzin Carmelo), are other babes on the menu, whith Nodine being the important one since she is not only Grandpa's granddaughter, but also a botanist.  Yes, it is strange that a botanist would be of big help in explaining the monster in a monster movie, but that is part of what attempts to make this monster different.

I noted that once people started dying that there was not a whole lot of discussion about what was happening, although I suppose it does make sense to a certain extent not to engage in conversation while fleeing.  But then we get to a scene where there is an explosion of exposition (who knew that pictographs could be so detailed?).  The most interesting character int he story is Kale (Luke Goss), a tattooed archeologist who is sort of Mulder and Scully wrapped into one as he is out there digging alone to prove his Anaszi ancestors were wiped out by something more personal than drought.  Most of his dialogue comes in the exposition scene, and you are never sure if he is crazier than he is smart or the other way around.  But you know full well that the last man standing in this horror movie is going to be a woman, so you take his presence with a  grain of blood-soaked salt.

I was stunned that ""Unearthed"" was made by writer-director Matthew Leutwyler because I had absolutely loved his previous film, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dead-and-Breakfast/dp/B000A3DGEY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dead and Breakfast</a>,"" which I thought should have been the next great midnight movie in the ""Rocky Horror"" tradition.  Of course I realize that you cannot make a career out of zombie musicals and it is not like Leutwyler should not be trying to make serious horror films (remember, Steven Spielberg's first World War II movie was neither ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saving-Private-Ryan/dp/B00001ZWUS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saving Private Ryan</a>"" nor ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Schindler-s-List/dp/B00012QM8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Schindler's List</a>,"" for which he won Oscars as Best Director, but the raucous comedy ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1941/dp/0783231032/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1941</a>"").  But there is nothing memorable about this film, which like way too many films these days suffers from the overuse the hand held camera.  Beyond that, ""Unearthed"" comes across as a film cobbled together from bits and pieces of other films.  I was thinking that you could take the end of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Duel/dp/B000063UR5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Duel</a>,"" most of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Feast/dp/B000GLL1U6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Feast</a>,"" and some moments from ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien/dp/B00011V8IQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien</a>,"" and edit together a better movie than this one.  Across the board ""Unearthed"" comes up with too little in the blood, gore, suspense, shock, and any other department you want to mention from the horror film checklist.  The net result is a horror film that avoids being offensive, but has nothing to particularly recommend it to fans of the genre.

The only bonus feature on the DVD are the Miss Horrorfest Contest webepisodes, which are included on all of the DVDs in this round of the After Dark Horrorfest (good to know that a scream queen can actually scream).  The absence of any extras besides the standard choice between English and Spanish subtitles squelched any second thoughts about rounding up instead of down on this one.

The sound also up and down so constantly needing to turn volume up or down, makes this not very fun. The characters were o.k. & acting of them o.k. I DID like seeing Native Americans in a Movie at all as they are sadly always missing from all Movies. That fact gave it 1 star extra. Defeating this monster with radiation is a strange way to me b/c the humans would die also...so that made no sense but the worst thing of the whole Movie to me was the few trying to escape constantly getting vehicles that run out of gas when there were plenty of vehicles around.

With a monster running around, you would think they would constantly look around as they sprint to safety as fast as possible, not amble along, never looking behind them.

3313418,1,B00127RAIK,"I've been waiting to give a rating on this cheap and pathetic movie after about halfway through the movie.  Please interpret my 1 star as a negative 5 star.  I didn't start with high expectations but did expect that it'll be your typical low budget movie with mediocre acting and semi-humorous sci fi effects.  I was curious to see the ""unearthed"" creature and how the cast will battle against it.  BE WARNED:  you won't see it...you won't see anything for that matter.  Very seldom do you get a movie so poorly made that most of the movie is in the dark, so dark you can't see much.  Now, if you are legally blind and just listening to the sounds, then you might give it a better rating than me.  But if you want to watch a movie with the expecting of seeing something on your screen, move on.  Don't get me wrong, there are well-lit parts of the movie but that only entails actors talking to each other.  All the action ironically/intentionally takes place in pretty much the dark with a 1 second flash of light here and there.  Seriously?",1476576000,,1041,4.426315789473684

A tanker filled with gasoline has an accident and catches fire.  When she walks by the cab of the truck, all of the tires are in good shape as well as the paint on the cab.

Plenty of characters to be victims, no character is really safe, and there are some good tension moments. There was plenty of blood, some explosions, and decent gore.

The creature effects were almost made for television level CGI. The acting was so so. Story was so so. At one point they had plenty of cute girls and a cute boy but no hanky panky or nudity.. Also, some of the characters were just stereotypes which isn't necessarily a movie sin. I think the sheriff, hot power fem with a dark past and alcoholism, got on my nerves worst of all.

I hated having to move my volume up and down and eventually just put the CC on because the narrative was so hard to hear. I think the actors and actresses did their best considering what the director and producer wrote out and made the movie out of. This wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen but it's pretty low since I watch a lot of amateur movies too.

3314208,4,B00127RAIK,"And I actually have watched it twice and would watch it again. I saw things in it the second time around that I didn't see in the first viewing. I am particularly intrigued by the use of darkness and light in the movie. Another element that stood out in the second viewing was the abuse of an American Indian girl by a white man, which is a real problem on Indian reservations. That incident acts as a kind of foreshadowing of the ultimate doom carried out by the creature. Of course, this is often a theme in ""monster"" moves--that these monsters are some kind of divine retribution for or manifestation of the meanness of humans. It is always interesting to see which characters actually make it through the movie to the end. This movie ended somewhat differently than might be expected.

Finally, the movie has two of my favorite actors: Russell Means and Emmanuelle Vaugier. Because Russell Means has now passed, seeing him in any movie is a treat. And Emmanuelle Vaugier just has an intriguing look in every part that I have seen her in. I found the acting to be quite entertaining. As with many movies, most characters are stereotypes. And this movie may have a bit of tongue-in-cheek associated with the genre. But the lines were delivered in a believable way: The actors sounded like they were actually talking to each other and not just reciting lines.

If you like monster movies and have an hour and a half to spare, I recommend that you check this out. It is definitely action packed and has some interesting characters to boot. By the way, the movie was filmed in Utah.",1444003200,4,1581,4.602836879432624

3314461,4,B00127RAIK,"I live for good monster movies.  This one purported to be one.  Unfortunately, it had an inauspicious beginning featuring a series of electric flashes, stray images, scenes indistinguishable, layered amongst the credits.  All of it was confusing and did nothing to introduce the story, which is about the `unearthing' of a creature/monster with bad intentions.  Then there's an off screen crash of a gas tanker which neatly traps everyone on the other side of the highway.  There's nowhere to go but back and no way to do that without gas.  We quickly learn that the town drunk is their sheriff (Emmanuelle Vaugier).  Cattle are being killed, people are disappearing, and there's a tattooed yahoo excavating.  All of that spells trouble for the few people trapped in the middle of nowhere, bent on ruining the few workable vehicles they have left to them.
That's a pretty basic premise to deal with and hard to screw up, especially considering just how many films have successfully based their story on that exact formula.  And yes, this film has some very stylish photography when you can see it.  Too bad they decided to film most of the action at night with the aid of flashlights, glow sticks, an explosion or two, but little else.  Seriously, what's the point in designing a potentially interesting creature if you can't quite make it out when they even bother to give it any screen time.  The few glimpses they allowed are barely enough to pique one's interest.  I was left wanting more.  I will say it's decently paced, the acting isn't bad, the dialog isn't hopeless.  People are excoriated by the truckload, and quickly.  But it's so dark I could barely see any of it.  Still, I liked it well enough to keep it for future viewings.",1410134400,,1740,4.765886287625418

3314485,3,B00127RAIK,"Like a number of the ""8 Films to Die For,"" this entry in the original 2007 series leaves something to be desired.  I got excited when I saw that Charlie Murphy landed a role in the film, but, unfortunately, Unearthed leaves him little room to be funny.  Yes, I know this is a horror movie, but I've found that a little dark humor can sometimes make this kind of clich&eacute;d, formulaic B-movie a little less painful to watch.  The only laughs you might get out of Unearthed come at the expense of the CGI monster, and those aren't the kind of laughs you want in a horror movie.  The CGI isn't all bad overall, as some of the close-up shots of the monster (apparently a blood relative of the monster in Alien) play out pretty effectively, but the long-range views, especially those showing the monster in motion, pretty much scream the word fake.  While I'm criticizing this brainchild of writer/director Matthew Leutwyler, I also have to point to a number of unanswered questions, inadequately developed subplots, significant leaps in logic, and plenty of self-produced fodder for the likes of a Mystery Science Theater 3000.  One of my favorite moments comes during the lead-in to the film's final act, when a character who was previously at a loss to explain what was going on suddenly lays out the entire story for us in great detail.

The last thing Sheriff Annie Flynn (Emmanuelle Vaugier) needs is the unleashing of some ancient alien killing machine on four legs into her relatively quiet desert community.  She's already haunted by a tragic accident that will surely cost her her job when the townsfolk have their say at a town meeting scheduled for next week; she's well on her way to becoming a bona fide alcoholic; and she has never gotten the respect she deserves just because she's a female - and rather an attractive one, at that.  She is also very young, which made it hard for this viewer to really accept her as a full-blown sheriff (if we extrapolate using Vaugier's age, she would have become sheriff at the tender age of twenty-seven).  Getting back to the monster, he is basically an old Indian legend unearthed and brought back into the world by a rogue Indian archaeologist (they thought he was mad at the university) who wanted to prove that his people were indeed all but decimated centuries ago by a monstrous creature.  I think we can all agree that he definitely proved his point.

Alongside the sheriff, our list of would-be survivors includes two blondes and a hitchhiker they picked up along the way to California, a businessman (Charlie Murphy) who - like the other strangers - is stranded there because the gas truck that was supposed to replenish the tanks crashed several miles down the road (and the next town in this desert landscape is well over a hundred miles away); a young botanist who came back home to help take care of her Native American grandfather, and - of course - the idiot who unearthed the monster in the first place.  They spend most of the movie fleeing from one place to another in diminishing numbers as the monster takes them out one by one.  By the time they finally come up with an appropriately cockamamie way to stop the thing, you start to wonder if anyone is going to be left to actually execute the plan.  Don't worry too much, though, because you probably won't care a lot about any of the characters (although I must admit I was seriously rooting for Charlie Murphy to survive).

I guess the film gets a little gory in places, but it's certainly not enough to land Unearthed on any gorehound's list of must-sees.  In fact, there's really nothing special about this film at all, which is why I'm giving it three stars - a rating which is probably a little generous on my part given all of the film's plot holes and logical leaps.  Unearthed won't bore you to tears, but it's not really going to get your heart pumping, either.",1282003200,,3894,4.6351744186046515

3314488,1,B00127RAIK,"Unearthed (Matthew Leutwyler, 2007)

There was a time when I would have said that the great Russell Means lent a little class to every movie in which he appears. That time, unfortunately, has now passed forever with Unearthed, the latest outing for Dead and Breakfast director Matthew Leutwyler. Now, this is not Russell Means' fault by any stretch of the imagination, but it's depressing to see that he's no longer batting a thousand.

Plot: Annie Flynn (Emanuelle Vaugier), an alcoholic sheriff in a small southwestern town, is going to be forced out in a week after the town holds a no-confidence election. She's managed to hang onto her job for a year after the incident that caused the town to lose faith in her (and her to lose faith in herself), but everyone's lost patience. So, needless to say, something earth-shattering has to happen in that last week to give herback her confidence and let the town see her as a savior. Of course, that is, if anyone's left in the town by the time the mysterious, seemingly supernatural killer (this isn't a spoiler, we see what's happening in the opening scene; the only suspense there is what it is) is through eating its way through them.

As is usually the case with films picked up by the guys who run the After Dark Horrorfest, this wasn't actually a movie that was too scary for theaters; it's a movie that was so mediocre, even by the standards of the crap Hollywood's been churning out and calling ""horror"" for the past decade or so, that no studio would pick it up for distribution. Unearthed stands apart from the usual Horrorfest fare in that there's actually some starpower to be found here; former model Vaugier has recently been taking a turn on TV's CSI:NY, while male lead Luke Goss should be familiar from Blade II. But it's the supporting cast who'll really wow you--aside from the great Means, you've also got M. C. Gainey, Beau Garrett, Whitney Able, and other folks who, if their names don't look familiar, their faces will. Shouldn't surprise you, then, that the acting is above average for a Horrorfest outing. Problem is, the acting isn't enough to carry the ridiculous script, which combines the worst parts of seven or eight Sci-Fi Channel Original Movies without taking any of the good from them. (See how much this movie has addled my brain? I'm conceding there may be something good in Sci-Fi Channel Original Movies.) Given a few original twists, or Leutwyler allowing someone better to write the script, this might have been a good movie. Of course, had that happened, it wouldn't have been a Horrorfest movie. Sometimes, you really can judge a movie by its cover (and its distribution company). *",1242950400,2,2674,4.758620689655173

Are you a fan of the After Dark Horror movies but feel that some of them don't live up to expectations?  This is definitely one of the top installments to avoid.  The only way I could fathom this movie being any worse was if it had a lot lower budget and the creature was some halloween costume from Wal-Mart.  Actually maybe that would have made it more amusing.  Unfortunately this doesn't make the so-good-it's-bad list either.  Just boring all around.  Skip it.,1241740800,,583,4.592233009708738

Some of the moments of action were really good.  The tragic backstory of the sheriff sort of petered out though. And everything was really dark and hard to see. Overall, despite all these complaints the movie was not horrible, but not super great either.",1239321600,2,416,4.621621621621622
3314491,3,B00127RAIK,"If you've seen Alien, Tremors, Invasion of the Body Snatchers and The Thing, you've pretty much seen this movie before and it's been done better.

I don't hate this film but there is really nothing that distinguishable about it that sets it above some of the titles I've already listed.  The creature itself looks a lot like Alien, actually it's entire head is almost the exact replica.  I'm sure if HR Giger knew there would be a lawsuit pending.

The plot revolves around this ""creature"" terrorizing a small village and primarily a plant scientist and her father.  A dig has unearthed this title creature and it is now lose.  We are told in the film that it's over 900 years old and it's up to our crack crew of ""heros"" including a drunk female sheriff, the scientist, the indian father and some passerbys that can't leave the area due to a truck blocking the highway, one of the earlier kills of the creature.

Generally that's it.  I can't highly recommend this unless you just want to kill about 90 mins of your time and you have nothing else to do.  Again this movie was not horrible but it certainly is not original but if you have some friends that like horror and you want to have a movie festival of bad films, this would be one you might like to include.

3314492,3,B00127RAIK,"I saw _Unearthed_ on the Sci Fi Channel recently as one of its Sci Fi movies of the week (usually every Saturday night and sometimes on Sunday night). Though in years past they had been unwatchable and awful I think the last two years they had considerably improved in terms of casting, acting, writing, production values, and special effects. Heck even the titles have gotten more sophisticated; it used to endlessly amuse my friends and I that it wasn't hard to guess what _Ogre_ or _Basilisk_ was about.

 The premise of this movie was pretty good. There is a small town in the American Southwest, the site of some mysterious dig in Anasazi ruins, a dig that unearths something awful, something alive. We don't know much about what is uncovered at first but it is terrible and the creature unleashed kills the driver of a tanker trunk of much needed gas for the town's apparently only filling station, destroying the truck and blocking the road. The townsfolk, mostly ranchers, and a few people passing through the area are stranded, at first merely upset at the inconvenience but later worried as something is killing livestock and then people.

 It is up to the town's sheriff, Annie Flynn, played rather well by the attractive Emmanuelle Vaugier, to investigate. She is apparently something of an alcoholic, not because she is a worthless individual but because she is still dealing with stress and grief from some un-discussed (at first) trauma in her recent past involving a little girl and a hostage situation. Most in the town dislike her, saying openly to her face that they will gladly vote her out of her job at the next town meeting (there are overtones of sexism too). Annie acknowledges this but still says she has a job to do and with her loyal deputy does the best she can to calm the townsfolk and find out what is afoot. She does have a few supporters, including the grandfatherly Native American man who owns the filing station and his visiting botanist daughter who is there ostensibly to help her grandfather but really still doing research (thus explaining the useful lab equipment at the gas station that come to such good use later).

 The movie becomes basically a story of the scientist trying to understand the creature and find a way to defeat it (its background, while underdeveloped, I have to admit was interesting) while in other scenes Annie tries to keep the townsfolk and travelers alive and kill the monster.

 The monster special effects were pretty good though the creature could have been shown more often. I think they still have problems making CGI creations really ""live"" in a physical environment with sets and actors, probably part of the reason why these movies tend to gravitate towards flying creatures (look at all the Sci Fi Channel movies of the week involving gargoyles, sphinxes, gryphons, pterosaurs, and dragons). At times it still didn't seem part of the same world but I think they have made great strides in that area.

 The movie does have its flaws. I thought some of the characters were a bit underdeveloped or even stereotypical, such as the very loyal, over earnest deputy, the hateful, boastful, arrogant, sexist rancher tycoon, and the urbanite African-American traveler. The person doing the dig, the one who uncovered the creature, and his motives was very undeveloped and I thought the weakest thing about the movie. He came off as a bit  crazy with unclear motives, not like any real scientist I have ever heard of.",1224806400,,3485,4.830536912751678

The scientist character seems more a self-absorbed young thug, than anyone who would crack open a book, let alone keep records, take samples, etc., etc..  The alcoholic sheriff has continual flashbacks of the incident that suggests her alcoholic behavior.  Townspeople continually insult and criticize her, threatening to boot her out of her position, with no discussion of the situation.
