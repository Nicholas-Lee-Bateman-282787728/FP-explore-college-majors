8374976,5,B002NE2EQE,"This is the story of Rodel (Paolo Serrano) and Jonard (Joash Balejado) who run into each other in Manila after several years of separation. Jonard's family is hurting for money and he is looking for work.  Rodel is making good money as a massage therapist in a gay spa and suggests that Jonard go to work there.  The money is not in the massage but in the ""extra service"" and need I explain what that is.  I don't think so.  Jonard is leery because he doesn't want to do gay sex but Rodel explains that he doesn't have to engage in active sex but just let the customer do what he wants with him.  The lure of good money gets Jonard involved. The story is about their experiences with the different customers.  There is a baddie by the name of Mr. Tong (Jeffry Santos) who is an ex-cop who owns the spa and deals drugs through Biboy (Marco Morales).  He feels he owns the boys and as he says ""I own your dicks""and if they mess up and not give him their earnings, he has them beaten up and killed.  After a while Rodel makes his move on Jonard and tells him he loves him and Jonard says he loves Rodel.  When Jonard finds out that the bank is going to foreclose on his mother's home, he goes to Biboy for help.  Biboy has him get involved in dealing drugs but first gets him drugged out so he can sexually enjoy him.  On Jonard;s first night dealing drugs he is busted.  I must warn you that there is a rape scene where Jonard is assaulted while in jail.  It is well done if a rape scene can be well done.  The strongest scene is after he gets out and tells Rodel what happened and how he feels.  That scene itself is worth watching the movie.  Because of what happened to Jonard, all the boys gang up on Mr. Tong who gets a surprise and the ending is a gooder. .",1404691200,,1761,4.135294117647059
