3712163,1,B001NCE3Q6,"Was expecting a documentary but it turned out to be a home video with slides. didn't watch far enough in to find out if they actually filmed the guy while he was racing instead of just when he showed up at checkpoints.

Not happy with it.",1347321600,2,238,4.173913043478261
3712164,4,B001NCE3Q6,I appreciated the inside view of some aspects of the Iditarod.  Now I want to know more.  I'd like to see a second chapter with personal information re: experiencing the days on the ride.,1345075200,,187,4.470588235294118
3712165,4,B001NCE3Q6,"I don't know if it's because I was so enthralled and having so much fun watching this video, but it was a lot shorter than I expected (72 minutes) The bulk of the DVD was spent on Sven's preparation for the Iditarod (previous races and training) but there was very little footage of the Iditarod itself. I certainly don't expect the camera to stay with him for 1049 miles, but I would hope that the photographer would have spent the effort to film him at checkpoints and the finish line at the very least and thus spend more time on a Rookie's Journey to Nome.

However, as a progressing musher, I thoroughly enjoyed what we did get to see, and to see the varying methods used by each musher. I struggled with 3 or 4 stars because for $20 it was less than I expected. However, I'll stick with 4 stars just because I enjoyed the content, and certainly support the effort that was made.",1298505600,3,884,4.357575757575757
3712166,3,B001NCE3Q6,"While this video is includes some interesting insights into dogsledding, the quality is basically that of a home video.",1268611200,,119,5.315789473684211
3712167,5,B001NCE3Q6,"Of the numerous Iditarod videos in my collection, ""See You In Nome"" is my favorite and most watched (along with ""Pretty Sled Dogs"" also by Husky Productions)!  It's so detailed and informative, dispelling completely any negative commentary I've ever heard from ill-informed critics of the Iditarod.  In this video, you'll see, hear and understand the mushers' total devotion to their dogs.  It is not a hobby or vacation, but a lifestyle that includes the year-round training, love and care of Olympic-style athletes.  Veterinarians explain the very thorough exams they give each dog.  By the time the team reaches the Iditarod Start line in Anchorage (2/3 into the video), I am cheering for Sven and each dog by name!  And my chihuahua is barking, wagging, and ovaling the living room!  If you love dogs, you'll love this video!  GO SVEN!!",1236297600,3,840,4.9928057553956835
3712168,5,B001NCE3Q6,"This video was very well done, informative, fun and a wonderful video of an Alaskan dog musher.  Sven is very down to earth and loves what he does and it shows throughout the video.  Donna has done an excellant job preparing, shooting and finalizing the video.  All in all I would highly recommend this.",1231891200,5,303,4.574074074074074
3712169,5,B001NCE3Q6,"Donna Quante has done it again with her latest video, ""See You In  Nome!"" Like
her first video, ""Pretty Sled Dogs"", Donna gets you up front and personal
with a class act musher and his beloved dogs. Donna's mastering of
video brings out the humbleness, yet dedication and motivation of Sven
and the happy, contented nature of his dogs.

You will also meet Sven's wife, Andrea, a veterinarian and enjoy viewing her
performing a pre-Iditarod  ""vet check"" on one of Sven's dogs. While
highly entertaining, watching a veterinarian do this pre-race
examination is also very educational; an eye opener as to the pre-race
medical evaluation these dogs must undergo before being allowed to
race the Iditarod.

This excellent video starts by introducing you to Sven and his dogs
and, you would think, ends with the crossing under the Burl Arch in
Nome. It does all that with outstanding style and clarity. However,
Donna adds an extra bonus for you; an in-sled interview with Sven.
Yes, Donna focused her trusty camera on the dog team as they raced
down they trail.  While you, the viewer, are watching these
magnificent dogs enjoy their run on the snow pack, Sven is talking to
you, through Donna, answering Donna's questions. This piece of video
is in itself amazing, and worth the price of this video.

When you ""get out"" of the sled, take time and read the credits and
ending comments that scroll by on the screen. Sven makes a very
important statement attesting to what I wrote above about his,
""humbleness, yet dedication and motivation"". I had the honor of
meeting Sven, and I can tell you his words are not just lip service
to sell an exceptional video, they are true of the man, the musher,
the dog lover.

Sven expressed concerned that you, the video viewer, would experience
difficulty understanding him due to his accent. I experienced no such
problem, either in person or watching the video. My hearing leaves
much to be desired, even with state of the art hearing aides.

Besides being extremely entertaining, this video makes a very clear
statement regarding a man's dedication to his dogs and the dogs'
dedication and unconditional love for the man. You can not go wrong
adding this video to your collection. We, at the ""Howlin' Rivers Home""
gave it a 4 paw+ tail wag rating.

Enjoy

3712170,5,B001NCE3Q6,"This new DVD by Husky Productions is better than outstanding. Ms. Quante is an artist with the video camera and very adept at working in appropriate stills that add to the depth of the film. Sven Haltmann, his wife, and their delightful huskies will steal your heart and have you cheering for them all, as their goals are met. Sven is very open about his methods of training, his love for his dogs and the support of family and friends. Sven will show you the 24/7, 365 day schedule it takes to have sled dogs ready for what they are meant to do -- RUN. Sven's smile is echoed by the happy husky grins and the eagerness of his dogs.
 If you love sled dogs or wonder about the sport of sled dogs, See You In Nome should have you hooked long before the end. The music, written and sung by Kyf Brewer is the frosting on the cake. This DVD takes a good look at this young man and his team--they're real and they're on a mission to attaining their goals. It's a must buy !

3712171,5,B001NCE3Q6,"This latest DVD from Husky Productions is an excellent cronical of all the love, work and sacrifice that goes into preparing to run the Last Great Race, the Iditarod. You will go along as 2008 Iditarod rookie Sven Haltmann trains his team, prepares food and gear for the trail, and actually runs the 1000 mile Iditarod. You will celebrate with him as he finishes under the burled arch on Front Street in Nome.

The real stars of the film are Sven's team of amazing Alaskan huskies who are always upbeat and ready to RUN!!!  The love shared between dogs and musher is evident as are the bonds between Sven's wife (a vet), and the dogs.

This is a must-have/must-see for anyone interested in dog powered sports and/or the Iditarod.  The photography alone makes this film a winner.",1229472000,11,778,4.656934306569343

8323410,2,B001NCE3Q6,"This is a no budget documentary that plays more like a home video.  While it has some interesting content, it is amateurishly made and drags a lot.

8323411,3,B001NCE3Q6,"This is not a glossy, mainstream documentary. However, Sven presents an interesting look into the prep required for the Idiatord. I bought this to show my classroom as part of an interactive study on the Great Race.  However, I did need to stop it before he was able to describe his adventure due to a few inappropriate curse words. Otherwise, I found it to be a useful video.",1459555200,2,376,4.529411764705882

I've met Sven at his terrific Hostel in Fairbanks, and in winter, he's in Bettles giving sled tours with his dogs. He's a true outdoorsman and is excited about just about everything, especially his dogs. Worth a look.",1377302400,,378,4.478260869565218
