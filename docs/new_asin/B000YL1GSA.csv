8337409,5,B000YL1GSA,The high value of this EASTWESTDVD.COM Blood Tide and Point Of Terror double feature is the deleted or extra scenes. This DVD has biographical Tony Trelos scenes as an adolescent that isn't included on the Scorpion Releasing and Vinegar Syndrome disks. Tony's hardships as a youth gives added strength to this film's story and plot. It's a great movie of a human being recalling his challenge and goal to make it as a singer. Salutations to all three movie versions as I own them in my library.,1516406400,,494,4.689655172413793
8337410,1,B000YL1GSA,"I bought this DVD exclusively for Point of Terror, unfortunately the disc has a flaw and Point of Terror starts about ten minutes into the program, leaving the viewer missing the hilarious opening credits with Peter Carpenter singing in his poor man's Elvis get-up. BUMMER! I'm not sure if all the discs are flawed, but usually when one does it, they all do it, and I seriously doubt a budget label is going to fix the problem anytime soon. Proceed with caution.",1225756800,7,462,4.646341463414634
