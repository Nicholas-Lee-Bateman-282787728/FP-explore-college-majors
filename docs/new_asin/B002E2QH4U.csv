3915133,3,B002E2QH4U,"Celebrities are gods, money is worshipped, Mayans predicted that 2012 will be the End of Days...What does it all mean? A host of new age thinkers weigh in on the theories of 2012.",1258761600,3,179,4.454545454545454
3915134,1,B002E2QH4U,"Did I miss something??? There are about 8 previews of documentaries on this DVD. I did not see or could find a documentary on 2012, nor did I see a preview on anything that is related to 2012 or the Mayans. I ran it twice and if this is all that I get for my money, I want my money back.
Who buys a movie with only previews on it? I didn't buy this so I can watch a (8) 2-4 minute clips of other movies !!
I am shocked.
Where's the movie???",1258329600,5,440,3.7419354838709675
8366743,4,B002E2QH4U,"2012 was the end of the world as we knew it...only in a less obvious way. Changes were set into motion, changes that will forever leave the world, well, different. Hearing different experts on the subject was eye opening. They are all clear speakers, and will leave you better off than you were before. I feel the change in the world now. We should all be in tune with what is happening around us!",1374883200,,397,4.378378378378378
8366744,4,B002E2QH4U,"These great minds take a look at we now know as 'the shift', a time period that it is simply amazing we are leaving in and get to witness. The truth is unleashed and I ask you are you prepared?",1374883200,,193,3.85
8366745,4,B002E2QH4U,This film answers a lot of questions concerning 2012 with renowned experts presenting their theories on the subject. The content presented is truly worth watching if you are interested in 2012 and the apocalyptic theories surrounding the date. I admit the film did little to persuade my skepticism about these types of theories but the information is definitely worth considering. The authors interviewed throughout the film all have some intriguing perspectives and anyone interested in this subject will find it is certainly worth watching.,1294272000,2,542,5.464285714285714
8366746,1,B002E2QH4U,"i got this video thought of it documents the 2012 event but it such great disappointment nothing on the topic except preview on other topics .

it is crap disc .",1293926400,2,161,4.193548387096774
8366747,3,B002E2QH4U,"Now that 2012 is fast-approaching, everyone is talking about and worrying about the Earth and our very lives.  Are humans doomed to die out just like the dinosaurs?  Can we save ourselves and the planet?  Several experts and best selling authors are interviewed for this film and they offer their own perspective on global warming, solar flares, the politics of environmental issues, earth science, and more.

So, are we going to die out or not?I seriously doubt it since we can look back on various periods of history and see that philosophers have always talked about the end of times.  But, one thing is for certain, we're in for some changes and probably big changes at that.  In fact, we can see that the world and our lives have been shifting more and more as the years pass, and it may all reach a pinnacle on 12/12/12.  Whether you believe everything these philosophers have to say or not, this DVD certainly makes you think and we need more films like this.",1288396800,,966,4.614035087719298
8366748,3,B002E2QH4U,"This is a compilation of doom and gloom interviews from a variety of New Age thinkers.  If you're interested, act now because in 2012 you'll have other things to worry about besides watching a documentary.

Or not?  There's some pseudo-science going on here, and some lapses in logic.  The big one, which I find disturbing--and puts these thinkers in the same camp as fundamentalists--is the claim that because science is unable to explain everything, what it can explain must be a huge hoax.

Play this on a double-bill with Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth and see who you believe.

Also, these philosophers have in common with many fundamentalists the belief that we are somehow ""special,"" that we live in ""special times"" for some reason.  This just seems like narcissism, self-importance and pride to me.

But despite the disagreements, I give this DVD three stars for making me think.",1275609600,,888,4.952702702702703
8366749,1,B002E2QH4U,"Disorganized, boring, repetitious, borrowed from other DVDs without concern for quality.
This was a big disappointment.  and will go the way of donations.  I won't waste your time or mine by listing all the minuses.  After watching Odyssey 2012 ( 3 1/2 ) and the follow up ""2013"", (4 stars) the first good, the second much better and worth watching again, I did expect more.

I wasted both my time and money",1266192000,5,407,4.611111111111111
8366750,1,B002E2QH4U,I was very disappointed in the material of An Awakening. It seemed to be indivual plugs for other dvds or material of featured guest/authors. It was very misleading and I would not recommend it to anyone.,1266019200,4,204,4.694444444444445
8366751,1,B002E2QH4U,"FIRST THERE ARE ONLY SIX BOXS NOT SEVEN LIKE ONE PERSON SAID  AND THERE IS NO MOVIE TO BE FOUND ON ANY OF THE SIX.ALL I WANT IS TO SEE THE MOVIE I'M TIERED OF ALL THE TALKING AND MAKING UP THINGS CAN I MAKE A DVD I BELEAVE IN 2012 EVERY ONE WILL BE RICH AND NEVER HAVE TO WORK AGAIN LOL

8366752,5,B002E2QH4U,"This is the 2012 tour de force of transformation DVDs! The movers, shakers, and shapeshifters of consciousness, culture, and world civilizations. See what is coming before we are OBE (Overcome-By-Events).

Make no mistake, the times they are a ""chang'in"" and ever more rapidly as we spiral into the time tunnel target date: December 21, 2012 A.D.

Do not fear the shift, prepare for it in the best way we can: visually via imagination. Recall the sage shamanic counsel of Terence McKenna and be forewarned as to the facts: ""We are experiencing the exteriorizing of the soul and the interiorizing of the body!""

That is, we are sensing the collapse of space-time physics here and now or, in other words, our human body-mind cells community of consciousness are turning our sense of reality inside out! More and more we are being integrated into a superorganism also known as the Global Body-Mind of Gaia. We are as the worker bees of the hive collecting the nectar -- information -- for the Queen Bee.

Indeed, we are caterpillars dying but only to give birth to the galactic solar-powered butterfly!
