8380626,2,B002TT9NU8,"I am a leather worker, and build chaps and chinks, and custom wooly chaps. The reason i bought this dvd, was to learn more about making them. Sizing the person, and then sizing the pattern. All legs are different around. Your pattern has to be adjusted to this, in order for them to fit. This dvd, shows nothing, on how to do this. If a person, New to chap building, bought this dvd, they would be clueless on sizing around the waist and legs, and how to transfer the numbers, to a pattern, then to chap leather. I don't know this person, and don't want to take anything away from him, but this dvd is kinda usless.",1488844800,2,615,4.264957264957265
