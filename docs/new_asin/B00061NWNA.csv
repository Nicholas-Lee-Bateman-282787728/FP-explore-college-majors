8036405,2,B00061NWNA,"This tape might show you some techniques that you may have not seen before. You might also pick up some details you didn't know about techniques you know. It's not for the beginner (or the impatient), though.

The video is a collection of techniques by Rodrigo 'Comprido' Medeiros. He speaks in Portuguese and explains the entire technique before having the legendary Romero 'Jacare' Cavalcanti explain them in english, while Medeiros demonstrates them again.

This seems to be an experiment that didn't work so well. On the negative side, it can is disjointed and easy to wander off during the parts you don't understand and becomes quite tedious.

On the plus side, however, you get to see the techniques slowly. And, if you're bilingual, you'll pick up nuances in both explanations you otherwise wouldn't.

As far as the techniques themselves, they are exactly as described on the cover. A snapshot of the techniques that make up Comprido's game at the time. He covers escapes from the bottom. For the most part, they are sound. It's probable you'll pick up some good details. I even thought a few of the ideas were quite innovative. I also disagree with the concept of being dated. All techniques have counters and all counters have counters. That's the nature of the game.

In short, if you're interested in some less orthodox techniques for getting out from the bottom that some might find unorthodox and are patient enough to trawl through the video to find them, this is not OK. There are much better tapes covering pretty much the same material, however.",1121126400,,1563,4.8830188679245285
8036406,1,B00061NWNA,"I ordered this one because I was looking for some new ideas for escapes. Having had great success ordering sets from other established Brazilians such as Saulo Ribeiro and Daniel Moraes I had hoped this volume would be equally of benefit.

Unfortunately, this is not the case. There are two main criticisms. Firstly, the instruction from Rodrigo is in Portugese. Ater he has demonstrated the technique twice, it is then translated by his training partner. I cannot help but feel a lot of key points are lost. It takes up a lot of time and there are not that many techniques in the 55 mins or so.

The second problem is with the techniques themselves. To put it simply, these techniques are rather dated. For example, the knee-on-stomach escapes require you to reach across your body with the opposite arm. This can be very risky because you are giving the opponent a lot of submission opportunities. The Saulo ""Revolution"" series highlights this very clearly. The other techniques are just too basic to be of use to anyone but the absolute beginner (Bridging Escape for example).

All in all, what you are getting here is a training tape from the early days of BJJ in the USA. It is good to see an experienced Brazilian in action but you are better off paying just a little more and getting the Cesar Gracie DVD set which covers a lot more!",1104969600,,1340,4.621848739495798
