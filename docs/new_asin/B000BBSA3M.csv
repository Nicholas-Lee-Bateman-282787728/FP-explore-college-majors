8084716,2,B000BBSA3M,"Sonnen made one big mistake: Many years ago, he put everything he knew into his first exercise video, the award-winning ""Grappler's Toolbox"". He's been trying convince us that he's come up with something new ever since. He hasn't.",1274832000,3,230,5.078947368421052
8084717,5,B000BBSA3M,"Viewing Prasara: Flow Without Thought is like attending a workshop with prasara creator Scott Sonnon, but at the fraction of the cost of most yoga workshops.  The two DVD series is an excellent way to learn about and practice the prasara technique.  On disc one Sonnon discusses the philosophy behind prasara in a peaceful outdoor setting.  In this lecture style DVD Sonnon describes prasara as movement and flow beyond thought, and one meaning of prasara is ""to dance"".  Sonnon's style is conversational and relaxed but packed with profound information about yoga, anatomy, breath and health in general.  His passion for yoga shines through.  The discussion is interspersed with short segments showing Sonnon doing prasara sequences.  His segment on structure is particularly helpful for those working with chronic pain issues or those interested in yoga therapy.  Sonnon brings to yoga some original ideas from his training in other exercise disciplines.  I've never come across what Sonnon calls the ""anger or force level breath"" and  I was glad to learn something new about a topic (breath/pranayama) I've studied rigorously.

The second DVD is for practicing prasara at home and contains multiple sequences.  The sequences are set to music and not narrated.  They are most appropriate for people with a foundation in yoga.  (Sonnon offers a DVD titled Prasara: Instructional Series ""A"" for viewers interested in a more traditional instructional DVD.)  At first glance I thought some of the sequences looked difficult.  But I jumped in, followed along, and was surprised at how fluid the sequence felt even the first time I tried it.  The sequences move the body in a full circle which is something exciting I've never done during a yoga class.  A printed insert is included that lists poses for two flow sequences and a summary of the ""levels of breath.""  Prasara has transformed my own yoga practice.  I am more creative moving in and out of poses, as well as modifying poses into new poses all my own.  I credit prasara with a new sense of freedom in my personal practice.  This DVD is a great place to start learning about the exciting practice of prasara.

8084718,3,B000BBSA3M,"This is neither an instructional nor a practice DVD.  Rather, it is mostly educational in nature, with instructor Scott Sonnon providing an introduction to his Prasara technique.  Disc 1 is about 32 minutes long, and it contains informal discussions by Sonnon on his method interspersed with 2-3 minute demonstrations of his movement flows.  Sonnon advocates the concept of Flow, which makes no distinction between mind, body, and emotions.  Disc 2 offers a menu listing Sonnon's 5 different flow series; selecting these off the menu provides a 2-3 minute visual-only demonstration of each flow.  Finally, there is a DVD insert which offers the ""kinetic chain"" breakdown for each of the 5 flows as well as a brief description of the 5 levels of breath, from ""fear level breath"" to ""mastery level breath.""

Prasara is certainly an intriguing concept, and Sonnon's flows are definitely beautiful to watch.  However, I think this DVD set is likely to appeal to only a very limited audience, especially at this high price.",1211500800,4,1018,5.096385542168675
8084719,4,B000BBSA3M,"I agree with the other comments preceding this review, these are beautifully produced DVDs of Sonnon's personal slant on constantly flowing Yoga movement.  It does a great job showcasing both Sonnon's own practice and his cleverly linked movement patterns.  I found it interesting and inspiring.  It would be a great extra to provide in a Yoga instructional package, or a demo for advanced Yoga practitioners.  By itself, it is not what most people would be expecting in a Yoga DVD (for this price).  If they insist on selling it separately from instructionals, they should have marketed it more specifically as a demonstration DVD I think.  There is so little information that this really becomes a cross between a long advertisement and a motivational movie.

There are actually two DVDs in this package, but it is essentially the same material edited differently. One is broken up by brief discussions on general concepts and the other is pure demo.

Sonnon's Prasara patterns are clever and inspiring but most people would find it very hard to learn them from this DVD set.  Painfully, although it is beautifully done, I can't recommend it at over $50 unless you have money to burn.  If you get the instructionals (such as:<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/PRASARA-Instructional-Series-A-Flows/dp/B000XV55CE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">PRASARA. Instructional Series 'A' Flows</a>), or if you are already advanced at motion Yoga, this would make a nice addition to your materials, especially if you can find it used.",1203724800,4,1554,5.518987341772152
8084720,1,B000BBSA3M,"I can't really decide what the actual purpose of this DVD is. It is basically a video of Sonnon performing some advanced Prasara while in the background you hear him expounding on what Prasara is. It is in no way instructional (unless you consider monkey see, monkey do to be instructional) and since the movements presented are of a high level it is highly unlikely any beginner will be able to even manage that.

The only instruction is a single DVD sized sheet printed on both sides with a summary of the speech Sonnon gives in disc one on one side (his breath mastery scale which is described in many of the other products as well) and a list of pose sequences on the reverse, this lists beginner, intermediate and advanced versions of each movement (only the advanced are shown on the DVD) but since the beginner movements use poses not visible in the advanced unless you already know those positions you have no way to do them. To give you an idea the first three movements of the first beginner flow are listed as:

Child Pose or Balasana
Pigeon Pose Prep or Eka Pada
Rajakapotasana Prep (R Back Leg)
Triangle Squat - Standing Shin Roll - Triangle Squat

Do you know what all that means? I certainly didn't and the product did nothing to teach me. Unless you already know what everything there is you have no way to even begin to learn. Also all these steps are totally different to those shown in the advanced movement shown on the DVD making it incredibly difficult to figure out what they could be even if you had the time and inclination to do so.

Given the generally high standards of Sonnon's products this is a real disappointment. In fact I can't even imagine what purpose this product serves. If you want to hear a short speech about breathing while watching a grown man prance around in his underpants this is the DVD for you. If you own a gym and are looking for a nice looking DVD to put running on all those turned down TVs on the walls it will do the job just fine. If you actually want to learn Prasara or anything about yoga you need to look elsewhere.",1199923200,14,2076,4.4267015706806285
8084721,1,B000BBSA3M,"if you are new to yoga this in not the DVD set for you.  an insightful lecture and quick demonstration, but not an instructional by any stretch of the word.  Not worth the price tag as far as I'm concerned",1192406400,10,205,4.1
8084722,5,B000BBSA3M,"Part demonstration, part personal manifesto, and all visual feast, this 2-DVD set is the ""coffee-table book"" of yoga videos.  The main disc alternates between Scott Sonnon demonstrating five different, flowing series of yoga movements and describing the nature of his personal yoga practice, which he calls ""Prasara,"" Sanscrit for ""Flow without thought.""  (Hence the title).  The second disc holds all five of the 'flows' demonstrated on the first disc, separated and labeled for reference.  Inside the DVD case, you'll also find a small chart illustrating Sonnon's Breath Mastery Scale on one side and listing all the movements in the five 'flows' on the other.

It is possible to emulate the movements by paying careful attention to the chart and the DVD (although viewers should be aware that the movements in the demonstration are not always exactly the same as on the chart).  Those who come to this with no yoga background would be well advised to get a sourcebook on yoga poses such as Iyengar's _Light on Yoga_; Sonnon's own _Body-Flow_ book and DVD would be helpful as well.

However, the DVD is not particularly designed to be instructional in that sense.  It seems to be offered more as an encouragement or a challenge: ""This is how I experience creative flow in my yoga practice.  Imagine what you can do with these concepts.""",1155081600,6,1338,4.9641255605381165
