2245126,2,B0007V6ITE,"Blade Trinity(2004) was pretty much the final nail in the coffin for the blade franchise, it was obvious Wesley Snipes had no interest in this film and it's shows, too much campy humor Dominic Purcell, Parker Posey and Patton Oswalt were horrible miscast. if you are a fan of the first two you will be sorely disappointed by this installment.",1519344000,,342,4.716666666666667
2245127,3,B0007V6ITE,I love Blade movies. This one was a true disappointment in comparison to other Blade movies. I still award some starts because it is a fine action/sci-fi movie but simply it does not match up with its standards.,1517443200,,211,4.578947368421052

2245138,1,B0007V6ITE,"If you loved the original and even the sequel you will be terrible disappointed in this dribble. It keeps nothing from the original except Blade who is hamstrung with 2 caricature wannabe heroes. Surprised they didn't kill off Blade in order to give the franchise to the newbies. Again, we find Ryan Reynolds playing his usually annoying ""Van Wilder"" character. The same acting he used in Wolverine Origins & Deadpool.  Jessica Biel is always a plus but neither has the Blade chops to tackle the vampires that hunt them. The Vampire King looks most of the time to be in a commercial for Calvin Klein. None of the acting chops of Stephen Dorff or Kris Kristofferson. Very bad all around.",1491264000,,686,4.716666666666667

2245180,1,B0007V6ITE,"Not a bad 3rd sequel to the Blade series
this 3rd sequel is now on Blu-ray in the same Unrated cut from the 2 Disc dvd set
the HD transfer looks amazing in 2:35:1 ratio very sharp & clear picture quality so WB made the effort for sure
plus the sound quality has been boosted to a new 6.1 Master audio mix which does sound incredible
but for some reason all the special features from the 2 Disc dvd set were not carried over
none of the extras were carried over, how bizarre.

so the U.S. & Canada blu-ray's of Blade Trinity are barebones but have the exact same 122min Unrated cut
However the U.K. blu-ray is apparently the only version that has all the extras, and i mean all the extras from the 2 Disc set
DAYWALKERS, NIGHTSTALKERS & FAMILIARS which is the making of Documentary- 16 parts to it
plus VISUAL EFFECTS FEATURETTE, GOYER ON GOYER FEATURETTE
BLOOPER REEL, ALTERNATE ENDING, AND THEATRICAL TRAILERS
Plus the 2 Audio commentaries from the 2 Disc dvd version
all this on 1 Blu-ray Disc incredible!
cause Blade's Distributor is Warner brothers all blu-ray versions are ALL REGIONS/REGION FREE
so if your player is locked to region A, the U.K. disc should still play
but the U.K. blu-ray has all the special features over 1 hours worth of extras plus the 122mins Unrated version of the film
so if you love the Blade series buy the U.K. blu-ray, not the U.S. or Canada blu-ray
so your better off buying the U.K. blu-ray, still available from amazon uk, so get it shipped to your U.S address

2245213,2,B0007V6ITE,"Blade Trinity, in which Blade becomes a supporting character in his own movie and suffers for the loss of onscreen time.  Casting faux pas aside, this movie is a mess no matter which version you watch.  The story is all over the place; too many characters are introduced then dispensed with quickly, there a bit with the FBI that doesn't amount to much, the tone throughout is jokey but not fun.  I wasn't surprised when Wesley Snipes sued both New Line Cinema and Goyer.  This is an odd departure from the previous two films, a sad coda to the series.  It feels more like a spinoff vehicle for Jessica Biel and Ryan Reynolds than it does an official Blade film.  They ditched Kristofferson's character early on, chucked out like yesterday's bad news, in favor of a daughter unknown (Biel).  They left out the intrigue, the bite, in support of a loose pseudo-hipness that plays like one long bad joke (courtesy of Reynolds and a truly misguided performance from Parker Posey).  They try so hard to be cool it hurts to watch the misfiring jokes thud so consistently.  As for the villain of the piece, Dracula (Dominic Purcell), never has there been a duller vampire claiming to be Dracula.  They had to finally jazz him up with FX and voice enhancement and still he failed to produce shivers.  Hardly the stuff of nightmares, just a few well staged fight sequences and that's it.  This is a parody.  Hopefully the rumors are true and they are gearing up to restart the Blade franchise.  Anything would be better than this.",1400889600,,1521,4.647940074906367

Things come to a head in this thrilling final chapter in the Blade Trilogy, pitting Blade against Drake aka Dracula, the king daddy of all vampires. Teaming up with Hannibal King and Abigail Whistler, the trio seeks to take down Dracula before he can create more daywalkers and eliminate Blade forever.

If you're going to bring things to a head and have a final showdown between the good guy and a major bad guy, you need to ensure that your major bad guy is a big deal and you don't really get any more big deal than Dracula. Created by Bram Stoker and based on the historical and infamous Vlad the Impaler, Dracula was the first vampire ever and has since become not only the most famous one, but has tons of media under his namesake including movies, books, TV shows, cartoons, songseverything. And thats just him never mind the countless media sporting all the vampires he inspired. Taking a vampire hunter like Blade and putting him up against Dracula makes good sense to me.

Except the Dracula in this movie is pretty so-so, which doesnt cut it, in my opinion. I was expecting an ultra-powerful vampire, one that would give even the Reapers in Blade II a run for their money in terms of villain awesomeness. Instead, I was given a strong vampire, but not the ultimate vampire. Too bad, too, because having him as a bad guy is an awesome idea.

As always, Wesley Snipes leads the flick as the titular hero, picking up right where he left off in Blade II and staying consistent in character start to finish.

Having Ryan Reynolds as Hannibal KingIm a Reynolds fan. Put him in the right role and you're guaranteed something good. Not sure how he stacks up against his comic book counterpart, but for this flick, not only was he tough as all get out and kicked all sorts of butt, but the comedic elements he brought had me laughing out loud more than once and yet such jokes worked in this movie and didn't seem out of place.

Jessica Biel as Abigail Whistlerwho doesnt like a strong woman who can hold her own and fight vampires? I appreciated the seriousness she brought to the role and was a nice counterbalance to Hannibal King.

Kris Kristofferson was briefly back as Whistler, Abigails father. Wont say more as I don't want to spoil anything for those who haven't seen the flick yet.

This movie has solid action throughout, but I wish the climactic battle between Dracula and Blade was more epic. Seemed average, but that could just be me. Really liked this movie on the whole, though. It was the Dracula angle that brought it down a notch solely because there was more they couldve done in terms of raising the stakes with such a villain.

In the end, its a decent send-off for Blade and a pretty good bookend to the trilogy.

Go check it out.",1389312000,2,2769,4.508982035928144
2245218,4,B0007V6ITE,Blade sometimes gets a bad rep. And people don't seem to understand that the Blade movies were some of the first Marvel movies that came out before the whole super hero thing made it big in the movie industry. And at the time the quality of the graphics weren't as good. But I think the storyline is decent for not staying entirely true to the comic. I also think the vampire concept is pretty killer. The movie has awesome action and some cool effects.,1388534400,,453,4.404761904761905

2245234,2,B0007V6ITE,"Hollywood really did a fine job what could have been a great trilogy. All that comedy and silly humor wasn't needed so it made no sense making it the way they did. Ryan Reynolds was annoying all throughout the film. All his jokes and clowning around were not even funny. Everytime he jokes around I feel like saying, ""shut up already!"" Killing off Whistler was a big mistake and having him replaced by a bunch of misfit amatuers was insulting. Why does Hollywood mess up on Marvel trilogies over and over again?

But . . . the writers do not do a fine job introducing the original vampire.  His history is barely explained.  His qualities, both physical and preternatural are never explained.  The new characters are barely more than plot props, yet the actors chosen are excellent performers.  Triple H is given corny dialogue and never used in thrilling action scenes, which is absolutely a waste.  That's like casting The Rock to sit in a chair smiling.  It seems like such a waste.

This is a movie with an excellent premise, a superb cast, yet a wasted plot and poor characterization.  You can literally SEE Biel and Reynolds and the others acting the heck out of their mediocre parts, trying to make something interesting out of underwritten sludge.

If you love vampires and Blade, rent it or buy it.  The action is fun.  Just be aware that they dropped the ball in the writing.",1371772800,3,1087,4.732620320855615

I mean, the director's cut doesn't make the movie excellent or anything, but it is an improvement.  The American version is now available and I wish I had waited.  The premise was a good one:  vampires unearth Dracula, the first of their kind, in an attempt to become daywalkers and defeat Blade.  They manage to get Blade on the run and he's forced to team up with a group of resistance fighters.  This new team includes some great talent like Patton Oswald, Jessica Biel, and Ryan Reynolds.  Reportedly Wesley Snipes didn't like that he had to share screen time with a scene stealer like Ryan and you can really tell in their scenes together.  Parker Posey does a fine job of chewing scenary as one of the principal villians.  You're more likely to roll you eyes during allot of the action sequences and dialogue than be thrilled or entertained.  Can't recommend unless you're a die hard Blade fan and have to complete your collection.  If you do though, pick up the American version.",1346198400,2,1122,4.697435897435898

However, the Blade movies went on sale here on Amazon a little while back, so i though, ""Why not?"" I guess my tastes have changed over the years because I really enjoyed it this time around. I still didn't really like the vampires, outside of the main vamp, but I think where my tastes changed was in appreciation of the humor in the movie. I thought Ryan Reynolds comebacks in particular were pretty awesome. Jennifer Beals...well, I can watch her anytime, and of course Blade was Blade, although maybe not quite so serious as in previous movies. All in all, and with new consideration, I think this movie was really good. Maybe not quite as good as the first two, but good nonetheless, and quite enjoyable.

However, I was a bit disappointed to discover there's no worthwhile menu system on the disk.  You put it in the player and it auto-starts the movie with the default audio setup, which is not the HD Master track.  Then when the movie finishes it will circle around and start up all over again without intervention.  It might just be my opinion, but I think that's a cheesy and lame way to put together a move on this format.  I guess I'll have to put a sticky note in the case with the move reminding me of this and what button to push to change the audio to HD Master while the intro is playing.",1330732800,,971,4.105820105820106

The villain looks no more than a good for nothing punk, and is very unimpressive. They could have used anybody and he might have done better.

One needs the use of all of their senses, particularly hearing when engaging in combat.  Especially against multiple enemies.  And is it just me, or did Ryan Reynolds completely suck in this?  His jokes are not funny in the least bit.  This was my first exposure to Reynolds and I have to say, he never quite recovered as an actor for this writer.

Goyer decided to, for whatever reason, to make Blade a supporting character in his own movie.  He is given nothing to do but react to the Nightstalkers poorly written dialogue.  And the antagonist Drake, is nothing more than a Eurotrash joke.  At the end of the film he tells Blade that he respects him for fighting with honor.

After two better than we deserved films the third Blade is a mess. For one thing the casting director is insane. The good guys consist of Snipes, Gabby Hayes (Kris Kristofferson), Elektra (Jessica Biel), Van Wilder (Ryan Reynolds), a retarded guy, a blind woman and Newt from Aliens.

The good guys have a ""club"" called the Nightstalkers. (What no Darren McGavin). Biel fights with an overtly plugged iPod playing horrible techno. (I would think being able to hear would be important in hand-to-hand combat) Reynolds's character spouts off endless one liners (most of them remarkably lame) and is saddled with the name Hannibal King. (Also needless to say remarkably lame) and fights with a light saber bow. (Please see above).

Speaking of lame we have the bad guys. We have wrestler triple H (who cannot act), Parker Posey (who cannot speak with the fangs in her mouth) and best of all Dracula (Who calls himself Drake. Thinks he is in a Highlander movie. He is also a pacifist piece of Euro trash that looks like he fell of a Harlequin romance book cover. And is easily the least convincing screen Dracula I have ever scene (I'm including both George Hamilton and Mel Brooks in this equation).

The script is awful (even if you remove Reynolds's one-liners), the film was edited in a Cuisinart, the continuity was done by the blind girl, and the plot consists of bad guys finding good guys headquarters, then good guys finding bad guys headquarters.

If your still not convinced a contribution to Mr. Snipes potential legal defense fund is in order let me remind you. Parker Posey is the head vampire and has a climatic battle with Van Wilder. You can make the check out to cash.",1255996800,,1958,4.713450292397661

If you are a fan of Reynolds' humor than you will not be let down at all by his quick witted jokes that he throws into the mix of things on scene. After watching the movie I did find the special effects to be really good and not too over the top and ""CG"", as I had expected them to be. The story line does not fall short either and despite the fact that I have not seen any of the other Blade movies, I was still able to follow the movie very well and not feel as though I was missing a big part of the story from having not seen any prior Blade movies.

What could have been a decent man-out-of-time tale is out-weighed by cringingly bad dialog and a story often mirroring it's predecessors too much (Blade teaming up, loved one killed, underdog suits up for vengeance against the big dogs). So, what should have been a mediocre, hackneyed if watchable rehash becomes an uneven choppy mess thanks to haphazardly edited fight scenes, out of place and sexually insecure jokesters Ryan Reynolds and Parker Posey and their gratuitous Freud jokes, and so many plot holes and illogic in the story you may think this is a parody. Another killer is disinterested and generally uninspired Snipes (though he has a few flashes of attitude here and there) leading to more screen time for Reynolds and Biel.

The plot was atrocious. First off, aren't vampires supposed to get stronger the older they are? So why is the first vampire running from Blade? Why do they seem matched in power? Dracula should have wiped the floor with Blade.

The opening sequence was alright, but from there it just went downhill. About the only good parts of this movie are the fact that Wesley Snipes and Kris Kristofferson are both in it again.

So, it comes down to a lot of trilogies--the first two are great, but the third you should only buy if you absolutely LOVE the character, regardless of how bad the movie they put him/her into is. I just picked this one up because it was dirt cheap and I hadn't seen it.",1193616000,2,678,4.2890625

2245291,4,B0007V6ITE,"I was worried that the final movie in the trilogy would run out of ideas, and was afraid it would be so far different than the first film, since Blade 2 already took it to another direction from the first.  Trinity actually returns a bit to the original movie, but with still some fresh ideas in the mix, and the coolest of all - the return of Dracula.

In Trinity, the vampires are back without the virus that infected them in the 2nd film.  They bring back the oldest and purest vampire to ever live who goes by many names, but most familiar is ""Dracula""  He is able to walk in daylight, and they are hoping to use him to be able to do the same.  Meanwhile, Blade is set up for murdering a human, and becomes the number one wanted criminal in the town.  The new charcaters eneter the scene - Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds) and Abagail Whistler (Jessica Biel) who help Blade and introduce him to their group of vampire hunters.

Surprisingly, the addition of two more heores to the film was played out nicely.  Unlike Batman & Robin (a film that stank no matter how you look at it)  the adiditon of Robin and Bat Girl was ridiculous and pushed Batman aside.  Not in Blade Trinity.  Everyone has their own space, and fights their own fights.  Another good thing about this film is it improves over the 2nd with much less use of CGI.  The fights look real again, much like in the first film.  As far as fights go, I found there to be plenty of action, but actually less overall compared to the first two films.  While Blade's final one on one in Blade 2 was my favorite in the trilogy, his fight against Dracula was rather spectacular too.  Hannibal king also gets to fight a huge vampire bare fisted, played by Triple H - who not surprsingly gets in a few rather cool wrestling moves.

Overall, Trinity is a pleasing end to the trilogy.  It actually opens more doors in a way than closes, but Spike TV went on to create Blade the series in 2006, which is worth checking out if its available to you.  In Trinity, I enjoyed the plot more than Blade 2, but in the end the first Blade is supreme.  The entire trilogy though, is one of the coolest trilogies ever created - go get it today.",1184371200,,2183,4.303921568627451

2245293,1,B0007V6ITE,"A big hurdle for any comic series adapted to film is making a good third entry into the series. Just look at the record so far; Superman III, Batman Forever, and now Blade: Trinity. The third installment in the Blade series is a true disappointment and a sad conclusion to a promising trilogy.
Wesley Snipes phones in a poor performance and the usually good Dominic Percell is badly miscast as Dracula. Why Snipes would ignore his only worthy action role in his up and down career is very odd.
David Goyer, who wrote the previous two installments, seems bored with the task of completing his trilogy and shows that he hasn't quite mastered the art of directing yet, a job he got after Blade II director Guillermo Del Toro left the project to direct Hellboy.
Blade the character is all but omitted from this movie, replaced by Ryan Reynold's and Jessica Biel's Night stalkers and Kriss Kristopherson's Whistler character is pointlessly killed off after he was resurrected in the last movie.
Goyer had stated in many an interview that Whistler's death and resurrection were all planned parts of the trilogy since the beginning, but killing him again in the first five minutes of this film shows that the direction of the trilogy was changed from what was originally intended.
The tone of the film leans toward the camp end of the spectrum, and some of the humor and one-liners may leave the bad taste of ""Batman and Robin"" in some viewer's mouths (example: Blade pulling out a copy of Tomb of Dracula, the Marvel comic book in which he first appeared). while the special effects are clunky and obvious, as opposed to the cutting edge stuff seen in previous installments of the series. The only bright spot in the movie is Ryan Reynolds as Hannibal King, who steals the show, but even he can't save this mediocre mess.

What a shame that the first Blade film, which saved comic book adaptations after the appalling ""Batman and Robin"" in 1997, languishes here in what should have been a great movie. Watch Blade and Blade 2, but skip this dreck.",1182038400,,2041,4.701117318435754

 giving up too much info,the vampires need help from an ancient source,

and they want to kill Blade, of course...the "" day walker"" that he is.

The movie has special effects that will have you gapping, and all the vampire

To my personal tastes (and that's all they are), Action Adventure Babes have never been so enjoyable as those Ms. Biel portrays in her growing string of action and thriller movies.  So I would have been quite happy with this movie if it had just been another chance for me to see my favorite AAB doing her thing.  Frankly, I was afraid that the rest of the movie was going to be a let down for me, compared to the previous two Blade flicks, but I was pleasantly surprised and quickly went out to buy the DVD after seeing this one in the theater.

Since the vampires turn to ashes when they die, and there's never any proof that they even exist, Blade is under suspicion. The police come to his hideout, kill Whistler, and capture Blade in an attempt to stop his bloody reign. What they don't realize is that they are mere pawns in the vampires' game. The vampires have raised Dracula (or Drake) the original vampire. They plan to use him to kill Blade and then have free reign of the world.  What they don't expect is that a rescue team comprised of Whistler's daughter and a former vampire named Hannibal King will come and save Blade. Together, the three of them will fight the vampires and try to find a serum that will put an end to their immortal race.

This is by far my favorite of the Blade movies. The combination of Wesley Snipes' arrogant demeanor, Jessie Biel's no-nonsense butt-kicking, and Ryan Reynolds' sarcastic humor make them a threat to be reckoned with. That and Parker Posey's role as the high-maintenance vampire leader make this movie worth watching. That and the fact that Dracula is HOT.

It had the witty sarcasm, it had the funny one liners, but it was missing the cool chorerography that the earlier fims had and the story seemed neutered.  However, that was the theatrical version.  The dvd contains the theatrical version as well as the uncut version.  The uncut version is almost an entirely different ride.  By including the parts that were chopped, Blade 3 becomes more fluid and a lot darker. Some will tell you that Dominic Purcell doesn't work as Dracula, but they're high.

Purcell, Parker, Reynolds, Triple H, Biel, they all do a decent job for their first time in a Blade flick.  There's even a level of chemistry between Biel, Reynolds and Snipes.  Is this movie as dark as the first two? Nope.  But it has the fighting, it has the special effects and the story is still a lot better than most vampire flicks.

As for the weaknesses.  Reynolds comes off kind of a bit too much like he did in Van Wilder.  In fact, at times he'll just seem like Van Wilder with guns.  The overuse of Apple products was a bit nauseating, love em or hate em, there's no need for ipod commercials while a movie is going on.  But other than that, the uncut version is the way to go...

Blade Trinity delivers well as a comic book adaption(in the comic though the Night Stalkers were actually Blade,Hannibal King and Drake,Drake who was a vampire hunter in the comics was changed to Dracula for the film,for some strange reason).This movie isn't very deep,story wise(what's there is good though).The action on the other hand is top-notch and the special effects are superb.

Think Godfather III in the Godfather series and you'll know why to bypass this awful film. This movie simply lacks the raw emotional and psychological underpinnings that established and refined the Blade character in the first two films. Without these attributes, the follow-on action and violence in the film (an artistic staple in the Blade franchise) even lacks the heart-stopping emotional quality you'd expect.

The Story of this movie is about how Blade must face off with the first and only perfect vampire,  Dracula.  The story isn't that bad.  It isn't amazing but its easy to follow and make sense, (as much sense as a vampire movie can make).  The cast is likable, for the most part that is.  Ryan Reynolds is extremely annoying.  He reminds me of Shawn William Scott.  He has the same arrogant tone of voice and the same ""ha-ha I think I'm really funny"" attitude.  His jokes in the movie are plentiful, but too bad none of them are actually funny.  In one scene, Reynolds asks Jessica Biel if is blade hates him, and she says ""yeah.""  All I could think was, I can't blame Blade for hating him.  Jessica Biel does a great job as a girl who can actually fight with the men without EVER getting into a bind.  There are a lot of female's-who-kick-butt characters these days in movies but most will need help from a man at one point, (Trinity in the Matrix needed Neo to save her a few times, Elektra in Daredevil was killed by Bulls eye), or if not, she will fight only other women, (Rachel Weisz in the Mummy Returns had to fight Oded Fehr instead of any of the men).  Jessica never does either of those.  She is a real strong female and even works together with Blade at the end instead of Reynolds, who at the time is being beaten by another strong woman, Parker Posey.  Parker is great with cheeky characters.  Dominic Purcell as Dracula does a good job too, although his character is the most blah Dracula I have ever seen on screen.  The action is good.  It can look a bit stiff at times, but for the most part its good.  The ending is okay, nothing special.

2245306,5,B0007V6ITE,"This Unrated version is quite good. Going on the commentaries and features, quite a bit of the Good Material was Chopped out for no decent  reason. The advantage is that Goyer as writer-director and creator of Blade as we Know him, is in the unique position of being inside the films as no other person can be. About all I would have changed is the start and finish credits, especially the end section which has some material that is just so out of character for the style of film; as some say, which might be true in this case, too many cooks spoil the broth. However, overall this film is a gem.
The commentaries with Goyer, and part of the features , explain why Blade is in the current  Predicament, but needless to say this is a step up from the standard Blade world. Especially with the Directors technique of using up to 7 or 8 cameras at any one time.
The criticism of Jessica Biel is really just sour Grapes, she pulls off the hyper fit  and well trained Vampire hunter in a way few could do. She really does fulfill  her role in many ways, so the criticism are not in my view valid.
Good DVD  Menu's, very inspired.
DISK 1:  The Extras here are two sets of commentaries. Neither of which live up to what they could be, but Goyer with Ryan and Jessica is the lesser of the two. Commentary 2, much more in the technical realm, and perhaps in some  respects supplements commentary 1.
DISK 2: The Blade 3 Features are Beyond Good. Just sit down and watch them at one sitting... otherwise how will you know where the  Esperanto is in the film ?? :-)
The Alternate ending in Shanghai cannot be serious, it is well filmed, but just utter rubbish.
Goyer Interviews Goyer is not only a good technical feat, but a good insight to the director versus writer quandry.

This totally unnecessary, almost blasphemous departure from the tone and mood cultivated by the first two films does incredible harm to the 'Blade' mythos.

The storyline couldn't have been any better. The Vampire Nation seek out the originator of their ancestoral bloodline locked away in the Syrian desert and revive the legend. Drake i.e. Dracula (Dominic Purcell) is called upon to do battle with the greatest enemy of all vampires, Blade the Daywalker.

Unfortunately, that sort of story-telling is absent in Blade: Trinity, which mostly feels tired, despite the gung-ho willingness of Ryan Reynolds and the terribly earnest Jessica Biel. Snipes' one-note attitude gets cartoonish in this chapter and, honestly, any movie that makes fun of a vampire's haircut but lets Blade's pass without comment has some serious blindspots.

The film also relies on viewers having seen the second Blade movie, otherwise the tri-part vampire mouths on several vamps in this movie will just be baffling. This probably isn't a big issue, since most viewers will have seen the other two movies in the series, but it seems careless not to address this in at least a single throwaway line.

Sloppiest of all, though, is the finale, where Blade's ""final gift"" is never explained and is mostly a ""huh?"" moment.

Wesley Snipes was upset with the original cut.  Blade simply was not Blade.  With the recut, Blade walked that sword's edge between the dark and the light.

Sadly Blade 3 secumbs to this in spades. The opening monologue is an indication of how 'seen it all before' the movies will quickly become. Despite an intriguing first scene in the Iraqi Desert soon Wesley Snipes is reduced to trying to keep the dignity of his character intact in the face of monotonous and unfunny wise-cracking from Ryan Reynolds and attractive-but-bland Jessica Biel. I did wonder if a new element might be injected via a possible sense of dependence between Blade and the small girl character but she was quickly side-lined. Swearing seems omnipresent but frankly serves to underline how much difficulty the makers seem to have generating fresh genuine dialogue. Odd non-sensical touches made me feel the makers had only been paying half-attention to what they were creating, for example an experienced warrior like Abigail Whistler goes into battle plugged into her MP3 rather than with unimpeded hearing, which might save her and her comrades lives. At the source of the Army of Darkness this time  there was Dominic Purcell, not a bad actor but far too limited in both charisma and depth for a character of Dracula's stature. The monologue at the start refers to old Hammer Dracula movies and having Christopher Lee in his prime opposite Blade would have injected a much needed adrenaline rush. Aside from a one-line moment on the roof-tops with Snipes, Purcell's Vampiric WMD seems like a male stripper for most of it. ""Drake's"" dialogue seems bland as well,given that his 'retirement' to the Syrian Desert is supposed to underline his superiority to modern human culture. Kris Kristofferson also checks out for the second time and, after the power of his previous 'death' in part one, this time it seems like a very hurried and half-hearted exit. Visually it has it's moments, and capable actors like Parker Posey struggle on gamely but I find myself hoping that if there is a Blade 4, Blade himself is allowed to take center stage again rather than being relegated to almost a supporting role. The director of Blade 3, rather like George Lucas in recent years, has a strong visual sense but no substantial grasp of actors, dialogue or how to build real emotional depth.",1140220800,,2452,4.995110024449878
2245316,2,B0007V6ITE,"I could see where the script was probably a lot better than the application. Great ideas (the return of Dracula, the addition of two-more vampire hunters - the very attractive Jessica Biel and the very funny Ryan Reynolds, and the end of Blade's world as he knows it) met average directing and poor performances by the main evil character (Dominic Purcell).

If the Dracula character had been played by an actor with some depth we could have seen a more poignant and intense movie (Dracula, a creature of ancient customs feeling out of time in the modern world).

Instead we get a movie that has pretty good action scenes with its most redeeming concept being a spin-off of the two characters played by Biel and Reynolds. I hope that happens!",1139702400,2,742,4.7

2245318,1,B0007V6ITE,"The Blade series had a very powerful start when the original ""Blade"" was made; had they never done any movies afterwards, it would have been just perfect. The second movie was nothing like the first but was still watchable. Blade Trinity is a disasterous end to a very original story.

There is so much criticism that one could have for such a movie, but I would just mention some:

1. Dracula being a Sumerian from ancient Mesopotamia has been in hybernation for who knows how long, wakes up speaking English, understands modern-day expressions and sarcasm, and acts completely like an average american. What is that?

2. The scene where people were kept as blood donors in a chemically induced coma was just too much. It looked like the producers ran out of money and ideas and just came up with a 10 minutes scene about absolutely nothing. I don't understand what purpose it served by being there.

3. The MP3 player that the whistler girl had on while doing the ""hunting"" was too cheesy. It is not clear whether this appeals to an audience over 13 years of age.

4. Blade was turned from a hero to a wimp. His action scenes very much depended on the ""nightstalkers"" helping him. That sense of independence was completely lost

5. The exchange of foul language between Blade and Dracula was unnecessary. Not that I'm an advocate of censorship or anything, but in this particular case it served no purpose. That ties back into crticism number 1. How on earth would a Sumerian warrior understand or use such words.

Overall, this movie has no clear plot. It seems like the director shot a series unrelated scenes, pasted them next to each other, and just called it a movie. A really disappointing end to a great story.",1139011200,5,1719,4.653465346534653
2245319,1,B0007V6ITE,"Picking up at the tail end of a a great action franchise, David Goyer manages to murder it with an extreme finality. A decisively fatal blow that the incompetent, non-threatening vampire antagonists in Blade Trinity can only dream about. While it's admirable that he would attempt to 'stamp' this film with his unique style, less flattering are the realizations early and often that (a) he fails miserably in both writing and directing and that (b) realizing both roles means he only compounds his own errors at each turn.

Directed in a Michael-Bay-remakes-Torque style, Goyer hides a water thin plot behind accelerated running, slow motion walking, more one liners then 'The Last Boy Scout', and well.. random nonsensical development. Supposedly, our storyline is that Blade, long the scourge of the vampire nation, is now the victim of a sprawling conspiracy plot wherein law enforcement and the media are used to frame him for murdering a human.

Other than making blade finally turn into a vampire it was the most logical direction to conclude the franchise. Not logical is the concurrent plot that the 'original vampire, Dracula, has been found in Syria and resurrected to lead the vampire nation. This is problematic because of the limitations of Goyer's imagination, which forces the original vampire to simply be a more muscular version of Stephen Dorff from the first film, without any of the screen presence or entertaining dialogue. The same limitations apply to the vampires' plot to kill Blade which seem to rest largely on the idea of putting him in a room in handcuffs. In fact several of the sequences including the ending seem to directly contradict everything else established about him.

- If he is in fact so powerful why is he at turns treated with abject fear and simply reservation by his subordinates?

- If he decides to take care of Blade himself, why does he simply lead Blade on a homoerotic, crouching tiger influenced, building top chase to give Blade an ultimatum?

- The blood bank so crucial to vampires is guarded by.. a woman sitting at a computer?

- If Dracula is in fact a shape shifter how does he walk to a hidden fortress in his regular clothes and then assume the appearance of a man wearing a trench coat?

- Are his clothes shape shifting as well?

It's not just the suspension of belief that damns this movie, it's the suspension of interesting dialogue story, plot development, or characterization that destroys it from the beginning.

Additionally, Goyer's directing reveals a skill that certain filmmakers (spielberg and cameron come to mind) have that others seemingly never will. Scale, the creation of it, and the consistency of it are far, far beyond his skill, as is action direction. Goyer's revelation of dracula for example looks no better than a commercial for a Xena rerun. No individual characters are impressive throughout, and even the epic ending conflict feels smaller than the conclusion of the second film in the series. There are a couple of positives. One, the idea that a blind woman watches the security cameras with her young daughter is the funniest idea since the central premise of 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.' Two, Ryan Reynolds is great on screen and consistently funny in an otherwise uninteresting story. And third, Jessica Biel is gorgeous. So.. make that a few positives.

Let's hope if this series goes in the indicated ""Night Stalkers track down Blade"" direction, a competent person is given the charge of the story. until then just watch Underworld or the first two Blade flicks again.",1137974400,19,3580,4.951666666666667
2245320,5,B0007V6ITE,"Nothing will ever match the sublime brilliance of the first Blade movie, but this is a worthwhile companion to the series.  Here, the moviemakers keep the black/techno/blood coolness, but they also inject plenty of levity (love the vampire Pomeranian!).  The comic young male Blade sidekick got a little old, but looking beyond him, it's a great movie with some awesome action and a kicking soundtrack.  Parker Posey's vampire is eerily wicked and depraved.

Having originally watched the movie in the theater, I was surprised by the extended director's edition.  It really dragged out the exposition of the story, making the beginning much longer than necessary.  I recommend watching the theater version instead.",1135468800,,714,5.330357142857143
2245321,5,B0007V6ITE,"I must say even though I was somewhat skeptical about the 'Blade' franchise when I first heard about it, the movies have thoroughly impressed me.  The first film, ""Blade"", provided a terrific introduction into the Blade mythos.  ""Blade 2"" expanded greatly upon the war between Blade and the vampires that was depicted in the first film.  Now, New Line Cinema has released the supposed final chapter in the 'Blade' saga, ""Blade: Trinity"".  Let me just say this, if this is truly the final chapter for Blade's movies, then it was a terrific close to an excellent trilogy.

""Blade: Trinity"" finds Blade (Wesley Snipes) being constantly pursued by the authorities, and Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) trying to warn him that he will not always be around to watch his back, and that Blade should find some help in this continuing war with the vampires.  But before any help could be found, Whistler is killed in a raid on Blade's headquarters.  Now, Whistler is dead, and Blade is in custody, it seems all hope is lost for humanity and that the vampires will now reign supreme, especially since they have resurrected the vampire that started it all, Dracula.  Hearing Blade has been captured an underground group of vampire hunters known as the Nighstalkers, are going to mount a rescue to free Blade, in hopes that he will lead them into battle against Dracula and his minions.  Leading the rescue is Abigail (Jessica Biel), Whistler's daughter, and Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds), a former vampire turned vampire hunter.  After successfully freeing Blade from custody, the Nighstalkers try to convince Blade to join them, but he declines, that is until he is made aware that Dracula has been unleashed upon the world, and now it's up to Blade and the Nighstalkers to destroy Dracula and save humanity.

One outstanding part of this trilogy is the fact that not only did Wesley Snipes reprise his role of Blade for each installment (generally a must for any franchise to endure), but writer David S. Goyer (""The Crow: City of Angels"", ""Blade"", and ""Blade 2"") came back to write this final chapter in the trilogy, but he also directed it.  This seems especially fitting, since David S. Goyer wrote all of the films in this franchise, allowing him to direct makes perfect sense, due to the fact that aside from Wesley Snipes, no one probably knows this character better.  The acting in this film is great, the new additions to the trilogy add a lot of fun and chemistry to the mix.  Ryan Reynolds and Jessica Biel really shine in this movie, Parker Posey and WWE's Triple H, also do great jobs as Dracula's two main goons.  The special effects are great, and when Dracula changes into his monstrous form, it is both an interesting twist to the character, but also spectacular to see.

If you enjoyed the first two movies in the 'Blade' series, then by all means wait no longer and go watch ""Blade: Trinity"".  I promise, you will not be disappointed.

""Blade: Trinity"" is rated R for violence, language, and sensuality.",1135296000,10,3009,4.809708737864078
2245322,2,B0007V6ITE,"So does Blade: because he thinks it makes him look bad.

Baaaad, you know, Bad. And when you're a strapped-up, lip-twitchin', no-sh*t takin', leather-cape/trenchcoat-wearin', silver-sword-swingin', vampire-booty-down-takin' hybrid human-vampire hunter, well---well, man, you gotta look baaaaaad.

The problem is, for all his baaaaadness, Blade (Snipes, who has the role down to the tiniest nostril flare) is pretty much a one-trick pony. Go figure: drive your Ducati through enough downtown vampire techno-rave club/stripper bars, shove enough silver in enough bloodsuckin' bigwigs, and sooner or later you'll attract Heat. Serious, serious Heat.

So: Blade gets set up (gee, like that'd be hard). Blade gets smacked down by the Fuzz. Blade gets hauled into the high-maintenance claws of Uber Vamp B*tch Danica Talos (the delightful Parker Posey, who can go from the Sublime to the Ridiculous---and back!---in about as much time as it would take to count to Blade's IQ.

Now: while watching wrestler Triple H (Jarko Grimwood---man oh man, the things I could havd done in high school if I'd had *that* name) use Blade's head as a muscle ball would be greatly amusing, it wouldn't have made for much of a flick.

So: Hannibal King (Ryan ""Abs"" Reynolds) and Abigail Whistler (Jessica ""Nubile"" Biel), a dynamic duo from the vamp-hunting squad The Nighstalkers (yeah, there are more of them, and no, you don't need to worry about it because they're a) boring and b) don't last long) head over to police HQ to break the Man out.

A**-whupping (Blade & Biel) & Smart-a**ery (Reynolds) ensue.

Oh wait, I'm getting ahead of myself: there's a backstory, see. The Vampire Nation---you remember those guys, the uber-vamps who run everything behind the scenes and have all their heavies hang around in bike helmets---anyway, they helicopter out to a dig in the Syrian desert, where they decide to do a little quality spelunking in a Sumerian temple---not because they're looking for a little walkabout, but because supposedly this temple holds the crypt of the Oldest Vampire of All---dare we say it? The Big D!, ladies & gentlemen.

Turns out the Big D is sorta like a humongous ant-lion with a nasty temper.

Anyway, the Big D has a little breakfast, sheds his skin, and hangs out with his new buddies at the Vampire Nation, who, of course, have a nefarious plot against the humans using Dracul---umm, sorry, his name is Drake (Dominic Purcell, who is at least as scary as this one waiter at the local sushi place).

In turn, of course, the humans have this bada** uber-plot against the Vampires. Why does it always have to be this way? Why some world-shattering plot that will totally wipe out one side or the other? Can't we all just get along?

Anyway:

1)There's a lot of techno coolness that is sorta bequeathed from the previous Blade installments. I think it's frankly pretty crunk that Biel whups vamp hiney to the mad-steppin' beats of her I-Pod.

2)Dracu---uh, I mean Drake---s*cks, and not blood. He's so scary he spends the entire film running away from Blade and beating up babies and a few pimply goth kids. He's such a pansy he has to imitate Whistler Senior to get into the Nightstalkers' base. Wimp.

3) Eric Bogosian's little stint as a talk-show host (""Sexual!"") is worth the price of admission.

4) Did I mention how much I enjoyed Parker Posey (Danica)? She can't act her way out of a paper sack, but she brings a sort of Euro-trash street-sensibility mostly absent in the second outting. Bet she'd have gotten along famously with Deacon Frost: anyway, Posey can bite my carotid anytime she wants.

5)David Goyer might be able to write the stuff---he has a handle on his wild little world---but he lacks the style of a Norrington or the horror of a Del Toro. As such, ""Blade Trinity""---while hip, techno, and amusing---feels bland by comparison.

Though that said, there is Biel, with a bow. And did I mention Parker Posey?

This movie is an ok movie. Basically if you really like the movies you will like this one. But I thought this movie was missing somthing that the other ones had. I am gonna talk about the dvd aspects of the 2 disc unrated widescreen edition.

  IMAGE:

Wow it dosent get much better than this visually on DVD! The 2.35:! anamorphic widescreen presentation brillantly captures each and every detail of the way the film looked during its recent theatrical release and flawslessly transfers each and every nuance of that. Each and every shot features crystal clear images, extremely well-defined thanks to a great deal of sharpness and overall clarity. The wide varity of colors come across splendidly,with shadow levels and contrast holding up especially well, which is very impressive for a film that takes place mostly at night and in dark places. I challenge you to find even a speck of dirt or bit of grain,as there's not one print flaw here.

  SOUND:

The audio rocks too, with Dolby Digital 5.1 EX and DTS ES mixes on board. The Dolby Digital track actually gets the slight nod,thanks to its larger bass presence and overall oomph. The DTS track does provide a slightly more enveloping experience,which is apparent when Dracula rises during the film's opening sequence. There's no problem with dialogue clarity on either track, and the added bass presence in the Dolby Digital 5.1 mix even gives the actors speech a bit of lift from time to time as well. Still,both tracks are two of the best to grace a DVD so far this year,so you cant go wrong picking either one.

2245326,3,B0007V6ITE,"When the movie began, and the vampire gave the middle finger to the sun, i knew this was going to be a cheesy ride.

Blade is the same old calm and cool vampire hunter. That much hasn't changed. But his new screen mates don't bring much to the table.

Whistler is pretty much undead himself. It seems he dies every movie yet comes back. Yawn.

That new male character, his name escapes me is really really lame. His jokes get old so quick and it doesnt help that any of his jokes are not funny. Most of his lines were so bad that they made me cringe.

Though Abigail looked good, thats about as much i can say about her. Her lines and emotional range were non existant in the movie.

And Dracula? Wow... what a dissapointment.

He did not fit his role whatsoever. From his stupid look, to his terrible acting, to his lame combat prowess. Blade killed him with pretty much no trouble at all.

Blade Trilogy is still a fun little romp to watch on cable but it doesnt compare to his previous two titles. See it for some action and nothing more.",1133049600,,1041,4.280612244897959
2245327,3,B0007V6ITE,"I love the first two Blade movies with a passion. The first one is a fast paced, sharp, big time action/horror flick, and the second one dials everything the first one had to offer up to the fabled Spinal Tap eleven. Wesley Snipes, who normally couldn't act his way out of a blood soaked paper bag, is absolutely amazing as the title character. He inhabits Blade in that same way magical way that Hugh Jackman does Wolverine, or more recently the way Ron Perlman became Hellboy. Snipes has made Blade, a mediocre bit character from a few poorly read Marvel comics, into an iconic cinematic figure, with a little help from great directors like Guillermo Del Toro and a talented writer in David Goyer. Goyer in fact, wrote all three Blade movies and with the success of the first two somehow got it into New Line's collective head that he could also direct. He can't.

Blade: Trinity has Wesley Snipes returning to the one thing he's ever really been good at, playing Blade, only to be teamed up with a pair of snot nosed brats. Ok, to be fair, Ryan Reynolds and Jessica Biel are actually quite good, Ryan's character of Hannibal King being the most memorable of the two. Biel plays Whistler's daughter, no not the one that was killed off by a sadistic vampire, another one that we conveniently didn't know about. It seems that Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) has been busy in the singles scene when Blade's not around. Hannibal King is an ex-vampire who took the serum that fixed Whistler up in Blade II and now uses his time and energy to hunt the bastards who made him a vamp in the first place. They're Whistler's backup plan, and they insinuate themselves and their vampire hunting team into Blade's life when Blade ends up alone and being hunted by the police.

The local head vampire bitch Danica (Parker Posey), has Blade on tape murdering a human (one of her familiars), and happily hands over the tape to the police who begin scouring the city for our blood sucker slaughtering hero. Posey is great as a pissy little vampire wench, but she's not the real boss of the operation. The film opens with a rather lame tomb sequence in which Posey and her fairly faceless group of cronies (which yes, includes the rather pointless wrestling star HHH) resurrect Dracula, the original vampire. Don't get all spoiler retentive, it's all over the trailers and if you can't figure it out from that I can't help you.

The problem with Goyer's script is that it falls back on the tired old clich of easy solution super weapons. For the vampires, Dracula is supposed to be their ""final solution"", for the Bladeketeers there is a super virus, which with the addition of a Dracula blood sample will wipe out all the vampires in the vicinity with a big poof of plot resolving smoke. I'm tired of that type of copout and would have preferred to see Blade forced to slaughter all his foes one by one, rather than just holding them off until Goyer could come up with an easy way to solve all his problems with a wave of his hand. There's also really no need for Blade's companions, capable though both Reynolds and Biel may be. Blade has always been best as a lone and physically imposing figure stalking city streets, like the ultimate bringer of vampire death. Blade doesn't need backup, and in Blade II when he had it, he was happy to feed his backup to the bad guys, whenever it suited him. Now he's saddled with the makings of a full on family, one that really doesn't do him any credit. Hannibal King is a funny and charismatic character, and Whistler II pulls off a few great action bits, but I'd rather have had their screen time replaced with more of Snipes who is still absolutely top of his game when it comes to being Blade.

With the addition of more hero characters, the character of Blade himself has lost a lot of the depth he had originally. He's become more of a vampire killing automaton that the other more talkative characters follow around. Goyer's direction is almost reflective of that, as a lot of the film's big action sequences seem almost perfunctory. Vampires dissolve into flame with an almost careless abandon, none of them really presenting any sort of interesting challenge for the Daywalker until he works his way up to the head honcho. Somehow, Blade has become Dracula's equal, and by comparison now all the other vampires are about on par with any gun toting human when it comes to threat assessment. We're supposed to be impressed when Dracula leaps off a building and Blade follows, as if this is a power unique to the original vampire. Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't all vampires used to be able to do stuff like that? In this movie the vampires have become incredibly weak and so killing them just isn't as much fun.

While Goyer's big action money shots are a bit bland, his choices aren't all bad. I really liked the way he contrasts his day shots with night, by overexposing daylight to make it incredibly sharp and bright. He also does some interesting things with the way he shoots his vampires; sometimes flipping in and out of a jerky, almost hyper real way of filming that makes the world around them seem inhuman. He throws in a nice chase scene too, which has Blade pursuing the pointy toothed baddies down the highway in an overpowered muscle car. When he comes up on a vampire riding a motorcycle, Blade doesn't shoot him, he hits the nitro's and drives right over him. The soundtrack also adds a lot to what does work in Trinity's action sequences, filled with hard almost guttural growling sounds and fast pace techno/rap and bass beats. That sort of soundtrack can be a flop in the wrong circumstances, but used properly it leaves you ready to leave the theater and beat the crap out of some hapless theater popcorn pusher just for kicks.

Blade: Trinity is not a disastrous entry into the vampire hunter franchise, but it fails to live up to the slick excitement of its predecessors. With great performances from Snipes, Posey, Reynolds, and Biel, all the blame for that has to be laid squarely on the shoulders of the man of many hats, David Goyer. Goyer was in large part responsible for making Blade what it is, but that clearly didn't qualify him to direct. With Snipes becoming such a problem to work with on set, it's likely that this will be the last outing for Blade, unless New Line goes ahead with their proposed Bladeless spin-off featuring the Hannibal King and Whistler Jr. characters. Goyer tries his best with Blade: Trinity but ends up with an entry that is far too often flat and uninspired. It's a shame Blade's ride had to end in mediocrity.",1132444800,,6607,4.599660729431722

But after a rocky first half, the story finally kicks into gear, the characters become more fully defined, and the movie belatedly engages our interest.

Abigal (played by Jessica Biel) is okay but not all that! Nice to look at and has a few cool moves but that's it! Hannibal King (played by Ryan Reynolds), on the other hand, was a cool new character. The only knock on him is that he seemed to try TOO HARD to be funny!

HHH, in my view, was surprisingly effective as Jacko Grimwald. Still, he better not give up his WWE dayjob or his bodybuilding side job! As for Dracula, he's easily the weakest villian in all three Blades! The best villian is still Deacon Frost from the first movie! ""Angel"" from Buffy The Vampire Slayer could've gave Blade a better fight at the end! Hell, Buffy herself could've gave Blade more of a battle! I just thought they could've made the King Of The Vampires just a little more formadable than they did.

This film was has some of the worst vampires {except for Triple H} I've ever seen, and Drake {Purcell} is the worst Dracula in film history. That crap about Dracula being one of his names, and his name is Drake. That's stuipd, he only goes by Dracula or Vlad Dracula.

The fight scenes are just boring. One thing dumb in that film is Abigail {Biel} is listening to an MP3 while she's fighting, talk about stupidity. Blade {Snipes} doesn't do much in this film, I can see why Snipes hates this film.

However, Hannibal King {Reynolds} is good in this film, he even outshined Blade in this film. This film has a very stupid ending and the unrated version makes the ending even more stupider {won't say if you haven't seen this yet}.

They should've just left it at Blade 2 being the last one. David S. Goyer should be a shamed of himself, he did a good job writing Blade and Blade 2. But, when he decided to write and direct Blade: Trinity, he just messed it up.

Storyline is pretty much the same except this time Blade joins forces with the night hunters to kill the father of all vampires, Dracula (Drake).  Seemed like a pretty interesting storyline at first, but all the corny jokes made it real hard to take this movie seriously.  Besides Snipes, the acting was marginal at best.  The writers have gone too far with the whole vampire thing, and yes this movie has vampire dogs.

Perhaps the main thing that turned me off from this movie was that the fight scenes was nothing more than a conglomeration of wrestling moves, hence my title.  I found it very hard to sit through this crap being forced to see the same wrestling moves that I can see by watching WWE.

I usually buy DVD's to collect them and have Blade 1 and 2 on DVD, however its been nearly a year since I seen this movie and I still don't know if I want to waste my money on this.  I'd pay $5 for this movie at most but not retail price.

2245336,3,B0007V6ITE,"I finally got around to seeing ""Blade: Trinity"". I loved the first two films in the sleek, stylish vampire trilogy but the final chapter in the series proved to be somewhat of a disappointment.

Blade (Wesley Snipes) is framed for a murder of a human being by a vampire named Danica Talos (Parker Posey)and her vampire crew. With Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) gone, Blade is forced to join forces with ragtag bunch of vampire hunters who calls them the Nightstalkers lead by Abigail Whistler (Jessica Biel) and former vampire Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds). The three of them goes after Danica and her vampire crew along with Dracula whom they had resurrected from his eternal sleep.

The first Blade film was stylish and cool as heck. Lots of cool action sequences and plenty of angst. The second Blade film (which is my personal favorite) is darker with vampires being the victims as well as humans with mutated vampires hunting them down. That film was pretty creepy and excellent special effects.

Unfortunately ""Blade: Trinity"" proved to be a lackluster closer to the Blade series. After awhile into the film, I got tired of Hannibal's wisecracks. He was funny for the  first half of the film but afterwards, his jokes grew stale. I don't know why but I also got tired of Wesley Snipe's angsty performance as the half-vampire/half-human leading character Blade. He still was the same bad@$$ self but after two films of that, it gets tiring to watch (at least to me). Jessica Biel was pretty cool as Whistler's daughter Abigail. The introduction to her character in the film was one of the few highlights for me. Great action sequences. I loved the weapons she used. I dug Parker Posey as Danica Talos. I would have loved to have seen her and Abigail go at it at the end but alas they didn't. The worst performances has to go to Natasha Lyonne as Sommerfield who was pretty laughable as a blind scientist. That was a bit much for me. Paul Jean Levesque (aka Triple H) was over the top and really not a far stretch from his wrestling alter ego. What is it about wrestlers wanting to get into movies? Dominic Purcell as Dracula/Drake was terrible. The fact that Dracula wanted to be called Drake made it harder for me to take Dominic's performance remotely seriously.

The ending of the film was a disappointment. I was hoping that the film would go out with a bang but all it did was go out with a whimper. The dialogue was laughable at times, and half of the performances were unintentionally funny but awful. ""Blade: Trinity"" had its moments but otherwise I was disappointed with the way the film ended for the series.",1127174400,2,2622,4.703703703703703
2245337,2,B0007V6ITE,The third venture into Marvel's Blade movie is something less than the first two offerings.  As an action movie it stands fine on it's own.  Fine meaning that if you like action movies you'll watch it until the end.

There are also new heroes, like Hannibal King, a cool and brave vampire hunter who used to be a vampire himself and now wants to help humanity by killing the suckers(did I mention he swears about 100 times at least?)Abigal Whistler, the daughter of Abraham Whistler who now wants to help her father by killing the undead(she's a hot babe, and get a load of her awesome weapons)and a few others who help the 3 vampire hunters.

2245346,4,B0007V6ITE,"The third and most likely last blade movie, ""Blade Trinity."" This movie adds to new heroes Abigail(Jessica Bieland)and Hannibal(Ryan Reynolds)who are basically Blade's(Wesley Snipes) back up. Jessical Biel does a good job playing the kick butt female Vampire killer, her archery skills are unmatched and she is gifted with many cool gadgets with wich to kill Vampires. Ryan Reynolds does a great job for this being his first real action movie, he bulked up for this one and is armed with many guns and a witty attitude, wich adds the fairly new twist to the Blade movies...Humor. The plot is opened up, with a look at the Vampires ""Final solution"" and the first Vampire is awakened to reign again and lead his people into a new era.

It is a great movie through all it's flaws it has a few badly cast characters a good example is Parker Posey, though in her own right she is really funny and has done some good movies in her time(Best in Show) but i'm not sure if Blade was such a good chocie, but she did add a few more opportunities for Ryan Reynolds to be funny. And then there's Triple ""H,"" not a bad job but not that good either, he did play a good big, dumb, muscle-bond Vampire, and had a good fight scene even throwing in some wrestling moves. All in all this was a great movie with great humor and a great amount of action, worth renting and buying, but maybe not both, but that's all up to you.

And for those of you that like director and cast commentaries, this one has a good one, with the director/writer David S.Goyer and Blade's two new heros Jessical Biel and Ryan Reynolds, good stuff and very insightful, check it out in the Blade-Trinity (Unrated Widescreen Edition).",1124064000,,1687,4.509803921568627
2245347,4,B0007V6ITE,"Although this third film in the series of movies may have been disappointing to some Blade purists who loved the original film, this installment added some interesting twists and additional humor was quite entertaining.

In this story the Nightstalkers resurrect the original Dracula to help them execute their evil plans, and of course Blade is there to stop them, but this time with help from two new vampire fighters played by Jessica Biel and Ryan Reynolds. Blade himself is the same character as in the previous two movies, but Biel and Reynolds, along with the new Nightstalker team, which includes a knuckle-dragger played by pro-wrestler Triple H, make for some humorous dialogue and some good action scenes.

Assuming that this is the last of movies, I recommend this film for the reasons for the reasons mentioned above. It is nowhere near as high impact as Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, but at the same time, it would be an exaggeration to say it was as disappointing as The Matrix: Revolutions.",1123977600,,1019,4.850574712643678
2245348,2,B0007V6ITE,"The third and hopefully last part of this total of 3 part Trilogy starring the main character that never seems to die, Wesley Snipes, as Blade, with the addition of 2 other characters that are similar to him in many ways. Snipes does a surprisingly well acting job throughout the whole trilogy, comparing to his other past actings. His serious, dark, mystifying, and solid stature and personal characteristics not to mention looks gives him the edge he needed to make his way to becoming the Blade that we have come to known and attach to for the past couple of years since the release of the first.

The first Blade movie, was in my opinion, moderately leveled as a decent movie at best, considering that the first was probably the best and the last was definately the worst. Vampires and the methods of killing them are pretty much unchanged even over the courses of the years, decades to centuries. I find the last one to end not with a bang, but rather a diminutive and barely audible *blop*. The action is very much the same, only some added new weapons make the movie new if considered new more likely to term ""variety"". By the way, Triple H should remain as a wrestler at RAW and step far back away from acting by all means. His role, exaggerated by faulty reviews and commercials, is an insult, his acting career probably died the same time his character died in this movie. But again, he's not a trained movie actor. The ending was a complete and utterly disappointing failure to any attempts to bringing it to any visible end. The death of the King of The Vampires(mind my title please) wasn't anything I thought or hoped it would be. In fact, if anyone were to remember back to how the endings were to the last 2, all the so called ""bosses"" died in boring and mediocre ways. I have never been satisfied with any of their endings.

Basically in summary, even though I've just rented this and not buy it or watch it in the theater(thank god) I thought it was a complete failure. A good movie can be rated and reviewed as horrible if the ending isn't good. That is why there's even an ending to things such as Trilogies and series etc. This movie had a decent opening, but failed miserably from there forward. The action was all the same and everything and after the second one being pretty much the same, third one was totally on me and I blame myself for watching it. Mind you, I was warned many times.

The MOVIE: Triple H and some vamps tries to find Dracula, however, thing was, dracula found them. Dracula ""followed"" them back and tried to kill Blade. Blade on the otherside, tries to kill vampires, but ends up killing a human pretending to be a vampire in a way of setting him up for the cops.

As if the movie's plot wasn't bad enough, they had to throw in Ryan Reynalds and his comic-relief idiocy. Its a vampire flick (albeit a terrible one) not a night at the improv. Although if it had been labeled as a comedy I might have enjoyed it more. (Not!) Thank God I only borrowed it.

2245351,5,B0007V6ITE,"If the rumors are true and in fact ""Blade: Trinity"" is the final edition of the Blade saga, Wesley Snipes and company could not have sent him off better than this third installment which in all aspects that matter is the biggest, baddest and best Blade yet.

In this outing, Blade (Snipes) the half-human/half-vampire is continuing his war against the vampires and their human helpers, the familiars, who do their bidding during the day. While on a routine mission, Blade gets suckered into killing a human that brings the FBI knocking on his door.

Director/Writer David S. Goyer shows his skills here by staging a hectic action scene where Blade and his lone ally, Whistler (Kris Kristofferson, ""Blade 2"") attempt to stave off a warehouse full of agents resulting in tons of explosions and some great hand to hand fighting.

With Blade occupied, a group of well-off vampires (is there any other kind?) led by Parker Posey (""Frankenstein"") and WWE wrestler Triple H, making his film debut, try to convince the king of vampires, Dracula (Dominic Purcell, FOX's ""John Doe"") himself to kill Blade off.

Fortunately, Blade gets a little backup himself with the appearance of the Nightstalkers led by Whistler's daughter (the incredible sexy Jessica Biel, ""Stealth"") and Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds, ""The In-Laws"") and its time for one more showdown at the Vampire Corral.

Having starred in two Blade sequels, there's little doubt that Snipes ""gets"" what makes Blade such an appealing character - his take no vampire prisoner attitude, his status as the James Bond of vampire hunters with ever inventive new gadgets to kill his foes and of course tons of attitude.

It'd be hard to imagine any other actor filling Snipes' shoes, as he for all intent becomes Blade and not an actor playing a comic book character. It must be said that Snipes and the ""Blade"" series has had just as much impact on the resurgence of comic book films as the ""X-Men"" and ""Spider-Man"" franchises.

Goyer, himself no stranger to comic books as he is an acclaimed comic scribe, also knows a thing or two about what works for Blade - finding the right balance of fly by the seat of your pants action, a little gore and humor.

The latter is largely provided by Reynolds' King. Reynolds has a knack for making any movie he's in a lot more enjoyable and he makes a great foil to the intense Snipes and prevents the movie from ever becoming too serious. His reaction to a vampire dog is worth the price of admission alone.

The other standout in the movie is Biel who at onetime employed the tactic of posing in the raw for the mens magazine GEAR in order to get out of the contract for her sugary sweet television series ""7th Heaven."" Her following film career has been quite unremarkable with parts in the baseball comedy ""Summer Catch,"" the horror remake ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and a supporting role in ""Cellular."" Here though Biel gets to show how great she is in action (who knew) showing promise of what was to come in this years ""Stealth.""

Her archery weapon of choice evokes memories of the crossbow wielding Carole Bouquet from the 1981 James Bond movie ""For Your Eyes Only"" and the same lithe sexiness that encompassed that character is also present here in the attractive shape of Biel.

While each Blade installment has had a different director, the trilogy has had an admirable consistency to it that doesn't stray from the successful original formula so you know exactly what you're going to get.

""Trinity"" has a loud, thumping soundtrack that would be perfect in a club yet oddly works well watching vampires getting kicked around before burning into flames. Snipes' Blade is the coolest man on Earth and there's going to be at least a half dozen ""I can't believe he killed them like that moments.""

Unlike ""Blade 2"" where Director Guillermo Del Toro utilized a heavy dose of CGI in the battle scenes, Goyer employs a more back to basics approach that allows the viewer to actually see all the action transpiring instead of clipping the footage to resemble an MTV video.

The only real area in which ""Trinity"" is weak is the quality of opposition for Blade and the gang. Besides a great sequence between Posey and Reynolds, the bad guys just don't ever feel like that serious a threat.

Blade battling the icon of vampires, Dracula, should mean a much bigger epic fight than we've seen before in the series but whether its Purcell not having enough screen presence or the creators wanted to stick with the familiar, the anticipated clash is a bit of a letdown.

Biel and Reynolds seem to be groomed for a Nightstalkers spin-off and their characters were enjoyable enough in a supporting role that following their next adventure should prove just as entertaining and if this is the sendoff for Blade, he's had a great trilogy for his legacy.",1123459200,2,4833,4.770059880239521

If you are a fan of the incredible Ryan Reynolds, he is his usual funny self, but has woefully too little screen time. As for the rest of the cast; Wesley Snipes rarely utters a word, Parker Posey does her usual scheming bitch, and Kris Kristofferson returns again.

This sequel has fallen so far from the first 2 movies, that it could be a way of distinguishing friend from foe. Simply ask anyone who liked ""Blade 3"" to cross an imaginary line in front of them; if people get in your face, it's time to run with a new crowd.

There is no rhyme and reason to the madness that is going on half the time! The timing is terrible, direction is awful; I've seen fight sequences between kids in 5th grade that were put together much better. Blade has no clear motivation in the actions he makes; (WARNING SPOILER AHEAD) Whistler dies a most unoriginal death fit only for secondary characters in this mess.

None of the characters are particularly notable, including Blade himself; he seems to have been turned into a 2-bit punk with nobody to care about except his own hide. What the hell happened to the spirituality that was emphasized in Blade 2? All of a sudden, he's just another street punk, albeit with supernatural powers. The character that Ryan Reynolds plays appears to have been written with Seann William Scott (American Pie) in mind as there are a lot of failed attempts at making him the ""smart ass"" of the bunch.

A bunch of new characters are clearly introduced just to be killed off later on, essentially insulting the audience's intelligence. There's a blind scientist & daughter who I couldn't care less about. The only thing I felt, as they were getting killed, was comfort in the knowledge that this lame vehicle would be over soon enough.

The extended version offers a slightly different ending which is about as satisfying as the original ending, and that's not meant as a compliment at all. The end exists merely for functional reasons. Filmmakers: ""It's the end folks, get up and leave the theater so the next group of suckers can come in! DO IT BEFORE WE BRONG OUT THE MACE!! Aww, forget it, just bring in the attack dogs, these folks just won't get moving until blood is shed...""

Bottom line: Not only is the movie disappointing as a stand-alone feature, but as the end of a movie trilogy, it's a shame that the end could be so cruel to avid Blade fans. The commentary by director David S. Goyer, Ryan Reynolds and Jessica Biel is laughable so don't even bother watching it. Good choice casting Parker Posey as a vampire though; she isn't aging well at all.",1122249600,3,2537,4.577092511013216
2245356,3,B0007V6ITE,"Plenty of mayhem, martial arts, and music....but with all the traditional cliches: The vampires attempt to fight hand-to-hand against heavily armed heroes who easily and casually blow them away. Even a half-blind couch potato like myself could probably kill these pansy vampires with a rusty flyswatter and a BB gun. Do all vampires have a ""death wish? Is it illegal for vampires to buy or carry weapons in Hollywood? JUST ONCE I would like to see a gang of vampires or zombies, or any other cannon-fodder monsters, NOT simply stagger slowly toward the heavily armed and invincible hero, getting themselves blown to hell, but instead attack their opponents with tactics, powers, and weapons that make the outcome not so one-sided.

Another major complaint: why do the villains in virtually every movie ALWAYS miss when they have a clear shot at the unsuspecting hero? The bullets usually ricochet off a nearby wall, warning the hero, who then shoots left-handed, between his or her legs, and hits the wretched villain, zombie, vampire directly between the eyes. It is tiresome and predictable...are there no villains who know how to operate firearms effectively?

Almost as tiresome were Ryan Reynolds' incessant wise cracks throughout the movie. I found myself rooting for the huge, nasty vampire with titanium teeth (Triple H) to stomp Ryan's larynx and put an end to his assenine chatter. On the plus side, casting Parker Posey as the villainess was truly inspired...despite the fact that she never quite got used to the phony teeth and walking in high heeled shoes...she was fun to watch.

Also enjoyable was seeing Kris Kristofferson, wretched and unkempt, delivering lines in his usual flat, mono-baritone, looking like a walking rag pile, improvising dialog and in dire need of flea shampoo.

But don't get the wrong impression...there was still a lot to like about this movie, particularly if you are a fan of Blade and Punisher-style flicks. The subway station scene between mega-fox Jessica Biel and some skateboard slimeballs is worth the price of the DVD, and Wesley Snipes is his usual laconic, brutal, efficient self.

The story line seemed sound enough and the characters were good. Except Ryan...I can't seem to picture him as anything but Van Wilder. His character was exceedingly annoying...it actually took away in many parts of the movie. Playing the tough smart butt...then turning sissy when Drake stabs him.

Blade seemed to have lost his privates before this movie. I loved the tough and arrogant-but-silent character he played in the first two movies. In this one, the only tough person seemed to be Abigal.

He loves his car...it gets trashed and he's not upset?

Whistler gets killed and he didn't put up much of a fight.

Maybe this movie should have been rewritten to make it a prequel to Blade 1.

They introduced many new fresh ideas to the movie. I thought the ""Blood Farm"" was very unique. The idea of making Vamp animals was cool. The new weapons were great...especially Blade's knife wire. The car chase was new for a Blade movie.

The music....ummmm... When did Blade become a movie about (no disrespect) being in the hood and gangsta rap?? The music was as slow as the action. Two or three of the songs were good. The angry-rapper music genre has overstayed it's welcome. It went out shortly after NWA's Compton.

I thought Jessica Biel had great potential for this movie. Her last fight started with a Neo move....then she threw a book at the baddie. A book!!!

Wesley was a little underpar for an action flick.

Ryan Reynolds was just annoying.

Parker was pretty cool for her part.

Dominic needed to be more threatening and less of a horror-movie-wannabe.

It turns out though that the FBI is in cahoots with the vampires, who happened to resurrect Dracula, but hey, call him Drake. The film if full of action from start to finish, but at times, it still seemed like the movie ran a little slow. Overall, it was an okay flick. The best part of the movie is on the opening screen, where they play audio on the select an option video loop only once. After that, it remains silent.

There is both the theatrical version and the extended uncut edition of the movie on this disc. I only watched the uncut version. I feel that if that version is released, then it is what the director truly wanted to be shown on the big screen. However, to prevent an NC-17 rating upon the release in the theatres, they had to cut the flick down a bit. The true form of Dracula is actually a little bit cheesy, but they have a pretty boy in as the human incarnation of Drake.

As for personal performances, Ryan Reynolds as Hannibal King delivers a pretty good comic performance, as would be expected from him, considering his prior roles in Van Wilder and the TV series ""Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place."" Jessica Biel has come a long way since her start on the TV show 7th Heaven, setting herself up firmly for a future in the action and horror genre of movies. Wesley Snipes continues the role he played in Blade and Blade II. I can't honestly comment on him much, because the only movies I've ever seen with him in it are Blade and Blade II, despite the fact that he's been in 42 other works.

As for special features, which I have been watching actually as I write this, the outtakes were pretty funny, and the alternate ending would have set up for a spinoff of the Blade Series, following Abigail and Hannibal, now no longer vampire hunters, but werewolf hunters. The documentary is pretty informative, and actually, to me I think it's better than the movie actually was. They cover everything from training to do the action, including fighting styles, special effects, a look at the writer/director, and other cool things.

My favorite quote from a professional's review of this movie came from Robert K. Elder:

""It seems that Dracula (Dominic Purcell) was napping in a crypt in Iraq, making him the only weapon of mass destruction found there to date."" I find this funny because what is actually plotted to kill the vampires is a WMD - a biological agent.",1120608000,,2696,4.516393442622951
2245361,2,B0007V6ITE,"This was a painfull movie to watch!  The Blade franchise runs its course with this thrid release and shows its a total mess.  Wesley Snipes looks like he just wants this film to end with his performance.  He seems almost boored!  The storyline is weak and the dialogue is ugly to listen.  The choreographed action scenes are fair.  The biggest mistake was killing off the character played by Kris Kristofferson in order to bring in a younger audience.  In the last 2 movies, he gave the movie class.  The producers should have known that if it ain't broke, don't fix it.",1120521600,3,570,4.574257425742574
2245362,3,B0007V6ITE,"Okay, this is specifically about the unrated DVD version of the film.  I'd written a much longer review earlier, but my computer crashed and I lost all that effort, so I'm just going to simplify here.

I just thought anyone interested in purchasing the unrated version should be warned that the ending has been changed.  I was going along, cheerfully watching the movie, and then I was unexpectedly smacked in the face with a new (and really stupid) ending that wasn't in the theatrical release.  I guess the writer/director, David Goyer, was getting drunk with his new power and decided to subject the people, who paid good money to buy the DVD, to a bad ending (full of loose ends) that rightfully didn't make it into the theatrical release.  Ptui!  So don't be surprised.

Luckily, the unrated DVD also contains the R-rated version.  So I suggest watching the unrated version until the final scene and then quickly flipping to the R-rated version for the good ending.

Other than that, I liked the unrated version better.  The action scenes seemed less choppy for one thing.  Although, there was some footage of the final battle between Blade and Drake that seemed to be recycled (used more than once) which was kind of cheesy.

The DVD promises an alternate ending in the bonus features, and there actually is one there, sort of an epilogue (""6 months later"") kind of thing.  If Goyer wanted to do something different, he should have tacked that epilogue onto the end and shoved the other ending into the bonus features section where nobody would have to see it, I think.

Anyway, I'm starting to ramble again, so I'll shut up.  But watch out for that ending.  I warned ya!",1120435200,3,1677,4.711340206185567

Nothing new, imaginative or inventive to offer...",1120262400,,302,4.6415094339622645
2245384,2,B0007V6ITE,"Blade Trinity is the 3rd installment into the Blade series and also the worst out of all of them. I'm going to use movie example to illustrate this point meaning

MAJOR SPOILERS.

Those of you who don't want the movie ruined should stop reading right now.

The basic storyline/summary of the movie is as follows. The vampires realizing they have become weakened by centuries of diluting their blood with humans as well as random genetic mutations have decided they need to find the first vampire, Dracula or Drake as he's called. By finding Drake they will use his blood to transform all vampires into ""Day Walkers"" and lock humans up in Matrix-esk harvesting facilities where they are put into drug induced comas and kept alive to produce vast quantities of blood.

The good guys Blade and Whistler are doing the usual. Whistler makes weapons Blade kills stuff. Finally Blade is caught on camera killing a human who he thought at the time was a vampire. The police storm the bat cave, kill Whistler and take Blade prisoner. At police HQ Blade is rescued by 2 vampire slayers Hannibal King and Abigail Whistler. He's taken to their own personal hideout and told that they too have an end game for the vampires. A virus called ""Day Star.""

Blade Trinity follows pretty much the path of the original Blade movie.

Step 1: Start movie with generic action scene.

Step 2: Meet main villain in day light for a heart to heart chat.

Step 3: Develop new biological weapon for killing vampires

Step 4: Have main hideout stormed by vampire(s) and friends slaughtered to give a weak sense of loss.

Step 5: Attack badguy stronghold, fight random guards and vamps, fight main boss, get ass kicked, and finally defeat boss with new vamp bio weapon.

The film just tried to spew ""coolness"" as much as possible. The name of the vamp hunter group, ""Night Stalkers."" The blind scientist who created the virus. ""Oh she's blind, wow it's different and edgy."" Abigail creating her own ""slay tracks"" on her iPod.. =P Nothing says cool like removing your sense of hearing when in a battle.
But it's fine, she's got second sight, or esp or some crap cause she's still alive right?

I felt a sense of the whole thing being thrown together at the last minute and because of this it's riddled with inconsistencies.

Like the fact that Drake bites and feeds on A TON of people yet NONE of them turn.

In the end scene when the virus is killing everyone, sunlight pours in to ash all the bodies. I'm a vampire, I hate sunlight...Why would I live in a building that has big freakin windows and no automatic shutters or anything?!

Hannibal King used to be a vampire until he was rescued by the Nightstalkers.
Now he's human and the thought of being a vamp again disgusts him. As a vampire you've got long life, speed, strength, and agility in exchange for weaknesses of sunlight, silver, and garlic. Why would anyone, having tasted that power not feel a sense of loss at what they used to be.

Though with how easily the vampires are dispatched by ordinary humans I guess it's not such a hot lifestyle after all.

If someone is by nature given a speed and strength advantage I could see it possible  for a ""highly trained"" human to take on 1 or2 competently  not 3 to 5.

This problem has existed in all of the Blade movies and I've always wondered it..
Why are all vampires @ssholes?

Another interesting fact. In the first Blade, Blade was able to realize the poor guy being attacked in the night club was a human. Amidst loud techno music and strobs
he can tell this dude is a friendly. Yet on an empty street with big bright street lamps, he shoots a stake into the back of a human without blinking. Blade is at least half vampire..I mean come on he should be able to tell how they move or carry themselves or even smell which is a vamp and which is a human.

This movie was in a word stupid.. Other word combinations that come to mind are ""A waste of time"" ""Pathetic"" and my personal favorite ""F*cking retarded""

The first was fine and following in the footsteps of the Matrix, the creators of Blade managed to make the 2nd mediocre and 3rd just downright terrible. Jessica Biel is here only for her sex appeal as she can't act, and Ryan Reynolds (who is usally halfway funny and witty in movies like Van Wilder and Harold and Kumar) is happered by bad diaolgue and comes of as being silly and annoying. Even the fangs on Danica (Parker) seem to be cheap vending machine toys. It looks like she's chew on a big chunk of meat through the entire movie.

This was nothing but the directors and producers trying their hardest to squeeze every last drop of cash generating life out of a series that was obviously done when the 2nd flick came out. This movie is barely worth renting and only if you can get it for 99 cents or less. DO NOT BUY!",1119830400,2,4815,4.501722158438576
2245385,2,B0007V6ITE,"I really enjoyed the original Blade movie. Blade 2 was okay. But Blade 3 was a total letdown. You can read all the other detailed reviews to see what the plot is all about. They tried to put some humor into this movie but I thought it was annoying. At one point, the original vampire (Dracula) dangles a baby over the edge of a building so that Blade won't attack/fight him. Don't forget, we are talking about the original all powerful original vampire and he's afraid to fight Blade? How lame can you get? (If you remember well, there was a similar situation in the first Blade movie where a girl was held hostage by one of the vampires. How original!) Only extreme Blade fans should buy this movie.",1119571200,,700,4.434108527131783
2245386,2,B0007V6ITE,"Started off OK,...then Ryan Reynolds started talking.

A pathetically transparent attempt to spin off a degraphically mine-able teen franchise from what was shaping up into an enjoyable movie series.  This almost seems to be an emerging strategy for the marvel comics franchises.  Knee-cap the 3rd movie so you won't have to pony up big cash to keep the leads around, but still try for the hail mary pass to the teen market (just in case).

The Dracula premise worked, much to my surpise.  As did the set up of Blade as a murderer in the early part of the movie.  Then the JV team shows up, and everything just goes limp.

It wastes every opportunity that it had for some great moments.  How do they put Parker Posey in a vampire movie and not make her an uber-ice-queen villain that you can root for.  They get a subculture comic genius like Patton Oswalt, and here's how they use him: ""Hi everybody, I'm Patton Oswalt, and I'll be playing the new tech expert...  Oops, now I'm dead.""

And it can't even stay in its own sandbox.  Are vampires stronger than humans or not?  In this movie it depends solely on what ever plot hole, or lull, needs to be papered over for the next 30 seconds.  (I'm pretty sure even I could take a kick to the face from Jessica B. without getting knocked down.)  And Ryan Reynolds?  Who told this guy he's funny?  Cliche's from other scripts delivered by an annoying frat boy channeling a recently wakened, and freshly tasered Chevy Chase.  I saw more emotion in the eyes of the robot shark in Jaws.

Poor Wesley Snipes.  He made the first movie work, setting the stage for the resurgence in comic movies in general, and Marvel characters for sure.  He saved the 2nd movie from its own inconsistencies and made it at least watchable.  But even he can't overcome this teeny-bopper camp-crapper floatey-fest.

Wesley and the rest of us deserve much better.",1119225600,2,1883,4.588588588588588
2245387,5,B0007V6ITE,"I will be the first to admit that I harbor a secret fetish for the Blade series.  Ever since I watched the first film back in 1998, I have thought that nobody could have created a better character than Wesley Snipes as Blade.  His dark, brooding voice and personality seemed to fit so well into a role that was half terror, half heroine.  It was a lethal combination that I thought worked perfectly.  As the sequel arrived, I was still an enormous fan, but a bit skeptical about where Blade could go, I was impressed by the direction provided by Guillermo del Toro and as always, the acting of Ron Pearlman, so I was still hooked.  This final chapter (maybe) brought us right back to the roots.  A dark, brooding Blade has now been matched with some hotshot kids that prove that the battle against the vampires is getting to be too much for just one person.  So, like so many other sequels, we add in some comic relief and new characters ... I was worried, because Hollywood doesn't have a green thumb when it comes to this overused device, but to my surprise, it worked perfectly.  New characters gave new blood to this series and provided two hours of sheer enjoyment.  It felt as if I was watching the original all over again.

The excitement, the chaos, the thrill of the hunt were all present, and while the villain wasn't that menacing, it was fun to see Parker Posey place her high heels into a role that just seemed to fit.  The characters and the actors that took control of their roles is what made this film the most enjoyable.  I will stand next to my thought that Ryan Reynolds is the next Chevy Chase, and proved in this film that he can tackle both humor and action in the same stroke.  He was phenomenal in this film, nearly stealing every scene away from Snipes.  His blend of raw powerful humor and deadpan eyes seemed to fit perfectly into this world.  He was a very convincing hero.  The same can be said for Jennifer Biel, who could have used more screen time, but was still very exciting as Abigail Whistler.  She seemed to provide that emotional depth to the Nightstalkers that was desperately needed.  Then there were the Mighty Wind moments that I was not expecting, but was utterly surprised when it happened.  Director David S. Goyer talked in the supplemental features about how he was watching A Mighty Wind before filming this and how he wanted to see how many of the cast of that film he could get into a vampire film.  I am glad, because it blended expert comedy into this comic world perfectly.  While Snipes kept his character traits from all three, it was nice to see a different blend of characters into this film, reviving this series from what could have been a trilogy nightmare.

I think that David S. Goyer did a great job by deciding to helm this project.  He provided the right amount of humor, darkness, and horror that originally created this series.  He kept the tone light, while feeding the idea that perhaps Blade isn't the heroine after all, but instead this cursed creature forced to walk alone in the world.  I liked the idea of Blade trying to find some friends, and fighting along side of someone else.  It was impressive to see a more human side to this half-vampire that we did not see in the first two films.  I could see where Goyer was trying to show Blade evolving, and I can only applaud Goyer for trying this.  Sure, there were elements that just didn't work at all in this movie, which may disgust some faithful viewers, but for me the good (humor, characters, and story) outweighed the poor. Dominic Purcell was not that convincing as a villain, while his true image looked more like a Predator instead a vampire.  There could have been more used with the rest of the Nightstalkers than just creating weapons and shooting hoops, but again, Goyer took these weak moments and added enough classic moments that you could easily forget the bad.

Overall, I was extremely impressed with this film.  Ryan Reynolds stole the show, proving that he can handle even the smallest of roles no matter what the genre.  I am hoping that the whispers of a possible Nightstalker spin-off is definitely in the works because I could thoroughly enjoy what both Reynolds and Biel created in this film.  Their chemistry and intensity really pulled this film together.  Also, check out the special features to this film.  I am not normally one to watch them, but for some strange reason I was pulled in this time and really enjoyed it.  There is an alternate ending, which just had me laughing and thinking of how big this comic world really could be.  Blade: Trinity was a decent story coupled with some amazing acting that pulled this series away from a possible fatal death.

2245393,2,B0007V6ITE,"Blade Trinity (David S. Goyer, 2004)

Every time I write the title of this movie, I put a colon between the two words, and then have to go take it out again. Where was the proofreader who should have told the scriptwriter that it really, really needs a colon?

Trinity got itself some short shrift, and to be fair, the critics had a whole lot of valid points. It doesn't have a plot; it has a hole. However, what it does have is some characters worth the name. While it's certainly not up to the standard set by the first film (and I grow, daily, in my despair that there will be another Blade film worthy of the first one), at least a few of the characters in Trinity are a little more fleshed out than the cardboard cutouts that populated the horrible second film in the series.

Perhaps the most interesting thing about Blade Trinity is that Blade himself really doesn't have much to do with the movie. He spits out a few one-liners now and again, and of course he has to be around for the big fight at the end. But Trinity is not so much about Blade as it is about Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds of Two Guys, a Girl, and a Pizza Place). King leads a group of vampire hunters who spring Blade from police custody after he's arrested for murdering a human. From this moment, King becomes the movie's focal point, stealing every scene he's in. Ryan Reynolds has an impeccable sense of comic timing, and it's a testament to Goyer's usually subpar writing skills that King comes out the other end of this movie without seeming as if there were any inconsistencies in his character at all.

Where Reynolds makes the film, and St. Wesley tends to have more of an ""I'm gracing it with my presence"" attitude, there's really not much else here. A few good actors are wasted in very small roles (James Remar, Natasha Lyonne, Callum Keith Rennie, and Eric Bogosian are just a few you'll recognize), and a few usually decent actors turn in terrible, terrible performances. Parker Posey is simply awful. (The way she says ""Oh, Blade."" about five minutes into the movie makes me wonder why the editor didn't insist that scene, which is utterly useless, be left on the cutting room floor.) Jessica Biel does little more than walk around looking good. Kris Kristofferson comes off wooden and unconvincing. Dominic Purcell attempts, at the very end of the film, to try and inject some semblance of depth into his character, but by then it's too late. About the only person other than Reynolds worth watching in the film is Paul Levesque, better known to wrestling fans as Triple H, who provides a great foil for Reynolds.

And yet still, with everything bad about it, Blade Trinity (I just noticed, by the way, that even IMDB made the colon mistake) has so much more going for it than the horrible mess that was the previous film in the series that I have to at least give it an ""average."" Don't be expecting great cinema. For that matter, don't be expecting the first movie. But Reynolds saves it from being a complete mess.",1118102400,,3009,4.513761467889908

The Nightstalker group is a team of vampire hunters that doesn't resemble Buffy, and you'll be refreshed at the presentation of Dracula (I know he's been done often).

2245417,2,B0007V6ITE,"That should have been the title of this movie.  Goyer spent so much time trying to be funny to the point where he forgot he was making a mockery out of the Blade series.  The story starts out with a bunch of Vampires uncovering the Lord of Vampires in some underground Tomb.  It started out well enough but it was quickly turning into a very long music video complete with long slow mo walking towards the camera for no reason at all shots and more slow mo turns during a fight.  I swear Goyer needs to lay off the slow mo button.  Then we have Blade encountering Ms Biels who is nothing more than a woman who can kick ass and nothing more, she has no depth and just another side character you don't really care about.  In addition to Biels another person Blade encounters is the comic relief guy of the film he's suppose to make you laugh but he only succeed in making your head hurt.  I swear this guy must have kept a book of lame one liners and was gonna make sure every single last one of them make it on screen.

Now we have the Lord of vampires who at first was a big ugly scary monster but Goyer decided not to ruin his video and instead made him turn into a swarmy Eurotrash hunk who spends most of his days walking around town in greasy Eurotrash attire complete with gold chains and unbuttoned shirt...did I forget to mention that he's walking in slow motion?  Well he is, alot.  So Blade kills Vampires with depthless Biels and comic relief guy until they come across The Lord of Vampires.  Who turn tail and run and run and run while Blade chase and chase and chase, yep folks the Lord of Vampires sees Blade and high tails it home, seriously.  When Blade encounters the ""Dracula"" Vampire Lord  they have a *very short* sword fight.

Overall Blade Trinity doesn't come close to the first two Blade movies.  The two main vampires in Blade I and II gave him far more of a challenge then this Dracula wannabe ever did.  It feels as if this one was thrown together, there is no plot and the fight scenes concentrated more on Biels than Snipes.  Watch it only to see the hopefully final Blade movie but that's it.

Its incredibly boring and the introduction of several new characters completely ruined the pace of the flick.  The 1st two Blades were excellent.  I was incredibly disappointed in this disaster.  The lame attempt at humor in this movie is laughable in itself.  The jokes suck and the delivery is inappropriate.  I couldn't wait for this mess to end.  The directors and producers should be prosecuted for ruining a franchise that was built on two excellent prequels.  This is by far one of the worst sequels I have ever seen.  Some of these reviewers must be on the payroll of New Line Cinema or a family member of the director.  Dont buy this junk.

2245440,4,B0007V6ITE,"I was told that the Blade character was hardly in this movie.  Critics said that this movie was a 90 minute iPod commercial.  I read that the action sequences were the worst ever put to film.

What movie were these people watching?  I saw this movie the other night, and it was fun.  Is it an Oscar contender?  Of course not.  But it was a great popcorn movie, which is what a Blade movie is supposed to be.

Even things in this film that I thought would bother me didn't.  I'm a pretty big Dracula fan, and I own every Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing Hammer film in existence.  It really annoys me when movies have to mess with the Dracula character, which was (very) loosely based on a historical figure.  Nothing annoyed me more than ""Dracula 2000"" where, if I remember it properly, they claimed that Dracula was actually Jesus' disciple Judas.  Blade III does mess with the Dracula mythology a little, but they did it in a way that didn't really annoy me.  I even liked that they called him ""Drake"", because that gave him distance from the Bram Stoker stories.

What worked?  Well, it was fun.  Lots of gadgets and lots of vampire hunting.  Jessica Beil, surprisingly, kicked some butt.  I didn't even mind the iPod thing.  It wasn't nearly as pervasive as Baby Ruths in ""Stargate"" or Nokia in ""Hitchhiker's Guide"".

So, what went wrong?  Well, not too much.  These are just nit-picks.  Ryan Reynolds was pretty good as Hannibal King, but his one liners fell a little flat.  Maybe they wouldn't have, if the director didn't leave so much room after every one of his lines.  I guess the director assumed that the audience would be laughing so much, that they would need time to catch their breath.  This actually had the effect of making his performance less amusing.

Another problem was with the amazing actress, Parker Posey, who is fantastic in ""Waiting for Guffamn"" and ""Best in Show"".  She was given a huge pair of teeth that she could not get her lines out through.  She is a phenomenal actress, but all of her lines came out sounding like Cindy on the Brady Bunch.  ""Oh, that Bade maketh me tho mad!""

My only other problems was with the ""big mouths"" on the dogs and Drake.  Ever since Predator and advances in CG, film makers feel compelled to put these no-jaw-boned two-mouthed monsters in every film.  Then, they even give them another mouth on the end of their tongue.  It's really not scary.  In fact, I think Drake would have been scarier if they hadn't done the double/triple mouth thing in the first place.

The action wasn't all that bad.  It wasn't as good as Crouching Tiger or Kill Bill or anything, but it wasn't as bad as something like ""Mortal Kombat: Annihilation"".  As a general rule, hand to hand fights should always be in real time, well lit, and shot wide.  Close-ups are confusing, and slow motion is boring (unless it's John Woo).  Blade III stuck to a successful fight formula, for the most part.

I really can't talk down too much about this film.  I got what I wanted out of it.  Wesley Snipes, Vampires, vampire killing gadgets, and fighting.  Oh, and thanks to New Line for releasing the Uncut DVD right away, and not making us spend our money twice on the same movie.",1115769600,2,3209,4.534965034965035
2245441,5,B0007V6ITE,"Blade - Trinity manages to continue on the success of the first two Blade movies.  I am NOT a comic book fan, though I did like The Flash comics as a child.  But one doesn't have to be a comic book geek to get into the Blade movies.  All three movies stand on their own, quite well I might add.  While I found the ""F"" word a little (okay, a lot) overused, most of the film is really, really good!

I don't want to get into the details of the plot, as I do not like posting reviews full of movie spoilers.  What I will tell you is that Ryan Reynolds and Wesley Snipes make the ultimate non-buddy-vampire-killer-duo.  These two actors turned out some great scenes in this third installment.  Reynolds' one-liners and sarcastic banter made the film a pleasure to watch.

Dominic Purcell is very convincing in his role as DRACULA!  Yeah, you heard me, Dracula.

Jessica Biel as Abigail Whistler proves she is more than just a pretty face, though I think she could have been a little ""darker"" with her character.  She almost seemed nicer than her character on 7th Heaven.  But she was convincing as a fighter, unless that was all a stunt double????

Parker Posey is an excellent villain, playing Danica Talos.  Her character was awesome, and she played it to perfection.

In fact, all of the actors and actresses managed to turn in great performances.

Blade - Trinity is an action-packed thrill ride that you don't want to miss.  The entire series is worth the cost.  All three Blade installments deliver what action-thrillers should.

The thing with Blade that drew me in so well, was it was a very well put together action movie, but it also had a not too bad story-line. Granted, it's not Good Will Hunting story calliber, but it's ok none the less. I'll have to say this 3rd attempt was a lot better than the 2nd Blade. I did find our evil lord Dracula was dressed somewhat silly though. He looked like an out of time rocker ... lol. Jessica Beil was very cool.

This movie has added a lot of comic situations and one-liners to keep your interest as the basic fight scenes that you would expect in a ""vampire"" movie are not enough to make this a great movie, but the path has been set to let Blade go away and set the scene for more movies of this nature with ""Daywalkers"".

2245455,3,B0007V6ITE,"The third entry in Wesley Snipes' 'Blade' series is the weakest one, lacking the freshness of the first, and the distinct touch of the second.  Still, David S. Goyer (originally a script writer for many action films inclucing the previous two 'Blades') made a decent if not exceptional actioner in which the supporting ladies are much better than Wesley Snipes' vampire slayer.

Let's face it.  The story is poorly done.  Wesley Snipes' hero Blade is caught and arrested for unwisely killing a human, not a vampire.  Actually, it's a trap by some vampires waging war against human beings.  Before you say 'Not again,' here's a catch for the new film -- this time, the mastermind of the blood-sucking familiars turns out Count Dracula, who awakens from his long sleep from the tomb in the Middle East.  Should we take this seriously?

Frankly, the charisma of Wesley Snipes you found in the first two 'Blade' films is missing from the third one.  He poses and delivers his lines the same way as he did in the past, but his character looks awfully flat compared with the previous ones, and equally charisma-free Count Dracula hardly looks like a menace to the humans.  Also, Natasha Lyonne is criminally wasted, and though Kris Kristofferson re-appears as the Blade's mentor, his scenes are too brief to give the precious touch of humanity to the screen.  Ryan Reynold's character is effective as comic relief, but perhaps he could be better with a more coherent script.

In fact, two female characters outshines the male ones.  They are Jessica Biel, (seen in the remake of 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre') as Abigail, vampire-killer and expert archer who assists Snipe's Blade, and Parker Posey as Danica Talos, a bit campy vampire who is after the life of The Blade.  Jessica Biel adds freshness to the film, and her swift movements prove that she can do action movies pretty well.  And don't be surprised to find Parker Posey (seen also in 'Scream 3' by the way), who clearly understands what she should do in this kind of film.  Her white-washed make-up tells us that we are watching a film based on Marvel comics, and it's a real fun to watch her character.

Therefore, my three stars are given to two ladies who should be the main characters of the film, and good martial arts action scenes which are better than I expected.  But there is a clear sign telling us that they should end the franchise now when you see 'vampire poochs' attacking a human.  It's only embarrassing.",1115424000,,2478,4.76112412177986
2245456,3,B0007V6ITE,"One thing has been dominant in the trilogy of BLADE movies:  incredibly choreographed fight scenes.  They exist in this latest entry, but by now they've become parodies of themselves.  Sure, seeing the vampires burst into flame and ashes was neat..for a while..but by now, they too are so casually executed, there's little impact.  As for the music, well, suffice to say I prefer a real movie score and not all this rap/hip hop stuff crammed in to sell soundtracks.  Wesley Snipes is effective as always but I wish he would show his human side a little more often; he seems so impervious to that side.  Dominic Purcell as the buffed up Dracula (Drake) is smarmy but not all that threatening and the climactic battle is far below par.  Ryan Reynolds and Jessica Biel as the Night Stalkers added some humor and depth, but they ended up also being too cartoonish.  And for all of Reynolds' buffed up torso, he still came across rather wimpy.  Kris Kristofferson doesn't get much screen time in this one, and he seems kind of bored.  Parker Posey hams it up but her character is so unlikeable, one can't wait until she gets hers.  BLADE TRINITY is full of the eyepopping camera wizardy we've come to expect from the series, but it's storyline is merely a reworking of the first two movies and although it should be the last in the series, the ending does smell of a possible sequel.

The moves-off the hook no question, he has some serious skills, attitude-he has it without question as well.  He's believable and at times funny in the movie (to me).  I enjoyed all the action, violence and everything else that the movie offered.

I enjoyed Parker Posey, Jessica Biel and Ryan Reynolds in the movie.  Each of their characters brought a little something different to the movie that kept me interested.  Of course what would the movie be without some bad *** weaponry there is nice variety of swords, guns, arrows, knives and various other tools of death.

I also enjoyed some of the extras that DVD had to offer.  Others i didn't care for so much.  But this being the last Blade movie, i must say it went out on a very high note in my department and was totally worth the money that i paid for it.",1115337600,,1093,4.378109452736318

That looked way too ridiculous. Of course, there was nothing wrong with Wesley Snipes' performance, even though the movie was sickening he did a great job, as well as Jessica Beal (did I just say that???). The extras are alright and if you're a hardcore Blade fan, buy it, if not, you won't like this film, Goyer needs to leave the directing to the professionals.",1115251200,3,810,4.554794520547945

""Blade-Trinity"" introduces characters to help Blade. Abigail Whistler, (Jessica Biel) the daughter of Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) and Hannibal King (Ryan ""Buffed up"" Reynolds) lead the Nightstalkers. The Nightstalkers are a group of ragtag vampire killers that saves Blade from a group of familiars lead by Danica Talos (Parker Posey). The Nightstalkers are working on a virus that kills vampires, but needs the blood from the original vampire.

Danica Talos summons the original Dracula (Dominic Purcell) from her strain of vampires to kill Blade. The showdown is set. ""Have you tasted my sword?"" Blade said.

The weapons and killing of vampires is the focus of the Blade series. The incineration of vampires into ash is still the most awesome special effect of the Blade series. Silver bullets, silver blades and now Abigail's silver arrows dominate the vampires too easy. I think Dracula should have been portrayed more as an indestructible force. The ""Til Dusk to Dawn"" vampires were more badass and harder to kill.

Jessica Biel and Parker Posey are bonus snickeys and easy on the eyes. Ryan Reynolds brings some humor to the supposed dark Marvel Comic series. Add this to your previous ""Blade"" DVDs. Actor followers can add to their collection too!",1115164800,,1474,5.004081632653061

Next, there are the fighting scenes, which are a joke. You either have generic Batman-Charlie's angles type of fighting, or you get farfetched matrix-pro wresting type of fighting. Speaking of which, some of the actors in this movie even look like pro-wrestlers, and fight like them too. The movie has a lot of action in it, but to me there is just not enough substance. I didn't care how the movie turned out. You will never take the movie seriously. When you are left with a non serious horror movie, then you have to rely on comedy, action, or gore. The movie wasn't funny, so nix that, the action was ok, the gore was ok but not as good as the other two movies.

This one made up for with some interesting casting choices and lots of good fight scenes.
Ryan Reynolds portrail of Hannibal King as what could have happened to Van Wilder if things went really bad for him after college played well against the oh so badassed hardcase Blade.  It also made up for the ""Buffy with Bow"" character played by Jessica Biel, although she did make nice eye candy.
I'm not sure if casting Parker Posey was genius or just a fortunate side effect of the directory trying to get actors from A Mighty Wind in a Blade film (something that is both really cool and really wrong at the same time). I certainly liked her take on the role of a jaded Vampire.

I wasn't so thrilled with the casting of Natasha Lyonne as the blind biotech genius, I kept waiting for her to talk about ""doubleclicking her mouse.""",1115078400,,946,4.431034482758621

Somehow I knew it was going to be extremely campy. I mean, c'mon, Parker Posey is a *great* comedic actress - but a vampire? The dialogue is full of extremely clumsy cursing and lame jokes, plot holes galore and just plain boring scenes. For example, we see Jessica Biel's character practicing her archery and a number on a digital readout keeps getting higher and higher - what was that all about? That particular scene seems to last forever - how about some more violence already!?

The fight scenes are great in my view but I had to burst out laughing when they pull a ""CSI"" near the end by showing a closeup of Dracula's blood cells being infected by a virus manufactured by the good guys. There's also numerous hat-tips to the Matrix - I believe the first Blade and the first Matrix came out around the same time.

My favorite scene from the outtakes is when Parker Posey is saying a line ""I was a good Catholic Schoolgirl - once..."" and she can't say it with a straight face. There is also a completely absurd ""alternate ending"" involving a Chuck-E-Cheesy looking Werewolf attacking a casino.

If you are into the ""serious vampire stuff"" then you'll be highly offended; this movie is complete heresy in that regard. The most ironic thing about the movie is there's a scene showing Dracula getting really mad about Dracula merchandise in a store.

2245485,2,B0007V6ITE,"Certainly among the various types of movie monsters, the vampire is the most prevalent.  Why is it, then, that with so many vampire movies, there are so few decent ones?  What, in fact, is the last really good vampire film...not just okay but actually really good.  Maybe Coppola's version of Dracula or maybe From Dusk Til Dawn, but even the jury is out on those.  Certainly, Blade Trinity does not break the string of so-so vampire movies.

This rather tasteless action movie features Wesley Snipes as Blade, a vampire hunter who is half-bloodsucker himself.  When a number of vampires awaken Dracula himself, Blade is forced to battle the king of all vampires himself.  He is teamed up with some other vampire hunters, in particular Ryan Reynolds as ex-vampire Hannibal King and Jessica Biel as Abigail Whistler, daughter of Blade's mentor.  The movie consists of a lot of fight scenes complete with exploding vampires, culminating in the inevitable Blade-Dracula battle.

The plot is strictly by the book with no twists to speak of and Dracula himself is actually not all that intimidating a villain, but the principal problem in the movie is Snipes, a man who seems to have been once given a choice between being a good actor or a high-paid one and went with the latter.  With all the emotional range of Steven Seagal, Snipes's portrayal of Blade is almost laughably stiff.  In fact, even the writers are aware of this, and Reynolds gets his opportunities to mock the hero.  Biel, an actress whose biggest asset is that she is nice to look at, is underutilized, and Parker Posey, an actress whose biggest asset is that she is a good actress, is unable to do much more than ham up her role as a vampire leader.

Going back to the original question of why there are so few good vampire movies, perhaps part of the problem is that vampires are rarely used in horror movies anymore; instead, they are just villains in adventure flicks.  Whether it's a Blade movie, the truly awful Van Helsing, the passable John Carpenter's Vampires or From Dusk Til Dawn, the vampire is merely the souped up equivalent of a James Bond villain, not a truly horrific creature.  But even in the category of vampire-action movie, Blade Trinity is nothing special: not a complete waste of time, but certainly not the best use of it either.",1114992000,,2319,4.748129675810474

While Dracula's background has been updated and made interesting, his persona as Drake is pretty wooden and uninspiring.  Ryan Reynolds steals the movie.  His wise cracks are funny and he can pull off the action stuff easily.  Jessica Biel looks both sexy and deadly and they both make good companions for Blade.  Snipes owns the Blade persona and does a good job as a man facing a crisis.  Parker Posey overacts too much to be all that interesting and Triple H does a good job as hired muscle.

2245489,3,B0007V6ITE,"Recently I heard the star of Blade: Trinity (2004) Wesley Snipes had filed a lawsuit against the makers of this film due to the fact that his involvement in the creative processes (story content, editing, choice of costars and director, etc.) were greatly diminished, despite the fact his contract stipulated otherwise...whether or not that's true I don't know, but something was lost from the previous films, making this a rather lack luster outing...don't get me wrong, the film was fun, entertaining, and visually exciting, but not on the level of the last two films, in my opinion.  Written and directed (his directorial debut) by David S. Goyer (Blade, Blade II), who's also responsible for the writing chores on the upcoming comic book character based films Batman Begins (2005), Ghost Rider (2006), and The Flash (2006), the film stars Wesley Snipes (Demolition Man), Jessica Biel (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre), Dominic Purcell (star of the non-defunct TV series John Doe), and Ryan Reynolds, whom also can currently be seen in the popular remake The Amityville Horror (2005).  Also appearing is Parker Posey (A Mighty Wind), Kris Kristofferson (Payback), John Michael Higgins (voice of Mentok the Mindtaker on the Adult Swim cartoon series `Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law'), James Remar (Mortal Kombat: Annihilation), and Paul Michael Levesque, better known as WWE wrestling star Triple H.

The film begins with some helicopters crusing the Syrian Desert and landing by some ruins.  Some heavily armed individuals enter the ruins in search of something, and they find it...what is it?  Well, let's just say something wicked this way comes...and then we cut to a cityscape and we see Blade (Snipes) doing what he does best, deftly dispatching vampires using any number fancy, new weaponry (along with some classic ones) and hand-to-hand combat maneuvers.  After he accidentally kills a human `familiar' (a human lackey enlisted by a vampire), we learn the vampires have essentially set Blade up, and now he's a highly sought individual by law enforcement authorities, specifically the FBI.  He eventually does eventually get taken into custody, but is rescued by a group of vampire hunters called the Nightstalkers, including Abigail (Biel) and Hannibal King (Reynolds).  Turns out they need his help as the vampires are planning something big involving that which was awakened in the Syrian Desert at the outset of the film, something involving the granddaddy of all vampires...

When I heard a third Blade film was coming out awhile back, I was very interested as the first two were a lot of fun and just really great action films.  The movie finally got released, and then the reviews came in...some good, some indifferent, but a majority critical of what was supposed to be the grand finale in the Blade Saga.  After watching the movie last night, I can now understand where some of this criticisms stem.  My biggest complaint was there were just too many characters introduced, characters that ultimately took away from what should have been the focus of the film, that of Blade himself.  Often characters of some seemingly importance would be trotted out (Parker Posey's character, for example), only to disappear, showing up later with little consequentiality to the overall story itself.  Also, a number of characters get killed, ones we're supposed to care about, but so little was invested in them I just didn't really care... the teaming up element worked well in the 2nd film, but there it had an interesting twist.  It had potential here (the with Nightstalkers), but never really lived up to anything meaningful.  The film starts off really well with some great action sequences, but gets bogged down with an excessive amount of inactivity and a whole lot of useless junk in the middle, eventually returning to some semblance of an action orientated story near the end.  The dialog got a little silly at times, and is peppered with a whole lot more profanity than the first two films...I didn't mind that so much, but it seemed excessively and unnecessary, perhaps intended for shock value, but coming of more as just silly and childish...sometimes less is more.  These things were kind of surprising, as Goyer had done really well with the first two films.  I had read that his original story for this film was much different, one set in the future where vampires had virtually taken over, but that was nixed by the powers that be due to the fact they thought it too `dark'.  A lot of the characters felt half cooked, especially that of Biel...but at least she's really nice to look at...as far as Reynolds character Hannibal King...does this guy basically play the same type of character in every film?  The smarmy, wise-cracking, always ready with a quip guy is getting a little old (it was almost like they transported his Van Wilder character here), but, at the very least, he does get the beating a few times...he he...I will say Reynolds must have spent a lot of time in the gym for this role as he was pretty ripped.  Well, I've ragged on the film quite a bit, but what did I like about it?  I thought the action sequences that were in the film were very slick, fast paced, and well put together, and both Biel and Reynolds did well in this aspect.  And the new weapons were infinitely cool and seemed to build on previous film.  The visual look of the film was one of the best aspects, presenting a dark and moody atmosphere for a slightly less than deserving story.  I think Goyer has the potential to be a very good director, I only wish he'd made his debut on another film.  Overall I'd say this was a less than spectacular end to the series as I would have preferred a story that focused more on Blade character himself, rather than one populated by so many distractions.

Amazon lists all the copious extras for this 2 DVD release very well on their website, so I won't bother rehashing it, but I will say the picture and sound quality are spectacular, even if the film itself isn't...a worthwhile rent though (this review is based on the extended version rather than the theatrical one).  And, as another reviewer has already mentioned, if you do not own any of the Blade movies but are interested in purchasing them, look for the box set rather than the individual DVDs as you may save yourself so money.

2245490,3,B0007V6ITE,"In  Blade: Trinity, Blade accidently kills a human disguised as a a vampire. Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) warns him that he's gonna be hunted by humans now. Then right after that the F.B.I. shoot up Blade's hide-out and take Blade into custody. Before dieing, Whistler tells Blade he needs partners. He doesn't ask for any help but help finds him and rescues him from the F.B.I. . The help comes in the form of 2 younger heros who call themselves Nightstalkers. They're played by the sexy Jessica Biel and the hilarious and show stealing Ryan Reynolds.

  Biel plays Whistler's daughter that he didn't know about until after his wife and kids were killed. While Reynolds plays a wisecracking former vampire who also kicks ass. It is silly how 2 humans seem to be as strong as Blade though. I still found watching them fight fun though and Reynolds and Biel handle their action scenes great. It's Wesley Snipes who seems to be sleepwalking through the movie. Well for one since he didn't wanna make the movie from what I hear. I don't really blame him. Not saying I don't like the movie but Blade is pretty much a side character this time around.

  Also WWE's Triple H was on Raw bragging like he makes the movie good. No though, he is no Rock. Donal Logue ( Blade,Grounded For Life) and Ron Perman (Blade 2) were better as main henchmen. I was hoping though that he would steal Blade's glasses just so Blade could cut him in half and take them back lol. He may be married to the boss's daughter in wrestling so he can book himself to steal the show and be champ 20 times. He doesn't steal the show here though as much as he trys to steal scenery. He just looks out of place in this movie. Dracula is the weakest villain of the three movies as well. Parker Posey (Scream 3) shines the most as a vampire in this. The rude remarks that her and Reynolds share back and forth are great.

  The writer and director David Goyer has some clever ideas but his direction isn't good enough to pull off most of those ideas. Plus some of the lines aren't even that great. Since he wrote Batman Begins  it makes me sorta afraid of what he will have Batman saying. I doubt it will be as bad as any of the lines in Batman & Robin though. Reynolds does have some pretty silly material but he pulls off most of it. I love when Blade and Biel are late to rescue him ""after he announces that help will arrive right about now"". After they take longer than he expected he says ""ok that's awkward, anyone have a cell ?"".",1114732800,,2499,4.375809935205184

I also have to say Dominic Purcell is quite hot.  Anyway, this movie is really well done, action packed and great music, you ought to rent or buy it soon.",1114732800,4,468,4.447058823529412
2245492,3,B0007V6ITE,"On paper, Blade Trinity had the potential of being the best and baddest of the trilogy. Early on in the film, it appeared that those expectations would be easily met...and with a showdown against Dracula still on the horizon, Trinity was headed toward ""epic"" status. However, at some point the movie begins to lose focus, and at times you might wonder whether you're watching a Blade or a Nightstalkers (a new sidekick duo of Blade's) flick. The eventual battle with Dracula didn't measure up to the finale of either Blade or Blade 2, and deserved much, much more...I mean, if I didn't know better, I'd thought 'ol Drac took an early dive in that fight. Blade Trinity is the weakest of the franchise, but then again the first two ARE pretty hard to top...in spite of its flaws 'tho, Trinity still manages to entertain.",1114732800,2,818,4.6875
2245493,3,B0007V6ITE,"I was excited about a third Blade film, epecially since David Goyer was directing it and writing it. The only problem is that after Guillermo Del Toro's excellent BLADE II,(also written by Goyer) it almost seems more like a way to open a new franchise for Jessica Biel and Ryan Reynolds ( the deleted ending in the extras pretty much confirms that)and not a grand finale for Snipes to end his Blade persona. It seems like Goyer was running out of ideas and maybe it was better to put Blade to rest. The idea of bringing Dracula out to eliminate Blade seemed like a great idea (and wait until you see the special effects) but for the master vampire who is touted as being THE unstoppable being. He just seems to fall much to easy to Blade. The super vampire in Blade II put up more of a fight. Still, the movie is still a good watch and the minor nit-picking aside, you should own this one to finish off your collection. If nothing else then to see Kris Kristofferson acting out as the old grizzled vampire hunter, and Blades only friend, Whistler. It seems this time, the vampires are using the media to their advantage by tricking Blade into killing a human he thought was a vampire and taping the whole thing. They turn blade into Public Enemy Number One. So, Blade has to fight everyone off, including the FBI and the Grand Master Dracula. Biel is good (and very athletic) and Reynolds provides more of the comic relief than drama, but then that's where he started. The extras are great and it's worth owning the disc just for Goyer's commentaries and the documentaries, 16 parts. Get the unrated version though, not only do you get another 10 minutes that were cut from the R version, but the disc also includes the R version. I don't know if Snipes will ever take up the Blade role again, but I think we can be pretty much assured that Biel and Reynolds will end up in another film fighting vampires (and werewolves) again. And if you don't own any of the Blade flicks, do yourself a favor and get the three boxed set. A bargain.",1114732800,,2034,4.4411764705882355
2245503,3,B0007V6ITE,"Blade: Trinity is the second sequel to the first film, Blade, which takes place in our contemporary society where vampires rule in secret.  The vampires have powerful allies in high positions that can help protect them during the hours of daylight while in darkness they feed their thirst on human blood.  Many humans have fallen victim to the vampires' needful desire, as humans are below the vampires in the food chain.  However, one character with equal power, but who also can walk under the daylight is Blade (Wesley Snipes).  Those unfamiliar to Blade should know that he acquired the vampire infection while he was a fetus in his mother's womb, as a vampire bit his mother and transferred the vampire disease to him.

In this third installment, the audience can follow Blade's sword slashing and gun firing escapades through his nightly vampire massacres.  The film opens intriguingly in the Syrian Desert where a group of vampires visits a secret tomb in a mysterious pyramid.  However, it is also amusing, as these vampires have equipped themselves with machine guns and other high tech gear in order to explore the pyramid, which suggests that there is an immense danger present in the pyramid, as vampires require the use of heavy firepower.  This opening sequence is supposed to inform the audience of the looming horror that the audience will encounter through the film's hero, Blade, who is busy elsewhere slashing and shooting vampires in a visually garnished manner as the vampires combust into ashes through a lighting flash.

After years of murdering vampires, it seems as if Blade gets into legal trouble, as the FBI is on his tracks.  It also seems as if someone is cueing the authorities in the right direction, as they know where to go in order to arrest Blade.  When the FBI attacks Blade's compound it turns out to be a rather ludicrous event, as they easily know how to approach and beat Blade.  This raises the question, why did the vampires not use humans before in the previous films; the humans seem to be much more powerful than the vampires are, as Blade easily slices up the vampires and not humans.  The old notion of invincible power of vampires no longer serves its purpose, as it used to generate some trepidation and angst. In Blade: Trinity, the vampires simply serve the purpose of being cheap, boring, and repetitive fireworks that only display one color.

The idea for the theme is noble, yet it never takes off the ground, as the story seems to deal with too many issues while none are thoroughly explored.  It leaves the audience with a rather empty experience, as the mega-evil villain's best skill seems to be escaping and talking.  It would be preferred to the audience if the evil that the vampire awakens in the desert were illustrated in a manner that would make the audience feel a little fear or horror.  Yet, the evil displays why talking is cheap, as it will make the audience feel cheated in the end, as a number of cinematic clichs have been used in order to get to the final scene.  This makes much of the film rather predictable and unoriginal, which it already is by being a second sequel with a title hinting towards trilogy.

The overall experience that Blade: Trinity offers is a passable cinematic event, as the script has occasional awkwardness and the tiresome fireworks provided dying vampires.  The camerawork occasional displays high quality, as does the mise-en-scene, which helps in enhancing the experience.  The cast's performance shows occasional problems, however, they could possibly be a result of either the script or the direction on the set while shooting the film.  Parker Posey on the other hand provides a convincingly intriguing vampire character.  When Blade: Trinity unfolds, all of these aspects do not provide an experience close to the first film of Blade while it rests close with the first sequel.",1114646400,,3886,4.863429438543247

And their casting of Dracula was completely wrong. I mean terribly wrong.

Also, Blade and Whistler seem to be killing or severely injuring humans in this movie - blasting them with shotguns, blowing them up, etc. I found that reprehensible. What's the point of vampire hunting if not to protect humans?",1114646400,5,459,4.9480519480519485

Blade has always been good, but I wasn't sure about the idea of tackling Dracula, as well as the fact that I've never been a huge fan of Jessica Biel.

But I must say, I was somewhat impressed. I'm not going to go into what happens in the movie, but Dominic Purcell does a decent job as the mighty father of all vampires, but the movie still goes to Ryan Reynolds, and even Biel is tolerable here.

Here's my one beef with the movie: what (...) was that that Dracula turned into at the very end of the movie during his fight with Blade? That was a little too over the top for even this movie!

Jessica Biel ""Abagail Whistler or Whistler"" is smoking hott in this movie too. She's also a martial artist and can whoop any regular vampires butt.

Parker Posey ""Main female Vampire"" , this woman is smoking hott too , she puts in a decent performance , most of her work was believable , but she knew no ""martial arts"".

Dominic Purcell aka ""Dracula aka Drake"" does a solid job. He's not a bad actor at all. In the movie he's not a martial artist either , but he's a pro at the sword , better than Blade. But no Vampire is immortal.

2245507,3,B0007V6ITE,"BLADE-TRINITY is a fantastical ride of a movie that even those of us fatigued by the larger-than-life comic book hero flicks literally poured out weekly onto the hungry theater big screens can tolerate. The production values make the most of clever weird appliances and nasty structural situations that defy reason: the animation (vampire Pomeranian dogs, transformation costumes for Dracula AKA Drake, conflagration disintegration of human bodies by the silver tip, human blood farms, endless variations on the vampire denture appliances, etc) is entertaining as is the copycat choreography from the CTHD ilk of films.

The cast of characters has broadened, some with bit parts played by big names, others by naughty funny parts played by newcomers. Wesley Snipes has little acting to do as Blade, the daytripper semiVampire, but his presence is strong. Kris Kristofferson was plugged into the story as a non-additive cameo with Jessica Biel as his daughter, the one who leads the Blade Aides, Parker Posey is given a tour de force role as a really bad Vampirette, and yet another fine Australian import Dominic Purcell makes a handsome Drake/Dracula. But for the new viewers some of the best parts of this entertaining blood bath enter in the form of Ryan Reynolds as Hannibal King, a hunky, buff grossly under used actor with a keen sense of comic timing who can bring script lines alive with his delivery and light up the screen every time he is given the chance. This comedic touch, a tongue in cheek approach to the silly story, is taken up by all the characters but with less successful effect. Reynolds just makes it work!

You gotta be in the mood for this kind of film, but at last here is a comic book scary hero movie that is full of entertaining laughs - and that is somewhat of a first! Grady Harp, February 06",1114646400,,1824,4.842948717948718

John Doe as Drake, Dracula, whatever you wanta call him, yeah bad choice in my opinion. They clearly needed someone BIGGER, like Triple H's size, who, by the way, also sucked in the this movie, not only did he have platnum fangs like some two bit gangsta rappa, but there was his complete inability to ACT!!! The vampire dogs, now that was a dumb idea. I haven't seen an idea that dumb since my best friend climbed up a tree when he was drunk one night and fell out of it. No, he didn't die.

I was expecting something more apocalyptic as far as the story went since they were planning on bringing the king of vampires, Dracula, into this film. Instead, we get a story that doesn't seem as big as what it should be. I would expect something like Dracula declaring war on the human race or something around those lines.

Despite the biggest shortcoming, in the story that is, the rest of the film is pretty decent. The acting is pretty good and the casting...well...can't really complain too much. Although I was expecting a more clam and dark looking Dracula character. No offense to David Purcell, who played his role well, but it just doesn't seem to fit. It also seems Dracula is used more as a pawn in the film rather than the ring-leader.

The dialogue is very colorful since this film has more humor than the previous two. While it is nice, but for a film like Blade, it seems to heavily dilute the seriousness of the film and almost makes the film, itself, seem like a joke.

The final battle between Blade and Dracula has got to be the shortest out of all three Blade films. Kinda depressing since he is being pit against Dracula.

Remember how uncomfortable he looked during his ""post humping"" chat with Eugene Levy?  The shame and embarassment that he so keenly showed in his face?  Yeah...that's how the cast should feel for agreeing to be in this flunky-fest.  As for the writer/director...well all I can say is the same few things I say to my new puppy Reggie when he has an accident on the carpet: Bad Boy, Bad Bad Boy!  And Ohhhh what a mess Goyer made on the big screen carpet.  From the opening sequence to the ending credits I found endless reasons to believe that he may have in fact paid a few ten year olds to ""guest direct"" for him while he took a few months to relax somewhere.  The scenes were choppy, jerky and dull.  The action sceens were like re-runs of the other two movies.  Say, here's a ground breaking idea...try something (oh my, shall I actually say this) NEW!  Blade can jump-boring, he can kick-boring, he can chop people up with his sword-boring.  But wait, so can his new ""gang"" with their slick and hip and ultra edgy gadgets and dialogue.  I imagine Goyer hung out at an alternative jr. high for a few hours and BLAM, he had all the witty and curse-ridden lines for the entire movie.  This movie was among one of the worst movies I have ever sat through.  The sad thing is that I loved the other two Blade movies.  I was blown away by the first and the second had a few goofy lines in the script, but the gore, action, and care given by the director saved it.

Blade movies were one of the few outlets that ""grown up"" comic fans had.  The violence was there, the style, the music...the whole entity had a flow and just felt ""cool.""  With most other comic movies targeting kids and having a lighter rating, silliness to some degree  has to be expected.  With Blade Trinity, the grown-up fan is left wondering how ridiculous Joel Schumacher-ish Batman and Robin type one-liners leaked in.  How Ipod product placement (four times that I saw) became so vital to vampire hunting, and why viewers would even remotely care about anything Blade-related after being visually and verbally insulted for what felt like a eight hour movie.

2245516,4,B0007V6ITE,"It's tough to be a bloodsucker. No, I'm not referring to lawyers or agents. I'm referring to vampires. The big, nasty ugly kind of vampires that populate the world of ""Blade Trinity"" and hate silver, stakes the usual assortment of items popular in these types of films.  The third film in the trilogy may or not be the last depending upon the final box office count and home video sales. As a popcorn film ""Blade Trinity"" has all that: it's got a sword fight that looks like it was lifted from the ""Highlander"" film; there's a higher body count than all the ""Lethal Weapon"" movies combined; there's enough pearly whites on display to send an orthodontist into ecstasy. Oh and there's lots of toys, very, very cool toys.

Based on the Marvel comic book character created by Marv Wolfman (there's a perfect man for a horror/adventure comic) and Gene Colan, ""Blade Trinity"" continues the adventures of a hybrid human-vampire named Blade (Wesley Snipes)and vampire killer  Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) as they try to wipe out the scourge that has plagued humanity for centuries. The threat this time is even worse; the original vampire that started it all has been discovered.

The vampires turn the table on Blade painting him as a psychopath resulting in a massive police hunt. Using familiars (mortals working for the vampires) within the police department, the vampires hope to capture and kill Blade. Luckily, they fail to take into account two fellow vampire hunters by the name of Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds from `The Amnityville Horror"") and Abigail Whistler (Jessica Biel ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"").

Despite an annoying dance music soundtrack by Ramin Djawadi and The RZA, ""Blade Trinity"" works very well as a fun, profanity laced action adventure film. Director/writer David Goyer (""Batman Begins"", ""Blade"", ""X2"", ""Blade II"", ""The Puppetmasters"")digs right in giving audiences just enough of a recap about Blade so they can follow the adventure.  Snipes invests Blade with as much depth as a cardboard cut out but surprisingly his approach works. Blade works best as a strong, silent action hero. Filled with a solid supporting cast including Parker Posey, ""Blade Trinity"" never rises above its comic book origins and that's just fine for fans of the series. I'd suggest the bloodier and gorier unrated edition for fans as it captures the spirit of the original comic book best.

The picture quality is pretty good although it lacked the vibrant colors I would have expected from such a bloodfest. The 5.1 soundtrack is very, very active with the action bopping around like a dancing fool. The feature is located on the first disc with all the special features on the second. That's just as well as it allows more disc space for higher image quality and a sharper, cleaner soundtrack.

Special features include two trivia filled commentary tracks by David Goyer, Jessica Biel, Ryan Reynolds and various production and crew members. Curiously missing is Wesley Snipes who recently filed suit against the producers and the studio. There's a fascinating 16 part behind-the-scenes documentary entitled ""Daywalkers, Nightwalkers & Familiars"" as well as a blooper reel and an alternate ending that doesn't quite work as well as the finished one.

2245519,2,B0007V6ITE,"After losing the battle for humanity to Blade (Wesley Snipes) numerous times, the vampires (led by Parker Posey, and yes, you sadly read that right) have called upon their ultimate weapon, Dracula (a stunningly miscast Dominic Purcell), to destroy their archenemy. However, Blade is faced with his own problems after being charged with murder, leaving a group of vampire hunters called The Nightstalkers (including Ryan Reynolds, Jessica Biel, and Patton Oswalt) as his only allies.

'Blade: Trinity' suffers from a newly discovered syndrome called 'Seed of Chuckyism,' named after Don Mancini's appalling horror sequel that invaded cinemas last year. The 'Blade' series has been written by David Goyer every step of the way, yet 'Trinity' is his first stab at directing a vampire adventure himself. Much like 'Chucky,' the rationale is that by letting the creator behind the camera, he will know best how the franchise should be run. And much like 'Chucky,' 'Trinity' is a disorganized, chaotic film that directly flies in the face of what was accomplished in the previous sequel.

'Blade II' was directed by Guillermo Del Toro ('Hellboy'), and that fanboy-beloved filmmaker put a sticky sense of horror back into the comic book-based title character. Del Toro also treated the material with respect, even questing to bring an epic feel to what is traditionally a simplistic martial arts extravaganza occasionally interrupted by bloodsucking freaks. 'Trinity' casually throws away what Del Toro worked hard to achieve, and Goyer replaces the fun with heaps of numbing blow-em-up material, and the worst editing I've seen in a motion picture in some time. And not just the fight sequences either, which are ridiculously overcooked and unnecessarily captured with just about every angle imaginable, but even in the dialogue. It feels as though Goyer is sloppily trying to cover deleted story points, as his sequences aimlessly bounce across the room without much reason. 'Trinity' is a disjointed and headache-inducing experience right from the start, when in actuality; a 'Blade' film shouldn't feel like that until the last 20 minutes. The movie opens with an uninspired, baffling opening credits sequence, and it just gets worse from there.

Another criticism comes with the title. The picture is called 'Blade: Trinity,' yet our friendly neighborhood vampire killer is hardly the focus of this sequel. It's almost hilarious to see Snipes standing around in the background, waiting for something to do as Goyer tends to a subplot featuring Whistler's (Kris Kristofferson) daughter, Abigail (Biel), or his incessant need to have everybody walk around in slow motion. Blade isn't the focal point of 'Trinity,' which is confusing to the franchise, and leaves the audience with a participation gap the first two films were careful to avoid.

Moreover, who decided that Dracula, that king of kings when it comes to nightmares, should be played by an actor who resembles a German nightclub bouncer? 'Trinity' can never quite overcome that critical casting mistake.

'Trinity,' unexpectedly, is also somewhat of a comedy, with the Nightstalkers led by Hannibal King, nicely played by rising comic ace, Ryan Reynolds. Reynolds is here to have some fun, and his ad-libs work for the most part due to his snarky delivery and general ease with playing a macho vampire hunter. Reynolds saves 'Trinity' with his timing. Faced with the likes of Posey as a chic vamp goddess (who can't spit out her dialog while wearing her vampire teeth) and Blade 'coochie-cooing' an infant, we'll call this an easy lay-up for Reynolds, but his presence is welcome. In fact, if Goyer decides to spin-off the franchise and make a sole Nightstalkers movie (which, to be honest, is all 'Trinity' really is), that would be the best idea to come out of this flaccid franchise yet.

For the finale, 'Blade: Trinity' crumbles into a thousand tiny pieces. Characters introduced are quickly forgotten, what little logic there is (and should be expected of a 'Blade' film) falls completely by the wayside, and there's an odd, almost impressionistic ending that neither provokes nor answers any questions about the resolution. Goyer was simply the wrong man to set loose in this world, for now the once promising 'Blade' franchise has been crippled by his unfortunate tinkering. ---- 2/5",1114128000,4,4348,5.204285714285715

Blade II, I rank up there with one of the best comic book movies ever made. It totally embodied what a comic book is. Colorful, graphic, a little cmapy and a little over the top. I think Blade II and X-Men 2 are two of the best comic book movies ever done. So, here comes Blade III......naturally i was excited. Then i heard Ryan Reynolds ( Van Wilder himself) was gonna be in it, i was stoked. I went opening weekend, and man, what a let down. The story was weak, the action generic, and choppy and the acting was pretty bad. The only saving grace was the dry wit of Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds). I don't blame Wesley Snipes suing someone over what a train wreck this film was. I mean the final fight between Blade and Drake, was so f-ing weak. I mean for the head Vampire, i would have thought it would have been a fight scene that rivaled any Jackie Chan or Jet Li film. But, alas, it was not. As a fan of the series, im sure i will buy it on DVD next week, watch it again, and pray i was in a bad mood or something when i saw it the first time, so this time it will seem better.

However despite all of this you might be interested to know of what Wesley Snipes thinks about the movie.

 Snipes has sued New Line Cinema, writer-director David Goyer and executive producer Toby Emmerich in a wide-ranging federal lawsuit seeking more than $5 million in damages, Variety reported. In the suit filed April 18 in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, Snipes alleges that, in violation of his contract, the director, screenplay and supporting cast of Blade: Trinity were forced on him. He also claims he's still owed a portion of his fee and that he was harassed and defamed because of his race, the trade paper reported. New Line declined to comment to Variety. Goyer wrote all three Blade scripts. According to the complaint, however, Snipes had concerns about his directing the third film in the trilogy and was not informed until six weeks before filming began that Goyer would direct. Similarly, he was not given an opportunity to object to the ""juvenile level of humor"" in the screenplay and the change in focus from the Blade character to two sidekicks, played by Ryan Reynolds and Jessica Biel. Snipes claims the real purpose of Blade III was to set the stage for spinoffs featuring other cast members, the trade paper reported. Snipes blames Goyer for the critical response to the film, citing reviews describing Goyer as a ""disastrous choice"" and calling the film a ""bloody mess."" Blade: Trinity, released last December, has grossed $52 million at the domestic box office. Snipes alleges that he is still owed over $3 million on his fee.",1113955200,2,1827,4.6532507739938085

Jessical Biel was decent in her role. Can't really say more for her than that. She's good eye candy and she filled the role, but she didn't excel in it.

After all that the hero has been through in the first two movies,beating real Vampire villains and saving whistler only to have him killed off ten minutes into the movie proves my point.

Jessica Biel (Abegail Whistler)was less than convincing heroine.....yet another skinny white girl who wants to break out into action movies....Yawn.

Tired joke dialogue coupled with absolutely no realistic storyline,bad camera direction all combined to push the namesake hero out of the picture entirely.(over half of the cinema audience actually walked out of the theatre)UK

The only film more lame than Blade - Trinity is Alien 4....both films have as much use on dvd as ashtrays.

2245530,4,B0007V6ITE,"Look, to tell you the truth, I didn't like the first Blade movie all that much.  The second I started watching, but then something came up, and I never did get around to finishing it.

Now, with the third film (and supposedly, the last) Blade, I must say that I ended up enjoying myself, despite my previous bad outlook on Blade.

For one thing, in my opinion, I found the vampire's plan to have Blade framed as a murderer (which he is, since he kills humans too- yeah, yeah, they are in league with vampires, but still) by having him taped while he kills a human, as something that they should have done ages ago.  I mean, if I was a vampire, and realized that Blade has been killing my kind quite so easily, why not have the human police hunt him down for us.

Secondly, I was glad that this Blade included more ""heroes"" rather than just Blade, which I don't really like. Maybe it is the way Wesley Snipes portrays him, but I always found him to be the most boring hero ever.  I mean, he has zero personality, and the only time I can tolerate him on screen is when he's fighting some vampire.  Otherwise, any ""talking"" by him is a bore.  Luckily, We have Abigail and Hannibal King to make the movie entertaining (at least to me.)

I found Abigail to be passable as the warrior chick she's supposed to be.  Although, I did have to suspend my disbelief quite a lot, when she seemingly took down dozens of vampires on her own.  I mean, she's a regular human right? Vampires have super strenght right? Let's face it, she's a female, which makes her physically weaker than a man, and I highly doubt any female, no matter how martial artsy she is, can take a dozen guys.  I mean, they could all just tackle jump her and take her down.  Now, we have her fighting vampires who are way, way stronger than any man, and she's kicking butt like there is no tomorrow.  Still, if you leave logic behind, she does look good while kicking vampire butt.  Although, fighting with music blasting out of your earphones wouldn't make sense either. I mean, don't you want to be able to hear when someone is approaching from behind?

Hannibal King was funny.  Yeah, he was probably the best thing in the movie, because he at least had a personality.  Watching Blade is like watching a doorknob act, while King, even if his jokes are corny somethings, is at least likeable.  Once again, my gripe comes when he fights vampires.  Sigh, I mean, he's fighting that huge dude (a wrestler I think) and he's holding his own.  I mean, come on, the size of the guy alone means that even if he were a plain human, he would beat King to pulp.  But no, he's a vampire to boot, and he still lost??

Frankly, I had no problem with the main villain, as I've seen many reviewers here do.  For one thing, we are assuming he's Dracula.  Yes, he is in a way, but think about it.  You are complaining about this character based on our preconceived notions of what we think Dracula should be/act/behave.  Well, the movie even makes fun of any preconception of Dracula, when he walks into that Dracula store.

The final battle was ok.  I can see why some people thought it was rather flimsy, but at least it was better than Blade 1's. No deus ex machina super serum to save the day, at least- I mean, so much for a god vampire.

In conclusion, this might be the first Blade film I will actually buy to keep.  Having rented the others, I never felt the want or need to see them again.",1111536000,4,3439,4.33489827856025

The two partners with no super strength or speed were beating vampires as easily as Blade. The major let down was when Blade and Dracula had their final battle.

Overall, he should have stayed in bed and let someone else take the movie seriously. Oh, the constant jokes by the co-star got WAY OUT OF HAND!",1111276800,4,546,4.525252525252525
2245532,1,B0007V6ITE,"Blade Trinity is one of the least imaginative and dullest movies i have ever seen. There is nothing about this film that sells itself to the viewer or the marketeer. The plot is extremely poor and cliched, we have the resurection of Dracula who is used by vampire assassins to hunt down and destroy blade. It is quite sad to see a film franchise which cleverly updated the vampire myth to the 21st century in the previous two films with it's moving away from fantasy/supernatural and towards science fiction (vampirism explained as a harpo-virus in film 2, crosses don't work in film 1) reduced to reliance on a camp update of the ultra-traditional (Dracula).

The set pieces were ugly (no more trendy nightclubs or ancient ruins - just nondescript steel corridors now), the casting was diabolical (particularly Dracula and Blade's annoyingly comic male sidekick) , the dialogue was grating on the nerves, they even used some of the things they did in the other two films (eg when Dracula threatens to sacrifice an innocent child to protect himself from Blade - compared to film 1 when Frost did the same). The fight scenes were inferior to the first two films, there are too many fight scenes - if people just want to see choregraphic violence they can watch WWF. There is no atmosphere to the film. The main villain is a bad actor but to be fair the character he plays is a mess. How can a Dracula who has some sense of cliched 'honour' use a child as a human shield? How can a character who is supposed to be an arch villain - the martial equal of Blade - spend all his time running away from Blade? And then there is the scene in the fake-vampire shop were Dracula kills some poor kids because they verbally insult him, surely he would be above that given 1. his power and position and 2. the cliched honour i mentioned above. The characters that make up Blade's sidekicks are extremely forgetable and bland with the exception of the main sidekick who is memorable for all the wrong reasons...In a film which is supposed to be a brooding dark gothic sci fi/horror this guy sticks out like the Pope in Mecca, his lame efforts at providing comic relief and a contrast to Blade are truly irritating.

Sometimes a film which falls far short in the traditional categories (plot, acting etc) makes up some ground in the arena of style. Blade I was one of the most stylish horror movies ever made, this film looks like it was made on a budget of $200,000. The only good thing about this film was the vampire dogs, it was a tiny speck of originality in an otherwise forgettable mess.",1111190400,6,2579,4.556034482758621

Instead it seemed like more screen time went to the talentless duo of Ryan Reynolds and Jessica Biel.  It would have been better if Blade just unleashed his uncontrollable thirst, and slaughtered those two dimwits.  Vampire hunters.  Yeah, right.  More like vampire bait.

I hated the storyline.  Dracula, while aesthetically pleasing, really did not amount too much.  He seemed just about as vicious as a chihuahua in heat.  The lines were laughable, and the cartoonish performance of Triple H (please don't come out in anymore movies!  I thought Hulk Hogan was terrible) and Parker Posey (What happened, Parker?  Did stinkers like Scream 3 and Urban Legends typecast you as a scream queen?) made me wish for Stephen Dorff again.  Why did they kill off Whistler?

In the last movie Guillermo Del Toro directed it and in this writer turned director Davis S. Goyer takes a nab at the third installment and fails. The only good thing in number 3 is that Wesley Snipes (The Art Of War, Liberty Stands Still) isn't a special effect that much like in the 2nd one. In some of the scenes you know Snipes is a special effect but they hide it perfectly. This movie has Blade still hunting down those bloodsuckers with the same old Whistler, Kris Kristofferson (Chelsea Walls, Payback). Badguys, Parker Posey (Scream 3, Party Girl), Triple H (in his first movie) to name a couple of them,find in Iraq an ancient evil, actually its supposed to be Dracula or Drake or whatever you wanna call it...the first evil, played by Dominic Purcell (Tv's John Doe, Equilibrium). Blade is arrested by police chief James Remar (Drugstore Cowboy, Warriors). Then 2 young ruffians, Hannibal King, played by Ryan Reynolds (Amityville Horror, Alarmist) and Abigail Whistler played by Jessica Biel (Summer Catch, Tv's 7th Heaven) rescue him and bring him back to the rest of their crew which includes a blind woman, Natasha Lyonne (American Pie Trilogy) and a whiz at technology, comedian Patton Oswalt (Aqua Teen Hunger Force). Things go AWOL after that. A major letdown. Lighter in texture and direction then the 2nd one but this one has some of the same feel to it from the action scenes. The end battle scene with Blade and Drake is nothing compared to the other 2 end battle scenes from the 1st and 2nd. Reynolds buffed up some from his Van Wilder to a Vampire Slaying Van Wilder as he adds some funny bits but its hard to see him be all tough and buff. Biel is sexy as Abigail but she has nothing on her except for sexy curves. Wrestler Triple H can't act. Kris Kristofferson's Whistler is killed off in a unsatisfying way. Purcell doesnt make a convincing Dracoola and he doesnt even come close to being a cool bad guy as Stephen Dorff's Frost in number 1 and Luke Goss' Nomak in number 2....they were way cooler. Also starring John Michael Higgins (After The Sunset, Best In Show) as that evil shrink and a amusing cameo by comedian Eric Bogosian (Talk Radio, Wonderland) as a Talk Show Host. I'm sorta praying for a 4th one..bring back director Stephen Norrington (Directed Blade 1) but I don't wanna see a fourth one. This makes a trademark role for Wesley Snipes.

Do any of you remember the OJ chase, no helicopters?  6)  Why would Vampires waste time with a vamp dog? why introduce competition when you are top of the food chain?  7)  Why waste the resources producing a vamp dog?  8) Why are the vampires smart enough to find this ancient menace but to dumb to destroy blade's team.  9)when Blade finds the Vampire hideout why would Whistler's daughter not try to stay close to Blade.  10) As established in the first two movies, Blade is the only being capable of matching the Vampires speed and strength.  Yet in this movie, Whistler's daughter and the other guy(who is just annoying) can fight pound for pound equally with vampires.  11)When  triple H has the annoying guy in a one on one fight, why not just snap his neck?

The fights scenes were weak compared to the first films. Blade Trinity is definitely the weakest movie out of the 3 but its alright and not as bad as the critics make it out to be.

Most of the problems seem to be just bad editing and bad camera angles between cuts which wasn't fluid enough to see all the action. I wish Snipes would of been involved during the editing process of the film during the fights like the previous movies. I wish Jeff Ward was involved as stunt coordinator/fight coordinator because it seemed like Trinity fight team(Chuck Jeffries, Perez, Clay-Wes stunt double) ran out of ideas with the fights that wasn't the case with the first flicks.

The Drake vs Blade fight should of been more epic, the Nomack fight was more compelling this one.  Also there was no build up between Blade & Drake.  I think if this movie had a more experience director it could of been epic like the book.  If Del Toro was involved in this project Blade would of went out with a bang.

Poor casting: The supporting actors were lifeless and appeared forced to act in this movie. They were a horrible pick for roles. Even Wesley Snipes looked uncomfortable around his team mates.

No cool action sequences: The action scenes were poorly choreographed. The punches and kicks lacked ""pow!"".

No intriguing dialogue: The dialogue is kept a little too simple and brief. Lots of corny one-liners.

In short: Blade 1 kicked butt, Blade 2 was half way decent, but Blade 3 really ended the reputation of one of the coolest comic book heros for good. It's a shame. The Blade storyline/character had potential.",1107302400,6,738,5.066115702479339
2245543,4,B0007V6ITE,"I will be very honest with you...I disliked the first two Blade films they were completely different than any vampire movie I had ever seen.  So when my cousin came to town and wanted to see it I wasn't expecting too much.  Having said that, I really enjoyed this one.  I felt that this movie was the best in the series.  Mostly due to the fact that it had the kid that played Van Wilder on National Lampoon's Van Wilder and also Jessica Beal from 7th Heaven.

  The story was kind of like the TV series Dark Angel in which Blade is trying to solve the mystery of certain events within the vampire community.  He is framed for killing a human who had dental implants of vampire fangs.  So the cops are after him and Blade is trying to figure out who he can trust and who he can't.  Whistler ends up dead and Blade is eventually arrested.  Whistler's daughter whom Blade had no clue about and her friend break into the police station and rescue Blade.  Then they go after the vampires responsible for the humans death.

  The biggest drawback to this film was the fact that they used a ""pop princess"" actress to play the ruthless villain vampire and it comes across as totally messed up.  Parker Posey as a vampire is totally rediculous.  The only other complaint I had was that they killed Whistler who was the best thing about the first two films.

  Overall this film was great with the exception of these two drawbacks.  I think if you enjoyed the first film you will enjoy this one and if you disliked the first films you will probably enjoy this one alot more.  Thanks!",1107216000,3,1574,4.392361111111111

Trinity has what all Blade fans could want from it, from the vampires to the weapons and new heroes. The new cast is amazing with Ryan Reynolds shining above the rest.  WWE fans will be pleased with the appearance of Triple H who handles his role with ease.  Wesley Snipes is his usual self, delivering a good performance. With a story taking you back to the first vampire and great action, fans of this genre of movie will be pleased.  Overall, Great entertainment!!!",1106956800,,617,4.54054054054054
2245545,3,B0007V6ITE,"I felt that 3 stars would better suit this particular review because I didn't feel that giving it any more credit would be as necessary as giving it any less. This is David Goyer's second directorial effort, since Zig-Zag, but I have said this before and will say it again. Blade 2 is your best of the bunch. Forget about the infamous digital stuntmen that got almost every Blade fan, including my brother, into a tizzy. I believe that Del Toro did an excellent job at making the mythology of Blade his own and blended the right amounts of darkness and comedy, all the while surrounding it with  sprawled-out, comic-like surroundings. Of course this is my opinion and most people love the first film anyway so what the hey. With Trinity, Goyer wanted to deviate from the urban/dramatic feel of the first installment and the gothic/horror element of the second. I actually enjoyed the fact that Trinity took on a sort of Shaft-esque vibe, especially in the opening sequence where Blade emerges from the fire and the camera freezes at various points in the action during the credits, very much like what you'd see in a 70's blaxpoitation film. The major fault of this film however is the overuse of contacts and vampire mouthpieces, which were so ridiculous on Parker Posey's part that you just had to cringe. Most people hated Ryan Reynold's performance, but I must admit that I was cracking up in the theater at the immensely obnoxious lines he spat out every 2 minutes. One of the lines is so funny I can't even say it here, but just see the film yourself to find out. Dracula, as played by ""John Doe""'s Dominic Purcell, delivers a painfully bland performance here, and his character, being all high and mighty, seemed to have no control over what seemed to be a band of idiots in the first place. Where is the House of Erebus when you need it? The final confrontation wasn't what I'd call worth all the years many have invested into the trilogy itself, and I definitely would not care to see a 4, since it will never happen, but it was fun and made me forget all my troubles for an hour and a half. Isn't that what movies are supposed to do anyway? Check it out.",1106697600,,2164,4.534526854219949
2245546,1,B0007V6ITE,"I had initially good things to think about the third installment of Blade, before I saw it.  First, the first Blade was well directed and had good acting.  As such, the script had good dialogue and action sequences were pleasing to the eye.  Secondly, the second Blade topped the first Blade in story, acting, and script.  Everything in the second Blade far exceeded the first Blade.  On the other hand, after seeing Blade Trinity I was very disappointed in the film.

First, the dialogue in the film was awful and the use of profanities in certain scenes did not make sense.  Especially the scene where Dracula fights Blade.  As such, there are instances when certain profanities serve a purpose in a persons current emotional state of mind or in order to illicit an emotional response from someone else by using an emotionally laden word.  Still, the actor that played Dracula was a bad choice and Dracula was suppose to be this great villian ala Frost from the first film, but he was more of a subordinate villian.

Secondly,  the acting in the film was not on par with the previous films, but was on par with direct to video films.  In addition, Parker Posey can act, its just I think she thought she was acting in a different movie, like a corny comedy.  The trailer for Blade Trinity showed Parker Posey as this serious, not to be messed with vampire, but when you see her in the film, she's like a comedic vampire.  Also, the actors were trying to pull the film off like a comedy, Blade was not a comedy, it is of the action/horror genre, not a comedy.  As well, they had a pomeranian (dog) vampire for a comedic device that would be better placed in a comedy than in a blade film.

Thirdly,  the story premise was very weak, but it had good elements.  For instance, bringing Dracula into the film was a good idea.  On the other hand, Dracula did not look like some major threat like Frost or the Reavers, Dracula looked like a threat on par to the pomeranian.  I could not take Dracula in Blade as a real threat and think that not much effort was put into building up the character of Dracula in Blade Trinity.  In addition, when the vampires framed Blade, why did Blade not show the authorities he was a vampire?  I mean he is the proof that vampires exist in the film and therefore he would put credibility to himself in terms of fighting vampires.  As such, I did not buy into certain plot elements.  For instance, (spoiler ahead) when the blind woman was killed and when Dracula used the baby to keep Blade from attacking him felt like deja vu from the first Blade.  As well, Whistler is killed again, no what purpose was served to kill Whistler in the first Blade, bring him back in the second, and then kill him again in the third, that just totally confused me.  Also, the addition of the night stalkers was a bad idea, because the character of Blade (Wesley Snipes in general) is better off as the sole hero (Spider Man, Batman, Superman, the Hulk........excluding the X Men and the Fantastic Four.)

Finally, the film was hard to watch with its poor dialogue, poor script, unfunny comedic lines, plot holes I could drive a semi-truck through, a villian that was as powerful as a pomeranian, supporting cast that dragged the film into an utter cinematic abyss, and it is unlikely that another Blade will be created.  As such, this film deserves no stars and it should be pulled from theaters, then redone like Wes Craven did to Cursed.  But its too bad that Blade Trinity was so bad, because I liked the first two, and was very disappointed with the third film.  On the other hand, Ghost Rider, Fantastic Four, Batman Begins, Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith, and Superman will help wash the bad taste of Blade: Trinity.",1106179200,8,3734,4.521609538002981
2245547,4,B0007V6ITE,"The film brings to the screen the story of Blade, a vampire hunter, himself a human-vampire hybrid in which he must battle the long forgotten and recently resurrected ""original"" vampire, Drake.  It is a highly entertaining, action-packed adventure combining significant elements of horror and surprisingly, comedy.

Wesley Snipes, Kris Kristofferson, and Jessica Biel (the choice for lead actress was GREAT) carry out their performances very well, however, that cannot be said for the rest of the cast who with the exception of the huge vampire with the silver tipped/capped teeth fail miserably in their respective roles.

Ryan Reynolds, as Hannibal King, does overdo it with his character's attitude; it gets tiring and very annoying after a while!  Subsequently, he is not convincing in his role.

Moreover, the actress portraying the leader of the vampires was a very poor choice indeed, being neither frightening nor sexy.  Subsequently, she is not convincing in her role.

Furthermore, what was the point of the blind scientist/mother???  To show that Blade-Trinity is Politically Correct??? Give us a break...

Aside from that, the plot, the setting, the special effects, the MUSIC, and the swordfights are all EXCELLENT!  Blade-Trinity is a movie guaranteed to provide an evening's entertainment.",1106179200,2,1304,5.442786069651741
2245548,3,B0007V6ITE,"This third installment of the Blade Trilogy really begins to move Blade to the background a bit.  Although the primary story is allegedly the original Dracula vs. Blade, the supporting cast really outshine the leads.  Jessica Biel is sufficiently sullen as the vampire huntress who cranks up her iPod while wielding a huge, specialized bow with various types of vampire-destroying ordnance, and Ryan Reynolds is hilarious with his devil-may-care attitude and creative epithets.  Similarly, Parker Posey's vampiress is just over-the-top, so-bad-it's-good funny.

The problem with the film is the story, which is surprising, since the writer of the two previous Blade films wrote and directed this one.  The film tries to accomplish too much, and in the end, most of the subplots simply do not go anywhere.  Even the ""main"" plot doesn't really completely resolve--I guess they had to leave the door open for another sequel if the box office warranted one.  From what I have read, this is probably it for Blade, although the groundwork is certainly there for a Hannibal King, Whistler's daughter, or nightstalkers spin-off.

Fortunately, the film never takes itself too seriously or pretends to be anything other than what it is--a high energy slugfest in which Blade, Whistler's Daughter, and Hannibal King wage a search, insult, and destroy mission against the vampire population.  If you're looking for an action film that boasts  snarky humor, stunning marital arts, and vampire dogs, then you may very well enjoy this.

There was little to arouse my interest, except for a couple of brilliant insults uttered by the 'comic relief' character who was one of Blade's sidekicks and I cannot remember his name.  However, not even Jessica Biel could save this mindless trash.  Whistler dies ... again (but we all know that there is nothing that can keep that man down).  Despite the fact that every law enforcement group in the world was after Blade, I felt strangely unconcerned.  He's already gone up against a god, and those freaks in the second one.  A bunch of cops aren't going to cut it.

It was certainly the most unconvincing version of Dracula I have ever seen - as well as the weirdest looking looking female vampire villain, who was more amusing than scary.",1105833600,4,795,4.635714285714286

Actually no, the moment the vampire gives the sun the proverbial ""bird"", I knew then and there that Blade had become a joke.  The only upside to this movie, if there was one, was Ryan Renolds.  His presence alone allowed me to sit and stay the length on this movie.  It seemed the director tried too hard.  Every scene with the bad guys had them entering in slow-motion with quasi-cool music with bass lines.  How cool can it be if the main bad guy is Dracula?  Dracula?!  Ugh...

Jessica Biel uses a bow and arrow (if you've seen the movie, you know what I'm talking about when I say that that's friggin hot!!!), and her friend uses guns and trash talk(hilarious!) as his primary weapons, Blade uses his trademark sword and gun combo, while throwing in some colorful, language filled remarks. Speaking of language, while I don't mind cussing, I think they made Blade's language a little too colorful this time around. A character is a badass if he talks a little and fights a lot. A character is a badass if he talks a lot AND fights a lot. A character is NOT a badass when he fights a lot and uses [....] as every other word in his sentence!!!

I mean come on, Wesley's mouth piece (Blade's teeth) was way too big.  And since when are all the bad guys morons?  In 1 & 2 they only had one, maybe two morons.  In this one the only one who wasn't a moron was Drake.  And I'd have to say that 'Frost' from the first one seemed more challenging for Blade than Drake did.  And I'm sorry, I don't care if he was supposed to be the 'First' vampire, he shouldn't have been immune to sunlight.  And since when can vampires shapeshift??

I did love the vampire dogs and Ryan Renolds and Jessica Biel were a great addition.  I love the sceens with them.

Hey, can anyone tell me what happened between Blade 2 and this 'movie' that caused Blade to talk/swear so much?  In the first two movies he always had these short 'clean' jabs that he would throw in.  More action and less talking.  In this movie he talked a lot more and was swearing!

This movie, however was unrealistic...I know---but for a vampire movie, it doesn't make sense. The actor (Dominic Purcell) does not fill the bigger than life shoes of ""Drake"", or Dracula--the first vampire (No matter how attractive he is). The fight scenes are decent, but it's sad that Stephen Dorff's character ""Deacon Frost"" in the first Blade had more of a presence (and much better fight scenes) than Dracula---I repeat the FIRST vampire. The best part of the movie is Ryan Renolds and Jessica Biel, whose strong support characters make the film worth not walking out.

My favorite part of this movie was the dark humor and Ryan Reynolds does a great job of lining up the comedy!  Jessica Beil and even Wesley Snipes give into the comedy in this movie.

It's a sure treat for Ryan Reynolds fans to see him all buffed up more than Brad Pitt did for Troy. He plays the side-kick to Snipes and he must have trained for 6 months to transformed his not so muscular body for the role of Hannibal King, and with full facial hair he looked totally different from his previous films. Too bad he lacked real martial arts training that his fight scenes were rather mediocre compared to Snipes or Jessica Biel even.

Parker Possey is the bad girl vampire who woke up the great vampire played by the ultra-hunky Dominic Purcell, who walked on the street like he was doing a runway show in Milan. He's the most powerful vampire of all.

Kris Kristofferson died in the scene when a troop of police invaded his place. Biel(KK's daughter) and Reynolds showed up to help Snipes fight the Purcell. Natasha Lyonne, a blind scientist had done an experiment and figured out the way to destroy the vampires. Even she got killed by Purcell, but she managed to record her last message to tell Snipes how to use her formulated chemical to inject into Purcell's body, and all the vampires will die...

Dracula was also disappointing and the only power he really had was to walk in the daylight and change into human form. You would think Dracula the very first vampire of its kind would have a little bit more to offer us- he doesn't.

2245563,3,B0007V6ITE,"Granted no matter what you do in a sequel REAL FANS will have issues with something that is done that seems kinda out of line. (See The Matrix Reloaded, Revoloutions, Aliens 1 thru 4) Here are the problems I had with Trinity,

1. In the first two it seems that Blade actually listened to Whistler and the advise he was trying to give, in this one it seemed that he disregarded him and was going to do things his way no matter what.

2. When Blade hid out to recharge, make plans or reload, it seemed that he had more security in place (Especially in Blade 2 although that was compromised by Scud) in this one there is virtually none. Too many entry points from too many angles and it seems as though Blade felt it coming but did nothing. This allowed just him and Wistler to fight too many police and thus Whistler getting killed. (Or did he? Blade was just told he died but he could have gotten out of the building before it went up. Blade 4 anyone)

3. Drake or Dracula The original Vampire.  Now to me Deacon Frost and Nomak gave Blade better fights (Especially Nomak) than this supossed Original Vampire does.  When in orginal form he looks very menacing and virtually unstopable so I thought he was really gonna whoop on blade or him and the NightStalkers where going to have to have a real big plan for him. Maybe activating a few more sleeper cells to help them? To me he just was not tough enough to be the King of them all.  He seemed only to be part of the crew with Danica and the rest not their original king. See: Underworld on how they treated their Lord of Vampires.  Considering he could kill them all at his whim you think they would have treated him differently.

4. The Night Stalkers. While The BloodPack would have whupped their asses, they were also a letdown compared to the BloodPack in KickAss ready to fight attitude.  The humor was kinda funny but seemed out of place. The security at their hideout was lacking also thus Drake easily eliminating the people working with them. And those people were kinda wimpy too! King and Whistler were pretty good (fighting wise) but you wonder how King went down and acted like such a wimp from being stuck with the silver by Drake but could take such a beating from Grimwood and only be staggered.

5. The Vampire Virus.  I am not sure that this killed all the vampires everwhere thus having the series end. Although with the idea of biological weapons being at the forefront of news nowadays it was not a bad idea.

I am not sure what kind of story they could come up with for a 4th one but I hope they give it to another director (Peter King LOTR or Tim Burton)and maybe we could get a better or more viewable storyline.

2245566,3,B0007V6ITE,"""Blade"" was a classic. ""Blade II"" was an great sequel and a great stand alone film. ""Blade Trinity"" was good. Not great but not as sharp as part I or as stylish as part II. I loved the Nightstalkers. I'm sorry Whistler had to die but he went honorably. Action was great. The soundtrack is on my wishlist.

My biggest gripe is the casting. I have seen many incarnations of the great Dracula. I figured Blade's version would be as slick and deadly as Blade's previous movie foes. Imagine my disgust at seeing some Armani model strutting down the street like the band was playing ""I'm Too Sexy"" behind him. Dracula was too pretty and too pretty did not work. The only time Mr. Drac was truly ghastly was when he morphed into his ""bat monster"" form. Then there was Parker Posey who was much scarier in ""Josie & The Pussycats"" than as the gangleader who digs up the runway master of the undead. I couldn't take her her seriously even when she was being sinister.

I think they should've axed Dracula or put more emphasis on Blade's new public image as a human killer. The cops chasing the hero gave the film much needed edge was an echo of the great plots from I & II.

So it was good but I heard this was the last of the trilogy. Hopefully, Wesley and Co. will try to make a better attempt at a grand finale. However, if this is where the series is headed maybe it's best to stop here before the franchise goes the way of a certain ""Caped Crusader"".",1103760000,2,1445,4.305147058823529

The story was a little far fetched, awakening Dracula to fight Blade and use his superior DNA to determine the key to daywalking. I guess this is the way for the movie to tie into the Tomb of Dracula comics in which Blade appears.

Things I didn't like about this film: Whistler dies too quickly. The poor comedy/humour scenes of Hannibal King, a former vampire who adds too much silly comedy relief to what is supposed to be an action film. Scenes that have no bearing in the story (eg. warehouse blood processing facilty).

Perhaps it's because of their unashamedly R-rated blood and guts nature.  Or maybe its because Blade isn't exactly a household name in the lexicon of Marvel heroes.

Admittedly, more than a few comic book fans were skeptical when word got out that the first Blade film was in production back in the late 90s.  Blade was at that time, a C-list character at best, one so far in the rear with the gear he didn't even show up on a typical organizational chart of the Marvel Universe.  Many doubtless wondered why Marvel Studios, which at that time had yet to prove it could do credible big screen versions of its heroes, had picked a relatively unknown character for its first real stab at movie success.

But then movie came out and it rocked.  As helmed by David Goyer and produced by star Wesley Snipes, the film was stylish, action-packed, smartly-written, and kicked ass.  It not only paved the way for big screen versions of Spidey and Marvel's mighty mutants but also influenced a new generation of action films including a little flick called ""The Matrix.""  ""Blade II"", directed by Guillermo Del Toro, was even better.

Goyer returned to direct ""Blade - Trinity"" but it's been interesting to note that this film has sharply divided fans.  Most that I've talked to either hated or loved it.

I loved it.  Yes, the film isn't as good as the last one but the reality is ""Blade - Trinity"" proves this series hasn't been drained of fresh ideas.  In many respects, the film is a return to basics.  While ""Blade II""'s Reaper storyline took us deeper into the vampire world by forcing an uneasy truce between Blade's posse and the ruling bloodsucker clan, Trinity, has our hero back to strictly slaying vampire ass.

This time he has some new partners to work with:  Hannibal King, a wise-cracking former vampire, and Abigail Whistler, the out-of-wedlock daughter of Blade's longtime mentor.  As played by Ryan Reynolds and Jessica Biel, both are outstanding.

If there's one flaw with ""Blade - Trinity"" it lies in the film's villain.  Every great hero needs an antagonist to struggle against.  The first film's Deacon Frost was a perfect opponent.  Blade II offered not only the dark elements of the ruling vampire clan but also the hideous mutant vampires, the Reapers, as well.

In ""Blade - Trinity"" we get Dracula himself (or Drake as he is called here) who has been revived after a centuries long sleep by a group of modern vampires who see him as the the key to becoming daywalkers and taking over the world.  This should be our hero's ultimate challenge but the problem is the movie doesn't do a whole lot with Drake.  Most of the time, he behaves more like a henchman to the vampire gang than like a ruler returning to reclaim his throne.

Standing out among the mod vamps is Indie film queen, Parker Posey, who has a hambone ball playing the leader of this crew.  Posey clearly enjoyed sinking her fangs into a more commercial, action-oriented role and she's fun to watch.  I wish I could say the same about Drake but the bottom line is that he's a bit of a bore and final showdown between him and Blade is a letdown.

Nevertheless, I still recommend the film to action fans and fans of the first and second Blade films.  Admittedly, the film isn't as strong as its predecessors but the reality is that not all third installments in a franchise can be a ""The Lord of the Rings:  The Return of the King.""  ""Trinity"" ultimately is to this series what ""The Return of the Jedi"" was to the first set of Star Wars films i.e. a very good third movie that unfortunately comes on the heels of a great first film and a sequel that was a masterpiece.

If judged purely on its own merits rather than compared to the first two films, you can enjoy it for what is:  a fun action movie worth sinking your fangs into.",1103500800,,3923,4.57163323782235
2245569,1,B0007V6ITE,"This movie is horrible. I almost got up and left. The franchise has jumped the shark. How could they go from the great high of Blade I to this?

2245570,4,B0007V6ITE,"When I first heard that ""Trinity"" was on the way, I had my reservations about it.  I was worried that the film would become cluttered with heroes, what with Blade and Whistler fighting necksuckers, and now Hannibal King and Abigail Whistler thrown into the fray.  Somehow, a balance is found between the heroes that keeps all of them out of each others way.

The plot is reflective of the other films in that once again the vampires are looking for a way to become daywalkers.  Instead of calling up a vampire god or creating a mutant race though, they decide to go to the source of their ""virus""--Dracula.  Hoping to use his blood to make them perfect immortal beings and eventually herd humans like livestock to feed them, a group of vampires seeks out and revive the dark prince.  He looks like something from a GWAR concert, then morphs into this medieval looking guy.  Dominic Purcell portrays him, and does a better-than-average job.  Parker Posey plays a vamp who is very over-the-top.  At first, I didn't think she'd work in this picture, but she does a really good job.  WWE fans were happy to see Triple H get his chance to flesh out a vampire with silver caps on his teeth.  His character is like the schoolyard bully of the bunch.  He's big and bad, but has a soft spot for Pomeranian dogs.  The rest of the vampires are pretty stock as far as modern vampires go.  They somehow all know martial arts, are unusually good at science, and enjoy techno music.

Wesley Snipes looks very comfortable in his role as Blade.  His character has lightened up a bit as far as humor goes, but he's still one bad mama-jama.  Kris Kristofferson looks comfortable as the tough old fart/father-figure Whistler.  Jessica Biel was very good as Whistler's daughter, Abigail.  Of all the characters, she seems to be the one person you'd least expect to play a butt-kicker, but she pulls it off in grand style.  Ryan Reynolds plays Hannibal King, a smarty pants vampire hunter who was once one of them.  His one-liners are hilarious most of the time, but he gets pretty annoying during parts of the film.  His humor was probably highlighted a little more than the average ""Blade"" audience member goes for, but I think he did a pretty decent job.  The rest of Abigail and Hannibal's group, the Nightstalkers, features a pretty stock bunch of characters who are really only here to provide weapons and victims for the film.

The action is much better than in the second film.  There is very little evidence of CGI tampering in the fight sequences this time around.  The majority of the action is shot up-close and personal.  Blade, as usual, has that strike-a-pose mentality about him and has some very good-looking moves in this film.  Hannibal is mainly a gunslinger.  Abigail favors a bow and her boots when it comes to killing vampires.

Of course, no ""Blade"" film would be proper without some techno music.  This time around the music has a little nu metal flavor to it and more of a gangsta feel than the other two films.  The music should be considered a major character, since it moves the entire movie at a swift pace.  Of all of the films, I believe that ""Trinity"" has the best soundtrack.

I've heard that this film would be the final installment in the ""Blade"" series.  That's probably a good idea since it looks like the vampires are starting to run out of options to become daywalkers.  I've also heard that this movie is going to be used as a springboard for the characters of Hannibal King and Abigail Whistler.  Much like the Elektra character in ""Daredevil,""  I'm sure that this duo can pull off a film on their own.  I don't think they will have the drawing power of ""Blade,"" but there is an audience out there for them.

One other note, this is the first ""Blade"" film to feature the easily recognized Marvel tagline at the beginning of the film.  It's nice to see that Avi Arad and Stan Lee are finally giving a little more respect to this series, since it seems to have done pretty well without them the first two times around.

Well, I recommend this flick to fans of the first two films and folks who liked ""Daredevil"" and ""Punisher.""  Also, if you like brooding heroes or action flicks like ""Resident Evil:  Apocalypse,"" I'm sure you'll enjoy this film.  Children should not see this movie.  It isn't so much that it is scary, but f-bombs drop left and right in this flick.  The signature burn-up of vampires is also here, so that might be a little disturbing for some kiddies.  The R-rating is well deserved due to the excessive foul language(more than the first two films) and the obvious vioent aspect of the film.  That's just something to keep in mind if you're turned off by cursing.  I get pretty tired of it in a film if it seems to be put in just to have the character come across as tougher or meaner.

Hope you enjoy this movie, it's a fine addition to the ""Blade"" saga.",1103241600,147,4893,4.553899082568807
2245571,4,B0007V6ITE,"Where to begin... First let us acknowledge the inherent badness of these Blade movies. Next, lets allow the guilty pleasure that all 3 leave us feeling. Entertainment and bad-ass quality alone make them worth watching. (Plus, you know, vampires are hot.)

The third installment of David Goyer's Blade films is by far the most comical film as it obviously strives to reach a broader audience. Wesley Snipes was classis as the vampire slaying lone wolf.  Jessica Biel -conveniently Whistler's out of wedlock daughter- genuinely surprised me by not making me hate her. Ryan Reynolds- who will from now on be referred to as the Jar-Jar Binks of the Blade trilogy- proved Van Wilder should never be allowed to make action flicks. He couldn't defeat any opponent and made childish one liners most of the time he was on screen, when he wasn't obnoxiously swearing of course. Kris Kristofferson returned as the man who wouldn't die... I wonder if he'll be back for the fourth? Parker Posey was a good but over-the-top-she-villain-.... I wish she had taken her character somewhere. The Dracula character was dissapointing and kid've random actually...

You don't need to have seen the first two to understand/enjoy this flick. Plot doesn't seem as important to Goyer when he's directing it seems... perhaps he should have brought back Guillermo Del Toro who did a great job with 2... It felt like he wrote a basic outline for Snipe's character, then brought in some writers from... American Pie. To sum it up- there's a vampiric pomeranian who belongs to Vampire Triple H- you know- the wrestler.

This movie is packed full of funny, but out of place moments and lines. And whats the deal with the Ipod? If I were off to fight vampires, I think I'd want all my senses available to me- particularly SOUND.

This is half of a great movie. Not as good as the first two, less action sequences, weaker plot, iffy actors, and a first time director.

2245574,4,B0007V6ITE,"I didn't have high hopes for Blade: Trinity.

I loved the original Blade movie.  It was innovative, stylish, and had an African-American half-vampire who took himself seriously.  It was a serious comic book movie with an urban style about it.  Watching it a few years later, the movie still holds up well.  And the soundtrack really kicked it into high gear.

Blade II was an embarrassment.  It had bad special effects (yes, I can tell when ninjas are entirely computer graphics), a lame rip-off of an Aliens plot, it killed off and then brought back a major character (BOO!), and most unforgivable of all...had wrestling moves.

Let me say that again: WRESTLING.  MOVES.

The last time I saw a movie seriously incorporate wrestling moves into a film, it was Rowdy Roddy Piper spending way too much time pile driving the bad guy in They Live.  It was ridiculous, but we expected nothing less from Roddy, 'cause, ya know, he's a wrestler.

When a villain climbs a sheer wall just to do a flying elbow to the throat of the hero, you can tell the director thinks his audience is made up of ten-year olds, confusing ""comic book"" with ""kiddie fare.""  Thank you, Mr. Goyer, for giving Blade back his dignity.  Of course, I just checked the Internet Movie Database and it looks like Goyer wrote the second movie too...

Anyway, Blade: Trinity injects a healthy dose of modern day skepticism into Blade's (Wesley Snipes) vampire hunting activities.  When the vampires can't deal with Blade by killing him outright, they finally decide to manipulate the FBI and the news media by having one of their cronies sacrifice his life.  In essence, Blade is tricked into killing a real human.

The result: he is treated like a serial killer by the public and by government agencies.  But the vampires own them too, so it's not long before Blade is in seriously dire straits.

That's where the Nightstalkers come in, consisting primarily (but not exclusively) of Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds) and Abigail Whistler (Jessica Biel).  Reynolds is like a buffed up version of Jason Lee.  He's funny, he's insecure, and he just won't shut up.  Biel, who has always had an unearthly, elfin appearance, plays a wildcat that enjoys unleashing her inner rage on vampires while she listens to her iPod.

Snipes plays the straight man in this film, which is just as well, because Biel pouts in the background while Reynolds has a manic energy that steals every scene. By far the best acting kudos must go to the iPod, which is a major character unto itself.  It provides various soundtracks, it dutifully stays out of sight when Abigail puts the ear buds in her ears (she listens to music while she kills vampires, ya see), and it gets way more camera time than any MP3 player should.

The music is perfectly pitched, harkening back to the original movie's dance club beats.  The director has fun with the movie by adding little touches, like advertising a future human crony of the vampires (a ""familiar"") by flashing his wrist tattoo on screen for just a second.  There's a great scene where our heroes run through a mall, and the relentless pounding beat is replaced by...Muzak. And of course, whenever Blade jumps ten stories out of a building, he hits the ground so hard that car alarms go off.

But there is a big, ugly flaw in this movie.

It isn't Danica Talos (Parker Posy), who plays her Acid Princess role to the hilt, complete with having difficulty talking around her fangs and wobbling in her high heels.

It isn't Jarko Grimwood (Paul Michael Levesque), a wrestler of all things, who is actually appropriately menacing, stupid, cowardly, and violent.

It's Dracula.  Oh, I'm sorry.  In this movie they call him Drake (Dominic Purcell).

The movie takes great pains to separate itself from the image of Dracula, but by doing so robs itself of the entire point of having Dracula in a movie-so you know all about the original Hollywood vampire.

Purcell is a monster all right, in a smarmy Euro-trash sort of way.  His penetrating gaze and his massive neck are entirely out of place with the ancestral being he's supposed to be.  Purcell can't pull off the long dialogue scenes he has with Blade convincingly.  Drake speaks in slow, menacing tones and he really hates the commercialization of Dracula.  Which is ironic, because Dracula would probably really hate his portrayal in this movie.

By the end of the film, the climactic battle looks and feels a lot like Highlander than a vampire movie.  We needed an elegant yet malevolent villain, not an overbearing thug-that's what Levesque is for.

Lurking somewhere in the background is a lame plot about a genetic virus that will kill all vampires ""in the vicinity.""  And a little girl and a cute baby are endangered.  And Danica and Hannibal have this hate/hate thing going back when he was a vampire. It's complicated.

And yet, I really enjoyed this movie.  I laughed at most of King's lines.  Even when his jokes fall flat, King knows they fall flat, and adds such self-effacing humor as, ""I'm sorry, I had a lot of sugar today"" or ""he doesn't like me very much.""

Ultimately, the real joke here is that very concept of vampires is ridiculous.  Every vampire looks like a refugee from Stick Model Camp and acts like it, rolling their eyes, harrumphing in their pretty vampire way, or flexing and snarling at just the right moments.  How can we possibly take them seriously?  They're like, one step above zombies for sheer comedy!

Of course, the subtle humor will not sit well with vampire fans that think vampires should be cool.  The movie comes down pretty firmly on the side of the good guys: the good guys look cool and the vampires look like bumbling idiots.  Let there be no doubt, Goyer's having some fun at his own expense and mocking the vampire genre.

I mean, seriously, this movie has vampire dogs.

For that alone, it gets four stars.",1102982400,100,5885,4.731563421828908
2245575,1,B0007V6ITE,"This is ridiculious it just seemed like New Line just wanted to complete the trilogy and rushed something out. ""Goyer"" is a very poor director. He has no sense of what vampire atmosphere is all about. This movie and all the characters were quite contrived compared to Blade II. There were no attractive people in the movie except for ""Whislers Daughter"" for eye relief. And I thought that is what vampires were all about attractiveness and temptation? The movie took place mostly in Daylight which made it completley non atomospheic. There was no horror or fear what so ever about the film. This was a fiasco as far as I am concerned. And the ancient god ""Dracula"" which was called ""Drake"" looked like a greek bodybuilder. His acting skills were plain uproarious & cheesy! There was no horror or convincing anyone he was from ancient times with that costume! ""Drake"" was supposed to be the strongest and most powerful but got his ass kicked so easily! ""Toro"" Blade II director was much better in his vision for the Blade series. I thought 2 showed promise and delivered colorful scenes with action and horror well blended. Why? they didn't let him direct Trinity I don't know. This movie looks straight to video and shows no evolution for the series. Blade I was a decent action movie for the time it came out. There was know sense in trying to go back to that formula. That is what it seemed like they were trying to do but did worse. Trinity delivers nothing but a cheap, straight to video 90's movie feel.

2245576,2,B0007V6ITE,"Blade was one of the first among many vampire movies to make being a vampire a cool and great thing. It wasn't a life of loniliness and depression but a life of immortality and dressing cool. While nowhere near its predecessor Blade 2 still had moments that had the first's magic. Blade : Trinity however with a new director and new set of cast is a mess from start to finish.

First the cast, Ryan Reynolds to whom everyone knows from Van Wilder joins the cast. I don't mind comedic commentary but this was more Van Wilder meets Blade than it was a Blade sequel. Not one second did you take this character seriously even in his subtle moments. Jessica Biel plays Whistler's daughter and does a pretty decent job but her character never gets to shine. It was a very bland character to begin with. The one thing Blade always had was great villians with their devilish look and nasty actions. This movie's villian is a huge letdown from the previous two never once provoking the idea that this guy was gonna be rough to beat.

Now, onto the story, I will say this there are highlights in this plot that had great ideas but would quickly end. The idea of plotting the media and humans in general against Blade was great but they never followed through. This lasted 15 minutes with a huge FBI break in, but after this we didn't see any cops. Also, the idea of harvesting homeless as their new source for food, BRILLIANT! but 2 minutes in Blade pulls the plug and boom their done. The action scenes were weak, never once having you in awe. I kinda wish they just would've used CGI because at least that would've been entertaining. The final battle seemed tame compared to the first two movies' finales which were hugely climatic.

Overall, I was very dissappointed with the result of the new Blade movie. The writer and director who took Del Toro's place had some good ideas and some bad ones and forgot the principle idea in vampire movies. That simple fact is vampire are stronger and more deadly than us so just how do a WB family drama star and a National Lampoon star kick all this vampire's @sses?",1102982400,3,2098,4.486910994764398

With the exception of ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy I must say that ""Blade"" is one of the best franchises around, and ""Blade Trinity"" puts the icing on the cake.

Wesley Snipes is back as the day-walker, and he's better than ever. Only this time, the ""NightStalkers"" get thrown into the mix, and quite brilliantly I might add. However, let me just take a second to talk about Jessica Biel. This girl totally kicked @ss, and her body looked hard as a rock. I love to see women who can throw down with the men, and I must say that Jessica was AWESOME! so Jennifer Garner better watch out. One thing that really bugs me is to sit through a movie, and have absolutely nothing happen until 35 or 45 minutes into the movie, but this movie was exactly the opposite because I was entertained from start to finish. On a personal note, I am a die hard wrestling fan so, I was definitely interested in seeing how Triple H would do in his first film, and I must say that even he surprised me. I really didn't expect him to be apart of the film for real because they really have a habit of hyping up a character's role with the promotions, and then disappoint you when you actually see the movie and find out that person's role wasn't what they hyped it up to be.

Generally, Blade 3 is a pretty good movie, despite its flaws. Loosely based on ""Nightstalkers"", the old Marvel Comic, Blade:Trinity has some good action scenes (the one in the beginning, the subway scene are two), it does have some gory parts (no where near as many as the first two films) and the supporting cast did a good job. I especially liked the one-liners of the Hannibal King character.

The film could have been better - the producers could have picked a better director who knows how to film fight scenes and used better judgement editing this film. Blade 3 is very choppy and is not as smooth as the first 2 films. It jumps from scene to scene - I am hoping the DVD will include all the footage that would have tied some of these scenes together.

Blade hooks up with some vampire hunters that count among their number Whister's  daughter.

The movie is not boring (like I'm making it sound)

2245583,4,B0007V6ITE,"BLADE: TRINITY was to be the last chapter in a trilogy of movies based off the Marvel comics. After assisting the nightwalkers eradicate a breed of mutant vampires, Blade (Wesley Snipes) has returned to hunting vampires. Everything has the feel that the endgame has begin and that very soon either Blade or the vampires will win the war.

The movie begins with a group of vampires entering an ancient temple ruins in Iraq. At first it isn't revealed what they are seeking, but the audience is later told that they are seeking a being that will purify their bloodline and allow them to walk in sunlight. Mixed in with this is a weird plot stolen straight from the television movie ""V"" (or any other number of classic sci-fi movies). Then there's the fact that not only are the vampires hunting for Blade, but the FBI is after his tale as well. The feds are convinced Blade is the sickest psychopath of all times and they want him sent to a plastic jail somewhere and given a lobotomy. Things don't look too good for Blade until a handful of young vampire hunters called the Nightstalkers show up and show him that the war isn't his alone to fight.

BLADE: TRINITY should have been a kick-buck conclusion to this trilogy. However, it doesn't come close to being the great action film it could have been. To begin with, Dracula is in this movie. This isn't some lame Dracula that appears on a box of cereal. The Dracula in this movie is presented as being the originator and father of all vampires, born into being probably by some demon birth. He's a great warrior from the past who sealed himself away because the world no longer held in honor worth killing, dying, or living for. This take on the series should have had this grand vampire army hunting down Blade and his allies in an all out battle somewhere outside of the city. Instead, we are once again given a lackluster confrontation in the middle of some obscure city highrise.

The acting isn't all that bad. Snipes is the perfect Blade and has the cool down pat. Jessica Biel is a fairly talented actor and her appearance makes any film a notch higher. HHH of wrestling fame has a large secondary part and does a better job than many other wrestlers who have tried to enter the Hollywood business. Parky Posey is a vampire queen-wannabe and like many of the films Posey acts in, she is as slutty as ever. Then there's Ryan Reynolds--his character saves the movie in so many different parts. He's got some of the best lines. Yet, nothing against the guy personally, but in the movie he sounds exactly like Jason Lee--not only is his delivery similar, but his voice and mannerism are identical. I was thinking to myself, why didn't they just cast Jason Lee if all they wanted was a Jason Lee clone? Also, though the movie is supposed to be the conclusion of a trilogy, it's ambiguous enough at the very end to make one wonder if there will be more, perhaps a Blade crossover or maybe a film where Blade hunts werewolves or something. Whatever the case, the movie does suffer from some awkward editing and lacks some spunk in the plot department. Nevertheless, it is entertaining and does a decent job of what should be the conclusion of the series.",1102809600,,3205,4.560763888888889
2245584,5,B0007V6ITE,"From having seen the first two Blade films and loved them, I was dying for the next installment of the franchise to hit theaters. However, once Trinity came out, it got many bad reviews from critics and moviegoers alike. Nevertheless, I decided to go anyways and came out of the theater more than pleased. This movie was definitely the best of the three so I don't know what these other people are smoking. First of all, the plot was great and staying true to formula, very unique from the other two movies.  To try to put it briefly, the vampires who are continually trying to rid their kind of any heredity weaknesses, hunt for the progenitor of the vampire race whose DNA could make them all perfect bloodsuckers; Dracula. In another unique twist, the vampires set up Blade by getting him to kill one of their familiars and making him FBI's most wanted. A huge battle ensues and Blade is arrested. So who's gonna help him out? Enter the Nightstalkers, Abigail Whistler (Jessica Biel) and Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds). Both Biel and Reynolds pass as legitamite asskickers right alongside Snipes and bring their own unique touch to movie. Biel brings the sexuality and Reynolds brings the side-splitting comedy. And of course, there's tons of action in this movie! A huge shootout, a car chase, and a kick ass swordfight among other things. In short, throw out any preconceived notions you have about Blade Trinity and go see it for yourself. You won't be disappointed!!!",1102809600,,1473,4.799212598425197
2245585,1,B0007V6ITE,"After two very successful and entertaining films here comes Blade Trinity.
The big failure and embarrassment of the Blade franchise.
Blade deals with vampires but yet this movie is neither scary nor suspenseful.
There is really no gore and not much blood.
No disturbing images or frightening scences.
Blade 1 and 2 had some of these qualities and Blade Trinity was supposed to expand on these elements making it a better film than the previous.
The feel and the way this movie was put together were totally different from the other films.
I have been waiting 2 years for this movie and what I saw was very disappointing.
The fight scences were lame and lacked the force and intensity of the first 2 films.
There was no big opening and ending (like Blade & Blade 2) scenes filled with great fight action.
They said Blade needed help to defeat Dracula but Blade kicked his tail very quick and easily. (Making for one of the bigger let downs of this movie.)
Dracula was not even a bigger challenge for Blade than Frost (from Blade I).
Where is the great big brutal final battle everyone was expecting like Blade Vs. Nomak in Blade 2.
Another thing greatly wrong with this movie is the stupid dialogue and dry humor.
The movie was going nowhere with this.
I guess they wanted back and forth wise cracks and humor for this film like Blade and Reinhart did in Blade 2.
The problem with that is Wesley Snipes (Blade) & Ron Pearlman (Reinhart) had better chemistry with each other.
In Blade Trinity the chemistry was simply not there.
Hannibal (Reynolds) wise cracks throughout the film are okay at first then start to get old really quick.
It goes from dumb to stupid to shut the [...] up the movie.
Blade said coochie coo when he had a baby in his hand.
What the hell was that?
This movie took the Blade franchise in the complete wrong direction.
I cannot believe that I have to say that Spiderman 2 is a better movie than Blade Trinity.
What went wrong?
Who is responsible for this?
I know that they have to make up for this bad film by making Blade 4.
It is no longer a question it is mandatory.
The Blade franchise should not end on such a horrible note.
Look what happened to the Batman Franchise.
Is that the direction that the Blade franchise is heading for? (First 2 movies good and all the rest sucks)
We the fans expected more and deserved more.
We have supported the films from the beginning and this is how they pay us back.
Now I know why Wesley Snipes was so negative in the press about the direction of this film months before it came out.",1102809600,4,2547,4.45610278372591
2245586,4,B0007V6ITE,"For everything Blade: Trinity does wrong, it does more right, and it provides a satisfying end to the Blade film series while leaving the door open for a Nightstalkers spin off.  Wesley Snipes reprises his role as the half human, half vampire daywalker, as he and Whistler (Kris Kristofferson) find themselves hunted down by the police and the FBI when Blade accidently kills a familiar, while the vampire community readies their ""final solution"" with the resurrection of the original vamp, Dracula himself (Dominic Purcell).  A team of vampire hunters called the Nightstalkers, led by Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds) and Whistler's daughter Abigail (Jessica Biel) end up teaming up with Blade in his final bloody showdown with the vamps.  Nowhere as spectacular as the first two films in the series, Blade: Trinity's main flaw is it's editing style and writer/director David S. Goyer's script.  Goyer, who wrote the first two films along with the upcoming Batman Begins, has a script with plenty of plot holes and some cheesy dialogue, and it seems he was more preoccupied with Warner Bros. upcoming blockbuster than with this film to give it his all.  The vampire dogs were ridiculous, but the comic relief of Reynolds' King actually made the scene worthwhile.  Biel's acting isn't anything special as usual, but her fight scenes were well coreographed (along with the shameless promotion of the iPod featured in her scenes).  Dracula/Drake is a disappointment as well, but the final fight between him and Blade is worth the price of admission.  Other than that, Blade: Trinity is a more than solid comic to film adaptation that's better than the Punisher and Daredevil (and probably the upcoming Elektra movie) and while it's disappointing when compared to the first two films, it's still a wild ride.  Also starring Parker Posey, Natasha Lyone, Patton Oswalt, James Remar, Eric Bogosian, and pro wrestling star Triple H.",1102809600,,1922,5.115015974440895

It's about time Blade got to face Dracula, even if they had to call him Drake.  (I still believe he was renamed for the film to avoid confusion with all the other Draculas out there.) I've been a Marvel comics fan for years, and have been very pleased with all three of these movies.  Pac-man was a nice little bonus.  Loved Hannibal King's humor, and Abby was such a bad-ass that she made a great compliment to Blade.  A lot of people are saying Blade seems tired in this movie, but think about what he says.  He tells the police he has killed more than 1,000 familiars.  Familiars!  That's not vampires, sweetness.  All those of you who say this film was bad or tired, or had anything negative to say, I have 2 things to say.  One, it exceeded every expectation of this Marvel comics/vampire fan, and Two, reread Hannibal King's name tag.  I'm only sorry the series is over now.",1102723200,,1009,4.370967741935484

Personally i think the whole trilogy was good but this ending certainly was missing something. For one the villan Dracula, Drake which ever of his many names you wanna call him just wasn't scary enough and didn't put up much of a fight. I mean this is their best the first of  all his kind and went into a fight  with very little vampire heart. The villans in blades past  seem to have been alot better than their vampire king and you could tell they really wanted to get what they wanted but this guy wasn't horrible but didn't show to much love for the cause. Overall this movie is OK because of the acting,comedy and well done martial arts and if your wondering how Jessica biel did in this she did really good and for the wrestling fans Tripple H did OK too actually a lot better than I thought. This movie was good but it could of been better a lot better and I hope the director is just trying to fool us and this isn't really the end because their going to have to do a lot better than this to satisfy blade fans.

2245589,3,B0007V6ITE,"Aside from some of Ryan Renolyds' (Hannibal King's) hilarious dialog and the good soundtrack, I found this movie to be rather tedious. The fight choreography in particular was rather uninspiring. Although I liked Dominic Purcell in the lead role of the long-canceled ""John Doe"" TV series, he ends up playing one of the lamest Draculas in movie history. I don't blame this on his acting but on the writing instead. Otherwise, the look of the film, including the special effects and costuming, and the acting were adequate.",1102723200,,521,5.0
2245590,4,B0007V6ITE,"Beggining with a sense of strong urgency, Blade: Trinity begins the daunting task of living up to the first two movies by taking a gamble and bringing in Dracula, (or ""Drach"") the latest incarnation of THE Vampire movie villain, to face off against Blade, who this time, has two new allies in his battles: The Nightstalkers, one of whom steals the film with his hilariously vulger jokes during key scenes.

Blade plays the veteran, the mentor, the guy who has done it all, the Nightstalkers treat him like royalty and kiss his butt, and for good reason, this takes away conflict within the group, but maybye that's why doing something different always works out for the better.

The twists and turns rapidly spring on us, you have shocking deaths, the ultimate surrender, in actions, of some aspects of Humanity to the Vampire cause (Familiars, the Human preservation plant etc)

Whilst the use of Dracula is at times...limited. the remaining Vampire forces in this film are also flypaper, sticking to scenes without much contribution, only former World Champion Triple H is given any degree of deapth as the dog adoring Jaws-rip off flunkie.

The fight scenes are as brilliantly directed as ever, nhotibly the car chase at the beggining of the film, and Blade's fateful battle with Dracula, the music flows well with the action, and yes, whilst product placment is as obvious here as it is in ANYTHING ELSE you watch, it doesn't serve as a distraction.

Blade: Trinity is a worthy conclusion for the Blade tirlogy, giving us new insight into Blade's character, shows us what dark possibilites he might very well face now that the film series has concluded, gives us humour, gives us action...gives us a COMIC BOOK MOVIE what else could you want?",1102723200,,1746,4.865319865319865
2245591,4,B0007V6ITE,"When Blade first debut it was a sudden slap in the face to the movie public.  First it was a comic book movie that was not only good, but with an R rating, and was good.  The story of Blades endless fight against the udead had not only a good story that not only mixed action with Drama, but kept it so that the audience of all tastes would love it.  Number 2 came out and focused more on action and a little more on the Horror side of things.  Now comes the third which in some ways reverts to the style of the first.

The story here is that Blade has been framed for the murder of a familiar.  The FBI raids his home and kills Whistler.  Meanwhile the Vampires have ressurected the Ultimate Vampire Drake aka Dracula.  With this new powerful threat out there Blade must teamup with the Nightstalkers, a rag tag group of Vampire hunters who Whistler was associated with.

This movie mixes plenty of stylized action with some Drama as the Nightstalkers learn that by waging a war against the Vampires they leave themselves open to attack at any moment.

In fact the only problems I found at times was that some of the acting was somewhat poor.  The main female Vampire didn't seem that menacing and just came off as B****y.  The whole Blade getting framed bit was an interesting idea but ultimatly was forgotten about after the first 30 minutes or so.  Also Ryan Reeds character Hannibal King wound up using to many one liners that it detracted from the mood of the film.  However the action remaind a fairly constant and in the end I did enjoy it quite a bit.  So overall I recomend going to see this, one way or another.",1102636800,,1622,4.342192691029901

Even my 23 year old sister liked it and she only likes realsitc movies. I wouldn't say it was the best Blade movie in the series(I'd say it was the second best in the series), but still a brilliant movie! 1. Blade 2. Blade Trinity

3. Blade 2",1102636800,,382,4.305555555555555
2245593,2,B0007V6ITE,"Maybe Wesley Snipes is getting tired of playing the lugubrious vampire slayer. Or maybe, after three movies, screenwriter David S. Goyer is getting bored writing the humorless lead character. This would explain why, in Blade Trinity, vampire turned good guy Hannibal King gets all the good lines.

Hannibal's potty-mouthed sense of humor seems imported from a Kevin Smith movie and Blade is reduced to his straight man. Trinity feels like an attempt by Goyer to set-up a new franchise starring the Nightstalkers, a group of anti-vampire young guns lead by Hannibal (Ryan Reynolds) and Abigail Whistler (Jessica Biel), the daughter of Blade's mentor.

In the first two films of the series, Blade was a seamless combination of the 70's blaxploitation movie cool of John Shaft and the violent edge of Japanese anime's Vampire Hunter D. Now, with the Nightstalkers in tow, Blade comes off like a grumpy old vampire slayer telling the kids to keep the racket down and get off his lawn. In one scene, he chastises the Nightstalkers, saying ""What do think this is? A game? Look at how you're dressed!"" Indeed, Hannibal and Abigail run around half naked, showing off chiseled abs and sinewy biceps. Meanwhile, Blade, bundled up for the winter in a leather trench coat, black vest and long-sleeved, red crew neck, looks like his mother dressed him. Of course, his mother was a vampire.

The plot of Trinity, such that there is one, has the Vampire Nation led by Danica Talons (the hilarious Parker Posey, in a film that probably cost more than the rest of her filmography combined) awakening the original Count Dracula to aid in their war against Blade. According to the movie, Dracula was born in ancient Samaria and has spent the past few generations slumbering in Iraq. Can someone please tell me then, why he comes out of his tomb looking like Nick Lachey from MTV's ""Newlyweds?""  And while I can accept that Dracula speaks perfect English, when he starts using phrases like ""parting gift"" I have to ask myself, has Dracula been watching The Game Show Network?

I have a great deal of affection for Blade II, which was directed by Guillermo Del Toro. Writer-director Goyer brings no visual style to the table and the cinematography makes the film look like a documentary shot on 16mm film in the mid seventies. The colors in the daylight exteriors are so washed out, they make Joe Carnahan's steely blue Narc look positively lush by comparison. And while we're on the subject of daylight exteriors, didn't Goyer get the memo that this is a vampire movie? I know that Blade is a ""day walker,"" but who wants to see the world's greatest vampire slayer chase the world's oldest vampire through an apartment building in the middle of the afternoon like Agent Smith and Neo in the first Matrix?

Ultimately, the mark of a good comic book movie is that it's entertaining enough to distract form the questions that would render a comic book movie implausible. For example: Abigail's habit of listening to her i-Pod while hunting vampires. At best, this is a riff on Gary Oldman's Beethoven loving sociopath in The Professional and at worst, it's blatant product placement. However, it begs the question: when hunting hoards of vampires, wouldn't you want your hearing unobstructed?

Also, for all the cash the Nightstalkers must spend on high-tech equipment, they spend an awful lot of time engaging the vampires in hand to hand combat. Since vampire disintegrate when pierced with silver, wouldn't a pair of silver, spiked boxing gloves save these guys a lot of energy? Maybe Blade should ditch the Nightstalkers and do a Marvel Team-Up with Wolverine?",1102636800,3,3640,4.9089430894308945
2245594,4,B0007V6ITE,"Those pesky vanpires are at it again in ""Blade: Trinity"".  This time they are trying to frame Blade (Snipes) for the murder of a human, as well as trying to resurrect an ancient enemy named Drake (Purcell).  The two schemes are related, and Blade soon finds himself alone and on the run until he meets up with Whistler's daughter Abigail (Biel) and a former vampire named Hannibal (Reynolds).  Together, they will try to stop the vampires once and for all.  But, their plan could also spell the end for Blade because of his mixed heritage.

""Blade: Trinity"", while entertaining, is certainly a step down after Guillermo Del Toro's ""Blade II"".  That movie was stylish and well made.  ""Trinity"" is filled with the choppy editing and loud music that has become popular in movies as of late.  And while Del Toro had established himself as a good director, Goyer is in the director's seat for the first time - and it shows.  Jessica Biel is good as the tough chick who enjoys hunting vampires, and Ryan Reynolds adds humor to the movie with almost everything he says and does.  Wesley Snipes slips easily back into the role of Blade, the vampire hunting bad-ass.  While not as good as ""II"", ""Trinity"" will appeal to fans of the series, or anyone who likes action movies.

Given it had a cheesey moment here and there, and the ending was a bit confusing for me would justify a 4 star rating. But, I still absolutely enjoyed it. The action was precise, loud, and in your face. Just the way it should be.

Now after reading all the reviews of you people totally picking this movie apart. Don't you have anything better to do? You just got to sit back, relax, and enjoy the movie for what it is. Because no matter how much you complain, you cannot change it.

2245596,4,B0007V6ITE,"BLADE: Trinity was very enjoyable in several areas, however, it personally to me was the weakest of the three.

But still go see it, and decide for yourself.  David S. Goyer does a tremendous job for a 1st time writer/director of a major film.  That's a lot too handle, I'm sure.  And unfortunately, it shows in the storyline...as well as some of the choppiness of some scenes.

BUT THE ACTION!  Sequences were done very well, but still not up to the level in my opinion as the fist two.  But still better than most.

CHARACTERIZATIONS: The newbies introduced - The NIGHTSTALKERS - are quite the eclectic group.  From smartass Hannibal King to sexy, badass Abagail Whistler - they are both intertaining but somewhat lacking in character development.  All ya hadda do, Mr. Goyer, was at least show that Whistler's daughter is upset over her father's death!  She cried more over her friend.  (I found that weird...)

But having the main vampire of them all - Dracula - seems proper.  The demonic look of Dracula is cool as hell, but I didn't care much for his and Blades' final battle.  Not bad, just kinda hope for a more titanic battle between these two, bigger-than-life characters.  Ya know?

I thought the beginning of the movie was the strongest.  Blade's intro is just classic action hero.  The look of the film - like the other two - is stylistically different.  Overall, I felt it as being the weakest.  Kinda confining.  But still, pretty solid.

Some scenes felt unfinished.  You can't help but notice.  Hopefully, these are going to be added to the DVD - The directors cut, no doubt! - when it comes out.  I'll be buying it!

Goyer can only get better with his next try, I'm sure.  And as for ever seeing Blade again?  I'd bet anything, sooner or later, he'll return...",1102550400,,1779,4.630225080385852
2245597,2,B0007V6ITE,"David Goyer proves he is a writer and NOT a director for this series final.  Product placement is shamefully abused.  The Blade character is simply in this movie to set up the next series about the Nightstalkers.

2245598,4,B0007V6ITE,"I gave this movie 3 1/2 stars because of the action and special effects!  There were also two great characters introduced (a gorgeous woman vampire slayer who is deadly with a high tech bow and arrow) and a guy (an ex-vampire, turned wise-cracking vampire slayer) as helpers to Blade in his war on the vampire nation.

In this one the vampires sensing they are losing, search out the original vampire of their species (he was Dracula among his many other identities).  They hope that through him they will achieve the ability to be out in the light, making them truely immortal!  The slayers on the other hand, are seeking this Dracula to use his blood to destroy all the world's vampires.

The fight scenes get a little corny (a la Kill Bill) at times but they are well choreographed to strong rock guitar music.

Blade takes center stage as he beats the crap out of everthing in sight. The real show stealers were Ryan Reynolds (Van Wilder) and Dominic Purcell who played Dracula. Ryan Reynolds played a great Hannibal King, who was definitally in the comic before Blade, and was hilarious. He could be a great  action star. Dracula was awesome. He was Blade's equal in every way. The fight scene between them was so awesome. Every time he talked it just felt like he was powerful as all hell. This was definitally the best one out of the three.

2245600,1,B0007V6ITE,"Let's get this out from the start: I love the first two movies, but this one is a failure. This movie does a few things right...but the rest is rather dreadful. In fact, the movie rarely feels anything like the other two. The direction and writing make this one an unfortunate mistake.

First, the good: The soundtrack is very noticeable in this movie and adds a pulse to many of the scenes that would otherwise feel empty. A very decent composer was also hired for the score, and it shows

Also, the cinematography is well-done and crisp. It is almost always easy to tell what is going on in a fight- unlike some other action movies.

Also, the opening and ending credits are just SWEET...but don't let the opening ones fool you.

Triply H plays a convincing and interesting bad guy- too bad he didn't get more development and screen time.

Finally, thanks to a certain character, the movie is quite often laugh out loud funny.

That's all the good- here comes all the bad:

First- remember I said the movie was funny- it's TOO funny. The focus in this movie is not on Blade, himself, but on 2 other characters who are very shallow. This is to prepare for a movie that they get on their own. One of the characters is there simply to wear tight clothes. In the other Blade movies, the characters all served some purpose.

Second, with the focus away from Blade, Blade no longer seems as cool himself- he never seems particularly triumphant and is given very few good lines (although there are a couple). Snipes also looks very old in his role and definitely isn't as trim as he used to be.

Third, the writing/plot is horrible. One and two really explored the complexity of Blade through the enemies he faced. This one seems like a vehicle for some actions scenes and scantily clad women. Most of the characters are simply boring.

Fourth, the action is lacking. The choreography here felt very tired. There were maybe 2 ""that was kinda cool"" moments, but that was it. Both of the other movies had some really inspired choreography and special effects. You've already seen the best of this one in the trailers.

Fifth, it may be a small issue, but it becomes huge here- the product placement is SHAMEFUL. If I saw one more IPOD, I was going to go ballistic.

If you are an avid Blade fan and still want to see this movie (as an avid Blade fan should), then atleast know that this isn't the same Blade you knew. Both of the first two movies (though they were done by different directors) had a thematic cohesion and fit together well in most all respects. This one is a mess- go in with low expectations and you should have a good time.",1102464000,11,2635,4.478079331941545

She can kick butt, look good in leather, kill some bloodsuckers and not break a nail.  She's joined by her trusted sidekick Ryan Renyolds.  This is a star making role for Renyolds.  He is funny, sharp, sexy, and kicks Vampires butts.  He steals just about every scenes he's in.

A contingency plan in case things went wrong.  Blade is alone again and is reluctant to accept the help of these newcomers, but realizes it may be the only way to take care of business.  Some of the wise cracks don't feel right early on in the film, but the action makes you forget that.  I rate the movie a 4 out of a 5.  Some of the dialog can get cheesy, but the story and action are top notch.  I recommend this installment for any fan of the previous Blade movies.  It doesn't disappoint as an end to the series.

The editing is a little too jumpy making it hard to tell what is going on in some of the fight scenes and the final showdown between Blade & Dracula could have been much better, but other than that I found little to complain about. Wesley Snipes is very good once again as our mostly silent hero, but it is Ryan Reynolds who steals the show with endless amounts of great lines that he delivers perfectly. Jessica Biel really surprised me here also and proves she can act, look hot, and kick some major vampire ""ash"" at the same time. I still think Blade II is the best of the three, but with the added fun and comedy in this one, I would rank it just ahead of the first Blade.

This is really not for you if you are easily offended by MTV-style editing and sound.  I subtracted one star for the ending.  It all seemed to finish too abruptly.

Not quite as comic booky as Spidey or X-Men due to it's R rating, so in case you missed the first 2 Blade movies (loser) it follows more along the lines of The Crow or The Punisher (not that you would have seen them either if you missed these) due to it's violence and pervasive language. Rock on! That would explain why we loved it so much.

The first Blade film from 98 was kind of an experiment between Marvel and New Line. Both, were a bit hesitant and that is evident by the way Marvel and or New Line decided to list the fact that 'Blade' is a Marvel property by tossing in a little side text before the directors name in the credits told the story; Even if they won't admit it. Blade 2 having been released in 2002 and comic book movies on the rise, they decided to display the Marvel name more prominently with the next one but unfortunately they still held back on the reins a bit too much for my taste. Now, we have the 2nd sequel and with the success of 2 Spidey films, 2 X-Men films, Hulk, Punisher and Daredevil there is no doubt this go round where Blade was created and how to bring him to life... Again. You will know from the first few frames of Marvel's now famous promo trailer until the end credits roll that you are watching a living breathing comic book and just like the real thing, if you let yourself go and submerse yourself completely in the story... you will be entertained.

This being the 3rd in the series the movie does not waste time with who or what Blade is and gets right down to bidness. The story for this episode begins in the middle of a desert where some very cool looking vampire commandos bail out of a helicopter and head into an old pyramid to dig up their master where the story for the ages with this series continues; The vamps decide to dig up daddy and use his 'pure' blood to continue their quest to be just like Eric and walk in the light of day without fear or turning into a piece of flashpaper. You know the drill. Meanwhile back in the big city, Blade is killing vamps in a warehouse district until a few escape and he hops in his GTO to dispense a little day walker justice. They run... He catches and he slays. Yeah Yeah, high five. Everything is business as usual for our hero until the vampire clan catches the whole thing on film and somehow the video ends up on the evening news (plot point) and due to a little misunderstanding (spoiler) he gets hunted by the police.

The cops track him down; a big shootout occurs with Whistler (Kris Kristofferson), Blade and about 100 SWAT officers. Blade and Whislter deal damage, Whistler gets popped, Big KABOOM, all is lost... emotion, emotion. Blade surrenders, the cops take him into custody and start to question him. From this point there is a big jail break sequence with Whistlers daughter Abigail (Jessica Biel), who is so hot she could live on the sun and her partner Hannibal King (Ryan Reynolds) who offers so many laughs it will have you doubling over. The 2 rescuers and Blade fight it out with the cops and a group of Vamps led by fang babe Danica Talos (Parker Posie) and Vampire Goon 'Jarko' played by former WWE World Champ, Triple H; Who I am happy to say did not suck... as long as he didn't say much.

The rest of movie is spent trying to find out what was released from the tomb in the desert and why so many 'familiars' (humans that work for vamps) are running the city and more importantly how many tight shirts we can squeeze Abigail into (rarrrrrr). I am happy to say there are many.

3 words to finish this review: Go See It. Cool action, great hotty, many chuckles, decent gore, gun play out the yang and a car chase too. AND, the return of John Doe as an added bonus. In our book that is FIVE for FIVE for 5 fangs.",1101945600,12,3854,4.2812071330589845
2245606,5,B0007V6ITE,"I rented Blade and Blade II since I was too young when the first movie came out. So I rented Blade and Blade II last year and got amazed. God those two movies were AWESOME! Ever since I've been hoping to see a Blade III since Blade hasn't finished with every vampire in the world which is his duty. Although I didn't expect him to in two movies since that's a pretty hard task. One day I even had a dream that I was in a movie theatre and saw the poster of Blade III!! So I have recently found out about Blade: Trinity and I'm so excited for this movie to come out. Not only because it will have the best story of all three movies, but because it'll be the first Blade movie I'll see in the movie theatre! It's gonna be a whole different expirience to see it in the big screen! Anyways, this is what I know about the movie's storyline:
Blade continues to fight vampires with his half-vampire abilities and also continues to struggle with his growing need for human blood and the serum is starting to not be enough to satisfy his thirst. I don't know what happened to Whistler but he's not here, he's probably dead or something.(I don't remember Whistler dying in Blade II)Anyways, Blade needs a new companion in his war against vampires and gets aid from Whistler's daughter who also survived the day when the vampires killed Whistler's family. Maybe Whistler didn't know she survived or maybe he didn't wanna tell Blade so she wouldn't get involved in the world of vampires. Well whatever it was, now she's helping Blade. Blade's second companion is a man who used to be a vampire(how he stopped being one, I don't know)and now fights them. Together, the three of them form the trinity which the movie is called after.
That's all I know. I don't know much about the movie's storyline. I don't even know what Blade's mission is now. All I know is that the creators of the movie gave me the three best stories I could ask for in a series. Blade: Introduces us to Blade's world of vampire slaying and Blade has an almost ordinary vampire slaying mission. Blade II: Blade now has to team up with the vampires to fight a new enemy who drinks both humans' and vampires' blood. Blade: Trinity: Blade continues Whistler's legacy by teaming up with his daughter and also teams up with someone who actually used to be a vampire. Anyways, I can't wait for this movie to be released!!! I can't really rate this movie yet, but since I liked the first two I gave it a five but this may change when the movie comes out.",1089676800,14,2505,4.400862068965517
