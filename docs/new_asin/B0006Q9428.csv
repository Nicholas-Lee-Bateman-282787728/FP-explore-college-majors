It's actually a good movie although it does not have a lot of actions, tech effects etc. And the acting of the actors is good, too.",1316908800,,236,4.363636363636363

2191763,2,B0006Q9428,"Given the shocking subject matter, and other reviews that promised a revealing look into the mind of J&uuml;rgen Bartsch, the teenaged serial child molester and killer (what an ignominious ""title"" that is!), I expected something different than this saccharin, boiled down and emotionless film. Told in two intertwining parts, one a grizzled black and white police confessional of the killer while in jail, and the other a recreation of the killer's young life at fifteen and some of his acts, the movie fails to present a coherent narrative. Instead, it's more of a hodgepodge of collected remembrances.

Tobias Schenk, who plays the older J&uuml;rgen, tells of things he can't remember from when he was younger, and says flatly that they are best left unremembered. What this means, we may guess. Physical abuse? Sexual abuse? Probably yes on both counts, but when the fifteen-year-old J&uuml;rgen portrayed by Sebastian Urzendowsky, doesn't exhibit any emotions - not even a hint of repressed emotions - we're left with a J&uuml;rgen that we must believe in simply because we are told to believe it. That wasn't good enough for me.

There were several fascinating aspects of the oddity that was J&uuml;rgen Bartsch. His mother bathed him, even at fifteen. She chose his playmates, which meant that he had virtually none as she felt everyone was too good for him. At one point, he helped his father in the butcher shop, but didn't find it interesting because, as the older J&uuml;rgen admits, he had no sexual attraction to animals. He wanted to remain a boy forever. When seeking out his victims he looked for boys between the ages of eight and fourteen, and when he was seventeen, he thought ill enough of his desires to engage female prostitutes. Killing was necessary to have sex. In the most telling scene of the recreated narrative thread, he has one friend, Georg, who he was madly in love with, ""play dead"". While Georg plays dead, J&uuml;rgen undresses him. Their relationship continues, but we're not shown much of it. I found that exclusion very strange, as it seemed to be a relationship that helped him reach some understandings about himself. When he was released from prison after a surprisingly short sentence (six or ten years...I don't recall exactly, but either is insane), he married a nurse (care to get inside her head?) to help integrate himself back into society. At the age of twenty-nine, he requested castration, and died during the procedure due to an anesthetic error.

There's more - but to relay it to you would be telling you, and that's what this movie did. It was full of telling, and not nearly enough dramatizing. When the movie ended I found my head full of facts, but I didn't find myself chilled to the bone. And if I just finished watching a movie where a fifteen year old boy killed a younger boy, cut open his gut, pulled the intestines out, and continued dismembering him for an hour and then, when the boy was beyond dead and dismembered, pleasured himself - I think I should feel chilled.",1175904000,5,3034,4.853281853281853
2191764,5,B0006Q9428,"the film maker takes and in depth look into the mind of a serial killer. He makes no judgements on crimes of his subjects as none are needed, no one would think they are okay. But he trys to help us in seeing where a young life took a wrong turn, in the hopes that history would not repete itself. The subject matter is engaging and disturbing enough without being graffic. I think the film maker took the high road by not making graffic, as the details could have been lost in in it. Every parent should watch this movie, and then spend some time with their children",1129680000,7,567,4.2592592592592595
2191765,3,B0006Q9428,"Jurgen Bartsch is the subject of this film about a teen aged boy who murdered other boys during the early to mid 1960's in Germany.

The film is told through a series of confessions (ostensibly to an unseen journalist) as an adult and flashbacks to the actual events in Bartsch's life. The subject matter is grim but the delivery in the film doesn't really capture the true horror that must have befell these child victims.

I don't think that we should be subjected to the sheer brutality or the sexual aspects of Bartsch's crimes, but since Bartsch confessed to the crimes, it would be well within reason to expect the filmmakers to take a more harsh stance against his crimes. Instead the delivery seems almost to attempt to justify his crimes as a result of his upbringing. Because of this, the viewer isn't able to truly empathize with any of the victims, but rather with Bartsch.

The young Bartsch is played quite well by a talented actor, but the older Bartsch as he confesses seems a bit uncommitted to his role. One could infer that the actor/filmmaker's intent is to show a young man who is indifferent to his crimes; instead the portrayal comes off a bit muddled.

If you are a fan of true crime, then you will enjoy this film for its factual aspects. However, it isn't as emotionally charged as it could have been.",1127952000,10,1327,4.586497890295359
2191766,4,B0006Q9428,"I agree with the earlier review of this film by Grady Harp (who writes many fine reviews).  I would like to add a few points.

The main character, Juergen Bartsch, is not allowed to have friends, to build social skills, to explore his sexuality, or to grow up.  His mother screens out the outside world, his father seldom speaks to him.  His mother is still giving him his baths when he is in his late teens.  When the parents separate, Juergen is sent to a Catholic boys' home where the masters will knock over his food tray if he is seen eating too frequently with the same boys.  Juergen is in Germany while Paragraph 175 is still in effect and, as a member of the Church, finds himself subject to stern teachings on homosexuality and to a sexually agressive priest. He has a negative self-image and can scarcely believe anyone would want him, except through a bribe or threat.  Only if his partner is absolutely passive or dead can he feel safe or accepted.  It gets even worse from here.

The scripts, acting, and atmosphere are excellent.  There is no frontal nudity, and the most shocking aspects of the murders are told as narrative by the older, institutionalized Juergen.

The most astonishing thing was that at the end, he found someone who would marry him after undergoing surgical castration.  That's another movie.

It's a harrowing film, not entered into lightly, but it's a very insightful and true one as well.  Recommended for the stout of heart.",1107475200,14,1464,4.66796875
2191767,4,B0006Q9428,"Kai S. Peck is one courageous Director!  He has created a very substantial and quite disturbing film about an actual bizarre serial killer and through the statements and letters of his subject and a book by Paul Moor and his astute directing he has been able to step over the sensationalism of his subject and open the door into the mind of a very ill person.

THE CHILD I NEVER WAS (originally titled EIN LEBEN LANG KURZE HOSEN TRAGEN) is frighteningly based on fact.  From 1962 through 1966 a fifteen-year-old boy named Jurgen Bartsch tortured, murdered, and then sexually molested four young German boys.  This infamous serial killer is first introduced in a black and white sequence of Jurgen as a 20 year old (Tobias Schenke) in prison for his crimes.  He frankly talks about his crimes, acknowledging their evil, but at the same time seeks to uncover his own motivations for having performed such deeds. Through a series of flashbacks we see Jurgen as a child and as a 15 year old (Sebastian Urgendowsky) and discover he was adopted by a couple who are bipolar parents - Gertrud (Ulrike Bliefert) and Gerhard (Walter Gontermann) Bartsch.  Their parenting is brutally bounced from feigned kindness to flailing mistreatments.  They do not allow Jurgen to have friends, to socialize, to have any interests.  When Jurgen begins to get in touch with his sexuality, they foster care him and seek professional advice for his sickness of homosexuality.

Young Jurgen is unable to relate to anyone and he yearns for friends.  He discovers a cave where he can escape form his ugly world and fantasize about many things, including sexual fantasies about boys 'ages 8 through 14'.  Gradually he gives in to his compulsion to seduce boys into his cave where he tortures them, eviscerates them, and once they are dead he has sexual acting out with them.  At one point he seeks a priest's (J&uuml;rgen Christoph Kamcke) confession booth seeking absolution, but the priest only tells him that he must confess to the police and devote his life to charity.  Eventually during his fourth episode of his serial madness he leaves his victim bound, disturbed that this boy actually seems to return Jurgen's bizarre sexual advances, and when he returns to the cave the boy has escaped.  Jurgen is captured and imprisoned.

The way in which the film resolves is actually touching in that from surprise confessions we grow to understand these serial murders on a certain level.  To reveal these facts would hamper the suspense of the film.  Suffice it to say that here is a sophisticated film unafraid to enter the darkest regions of a young man's mind and in doing so heightens our awareness of the fine line between response to personal abuse and madness. The cast is extraordinarily fine.  Grady Harp, January 2005",1106265600,21,2798,4.867088607594937

8042527,5,B0006Q9428,"When I was a military officer and at an Air Force Base in Germany on my itinerary before leaving for duty in the Middle East during 1983, conversations about the Jurgen Bartsch case in the 1960s abounded because this was the tragedy of a child serial killer.  Then, I was able to secure the DVD and have a better overview in the totality of circumstances of Jurgen Bartsch.  Indeed the Jurgen Bartsch case reveals everyone involved lost; there were no winners.  Four school boys were sexually abused, tortured and murdered; even Jurgen Bartsch died in surgery due to complications.  The loss of young lives defies reason and demonstrates indeed evil is irrational.  Nothing was positive for Jurgen.  He had adoptive parents who were bi-polar, severe and dysfunctional:  They did not allow Jurgen to have friends who were his age; in the DVD I was stunned to see Jurgen's adoptive Mother who forced him to be bathed by her as a boy and teenager; Jurgen was not allowed to go over to the home of friends; his adoptive parents forced him to watch TV from their bed as he had to lie between him -  the list goes on.  This DVD is a masterpiece in descriptive re-enactments of Jurgen's crimes and the circumstances leading up to cause those tragedies.  when Jurgen began to discover his sexual attraction for boys the solution of his emotionally and psychologically abuse parents is terror-filled years in a Roman Catholic Boarding School which emulates his hopeless desire to remain pubescent and never grow up.
In an exceptional manner, Kai S. Pieck and his Staff with original letters and interviews with Jurgen Bartsch as a convicted child killer at each tragic episode enable a viewer to see why such tragedy occurred because neither Jurgen nor his victims received what was needed.  This DVD presents a true life tragedy that is both haunting and heart-rending.  I do not justify Gay or Lesbian
behaviors in this film, because that is not the purpose.  Rather, the average person with common sense, compassion and
a penchant for mercy, can watch this production with a consequence of futility at the end for the loss of four young lives.",1399075200,2,2137,4.806010928961749
8042528,3,B0006Q9428,The beginning is very jumbled and I had a problem where the story was. There was a scene showing two children being buried without any any preamble to the story.

8042531,3,B0006Q9428,"When I watched We Need to Talk about Kevin I was interested in stories in a similar vein and a friend recommended ""The Child I Never Was"" to me.  Let that be a lesson to all of us when you find yourself being recommended a movie that is a little strange no some research first I really wish I had at least checked out the amazon views. At least ""We Need To Talk about Kevin"" is a fictional story.  Considering the title of the film I would imagine the object was to explain some of the motivations and make the audience sympathize with Bartsch or at least attempt to understand why he did what he did.  I'm sorry I just don't buy it I understand that serial killers are the exception to the rule in a civilized society but lots of people were unloved as children and others suffer from some manner of sexual kink that they learn to control.
Two main things also confuse me
So much time is spent telling Bartsch's side of the story that his victims barely get a footnote on one level this is understandable but when you are listening to the gruesome details of what the killer did to his targets I felt that we owed the victims at least the cliff notes version of their life.
I also don't know who is in charge of making the list for Amazon but to see this lumped with the Gay films is actually more shocking to me then the film itself.  This is not a Gay film if you are feeling charitable this is a true crime film now this probably is due to the fact that Gay cinema is small in comparison to most other branches of cinema but in most other examples I can think of no one commits a murder.",1369440000,,1591,4.1558441558441555
