8337668,5,B001RCTJRU,"Having been a hypnotheraist and psychotherapist for thirty years, I know the value of this technique.  I also know, that in the many trainings I have attended over the years, I was never taught how to do it.

I learned by reading up on the subject, including original books by Jacobson. From listening to any number of recordings by trained proffesional 'relaxation therapists', from personal practice, and from practice with thousands of clients, observing what works and what doesn't.  All in all, I learned the long way round. Most hypnotherapists have not done that research, and although they may have heard of Progressive muscle relaxation as an induction method, they have not been taught to use it effectively, with or without hypnosis, and have never experienced it themselves.

This Video, is great, not because of it's fancy camera-work and editing.
It is great because it very clearly explains both the value of this under used technique, and the methodology.

It talks the viewer (or listener) through the technique, in such a way that they can learn through their own experience the value of this process. And be able to use the technique with therapy clients, as well as in stage, applications. It includes background information on the origin of the technique, and even has relevant safety information to prevent strain or injury.

All in all a great buy!",1235433600,2,1371,4.991228070175438
8337669,5,B001RCTJRU,I thought this video was great.  I was taught PMR as a primary means of induction but not to the level that was covered in this video.  It's a very thorough approach to the subject and I appreciate the author's ability to explain everything in depth and very clearly.  A definite buy for anybody interested in Progressive Muscle Relaxation.  Even if you're not a hypnotist this a fantastic way to learn relaxation techniques.,1235347200,,425,4.780821917808219
8337670,5,B001RCTJRU,PMR is the most effective way of deepening the client and better yet the way Richard Norgard presents it is excellent. I recommend to buy this product and you will be pleased you did. PMR I use this on Stage and with my clients and find it very successful.,1235260800,,256,4.244897959183674
8337671,1,B001RCTJRU,"I can't believe this guy has been around for so long making videos and still doesn't have a clue. Its just a still video of the speaker standing in his office in front of a white board. The speaker did not wear a mic, so the sound quality was awful and he mumbled through his speech clumsily. His speech was unnecessarily long winded and self aggrandizing. I felt like I was watching a sleazy sales pitch for stage hypnosis tricks for the first 20 minutes of the video. There were evidently people sitting in the room, but I couldn't hear any of the questions they were asking or see them. I was practically asleep by the time he got to the PMR routine. This certainly is not worth the 50 bucks he has the gall to charge for it!",1234483200,3,728,4.244604316546763
