1197171,5,B000007T1D,"An ultra-low-budget, cliche-slaying tribute to the expressive possibilities of cinema by the gonzo New-Wave master who influenced a thousand and one directors now all much richer than him. Godard practically invented the 'intellectual B-movie' with ""My Life to Live,"" and made ""Band of Outsiders"" after his nauseating experiences with big-time producers Ponti and Levine on ""Contempt,"" just to prove, once again, that a man bursting with ideas doesn't need too much to express himself magnificently (he later continued in this direction with ""Alphaville,"" another cheaper than cheap masterpiece, this time in ""Science Fiction,"" without any special effects or 'futuristic sets' to speak of).
Don't be fooled by the cheesy production values (that in itself is a calculated joke mocking big-time Hollywood films with million dollar budgets and nothing to say). You have to give this film a little time to reveal its poetry. It's subtle and relaxed yet crazy, and that's good. People usually take a while longer to warm to this one than ""Alphaville,"" or ""My Life to Live,"" but it's just as brilliant. It took me 3 viewings back when I first saw it some 6 years ago, but now I know very well why it's considered a great poetic film: every time I watch it I get a unique, almost ecstatic emotion from it no other film provides, like reading a great humorous romantic poem full of Bukowski-like eccentricities.",970012800,8,1403,5.051724137931035
1197172,5,B000007T1D,"A nifty little black and white flick Godard made in 1964. Zero production value. Yet the attitude of the movie seems very modern, even today. It's very romantic and has a plot line (believe it or not) with lots of great  rainy shots of Paris. The dance number that falls together in the cafe has  got to be one of the most beautiful moments ever captured on film. A great  rainy day movie to see with a jug of wine and someone you love.",957830400,3,436,4.166666666666667
1197173,5,B000007T1D,"This is one of the lesser known of Godard's films, but it is also one of his most exciting from his 60's period with Anna Karina, who is also wonderful in this picture. It's also the film that Quentin Tarantino named  his production company after (A Band Apart, from the french title  ""Bande a part"") and contains a dance sequence that I believe was  probably the inspiration for the John Travolta/Uma Thurman dance in  ""Pulp Fiction"". Maybe.  Anyhow...this is good stuff, and it has a  great opening title sequence. So for all you kids who love a good opening  title sequence...THIS is the movie for YOU!",951004800,2,605,4.650943396226415

1197175,5,B000007T1D,"Godard made this film after the high production values of Le Mepris. You feel he's unwinding,having a good time. A tribute to Hollywood pulp crime movies of the 40s and the love affair with his wife,Anna Karina. The plot is taken from Fool's Gold,a crime novel,by Dolores Hitchens. Godard uses a basic plot,Odile meets Franz(Frey)in an English language class and with his friend,Arthur(Brasseur),forming a semi-love triangle,embark on a plan to rob her aunt of some laundered cash in a cupboard. This is at least up there with Breathless and Pierre Le Fou. There is no narrative. There is a string of inconsequential set-pieces,sly cross-references,literary allusions and quotations.

These range from Rimbaud,Kafka,Poe,Novalis,Shakespeare,Jack London,Aragon and Queneau. Arthur and Franz act out the shooting of Billy the Kid by Pat Garrett,prior to their inept criminal adventure. This is a suburban western, replete with suburban boredom and banality. The men's stamping ground is drab streets,dingy cafes and builders' yards on the city's outskirts,along the Marne,in pre-war type settings. Their car is another character,driving round in circles,expressing their freedom and ebullience. Misfits even with each other,they remain isolated and

self-absorbed.'Isn't it strange',Franz muses.'how people never form a whole?'Even in the iconic Madison dance sequence, and the 9 minute record-breaking run through the Louvre, though in sync,their disconnection is their cool. The men read out from newspapers about local petty murders,crimes,world news on a riverbank. Karina,Godard's muse,has never been better,gauche,nave,giddy and starry-eyed, drifting helplessly between the two men,making love with her eyes. Godard at his most experimental,plays with the conventions of cinema,with voice-over narrations, commenting upon the character's thoughts;mocking the banality of the story:'the robbery must wait until nightfall,

thus respecting the tradition of bad B-pictures'.Godard charms us breaking all the rules of cinema,eg,observing a minute's silence by cutting off the soundtrack,speaking to camera,letting you know you're watching a film,mingling real deaths with fake deaths. Under the comedy is a painful sense of suburban drabness and boredom, unemployment, frustration, and disillusionment -- reflected in Raoul Coutard's superb capturing of overcast weather and polluted river vistas in varying shades of grey, as well as in the sad and wistful waltzes of Michel Legrand's score. Summarising for 'latecomers':""a pile of money, a home by the river, a romantic girl.""Godard keeps us in touch with his process.",1297209600,4,2619,5.923280423280423
1197176,1,B000007T1D,"Everyone has to start somewhere. Obviously Godard had no budget for the film [he makes a highly ostensible comment about the lack of budget for the film in the film], but really, the ideas here are horrible. Maybe this would do for mediocre film student [ok, top notch film student...but I don't mean that as a compliment].

You can see some techniques of his later films emerging in this film, so perhaps it has some appeal to hardcore Godard fans who are just head-over-heels in love with his work.

Otherwise, you will spend an hour and a half listening to poor dialogue that tries to be an existentialist novel, and fails miserably [think pre-teen Ayn Rand], poor jokes [are childish sex jokes funny in France?], and an incredibly bland story.

The camera work, for the budget, is probably the best part of the film, and the acting is not horrific. There are a very, very few scenes which are almost funny [for example: when Madame Victoria claims Arthur's gun is not loaded, and Arthur calmly shoots a live round off in front of her], and perhaps watching Arthur and Franz act out scenes from random Westerns at-will is endearing to some more then to I.

All attempts to be funny, clever, abstract, etc... all fall so short of the mark as to ultimately leave a very dirty taste in the mouth. But, who knows how much of this is due to the script as opposed to Godard's doing. If it was scripted this way, then no one in the world could salvage such a poor script, and Godard never should have chosen to work with it. [The final scene of Arthur near the end, the ""Shootout"", may be the only redeeming scene in the film, if you take it as a big joke; a play on the absurdity of how big hollywood films always, despite insane odds, have the ""good guys"" win, and the ""bad guys"" lose; Godard is, if nothing else in this film, somewhat good at ""doing what we're all thinking"".]

All in all, you are far better off with 1. A real novel. 2. A later Godard film.

But, there are worse ways to spend an hour and a half I guess...this is still miles ahead of anything you'll find in today's Cinemas. If you want something palpable, ostensible, cliched, and mildly funnily to ""zone out"" on, I guess this is just the film for the night!",1262131200,5,2227,4.419512195121952
1197177,5,B000007T1D,"A really, really great movie. Simple, minimalist, and very expressive. As other people probably mentioned, the ""minute of silence"" and ensuing dance scene are worth watching the film for, for reasons which, like much of this film, I have a really hard articulating why...

1197178,5,B000007T1D,"Even though I haven't gotten around to finish watching Jean-Luc Godard's celebrated  Breathless (1960) despite trying a couple of times, I'm pretty sure I like Band of Outsiders better.  Main reason: Anna Karina.  I have little doubt that most women would prefer Breathless since it stars Jean-Paul Belmondo who, as cinematic history has it, anticipated Richard Gere's performance in Truffaut's American Breathless (1983).

What I love about Karina's Odile is her incredible naivete.  Although 20-years-old playing perhaps an 18-year-old, Karina, then Godard's wife, manages the complete and total personality of someone say 12-years-old.  It is her naivete that makes the film work as two petty, would-be criminals, Arthur (Claude Brasseur) and Franz (Sami Frey) seduce her into helping them rob a surprisingly large number of francs from her Aunt's house.  At least they think they're going to score. We'll see how the fates feel about that.

They meet in a beginning English language class.  Obviously it is not just Godard who admires American culture, our three beginners in life do as well.  Appropriately enough the film is adapted from Fools' Gold, an American novel by Dolores Hitchins.  In a sense this is a French film imitating not an American film but an American attitude toward life, a free and easy world in which riches are liable to just fall into your lap, where it's chic to be young and run with the wind and drive your convertible onto the sidewalk when you feel like it and in crazy circles for no reason at all, and it is especially fun to jump into the vehicle without opening the doors while it is moving.  It is an existence in which you feel spontaneous and uninhibited and can dance the Madison without looking at your feet.

Well, Odile and Franz can.  Arthur watches his continuously.  And this tells us something about Arthur, who is a bit mean and a bit shallow, but intent on getting his and getting it right.  It is he with whom Odile falls into puppy love.  She is attracted to his confidence and his crude masculinity, and his interest in her, nothing more.  She is further seduced by the joy of finding friends and something exciting to do.  She hasn't a clue about who they are or who she is, and that in part is the charm of the film.

She has lovely limbs that we do not see.  She runs gracefully, stretching her legs out like a colt.  She delights in sitting in the front seat of the Simca, the men on either side of her.  Steal the money she has spotted in her uncle's closet, money that she herself would never think of stealing?  Okay.  And then we go to England or better yet, South America like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.

Childish, very childish and charming because Odile is so pretty, just that, pretty as every young girl should be.  But surely something tragic is going to happen.  Surely this is a cautionary tale about how innocence is lost.

There are gray day shots of Paris and the suburbs now covered with concrete and asphalt.  There's a nine-minute run through the Louvre, young people just having fun; and then the denouement and tragedy.  Of some sort.  And then the fantasy life returns as the film ends.

Godard's story, his plot, isn't to be taken seriously, but his characters are.  Arthur is the bad guy, the primitive, just an animal acting out his animal life.  But Franz is sly, reflective, reads books, is well-mannered, is finding himself.  Odile is a child who will be a woman soon.

The Criterion Collection DVD is nicely presented with some of the usual extras, including excerpts from interviews with Godard and Anna Karina.  The subtitles are excellent.  There's a booklet with a review by Joshua Clover and part of an interview by Jean Collet from 1964 entitled,  ""No Questions Asked: Conversations with Jean-Luc Godard.""",1182988800,3,3808,4.7629969418960245
1197179,5,B000007T1D,"Like Godard's ""Breathless,"" the exhilarating ""Outsiders"" is one of the director's most accessible and enjoyable outings from the 1960s. Part buddy film, part crime-gone-wrong drama, it tells the story of three disaffected friends whose ill-advised adventure in armed robbery is really a way for Godard to capture their devil-may-care youthfulness. Tracking the trio's romp through the Louvre (to beat the nine-minute record of an American tourist!) or staging a cool, dazzling three-way dance (the Madison) next to a caf&eacute; jukebox, Godard is at his most invigorating here. In all, ""Outsiders"" is atmospheric, free-spirited, and fun.",1182902400,,638,5.726315789473684
1197180,3,B000007T1D,"While ""Band of Outsiders"" exemplifies French filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard's philosophy of overturning traditional filmmaking to bring a New Wave of cinema to France in the 1960s, it does not possess the charisma that spontaneity and natural environments lent the best of Godard's films. This is the underside of the New Wave, a lesson in why doing things simply because they have not been done before does not make good art. ""Band of Outsiders"" takes inspiration from American crime films of the 1940s and applies it to aimless youth of the 1960s to create a sort of lackadaisical caper movie. Best friends Franz (Sami Frey) and Arthur (Claude Brasseur) know pretty young Odile (Anna Karina) from English class, where they halfheartedly compete for her attentions. When Odile lets slip that the boarder at her Aunt's house keeps a large stash of cash, Arthur jumps at the chance to steal it, coaxing a passive Franz and reluctant Odile to take part in his plan.

Claude Brasseur is good as shameless, domineering Arthur. Anna Karina, who was married to Jean-Luc Godard at the time, gives an annoying stilted performance, however, as the witless Odile. The only emotion she does convincingly is fear. Beyond that, we have an endless stream of allusions to other films and literature, gimmicks that draw attention to themselves, and a wholly superfluous voice-over narration spoken by the director himself. There was hardly a scene in the first hour of the movie that didn't have me waiting impatiently for it to end. In Godard's defense, the interminable and often unnecessary scenes may be the result of the minimum feature film requirement of 90 minutes in France at the time. But I would suggest that he write a film with more substance in order to meet that requirement instead of padding a simplistic storyline with junk.

""Band of Outsiders"" improves in the last half hour, as the need for filler decreases. But there is not enough depth of character or intricacy of plot to support a feature-length film. I'd like to be able to call it an exercise in style, but I think a project in self-indulgence would be more accurate. Maybe the reflexive elements such as removing the sound for 2 minutes or having actors speak to the camera were eye-openers when ""Band of Outsiders"" was released in 1964. But audiences are more sophisticated now. They're conscious of cinema's contrivances and their own complicity in them. If you show audiences that films are fake and manipulative, you insult their intelligence. Directors of the French New Wave are part of the reason that this is true today. But there were better examples of reflexive filmmaking in the 1960s than ""Band of Outsiders"". The film gets 2 stars. My 3 stars are for the Criterion Collection disc. In French with optional English subtitles.

The DVD (Criterion Collection 2003): ""Visual Glossary""  (18 min) explains the many allusions and references in the film. ""Godard 1964"" (5 min) features interview clips with Jean-Luc Godard from a 1964 French television documentary, in which he defines the Nouvelle Vague, as well as behind-the-scenes footage from this film. ""Anna Karina"" (18 min) is a 2002 interview with the actress. She talks about how she got into film, how Godard worked with actors, and the character of Odile. ""Raoul Coutard"" (11 min) is an interview with the cinematographer of ""Band of Outsiders"", who supervised the Criterion Collection transfer. He talks about Godard's ""reportage"" shooting style and camera and lighting challenges on the film. All interviews are in French with English subtitles. ""Les Fiances du Pont Mac Donald"" (3 min) is a short silent comedy by Agnes Varda featuring Karina, Frey, and Godard. (French & English intertitles) There are 2 trailers (2 min each), one original and one for the 2001 re-release.",1179187200,3,3803,5.012658227848101
1197181,4,B000007T1D,"If one film could some up the ouevre of Jean Luc Godard it would probably be 'band of outsiders'.. It is a great example of French New wave.. As in many godard pictures the plot is not that important - its like he is saying - yeah, yeah, we've seen this plot a million times before lets just use it as a means of improvisation.. With Raoul Cotard's cinematography we see Paris in all its glory - filming the streets like no one else.. Yet despite all this playfulness 'band of outsiders' plays as one of Godard's most wistful, melancholic films.. Maybe it is the score by Legrand (who is capable of much better) - but everytime i see this movie the combination of music and image never fails to make me get extremely tired and actually doze off - and i like this movie! Yet this is what makes me hesitate from calling it Godard's best (though it contains some of his best moments).. So I would say this is a must for Godard fans.. my personal favorites of Godard are 'Breathless' and 'Pierrot le fou' - although it is hard to beat the minute of silence...",1171670400,,1055,4.333333333333333
1197182,5,B000007T1D,"""Band of Outsiders"" is the epitome of a great film and embodies, for me, exactly what a film should be. The film has inspired, at least partly, a large number of films over the year. Most famously a few scenes in ""Pulp Fiction."" It is also the film that Quentin Tarantino named his production company after (A Band Apart). If you've seen Pulp Fiction, as many times as I have, you'll notice a lot more inspiration than the casual viewer will. ""Band of Outsiders"" was released in 1964 and doesn't follow the typical movie formula. It's completely spontaneous, strung together, and fresh after all these years. The film is about two budding criminals named Franz (Sami Frey) and Arthur (Claude Brasseur), who conspire to rob the aunt of the beautiful Odile (Anna Karina, ""My Life to Live""). Both men are in love with Odile, but much more preoccupied with getting the money. In a review I read for the film it called the script ""incoherent"" while another review said the film felt ""strung together quickly and without much thought."" Both of these reviews are incredibly inaccurate. The plot does feel strung together, but that's what is so great about it. We meet Franz and Arthur as they're driving a car, they talk about Odile, they reenact the death of Billy the Kid, they take a stab at learning English before meeting up with Odile and putting their plan into motion. In one scene (at a coffee shop) the three stand up and dance in one continuous take. A movie does not have to have a coherent plot to be great. A great movie was once defined by Howard Hawks as being ""three great scenes, no bad scenes."" This film has no bad scenes and more than three great ones. Jean-Luc Godard, a director whose work I've only recently discovered (the other Godard films I've seen are ""Weekend"" and ""My Life to Live""), directed films that have a timeless quality to them. Movies that still feel new today and will continue to do so until the world looks like an episode of ""The Jetsons."" This film (and his others) have aged better than films like ""Citizen Kane"" (which isn't to say this is better). His movies feel so fun and spontaneous; it's hard not to be sucked in. The Criterion Collection has, once again, done a magnificent job with the DVD. The sound and picture quality is superb and the bonus features are good, although one wishes for more, but they're still interesting. Any person who likes unique films or liked ""Pulp Fiction"" and wants to see a film that inspired it should check this out. It's one of the great movies.

1197183,5,B000007T1D,"I'm not usually a foreign-film type of guy, but this movie really stuck to me in strange ways that didn't seem obvious when I had finished watching it.

The plot seems mostly simple, with a couple of twists that aren't completely brilliant.  I wasn't shocked when the heist didn't go well, and I wasn't shocked when Odile and Franz become lovers.

I think what makes this movie stand out is, as I think another reviewer put it, the way that it seizes your attention and runs with it.  It's like going to a community theatre production or a school play and seeing someone with real talent burst into genius.  It's always a struggle to read the dialogue from the screen and enjoy and appreciate the movie, but this is a movie that was good even through subtitles.

I suppose there are a few things that I would also say about this movie that make it unusually good:

- It seems to surprise you with unsurprising things.  It's more than just good acting and careful scripting.

- It bundles emotions in interesting ways - humor and tragedy, naked greed and pity, lust and tenderness - that push you in strange directions.  After thousands of hours of Hollywood crap, it's nice to get a thoughtful work of art.

I'm bumbling through this a little, partly because I wasn't expecting so many people to have something to say about what seemed to me to be such an obscure movie.  But I was wrong.  This is a great movie, and I'm going to be watching everything Godard did.",1155600000,9,1464,4.5
1197184,5,B000007T1D,"Clearly Godard's camera is in love with Anna Karina and this instructs the entire film. That face: Those big almond shaped eyes; innocent, curious, mysterious, mischievous. Odele caught in the prison of her budding sexuality. Oscar and Alex stuck in a web with her, each trapped for different reasons, but all three caught in a struggle manipulated by the puppet master, Godard. ""Three weeks earlier, a pile of money. An English class. A house by the river. A romantic girl."" A story as improbable as the ""legend"" of Billy the Kid! This film is derived out of a mixture of boredom, desire and desperation from a filmmaker at odds between love and revulsion of Americana and the cinematic experience in general. One often wonders if making movies is Godard's guilty pleasure. Rather than construct a story, he often seems more interested in deconstruction. His Paris is visually stark and cold, but there is also much beauty. Sadness and beauty: ""it all depends upon how you frame the picture."" Again I fall back to Odele/Karina. Odele is constantly reinventing herself, bouncing from sensation to sensation and Oscar, Alex and even the director himself are trying to grab hold, but she's far too illusive - even for the puppet master! Godard is in love with Odele/Karina and this is infectious. He is also in love with Paris and American movies and cannot help it. An intellectual trying desperately to reign in his emotions but failing brilliantly. This is why ""Band of Outsiders"" succeeds so well. There is much more at work in this film than Godard merely trying to be clever; the moment of silence, the ""Madison"" dance sequence, the Louvre world record. There is a welcome spontaneity fused together with impeccable technique. A scene in the film that is particularly instructive takes place with all three characters in an English class. As the teacher reads the death scene from Romeo and Juliet, the three star crossed lovers seem oblivious to the words, and yet the emotion behind the words seem to color their actions. They are creating their own love story of sorts - but it is a story that lives and breathes inside a movie, where even tragedy is tempered by that good old American ""happy ending"".",1139356800,17,2208,4.859416445623342

Although the traditional structure is present--small-time criminals get in over their heads and meet with tragedy--director Jean-Luc Godard does not choose the earnest emphasis on plot that usually distinguishes such material.  He strips the ""plot"" to its bare essentials--three people are going to burglarize a house--and, as if to acknowledge that such characters could never exist in the real world, he presents them as existentially-challenged, melancholy misfits who lack a sense of connection with the everyday world and amuse themselves with impromptu breaks with reality such as an spontaneous dance in a cafe, a race through the Louvre to see everything in the shortest possible time, and pantomimed gunfights in the street.  This film walks a fine line between inviting both contempt for the unsympathetic characters as well as delight at the liberties Godard takes with the conventions of film and his chosen genre./",1124582400,4,1107,5.207865168539326

The three main characters give you nothing to root for or care about.  That is the biggest weakness for me.  I don't care about, or like, any of these people.  I pretty much despise them.

There is Odile, who betrays her own family and hurts them terribly.  She doesn't particularly care.  There is Franz, who is a bore.  And there is Arthur, a mean s.o.b. who knows how to treat a woman like Odile in order to get everything he wants out of her.

The story leaves something to be desired when it elicits a reaction from its audience that we kind of wish they all would drop dead.  And yet, I didn't dislike the movie at all.  I can watch a movie about annoying people.  I can appreciate the artistry that went into making this movie.  I give a lot of movies three stars.

But I did enjoy this film very much.  I like the story, love the cinematography (did I spell that right?), and what's not to love about the Madison scene?  My only complaint is the blatent b-movie and pulp novel references (did the narrator really have to say things like ""This is the part where we learn what the characters are feeling?"").  Perhaps that's the whole point of the film, but I personally think the film would be just as good without them.

Cinema today would not be what it is without the classics; without Godard, without Kurosawa, without Fellini we would have no Tarintino, Spielberg, or Scorsese.  Band of Outsiders is an example of how fun a movie can be, and an even better example on how early cinema gave a blueprint for modern classics.  In one of the greatest scenes in a film I've ever witnessed, the films three main characters, Odile, Aurthur, and Franz, dance the Madison for several minutes inside a cafe, while taking a break from their drinks and, seemingly, their reality.  Their reality, for the moment, is the thought of performing a crime; stealing several thousand Francs from the house where Odile stays with her aunt.  It is not the only place in the film where the characters do this (another memorable scene is a race through the Lourve in an attempt to beat an American's record for the fastest visit), but it is easily the finest.  The scene is mimicked, but not mocked or re-created, in less a revealing or personal scene in Pulp Fiction.  Although it was funny and odd to see Uma and John dance the way they do, it is a far cry from the trio dancing the Madison.  However, I don't think Tarintino was trying to BE Godard in that scene, simply to pay homage to him (the name of Tarintino's production company is A Band Apart.  Bande a Part is the french name for Band of Outsiders; thats not a coincedance!)

Just as Scorsese pays deliberate homage to Sam Fuller during a Boxing scene in Raging Bull, Tarintio uses his films to pay due respect to the brilliant films and film-makers that inspired him.  My point in all this is to fans who attack modern film makers, and often times cut them down for showing such respect to those who inspired them, just as much as it is to say to fans of modern cinema to take a much-needed gander back to the classics.  Pulp Fiction got me interested in the art of film making, and I will always love that movie for it.  And if I decide that Tarintino used bits and pieces from his favorite movies to make his own, so what?  It shows an amount of personality and respect that is lost on most of today's (my!) generation.  Don't be mad at Tarintino for being too obvious; be glad that someone who is considered hip has the guts to do it at all and not sell himself, or his heros, short.",1110326400,4,2329,4.434272300469484
1197189,5,B000007T1D,"Yes, this movie is awe-inspiring, awesome (I'm running out of adjectives here, lol) but will certain film critics (Roger Ebert I hope you read this) stop going around and saying how everything with dark humor, odd narrative, talky dialogue, etc., is Tarantino-esque?? Without Godard writing the blueprint on how to be a film essayist, there wouldn't be a Tarantino-esque (QT also owes a lot to Elmore Leonard, Scorsese, DePalma, and blaxploitation.). If I read one more review from overrated critic Ebert about how Tarantino paved the way for filmmakers that have a Godardian bite to their films, I might kill myself, lol

He never says how great of an influence Godard had on Tarantino. Nor does any other critics say how Godard's ""Breathless"" created modern cinema. Its as though these critics totally ignored Godard's methods, and pretend geeks like Tarantino created them. Shame on you Ebert.

That's like saying Christina Aguilera created that soulful yet high-scale histeronic singing she does, when Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey did it before her. Give people the credit they deserve!",1099267200,3,1094,5.2102272727272725
1197190,4,B000007T1D,"Band of Outsiders is one of those films that you are either going to love or hate. When i first saw the film I could not understand what all the fuss was about. I found the film rather boring and very slow paced with no conclusion in sight and so I had to watch it in three viewings.

Im glad for taking my time watching the film because during my break inbetween viewings i had time to think about what i had watched. The film for some reason kept playing back in my head time and time again. I could not understand the phenomenon of why i kept thinking about a film that i hardly liked!

I realized that Godard is a genius, he somehow has a way of capturing the viewers attention without really do so. The cafe scene where the trio does a dance ensemble kept playing back and back in my mind it was some sort of rythmitic hypnosis. I still play it in my head.

The film is pure noir with a different view of Paris than we typically see in other more romantizied films. It takes part in some of the more grittier parts of town at the time, which goes well with the characters personalities which are neither flashy, glitzy or normal you could almost say surreal.

I higly recommend this film to anyone who wants to experience something a bit different something a bit disagreable with a typical format for a movie.",1093564800,,1315,4.269076305220883

It's so completely enjoyable. Godard was obviously having lots of fun making this. The ""Cafe Scene"" is amazing, and just has to be seen. It stands on its own as a piece of amazing film making- the ""minute"" of silence, and the three main characters dancing the madison. Even if you've heard about this scene, it has to be seen to believe how wonderful it really is.

 Quentin Tarantino named his production company after this movie, and it's easy to see the influences. If you like Tarantino, you have to see this one. If not, you should probably see it too. It's a crime movie, but it's not drapped in violence like Tarantinos films, it's filled with dialouge and dancing!

It was so flakey, kind of a line dance to French Pop sound of 1964, hard to describe. Anna Karina is sutle knock out, frumby in most scenes, but she Ann Margaret's in dance. The rest of the movie is a playful romp, a nonsensical take off on American heist movies of the 40's. Not totally successful, but worth it for sophisticated.",1087516800,,432,4.280487804878049

1197194,5,B000007T1D,"Band of Outsiders is easily Godard's most accessible and most enjoyable film. This is early 60's New Wave spirited, movie convention bashing Godard, not the abstract inpenatratably political Godard of the late 60's and on. Spontaneous and joyful the picture has that wondeful feel of Paris in the early 60's. Godard punctuates the film with brilliant witty asides that are among his finest. The Louvre tour and Madison dance are some of the coolest moments on film. In fact the entire movie conveys a great sense of cool, a quirky cool. For me the film is especially notable because it introduced me to Anna Karina. This is one of the seven films she made with Godard and with this film I became captivated by her prescence as icon of the New Wave.
Video: Thank you Criterion for providing a gorgeous transfer of the film. Extremely clean, perfectly sharp, nice contrast and this film is nearly 40 years old!
Extras: Way to good, this is cheap for a Criterion disc and has more extras then most. A fun bonus identfies several in jokes and literary references, although the narrator is annoying. A short documentary actually has footage of Godard directing on set and is great for historic purposes. A recent interview with Coutard is interesting, but the highlight for me was an recent interview with Anna Karina. My college term paper on Karina took a lot of material from this. Another great bonus is a short silent film starring Karina and Godard. This short is in the film Cleo 5-7 and is lots of fun is you know a thing or two about Karina and Godard's relationship. Godard's own trailer for the film is wonderful and as I write this I notice their is a lengthy booklet which I didn't get around to reading.

The vision is of two men and a woman planning a robbery of a large sum of money.  The planning itself is a fruitless accomplishment as the three characters diverge cognitively, and instead end up entertaining their thoughts and egos.  Nevertheless, they are certain about setting their plan into action.  Occasionally, it seems as if Godard has lost it, but there is always a designed thought behind each action and scene.  Throughout the film Godard uses quotes from books, films, and music of his choosing, which colors the personalities of the characters.  These characters are what creates the cinematic experience together with Godard's rebellious directing and the groundbreaking cinematography.

1197199,5,B000007T1D,"If there are any films that offer a wonderful sense of love for the cinema, they are the films of Jean-Luc Godard. But, as he explains in a brief interview from 1964 that is included with this fine DVD, he was also against film; that is, against the conventions and rules that predominated French cinema. So he introduced unconventional methods of telling stories and making movies and decided to include elements that films typically left out. ""Band of Outsiders"" is a playful, unconventional, mesmerizing tale of small-time gangsters and young love set in 1960s Paris.  Its source material runs the gamut from the pulp crime novel on which it is based to the American B-movies and film noir that inspired its look. It's Godard's best love letter to Paris since ""Breathless,"" and also one of the last of his true New Wave films.
The story might be simple enough: Arthur and Franz enlist the help of the young, beautiful Odile to stage a robbery. But if the story is simple, everything else around it is not. Here we find allusions and homages to Arthur Rimbaud (the poet whom one of the characters is named after), Franz Kafka, film composer Michel Legrand, ""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg,"" T.S. Eliot, Shakespeare, American cartoons, Jack London, Charlie Chaplin, Andre Breton, Andre Malraux, and numerous others. That's Godard doing his thing, and even if we miss those allusions, there's so much more to be cherished: the famous minute of silence, the running visit through the Louvre, the dance scene, the glorious closeups of Anna Karina, riding on the underground metro, the trio driving through the streets of Paris.
""Band of Outsiders"" is playful, wondrous, hilarious, breezy, but at the same time melancholic, dark in its undertones. Raoul Coutard's photography gives it a stark look, but its playfulness is its most alluring aspect, along with Godard's wonderfully appealing, inventive visual language. It might not be the finest example of the French New Wave, nor is it as perfect as a work of art as ""Breathless"" and ""My Life to Live,"" but in its flaunting of cinematic invention, its richness, and its embodiment of pure cinema, it's in a class by itself and certainly a film that should be seen, if not owned, by lovers of cinema. Its most memorable moments will remain in your mind forever.
Many Godard fans, myself included, have been waiting eagerly for this Criterion edition of ""Band of Outsiders.""  It's a remarkable digital transfer; the images and contrasts are crisp; the mono soundtrack is as clear as possible.  The additional features are worth the price of the DVD alone, including a visual glossary that explains many of the film's allusions and a brief interview in which Godard explains the philosophy behind the New Wave.  Criterion has really outdone itself with this disc, and that's saying something.
I recommend that, even if you do not know French, you should watch this film at least once with the subtitles off since they sometimes obscure the closeups that make this film so memorable. When the camera is on Anna Karina's face, believe me when I say you don't want anything to stand in its way.",1041984000,77,3132,4.90377358490566
1197200,5,B000007T1D,"'Band of outsiders' is Jean-Luc Cinema Godard's most endearing film - a teen movie played by adults, a love story, a heist movie, a serial, a slapstick comedy, an anthology of New Wave magic.  As with previous films, Hollywood genre is made a complete nonsense, continually deflated by extended bits of business, my favourite being the attempt to beat the record for racing down the Louvre's corridors just before the heist.
As with all early Godard, the joy of 'Band' is in the bouyant playfulness of his style - the high, long shots looking down on bustling activity; the long car-journeys through Paris streets; the intense close-ups on Anna Karina (Godard's wife), eluding all meaning, or the sheer rapture in watching her running along pavements, or crossing a river; the messing around disused yards; the lengthy quotes and allusions that stall the action and give resonance to the silly goings-on and the turmoil of the characters in them; the unwavering long takes with exciting real sound; the playful homages to old Hollywood; the narrator's bumptious intrusions, equating events with 'bad B-movies'.
More than Louis Malle's 'Zazie dans le metro', 'Band' is the ultimate Raymond Queneau film - Karina's character is named after the heroine of Queneau's roman a clef 'Odile', a book about the writer's break with the Surrealists, just as 'Band' signals Godard's outpacing the New Wave - with its deadpan marginal heroes, its elusive heroine who doesn't want to be elusive; its romanticising Paris, especially its margins  and its pull to the embankments; the attractions like circuses and funfairs intruding on the everyday.  Godard finds a cinematic equivalent for Queneau's narrative voice - its flip melancholy; its casual intellectualism; its move from messing about to the philosophical to slapstick to dreams to the tragic and back again; in the self-consciousness of the characters; in the narrative mix of whim, genre and destiny.",1000339200,35,1947,5.194267515923567
1197201,5,B000007T1D,"Jean-Luc Godard has long been the darling of the French New Wave, beginning with the 'stereotypical' nouvelle vague film, ""Breathless."" While ""Breathless"" is the film that everyone regards as 'the one,' the true beauty in Godard's filmmaking is expressed with ""Band of Outsiders."" Once again featuring Godard's beautiful wife Anna Karina, ""Band of Outsiders"" is the kind of crime film that you're not entirely sure if you like or not. You know it's good, and you understand the mocking nature of it, but you're not sure if you like it.
Godard puts the viewer in a state of euphoria by spinning a tale of intrigue involving two 'criminals' and their female counterpart. This part of the story is the crime drama that we know and love. But at the same time, Godard is letting his imagination run wild, filling our minds with life's little pleasantries and random absurdities.
While Truffault's films as a whole are more widely recognized around the world, Godard truly is the grandfather of the French New Wave. Truffault's films are easy for average film viewers to watch, as he spoon feeds us one situation after another. Truffault is the Zemeckis of the French New Wave. Not a bad director, in fact a very competent one, just not one who is on the cutting edge, as is Godard. To begin to appreciate Godard, one must watch the master at work. And the best place to start is right here, with the relatively unknown and certainly underappreciated ""Band of Outsiders.""",991612800,7,1465,4.817460317460317

7905283,5,B000007T1D,"Bande &agrave; part"" means Band of outsiders and was made in earthy black and white in 1964. It has been hailed as a masterpiece and Quentin Tarrantino lists it as one of his faves  naming his production company after this film.

It centres around three people Franz, Arthur and Odile. They meet whilst learning English and Odile is a spirited thing, who lets on that she is living with a wealthy family in Joinville and loads of cash is kept lying about the place. They are a tad short on liquid assets but make up for it in manufactured charm and schoolboy enthusiasm for all things American  especially gangsters. So they persuade her to help them with the foreseeable heist.

Now that is simple but it is the detail and the acting that make this a stand out. There is a famous dance scene in this which seems impromptu but must have taken an eon of planning and to say it is both captivating and charming is well below the plaudits it deserves.

The acting can be very physical too at times and borders on the comedic, but it is all these things that are anything but run of the mill that make this film so enchanting. I had to watch it twice to really appreciate it but this is one that I was truly glad I did.

7905285,3,B000007T1D,"I had a hard time getting a hold on this, and of course, I understand that it shouldn't be judged by the criteria of standard ""realism,"" but all the same, I feel that some sense of the thing as a whole has to come through -- it can't just be a sequence of surprises, even if some of the surprises are quite delightful, as is the case here.  I realize that other viewers might not have my preconceptions about ""unity of impression"" or ""coherence effect,"" and if a sequence of surprises delights you, then more power to you.  For myself, it would have helped if I had more first-hand experience of the kind of French cinema that the ""new wave"" was setting its face against, but I don't, and that's not Jean-Luc Godard's fault.  It's interesting too that a lot of what I've read about the movie and what I've seen on the Criterion issue ""special features"" does tend to focus on particular scenes, moments, allusions, and in a way that is making it clear just how ""meta"" this movie is.

All that said, I have no complaints about the actors, and the black-and-white filming is often wonderful to look at.  Anna Karina is an attractive presence, and there's a clear contrast between the male leads Sami Frey and Claude Brasseur, although it's a pretty broad one; Frey is recessive/stylish and Brasseur macho/demotic.  Both have an appeal for Karina's character, and that is fine.  But we know nothing about where any of these characters has come from -- i. e. there is quite deliberately no socio-psychological dimension to ""character"" here, and that is evident in Brasseur's claim that it's OK to rob Mr Stolz because he's a tax evader.  I mean. . . where else in the movie does ANY character show any moral or political awareness?  The justification is just part of the fun.  Also, I like some of the iconic scenes as much as anybody -- the run through the Louvre, Karina's response to the T. S. Eliot question, the odd Monty-Pythonesque quality of the shoot-out near the end, and, of course, the dance (the Madison).  Maybe the dance is the best metaphor for the whole thing -- to see the characters engaged in a dance rather than in a typical narrative.  So . . . it had its arresting moments, though it had its boring ones too (the shots from the car got old for me).  I'm glad I saw it, but I wasn't always grabbed by it.  By contrast, Truffaut, another director associated with the new wave, did grab me in ""The Last Metro,"" for example . . . but I'm not sure that it and ""Band of Outsiders"" are really comparable.",1422230400,,2515,4.4868421052631575

7905288,4,B000007T1D,"Jean-Luc Godard's 1964 film ""Band a part"" (sometimes titled ""Band of Outsiders"") is an adaptation of a American crime novel that transcends its pulp origins through Godard's cinematic invention. The young lady Odile (Anna Karina), who isn't very bright, meets lowlife Franz (Sami Frey) in an English course and makes the mistake of telling him that the home in which she lives with her aunt holds a large amount of cash. Franz and fellow criminal Arthur (Claude Brasseur) plan a heist while at the same time vying for Odile's love, or at least her body. As is common in the French New Wave, the auteur only uses a crime caper as a skeleton for his own storytelling. A narrator (Godard himself) occasionally reads descriptive passages from the original novel, which are horribly purple prose, as if Godard is poking fun at his own source of inspiration.

""Bande  part"" has occasionally been treated as a departure from this director's work, as ""Godard for people who don't like Godard"". However, anyone who has seen Godard's films to date will immediately recognize elements typical of his work at the time. For example, someone reads aloud a classic work of literature, this time an English teacher in a parody of modern language-learning methods. There is leftist social commentary, as the two criminals kill time by reading aloud tragic passages from Parisian newspapers. There is also dancing, as in the film's most famous scene Odile, Franz and Arthur interrupt their plotting for an amusing line dance in a caf, over which the narrator tells us their unspoken thoughts.

And then there is Godard's many references to the film canon. ""Bande  part"" is deeply imbued with the spirit of American noir films, which fits with the crime caper plot, but it also nods to classic slapstick and romance, which gives it a levity and charm I wouldn't have expected from a film with these particular characters. ""Bande  part"" may not be among the most awesome masterpieces of cinema, but it is memorable and funny, and very much worth seeing for fans of mid-century French films.",1408233600,,2070,4.919770773638969
