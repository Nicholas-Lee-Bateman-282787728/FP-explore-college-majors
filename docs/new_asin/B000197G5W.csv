8008568,2,B000197G5W,"Well, what can I say?  It is a running commercial for the Royal Canadian Train ride.  Okay video.  I like trains so that may help some.  But, what I learned was that I do not want to pay the very high price to ride this train considering it spends overnights parked.",1425859200,,266,4.1568627450980395

8008570,5,B000197G5W,"If you enjoy railroading, and trains, you can't miss with this series of the famous ""name trains"" of the world. The photography is first rate, most shot fairly recently, with modern cameras.",1394323200,,190,4.96875
8008571,4,B000197G5W,"I enjoyed this video. I would have liked more specific info on what an itinerary and accommodations would look like. But all in all, an informative video.",1371600000,,154,4.7407407407407405
8008572,5,B000197G5W,After viewing this DVD I feel as if I had been on this ultra-luxurious trip.  The music and scenery were absolutely stunning!! I particularly enjoyed scenes of the train traveling in the gorgeous scenic backgrounds.  All my life I have wanted to take this trip but know full-well that I will never be able to afford the several thousand dollar cost. This DVD is well worth the price!!,1272844800,,384,4.632352941176471
8008573,2,B000197G5W,"I can't say we didn't enjoy seeing this video, but we will not bother viewing it a second time.  We were hoping for more scenery, and far less commercialism.  Rose and John",1227398400,2,172,4.34375
8008574,5,B000197G5W,My husband loves anything about trains.  He especially loves the music on the train CD's.  Enjoy the ride.,1206921600,,106,4.833333333333333
8008575,2,B000197G5W,"While the color was much better than the Rocky Mountain Pass trip DVD, the train is different.  They so highly taught it as a First Class Luxury trip, I think you'd have to be in the wealthy class to even afford to go on this trip.  The scenery is not as good as the Rocky Mountain Pass trip from Vancouver to Banff, I'd take that one first.  It looks a lot more fun, while this one shows 5 star luxury, it's not my style of fun.  The DVD itself is fairly colorful, but so intent on showing how high class the trip is, I think it turns more people off to the trip, than on.  I'd recommend seeing the DVD however, so you do not make the mistake of taking this particular trip.  Take a better trip, you'll have more fun.",1193616000,5,718,4.056737588652482
8008576,5,B000197G5W,"As echoed by the narrator on this enjoyable DVD, The Royal Canadian Pacific, from the ""World Class Trains"" series, this once-in-a-lifetime journey is not reserved only for the affluent. It is also a treasure for the average person who dreams of splurging on a fantastic rail trip of this caliber.  For the price of a first-matinee movie ticket, this 55-minute DVD offers the viewer stunning vistas of Western Canada that an airplane ride cannot provide.

As you, the armchair traveler, climb aboard The Royal Canadian Pacific with a small group of eager passengers, you too can pretend to anticipate the gourmet meals and fine music in well-appointed railcars.  Eloquent narration and seemingly gentle movements of the train make for a pleasant journey.

From your cozy chair or sofa, watch nature's bounty pass by like mobile landscape paintings.  The map that unfolds during the DVD's running helps orient you to Western Canada's geography and history.  Glancing out of the large, curtained window to your left (or right), listen to the history of First Nation people who once were the only inhabitants of the vast land known to us today as Canada -- not to mention the entire North American continent.  After your virtual journey, you may never look upon a river, mountain or valley the same way ever again, for First Nation people considered these magnificent formations -- along with the sky -- to be sacred.  In addition to the beautiful, if fleeting, scenes, you will hear spiritually ambient music that may leave you with a lasting impression of how people and other animals fit into  nature's intricate tapestry.

Sip from a cup of tea as you also learn the history of The Royal Canadian Pacific itself and discover how, with the deep pockets of railroad barons, railroad construction literally created industries and towns across Canada.  (This also happened in the United States.) In terms of European settlement in Canada, this railway journey explores only English and Scottish influences.  The train does not travel to, from or within the French-settled province of Quebec.  Therefore, those who are looking for a DVD about Quebec would need to look elsewhere.

The Royal Canadian Pacific is a relaxing, educational and entertaining DVD that will be worth repeated viewings. For all you know, one day it might inspire you to book the same luxurious rail journey.  Believe me when I say that you will gain a new appreciation for the expression ""All aboard!""",1177027200,11,2470,5.019607843137255
