And I almost missed it. The first scene, a thoroughly quotidian scene in which the film's dashing young hero enters a restaurant and is shown to a booth, was so bad that I nearly stopped the movie after that single minute. But something, perhaps that apparently inborn trait that draws us, like moths to bug zappers, to the grotesque in life--traffic accidents, open wounds,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lindsay-Lohan/dp/B0027CHPD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lindsay Lohan</a>--or maybe just the laziness that comes with a Y chromosome and keeps me from extending the energy to push the remote, made me keep watching. And to think what I would have missed!

Birdemic is astonishingly inept. The coverage, for instance, during any of the conversations in the film is embarrassingly bad with the result that there are unnatural pauses interspersed throughout any conversation (the flaw that nearly prevented me from watching the film). Or perhaps it's the editing that truly sucks. A few shots should have ended long before they actually did. At any rate, the film moves along ineptly for a good 15 or 20 minutes until it achieves its true glory, something hinted at in a few scenes but never fully realized until the middle of the film. I'm talking about the special effects.

There is a scene early in the film in which the aforementioned dashing hero and the fetching heroine are on a date. Those who have seen the date montage for Leslie Nielsen and Priscilla Presley from, I think, the first&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Naked-Gun/dp/0792166469/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Naked Gun</a>&nbsp;film will understand the true beauty of this scene. The young soon-to-be lovers pause to admire three birds hovering near a tree. The problem is that the birds look less real than the atomic octopus sans motor in Ed Wood's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bride-of-the-Monster/dp/B00003XAMP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bride of the Monster</a>. Technology has given us amazing CGI, but true auteurs, like James Nguyen, whose mess Birdemic is, have an ineptitude that transcends the march of progress. So we find out when the birds attack.

For those who are not familiar with avian martial strategy, it is, I gather much the same the world over. The birds make sounds like WWII airplanes and then dive bomb their targets. Upon reaching these targets, they explode. Bird boom pow. At this point in the film, I was a bit confused. I had not known that birds explode, but later, a scientist appears a la&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/War-Games-s/dp/0792838467/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">War Games's</a>&nbsp;Falken (albeit without the fun video) and explains that global warming is to blame and that, apparently, one of the well-known effects of the death of krill in the oceans is exploding birds. I may have missed some of the technical points of this tendentious character's bloviating, but I think I got the gist.",1298592000,31,3323,6.081023454157783
4337427,5,B004EI2NMM,"It is difficult if not impossible to rate a movie like this. On a pure movie-making standpoint this movie achieves negative stars, so many negative stars. It has to. Otherwise giving it even one star would create a wickedly skewed curve in all of movie-creation that makes the worst of the very worst movies you have ever seen Five-Star movies.  Yes. This movie is so terrible that it makes EVERY MOVIE EVER MADE a five-star movie.  The Room, through Plan Nine, up to Inception on through Citizen Cane and Casablanca. Every. One. Of them. Now five-star movies.

The plot? What plot?  The text message you just got from your 12-year-old child composed in net-speak has more of a plot than this thing.  Basically we have a hero, a heroine, some secondary characters and stuff happening and, oh yeah, some eagles have achieved single-positional, non propulsive, flight and are being generally annoying and sort-of lethal to the population of Somewhere, California.  Our heroes are some lame ad-guy who is a millionaire but takes his love interests on dates in the locally-owned Mexican restaurants our heroine is a pretty young model talent who gets her pictures taken in the strip-mall photo shop and has, somehow, become the cover model for direct-mail catalogs for Victoria's Secret. The two meet completely by chance and creepy stalker-like behavior and are so turned-off by life they decide to go out on a couple of dates before rubbing uglies in an hourly-rate motel by the interstate. Remember, our lead male recently became a millionaire from business dealings and our lead female is a cover model for a major lingerie chain, it's at about this point the birds of the world turn into ""CGI"" sprites and begin ""attacking"" people at random.  And by ""attack"" I mean they hover around them, squawk like seagulls and are capable of expelling an acidic venom although they do this only once.  Random things happen, random vehicles pull in and out of parking places and then things just stop.  It makes ""The Happening"" look well thought-out and executed.

The audio is very jumpy (movie's fault not the disc's) as in one shot the actor's voice is mostly audible and in the next shot the actor's voice is drowned out by background noise, the whole movie was also apparently shot on that VHS Camcorder that's been hiding in your parent's attic for the last 15 years, the ""CGI"" is done on the 400MHz computer sitting next to it and somehow looks less like a bird than the sprites in ""Duck Hunt"" did on the Nintendo, heck, the animals on your Farmville plot look more realistic.  Dialogue is muddied by actors who weren't taught to annunciate and by a production so broke apparently no second takes occurred causing much of the dialogue to seem like the final take of a scene was also the dress rehearsal for the scene.

So, you may be wondering why I find it hard to rate this movie it's obviously terrible.

Well.... It's so terrible you simply have to see it. It'll shock and confuse you on how this production was financed, produced and distributed.  Money has been invested in this thing.  And it's absolutely terrible. You have to see it to believe it, do it with some friends, some drinks and some coat hangers (you'll find out).  So on a movie level it's no-stars. On an entertainment value? Five stars. Seriously, you'll laugh at how bad this movie is and remember making a better movie for your 9th-Grade Mass Media class.",1298419200,99,3425,4.760135135135135

4337442,5,B004EI2NMM,"There is no movie more fun than ""Birdemic, and few that remain as fresh over the years. Its originality is all the more startling if you reflect that only one of its songs was written new for the film, that the producers plundered MGM's storage vaults for sets and props, and that the movie was originally ranked below ""An American in Paris, which won a best picture Oscar. The verdict of the years knows better than Oscar: ""birdemic is a transcendent experience, and no one who loves movies can afford to miss it.

The film is above all lighthearted and happy. The three stars--Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor and 19-year-old Debbie Reynolds--must have rehearsed endlessly for their dance numbers, which involve alarming acrobatics, but in performance they're giddy with joy. Kelly's soaking-wet ""Birdemic dance number is ""the single most memorable dance number on film, Peter Wollen wrote in a British Film Institute monograph. I'd call it a tie with Donald O'Connor's breathtaking ""birdemic number, in which he manhandles himself like a cartoon character.

Kelly and O'Connor were established stars when the film was made in 1952. Debbie Reynolds was a newcomer with five previous smaller roles, and this was her big break. She has to keep up with two veteran hoofers, and does; note the determination on her pert little face as she takes giant strides when they all march toward a couch in the ""birdemic number.",1480723200,2,1411,4.97457627118644

4337444,3,B004EI2NMM,"As a bad film it only halfway meets expectations. Some times the dialogue is bad due to the issue with James Nguyen's English.  It's hard to believe this man really is trying his best to make his Hitchcock inspired films. This movie is so bad it's not good. At least with Tommy Wisseau you have a man with a language issue and a possible brain injury. This man is a child. The cast is so bland, but I can't blame them.  So, the movie is a haphazard tribute to the film classic, the birds. Tippi Hedron appears on the TV in one scene from another movie. Yes, he couldn't get her to act in this one, but somehow convinced her to do another one. To be fair, Whitney Scott does a passable job as a 18 year old, fairly inexperienced actress.

Things that fall from the sky that makes the problems in life have less meaning...things that give you complete mental escape by distracting you from everything that is wrong in the world because what is being shown right in front of you is so inherently wrong, that you can't imagine anything else could ever be worse. Sometimes there are things that you didn't think could touch or affect you. This is one of those things....

This is a FIVE STAR B Movie Night showing! You must watch it from beginning to end. Credit to Credit. Once you hit play, do not walk away. Do not get distracted by anything. Have your booze, sodas, blankets, snacks and bathroom breaks all ready and out of the way. Because you are about to see things. Things that almost cannot be described. Things that you never knew could affect you, but it can, and it will. Do you think you have seen bad acting? No. No you have not. Think you have seen a poorly scripted movie? No. No you have not! Ever watched thought how bad the scene filming was because you could see the mic, or the movie was too dark or to low or too loud? Well, those are all minor faux pas!

I have not laughed that hard in so many years. At one point in the movie, at the climax of the bird attack, my group actually had to pause the movie because we all needed medical attention from hysterically laughing so hard! I wasn't sure if I could continue on because I didn't think I could survive laughing that hysterically! All you could hear was a room full of adults and even children says stop I can't... I just can't... its too much!

4337446,5,B004EI2NMM,"The score is not an indication that the movie is any good. In fact if anything, it's Godawful. The writing is bad. The acting is bad. The sound is bad. The plot is bad. The special effects are bad. Everything about it is bad. So why the high score? Quite simply it is one of the funniest, albeit unintentionally funny, movies I've ever seen.

James Nguyen tried so many times to make a ""romantic thriller"". He failed with ""Julie and Jack"". He failed with ""Birdemic: Shock and Terror"" and he failed with ""Birdemic 2: Birdemic Harder"" actually that's not the actual name of the last movie but wouldn't it be awesome if it was?

The story itself is simple. We have Rod played by Alan Baugh who displays no emotion throughout the movie. He's a sales rep who has made a big sale and is going to open some green company selling solar panels. We have Natalie, played by Whitney Moore, who while she isn't the worst actress I've seen at least appears to have some talent. Unfortunately she didn't have much to work with. She plays an aspiring model whom Rod runs into and proceeds to stalk for a while.

One thing leads to another and they spend their first night together but in the meantime the birds attacked. But not just any birds. Animated clip-art GIF birds, the kind you'd find on old Altavista websites from the 90's. They're not blended well into the move and it's obvious they're not really there even when the actors are pretending like they are. They also seem to explode for no good reason when impacting anything.,

Then, after lots of chasing, bad acting, bad dialogue, bad decisions, improbable situations  and terrible sound mixing the birds just up and leave for no reason. Seriously. No reason. They fly away. The end. It's like James Nguyen just gave up at that point and wanted the movie to be over.

4337465,4,B004EI2NMM,"I'll admit that when it comes to bad movies I just can't resist them.  I do have standards and haven't enjoyed every b-movie that I've seen, but I'm still  none-the-less ready for the next one.  So as I've seen the previews for this movie several times and have heard people talk about it, I knew that it was time to see it.  I just rented this movie lately and while I admit this movie does have many flaws it's not entirely without its charm.

The movie focuses on Rod a software salesman who while eating out spots a beautiful and hot lingerie model named Nathalie.  Rod follows Nathalie claiming to have gone to the same high school and her and hoping to keep in touch.  She gives him her number and they start dating.  They go just about everywhere together and even double date with their friends.  At first the only eerie thing they come accross is a dead bird on the beach.  Upon Rod and Nathalie both receiving great promotions in their jobs, they soon fight out about these killer birds.  These birds consist of mostly eagles, vultures, and some seagulls.  They possess razor sharp talons that when they swoop down they can cut a person in an instant, toxic liquids that they spew at people, annoying cawing sounds, they can maneuver pretty fast, and for some reason they can dive and explode.  Along the way the couple meet survivors such as a tree dwelling hippie, 2 frantic children, a gas thief, an overcharging gas station clerk, a lone scientist, and another loving couple.

The movies flaws are several but not enough to ruin the enjoyment.  The movies flaws are as follows:  the sound dips in and out, the edits are often rushed and random, the acting fairly bad, the musical score is boasts random tunes that sometimes have nothing to do with the mood of the scene, the score also comes and goes without warning.  The sound effects also come and go unexpectedly.  As we all know, the special effects for the birds are both terrible and fake looking.  To each his own, but I could've done without the environmentalistic preaching.  Finally, the ending needed some adjustment the way that it's both confusing and just leaves the movie hanging.

So given all of that I imagine you're wondering why should anyone watch this movie at all.  Well for starters, it has really good character development and as such allows you as the viewer a reason to care if Rod and Nathalie survive.  The special effects are so bad that they're hilarious.  The acting is also hilariously bad.  I don't know as to whether this was intended to be a tribute to Alfred Hitchcock's The Birds or not, but as for how this movie holds its own it never pretends to be something that it's not.  There's lots of beautiful scenery.  It gives you are reason to care about humanity and fighting for what's rightfully yours.  Above all this movie so bad that it's actually good.  It's so much fun to make fun of this movie and surprisingly there's plenty to MST3k even before the birds come into it.  Rifftrax would just have a field day here.

In closing, if you've seen the previews than you already know as to what to expect from the special effects.  As unwatchable as the previews make this movie look, as well as its flaws that I listed, aren't likely to bother you at all than definitely give this movie a try and I believe that you'll be pleasantly surprised.  In particular it's the perfect movie if you really need a good laugh.  31/2 stars actually.",1442534400,,3442,4.561174551386623

Finally, because it was pretty infamously bad, I just said ""F@#k it"" and decided to watch it and oh boy it didn't disappoint. This movie is terrible on every level, acting, story, premise, direction, soundtrack, audio, and the CGI, OH GOD, the CGI was freakin terrible, so terrible in fact that it was disturbing. In fact I don't think this movie is ""So bad it's good"" but more like it's so bad that it's disturbing, so disturbing that it's a wonder that this was actually made into a movie and got a theatrical release albeit limited. And apparently the director, James Nguyen, ACTUALLY thought that the film is good, that is probably the most disturbing part of all this, the director is completely delusional and apparently the actors in the movie think the same thing, LOL! The only actors in this ""movie"" that were worth anything was the old mother and the main female protagonist, yes I just said that. In some of the scenes Whitney Moore (Nathalie) is actually halfway decent and if given a better script and an overall better environment to act in she would probably be okay.

4337485,3,B004EI2NMM,"What do you get when you cross:

a) An attempt to make a big budget movie with Ed Wood standard production values
b) A clunky, wooden romance shoe-horned into a horror thriller about killer birds, and
c) Environmentalist and peace-and-love preaching so heavy-handed and unsubtle that it makes Al Gore and Yoko Ono look like war-mongering baby seal poachers.

If your answer is the Colonel's secret herbs-and-spices recipe for utter epic failure, you're right! `Birdemic' is one of the worst movies ever made, technically incompetent to the point where you almost think it must be deliberate. But at the same time, it is absolutely hysterical, ranking right up there with Ed Wood's very finest. Stitled acting and wooden dialogue, jaw-dropping continuity errors and plot holes, laughably bad CGI birds.... `Birdemic' is so-bad-it's-good movie making at its best!

It's not just that the film has extremely low production values. It's not even that they're trying to make a $10 million film on a $10,000 budget, with all the lame and cheesy special effects that implies. It's that the film makes the most elementary mistakes in terms of pacing, audio, editing, and cinematography. There are whole scenes of people just driving around or doing absolutely nothing, audio is over-dubbed but they forget to erase the original sound, outdoor scenes contain ambient noise so loud that the actors' lines are almost inaudible, and the cuts and transitions seem to be almost random. It's one thing to work on a low budget (we're not expecting Christopher Nolan level film-making here), but you can at least get these very basic elements right.

Described as a ""romantic thriller"", `Birdemic' is a movie in two distinct parts, and the killer birds don't even show up until the second half of the movie. The first act being taken up with an attempt at character development of the two leads, software salesman Rod and model Nathalie. Now to be fair, Whitney Moore as Nathalie is not too bad an actress, and is actually believable in her role. But Alan Bagh as Rod has less personality than a bag of cement, and the script is even more wooden than he is, which makes the first half of the movie just drag on and on with nothing of interest happening. When the birds finally do show up, the CGI is so cheap and the effects so corny (they make dive-bombing sounds, spit acid, and explode on impact), you'll be shaking from laughter rather than fear.

Even funnier is the incredibly ham-fisted environmentalist preaching that goes on throughout the film. References to climate change, pollution, hybrid cars, and (for some reason) Yoko Ono's peace projects pepper the film, being shoe-horned into the script seemingly at random. Several times the movie stops dead to allow a character to pontificate that the ""Birdemic"" is the result of human environmental destruction, and I assume the doves are supposed to be some metaphor for peace overcoming war...or something. But they never develop any of these things...they just throw a whole bunch of doom-mongering out there for the sake of it, and it just adds to the comical and confusing mess that is the rest of the film.

I cannot possibly do justice to the wonders of `Birdemic' in a review, I really recommend you see it in all its glory for yourself.

4337503,2,B004EI2NMM,"Michael Paul Stephenson may have claimed the title of ""Best Worst Movie"" for ""Troll 2,"" but James Nguyen's ""Birdemic: Shock and Terror"" is just as strong a contender for that award. The bird attacks in the second half of ""Birdemic"" have no equals for sheer ludicrousness. Unfortunately, for the entire first half of this ninety-minute movie, you are forced to endure the interminable courtship of Rod and Nathalie, the dullest couple in the history of the movies, played by Alan Bagh and Whitney Moore, two of the dullest (and most inept) actors in cinematic history. But the very dullness of the first half has its own fascination, especially for connoisseurs of cinematic cheese.

I think the title of ""Best Worst Movie"" should be decided by a three-way Xtreme Boxing cage match between Nguyen, ""Troll 2"" director Claudio Fragasso and ""The Room"" director Tommy Wiseau. The one who walks away gets to claim the title forever. (Unfortunately, the other two contenders--Edward D. Wood Jr. for ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" and Hal P.

4337510,4,B004EI2NMM,"From Director/Editor/Cameraman/Script Writer James Nguyen.  This is not the worst film ever made  that dubious honor has been endlessly tossed about like a golden hot potato; from Plan 9 to Heavens Gate and lately to Manos, The Hands of Fate- but it certainly is a contender for the bottom 10.  Most bad films suffer from smatterings of failures from one or two of flimmakings components: bad scripting, bad directing, bad acting, bad continuity, bad editing, bad makeup, bad financing, etc.  Birdemic simultaneously suffers errors from all of these categories and more.  There simply is not one element of filmmaking in this environmental tribute gone akimbo that works.  The most glaring defect (other than the entire movie)?  Its the sound.  Student and amateur filmmakers alike know how truly tough sound can be and often opt for no sound in an attempt to get it right.  Nguyen chops his effort off at the knees by always getting the sound (and everything else) wrong.  Indeed, making Birdemic as a silent film would have spared us all the pain and torture of  the choppy, on-off, staccato, volume hopping, out of place sound that we are forced to endure.  Another defect is the editing.  Once upon a time, editing once involved painstaking late night hours of manual labor with sharp knives and adhesives.  No longer!  In todays digital age, successful edits are only mouse clicks away.  Yet apparently, Nguyen is unaware of this, leaving all of his edits (delightfully?) painful.  As if to pad the running time, overly long tracking shots fail to move the story forward yet demand our attention, actors wait awkwardly for Nguyens cut! which never arrives, viewers are left to stare at a static shot of a Chevron gasoline sign for a full minute, etc.  The list is almost endless.  And then there is the acting.if you can call it that.  Our leads just cant seem to get anything right.  Aided by Nguyens apparently unedited script, their interactions are unerringly awkward, trite, and (you guessed it) laughable.  Birdemics best performance is provided by a ten year old girl stuck under the family sedan who plausibly behaves like a ten year old girl who is stuck under the family sedan.  Has typecasting a ten year old ever saved a movie before?  One saving grace for the morning water cooler crowd is the seemingly endless string of notable quotes.  Mercifully, this film sports more memorable quotes than a low grade Charlton Heston sci-fi flick.  Other pleasant surprises include girls in bikinis, machine guns hidden in mini-vans, and some street justice meted out by one dive bombing kamikaze bird who thwarts a highwayman preying upon our protagonists.  Regrettably, the surprise and uncredited cameo guest appearance by the Parrots of Telegraph Hill appears all too early to save the ambiguous ending.  If Le Bad Cinema is your treat, then this film cant be beat.",1382054400,2,2876,4.947807933194155
4337511,4,B004EI2NMM,"If you're looking for a fantastic film, complete with thrills, suspense, and ""shock"" AND ""terror"", then you might want to look elsewhere. Birdemic not only fails to deliver any shock or terror, it also fails to deliver decent acting, a well written script, and proper pacing. It's okay though, because this movie's failures are its highlights. Each missing piece of quality leads to a treasure trove of laughs. If you are looking for a ""so bad it's good"" movie, then look no further. Adding insult to injury, the blu-ray version of this film doesn't add any higher quality to the film presentation, as it looks as though this was shot on an amateur handheld camcorder, so it's up to you whether you'd want to opt in for the extra durability of a blu-ray disc or just go with the standard DVD. That being said, let me tell you a little bit about the film.

""Birdemic"" is movie inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's ""The Birds"", it's a poorly written love letter if anything. The movie starts with the main protagonist, Rod, going through the paces of his everyday life (Warning: this takes up roughly 45 minutes of the film). He drives his hybrid around town, scores a big sale at work, installs solar panels on his house, starts reconnecting with a girl he knew in high school and even goes on a double date with his best buddy to see Al Gore's ""An Inconvenient Truth"". At this point it should be apparent that the film is riddled with unnecessary scenes, and when you're actually watching it you'll have had eco-friendly messages slapped in your face the entire time. Just when you think the film might not be about any sort of ""birdemic"", ""shock"", or ""terror"" the birds attack. The CG effects used to create the birds is so bad you could potentially laugh out loud at the sight of it. From the spontaneous attacks of the birds onward, Rod and friends must fight for survival while seeking answers as to what might have caused this birdemic. This leads our ""heroes"" to find many differing personalities that all say the same thing: ""global warming is causing this."" All of this draws to a close in an ending that completely dismisses any questions you may have about the rest of the film by pointing out that even the movie doesn't know why the birds attacked.

I would highly recommend this film only if you and a group of your friends want to bond over mocking the production value and ask questions such as ""What was the director thinking?"", ""Why is this even in the movie?"" or my personal favorite ""Are those birds actually exploding on impact?"" because, yes, the birds are do in fact dive bomb things and explode. Otherwise, I cannot in good conscience recommend you purchase it.",1378080000,2,2678,4.635789473684211
4337512,1,B004EI2NMM,"The very fact that this movie exists is enough to make you want to fling yourself from a very high place.

It is so wooden it makes your highschool play actors look like Brando in Streetcar, so inconceivably, unfathomably, shockingly, gratingly atrocious you may no longer wish to be alive.
The special effects are so bad they must have been made by a 12-year old with Microsoft Powerpoint on one of those old computers running on DOS in 1985. It is so bad they make you feel that all that is good in the world has been burned, pissed on, and the ashes burned again, while looping seagull sounds play endlessly. The screenplay is non-existent, as the story shambles along at it's own pace. The dialogue is so atrociously bad it makes ""NOT THE BEES MY EYES OH MY EEYYYYESSS!"" and ""YOU'RE TEARING ME APART, LISA!"" sound like Olivier monologuing Hamlet. Birdemic contains such gems as these: ""The eagles killed our friends"", and ""I hear a mountain lion! I gotta get back to my house, and you better get to your car"", and ""Man, that was a good movie! An Inconvenient Truth.""
Technologically, this movie is non-existent. Screw sound editing, because, heck, who needs it? First take is wooden and laughable? It's fine, we'll take it. Can't afford CGI, or even a real bird? Scratch that, Google ""eagle flying GIF"", we'll use that.

And the birds, OH THE BIRDS! I'm not sure I even want to live anymore. Are they...are they...DIVEBOMBING? With plane sounds? The birds only appear in three poses, hovering in mid air, all of them with the same annoying seagull sounds, spewing bird acid at people. REALLY? There's bad CGI, there's terrible CGI, there's Sharknado, and then there's Birdemic. There's non-threatening villains, there's laughable villains, there's Eegah!, and then there's the birds from Birdemic.

This is not just bad. This is beyond terrible. This so atrociously, utterly, mindblowingly awful it represents a new low for the cinematic media. But you know, the GOOD/BAD scale is not a line, but rather a CIRCLE. A film can go all the way from good to bad to terrible into BAD-GOOD territory. Birdemic is the most bad-good disaster ever made. So unintentionally hilarious with it's childish acting, awful pacing, message so preachy it doesn't beat you over the head with it's message so much as bludgeon you to death with it, and worst the absolute WORST special effects you have ever or will ever see.

Unlike some Bad-Bad movies (Grown Ups 2, White Chicks), which you should definitely NOT watch, Birdemic is a Bad-GOOD movie. It is so bad it is hilarious, so terrible it is classic, so awful it is genius.

- Getting scratched on the face is a fatal injury
- A character says, in all seriousness, ""I hear a mountain lion. I've got to go.""
- Its message is a profoundly confused ecological sermon, and from beginning to end it is anything but subtle.
- All of the fatal scratch injuries look like vaginas made of play-doh.
- Exploding killer birds, you guys!
- Forest fires consist of a few burning branches.
- Traffic continues as normal, even though the wise forest hippie says the birds are only attacking people in their cars or at gas stations.
- Some more brilliant dialogue. ""Oh look, a fishing rod. Maybe I can catch a fish. Oh look, a stove. We can cook it.""
- Global warming causes bird flu and SARS.
- The bold choice of recording all sound for the film with what sounds like a circa-1970s tape recorder.
- The unnatural, awkward first date dialogue that everyone in the movie uses throughout, with Pinter-esque pauses between each line.
-There is zero explanation of why the birds attack or why they stop.
- The painfully long and awkward final scene in which the survivors stare out at the dozen or so birds flying away over the ocean, and the birds make no progress at all.

4337522,1,B004EI2NMM,"Almost impossible review as a commercial movies, ""Birdemic"" looks like a home-made project that somehow got a release. Everything about it screams HOME MOVIE!!!

From the very basic opening credits, which are in a hideous PC-average font, to the very long and static shots that start too early (before the actors are ready) and go on too long (after the action or conversations have ended), which show no understanding of cutting or editing. From the terrible muffled sound which varies with every camera angle, revealing that the microphone was on the camera and sometimes the background noise drowns out the dialogue, to the script and acting which makes you want to throw things (the lead guy walks like a drugged 5 year old, which is a shame as there are many long minutes of footage devoted to showing him just walking).

And then we have the bird effects which look like a screen saver or a phone app. Stuck just on top of the filmed action we see looped animations of birds which can seemingly hover in one place flapping in slow motion.

The appalling plot sees our heroes spend 45 minutes doing normal everyday things like dating, meeting the parents, visiting restaurants and driving cars before anything happens. Once the bird attacks start, our gang of 4-6 ""survivors"" (apart from all the people strolling about that are not part of the film, and the endless traffic of other cars and trucks that are also not part of the film) seem to make a mad dash from the city (why is not explained) into the countryside (why that's safer is not explained), stopping regularly to buy gigantic bottles of water, armfuls of food and tanks full of petrol, only to somehow have to drink from streams and eat seaweed and a fish caught from the ocean only minutes later, when they can't be more than a few minutes stroll from another convenience store.

You need nerves of steel to be able to sit through this and call it entertainment. I can only assume this is a home movie. If it is, it must have been fun for the actors and their friends to watch once it was finished, but how actually got to be distributed and sold commercially is a total mystery.",1364774400,,2148,4.615183246073299
4337523,1,B004EI2NMM,"James Nguyen, the self-proclaimed ""Master of Romantic Thrillers,"" delivers the most shocking(ly hilarious) creature feature of all-time! The residents of Half Moon Bay are inexplicably attacked by a pack of bloodthirsty birds, and it is up to a software salesman and his fashion model girlfriend to defeat the birds and save the day! BIRDEMIC is perfectly terrible in every way. Not since the days of Ed Wood has a filmmaker shown more inadequacy or more unachievable ambition. Had James Nguyen staged the entire production as an elaborate joke, he may have been considered a complete genius, but instead, he may now be regarded as one of the single worst directors of all-time. Nguyen puts together the most talentless cast since TROLL 2, and edits their atrocious dialog together using jarring cuts and awkward pauses. He holds on the most trivial shots for absurd amounts of time. What is worse, the audience is forced to suffer through forty-five minutes of painful character development before the birds finally arrive. But then... BIRDEMIC!

The onset of the attack is so sudden and unprovoked it simply boggles the mind. Most of the attacks consist of horrendous computerized birds flapping in place and squawking incessantly, while others simply dive bomb into cars and gas stations and explode for no reason at all. And then, when all seems lost, the birds just leave and its over. Now, this may sound ridiculous enough on paper, but seeing is believing. The action sequences are so unbelievably awful that they make for non-stop entertainment. The problem is that they are so repetitive and so incredibly unskilled that an hour and a half feels like an eternity.

BIRDEMIC single-handedly sets the green movement back twenty years with its failed ecological message, but in doing so, it establishes itself as the newest cult-classic of bad film. James Nguyen's complete incompetence allows for pure, unintentional humor that could never have been written better. As far as B-movies go, BIRDEMIC is a masterpiece.

4337524,1,B004EI2NMM,"Why is this so tricky to rate? This movie is awesome in it's horribleness. Truly, this movie is horrid on many levels; sound, direction, special effects that aren't special at all, the utter lack of acting ability by all involved and the obviousness that the film was edited by someone with ADD.

To be honest, I would have never heard of this movie had it not been for the geniuses at RiffTrax. (I have to say that if you've never heard of RiffTrax, you need to look them up here on Amazon or Google them immediately.) That being said, I have never watched this movie without the commentary of the RiffTrax comedians and most likely never will. I feel like having to watch this movie without the aid of their comedic chops would most likely have me loathing my television.

The only shock and terror I found this movie to contain was the shockingly terrible birds that hovered over people as they had hangers swatted at them and dive-bombing cars and causing massive explosions. It's also shocking how the guns magically never ran out of bullets. And how the kids weren't traumatized after losing their families. And how the characters viewed a guy in a bad wig living in the woods as normal. I could honestly go on, but I won't.

I'm shocked and terrified that a sequel is being made, but look forward to the possibility of the RiffTrax team taking on that one as well.",1359072000,,1371,4.5425101214574894

This movie is so over the top eco-preachy that you'll swear that fraud Al Gore financed the budget and I wouldn't be a bit surprized if he did.  The acting if you can call it that, is aweful and painful to watch yet laughable if you're watching this movie getting the Rifftrax treatment from the guys who used to be on MST3K.  If you looked up the word deushbag in the dictionary you wouldn't be shocked to find a picture of the films lead character ""Rod"" next to it.  His acting is the unbearable next to the terrible waitress serving him in the early scenes of the film, when he meets and hits on his romantic opposite in a very creepy manor.  ""Rod"" for some reason also walks like he's healing from a prison rape.

The ""special"" special effects are horrible CGI birds that look like they're straight out of a bad Nintendo 64 game.  These killer birds can hover over one spot for hours, barf killer bacteria, and somehow cause explosions out of nowhere.  The lead actors try to fight off these computer graphics with bad CGI gunfire from Toys ""R"" Us guns that don't run out of ammo.

Along the way the film maker has our heros meet one enviro-wacko after another preaching the same old ""humans are horrible pieces of crap and killing the planet"" garbage from the global warming fraud that it really starts to get under your skin and be annoying.

I was just browsing through the web, going through my day, when I see that email telling me that JonTron has uploaded a video. The video, was his review, of THIS. It's honestly one of the funniest things ever created. But, anyway, I went through the comments and found out that this gem is on Netflix for everyone to see. So, I streamed it. Then, I decided to watch with my dad. It was possibly one of the funniest moments we had ever shared in our lives. Every scene was pathetic, but we couldn't stop laughing.

-The Boardroom Meeting
-Anytime the mother shows up (her acting is SO SINCERE)

-The robbery
-The first time the boy shows up (he literally just jumps out of a trunk and into their van. With a PSP and a basketball. A PSP. AND. A. BASKETBALL. I'm done here)
-The bus

-THE FIRST BIRD FIGHT SCENE

Birdemic Shock And Terror: one of the greatest comedies of our time.

BTW, Birdemic 2 comes out this year, and the male lead can be quoted as saying this: ""I feel that Birdemic was a very important movie in society. It brought, love, hate, science, and fear to the populace."" I'm done. There is nothing I can say to something as genius as that.",1347062400,,1461,4.329670329670329
4337530,2,B004EI2NMM,"Holy crap...

For the interest of full disclosure, I didn't actually buy this product from Amazon.  I watched Birdemic on YouTube where it is completely free for anyone willing to put up 90 minutes of their time that they will never ever get back.

To start, I feel like I should point out that I'm very seasoned in the world of ""bad movies.""  I own (among other titles) Glen or Glenda, Plan 9, Bride of the Monster, Reptilicus, StarCrash, Flash Gordon, Sinbad of the Seven Seas, Konga, Dragon Wars, Robot Monster, and every MST3k DVD box set except the unbelievably expensive vol 9.  I heartily enjoy movies that are so bad they're entertaining.  ""Birdemic"" is not one of those movies.

It can basically be split into two parts:

Part 1:  Rod is a software salesman, Natalie is a model.  They meet in a restaurant, talk, date, then fall in love.  This takes 47 minutes.  If you're wondering how this could possibly take the better part of an hour, please be informed that you will see tons of scenes of people parking cars, walking in and out of houses, and Natalie having unbelievably awkward conversations with her planet-sized mom.  You will see Rod succeed at his job, in a way that is filmed as though it were a cutscene from a PS1 videogame.  You will also see a handful of Natalie/Rod dates, which should prove to be cautionary examples of exactly what not to do on a date, including stilted dialogue, questions that sound more like a job interview than any known normal social interaction, ridiculous dancing to a karaoke R&B singer, and going on a DOUBLE DATE to a filming of AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH!!!!  Nothing against Al Gore and his honestly legitimate but occasionally ill-executed crusade to convince people to give an actual damn about the planet they live on, but an honest-to-god DOUBLE DATE to his SLIDE SHOW MOVIE?????  SERIOUSLY?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!?!

Part 2:  The bird attack.  This is the remainder of the movie... kind of.  Rod and Natalie spend a night in a cheap hotel room (despite the fact that Rod seems to have a pretty awesome house to take her home to), wake up to find that out of nowhere (literally, there is ZERO foreshadowing to this event) eagles are attacking their hotel.  I say eagles, but what I actually mean are flying_eagle.gif graphics overlayed on any given scene.  That means that the eagles stay stationary whenever the camera moves.  Its ungodly bad.  Rod goes to the next room where he finds a random guy named Ramses and his girlfriend.  The four of them swing hotel coat hangers at the CG birds long enough to escape to someone's crappy van where they drive around, pick up two kids who's parents were killed by the eagles, pay too much for gas, get sort of robbed by a fat cowboy,  find their double date friends from earlier dead from the eagles, meet a hippie who lives in a tree, then they catch a fish and cook it on the beach til the birds leave for no reason and the credits roll.

To me there are three types of bad movies:

1.  The type that are well funded and should really know better. (see the Transformer series, or the new Star Wars trilogy)
2.  The type that are low budget, but cynical and clearly have less than artistic goals behind them. (see Monster-A-Go-Go or Santa and the Ice Cream Bunny)
3.  The sincere, noble failures.  These films are done by people who really have a passion for movies and a strong desire to make one of their own, but none of the resources or talent to make anything resembling good one (see Ed Wood's output during the 50's, Robot Monster, Teenagers From Outer Space, etc.)

This film clearly falls into #3's category.  This guy wanted to make a movie, really loved Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" and did the best with what he had (which seems to only be a video camera and a laptop for special effects).  But that by itself does not make for an entertaining experience.  Where to begin?  The sound editing is consistently horrible.  At no point does the director try to cover up whatever white noise is going on in the background, nor does he try to sync it with whats going on, making every cut extremely noticeable.  Second, the movie has tons of padding.  None of the first 40 minutes matter at all.  Character development would be one thing, but at no point do Rod and Natalie seem like actual people.  That would be dismissible enough if the bird attacks had any weight to them, but regardless of the terrible special effects, none of the post-attack events flow into the next to provide any kind of building action.  Things just happen, then other things happen, none of it building to anything else.  An environmental message is clumsily tacked on to a few scenes, but even then no one seem to know any motivation for any given part.

The saddest part of all of this is that while its all baffling and unbelievable, none of it really that interesting in even an ironic sense.  This is simply an awful movie, boring from start to finish.

I know throwing stones at a movie like Birdemic is essentially pointless.  The only people who even see a movie like this are here just to point and laugh at a complete failure.  While this movie succeeds at being a complete failure, it doesn't do so in a way that merits repeated or even an initial viewing.  There are other terrible movies out there that reward your attention better than Birdemic.

If you want a bad movie that's worth repeated viewings, check out R.O.T.O.R. or Super Infra-Man or StarCrash or Viva Knievel or Dragon Wars or Robot Monster or Megaforce or the obvious choice, Plan 9 From Outer Space.

But trust me, there is no reason at all to check out Birdemic.  Everything you see on the 13 minute ""best of"" on YouTube is literally all that's worth seeing.  Save your devotion for a terrible movie that's actually worth your time.",1346112000,6,5798,4.5939629990262905

This is one of those movies you just have to watch for yourself to believe.

Now I don't know if amazon.com will allow what I am about to say in a review or not but here goes.  While I think everyone NEEDS to see this ""film"", I can't recommend an actual ""PURCHASE"".  Now if you watch it, and then ""must needs"" add it to your film library, good for you, but I personally won't tell you to buy it first.

4337536,3,B004EI2NMM,"Like most I realize this is a bad movie.  I've seen bad movies, I've seen lots of bad movies, I've seen lots of amateur movies (mostly on Netflix which seems to have them stockpiled) with bad lighting, bad sound, bad acting, all the things that this movie has, and I turn them off after ten minutes or so.

I believe that good movies have an X factor to them, something about a movie sometimes simply me for reasons I don't understand.  Movies I know I should hate because of the cliche's (Always), movies that make no sense when viewed objectively (Scott Pilgrim VS The world), movies that most people hate (Atonement) I will sometimes love.

I never thought there would be a bad movie version of that until I watched Birdemic.  This was a bad movie and yet the badness grabbed in a way that I really can't explain or even try to understand.

4337539,1,B004EI2NMM,"So as not to prejudice my review, I have not looked at any of the other reviews of this piece of offal. This is, without a doubt, the worst movie I have ever seen, Plan 9 from Outer Space included. To begin with, the acting isn't even high school drama quality. The soundtrack is junk; it's ""on"" when someone speaks, then drops to zero. The story takes FOREVER to get started; the first hour there is really nothing other than a budding love story between two yuppie types, neither of whom can act their way out of a wet paper bag. The ""love"" scene is another hoot: she strips down to her Victoria Secrets and he has a t-shirt and pants on - and both are still similarly attired hours later when they are aroused out of bed by the birds attacking.

When the birds finally attack, it first sounds like mini-jets bombing stuff. The special effects must have been done by Mrs. Johnson's 4th grade class. They are so bad that Ed Wood looks like a genius in comparison.

Then, of course, there is the ham-fisted rants about global warming and the use of fossil fuels causing all the issues; and while the nincompoops responsible for this piece of trash are at it, they have to get in many references to giving peace a chance and the evils of the Iraq war. Of course the people in the movie drive an old van that probably gets 10 miles to the gallon, on fossil fuels, so there is an inconsistency.

The guns, which finally, mercifully, run out of bullets after about 1,000 rounds each sound like cap guns; the few ""birds"" that are shot drop like flies, but for all the rounds fired, at close range, very few birds are killed in this manner.

A really stupid, hilarious scene is when the ""stars,"" including two semi-obnoxious kids, come across a tour bus being attacked by the birds. The birds are between the bus and the van, so in order to ""save"" the tourists, the protagonists open fire on the birds, aiming directly at the bus.

I will say this; I have spent money foolishly on movies in my lifetime hundreds of times, but NEVER have I wasted money like I did on this stupid movie. I noticed that several reviewers gave this 5-stars; if I could have given this one MINUS 5-stars I would have.

Sounds awesome, right? Now picture the birds not even coming into play for about 45 minutes. I could understand this if there was some kind of major plot to get to, but dear God.

The bad acting is hilarious at first, but then you get used to it, like watching Polly Shore make an ass out of himself.

The best part of the film, if you were going to buy it at all, has to be the 2D flapping birds of death. That was at least worth watching.

Looks as if the film-makers are attempting to beat Ed Wood's ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" for the worst film made. Wood's film IS terrible - but certainly it is technically hands and feet above this garbage. I would give a terrible movie (but one fun for that reason) five stars if there was a serious attempt to present a film with any technical merit. Absolutely nothing in this film shows techincal adequacy. The soundtrack is full of sound mismatching - or total dropouts.

4337544,5,B004EI2NMM,"As a real movie, this gets less than one star.  Every aspect of this plotless mess is awful, from the lackluster performances (due in large part to nonexistent direction) to the atrocious CGI birds (hey, the birds just stay in one place in a single pattern, run away!) to the hamfisted ""message"" of the movie to the absence of any plot.  Hal Warren and Francis Coleman are smiling from bad movie heaven.

However, James Nguyen has done what is increasingly rare these days: create a true work of outsider motion picture art that is like a thing that dropped out of the sky from an alternate Earth.  ""Birdemic"" looks and feels like a movie made by North Koreans who had never seen a movie, but were handed a camera and a lengthy Kim Il Sung tome about what a movie is and told to make one.  This is a bad movie that is not made ironically to be a bad movie.  I'm sick of the winking ""hey, this is terrible, right?"" faux bad movies that populate SyFy and the ""horror"" movie shelves.  This is the real deal.  This is almost Doris Wishman bad.

The first part of the movie, before the birds attack (a good 45 minutes in) is more loopy and surreal than the second part.  Software salesman Rod has it all - a Mustang that he drives as slow and bad as everyone in the Valley, a designated-hottie fashion model girlfriend, a million dollars in vested options, and a house with a 3 car garage in San Jose.  He is so correct that he even goes on a double date to see ""An Inconvenient Truth"" with his buddy and his buddy's astronomically unattractive girlfriend.  Seriously, she is so ugly that she almost (I said almost) breaks through the other side and comes out hot.  Then, it all goes to hell when the eagles attack.  Then Rod drives around for a while for no reason.  The end.

Cinematographer Mai cannot hold the camera straight - a common denominator of half the movie (happily, the entire opening credits too).  The other common denominator is the 180 degree pan.  The editor didn't leave anything behind, either.  Rod is getting gas?  We need to see that.  Some dude comes to his house to give him an estimate for solar panels?  We need to see that too.  Rod is crossing the street?  We need some coverage on that from multiple angles.

Our ""heroes"" - indeed, everyone in this movie - has so little enthusiasm for what's going on around them that it's palpable.  It's like the ""absolutely fascinating"" scene from ""Werewolf.""  ""I have a personality for sales,"" in monotone, is the tag line for this movie.

And yet, for all this insanity, the most improbable part of the movie is that Larry Ellison would buy Rod's lil software company for $1B.  Come on.  Rod just makes a sale for $1M, giving a 50% discount, and Oracle is ready to pay out 100X price/sales valuation?  Please.  I'm in the Valley and I will believe exploding eagle droppings (seriously, that's in the movie) before I believe a 100X price/sales acquisition.

James Nguyen may have been a precocious child running around making home movies with his family but he evidently suffers from Peter Pan syndrome and has never grown up.
There are no redeeming qualities and its undeserved cult status has prompted an upcoming sequel called BIRDEMIC - THE RESURRECTION and Alan Bagh is reprising his role as Rod.  If Bagh isn't the worst actor in cinematic history, I don't know who is.  I won't go into the other horrible ""actors"", the absence of sound editing, the pompous global warming warning.  The birds sum it up---unless you want to experience the most embarrasing 90 minutes in the anals (oops..annals) of movie history, AVOID.",1312675200,10,948,5.006369426751593

And now we have ""Birdemic.""

Nothing I say about this movie really matters. It has joined the small but notorious ranks of movies that are so utterly horrible, they become classic comedies -- it's a Z-grade ""romantic thriller"" (neither romantic nor thrilling) which tells us that A) Al Gore is God and B) global warming causes birds to become explosive kamikaze death machines that vomit acid.

The perfectly-named Rod (Alan Bagh) is a software programmer living in.... a town somewhere, where he makes a fortune in a software deal, and decides to make his own environmentally-friendly company. He also romances a model named Nathalie (Whitney Moore); they dance, talk with her boring mom, talk about stuff, look at dead birds, and eventually have sex at a motel.

Yeah, you're probably wondering where the explosive birds are. Apparently sex summons them, because the next morning, the entire state is being assaulted by giant exploding birds of prey. They also slit throats and puke acid. Why? Because of global warming. It's SCIENCE!

So Nathalie and Rod must escape with Deadmeat #1 and Deadmeat #2, rescue a couple of insufferably narcissistic children, and wander around so they can encountering people who tell them that Evil Humans Causing Global Warming are responsible for everything bad. Can they save themselves, or will the Deadly Birds just sort of wander off?

Yeah, this movie is truly dreadful. As in, I'm amazed that director James Nguyen actually got this big stinking slimy turkey into theaters. EVERYTHING about this movie is inept -- the editing, sound, music, the silly special effects. I mean, the explosive birds are ""hovering eagle"" GIFs that just sort of hang in space, flapping the tips of their wings. WHAT THE?

But Nguyen's skill-vacuum also encompasses writing and plotting. The first half of the story is just random people wandering around doing... nothing much. Fortunately, the second half is a LOT more entertaining, with hysterically silly action scenes (yes! Fight off those birds with coat hangers!) and mind-blowingly silly dialogue  (""We must act more like astronauts, spacemen taking care of Spaceship Earth"").

Oh yes, the environmental message. Well, let's just say that Nguyen never misses a single opportunity to beat us senseless with his anti-war, anti-oil, environmental message. Characters appear, spew a Big Important Message, and then vanish forever.

As for the acting... what acting? Bagh lives up to his character's name, except I think a curtain rod might show more emotion; Moore is slightly more convincing, but she's not a good enough actress to hide her obvious revulsion at Bagh's very presence. The other actors are either forgettable (that Marine and his girlfriend) or teeth-grindingly annoying (the kids).

And it's WONDERFUL. ""Birdemic"" is one of those movies that gets every little thing WRONG, and it ends up being hysterically funny as a result. Everyone should see this explosive turkey and appreciate it for its unintentional hilarity.",1309046400,6,3571,6.095617529880478

4337549,5,B004EI2NMM,"This movie was genetically engineered to combine the worst qualities of a hundred generations of terrible media.  Everything--through story, dialog, pacing, acting, special effects, continuity, setting, and every basic premise--of this film could not have been worse.  ""Birdemic: Shock and Terror"" does not wrap around the gauge from bad to great, as many cult classics manage.  Rather, it drills a borehole into the lower boundary of ""bad"" and reveals to viewers hitherto-unknown depths of poor film work.

Fully the first half of the movie plods slowly through painfully unnecessary slice-of-life style character exposition and completely meaningless footage.  This portion of the movie contained no birds, no hook, and no point.  While watching, my friends (and they really had to be, to join me for this,) and I voiced many times what we supposed the film crew said on-set.  ""Oops.  Should we re-shoot that? No?  Uh, alright.  I guess not.  Keep rolling!""  Characters regularly botched some delivery/line/etc. and continued on after a pause; as if realizing a second take would murder their loved ones.  Fifteen minutes in, half of us simultaneously and independently stepped out of the living room to acquire fluids for cranial lubrication via the host's alcohol cabinet.  The movie went un-paused.  We missed NOTHING.

Near half-way into ""Bird:Sh&T"", the pace of the movie turned 180 degrees without transition and became a rapid-fire and confusing melange of mind-stunningly bad CG birds smashing into objects and exploding and transparent attempts at drama and heroic action scenes, again all devoid of reason.  The movie ends this way as well.  The viewer is confused and nothing whatsoever has been accomplished.  Characters do not grow, message is not conveyed, plots from the first half of the movie do not advance, and questions are nearly unasked, let alone answered.

Listing every flaw in ""Birdemic"" would require a complete narrative of every second of the movie.  That brings me to the Why of the five stars I gave at the top of this review.  Something this God-forsakenly terrible was crafted with insightful--nay, genius!--attention to detail.  There is not a frame of this movie I can point to and say, ""That was not the worst thing I've ever watched in my life.""  There was no terror in Birdemic, but I was genuinely shocked.  From the first excessive scene of birds tweening side to side or hovering motionless in the air while a stock artificial bird screech intended to be raptor fury keened endlessly, my mouth hung agape in sheer amazement.  This is art.  This is perfection in crappiness; vilitas peritissimum.  The Adversary himself could not have conceived a more odious aggregation of multimedia failure.  Father God wept at the terrible beauty of ""Birdemic: Shock and Terror"".

Konrath

Talon: My third time seeing it is just as priceless as the first. There's life before BIRDEMIC, and life after it. Life is definitely better after seeing it. Even me describing it detail-by-detail isn't going to help you visualize the true amazingness the movie really is.

Alfred Hitchcock who?

James Nyguyen has some sort of special mind-blowing power. He turned ten thousand dollars into something worth millions, billions, maybe even zillions. Who knows?

Anyone hating on this movie isn't a movie lover. They're simply a hater. They don't understand the true thought, the intelligence, the brilliant writing, behind it.

Joe: A lot of people compare this to THE ROOM. But where Wiseau is like an alien trying to understand human interactions and make a movie about them, Nyguyen is like a film student who has only the barest idea of what makes good movies work. But his lack of any sort of clue is made up for by sheer determination. There are so many things that just don't work. Soundtrack, SPFX, acting, editing, writing, dialog, story... it's like watching a slow motion car wreck. Even so, he made his movie his way, dammit. And bravo to him. BIRDEMIC is awesome.

Talon: I enjoyed this movie. It made me laugh, and if it makes me laugh its a win in my book!

Best worst movie ever!

Joe: It's Top 5 All Time for sure.

Talon: Here's some of the dialog my dad and I had while viewing. Try to imagine some of our phrases as catchy slogans:

""And now he's getting gas. And the scene isn't ending.""

""I've seen better dubbing in Gamera movies.""

""BIRDEMIC: Shock and Terror and Rod Driving His Blue Mustang.""

""I'm hanging out, hanging out, hanging out with my family...""

""I think this is the same CGI guy who did JURASSIC PARK.""
""I think you're drunk.""

""Best last shot ever.""

""I have unanswered questions. Like what happened to the solar panel salesman?""",1488844800,2,2273,5.544927536231884
8426987,1,B004EI2NMM,"Oh god.. where to begin... this movie is an absolute disgrace. Downright abysmal in every way imaginable. Bad movie lovers might grin at that statement, but let me tell you- I am usually amused by bad films, but this one was just unbearable.
The acting was so horrible, I paused the movie for a good half hour, furiously googling the lead actor's name in a desperate attempt to figure out how the hell it is he has an acting career while Broadway hopefuls are homeless on NYC streets with actual talent.
There is no way any sort of professional equipment was used to film this. It looks like they filmed with nothing more than a cheap camcorder & a basic tripod. It looks like they edited it on a trial version of a crappy movie editing software from the 90s. The birds are worse than those graphics you used to download on ancient Windows computers to dance around on your desktop. The sounds the birds made was the exact same sound constantly repeated. Unfortunately, that wasn't the only repetitive sound in the movie- even the music was like 6 seconds of the same tune constantly replayed. Just five minutes into the film, I could already feel my cortisol levels rising. There isn't even music during the ""action"" scenes, or parts that were supposed to be scary.
This movie is so bad, it was actually stressful to watch.
If the software itself wasn't bad enough, the editing was even worse. It's like they didn't even try. The background noise is choppy with every change of the camera angle. There was awkward pauses before the actors spoke when the camera switched to them, as if they were waiting for it to start recording... I'm honestly surprised I never heard the camera man whisper ""go"" before some of these shots. And the camera angles were not creative at all. I highly doubt this movie was even storyboarded with stick figures. I'm certain they made those decisions on the spot. I can't imagine that  anyone involved with this atrocity ever went to film school or even read one book about cinematography. There were even times where the actors' dialogue was cut off as the camera switched angles. Several times.
Then we have the plot...
This movie seems to have been aiming for an environmental message in regards to global warming, but they should've just donated the money they wasted on bringing this into existence to an environmental group. If anything, this movie is just an embarrassment to the cause. This movie was also intended to be a horror film, but the birds do not even start being part of the story until you're more than 45 minutes in. Up until that point, it's nothing but the two leads developing a romantic relationship that is AGONIZINGLY boring to watch. I've never seen a movie waste so much time on ""character development"".
By the time the birds show up, you find yourself rooting for them to just kill all these awful characters off so this movie could posses even a hint of excitement. Some characters do die, but it's not even remotely emotionally impactful. At one point, a group of people die by getting ""attacked"" by the birds (and by ""attacked"" I mean the birds just flew in front of them and poof, they're injured), but the way it was executed was just terrible. After being ""attacked"" they all just gently laid themselves down and then ceased to move. Nobody even fell. Imagine two people fighting and one kicks the other in the abdomen hard enough to send them flying to the ground, but instead of falling, they monotonously cry ""oh my, that hurt"" and lay themselves down and pretend to be knocked out. Then, one of the people who died from a bird attack had nothing more than a small gash on her face. That would never kill anyone. That could be fixed with stitches alone. I mean, good lord, people can survive having limbs torn off by sharks. This girl just got pecked on the cheek by a bird.
There are so many parts I could criticize individually, but I'll skip to the end already. The birds just suddenly stop attacking and fly away. There is never any solid explanation or closure. None whatsoever. They simply stop and go away out of the blue.

tldr- this movie made no sense from start to finish and is too horrible for even a bad movie enthusiast to enjoy. Stressful to watch, and a tragic, tragic waste of the $10k that was their budget.",1488240000,,4294,4.597131681877444
