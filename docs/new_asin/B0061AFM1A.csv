8490754,1,B0061AFM1A,"to a series that has everything wrong with it.
Guess expectation is the sister of disappointment. Bad performance, bad sound, bad direstion, bad everything.",1361404800,,156,5.541666666666667
8490755,5,B0061AFM1A,I really like this TV show.  The story lines are good.  The only thing is that they should have put the whole season on one dvd.  I still bought all 3 dvds.,1358553600,,156,3.8125
8490756,5,B0061AFM1A,"I purchased what they called they original pilot back many years ago and was shocked when they returned several years later with almost the same cast. I just heard they were picked up for a full season for Outtv in Canada. I hope they stay around for awhile, I just purchased episodes 3 &4 and I have to say it gets better with every episode.",1348617600,,342,4.276923076923077
8490757,4,B0061AFM1A,"Wow! Peter Fraser is the Rex Reed of Austraila. If you look at all his reviews...he doesn't like much.
Obviously a not so successful actor who, rather than teach, went into reviewing(or tearing apart) others work. Dude, it's a gay soap opera....not Gone With The Wind and the acting is so much better than some of the shows on Logo or that campy, over the top series Dante's Cove that was on a few seasons ago.
<<Lots of brief scenes involving too many people to enable you to be able to keep up with them.>> I didn't have a problem...I ""kept up"" with with everyone.
There were some touching scenes between the characters.
I stumbled up this series by accident and I'm glad I did. There is a lot of really bad stuff out there in the indie world but this isn't one of them.  Give it a try.  I want to see what happens to these guys.",1348099200,10,831,4.253164556962025
8490758,1,B0061AFM1A,I  have never heard of this show before but  decided to take a chance and buy it. That was my big mistake. Lots of brief scenes involving  too many people  to enable you to be able to keep up with them. The  very short second episode did not  make things any more enjoyable. A complete lack of anything resembling a decent script  made this  a very tedious affair. Performances were okay  most of the time. An over- the -top soap opera is  the ony way I can describe  the  2 episodes. I won't be watching any  further episodes.,1344211200,,527,4.255102040816326
8490759,5,B0061AFM1A,Welcome back BoysTown!! After they did the original pilot back years ago they disappeared and now finally they have brought it back with a vengeance! The show now has great production value and shooting in high def. Episode 2 picks up where they left off and having almost all of the original cast and a couple new hotties I couldn't be happier. I cant wait for episodes 3 & 4...why isn't this airing on LOGO or HERE?,1328745600,3,417,4.428571428571429
