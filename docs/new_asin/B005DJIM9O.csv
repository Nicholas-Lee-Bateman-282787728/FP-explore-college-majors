8466968,5,B005DJIM9O,"Kim Myung Min has the ability to portray an unlikable character but still give the viewer a glimpse of a good, but misunderstood, person who strives to bring a group of musicians to a level of excellence they didn't even realize they could achieve.  His performance as a conductor is superb, and the star-studded cast doesn't disappoint either.  The real ""star"", though, is the music, which will move you to tears.  Do yourself a favor and purchase the soundtrack, which is beautifully boxed with three cd's.  Those who purchase this DVD will watch it many times, I predict.",1358121600,,574,4.826530612244898
8466969,5,B005DJIM9O,"Beethoven Virus is one of the very best series that I have seen!!  There is nothing wasted - no nasty step-mother's, girlfriends - the music is wonderful and all of the actors are top-notch!  Kim Myung-min is a new discovery for me and I have already sent for other films of his  ' Detective K is, in particular, great fun! '  Jang Keun-suk is my favorite and his wonderful work has led me to over four series....  A great set to see and enjoy!",1353888000,,444,4.238095238095238
