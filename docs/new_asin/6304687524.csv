7875622,5,6304687524,"I agree with both of the earlier reviews...the videos ARE bad quality! They are corny and silly.  However, my eleven year old daughter LOVES them!  She has Down Syndrome, and so these are perfect for her educational level.  I often hear her laughing so hard in the other room because of the puppets.  She watched the tapes so much I had to buy her a second set because she wore them out! She has learned so much from them. Yes, if you're looking for some slick, high-end videos with visual and sound effects, don't buy these.  But if you're looking for just plain funny educational material that your kid will love, then these are right for you!",1201824000,3,645,4.478632478632479
7875623,5,6304687524,I found this set to be very entertaining to my young children. It is a great addition to any phonics training program. It is lively and simple in its approach. Very well balanced for the young pre-reader.,1188172800,2,204,4.54054054054054
