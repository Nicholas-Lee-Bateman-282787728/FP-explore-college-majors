While I do love the original English version, the Italian version just has a more romantic feel to it. Also, it ties up the problems the English version has with translation of all the other languages that are spoken in the film-- the Italian version actually leaves in the other languages, and gives correct subtitles to them. Plus, there are more extras on this DVD.

For those of you who haven't read the book this film is based on? Please do. It's by Thomas Mann, and absolutely beautiful. The movie is a fairly faithful rendition of the book, give or take a few things. That's more than can be said for most films these days based on books.

Either way, though, this movie could be in Klingon and I'd still think it was one of the best movies ever made.

Enjoy!",1288137600,,907,4.451807228915663
