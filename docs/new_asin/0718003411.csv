7788203,5,0718003411,"The Bible is brought to life in Matthew, a Dramatic Presentation of the Life of Jesus.  This visual presentation, which includes two parts, faithfully follows the NIV version (1984). Starring Bruce Marchiano as Jesus, viewers will enjoy the realistic costumes and the authentic setting.

This video contains nothing objectionable and is suitable for all ages.  Highly recommended for families, youth groups, and anyone else wishing to have a visual glimpse into the Bible.

I have added this movie to my mom-approved movie listing on my wordpress blog.",1369008000,,552,5.310344827586207
7788204,5,0718003411,"Unlike regular ""movie"" versions of Bible stories, this has no 'script' other than the word-for-word New International Version text of the Bible.  Literally SEE the Scriptures come alive, without the paraphrase or poetic license of a re-written 'story'.  I used to play this for my kids every Sunday morning as we got ready for church.  As a direct result, they can nearly QUOTE entire passages of Scripture in the New International Version. They are now in high school and still recall words and events of our Savior's life.  VERY well done video and I COMMEND the use of ACTUAL SCRIPTURE instead of story/script.  THANK you!",1360540800,2,625,4.914285714285715

The character of Christ was disappointingly 'man next door'. Christ is Celestial not a 'guy down the block'. If this personification was aimed at making HIM more believable by making HIM so terrestrial, this character undermined and detoured that aim. Bare chested??
  Yes, He lived as a mortal in some respects, but not to the extent portrayed. I was disappointed in the character's 'smile' --- a little too cunningly 'Gotcha! guys'.  Some of the other characters' accents seemed distant from Jerusalem. The sets were good, lighting + sound, etc. were very good.",1308441600,,571,5.118279569892473
7788206,5,0718003411,Keep in mind that this version is the same as the newer edition except that you have to have part 1 & part 2 as a whole movie. Part 1 consists of Chapters 1 to 14 whereas part 2 consists of Chapter 15 and so forth. I really enjoy watching this film. You can either watch it and follow along with your NIV bible or you can simply watch it with subtitles (large font too).,1282435200,6,370,3.9466666666666668
7788207,5,0718003411,Bruce Marchiano has given us a refreshing portrayal of the life of Christ.  Other characters also come to life in surprising ways and make us want to re-immerse ourselves in the gospels.,1275350400,4,186,4.8125
