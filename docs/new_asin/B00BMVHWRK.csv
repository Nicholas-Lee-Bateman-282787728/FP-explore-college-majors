5654126,5,B00BMVHWRK,"I was happy to hear Snoop changed to snoop lion. I understood some of it why he did it, But after watching this movie i want snoop lion to stick with snoop lion. If you like his rap stuff listen to it. If you like snoop lion listen to the album. Or if your someone like me listen to both but understand why he did his change. We need more people like him in this generation.",1366761600,,374,3.9342105263157894
5654127,4,B00BMVHWRK,"Entertaining and informative. A positive transformation away from one way of living into a new spirit and energy. ""Stop! Jah, Rastafari!""",1366761600,,137,5.571428571428571
5654128,5,B00BMVHWRK,"fun, entertaining, you get to see snoop and daz as real people (flaws and all). snoop can be a really good speaker",1366502400,,114,4.2272727272727275
5654129,5,B00BMVHWRK,"Well done movie. Showed rastas for there true spritual beliefs and didn't just focus on the canabis smoking that everyone associates with them. Gives a good look into the state of rastifarian practice since the passing of bob marley. I wish more rappers would do the same to promote the lifestyle they truly believe in, and not the one they glamorize in there performances.",1366502400,,373,4.84375
5654130,5,B00BMVHWRK,"Raztafari! very proud of Big Snoop Dogg (ooops i mean ""Snoop Lion""). I'ts great that he is searching in his inna culture becoming a new kinda rapper, this generation of rapper's don't know the meaning of dreads, all they think of it is a hair style & that they look good. It means ur standing up against the system + babylon. Plus Bunny Wailer is in it how cool is that! Go head snoop do ya thang.",1365120000,3,397,4.1688311688311686
5654141,5,B00BMVHWRK,This is a great video for any music or art fans It provides an interesting perspective into Snoop Dog's career that comes from his own view.,1393286400,,140,4.423076923076923
5654142,5,B00BMVHWRK,This movie takes you into the upper living in the hills of Jamaica and we understood exactly what Snoop Lion was trying to accomplish.,1392249600,,134,4.625
5654143,5,B00BMVHWRK,Snoop's BIO  movie is feel with a lot of Bob Marley's moments in life as he relates them to how life going up in L.A is hard I  blessed because he has had it so hard going up. Jamaica is beautiful and Major Lazer has an outstanding group of talented people to go from rap to reggae Snoop is an super star talent ONE LOVE,1387584000,,320,3.9076923076923076
5654144,2,B00BMVHWRK,"I don't listen to much hip-hop, and I don't think I had heard any of Snoop Lion's music before watching this film.  So I am not the target audience for this movie, a documentary covering Snoop's journey to Jamaica to recreate himself.  That said, I'd like to think i could appreciate any film which had something worth saying.  Not much of that here.  I basically learned that Snoop Lion lived a life as a street hustler, had a solid career in hip-hop, and found inner peace in Jamaican Rastafarianism.  Well, that and he smokes a lot of marijuana.  A whole lot.  I mean, a staggering, unbelievable, truly brain-numbing lot.  If the thought of seeing ganja puffed on screen gives you the giggles, you might like this film.  For the rest of us, there isn't a lot of substance on display.  I'm disappointed because Snoop Lion has likability and laid-back charisma, and the bits of his early work we see here shows real talent.  I wish we had learned more about Snoop Lion's life and work before his pilgrimage.  A straight biography would have been much more interesting then this lazy excursion into pot glamorization.",1387584000,,1117,4.701030927835052
5654145,2,B00BMVHWRK,"I thought this was going to be a reincarnation of Snoop, some kind of change. I'm a big fan of his but this is just another video of him smokin, only he is in Jamaica doing it.",1379721600,4,176,3.7837837837837838
5654146,5,B00BMVHWRK,the controversy behind it sucks but i loved it. it was something different and didn't mind spending money on it,1378944000,,111,4.6
5654147,4,B00BMVHWRK,"Many people say this move was a complete marketing gimmick. It was simply not that. There was an intention of expanding his fan base with this perhaps and making some extra cash but it wasn't simply money-driven. The actual documentary was done by Diplo, Vice/Noisey and they did a great job (as usual). A bit expensive but it was worth for a 3 day rental- one of the few movies I rented that I actually watched more than once- I watched this 2 1/2 times! It is very entertaining especially if you like Snoop, mainstream rap, Jamaican reggae/dancehall scene, and seeing people smoke many chalices, blunts, and pipes filled with Cali and Jamaican bud (throughout the entire movie). I can see why some just label it as Snoop doing his regular thing and putting a reggae ""twist"" on it- it was a bit deeper than that for sure. He connects with the people he interacts with. He goes to many places such as Trench Town, Tivoli Gardens, Blue Mountain Range, and Port Antonio- but it isn't just about him and his experience in Jamaica- he reflects on 2Pac's & Nate Dogg's deaths (the Nate Dogg funeral footage was fantastic) and in particular I enjoyed the whole ""No Guns Allowed"" buildup story (Snoop getting arrested and his family being detained) and then him and his family in the studio in Jamaica recording the song. The production by Major Lazer was absolutely stunning as far as the beats went. The ""Fruit Juice"" song with Mr. Vegas with a remixed ""Sleng Teng"" riddim is one of the best songs and is featured in this as well as ""No Guns"", ""Here Comes the King"", ""Lighters Up"", and ""Ashtrays and Heartbreaks"". Too bad he had a falling out with Bunny Wailer this year pertaining to this film- I hope they can make amends as Bob Marley's sons and widow had no problem with what Snoop tried to become: ""Berhane/Snoop Lion"". I would say 3 1/2 solid stars rounded up to 4. Awesome.",1378252800,3,1875,4.566765578635015
5654148,5,B00BMVHWRK,"So happy I ordered this, and so happy Snoop has found some Peace & Happinesss. He Deserves it. I admire his strength",1376092800,,116,4.318181818181818
5654149,5,B00BMVHWRK,LOVED IT! I totally understand Snoop Dogg's journey to become Snoop Lion. This documentary evoked every emotion out of me.,1375228800,,122,5.15
5654150,1,B00BMVHWRK,"If you wanna see snoop walk around the slums of Jamaica smoking pot, occasionally go to the studio to record some really bad tracks and babble on about his past this is ur movie. I expected pot use and an explanation as to why he is doing a reggae album, but I also expected some descent music with some accomplished reggae musicians. This was a total waste of my time.",1374710400,3,369,4.285714285714286
5654161,5,B00BMVHWRK,"Nice to see the growth in Snoop. A good insight into what has shaped this new path for him. If it keeps you on a positive path, I'm all for it.",1372118400,,143,3.6451612903225805
5654162,5,B00BMVHWRK,"Prompt delivery, great product. Reincarnated is an interesting documentary. I would definately recomend it to any Snoop Dogg fan! Thanks! 5 stars!",1370908800,,146,5.681818181818182
5654163,4,B00BMVHWRK,"Just finished watching ""Reincarnated"". I must say that I really had a good time watching Snoop and his transition to the Rastafarian. From Snoop Dogg to Snoop Lion. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who is a big Snoop fan like myself. Awesome!!!",1370736000,3,257,4.733333333333333
5654164,5,B00BMVHWRK,"Snoop dares his cause.
I command him on taking his risks.
He his the first reincarnation in the Rastafarian culture.
Maybe not the last. It took centuries for this concept(reincarnation) to take root among the Tibetans.
At the uncommon level, no one can deny him the claim.
He did produce a wonderful album from the experience.
The meeting with Bunny Wailer is marvelous.
I can't share the film with my son because of the excessive marijuana smoking.
I have already recommended the film to the few friends I know.
Soon we will have something new to talk about.

My greetings to Snoop Lion.
Who dares his cause.",1370390400,,610,4.700934579439252
5654165,3,B00BMVHWRK,"This is a very interesting look into Snoop Lion's inner psyche, but it falls short in that we see more of what he wants to be like than what he is actually like right now. Peeks into the lack of full self-disclosure are snippets of Snoop's reaction when asked about why he feels vulnerable after giving up his guns. It is undoubtedly very difficult to shake off a past like Snoop's, and I admire him for trying to do so, but he apparently has some way to go, as reflected by Bunny Wailer's public renunciation of Snoop as a Rastafarian even before this documentary came out. It would have been much more interesting to have the opposing view of Snoop from the Rastafarian perspective, good and bad, as this superstar is trying to reinvent himself. In the end, it is more of a self-serving wannabe paean than a real documentary. I gave it three stars because it is fascinating to watch Snoop talk about himself and his past and there is at least the appearance of some genuine insight during some very good and entertaining segments.",1368144000,6,1032,4.553763440860215

8571149,5,B00BMVHWRK,"i really liked this video, for the longest time i blew this era of snoops life off as a fluke and thought he didn't nail the sound properly given his roots in music, but after seeing this video i have much respect to snoop for taking a whole month to connect with their music totally aside from rap. I found myself re-downloading the album for a second chance, i had always like the lighters up song but not the rest of the album. However i am uset that two or three really good songs that were aired on the video did not make the album, i would love to find out the names of those because i want them. But very good story in this video i reccomend it to any noop fan.",1417737600,,668,4.030075187969925
