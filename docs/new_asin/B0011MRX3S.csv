I'm not a purist but the English dubbing for the TV prints from K.Gordon Murray was pretty abysmal.

So when I saw volume 2of BCI's CRYPT OF TERROR collection I bought it because on the back it the 3 disc/6 film set was in Spanish with English subtitles.

However, when I put some of the titles on to watch, such was not the case. They were all English dubbed prints, most of them from the old Murray/AIP Television package. I checked the menus and nothing of alternate versions, soundtracks or subtitles. In short, BCL promised one thing but delivered something else. In the end, this was one of the few times I took an item back to my video store and wanted my money back.

So if you're hoping to get it with the original version with subtitles or the choice of the English soundtrack, forget it. For me, it was a disappointment.",1325808000,3,1107,4.6091370558375635

Instead of the listed ""Masterworks of Terror"" you get ""The New Invisible Man"".  There has been some talk on a few sites that there were some copyright issues with ""Masterworks"" that kept it from the set.  Still, if they had time to correct the cover sleeve you think they'd have time to correct the ordering info.  Well ""Night of the Bloody Apes"", ""Wrestling Women Vs. The Aztec Mummy"" and ""Doctor of Doom"" alone make this set worth having.  Everything else should be considered bonus even if what you're ordering isn't what you're getting.",1206576000,7,676,4.686440677966102
