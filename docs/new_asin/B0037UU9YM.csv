8390786,3,B0037UU9YM,"I watched a few episodes of the Mexican TV series ""Mujeres Asesinas"" on Univision and got hooked, so I bought the DVDs for seasons 1 and 2, because they were relatively inexpensive (only $25 a few months back). Although I've enjoyed and even admired some episodes, the purchase has left me feeling a little guilty.

The things I like: The DVD packages are classy, with 13 episodes on each and a booklet with nice photos and background on the stories, actors and production. The stories are hard-hitting dramas that focus on what led a woman to kill. At the beginning of each show, we know someone has been killed but we don't always know who the victim is, why they were killed or, sometimes, even who did the killing. The mystery unfolds in flashbacks, in a very dark, foreboding way, like some of the best ""CSI"" episodes. Sometimes the stories are truly nerve-wracking and scary. Some of the episodes are well-written and make a sincere effort to understand the motives behind the women's crimes. Some episodes deal seriously with issues like mental illness, domestic abuse and police corruption. Sometimes the killers are just plain evil. It doesn't make excuses for the murderers, and it shows murder as ugly and horrific. A coda at the end of each episode tells how the courts judged each killer.

""Mujeres Asesinas"" is a fabulous showcase for many outstanding Mexican actresses who deserve recognition outside the Spanish-speaking world. Rosa Maria Bianchi's grim features are just perfect for the police psychiatrist, who heads the investigation team. Veterans like Maria Sorte, Carmen Salinas, and Edith Gonzalez, along with younger actresses like Angelique Boyer and Sherlyn, really dig into their roles.

The things I dislike: For every episode that has cool cinematic qualities (""Clara, Fantasiosa"" in season 2 is a homage to Hitchcock's technique) or that shows real insight into characters (""Monica, Acorralada"" in season 1 is a study of a decent person truly driven over the edge), there are two that are exploitive trash. Given the title of the show, it may be silly to criticize it on this account. It pretty much advertises its pulpy nature upfront. But do we really need to see close-ups of the knife entering a bound victim's skin (""Sonia, Desalmada"") or the victim coming out of a meat grinder (""Emilia, Cocinera"")? That is why I feel guilty about my purchase.

Mediamates released these DVDs in the US and Canada without English subtitles. That is both culturally rude and financially stupid. They are excluding a larger market by not investing a little more in subtitles. But I am conflicted enough about ""Mujeres Asesinas"" to not really care whether the producers make more money. It is a guilty pleasure indeed, with emphasis on the guilt!",1297382400,2,2763,4.974025974025974
