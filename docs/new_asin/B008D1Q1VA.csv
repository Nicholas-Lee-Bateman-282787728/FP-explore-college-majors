5152873,1,B008D1Q1VA,"I bought this set from Walmart for I believe $10, I watched The Departed first with absolutely no issues. A few months later I found the DVD and decided to watch Goodfellas. The movie ran til about 30 minutes from the end. It just stopped abruptly. I flipped the DVD over thinking it was a two part movie and nothing happened. I was first watching this in an XBOX so I switched to the DVD player, still no ending. I did everything to find the ending to this movie. I checked the scene selection, which only goes up to 19 scenes and I tried fast forwarding to the end nothing works. The ending to this DVD is missing. I am most disappointed because I purchased this solely for Goodfellas, since I haven't seen it on DVD anywhere lately. I wrote to warnerbros and will let you know if I hear anything back about this so other unsatisfied customers can receive help. All I wanted is to watch GOODFELLAS :(

****UPDATE**** tonight I received and email from Warner bros they were extremely helpful and offered a replacement DVD of goodfellas. I suggest that anyone who purchased this defected copy and would like the full version of goodfellas go to warnerbros.com and fill out a question form. They got back to me in about a week and were very helpful!",1371254400,39,1248,4.473684210526316
5152874,5,B008D1Q1VA,"I was roaming about in a local Target yesterday when I wandered into the electronics section. Looking at the DVDs, I saw ""4 Film Favorites: Martin Scorsese Collection"" on sale for $7.99. Four movies - ""Mean Streets,"" ""Goodfellas,"" ""The Aviator,"" and ""The Departed"" - from a world class director for a mere $7.99. That's less than two bucks for each title. I bought it, but only for ""Goodfellas"" which is my favorite Scorsese film and one of my favorite films period. It was only later that I looked up this set at Amazon. I was shocked to see so many one and two star reviews.

Were these discs manufactured from inferior prints?

Were all four movies crammed onto one disc?

What could be the problem?

The problem, according to these customers, is that ""Goodfellas"" is truncated. When it first appeared on DVD, the nearly three hour film was divided into two parts, with one part on side one and the remainder of the film on side two. When putting together this set, the manufacturer apparently was unaware of that and only side one made it onto the disc.

Only after reading these reviews did I unseal the package and open the container to see what was inside. There were four discs, one for each film. However, ""Goodfellas"" was labeled ""Disc One."" Uh-oh. Where was ""Disc Two""? Since ""Disc One"" had poster art reproduced on one side, I concluded that this wasn't a double-sided disc. I have never had a double-sided disc that had artwork on the label. I was disappointed. I felt like I had been ripped-off. I only bought this set for ""Goodfellas"" and I wasn't going to get the complete movie. ""Heck,"" said I (well, I actually muttered another word, a euphemism for excrement, but I won't type that here).

There was only one thing left to do: insert ""Disc One"" of ""Goodfellas"" into my Bluray player and fast forward through each chapter to see if the movie abruptly ended, as that two-sided disc did, shortly after the murder of Billy Batts. Hmm. Clicking the ""display"" option on the remote, I discovered there were 47 chapters which seemed about right for a nearly three-hour movie. The display also said the film's running time was 146 minutes, the same running time provided at the Internet Movie Database. As I sped through each chapter I glimpsed many familiar scenes and when I reached the end, there was Ray Liotta getting his newspaper from the steps of his modest new digs, and addressing the viewer, telling us how his new life does not compare with life in the mob. Then Joe Pesci briefly appeared to blast away at the screen before it faded to black and Johnny Rotten (or whoever that is) sings ""My Way"" over the closing credits.

Unless someone received a defective edition of this set, the complaints are unwarranted. ""Goodfellas"" is here in its entirety and all on one disc. Unless you already have these movies, this set is a steal for the price and well worth owning.",1363392000,7,2887,4.649019607843138
5152875,1,B008D1Q1VA,!!!DO NOT PURCHASE!!!I was only able to watch the first 112 minutes of goodfellas. Extremely disappointing. Don't know what the other positive ratings are talking about this DVD was only side A. !!!DO NOT PURCHASE!!!,1359417600,14,216,5.2
5152876,1,B008D1Q1VA,"We also got 112 minutes through Goodfellas, and then it ended. Clearly, there was supposed to be more content on the reverse side, but this disc has no reverse side. The film is supposed to run 146 minutes, so it comes up 34 minutes short. A real disappointment. If you get the two box set that also contains Goodfellas, then it has a reversible disc. So, this is a manufacturing error that needs to be rectified.",1358812800,12,413,4.447368421052632
5152877,5,B008D1Q1VA,"The comments say it's only half of goodfellas yet, just do a Google search on how long each movie is, add them together and you get only two minutes missing. lol Since there aren't any tailors i doubt there is only half a movie. How many four film favorites has this company came out with and how many 'half movies' did they release? NONE that i got. So i'm going to get the film and write to see if these comments are misleading which i strongly think they are.",1357344000,,462,4.202247191011236
5152878,1,B008D1Q1VA,"I found it quite annoying when I bought this film collection and only Side A of The Goodfellas was in the set. I would have liked it if I was able to watch ALL of that movie, not just half of it! DON'T waste your hard earned money on this collection, just buy the films individually instead.",1355097600,34,291,4.12280701754386
5152879,1,B008D1Q1VA,"I purchased this product and found that only 70-odd minutes of Goodfellas was present. When I buy collections like this, I expect the films to be complete, because that's what I'm paying for. Instead, I got only the first half of a film.
The set was sealed completely, brand new, never been watched before.
It's ridiculous.",1350950400,32,323,4.785714285714286

5152911,1,B008D1Q1VA,The primary reason I bought this set was for Goodfellas - of which - as others have posted about - is incomplete in this set.  Only the first hour and 12 minutes is on the DVD.  The rest is nowhere to be found....,1447804800,7,213,3.9302325581395348
5152912,3,B008D1Q1VA,"Notice that (as I write this) 44% of reviewers give this the maximum 5 stars...but almost as many (41%) give this the minimum of 1 star! Seems like the 1 star raters did so because they only got half of Goodfellas. And the 5 star raters got all of Goodfellas. Well I got all of Goodfellas...but my rating is only 3 star. Why? Because the picture quality is only so-so, and that's being kind. Grainy, not sharp. And my copy of Goodfellas, although I do have all of it, the audio is slightly out of sync.

But I got this composite set because I wanted to get Mean Streets, which I had never before seen, and it was cheaper buying all four of these outstanding movies than it was just buying Mean Streets alone! And again, the picture quality is not all that great, but I expected that, none of these films are ""remastered""...but for $2.50 a movie, hey, I can live with only so-so picture quality.",1447545600,2,894,4.3532934131736525

5152915,1,B008D1Q1VA,"My husband and I sat down to have a movie night, and I remembered I purchased this DVD set of 4 Scorsese films.  We decided on Goodfellas, so he took the wrapping off the DVD, we sat down to watch, and the movie stopped mid-way through.  At an hour and 15 minutes to be exact.  The main menu appeared and provided options to review the first hour's worth of Scene's from a ""scene selection"" and the screen read 'Disc A'.  BUT THERE IS NO DISC B.  The set was brand new,  unwrapped just before watching.  There are 3 other DVD's in the box/case and they are for the other 3 listed movies.  No Where to be found is the disc with the second part of the movie.  So, we watched the first half and are now hoping Goodfellas will be shown on regular cable networks so we can watch the other half!  TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT !!!!  We have never heard of a movie taking up more than one disc.  Very Strange and now just learned it is not returnable.  No Wonder !!",1444089600,4,949,4.176795580110498

It was supposed to come with 16:9, but what you got fo Goodfellas was 4:3 and only HALF of the film.

Also, the film quality is definitely in the VHS realm.  Honestly, this appears to be a pirated version, and worst yet, the film appears to have broken half way through playing.",1438992000,,327,4.416666666666667

5152925,3,B008D1Q1VA,"I've noticed the same problem as some of the other reviewers; the copy of Goodfellas included in this set stops in the middle of the movie (not to mention the quality is so-so). I find it kind of funny that WB would have such an issue. For one, the Goodfellas DVD menu is very cheap looking, and the scene select says ""Side A"", which leads me to believe this is a rip of a dual-sided disc. The label on the disc is also very plain compared to the others, but that's a style I've seen on most DVDs lately, so I don't know if that holds any significance. Upon inspecting the back of the case, I noticed it said ""Dual layer format (except Goodfellas)"", which would mean the Goodfellas disc had lower capacity than the others.

All in all, this is a very peculiar problem. I wouldn't recommend buying this solely for Goodfellas. I haven't watched the other movies, but I have a feeling they work just fine; I think it was just a production problem with their first batch, or maybe they bought their discs from China, trying to save some money.",1426723200,2,1039,4.383419689119171
