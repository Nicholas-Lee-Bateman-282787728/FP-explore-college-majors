8200430,4,B000A345GM,"Not too bad of a comedy movie.  Very dated obviously to 80's camp, but I still found the movie to be enjoyable and unlike other older films some scenes did make me laugh.  The late but still great Christopher Lee played a villainous real estate executive who is trying to sell a newly refurbished Florida beach hotel.

This is a very light spoof with a couple grade school level gags.  I would have rated this film PG, for maybe ages 14 to adult with thumbs only slightly up.  B-",1434758400,,479,4.337078651685394

8200432,3,B000A345GM,"This is a kitchen-sink comedy that weaves stock characters and standard plot devices into an unremarkable 84 minutes. There's a scheming father, an offbeat militant handyman, horny desk clerks, kooky guests, and a business-savvy hooker. The story involves a failing Florida hotel whose revitalization is undermined by the owner's attempts to embarrass the prospective son-in-law he's installed as manager. Peter Scolari, who in 1984 had finished his run in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bosom-Buddies/dp/B000R7I3YG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bosom Buddies</a>&nbsp;and was just starting&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Newhart/dp/B000YKYT1M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Newhart</a>, gives a professional performance as the milquetoast son-in-law, while his co-star, Colleen Camp seems to be reading cue cards. Christopher Lee shines in a brief, over-the-top scene as the hotel owner, and Fran Drescher and Monique Garbriel hot things up as hookers.

This isn't a complete turkey, but the script doesn't live up to the talents of the film's cast. [2009 hyperbolium dot com]",1231977600,5,2012,7.986607142857143
