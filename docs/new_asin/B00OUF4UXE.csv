8685030,5,B00OUF4UXE,Very interesting DVD about the Civil War.  I am a teacher.  I think it would be great to use in middle school or high school.  This is a bargain because it covers the Civil War so well and at a level that is easy to understand but not boring!,1483747200,3,242,3.8979591836734695
8685031,5,B00OUF4UXE,"I am a Civil War buff but certainly not an expert on the subject.  I have many books on that war and a few other DVDs but this one is my favorite thus far.  It is well presented timely presented.  It is just so hard to believe and accept that we have killed directly and indirectly so many more of ourselves than any foreign enemy on the battle field.  I think these remembrances are necessary to remind ourselves how terrible divisions can be, especially right now as our Nation is almost as divided as it was 150 years ago.",1422748800,6,525,4.2727272727272725
