8328379,3,B001NYDU2W,"The Get Fit Class portion of this DVD is great. I particularly like the stretching section at the end. Very thorough, relaxing basic yoga stretches.  The whole workout is easy to follow, beginner level.
The Total Body Workout portion of this DVD is a little awkward. She doesn't give you much warning before changing the steps, the cardio sections are actually more toning than cardio, and the stretching section is in the middle of the workout. Personally I would prefer it either at the beginning or the end. I do have to say though that the arm toning section is great. I pretty much use that DVD just for arms. All in all, the set is a nice addition to a workout DVD collection, but I would recommend the Get Fit Class over the Total Body Workout",1446854400,,750,4.474452554744525
8328380,4,B001NYDU2W,"Very good total body workouts. Very simply done, but effective. Kathy is good at describing the positions and where you should be feeling the ""pull"" so you know you are doing the moves correctly.",1439337600,,195,4.764705882352941
8328381,2,B001NYDU2W,"I was pretty disappointed with these.  I love Kathy Kaehler, but these DVDs not so much.  She doesn't seem to be quite as ""energetic ""... they are a good work out, but her enthusiasm seems to be lacking....",1426291200,,206,4.394736842105263
8328382,5,B001NYDU2W,"These 2 DVD's have great short workouts to really get you sweating, even if the camera direction can at times be off. Still recommended.",1394928000,,136,4.708333333333333
8328383,5,B001NYDU2W,"This is without a doubt my favorite workout video.  Easy to follow, informative about form and what you are working, and it really works you.",1336953600,,141,4.64
