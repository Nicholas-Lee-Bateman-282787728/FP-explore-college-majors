2124306,5,B0002VBIL2,You don't need to know a lot about voodoo to be fascinated by this unique film.  Robert Pratten and the cast of London Voodoo have delivered a personal and intimate view of adult relationships in a special setting.  London Voodoo is authentic in every way - you'll be thinking about this movie for days!,1097452800,3,303,4.592592592592593
2124307,5,B0002VBIL2,"This is a keep-you-on-the-edge-of-your-seat movie! It's an adult movie in the broadest sense of the term - intelligent plot and situations with a sobering message for all work-a-holic dads!

Like the reviewer above, I loved the tremendous verve and pace of the voodoo sequences - raw, edgy and intense.

But I also like the subtle comedy of the builders and the measured approach to gore - such that when ""it"" came (I won't reveal what!) it was all the more shocking.  And the nudity/skimpy bits(lace/silkies) scenes were well done too - they never felt at all gratuitous, perhaps because at all points the director enables the actors to preserve their dignity.

So ok, the acting: all gave fine performances.  For example, Sara Stewart gives superb witness to a descent into madness.  Her dramatisation of a woman in anaphylactic shock was incredible and real. A tour de force. Of the others, Trisha Marshall who plays a white voodoo initiate gives a sensitive, defined performance: none of the pseudo horror of which this is often associated,  but rather a spiritual  portrayal of voodoo as a religion. Very effective.

This is truely a great film and one I'd recommend to those who place the importance of story above special effects (because there aren't any!) and tension/suspense above cheap shock tactics.

2124308,5,B0002VBIL2,"Thank God that someone delivered a voodoo film with an intelligent story and an awesome climax. Fans of psychological horror films and supernatural thrillers will love this film, as I did.

Pratten has obviously either been striped naked himself as part of some kind of voodoo ritual or he's really done his homework. This is the most authentic voodoo/santeria stuff in a movie I've ever seen.

I loved the direction too - nice shots, nice creepy suspenseful moments... and boy... nice chicks!

8032778,1,B0002VBIL2,"I never saw this movie, it said i it wasn't compatible with my device, that I needed a pc which I was on. So I thought I was out of $1.99, but Amazon refunded my money for something else. No harm no foul.",1397520000,,204,3.7674418604651163
8032779,5,B0002VBIL2,I enjoyed this film because of the subject matter. Even though it was a movie there are truths to this beautiful religion that has a dark side which was explored but love always wins in the end,1359417600,,193,4.243243243243243
8032780,1,B0002VBIL2,"I was extremely disappointed in the movie.  So unless you're a collector of a specific actor/actresses movies (bad or not), I wouldn't waste the money.  You'd get more pleasure out of cleaning your bathroom on a Friday night than watching this video. PS Michale Nyqvist has about two minutes total screen time in this flick - not at all part of the main action in the movie.",1302048000,5,374,4.567164179104478
8032781,2,B0002VBIL2,"This film looks very nice.  Polished cinematography and set decor, good atmosphere, and some very sexy actresses.  So I won't give it one star.

But there's something tedious about this film.  A slow story, with much buildup leading to very little. I don't require my horror films to be blood geysers, but FWIW, the body count is very low, and none too graphic.  And the characters aren't especially likable.

An American couple move to London because hubby's job took him there.  Wife finds corpses in the basement.  She's soon possessed and acts weird.  Hubby ignores this until he can no longer, and is forced to accept the help of the good voodoo cult, to fight the bad voodoo spirit.

A minor subplot has the nanny try and seduce the hubby.  Not much happens there either.

I first saw this film at the 2004 World Horror Convention in Phoenix, Arizona.  I remember being impressed by it, but not especially enjoying it.  I bought a used DVD in 2011 -- hey, only one penny! -- but still didn't quite enjoy it.

Pretty women, though.",1296691200,,1036,4.615384615384615
8032782,3,B0002VBIL2,"Pratten is one to watch. I found this to be expertly directed. The suspenseful moments really jump out at the viewer, and the imagery and character development were top notch as well.

The acting got better as the film went on. It can't be easy playing a lady who weaves in and out of possession throughout the course of the film, but the lead lady did a fine and convincing job.

The writer seems to have done his research as the film seems to stress minute details that are rarely seen in the mainstream horror flicks.

If only the ending measured up to the rest. For a movie that kept me on edge throughout constantly throwing in new possibilities, the ending seemed corny, cliche, sappy, flat...

I encourage horror fans in the mood for something psychological and occult to check this out. A fine debut product from Pratten!",1152748800,,829,4.581081081081081
8032783,1,B0002VBIL2,"This is the worst Voodoo film I have ever seen or even the worst horror movie of all time.

It starts like that, a man and his wife move to England because the husband has work there. The husband is very busy with his work and doesn't give his wife any attention.  Then the wife finds 2 corps in the basement and she decides to kill her free time studying these corps (the husband has no problem with that) and then the usual happens, wife possessed by the soul of a voodoo queen, people trying to tell husband that his wife is possessed, husband doesn't believe, Wife starts to freak husband, husband believes and goes back to the people who wanted to help him then a small exorcism and boom the movie is over.

I don't know how this movie got all these high ratings. If you really want to see this movie rent it don't buy it",1143331200,2,826,4.215189873417722
8032784,3,B0002VBIL2,"This movie, writer/director Robert Pratten's first, is an interesting and worthwhile movie that I recommend with reservations.  The premise is fairly basic: a yuppie American couple with a young daughter moves to London for the husband's career.  Soon, the wife is possessed by an ancient, pissed off spirit, who wants to possess the husband with her lost lover.  As far as that goes, there's little you haven't seen before: the workaholic husband who doesn't have time for his family, the pissed-off, lonely wife, the ending reconciliation you know is coming right from the beginning.

But this movie, unlike so many others, is fairly effective.  Instead of cheap shocks, it builds and maintains suspense through character development, and doesn't cater to the teenaged MTV moviegoing crowd.  The acting here is uneven -- all of the actors run the gamut from cringeworthy acting to some really convincing stuff.  Doug Cockle, playing the husband, does his best Kevin Spacey and occasionally comes close to pulling it off.  He also boldly shows more skin than his wife.  Sara Stewart, his wife, smolders like a pornstar in some scenes, yet at other times is very effective, both as mother and possessed warrior.  Vonda Barnes is generally decent as the au pair.  Unfortunately, all these characters are pretty unlikeable from the getgo, so it's sometimes hard to develop much sympathy for them.

Still, despite its obviously very limited budget, its clich&eacute;d score, and its mostly utilitarian sets, this is an effective horror film, and quite a good debut for the director.  It's not great, but there are some kernels of greatness in it.  If you like good horror, definitely check it out; if you're in the mood for Hollywood thrills'n'chills, this is probably not what you're looking for.",1126051200,4,1794,5.0993150684931505
8032785,5,B0002VBIL2,"I was lucky enough to catch the premiere of London Voodoo at the Fearless Tales Genre Fest in San Francisco this winter 2004 and was literally glued to the screen! For the first time since 1987's The Believers, and 1988's Serpent and the Rainbow, comes a stylish, authentic and urban tale of voodoo, possession, exorcism and redemption. London Voodoo is a film, much like Rosemary's Baby, in that it takes its time telling its story in order to reveal it's many hidden surprises.

Manahattanites Lincoln (Doug Cockle) and Sarah (Sarah Stewart) move to London with their baby and take up residency in a poshy reconverted old townhouse - not knowing that their new (but old) home, especially the basement, has a very serious past. Settling into their new lifestyle, Lincoln establishes his executive career with a popular high-end company in midtown. Meanwhile, Sarah and her baby are left alone in an environment that is not only foreign, but also extremely lonely -and director Robert Pratten does wonders with his leading lady by slowly revealing her American neurosis of the classic misplaced 'Yankee' in a new country.

With construction work going on throughout their new home, Sarah soon discovers a dark secret entombed in the basement. And this is where the film really takes off!

London Voodoo offers it all. Mystery and intrigue soon turn to paranoia and mounting terror. I'm not going to reveal any more of the storyline - you have to see this one for yourselves! The supporting cast, especially Trisha Mortimer, Sven-Bertil Taube and the vampy Vonda Barnes only add to the great atmosphere and subplots of the film. It's easy to see why director Robert Pratten won Best Director at the Fearless Tales Genre Fest. His attention to detail - especially his knowledge of the very intricate practices of voodoo, white and black magic and spells, is a lesson in itself.

And also noted is that his amazing ensemble' cast won the Best Acting accolades at the same festival- with kudos going to Cockle and Stewart.

Finally a creepy tale that relies on real actors - and not 'stars'. Maybe I'm old fashioned, but horror movies should always put characters first to pull you in before unleashing its fright upon the audience.

Much like the more polished fright flicks of the sixties such as Curtis Harrington's Games (1967), and even Freddie Francis' Dr. Terror's House of Horrors (1965), London Voodoo is a cerebral and stylish foray into the horror/voodoo genre . chilling without showing much, therefore leaving a lot to the imagination - but trust me - you'll jump!",1120262400,3,2573,4.930715935334873
8032786,5,B0002VBIL2,"Robert Pratten's terrific indie film, London Voodoo, is a subtle and intelligent adult horror film in the spirit of Nicholas Roeg's Don't Look Now. Voodoo has never seemed less a cliche. Terrific acting performances, creepy out-of-the-corner of-your-eye editing and camera work, and a chilling gothic score by Steve Severin of Siouxsie and the Banshees fame all make London Voodoo a unique experience not to be missed by fans of intelligent horror.
