I'm 21 now and still go back to this tape...in my move to a different apartment, it got lost so I sadly no longer have it, but I just told my sister I would LOVE this for my birthday !!! Now to either find a Vhs player or how to convert it to dvd",1412121600,,291,3.634920634920635
7838997,5,6303092284,I bought this movie for my kids about 4 years ago. Still have it and now another baby loves it. i think its definitely better for 3 and under age group though. The VHS just last so much better in my opinion. not a very long movie though. but we love it around here!,1377648000,,265,3.925925925925926
