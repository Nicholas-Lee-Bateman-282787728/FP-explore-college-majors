8575866,5,B00BZIF8KS,"Five Starts For Nancy:- This Tellie Drama is a poor effort in portraying an extremely amazing woman. The Production Company could have and should have done so much more in telling the story of Nancy Wake's life and her incredible 2nd World War exploits. However, it's worth a look. We owe a dept to these brave people that can never be repaid. Their memory should live on forever and their stories told and retold often.",1428969600,,420,4.613333333333333
8575867,5,B00BZIF8KS,"The story of a magnificent lady who risked everything.  A 'must see' classic of a great 'Aussie' heroine.  Compares favorably with ""Female Agents"".  I was very impressed.",1375056000,3,170,5.222222222222222
