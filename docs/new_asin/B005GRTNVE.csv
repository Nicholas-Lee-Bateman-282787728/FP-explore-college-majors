4693559,1,B005GRTNVE,That video is not HD 1080i it's less than 780i and sound is not True HD like describe.  Sound is a bad 5.1 mix.,1332806400,10,111,3.625
4693560,5,B005GRTNVE,"This is Popera, not opera, so if you are an opera snob, go watch the fat lady with the big Brunhilda hat. Popera is a genre in and of itself, and these four guys are the best in the world. They have in fact gotten even better over the years.  I would say they are now at their pinnacle as displayed in this thrilling concert performance.  My fave:  Dov'e l'Amore, sung to Samuel Barber's Addagio for Strings, just brilliantly executed. I have no doubt the composer himself would have been moved by this powerful rendition of his classic piece. And the real crowd-pleaser of the night was Pour Que Tu M'aimes Encore, their best-ever performance of this song, and the crowd went WILD.  Buy this DVD, you'll spend many hours playing it over and over.  Destined to be a classic.",1331769600,17,774,4.5
4693561,5,B005GRTNVE,"If you like beautiful music, songs that mean something to you, buy IlDiVo- Life in London, these 4 artists are the best singers in my world of music, they are the best, they have several CD's and DVD's out, I have them all, they are going on a long world tour starting February 8, I will be seeing their show in August, I am so looking forward to it, it will only be my second time, watching their videos makes you feel like you are right there with them, if you like beautiful songs and well dressed artists, they are the ones to choose, you will not regret it.",1327968000,28,562,4.165137614678899
4693562,5,B005GRTNVE,"Truly Outstanding Il Divo concert filmed Live in London. Five Great new songs from there newly released CD ""wicked games"" are featured along with

For fans of great music it is a must have! It shows you what is will be like to see them Live on there upcoming 2012 world tour only in the comfort of your home!",1327276800,2,586,4.407407407407407
4693563,5,B005GRTNVE,Have collected everything I can that Il Divo has released.  Have been waiting for this to be release since I saw and heard sample.  This is one of the best they have done to date.  I have copy for me and ordered 4 more as gifts for my friends and relatives.  You can not miss this one!  Amazon UK was great getting it for me since not released in USA yet.,1327017600,37,355,3.943661971830986
4693564,5,B005GRTNVE,"This blu ray is amazing!  Just what you would expect from Il Divo if you love them like I do.  They were having fun, relaxed and sounded great.

4693565,5,B005GRTNVE,"The performance at the London Colliseum was the first time in 18 months that Il Divo performed in front of an audience.  The crowd's enthusiasm and response is palpable through the DVD.  They were thrilled to be hearing familiar favorites and the new songs from these men they had missed so much.  All the new material, from their album ""Wicked Game"", is dynamic, charasmatic and inspiring.  The interaction between the singers is pure joy to watch - they are obviously so happy to be back on stage and performing for their fans.  They have fun with the performances and keep it light-hearted in conversations to the audience, between songs.  This DVD portrays Il Divo at their very best - beautiful songs, amazing voices and a never-ending charm with their delivery.  If this is an example of the show they will present on their next world-wide tour, it will be a resounding success.  I loved every gorgeous moment of this DVD.",1326153600,74,928,4.75625
4693566,5,B005GRTNVE,"After an 18 month absence, Il Divo has returned.  Their new concert is as wonderful as expected.  Their method of filming lets you feel as though you were there, both in the audience and behind the scenes.
 Well worth the price, it makes me want to see the concert in person and will suffice if that is not possible.",1325980800,3,316,4.322033898305085
4693567,1,B005GRTNVE,Very disappointing video quality.  This is not live video recording - rather it is a poor flim transfer and the grain is as big as golf balls.  Buy the regular DVD instead.,1324684800,17,172,4.34375

4693572,5,B005GRTNVE,"We recently attended this group's one night concert at Radio City, N.Y., and it was such a terrific experience that I was inspired to purchase this
DVD of their past performance in London.  It did not disappoint, as it felt as if we were at another concert, except this time with an up close view in the comfort of our home.  Of course, nothing beats being at a live show, but the video and sound quality on this disc is quite good; many of the songs are from their album Wicked Game, one of my favorites.  So when I feel the need for a bit of visual entertainment as well as music to soothe the soul, I pop in this DVD and all is well!",1478131200,3,636,4.072

4693631,5,B005GRTNVE,"I was so happy to see that Il Divo's ""Live in London"" concert was on DVD!  I was lucky enough to see them in Denver in 2012, and even though this DVD features their London concert, it features all the songs they performed on their tour so it is like re-living their concert in Denver!  The concert footage and behind-the-scenes escapades are fantastic.  If you like Il Divo, you will definitely like this DVD!  I hope they do a DVD of their current ""A Musical Affair"" tour, too!",1387497600,,478,4.3977272727272725

4693633,4,B005GRTNVE,"It wouldn't be fair to pick at any one thing. In fact, I think the sound recording was better than ""Live at Barcelona"". But somehow this was not as satisfying as their other Blu-ray. I think the songs just weren't as catchy.",1384560000,,224,4.357142857142857

4693642,5,B005GRTNVE,Watching this DVD prior to my first Il Divo live performance (5/8/2013 at the Ryman Auditorium) set me up for their interactive style with the audience.  But I think Nashville was more in love with them than they even anticipated pre-concert!,1368230400,,242,4.902439024390244

4693645,5,B005GRTNVE,"This is a wonderful DVD of Il Divo in concert live in London.  The audio and video are fine to me, so I do not understand why there would be any negative reviews about that, and the song selection in my opinion is fantastic.  I thoroughly enjoyed the concert from beginning to end.  I also have the DVD of Il Divo Live in Barcelona.  I really enjoy that DVD too.  The stage for the Barcelona concert goes out into the audience, so the guys were able to move around on stage more than the concert at the London Coliseum.  The stage at the Colesium does not go into the audience, so the guys were more limited as far as their movement on stage and interaction with the audience.  The audience at the Colesium is about 20 feet away whereas the guys could touch the hands of the audience in Barcelona.  The coliseum looks beautiful though, and I enjoyed the sights as I watched Il Divo perform in this beautiful place.  This DVD also has a few humorous moments that make me laugh.  The Colesium, music/orchestra, vocals, and the bonus content at the end of the DVD are great.  Part of the bonus content at the end are the guys discussing the songs on their Wicked Game CD track by track.  As they discuss each song, the song being discussed plays in the background.  Beautiful! -  I have ordered the Wicked Game CD now too!  Yay Me!!",1367712000,,1329,4.345528455284553

4693649,5,B005GRTNVE,"I'd seen parts of their Live in London concert on YouTube, but it paled in comparison to the DVD on my big flat-screen tv.

Production values are great. The additional interviews with how the selections were made offered another important insight into how these selected the songs and how the songs appealed to them and then to us.",1358726400,,390,4.3561643835616435

classical voice or even pop!  Excellent, excellent!!",1357948800,,309,4.220338983050848
4693662,5,B005GRTNVE,I bought this DVD almost 2 weeks ago and it came out today in my mailbox. This concert is so amazingly well done...I love it. You can see how well they interact with the audience and with each other. They sang these songs perfectly. This is a must-have for Il Divo or any opera music fans.,1357776000,,289,4.178571428571429

4693667,5,B005GRTNVE,"The camera people did an amazing job, the crowd was awesome, the songs unbelievale. It was as if you yourself was sitting front row. Each of the guys brought to the stage their unique personality. Watching in on your computer and putting the video full screen made it as if you could actually touch each of them.",1357344000,,312,4.491228070175438
4693668,3,B005GRTNVE,"Overall, good.  The accoustics in the first part of the concert were on the poor side and the guys weren't at their shining best.  However, they did warm up with the London Philharmonic Orchestra adjusting to their needs.  Once this happened, I thoroughly enjoyed the rest of the concert....of course, kicking myself for not being able to make use of my tickets to see the monumentally popular Il Divo live in Brisbane, in Jan 2012.

For this concert, they seem to have changed their usual style of who sings with whom, partnering Carlos with David quite often and hearing less of the old David and Urs combination.  It's good to try different things with the singers but I have to say I prefer the beautiful tenor voices of Urs and David together, with Carlos coming in with his strong bass sound, usually towards the end of a song or verse.  And Sebastien, as usual fits in well, anywhere and with anyone - but very often being the 'starter'.  However, having said what I did about my preference of voice combinations, the slightly different one in this concert was, nonetheless, very refreshing and enjoyable.

I gave this concert 3 stars purely because of the difficulty, in the opening part, of being able to hear the group clearly above the orchestra.  If not for that, then easily a 4 star rating.",1357257600,2,1304,4.6593886462882095
4693669,5,B005GRTNVE,"tHIS IS THE GREATEST ALBUM BY IL DIVO.  THEY ARE THE GREATEST.  EVERYTIME I HEAR THEM SING, I HOLD MY BREATH AND THINK JUST HOW WONDERFUL THEY ARE.  THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY MY FAVORITE GROUP AND INDIVIDUALLY.",1357084800,,204,4.611111111111111

4693676,3,B005GRTNVE,The video quality is grainy. Poor lighting which is oftentimes disruptive. There is a spotlight on the left side of the stage that would blind your focus every now and then. The Barcelona concert is far better. They are all great singers and that is undeniable. The style though is very predictable. Too much histrionics. I wonder why it was filmed 1080i not 1080p.,1355270400,6,365,4.71875

4693678,5,B005GRTNVE,"I bought this dvd/concert as it was available. The new songs are esplendid and goes direct to the heart. The sound is very good, the cameras do not take as much of the public and the feelings you can see in their faces. The public, english, are no as refined as the ones in tne concert ""An evening with IL DIVO"", from Barcelona. In the late one, the scenery, the public is very identified with IL DIVO, they gave and throw flowers to them, they sang with them. In England, the feeling is different, i don't know why. By this time, in my opinion, the Barcelona concert is the best, for far more. It is not the fault of  IL DIVO, but of someone in the staff, and don't forget that the Coliseum is an extraordinary place to film a concert.",1354838400,,736,4.219858156028369
