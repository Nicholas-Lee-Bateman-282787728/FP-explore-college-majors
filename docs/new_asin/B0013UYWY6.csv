The DVD appeared to be more shots of parents playing and singing w/ their children. I was looking for something with wider use.  If you are looking for something that has lots of movement, a variety of music , meaningful words, songs in ranges kids can sing (middle c to high c),VBS material, a project that you can use as your child ages, good hand motions ( you can simplify the motions for younger kids) I'd check out Jana Alayra's music/DVD's.",1334102400,,550,4.445544554455446
8253091,2,B0013UYWY6,"As a creative director at a church I was thrilled to find the Whirl-n-Worship album (not this product, but the music CD) for our preschool large group time, however, I was very disappointed when I received this companion DVD.  With the exception of a couple of songs (Bigger than Big and He's Got the Whole World) the segments are poorly produced.  Most just feature children and moms (with a sprinkling of Dads) marching around zoos, parks, and beaches.  I was hoping for motions, energy and higher production value that would give our kids something to actively do while watching the DVD.  For a DVD entitled ""Whirl-n-Worship"" the videos do little more than inspire sitting and zoning out.  There's no whirling here.

In short, buy the album, it's WELL worth the price, and leave the DVD on the shelf.",1226880000,2,803,4.782608695652174

The music is upbeat; lyrics are catchy and teach great truths about our God.  A MUST have for the car, home, church....anywhere and everywhere!!  (We also use this in our preschool worship at church!)",1214438400,,349,4.580645161290323
