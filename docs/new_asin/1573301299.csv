7798113,2,1573301299,"I wasn't sure how many stars to give for ""Six Gestures.""  The music played by Yo-Yo Ma is fabulous, however, I was dissapointed by the way the film was made.  The whole film is cut up and put back into sort of  an odd arrangement.  There is Yo-Yo Ma playing in Times Square, which I  thought was pretty cool, but then there is this guy who plays some sort of  a ""modern"" Bach.  Weird.  And the skating - you could hardly see  it - kinda blurry.  I was hoping they would show how they choregraphed the  skating or maybe more interaction between the musician and the skaters  (like the third Suite).  Overall, ""Six Gestures"" was a  dissapointment.",954028800,4,645,4.401709401709402
7798114,5,1573301299,"No one could have thought that figure skating routines could go so well with a solo instrumental piece, especially when skaters prefer to skate nowadays to songs.  The lost artistry is revived by Torvill and Dean in  this video, and ice skating has never been so graceful.",940204800,7,272,4.76595744680851
