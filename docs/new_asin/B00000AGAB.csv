8324641,5,B00000AGAB,"For filmmakers, this modest documentary should be an object lesson in how to think of using sounds when looking at things by means of film.  Seldom if ever have sounds been associated as precisely with visuals of which they are not 'effects', whether natural or musical.  Some combinations work better than others, but the overall achievement is staggering - and exemplifies what can powerfully be done by thoughtful and committed filmmakers for those of us whose attention spans, and ability to ponder, pass beyond seconds.",981158400,3,524,5.152941176470589
