8093782,5,B000BX8QZC,"Amazon has released this show in their digital service pretty well so far even having fixed the problems with season two by restoring the episodes that were initially missing. That being said it would seem that someone has screwed up again with season three. Episode 21 ""The Real World Part 2"" is missing and ""Bishop's Gambit"" plays instead wheres that should be episode 24, however the list goes from 23 to 25. It would also be nice to be able to buy the season as a whole since that would reduce the price by at least half instead of having to buy the episodes individually which brings the price to roughly fifty dollars! If the people in charge at amazon video can fix these problems than I will bring my rating up to five and change parts of my review as I hte to give an awesome show like this such a low rating.

2/12/16 - I forgot to mention that The Christmas Aliens is also out of order, it should be episode thirteen, not episode one.

Update 3/16/16 - Well, Bishop's Gambit has finally been inserted into it's own spot as episode twenty four, however episode twenty three is also still Bishop's Gambit so now we have two copies of the same episode. Can we please fix this so that The Real World - Part 2 is actually The Real World - Part 2?! Also The Christmas Aliens is still in the wrong spot. As I said above, it belongs in the list as episode number thirteen, not one. How difficult can it be to get these things put up correctly?! Still three stars until repairs are complete.

Update 3/5/17 - A year has passed and I still had yet to fullfill my promise. Everything seems to be in order now, ie all episodes are present and accounted for and the price has been corrected. The one episode The Christmas Aliens is still in the wrong spot but I guess we will just have to live with it. In any case, as promised I have raised my rating to five stars, now if they can get the rest of the seasons released we will really be in business.",1454716800,5,1948,4.273712737127371
