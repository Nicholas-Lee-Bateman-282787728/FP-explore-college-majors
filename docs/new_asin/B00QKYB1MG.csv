6876387,2,B00QKYB1MG,"A college student Justine is alone on campus over the Thanksgiving holiday. While spending the weekend quietly in a college dormitory, Justine is terrorized by a group of hooded stalkers.

Its a simple story, told so many times before, so you need something new to make your film interesting. A 2014 cat-and-mouse thriller Kristy doesnt have one, though one thing still surprised me.

That is that the film stars Haley Bennett and (hardly recognizable) Ashley Greene, the latter better known as Alice Cullen in the Twilight franchise. Though both actors are pretty good, the slow-burn approach of the film doesnt work because of its too slow pace that fails to build tension.",1420761600,2,675,5.017857142857143
6876388,4,B00QKYB1MG,"Kristy is for those who like a good anarchy film. Oh not the candy-ass ""The Purge"" type anarchy but the rebellion against conformity anarchy as presented by Black Flag's unsettling ""Family Man."" ""Kristy"" is a generic name for a ""pretty, pure, and blessed"" white bread girl who believes in God. In the film they claim, ""Kill Kristy and you kill God"" apparently for people who saw ""God's Not Dead.""

After they quickly establish the cult anarchist group, the delve into establishing the character of Justin Wills (Haley Bennett). She is smart and athletic excelling in science. They build her character showing us stuff that smartly plays back into the film. During Thanksgiving break, she is left alone at college in Madison Hall where the ballasts are going bad on all the fluorescent lights. Her rich girlfriend leaves her ""The Bimmer"" to drive. While out picking up some Ben and Jerry's comfort food, she is mistaken for a ""Kristy"" i.e. ""pretty hair, pretty car"" and becomes the target in what becomes a cat and mouse film. Unabashedly conforming to the movie formula, the group finds out Justin is no ""Kristy.""

Decent film, if you like that kind of cat and mouse stuff. Opens itself up for an infinite amount of interesting sequels.

8691814,5,B00QKYB1MG,"EXCELLENT HORROR MOVIE..WATCH IT NOW!!!!!
When I saw this movie previewed on Lifetime, I really wanted to see it. It must have been an accident, because Lifetime either never showed it or only showed it once and I missed it. Lifetime shows movies multiple times and ""Kristy"" was never repeated? Anyway, I just watched ""Kristy"" tonight and it was EXCELLENT!!!!!.. It is the best horror/suspense thriller I have seen in years! Absolutely brilliant!!!!
All horror movie makers take note, this is how to make a REAL horror movie. ""Kristy"" should be the blueprint to the future of horror movies. It has everything, horror, action, suspense, blood and gore.
Think ""The Strangers"" meet "" Halloween H20"" and ""Pranks"" meets ""Last Hill On The Left"" and very much ""Your Next"".
Unlike all of those movies, ""Kristy"" had something extra special. Almost the whole movie was an intense, edge of your seat, nail-biting, cat and mouse thrill ride.
This is the kind of movie you can watch again and again. The only thing that really is disturbing is, that I'm afraid that ""Kristy"" might start something bad in the world. People are sick and that's what make ""Kristy"" so real.
I am a HUGE horror movie fan for years. I think that the horror genre has become lazy and severely lacks in creativity. Though ""Kristy"" is nothing new, it puts the horror back into horror movies. ""Kristy"" reminds me of the magic of classic horror movies like ""Halloween"" ( and not Rob Zombie's massacre of it)
Don't forget to watch the very end after the credits for an extra scare of possible things to come!!!
""Kristy"" gets 5 stars with me. My hat is off to everyone involved in ""Kristy"".",1463875200,,1647,4.7421602787456445
8691815,4,B00QKYB1MG,"I do not have this on dvd, i watched it for free on netflix. I wish i did have this on dvd however, because it was a bit refreshing.
A cult-ish internet group is looking for Kristys, whom they chase, and murder and upload the videos online.
Enter Justine (Haley Bennet), who will be spending thanksgiving alone at her college. She hangs out with the security guard, plays every sport alone, until she realizes she needs to get some snacks. So she goes to a gas station in the middle of nowhere and bumps into a girl who says she is pretty, and yadda yadda. So Justine heads back on campus and mentions it to the security guard, and he says he will keep an eye out.
I won't go into too much more, but let's say, most of it is pretty unbelievable, but it kept me watching. Haley Bennet wasn't the best choice for a lead in this film, but it worked.",1462233600,,846,4.196319018404908
8691816,4,B00QKYB1MG,"Before I start the review I want to say Haley Bennett, who played the lead, Justine, did a great job. You can feel the struggle she is facing between having to work her way through college, having a rich boyfriend who doesnt completely get it, and being a tired student. I see shes playing the lead in the upcoming movie The Girl on the Train. The book was very good, and I can see Haley playing the part wonderfully.

Having spent some holidays alone at college over various vacations, this movie peaked my interest. Although this must be a very small college because she is the only student there. Makes for a good movie, but not very realistic. There are two security guards and another guy whos house is just on the outskirts of campus.

The opening of the film begins with a young woman being chased down and killed. Theres shaky camera work, and I was concerned that the rest of the movie would be like this, but thankfully it wasnt.

You get a sense of the Kristy Cult and why they are killing. Kristys are women who are pretty, and pure, and have a good life. Although Im not sure how they know they are pure, but were just along for the ride.

Kristy comes from Christ (although Kristy could be spelled Christy, but I guess thats too close to Christ and might confuse us??) And I think they are killing them because they don't like God. To me, this part could have been left out. But perhaps they thought people just killing because they are psycho would leave too many questions for the audience, so they needed a reason.

After that beginning it turned amusing. There was a cheap shot made for the audience to jump, and the flickering lights were explained away well enough. Then we break out into a montage where Justine is dancing around the dorms Breakfast Club style. We also see that she is very athletic from the run she takes and the swimming she does.
I will say, I would have been screwed if I was her, because she did a lot of running from the killers.

Justine goes on a last minute run to the gas station before the guy at the security booth goes home for the night. At the station she meets a weird woman, Violet, with lip piercings and what looked like Meth teeth. Theres a confrontation at the checkout that leaves Justine a bit shaken up.

Getting back to campus, she warns Wayne, the security guard, to be on the lookout for the weirdo from town. And then the fun begins.

The lights start flickering even more, and although Justine has an uneasy feeling, she takes her sweet time getting back to her room. When she gets back there, a video of the various girls that have been killed by the Kristy Cult is playing on her computer. Then her computer goes out and she cant get a signal. The door slowly starts to open, and we see Violet standing behind her.

Cue the cat and mouse scenes, which I will say were pretty good. My biggest problem is when she goes into the kitchen (that she works at) and doesnt grab a knife, or even a frying pan. She does do a couple of other things to throw the killers off, so that was good.

Then they're running all over campus, lots of tension building up, and I was yelling at the TV. I was getting really annoyed, mainly with the key issue. Justine needed a key to get into the doors, and it would have taken her a second, but it didn't seem like she locked any of the doors behind her. Even when the killers were not that close.
Also at the beginning it seemed like a lot of the dorm doors were open. If everyone went home for the holidays, they would have all been locked. And if Justine had locked her door, there is a good chance it would have took the killers a lot longer to find her.

The movie did redeem itself towards the end though. I enjoyed it, and they did bring the Kristy Cult full circle. If you enjoy cat and mouse thrillers, with a tough heroine, I would say you should watch this one.",1454112000,,3868,4.306740027510316
8691817,4,B00QKYB1MG,"It is hard to find a good thriller. I gave this one a try because I recognized the actors. It is very good and deserves a wide audience. The story is about a young college student alone on campus over a long holiday weekend. A murderous cult follows her to the college and then begins to stalk her from building to building in a cat and mouse game. The cult members are all the more ominous because they wear masks so they remain completely emotionless. Nor do they care when someone is killed, they just want to film the death for their online followers. A lot of chases in the hallways and across the campus grounds heighten the tension as they close in on their prey. The cast is great and the film is high quality. I turn off 9 out of 10 movies, but this one is very good and well worth watching.",1452729600,,800,4.201298701298701
8691818,3,B00QKYB1MG,Very good acting and direction but you must majorly suspend belief that no one anywhere on the campus or neighborhood called the police.,1449446400,,136,4.956521739130435
8691819,3,B00QKYB1MG,"Nothing much to add content-wise to the disparate yet observant surrounding reviews-- 2013's 'Kristy' is a variation on the standard-formula home-invasion flick done reasonably well, making it both predictable (more particularly for those who've tired of the genre) and entertaining (for those who haven't).  The good: the invaders are satisfactorily enigmatic (nothing worse than your prospective killers jawing you to death with cute exposition emphasizing just how crazy they are) and menacing; the victim is sympathetic; and the editing and pacing are sharp.  The bad: the story is routine; the college-campus setting is a bit too vast for its own good; and the whole thing is so (intentionally, I'm sure) under-lit, you go from being anxious to dumbly disoriented to annoyed within about ten minutes of 'the hunt''s commencing.  The ugly: whether you like the film or not, the unapologetic message here is that the world is going to Hell in a hand basket and pretty soon, kids, even Chuck Norris won't be able to save you, so you'd better stay in school, use the buddy system and, when possible, arm yourself.  3 stars.",1449014400,2,1124,5.092391304347826
8691820,5,B00QKYB1MG,"I will give this a five star for what it was.  A chase type thriller.  Nothing more.  People seem to expect Casablanca with horror incorporated.

I will tell you what I like and what I do not.  The do not's are so common in horror/thriller flicks that I can't complain enough about them to make the beef.

1. Kristy is believable.  She does a great job. (Justine, Haley, whatever you call her)
2. The boyfriend isn't around much (not too girly to nauseate before the chase)
3. The concept of selecting a girl that is fit makes the chase believable...for the most part.
4. The quick thinking is perhaps a bit over the top, but it speaks to knowing one's environment and recognizing a dead end.
5. When the girl is not high or boozed up, she may just be able to think straight enough to fight back.
6. The pace is good and the movie is better for it, sparing us too much bad acting.  Nothing worse than bad acting in a horror film.
7. Some great killing scenes.  I mean, that is what a slasher is about right?
8. Sense of fear is reasonable as you watch.
9. Women may like it because it did not get overly gory and girls are involved on both sides of the fence.
10. Both women are the best actors, so it makes it different.

What I didn't like

1. (Common) The bad guys are too damn good at everything.
2. (Common) Ending predictable.
3. I think the everybody dies scenario is over the top.  Can't someone just get hurt badly?
4. (Common) Bad guys get places too fast.  It is kind of like Halloween, where the guy stumbles along and he chases down a track star.
5. (Common) Escape scenes are OK for the most part, but a couple are dumb and should have been edited out.
6. (WAY TOO COMMON) Fog that comes and goes when convenient.
7. (WAY TOO COMMON) Can't leave well enough alone and screw it up at the very end.  (Not a horrific blunder in this film, but still corny)

But, within its class of films, it was done well.  I won't compare it to much higher budget films or The Shining, but that is not what this film was about and it is not on that level so it is an unfair comparison.  I would have liked to see more personality from the bad guys though that may have required acting, and I hate bad acting.

I have been watching a string of horror films, and they just don't typically get the budget to be very good.  Zombies are favorites because, well, they can be played by people.  Vampires are a ponzi scheme that is so ridiculously old hat they should not be allowed anymore.  Werewolves?  RU kidding me.  Another ponzi scheme of death.  But they are basically put a person in a Halloween costume low budget films for the most part.

At least horror films involving crazy people as the bad guys are believable.  Crazy people and nutcases are all around us.  Not too hard to believe that they could band together to hurt others is it?  What?  They already do?",1447977600,2,2862,4.277467411545624
8691821,2,B00QKYB1MG,"I saw another reviewer compare the film to the purge saying it's much better but at the end of the day it doesn't feel much different. Technically speaking it's a-ok. Good performances (though was it not in the budget to cast Ashley Greene as the lead?), nice lighting and cinematography, fine score. If you're not a horror fan you'll probably see and appreciate it for what it is, a pain ol' scary movie. (And maybe that's not such a bad thing. Many of us jaded horror fans have trouble with not over analyzing.)

 But at the end of the day, even filmically speaking, as a genre movie it offers nothing more than jump scares, screams, and chases, leading to a climax you've seen fifteen times. (If never another ""bad guy"" menacingly drags his phallic weapon with a scrape along a metal surface it'll be too soon.) But more than anything we have a group of psychotic youngsters terrorizing another youngster for no apparent reason other than to be ""scary"" and wistfully moan the film's title over and over at a girl whose name is not the title. And she's confused by this.

People die and no one cares and in the end it's horror fans who get the shaft. Because the casual viewer just looking for a few scares will likely find them here. And now we look like the a-holes.",1447459200,,1270,4.489177489177489
