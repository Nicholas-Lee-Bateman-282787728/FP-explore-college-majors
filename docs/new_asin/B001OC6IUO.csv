3729751,5,B001OC6IUO,"I have been looking for this movie in DVD for several years. I enjoy watching the older version, but Don Johnson does an exceptional performance in playing the part of Ben, ""the barn burner"" ! Cylbil Shepard is great too. I really like all the characters! I do not have a VHS anymore which makes me sad it only is available in VHS. Please make it in DVD! If it came out in 1985, I think enough time has passed to make a DVD for those of us who really need a ""fix"". A Don Johnson fix that is. ;).",1344038400,16,495,3.96
3729752,5,B001OC6IUO,"The 1985 version of Long Hot Summer is far superior to the original 1958 version with Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward.

Don Johnson, Judith Ivey, and Jason Robards are great, but I also love seeing Oak Alley, where it was filmed.

I have the 1985 version VHS tape, but it looks terrible on the new, supposedly better wide-screen TVs.  I would be devastated if my VCR eat it or my VCR died.  I understand one cannot purchase VCR units anymore.

I will be looking for a way to convert my VHS tape to digital media on my computer, but I would prefer to just buy the DVD version.  Somebody needs to get off their bloomin' #** and soon, PLEASE.",1341619200,20,639,4.3277310924369745
3729753,5,B001OC6IUO,"In my opinion this is the best version. Don Johnson is so hot in this movie that could be why I love it so... I really hope they release this on dvd since vhs is so out you know. I had a brand new tape and my ancient player ate it! I was so sad. I'm actually surprised this hasn't been released in dvd format, ah well hopefully enough people will sign up to be notified and they'll...as in I have no clue who decides if it gets to be a dvd or no will notice!",1341187200,14,458,3.78125

8330357,5,B001OC6IUO,"PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE Someone bring this movie to DVD format. I absolutely LOVE this movie, and think of it every summer, and wish I could watch it...it's not even on cable TV...so lame! All the actors were awesome, and Don Johnson would make any woman have a HOT Summer!! LOL!
Get off your A$$ and make it into a DVD PLEASE!!",1500422400,,327,4.377049180327869
8330358,5,B001OC6IUO,This was a wonderful use of incredible talent . . . Don Johnson simply blew this out of the water.  Still hoping that this will be released on some format other than the old VHS.  I wouldn't complain about price or anything else if we could get this movie.  I add my voice to the others.  Will you please make this available to us?  Thank you!,1473638400,,343,4.136363636363637
8330359,1,B001OC6IUO,"I do not mind remakes; am not opposed to them.  But this remake was overblown, added new elements that were unnecessary and excluded significant details that were essential.  Unlike the original 58 film, it strayed totally from the sensibility of the Faulkner short story.",1397088000,,272,5.159090909090909
8330360,5,B001OC6IUO,Top of my list that I want to watch over and over. I have a taped copy I can  barely see and know the lines by heart. Stellar performance every character. Brilliant example of mini-series of 80s. Please DVD please.,1377129600,3,214,4.35
8330361,5,B001OC6IUO,"This is my favorite version of this movie. Please, please, please bring it out on DVD, preferably Blu-ray. I know this will sell well. We have waited long enough.",1374278400,,162,4.620689655172414
8330362,5,B001OC6IUO,"I saw this version when it first aired in 1985 and the love affair between Ben Quick and Miss Nole is as captivating as Scarlett and Rhett.  Jason Robards as Will Varner, has a standout performance and Cibyl Shepard is perfect as Yula. The rest of the cast is spot-on as well.

I've been waiting for this movie to be available on DVD for ages and I don't know what the problem is, but as soon as I can find it, I'll be basking in the 'Long Hot Summer' over and over again...",1369958400,4,474,4.086021505376344
8330363,5,B001OC6IUO,I have signed up to be notified when this comes in and I still haven't heard anything! I have been waiting. Would like to know what's up with this? This is a great movie!!!,1362528000,3,172,4.088235294117647
8330364,5,B001OC6IUO,"Why this made for tv movie was swept under the carpet, I do not know.  With Cybill Shepard, Jason Robards, Judith Ivy, and Ava Gardner, you'd think it would have received more recognition.  All the performances in this movie are outstanding and unforgettable.  None of them, however, can compare to Don Johnson who truly showed the depth of his talent in this piece.  He is dangerous, hilarious, and sexy as hell.  Beyond that, he is a damn good actor.  What a crying shame it is that more producers did not tap his talent.  After this movie, I think we were all waiting for ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"".  Sigh.  Wasted time and impossible now.  But oh my goodness, the old south and Tennessee Williams never looked or sounded so good.  Summer is not summer until I see this Long Hot Summer.",1362268800,2,786,4.464788732394366
8330365,5,B001OC6IUO,"I'm an old woman, but feel young again when I see this, loved this movie in the 80's!  Much better than the older one with Paul Newman.  I also liked the sceens from Oak Ally, have visited there and it was a high light of my life, I seem drawn to the Civil War era with the big Plantations... Have just been waiting to time tranel!",1360627200,4,331,4.0
