1231841,2,B00000JFBV,"If you pick up this film expecting a horror movie, you will be disappointed.  What you will get is an artsy cameo filled flick.  HellCab follows a Chicago cab driver as he makes his rounds, picking up junkies, freaks and rape victims.  You should know that you can pick up a helluva alot of fares in an hour and a half film.  Most of the actors are on screen no more than 5 minutes and often less.  So, if you see Gillian Anderson or John Cusack on the cover and that's your reason for choosing this film, you will (again) be sadly disappointed.  At first I felt like there is no way that I will be able to stay awake long enough to see the credits roll.  But honestly, I just had to see who climbed into the cab next.  Also, I felt like all of this must tie in together somehow.  Well, it doesn't.  There is no resolution to any of the scenerios that are set up.  Worth 2 stars for the fact that I didn't just turn it off.  If you like Taxi Cab confessions, you may get some enjoyment out of this, but its different since you don't truly feel like a voyeur.",973209600,3,1058,4.08252427184466
1231842,5,B00000JFBV,"I just saw this movie tonight ... . This movie follows the dayof a Chicago cab driver, his passengers, and the brief glimpses of their lives, that make up his. There is no way that I can give you a synopsis of this movie without robbing it of it's genius. Just trust me. If you don't see this movie, you're seriously missing out.",966988800,7,329,4.238095238095238
1231843,4,B00000JFBV,"...Also known as ""Chicago Cab,"" and based on the play of that name, Hellcab is one of those flicks that follows around a cab driver (Paul Dillon, a fantastic actor who looks like Flea, sounds like Flea two octaves lower, is as well-cast as Flea in the highly-underrated  _Dudes_... well, you get the idea) as he picks up fares and wanders in and  out of the lives of the passengers. Tight, funny, high-pitched. Small parts  from Gillian Anderson, John Cusack (also one of the film's producers), and  best actress 2000 nominee Julianne Moore in the kind of scene that makes us  realize why she could be nominated for best actress. I mean, she's GOOD. My  video store has this under horror, no matter how much I try to get them to  change it. It ain't. Comedy/drama, and excellent comedy/drama at that.",961286400,9,800,4.631205673758865
7911938,5,B00000JFBV,Paul Dillon is superb in this movie. We don't get to know his character very well. Some scenes are funny and a scene of suspense but a very good flick!,1467417600,,151,4.066666666666666
7911939,4,B00000JFBV,"I caught this one on German TV one late night and it turned out to be a pleasant surprise.  ""Chicago Cab"" (1997) is that type of quirky film, made on a shoe-string budget, with cameos by bigger actors or character actors you've seen on TV, that you never heard about.

It concerns an odd cab driver played wonderfully by Paul Dillon, who seems a bit absent minded and odd, yet he's entirely harmless.  The denizens of the city take his cab and what follows is his experience with these strange and sometimes sick people.  Some of the pieces are poignant.

7911941,4,B00000JFBV,"Like 90's art films? You'll like this.  I was obsessed with it in high school in the 90's. I appreciate it on that level, but truthfully it bored me a little now.  It's very slow moving and never comes to any climax.",1369612800,,216,4.119047619047619

7911945,5,B00000JFBV,"HELLCAB ran for three minutes short of forever as a late-night play in Chicago.  It featured Chicago rock'n'roll acting at its best: simple set, talented ensemble playing multiple parts, juxtaposition of drama and comedy, respect for a working person's perspective.  The film retains much of this.  Yes, instead of a handful of actors constantly slipping into different skins you have a larger cast playing a series of cameos -- but these are almost all acting gems.  The cab driver becomes a representative of us in the audience: trying to make our way through a complex world without being swallowed up by it, trying to salvage moments of honor and grace in an environment oblivious to both.  Would make -- yes -- a terrific companion piece to TAXI DRIVER.",1189641600,3,758,4.890625
7911946,4,B00000JFBV,"Hellcab is an independent film based upon the play by the same name.  Unfortunately, Vidmark must have thought the title meant it was a horror film and packaged it as such.  It is not horror.
The story, what little there actually is, follows a hardworking and honest cabdriver during the Winter Solstice, the day with the longest night.  A newspaper blurb points out that many cultures had believed the world would be swallowed by the cold and the dark.
The driver starts his day early by taking a family to church (on Thursday).  After they try to convert him, his day progresses through high and lows and gives glimpses into the lives of dozens of colorful characters.  From a pregnant woman, to a drunk lady who says she loves him; from druggies to lawyers; from jerks to generally nice people.  We see all kinds climb into this cab.
But all is not rosy on this darkest of days.  Many issues are looked at, especially racism.  At one point the driver becomes scared of the South Side and heads North only to pick up a white guy who is his scariest customer of the day.  But in the end, when he at what might be his lowest, the driver takes a fare from a man who offers him some sound advice.
Paul Dillon shines as the cabdriver.  His excellent performance is backed up by such talents as Gillian Anderson, John Cusack, Michael Ironsides, Laurie Metcalf and Julianne Moore.  While sometimes disturbing and sometimes touching, this is not a film you will forget.",1073433600,4,1463,4.567049808429119
7911947,4,B00000JFBV,"I would have to admit that upon watching the first half hour of the film, I did wonder 'where is this going'? But beneath the eccentric characters, was a hidden message about anger, and the power to forgive yourself and others.  The story is focused on a Chicago Cabbie, who is having what could arguably be called the worst day of his career. His fare is just seemingly crowded with loonie after loonie- including false exhibitionists, teenagers with pain- in- the- behind boyfriends, a
couple having a *very* personal argument, and just plain wierdos.  The cabbie's day get's progressively worse, if that's even possible. Door handles fly off and huge headaches are on the  agenda. But toward the very end, there's a very important fare which could possibly change the cabbie's entire point of view on Christmas and the value of love and belief.  I know this may sound slightly strange and corny all at the same time, but the film really is quite interesting, even if
there are moments when one might turn away from the camera in embarassment. The all star cast includes Gillian Anderson ('The mighty', 'Playing by Heart', and 'House of Mirth'), Julianne  Moore ('Hannibal,' 'Cookie's Fortune') and John Cusak ('High Fidelity', 'Being John Malkovic'). The characters are all played  with a perfect mixture of bitter and sweet, and the idea is surely fresh and origional. If you're willing to watch strange plots, 'Hellcab' is for you.",988070400,3,1436,4.937759336099585
