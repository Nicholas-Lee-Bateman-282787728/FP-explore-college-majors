8031585,3,B0002T7YHQ,"I bought 2 of these video concert of Victor and Ana Belen, since I wanted to give one copy as a gift and the other one for me to keep. I had previously seen it in YouTube and I have always wanted to have it, but I am very disappointed with the poor quality audio -is not  good at all-. I had to put the volume all the way up to appreciate all concert. I strongly believe that who ever made these copies did not pay attention about the quality of sound.

Video quality is great, as the whole concert is, but the sounds is poor.",1380672000,2,526,3.952830188679245
