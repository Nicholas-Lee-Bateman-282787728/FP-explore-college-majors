Spoilers

DISC. 1

1. PAT BERRY VS SHAWN JORDAN-this one does not last long as most people thought that it would not. These two heavyweights are finishers and Berry is one of my all time favorites. They trade a few shots to start the fight out with. Berry comes with a few kicks but ends up getting nailed with a few nasty uppercuts that send him down. Jordan just continues with an onslaught of punches to get the stoppage win.

2. ALEXIS DAVIS VS ROSI SEXTON-I am a huge WMMA fan and have to see the ladies every time they are on the card. Nine times out of ten they steal the show but they always show why they deserve all the respect that the men get. The fight starts out wonderful as they meet up and exchange blows like crazy. Davis pushes Rosi to the cage and clinches working some nice knees. They eventually break with Rosi getting out of a bad situation and ending up on top only to fall into a triangle. Rosi fights through it and lands some nice ground and pound as Davis continues to work the triangle. As the second round starts they trade once again with Rosi getting Davis down. Davis remains calm and makes her way on top and works for an arm triangle and drops some shots on her. The round ends with Alexis taking Rosis back and working for a choke and finish landing some shots after she flattens her out. The third round starts out with them throwing a few shots until they lock up. Davis shows her BJJ skills wonderfully by taking Rosis back oh so pretty and locks in the body triangle during a roll. Still she eventually ends up on her back with Rosi landing some good shots but the round ends with them in the exact opposite spots. Davis ends up getting the UD.

3. RYAN JIMMO VS IGOR POKRAJAC-the first round between these two is spent mostly on the cage in the clinch. The ref has to break them the entire time but towards the end they land some big shots, Igor in particular. The second round starts fast with Jimmo landing a huge shot that wobbles then drops Igor. This allows him to get Igor down and work from there, the round ends with Jimmo in side control. The third round sees Jimmo get Igor down once again and maintain that position for most of the round. Igor threatens with a guillotine choke but Jimmo gets the UD win.

4. ROY NELSON VS STIPE MIOCIC-one of the fights I was most looking forward to as I love Big Country Roy Nelson. Now Roy had just fought six weeks earlier knocking out Cheick Kongo. This first round started out with both men looking pretty even but as it went on Miocic started landing like crazy picking Roy apart. The second round is pretty much all Stipe as he continues to pick Roy apart but Roy stays in there proving how tough he is. The final round is once again all Stipe as he dominates on the feet and gets the UD win. This fight hurt to watch but Stipe looked excellent.

5. DAN HENDERSON VS RASHAD EVANS-the other fight I was really looking forward to since I love Hendo but also like Rashad. The fight is pretty even with each guy landing some good shots moving in and out. Towards the end of the round Hendo lands a very stiff left jab that rocks Rashad. The second round is another pretty even one with some time spent exchanging and on the fence. Rashad starts strong with a nice flurry that sends Hendo back. The final round is a good one with Rashad looking a little better in this round but I still thought he lost the fight two rounds to one. Only one judge agreed with me as Rashad gets the split D.

DISC. 2

1. DUSTIN PAGUE VS YVES JABOUIN-excellent opening round for the first fight of the night as Yves gets Pague down wonderfully and then they continue on the ground scrambling and going for submission attempts and trading positions. Great first round followed by a great second round. They start throwing some great shots followed by Dustin getting the trip this time and starting to pound on Yves. Yves gets close to getting choked out by a rear naked choke but keeps fighting. He eventually gets on top with Dustin looking for more subs, great fight. The final round starts with Yves getting the takedown as his corner requested. From there they spend some time going back and forth with Yves getting out of some bad spots to end up on top again. Dustin looks for the submissions but cant finish so it goes to the judges, Yves gets the split D but I don't see how he won the fight. I thought Dustin won but it was still a great fight.

2. JOHN MAGUIRE VS MITCH CLARKE-Clarke and Maguire give us a good first round with Clarke landing a bit more especially with kicks. There is an unfortunate eye poke but the fight continues with some time spent on the cage. John holds onto Mitch on the cage I like how Mitch landed those elbows to Johns forearm. The second round is mostly Maguire as he gets Mitch down and keeps him there for a good portion of the fight. Once up Clarke starts to land once again but they end with John trying for a rear naked choke. The final round sees Mitch landing more shots so John takes him down again and looks for the rear naked. Good fight that goes the distance and sees Clarke get the UD.

3. ROLAND DELMORE VS EDWIN FIGUEROA-this fight ended up being a great battle on the ground as Delmore gets Edwin down and is all over him with submission attempts. Edwin fights out of everyone and ends up on top a few times but Roland is all over him with submissions from top and bottom. The second round looks just like the first and is just as fun but Figueroa locks in a triangle of his own at one point, excellent fight. The third round was another example of Delmores grappling skills but Edwin did land some good shots during this round. Roland wins by UD.

4. SEAN PIERSON VS KENNY ROBERTSON-the opening round between these two is great as they spend time on the ground and on the feet. Good back and forth with each looking good different points. Another good round but this one is spent on the feet mostly with them trading. The round ends with Robertson on top. The third and final round is mostly Kennys as he hurts Sean on the feet with an elbow and then gets him down and gets Seans back. Sean gets the majority D

5. SAM STOUT VS JAMES KRAUSE-great opening round as these two trade some good shots including Sam getting hit with a nice knee. The first round was a good one but it leaned towards Krause. The second round would see them both land and Krause end up on top once again on the ground. The final round is another good back and forth one that ends with Krause getting a win by way of guillotine.

6. JAKE SHIELDS VS TYRON WOODLEY-this was one of the fights I was most looking forward to as Shields is one of my favorites and I also like Tyron. My girls favorite fighter ever is Jake Shields so she was all about him fighting here. The first round I am sure surprised most as it was all on the feet. Tyron landed some good shots but Shields stayed busier and landed more with kicks and knees. When they were in clinch it was Shields that was pushing for the takedown but Woodley landed some good short shots to the body. Woodley also landed a nice leg kick that put Shields down. The second round looks just like the first including Shields getting dropped by a leg kick. The final round was another one that looked like the first two except Woodley landed a nice spinning back fist. But it would be Shields who wins this fight by split D, I personally thought he straight won the fight.

8591210,3,B00DB9377K,"I should probably say right off the bat that the fight I was looking most forward to when this card was initially finalized was scrapped.  That was supposed to be a rematch between Maurcio ""Shogun"" Rua and Antnio Rogrio Nogueira, which was one of the best PRIDE fights ever.  So, when it was announced that Nogueira was injured during training my initial displeasure kind of soured my excitement for this card but there was plenty to still be excited about, at least on paper.

Much of the preliminary bouts are heavily grappling matches.  While this isn't necessarily a bad thing, most of the fighters used a significant amount of energy during round one and the early part of two so by the third round they appear rather tired.  Add that to the fact that all of the prelims, with the exception of one, end by decision this may not be a strong selling point for a number of fans.  Most of the fights aren't bad but they aren't show stealers (although there is a particularly bloody prelim between Sam Stout and James Krause that may be worth checking out).

I think that it's best that the first fight of the main card was set up between Pat Barry and Shawn Jordan.  Pat Barry is easily one of the most well liked fighters among UFC fans and for good reason; he's got an incredibly likeable personality that borders on goofy and also presents some of the best overall striking in the heavyweight division.  Couple that together with his pension for having really entertaining fights or straight out deadly knockouts he's a warm welcome to a card.  Shawn Jordan carries something of the same vibe.  He's a relative newcomer to the UFC but that hasn't stopped him from making an impression.  Since coming over from StrikeForce in 2012 he's TKO'd two fighters and only lost to Cheick Kongo by decision.  He's a rather athletic heavyweight known more for the power in his hands then the wrestling base of his past.  Given how most of the prelims played out it was a welcome change that his fight should end as quickly as it did.  Not only is it a quick finish (over before the halfway mark of the first round) but it's a pretty strong message to the rest of the division that the winner is a guy who is meant to be taken seriously.

Since the first female UFC bout between Ronda Rousey and Liz Carmouche the women's division in the UFC has enjoyed some extremely good fights.  Let me say that right away this particular bout may be the least impressionable fight so far in the women's run of the company but if that's the case then I am most certainly happy.  Point being, Alexis Davis and Rosi Sexton put on a hell of a show.  This fight started off right away with a scary predicament for one fighter and yet somehow she persevered through it.  The rest of the fight was oddly close given how shaky the first round was and it ended with both fighters still fighting hard.  These are one of those great fights where, having no prior experience with either fighter, it ended with me having a lot of respect for both fighters.  Even though there was only one victor the lost certainly demonstrated an amazing amount of heart.

Ryan Jimmo is most well known as the man who tied for the fastest knockout in UFC history (07 seconds if you were wondering).  He lost his next bout and even though he looked good in the first round with a solid head kick he was unable to gain back significant control in rounds two or three.  It's funny, as a guy known more for his grappling Jimmo has certainly made a name for himself as as solid striker.  His opponent, Igor Pokrajac, on the other hand is known for being a striker.  Since competing in the UFC from 2009 he's had more victories than not but his last two bouts have ended on the poorer end.  So, with both fighters looking to redeem themselves I imagined that they would both come out of the gates looking to make a big statement and that sort of happened.  What I thought would be a more mixed fight of styles largely ended up being a grappling match, although I should mention there is an important moment of striking that occurred.  Overall a good strategy used to win, just not overly exciting.

The co-main event involved Roy Nelson fighting Stipe Miocic.  Roy Nelson is known for his big right hand and a pension for having one of the best chins in the business.  More often than not his fights turn into scraps or end by quick knockout.  Stipe Miocic has made something of a reputation for himself as well.  He entered the UFC with only six fights under his belt and has gone on to win three of his last four fights.  So, with two good strikers against each other this fight played out in a typical fashion of the less exciting kind.  For those fans who can remember, think back to UFC 76 (a pay-per-view with the name ""Knockout"" where there wasn't a single TKO finish.  Irony.) when Chuck Liddell fought Keith Jardine.  You have two well known strikers fighting against each other but one fighter has a distinct edge.  This fight suffers from what I like to call the ""limelight effect"".  If you fight enough on the big card people will eventually figure out your strategy and good ways to counter it.  That's exactly what happened here, although as opposed to leg kicks which Jardine was widely credited with as being the tool of success this was just good strategy by the victor.  The loser didn't look weak, he just came in as he usually does and was unable to change up his game enough to deal with the victor's game plan.  The fight isn't bad but it was more about fighting smart which was technical and less on the exciting part.  A good showing though.

The main event with Dan Henderson fighting against Rashad Evans was a tricky fight on paper.  Both good wrestlers with strong power in their hands (although most would agree Henderson has an advantage here) this fight looked like it could be a good one.  Dan Henderson is a living legend having fought in PRIDE, StrikeFroce (winning titles in both organizations), and the UFC he is a man who's age doesn't seem to play as much a factor as you would think.  His last fight ended in a loss as he was unable to come up with a good strategy to deal with Lyoto Machida's style of dodging and deal out his ""H-Bomb"".  Rashad Evans was in a similar situation.  His last fight was also a loss but on a much bigger scale.  His fight with Antnio Rogrio Nogueira was so painful to watch it makes me sad just remembering it.  He needed to win in a big, BIG way to get rid of that awful stain.  As styles often make fights a fight between two wrestlers has the potential for going all over the place which is sort of what happened.  Different tactics were used by both fighters but ultimately it didn't leave a solid enough impression by the fans or judges to warrant the kind of emergency I thought these fighters were going to go by.  Instead the fight was close but in a lackluster way.  Unfortunate too as this fight was billed as a contender's fight but neither competitor really looked strong enough at any point to really make me think he would give the current champion, Jon Jones, any trouble.

Overall, it's hard to say that this card is worth buying.  The first two bouts on the main card are about as good as it gets but neither are so amazing that they would warrant a buy for the whole card.  If you have the chance to watch it, by all means, watch it but I would recommend you save your money for another event.",1371513600,4,7423,4.434686346863469
