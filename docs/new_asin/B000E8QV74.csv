2510224,4,B000E8QV74,I do feel some compassion towards Charles and Camilla and this DVD enhanced that. Also for Dianna who also was part of this mess. In the 21st century that will never recur.,1403395200,3,172,4.40625
2510225,3,B000E8QV74,"I'M NOT QUITE SURE WHAT TO SAY ABOUT THIS STORY
THERE ARE PARTS THAT SEEM VERY REAL AND PARTS THAT SEEM LIKE CHARLES IS WHIPPED CRAZY IN LOVE THE MAIN TWO ACTORS TO ME HAVE VERY LITTLE PASSION",1403049600,2,192,4.078947368421052
2510226,5,B000E8QV74,Mr. Fox can portray members of the Monarchy like he is one.  Olivia Poulet is convincing and endearing as Camilla.  I think this is the real version of the fairy tale love story.,1397001600,3,178,4.363636363636363
2510227,1,B000E8QV74,The worst movie and acting in an account of Charles and Camilla really awful film. I had high hopes for some background an alternate version of a story we all know but it failed cinematically on many levels.,1384300800,,207,4.473684210526316
2510228,4,B000E8QV74,"I am not a big fan of the reinacted bio-doc-dramas. Yes, the acting is not the best. I got this one because I wanted to hear the other side of the story from Charles' side. We all heard Di's version. It does show how he was backed into a corner & not given much of a choice. The summery of this one the royal family should of change the rules so that no one would have gotten hurt; and Charles wouldn't have cheated. It's a ok watch.",1371254400,2,433,3.9885057471264367
2510229,5,B000E8QV74,"An honest representation of a beautiful love story.
It sheds a new light on Prince Charles' behavior.
Good acting by Laurence Fox.",1355097600,,130,4.954545454545454
2510230,5,B000E8QV74,"I was a bit nervous about this turning out to be cheesy, but I really enjoyed it immensely.  I've already watched it a few times!  The acting by the two main actors was just wonderful and entertaining.  Great fun!!",1331078400,8,214,4.435897435897436
2510231,4,B000E8QV74,"It gives an objective perspective of the ""other side of the story"" - as each and every real-life drama has. We are used to see Diana's saga from her perspective - this film gives you a background of Charles'pains, tribulations, and his own unfulfilled love.",1258502400,11,257,4.733333333333333
2510232,1,B000E8QV74,"It's 1971, and Camilla Shand tires of waiting for Andrew Parker-Bowles to propose, so she goes after his friend, Prince Charles, to make Andrew jealous. Charles is an awkward, pompous, royal bore, but Camilla is determined and before long, they're having an affair.

This 2005 movie had the difficult task of making a movie without a hero. The two title characters are portrayed in the worst possible light, making them self-absorbed and heartless. None of the actors look anything like their real counterparts and though the settings are regal, the whole thing smacks of sensationalism.

The dialogue has, of course, been fabricated and no one outside of the principals knows the real story, but the movie left me feeling disgusted on many levels.",1208908800,14,748,5.073170731707317
2510233,5,B000E8QV74,"This movie was a delight from the opening credits onward. Starting with what my husband called ""tampon package colors"" in the opening credit sequence to their first (historically inaccurate) meeting involving the lusty Camilla Shand throwing herself at the virginal-acting Prince of Wales, this made-for-TV movie is sheer entertainment. It continues through ""Gladys and Fred's"" ongoing affair, Charles' string of possible future Queens (including a nude model ogled by one of his brothers--presumably Randy Andy) and the introduction of a painfully shy, wide-eyed Lady Diana Spencer, ending with a glum Charles suiting up for his (first) wedding.

The movie is the first treatment I've ever seen that is actually sympathetic to Camilla Parker-Bowles, although part of that has to do with the actress playing her being better-looking than CPB. The actor who played Charles was dead-on (albeit slightly better-looking as well), down to the voice--he's worlds above the actor who played Charles in the recent Helen Mirren biopic ""The Queen."" The actors who played Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip were completely unrecognizable for their roles, and the Diana character held little of the charm of the real Diana, although I imagine the look of terror/innocence in the actress' eyes accurately conveyed the real emotional state of the actual Princess.

This movie has excellent production values for a made-for-TV movie, and yet never for a moment do you forget where it comes from. Historically inaccurate in parts (pointed out by a disclaimer at the beginning), campy in others, it is surprisingly touching and altogether superior to other ""so bad it's good"" films. It truly has something for everyone.",1165795200,22,1701,5.367041198501872
8107441,1,B000E8QV74,"The movie was just awful. Dialog from The Daily Mail newspaper. Boring. It is hard to come up with new, true information about people who won't or cant be forthcoming. And why would they?",1513123200,,187,4.529411764705882
8107442,4,B000E8QV74,"This follows their relationship from the 1970's when she strolls up to him at a polo match and tokes on a smoke. They have a relationship and she marries another guy. Charles bumbles through a collection of women while being dogged by his overbearing parents and questionable counseled by a favorite uncle.

When he meet the young/virginal Diana she fits the bill for Royal Marriage Material. Diana becomes aware of Camilla and is Not happy. Engaging, initially a bit slow but picks up. Kissing.",1504310400,,495,4.892857142857143
8107443,2,B000E8QV74,"A sad effort.  Lawrence Fox is excellent as Charles.  The problem is, Charles is something of a stick: hates his father but is a total wimp in his presence; is socially inept despite years of training; and feels sorry for himself.  With so little to recommend him personally, the efforts to pair him off with a suitable mate feel like an uphill battle.  Camilla's affection seem to be stoked mostly by the rejection of her own husband.  There is little in their relationship to arouse our admiration or concern: two rich snobs who believe they have every right to cheat those who trust them.  But the main problem is that when the central character in a movie is dull as dishwater it is impossible to get interested in what happens to them.",1464912000,,740,4.568181818181818

8107449,4,B000E8QV74,"It's truly not bad. Laurence Fox is always a gem, and Olivia is very good as Camilla.  We can only truly imagine what these two people have shared, therefore this is written well, although some dialog a bit unreal sounding.  Overall, it's worth a watch and it ends, thankfully, right before Charles gets married.",1410912000,3,312,4.7592592592592595
