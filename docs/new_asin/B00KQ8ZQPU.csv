8660747,1,B00KQ8ZQPU,"Just watched the first 5 minutes and am astounded at how bad the subtitles are!!!  Don't buy this version unless you understand Japanese.  I don't ""hate it"" because I do understand the language and love the story, but really, the subtitles are SO PATHETICALLY BAD as to skew the meaning of the conversations and ruin your experience if you're not getting the spoken language.

20 min. in -- I have to revise my previous comment:  The English subtitles are TOTAL NONSENSE; GOBBLEDEGOOK.  They don't merely skew meaning; they are mostly UNRELATED to the meaning or contradict it altogether.  Don't believe a word of it.",1473379200,,617,4.884615384615385

8660749,5,B00KQ8ZQPU,I love this movie.  It drags you through all the emotions and made me cry a couple of times.  A story about the life of a child to adulthood.,1436659200,,141,3.8275862068965516
8660750,1,B00KQ8ZQPU,"The subtitles were just awful, ruining the experience.  The viewer is meant to think that Shunsaku is killed because he is a vagrant, not because he has deserted from the army, and that Oshin's grandmother has become a hard working maid in Sakata, mainly due to lazy subtitling.",1431734400,,278,4.791666666666667
8660751,3,B00KQ8ZQPU,"This is NOT the full show. It is maybe a quarter of the full show.

For some reason I thought it was the full show and the page gave me no reason to think otherwise.",1421366400,4,165,3.7142857142857144

8660753,5,B00KQ8ZQPU,"It is very good movie.  If you want to know the life and human relationship of the country side of old, old Japan, it is very interesting movie.",1405209600,,144,4.142857142857143
