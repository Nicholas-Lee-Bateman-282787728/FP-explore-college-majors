3498701,5,B001BSBBO4,The dvd's were great. It was nice watching them in color for the first time after watching then in black and white for so many years.,1293667200,4,133,4.153846153846154
3498702,3,B001BSBBO4,"We all loved the Little Rascals and Our Gang comedies as kids. They are still, in many ways, fun to watch. Unfortunately they are also a sign of their time in the way African Americans are depicted. On a positive note the gang is multiethnic and all get into the same kind of trouble and silly situations. I did cringe while watching with my five year old grandson when racial stereotypes were depicted. I noted which discs NOT to let him watch again.",1292371200,,451,4.445783132530121
3498703,5,B001BSBBO4,"Just had a group of folks over and decide to play this just to see their reactions. I have to say besides the great comedy element of the Little Rascals, they were all really surprised at how new and fresh the episodes looked in the colorized process. Many of them saying that for the first time they were able to notice things (i.e. costume, and set designs) they hadn't when they first saw the Rascals in black & white. Also, because it appears very realistic with color they were able to have a real feel for the life/era (1930's). But best of all everybody just wanted and stayed to see all the episodes, and then some.",1282435200,7,623,4.379310344827586
3498704,5,B001BSBBO4,I have every episode of the Little Rascals in B&W.  My grand children would not watch the B&W DVD's but they love the color versions. Being an old buzzard I prefer the B&W.  Great deal.,1276387200,17,185,4.257142857142857
3498705,5,B001BSBBO4,"I loved it, the color is ok and I am amazed that my grandchildren can't stop watching them, and of course it's something they look forward to when they come visit, after all these years the rascals are a great show.",1269475200,9,215,4.2682926829268295
3498706,5,B001BSBBO4,Good family fun movie for family night.  Loved it as a kid.  Would recommend seller as they mailed a clean well packed DVD package.,1253491200,3,131,4.416666666666667
3498707,5,B001BSBBO4,"These videos are super fun, turn-your-brain-off humor. The slapstick comedy is so hilarious that  my 6 and 8 year old kids both have a great time with these videos. Spanky and Stimey are their favorite actors, and my kids completely understood that slapstick is make believe and would cause great harm if actually conducted in real life, for example,  smacking someone on the head with a hammer, or dragging someone by his legs over a board with nails pointed upward...you get the idea. The politically incorrect lines are way over their heads, so I wouldn't put to much weight on this with your purchase decision.  I would say a lot of the sexual innuendos in todays' PG comic movies or on the Disney channel are probably more of a concern than a few of the stereotypes depicted in a few of the videos. A nice background of the Little Rascals can be found on [...]",1231718400,28,865,4.567741935483871

3498741,5,B001BSBBO4,"I remember watching the Little Rascals as a kid many many years ago, and thought the grandkids would like this when they come over. I like the fact that it is colorized or if you prefer you can also watch it in black and white. The stories are very cute and the kids are even cuter. So glad we bought this and I am sure the 6 & 10 year old grandsons will love it. The price was great as well there are 3 discs and quite a few episodes on them so lots of fun clean entertainment for the whole family.",1354752000,,499,3.9019607843137254
3498742,5,B001BSBBO4,"Having loved Our Gang since watching their short B/W films as a kid, and being an owner of the definitive Cabin Fever box DVD set, I was very skeptical about this product, and only decided to take a chance when I found them at a bargain, sale price.

But I was extremely impressed with the results.  Colorization has come a LONG way since the early attempts that I recall seeing, with their overly-soft pictures, blurry outlines, and bland colors.  Legend has done an amazing job with these films, and -- were I not familiar with the originals -- I would in many cases not have guessed that they were not originally filmed in color.  The palettes they use are generally true and lifelike, but also period appropriate, and not so vivid as to be jarring.  I heartily agree with another reviewer who noted that she now notices a lot of details that had not stood out in the original, monochromatic presentation, which I would not have guessed until I saw it for myself.

Whatever the film purist in me may think, the new, colorized versions are also FAR better at holding our kids' attention than the original black-and-white prints.

So, particularly for the price, I strongly recommend giving these a try, even if you own the Cabin Fever/Vivendi B/W release.",1353196800,,1257,4.6863636363636365
3498743,5,B001BSBBO4,"It was nice to see these old films of the Little Rascals in color. It, of course, makes it more viewable for the younger generation.
However, in color or black and white these films are ""great entertainment"".
