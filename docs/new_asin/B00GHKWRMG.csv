8623251,5,B00GHKWRMG,"OMG! Where do I begin!! I fully bought this thinking it was going to be a cute movie and that's it.  Boy was I wrong!! I loved it!!!! The story is truly great, all the actors where awesome, especially the male lead Ram!! **sigh**  I love how in order for ram to win the girls heart and her brothers approval he must prove himself to be more than a typical rich kid but he has to honestly work hard (physically) to prove worthy of her.  The music is catchy and beautiful and the villains were truly horrible, there came a point where I wished I could punch every one of them.  The first 5 minutes had me crying because I love the relationship Sona and her brother had! It was really so sweet the way he would take care of her sister and was very protective!  After I watched this movie I totally want a horse, even if its a fake horse lol (when you watch it you will know what I am talking about lol)  My brother told me after we watched it that this is his second favorite Indian movie after our all time favorite Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi (Love you SRK!!!)  Give this beautiful movie a chance and you will be highly entertained!!  and did I mentioned it was funny!! I really can't stop smiling after I watched this movie!!!",1398384000,,1218,4.1752136752136755

This movie is about a village girl attending her best friends wedding when she meets the brides nri cousin....there is some irritation on her side in the beginning but his persistent chipper attitude and constant attention finally wins her over.....then comes the climax and he must prove his love for her to win over her brother. The chemistry between these two actors was great, the story itself was super cute and a new take on a classic theme....both actors were new to me but I immediately connected with them that it didn't matter at all! Get ready for a fun entertaining rom com with some action thrown in! And of course you'll enjoy the songs it's Prabhu deva.... Need I say more! :)",1397347200,,780,4.539007092198582
