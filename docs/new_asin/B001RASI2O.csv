3774557,5,B001RASI2O,I put the DVD in the car's dvd player and in two weeks I realised my daughet knew her colors. that's an excellent DVD. My daughet is 4 years old ans my son is 2. For both of my kids arabic is a third language after english and french. The DVD has really good picture and nice songs like all the baby Einstein DVD. My kids laugh when they watch it ao id also fun.,1297555200,2,362,3.84
3774558,5,B001RASI2O,"All four DVDs are a must buy if you or your children want to learn Arabic.  I have a daughter and son who both absolutely love the Little Thinking Minds DVDs.  We got the Animals DVD first and they started watching it at 6 months.  They were hooked.  It really helped them learn the names of all the animals and subsequently the colors and shapes and many nursery rhymes in Arabic.  The latest ""Numbers from 1-10"" has wonderful songs and the production is great.  You can compare them to Baby Einstein DVDs which my kids love as well.  We can't wait for the next one to come out.",1291334400,2,579,4.305555555555555

8337627,5,B001RASI2O,"what a great product!. I bought this a long time for my daughter who is part middle eastern so I want her to become bilingual. the words in the video are very clear and easy to learn. as an adult I found myself watching along and picking up words like ""azarag"" and ""aswood"" hey, who needs a tutor! and a great price. I would normally pay that price for any other kids movie in a department store and this one is educational as well! my daughter has outgrown this video and now I play it for my 1year old!!
