763970,4,6304039301,Yup they took tons of legends and myths about Wild Bill and shoe-horned em all into this flick featuring wonderful performances by the entire cast. Bridges performance as Wild Bill doesnt completely white-wash the character and so you may or may not like that. I enjoyed it and as a student of the life and legend of James Butler Hickok I had a good time spotting the myths and legends used to make this film. It sure seems to me that director Hill had to make a lot of cuts to decrease the running time of this film and I bet the director's cut would be much better. Still this is what it is and it's not bad and in fact it's damn fun. Just remember that this isn't a documentary. Fans of the legends and myhts of Wild Bill may enjoy it more than others. I did.,1095379200,4,762,4.155405405405405
763971,1,6304039301,"Hollywood just can't make Westerns anymore. And believe me, this one is ""living proof"". What a stinkeroo! I bet the real ""Wild Bill"" is more than turning over in his grave! Granted, there are a lot of historical facts that creep into the story, like the fact that Hickok was developing glaucoma, and he spent time in a drug induced haze in the opium parlours. But the rest is pure hogwash. If this is the best that Jeff Daniels can do, then Jeff my boy, HANG IT UP. He staggered through this mess like a drunken man. Even more annoying were the flash backs that popped up. It wasn't so much that, it just made the story hard to follow. Maybe one day, Hollywood will regain it's stride like it did with SILVERADO, but ignore this one.",1074816000,5,733,4.357664233576642
763972,4,6304039301,"James Butler ""Wild Bill"" Hickok was shot dead from behind in a Deadwood, South Dakota saloon holding what is now known as the ""Deadman's Hand"" of aces and eights.  This 1995 film from director Walter Hill (""The Long Riders"") is not so much about the infamous death or even the storied life of ""Wild Bill"" (Jeff Bridges) but more the man's death wish.  The film is an exploration of the legend and not the recreation of history; Jack McCall (David Arquette, in a very controlled performance of his usual edgy little creep), the dirty low-down snake who plugged Wild Bill from behind, does so in this film version because the famous gun-fighter lawman broke the hat of Jack's mother (Diane Lane).  In ""fact"" Jack told the miner's jury in Deadwood that found him not guilty that his brother had been gunned down by Hickok who had promised to shoot McCall if he saw him.  It was only after McCall kept bragging about killing Hickok once too often that Federal lawmen arrested him; before he was hung McCall claimed he had been hired by others to do the deed.
The screenplay by Hill is based on the book ""Deadwood"" by Pete Dexter and the play ""Fathers and Sons"" by Thomas Babe.  In the film's climax McCall and a gang of thugs have gotten the drop on Wild Bill.  Inexplicably, the thugs wait for McCall to decide whether or not he has the guts to shot Hickock.  At one point Wild Bill offers to shoot himself, just to stop the stupid arguments.  Charlie Prince (John Hurt), Wild Bill's educated English friend (and the narrator of the film) says: ""Let him do it.  He's been trying to kill himself his entire life.""  This line sounds like it unlocks the entire meaning of the film, but that is only if you take it at face value.  ""Wild Bill"" shows a man playing by the rules of the game, and if he is incapable of loving any woman beyond the moment he is with her, even Calamity Jane (Ellen Barkin), it is not like the West is the land of romance.
The collision of Hickok and McCall is the backbone of the film, which reduces the other events in Wild Bill's life to two sets of flashbacks.  In color we get the gunfights on which the Hickok legend was born, such as shooting wheelchair bound Will Plummer (Bruce Dern) while tied to a saloon chair, as well as the failed attempt to perform on stage in New York City with Buffalo Bill Cody (Keith Carradine).  But there are also high contrast black & white sequences that are supposed to indicate significant moments in his life of a spiritual or personal nature.  These might make him aware of his mortality and his character flaws, but these do not translate into a death wish.
Wild Bill Hickok sat down in a chair with his back to the front door of the saloon because it was the only open spot in the poker game (the gambler in the seat he wanted refused to give it up).  That ironic element in the most famous death in the history of the Old West is jettisoned in this film, replaced instead with the rather paradoxical idea that his downfall was due to an uncharacteristic act of sentimentality on his part.  In the end, ""Wild Bill"" comes down to a series of dazzingly brutal gunfights through which Bridges snarls his way.  These are scenes that emphasize the choreography of the violence for effect rather than spraying a lot of blood all over the place.  In the end, all you have to do is count the number of bullets that come out of his six-shooters to remind yourself this film is Hollywood invention.  The final irony is that ""Wild Bill"" is undone by the very death scene that made Hickok immortal.",1050105600,10,3551,4.452160493827161
763973,2,6304039301,"Could be good as a stand-alone Western; excellent sets, costumes, etc., but has very little to do with Wild Bill Hickok. While Jeff Bridges makes a great Wild Bill, the story loses all credibility as soon as he steps off the stage in Deadwood and is met by Jack McCall, who announces his intentions to kill W.B., then rides off to gather a gang of hoodlems to help him accomplish the feat. Absolutely no semblence whatsoever to reality, especially in the final confrontation at the No. 10 saloon. Contains scenes that have become cliche in films, such as (my favorite) when Wild Bill shoots it out with McCall's gang, firing at least thirty shots from each of his cap-n-ball six shooters without reloading. If you are interested in the real Wild Bill, I suggest you read ""They Called Him Wild Bill - The Life and Times of Wild Bill Hickok"" by Joseph G. Rosa - available from Amazon. If you want a well made western, this isn't bad, just keep in mind that this is FANTASY. If you are interested in Wild Bill Hickok, give this one a MAJOR pass.",1030060800,8,1042,4.489473684210527

Jeff Bridges does an Academy Award representation of the man feared by most during the 1870's.( That is, I would have given him the award.)

The movies town set and other characters place you in the rough and tumble days at the end of the old West, when civilization was just beginning to open up the wild frontier.

Tough, gritty and sure of his immortality. And Ellen Barkin is a lovable Calamity Jane (more women should be like her!! hehe) Anyways, this film could have delved more into the Life of Wild Bill as compared to his death. There are great scenes in this movie, but it is hard to digest on the first viewing. The first 2/3s of the movie is kinda hacked up bits and pieces of Bill's life. I would have liked to see more of his earlier years that led up to the man who became a legend. But, it is very enjoyable and makes for great testosterone boost.

What I can say, however, is that I thoroughly enjoyed Bridges' portrayal of the rough and tumble Wild Bill. I lost the sense that I was  watching an actor at work behind the moustache, twin pistols and gruff  mannerisms that Bridges brings to the character. I found the central  conflict of a very tough and manly man coming to terms with his own legacy  poignant and interesting.

764173,1,6304039301,"Sometimes Walter Hill makes it very difficult to be a fan.  I've never been able to figure out whether Wild Bill qualifies as an ambitious failure or a self-indulgent disaster but either way it's a mess.  Most biographical films fall into the trap of dramatizing only the highlights of the subject's life--Walter Hill takes that to extremes by making no obvious attempt to turn the films episodes of Wild Bill's life into something resembling a story.

Walter Hill's early efforts as writer/director were beautiful, spare efforts as sharp as the edge of a razor with stories that could be described easily in a single sentence filled with characters that were simple and direct.  But something went very wrong after the commercial success of 48 Hours.  Initially Walter Hill lost his identity in pursuit of commercial hits (directing the god-awful Richard Pryor vehicle Bewster's Millions and the Ralph Macchio plays the blues film Crossroads, both of which felt like the work of any anonymous hack), then he seemed to lose his confidence, bringing garish overkill to movies like Johnny Handsome and Trespass that likely would have been classics if he had directed them earlier in his career.

I couldn't begin to tell you what the story of Wild Bill is because as far as I can tell there isn't one--it just seems like a collection of scenes.  The movie opens with Wild Bill's funeral so it seems a safe bet that this movie is ultimately leading to his death but that's about it in terms of narrative direction.  Wild Bill just seems to lurch from scene to scene with little obvious purpose.  It's possible that Walter Hill is trying to comment on the nature of legend--at various points characters tell oversized stories about about Wild Bill in his presence that Bill ends up correcting downward until finally a character recounts something that we've actually seen dramatized--but Bill claims that didn't happen as described either--suggesting possibly that neither Wild Bill nor the movie itself can be trusted.

Amazingly Wild Bill feels like even more of a mess than Supernova, the science fiction film that was famously taken out of Hill's hands by MGM when he went over budget and then edited without Hill's participation using only the footage that was already shot even though the movie was never finished.  Wild Bill might not represent the low point of Walter Hill's career but it's certainly one of them.",1431302400,,2417,4.94320987654321

764177,5,6304039301,"Wild Bill captures the life and times of Wild Bill Hickok the legendary lawman and gunfighter of the 19th century western frontier. Jeff bridges heads an excellent cast with the hand of director Walter Hill evident from the start. The oft violent episodes in the life of the irascible Will Bill on his voyage across the western frontier are well observed with human drama, dirt, danger, death and at times humour never far away.
The excellent John Hurt provides an overriding narrative as Bills friend companion and witness on their arrival in Deadwood Dakota 1876, for the final weeks of Bills life.  Wild Bill gets five stars for what it is rather than should be: an inevitable imperfect cinematic take on a life removed by distance, time and legend. The scenes are by turn: odd, quirky and memorable not least the opium dream scene with the Cheyenne dog soldiers. In addition traditional tunes of the era percolate the sound track and highlight the end credits.

764179,5,6304039301,"This is a n excellently enjoyable movie of the Old West. There is a lot of discussion by reviewers about the historical accuracy. Movies,books etc. about the famous characters that roamed the Old West from the end of the Civil War till the end of the century are filled with history,legend and outright fiction. The fact that so much licence is taken with the facts,is almosy immaterial when it comes to enjoying Westerns.
This portrayal of Wild Bill encorporates a lot of legend and fiction;but what really makes it a great Western is the excellent acting of many of the characters. Leading the pack of course is the wonderful way Jeff Bridges played Wild Bill ;as well as how well  Ellen Barkin played Calamity Jane. The movie starts off and ends with the funeral of Wild Bill in Deadwood. It is a stroke of genius how  B & W photography is used to portray things that took place in the past and color for the present. I really likedhow  Barkin  played Calamity Jane. To me, Jane is one of the most interesting females in the Old West,and many have tried to convey her nature. All you have to do is compare how she is acted out in other movies,and then there is the way she came out in the TV series ""Deadwood"" All different,and all ebntertaining.
 Another thing about this movie is that the storyline is excellent,particularly how it mixes past events with the present,without being confusing.
The movie is also filled with a lot of great lines,and whether they were actual said or not ,matters little,because they add greatly to the enjoyment .

764350,5,6304039301,"Wild Bill Hickok, as every grade-school child knows, was a lawman and a gunfighter in the American West.  But what few people of any age know is just how real, how intemperate, how flawed, and yet how loving a character Wild Bill really was.  All that and more come out in this extraordinarily staged, written, and produced film, WILD BILL, one of the best modern-day American western films ever made.  Jeff Bridges plays the role of Bill, while Ellen Barkin as a young Calamity Jane lends an air of believability to her own part.

They're all here--all the characters who crossed paths with Bill.  Calamity, Charley Prince, Buffalo Bill Cody, Will Plummer, California Joe, Dave Tutt, Phil Coe, Dave McCanles, and more.  All straight from the pages of history.  Of course some minor liberties may have been taken in translating history into film, but it's all in the name of art, and it all seems to be readily justifiable.

If Bill had a weakness, it wasn't women and it wasn't liquor and it wasn't, surprisingly enough, cards.  It was his own insistence that others treat him with the same respect and dignity that he offered them.  Some of the characters with whom he crossed paths never did come to embrace that realization, and their stay on earth ended far too ignominiously, if predictably.

Still, one of the deadliest characters to darken Bill's doorstep proved even more dangerous--and far more formidable--even than John Wesley Hardin, with whom Bill had a brief falling out.  It was the glaucoma with which his eyes were stricken.  The shooting pain he endured forced him to turn to liquor for solace--and then to less palatable, more debilitating substances, such as opium.  Throughout it all, Calamity stood by him, loving him in her own peculiar way perhaps more than even she realized at the time.

The story of Wild Bill is one that many people know; the story of the man behind the moniker is unique.  Bridges, Barker, Bruce Dern, and the other accomplished actors in this Walter Hill-directed tale of love and life are worth watching over and over again.

Ellen Barkin does a very good job in protrying Calamity Jane, when a person understands the real Calamity Jane. It was one of the good westerns, showing scenes from Hickok's life. The movie mixes the facts of Hickok's life with the legend of Wild Bill Hickok. There was one scene in particular that I like in the movie was when Hickok had Calamity on a bar table and you knew that they was having sex, by what she said when the ruffins busting in and took them hostages ""Do you mind turning your heads, I'm a bit damned exposed here.""",1318982400,,654,4.32520325203252

Even though there is not a lot of historical accuracy in this film, the acting by Jeff Bridges and his co-star Ellen Barken, who plays Calamity Jane is fantastic.  This film loosely follows the life of Wild Bill Hickok, who was known to be a hard drinking gunfighter who never backed down from a challenge.  There is no doubt Hickok was a very good shot because historical records indicate this fact.

This movie gives the impression that he and Calamity Jane had a hot and heavy romance in the past, but he only made it with her one time in film.  This movie did cover Wild Bill being killed after being shot in the back of the head while playing cards.  I recently saw a historical biography on Wild Bill Hickok, which covered in more detail the life of this famous gunfighter.

In conclusion, this is an excellent western action film that will be of interest to anyone who loves western movies.

Go to wikipedia and read a short bio of Wild Bill Hickok.  He was a friend of Buffalo Bill Cody, a scout for Gen. Custer, a noted lawman and gunman, and the original 'dime store' novel action hero.  Why didn't they make this movie.....I'm waiting.",1304467200,3,484,4.647058823529412
764435,4,6304039301,"Those of us who grew up in the 1950s in the early days of television, black and white television, got our heroes, our Western heroes strictly in white hat, and our bad guys strictly in black. And the Indians (a.k.a. Native Americans) well, the less said about the treatment of those benighted and betrayed people the better. Of course this view was all hokum, or worst. It took the likes of Larry McMurtry, Cormac McCormack and others in literature to give us a more realistic view of the rawness, untamed rawness of the Old West. And the likes of Walter Hill to give us a more truthful cinematic view,  a view with muddy streets, whiskey breathe, fistfights at the drop of a hat, or less, treachery among enemies, treachery among friends, many social diseases and all. And that was on the good days. The good director here has taken on the legend of Wild Bill Hickock, generally given the better of it in Western lore as an associate of Buffalo Bill, a civilizing influence, and a king hell gunfighter.

Of course, the subtext for this review is that the actor playing Will Bill is none other that last year's Academy Award winner Jeff Bridges for his ""modern"" cowboy role (singer-songwriter, okay) in Crazy Hearts. My argument underlying the choice of subtext is that Bridges was born to play theses good old boy Western parts and has done mainly stellar work in the genre ever since he cut his teeth on the modern Texas good-old-boy-in-the-making Duane Jackson in the film adaptation of McMurtry's The Last Picture Show. And at the acting level that is true here, although the existential characterization and the Bridges cool wit is perhaps a little over the top for the nitty-gritty West of the late 19th century.

One comes away from this film feeling, and maybe not incorrectly, that the distance between hero and villain (here in this contrived concoction about the manner of Bill's untimely end, as villain, the son, the driven son of ""spurned"" mother whom was once Wild Bill's lover) is who is left standing at the end. And for most of his life from his service in the Union Armies during the American Civil War until that fateful day that Bill was just one step too cool Will Bill was the last one left standing. But, see there was that little matter of the spurned woman, and that driven son to lay old Bill low. In any case if you have not seen a Western since the 1950s (although I guess I would want to know where you have been) you will be hard-pressed to sort out the heroes from the villains here. The Indians (a.k.a. Native Americans) as usual, in real life or fiction, get short shrift.",1300320000,,2606,4.6
764436,2,6304039301,"When a Western devolves into an outright howler it's brutal and grimacing to endure.  (I have loads of respect for a gripping, well-made Western.)  So I crawled all over my couch while watching WILD BILL, a contrived, cliche-ridden train wreck that literally had me blushing for the likes of many terrific actors, including Jeff Bridges (in the title role), Bruce Dern, James Gammon, and the forever-brooding Diane Lane.  None of them deserved a clunker like this; here's hoping a passle of agents were promptly given their pink slips in WILD BILL's aftermath.

We're all familiar with the legend of gunman Wild Bill Hickok and his exploits from Abilene to Deadwood.  But here Bridges portrays Hickok as a high-strung neurotic who goes into a tizzy when. . .someone touches his hat.  (And there are several howlers as a result.)  Meanwhile Ellen Barkin shatters every caricature of a drawling, slang-hurling, tough-as-nails Western tomboy (playing Hickok pal Calamity Jane), and no one, I repeat, no one, is more annoying and irritating than a sniveling David Arquette playing sissified villain Jack McCall.

And then I kept asking myself:  Why is Christina Applegate even in this movie?

We're privy to several (actually, too many) grainy, black and white flashbacks that lend little to the Deadwood sequence, and the hostage non-event in the saloon is so lame I was absolutely cringing in my chair as I watched (mortified).  But fear not:  Wild Bill ultimately mows down the bad guys using two six-shooters that, miraculously, never run out of rounds, and Calamity gets to beat up a couple of misfits to boot, making WILD BILL the ultimate howler that it is.  But comedy shouldn't be this painful.

764457,4,6304039301,"It's always good to see a western about Wild Bill. Nearly half of the westerns made concern either Wyatt Earp,  Jesse James or Billy the Kid. Wild Bill was equally as famous in his time, but films on him have been few and far in between - ""Wild Bill Hickock"" (1923) with William S. Hart and ""The Great Adventures of Wild Bill Hickock"" (1938 serial) with Wild Bill Elliott are the only two films to focus on Bill, although he has made cameo appearances in a dozen more films (e.g., ""The White Buffalo"", ""Little Big Man"", ""Calamity Jane""), and he did have his own TV series from 1951-8 with Guy Madison.

Fellow lawman Wyatt Earp, in contrast, has had more than a dozen films about his life and he has been played by such notables as Randolph Scott, Henry Fonda, Joel McCrea, Burt Lancaster, James Stewart, James Garner, Kurt Russell, and Kevin Kostner

""Wild Bill"" is a 1995 western starring Jeff Bridges in the title role. Written and directed by Walter Hill of ""Deadwood"" and ""Long Riders"" fame, the film has a great supporting cast that includes John Hurt, James Gammon, Ellen Barkin, David Arquette, and Diane Lane, with brief appearances from James Remar, Keith Carradine, Bruce Dern, Christina Applegate, and Marjoe Gortner.

Jeff Bridges may be best known for re-playing the role of Rooster Cogburn from 2010's version of ""True Grit"" and for his Oscar winning role in ""Crazy Heart"" (2009). In fact, Bridges was nominated 4 other times for ""The Contender"" (2000), ""Starman"" (1984), ""Thunderbolt and Lightfoot"" (1975), and ""The Last Picture Show"" (1971).

Ellen Barkin plays Calamity Jane. No one exudes sex like Barkin, and her work in films like ""The Big Easy"" (1987) and ""Sea of Love"" (1989) is exceptional. She briefly retired from films when she married billionaire Ron Perlman, but after their divorce, she returned. She was twice nominated for a Golden Globe (""Switch"" in 1991 and ""Before Women Had Wings"" in 1997) and won an Emmy for ""Before Women Had Wings"".

The beautiful Diane Lane plays the mother of the man (David Arquette) who wants to kill Bill for having deserted his mother. Among her 50+ films and TV roles she was nominated for an Oscar for ""Unfaithful"" (2002) and Emmy nominated for her work in ""Lonesome Dove"" (1989). I liked her best in films like ""Rumble Fish"" (1983) and especially ""Streets of Fire"" (1984).

Beautiful and extremely funny Christina Applegate plays a $5 prostitute who helps Arquette. We know Applegate best as Kelly Bundy from the hilarious ""Married with Children"" (1987-97), but after graduating from that  series she's gone on to earn 4 Emmy nominations and 1 win (""Friends""), 3 Golden Globe nominations (""Samantha Who?""), and won the People's Choice award twice (1999-2009).

James Gammon (1940-2010) as Bill's friend, California Joe, is the scene stealer. Gammon's rough face and deep, gravelly voice are known from more than 100 films and TV roles, the most prominent of which was Nash Bridges' father in the ""Nash Bridges"" (1996-2001) series and the manager in ""Major League"" (1989) and the sequel.

Keith Carradine, Bruce Dern, James Remar, and Marjoe Gortner all do excellent jobs in their very brief appearances. One wonders what such name talent is doing in such minor roles, especially since only Carradine (McCabe & Mrs. Miller"", ""Long Riders"", ""Annie Oakley"", ""Last Stand at Sabre River"") and Dern (""The War Wagon"", ""Will Penny"", ""Hang `em High"", ""The Cowboys"") have much of a track record in westerns.

Walter Hill won the DGA for his work on the TV series ""Deadwood"" (2004) and the TV mini series ""Broken Trail"" (2006), but his more famous distinctions are directing films like ""48 Hrs."" (1982) and producing the ""Alien"" films (1979, 1986, 1992). Despite working in many genres, his most popular work is in westerns and his favorite directors were directors of western films (e.g., Ford, Hawks, Peckinpah, Leone).

The film received no nominations for major awards. Roger Ebert thought that Bridges ""is not in the right role"" and the ""movie tries for poetry and elegy [but]doesn't get there."" In contrast, The San Francisco Chronicle said ""these shootouts are explosive and artfully staged"" and called it ""an audacious wallow in violence and Western legend"". The Washington Post claims ""Hill evokes the great westerns of the past"".

If critical comment was mixed, viewers were not. The film grossed a mere $2 million in a year in which the top grossing films made in excess of $200 million or more. With a production budget of $30 million, the film was a commercial failure. 1995 was not a particularly good year for westerns. No western was nominated for any major award, and the major films that year were ""Apollo 13"", ""Babe"", ""Braveheart"", ""Casino"", ""Dead Man Walking"", ""Heat"", ""Nixon"", ""Seven"", ""Toy Story"" and ""The Usual Suspects"". Prior to this, ""Unforgiven"" won an Oscar in 1992 and ""Tombstone"" (1993) and ""Wyatt Earp"" (1994) had been hits.

The film is action packed with several flashbacks to savage gun fights involving Wild Bill, interspersed with the slow and steady slowdown between Bill and his stalker. It's certainly one of the better westerns, though not in the same class as ""The Searchers"", ""The Wild Bunch"", ""Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid"",  etc.",1295049600,3,5228,4.958857142857143

Wild Bill's character has no depth. Jane seems to clean and pretty to be the hard drinking person she was. David Arquette's performance as Jack McCall is out of the blue and terrible.

I do appreciate a little poetic license in the way a director, writer, or actor presents but not so much the realism is lost.  Wild Bill is actually a pretty good movie.  The first half is very well done but the movie lapses into a fictionalized, possibly, theoretically, maybe is could have been run that forced loss of one star.  Jeff Bridges does an excellant job portraying Wild Bill Hickock.  Ellen Barkin is adequate as Calamity Jane, but a little too 'sweet' to really carry the part off to be beleivable.  The movie unfortunately used black and white for flashbacks throughout the movie.  I'm really no fan of flashbacks when they're over used as is this case.  I guess the director wanted to make sure we the audience would 'get it?  it's a flashback'.  Loss of one more star.  For me, some good western movies are: Tombstone, Deadwood(series) as well as Wyatt Earp(Kevin Kostner), several Louis L'amour written stories that are now available on DVD.  I also enjoy watching westerns that are just fun to watch without trying to be a history lesson like The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly or Hang Em High, Tom Horn, Nevada Smith (Steve McQueen) to name a few.  If you approach Wild Bill just to enjoy a good movie and you don't know or care about the real history of Wild Bill Hickock, you'll certainly not be wasting your time watching.",1286496000,2,1471,4.673151750972763

The film begins with the unloading of a coffin in Deadwood. His mourners talk of the dearly departed. Wild Bill Hickok practiced shooting while aiming in a mirror! [Bad for your hearing?] There is a flashback to an Indian religious ceremony. [Hollywood history?] A shooting shows Wild Bill's skills. He is handy with his fists, and, not unequal to many. Next Abilene Kansas where a visitor celebrates by shooting inside the city limits, a violation of the law. Bill shoots the wrong man in a gun fight. He tries show business in New York. His glaucoma is diagnosed with a warning of blindness. Bill defends himself from a cripple. Then he moved to Deadwood where gold was discovered so men could get rich quick.

A young man challenges Wild Bill. [No reason given.] ""Calamity"" Jane is there. Life is rough, even in a resort. We hear about Hickok's early life and his first gunfight. Six or seven? Opium smoking to soothe his nerves? [We see another flashback where the Cheyenne warn Hickok and his friends against hunting buffalo.] Who is Jack McCall? Is his story true? Another flashback to a dance years earlier to explain his past. Winning a watch can have deadly consequences. Was Jack McCall a paid assassin? A new gold strike draws most of the people out of town. A gang attacks Wild Bill when he is involved with ""Calamity"" Jane. [The film become talky here, we all know how it will end.] There is a flashback to an insane asylum. [The ""mush and molasses"" can cause pellagra, which affects the mind and the body.] Then more talk to fill up the time, instead of the usual chase scene. Then Wild Bill goes after the gang to settle their differences. But he made a last mistake by trusting an enemy [in this film].

Wild Bill Hickok was involved in the Kansas fighting before the Civil War on the anti-slavery side. He was a soldier for the Union, then began a career that made him famous (due to the dime novels that appealed to the public). Hollywood revises history to provide drama, and this entertainment teaches history to the public. [""Don't know much about history?""] This drama is presented as a series of scenes, it would be better in chronological order. If this film wasn't successful that is one reason. Decades earlier Hollywood's Production Code censored many of the facts about the personalities of the ""Wild West"". This film serves as a correction.

The west was settled by homesteaders with families, not the sort who hang out at taverns, drinking and gambling and fighting. You should read ""What They Didn't Teach You About the Wild West"" or ""...the Civil War"" by Mike Wright for more information.",1269216000,,2642,4.712121212121212
764461,4,6304039301,"Although the Prize as Best Actor will be announced the next March 7, I have no single doubt that at last, Jeff Bridges will win the deserved Prize, (repeating the feat respect the Golden Globe as Best Actor)through a constant and indomitable effort, along his formidable career.

The second was ""The fisher king"" directed by the Magician director, Terry Gilliam and the third entry was precisely this one, a film that realy was shadowed by ""Tombstone"", the best Western of the nineties.

His performance was by far overwhelming and absorbing in this biopic about bill Hicock. Watch it, without regarding considerations of second order about if this biography was or not adjusted to the historical truth.

764462,4,6304039301,"I first viewed ""Wild Bill"" because it sounded like a great western, and at the time I was watching DVDs non-stop to help distract my attention from the extreme pain I was experiencing prior to surgery.  I must have been more medicated than I remember, as I just watched the movie again, after purchasing it based on the fact that I ""remembered"" it as being a really terrific and enjoyable western, and I was appalled at the production errors and ""historical bunk"" in the film.  Yet, while I did not enjoy it as much as I ""remember"" enjoying ""Wild Bill,"" I still think that the film is terrific thanks to some truly memorable performances and crisp direction.

When I compare it to other films out there, and keep a ""healthy thought"" that ""Wild Bill"" is a movie about the ""Legend"" and not the ""real, historical person,"" I find myself wanting to give the film five stars.  Beyond a doubt, the film is one of Jeff Bridges finest performances; and the drama and action are awesome.

Then I remember counting the number of times Wild Bill fired his two pistols (which were pron to misfires) in the shoot out in the livery and I cringe.  I cannot be certain, since the film does not actually always show Wild Bill's shots (you frequently just hear them, and see their effects), but I got a count of 29 rounds--more than double what he could have realistically fired.  Nonetheless, the scene is pure excitement and deepens the ""Legend"" of Wild Bill.  Conversely, I think the director did a marvelous job of editing in the great use of black and white ""dreams"" that help ""recall"" Wild Bill's ""legendary life.""

On the other hand, Charlie Utter, Hickok's friend and life-long companion is denigrated--or so I see it--into John Hurt's completely fictional character Charley Prince, an English gentleman who self proclaims himself, through Prince's narration of ""Wild Bill,"" to be a fellow ""drunk and gambler,"" who has become a ""friend"" (and traveling companion) to Wild Bill.  While the funeral scene is better than many, it still failed to capture the true impact of Wild Bill's death on the community of Deadwood; and Charlie Utter's efforts to give the funeral dignity.  Despite the fact that Wild Bill had been in Deadwood only a few days, according to historical accounts nearly every person in the camp--as well as many from elsewhere--attended the funeral; for even on August 3, 1876, it seems that ""everyone"" knew that a ""true legend had come to an end.""

764588,3,6304039301,"I have to agree with many of the other reviewers who feel that the movie is ""spotty"" - but Bridges is great..!

I've read quite abit about Hickok and the movie seems relatively accurate with respect to many of the historical incidents that pre-dated Hickok's arrival in Deadwood. In fact, it's the flashbacks that I enjoyed the most - the gunfight in the main square / street - with Dave Tutt / the accidental killing of his own deputy in Abilene / the ""fight"" with the soldiers in the saloon/ the gunfight with the McCandles crew and a few others.

I honestly don't know if Hickok really felt murderous when somebody mistreated his hat, but it was a nice touch.

And Jeff Bridges was great in the role. He talked the part and certainly looked the part (kudos to the wardrobe person who ""dressed"" Hickok - he/ she certainly did his homework - the clothes and hat were perfect..!). And the pearl handled 1851 Navy Colt revolvers tucked into a red sash around the waist was exactly Hickok's setup.

I think the movie captured the absolute fearlessness of Hickok. From everything I've read, the man had ice water running through his veins. His incredible prowess and marksmanship with his pistols - coupled with his complete indifference to the bullets whizzing by him during the gunfights contributed significantly to his legend. He was one of those guys who was truly a legend in his own time.

The movie dragged for me in the middle. The amount of time devoted to jack McCall - the twirp who shot and killed him - just seemed to drag on forever. Jack's inability to decide whether or not to shoot Hickok throughout the movie just seemed to be be stretched out to the point where I felt like grabbing a gun - entering the tv - and putting a windown in Jack McCall's skull.

Three stars might be a bit on the low side but 4 is probably too much - 3 1/2 is what this film is worth.

Jeff Bridges plays the main role of James Butler Hickock (a.k.a. Wild Bill) and HE is what makes this movie entertaining. Bridges uses all his tools to show the hindrances of a lost, but determined man. His body language is brilliant, as is his line delivery, but that can't save a flimsy plot which is also horrible inaccurate.

Ellen Barkin does a great job playing Calamity Jane and the rest of the support cast also show their mettle; excluding a horrible performance by David Arquette; who can't work with a skilled actor like Bridges.

All in all, 'Wild Bill' is a different western, but relies too heavily on the lead role with a story that seemed to be written backstage at a 'Doors' concert.",1162252800,2,930,4.693251533742331

I just found it great fun, an entertaining film that's always a kick to view, and what more you can ask? Being someone who is very much into visuals, great cinematography and unique approaches to camera-work, this film provided all of that and more, such as an interesting story with whacked-out characters.

I love narration and John Hurt's description of the goings-on here was just great to hear. He played ""Charlie,"" an Englishman with a gentleman's vocabulary that was in stark contrast to the hardened outlaws, led by 'Wild Bill' Hickok himself, played by Jeff Bridges. Ellen Barkin plays ""Calamity Jane,"" and few women of the 1980s and '90s played foul-mouthed, hard-but-sexy women as convincingly as Barkin.

In addition to Hurt, Bridges and Barkin, other fun characters included ""California Joe,"" Hickok's gravel-voiced friend who doesn't say much but when he does, you hear some some of the longest sentences ever uttered. Daid Arquette plays a very strange villain, the man who became famous for shooting Wild Bill. He acts strange and talks as if he has a mouthful of marbles. James Remar, another mean-looking tough guy, is a hired killer. Christina Applegate, Bruce Dern, Margoe Gortner, Keith Carradine and assorted other characters all add to this strange tale, strange in its telling and even stranger in its visual style.

Some of the film is in flashback, which is seen in startling black-and-white and mainly features Diane Lane, who is flat-out gorgeous and maybe the most intriguing person in the film. One of the flashbacks has the film deliberately overexposed with wild dream-like images.

It's fun at first, but ultimately his character is hard to care for. That's important, because from the get-go, you know what's coming for Wild Bill at the end. For that reason, the filmmakers' biggest challenge was to make you care for ol' Bill. But Bridges and the scriptwriters fall wide of the mark. (In contrast, Keith Carradine sets the world-weary gunfighter bar high with his portrayal of W.B. in ""Deadwood."") Sure, Bridges's Wild Bill is humorous and quirky, but his character does so many outrageous, over-the-top things -- punching, insulting, and generally running roughshod over folks -- that you can't help but think ""Oh, he's askin' for it"" or ""No real gunfighter would do that!"" The real Hickock was shot in the back of the head by Jack McCall, an no-account drifter who had lost to Hickok in cards. The Jack McCall of this film, however, is out to avenge his mother, a former lover of Hickok's who, her son thinks, was cruelly abandoned by the gunslinger turned professional gambler. But it gets even better: McCall -- SPOILERS AHEAD -- pays a motley crew of lowlifes a sum of one thousand dollars (today worth about, what, a million?) to kill Hickok. They catch him by surprise while he's -- get this -- coupling with Calamity Jane on top of a poker table. (For me, that's when the movie jumped the shark.) But then the bad guys, instead of killing Hickok right there on the spot (which is usually what hired killers do) force him and other residences of his hotel to play poker. Why they did this I never did find out, because that's when the screening of ""Wild Bill"" was cut short by the eject button. --MellowMonk.com",1133308800,9,2037,4.692737430167598

764594,5,6304039301,"It goes without saying that the life of Wild Bill Hickok, along with several other frontiersmen, has become legendary to the point where it becomes caricature.  Therefore, it is useful and informative to read some of the early accounts of these men's exploits - told before their stories were embellished unduly.  When examining the lives of Hickok, Cody, and Custer the truth is more than enough.  These men really were larger than life.

This film follows what seems to be a fairly typical pattern of telling considerable factual material, and then ""completing"" the story with invention.  That is not my preference, because as mentioned above, the truth is more than enough.  However, I'm glad just to have these movies made, and the Westerns of recent years are vastly superior to the ""Classics"" when it comes to authenticity.

Getting some feel for the real Hickok, and then seeing Jeff Bridges in the role with the artistry of modern Hollywood to create the character, left me agape.  Surely, this is Hickok come to life!  The people creating the time-piece sets and historic characters of these recent movies are good!  Do yourself a favor and don't take this artistry for granted.

There is one scene in this movie I would like to single out for its exceptional artistry.  That is the dream-like reminiscence of Hickok, along with California Joe, meeting a party of ""Dog Soldiers,"" i.e. Cheyenne warriors.  (The word Cheyenne comes from the French chien, meaning dog).  The way in which these warriors and this meeting are portrayed creates a scene of haunting, mystical power.

The tales of the American frontier are stuff of great fascination.  So much so that it was realized even back then, in ""real"" time.  It is so wonderful to see these stories told with considerable authenticity that I can't begrudge the makers a bit of license with some facts, even though it just isn't necessary.

Just keep making these films.  I'm far from tired of them.",1124668800,13,1958,4.896656534954407
764595,3,6304039301,"It is uneven films like 'Wild Bill' that make me wish that Amazon allowed half stars. While it has some outstanding scenes that I would not have missed, and Jeff Bridges deliveres a five star performance in the title role, it hits too many false notes, and as a whole is far too unconvincing to merit four stars. But when it is good, it is very good, and deserves a three and one half star rating.
Jeff Bridges' portrayal of Wild Bill Hickok is simply outstanding. He delivers exactly the right mix of flamboyant swagger, no nonsense toughness, and world weariness to breath life into the legend, and is the primary reason to see this movie. The film's early scenes, where Bridges gets to recreate several pivital episodes of Hickok's legend are superb; had the movie continued in that vein, it would be a classic.
Unfortunately, 'Wild Bill' abandons both the history and legend of James Butler Hickok for the greater part of the movie in favor of its own inovations on the tale that simply fall flat. Most of the story is told in Deadwood, the boom town where Hickok was killed, and it attempts to give explanation and motivation to young Jack McCall's murder of Wild Bill. This is not only unnecessary, as the tale already had a fitting ending  (an unbalanced young coward murders a legend hoping to make a name), but destoys the credibility of the film, by adding silly scenes such as McCall and a gang of hired toughs holding Bill and friends hostage in a bar previous to the murder.
The impressive cast, like the movie itself, delivers unevenly. David Arquette does a fair job as the twitchy Jack McCall. Ellen Barkin fails as Calamity Jane - her attempt at acting both rowdy tough and sweetly sexy is about as successful as mixing oil and water. John Hurt plays Charley Prince, an English gentleman who is friend to Wild Bill, and narrates much of the movie; both the charater and the narration seem out of place in the tale. Vetern character actor James Gammon plays California Joe largly through speaking loudly, and is a disappointment. Christina Applegate's role as hard bitten prostitute Lurline is both woodenly acted and utterly superflous to the story. Keith Carradine has a one scene, throw away cameo as Buffalo Bill Cody. Bruce Dern, playing Will Plummer, an angry old man in a wheel chair who calls Wild Bill out, delivers the most entertaining performance in the movie next to Bridges, providing one of the moments that make this film worth seeing despite its many flaws.
Had 'Wild Bill' stuck to the legend rather than inovating, or had it attempted to get behind the legend to the history, this could have been an outstanding movie. The scenes that did stay close to the legend were outstandingly well done, and give a hint of what this film could have been. As is, I would still recommend that you check out 'Wild Bill', but rent, rather than buy.

764596,5,6304039301,"Jeff Bridges is magnificent as the eponymous ""Wild Bill"", he takes the overblown legend of Bill and breathes life into the man as myth and as character, the dream like direction of Hill fits the subject spot on. If you have studied the ""facts"" of Bills' life, some things may jar (such as the ""romance"" with Calamity Jane, they hardly knew each other in reality, only meeting shortly before Bills' assassination). The film re-creates the Myth of The Wild West to perfection, dust and mud, gun play and dying, hard living and easy death seem to be the order of the day....Jeff Bridges is one of those ""still"" actors who are perfect for these sort of parts, getting deep under the skin of his characters. I enjoyed this film. It stayed with me for a long time, prompting me to buy a ""biography"" of Wild Bill to learn more. The mark of a good movie in my mind is that it lingers in your thoughts. The only niggle I had is that Ellen Barkin as Calamity Jane was just a bit too scrubbed up, she looked a bit too fragrant! Jeff Bridges though owned this character from beginning to end, a bravura performance, he never once makes a false step. Walter Hill's direction and the script do not glamorise the gun play, it is shown for what it was, sordid and cruel, an insight into the Amerika of today and why it has developed into what it is.",1102032000,10,1333,4.379032258064516
764597,3,6304039301,"I wasn't too impressed with 1995's ""Wild Bill"" the first time I saw it. I was expecting better from the great Walter Hill. The storytelling is a bit awkward and non-detailed, resulting in a less-than-captivating experience. Not to mention the movie comes to a screeching halt in the third act when Bill is held up in a saloon in Deadwood as his would-be killers consider knocking him off. This final act left a bad taste the first time I saw the film.

I recently gave the flick another chance and am glad I dead -- I mean did (sorry, it must be the effect of the movie). The first half hour involves a series of insult-in-the-saloon-leads-to-a-gunfight type episodes; as mentioned above, not enough detail is included in these brief scenes to make them truly compelling, but they're enjoyable nevertheless. The second act settles down a bit, but is essentially more of the same.

Jeff Bridges is fine as Bill but, as written, the character comes off rather dismal and even pathetic in light of his growing addictions. Ellen Barkin is well cast as Calamity Jane; Diane Lane is beautiful as Bill's one-and-only (past) love and David Arquette is realistic but contemptible as Lane's vengeful son, Jack McCall (and maybe son of Bill; in the movie, that is, not real life). Christina Applegate is stunning in a small role as the messed-up kid's girlfriend while Keith Carradine and Bruce Dern have glorified cameos.

""Wild Bill"" offers an unattractive and dreary Wild West because it focuses on the last sad days of a legend. This isn't necessarily bad in-and-of-itself, but the all-over-the-place storytelling prevents it from attaining greatness. I also suppose Walter Hill was limited by the true-life events of Hickok's final days, even while deviating from the facts as far as Jack McCall is concerned. While McCall is an actual historical figure, the subplot of Wild Bill romancing his mother in the past was made up. McCall insisted that he shot Hickok because he killed his brother in Kansas, which might be true; another theory is that McCall was hired to shoot Hickok by gamblers who feared he would be made a law officer in the Deadwood region since he used to be a deputy, Sheriff & Marshal back in Kansas. Another deviation from history is that Jane wasn't anywhere near Bill when he was shot; she was held by military authorities at the time.

Despite these criticisms, ""Wild Bill"" is worthwhile for Western fans.

The film runs 98 minutes and was shot in Santa Clarita, Semi Valley, Newhall, Burbank, Universal City and Angeles National Forest, California.
