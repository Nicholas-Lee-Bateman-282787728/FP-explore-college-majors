8207497,5,B000T28PLK,Amazing documentary which is part of the declassified series.,1490227200,,61,5.888888888888889
8207498,3,B000T28PLK,Kinda disappointing.  I found nothing new in it to excite me.,1437955200,,61,4.545454545454546
8207499,4,B000T28PLK,"The title of this video is a bit deceiving because to most historians or even students of history, there are not many ""secrets"" that are revealed.

Rather than reveal a bunch of ""secrets"" this video goes through the War from a mostly American and British perspective and allows the viewers to make connections and identify themes that existed on both sides of the war. Additionally, the video does an adequate job of removing the bias against Germany that most WWI films have.

This video was used in a 9th grade history class and the students enjoyed it thoroughly. I would recommend it to other teachers as a good way to connect  textbook content to primary sources (video footage) and broaden students perspectives on the war.",1404518400,,729,4.816

While, as correctly pointed out, no real 'secret' is disclosed, this video -again, not a masterpiece of scholarship but neither meant to be one- draws attention on to a series of facts that point out how there was no country really fighting for ""ideals"", but all logrolling to get a bigger piece of the cake.
In the wake of the ever present Germanophobia (""it's all bad Huns' fault"" ), and with German historians busy rolling over screaming they are sorry, this video tells the story of patriotic leagues the U.S government orchestrated. Leagues that -so I believe says the video- fielded at one time ONE MILLION spies in charge of eavesdropping and reporting dissidents to the justice system; I bet not many have heard about THAT. So much about the Germans supposedly inventing such practices on a mass scale.
The video also mentions rigged UK ships posing as merchant ships, but opening fire with cannons on German submarines; all the layman typically hears about is about those nasty Germans going on a murderous rampage about poor merchant ships out of pure ill will.
The UK dispatch authorizing to dispose of German submarine crews is not just a detail, either, since what people mostly hear about are German ""horrors"", bayoneted babies, raped Belgium and crucified Canadians...

To sum up, while no startling revelation is made, it deserves 4 stars for the courage of exposing facts that everybody supposedly knows, but the layman never heard about.
A real antidote to war urges is not to demonize Germany, which is all the more obtuse because Austria-Hungary started the war, but to show all countries did the same kind of things.
And wasn't Austria-Hungary trying to 'clean' that nest of ""terrorists eager to drop a bomb or two"" that was at the time Serbia...sounds familiar to today's average western drone?",1266537600,,1884,4.943217665615142
