Pse note the title of this proffering: The American Soldier: The Complete History of U.S. Wars. Below u will see ""American Soldier"" and Complete Wars..."" r in juxtaposition as if to rename or not use the SAME title; in the US u cant copyrite a title.

I ordered this ONE DVD ""series"" - entitled ""The Complete History of United States' Wars - from an outfit named ""PulseTV"" - they take a BITE out of retail. After EACH ""episode"" there appeared an ad to buy the SAME TITLE, SEEN ON PBS, ONLY its 4 discs AND costs 80 bucks!!!! PBS doesnt list it in the, forgive me, Complete List of ALL their shows. This ""Complete History of U.S. Wars, The American Soldier"", features George Kennedy, who does NOT narrate, but kinda intros each episode. The word ""complete"" is more than a mere lie; u cant jump from the Battle of Midway to the Enola Gay, dropping, Fat Man - Little Boy??? - and call it ""complete"" by ANY definition of English usage, grammar or common meaning.

I got REALLY chary when the PulseTV disc came in a BEAUTIFUL metal case with BEAUTIFUL artwork. Inside the metal container was a ""run-of-the-mill plastic case which cd hold TEN discs. I have ordered other sets from PTV with identical cases, with TEN discs. Why so elaborate packaging for 1, lousy disc?? But the star of this DVD is that on the SINGLE, SOLITARY, all alone, DVD's ""mast head"" - made to lok like a newspaper - r the words DISK 1! WHY wd u have ur graphic artist label a ONE disk disk, DISK 1???????

AHA! But Amazon also advertises ""The Complete DVD History of U.S. Wars, 1700-2004, The American Soldier, agn with Kennedy. In this avatar it's ALSO 4 discs. Price is 48-56 smackers.

So, dependent upon ur threshold for price - the single DVD, on sale at Amazon, goes for 75 cents - u have THREE choices, viz., A 1 disc non-set from PulseTV.com, with George [I used to fly with him in CA out of the same airport] which MUST b a mere xcerpt/xcision from ONE of the 4-disk sets; Or an ""as SEEN on PBS"" 4-disk pack no longer available from PBS; OR a 4-disc set entitled ""The Complete DVD History of U.S. Wars, 1700-2004 with our old friend Joe Petrillo, from Airport movies, doing intros.

I thot finding The Avengers, with narrated opening - Xtraordinary crimes against the people... - was tuff to find, but this plethora of ""The American Soldier...."" and ""The Complete History...The American Soldier"" and ""The Complete DVD History..."" is NUTS!! Marketing is the business of America, to our damage and disdain, but THREE incarnations of the IDENTICAL product, 1 short, 2 long and ALL for WIDELY divergent pricing smells, to me, like nitemare and ""a fool and his $$$$""...if not a simple, confusing rip-off!

8375464,4,B002NV7D2W,"Armed conflict has been a part of the American experience since the very beginning. From conflicts with the Spanish in Florida, to the recent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the armed forces have been there in the name of freedom and democracy. ""The American Solider: The Complete History of United States' Wars, 1700-2004,"" gives a broad overview of three centuries of American history. While those looking for detailed looks at particular conflicts will be disappointed, the program does serve as a good primer on America at war, offering a concise look at each war our country has been involved in since the beginning. Students of American history and military conflict will find this a worthwhile addition to their collection.
