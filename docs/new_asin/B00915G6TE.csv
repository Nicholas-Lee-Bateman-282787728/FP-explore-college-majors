5231827,4,B00915G6TE,"Csi can still deliver with believable , gritty crime stories. I bought this episode and watched it in hd. The story concerns two young girls who escape from a monster rapist. Who is this monster? And will he get away with it? The two newer cast members Elizabeth Shue and teD Danson are so good that they have insured that the show will remain a hit. The feel of this show is much more grounded in reality than the csi miami which too often had the csi's dressed up in fancy clothes at crime scenes! This show is about crime and not fashion.  This is one of the better episodes of the new csi that I have seen. It's Much more ground in reality than some.",1351296000,,654,4.190476190476191
5231828,5,B00915G6TE,"CSI has kept 13 seasons, up they must be doing somthing right; one of which is that people come and go in the job market ;any job market... seeing the same stale faces like on criminal minds or other shows only proves that the show is a show and has no basis in the world",1350777600,,271,3.9454545454545453

5231836,4,B00915G6TE,I have to say I was a little disappointed in this season. The new cast did a great job but to me the story lines wern't up to previous seasons and the writing for some of the long serving cast seemed out of character. Overall still a good season but be warned the last episode is the first of a 2 part story like season 12 so you might want to make sure you have season 14 before you watch it. I hate it when they do that.,1507593600,,422,3.8068181818181817

5231889,3,B00915G6TE,"First, the DVD played OK, arrived safe, I did not check any extras.  No further reading required in regards to DVD itself.  The series is less than I had hoped for.  The main reason for 3 stars is the character played by Elisabeth Shue; for me she ruined the show.  Her character is everywhere and the other cast felt like they were dumb down to shine spot on her.  The character constantly smirks/smiles regardless of scene and simply takes away from the episode and show.  I keep wanting them to get rid of her but I know that does not happen.  I was planning on finishing series but for the high price of final seasons and bad acting I will pass on others until price drop.",1455148800,,676,4.317460317460317
5231890,3,B00915G6TE,"Unfortunately, my copy of the 13th season was missing disc 2 (a second copy of disc 6 was in its place.)  I had ordered these in October of last year, but didn't get around to watching them until recently, meaning they're no longer eligible for return or replacement from Amazon.

Series is good and has definitely picked up with the addition of Danson and Shue, I just wish I was able to watch this complete season. :(",1454630400,,419,4.428571428571429

5231895,1,B00915G6TE,"Show continually has gone downhill since Grissom left.  This season was particularly bad.  I always liked Ted Danson, but on this show, can't stand him.  They should have brought in a 'nobody' for that role, afterall, Grissom was basically that.  Since him they have continually tried to plug in big name actors.  I don't know for sure, but they had to have also changed writers when Grissom left - the writing and even the 'roll your eyes' joke made before the opening that Grissom always did is non-existent.  Elisabeth Shue is another major disaster - she can't act and her character is just weird.  And as far as Sara getting divorced - since Grissom is off the show, it's imaginary anyway, even on the show - which brings me back to the writers must have changed. I have watched the show since season 1 - I'm done with it.",1452729600,,827,4.510067114093959

There have been ups and downs with this show, mostly due to cast changes and the incredibly different personalities of each new cast member.  I am thinking with the day and time change to Sunday that this series is on it's way out.  Although I liked Brass in the later seasons, I hated the stories about his daughter.

5232132,5,B00915G6TE,"Of all the crime series I watch, the CSI series only seems to get better with age.  This is an excellent season from end to end, with
a especially  superior finale.  Don't miss the opening episode of season 14.  I am constantly amazed that with the changing of the guard (the cast) of late, the excellent story telling continues.  Only the fact that everyone except Russell seems to be divorced(!) on
the show.  Even Sarah's marriage is falling apart.  Yeah, this is Las Vegas, the divorce capital of the world, but still it seems odd.
And I am still surprised how well Ted Danson fits in with the gang.  And Hodges appears to have some problems developing between
him and his Italian sweetheart who I think is just using him to stay in the USA.  Hodges works with a much more beautiful blond girl
who he belongs with and (hopefully) will get together with her eventually.  She is the only blond I like; I prefer brunettes.  Even Russell may be having trouble with his wife because she does not like the work he does.  It could be worse; she could be married
to Dr Sweets!!  I would like to see a bit more humor injected into some of the stories like the producers do in BONES and CASTLE.
Still, I gave this season 5 stars and have season 14 on my Video Library at Amazon.  Of  course I ordered the  DVD for this and
other shows from Amazon.  Enjoy!",1409270400,,1349,4.353413654618474

Such a shame that Nick & Sara are hardly seen. More of them & less of Hodges please. Greg's character has matured great & I think Grissom would be proud of him.

5232191,2,B00915G6TE,"I have been watching CSI for seven years. I will still consider it one of my favorite shows of all time. Some fans thought the show was going to go downhill in season 9 when William Peterson left, and surprisingly, it didn't. Laurence Fishburne made a surprisingly good lead, and some of my favorite episodes actually come from season 11 (which also had that awesome cameo from Peterson). So, what happened?

Season 12 saw the departure of Fishburne, and Ted Danson came in as the new lead. I thought Danson was a good new addition to the cast, and I will say that season 12 was good, just not as good as season 11. My hope was that season 12 would be just like season 10; a good season, but the show was still trying to find it's footing. Season 10 was good, but it was still awkward without Peterson, and the writing wasn't all that top notch. Season 11, however, really stepped up it's game and did a terrific job utilizing Fishburne as it's lead. I hoped that season 13 would also step up it's game and take more advantage of it's new cast members.

Unfortunately, None of the new or old characters are developed. If you didn't care for characters like Finn or Brody, this season doesn't help. They get more screen time, but they aren't developed and you still don't get much backstory from them (they're acting hasn't improved that much either). They come off as more annoying as ever. But, what really killed this season for me, was the episode ""Forget me not"", which seriously jumped the shark. If you don't want to be spoiled, then stop reading this review.

*SPOILERS!*

Sara and Grisom are now divorced. Yep, nine years were spent developing this relationship. Now, it's meaningless. Imagine if ""Friends"" was renewed for an 11th season, and Rachael decided to go to Paris after all. Talk about a slap in the face to fans of those characters. This was the moment in CSI that they ran out of ideas for drama, and they decided ""hey, how about Sara gets divorced?"" BRILLIANT! One problem: She's married to one of the most beloved characters on the show, who isn't even here anymore. I know the human drama isn't the focus of the show but... oh wait, yes it is! What made this show stand out was it's characters, and why it's been around for all of these years. I know not every character is going to get a happy ending, but we invested nine years in the relationship of these characters. Splitting up Sara and Grisom made me consider everything post season 12 of CSI is non canon.

Like I said, I know other fans will write this off and say ""eh, I just watch the show for the crime solving"". But this season, the forensics side of it is pushed too far to the background. The mysteries this season are too predictable and too convoluted (even for CSI standards). The human drama that used to make this show so great is now the equivalent of a bad soap opera. If you're a fan of this show, I'd say just watch up to season 12, then the season 13 premiere, which works as a nice little finale. There really isn't anything worth watching after that. I wasn't one of the fans that gave up on this show after Peterson left. I'm glad I continued to watch, but now, it's time to stop. I'm not going to act like this season is terrible (there are a few mildly entertaining episodes here and there) but it's not the same CSI.",1401667200,,3320,4.427168576104746

I started watching primarily because I am a huge Elisabeth Shue fan. That being said, I have to admit that I have grown to enjoy the show as a whole. A lot of reviewer's don't seem to care for Ted Danson's portrayal of D.B. Russell. Most feel that he is miscast in the role. I, however, disagree. I find the character to be very likable and believable. As a fairly new fan I'm not sure how relevant my opinion will be to die-hard's who've been with this show from the beginning, but I give it 5 stars, and would definitely recommend it, as well as season 12.",1385856000,,699,4.223880597014926

I'm loving Ted Danson on this show.  I think he's fit in well and brought something back to the show that had started to disappear in previous seasons after Grissom left.  He's odd and has his own way of doing things.  Finn adds some fun and tension to her part on CSI.

Last season was good, but I think this is the season that brings CSI back to the top!!",1380758400,,621,4.0
5232399,1,B00915G6TE,Over the years CSI has had some ups and downs but they have never had a really terrible season until now.  Season 13 is terrible.  The scripts are absurd.  I not talking about the familiar far-out situations that end up having (somewhat) reasonable explanations that are the trade mark of this show.  I am talking about plot lines that make no sense whatsoever.  I like all of the regular actors on CSI & feel that they have usually done a great job acting on past seasons of this show.  I felt sorry for the actors this season because the plots were so terrible.  They spend half the season working on cases that one member or other of the team has a personal connection to.  Every time they have a personal connection to a case the rule book on evidence gathering goes out the window which defeats the entire premise of the show (in my opinion).  CSI has been a great series over they years - but season 13 is a waste of time and money.,1380326400,11,938,4.314285714285714
5232439,2,B00915G6TE,"They leave you with a cliffhanger ? Really?
I don't have a clue as to what happened to the writers of this show.
They switched Actors , okay, but the writing got really lame.
Needless to say I won't buy another season, and if you watch the others - they just recycle.
HELLO - It's redundant.
Thanks , but no thanks.
It's not the Actors faults, they are pretty good, though I do think Ted Danson is miscast.
He is just NOT credible.
For the sake of entertaining TV - they better get better writers or cancel it altogether.
They took a great show to the laughable soap level.
If I would care about relationships I would watch soaps - I don't.
Where exactly did the personal relationships overthrow the crime scene?
CSI Las Vegas has very little science left in it ( I do admit that some of the ""science""  was overblown, but it was entertaining), what you have now is a never ending relationship thing that I can get from any other mediocre show.

5232447,3,B00915G6TE,"I've watched this show faithfully for 13 years, & sadly, it's really gone downhill in the last few seasons. The addition of Morgan (can we say NEPOTISM? I believe we can), has only made the show less watchable, & the snarky, ""I don't give a crap about anything other than sleeping around & taking credit for solving every case"" Finn makes me mute or change the channel whenever she's on the screen.

The show used to be a great mix of the field & the lab, now it's just ""who's going to sleep with who?"" I don't give a crap about the characters' personal relationships or who they're screwing. I just want the science back.

And I want more Greg. Eric Szmanda has always been the saving grace of this show; we've been able to watch Greg literally grow up through the years, from an irreverent (albeit incredibly intelligent & resourceful) lab rat in the first few seasons, to a dedicated, responsible CSI. We need more of the brilliant CSI work & less of the ""Ooooh, look at me, I think I'm so pretty, everyone pay attention to me!"" crap that we have to deal with whenever Morgan & Finn are forced on us.

And seriously, since when did female CSIs wear so much orange blusher & thick eyeliner that they looked like a cross between Bozo the Clown & the guest-star hooker or the week? Someone keep Elisabeth Harnois out of the makeup chair -- Morgan looks like a ten-cent hooker, NOT a professional CSI. Props to Jorja Fox for focusing on the CHARACTER & not trying to be a ""beauty queen.""",1376352000,3,1486,4.435897435897436
5232448,5,B00915G6TE,I had a hard time continuing to watch CSI when Grissom left the show (although it was my favorite).  Ted Danson has definitely made me want to watch again over and over.  His character is fantastic and brings a lot to the show...,1376265600,,229,4.3023255813953485
5232469,2,B00915G6TE,"It's not an exaggeration when I say I was one of the most avid CSI fans out there. I watched from the Pilot and never looked back. I think seasons 2-7 of this show were empirically good television. Good, tight writing. Nuance. Subtext within the cases. The character development, while measured, was nicely done. I liked seeing the characters grow and evolve within the profession and I grew particularly fond of the show's longest arc: the fascinating push/pull relationship between Grissom and Sara Sidle.

Actors get to a point when they want to move on, so Grissom leaving the show--while a bit of a blow--was okay because it was handled very well. His reunion with Sara in Costa Rica was absolutely gorgeous. Definitely the stuff that creates a bit of a legacy for both his character and hers. I think the transition to the Ray Langston character was a bit of a dropped baton. Laurence Fishburne is a very good actor, but the powers that be did a disservice by structuring the show around a new character who was installed as a newbie to the profession. It was a misstep and put the show off-balance.

I think Ted Danson is much better in all respects. I'm not particularly fond of the characters of Morgan and Finn. Morgan's entrance was handled just fine, but in the case of Finn, I feel like they're trying to force a square peg into a round hole because it's Elisabeth Shue and she's just so likeable. But in this role? She's really not. She comes off as grating and flippant and a bit obtuse when it comes to the people around her. There was a scene early in the season where they processed a graphic scene with multiple victims, and she seemed glib and smirked throughout. Consistently bad choices are made when it comes to her portrayal and characterization. She did start to grow on me as the season progressed, but it just seems like the other characters are losing screentime at her expense. George Eads and Jorja Fox seem marginalized, except when they're not.

That's my problem with season 13. Gone is the subtlety and nuance. The characters are shaping the cases, not the other way around like it used to be. We don't see how the case affects them. We see that the case is because of them. How many times can we have direct personal involvement? CSI was born and established quickly as a procedural. I don't think procedural is a dirty word. They did procedural very well. Compelling cases with a sprinkle of lovely character moments. But in S13, that is completely turned on its ear. It seems to be more of a 50/50 split and science is no longer the priority. The drama drives the science, and not always to a good place. Gone are carefully constructed plots. The CSIs have become more like cops, running into unsecured scenes guns-ablazing, processing their own evidence, and in one case, eating a meal in the trace lab. It's a bit surreal. But you want to focus on the characters now? Fine. Just do it well. Don't kill a 13 year-arc (the Grissom and Sara romance and resulting marriage) based on two references to missed phone calls. All the effort the writers before them put into that long-form, subtle arc just wiped out in one very odd scene that seemed placed there for shock value. To destroy a storyline that's popular with fans for a sweeps stunt was the dagger for this season for me.

Jorja Fox, 13 years later, is still excellent. Ted Danson is refreshing and very likable. They're the two bright spots on an otherwise mediocre TV show. It pains me to use that word in conjunction for what was such a fantastic show, but most of the characters are either forced or have evolved past the point of plausibility. The science has become marginalized. I hope they return to their roots in season 14, because right now I'm fairly certain this is going to be a DVR show for me if they don't start rectifying some of these issues.

Bright spots despite previous issues: Code Blue Plate Special, Fallen Angels, Dead Air, and Forget Me Not. Forget Me Not is a cornucopia of tropes and contrivances, but it's incredibly well acted. It's just a shame they went where they did in that episode from a characterization standpoint.",1375574400,34,4148,4.615176151761518
5232470,4,B00915G6TE,"I was hooked on CSI because of  the Gil Grissom character and the wonderful talent of William Peterson.  Every so often there is a TV show where the ensemble is unique, and everything clicks.

After William Peterson left, I think the show struggled to find that ensemble again.  I am happy to say that the addition of Ted Danson and the other characters have made this difference.  Ted Danson was the perfect driving force to lead this new ensemble cast.

I was one of the very skeptical ones as most of the original cast is now gone - but the new additions, thus far, seem to be holding their own.  Elisabeth Shue somehow manages to be abrasive and at times, even obnoxious without alienating a certain amount of sympathy for her passion and impatience that drives her to try and circumvent the rules.

5232629,4,B00915G6TE,I don't usually watch CSI Vegas because I tape other shows at the same time it airs but this was one of those where part one was on this show & part 2 was on CSI NY which I do tape. It was really nice to be able to view this episode on amazon!! I LOVE amazon prime but only LIKE CSI Vegas. It was not their best episode....,1361145600,,323,3.6956521739130435
5232630,5,B00915G6TE,I bought the product originally because my TV carrier or CBS cut the end off because of Sports scheduling.  This was the way I chose to see the whole program and it was a delight.  I could see it when I wanted and without commercials.  WoW!,1360627200,,240,4.173913043478261
5232631,5,B00915G6TE,The show is fascinationg intriguing mysterious keeps you on your toes and emotional keep going a good series to continue,1360454400,7,120,5.05
5232632,5,B00915G6TE,I was pleasantly surprised that Ted Danson took over this show and has definately been an asset.  His quirky nature and story lines keep it interesting.,1360454400,,152,4.846153846153846
5232633,5,B00915G6TE,"Having been masters at character development, its great to see them incorporate that into a script so well.  And guess who knows Vegas history well enough to solve this retro-crime?",1358121600,6,181,5.033333333333333
5232634,5,B00915G6TE,Danson has done a better job than I expected and I am glad he brought some new flow to the series. It will be even better now that Helgenberger is gone. Her persona was getting old and I never cared much for her style on the show. I have all 12 seacons on DVD and watch them over and over on cold winter weekends.,1357948800,,313,3.90625
5232635,3,B00915G6TE,I've been watching this show for years and I have to say it's getting more formulaic and less interesting.  I really wish they'd do more personality based shows rather than just the science.,1357516800,,190,4.757575757575758
5232636,5,B00915G6TE,"I still enjoy CSI even after all these years. It has a good variety of humor (silly shows), different kinds of ""bad guys"", and emotional struggles of the characters.
Everytime the main actors change I think, ""Oh no"", but the new ones are cool too and bring a different dimension to the stories.",1357344000,,294,4.566037735849057
5232637,5,B00915G6TE,Great twists and turns in this episode! You'll never guess what happens in the end.. CSI Findley is a great addition to the show.,1357171200,,129,4.416666666666667
5232638,5,B00915G6TE,Did he or didn't he?  I won't tell . . . but this is one of my favorite episodes of the season (and the guest star can't even speak) . . . or can he?,1356134400,,149,3.257142857142857
5232669,5,B00915G6TE,"I love this show, but this season seems particularly creative and compelling. Danson & Shue also seem to have hit their stride, merging well with the rest of the cast.",1355011200,,167,4.6
5232670,5,B00915G6TE,"I thought, after changing the main character three times this show would not make it.  But Ted Dansen pulls it off nicely.  I thoroughly enjoy this show and find the episodes to be believeable.  Good cast of characters.  Recommende!",1354665600,14,232,4.871794871794871
5232671,5,B00915G6TE,Love this show.  They have managed to keep it interesting all these years.  Same par as Law and Order in my book.  It's great!!!,1354406400,,128,4.25
5232672,5,B00915G6TE,its only the beginning so far i enjoy it was kinda sad to see catherine leave the show wasn't sure about ted danson and elishabeth shue as finn but they seem to make the show continue too go on so far so good,1353715200,,208,3.86046511627907
5232673,5,B00915G6TE,"LOVE LOVE LOVE SEASON 12 & 13 TED DANSON IS AWESOME, LOOKING FORWARD TO THE ENTIRE SEASON, JUST LOVE THE CAST.",1353369600,,110,4.285714285714286
5232674,4,B00915G6TE,I was able to watch the show I missed when my DVR recorded the wrong show.  I was able to watch it for under 2 dollars and watched it on my scheduled.  Very cool.,1353283200,,162,3.735294117647059
5232675,5,B00915G6TE,Even after 13 years this is still a great show.  Ted Danson is so good.  Looking forward to the rest of the season.,1352073600,,115,3.9565217391304346
5232676,5,B00915G6TE,The episode was well written and the cast did a good job. I also think the team works real well together to solve the case. This season of CSI is going to be another good season for the show.,1352073600,,191,3.923076923076923
5232677,5,B00915G6TE,This episode had a good story. I wasn't real into this episode like I am the others. I also thought that Sara may have made an enemy in the episode. In my opinion this was a good episode with a really good story.,1352073600,,212,3.953488372093023
5232678,5,B00915G6TE,This was one of the more vegas centered stories in a while. As in vegas history! It revolves around them solving the murder of a author that Sanders had a relationship with. Was she murdered by a mobster from the 1960's? or someone else?. The cast is first rate and Ted Danson just keeps getting better as the leader of the CSI's. A top notch episode from this ever popular show.,1351382400,,379,4.352112676056338
