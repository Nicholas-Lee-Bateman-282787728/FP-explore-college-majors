7976076,5,B00007G23S,"This newer Dora video has all that you have come to expect from the series. These two episodes are intertwined in that the second one begins right where the first one ended. The continuity is an interesting change for little ones to experience. The numbers 4-8 and the colors red (""rojo""), blue, green, white, orange, yellow (""amarillo"") and polka dots are all covered. In the first episode Map is obscounded by a bird who mistakes Map for a stick while searching for nesting supplies. Dora and Boots are left to make their own map to find their lost friend. Dora and Boots travel through a colorful butterfly garden, a corn field maze, and finally to Tallest Mountain where they are reunited with Map. Children will delight in needing to shout ""salta!"" and jump over tumbling watermelons as they come ""rollling toward them"" down the mountain. In the second episode, Map becomes a super hero with super strength and ""special effects powers"" to help Dora and Boots find their way (through a jungle of spiders and snakes, and a river of snapping crocodiles) to Doras' house for the super surprise.",1045958400,3,1095,4.798941798941799
