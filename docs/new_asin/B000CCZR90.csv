2457575,1,B000CCZR90,"Much of the footage is exactly the same as another set
put out by Madacy Entertainment called ""We Were Heroes,
Vietnam"" with a date of 2006. What crooks these people
are. They release a 5 dvd set in 2005 called ""Battleground
Vietnam"", then a year later they trim it down to 3 dvds
and change the picture on the box and title it as ""We were
Heroes"". Do not buy anything from Madacy Entertainment.

A much better set is called ""Vietnam War with Walter Cronkite""
with 12 hours of viewing time instead of the 6 hours on the
Madacy garbage.",1245715200,10,535,4.35
2457576,2,B000CCZR90,"Where do I start...
1. Very sappy, which adds a fakeness ra ra ra quality to it. The background noise that drowns out the technical expertise of the narrator is extremely annoying. The background noise consists of constant machine gun fire and mortar fire that has nothing to do with the narration and John Wayne type ""let's go get em boys"" music constantly blaring in the background, so half of what they are trying to teach you, you miss. I felt like I was watching a 1950's propaganda film half of the time.

2. The title of the DVD is very misleading and that pissed me off! The title reads Battlefield Vietnam War In The Jungle... there's very little footage of any real battles in the jungles of Vietnam on any of these five DVD's. Almost an entire DVD is devoted to POW Scotsdale and his wife, which although had its moments I did not buy this DVD for this, this was drawn out wayyyy too long and should have been a movie on Lifetime or Oprah's network vs. in this DVD set. I thought I was going to be hearing real testimony from soldiers who fought at actual battles and seeing footage of those battles... nope aint gonna happen. The battle field footage does not match the narration at all. At one time a guy was talking about flying a helicopter onto a mountain top at night, yet the battle field scenes were in the middle of the day. Terrible!

This DVD set is kinda like a long version of Oliver North's nightly show on Fox News. Look, I don't need patriotic music playing in the background constantly or a nice feel good story to tie it all up in a pretty bow for me. I'm a serious student of military conflict I want the real deal and this aint it. I will likely get another DVD set and give this one away as a Christmas gift.",1232150400,3,1740,4.301829268292683
2457577,5,B000CCZR90,"When I purchased this 5 DVD Disc Set I expected a very bogged down explanation of the Vietnam War.  Boy was I wrong!!!!!!

""BATTLEGROUND VIETNAM War in the Jungle"" covers the entire scope of this Era in our History.  Very well done and the samples and explanations are very concise and full of detailed information.

Bottomline: Sit back, invest the time (over 6 hours) and digest the entire 5 Discs in order. Also read the 24 page booklet which capsulizes the chronology of this unique history / documentary.  It is worth your while to get a new perspective of this terrible misunderstood war.

Summary of Discs;  1.) Into the Quagmire/Next Stop Vietnam (1954 - 1966)- the history of Vietnam from World War II until our involvement. (VERY INFORMATIVE Historically)  2.) Americas War/ Fading Light (1964-1968).  3.) POW/Dust Off -(the best of these discs, covering the POW's ordeal / torture and the MASH Units caring for the injured)  Told by Vietnam Vets including pilots, medics, soldiers and nurses!!!! This is an OUTSTANDING segment and an eye opener told by the actual people who served in their own words!!  God Bless their sacrifices for our freedom!!  4.)The Value of a Hill/The Last Run - covers the 11 day siege of HAMBURGER HILL and the End of our involvement in Vietnam (1969-1975).  5.) Bonus Disc - covers 4 (22 minute each) mini documentaries covering A Day in Vietnam (very informative), secondly Navy in Vietnam (covering Sea Bees, River Navy Training, Supplies Depots, Marine Logistics, and Naval Gunfire Support. Next Pipeline to Victory covering the massive logistics campaign to support the troops and support personell (known as Bullets, Beans and Bandages). And finally Progress to Peace.

This Collection is a very informative understanding of the Vietnam Era told to us by the actual veterans, military and civilian hero's.  A very good story to be included in your military history DVD library.",1228089600,2,1921,5.0157728706624605
2457578,4,B000CCZR90,"I would make one thing straight from the beginning. This is not by itself a complete source material to understand and absorb all that was the Vietnam Conflict. This volume is something more of a brief overview of American involvement and what went into fighting the war.
  One thing I constantly reminded myself was that this project was done to be affordable. If this were ten dollars more or higher, I would not advise it. Obviously, a lot of source video material is grainy, desaturated and some of the audio is sub-par. Madacy can't help that. Some of the video clips are repeated throughout the presentation to help carry the narration.
  But what we have with these discs is a great general account of what will always be our most divisive era in modern American history. From the roots  of our involvement to the bitter closure and steps to healing, this DVD can be a welcome addition to anyone who wants to start to learn about the Vietnam War. A great profile on POW James Bond Stockdale on disc 3 was a touching profile on the enduring bravery of American POWs.
  Since this was a look at the Vietnam War, however, a disc featuring a look at the other side of the battlefield would have been welcome. After all, it does take at least two sides to fight. America was after all making the Vietnamese country their battleground. And obviously one would be very naive to think only American soldiers and faculty were the only ones to suffer losses. Vietnamese civilians could've been the most affected by the whole Conflict and there is never any real measure of it in this DVD.
  for a great price considering the total content that it contains, I definitely recommend this as a starting point to the Vietnam War and its brief tactical exercise but this is far from a stand-alone resource.",1200268800,2,1797,4.6257861635220126
2457579,1,B000CCZR90,"I just received this package and was looking forward to viewing it.
However, I wass very dispointed.
The Stockdale interview is the only good part of it.
The rest of it is mostly made of a guy reading VERY technical minute to minute battle stories while showing battle scenes that probably have nothing to do with the narration as you can easily notice that they are showing the same battle scenes over and over, in loop!
I'm sure there ia a much better product out there.
But I haven't found it yet.",1193529600,9,500,4.445652173913044
2457580,2,B000CCZR90,"The narrator sounds like he's reading the script for the first time, and the footage is dark, grainy, and seems unrelated to the storyline.
  The  best series on the Vietnam War is BattleFIELD Vietnam.
A 12 hour, BBC produced series that aired on PBS over 10 years ago. It was released in the U.S. on VHS and in Europe on DVD, (PAL format). Incredibly good military history of the war, no political bias.",1181520000,5,404,4.506849315068493

2457582,5,B000CCZR90,"Yes, the techinical goof of drowning out the interviewee's with sound effects is unforgivable.  But it only affects those with soft voices.  The interview with Adm. Stockdale & his wife is reason alone to spend $17 on this DVD set.  True heroes.  They are what we should all aspire to be.  The historian who periodically shows up does a fantastic job at explaining why what was done where, etc.",1165276800,5,394,4.6521739130434785
2457583,3,B000CCZR90,"Viet Nam as a country, as a history, as a people, and as a war is not easy to explain, even by someone like me who spent several years there during the war. However, if a film production company is going to try, they really should do their homework.

This collection of DVDs could have been a five-star review, given the many previously unseen video clips, from both sides of the war. However, the first red flag was that the collection was made in Canada! Although quite a few Canadians came to fight in the US forces, it is no secret that most Canadians, including the government, were against the Viet Nam war and generally anti-American, treating draft dodgers as heroes (which they are still doing). In retrospect it is easy to be a Monday morning quarterback and Canada has been very good at that!

The next problem is technical. Although most of the video is fairly good (given age, climate, etc.), much of the voice over, the on-scene spoken word and interviews are DROWNED out by the noise of the combat footage, the extremely irritating and completely useless and loud music played from time to time, or, as in one case, some supposed former ""Green Beret,"" identified as ""John,"" who prefers to remain in dark shadow (and is, therefore, suspect as a wannabe, or complete phony) who whispers through his on-camera scenes, which is also overridden by the very loud and irritating music. This is just very bad and unprofessional editing.

Also, historically many important FACTS leading up to US involvement in the war are glossed over or completely ignored, not the least of which was the fanatical desire of the Vietnamese to be independent - of ANYONE! This goes back hundreds of years to Trieu Au, a woman who led Vietnamese forces and fought against the Chinese for Vietnamese independance in the third century AD.

American involvement did not begin in 1959 as the set claims, but during World War II, when OSS officers (the precursor to the CIA) were dropped into Indochina and worked with the local freedom fighter forces, including Ho Chi Minh, against the Japanese - after the French had been defeated by, or had surrendered to, the Japanese. Therefore, in Vietnamese eyes, the French no longer had any claim to Indochina.

The very basis of the American involvement in the Viet Nam war is neatly glossed over at the end of WW II, showing that the French just marched back in and took over. It wasn't that simple.

As a country that prided itself on independence, self reliance and anti-colonialism, the United States, under Truman's watch, was contacted by Ho Chi Minh no less than three times asking for US aid in ridding Viet Nam of its French colonial past. Truman ignored the requests, supported the French colonists,  and we ended up in a non-winable war and over 58,000 dead Americans.

Ho Chi Minh was a communist of the day out of necessity, because no other entity was anti-colonial, with the possible exception of the United States. However, above all else, Ho Chi Minh was a NATIONALIST and it is impossible to be a nationalist AND a communist. When the United States turned its back on Viet Nam, he had nowhere else to turn, but to the Soviets and the Chi-comms. Given that, when, in 1945, Ho Chi Minh addressed the people of Viet Nam, he presented them with a constitution based on that of the United States, not as a communist puppet regime.

All this is left out, but is extremely important in really understanding the US involvement in Viet Nam and the subsequent war.

If you just want to see combat footage, maybe this is for you. If you want to actually learn something, look elsewhere.",1152576000,72,3622,4.698738170347003
2457584,5,B000CCZR90,"This is a 5 DVD set that starts from World War II to the evacuation in 1975. It covers details few videos have that I've ever seen.

DVD 5 has the bonus material which has: A Day in Nam; Navy in Vietnam; Pipeline to Victory; and Progress to Peace. As I said this DVD is a complete history in all aspects of the Vietnam War.

8097675,3,B000CCZR90,"Battleground Vietnam: War in the Jungle Madacy Home Video 2005 NR  DVD

When I last reviewed a Madacy production it was Fighting Forces Vietnam, also a 5 disc production which I said had to be the worst documentary I've ever seen in my life.  Everyone else seemed to agree, and some said you should stay away from anything with the Madacy label on it.  Well here's ANOTHER 5 disc set from Madacy about Vietnam and I'm semi happy to say it is not the worst or the second-worst documentary I've seen in my life.  It's only in the lower 50%.

Rather than 90% US military propaganda clips and occasional wooden narration by one person, this one at least mixes it up: I'd say roughly 50% official military filming and narration, and the other 50% are interviews with a number of Vietnam vets who describe some of their most vivid memories from being there.  They don't seem to have any political axes to grind; they are simply telling the audience what it was like in some of the most harrowing moments.

This set is not told chronologically although parts of it do have a chronologic order.  Other parts focus on particular aspects: the POW experience; the medic experience, logistics, etc.  Sadly the 5th DVD was in my opinion the least useful of all; the entire thing seemed to be official-propaganda pieces that did not contribute at all to my understanding of the war, much like the entire previously mentioned set, and could have been completely omitted in my opinion (or even more useful, substituted by a genuine discussion or debate by military historians about the evolution of the conflict, what went right and what went wrong, what the armed services learned from it, that sort of thing.  No, there were no enlightening broad-scale debates, but there were some decent close-up descriptions of being there.  I give it a C.",1447804800,,1828,4.713836477987422

8097677,1,B000CCZR90,"It's honestly unwatchable for the most part.  I picked up the entire series at my local library to learn as much as I could about the war and the experiences seen there and I got literally nothing out of it.  The thing is so frenetic.  The narrator seems to be talking about something different than the video is showing and the music seems to illustrating some other movie.  Nothing matches up, it's impossible to follow.  Also, the narrator, in addition to speaking in purely technical, inhuman and hard to follow terms, never stops talking.  They let nothing sink in and there's no way to follow along or keep up with what the hell they're talking about.  It's also poorly written.  Just skip this.  I highly recommend just googleing vietnam war, there'e far better videos out there for free.",1369094400,2,795,4.702898550724638

8097681,5,B000CCZR90,THIS SERIES CAME IN A NICE TIN BOX AND THE DVD TELLS ALL THE ENDS AND OUTS OF THIS AWFUL WAR. SHOULD BE SEEN BY ALL MILITARY BUFFS.....,1319760000,,135,3.857142857142857
8097682,2,B000CCZR90,"I bought this set at Best Buy. As an avid Vietnamophile I snatched it off the shelf as soon as I saw it. The tin box, the accompanying booklet along with the cardboard foldout make it look very professional and high quality. Looks can be deceiving.

First thing you notice is the poor sound quality. Half the time you can't hear the voice over due to the ""Too loud"" music that's overly dramatic. This is a personal viewpoint but the voice over voice, for me, was annoying too. The voice is too youthful and just lacking any real character given the material.

Second thing you notice is that the information given is basically in glossary terms. Most situations are skimmed over with no real ""in depth"" which is what I enjoy. Personally I would prefer the whole first DVD to be an analysis of Vietnamese politics post Dien Bien Phu to Tonkin Gulf. The U.S. had advisers there but those years in between those two events form the basis for U.S. escalation and combat involvement. I don't want to just watch bombs going off.

Third thing is that a LOT of the footage is repeated throughout the set and sometimes, throughout the same segment. Most of us know that the footage and the content aren't always the same thing. Stock footage is used to ""illustrate"" the narration but, as I mention later, had this set been condensed to what's REALLY valuable we wouldn't have to constantly watch the same stock over and over.

There is a ton of unseen footage but I wouldn't let that be your basis for purchase. There's a reason there's a lot of unseen footage and I think that realistically most of the 5 DVD's is worthless padding. There is a whole segment devoted to a still picture of a valley with arrows representing U.S. troop movement during an operation. Again the voice over is hard to hear due to the ""too loud"" music.

In real terms, there's maybe 3 DVD's here. Maybe. But it all needs re-editing, re-mixing and sifting through.

My advice would be to pass on this one and pick up ""Cronkite's: Vietnam War"" or ""Hearts and Minds"" or ""In the year of the pig"" which hold much more salient and high quality information.",1276646400,,2118,4.545931758530184
