7072767,1,B00UZJNDL4,Disappointingly slow and dull. The trailer encapsulates the movie,1429228800,,65,6.333333333333333
7072768,5,B00UZJNDL4,"For starters, you get a couple of old pros like Al Pacino and Annette Bening tossing lines back and forth, how you gonna go wrong?

Throw in a decent story about an aging rock star trying to get beyond bourbon, blow, and bimbos and connect with something deeper (think family, folks), and you end up with a really good package. And this is despite the fact that a couple of sudsy plot points (think medical, folks) get mixed in to keep things moving.

Mostly, its just good fun.

But a sharp script and Pacinos acting chops do get at something touching. They show us that--underneath all the narcissism, hedonism, money, and madness of rock star celebrity--there are in fact actual human beings trying to have lives, and screwing them up just like regular people.

Highly recommended.",1428969600,9,784,4.742647058823529
7072769,4,B00UZJNDL4,"""Danny Collins"" (2015 release; 106 min.) brings the story of an aging rock star Danny Collins (played by Al Pacino). As the movie opens, we are reminded that the movie is ""kind of based on a true story a little bit"". In the opening scene, Danny Collins is interviewed in 1971 for the Chime In magazine, on the verge of his big breakthrough. The movie then switches to July 12, 2014, when Danny performs at a sold-out Greek Theater. The next day, at his 'surprise' birthday party, Danny's manager (played by Christopher Plummer) has a birthday gift: a letter John Lennon wrote to him after reading that 1971 interview, which never arrived. In the letter, Lennon urges him to ""stay true to yourself and to your music"". Danny has a ""d'oh"" moment and decides to change his life. He flies out to New jersey and sets up shop in a Hilton room, and the first order of business is to visit his grown-up son whom he's never met. At this point we are about 15 min. into the movie. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourelf how it all plays out.

Several comments: this is the directing debut of screen writer Dan Fogelman, of ""Crazy Stupid Love"" and ""Last Vegas""., both of which I have seen, and I have to say that ""Danny Collins"" is perfectly in line with both those movies: a pleasant, if non-challenging, movie experience. The differentiator here, though, is the music, which obviously plays a HUGE role in the movie. First, Fogelman able to convince Yoko Ono to allow the use of a bunch of John Lennon songs (from his solo career). I counted at least 7 in the movie (Working Class Hero; Whatever Gets You Through The Night; Imagine; Nobody Told Me; Beautiful Boy; Dream #9; Love Is Real). On top of that, the original songs that appear in the movie are composed by none other than Ryan Adams (yes, THAT Ryan Adams) and Theodore Shapiro. But what makes this movie ultimately click are the winning performances: let's start with Al Pacino, now 74 if you can believe it. He looks like he's having a blast with this role. Annette Bening is just perfect as the 'mousy' Hilton manager and Danny's potential love interest. When Danny first arrives at the hotel, Danny jokes with her that ""while you're checking me in, I'm checking you out"", ha! Bobby Cannavale as Danny's son and Jennifer Garner as his wife do very nicely as well. But in the end, it's mostly about Pacino and he oozes charm from start to finish. Stay for the movie's end titles, though, where it is revealed on whose real life musician this is (very loosely) based on (I admit I have never heard of him before).

""Danny Collins"" finally opened this weekend here in Greater Cincinnati, playing on a handful of screens. The early evening screening where I saw this at was not attended well (and I'm being mild), which sort of surprised me, as the trailer for this has been playing regularly in theaters for quite some time. Bottom line: if you are in the mood for a perfectly pleasant rom-com with a winning cast, you cannot go wrong with ""Danny Collins"".",1428710400,50,3055,4.552727272727273
7072770,5,B00UZJNDL4,"Life doesn't offer do-overs. But maybe it can offer work-arounds.

Our hero, an aging, hard-living rock star, unexpectedly gets a letter that had been sent to him 40 years ago by former Beatle John Lennon. (We recognize 'Beautiful Boy' and 'Imagine' in the soundtrack.) Inspired by a true story, this is Hollywood's version.

Written with great humor and directed unerringly by Dan Fogleman (""Crazy Stupid Love"") this star-studded troop never makes a misstep; there are no weak players. Full disclosure: For some reason, I have never been a fan of Al Pacino, but he won me over in this one.

Here are the key players:
  * Al Pacino (""Manglehorn"") our eponymous hero is a self-absorbed coke head, a thrice-married playboy and a burned-out performer, sick and tired of his career, his fans and his life. The letter causes an epiphany.
  * Christopher Plummer (""Elsa & Fred"") Frank is Danny's loyal manager who finds the letter. He just didn't think he'd have to go to New Jersey... TWICE! His amusing back story about Danny is important.
  * Bobby Cannavale (""Blue Jasmine"") Tom is the first person Danny thinks about when he decides to re-examine his life. Cannavale plays decent men wrenchingly well.
  * Jennifer Garner (""Draft Day"") Samantha loves her husband and her daughter. She is positive Danny will be sent packing the minute Tom sets eyes on him. Her practical outlook and understated affection is vital.
  * Giselle Eisenberg (""Sex Tape"") Danny's bonus is a winning little girl named Hope. She's cunning, cute, and conquers him in a heartbeat. I hope Hollywood doesn't take the shine off this little gem!
  * Annette Bening (""Ruby Sparks"") Mary Sinclair works at the Hilton where Danny books a room. He checks her out while she checks him in. To their great amusement, she and Danny can synchronize their patter; the dialog is terrific!
  * Melissa Benoist (""Glee"") Janie is the desk clerk at that Hilton. She's the one who messes up the guest register.
  * Josh Peck (""Red Dawn"") Nicky is the parking attendant at the Hilton. He will NEVER forget Danny!

The most shocking thing to me is that these are all nice people, including Danny, cocaine habit and all. There will be no gunshots, no violence, no vehicular mayhem, and no blowie uppie stuff; just eight (count 'em - 8!) good people to root for. Are we sure this is an Al Pacino movie?

The closing credits include part of an interview with the folk singer who actually DID receive a letter addressed to him from John Lennon; it arrived decades after Lennon's death. Don't leave too soon....",1427587200,47,2557,4.805491990846682

Annette Bening was, of course and as usual, splendid, beautiful, top actress.  This was a great movie with great superstars and beyond.  The actor that played Pacino's distant son Cannavale was excellent too -- he's going to the top!  Garner was herself the wonderful actress playing his beautiful daughter-in-law -- she's already a superactress.  And, Christopher Plummer always tops his acting roles with whatever & whoever -- he is a starr.  Liked that bellboy scene where the minion gets the sports car -- and my husband liked the scene where Pacino nicknames his wife's boyfriend ""busy-work"".",1455840000,,756,4.905511811023622

7072800,4,B00UZJNDL4,"Very loosely based on what happened to a singer-songwriter Steve Tilston, Danny Collins is a pleasant if predictable comedy drama about a hugely popular rock singer Danny Collins (Al Pacino), who receives a 40-year-old undelivered letter from John Lennon  a letter that could have changed the course of his life.

So what Danny Collins would do? I think you can guess it easily enough  like going to see his son Tom (Bobby Cannavale) he hasn't met before  but that the story is pretty predictable does not mean that Danny Collins is not interesting.

Actually, the film is amusing thanks to the fine performances from the great cast including, besides Pacino and Cannavale, Annette Bening, Jennifer Garner and Christopher Plummer. Giselle Eisenberg as a little girl Hope is delight to see.

Written and directed by writer Dan Fogelman (known for Tangled Crazy, Stupid, Love. and others), Danny Collins is an entertaining comedy drama, a nice blend of sentimentality and humor delivered with very good acting, dialogue and John Lennon songs.",1448582400,,1040,5.124260355029586

Never bought into it emotionally at all.  Pacino was good... he managed to not overact.  But Annette Bening seemed to
be channeling Diane Keaton on ecstasy. She was so annoying!  And the whole rhythm of the movie was kinda slack.
The father-son story was corny and clumsily handled.  And I am very sensetive to father-son stories... but this one just left me cold.

7072841,4,B00UZJNDL4,"Danny Collins (Al Pacino) is an aged rock star who lives off his past hits with mediocre concerts to adoring fans. He still loves his drugs, alcohol, and young girls. A newly discovered letter from John Lennon, to him, gives him an epiphany as he reaches out to the only family he has never known, that of his illegitimate son Tom (Bobby Cannavale). While attempting to connect to a family that doesn't want or know him, he meets Hotel manager Mary Sinclair (Annette Bening) who is smart, witty, and charming. She is someone Danny can talk to.

Al Pacino, who has done far more movies these last 10 years than his first 10 in films, gives us a good performance in a role that didn't seem right for him. The support cast was good. I liked how the film ended, not too formula, but not too far from it. The film is inspired by the letter that Steve Tilston received, although Danny Collins' song ""Sweet Baby Doll"" was so much like ""Sweet Caroline"" I had to think about James Taylor. The film stayed away from any real original music. Even Danny's new original song started out with riffs from ""Imagine."" It was a let down in the musical department. They might have been better off with an old singer who can also act.

7072847,5,B00UZJNDL4,"I came to this movie not a big fan of Al Pacino, nor of rom coms,  but I really loved it. Al Pacino was great as the aging singer who left his ideals behind in his pursuit of success, his indefatigable charm really carried this movie forward. When his oldest friend and manager gifts him with a letter, written to him by John Lennon, dated 40 years before, he has to take a hard look at his life and he doesn't like what he sees.

Embarking upon a path of redemption, he goes to meet his son, who is in his 30s, but they've never met. At the same time, he's trying to write music again and discover who he really is. The story is told in a way that is believable, without being cloying or overly sentimental. Danny Collins is a good man at heart, and watching his journey, with some mistakes, of course, is truly enjoyable.

Al Pacino is excellent, and has a great supporting cast with Bobby Cannavale as his estranged son, Tom. Christopher Plummer makes the most of his role as Danny's best friend and manager, Annette Bening is charming as Danny's more age-appropriate love interest and Jennifer Garner is lovely as Tom's wife, Samantha.

You won't be disappointed in this film, one of the best I've seen in the past year.",1438819200,,1224,4.402654867256637
7072848,4,B00UZJNDL4,Al Pacino and Annette Benning have good patter and chemistry. Story is a slice of life of the aging pop singer and what is left behind and what they hope to be able to recapture. Everyone is excellent and it ends on a plausible note.....,1438732800,,237,4.288888888888889
7072849,5,B00UZJNDL4,"This is a cliched film about an old rock star who is trying to fix some mistakes he made in his life. It's loosely based on a letter John Lennon wrote to an English folk singer and Lennon's songs play through the film. Even thought he movie is predictable, I loved it. Pacino has had some odd roles later in his career but he does a very good job with this one. Danny Collins is a charming burn out. The cast is terrific. If you don't take it too seriously, it's a cute, charming film with some funny moments.",1438560000,,509,4.151515151515151

7072851,2,B00UZJNDL4,"Yes, based on a true story but you know how that goes - artistic license and money pursuit means there's going to be a lot of embellishment, deletions, and flat out made-ups.

Movie starts out engaging especially the dialogue - witty, sarcastic, poignant, etc. Acting matched as well. Then 
it all starts to fall apart like wheels stuck and spinning in the same rut. It not only got tiresome (hearing the same stuff over and over) (i.e. stuff meaning poor ego rich me, drugs, booze, sex innuendo), but it really got clich overload with dad making amends with cast off son (with subsequent discord of course) plot hook. And, to make it a double hook to catch the fish (audience) is the old standby of son is inflicted with a life ending illness scripted in to provide dad an opportunity to be a more likable guilty rich dude.",1438387200,,824,4.5608108108108105
7072852,3,B00UZJNDL4,Certainly worth the rental fee good solid cast. Pacino is clueless and not at all believable as an aging rock star. He plays the role more like a mafia don.,1438300800,,156,4.233333333333333

7072854,4,B00UZJNDL4,"Although I have enjoyed a lot of Al Pacino's work, I watched this because of Annette Bening.  She sparkled in The American President and Regarding Henry.  This is a different sort of role than those. She seems to almost disappear behind glasses and a demure attitude.  A friend who watched it with us thought at first she was Diane Keaton, except she was too young to be her.  Pacino's role, though he blusters and raises his voice a lot, was a bit restrained for him also - as it was supposed to be.  After all, this story concerned a man whose whole life had been all about him - his pleasures, his needs, but now he was focusing outside himself. Both actors filled their roles well and there was enough chemistry between them to make you root for them.

In a way I think the movie was hijacked by Bobby Cannavale, who plays his son. His is a layered performance.  He could have easily gotten lost in the anger towards Danny Collins that boiled over at times, but the decades of anger were balanced out just enough by the love of his family, which always showed through. That made the last third of the movie believable.

This isn't one those movies I will want to watch again and again, but it is a simple story told well.  It tells us at the beginning that it is sort of based on a true story, and the real ""Danny Collins"" is shown in the end credits.  They obviously added a lot to make the movie, but they could have gone crazy with it but didn't.",1437177600,2,1453,4.289377289377289

7072857,5,B00UZJNDL4,"Hard living and feeling exhausted with it all aged rocker Danny Collins (Al Pacino) takes the stage once again for his sold-out audience. He's singing to another packed house on this tour. Yes, Al Pacino is actually singing ""Sweet Baby Doll"" as Danny Collins to his career-long fans who have heard this song over and over as he gets adulation from his adoring crowd of now senior citizens. They know every word to the song while absolutely demanding it to be sung. Danny is continually dissatisfied with doing these performances while looking and feeling  ridiculous. He will still go through the motions and then go onto partying constantly with people young enough to be his grandchildren crowding his home and making him feel his age a whole lot more. Danny cannot stand the out of control lifestyle any longer while looking over on the lawn after the party at his passed out twenty-something fianc, Sophie (Katarina Cas) who while coherent begins calling him ""Sugar Daddy"". This is not how his life was supposed to be he tells his ever loyal and agreeable manager Frank (Christopher Plummer) while he's feeling washed-up and strung-out. Then Frank gives him the letter; a very important and long overdue letter!

Way back in 1971, a young and upcoming artist, Danny, gave an interview to Chime In magazine upon beginning his career and is compared to John Lennon. Lennon happens to read this article and responds with encouraging words, stating to be ""true to his music"" and to himself although it comes to the shyster reviewer who greedily kept it for himself. This changed the course of Danny's entire life. And this all transpires at the outset of the film.

The letter is a literal treasure from his idol to Danny which also contains something completely personal and special for him alone. It sparks a new clarity and positivity in him to look at what is really important in his life now; his son Tom Donnelly (Bobby Cannavale) in New Jersey. Married to Samantha (Jennifer Garner) who is tentative to even speak to him at first, along with their adorable child, Hope (Giselle Eisenberg), who definitely tells it like it is. Look for this young actress to go far with her personality and sparkle. Now for Danny, the most important thing is to try his hardest to reconnect with his son and family. Young Hope is very instigating in this process; she loves ""everything"" including his singing. Danny travels there determined to make headway with his son. He is only interested in what is important in life now, his only family. Out of the partying scene, he's writing music again instead of trying to sing someone else's tunes. While in New Jersey, he stays at the Hilton with the manager being the wonderfully tough at first although then quite funny, Mary Sinclair (Annette Bening) and they do have a great ""patter"" between them.

The film is packed with a cast of characters that lift this story to an entertaining run through the gamut of emotions. Each character portrayal added another layer to Danny Collins' new beginning. From all the ""Great Faces"" at the New Jersey Hilton including the desk clerk, Jamie (Melissa Benoist) and the valet who parks his Mercedes-Benz, Nicky (Josh Peck). These people are all so genuine even though he is still ""ridiculous"" according to Mary when he asks her how he looks; Danny is on a quest and agrees jocularly with her. The movie also does get to certain points of a couple plot twists which I really understood. It served to show me the power of tenacity; a true and relentless spirit of beginning family ties. There are vital subplots going on that worked for me and only made this ensemble cast all the more believable and entertaining together. The summer help running the desk at the Hilton and the valet car attendant will not soon forget Mr. Danny Collins.

Written and directed by Dan Fogelman we watch the truths, triumphs, and trials of a disconnected at first, American family. One with spirit, compassion and character with the ability to rise and fall which easily drew me into this delightful extended family's conditions. I felt these characters were so well drawn and were easy to relate to along with the added humor coming from the situations and especially the quick dialog. There wasn't one person in the cast that I didn't care about. As for me, Al Pacino hits the mark as performer Danny Collins while trying to dig out of any messes he may have dug himself into in his life. The movie is ""Kind of based on a true story ... a little bit"" and that was an intriguing way to begin the film for me. I must mention the inspired soundtrack ('Ryan Adams' and Theodore Shapiro) which is full of lovely John Lennon songs and so many too. Some had me in tears. The very end credits are scored by ""Instant Karma"" (is gonna get you!) and I thought that was perfect to finish with. One really should stay to view all that is offered still and just how this is a story which is a ""little bit"" true ... and why.",1434844800,22,4967,4.684994272623139

 Steve Tilston, a British folk musician, gave an interview in 1971, in which he worried whether money would affect his career as a songwriter. John Lennon read the article and sent him a letter telling him not to worry and also gave him his phone number, inviting the unknown musician to call him. Tilston's interaction with Lennon was never to be since the letter was sent care of a magazine and someone there selfishly kept it, without passing it on to Tilston. He ended up hearing about it 34 years later when a private collector, who had it in his possession, told him about it.

Screenwriter/director Dan Fogelman uses this interesting tidbit of a story to add a little flavor to a portrait of an aging (fictional) musician, ""Danny Collins,"" played by Al Pacino. Collins's debut album back in the early 70s featured some sensitive folk tunes in the vein of Cat Stevens. But we're informed that Collins decided to use other composers' material and ended up regurgitating those pop hits before an adoring cadre of senior citizens who know all the words to his hits, especially his biggest hit of all, ""Hey, Baby Doll (the song sounds suspiciously like Neil Diamond's biggest hit, ""Sweet Caroline."") Collins, still indulging in booze and drugs, drives around in a large tour bus, and plays before large capacity concert venues. He has a much younger bimbo of a girlfriend but isn't upset at all when he catches her cheating on him, one night after returning from one of his concerts.

Some critics couldn't believe that Collins would suddenly tell his manager (played by a not completely believable Christopher Plummer) that he was canceling the rest of his touring schedule and moving to New Jersey, in an attempt to connect with his construction worker son he's never known. Collins' desire to clean up his act might be a little hard to believe, but note that later on he has a big drug and alcohol relapse which suggests that he was never really serious about cleaning up his act completely.

What I found a bit difficult to believe was the idea that years ago, the young mother of Collins' son, was much more concerned with her own personal sense of integrity than ensuring that she and her newborn would be handsomely taken of. Usually in cases such as this, the mother is quite insistent about making the celebrity pay for the upkeep of a child born out of a wedlock, until his adulthood. But no, the mother rips up the checks Collins sends her and son Tom (Bobby Cannavale), later follows in his mother's footsteps, and vows to have nothing to do with the errant father.

Tom insists that his father can't make up for the time lost, especially by lavishing the family with material blandishments. But as it turns out, that's exactly what Collins does--he pays for a special school for his granddaughter who suffers from hyperactivity.

Gradually Tom warms up to his father especially after the revelation that he has cancer and must go for a special treatment that may or may not work. Collins is there for Tom and this is what endears the son to the father. But due to the aforementioned relapse (the crisis at the end of the Second Act), it appears that Collins is unable to nullify a life-long pattern of self-sabotage that leads again to the estrangement between the two.

A sub-plot involving Collins' flirtation with the manager at the Hilton, Mary Sinclair, played by the enormously talented Annette Benning , helps lighten up some of the more ""heavy"" proceedings involving the father-son interactions.

The rather predictable trope of a family member felled by cancer and the positive outcome is what we expect. But Fogelman neatly wraps things up by not allowing the audience to see the doctor come in the room with the good news. Rather, due to Collins' powers of observation, it's an audio cue that tips the audience off to an optimistic conclusion.

""Danny Collins"" is rather predictable and sentimental but at the same time manages to occasionally pull at the heartstrings.",1429488000,3,4037,4.79568345323741
