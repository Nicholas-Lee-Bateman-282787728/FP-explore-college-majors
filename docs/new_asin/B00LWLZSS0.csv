6508784,5,B00LWLZSS0,"If ever there was a film about getting out of a very desperate situation, it's ""Canopy."" Hardly a word spoken, but the incredible cinematography and story of a lost soldier (who has parachuted onto an enemy-occupied island) during WWII will have you spellbound until the very end of this movie!

This is also a story about finding friendship and an ally with someone who doesn't speak the same language, but knows that together, maybe both of you can escape adversity. A bit too intense for children, but I would recommend for teens and older audiences.",1413331200,2,553,4.821052631578947

6508807,3,B00LWLZSS0,"If you like watching documentaries on rainforest plants and playing those with the audio turned off, then this may be the movie for you.  Canopy is a film with pretty much no dialogue, basically an Australian pilot wakes up in the Singapore rainforest hanging from his parachute whose chute is stuck in a tree branch.  The film goes for 80 minutes, originally before watching I thought, what only 80 minutes surely they could have padded that out to at least 90 like most films, but I'm sure glad they didn't.  Basically its just the odd scene of him walking through mangroves and various artistic shots of the rainforest from above the canopy or of various rainforest plants, with him hiding low amongst them every time he hears Japanese voices.  There is pretty much no dialogue in the film or even other characters.  It probably is representative of the isolation and loneliness of being in this situation, but it fails to convey the fear a lone soldier in a war where the Japanese do horrendous things to the captured. I also wondered why he didn't seem to be being eaten alive by mosquitos as he should have been. The word boring maybe gets used a bit much with non action movies, but it unfortunately is appropriate for this one.  Unless you're into looking at various rainforest plants, I'd give this one a miss.",1416614400,2,1319,4.663793103448276
6508808,1,B00LWLZSS0,"Glad I watched it on Netflix and didn't waste my money paying for it on Amazon. This movie is terribly slow, and I don't just mean the storyline. Some scenes go on for several minutes without anything happening, whether it's just the jungle or the face of an actor or even the beginning or end where there's nothing but a black screen for at least 60 seconds, leaving you wondering if your computer's WiFi lost the signal. If the director thought the slow screens were artistic then this is a masterpiece, however, for me it was just a waste of time.",1416096000,2,550,4.455445544554456

6508810,1,B00LWLZSS0,This thing is atrocious. Almost certainly makes the list of ten worst movies I've ever seen. It's about three minutes of material stretched into 80. The pace is beyond slow.

6508812,1,B00LWLZSS0,"Really? If ever I wanted to demand even $1 of rental money back, it would be for this film. Save yourself the money. If there was a constantly panning video cam in the jungle with great audio, like those help me sleep apps, this would be the film it would produce. In 5% of the scenes there is a white actor who never says anything and ends up getting a chinese guy killed but him surviving for no apparent reason at the hand of a few japanese guys who you see for literally 45 seconds in the whole film. Geez, who gets to spend money on doing crap like this with no accountability? Trust fund kids of famous directors?",1415059200,3,619,4.2100840336134455

6508814,3,B00LWLZSS0,"What a unique film! Slow, meditative, beautiful. Minimalist in both form and feeling.

An Australian pilot is shot down over the jungle in World War Two and seeks to escape capture or deaththat's the plot, but most of the film isn't really about that plot, or advancing it.

If you're looking for an action film, this is definitely not it. There are 30-second commercials with more action. Nor is it really a survival film (the focus is more on the feeling of being hunted and confused than on what he's actually doing). There's almost no dialogue, and very few actors. There's almost nothing you'd expect from a WWII movie, except the historical setting.

That said, there's some beautiful film-making here. If you're into seeing a film as an experience, rather than entertainment, this might be your thing.",1413849600,4,808,4.883211678832117
8668600,5,B00LWLZSS0,"Incredible film. A lot like the ""Thin Red Line,' in its incredible photography and meditation on the rhythms of the jungle. But, this is a more personal journey, as there are only two main actors. Also, the movie gives the strange feeling of being in a cocoon, as an air war goes on over the treetops....

8668602,3,B00LWLZSS0,"What a strange film.  Shot down pilot in jungle,  hiding from the Japanese,  meets Chinese soldier.  The two then try to keep out of sight of the Japanese.  Not very much happening,  I think the director aimed for a ""thought"" piece about how bewildering being in the jungle trying to evade capture must be.  Not sure if the idea works but it is beautifully filmed.",1445904000,,364,4.507692307692308

At least it does not have the word `war' or `battle' in the title but once again we have misleading artwork (in the UK only at least the US one is more realistic) which aims to sell this as an action war film - which it is not. It is about an Australian airman - Jim - who bails out during the Japanese taking of Singapore and gets caught in the canopy of the jungle. He meets a Chinese soldier and they try to evade capture.

Well that is about it, the acting is mostly very good, the photography is actually excellent and the CGI is above ok, but so little happens. This was obviously done on purpose and some have commented that it is meant to make you think of the human condition and to try to get inside the mind of a person put into such straits. All well and good if it posits itself as that - this did not.

I should have realised when the only film advert in the trailers was for the lamentable `Battle Over Normandy' that this was not going to be a keeper - I am happy to say this is nowhere near as dire as that effort - if you do want a bit of a war treat I made a rubbish video with my action men and a Pound Shop Barbie doll - only watch if you really do have nothing better to do - a bit like this film really. I am still giving 3 stars for the acting and camera work, but I am in a generous mood.",1434844800,,1707,4.944250871080139
