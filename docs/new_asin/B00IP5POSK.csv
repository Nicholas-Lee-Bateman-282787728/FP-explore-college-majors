8644390,1,B00IP5POSK,"I purchased this set NEW from a catalog mail order company a few years ago. 5 of the 8 discs have several movies/shows that refuse to play on any DVD player that I try. Thinking I just had a defective set, I ordered 2 more sets via Amazon (both used but in very good condition). Sadly, the same movies/shows don't play on these 2 sets either.  It is obvious now that every DVD set of ""100 Action Classics"" has the same issues.  ""EMSON""  is the company that distributes this set. I tried contacting them via their website but I have never received a reply back. DON'T BUY this set and be very cautious buying ANY set distributed by ""EMSON"".  POOR QUALITY! You can watch SOME of the selections but many will not play at all. One movie, ""Fast and Furious"" plays for about 13 minutes and then freezes.  Same on all 3 sets I've tried. BOO, HISS!!",1497916800,,841,4.3312101910828025
