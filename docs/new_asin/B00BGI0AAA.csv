But one night I was flipping through the channels and I stopped at an episode mid-season and got sucked in. That was it for me and since I had missed the first 10 episodes I had to buy them and watch them on Amazon-right away. And it was worth it, the show is fantastic. Before I get into the show any further, let me say that it is not at all like the original 80's series, but the idea is similar. The show has different elements in the characters and their backgrounds as well as the circumstances are different (don't want to spoil it for you). The two leads Kristen Kreuk and Jay Ryan are amazing and their chemistry together is Epic! Congrats to whomever casted those two together, classic! The rest of the cast is also wonderful, funny, and they have their own story-lines going too. So it's just not about the leads although at times it connects them. You end up loving the whole BATB crew! The show has action, comedy, drama, and romance. Each episode gets better than the last. The clothes Cat wears I love and the music is great I already made a playlist--hoping for a soundtrack too. And I was so happy to hear that it was renewed for a second season because this show is going to be big, you just have to give it a chance. I already have 3 of my friends hooked. Thank you CW and CBS for renewing and making a great show! A big thanks to the cast and crew, I am so loving the show. And even though it's over, I am watching the re-runs and waiting for the DVD to come out SOON please!!!",1370390400,3,1625,4.228295819935691

This version didn't play on my Philips Region Free DVD Player player, which I have in addition to my regular NTSC DVD player!  I am not sure why.  Very disappointed with this particular disc, but happy to have found it in NTSC!  Please be careful ordering this wonderful film, especially if you have equipment for viewing in the USA!",1497052800,,443,4.641025641025641

Lets get things clear if you buy a region b blu ray it will not work in usa region a blu ray players.  So pay attention.  I did get region a from amazon.  See the link and all the reviews",1466553600,4,276,5.658536585365853
8568210,4,B00BGI0AAA,"The two previous reviews said that this isn't a real blu-ray/DVR because they couldn't get it to play. The reason for this isn't because it's not real, but because it's REGION B; meaning it won't play on DVD players in the U.S. Or Canada, which are set to Region A. And even though they may have gotten movies from overseas before that worked, many are region-free, meaning they'll play everywhere. On the back of 99% of dvd's-including this one-it tells the region code. So before you buy this movie, make sure you have a compatible (Region B or Region-Free) blu-ray or DVD player. Don't make the same mistake these other people did and in turn, bash this movie for not being real, leaving a review that has nothing to do with the film itself.

THAT SAID:  this film is beautifully done. The cinematography is a visual masterpiece, the acting is spot-on, with Vincent Cassel doing what he does in every movie he's in and totally encapsulating himself in the role of the beast, giving the audience a frightening, despondent, albeit heartfelt beast in love. Lea Seydoux's rendering of Belle gives us the opportunity to see another side to her acting ability that we haven't seen in her other ""well-known"" roles. She is compassionate, if not timid; staunch, yet melancholy. The wickedness and mean-spirited side of her that seems to be the norm is all but gone.
  This film (as long as you have the correct disc-player) is definitely one worth watching.",1458000000,18,1451,4.768924302788845

8568212,1,B00BGI0AAA,"I tried this on a bluray player, a built in player on TV and a computer.  Not one device worked.  I'm really sad about it cause the preview looked really good.  But this is neither a bluray disc or dvd.  As I have purchased imported dvds and blurays in the past that have worked.  DO NOT BUY!  It's a rip off",1457654400,,308,3.9672131147540983
8568213,5,B00BGI0AAA,"This show aired in HD 1080i with 5.1 surround sound on the CW network.

The show looks beautiful and needs to be released on Blu-ray with extras such as behind the scenes, cast interviews, cast commentary, outtakes, et cetera just to name a few.

Unfortunately, Season 1 and 2 have yet to see a Blu-ray release whereas other CW TV shows such as ""Arrow"" which premiered the same season gets a Blu-ray / DVD combo release.

Give Beauty and the Beast the credit it deserves and all the hard work that went into making it look great on HD TV with surround sound should be transferred to Blu-ray the way it was meant to be seen.  DVD SD quality is a huge downgrade from Over The Air HD broadcast quality.

Make this happen for your loyal fans...",1417651200,,740,4.372262773722627
8568214,5,B00BGI0AAA,"Beauty and the Beast the second the pilot aired, I was hooked instantly. I love this show so much I take in every single detail, and watch it over and over again. I couldn't wait until the next episode aired. Kristin Kreuk and Jay Ryan's Chemistry is like the best ever that I've seen. Austin Basis is totally awesome and if not for beauty and the beast I would not have joined twitter and the beast family that are totally awesome. If you love romance/action/science fiction you will love Beauty and the Beast. Trust me when I say you will become addicted and that's not really a bad thing especially when the show is excellent and has amazing actors. If you haven't watched it, give it a try you don't know what you are missing and season 2 just come already!!!",1371340800,2,763,4.418439716312057
