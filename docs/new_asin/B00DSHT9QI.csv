5853597,5,B00DSHT9QI,"I have always had an interest in learning to play the piano, but I was never able to take conventional lessons because of a lack of time (and money).  After looking around for a comprehensive beginner's course, I decided to give this DVD lesson a chance, and I am glad I did.  It is very thorough and is an excellent starting point for those wishing to learn the basics of piano playing.  I was taught the proper finger positions along with some beginner scales, and all were introduced in a manner that I could understand - which was vital since I have had no sort of training beforehand. In fact, I can now play ""Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"" on the piano!  For the price, I think that the quality of this video is amazing, and the length is perfect to keep you engaged in the lessons.  I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone thinking of taking piano lessons, or just wanting to learn piano basics for fun.",1373846400,18,912,4.404761904761905
5853598,5,B00DSHT9QI,"I found this video easy, understandable and not boring at all.  The piano teacher, Matt Brogan teaches all the basics from holding your hands on the keyboards, playing the keys and putting the chords together to play great songs.
As a beginner learning piano, he starts with simple directions to learning your notes A through G from the left side of the piano.  With his step by step instructions you will be playing great songs like Let It Be by the Beatles and Jingle Bells.
I would recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to learn how to play piano.  Easy to follow lessons with a great instructor!",1373241600,4,600,4.537037037037037

5853600,4,B00DSHT9QI,"This is great to encourage a beginner to play the piano.  But it is missing one important item,  a copy of the sheet music with the practice songs so the beginners can see how the notes look like that they are learning too play. That's why only four stars.",1460937600,,256,4.204081632653061

5853602,5,B00DSHT9QI,Very easy video to full with learning how to play the piano.  My favorite part was learning Twinkle Twinkle Little Star.  He stars with the right hand then moves to the left hand.  I wish the video had a table of content so it would be easy to find where he teaches each song.  For Twinkle Twinkle Little Star it is around the 30 minute mark.,1458691200,,342,4.136363636363637
5853603,3,B00DSHT9QI,"While you can learn from this DVD it could be much better. The DVD skips in several spots and the earlier footage appears to be done while the camera is hand held. DVD provides a basic understanding of the piano, teaches a few simple songs, and a few chords. The content is just okay. It's difficult to apply the lessons unless you can watch while sitting in front of the keyboard which in my opinion makes an instruction book a bit more useful. Excellent idea but the technology limits capability. If the content was transferable to a phone or tablet so that it could sit on the keyboard during practice I might have given it a higher rating. Unlike the piano, DVD is nearing its end of life and this lesson format may already be obsolete. I'd recommend looking at a more up to date teaching medium.",1450569600,2,800,4.448979591836735

5853612,1,B00DSHT9QI,Well got this today and thought I would give it a shot. I figured it would pair well with the new digital piano I purchased. Put it into the laptop and loaded it up. Couldn't even make it through the first lesson as it is DOA disc read errors and skipping several minutes in the lesson due to fragmented packets. Called amazon and I have to send this back to them to get reimbursed for the purchase. I have bought from amazon for over 5 years. My buying history should speak for itself as I have rarely reported any issues but I had them contact me and now get the wonderful inconvenience of hitting a UPS store to send it back after I find a working printer.,1413849600,3,659,4.196850393700787

5853615,5,B00DSHT9QI,"With the piano and keyboard lessons, I have learned to play the piano.  I know I am not an expert yet, and I'm not going to go write my own materials just yet, but you have to start somewhere.  That is what the lessons have done for me.  It has sparked what I'm sure will become a lifelong passion.  I recomend them to all beginners.  Thank you for such an amazing asset.",1385251200,10,371,4.097222222222222
5853616,5,B00DSHT9QI,"Bought this DVD because the piano we have is just sitting around collecting dust and it's about time somebody used it. When the family gets together, it's sad that we can't do anything with the thing. I've bought books and ""instructional"" videos before, but they were complicated, and just like our piano, they just  sat around collecting dust after a while.

This DVD has gotten me further than anything I've used before. It's simple, straight-forward and no-frills. Literally, the steps are: Put the DVD in, and press play. Extra bonus: David Brogan's slight accent somehow catches my attention most of the time. It's like having that kind Celtic uncle you've never had taking you step-by-step.

I'm almost done viewing all the Christmas songs, and it's only been two days since I've received the DVD. I'm hoping in the next couple of months I can learn all the Christmas songs so I can play them this season.

Great Deal for what you get, would highly recommend.",1381104000,6,965,4.83030303030303
5853617,5,B00DSHT9QI,"I have always wanted to learn how to play my aunt's piano, but thought I didn't have the time or patience for lessons. Then my son learned to play an instrument pretty quickly with a DVD, and I thought it might be possible for me to learn to play an instrument that way too. So, I went looking for something that would help me accomplish this little goal, and I found the perfect product in this just under two hour DVD.

In the first half hour, I went from knowing virtually nothing about the piano to being able to play Twinkle Twinkle Little Star with my right hand. Now I'm working on learning the song with my left hand. The teacher on the DVD is great and makes everything easy to understand. I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to learn, but doesn't have time or money to devote to lessons.",1379635200,5,813,4.313725490196078
5853618,5,B00DSHT9QI,"I was hopeful this disk would provide useful lessons for beginners, and it easily met my expectations and more. Irish pianist David Brogan takes you through the basics, from learning the most basic songs to slightly more challenging works.

I found his approach, zeroing in on the finger work and pulling back to discuss larger concepts, to be most helpful. I'd recommend this disk to anyone just getting started who'd like a qualified instructor to take them through introductory technique and concepts.",1376438400,5,504,5.146341463414634
