595970,4,6303209971,"This is the sort of movie you watch with a smirk on your face.  There is
humor, but it's under the surface, and laughter comes only with the bleakest of insights.  This is a world where everything good is soiled or misunderstood, no matter how obsessive compulsively clean we try to be.

Any chance to watch Alec Guinness is a privilege.  He suits his role ideally.

It's definately not a 50s romp though comedy like Some Like It Hot, more of an intelligent satire with base entertainment value... something a little bit more lighthearted than Sunset Boulevard.",1089504000,,561,4.742268041237113
595971,4,6303209971,"The driven Sidney Stratton (Alec Guinness) bounces from job to job as he finds a way to sneak into each textile company's laboratory where he commences his own scientific investigations in regards to a new resistible fabric.  This fabric should be able to withstand almost anything and even repel dirt.  However, each time he gets close to finding the solution he must escape or is taken for a mad man.  Man in the White Suit is an interesting satire as it combines the Emperor's New Clothes with socio-economic issues in a modern setting.  This comedy is enhanced through Alec Guinness's character Stratton who is rather eccentric and absentminded as he performs with his usual brilliance, which leaves the audience with a wonderful cinematic experience.",1080691200,,755,5.064516129032258
595972,4,6303209971,"Putting together the information of the different reviews will give customers already a good idea about the plot of this very interesting movie. But I just wanted to add -I'm somewhat surprised that nobody made the comparison- that the sultry voice and some little feminine gestures of sensual Miss Joan Greenwood in this film bears quite some resemblance to Veronica Lake's. In fact, there was another thing that reminded me of a V.Lake/Alan Ladd movie: the character of the old boss of bosses of the textile industry somewhat resembles a catain pg industry, head of a dubious chemical plant in 'This gun for hire"" 10 years earlier.
I guess the choice of ""white"" for the new product is not a concidence, being the complete opposite of the ""black"" city and the black cars and suits of the bosses.",1069027200,2,796,4.77536231884058
595973,5,6303209971,"I recently purchased The Horse's Mouth (1958) from Amazon as well as ""The Alec Guinness Collection"" which includes The Man in the White Suit (1951) plus four others:  Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949), The Lavender Hill Mob (1951), The Captain's Paradise (1953), and The Ladykillers (1955). Frankly, I was amazed how well each of the six films has held up since I first saw it.
Directed by Alexander MacKendrick (who also directed The Ladykillers four years later), what we have in The Man in the White Suit is Guinness' own version of the naive, indeed eccentric visionary/inventor/humanitarian. Sidney Stratton's dream is to create a fabric which never wears out and cannot be soiled. Endless (sometimes explosive) experiments involving various gurgling contraptions prove unsuccessful. Meanwhile, Stratton is fired from his job in one research laboratory, continues his research in another, and eventually succeeds. Or so he thinks.
One of these film's several delights is Joan Greenwood's portrayal of Daphne Birnley, daughter of the owner of the company in whose laboratory Stratton finally discovers the correct formula for the miracle fabric. Her father is played with great style by Cecil Parker who is almost as eager to marry off his daughter as he is to save his company. Only a spoilsport would reveal the climax of this entertaining film, one which may surprise viewers as much as it does Stratton and Alan Birnley. Sadder but wiser, Stratton ambles (as only Guinness can) into an uncertain future. Nowhere else throughout the plot is the special soundtrack more effective than it is in this final scene.",1056585600,4,1615,5.16412213740458
595974,4,6303209971,"Since there is already an excellent plot synopsis, and good reviews, I have just a few comments. In selecting acting roles, Alec Guinness clearly felt that variety was the spice of life !
""The Man in the White Suit"" is a brilliant, but very eccentric scientist, and Guinness is of course terrific in the lead. As always, Cecil Parker is fine in support, and Joan Greenwood, with her breathy, seductive voice, is wonderful. As other reviewers have noted, watch for Ernest Thesiger as ""Sir John""--in just a few scenes he manages to convey pure evil and greed very convincingly.
While this film has humour, it is not quite a comedy in the usual sense. Its various themes and messages ring true even today. ""Planned obsolescence"" is as much a part of modern manufacturing as it has ever been. The possibility of a product that never wears out and will never need to be replaced is every big business' worst nightmare, and hardly good news for labour either. This comes across in the movie, and in 2003 I don't expect that the reaction would be any different. We have been hearing about engines that run on solar power or even water for years--guess how much ""big oil"" is going to let that happen ? !
The movie has a number of unforgettable scenes, including the climax where Guinness is cornered by the mob of workers and capitalists, united in their fear. The ending is as upbeat as one could expect, without compromising the seriousness of the theme.
The picture quality of the DVD is fine, especially for a 52-year old film.
If you like classic movies that are aimed at your brain, as well as your funny-bone, ""The Man in the White Suit"" fills the bill.",1052092800,18,1652,4.603389830508474
595975,5,6303209971,"Although Alec Guinness had already achieved a fair degree of fame on stage and on screen by the time he made THE MAN IN THE WHITE SUIT, this is, in fact, one of his earliest starring roles.  Strictly speaking, although he had portrayed eight characters in 1949's KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS, this was his first comedy in which is played the lead.  Playing inventor Sidney Stratton, Guinness further cemented his burgeoning reputation as one of England's most interesting and versatile actors.
The film features a marvelous though, to early 21st century film fans, largely unknown cast.  Joan Greenwood, who is one of my favorite actresses in the history of film--beautiful, effortlessly sexy and sensual, enormously talented, and possessed of one of the great voices in the history of cinema--plays Guinness's romantic counterfoil.  Cecil Parker, who while never a star, seemed to populate dozens of successful films without ever calling attention to himself.  The film also features a typical performance by Ernest Thesiger, who played ancient-old-man parts for over forty years in films and is one of the most unique looking actors in British film history.
The story involves a quirky scientist inventing cloth that never gets dirty and never wears out, but which comes out of the lab pure white.  This was at a time when a whole range of new synthetic fabrics were hitting the market, so the subject was very topical at the time.  The plot revolves around the anticipated effects such material would have on the textile industry.  The film is a comedy, but it is the kind of comedy that creates more smiles than laughs.  It is not less delightful for that.",1036022400,3,1656,4.971014492753623
595976,4,6303209971,"Alec Guinness plays another one of the oddball characters he often played in 1950's British films, this time as an inventor/scientist of a miracle fabric that will not wear out or get dirty.  It seems like a great idea to him and to the owner of the factory where he makes it, but then the economic reality of it becomes an issue.  What will happen to fabric manufacturers and the clothing industry if clothing doesn't wear out?  Will unions let that happen?  Trapped in the middle of all this turmoil is Guinness, glowing in his white suit.  He delivers yet another terrific performance, and is well supported by so many fine British character actors.  The film is well written, although I found the first fifteen minutes or so a little confusing.  The premise is great, and it makes you question whether there are a lot of potential products not being invented because of their long term effects on big business, regardless of their usefulness to the general public!",999302400,6,968,4.726190476190476

596121,5,6303209971,"Not all of the old Ealing comedies were good, but this one is topnotch.  Using the same concept as was presented in Ayn Rand's ""The Fountainhead"", an eccentric inventor has come up with a supposedly indestructible thread which can be sewn into indestructible cloth, and he has even made up a white suit with said cloth which he wears through most of the film.

He goes to a major clothing manufacturer with this idea, only for the man to want to suppress this invention, as making indestructible cloth would put all the clothing manufacturers out of business.  He offers the inventor substantial monetary bribes, his daughter tries to charm him...but the inventor is aware of the manufacturer's intentions and refuses to yield.

But it is not only the big bosses who fear this new cloth.  The workers in the clothing factory, fearing for their livelihoods, also want the invention suppressed, and do so by chasing after the inventor.  Can he escape?

596123,5,6303209971,"Produced at the time of the Festival of Britain, a period when Britain was trying to show itself in its most positive light, THE MAN IN THE WHITE SUIT offers a gentle, if pointed corrective. Sidney Stratton's (Alec Guinness') wonderful invention of a suit that never needs washing, and never wears out, threatens the entire future of the British cotton industry and needs to be suppressed.  For perhaps the first - and only time - the mill-owners, led by Cecil Parker's Mr. Birnley and Ernest Thesiger's hawk-like Sir John, unite with the workers to frustrate Stratton's plans of success and hence ensure that ""the delicate balance of interests"" (i.e. the industrial status quo) is maintained.  The fact that the cotton industry no longer really exists in Britain is one of the ironies of history; it was chiefly due to an ostrich-like reluctance to change that Britain was overtaken by other countries in Asia.  As Parker's narrator accurately foretells right at the end of the film, the Sidney Strattons of this world did achieve what they wanted in the end.  Alexander Mackendrick's film is tightly structured with some memorable cinematography by Douglas Slocombe; there are at least two aerial shots of the mill-owners and Sir John gathered in one room, where they resemble predatory beasts ganging up on the luckless Sidney.  The chase-sequences are also cleverly handled, with several shots of Sidney's pursuers running down corridors or darkened alleyways.  Benjamin Frankel's music, with its memorable theme of the bubbling of Sidney's scientific experiments, reminds us of just how successful and threatening human endeavors can be.  Mackendrick also gets some memorable character-vignettes out of Parker - never better in his customary role as a bumbling yet pompous industrialist, Thesiger (screaming ""wait for me!"" as he relishes the prospect of chasing Sidney, and is bundled into a worker's car), and Joan Greenwood, reprising her role as an incredibly polite yet potent predator from KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS (1949).  In the central role, Guinness is remarkably active; his obsessiveness manifesting itself in his increasingly unkempt appearance, that contrasts with his appearance at the end, when the suit has been torn off him.  In his undershirt and pants, he resembles a dying swan.  THE MAN IN THE WHITE SUIT is, as with all Ealing comedies, a small-scale film, but one that befits repeated viewings in order to understand its quiet subtleties.  A classic.",1398470400,,2478,5.201005025125628

596168,5,6303209971,"The Man In The White Suit (1951) is the opposite of the video-game explosion movies.

What a wonderful movie, eligible for so many labels it never gets: Science fiction, film-noir, with a script and dialog of high intelligence which assumes an educated, cultured audience.....the kind of English language movie only done in pre-1960 England (and shown only in USA art movie houses when it first arrived), and never, ever done in the USA.

Main characters in The Man In The White Suit(1951) starring Sir Alec Guiness and Joan Greenwood routinely use polysyllabic, science reference words like ""polymer"" and discuss and explain concepts of chemistry like ""long chain molecules"" and then communicate the importance of these to the average man and the benefits science provides him.

The Man In The White Suit (1951) is the opposite of the video-game explosion movies which now (2009) dominate world cinema, and certainly dominate major USA cinema.......it's a carefully acted, intelligently told story delivered by gifted and believable educated English actors (who play educated, accomplished people), and it's all done with comedy, charm, pathos, and sense of irony which ancient Greek dramatists would have approved of.

Everybody should see this movie, and someday, somehow, some worthy filmmaker and his supporters should make another like it.

It's wonderful.

BTW, the director of this movie, Alexander MacKendrick, quite young in 1952, went onto become a Hollywood USA movie director and after that had a 30 year career at the Walt Disney estate endowed ""Pacific Arts Institute"" teaching film and especially screenwriting.  Notes for his lectures there were compiled into a book after his death, and the book (I can't remember the exact title, but it's easy to find) became one of the best and most important ""how to write a screenplay"" efforts ever published, and one of the most popular as well.

MacKendrick's main idea is that ""movies must move,"" and therefore screenplay writers must always pay attention to, and answer, the question of ""what's the next thing?""  Sean Connery, a fellow Scot along with MacKendrick, is quoted as stating that Mackenrick's book is the most valuable ever written to guide filmmakers.

What is most interesting about The Man in the White Suit is that characters on both sides of this story are all ""sympathetic"" and make a good, understandable case for their situation. Who does suffer here is the class system that would deny a general benefit in order to maintain the system, itself. It's that selfishness that looks the most ridiculous here.

Despite the fact that this is a British film, skewering that well-defined class system, all this satire is equally applicable to any group. We claim to want to ""save the environment,"" but what would happen if someone invented, today, a car that ran on tap water?

596207,5,6303209971,"The Man in the White Suit seems to me to be partially a satire on Ayn Rand's the Fountainhead.  Alec Guinness plays Sidney Stratton deadpan in the role of the lone, mad scientist of the British clothing industry.  Stratton is on a mission to create a new fabric that never gets dirty and never wears out.  His bizarre quest gets him fired from one after another jobs as a scientist  as he diverts (or as the British would say, cadges) equipment and supplies from companies to his projects.  He then works as a janitor still cadging supplies and hiding his experiments until he is discovered and promoted by the daughter (Joan Greenwood) of one of the captains of industry.

After he is promoted, he is given full support for his bizarre idea. Then, another of the elements of satire is the mad scientist of the horror films of the late 40's, with suitable lights flashing, ""boops....beeps""  and water gurgling sound effects, and a few explosions of the works.

This leads to curiosity...what is he up to?  Then, word leaks out that he is working on a cloth that never gets dirty and never wears out.  At first it sounds like a good idea but soon the Schumpeterian creative destruction implications of this invention for jobs, businesses, and industries, becomes clear to the industry leaders, the unions, and the ordinary workers.

There is a strong management vs. workers message here (although not to the extent of ""I'm All Right Jack""). The industrial ""closing of ranks when threatened"" works well, but the film suffers from a rather contrived ending which leaves the viewer rather frustrated (we want Sidney to succeed, despite the consequences!). The white suit also looks rather odd in the greyness of Britain in the 1950's (but maybe that was the point). Although there are some funny and entertaining moments, this is a second-rank Ealing offering.",1190419200,2,761,5.195121951219512

596210,5,6303209971,"One of the snappier satires to emerge from Britain's Ealing Studios in the 1950s, Mackendrick's wry, wonderful ""White Suit"" is built around the expressive comic performance of Guinness, playing a dreamy, obsessive chemist without the means (or the elite credentials) to fund his pet project. Greenwood, always a fine mix of dotty and genteel, is a lovely, airy presence as Sidney's champion, and the cast of eccentric Ealing character actors (like wheezing elder Ernest Thesiger) is top notch as well. Mackendrick slyly incorporates a bit of political commentary into this seemingly frivolous farce, poking fun at the machinations of industrial tycoons and union activists alike. Buoyant and funny, this ""White Suit"" wears exceedingly well.",1182816000,,740,5.5
596211,4,6303209971,"This is a fantastic, allegorical Ealing Studios ""comedy."" I put quotes on comedy because to me this is more of a dramatic film or maybe an ironic comedy, one particularly suspenseful at times.

Alec Guiness is terrific as usual as Sidney Stratton, a rogue scientist who goes from research lab to research lab at local textile mills, building and testing his experiments until he gets found out and fired. Eventually, after a great scene-one of several-in which Stratton's passion and determination prove both volatile and destructive, not to mention frightening (to the genteel prim English manner), he is given a chance.

Though not immediately successful, his chemistry proves exactly what he desired, a fabric that repels water and dirt, and will never wear down. Though it does illuminate at night, a nuclear allusion that elevates the allegorical nature of the film. To read into this a picture of a unconscionable maverick works, especially considering this was made just six years after Horoshima and Nagasaki.

But in this day and age I also sympathized with Stratton's determination to revolutionize. Representing progress his invention is a threat to the status quo, and the elite, whose authority partly rests upon the assumption of a demand for what they produce. But not only does capital fear him, labor worries for their own existence. A fabric that never breaks down means no jobs.

This dynamic is present today in myriad forms. Whether in our own class system, or industry, progress is begrudged even while it is celebrated. A reformation of paraigm means instability. But would we have more electric/alternative fuel cars, greater solar and wind generation, or more advanced medicines if those who rule such fields didn't seek to maintain their own status as much as they support progress?

A rogue throughout, Sidney Stratton is so myopic to his work that it's effects never exist to him. Such tenacity and fire makes for brilliance as well as destruction. Rock musicians who burn bright but flame out early come to mind. The way of the world must be progress, but progress with a conscience.",1166572800,2,2112,5.057471264367816
596212,5,6303209971,"Yet another madcap Ealing comedy starring Alec Guinness as a scientist who invents a fabric that won't soil or wear out. Realizing that such a fabric would spell ruin for the whole textile industry, the company wants Guinness to sign over the invention to them so they can suppress it. He, of course, wants it known to the whole world: it's his ticket to fame.

Quite a tug-of-war develops between Guinness and the government henchmen involving chases, bribery, kidnapping, and other lunacies. But it all comes to naught when the lasting qualities of the fabric prove to be defective. Guinness is wonderful and the script is taut and hilarious. It's a neat little black comedy on industrialism vs. the entrepeneur. From that devilish smile on Guinness's face at the end, it looks like the battle goes on. Terrific fun; definitely worth a watch.",1132963200,8,844,4.9020979020979025
596213,5,6303209971,"Just a note--I can't find as anyone's caught this. The soundtrack for this film is by Benjamin Frankel, a serious British composer whose symphonies are highly regarded, and is one of the best film scores Ive encountered in some time. In fact I'm surprised it isn't better known as it approaches the quality Sir William Walton reached in his Shakespeare scores for Olivier. I'd buy this DVD just for the music.

Otherwise this is an absolutely wonderful flick and, as an exercise in humorous cynicism about how the modern world operates I'd double-bill it with Wilder's absurdly under-rated ""One, Two, Three.""",1127001600,4,608,5.01980198019802
596214,4,6303209971,"The Man in the White Suit focusses on the destructive aspects of all new inventions.  Although Joseph Schumpeter's name is never mentioned, his creative destruction concept pervades the story line.  Sidney Stratton (Alec Guinness ) a non-credentialled and eccentric scientist  who creates a new cloth that apparently will not wear out nor get dirty.  The overall human community will enormously benefit---but what about those people who earn a living in the impacted industry?  Try imagining the  horse and buggy industry upon hearing about the automobile.  The progeny of Ned Ludd are enraged and correctly fearful of losing their jobs. Sidney's invention will indeed help the vast majority of human beings to live a better life.  However, he also truly jeopardizes the economic status of those around him.  How is Sidney to respond to such a dilemma?

Sidney's trials and tribulations are turned into a mildly humorous fable.  He is bewildered by the perception that he has turned into a class enemy.  Former friends have turned against him.  Even owners of the garment industry are out to crush the new invention.  Only the boss's daughter Daphne (Joan Greenwood) remains supportive.  Can it get any worse?  This is not the greatest comedy ever made.  Still, it earns four stars and a few hours of your time.  Those who enjoyed Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead will not be disappointed.",1122163200,4,1384,5.075555555555556
596215,5,6303209971,"Proof once again that the Brits make the best films.  This film would never be made in America.  Its blend of social satire, comedy, political comment, and underlying seriousness, makes this film unique.  That someone could call this film ""frothy"" is incomprehensible to me.  It is a deft satire with a serious message, without ever seeming serious. The film makes you think while it is entertaining you.  Guiness is superb as the brilliant, but clueless, scientist who invents a fabric that never gets dirty and never wears out.  Seems great, doesn't it.  But a worker at the plant where Sidney (Guinness) works sees what he doesn't: that they will only have to make one lot. So labor turns against the idea, and of course, management wants to suppress it (in favor of planned obsolescence).

It is all delicious fun all the way, all the while making you think about modern, consumer-driven economies.  The cast is composed of Ealing regulars, all of whom turn in top notch performances.  This is one of the all time great films.  Don't miss it.",1101600000,5,1046,4.787709497206704

Comic mayhem ensues when a consortium of industrialists and fabric workers get wind of the invention and protest mightily.  Guiness is effectively low-key and earnest in his portrayal of the inventor.  This film probably had more resonance with British audiences in the wake of the post-war economic situation there.  This is a welcome addition to anyone's collection but it falls short of greatness.
