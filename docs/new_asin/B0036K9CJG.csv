8390075,3,B0036K9CJG,"This is a really good movie, but that is not what this review is about. In the product description the movie is listed as being widescreen 1.85:1. This is not the case, the movie is presented in full screen 1.33:1. Also, the listing describes the studio that released the DVD as Gaiam Entertainment but this is a different pressing by Echo Bridge Entertainment. I have had bad experiences with Echo Bridge in the past due to their lack of quality control. Had the listing been correct I may not have purchased the disc. Beware. Somebody at Amazon needs to change the listing.",1338681600,2,575,4.647058823529412
8390076,5,B0036K9CJG,"not a video for the kids tho a highly controversial topic set to a family theme, an dark humor.  Great acting, wonderful cast, excellent story.  if you are a fan of Weeds at all this is a must have.",1290384000,3,198,4.051282051282051
