188602,5,1572522178,"For cinema buffs, this film is probably Andre Techine's best (although `Thieves' comes close).  Released in 1994, the movie won four Cesar Awards, including Best Picture.
 That said, it's a great film anyway!  Techine incredibly evokes--and captures--the landscape and atmosphere, the  tonal integrity, the dynamic symmetry of the French countryside, his  actors, and time sequence in a way that few can.  Certainly, this film is a  tribute to film-making, regardless of nationality.
 Set in 1962 when  all France was abuzz and alerted to the Algerian war and crisis, Techine  micromanages the time/place/conflict into a boarding school setting.  And  while, indeed, it is a ""coming of age"" story in good form, cinema as art is  not lost on Techine (nor generally the French!).
 Featuring praiseworthy  performances of Iodie Bouchez and Gael Morel, the film dwells on, but not  exclusively, their relationship--which is not without its trauma, drama,  and poignancy.  The two boys
acknowledge their deep-rooted relationship,  which is beauty itself.  Unfortunately, love does not conquer all, as the  romanticists would have us believe (and the vicious politics of the time  rears its ugly head too often).  Clearly, Techine's juxtaposition of their  relationship--sexual and otherwise--is beautifully and sensitively done.  The soundtrack, too, is worthy of praise (even the American pop music lends  to the film's credence).  Viva la France.  And Techine.

188603,5,1572522178,"This enagaging coming-of-age French movie revolves round a sort of unrequited/forbidden love triangle (or quadrangle?) between four adolescents at boarding school in southwest France.  This 1994 multi-Cesar  Awards winner made stars of its talented young cast, notably the two cute  lead actors, Elodie Bouchez and Gael Morel.  Who, like their characters  here, are good friends also in real life and have worked together on a  number of movies since.  For me, the intimate-yet-platonic relationship as  ""best friends"" Francois and Maite is really frustrating. As in my  opinion they make such a cute couple. (Luckily, Gael and Elodie make amends  for this by jumping into bed together in ""Le Plus Bel Age"", the  film they acted in together after this one.)  Anyway, by the end of this  movie, you feel like you have grown up a little bit with these young  teenagers, and a sense that their innocent age has passed by.  The  soundtrack is also nice, with Johann Strauss's Voices of Spring waltz,  Barber's Adagio for Strings and some well-known 1960s American pop music.  And thank goodness this video keeps the original French language  soundtrack, especially as subtleties and expression of dialogue always get  lost in translation.",959299200,37,1234,5.16751269035533
188604,4,1572522178,"For non French speaking viewers who would like to purchase this DVD, let me warn you that it is a French movie in audio with English subtitles.  Regardless of this drawback, the movie is beautiful in its entirety.  The  focus on Wild Reeds is a young man's ambivalence of his sexuality who  resembles the movie's main title.  Wild Reeds is a clean story of a young  man's homosexual desires with a French Algerian which I think in those  times is difficult.  But the interaction of inner thoughts and strong  feelings among the characters of the movie is very enjoyable.  Wild Reeds  is not about love, but a close friendship that builds through one's  discovery and acceptance of oneself.  The movie is a bit boring, quiet and  slow when characters are not exchanging dialogue.  But the English  subtitles keeps you alert.  Regardless of the past customer reviews, I gave  Wild Reeds 4 stars.",925776000,8,893,4.7631578947368425

188647,4,1572522178,"The slightly loose and episodic feel of this charming coming-of-ager doesn't matter because the characters and the conflicts are so well presented that we are enthralled throughout.
Three boys on the verge of manhood (with the French-Algerian conflict smoldering in the background) are in residence at a boarding school in the south of France in 1962.  One is gay, the second is bi-sexual and the third is straight.  Through their interactions we (and they) discover their sexuality.
Francois Forestier, played attractively by Gael Morel, is gay as he discovers one night when Serge Bartolo (Stephane Rideau), an athletic schoolmate with a natural style, awakens his sexuality by seducing him.  For Serge it is just a school age sexual adventure; for Francois it is love so intense he is transformed.  The third boy, Henri Mariana, who is from Algeria, is a little older and a little more cynical.  He finds heterosexual love with his enemy, Mait Alverez, who is a hated communist.  Elodie Bouchez, whom I recall from The Dreamlife of Angels (1998) for which she shared a Cannes Best Actress award, plays Mait whose style is earnest, witty and brave.
As it happens I was in France during the period of this film, and a teenager as well.  The Algerian conflict haunted the young men because as soon as they were of age they could be sent away to fight.  Also the Communist Party was strong in France and an attraction to some who opposed what they saw as French colonialism in Algeria and Vietnam.  Director Andr Tchin who characteristically explores human sexuality in his films (e.g., Rendez-Vous (1985) with a young and vital Juliette Binoche; Le lieu du crime (1986) with Catherine Deneuve; and Ma Saison Prfre (1993) also starring Catherine Deneuve) attempts to integrate these larger issues into his film but I don't think is entirely successful.  Serge's older brother is killed in Algeria and his teacher blames herself for not helping him to escape his military service and suffers a nervous breakdown.  However this story is not well-connected with the rest of the film.  Also more could have been done with the divergent views of Mait and Henri.  What I loved was the club scene where suddenly the French girls are twisting to Chubby Checker's ""Let's Twist Again"" which propelled me back to 1962 when indeed the Twist was all the rage in France.
What makes this film superior is the warm and truthful way in which the sexual awakenings are realized.  The kids seem absolutely real and the dialogue is sharp and authentic.  Morel is very winning.  I especially liked the earnest way he confronts and then accepts his sexuality.  Interesting was the scene in which he seeks out the shoe salesman whom he knows is gay for his advice on how he should cope with unrequited homosexual love.
This is a film about young people for open-minded adults attractively done.  For many it will strike a strong cord of recognition.",1053993600,39,2925,4.874747474747474
188648,3,1572522178,"A great find if you're seeking an angst ridden drama about gay boys coming of age...

188651,5,1572522178,"Wild Reeds is a nice movie portraying adolescence and sexuality during a time of difficult politics in France during the early nineteen sixties.  Francious(Gael Morel)is the lead character along with his platonic girlfriend Maite (Elodie Bouchez).  The two are best friends, but Francious starts experimenting and coming to terms with his sexulaity when he comes to having sexual feelings for his classmate Serge (Stephane Rideau). This is basically the plot of the film with Francious yearning to be in a realtionship with Serge and dealing with the complications from his realtion with Maite.  A typical French movie Wild Reeds is not a tawdry, action packed, sexually explicit film.  It is a simple story of teenagers exploring sexuality through a rather difficult time.  The cast is good and for those that are in to cute young men will find the two male leads appealing and sexy in the scenes where they are half dressed.

188654,3,1572522178,"*WARNING: THIS REVIEW REVEALS KEY ELEMENTS OF THE PLOT.*
No, kiddies,  this is not your typical love triangle story. In fact, it's not a love  triangle at all. It's a love square! At the center is Franois, an  ""immature, bourgeois faggot."" Franois is a teenager coming to  terms with his sexuality, discovering that he is attracted to boys. But  when he sleeps with Serge, that complicates his relationship with Mat,  his ""girlfriend that hates boys."" Serge, on the other hand, is  sure he is heterosexual and is attracted to Mat. She rejects him just as  he rejects the affection of Franois. Now, enter Henri. Henri is a French  Algerian, whose political views clash vehemently with the communism of  Mat and her mother, the teacher of all the boys. In one scene early in  the movie, Franois remarks to Serge (before they really know each other)  that they are too dissimilar to be friends. But the reality is that Mat  and Henri are the unlikely couple. Yet they are the ones who consumate  their relationship in the end. This film shows us the intricacies and  complexities of attraction, gay and straight, male and female, left-wing or  right-wing. Yet the plot leaves us wanting more. It's worth viewing, but if  there's something else you would rather see first, this one can wait.",969321600,10,1287,4.777272727272727

7797538,4,1572522178,"In the past, director Andr Tchin has relentlessly pursued complex subjects. His films don't pander to the audience, nor do they allow the public to be emotionally detached. In ""Les Tmoins"", for instance, AIDS is understood not as a simple disease but as something that profoundly alters social discourse and human interaction.

In ""Les Roseaux Sauvages"" there is an immanent bellicosity among France and Algeria which lingers on in the background long enough to affect the protagonists. At the beginning of the film a wedding becomes the scenario in which we observe Serge's brother clumsily plotting how to desert from French troops, while Franois is idly chatting with Mat, a girl he doesn't love but dates nonetheless. The war strongly infiltrates the world of these youngsters, as a new student arrives to the boarding school attended by Serge (interpreted by Stphane Rideau in what would be the first of many gay related productions) and Franois (interpreted by Gal Morel, director of several films of gay interest), an older boy named Henri that has experienced the aftermaths of the armed conflict in the flesh.

After a couple of visits Serge pays to Franois in the middle of the night, the two boys soon become friends, but not before sharing some intimate secrets and practicing mutual masturbation and sexual intercourse. Of course, for Serge this one night stand is the product of revolting hormones and teenage horniness, but for Franois this moment changes everything: he will come forward to Mat and from that moment, what at first seemed a typical high school relationship, is utterly modified.

It's not long before Henri finds out, quite easily, about the sexual escapades of the two boys, but seems preoccupied only with the development of the war. Henri is unable to come through a normal grieving process regarding his father and the Algerian reality. The need for a symbolic death becomes patently necessary for Henri. Jacques Lacan defined the symbolic death as a narrative of closure, as the final sentence one must utter in order to let the dead ones go. If every culture in the planet respects some sort of funerary rites it is precisely because of that. The real death comes naturally when a heart stops beating, but the symbolic death is something cultural, something that depends on any given individual and the ability to cope with loss. Coming to terms with death means to be able to write that epitaph in our head, to be able to understand someone else's life and then to let go of it.

Serge, on the contrary, will eventually accept the casualties of war, and instead of being paralyzed by death he will keep moving on. When Mat's mother suffers a psychological breakdown after hearing about the demise of one of her students, her daughter feels devastated. None of this matters to Franois who's having a hard time understanding his own sexuality. A most relevant moment takes place when he confronts his image in the mirror and starts repeating ""Je suis pd"", ashamed of being gay. This degrading word will lead to the reformulation of the object of desire, according to new terms and surpassing the phallic response; Franois's desire will be inextricably linked to the question of the desire of the other in its ethical dimension insofar as it bears the possibility of alterity, of authentic otherness. Of course it's never easy to be young and gay, but it's even more difficult in an isolated French province in the early 60s. It is then that Mat's emotional support proves to be fundamental for Franois, as he will comprehend that his initial object of desire may well be out of his reach.

The characters of the film adopt contrasting postures. Serge and Franois possess an adaptability and flexibility that will become indispensable. Henri and Mat, however, are determined and stubborn individuals. Henri's teacher tries to make him understand that being strong like an oak is a disadvantage as oaks break when the storm comes, only reeds survive the storm because they bend but do not break. Drawing a divisor line between war and sexuality, Tchin finally gathers the three boys and the girl in one final sequence that instead of focusing on the clich of hope is centered on the pervasive reiteration of uncertainty and friendship.",1318723200,3,4270,4.9415041782729805

7797540,5,1572522178,"Take four sexually charged teenagers and drop them in a steaming pot of cultural and political upheaval and you have yourselves a profound depiction of adolescence in director Andre Techine's beautiful `Les Roseaux Sauvages'.  The film is a stunning example of raw and earnest acting, subtle yet honest storytelling and beautiful and intoxicating direction.  The film sweeps over you with an awareness of self and complete control of its statements.

Can you say ""moving""?

The basic `love square' is quite simple.  Maite and Francois have been friends for some time and it is just assumed that they will one day become an item.  They love one another, but Francois is finding his desires drifting towards Serge, an Italian schoolmate who returns his affections once and sets Francois off on a desperate attempt to `court' Serge (sort of).  Serge, on the other hand, has dismissed his encounter with Francois and has moved in on Maite.  He becomes enamored with her beauty and grace and charm and wants to be with her, despite Francois feelings on the matter.  Henri, an outsider of sorts, challenges the trio's political views as well as their emotions as he warms up to Francois (in peculiar ways) and roots himself in Maite's heart.

Got all that?

But there is more.  The film, while focused on the relationships between these four, also elaborates on their emotional crisis by incorporating a very real and very scary threat of war and their political responsibilities.  With the Algerian conflict looming over their heads, these young men (especially) find themselves weighted down by far more than puberty.

Here is the thing; `Les Roseaux Sauvages' could have easily become messy, confusing and even generic or clichd, but the rich textures in each character and the flawless way the actors embody the soul of their character's just elevates this film so high in my opinion.

Gael Morel plays Francois, the films protagonist (if there really is one).  The film does seem centered on his emotional development, but the nice thing about this movie is that it doesn't sacrifice developing the other characters to benefit Francois's character.  Morel carries the film very well, giving his character the needed amount of adolescent confusion but infusing more of a kind spirited need for self-discovery.  His character has the most difficult transition (understanding his homoerotic tendencies) and so his character needs to be handled with the delicacy yet raw honesty that Morel embodies beautifully.  Stephane Rideau probably delivers the films finest performance, really getting inside the rough exterior that protects Serge from his personal life.  He goes through the motions (sexual experimentation, family struggles, death of a loved one, loyalties, rejection) and he plugs through with a believable and relatable spirit.  You can see yourself in Serge.  Frederic Gorny plays Henri, the most ambiguous and probably the most crucial character in the group.  His actions throughout, but especially in the end, shape the outcome for the entire party and help establish the films central themes (of awakening, understanding, and maturity).  His performance feels almost secondary, because his character is an enigma of sorts, but it is also the most haunting because it is the one you will think of most afterward.

And then we have Elodie Bouchez, the stunning beauty who plays Maite.  Her performance is soft and delicate yet deeply poignant.  Her final moments, especially with Gorny, are sincere and completely stripped of all gimmick or clich, left open and supple for the audience to really engage with her.  She reminded me of Pell James, who delivered an equally natural and stunning performance in `The King' (although that film is far from the greatness that `Les Roseaux Sauvages' is).

This is such a beautiful ensemble.

I have read the complaints and detractors for this film and I simply don't get them (and to the person who complained because he `hated subtitles', all I have to say is that your ignorance will cost you a great deal).  I see nothing but purity when I watch this film.  It is heartfelt and genuine and a film that I will not soon forget.",1260230400,4,4178,5.071742313323573
7797541,5,1572522178,"Andr Tchin's 1994 film about four students in Southern France during the Algerian War is one of the most brilliantly written coming-of-age films ever made. Studying for the baccalaurat, the famously difficult post-secondary education qualifying degree, the four students find themselves becoming emotionally and sexually involved with one another as they try to figure out just who they are and where to go in the next stage in their lives. They constantly position themselves and one another according to many standard markers of identity imposed by their social system--class, sexuality, politics, and intelligence--but they find these labels cannot do adequate justice to who they are and what they want for themselves. The articulate Franois (Gal Morel) spends most of his time with Mat (lodie Bouchez), the daughter of his ardent communist and feminist literature teacher; although he tells Mat he has slept in his dormitory with the athletic brooding Serge (Stphane Rideau), she is happy to date him anyway because of her own anxieties about sex and men. Meanwhile, the older and disillusioned Algerian Henri, bitter at his father's death at the hands of liberationists, circles the group warily, cynically commenting on Franois's crush on Serge but longing for connection himself.

For a film as intelligent as this to work the characters must all be truly original--unable to be boxed as ""working class"" or ""bourgeois,"" ""intelligent"" or ""dumb,"" ""fascist"" or ""socialist,"" ""straight"" or ""gay""--, and the acting of the young people must be at the same complex high level. Fortunately, it succeeds brilliantly in both regards. It takes you a whole to figure out who is who, but once you do the film becomes genuinely absorbing and poignant. You steel yourselves for the disappointments and loneliness the students must endure, and the cruelties they enact on one another; when two of them embrace near the film's end, you feel incredibly relieved that their defenses can be broken down and that they can express their love and longing with one another, even if fleetingly.",1236988800,3,2076,5.2342342342342345

Although WILD REEDS is not a gay film, it does have one gay character who has a couple of classmates who seem to be either bisexual or open to experimentation. The four adolescent leads in this movie are struggling with their sense of being an outsider, which seems to be a universal for boys and girls, straights and gays alike. At the same time that they are trying to come to terms with their sexual natures, they are developing a sense of their place in the world. Each of them is affected by the political issues of their day (the war in Algeria), the struggle against authoritarian school teachers, and the expectations of their families. What I found appealing about the way the characters were portrayed and developed is that each one seems to receive equal treatment, has an equal share of grief and confusion, and is equally susceptible to normal human foibles. To wish that the story lines were more resolved at the end of the film would be to ask that this thoughtful little movie be something it was not meant to be--a splashy, big-budget Hollywood film totally ungrounded in human reality.",1079308800,14,1276,4.6755555555555555
