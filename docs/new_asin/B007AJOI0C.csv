5072317,5,B007AJOI0C,"If you've never watched, the Disney Channel animated hit Phineas and Ferb, you're missing some inspired cartoon fun, expertly dished up. Speaking analytically, each half hour show generally consists of two story self-contained segments, each with two or more original (and very eclectic) songs.

Each segment has at least three story angles: brothers Phineas and Ferb come up with a very elaborate idea/enterprise/invention and their sister, Candace, is the ""Mrs. Kravitz"" who tries to expose them, while at the same time their pet playtpus, Perry, gets a mission to save the world in his secret identity as ""Agent P"" to thwart evil but feeble Dr. Hans Doofensmirtz's plan to conquer the world (and/or the tri-state area).

That's a lot to get into a short cartoon, but with the kind of wit, savvy and pacing that made Rocky and Bullwinkle a classic, the creative team does it amazingly well -- tying the subplots together in either cleverly surprising or knowingly coincidental way.

The new DVD, The Perry Files, is a collection of seven show episodes -- so fourteen individual cartoons in all -- that best showcase the adventures of Agent P. My favorite is called ""Misperceived Monotreme,"" which is highlighted by a Yellow Submarine-like surreal sequence with more inventive touches than some TV shows have in an entire season.

I would have liked another fun documentary or a commentary in the bonus features, but there is a nice ""Tour Inside the Playbus"" and a collection of clips called ""Nerves of Teal.""

Inside the DVD package is a neat little ""Activity Pack"" containing character stickers with a background scene, a postcard, a ""find the clues"" card, mood magnets and even a 48-piece mini jigsaw puzzle! There's also a digital copy so you can watch on your mobile device.",1340236800,3,1780,5.0
5072318,4,B007AJOI0C,"Disney's ""Phineas and Ferb"" is one of those animated shows that immediately caught on with not only children, but teens and parents. As an adult watching the show, much of the attraction is due to the adventures of Perry the Platypus as he battles Dr. Doofenshmirtz. Fans of all ages can now enjoy the character's antics whenever they want with the DVD release of ""Phineas and Ferb: The Perry Files.""

The "" Phineas and Ferb: The Perry Files"" Two-Disc Combo Pack will provide hours of fun for the kids and you. If you're trying to get a little time to yourself, Perry never fails to keep the young ones entertained. It's also a show that won't leave older viewers attempting to gouge their eyes out like they want to while watching other annoying animated shows.",1339632000,,762,4.644444444444445
5072319,5,B007AJOI0C,"Phineas and Ferb is one of the few shows that can be enjoyed by kids and adults.

As a fan of the show, and of Perry (We even have a fish named Perry because of this show), this brought a lot of smiles on mine and my girls' faces being able to watch this and share the experiences with Perry yet again! I also liked that Disney also provided a Digital DVD that can easily be used on the road as this is always a positive thing for my girls as well.

5072395,5,B007AJOI0C,"My two youngest daughters discovered P&F a few months ago, which mean I did, too. And while they like the step-duo a lot, they are both absolutely little girl crazy about Perry the Platypus. Casting a jaundiced, grown-up eye over the landscape, I understand why. This is a very funny show. For adults, too.

This collection is a very strong sampling of the series. The name is slightly misleading - all (or nearly) episodes in the series feature PtP in their sub-plots. These are not special, Perry-oriented episodes, but it is a good over view of the show with some very funny bits.

My girls are young enough that some of the in-jokes and references go over their heads, but then that is part of what makes them fun for the moms and dads. The songs are really a hoot, the plots wind themselves into coils and then unwind nicely, and while there is a good deal to laugh at for adults, the show is in no way inappropriate for your kids. If they are younger than 4, the probably won't get much out of it, but even at that, there is nothing particularly offensive here. (One kid says ""butt"" one time - you decide if your kid can live with that. Mine can.) And waht's more - a good deal of the humor is verbal, which makes it especially refreshing.

If you are a P&F newby, as I was, this is a very good place to start. A nice selection of episodes giving you a great over view. You'll laugh with your kids- what's better than that?",1352678400,,1429,4.324626865671642

5072397,5,B007AJOI0C,"I can't stand the majority of today's cartoons, but Phineas and Ferb is an exception due to the creative writing behind the show. Typically, each episode has two segments, and each segment is split between Phineas/Ferb/Candace and Perry!

Phineas and Ferb are usually funny because of their nerdy irony and super awesome ideas, but I do not like watching the same thing over and over again, even a genius cartoon like Phineas and Ferb.
