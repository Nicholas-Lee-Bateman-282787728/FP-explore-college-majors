5071094,5,B007A12FWI,"I've long known about the controversy surrounding the release of the film Life of Brian, but this dramatization of those events brought the history of it to life in an amazingly entertaining way. The filmmakers relate the tale in a way that is highly evocative of the style of Python, and make great use of it. A few of the actors stepping into the roles of the members of the Python troupe aren't perfect... but the actors playing the most important two as far as this tale goes, Palin and Cleese, are downright uncanny in the roles!

There are a few fun bonus features included as well, but it might have been nice to have a bit more. Perhaps some interviews with the Pythons, reminiscing about the controversy with the perspective of the passage of time, or commenting on how they were portrayed in this film? Or at least including the actual footage of the talk show appearance that formed the climax of this film! (I sought it out on Youtube after watching this film, and would encourage everyone who watches this film to do the same. The condensed version of the show as appears in this movie is what was needed for the narrative, but seeing the whole thing is to see an epic win for intelligence over blind prosecution!)

Recommended for all Python fans, or for people who may be interested in a tale of artists winning out over those who would censor ""offensive"" works without first checking to see if the assumed offence was actually present.",1383436800,,1451,4.598455598455598
5071095,4,B007A12FWI,Just GREAT. IT BROUGHT BACK MANY HAPPY MEMORIES OF MY PAST. I  suggest you get a copy and enjoy the trip of the Holy Flying Circus in (Blu-ray),1382227200,,143,4.107142857142857
5071096,4,B007A12FWI,"If you're a huge Python fan like I am, you will not be disappointed by this movie. Hilarious and very well done - and all the casting (save for one person, I'll let you guess who it is) is spot on. A must watch. :)",1360713600,,214,3.7777777777777777
5071097,5,B007A12FWI,"As a committed Python fan I was really looking forward to viewing this DVD and I was not disappointed. It covers the period immediately after The Life of Brian was released. Today this film is rightly considered one of the masterpieces of comic cinema. However, at the time it caused an enormous furore. There were demonstrations, heated exchanges in the Houses of Parliament, Bishops denouncing it from their pulpits and numerous councils using their powers to ban the showing of the film in their areas.

The presentation is quite Pythonesque. The intro could be straight out of one of the episodes and the cut outs are very skillfully put together. The action is punctuated regularly by cartoon type interludes and dream sequences from the mind of Michael Palin which again could have been lifted straight out of Monty Python. The crew of Monty Python sound and behave closely to what one would have expected whilst John Cleese and Michael Palin do look extremely similar to their real life counterparts provided you do not look too closely!

The story builds up to a UK chat show, Friday Night Saturday Morning, which Cleese and Palin are eventually persuaded to appear on since, by that time, the aggravation over the film has reached such a crescendo that there seems nothing to lose. In the other corner are the late Malcolm Muggeridge, a media figure who was a leading campaigner for morals and the Bishop of Southwark. These characters are bombastic, bullying and, although they manage to effectively shout down the Python boys, show themselves up for what they are.

I thoroughly enjoyed this film, but I do have the right background, in that I have enjoyed The Life of Brian many times and seen the Monty Python episodes over and over. Whilst it is certainly Five Star material for me, I quite understand that anyone seeing this without the grounding in Monty Python would be left somewhat bemused and would probably give it quite a low rating.",1330646400,11,1955,4.847305389221557
5071098,4,B007A12FWI,"I luckily ran across a clip of this production on a British comedy website, and immediately ordered it from AmazonUK, since I have an all-region DVD player. As a Python fan since the mid-70's, and one who ""religiously"" watches&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monty-Python-s-Life-Of-Brian-The-Immaculate-Edition/dp/B000VE439Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monty Python's Life Of Brian - The Immaculate Edition</a>&nbsp;every Easter, this was must-watch TV. The cast was excellent, in particular Rufus Jones, who did double duty, playing the good Terry Jones(as opposed to the evil Pastor Terry Jones) and Mrs Michael Palin(a perfect bit of whimsy, since one of my favorite ongoing Python shticks is Jones in drag & as a ""pepperpot"", and his wonderful portrayal of Brian's Mum, Mandy Cohen). If you're a Python fan, this is a must-have, and one thing that's nice is it's not another crummy attempt by Eric Idle to cash in(Steve Punt of the BBC's Now Show is excellent as Idle). So if you don't have an all-region DVD player, watch the excerpts online, or if possible, tweak/hack your US DVD player.
BTW, I paid the equivalent of $16.00 including shipping. A far cry from the $30.00 plus some sellers are charging on Amazon in the US. I've no doubt that all they do is take your money, then order the UK PAL DVD, and have it shipped on direct to you. Eliminate the middleman, order it yourself, save money & give two fingers up to these thieves!!",1330214400,,1483,5.314893617021276
5071099,5,B007A12FWI,"This is a BBC 4 programme that was first shown in October of 2011 and I missed it so this was a God send (if he truly exists obviously). It starts as it means to go on by being an homage to the Monty Python Crew and wearing its humour proudly on its sleeve. It says it is all a bit made up which is a bit like the Bible.

It centres around the furore and public hulabaloo that blew up around `The Life of Brian', and the handling that they did to try to get it shown. It was banned in more places than the Sex Pistols Tour had been, with only one London Cinema allowing a screening. In the midst of this Bible bashing self righteousness Mary Whitehousesque frenzy, the BBC waded in. They wanted the boys to appear on the current affairs talk show (not `chat' you understand) `Friday Night, Saturday Morning'.

Michael Palin (Charles Edwards who also plays his own mum!) is the nicest man in the World and John Cleese, well is the opposite and seen as a bit abrasive. As such the duo would be the perfect foils in a healthy adult debate about all matters ecumenical and stuff with some Bishop and womanising alcoholic and former comedian Malcolm Muggeridge.

The Python humour is at the centre of all of this with surreal moments galore which are sent up through out and men playing all the parts. Rufus Jones plays both Terry Jones and Michael Palins wife - without adequate `shaver time'. There are animation sequences to honour Terry Gilliam and a BBC team straight out of `In The Thick of It' with a producer who just wants a BAFTA. There is also a lot of modern satire and clear references to the future through out. Stephen Fry makes a short appearance as God too.

Darren Boyd plays John Cleese as Basil Fawlty and that is on purpose as they insert a Party Political Broadcast on behalf of John Cleese explaining he is nice in real life really. We also have sub titles and scrolling text and a shed load of profanity even the BBC Department for Swear Words gets a mention.

This is for fans of Python, comedy satire and original programming. I loved it and found it totally engrossing, despite a couple of groans it was a welcome breath of fresh air - highly recommended.-, unless you think you are the Messiah that is.",1329782400,6,2225,4.390776699029126
8513100,5,B007A12FWI,"If you are a Python fan, buy this! These guys are even funnier than the real Pythons. When you are watching note how many different roles each actor played. Funniest was the guy with Tourette's. Wow, I never thought I'd say something like that, but this actor and the writers hit a home run.",1482278400,,291,4.407407407407407
8513101,1,B007A12FWI,With the small resolution picture I originally saw I thought these were the original Python actors.  The acting on this video made me appreciate the original actors even more as the actors in this video (even with great material to work with) are quite bad.  Do not recommend.,1475452800,,276,4.729166666666667
8513102,3,B007A12FWI,Interesting and kinda funny but it isn't a Python movie. Don't make that mistake.,1454284800,,81,4.857142857142857
8513103,3,B007A12FWI,"This was erroneously described as funny but it really is a dock-drama sprinkled with humor.  The Python imposters are great, you will think they are original.  But like real life, many moments in this film really drag on (and I don't mean the men wearing women's clothes).",1441238400,,272,4.76595744680851
8513104,5,B007A12FWI,great product!,1438646400,,14,6.5
8513105,5,B007A12FWI,"Well done and hilarious recounting of the Brian controversy as reenacted by a brilliant assembly of top-notch talent. Makes a great companion piece to the book MONTY PYTHON VS THE WORLD, which tells how the Python team came together to create their legendary TV series, and how it almost never happened.",1417996800,,303,4.96078431372549
8513106,1,B007A12FWI,"Horrible! To make things worse, I bought this when I was at the store without my glasses. Expected much better. I should have known better. Maybe I can sell this.",1402790400,,162,4.433333333333334
8513107,2,B007A12FWI,"A weak screen play,poor direction(one could drive entire army battalions through the holes in the pacing) albeit interesting performances by some prominent British actors impersonating the Pythons.
Sadly although they were excellent imitations the performances were simply not as funny as the real thing-not even close. Bought this because it was highly touted but overall found it quite disappointing.",1395273600,,402,5.830508474576271
8513108,5,B007A12FWI,"The film was hilarious and all the actors were great. The film is very quirky and may not be for everyone. But for those who like quirky british humor, it's a must see.",1394496000,,168,4.121212121212121
8513109,4,B007A12FWI,"Very entertaining and funny. A story done about the Pythons using a sort of  ""comedic sketch"" format. Before watching this, find the video on YouTube about the John Cleese and Michael Palin debate over the ""Life of Brian."" It will make more sense.",1391817600,,247,4.744186046511628
