8262357,5,B0016GOKLC,"GADAR IS ONE MY FAVORITE MOVIES OF SUNNY DEOL BECAUSE IN IT HE SHOWED HIS REAL ACTING AS AN INDIAN TRUCK DRIVER TRYING TO SAVE HIS MUSLIM WIFE AND CHILD FROM HER EVIL DAD'S WRATH. THE SONGS ARE SPLENDID AND SUNNY'S FIGHTS ARE COMPLETELY OUT OF THIS WORLD ALONG WITH HIS ROAR OF THE TIGER. FROM STARTING TO END, GADAR IS A DELIGHTFUL ENTERTAINING AND HARDCORE ACTION INDO-PAK LOVE STORY. I CHERISHED IT FOREVER AND EVER!!!",1353542400,,421,4.552631578947368
