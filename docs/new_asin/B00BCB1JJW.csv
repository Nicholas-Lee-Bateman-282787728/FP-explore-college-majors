5577668,3,B00BCB1JJW,"I love this movie,its a comedy classic,every scene is just hilarious, i love the ending, i'm glad they changed it because originally they weren't suppose to go into Wally World, Clark goes to Roy Wallys house and holds him hostage for closing the park and has him dance, John Candy was so perfect as the security guard, i love the part where hes talking real fast to Roy Wally and blabbering to him and he says QUIET!!! lmao, my issue isn't with this movie in no way at all, i love it, its with the blu ray picture, i have the 20th anniversary dvd from 2003 and to be honest the picture is way better on it than this, i can't believe i'm saying this but i've compared both pictures and the 20th anniversary has better color and sharper images, just my opinion, i know some people will disagree with me, but if you have the 20th anniversary dvd, hold on to it, this one is not worth getting, the only great thing about it is the 85 minute making of documentary with all the actors,other than that everything else is the same as on the other dvd, except the family truckster featurette, overall great classic comedy movie, average blu ray dvd.",1370995200,2,1141,4.386792452830188
5577669,5,B00BCB1JJW,"I'm a big fan of this film NATIONAL LAMPOONS VACATION
i already own the 20th anniversary edition dvd that was released in 2003
which had a very small featurette about the making of the film and a commentary track
which i didn't think much of

and then Warner bros released the film on blu-ray about 2 years ago i think
that blu-ray release is waste of money, cause it's exactly the same as the 20th anniversary dvd
the picture quality is pretty good better than the DVD but the extras/special features are the same
as the 20th anniversary dvd
so there's nothing new

so i definitely wasn't going to buy the 2010 blu-ray release and in the mean time
hopeing that Warner bros would give this film the special treatment it deserves
and Warner bros have finally did it this year 2013

Warner bros are advertising this new blu-ray re-issue as 30th anniversary edition
and it's the best version you'll ever get of NATIONAL LAMPOONS VACATION
so i went ahead and bought it of amazon.com and i have no regrets
this new blu-ray transfer looks amazing and much much clearer picture quality than the previous DVD release
plus the sound quality has been given a boost to 5.1 master audio mix
as for the special features
the exact same extras from the 20th anniversary dvd release are here
plus all new 90mins Documentary has been added it's the TV Documentary by BIO channel
NATIONAL LAMPOONS VACATION-THE INSIDE STORY
A Brand new Documentary on the film
all recent interviews with all the actors/actress's from the film, well most of the actors anyway
Chevy chase, Beverly D' Angelo, Anthony michael Hall, Dana barron,
Christie brinkley and Harold ramis, Matty simmons, Eugene Levy,
and the list goes on
the only person not interviewed for some reason is Randy quaid
there's rare behind the scenes footage, outtakes, Deleted scenes etc
it's an incredible Documentary, any fan of this film will not be dissapointed

this Documentary is only available on this 30th anniversary edition blu-ray actually
it's a blu-ray exclusive, it wasn't released as a seperate DVD release
so if your a big fan of the film you have to get this 30th anniversary blu-ray to watch the Documentary
5 Stars for this new 30th Anniversary blu-ray worth the money for sure",1369353600,51,2233,4.762273901808785
5577670,1,B00BCB1JJW,"To release this film in mono for it's 30th Anniversary Blu-ray is an embarrassment. This film deserves much better.  One of the great comedy classics.  I would buy this in an instant if there was at the very least a Dolby Digital 5.1 mix, and I wouldn't even be happy about that to be honest.  This release is unacceptable Warner Brothers.  Unacceptable.  And yes, I realize that the film was originally released in mono, but I have blu-ray's from films in the 1930's that have been upgraded to 5.1 and sound amazing.

The Griswold Family travel across the country on a family vacation to Wally World. This movie shows that ""getting there is half the fun"".  Clark Griswold has one focus and one focus only. That's to get his family to Wally World to have the vacation they deserve, but just like in true ""Vacation"" style things don't go as planned and the laughter ensues.",1363305600,4,1389,9.595419847328245

5577715,5,B00BCB1JJW,"Watching this movie 30 years later as an adult with kids instead of as a kid made it even funnier and made me appreciate it even more. Really, this movie is one of those rare ones where everything just comes together and simply is perfect.
I was compelled to purchase this dvd when I received a look of befuddlement from my teenage daughter as she asked me...""who is Clark Griswold?"" when I had just broken the news to her that we were going on a family road trip to California (from Florida) and that I was planning it out hard core Clark Griswold style.
At first I was shocked, angry,  and confused by her question...I thought...is this some sort of sick joke? How can she not know who Clark Griswold is?? REAL tomato ketchup Eddie? Then I remembered my age .

Revisiting this classic as an adult (well...physically anyway) was a fun combination of nostalgia and laughter...they don't make them like they used to. I didn't realize just how many classic and quotable lines came from this movie. The extra content was interesting and fun to watch...but the movie itself has too many hilarious and memorable scenes and moments to mention here as anyone having seen the movie no doubt already knows.
All in all, the movie is worth owning, hands down...if you haven't seen it in awhile you're in a for a treat. Spend the extra few dollars and get the blu ray, might as well.",1420243200,,1371,4.5465587044534415

Vacation kicks off a quadrilogy of Griswold goofy movies.  Vaction and Christmas Vacation might well be tied for first place, but Vacation definitely has a special place in everyone's heart with some of the most hilarious situations.  It looks fantastic on this blu-ray transfer, but you always wish it could be less grainy.

However, the detail is preserved and it's spec free.",1397952000,,518,4.711111111111111

The late John Candy and the late Harold Ramis are both gone.  Chevy was great as Clark and Beverly was a good pick as the mom. Randy was funny but Christmas vacation he really shines. Everyone in the cast added to this picture including Christie Brinkley and Eugene Levy. Many of the lines in the movie are just as funny today.

Sure there are some questionable scenes that now are in poor taste like the ride through the St. Louis ghetto, but overall the movie has held up quite well.  Mr. Chase gives a stellar performance as the Griswold patriarch Clark.  He hits all the right notes and he balances the clumsier aspects of the character with the passion of a man who knows his kids are getting older and wants to enjoy as much family time together as he can before it's too late.",1383091200,,583,4.481132075471698

Of ALL the films it is this one & the third film that made a franchise.

All star cast.

So, they released the film onto blu ray for the 30th anniversary.  If you are a true Vacation fan you will be disappointed by the extras.  The commentary used on a previous DVD release and all they added was the ""Inside Story"" shown on the Biography Channel.  So, why not something new from the cast and crew.

5577738,5,B00BCB1JJW,"I've seen this film approximately 30 to 40 times in my life, and I never get tired of it. Boneheaded, but well meaning father, Clark Griswold, driving his wife and two kids on a cross country family vacation, from Chicago to a California theme park, to spend time with all of them, before the kids are too old for such things.

Needless to say, absolutely nothing goes according to plans: they got lost before even leaving Chicago. Their new car isn't what they had planned. They're saddled with driving an obnoxious aunt to Phoenix. They get lost in the Arizona desert, after visiting obnoxious, trailer trash in-laws, and then robbed by local hicks. All of these absurd, yet wholly possible, circumstances and occurrences pile up, yet Clark Griswold (Chase, in one of his funniest roles as the hapless, clueless father) is determined to have a good holiday with the family, even if it kills them.

Beverly D'Angelo is equally good as the (sexy, but not overly) housewife who has enough disaster and wants to turn around and go home.

Great score by Lindsay Buckingham also.

You must own this on Blu-Ray cause it looks and sounds amazing.",1377129600,2,1140,4.771573604060913

I can't tell how many times I seen the movie, first in the theater, then a Betamax tapes, then a VHS tape, then a DVD, now a Blu-ray. I have them all, and each new medium seems to improve both the video and audio. However, the ultimate addition is the ""Inside Story: The Making of Vacation"" special from the Biography Channel. There are several of these specials (Animal House & The Silence of the Lambs are two). I find them to be exceedingly well done as very entertaining documentaries of the movie making process. I bought this edition of Vacation solely because it contains the ""Inside Story."" It's great!",1373500800,,698,4.592
5577742,4,B00BCB1JJW,"Many people are already familiar with the classic family road trip movie so they know what to expect.  The main special feature of the 30th Anniversary release is the documentary with cast and crew of the film.  It was clearly a TV special on the film with the commercials cut out so it was really annoying of having the short clips before where a commercial would have been and then hearing the same thing again just a few moments later.  The TV special was interesting and informing about the film though, so looking past the TV editing job, it was worth watching.  The quality of the film was pretty good too, but video and audio.  Many people have complained the audio is not stereo or surround, but it is in its original mono track.  Those who want the original theatrical release will be happy.
