1843277,5,B00008G6G8,"Words can't describe how impressed I was with the OFFICIAL sequel to Bruce Lee's Chinese Connection...the film picks up where Chinese Connection left off, awesome fight choreography, awesome acting, colorful characters(many of the same characters from the 1st movie) and my man Lee Roy Lung(bka Bruce Li) did an excellent job portraying the borhter of Lee's murdered character in that he was being himself as opposed to mimicking Bruce Lee with fake Bruce Lee yells and pseudo-boxing techniques. I consider this film a classic and a REAL tribute to Bruce Lee's life, legacy and contributions. Bruce Li's GREATEST ALL-TIME WORK, hands down...period. A perfect companion to Bruce Lee's Chinese Connection, no doubt. If you buy at least one Bruce Li flick in your entire life, BUY CHINESE CONNECTION 2!",1107129600,,799,5.2015503875969
1843278,5,B00008G6G8,"I've been looking at anything related to bruce lee there is on the market. The this is the first (bruce lee clone) movie I see that trully reflects some of Bruce Lee real ideals. Even though it is impossible to say that the skills of Bruce Li, on martial arts, match those of Bruce Lee, he is very good. The quality of the dvd is good for movie made on the 1970's.",1076112000,,364,4.069444444444445
1843279,5,B00008G6G8,"Undoubtedly, Bruce Li is the best known Bruce Lee imitator. While the body of his work includes some stinkers, this film is a true classic. The film picks up right where Bruce Lee's original left off. Li plays Lee's brother who comes to avenge his death...and boy, does he kick some a##! Show stopping martial arts, and an ending that is much more satisfying than that of the original. The production values and acting are also way above typical Bruce-ploitation fare. You must see this! Incredible! ONE MAJOR COMPLAINT: This film was taken from a U.K. version of the film. This means that the nunchaku fight sequences, which Bruce Lee immortalized, and which Bruce Li interprets in this film are simply cut from the film. This ridiculous edit is common for films edited or produced in the UK. During Bruce Lee's hey day, his use of the nunchaku was deemed ""too violent"" for the British public to view, so all of his films were shown in the UK minus any nunchaku fight scenes. The thought was the use of the weapon on film would bring to the fore legions of nunchaku armed hooligans to beat up the rest of the populace. What it actually does is diminish some of the most important tension in this film. Watch carefully near the end of the film when his young friend runs and gets Li's nunchaku to fight the Japanese. Soon the nunchaku, are gone, and its obvious something happened, because as he's dying he has them in HIS HANDS! Bruce Li takes them from him, but SURPRISE! In an instant, Bruce is fighting the Japanese bare handed! Wah hooopened????? This is pretty screwed up, and for someone who wrote his master's thesis on these films and saw this in its original cinematic release, its pretty revolting. In addition, there is a scene where the Japanese leader watches a Cougar finish devouring a pigeon. What the BRITISH CENSOR cut out was the scene where the Japanese leader (Lo Leih of ""five Fingers of Death"" fame), takes the pigeon from the cage and tosses it to the cat for dinner. Well, now don't you feel all comfy now that you know you won't be influenced to use nunchaku or kill pigeons! PUHLEASE!!!! Anyway, if your not a nit picky kung fu fanatic like me, it won't bother you...but these are some major sequences to remove from this masterful work. If you can find one, try getting an early VHS copy which will hopefully have the uncut version of the film.",1066348800,3,2373,4.572769953051643
1843280,5,B00008G6G8,"Chinese Connection 2 (released as Fist of Fury 2 in many parts of the world) is a sequel to Bruce Lee's memorable film The Chinese Connection (Fist of Fury), taking up the story immediately following the death of Chen Chen, who was killed in a most memorable ending after avenging the murder of his Teacher.  The Ching Wu school is, to put it mildly, in disarray, and this condition quickly begins to spread to the other Chinese martial arts schools in Shanghai.  The Japanese, for their part, are more cruel and contemptible than ever, continuing to take out Ching Wu students and eventually, under the leadership of a new martial arts master named Miyamoto, taking over the Ching Wu school itself.  It's actually rather hard to watch at times, as the defeated and demoralized Chinese fighters turn into weak cowards, and those who do stand up and fight back prove vastly unequal to the task.  The Ching Wu teacher, believing he has failed his Teacher and his students, has become an alcoholic and a thoroughly broken man.  At this point, Chen Chen's brother Chen Shan (Bruce Li) arrives in Shanghai determined to avenge his brother's killing.  He alone shows no fear of the Japanese, delivering a number of up close and personal instruction sessions with those who try to get in his way.  The Chinese actually berate the man and urge him to leave town so that the Japanese won't come after them, but Chen Shan refuses to stand down.
I must say that Bruce Li really impressed me in this film with both his acting and his martial arts skills.  The other Bruce Li films I have seen left me rather noncommittal as far he was concerned, but he really gives the Japanese what for in this surprisingly good sequel to the original film of Bruce Lee's.  I keep wishing Li would break out the numchuks at some point, but he definitely lets his hands and feet do the talking here.
Even on DVD, the film quality of Chinese Connection 2 leaves a little something to be desired; I believe that, among other things, the full screen presentation of the film causes viewers to miss a good bit of the visual information afforded by the original presentation aspect ratio.  Unquestionably, this Hong Kong production is of an obviously inferior film type than that of the original Chinese Connection starring Bruce Lee.  Still, this is one of the best Bruceploitation films I've seen, and fans of Bruce Lee should not be afraid to test the waters of this Chinese Connection sequel; it is much better than I expected it to be.",1066003200,6,2507,4.662131519274377

7982629,5,B00008G6G8,This is hands down the best Bruce exploitation film you will see.  I just got this delivered to me today.  Now this didn't have the same production value as it's predecessor the Bruce Lee classic but it was a worthy sequel.  I urge martial art fans to not miss this one.  These films were very cheaply made and written but some of them were actually good such as this one.  I would also say this is Bruce Li's best movie.,1460332800,3,421,4.2125

7982636,3,B00008G6G8,"Bruce Li (""Dynamo"") stars in this direct sequel to Bruce Lee's 1972 hit ""The Chinese Connection"" (aka ""Fist of Fury"") and plays Chen Shan, the fictitious brother of Chen Zhen, who was the fictitious student of the ACTUAL Huo Yuanjia.  While nearly identical in theme, it's less effective in its portrayal of China's burgeoning external hatred & internal nationalism than the original, despite it carrying over some of the same music and cast members.

This takes place immediately after the events of the first film, with the Jingwu school mourning the death of Chen Zhen (Bruce Lee's character from the first flick) and again falling victim to humiliation and violence at the hands of the occupying Japanese.  The northern invaders are headed by Miyamoto (Lo Lieh, ""King Boxer""), whose divide-and-conquer approach to dismantling the Chinese schools seems to be moving along effortlessly, until the 25-minute mark, when Li enters the town to visit his brother's grave and discovers what's going on.  Well, the apple didn't fall too far from the other apple and Li starts giving the Japanese what for, much to the fear of his fellow countrymen, who admire Li, but wish him to leave peacefully.

While this film leaves much to be desired, it's not bad and takes itself seriously.  This is probably the most serious and humorless work of Bruce Li's that I've seen.  If the fight choreography had been given the same approach, this could've been a minor classic.  The fisticuffs aren't awful for 1977 but there's nothing particularly interesting about them either.  Quantity-wise, there are numerous fights, occuring frequently, but again, they ain't really all that great.  Even the finale is just okay. On the annoying side, the trampoline-aided jumps that are normally used gingerly (if at all) in old-school fu, show up here in great abundance. And, despite the deceptive cover, no nunchuks!

The Platinum Disc Corporation's DVD boasts a digitally ""Mastered"" picture.  Not RE-mastered but mastered.  Considering that, the picture quality is decent and old-school fans have had to endure much worse.  I also don't recall the fullscreen treatment being an issue.  The dialogue is only available in an English-dub with NO subtitle  options.  No special features either but I really wasn't expecting any.  I can't really recommend it but if you are a big fan of the original ""Chinese Connection"", you may enjoy the continuation of the story and, at the very least, are unlikely to be insulted by it.

1977.  aka: Fist of Fury 2.",1343433600,,2524,5.050724637681159
