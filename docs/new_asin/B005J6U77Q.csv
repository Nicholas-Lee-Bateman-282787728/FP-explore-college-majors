It is great to have you tell all who will listen, about our treasure.. our faith. The Catholic Church (as promised) is going to last to the end of time and is doctrinally sound; although we can't say the same for all its' many members. The Church is a hospital for sinners and saints, martyrs and persecutors. Watch these dvd's and learn.. as I pray you are enticed to study further. I'm sure after this labor of love, Father Barron can expect to hear these words, ""`Well done, good and faithful servant""..",1316649600,69,641,4.5344827586206895
4711679,5,B005J6U77Q,"Four years in the making, ""Catholicism"" is the long-awaited evangelical work of Fr. Robert Barron, professor of systematic theology at St. Mary of the Lake Seminary in Mundelein, Illinois.  In addition to rock solid scholarship and theology, the DVD series is filled with beautiful cinematography, which is used to illustrate the theological points in the series.  As Fr. Barron points out, the Catholic Church is and always has been a Church that embraces both the ""right and left brain"" of humanity.  It is a Church of science AND art, and the imagery in the DVD series is far more than fluff or filler.  The art depicted is ITSELF theology, and is very compelling.  Fr. Barron reminds us over and over again of the historicity of Jesus, and we see compelling modern examples of the Gospels in practice.  This series is mandatory viewing for anyone with a serious interest in the Catholic Church historically and today. This will be one of the great evangelical works of modern times.

PBS has already picked up four of the ten episodes, which will air in all major U.S. television markets.  I've seen the entire series (ten episodes in all) and I would strongly recommend purchasing the whole set.  Truly a remarkable work.  Fr. Barron is a genial, engaging and very powerful advocate for Christianity and Catholicism who will not be easily dismissed.

Precisely because it is so remarkable and compelling, I predict ""Catholicism"" will be vigorously attacked by today's self-styled ""new atheists.""  And with good reason: this series represents a mortal threat to the various brands of atheism, apostasy and simple misunderstanding currently in vogue.  If I were an atheist I'd be very afraid of this work!  So expect some ""piling on"" from that quarter.  That's virtually a selling point for Fr. Barron's series.

If you're a Christian believer, a ""cruise control Catholic,"" or simply an open-minded non-religious person who wonders what Christianity in general, and Catholicism in particular, is all about, by all means purchase this DVD series.  If you can't afford it, check out the PBS broadcast.  (I believe the 6 episodes not being broadcast on PBS will be broadcast on EWTN.)  Two thumbs WAY UP.  If I had more thumbs, I'd point them up too.  This DVD series is superb in all respects and will be a classic.",1316304000,470,2316,4.9328165374677

I ordered this DVD set on a whim, thinking that at the very least, it would show the beautiful places that I had visited on my various pilgrimages, and give a little history.
I was delightfully surprised when Fr. Barron started teaching! Edifying! Not only are you drawn in by the beauty and wonder of the various places where Our Blessed Lord walked and taught, but the commentary and instruction of Fr. Barron is smart, and NOT fluff, it delves deep.  Fr. Barron speaks as if he were talking to someone who is genuinely searching for the truth, which made this a refreshing bonus- after all, who isn't searching for Truth?  My only regret is that I didn't order the study guides to go along with it.  I've gone back and purchased 3 more sets already as gifts and plan to purchase a couple more for Christmas gifts as I believe this DVD set will definitely aid in enriching one's Catholic faith!",1315958400,281,972,4.537142857142857

Christian witness for gays in Uganda
By Thomas Patrick Melady and Richard Cizik
In the wake of a recent online campaign, millions of Americans now know the name of Ugandan Joseph Kony, whose Lord's Resistance Army is responsible for countless atrocities. But in the shadows of these developments, another campaign that would undermine fundamental human rights in Uganda has been ramping up- one that would establish legislation to criminalize homosexuality. As a Catholic who served as U.S. ambassador to Uganda and an evangelical Christian who has traveled throughout Africa, we believe it's time for more U.S. faith leaders to speak out against systematic efforts to demonize gay Ugandans before it's too late.

A 2009 bill introduced in the Ugandan parliament would have enforced lifetime prison sentences and in some cases the death penalty for homosexual acts, as well as punish citizens for not reporting their gay and lesbian neighbors to the authorities. The radical proposal stalled after an international outcry, but this inhumane legislation has been reintroduced. Some efforts have recently been made to strip the Anti-Homosexuality Bill of its most extreme provisions, but any effort to persecute people for their sexual orientation or gender identity offends intrinsic human dignity and violates Jesus's commandment to love our neighbors as ourselves.

While there are different theological views about the morality of homosexuality and divided opinions on same-sex marriage, the criminalization of homosexuality is incompatible with the teachings of our faith. The Catechism of the Catholic Church notes that ""every sign of unjust discrimination"" against gays should be avoided. Evangelicals read in Genesis that the breath of the divine gives life to human beings. We are all made in God's image. The entire Judeo-Christian worldview is built on this unshakable foundation. Any actions that defile the sacred architecture of human dignity must be opposed.

Ugandan religious leaders like Bishop Christopher Senyonjo have already been excommunicated from their traditions for voicing their opposition to the persecution of gays and lesbians, but the proposed bill, according to activists would make his Christian social witness a criminal act. Even the revised version of the legislation would still criminalize speech about gays and lesbians the authorities might deem too positive--setting an incredibly terrifying precedent for the persecution of any minority group.

U.S religious leaders perform vital humanitarian work in Uganda by addressing the ravages of severe poverty, AIDS and other societal challenges. However, some Christians from our country have also preached a vile gospel of hate in a nation where hostility to homosexuals already runs deep. A 2010 New York Times investigation documented how thousands of Ugandans, including police officers, teachers and national politicians, attended a series of talks led by U.S. Christian evangelists who denounced the evils of homosexuality and stirred up irrational fear that gay people would sodomize their children.

Brave Ugandans who speak out have been persecuted. Earlier this year, Simon Lokodo, Uganda's Minister for Ethics and Integrity, personally broke up a leadership training workshop for gay activists, saying ""we do not accept homosexuality in Uganda.""

Uganda is a proud, vibrant country that faces stark challenges and great opportunities. U.S. faith leaders who have come to know the indomitable spirit of her people now face an urgent question. Can we remain silent when human beings made in God's image are persecuted? ""Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,"" the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. warned us. Let us heed that moral wisdom today.

Thomas Patrick Melady is senior diplomat in residence, The Institute of World Politics, former U.S. Ambassador to Burundi, Uganda and the Holy See and President Emeritus of Sacred Heart University.

 Previous Review:

I have now actually seen one of these episodes. All I can say is that I was snookered, I was taken-in. I took this whole endeavor vastly more seriously than I should have. Here I have been critiquing art-historical valences, and theological facets, and this is basically just a commercial. The only way this could possibly ""convert"" anyone to anything serious in the spiritual life is if one could be moved by a commercial for over-active bladder. The scholck-meister Barron appeared on Catholic cable before the airing of his vanity project, and he went on and on in raptures about the Logos Spermatikos. Do I need to say anything else?? The great beauty of La Chappelle is given the terrible wide-angle lens like a suburban house being offered for quick sale by a sleazy real estate agent. St. John of the Cross is compared to a tennis star, and the ""dark night of the soul"" is something like Pete Sampras' bum ankle or maybe jock itch. Barron seemed to revel in taking special time to highlight how Juan de la Cruz was confined in a tiny cell by his own confreres and then taken out only to be beaten at dinner. I am NOT making this up!! Everywhere and in every way his commentary is so flaccid and gussied-up that it made me vastly more sad that I was raised Catholic than I ever have been before.

The worst part was actually was actually his pre-showing interview with Pere Pacwa. He opined that his favorite part of the whole thing was going to Uganda. And we were snookered into believing he was going to grapple with great art, even if badly. He was largely taken by a Catholic martyr who is reputed to have died eschewing gay sex with some king. This is Fr. Barron;s favorite part?? Better than the great art of Europe. the whole thing is just wretched. If this video abortion is any indication, the Catholic Church's future is much worse than even we critics imagine.

------Previous review:

Since I have been criticized by some of the reactionary Catholics bad-mouthing my insistence that there be an  art-historical analysis of Father Barron's work, I want to try to do something positive, to show I am really a nice guy. So I am affixing as preamble my review I just put up of Sister Wendy's series, which was also on PBS. I give a helpful hint of how future efforts could be improved by the Padre:

 Father Barron's Next Series Next Should Be Done In Drag of Nun's Habit, September 28, 2011

This review is from: Sister Wendy - The Complete Collection (Story of Painting / Grand Tour / Odyssey / Pains of Glass  DVD)
I am highly recommending this series for all those drawn to Father Robert Barron's recent Catholicism series. Thanks to the ministrations and dough of rich influential Catholics it somehow got made and they have succeeded with their lobbying to get it on Public TV. But Barron does not have half the art historical sense and honesty that Sister Wendy had. And that is already saying a mouthful. Also, I want to see Barron stand in front of a great David Hockney and talk about his ""boyfriend"" or ""lover"" as Sister Wendy did. The one thing Barron really could get from Sister Wendy and continue his schtick is to do the show in drag, with a Sister Wendy style nun's habit. He would look great. And that would at least make it entertaining.

Here's the earlier review by me:

Thanks to Fr. Barron's appearance on catholic cable with Raymond Arroyo tonight, I can provide a much more informed review of the world-view behind this effort. First of all the Father is very interested in art. As a way of explaining all the corruption in the Catholic Church, he invokes, of all people, Seurat. And he rejoices in the fact that he was able to film Seurat's masterpiece at the Art Institute of Chicago. You see, Father here sees in pointillistic theory, incredibly,  a way of explaining how the many gruesome corruptions of the Church do not look so bad when you take in the whole picture. Get it? Like Seurat's Grand Jatte. Poor Seurat,if he had any idea that his great painting was going to be used to explain perverse supposedly celibate pederasts he might have not painted it! Unbelievable.  But it gets worse. I really had no idea this guy was such a totally glib b.s.-er till I saw him on this show. And his ridiculous art blandishments continued, even though they made zero sense. First of all he seems to have no sense that Seurat's aesthetic was ultimately based on contemporaneous color theorist who hearkened back to Goethe's color theory. Goethe's world-view hardly comports with the prissy Thomism the Father favors. But no matter. He likes Seurat as an explantory mode, the way the young movie adolescent Cher on the movie ""Clueless""  with Paul Rudd likes Monet"". Cher says: "" It's a Monet, it loooks good from afar, but up close it's a big old mess."" That sounds like the Catholic Church for sure. Then the Padre somehow galumphs to a critique of expressionist art, even though the same sorts of problems he has with it  he would have with Goethean color aesthetics of Seurat. No matter, he goes on to give an utterly false idea of what medieval and early renaissance art was about. In his conjured world it is about something like ""reproducing what God thought"". I guess the revolution of more humanistic treatment of figures with perspective eludes the Padre even though it is available in every children's book on art. Apparently Catholics now want to re-write even the most basic facts of even art history. And somehow he even got Michelangelo into the act, who if anything tangled with the  even more tangled web of Neo-Platonism coming from the ultra-fraudulent Pseudo-Dionysius,yet these scholary deatils are of no interest to a glib TV actor.  In Father's traversal  Michelangelo is not the great homosexual he was, but a humble cipher. This performance  with Arroyo like a Disney world automaton. was so amazing for glib unwillingness to grasp  even casual facts, and so heavy on the what-me-worry propaganda aspect of constantly intoning about the ""sacraments"" that it made me wonder if the guy was hopped- up on something. Clearly, this is tradition that has cut loose from everything, to save its very appearances.",1315440000,26,10724,4.99103139013453
4711683,5,B005J6U77Q,"One of the most beautiful art/religious/philosophical compilations to DVD I've ever had the pleasure to experience.  Shot across Europe, including Notre Dame in Paris and the Vatican in Rome, Bishop Barron guides us through churches, and windy atmospheric streets, and serious scripture that allows the viewer to drink in the beauty of God through art.  A thoughtful presentation of Christianity through the eyes of a priest who has studied and lived his faith, highly educated in literature and the writings of Aquinas, but also a lover of art, I would call him a poet priest.  My husband and I own this set and have given this to family.  Truly he captures us with Beauty, allows us to feast with Truth, and you are left with the certitude that Goodness does indeed reside within you.  Highly recommend.

I am SO glad I did. Although the music can at times be a bit cheesy (think of a Hallmark movie), the lovely interplay of images and voiceover really adds something to the overall experience.

For the potential buyer, I would suggest the TV series for those looking for a more uplifting, emotional experience; conversely, I would recommend the books to those looking for a more intellectual experience. Although the material is the same, the difference in delivery and tone is striking. Bishop Barron's passion really shines in the TV series, but if you're here looking more to retain the information, I think you'll be less distracted with ""stuff"" by the book and better able to focus on the material vs. the grandeur of the music and images.

That being said, both are lovely, and as a half-sort-of-in-the-process-convert, I appreciated Bishop Barron's simple style of presenting a surprising wealth of information.",1471046400,5,1190,4.857142857142857

I have heard people numerous times criticize the Church from the outside looking in out of ignorance who would benefit from this series greatly.

4711761,2,B005J6U77Q,"The DVD set should clearly answer the following questions:

Question: ""Is Catholicism a false religion? Are Catholics saved?""

 Answer:  The most crucial problem with the Roman Catholic Church is its belief that faith alone in Christ is not sufficient for salvation. The Bible clearly and consistently states that receiving Jesus Christ as Savior, by grace through faith, grants salvation (John 1:12; 3:16,18,36; Acts 16:31; Romans 10:9-10,13; Ephesians 2:8-9). The Roman Catholic Church rejects this. The official position of the Roman Catholic Church is that a person must believe in Jesus Christ AND be baptized AND receive the Eucharist along with the other sacraments AND obey the decrees of the Roman Catholic Church AND perform meritorious works AND not die with any mortal sins AND etc., etc., etc. Catholic divergence from the Bible on this most crucial of issues, salvation, means that yes, Catholicism is a false religion. If a person believes what the Catholic Church officially teaches, he/she will not be saved. Any claim that works or rituals must be added to faith in order for salvation to be achieved is a claim that Jesus death was not sufficient to fully purchase our salvation.

 While salvation by faith is the most crucial issue, in comparing Roman Catholicism with the Word of God, there are many other differences and contradictions as well. The Roman Catholic Church teaches many doctrines that are in disagreement with what the Bible declares. These include apostolic succession, worship of saints or Mary, prayer to saints or Mary, the pope / papacy, infant baptism, transubstantiation, plenary indulgences, the sacramental system, and purgatory. While Catholics claim Scriptural support for these concepts, none of these teachings have any solid foundation in the clear teaching of Scripture. These concepts are based on Catholic tradition, not the Word of God. In fact, they all clearly contradict Biblical principles.

 In regards to the question Are Catholics saved?, this is a more difficult question to answer. It is impossible to give a universal statement on the salvation of all members of any denomination of Christianity. Not ALL Baptists are saved. Not ALL Presbyterians are saved. Not ALL Lutherans are saved. Salvation is determined by personal faith in Jesus alone for salvation, not by titles or denominational identification. Despite the unbiblical beliefs and practices of the Roman Catholic Church, there are genuine believers who attend Roman Catholic churches. There are many Roman Catholics who have genuinely placed their faith in Jesus Christ alone for salvation. However, these Catholic Christians are believers despite what the Catholic Church teaches, not because of what it teaches. To varying degrees, the Catholic Church teaches from the Bible and points people to Jesus Christ as the Savior. As a result, people are sometimes saved in Catholic churches. The Bible has an impact whenever it is proclaimed (Isaiah 55:11). Catholic Christians remain in the Catholic Church out of ignorance of what the Catholic Church truly stands for, out of family tradition and peer pressure, or out of a desire to reach other Catholics for Christ.

 At the same time, the Catholic Church also leads many people away from a genuine faith relationship with Christ. The unbiblical beliefs and practices of the Roman Catholic Church have often given the enemies of Christ opportunity to blaspheme. The Roman Catholic Church is not the church that Jesus Christ established. It is not a church that is based on the teachings of the Apostles (as described in the Book of Acts and the New Testament epistles). While Jesus words in Mark 7:9 were directed towards the Pharisees, they accurately describe the Roman Catholic Church, You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe your own traditions!

4711762,5,B005J6U77Q,"Spiritually and visually, it is very inspiring.  Bishop Barron is a scholar and so one has great confidence in his authentic presentation of Catholicism.  The message and the messenger are excellent and so enjoyable as well as positive. It is such a pleasure to see all these wonderful  cathedrals and sites in the different countries. The people are as beautiful and as compelling as the fantastic architecture and the settings in nature and in the cities.  It is a win win for Catholics to know more about the worldwide effect of Catholic Christian spirituality through out the world.  Yes, when I discovered this series, it was like discovering a treasure that joyfully supports my faith.  Thank you for allowing me to comment on this series.

Barron's approach to the deep mysteries of our faith - especially on the Eucharist, the Mass, the saints, the nature of God, etc... Highly, highly recommended!",1399334400,,382,5.383333333333334

4711926,5,B005J6U77Q,"Though I don't praise Father Barron for his numerous YOUTUBE presentations I can say that his Introductory course into the teachings of the Catholic Church is rather excellent (I have the complete series in my Amazon Library).  What I do not like about Father Barron numerous YOUTUBE presentations is his lack of edifying the laity into the mystical and esoteric teachings of the Catholic Church, which is a real live modern day Mystery School.",1399075200,,444,5.0

4711933,2,B005J6U77Q,"Not inspiring.  Seriously, folks, this is a sincere effort, but it's just not that good.  I'm waiting for a GREAT DVD set that takes into consideration much more (including these Amazon comments).  To make a great set, you need a lot of collaboration.  Everyone is just doing their own little project, thinking that their opinion is the correct one and their presentation is the best one.  Don't be afraid to go deep and give some gutsy truth and address in a very succinct way some of the most common controversies and misunderstandings (in the context of ""diversity within unity"")!  Because you know people have many questions lingering.

Get Bishops and Cardinal's comments.  Show a few Fulton Sheen quotes/short succinct blurbs.  Incorporate clips of PJPII and many more.  Weave in some great Catholic quotes, some memes from Saints.  Include the allowed Latin Mass, the Byzantine Liturgy, and more (just don't mention the ""clown"" Mass!).  And, best of all, leave yourself out; make it so that you can't tell who the teachers and makers of the DVD series are.  Hire two good narrators, a male and female.  Of course, break up the intense portions and keep it lively and entertaining, with lots of variety of Catholic and Christian music (ranging form chant, hymns, choral AND not be afraid of a smattering of praise and worship music!

I'm a Catholic and adhere to the Magisterium.  This set is a good beginner teaching tool but it seems to only preach to the choir, to those already exuberant in the Faith.  I wish that Catholic theologians and apologists were more in touch with the general populace or at least more able to anticipate acute questions, objections and agnosticism, then to provide good answers incorporated into sets like these.  There's good in it, giving an overview of the richness of our faith.  But it's not that much better than leaflets that idealistic cradle Catholics put out with titles such as  ""Why the Catholic Church..."" and ""Ten Reasons to Come Back...""  all the while giving pretty bland information.

Go ahead and tell of the ways Catholics changed culture for the better; It won't be self-aggrandizement to cite in a concise way the multitude of ways that the CC helps people--yes, to include a smart defense of some controversial topics such as that the Crusades were a reclamation effort and to ward off evil.  Because there's a lot of people out there who have heard the poor interpretation.

Inspire Catholics to be Christ in the world.  In the end, its Catholics themselves who need to glow with love toward people, not to turn off folks like so many in-and-out-the-door Catholics, to be more intuitive of their neighbor's (even their fellow Catholics!) needs, and just not being snobbish that evangelizes and builds up the Body of Christ.  Jesus came to give us the fullness of life.  It's more about living out the gospel than theologizing and showing pretty pictures.",1397433600,5,2915,4.895918367346939
4711934,5,B005J6U77Q,"Outstanding information.  For most Catholics raised in the 60's and 70's, we lack the education necessary to fully appreciate the value of our religion.  This fills in all the holes and is a wonderful resource.  Highly recommend it.",1397433600,,232,5.052631578947368

Fr. Robert Barron is simply awesome! His down to earth explaination of Christianity and the church are inspirational...and he presents the teachings of Christ in a way that draws you in to the conversation.

This series is good for non-Catholics as well. My wife is Baptist and we watched them all together. Her faith was strengthened as well. For me...it deepened my Catholic faith and gave me a tool in which to renew my faith.

4711962,5,B005J6U77Q,"So happy to own this beautiful, intellectual series. It's not only beautiful, it's sound, thought- provoking theology. Every Catholic should own one and learn their faith. And every non-Catholic should view them and get exposed to the truth. PBS did televise 4 hours of this series upon it's release. Glad they did. Wish they would rerun it. I'm so very proud to belong to this One, Holy (means set-apart), Apostolic Church. Such history!!!!!",1393286400,,442,5.068493150684931

4711966,5,B005J6U77Q,A new and excellent study of the Catholic Church that is honest and beautifully presented. If there is any criticism of the program it presents to many ideas in the hour presentations.  I would have liked  the hour presentations to be broken into 15 minuet presentations.  It was difficult to digest the concepts presented so powerfully on the long hour presentations.  Hooghly recommended.,1392076800,,390,5.142857142857143
4711967,5,B005J6U77Q,"Our Catholic faith is beautifully summarized in ten, 1-hour episodes on 5 DVDs. Rev. Barron relays information, mysteries, and understanding with such simplicity.

I was introduced to this series while attending RCIA, and what struck me was how much I wanted my faithful Protestant family to be here watching this with me...how such thought-provoking material could lead to so many conversations and clear up so many misunderstandings.

Will definintely help you have words for when someone asks you the reason for your hope.

Only gripe- I wish Fr. Barron touched at least one time on the Eastern Catholic Churches, fully showing how Catholicism is not only West (Roman Catholic) and Latin in liturgical expression, but as Bl. Pope John Paul II said it, the ""Church that breathes with both lungs- East and West.""

That said, I wanted to say Thank you Fr. Barron for making this documentary. It will be of great value to those I share it with in my life.",1390003200,,644,4.543103448275862

4711984,5,B005J6U77Q,"This is such an excellent series.  We watched it as a family over Holy Week 2013 and it really enhanced our week of preparing for the Triduum and Easter.  Our children were ages 6-17 at the time.  The six-year-old sat and played while we watched, absorbing what she wanted to, but the others, ages 10-17, loved it and were entranced.  Great job, Fr. Barron!",1388966400,,357,4.53125
4711985,5,B005J6U77Q,"I have a background in Theology with a degree in Catholic Parish Ministry and found this entire series to be captivating. I usually prefer to watch things for entertainment, and prefer to read to be educated on a topic. However, the engaging nature of the Catholicism series, as well as the presentation, filmography, and of course the insightful presentation of the Very Reverend Fr. Barron makes this series simply fantastic. It's easy to watch and understand, and I have recommended it to fellow Catholics and those preparing for RCIA; all who watched it have enjoyed it immensely!
Of special note are the holy sites, which are pictured as their significance is explained in the context of the discussion. Quotes and ties to Church theologians throughout the ages are also interwoven into the fabric of the narrative, as the strengthen, question or promote the biblical passages which are used to discuss not only the life of Jesus, Mary, Peter, Paul, Moses and others, but to explain the very theology of the Church, how it came about, the connections that bind the faith to the Bible, to Jesus and to God.

This really is a must-have!!! :)",1388966400,,1144,4.866666666666666

4711987,5,B005J6U77Q,"It's an amazingly clear, open and inspiring look at a faith that is often misunderstood, even by followers. Also great for noncatholics, atheists, agnostics, etc. - gives perspective and greater understanding and maybe even inspiration to look further. In a culture that currently prides itself on tolerance, it may help others to be more so of practicing Catholics.",1388448000,,366,5.327586206896552

this has easily done the best job for all the above...the video is gorgeous and audio inspiring...  What ""evidence that
demands a verdict"" did for apologetics, this series has done for capturing the heart, soul, and Spirit of
Christianity itself.  No Higher marks can be given or recommendation made.  My only criticism, and its' minor is
that the quoted Hebrew is horrible...  It is just sad that people of learning can't be motivated to learn the basics
of our 'mother' tongue... and a very poor witness to the Jews, who started it all...",1374796800,,771,4.937984496124031

The simplicity yet effective information that went into the preparation of the sessions was welcomed by the members of my church's Evangelization group consisting mainly of middle aged cradle Catholics who needed to be reminded of the richness of the faith into which they were baptized.  The DVD's  are ideally suited to participants of the RCIA  program who are making their journey into the Catholic Faith.

4712056,5,B005J6U77Q,"Of course, Father Robert Barron's knowledge of Church history, culture and the development of theology is always staggering to behold; at least I--a little layman--am always amazed by the historical surveys and hypotheses he offers.  I have only viewed two episodes of the 'Catholicism' Series: the one on Peter and Paul, and the other on the Blessed Virgin Mary.  The episode on the Blessed Virgin Mary is a look at the cultus of Our Lady on a global level.  Father Barron takes the viewer from Her little home in Ephesus, to Lourdes, to Guadalupe.  He even demonstrates how the Cathedral of Chartes is built in the image of the Maternity of Mary; an analysis I found wonderful to receive.

Of course, one can never cease speaking of the Virgin Mary, and I wish Father Barron could have said many more things.  I wish he could have taken us to Jasna Gora, or spoken to us about Fatima or Khebo.  Being a priest of the United States--and living in Chicago, no less--a little cameo of Our Lady of Good Help, approved in 2012--would have been fun.

Despite these personal caveats, the episode on the Virgin Mary is nevertheless a treat: it is a presentation given with piety and discretion, and obviously much affection.  I found it very touching, replete with a beauty able to move one to tears.",1371427200,3,1294,4.665198237885463

While this wonderful and refreshing series of the Catholic Church is a great way for Catholics to delve more into the Catholic religion, and gain more knowledge of the history, this series is also a great way for anyone to not only learn about the history of Catholicism but to see the different areas where the faith began and is still growing.

4712089,5,B005J6U77Q,"The Catholic faith is something which is directed to all the senses, recognizing that they are the normative pathway to the heart of man -- that interior castle where the mind and the appetites are brought together.  This series does a better job than anything else of its kind in presenting that perception. The only thing lacking is due to the limitation of the medium: There is not yet a way to digitize scent, touch, and taste. If there ever is, all that this series will need is remastering to include such experiences the smell of incense (and, on the other end of the spectrum, that of a Kalicut back street) and the touch of the breeze on a Galilean hillside. Until then, there is nothing better than this for the purpose of introducing the faith to those who do not know, or do not understand, or have fallen away from it.",1367625600,,831,4.467105263157895

Filming on site in the holy land, Ireland, Rome, Lourdes, etc etc gives magnificent backdrops for Fr Barron's presentation.  The architecture, painting, and sculpture highlighted in the series, along with the original background score, all add to the quality of each segment.  I would recommend the Catholicism Series to practicing Catholics who would like to understand their faith more fully; also to Catholics who may have drifted away from the church but are searching to fill a spiritual gap. This series may provide that entry back to their faith. I'd also recommend it to non-Catholics who want to understand more of what the Catholic Faith is actually all about.",1367539200,,777,5.208

We are about half way through the series and are very happy with it.  Our Bible Study group is going to get together and go through this too as a side project before the Diocese runs with it.

4712137,5,B005J6U77Q,"We are thoroughly enjoying Father Barron's approach to our church's evangelization and further education of the converted/returned and otherwise faithful Catholics.  Our Lenten devotions are being enhanced through this series.

Amazon dot com's providing the DVD through our INTERNET connection onto our HD screen is the schmere on our bagel - aka icing on a cake as we gave up sweets for Lent, not to mention my daily Guiness.",1362441600,,427,5.173913043478261
4712138,5,B005J6U77Q,"Great presentation and if you don't give up on the tedium of the first disc you will get a good history of Catholicism from the time of Jesus Christ's crucifixion and maybe an insight of the universal ritual and tradition they keep constant that has made it endure for 2,000 years . Also it's failings at times and ability to correct them and overcome . Barron is an excellent narrator as well . Good editing kept me very interested to the end .PBS had a good series on all religions as well . Good price from Amazon too .",1362355200,,522,4.282828282828283
4712139,5,B005J6U77Q,Everything is as expected. Why do you require a customer to use at least 16 words? I may start shopping elsewhere.,1362182400,,114,4.476190476190476

4712141,5,B005J6U77Q,Fr. Baron does a wonderful job portraying the Catholic church throughout its history taking us all around the world showing the past and the present.  Great history lesson and also uplifting to show the faith of so many that brought us to where we are today and how we can learn from our past from the martyrs who loved God even more than themselves thereby helping to pass on His faith!,1362182400,,387,4.450704225352113
4712142,5,B005J6U77Q,"LOVE it!!  I watched a couple of times already.  You can't absorb everything in one watching--there is so much info there.  Love Fr. Barron--he is very knowledgable, humble and down to earth.  I will watch again and again.",1362182400,2,222,4.7631578947368425
4712143,4,B005J6U77Q,Very interesting and informative series about the Catholic Church and many places of significance in the world.  Fr. Barron takes you around to different places and ties that place in with the subject he is speaking about.  He is a very good speaker and very easy to understand.  The only reason I am giving it four stars has nothing to do with the series itself... I bought the set slightly used and the disk which holds episodes 3 and 4 will not play in any device.  I am disappointed at not being able to watch those two episodes but still feel glad that I bought the series and can watch the rest of it  This would be a great set for any parish or home to own.,1362096000,,664,4.196850393700787
4712144,5,B005J6U77Q,"I have had this series for a while now, and I have been thoroughly impressed by Fr Barron's presentation and knowledge of the Catholic faith. Fr Barron is a renowned speaker and theologian, and this series is a part of his Word on Fire ministry to which he has dedicated so much of his time and intellectual energy.

To begin with, the production values are absolutely brilliant, with each scene and commentary well presented and often just beautiful, with common reference to art and architecture.

But the core of this series is Fr Barron's presentation of Catholic theology and beliefs. In this he does a wonderful job of conveying the Church's teachings and history, and in doing so he has made a great contribution for the New Evangelization asked for by Pope Benedict XVI. He also does not shy away from the dark periods in the Church's past, addressing them directly and discussing where the Church went wrong. But instead of focusing on them he attempts the place them in context of what the Church is, and not just who was in it.

This series is aimed at all people, whether they be atheist, agnostic, non-Christian, Protestant, or Catholic, and leads them through the core components of Catholicism and towards a strong understanding of the Church's place in both history and the present day. Much of the series covers Christian theology that is universal to both Protestants and Catholics, as was proved when my Protestant in-laws graciously watched the series with me in order to understand the faith of their new son-in-law better. They found most (7 out of 10) of the DVDs to be entirely without disagreement in regards to their Anglican beliefs, and those that they did find somewhat contentious have at least given them an understanding, backed by good theology, of why Catholics believe what they do.

All in all this is a fantastic series that will enhance the faith of every Catholic, while contributing to the understanding of Catholicism by all others who watch it, whether with a view of entering the Catholic Church or simply to understand the Church better.",1362009600,3,2081,4.853521126760564
4712145,5,B005J6U77Q,"Beautifully written and produced, this artful, thoughtful, ennobling series is a classic.

4712146,5,B005J6U77Q,"Wonderful!  We are using this series for our church study group.  I  bought this for my own study before the study group.

4712147,4,B005J6U77Q,"This series does a great job of explaining and examining the Catholic faith.  The presenter is likable and easy to understand.  The photography is really great with visits to lots of terrific locations.

The only problem was that my packet came with two covers for DVD9/10.  The right DVD was there but the wrong cover.  A bit of an annoyance.  I did send in a complaint but it has not been resolved.",1361923200,,400,4.486111111111111

4712152,5,B005J6U77Q,Every Christian and especially every Catholic should see the entire series at least once.  Fr. Robert Barron does an excellent job of bringing together the history and beliefs of the Catholic Church.  You do not need to be Catholic or even believe everything Fr. Barron talks about to enjoy the rich history of Christianity (with a Catholic lean).,1361232000,,347,4.9655172413793105

After watching this series why would anyone not be Catholic?Ever heard a priest understand an atheist point of view and offer an answer? That is how good Fr. Barron is!,1360886400,2,389,4.342465753424658

4712160,5,B005J6U77Q,The cinematography in this set is wonderful and brought back many memories of my own travels. It was helpful to have the stores of the history of the Church told in the place where they happened. My favourite was the one about St Peter and St Paul. I watched the whole set twice and could easily see it again. I learned a lot.,1360368000,2,326,4.190476190476191

4712170,5,B005J6U77Q,"I was expecting a series on church history. Instead, it deals with the faith itself in an orthodox,highly Christo - centric way.
.
 As I write this review, I haven't finished the series. But I'm finding it engrossing - so much so that every day at work  I looking forward to  the two episodes I'll see each night.

 Fr Barron is articulate and he has a pleasant personality.

 He manages to be challenging without ever presenting something so as to cause offence. Thus far I haven't encountered anything he says with to which a member of another Christian denomination would take exception  and, because Fr Barron explains the faith so well I'm thinking of lending my copy to a Muslim friend so as to afford him the opportunity to understand what we ACTUALLY believe.

Buy it. You won't be disappointed",1359504000,,802,4.671428571428572

4712173,5,B005J6U77Q,Fr Barron is such an eloquent priest. This series is for every Christian to see not just for Catholics. I've learned so much from watching this series.

4712177,5,B005J6U77Q,I watched the part of Our Lady of Gaudalupe on PBS a couple times and I really liked especially since I got to visit the shrine in 2010.  Viewing that program inticed me to buy the DVD and the Book.  It is very well done and informative.,1358726400,,237,4.0212765957446805
4712178,5,B005J6U77Q,I gave this as a Christmas gift for my son; he was very happy with it.  I have also seen part of the series on TV and found it very interesting,1358553600,,143,3.6129032258064515
4712179,4,B005J6U77Q,"An informative explanation of both well known and more obscure truths and traditions of the Church. It is presented in an exciting, but factual manner by a good narrator/ author. I believe that it is ideal for anyone who is involved in RCIA or any fallen-away Catholics, in that it may remind them of what is good about the Church.",1358467200,,331,4.533333333333333

4712183,5,B005J6U77Q,"Highly recommended it - weather you are a faithful Catholic, an uncatechised Catholic, a Catholic in name only and do not know why you are Catholic, someone curious about the Faith, or someone who persecutes or dislikes the Faith - a great way to know the truth - and then you can judge afterwards.  From the music, to the photography - the series is superb and Fr. Barron does a great job in the narration and explanation of complexity, simplicity and beauty of the Catholic Faith.  Be courageous to invest and discover the the beauty of the Faith.",1358035200,2,549,4.591836734693878
4712184,5,B005J6U77Q,Father Barron gives an excellent revelation about the facts and philosophy of this beautiful universal religion in a realistically filmed DVD narrated in an easy to understand manner.

4712187,5,B005J6U77Q,"I was alerted to it by a sample on PBS.  I've purchased several sets, one of which I gave to my parish Priest and another to a Priest that runs a home for troubled youth.
The theological substance is of Vatican quality. The production style is of Hollywood quality.  Fr. Barren deserves an Oscar for his delivery.",1357862400,,313,4.473684210526316

4712189,5,B005J6U77Q,"Of course the content was wonderful and for that I give it 5 stars.  My wife and I learned a lot more about our faith.  Additionally, the cinematography was beautiful and from places all over the world.  However, media quality was poor.  Two of the DVD's came loose in their boxes and were a little scratched up when they arrived.  One was because the center post in the box was defective.  Another DVD had a bad sector on it and would only work on one player in the house.  (It wouldn't work on any of the computers.)  If I could rate the media quality separately I would give it 1 star.",1357776000,,588,4.2342342342342345

4712191,5,B005J6U77Q,Fr. Barron is a great teacher.  This Catholicism series reveals the beauty of the Church and clearly explains the sometimes confusing beliefs and traditions of the Church.  A magnificent job.  Worth sharing with others who have had unanswered questions about the Catholic faith.,1357689600,3,278,5.4186046511627906
4712192,2,B005J6U77Q,"This is a well-received series with serious positive endorsements. I know people impressed by it. I expected much and was disappointed. Neither my wife nor I liked it, thus two stars: ""I don't like it."" So, I feel like the ""odd man out"" among reviewers.

Entitling this series ""Catholicism"" is grandiose. It does not come near to presenting the faith in its fullness. The scenery and settings are often stunning, but often the presentation of the faith is not particularly deep. Sometimes it's unctuous. The blurb for the final disc says ""Father Barron presents the Catholic vision of death, judgment, heaven, hell and purgatory as he journeys to Florence, Ireland and Rome."" Really? I watched the disc but somehow missed his in depth treatment of The Four Last Things.",1357603200,6,769,4.961240310077519
4712193,5,B005J6U77Q,"Although this series did not go into detail about all the history of the Church, it is an excellent overview especially for those who do not really know the Church's history  other than by rumor or hearsay.  The series does not shy away from the problems the Church has had in its history but shows how, only by the grace of God, has this institution continued and flourished.  It is a beautifully filmed narative that shows as well as tells the richness of the 2000 year old Catholic faith.",1357603200,,491,4.49438202247191
4712194,5,B005J6U77Q,This is a profound and inspiring presentation of Catholicism within the context of the universal Church.  Our parish loved these videos and I purchased them for a family member.  These are simply the best!,1357603200,2,205,5.0
4712195,5,B005J6U77Q,"I say no much more than Chapter 2 totally rocks. I can't imagine of anyone, Catholic or not, Christian or not, believer in God or not, who cannot catch a couple of pieces of really good stuff to think about by watching it.

Beyond that, the series is really good in both content and format. Father Barron is a guy who knows tons and yet is totally not a dork. He can make references from the Lord of the Rings to Summa Theologica and from Star Wars' force to God's immanence, all without making you feel like an ignorant or getting you bored. I highly recommend it.

Para hispanoparlantes: los subtitulos en espanol y  aun mas el doblaje permiten disfrutar completamente la serie incluso si uno no sabe nada de ingles. Escribo sin tildes porque se me altera el formato al publicar.",1357516800,2,781,4.485915492957746
4712196,5,B005J6U77Q,Excellent history of the Catholic Faith. The background locations made it all the more interesting.  I am watching the series for the second time and I am still learning something new about the Church.,1357516800,2,201,4.911764705882353
4712197,5,B005J6U77Q,"I am part of a small men's faith study group at a Catholic church in the diocese of Dallas in Texas. We chose to use this video series as a platform in which to further our understanding of the Catholic church.  Each week we watch 30 minutes of the series and then spend 30 minutes discussing how what we just saw and heard relates to our lives as husbands, fathers and sons.

The format is highly engaging as Fr. Barron brings together music of the world, sacred art and holy places throughout the world, and theology in a compelling story that I am sure would interest anyone who seeks spiritual truth.  The format makes it theologically accessible to pretty much anyone - no prerequisites required.  Fr. Barron has a magical way of explaining very complex subjects, like the Holy Trinity, in a way that opens one's mind and satisfies ones curiosity to know and understand the transcending and enduring truth of the one true God of us all.

This is a perfect use of 10 hours of your time if you wish to better understand the fundamental teachings of Christianity and Catholicism.  Any person in the human family will find benefit and enlightenment.  Fr. Barron and his production team does not disappoint in this series.  Excellent work.

Pax Christi,

Unfortunately the quality of the recordings is poor.  In the set I received, Episode 9 is almost unplayable and episode 10 is not much better.  To have such poor recordings for such excellent content is SO disappointing - especially as the set is not cheap!
To sum up: Content - stupendous!  Recording - poor!
Since writing this originally, Amazon have replaced the set of DVDs (no quibble,thanks!) and the new DVDs are all of excellent quality",1355875200,16,594,4.737864077669903

Barron beautifully articulate the love of our Lord and the teachings of His Church - the scenery is a sight to behold. You will see stunning countrysides and villages from all over the world - in addition to gorgeous Church's, Cathedrals and artwork.

I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my husband - per his request! This would make any Catholic/Christian a wonderful gift.

4712213,3,B005J6U77Q,"While at times informative and helpful, this collection is symptomatic of the plight of Roman Catholicism in the U.S., as well as the West in general: it lacks the prophetic, authoritative voice of apostolic teaching on morality, so needed today.

The episode on the Blessed Virgin does not mention the Rosary, nor the Marian saints, like, for example, St. Dominic, St. Juan Diego, St. Louis de Montfort or St. Maximilian Kolbe.  Fr. Barron relegates Marian devotion to sentimentality and proceeds with a ""Protestant-friendly"" take on this topic and others.

To a Church so removed from orthodoxy and bereft of sound catechesis over the past 50 years, Fr. Barron's series--at first glance--looks like a towering achievement.  But it just goes to show how authoritative teaching has fallen into disrepair since Vatican II, and how its insipid replacement has come to the fore and assumed normative, pervasive status.",1355011200,7,915,5.2465753424657535

4712219,5,B005J6U77Q,"More than a documentary, this is series is a fantastic presentation of the beliefs, history, and beauty of the Catholic faith.  Fr. Robert Barron begins where the Catholic faith began 2000 years ago, with a question: Who is Jesus Christ?  With this simple beginning, Fr. Barron progresses through the major points of the Catholic faith that are essential to one properly understanding what this ancient religion proposes about God.  Many approaches to Catholicism in the present age start with many peripheral ""issues"" that modern culture contends without making even an elementary attempt to understand the core beliefs of this religion, which offers a much more impressive grasp of the whole human person.  It is with this positive message and approach that Fr. Barron continues to unravel the history, dogmas, and ultimately, salvation that is proposed by the Catholic faith.

I highly recommend this series for any Catholic who attended Catholic school, for any Catholic who is curious about the core of the faith, for any person of good will who desires to know what the Catholic Church actually teaches, rather than the world's distorted presentation of this beautiful faith.",1353628800,8,1181,5.227513227513228

4712225,5,B005J6U77Q,"What many people know about Catholicism is simply this:  they don't like it. Beyond the litanies of historical abuses of the men of the church, so true, few know of the mystical Spirit, the consistent history, the purity of revelation that gives the Church its life, substance, its living food for the mind and heart. Beyond politics and the preoccupation of Self, lives a Love, and a body of carefully articulated thought, theology, and engaged tradition that holds together like a steel ball. Through 10 major topics, the deeply educated, genuinly inquisitive and kind Fr. Barron takes the viewer on a tour of art, scripture, philosphy and historical sites illustrating the interconnectedness of truth, and beauty in the formualtions of Cathoic belief.
Exquisitely produced, visually compelling and intellectually provactive this series presumes little and then takes you for a ride that undoes caricatures and reveals the deep waters in which Catholics swim. Skeptic and Catholic alike, Be prepared to be ruffled, unseated and then engaged with your own higher thoughts.  Jesus is not at all like other humanist teachers; if you undertand God, that is not Him; the Liturgy is a ""useless"" activity and Hell? perhaps there is no one there. Forget what you think you know and enter the Mystery. If nothing else, the capture of people's celebrations of it from around globe in this series will swell your heart.",1352851200,,1410,5.0995670995671

The music, the scenery, even the movement of Fr. Robert Barron makes you feel as if you are right there in the great cathedrals and sites of the Holy Land. And the information, well all I can say is I've been studying theology for decades and I learned many things. highly recommended, in fact I've gfotten some sets for friends. and I plan to watch the series again very soon,and it will probably be sometihng I watch over and over.

I can't say enough good about him.  He truly does justice to the Roman Catholic Church.  He is excellent to listen to and very inspiring to helping people in their spiritual growth in this life.  Highly recommended DVD set, also his web site, ""Word on Fire"", is another excellent opportunity for one's spiritual growth and I highly recommend it.

Already using it with a class of Adults who are following along with the books that accompany the DVD's. Everyone is enjoying the DVD but it sparks some great open conversations and learning moments.

I would recommend this to every person that whats to experience the beginning, history and daily life of the Catholic Church.  Father Barren speaks to everyone he does not use ""churcheze"" he simply is speaking to the viewer as if on a journey together.

I have found it to be a wonderful tool for people that are Catholic and a great discussion opener to those who are looking into becoming Catholic.  It is also great for evangelization as it is easy to pick and choose exactly what is watched for those who are Catholic but don't go to Mass regularly.",1349481600,3,942,4.754601226993865
4712241,5,B005J6U77Q,"Skeptical about the rave reviews for this DVD series? I'll admit I read them thinking these people are no doubt sincere but maybe prone to hyperbole. I bought the box set anyway, based on Amazon's description. My wife and I have watched six of the ten episodes so far, and loved every minute. Yes the use of locations, the art and architecture and music all contribute to our enjoyment, but the most impressive thing is Robert Barron's engaging conversational style pitched at (for us anyway) the right intellectual level. It can't be an easy task compressing some fairly profound religious concepts into an hour-long episode without dumbing it down. Barron manages to keep it light and well-paced but still thought-provoking. We will be watching it several times over.
My only gripe does not concern the content: the flimsy cut-out cardboard slip-cover is not going to survive the handling this excellent set of DVDs is going to get. Highly recommended.",1349308800,3,954,5.0062893081761

The language used is modern and convincing. The imagery is captivating. One has the opportunity to ""travel"" to various places of Christian interest, from Jerusalem and Constantinople to Lourdes and Rome. I especially liked the cathedrals, as well as the famous medieval and renaissance paintings.
The dogmas of the Catholic faith are presented in a simple, modern and appealing way. Each DVD deals with a different aspect of Catholicism. It makes you think, it kind of urges you to meditate upon your beliefs.
In my opinion, this series is a ""must"" for Christians of all denominations.",1348790400,2,679,4.964912280701754

It's not preachy or sanctimonious. Father Barron doesn't hesitate to bring up negative historical facts about the Church. But he spends most of his time extolling the glories of Catholic Christianity. If you have questions about the Church, this is a great introduction.",1345161600,4,425,5.173913043478261
4712250,5,B005J6U77Q,"I'm not Catholic and am not likely to become Catholic. However, that doesn't take anything away from this series. I have only watched the first hour so far, but that segment shows how close Christianity is in its many flavors. The central theme of Christianity is Jesus! That applies whether your faith is Catholic or Protestant. Either Jesus is who He said He is or else he is a liar or deluded. There is no middle ground here, no way to call him a good man if he isn't God. Jesus said ""I and the Father are one"". No 'good' man would ever make that claim. The first segment centers on the Catholic beliefs concerning Jesus and even if you are a Baptist you will find yourself saying ""Amen!"" all the way through. I know that as the episodes progress I will find areas of difference, but if believing in Jesus is the key to eternal life then Protestant and Catholic alike will be in good shape.

Now with respect to the blu-ray presentation, the picture clarity is wonderful! I haven't seen the DVD version so I can't compare the two, but I expect that most buyers will want the very best viewing experience and will opt for the blu-ray version. You won't be disappointed in the visuals, I promise you that. One of the beautiful aspects of Catholicism is their ornate sanctuaries...and blu-ray makes the frescoes, paintings and statuary really jump out at you in eye-popping realism. I recently visited St. Paul, Minnesota and toured the Cathedral of Saint Paul while there. You would be hard pressed to find a Protestant church with such reverence to those who served Christ in the past. There are reminders everywhere of those who were His stalwarts in service; men and women who stood by Him in life and then proclaimed His glory after the crucifixion.

When I have completed all the episodes I may decide to add to this post, but not in any derogatory manner since I harbor no ill will toward those who view Christianity in a somewhat different light.",1344988800,58,1954,4.58
4712251,5,B005J6U77Q,"Not just for Catholics__This video series contains the most fundamental teachings of what the Catholic Church believe. Fr. Barron's curriculum vitae and position as a Catholic priest gives him the right as one of the perfect and most legit persons to explain what Catholicism is all about. Every Catholic should own this DVD series. But most importantly, other Christians who are confused and scared about the Catholic faith should view this to develop their own opinion with information given by a credible theologian like Fr. Barron instead of browsing in the internet with so much false information to degrade the Church.

The video presents about who Jesus Christ is and what the Church believes. It shows a stunning centuries-old arts and churches which I find very helpful and supportive to the beauty of the faith. The historic sites and the facts that wraps around it is very effective in understanding what Fr. Barron was talking about especially in the gospels, the life of the early church, the saints/martyrs, and the Christian faith as a whole. Some commenters here mentioned that this is not only for catholics and I agree. Anyone who believes in Jesus Christ will love to watch and learn from this video. Overall, this is stunning, enlightening, intellectually profound, and magnetic! I cannot stop watching even though I have played it for several times and every time I watch it, a new understanding just lights up. My children loves to watch it too.

I am so happy that I did, it is very informative about the Catholic religion, it's teachings and practices and also for  me it brings the teachings and love of Jesus close to my heart. I did not feel to put it down but to watch the entire documentary in one sitting. The picture quality and Fr Barron's explanations of Jesus's life is of the highest quality. It really makes me appreciate what we have in our church, it's richness and values, and why we do what we practice and believe. I highly recommend this documentary to anyone who desires to know about the catholic faith and it's teachings. Are you considerings to buy this documentary now? Don't delay you certainly won't regret it. May it be a blessing to you as it is to me.

4712253,5,B005J6U77Q,"I don't want to write a long review.  This DVD series on Catholicism is great. That's 15 words, hope now I'm at 20.",1343779200,,115,4.0
4712254,5,B005J6U77Q,"Father Barron is becoming a prominent voice not only for Roman Catholicism but also for mainstream Christianity. Why? Because the good priest is able to communicate in an amiable an intelligent manner those truths that nearly all Christians profess, but often find a little difficult to articulate to an increasingly hostile media environment. (Note I did not say intellectual environment; it is a media-driven hyped up rejection of traditional values, norms and truths which is taking place.) And let's be honest, he is rather photogenic. Looks and style aside, Fr. Barron tackles head on and with love those issues most pressing upon believers and non-believers alike. So with his formidable reputation coming to this project, the expectations were high. The result will not leave viewers disappointed. This is simply the best dvd available on the subject in both scope and content.

Beginning with the life, teachings, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, he moves forward through history showing how the Roman Catholic tradition has answered the questions of head, heart and history to proclaim the salvation of God which is at hand, and which is present in the Church awaiting the Lord's return. Shot on location around the world over a period of four years, one really gets the sense of the places and times involved in the Church's history. What is most compelling about Fr Barron's presentation is that he continually ties it all back to our salvation and why what is preached really is ""good news"" to a seeking and confused world. No dry theology here. It is alive and vibrant and everything that is winsome about Roman Catholicism, from its preservation of the gospel in the bible and the saints' lives, to the multifaceted and universal manifestation of that gospel message in liturgy, art and philosophy. I only wish the series were longer. I want more!

4712271,3,B005J6U77Q,"This a a beautifully done broad view of the Catholic faith and as such it would deserve five stars except for two serious flaws. First, the narrator and creator of the series, Father Barron, says the Gospel of Mark was written in 70AD in Rome. Does he know this? He does not, its his uneducated opinion, yet he voices it as if it were a definite fact. Mark is considered the founder and first bishop of the Church in Egypt and the Coptic Church says he brought his Gospel to Egypt with him and a number of years later, after establishing the church there, was martyred in Egypt. The year he was martyred according to the Copts? 68 AD, two years before Father Barron says he wrote his gospel in Rome. Now, IMHO, if anyone has a correct tradition of when Mark died it is the Church that he founded. Therefore: minus one star.
  The second flaw in Father Barron's beautiful work is his statement, ""If anyone is in hell, and again I say if because we don't know, if anyone is there it's because they stubbornly are sitting in the corner while the whole thing [heaven] festively swirls around them."" Now what does Jesus and the Catechism of the Catholic Church say about this ""possibly empty hell"" of Father Barron's? Of hell, the Catechism says, ""To die in mortal sin without repenting and accepting God's merciful love means remaining separated from Him forever by our own free choice. This state of definitive self-exclusion from communion with God and the blessed is called 'hell'."" (1033) So does Father Barron really believe that over 2000 years it's possible that no one, among the billions of people who have lived on this earth, committed a mortal sin and then died, for example in an accident, before repenting of the sin? Does he believe that Hitler, unrepentant until the end when he committed yet another mortal sin by killing himself, is not in hell. But more directly, what does Father Barron think of what Jesus is quoted as saying in reference 1034 of the Catechism of the Catholic Church, that Jesus ""will send his angels and they will gather all evil doers, and throw them into the furnace of fire"" (Mt13:41-42) and that Jesus will pronounce the condemnation: ""Depart from me, you cursed, into eternal fire."" (Mt25:41)
  Now it is true that we don't know that any particular person is in hell. That judgement is up to God. In that sense Father Barron is right, but his stress on the possibility of hell being empty is silly. And this means minus another star.
  Do I recommend buying/watching this beautiful series? Yes. A watcher gets a beautiful overview of the Church, its teachings, its history, its worldwide ministry and its art. But I think one needs to know that Father Barron, based on the above two flaws in his presentation and on many statements he makes and quotes he uses, is a fairly liberal practicing Catholic; a ""social justice"" Catholic who, in my opinion, would probably if he were a college president, like the president of Notre Dame did two years ago, invite (and therefore honor) pro-abortion, anti-Catholic President Obama to speak before the student body. Father Barron is another Chicagoan, an open-minded guy, a little too open-minded. One must love the sinner but condemn the sin. Father Barron doesn't seem to like that approach and maybe that's why he's hoping against hope that hell is nearly empty.",1337126400,11,3345,4.719178082191781

My wife and I are almost done with viewing the first time around and are looking forward to start them all over again. The only negative I have is that the first shipment was poorly packed and the disks cases were broken and all the disks had come out of their holders and were all scratched up from sliding around during the shipment.

Thank you very much to the good Word on Fire people, and most of all, thank you Mr. Thornton for your help.

They went out of their way and bent over backwards to promptly resolve an issue that we unfortunately had with the quality of the disks that we received. It is transactions like this that reaffirms our faith in our fellow man (and those organizations out there like Word on Fire that still value their customers and are not above working hard to provide the best customer service possible). While I'm growing increasingly disappointed with Amazon-direct purchases due to their stiff penalties, fees & hassles for returns, particularly related to receipt of a defective product at no fault of your own, I would not hesitate to make another purchase of a Word on Fire product. This is a classy and honorable team.

What's more, this remains an excellent series that was beautifully filmed and we're looking forward to viewing the episodes on the disks that they replaced.

Thank you.

[/EDIT]

Title says it all. An interesting series, albeit not without it's quirks, but buyer beware: some of the disks won't play - something you would NOT expect for a product at this high of a price point. Then if you buy it from Amazon, you can't even return it for replacement or refund w/o taking a big hit to the wallet. Total BS and tragic since again, this is otherwise a good series all in all (or what we could see of it due to the VERY poor QC, which IMHO is reason enough at this price to dock it 3 stars... honestly, they're lucky they even got 2 stars given the high price paid).

4712315,5,B005J6U77Q,"I have waited to watch this beautiful documentary movie ""Catholicism"" by Father Robert Barron since before it was even released! I finally was able to buy it. It is worth every penny and much more.

I am now feeling so excited about my faith that I honestly cannot express how phenomenal this series is?

This was much more than I ever even dreamed it could be all combined into this DVD set.
I am utterly at a loss for words.

Okay, I am supposed to be leaving a review!
I am not experienced at writing down my thoughts and I am no journalist.

Catholicism was already important to me as I had only converted and seen the truth of the Catholic Church almost 3 years ago.
I still feel like I am new and I truly learn something different every single day.

But, when I sat down and watched this unbelievable series - I was lost in time from beginning until end.

I knew my fairly new Catholic faith experience was the most wonderful thing that had happened in my life of 55 years. I thought I had already learned a lot and I knew most of the important things after my year of early conversion in depth studies, a year of RCIA, and a year of growing and serving in my Catholic Church.

Yet, now I see I have only scratched the surface!

It was already astounding to me how I could have missed out on visiting a Catholic Church in all of my years of being an active protestant and seeking God's will. How did I NOT ever find out about the truth in the Catholic faith before 3 years ago??? (Please understand that I mean no offense to any denomination because I will always have fond memories of my past churches and the simplicity of the beliefs.)

But, after viewing this documentary - Catholicism - I feel as if the whole realm of the world of Catholic faith has opened up for me!
I loved my Catholic Church before and all of the unique, beautiful new experiences I was part of.
BUT, now I have the utmost respect and even deeper love for the awesome Catholic Church around this huge world that we live in!

The Catholic Church is ancient, true, and REAL! It IS Christianity! It is the world of Christ! It will not end.

We sometimes feel we are all so detached. We assume we live in our own little space but Father Barron shows us the amazing and profound ""world of Catholicism"" while taking us on an incredible journey!

I would not begin to know how to ever thank Fr. Barron???

All of the work he put into this incredible movie leaves us (and all of the generations to follow) with one of the most important gifts we will receive as far as knowing about Christianity!

This is not just for Catholics!
Anyone will love this documentary series.
Any faith or anyone without faith will appreciate ""Catholicism""!

I found Catholicism to be moving while it taught me more than I ever dreamed of learning.

Fr. Barron is so cool! He is so intelligent, likable, honest, sweet, loving, and most intriguing in the way he brings us all a huge storehouse of knowledge in a way even simple folks can understand!

This set of DVD's named Catholicism is indeed a ""KEEPER"" forever!
If I had the money I would send them to everyone I love or know of any faith.

It is ALL based on our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ when you get down to the main point! It even starts with Christ!
Thanks be to God!

I pray you will have the opportunity to enjoy ""Catholicism"" and that it will bring you into a period of enlightenment while causing you to think more deeply and become more educated all at one time.

I just cannot extend praise enough to God for allowing this to be released at this time so that I have the chance to watch it again and again.

This is a MASTERPIECE! It should win all kinds of awards! People - open your eyes!

Blessed be!
Peace!

A separate study guide with lessons is also available.  It was co-written by Fr. Barron and Carl Olson.  It is also very good.

4712327,2,B005J6U77Q,"This is a Norus Ordo production (the new, post-modern Modernist/Liberal Vatican II version of today's wimpy ""Catholicism""). Images of the New Vatican II Mass is showed, but no references to the Tridentine Mass which had been around for ages till Vatican II came ploughing through the Sanctuary. I didn't like this series too much. Much too apologetic at times, as if the Church was ""wrong to preach the Crusades"" (the presenter-priest's own words).... what aching words to hear from a supposed historian! If the Crusades weren't even fought, albeit at a loss, do you think Christianity will even continue to exist in Europe during and after the Middle Ages? The whole Europe will be conquered by Satanic Islam!

Enough of apologies to please non-Catholics and give us back the real Catholicism that evil Vatican II has jettisoned!

Like all Novus Ordo Liberal ""catholic"" clergy of today, this series tries to present a sanitized version of the Catholic Faith to make it sound nice to the modern world. Nice try though. The scenery in the DVDs are visually stunning. The music matches most parts of the visual imagery and somewhat uplifting. However, the New ""Catholicism"" of today, the version that is created by Protestant-inspired Vatican II council is one that compromises with the world. It has bent itself backwards to accommodate heresies of all forms, in particular hydra-headed Protestantism.

""Pope"" Paul VI has said that the ""smoke of Satan"" has entered the Church. Indeed it has! We should judge the Vatican II by its bad fruits it has produced over the last 50 years. The most damning thing is to create a new humanistic Protestant-like religion and disguise it as ""Catholicism""! Those who have the Holy Spirit ought to be able tell real Catholicism from false Catholicism. Vatican II is a deceptive betrayal to Catholics. What a betrayal of all that the Catholic Church has stood for almost 2000 years. Millions have left the Church since the henchmen of Vatican II usurped the reins. Millions has fallen away from the Faith. The numbers of clergy have fallen worldwide. No one wants to become a priest anymore, and those that do preach a new religion that is strange to the ears of all early saints and martyrs. Modern-day ""catholic"" institutions are infected by non-Catholics and Liberal thinking that has no place in Catholic thought, all in the guise of ""ecumenism"" and ""tolerance"". Has anything good come out of the false view of ""ecumenism""? No, not one bit. Modern-day ""catholics"" and clergy are so eager to grovel with Protestants and non-Christians and readily adopting their twisted teachings, that they (the modernist ""catholics"") have completely forgotten the rich history, teachings and warnings that Catholic Church has had! Look at how the modernist ""catholics"" threw out the Latin Mass and replaced it with an Anglican sect's communion service. Heard about clown Masses and all the abuses in the modern Church? Ask yourself: how and where, which unearthly Pit did all that come from? Hell and Vatican II. Go read post-Vatican II Liberal books, are they any better than the ones churned out by the Anglican sect of serial killer King Henry VIII? By compromising itself with the world and with heretics and heresies, the new Vatican II ""Catholic"" Church today has become a pathetic institution that no one respects!

Take heed the words of Our Lady of La Salette in the 19th century:

""Evil books will be abundant on earth and the spirits of darkness will spread everywhere a universal slackening in all that concerns the service of God. They will have great power over nature: there will be churches built to serve these spirits.....

""There will be extraordinary wonders every place because the true faith has been extinguished and false light illumines the world. Woe to the princes of the church who will be occupied only with piling up riches upon riches, with guarding their authority and lording with pride!....

""Civil governments will all have the same objective, which will be to abolish and make every religious principle disappear, to make way for materialism, atheism, spiritism and vices of all kinds. ....

""In the convents the flowers of the Church will putrefy, and the devil will establish himself as king of all hearts. Let those who are at the head of religious communities be on their guard concerning the persons they are to receive, because the devil will use all his malice to introduce into religious orders persons given to sin, for disorders and love of carnal pleasures will be widespread over the whole earth....

""Lucifer, with a very great number of demons will be unchained from Hell. By degrees they shall abolish the Faith, even among persons consecrated to God. They shall blind them in such a manner that, without very special graces, these persons shall imbibe the spirit of those wicked angels. Many religious houses will entirely lose the Faith, and shall be the cause of the loss of many persons. The Superiors of Religious Communities should be alert regarding the ones they take into the community, for the devil will use all malice, to bring persons into the Orders who are addicted to sin....

""Bad people will abound upon the earth; and the spirit, of darkness shall spread over the earth a universal relaxation about everything relating to the Service of God.....

""Priests, my Son's ministers, priests, by their evil life, by their irreverences and their impiety in celebrating the holy mysteries, love of money, love of honor and pleasures, priests have become sewers of impurity.....

Rome will lose the Faith and become the seat of the Anti-Christ.""

!!!

Sounds very much like what is happening right now as we speak, yes? Sounds like Our Lady is speaking about the damned Liberal renegade clergy of the 21st century in our current times of crises, don't you think?!!!

4712328,5,B005J6U77Q,"A fan of Father Barron well before this mini-series came to my attention, I was not disappointed with his analysis and break down of the Church of Jesus Christ.
Barron travels the world to show us how far the message of Christ has come, and how it is applied to our modern day culture. Ranging from Jesus' miraculous life, to the Beatitudes, the saints, the Virgin Mary, the Mass, and God, Himself, this mini-series does not disappoint.",1327104000,3,436,4.675324675324675
4712329,5,B005J6U77Q,"A disclaimer I am of the Christian faith but not a Catholic.

This ten-hour series is one of the most beneficial ever spent in front of a TV.  It will be tremendously helpful for a Christian from any persuasion whether Catholic, Evangelical/Protestant or Orthodox.  Most of the series could have been titled Christianity

Why would an Evangelical/Protestant benefit from this program? I will give three main reasons.

1. It is for the most part Biblically based. The 10 segments are not theologically objectionable but simply basic Christian doctrine.  For the most part from an Evangelical perspective it is theologically sound. Jesus as Lord, the Trinity, the teachings of Jesus, the nature of God, the missions of Peter and Paul are all taken right out of the Bible.  Father Barron was with Bible in hand through much of the series.  His insights and Biblical knowledge was refreshing and valuable.

His major theme throughout the series is the love of God from the First Epistle of John ""God is love."" Any and all Christians easily identify with this.

2.  It is a historical treasure trove. Father Barron brings the ancient world into your living room with various Biblical locations and brings the Biblical stories alive.  Jerusalem, Rome, Ephesus, Corinth Athens are just a few of the places that he visits putting the Biblical narrative in its actual setting.  He also brings in a few thousand years of the wealth of Christian Art to enhance these stories.  I have been studying theology and the Bible for nearly 40 years and I benefited greatly from his insights and some of the visual aspects of the stories.  One example: The Roman armies brought back an Egyptian Obelisk as a war trophy. Near this obelisk is where Peter was crucified.  This object may have been the last object Peter saw towering over him. The irony of a Roman symbol of military victory and yet that obelisk today is in St. Peters Square. Father Barron comments ""the obelisk is an your face"" image. The chief apostle slain by Caesar but now Caesar's victory trophy is in Peters Square.  Jesus as Lord has far surpassed Caesar as Lord

Father Barron is a very knowledgeable and a great presenter of the Christian faith regardless of his particular Catholic slant.  He displays, love, concern and appears to be quite genuine.

Personally I have never had much desire to go to the Holy Land, but after viewing this series my desires have totally changed.  I would love to go to Israel and Galilee, and Greece and the other places represented. I also would love to see some of the religious art shown in the series.

3. One will be better informed about Catholic Christianity. In my opinion the Catholic Church has been its own worse enemy. I have known numerous Catholics who have left the church because ""they did not find God."" As an outsider I view the Catholic Church as majoring on the minors.
Father Barron focuses the series the essentials and the true meaning of Catholicism.

I admit Father Barron does a great job of presenting his case in the areas that other Christians may find objectionable because in their view they are not apparently biblically based.  The Immaculate Conception, the Assumption of Mary the miracle at Guadeloupe, the Saints are a few of those areas.  His explanation of these doctrines and of Lourdes, and Guadeloupe or the Catholic view of Sainthood are a good education as to what they represent.
I myself went to the Church at Guadeloupe years ago when I went to Mexico but I never knew what it was about or its significance. Now I know. .

I do highly recommend this series, I have 4 adult children all who are frequent non-Catholic churchgoers and would like to view this series with them just so they can get a better understanding of the Christian faith.

4712330,5,B005J6U77Q,"Whether by human effort with or without a claim to supernatural insight the Word-on-Fire team has placed the documentary CATHOLICISM (like a TESTAMENT) into the philosophical, religious and theological universe of knowledge that humanity - all people of every age - has always been concerned with to understand and affirm what is eternally true and universally objective in order to live and die with rational conviction and to accurately preserve conclusions of objective truth and beauty to pass along to all subsequent ages a teleology of everlasting life.

This is no low-budget religious DVD. The visuals and music are gorgeous, great sanctuaries (Vatican,Chartre, Lourdes, Guadaloupe, Sinai, the Holy Land), great art and the engaging Fr. Barron will cover tremendous cultural, religious and theological ground. He has a way of ending each one of the 10 chapters that has surely brought many a tear to these eyes. Wonderful!

4712339,5,B005J6U77Q,"Those who are looking for a detailed history of the Catholic Church and/or an arsenal of Catholic apologetics from which to defend the faith will initially be disappointed by Father Barron's production of this series. I am happy to report to you however that after viewing the entire series and allowing it soak into your heart, mind, and  soul you will likely discover, as I did, that Father Barron has not only delivered on your original expectations (albeit not as you had originally envisioned) but has also provided you with more than you could have dreamed of. This series does not carry you through the power of the intellect.  It does not force you in any way through polemic discourse.  Rather, it gives you room to breath and allows you to take in the scenery of the Christian experience as it sets you off on your own personal journey to Christ and to a greater understanding of His Church.

The series is arranged thematically not chronologically. Each of the ten episodes highlights a different aspect of Christian thinking and utilizes a combination of gorgeous imagery and music to move the viewer beyond what mere words can convey.  The episodes are arranged as follows:

Episode 1: Amazed and Afraid - Asks and answers the question; ""Who is Jesus""
Episode 2: Happy are We - Highlights the key teachings of Jesus, paying particular attention to Jesus' Sermon on the Mount.
Episode 3: The Ineffable God - The only episode in the series that sets out a true polemic for the existence of God...primarily through St. Thomas' Argument from Contingency.
Episode 4: Our Tainted Nature's Solitary Boast - A beautiful summary of the life and mission of Mary and the Catholic view of Her Immaculate Conception and Ascension. Includes very moving allusions to Lourdes and Guadalupe as well as the world-wide veneration of Mary.
Episode 5: The Indispensable Men - Highlights the live's of Peter and Paul and places them within the context of Christian history.
Episode 6: A Body both Suffering and Glorious - Describes the Mystical Union between the Church and Christ
Episode 7: Word Made Flesh - A moving point by point explanation of the Catholic Mass and Eucharist.
Episode 8: A Vast Company of Witnesses - Explains the Catholic understanding of Sainthood which is buttressed by synopses of four modern Saints.  This episode, in particular, moved me to tears.
Episode 9: The Fire of His Love - This episode is aimed at prayer.  It briefly describes different types of prayer...petition vs. contemplation...and highlights the lives of several of the Church's greatest contemplatives...St. John of The Cross, Theresa of Avila and Thomas Merton.
Episode 10: World Without End -  Describes Catholic teaching on heaven and hell and the problem of evil.

The real power of this series is the way in which it weaves together theology, history, art, music and human culture into a vivid tapestry that reflects the living and breathing nature of the Catholic Church. This series is a painting; a portrait of the immortal and ongoing; not the blueprint of an ancient cathedral.  That  is why I say that on initial glance one might feel as if something is missing...as if there is more that could have been told.  Of course this is true if we are looking at the Church as a thing of the past that can only be preserved through the encrusted prism of history.  But the very point of this series, I think, is to animate the Church's assertion that she is the Body of Christ and that through Her Christ not only lives but reigns over all of creation. Father Barron could not have  achieved this in any way other than the way he did; by creating a work of art that allows the power of the Holy Spirit to touch each individual viewer.  That is why this series is so great and why no two of us will digest it in exactly the same way.  Bravo Father Barron.  Keep doing what you're doing!!",1325116800,20,3877,4.744047619047619

4712344,5,B005J6U77Q,"I have watched all ten episodes and they are beautiful and moving. There is a reviewer who gave it one star, saying it was like a sleazy real estate commercial due to, for example, wide-angle shots, and condemns it for being bad art analysis. On the first: each to his own taste - but never in a hundred million years would I call this ""sleazy"", and second, go somewhere else for art analysis.

That said, Father Barron is a brilliant intellectual (yes, I've met him and read his works) who has created something ANYONE can enter into, even those who do not read Aquinas or Hans Urs von Balthasar. I made a deal with a very average teenager that if he would watch one, I would let him take the car that night to do whatever he wanted. After one episode, what he wanted to do was stay in and watch two more, and then said he wanted to see the others before Christmas vacation is over. At the same time, I, with a theology PhD, was enthralled. His joy is contagious, and the scenes with the Missionaries of Charity and their love for disabled children call our own hearts to love more. Anyone who would condemn this because of ""artistic"" differences, who cannot see the truth of this active, giving love, the call to our own vocations, could (in the words of CS Lewis), look all over the sky at high noon on a clear day and not see the sun.

This series is quite an accomplishment. Of course there are things we would all like Fr. Barron to go more deeply into, but this is an introduction. If you want more, read his books, like ""The Priority of Christ,"" subscribe to the journal ""Communio"" (do a search for the American edition of the international Catholic review), read the works of Benedict XVI and von Balthasar, etc.

Father Barron is a humble man who has made something that anyone can enjoy, not a ""schlockmeister;"" his work will last far longer and have greater effect than that of any number of ""art historian"" snobs who wanted a focus on Michelangelo's homosexuality (I'm not making this up). This series is understandable and engaging for all kinds of people. No, wide angle lenses, etc.  will not ""convert"" anyone, as our negative reviewer sneers; the test for me is whether people say, ""Wow, I want to know more"" (and yes, that ""more"" can even be deeper art analysis!). And everyone I have given this to or showed it to has said that.

He has the ability to take extremely complicated ideas and to communicate them into words that everyone can understand.  Without a doubt, there are a lot of extraordinarily intelligent, brilliant people out there, but many of them lack the ability to relate to everyday men and women.

In this beautiful exposition of Mother Church it is easy to get caught up in the beauty to the point where it is possible to forget that we are a hospital for sinners.  Christ didn't come for the righteous; he came to heal the sick.  So it is the fruits of grace that are so stunningly beautiful about The Roman Catholic Church, but so starkly contrasted by the sinful behavior of the body. We must not fall for the trap of judging the Church by its greatest sinners, but by its principles and Truth.  We must look to the Saints to catch a glimpse of the magnificent Truth, as they are the ones in the Church who live most closely by her principles. (Fr. Thomas Dubay)

Through this excellent documentary we see the  richness of the intellectual, spiritual, philosophical, artistic, and religious traditions that comprise our Church.  It is a glory to behold and a joy to be in communion with the Saints through the Body of Christ.

4712362,5,B005J6U77Q,"As the undersigned mentioned in other reviews, he does not view visual media very often and rarely writes favorably of video presentations. Yet, the video series title CATHOLICISM produced by Father Roger Barron facinated and impressed this reviewer. Father Barron  effectively articulates Catholicism with lectures and vivid scenes from shrines and Catholic Churches throughout the world.

Father Barron began this series with an explantion of the early history of the Catholic Church. He explained the Greek language origins of the word Catholic which meant universal and still does given the international nature of the Catholic Church. Father Barron explained why Rome became the center of the international Catholic Church. He informed readers that St. Peter and St. Paul were martyred in Rome as were many of the early Catholic saints.

One point that Father Barron emphasized was that the unity of the Catholic Church is not based on a ""totalitarian"" system of control but on a unique inclusiveness that accepted what benefitted the Faith and rejected what was harmful. For example, Father Barron mentioned the usefulness of Ancient Greek philosophy such as Plato (427-247 BC) and Aristole(384-322 BC) whose work was often cited by early Christians such as St. Augustine (354-430 AD). Readers may know the outstanding work St. Aquinas (1225-1274)who utilized Aristotle' emphasis on reason to enshrine the Catholic Faith.

Father Barron did not avoid discussing other religions. Like St. Thomas Aquinas, Father Baron briefly discusses Hinduism, Islam, etc. He gave due respect to their  religious concepts. He made an interesting remark when he stated that we needed a good religious arguement which is now seriously lacking. Most ""religious"" commentary is shouting, ad hominem stupidity, and self posturing. Yet, historically many fameous Catholics have actively engaged those of different religious views. For example, St. Francis of Assisi (1170-1226)went into Moslem military camps to convert and evangelize. He was not very successful, but militant Moslems respected St. Francis so much that they welcomed him and NEVER threatened him. How St. Francis was able to do this is beyond the comprehension of the this reviewer.

Father Barron then discussed the diversity of the saints who were very different. St. Thomas Aquinas was scholarly and a superb intellectual. On the other hand, St. Francis of Assisi was not intellectual at all, but he showed considerable compassion and mercy. To refute the false notion that Catholics oppress women, Father Barron cited for modern women who became saints. St. Therese(1873-1888)lived to be only 24 and was hardly known until her work was read and published. St. Katherine Drexel (1858-1953) was born into wealth and used her inheritance to help teach poor blacks and indians. St Edith Stein (1891-1942)was born into an Orthodox Jewish family and, during a time of spiritual darkness, converted to Catholicism, joined a Carmelite Order, and was a first-rate scholar. She died in a concentration camp. Blessed Mother Teresa (1910-1997)knew little of nuns, but she became a nun and followed Chrit's teaching to help the poor, the very poorest in India, and was tough enough make her order work and successful. Father Baron's pictural presentations gave viewers a graphic description of how important these women were.

Father Barron effectively used visuals and reason to explain the ""Last Things"" which are death, judgement, heaven, hell, and purgatory. Father Barrron used Dante's (1265-1321)THE DIVINE COMEDY to explain hell. Father Baron argued that self absorbtion and self gratification lead to a ""fall"" and placed Satan at the bottom of hell frozen in time and so depressed he did not notice his visitors. Father Baron paraphrased G.K. Chesterton (1874-1936)who said the angles and saints went up because they took themselves lightly and were not self absorbed. When Father Barron discussed purgatotry, he showed a video of an Irish island where penitents undergo ordeals of walking without shoes and engage in constant prayer for reflection.

Father Barron's commentary on Paradise is very thoughtful. He is clear that we can know and learn so much about the material world via science. However, he uses the ontoligical arguement to justify a belief beyobnd the material world. His explanation of the Rose Window in the Notre Dame Cathedral was interesting. He explained the symbolism of the Rose Window and how its exquisite beauty led viewers to a realization of something more impressive.

Father Barron not only effectively used visuals and clear lecturing to entice readers to careful thought and reflection, he also cited fameous Catholic intellectuals and briefly but effectively explained their concepts. Father Barron showed he was versatile re languages with clear explanations of Latin and Greek phrases that have been important to Catholic history and theology. In other words, language and thought have been important to the Catholic history.

Again, this reviewer rarely views let along recommends videos. However, this presentation was well done and can appeal to religious, lay men and women, non-Catholics and anyone who appreciates beauty and intellectual stimulation.

4712364,5,B005J6U77Q,"This film is a wonderful catechetical exposition of the Catholic faith.  Unlike so many dvd's which expound on what the Catholic Church believes and teaches with one speaker directing his talks from classroom or pulpit, this dvd holds as its backdrop the great artwork of Christendom as well as the beauty of creation.  The talks are concise and clear, citing great philosophers and theologians for authority while also appealing to simple reason, being equally accessible to both scholar and neophyte.  Expositions of the various topics are easily understood by the casual inquirer while providing depth enough to satisfy the more spiritually advanced.  This dvd set would be excellent for use with an RCIA program, either as part of the presentation or as a resource to prepare a talk.

In short, this is one of the best single resources now available in video for coming to understand the Catholic faith.  It is my belief that anyone finding great fault with it shows a very anti-Catholic prejudice that no argument, no matter how well thought out and presented, would be able to overcome.  In short, if you want to hate the Church, you will.  But to those who can listen with an open mind and open heart, this series will be well-received... and to those who are Catholic, these talks will bring about a deeper appreciation and understanding of the faith and of the riches presented therein.",1321401600,14,1395,4.906382978723404

It is well done, the scenery is breath taking, and the teaching is insightful, entertaining and informative. Father Barron is very easy to listen to.",1321228800,9,309,4.5
4712366,4,B005J6U77Q,"As you can see by the product link below, this set of DVDs is best utilized with the companion book also by Father Robert Barron and by the same name.

As was pointed out to me, my original review did not explain my statement about this set being a ""comprehensive"" view of Catholicism.  Obviously no such animal exists in 2000 years of documents and development of theology and I think most readers would realize this. Nevertheless in the interest of clarity I am re-writing this to state that point.

What I was suggesting, however, and I stand by this, is that this set is indeed meant to be at least ""fairly comprehensive,"" which was the term I in fact had used, and particularly I was speakings in reference to its use on secular media such as PBS.  As such it has the golden opportunity to introduce a whole unchurched or ""other-churched"" audience to the basics which we as Catholics believe and why. And this is an unprecedented accomplishment by a fine representative of the Catholic Church.

Father Barron does a valiant job of this in my opinon, and extensively quotes early Church Fathers and theologians throughout the lavishly illustrated and breathtaking series.  One thing I believe he perhaps missed would have been to interview or otherwise have included some segments from current Church theologians and leadership. He travelled the world for 4 years to do this series, and I am quite sure he had contact with many of them during this process.

It would have been great in my opinion to have included some of their faces and voices, if for no other reason than as a contrast/complement to his own.  Otherwise there can be the danger of presenting a ""one person show"" of sorts, particularly to those non-Catholics watching who may not be familiar with our many fine Bishops, Cardinals, and theologians, as well as the Holy Father himself. It would also have brought direct rather than indirect contributions from them and that is of course healthy.

That would really be the only thing I would change. It is also a weakness that could be very possibly corrected in future editings of this series, which is why I constructively bring it up now, and also why I rate this DVD/book set a 4 instead of a 5.

4712370,5,B005J6U77Q,"Through his excellent website (Word on Fire), YouTube videos, public presentations, recorded retreats, and many books (both popular and scholarly), Fr. Robert Barron has shown himself to be one of the most effective, likeable, and gifted Catholic commentators alive today.  He has a talent for explaining the core elements of the Catholic faith in the clearest and most engaging way possible, as quick to quote Bob Dylan as Thomas Aquinas or G. K. Chesterton.  One often hears comparisons between Fr. Barron and the great Fulton Sheen, and while the comparison may not apply in terms of style I would certainly agree where the substance of their teaching is concerned.  Inspired by Sir Kenneth Clark's 1969 BBC series Civilisation, Fr. Barron set out some years ago to do something similar for the Catholic faith, believing that the story of the Catholic Church is being told by too many people who are getting it wrong on a number of levels.  This series is the grand and glorious result, a labor of love by one who loves the Catholic faith and wants as many people as possible to understand it in its fullness.  There is much to commend this series, but I think what really sets it apart -- aside from the glorious visuals and the contemporary spins on traditional music -- is that Fr. Barron refuses to water down the intellectual riches of the Catholic faith in an effort to appeal to a wider audience.  This is no dumbed-down Catholicism, and yet it's not the least bit stuffy or dry.  If you want a real boost for yourself, or if you have always looked for a good resource to share with your non-Catholic friends or family, look no further than this DVD series and its companion book!",1319673600,39,1690,4.708474576271186
4712371,5,B005J6U77Q,"I have watched the whole series several times and cannot recommend it too highly.  Beautifully produced (on a shoestring), intelligent, lucid, engaging, the series (like Catholicism itself) works on several levels.  The Church has gone through a dark period, 40 years in the wilderness of self-inflicted wounds - scandal and a kind of beige accommodation to the times that produced some of the worst liturgical excesses, music, art, and architecture in the Church's history.

Father Barron does not dodge the issues that have preoccupied critics of the Church from within and without, but he does not let them set his agenda.  Instead the series tells the Church's own story, restoring the color and beauty of the faith as an incarnational and sacramental religion like no other.  Barron explores the relation of faith to reason, of Christian religion to science, of sensuous art and mystical experience to theology and philosophy.

Drawing on some of the greatest analytic minds of the past two millennia as well as the Church's mystics, artists, architects, and poets, Barron offers us a rich tapestry of the faith and its adherents throughout the world.  Some of the images of piety and devotion of masses of ordinary people in Uganda and at Fatima, as well of the living patrimony of great art and architecture, are unforgettable.

I recommend watching (and buying if possible) the whole series.  It is organized thematically rather than as historical narrative.  Every theme reinforces and speaks to all the others.  All are expounded through engaging and clarifying stories, similes, and images.  Barron draws us in from the start with an arresting challenge to the mushy view that reduces Jesus to a great teacher, like other religious founders, even a kind of Deepak Chopra of his day.  But his followers were ""amazed and afraid"" in the presence of the God-Man, who asked his disciples, not what people thought of his teachings, but who they said he was.  The challenge is that Christianity confronts us with a stark choice - either Jesus was who he said he was (in which case we owe him everything) or he was a bad man who deluded himself and others.  This challenge is at the heart of Rabbi Jacob Neusner's imagined dialogue with Jesus (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Rabbi-Talks-With-Jesus/dp/0773520465/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Rabbi Talks With Jesus</a>) and Pope Benedict's engagement with Neusner (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jesus-of-Nazareth-From-the-Baptism-in-the-Jordan-to-the-Transfiguration/dp/1586171984/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jesus of Nazareth: From the Baptism in the Jordan to the Transfiguration</a>).

The series is an extraordinary contribution to the ""New Evangelization"" proclaimed by Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI.  As such it will appeal to those Catholics, especially the young, who yearn for an orthodox, confident, holy Catholicism. It will inform and challenge others whose only knowledge of the faith derives from its critics and enemies. For those who, with a few knock-down arguments, condemn unheard the Church and its profound contribution to (especially but not only) Western civilization, science, ethics, and culture, this is a unique opportunity to hear the other side.

4712372,5,B005J6U77Q,"Fr Barron has attempted to explain Catholicism from the inside out- that is, from the Catholic perspective. Any religion can only really be understood from those who have stepped into its perspective, much like a player in a sport must ""enter into"" the rules and spirit of a game to truly compete. No Olympic athlete ever won a Gold while thinking critically about it as an outsider or refusing to buy into their sport's spirit. Barron has provided exactly that for Catholicism, and in style!

Beyond the beautifully photographed and musically accompanied images, Barron provides a deeply insightful narrative that gives life to those images and slowly but intelligently unpacks the beauty of the Church as only a Catholic can see it. As a Catholic, I have already seen and experienced much of what he talks about. Yet many aspects of his narrative are refreshingly new to me. Overall I have been deeply impressed with Barron's discussion in the series and his ability to catch and explain rather profound truths in an easily approachable manner.

Fr Barron is no intellectual wimp. He is obviously widely read, and knows the tradition well. He is at home in modern and ancient philosophy and the Patristics. Barron continually ties his narrative into modern day history and culture. And boy does he travel. I got exhausted just thinking about how much travel went into this series.

I recommend this to anyone who really wants to understand the Church from someone who KNOWS the Church. Fr Barron avoids being triumphalistic and cocky and instead is engaging and passionate. He avoids stereotypes and trite overly-simplistic spiritual cliches. He lets the art speak for itself.

In short it is a very cool series. I highly recommend it.",1317081600,185,1737,4.979310344827586
