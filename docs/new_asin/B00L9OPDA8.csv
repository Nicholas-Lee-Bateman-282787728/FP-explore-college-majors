6478005,5,B00L9OPDA8,Why in the world did this take so long to be released? This was one of the most ground breaking shows. The first time Billie Jean was performed by Micheal Jackson? Oh my!!,1413417600,3,171,4.212121212121212

6478007,3,B00L9OPDA8,"Overall, if you've never seen this program-- ""Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever""-- you're in for a huge, memorable treat.  It's one of the great TV variety shows ever, an Emmy-award-winner that was slickly produced, bringing back virtually all of the major Motown acts of the 1960s and 70s, also Michael Jackson during the first year of the Thriller album (not a Motown album) performing ""Billie Jean,"" and he and his brothers performing a medley of their old Motown hits immediately before that.  You get to see Marvin Gaye in a moving, fantastic performance of ""What's Going On"" just a year before his father murdered him.  You get to see virtually all of the Motown greats looking still young and vibrant, and performing wonderfully, esp. the Temptations, Four Tops, the Jackson 5, Smokey Robinson & the Miracles, Diana Ross & the Supremes, Stevie Wonder, Lionel Richie, Junior Walker, and Martha Reeves (the latter two very briefly), Smokey doing some of his hits later in duet with Linda Ronstadt, and LOTS more.  There were informative pieces presented in this 1983 show, including one by Dick Clark.  They'd have brief insertions at the commercial breaks of old footage of Motowners on certain TV shows (such as a 12 y.o. Michael Jackson on a TV variety show in 1971), and even Berry Gordy Jr. on ""What's My Line"" in 1966.  Really, this broadcast was magnificently produced.  It was intended in part to educate the viewer on the Motown story and history, and did well in this regard.  (Though Richard Pryor as host was weak, out of his element, and made repeated mistakes in reading the cue cards.)

As a 31-year-lover of this classy, very-well-produced, and deservedly Emmy-award-winning show since it aired in 1983, and being intimately familiar with every second of this show, I will offer a few comments that are not all completely positive.  This is a balanced, ACCURATE review, and I hope you don't vote it down merely because hearing the truth, and some negative-but-true facts, may tick you off.  I am presenting FACTS here (as someone who has viewed all versions of this show), not opinions, for the most part.

Sure, the DVD picture quality is even sharper than the (very sharp) commercial VHS tape offered back in the mid-1980s, but only barely so on a classic pre-2001) tube-style TV, for which this show was always intended-- again, the difference on THAT TV between the DVD and the older VHS tape is nearly non-existent (I compared both the DVD and VHS tape, head-to-head).  However, on a modern Hi-Def TV, the picture quality of the DVD is noticeably better (a little sharper and a lot brighter) than that of the VHS tape.  Of course, this then begs the question: Why didn't they issue this on blu-ray?  Unfortunately, Time-Life continually issues their movies and TV shows on DVD, yet the ONLY TV sets selling in stores for years are Hi-Definition.  Thus, the picture quality of this DVD is pretty WEAK on an HD TV, as is the case with all DVDs, since the only disc made for HD TVs is a blu-ray-- NOT a DVD.  Anyone who says this looks ""good"" on an HD TV isn't being honest-- as anything new OR OLD shown in hi-definition through your cable company looks MUCH, MUCH better than this.  (This is presented in the old 4x3 screen format (or ""aspect ratio""), about which I'm not complaining, since it was produced for the only TV screen format available in those days, 4x3.)

And this reminds me-- WHY wait 30 years to put this TV program on DVD, when this could have been done in 1998 or 1999-- at that point, still 15+ years after the show aired, but now in late 2014, 30-year-olds WEREN'T EVEN ALIVE in 1983 to know of this show or have any desire for it today.

Back to the DVD itself: the program is NOT 20 minutes longer than previous versions, as advertised on the DVD's package, at 2 hours 4 minutes-- it is a few minutes SHORTER than the commercial VHS tape.  Maybe this was longer than the original broadcast of May, 1983, which I viewed on TV when it aired, but I didn't tape that one, remove the commercials, and look at the running time.  But, again, compared with the very sharp commercial VHS tape that was issued back then, the program on the DVD is not one second longer . . . instead, it is a few (approx. 4-5) minutes shorter.

Content: the content of the 2hr 4 min show has been altered in several places, yet most folks wouldn't notice it, and all the changes add up to under 30 seconds' worth.  In pretty much ALL of the career highlights montages that were shown prior to a live act (for example, in a film-highlights piece that Smokey Robinson introduced about Motown's groups), they removed some very brief, COOL footage of The Commodores, Martha and the Vandellas, and Gladys Knight and the Pips.  And then they inserted DIFFERENT, inferior footage for these same groups.  Why?  Doubtless, for this DVD, they couldn't secure the rights to certain footage, taken from various US and British TV shows.  The stuff they inserted, by contrast, is totally UNCOOL in ALL cases, and it sucks-- the performers look stiff and worse.  This occurs in other montage pieces in the program, including highlights of the Supremes' career before they are introduced at the end of the show.  Just to be clear: the montage pieces are all MOSTLY intact vs. 1983, on this DVD they just removed and replaced a 2-second clip here and there, keeping most of the original clips but changing a few.

The extras: the featurette on disc 1 about the ""Making of"" the show was excellent.  Could have been better, but was quite good, interesting and informative.  Exactly 30 minutes long.

The rest of the extras-- YIKES!  BAD.  Mostly they kept the very same 3-4 people in each of them-- Suzanne DePasse (rightly included in the extras since she was the exec producer who was the key person, without question), Smokey Robinson, Otis Williams of the Temptations, and Duke Fakir of the Four Tops.  Or, some of the producers and a writer.  ALL of these other features, all of which were made in 2014, were boring, fairly dumb, of little informative value, and it just looked like they were going to make extra after extra, with huge overlap to them, to somehow make us feel we're getting a great package in 3 DVDs (Time-Life actually offers this on SIX discs, with many more extras, for $79.95!!!  Unbelievable.  The only extra from the 6-DVD set that I'd want to see is the extended discussion between the songwriters from back in 1983.).  Quite the ripoff.  I got the 3-disc version at Costco for $18.99 and felt ripped off both buying it at that price, and then much more so after viewing everything.

The downsides in summary (since I summarized the good stuff at the top!): again, it's not a blu-ray, so it looks soft-focus and weak on your HD TV compared with last night's news or last week's football game-- or a 1975 movie broadcast in high-definition, via your HD cable provider.  Yet it's so easy for them to have issued this as a blu ray.  The extras are just way too overlapping, and generally poor efforts as well, apart from the ""Making of"" documentary, so this set is quite the rip-off.  The DVD is NOT, as advertised, 20 minutes longer than the VHS tape, but shorter, and they altered each of the old highlights montages vs. when the show aired in 1983 and vs. the commercial VHS tape available in the 1980s.  Lastly, waiting 30 years to issue a TV show seems . . . stupid.  Half the people who viewed it originally are dead, and anyone who was at least 12 years old in 1983 (old enough to have watched it then and even known who all the stars were), is now 43-- so people under 43 or so will have little interest, stifling sales of this DVD.

As an aside, the Motown 30- and 35-year anniversary TV shows were terrible.  This 25th anniversary show was the best by far, and it's not even close.

I'd recommend getting the 1-disc version of this, available on Amazon for $10.99 plus shipping, at this writing.

I hope this review helps you make an informed buying decision either way.  Fans of this show (as I am), please don't hate me for telling you honestly the FACTS about this 3-DVD set.  Thanks!

DEC. 28, 2014 UPDATE:

I concur with a few of those commenters below this review who discovered other omissions from the main broadcast on this DVD. Indeed, the entire T.G. Sheppard performance, which I recall(?) occurred immediately before that of Jose Feliciano, was excluded from the broadcast as presented on this DVD, though it was on the commercial VHS tape. This would account for the several-minutes-shorter running time of the DVD vs. the commercial VHS tape.

Also, I have noticed that some of the brief shots of Berry Gordy, Jr. and Diana Ross sitting together in the audience were removed, per a couple of commenters' posts below, too. A key example (here being Gordy alone) would be near the end of the broadcast, when Diana Ross, now onstage, concluded her spoken remarks by raising a fist, clearly in solidarity, to Gordy, who was in the upper level of the audience seats.  He responded by showing two fists back and then opening them, as I recall; but his entire response was edited out of the DVD broadcast. I'll take a guess at the reason: perhaps the DVD's producers, doubtless including Motown people, honored an unknown somebody's request to remove any byplay between Diana Ross and Berry Gordy, and even remove shots of them sitting together.",1413331200,137,9393,4.661613098847787
6478008,5,B00L9OPDA8,"Motown is arguably the most important and successful label of its time. No other label has brought such an impressive Mount Rushmore of Superstars to the fore. From Stevie Wonder to Diana Ross to Marvin Gaye to Michael Jackson to Smokey Robinson to The Supremes, The a Temptations, The Four Tops, The Miracles and The Jackson 5!!! And that's just the first string leaving off Lionel Richie, Rick James, The Commodores, etc. In 1983, this music conglomerate gathered nearly their entire roster (past and present) to celebrate its 25th Anniversary.
""Motown 25"" not only saluted its laudable accomplishments, but, also created a wildly entertaining 3 hours to talent and grand showmanship. It became the water cooler conversation topic for weeks on end in the early days of home video recording.
Marvin Gaye, gave an emotional dialogue before a truly touching rendition of one of the greatest songs/albums of all time...the immensely relevant, ""What's Goin' On"", The Temptations battled The Four Tops in a grand sing-off that triggered a soldout tour that is still produced 30 years later, Diana ""Queen of Motown"" gave the first spontaneous exciting moment as she made an unplanned appearance during Adam Ant's weird and wondrous rendition of ""Where Did Our Love Go?"", Smokey Robinson floated in and out with great performances as Stevie rocked the house from ""Uptight"" to songs from ""Songs in the Key of Life"", Richard Pryor effortlessly hosted the evening with humor and cleverness....though Diana reluctantly joined a tad hefty Cindy Birdsong and a wicked witch marywilson, determined to cause controversy as she had begun hinting the rotten fruit of her poisin pen and most of all, Michael and Jermaine Jackson reunited with The Jackson 5 before a spine-thrilling, amazingly brief but stunning take on the very Motown-sounding ""Billie Jean"".
All this was due to the vision of the master, Mr. Berry Gordy who the night was dedicated to!
To top it off, ""Motown 25"" broke all Neilsen records winning the week (Motown's 2nd Special to accomplish this feat) and won an amazing 14 Emmy Nods winning the coveted ""Best Music & Variety Special""!
This 3-DVD package transports you back to 1983 with pure entertainment sans MTV editing.......an iconic moment not just in music history, but, in entertainment history in general!!!",1413158400,,2319,5.137566137566138
6478009,5,B00L9OPDA8,"Yay!!!  I have been wanting this on DVD for years!  I was a lil' bitty thing when this was on T.V. in 83', so what I've seen of the show many years ago was on VHS.  It's awesome that with this set, not only do we get an extended version of the show, but we are also privy to some behind the scenes footage of rehearsals and stories.  All I have to say is, ""It's about Time!""  Thank you Ms. Suzanne de Passe, Don Mischer, Buz Kohan, and Ruth Adkins Robinson for finally releasing this and doing it right.  This is truly history, and it don't get no better than this.

Now, if they could just release Thriller along with the Destiny,Triumph, and Victory tours...Priceless!",1412899200,17,670,4.312
6478010,5,B00L9OPDA8,what a night period?  the Greatest Music Man Ever in Berry Gordy and a fitting tribute to the label that made the whole world sing.  the sound of young america.  no other label has had the  depth of musical  talent and so  many legendary  acts all on one label.  this  show had a lot of great performances. Marvin Gaye  was high and he tore those piano keys up.  stevie wonder  was cool that night.  the  temptations and the four tops did their thing as well.  other acts were cool.  however  the Jacksons threw down.  Michael  Jackson  forever put himself with the best of the bests ever with a performance that cemented his legacy and also things were never the same.  MJ tore that Joint up. these folks coming along now will never know what it was like to have  a label so celebrated whee so many great talents emerged and changed the course of popular music.  once in a lifetime talents and show.  this was the Greatest  network performance that i have ever seen.  must have repeated viewings.,1412467200,45,997,4.46067415730337

After viewing a VHS tape of this show that I originally recorded 25 years ago, this new version three DVD set is beyond what any
Motown fan could wish for. Pristine quality transfer with 5.1 sound make this an even more enjoyable experience then when this show was first broadcast.
Having seen Motown: The Musical and recently visited Hitsville USA in Detroit, I am overjoyed that this package has finally come out.

6478020,5,B00L9OPDA8,"Of course, Michael Jacksons hallmark  performance is what everyone automatically thinks of when they hear  Motown 25. Michael Jackson reuniting with the Jackson 5, performing  Billie Jean, and doing the  moonwalk is the type of jaw dropping performance that you will never ever see on television again! But make no mistake about it, Motown 25 was chock full of great performers. So many legends graced the stage: Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, The Temptations, the four tops, Smokey Robinson, Diana Ross and the Supremes, Debarge, and on and on and on. If you're a music lover, this will be the most entertaining, and the fastest 2 hours that you will ever watch.

Im so glad they finally put this masterpiece on DVD! The behind the scenes interviews were insightful as well. The title says it all,  Yesterday, Today, and Forever is right. Motown 25 is a timeless display of musical excellence!",1514332800,2,891,4.906666666666666

I was led to believe from various web sites that this 2016 re-relase added additional content to the main Motown 25 program.  This is incorrect.  As you can see above, there is no difference between the original 2014 and 2016 re-release sets.  In fact, while the back of the box set lists the date as 2016, the two individual 3 disc cases inside the box lists the date as 2014, meaning they just repurposed the 2014 set and put it in a box with a new date.  The two included booklets are identical as well.  (Note that the replica of the program given to attendees at the actual event is more of a pamphlet than a booklet).

The previous review of the 2014 set by Allen Jackson lists all the important changes and omissions from the original broadcast and the fact that the DVD was shorter by 4 mins than the VHS.  I saw the original broadcast, owned the VHS and then upgraded to the 2014 Best Buy 3 disc set.  My decision to pick up the 2016 - 6 disc set was mainly the promise of additional material on the main program (20 extra mins. would have brought the program to 144 mins!) but as was the case in 2014, there is no additional material included.  The other reason was to see the full length 1983 songwriters roundtable featurette on disc 4.  Only seven minutes from this 68min segment were featured in the original broadcast and this was my favorite part of the show (besides the live performances).  I figured that alone might be worth the price of admission.  Is this set worth the extra cost?  That depends on how much the great 68min songwriters roundtable is worth to you.  The other featuretts and interviews that make up the remainder of discs 4-6 (total length 521:17) very in content and quality.  Die hards are going to enjoy all the extra info.  The average viewer, not so much.  Overall, four stars just for the quality of the original program and the shear volume of extras.

Finally, this special was taped, not filmed, meaning it would not benefit from a blu-ray release.  The same reason why classic TV shows like The Dick Van Dyke Show and Love Lucy (shot on film) look so spectacular on blu-ray, while others like Married With Children and SOAP (videotaped in SD) have not been released on blu-ray as there would be no visual benefit to such a release.",1485820800,40,3653,4.6114551083591335

6478060,5,B00L9OPDA8,"Although this is a 3 disk set you only need to watch the one disk of the actual show. It's unbelievable to see the talent pool that Motown was. There is nothing today that compares to this music and the presentations. Someone like Beyonc, who is a talent, doesn't come close to these performances. Back then you didn't come on the stage via a trapeze or a rocket ship or some sort of distraction. You also didn't come out half naked which is also a distraction from the actual talent of the performers. You heard the Motown sound without any amped up productions. The music itself was great and still trumps most anything today when it comes to some sort of soulful music. The bonus material is plentiful and enjoyable to watch. You will not be disappointed with this package.",1484006400,,776,4.55

6478064,5,B00L9OPDA8,"Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever contains performances from the May 16, 1983 NBC-TV special celebrating the artists who rose to fame recording for Motown Records and made the label a formidable force in pop music. Taped before a live audience, the event showcases virtually every Motown artist from the companys inception, including Michael Jackson, Marvin Gaye, Smokey Robinson, Stevie Wonder, Diana Ross, The Supremes, The Jackson 5, The Miracles, The Temptations, and The Four Tops.

Several artists outside the Motown family who were influenced by Motown performers also appear, including Linda Ronstadt, who performs a duet with Smokey Robinson; Billy Dee Williams; and Jose Feliciano. The evening was hosted by Richard Pryor, one of the hottest comedians at the time. The concert provided the backstory for the Tony-nominated Broadway show Motown: The Musical.

The highlight is Michael Jackson, whose Thriller album was breaking sales records. Since he was recording for another label at the time, it was never certain he would appear to pay homage to the label that launched his career, but there he was, with his brothers, reprising some of The Jackson 5s hits. It was his solo performance of Billie Jean and his trademark moonwalk, however, that brought the house down and presented to the world the adult Jackson strutting his stuff.

The concert also included a Temptations/Four Tops battle of the bands, Marvin Gayes speech about black music history and his performance of Whats Going On, and an abbreviated reunion of Diana Ross and The Supremes, who performed their final Number 1 hit, Someday Well Be Together. Other featured performers included Lionel Ritchie, The Commodores, Martha Reeves, Gladys Knight and the Pips, and The Marvelettes.

The 6-DVD box set contains 20 minutes not seen in the original broadcast, over 14 hours of specially produced bonus features, and a 48-page collectors booklet with detailed information about the show and artists as well as never-before-seen photos from the production and essays on Motown performers.",1475193600,,2063,5.319018404907975

6478122,5,B00L9OPDA8,"Words can't even explain (but I'll try!) how excited I was to hear that FINALLY after over 30 years, Motown 25 would get a proper DVD release.

I literally grew up watching this special, when I was a kid, my parents taped the original tv broadcast on VHS and I was absolutely obsessed with it. This was the music I was growing up to. The Temptations, Diana, Marvin, Smokey, and of course, Michael. I can't even tell you how many times I watched Michael sing Billie Jean and twirl across that stage, rewinding the tape over and over studying each of his movies. And for the last 30 years, this was all I had to watch these amazing performances. An old VHS tape (this tape was literally the only reason why I even still owned a VCR player) that was actually a year older than me.

When I saw the release that Motown 25 would finally be brought to DVD, I was in tears (yes, literally). The program is exactly how I've always remembered it. The first disc is the actual program (with some extended performances not shown on the original airing), and extras detailing the making of the special (if you like behind the scenes stuff like I do, you'll enjoy this). I purchased the 3 disk version, which I highly enjoyed as I love behind the scenes talk. If you're not into hearing people reminiscence, then you're better off just purchasing the 1 disk version.

It may sound a little silly, but this program meant a lot to me growing up, and it still does. This is a beautiful presentation and highly recommended for anyone who is a fan of Motown, Michael Jackson or music history.",1450224000,,1573,4.454861111111111

I have it on VHS (shows how old I am), and saw it when it aired the 80's, and was a little shocked how one artist was omitted from the dvd when this artist was clearly part of Motown and was on the show....if you get a chance to get this box set, which by the way, is fantastic, and remember the lineup of artists who appeared for the celebration, you will see that one artist was ""removed"" from the show... this artist was edited out of the list of people credited to perform on the show AND if you watch the scene where the big ""M"" turns and Jose Felicano starts to perform, there is ""someone"" walking off the stage THAT is the omitted performer...don't know why...and was never talked about in the behind the scenes...but still it's great to look back on history in the making and appreciate what Motown has done and the impact they have had on our lives for the last 50+ years!!!!",1431648000,4,976,4.224598930481283

After reading several reviews I ordered the one disc version and it turns out it's all I need. And I've been wondering how I missed this release when it was first issued on VHS. The Four Tops, The Jackson Five, The Supremes, Marvin Gaye, The Temptations, Gladys Knight, they are all here. This disc offers two solid hours of entertainment. It is interspersed with archival footage that takes us back to the early years, and it is very well done.

The video quality of the disc is very good. The audio offers both 5.1 stereo and 2 channel PCM stereo. Selecting 2 channel on the disc plus PCM audio on my Sony amplifier generates a richer (all speakers) sound than the 5.1 option.",1429574400,,851,4.525974025974026

I am certain that the single disc version would be well worth the $26 or so? but I purchased the 6 (six) disc version and could not be more upset with what is ended up being paid for? FIRST DISC: the actual concert (VERY,VERY HISTORIC and valuable!!!!) disc 2 through 6 only interviews with writers, some artists and staff???? Could not believe that staff and promoters were all WHITE! (I am also WHITE) thought they had some nerve promoting themselves on such an occasion that may have marked the ending of Black artist exploitation!!!  The disc's 2 thru 6 could only have a once through value and possibly some other if you were doing a term paper on MOTOWN.  They should remove the 2 thru 6 disc or sell them as one disc for $20....

So many stars on one stage, all performing at the peak of their success.  This is where Michael Jackson debuted the moon walk.  I remember reading that he cried after performing, as he thought it wasn't good enough.  Yet, every pair of eyeballs could not believe what we were witnessing.  It was stone cold magic.

I am very disappointed because it has been edited and several of the performers were missing.  I really wanted to see them!  This is a 3 DVD set.  WHY they edited the show is beyond me because they added chats between some performers that were very boring.  They should have left the show in it's entirely and it would have been perfect.

Now, as for the person I bought it from:  NO complaints at all.  I would do business with this person again.  Good service and relatively quick.",1424822400,3,610,4.271929824561403

6478338,4,B00L9OPDA8,"Fantastic collection. One disc is the TV special itself, and the other two are behind-the-scenes featurettes and historical pieces. My only complaint is that there is a fair amount repetition here among the additional features. That keeps it from being five stars, but this still is worthy of viewing even if you have only a passing interest in Motown. And despite what has said about this special for years, the best moment actually was NOT Michael Jackson's dance to ""Billie Jean."" That, to me, is superseded by Stevie Wonder's performance as well as Marvin Gaye's. And the background and context given by all of those involved in the production is just stellar.",1423958400,2,664,4.9375

Michael Jackson doing the moonwalk for the first time is regarded as the highlight of the dvd, but i enjoyed Smoky Robinson, the Temptations, 4 Tops, Marvin Gaye, the Supremes etc. just as much.  It's definitely an item for the Motown music lover.  I was going to buy the 6 disc dvd set , but decided after reading a previous review that this was all i needed.

6478350,5,B00L9OPDA8,"Why Motown kept this spectacular, history-making night of musical entertainment locked in their vaults for over 30 years is a mystery. Though LP, VHS, and LaserDisc recordings exist, no DVD of it was released until 2014, when one-, three-, and six-disc editions came out with hours of retrospective interviews, rehearsal footage, and featurettes; there's still nothing on CD or Blu-ray (though the image quality of the show really doesn't justify a Blu-ray release). The live two-hour television special, recorded in Pasadena, California, in March of 1983, both honored Motown founder Berry Gordy in the 25th year of the company's existence and benefited research on sickle-cell anemia. Hosted by comedian Richard Pryor, it featured prime performances by Motown's greatest stars (only Gladys Knight and The Pips were absent). The show won Emmy and Peabody Awards and was nominated for a Grammy.

Among the program's many highlights are Michael Jackson doing ""Billie Jean"" and his first recorded moonwalk, Marvin Gaye singing ""What's Going On"" in one of his final performances (he was killed less than a year later), a wonderful Temptations/Four Tops ""battle of the bands,"" and a reunion of Diana Ross & The Supremes on ""Someday We'll Be Together."" There are long medleys by Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, Stevie Wonder, and The Jackson 5, and hits from Martha Reeves (""Heat Wave""), Mary Wells (""My Guy""), Junior Walker (""Shotgun""), The Commodores (""Brick House""), and Jos Feliciano (who pays tribute to the dying Jackie Wilson with ""Lonely Teardrops""). A couple of young, lesser-known acts round out the program: DeBarge and High Inergy.

Non-Motown performers take the stage, too: Linda Ronstadt for two lovely duets with Smokey Robinson (""Ooh Baby Baby"" and ""The Tracks of My Tears"") and Dick Clark to talk about how the television show ""American Bandstand"" helped break Motown to a wider audience. Very oddly, the antic British pop star Adam Ant pops up singing the Supremes' ""Where Did Our Love Go,"" during which Diana Ross impulsively comes out on stage to dance with him, but that's really the only misstep in an otherwise perfect show. You'll learn a lot about the history of Detroit's preeminent record label, listen in on a songwriters' round-table, watch clips of Motown movies hosted by Billy Dee Williams, and see many archival music clips. The excitement of the audience and affection the artists feel for one another is palpable. Nothing has ever matched it or will ever match it for Motown fans.

For those considering a purchase, your choice depends on how devoted a fan you are. The one-disc edition includes the extended version of the Motown 25 concert, a making-of featurette, and a performers' reunion featuring Smokey Robinson, Duke Fakir of the Four Tops, Otis Williams of The Temptations, and executive producer Suzanne de Passe. It should be enough for any casual fan. The three-disc set offered on this page adds a Marvin Gaye rehearsal; featurettes about Gaye, The Temptations and Four Tops, and the Motown company; a reunion roundtable with director Don Mischer, writer Buz Kohan, de Passe, and other executives; and more of the reunion with Robinson, Fakir, and Williams as well as Claudette Robinson of The Miracles and Martha Reeves of Martha and the Vandellas.

The deluxe six-disc box, available from Time-Life, is only for die-hards and completists. It adds a Stevie Wonder rehearsal; featurettes on the history of Motown, the Motown sound, and Smokey Robinson and the Miracles; a complete songwriters' roundtable from 1983 featuring Mickey Stevenson, Norman Whitfield, Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier, Eddie Holland, Harvey Fuqua, and Ron Miller; interviews with Robinson, Whitfield, Holland-Dozier-Holland, Nick Ashford and Valerie Simpson, and others; an entire disc devoted to interviews with every executive, engineer, writer, and agent that Motown could round up; and a large, colorful booklet.

6478421,4,B00L9OPDA8,"An almost magic night of music.  The Miracles were entertaining.  The Supremes together again was touching.  Michael Jackson and his brothers truly electric.  The most soulful, commanding the stage and personal choice was The Four Tops intact.  This DVD certainly belongs in the rack for anybody who loved Motown.  Preventing the reunion from going over the top were some key missing performers.  To a lesser extent The Vandellas and The Marvelettes.  The obvious no shows were David Ruffin and Eddie Kendricks.  David - ""My Girl"", ""Ain't Too Proud To Beg"" and Eddie - ""Just My Imagination"", ""The Way You Do The Things You Do"" were important lead singers in the history of the label.  Live Aid's gain - Hall, Oates, Ruffin and Kendricks was Motown's loss.  So by all means ""Motown 25"" capped off by the genius of Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye and Smokey Robinson is essential.  So is because of music politics consider the Temptations separate DVD release.  This group was the label's  biggest selling male act.  Nothing wrong with The Temptations performance with The Four Tops.  Most of us knew on stage though were two replacement singers and not the real thing.",1418342400,2,1162,4.912371134020619

As for the other two DVDs of the set, I enjoyed the interviews with Susan de Pass and Smokey, Duke, Otis, Marva, Claudette, and the other inside guys.  I liked ""Come  Get These Precious Memories.""  I liked the interviews of the song writers(3rd-DVD) but the interviews with the what I call the ""Executives""...borrrrring!  What was said on the 2nd DVD about Marvin Gaye's performance of ""What's Going On"" and his musical talent was super good.  So there was something good on each DVD.

Anyway, this is a nice collector's item but the interviews don't reveal much about how important and ""magical"" Motown really was.  The interviews should have included 2014 discussions with Diana Ross, Mary Wilson, and Cindy Birdsong; these three are all 70+ years old and probably would have sat down to talk about Motown 25 if they had been asked.  What about The Marvelettes' Katherine Anderson?  Nobody asks her about anything and she and her four group mates achieved Motown's first number one pop hit with ""Please Mr. Postman.""  This new version is missing so much.  What about Berry Gordy?  He can't be too busy at 85 to sit down and talk about Motown.

6478459,5,B00L9OPDA8,"Fantastic performances by all of Motown's important artists of the time.  But I would agree with at least one other reviewer that the 1-DVD version (available from Amazon for $17 at this writing, and from other vendors on this site for as little as $10) is quite sufficient.  The interviews and other trivia on the 3-DVD version are, IMHO, not worth the additional $11-18 you have to pay to get them -- and the 6-DVD set that Time-Life is currently selling for $80 (!) is just ridiculous. The only disc that you're going to watch more than once is the performance disc itself -- so buy that one by itself, save some money, and enjoy.

Update, February 2016: I noticed that Time-Life is once again promoting its 6-disc set, with emphasis on Michael Jackson's first performance of the ""moonwalk"".  ""We can't show it to you here,"" they say. Of course not -- you wouldn't buy anything on the strength of that primitive, laughable version, filmed long before MJ perfected it, and so brief that you'll miss it entirely if you blink.  The best performance of the show, IMO, is Marvin Gaye's; and it's my favorite because his genius is so underrated today, and because his life ended, tragically, so soon thereafter.  So my original review stands: Buy the single DVD, unless you simply must know every bit of production trivia the producers could dredge up; and enjoy great, vintage performances by the original Motown stars in their heydays, including MJ -- despite his early, clumsy moonwalk attempt.",1414800000,9,1494,4.793774319066148

6478470,5,B00L9OPDA8,"Without question, this is one of the single greatest music television specials ever (along with Aloha From Hawaii with Elvis Presley and Sinatra's A Man and His Music).  The entire Motown family, in good health and spirit, put together a mindblowing experience in 1983.  The video and audio quality are outstanding on this presentation and it blows the old VHS copy out of the water.  The mash-up between The Temptations and The Four Tops is a thrilling moment and brings the audience to its feet.  Marvin Gaye, drawing on his church influences, brings soul, jazz, r&b and gospel together in a riviting performance of ""What's Goin On.""  Early pioneer Mary Wells does her classic ""My Guy.""  Michael Jackson, for the first time on television, moon walks.  This was a defining moment for the superstar.  Stevie Wonder and Smokey Robinson run their unforgettable classics.  A young group with so much promise, Debarge, performs ""All This Love.""  Diana Ross, one of music's greatest divas, brings it all together at the close.

I never quite understood what Adam Ant was doing in this special doing a Supremes' cover.  Apparently the original Supremes were never able to reunite.  This Motown special has heart because it played tribute to the writers and the musicians.  One segment features the wonderful writers that made Motown special.

This unforgetable broadcast includes a heartfelt tribute from Dick Clark and hosting by then healthy Richard Pryor.  Throughout the gala it feels totally authentic and genuine.

One of Detroit's greatest contribution to culture, this special will not disappoint.",1414022400,33,1599,5.159533073929961
6478471,2,B00L9OPDA8,"While I thought back in the day this was a block buster of a show, it really hasn't stood the test of time.  Seeing it again I needed to grab a glass o' wine to watch all the cheese!

The high points of course are the late M. Jackson and his brothers performing. So nice to have this video of M. Jackson looking well and giving not only a touching reunion with the J5 but his classic ""Billy Jean"".  Also Smokey Robinson singing with Linda Ronstadt. It's also mixed with sadness that now Linda is unable to sing due to her illness and Smokey's face now looks like Joan Rivers' did even after she died.

The Temp/Four Tops section was wonderful.

There of course is lots of filler that basically screwed over people like Martha Reeves and the Vandella's. They let her have just a tiny part when she was a BIG part of the history of Motown.  Same with the late and great Mary Wells.  Shame that Ms. Susy DuPase or whatever her name is didn't give a flying rats butt.

Then there's LOW parts.  De Garbage Barge and High Voltage or Energy got more air time than trying to promote their so called ""music"" at the expense of Motown classic performers.  Then we come to what was probably the LOWEST point of the show.  Miss Adam Ant.  La Ant was a big *cough* *cough* ""star"" at the time and swished out to caterwaul the Supreme's classic ""Where Did Our Love Go"".  Uh, why Ms. DuPunt did you sign of on this crap?  Of course that brings on Miss Attention Hog, D. Ross to act like a truck stop stripper on stage to try and fuel her ego prior to her next stunt.

So since we are speaking of D. Ross ... let us speak the LOWEST point of the show.  Her.  While D. Ross is not without her charm, her egotistical me, me, me, me, ... spreading love act would send a diabetic into a coma.  She does appear to look very lovely and is in good voice while if you look into her eyes when she takes the stage and see the madness that is about to follow.  I think her entrance would have been more fitting than that ""Mountain"" song and should have been ""Tubular Bells"" the theme from ""The Exorcist"".  D. Ross, with foam on her lips basically under the instructions of Susy DeParrot basically spits as she introduces her former Supremes partners the blessed Cindy Birdsong and the vesty Mary Wilson.  As Birdsong and Wilson with fear on their faces approached D. Ross, she (Ross) reaches out her tallon like claws and try hard to attack them.

What was left out of course was the infamous moments of Mary Wilson who was caught up in the moment being attacked by D. Ross as members of the audience running in fear to the exits.  Also removed by Susan DaPotty was when armed guards were brought in to shoot a tranquilizer dart at D. Ross as she grabbed a member of the audience that she mistaken for Jean Terrell slamming her head into the ground screaming ""No one can replace me!""  ""Stone Love THIS!""

All and all I enjoyed this.",1413676800,13,2903,4.292279411764706

8664715,3,B00L9OPDA8,"This collection was okay.  The show was great, but the behind the scenes dvd's were very boring and I love the behind the scenes footage.  It really doesn't give you the whole story behind the Motown stars or their songs either.  I was hoping to hear about the musicians that made these songs a success.  ""Standing in the Shadows of Motown"" is a far more informative behind the scenes look at Motown.",1520985600,2,400,4.513888888888889
