6588570,1,B00MMPB66I,"This review is for the box set only. While I loved the show, I have confirmed with the Warner Archive that this box set is presented in the random out of order way the show was broadcast, NOT in the correct order in which it was meant to be seen. The continuity is ruined. FOX network has destroyed far too many shows by doing this. With SLIDERS, when it was syndicated, the episodes were put back in the right order - then the box set put them back in the WRONG order. At least with FIREFLY they got it right when they released it on DVD.

This set is ""Make on Demand"". I DEMAND that they re-do this right before I will waste may money.",1409616000,119,637,4.096

6588577,5,B00MMPB66I,"I cannot fathom why this outstanding series was cancelled.  Karl Urban is one of the finest actors I have ever watched, in this and every other show he has been in.  Ealy is new to me, but he was wonderful on this show.  Whoever decided to give this show the axe should get the axe themselves.  I think that television is going down a bad road.  It used to be the networks would give a show time to build a fan base.  Now if it doesn't hit ""Game of Thrones"" numbers right away it is cancelled.  I watch a lot of television.  I am disabled, and my TV is on 24/7.  The only drawback to this DVD is the fact that there is no closed captions or subtitles.  My hearing is impaired and I miss some of the great dialog for that reason. The chemistry between the actors is engaging, but it is not a series for little children.  If it had CC it would be perfect!!.  If you like a series with wonderful acting, great writing and camera action, and some high tech thrown in, you will love this!!!  Too bad it is only one season.",1495584000,,1017,4.101522842639594

6588590,5,B00MMPB66I,"Best show since Fringe! I cannot understand the lunacy that determines what gets cancelled. There is no good sci-fi detective show on tv now. I watched this immediately and it was so good it made me angry all over again that it was canceled. Doesn't anyone have a brain anymore? I like unpredictable scenarios, humor and drama. Science fiction seems to be going the way of ""the ghost"" did it, instead of the mad genius did it. Which is not very ""science"" but plenty of fiction. This show just got it right!",1478217600,2,506,4.510869565217392
6588591,5,B00MMPB66I,"This was a fantastic series with some very interesting tech concepts.  There are similarities to the movie iRobot, and some of the typical ""buddy-cop"" character interactions, but the actors did a phenomenal job bringing the characters to life and the episode plots were interesting with some decent twists.

A worthwhile series that ended before it's time.",1477440000,,356,5.339285714285714
6588592,5,B00MMPB66I,"I don't know how I missed this when it was initially run, but I'm glad I found it.  The only problem is that, as seems to be the trend these days, the series got cancelled after a short run.  Only the good shows die young, and ""Almost Human"" is no exception.  The characters are well-developed and well-cast.  The cast is fantastic.  There are a lot of new faces (I don't get out much, apparently) for me, but definitely some I will be on the lookout for in future productions.",1477094400,,477,4.314606741573034

6588596,5,B00MMPB66I,Excellent show. The chemistry between the leads is enjoyable (I loved the scene where Urban chastises his partner for scanning his balls!) and the stories are interesting and of consistant quality. Yet another excellent show cut short before its prime by Republican network Fox.,1476057600,,278,5.340909090909091

6588598,5,B00MMPB66I,"This was a BRILLIANT and entertaining show that was well-rated and reviewed, yet still got cancelled. This was the final straw for me when it comes to the FOX network. I will NEVER watch a new series from them again. Profit, Firefly, Breaking in, then Almost Human? I'm DONE.

DVD is good quality, tho the packaging is quite plain, and the eps are in the wrong order. So, I designed some inner sleeves that also list the eps in the correct order to watch them.
Have posted them here, tho I don't know if they will retain a print quality size. Hope everyone likes them! :)

6588603,5,B00MMPB66I,"I watched this show after it had been (unfortunately) cancelled. It is one of the BEST sci-fi TV series I have ever watched, and being a super nerd, I have watched most of them.  Karl Urban is great as the cynical, humerous and smart aleck cop and Michael Ealy is his perfect foil - together, they are a great team. This show should have gone on - I really don't understand why such a great quality show was cancelled. I got this because I was nervous it might just disappear and I might not ever be able to enjoy this treasure again!",1473206400,,534,4.235294117647059

6588608,5,B00MMPB66I,"Loved it , seriously bummed out that they didn't give it a second season, great chemistry between the two leads Karl Urban  is tremendous in the principal role as a burned out  cop in the year  2048. Michael Ealy is hugely impressive in the difficult role as a super advanced robot who has a capacity for emotional growth and empathy who slowly wins over his embittered and jaded partner Detective John Kennex (Karl Urban).Back in the 1990's this would have had a long run as a series probably even syndication 100  episodes plus, as it is it will forever be destined to remain a gem of a mini series with only 13 epsidoes. Watched it in the evening over three nights absolutely flew by l would have loved another 13 epsidoes.",1471824000,,726,4.519083969465649

6588613,5,B00MMPB66I,"Outstanding show. Great casting, acting and production value.  Storyline was original, police crime solving was innovative with great new special effects and police crime solving gadgets never before seen.  So bummed it got canceled. It seems the viewers participating in Nelson ratings do not like Sci Fi, hence why all the good Sci Fi shows that get canceled like Almost Human, SGU, Eureka, Firefly, Terra Nova etc.

With so much streaming on the internet Hulu, Amazon, Network apps all giving an opportunity to watch your favorite show online at your own convenience, ratings are no longer accurate for competing television shows. Its no longer the way it used to be when we had no DVRs or recording devices or online streaming and you had to stay home to watch your favorite TV show the night it aired yet they still use the same ratings system to determine the success of a show. Its time for a new system of tracking viewers so that great shows like Almost Human and the others I mentioned never get canceled again. Time to track online viewing for a real indication of how popular a show is.

Get this DVD set and watch it in the order it was aired. (see IMDB.com or other reviews here on Amazon that list the proper sequential order of episodes since they were improperly placed on the DVD release)",1468108800,,1306,4.665217391304348

6588644,5,B00MMPB66I,"When I ordered this show, I wasn't expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised until I remembered that Fox has a tendency to create incredible sci-fi shows with great stories, and then kill them deader than Firefly. Almost Human is a look at law and order in the semi-near future when escalating violence and rapidly evolving technology force police departments to pair human cops with android partners. Hijinks and destruction ensue when a battle-hardened cop (Urban) is paired with an outdated android model that sports a synthetic soul. Some episodes were a little kitschy, and some of the non-lead acting could have used some improvement, but I highly enjoyed the series as a whole and hope that Amazon or Netflix pick it up.

Note: Amazon manufactures this TV show when you order it by burning the movies to DVD-Rs. They come professionally packaged but older DVD players may have issues playing them.",1451433600,3,905,4.993377483443709

FOX chose to renew The Following over this - huge mistake- Following peaked after outs first season, season 2 made no sense and season 3 was downright terrible. That season 3 could have been Almost Human's season 2 and would have been pure magic!

Thankfully within just 13 episodes there is enough magic to go around- but leaves me wanting more. This DVD also has great bonus features for big fans of the show including funny out takes and deleted scenes.

Somebody out there at Warner Bros. had to bring this show back - I don't care if it's on FOX, CW or wherever, just bring it back. Then a proper blu ray release would be nice...",1439251200,,689,4.417322834645669

Alas, it will fall into the annals as a cult-classic and be loved by those who were lucky enough to watch it during its heyday on TV.

Everyone involved, from the execs to the awesome crew to the perfect cast is missed keenly by the fans. Having had the chance to tweet/speak to the MX Boys and the voice of the MXs (Anthony Konechny, Garfield Wilson, Darren Scott and Joe Smith, respectively), I can attest to the absolute perfection that was Almost Human.

Taking place in the far future, John and Dorian fight situations and crimes that are unique to their time.

Too many great sci-fi shows are cancelled after one or two seasons, at least this could have gotten two seasons.  Fox, hello, people with money are not your Nielsen families and do not watch live television very often, it is called an external DVR, which on my DirecTV genie is pretty much limitless.  We used to call it ""tape delay"" when we watched a prime time show later at night.

6588756,5,B00MMPB66I,"Almost Human is a great show and I'm glad it's out on DVD.  However, I'm sorry Warner Brothers didn't take the opportunity to put the episodes in production for this release, but instead left it in the order FOX aired it.  The proper order is as follows:

1) Pilot
2) You Are Here
3) Arrhythmia
4) Perception
5) Skin
6) Are You Receiving
7) The Bends
8) Blood Brothers
9) Unbound
10) Simon Says
11) Disrupt
12) Beholder
13) Strawman

Also I found the packaging rather plain.  Considering the high quality graphics on the show that received several award nominations, including an Emmy, I had hoped that same caliber of work would be shown with the DVD labels and the menu screens.  Hopefully if a blu-ray release comes out they can improve on that and add some more special features like episode commentaries.

This DVD though does come with some nice features including a hilarious gag reel, several deleted scenes, and footage from the 2013 San Diego Comic Con panel with the cast.  The episodes themselves are high quality too.  They look and sound great on this DVD.  The cast is excellent, the writing for the show is top notch and the plots and mysteries being explored on Almost Human have made the show great for re-watching.  Even if the DVD could do with some improvements I would still highly recommend this product just on the excellence of the show alone.",1412035200,119,1368,4.634854771784233

6588758,5,B00MMPB66I,"I would buy season 2, 3,...,but they cancelled the show, not realizing what a great sci-fy show they had on their hands. Hopefully,  it will get picked up by another network.",1411344000,34,174,4.612903225806452
6588759,5,B00MMPB66I,"Almost Human is the best scifi series since Firefly:  too bad FOXTV handled it the same way and cancelled after 13 eps.  However, don't let that dissuade you from buying the complete series.  The characters are well developed and played brilliantly, and the chemistry between Michael Ealy and Karl Urban is electric, hilarious, dramatic and touching in turns.  Stories are provocative and well crafted; the special effects are awesome, well deserving of their Emmy nomination.  Though there are 'loose ends' when the season ends (JHWyman had a five year plan that barely got started) the producers left it on a positive note that is satisfying rather than on a cliffhanger like so many series seem to end these days.  Best show I've seen in years and everyone I know who has seen it agrees.  You will not regret the purchase.  Oh, eps aired out of order are not corrected on this offering so watch: Pilot, Perception, You Are Here, Arrhythmia, Skin, and then the rest in the order they're listed.  This show was 30 out of the top 50 in 2013/14 and, on FOXTV, was the top 4 scripted show and top 7 of all shows on the network.  This show was a hit and in any rational world would have been renewed year after year.",1410566400,147,1213,4.574074074074074
6588760,5,B00MMPB66I,"Great show, which like firefly, was overlooked because of poor scheduling.  would show it one week then wait a couple weeks before the next issue would come out.
Finally you can order the series and play them in any order you want all the way through.
Karl Urban and Micheal Easly make a great team and there is just the right amount of humor...So sorry it was cancelled.
