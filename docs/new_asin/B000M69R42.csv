8166731,5,B000M69R42,"The 1930s film industry liked Marquand's novels about a Japanese spy called Mr. Moto, which was not his real name in the novels, but an alias, or more precisely, they liked the notion of a Japanese involved in solving crimes, so they used the name Mr. Moto, changed his character greatly, gave the film role to Peter Lorre who is fascinating as Mr. Moto, and who plays him as a man working for the allies, usually in the ""International Police,"" who is very adept in throwing people over his shoulder when they attack him, who likes to don disguises, and who smiles with large gaps between his teeth at the ridiculous behavior of the men and women, generally men, who act and speak in a ridiculous often humorous manner.
When after 1939, after making three Mr. Moto films that year, relations between the US and Japan deteriorated and the film industry felt it inappropriate to show a Japanese hero, so the Mr. Moto films starring Peter Lorre ceased. It was not until 1965 that another actor was given the role of Mr. Moto in The Return of Mr. Moto, but interest at that time in the franchise had frittered away and no further Mr. Moto films were made.
In this film, which is the third of the three Mr. Moto films made in 1938, after the two made in 1937 and the first two of 1938, Mr. Moto is working for the International Police trying to find the head man of a criminal gang. Again, as in the other old films, this one is clear, easy to watch, and I enjoyed it. The film begins with Mr. Moto working undercover, disguised as a criminal who was sentenced to Devils Island, and who aids a member of the gang he is investigating to escaped. Later in the film, he will dress in another disguise. He works with New Scotland Yard, but not for them. They praise Mr. Motos skills greatly.",1511913600,3,1782,4.419452887537994

Three men discuss confidential business about important people. Anton Darvek gets a telephone call with a ""last warning""! Can this call be traced? Can a business leader become a target if he refuses to make a deal about a formula for better steel? ""What can we do?"" Mr. Moto visits Scotland Yard to talk to the head of CID (about the ""League of Assassins""). ""Murder for sale?"" Moto knows the men but not their leader. He will be followed when he leaves. Can he drop this tail? We see scenes of London life and people's attitudes. Moto follows a young lady to her room and gets a report. Why are those people in London? There is an ""accident"" on the street, who saw it happen? Darvek plans to attend an art exhibit. He gets another warning message explaining why a man was killed.

Can Scotland Yard protect Darvek? Is he too suspicious? Is a man is talking too much to that young lady? ""What local color!"" Men gather together. The accordion plays a new tune, a fight breaks out. What's been going on? Later a body is found in the river. Bressac must be caught! The identity of a servant is known, they will arrange for a solution. Is that tune a signal? Moto makes a getaway in a taxi. There is a chase. ""There he goes!"" Moto gets away. The plotters plan an accident for Darvek at the Coventry Galleries. Moto takes care of two phony CID men who come to him. Another man is arrested. Who will turn out to be the secret leader? Moto has a trick to save Darvek and identify the secret leader of the conspirators. It works! The others are quickly rounded up. Moto explains how he figured it out. There is one conspirator left, he gives himself away by firing a pistol. Moto quickly catches him.

This tells about the expectations of the audience around the time of the Munich Agreement (some say this led to WW II). [Did you suspect the use of a body double in some scenes?]",1371081600,,1907,4.396600566572238
8166734,5,B000M69R42,"""You're a strange character Moto, always playing the lone hand."" -- Scotland Yard to Mr. Moto

Peter Lorre, already solidly established in film, nonetheless gained many new fans as J.P. Marquand's Japanese detective of the International Police, Mr. Moto. Born Laszlo Lowenstein in what was then Austria-Hungary, he shot to fame when Fritz Lang cast the German speaking actor in the now legendary, M. Born into a Jewish family, he fled Germany in 1933, taking refuge in Paris, and then London. It was there that Ivor Montagu spotted him, and talked Hitchcock into giving him the colorful role of the assassin in The Man Who Knew Too Much. The rest, as they say, is history. While the stunts in this series were not to his liking, Lorre was perfect in the role, and offered moviegoers a jam-packed hour of fun. Fans enjoyed watching Mr. Moto use both his brains and athletic ability to get over on the bad guys. While it didn't have the charm of Fox's other big franchise, Charlie Chan, it often had more action, and always a good cast of supporting players that kept the story interesting.

Mystery writer Philip MacDonald co-wrote this one with director Norman Foster, and Virgil Miller once again was behind the camera. Leon Ames, who classic film fans will remember as the father to Judy Garland and Margaret O'Brien in Meet Me in St. Louis, heads a nice array of players. Born in Melbourne, Australia, Mary Maguire, minus any accent, portrays the lovely secretary in love with her boss, and worried for his safety. Henry Wilcoxon, a Cecil B. DeMille discovery, is the boss who won't give into thugs, and puts his life in danger. Wilcoxon perhaps made more of an impact behind the camera, but is solid in support here. He finally got a good lead role in a sterling ""B"" mystery from 1947, titled Dragnet. Billed here as Karen Sorrell, Lotus Long has a meaty role as Moto's delicious Eurasian informant, Lotus Liu. Part Japanese and part Hawaiin, she was often cast as Chinese, which worked to her advantage when the war broke out. Everyone assumed she was Chinese, and therefore she was able to avoid internment with many other Japanese Americans during WWII.

The Mysterious Mr. Moto takes off quickly with a prison break from Devil's Island. Paul Brissak (Leon Ames) and his pal Ito (Peter Lorre) manage to make it out of the French prison and obtain passage aboard a ship bound for London. Once there, Ito persuades Brissak to keep him on as his cook so he can keep an eye on him. Mr. Moto of the International Police knows he is a member of the League of Assassins and is intent on softly capturing the monkeys. Scotland Yard is for a bolder approach, but Moto won't tell them all he knows, suspecting it will gum up the works if played with a heavy hand. Using pretty Lotus Liu to work information from one of the group's members, Moto sees the friend of Anton Darvak (Henry Wilcoxon) run down by the league as a warning on the way to meet her. A brawl meant to mask another killing has Moto whisking Lotus to safety before she's next. Meanwhile, Darvak's pretty secretary, Ann Richman (Mary Maguire), enlists his pal's help to find out if Moto is actually telling Darvak the truth about the danger he is in for not selling his new steel.

It all leads to an exciting and fun conclusion to this entry. The series itself is quick moving, colorful, and immensely entertaining. The success of this series has to rest squarely on the shoulders of the diminutive Peter Lorre, whose talent was anything but miniscule. The Mr. Moto series is a good way to remember Lorre, because here, he got to play the good guy, and did so with quiet panache. Great fun for fans.",1276732800,5,3664,4.632307692307692
8166735,4,B000M69R42,"This was my first look ever at Peter Lorre's ""Mr. Moto"" character, and I couldn't help but compare and contrast him to the famous ""Charlie Chan"" of a similar period. ""Mr. Moto"" is charming but isn't the comedian or the proverb-quoting Chan. I would have to watch a few more Moto movies before I could really compare the two fairly, but what I saw in this film impressed me.

In this story, Moto pretends to be a fugitive from Devil's Island, one of two escapees who wind up in London. That was the idea all along for Our Man as he hoped his fellow man-of- flight, ""Paul Brissac"" would lead to him to bigger fish in the criminal world, specifically ""The League of Assassins.""

Just when I thought this film was starting to get a tiny bit slow, it picked up nicely and had very good last 20-some minutes with a suspenseful ending. The actions were hokey but so what? The film is 70 years old so I don't expect state-of-the-art special-effects. In spots, it was so corny it made it fun. I was shocked how physical little Mr. Moto was, throwing bodies around like a WWF bruiser!

By the way, the restoration job on the DVD transfer makes this a good-looking film. I saw this as part of the recently-released set.",1238112000,,1208,4.4324324324324325
