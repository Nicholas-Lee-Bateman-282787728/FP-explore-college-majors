8543808,5,B009QS4ZYE,"Although the documentary is a bit dated, the issues are relevant and prevalent.  I grew up next to Fort Totten Reservation in North Dakota and grew up with similar images from driving through the reservation.  Native American history, culture, and present issues need attention and advocacy.  This documentary is a good jumping off point.",1459641600,,338,5.222222222222222
8543809,3,B009QS4ZYE,Some of the historical aspects of the film are interesting. It is sad to see the current conditions but positive to see that even as bad as things are young people want to get their education and come back to work on the reservation. It had a lot of potential but fell flat and was a bit more negative than focusing on the resilience of a people despite having so much disruption to their lifeways.,1447200000,,398,4.32

8543812,4,B009QS4ZYE,"This is a fascinating documentary, pieced together with various clips to create the history of the Oglala Lakota in a chronological form. The atrocities carried out by the American government over generations was sickening, and - as a white Australian - I can see the same atrocities have taken place amongst the native peoples of Australia, the Aborigines. The correlation is frightening, because it really shows how the colonists approached life in general. It was only in the late 1800's that Native Americans were deemed 'human', it was only in the 60s in Australia that the Aboriginals were no longer considered 'flora and fauna'. Seriously. People are people, regardless of colour, of clothing, of the food they eat, of the dances they perform. I know Christianity has a lot to answer for as well, on this matter.

The only issue I have is with the documentary's approach to the American Indian Movement (AIM). AIM is a group that intended/intends to build the native nations up, and I'm all for that, however the documentary did not expand on the corruption inside AIM where certain leadership figures are concerned, or the deaths of Anna May Aquash and Ray Robinson, nor was the GOON squad fully explored.

Watch this if you're interested in history, in culture, in spiritualism, in native peoples, etc.",1375574400,11,1311,4.981735159817352
8543813,5,B009QS4ZYE,"This DVD is EXCELLENT!!!! very well done. I recommend it to anybody who wants to know the dynamics of the history of Indian Country. It is packed with very excellent information. The truth....totally non-biased. The Lakota Sioux seem to be like the poster tribe of all that is wrong in Indian Country. I recommend the ultimate edition, it has excellent interviews with some of the leaders who have since passed over to spirit world.",1370476800,9,432,4.851351351351352
8543814,5,B009QS4ZYE,"I've watched everything on this subject and this is still very informative, entertaining and moving. It was great to see Russell Means one more time after hearing of his passing - he's an American hero in every meaning of the term! I'd watch another couple of hours of special features if they were included. I've already ordered the filmmaker's fictional film, Rez Bomb.",1355097600,15,371,4.904761904761905
