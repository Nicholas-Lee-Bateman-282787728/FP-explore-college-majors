7830157,3,6302697719,"My friends and I all watched Tiny Toons when we were younger, and we've been on the search for the episodes with Baby Plucky. We can't find them though. Are they out at all? We SO want them on DVD!",1162425600,,197,3.95
7830158,5,6302697719,"I'm very fond of the show, but I'm a little worried. When it first began to rerun in syndication and Fox Kids, a lot of the episodes were cut for time, and even more footage was cut when it ran on Nickelodeon/Nicktoons in the late '90s up to now. I would really like to see ALL the cartoons UNCUT, and UNEDITED, the Istanbul video, in particular, AND the infamous ""ONE BEER"". episode. All this NEEDS to be in the DVD.",1136419200,4,417,4.225
7830159,5,6302697719,"Of course my first love was and is Bugs, but in Tiny Toons, baby Plucky rules.  My favorite episodes are the elevator one (I want to push it again) and when he was stuffing everything down the toilet (and then sucks on his thumb...'Eeewwww').

I am begging Warner Brothers, please release this on dvd.",1125273600,5,301,4.555555555555555
7830160,5,6302697719,This is the moment that I most remember from tiny toons... Plucky Duck looking like a cross between Philip Marlow and Indiana Jones set to They Might be Giants... Please Please Please PLEASE release this on DVD Warner Brothers!!!,1105574400,7,229,4.897435897435898
7830161,5,6302697719,"Every day when I was in elementary school, after school let out, I remember rushing off the bus and running down the street to my house, parking myself in front of the TV, and watching Tiny Toon Adventures. It was such a classic show; the characters (PLUCKY!!!), the stories, the references, the jokes, everything about this show was great. It's just another reason I love the '90s.
Ah, yes, I remember this one. I haven't seen it in years, but I know the whole thing: The They Might Be Giants song (""Particle Man"" was hilarious with Plucky trying to box), Shirley the Loon singing ""Nothing Compares 2 U"", and, correct me if I'm mistaken, but I believe this one also has ""The Name Game"". (They skip over Plucky, needless to say.) This one's a classic, as is almost every episode they ever made (not to mention ""How I Spent My Vacation"").
And now what kind of hogwash are today's kids being spoon-fed? ""The Fairly Odd-Parents???"" *sigh* Oh well, at least the tapes of this still exist.
RELEASE TINY TOONS ON DVD!!!!!!",1069718400,15,1016,4.6187845303867405
