After 13+ years of coaching fast pitch softball, at all levels, I found this program to be the ""missing link"" to help take teams to the next level. Highly recommend this DVD  and book for coaches as well as athletes and parents. The information is provided in a format that is very easily relatable!! Packed with insights and information for all coaches and athletes at all levels,(10U to Gold - Middle School to College) and for any sport.",1240012800,,490,4.568181818181818
