2749785,4,B000MV82MA,"This was a surprise. I wasn'r expecting much with this movie, so was pleasantly surprised with how well this movie was done. First things first, If you are looking for an exploitation movie, this ain't it. There are a couple of fairly brief shower scenes, and a fairly tame scene of sex between two women, but the overall focus was kept on the story itself. I have seen other work by Jag Mundra on the past, and this was probably one of the better ones. Worth a look for sure. Charlie S.",1233792000,12,487,4.304347826086956
2749786,4,B000MV82MA,"This was a good movie from Maverick. Some movies from Maverick are iffy, but this one was well acted and had a good story. The lead actress is very attractive and does a good job. The story is set in England and Russia, and moves back and forth nicely between the two. It has some explicit content involving a strip club and other sexual situations. This was all nicely done and erotic. All in all a good film if you want to see a B movie with sex, and violence, yet a compelling story to prop it up.",1208044800,17,500,4.112244897959184

All of those movies DO have trailers, how come it's so hard for Amazon to actually show them? They lost a lot of business because of this. Especially if it's a movie no one has heard of.

2749791,5,B000MV82MA,"As B movies go, they don't get much better than this.  The acting is pretty decent and the storyline is actually compelling.  A Russian stripper named Natasha (Algina Lipskis) witnesses a murder.  The Russian mob comes after her, forcing her to pose as an exchange student to get out of the country.

She arrives in England, where she lives with a conservative family that has no clue of Natasha's true identity or the ruthless thugs who are after her.  She blends into the small English town as best she can, and she begins to have a significant impact on the village.  She begins to transform the town - for the better.

Algina Lipskis is stunning and has a genuine screen presence.  All in all, this was one of the more well-done B movies I've ever seen.  Like most upper echelon B flicks, it doesn't shy away from gratuitous nudity & that's always a good thing!

While one would never, ever guess it from the cover, this film ends up being a feel-good movie.  It's about accepting people for who they are, rather than trying to force them into being what we want them to be.  It's the story of a Russian stripper who became the catalyst for an English village becoming a better place to live.  It's a story you don't want to miss!",1278720000,,1234,4.455357142857143

It's often been said many times by many people that the defining name in professional ballet is Mikhail Baryshnikov. Somehow after seeing him dance, I can't help but agree. And if Misha himself is in fact the God of Ballet, than Natasha is Ballet's Goddess. A woman who may not only rival this icon, but perhaps... even stand above him.

As I write this, the prima ballerina absolutta is 68 years of age. She is further evidence (as if we honestly needed any) that the greatest ballet dancer of this generation or any other will always be a Russian.

Vaslav Nijinsky, Rudolph Nureyev, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Natasha Makarova, Alexander Godunov and Vladimir Malakov. All the best of the best. Native Russian bastards, all.
The truckload of statuettes she got for, including the Tony itself are all certainly deserved. As is the title of ""prima ballerina absolutta"" she was awarded, along such fellow ballerina monuments as Dame Margot Fonteyn,  Pierina Legnani and Galina Sergeyevna Ulanova.

Natasha has always seemed the girl who was born for the ballet. With her long willowy tree-branch body and limbs, precise hands and feet, fine-boned features, prominent eyes and cheek-bones, full pouty lips... she's always had an almost impossible connection with the music.

The film chronicles on her brief partnership with Royal Ballet Brit extraordinaire Anthony Dowell, who did as much Britain's ballet as Dame Margot Fonteyn did. They even dance the legendary ""Romeo & Juliet"" together that was tailored for Nureyev and Fonteyn. They dance divinely, with Dowell being less graceful and more strong and prominent than those in the role before him, including Nureyev himself. Dowell expresses the kind of strength, stature and passion we'd expect from a classical leading man. The ideal partner every girl in ballet class fixates herself on. A true ""ballerino.""

As great as her partners are, they're pretty much just assistants. They can barely hold their own around Natasha. The ballerinas are usually the stars in this craft. They've dominated it and owned it even more than the Russians have.  But Natasha is so damn breathtaking, so light, so with the music... she almost makes the men around her unnessicary.  Only Dennis Ganio seems to really come close to matching that kind of majesty Natasha herself has. The two often seem like they're about to float away.

The film mostly chronicles recorded events of her best and most popular work.

The only time we actually hear any talk in the whole thing comes from prima ballerina absolutta goddess herself. She may be lighter than air, but her accent is as thick as the snow in Siberia.
It's no wonder the dear lady prefers to let her dancing speak for itself. I myself personally was astonished to hear her say, ""Take off pointe shoes, put high heels and dance....""Dancing en pointe is one thing... but heels?

I've heard a lot of horror stories about those pointe shoes.

Compared to Chinese foot-binding. To walking on hot coals. To tap-dancing on tacks and broken glass. But with an especially beautiful outcome.

Women like to wear heels when they want to feel confident and sexy, but to dance in them? But of course, Natasha pulls it off. In ""On Your Toes"" and ""Begin the Beguine,"" sure enough--the little lady's in heels. Dancing ballet-ballroom style in heels, with grace and style not even Ginger Rogers ever pulled off.

Strangely missing in action is fellow prima donna ballerina extraordinaire and Russian native Mikhail Baryshnikov. The man is not only the quintessential name in ballet, he was one of the best to partner Natasha. They brought a fire and triumph to dance that only such Russkie angels such as they could.

It's true, this isn't as probing and as revealing about the overall life of it's subject like Nureyev's ""I Am A Dancer"" or Margot Fonteyn's ""Margot"" or the film about their collaborative work ""The Perfect Partnership."" ""Natasha"" doesn't do any deep digging and just shows it's starlet's highlights. But Natasha herself is so damn great at what she does, that... ""Natasha"" is still worth seeing. For any fan of ""Natasha"" or ballet itself.

""Natasha"" is a well-made film, beautifully shot and put together with the kind of professionalism and respect deserved for a ballerina deity such as Natalia Makarova. It follows her, her on-stage career not limited purely to her ballet.

For a ballerina to make it professionally, to make it to a principal. To make it into the history books. To make it as ""prima ballerina absolutta.""

Natasha herself has clearly earned such a tribute.

SPECIAL NOTE: Stay all the way to the finale.

After the final curtain call, Natasha decides to show us what a sweetheart and class act she truly is. She shows encouragement to the very next generation. She meets a pre-pubescent ballerino and finds him cute and sweet as a puppy and suggest maybe a potential partnership in the near future. She seems so teddy-bear cuddly herself, the way she just wants to cuddle him right there and then. She quotes her memorable monologue from ""On Your Toes."" We remember her and Tim Flavin. It almost seems like next coming of the Fonteyn-Nureyev partnership. After watching this movie, you feel like you might just feel blessed beyond words... if you just got to meet her.

2749795,4,B000MV82MA,"First of all this movie is NOT ""unrated"" (at least my copy wasn't, and I doubt that an unrated cut really exists). It's R-rated and pretty standard fare for sexy R-rated films...in fact considerably tamer than some.

That's the only reason that I gave it four stars and not five. Not even any full-frontal shots. Big disappointment.

However, everything else about this movie is a grand-slam. Great story. Nice nudity and sexiness. Funny. Touching even, at moments. Thrilling and suspenseful. Well-written for the most part and very well-acted.

And you, as I, will fall in love with the adorable lead, Algina Lipskis. Absolutely gorgeous, killer body that she doesn't at all mind showing off. And a really good little actress with good comedic timing. I'm going to try to find more films with her in them.

Not truly an example of soft-core fare--a half-step backwards from true erotic thriller territory--but worth viewing and even, I dare say, worth buying.",1255478400,,960,5.018867924528302

8172521,3,B000MV82MA,"Natasha (2007) features one brutally graphic murder, but rather than a suspenseful tale of cat and mouse, the film has a lighter more comedic approach, as a witnesses to murder, attempts to stay alive.

Algina Lipskis gives a winning performance, displaying some comedic talent, as well as her luscious curves, as Anna, an exotic dancer at a club in Russia, who witnesses the murder of the club's manager, by underworld goons.  After the crooks mistakenly murder Anna's sister Natasha in quite spectacular fashion, Anna assumes Natasha's identity, and escapes to England posing as an exchange student.

Upon her arrival in an English village, matters assume a lighter tone, as the strikingly lovely Russian, is taken in by vicar John Loomis (Richard Lintern), greatly affecting the lives of his children Christine (Jenna Harrison) and Robbie (Joseph O'Malley).  When a sexual encounter featuring Natasha is posted online, the Russian heavies arrive in the village to finish the job, trailed by police detective Petra Olescova (Sheyla Shehovich) who is investigating the murders.

Light on violence, and with lots of decorative nudity, Natasha is a playful little action/comedy with an English flavor.  Algina Lipskis is quite engaging in her role, easily passing for a mischievous adolescent schoolgirl.
