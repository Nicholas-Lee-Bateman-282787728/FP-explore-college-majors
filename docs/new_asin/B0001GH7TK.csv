But, this one have a story like many others movie (what is not the problem), without present any other new element (thats the question). It's a well made movie, but when it ends you ask yourself 'Wow, Has it already finished?'.

The great point of the item is the 3D stereo view, but you need special glasses to see it at this way.

If you like vampire movies you can buy this one, but if you don't like this genre, please don't do that.",1232755200,,574,4.017543859649122
8157138,1,B0001GH7TK,"You'd think a title about Vampire Strippers would have more endowed actress. The nudity didn't matter much because the girls had barely there breasts. They had to be the laziest strippers I've ever seen. Who ever heard of any strip club with only three dancers? The sets were bargain basement, a room painted black with decorations look like they came from Spencers was supposed to be the club.",1198972800,3,394,4.8088235294117645
8157139,1,B0001GH7TK,I would say that if there is a 0 star I would give it that. Not much to say about. I hate it.,1179878400,,93,3.0869565217391304
8157140,1,B0001GH7TK,"I purchased this because I wanted an adult movie in 3-D.  The 3-D does not work at all, even though it is field-sequential (electronic shutter glasses).  It was probably one of those bogus, so-called ""3-D conversions""-allegedly converting a 2-D movie to 3-D. Other 2-D movies are also marketed as 3-D when they are not. Those include Dementia 13,  Night of the Living Dead, In Search of the Perfect 10, City  Girls, etc.

Field-Sequential 3-D really works with the right movies! Bogus marketing of this type is one main reason that 3-D never takes off.",1176249600,3,552,4.829787234042553
