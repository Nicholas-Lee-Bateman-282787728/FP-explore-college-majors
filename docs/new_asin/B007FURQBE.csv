The images captured in the peaceful country side and the ""natural wonders"" which can only be described as a post card into the very heart of the what makes this country a place that I would like to visit.  The waterfalls, Ban Gloc Fall, apppear to be within arms reach, and shows the pure untouched lanscapes of a country once torn apart by war.  If you have ever wondered, what Vietnam  looks like, this ""little"" film  does an excellant job of showing you that. I found the music and videoagraphy goes hand and hand creating a very soothing and relaxing way to wind down at the end of a hard day....simply put....an awesome film....not to be missed",1336348800,,723,4.6171875
