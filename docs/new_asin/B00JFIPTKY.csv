8650566,5,B00JFIPTKY,"The 2014 Eurovision Song Contest overall is one of the better ones from the last ten years, but, not as good as Baku 2012 or Dusseldorf 2011. Reviewers opinions will vary. The controversial Conchita Wurtz, though, is a stand out and her (his) performance is justifiably the winner which will send the contest to Austria for it's 2015 edition. The contest's rules hamper innovation and originality to some extent, but, there are always some competitors each year who manage to distinguish themselves. The television audience numbers continue to increase each year suggesting that the popularity of this annual event continues. Although not permitted to participate, reports now are that the Australian audience for the contest is huge.",1416528000,,734,5.282051282051282
