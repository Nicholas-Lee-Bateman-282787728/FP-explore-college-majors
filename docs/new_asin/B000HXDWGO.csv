2648225,5,B000HXDWGO,Excellent film. I enjoy it just as much as the 1st time no matter how many times i watch it and this thankfully has english subtitles.,1172188800,,134,4.1923076923076925
2648226,4,B000HXDWGO,"Having viewed Pasion de Gavilanes in real time, I found the DVD to be a wonderful recap of the story.  Naturally, in the allowed time it would be impossible to see all of my favorite scenes, but in a ""cliff note"" fashion I was able to see the couples coming together and to follow the storyline.  As a non-hispanic, the fact that the caps were available in English only made the experience more enjoyable.  Given the number of times I have rewatched PDG, and translating from the caps, I should know the dialog by heart.  The behind the scenes clips and interviews were a treat and I was very pleased with that.  Finally, the quality of the DVD picture was superb.  I found myself wishing Telemundo would release the novela to the public in its ""total"" package (30+ DVDs) and let us worry about how to pay for it.  LOL",1168300800,41,818,4.413333333333333

Those same nuances are now missing, the passion is missing, characters interraction is missing, the romance is missing amids disjointed pieces stuck together. I am giving  this novela a rating of 3 stars because I loved the original and the actors. the dvd on its own only deserves a 2 rating.",1166227200,11,431,4.3875

2648233,4,B000HXDWGO,"I love soap operas in Spanish. Tv novels. Wish they would edit less and leave about 20 hours on DVD.

Three brothers lose their younger sister to suicide after a much older and married man romances her and leaves her pregnant after he dies in a car accident.

The brothers decide to take revenge on his widow and three daughters by making daughters fall in love with them, then abandoning them.

Of course, they fall in love with daughters. Made in Columbia.

Oldest daughter divorces her husband, but her mother wants him around to help run ranch. He only married in to family for their money and manipulates mother in law. He also has a strong friendship with a man with criminal connections who hates one of the brothers because the brother is the former lover of his current girlfriend/wife.",1475625600,,795,4.6571428571428575

2648237,1,B000HXDWGO,I have actually watched this Spanish soap opera like 5/6/7 times since it went off air.  I actually bought an older version when it first came out.  So I know that in this package of dvds many scenes have been removed.  I have literally watched it once never looked at it again since I got it.  I wanted to it to mom cause that was of our favorite soap opera.  But I can't give this cut version to her.,1465344000,,402,4.037974683544304
2648238,3,B000HXDWGO,"First, I want to point out that this DVD has subtitles in English for the main show (took me forever to find someone who mentioned that in their review). Some of the extras are not subtitled. It's just as people are describing. A very condensed version of the soap. I watched it because Netflix had taken it down when I was about 2/3 into it and I just wanted to see how it ended. Now Netflix has put it back up and I know generally what is going to happen...its like I've seen a preview. I knew what I wanted out of the DVD and got what I expected, thanks to the warnings mentioned in previous reviews.",1459123200,,603,4.162393162393163

2648260,4,B000HXDWGO,I loved this telenovela when it aired on Telemundo. I've actually bought this several times because my previous two sets were borrowed and never returned. It is a summary or just the major plots of the show are on the dvd. I would love to have all 100+ episodes but I'll settle for the few hours I get here.  Watching some of these novelas years later makes me kind of cringe at some of the incredible and improbable plot lines but I just laugh and reminisce about how I couldn't wait for the next episode to air. I wish Telemundo would put Te Voy a Ensenar a Querer on DVD. That was another Danna Garcia one that I enjoyed while it aired.,1419379200,,639,4.237704918032787

The sub titles were in yellow outlined in black which made it easier to read than on TV.  The most disappointing thing is that they cut so much out of the DVD's. What should have be 10 or 12 DVD's was shortened to 5.  They cut out the marriage ceremony between Juan and Norma...big mistake.  I'm still looking to see if there is a complete DVD set that includes all full length episodes.  Still enjoyed overall.  Love the Reyes Brothers, love Mario Cimarro (Juan)!

If you have already watched this novela and just want to re-watch favorite story lines and characters, than it's a great buy at $15.  If you have never seen this show before I would recommend you try to catch it when it is rerun on TV (which is is every year or so -TiVO it).  The DVDs would look really choppy and ridiculous if you didn't already know enough of the show to ""fill in the blanks"".

I have watched some of the show and was dying to see the rest and what I got turned out to be a very long movie trailer. You get little snippets from each episode with all of the really great scenes removed, just enough to give you an idea of the plot. I cannot believe that with a show this popular they would not release to full thing on DVD, and I would love to know who thought that this summarized version was a good idea.

DVDs provide a very ""short"" version of the novela. Viewers gets a
better story line from episodes posted on Youtube. I searched
scenes that explain the story on Youtube that were completely cut off from the DVD.

The DVD cover makes no mention that this is NOT the full novela, instead it misleads with a message of ""includes scenes never before seen on TV""

Shame on you Telemundo for not respecting your audience.

Can you imagine purchasing Sex in theCity Series DVD, Sopranos DVD, Tru Blood DVD in a condensed version? Who
would buy it?
I am very disappointed and would like my money back.
The storyline is so fast and botched that most of the time the viewer is left wondering did
I miss a scene? How did this happen? where did this come from?
If Telemundo sold the complete novela at a much higher price I would
purchase it and so would many other people. But at this cheap price, with botched story telling, I feel completely ripped off.

When will Telemundo release the full novela on DVD? When its audience has lost interest? That's a good business
plan???

I to wish telemundo would just release all the episodes (Sarita and Franco's wedding isn't included on the disc, which I really wanted to see again) it's no different than buying all the seasons of a primetime show and I'm wiling to pay. But the DVD extras with the actors, the videos, the blooper, etc are great.  Highly recommend if you never saw the original run of PDG.

I watched this soap opera (Telenovela) since it started when aired by telemundo on 2004. This is one of the best love stories ever told. It is really a master piece. I have my own personal collection of all the episodes that I recorded with my VCR of this wonderful love story. For that reason I can state that this DVD does not honor the Telenovela at its fullest. For example the love story between Natasha Klauss (Sara Elizondo) and Michel Brown (Franco Reyes) the really exciting moments were removed like the two times that Sarita wakes up on Franco's bed thinking that she was raped and she was not. The essence of the first hate and them love story is not felt when watching this DVD. On the other hand, the images and sound are outstanding. The sound and images are crystal clear and better than TV. I was able to hear new television score that I could not hear with my VRC recorded version.

2648292,5,B000HXDWGO,"I've never written reviews and I've never watched telenovellas (it's just not my thing). This particular one, however, is an exeption. It was aired in my country last year and became a great hit: indeed, it remains the only telenovella I'd ever watched in my whole life!
The story line is very simple, yet very engaging. You actually feel for the heroes. And when my favourite couple, Sarita and Fraco, came togehter, I actually cried a little (the only time I had cried because of a movie prior to that was when watching the Love Story). The actors are splending! You actually believe they are 3 sisters and 3 brothers, and that they are couples. And I'm not even talking about the magnificent play of 'Gabriela Elisondo' - MARVELOUS is the only word.
Overall, I can't find a single character, even secondary, that played on ever average level - everyone were only too convincing (I was, for instance, convinced that Jimena and Oscar, as well as Sarita and France would end up together).

Now, the telenovella is aired for the second time here (first one to be re-aired, I believe) and I was very sad because it's close to an end. But then I saw this DVD and bought. Well... I guess it's still worth the money paid, because I can see my favourite characters whenever I want, but it was just too heavily edited. There were parts I really wanted to see, crucial parts, and they are missing, along with laods of other stuff.

I give this a 5 star simply becasue I can't give anything less to this splendid telenovella.
However, I would give only 2 or 3 starts to the actual DVD because of the heavy editing.",1218067200,,1605,4.531034482758621
2648293,1,B000HXDWGO,"I am an anglo fan of Paola Rey and ""Pasion de Gavilanes"" but haven't been able to see the whole telenovela due mostly to timing and work.  Yeah, I need a tivo.  I made sure that this DVD was English subtitled and it was advertised as ""All the Pasion"" and having scenes not shown on TV.  Well, it isn't ""all"" of ""Pasion de Gavilanes""!  It is so chopped up it is hard to follow the story line.  Nowhere in the advertising does it refer to a ""condensed"" version but that's what it is.  I know it's just a telenovela but please!  It made me think of watching a series of highlight reels.  I don't know how long the full series would be in minutes or hours but this is certainly NOT close to the complete series.  I've seen enough of the show on TV to know how badly this DVD skips scenes and omits parts of the plot.  It is truly a joke and when I sent a complaint to Telemundo, of course I didn't get a reply.  I would cheerfully pay for the complete series but this isn't it.  Sometimes it is even frustrating.  I've never taken the time to write a review before but this DVD has left me steamed at Telemundo, Universal Studios and any of their associates.  Now I have second thoughts on buying ""La Mujer en el Espejo"", ""Amores de Mercado"" or any other Telemundo/Universal productions.  What a bitter disappointment!  Makes me wonder what the stars of the show think.  I hope they think about more than ""How much do we get on the residuals.""
Sincerely,
Steamed",1214006400,10,1458,4.301470588235294

2648296,2,B000HXDWGO,"This is a good review of the actual show, those that have seen if and remember a few of the scenes might end up disappointed that it's missing a lot of the parts that make this show what it really is.  Other then that the extras are interesting and the videos worth watching",1213056000,,274,4.169811320754717
2648297,3,B000HXDWGO,"This item is more long but others but sometimes looks like a person who take the soap opera in film and with the scissors do cuts and put one but one. There are some scenes that are very short. I can see it because I saw it on TV, but some scenes can be understood without watch it on TV",1211760000,,287,3.8

2648305,4,B000HXDWGO,"This is a really good story. I feel weird because I never could stand more than 5 seconds of American soaps. Gorgeous latin women!

My first Spanish soap was called ROSALINDA and it's awesome too!

Only problem is that there are 5 discs and I thought that the last disc did not have English subtitles so I had to guess the end of the story by watching just the acting.  Turns out the English Subtitle ON is buried in one of the bonus material so I turned it on and watched it again with english subtitle.

Music soundtrack is wonderful.",1203465600,,536,4.33
2648306,4,B000HXDWGO,Watched it on TV and loved it! Bought the DVD set and still love the story! I can't believe it's been remade for TV again. Now it's called Fuego en la Sangre and still love watching it again!!!,1190678400,,193,4.105263157894737
2648307,5,B000HXDWGO,"I watched this whole 18 month novella on television when it first premiered.  It has a depth of feeling and characterizations often lacking in US soap operas.
 This abbreviated version captures the essence of the entire program wonderfully with the same beautiful people and breathtaking locations.
I am an English speaker, but originally tried watching the entire series in Spanish because the diction and accents are so clear and well enunciated that it was very easy to assimilate the meanings when the words were unfamiliar.",1189555200,,528,5.2
2648308,1,B000HXDWGO,"This ""novela"" version is woefully edited.  Content continuity is absent, and one has no idea what the novela is supposed to be all about. It apparently jumps from chapter to chapter with portions missing. I do not  recommend this novela version to anyone--mine wound up in the trash can.",1189382400,,287,4.836734693877551

2648310,5,B000HXDWGO,"This is an excellent TV novela, one of the best I've ever seen. I enjoyed it from the begining to the end, hooked for 12 hours none stop! And the fact that it comes with English subtitles it's incredible!",1181347200,,204,4.256410256410256

8142274,5,B000HXDWGO,This is a great and fun novela to watch.  They have done a good job with the editing.  I wish that we good get the telenovela as it was originally done. It has English subtitles which is great for those who do not speak or understand Spanish.  The acting is superb.  One of Telemundo's best telenovela/  Love It.  The only problem is the last dvd had no english subtitles.  Strange.,1512086400,,382,4.371428571428571

8142276,5,B000HXDWGO,"I first watched this series on NetFllex, and it's fantastic. However, the DVDs are sadly lacking. There is way, way too much cut out and for me, it felt like the story was jumping around and so much left out. Yes, I'd recommend this series be watched even though it's in Spanish and you'll have to read the subtitles. It's worth watching, but not on the DVDs. Watch it on NetFlex.",1510012800,,380,4.366197183098592
