8199174,5,B000R7I3ZA,Love this movie. If your a football fan it's a great movie for you. DVD arrived as seller said and I would buy from this seller again.,1408752000,,134,4.0
8199175,2,B000R7I3ZA,I really am not into football that much so I don't know why I bought this. I actually thought the Film varsity blues would accurately show how highschool football was in the 1990's but It didn't cover any new ground when it comes to highschool football in general. Waste of my money and time.,1382140800,,292,4.425925925925926
8199176,4,B000R7I3ZA,"Was just in the mood to see these movies for awhile.  Luckily I found them together on Amazon.  Unlucky that a week later they ended up on NetFlix, which I have too.  LOL",1368057600,,170,4.090909090909091
8199177,4,B000R7I3ZA,"It was good no marks
Played great and I had no problem receiving at the right date it said it was gonna get here",1361923200,,112,3.7083333333333335
8199178,5,B000R7I3ZA,"The movie's are in pristine condition.  Both movies were in the original case, and played without any problems whatsoever.  Plus unlike some double feature sets, they were both separate movies (no side a. side b.),  and they both had special features which is great.  If you like both these movies and you want them I'd recommend getting this set.",1341014400,2,347,4.830508474576271
