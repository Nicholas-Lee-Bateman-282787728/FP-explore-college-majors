3555959,5,B001ELRCS2,Nick Cage is a great actor. Most of his movies are great for on the edge of your seat action. Please enjoy,1387324800,,106,3.8636363636363638
3555960,5,B001ELRCS2,"Both of these films are well made if a little long in places. Unfathomably it seem to need the longer time to get the whole story across in both films. These two are not for the kiddies or most wives as they both depict the ""Snuff Films"" of the 50's and 60's. A lot of men won't care much for them either. Nicolas Cage does an excellent job as a private detective trying to find out if the girl in the film was actually killed? They are both exciting as cage is drawn deeper and deeper into the L.A. society behind it all. A must see for Cage fans.",1281744000,2,548,4.036697247706422
3555961,5,B001ELRCS2,"Thank you for a quick shipment and the DVD was in great condition, no flaws.  Thank you 8MM is a great twisted movie of how sick people can be with extreme S&M snuff films, but how true it is. I loved it.! ha!

8298718,4,B001ELRCS2,"8mm was about a private detective that was hired by rich widow  that just lost her husband
and he found a 8mm film in her late husband's private vault,
she wanted to know  if the film was real and if the women in the film was really dead or  was she alove
without giving away what all happens, i will say, there is some blood shed and lots of nudity in the film,
because of places  the detective has to go, but , did he find out and is the girl dead or not
of you watch this, you will be stuck to your seat wanting to find out what happens next
the end will make you wonder about  snuff films and why was they were made and what kind of people would do this.
8mm2- has nothing to do with the first, in fact its not even about what happened in the first one
in this film, its about a young couple that thats planning there wedding and they go to pruque
and rent a resort for the weekend and decide to go to a party put in by the cremiln there
the boyfriend goes to the bar to get a drink and his fiance stays on the dance floor and another women starts to press her body against
the finaces and dances closely with her and trys to seduce her to do cocaine with her and her boyfriend
is watching the two ladies and falls  for the sexy look and he fantasies what he would do with  then together,
the cople finds out later that someone had been video taping them in there suit making out
and was threatened to put it in the internet if there did not come up with a certain amount of money was delivered,
from here , the show points in a lot of places to imagination, to a escort service , stripbar and so on
the couples possible marriage is threatened a few times and someone gets hurt, you have to watch, there is more nudity in this film
but, again, its the places that are visited and it all ends in a weird way, that really makes no sense!",1521331200,,1839,3.9809782608695654

8298722,5,B001ELRCS2,"This is a guilty pleasure movie for me. It has a very compelling story line, but the acting really drags the quality down. James Gandofini is in it, and he does the usual tough bad guy thing that he is so good at. Peter Stormare gets some screen time too. His performance is a bit eccentric and over the top, but a well done sicko. There is a handful of other actors that went on to do bigger and better things as well. Nick Cage is awful in it, as if he has little or no acting ability at all.. oh wait... That being said, its a few steps above say, Wicker Man, or  Peggy Sue Got Married. Damn... Now that I think of it, I've seen a lot of this guy's terrible movies.  I need to get outside and away from the tube more.",1498262400,,720,3.9586206896551723
