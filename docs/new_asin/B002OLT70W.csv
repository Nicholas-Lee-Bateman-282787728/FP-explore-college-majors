8376089,3,B002OLT70W,"This was not a horrible DVD, but it could have been better. The DVD pertained to the construction of Lines 2 and 3 in the Athens Metro. They were built to relieve the overcrowded Line 1. However, the construction was controversial since tunnel boring machines would have to be used and some people feared that the TBMs would damage structures from Ancient Greece. As a compromise, archaeologists were allowed to excavate the sites before the construction began. The Athens Metro desperately needed Lines 2 and 3. Athens was densely populated and exhaust from automobile traffic damaged the marble antiquities. The expanded Athens Metro was instrumental in Athens securing a bid for the 2004 Olympics. Some of the stations even display artifacts.

I felt that this DVD focused too much on Greek history and not enough on the construction methods used (I read enough of the Odyssey in high school). They could have explained when and how Line 1 was built or who built the rolling stock. This is a fairly interesting DVD, but there were so many unanswered questions.",1397865600,,1063,4.93854748603352
