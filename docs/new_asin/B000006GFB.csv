1194704,4,B000006GFB,"Anyone who was living during the 50's or who may be a fan of the time period would be missing out if they failed to sit back and enjoy this movie as I have on numerous occasions.  Not only is the movie funny, but the sets  and the music are top notch.  Mischief gives you a sense of being there or  wishing you were there.  Doug Mckeon is the star of the movie along with a  young Kelly Preston.  Many people may not have heard of Mr. Mckeon but he  was perfect for his role as Johnathan.  Other movies I would recommend  include American Graffitti, Back To The Future which includes a trip back  to the fifties, Peggy Sue Got Married, Grease, The Wanderers which takes a  look at the early 60's, and from a televison series standpoint....Happy  Days.",911865600,5,751,4.316546762589928

1194743,5,B000006GFB,"Good laugh about growing up in a more innocent time. Easy to identify with so many of the characters. The bully. The cool guy. The naive guy. The hot chick. The girl next door. The ugly duckling that becomes a swan. Love the soundtrack. A lot of good doo-wop 50's music. So glad I could obtain the DVD, my VHS tape was getting worn out",1484784000,,335,4.1692307692307695

1194782,3,B000006GFB,"As one who was a teenager during the 50s and 60s, this film brings back all the memories and music of the time.  The characters are very likeable and, while it doesn't break any new ground, it is a lot of fun.  They even do a car race emulating Rebel Without a Cause, of course, it doesn't try to be that film, but, that is what we did at that time when there was a star or movie that we loved.  However, it has some sexy scenes that I feel would be inappropriate for those under 17.",1474588800,,483,3.9587628865979383

1194822,2,B000006GFB,If you check the cast you will see that only one of the actors went further than this one brief splash. The only reason to watch this film is because a very young Kelly Preston has an extended sex scene where we discover that she is not a natural blonde. This scene is on-line for free through Bing videos.,1455753600,3,306,4.203389830508475

1194829,4,B000006GFB,"""Mischief"" is one of those cute -80's style romantic comedies we all loved.  Set in the 1950s, it follows the stars as they explore not only their sexuality, but romance and relationships.  Look for a stunningly beautiful Kelly Preston bearing it all quite tastefully.  (She reprises this role, incidentally, in ""Amazon Women On the Moon"" without the nudity.)  It lacks the rapid-fire humor of movies like ""Sixteen Candles"" and ""Better Off Dead,"" but is nonetheless thoroughly enjoyable.  A perfect 'rainy day' movie!",1449532800,2,517,5.2560975609756095

1194833,5,B000006GFB,"This is a great story about growing up in the 1950s with good Rock & Roll music, and a great cast of actors/actresses that make this movie fun and enjoyable to watch. The favorite here is Kelly Preston, who is a gorgeous woman even today. Kelly Preston does a nude scene and I must say, that she has one of the most incredible bodies, I've ever seen on the silver screen. A great movie to watch I enjoyed the music and the movie.",1448409600,,429,4.180722891566265

My review will offend Christians in the crowd...
heck! It's going to offend ME, but I h-a-v-e to
repeat what I heard in an audience when I first
saw this in a movie theater.
At one point where the two folks on the DVD
cover get naked, two soldiers screamed out [in
the theater I was sitting in] ""Lookie there! The rug
don't match the curtains.""
Well, the bleach-blond looked just fine to ME!
By the movie, and enjoy the film. Oh! The car the
two are seen in---the DVD case cover---is NOT the
one she gets her panties ripped off in... T-h-a-t was
a pea-green Studabaker... but, both cars get demo-
derbied in the final moments of the car.

It made me laugh out loud!  And motivated me to buy it!

Why?

Frankly, I could relate to the story!  And to (more-or-less) paraphrase another reviewer...

The young lady who was destined to be Mrs. John Travolta (Kelly Preston), when she was created,
they definitely did some OUTSTANDING work...WOW!  Definitely a physical specimen!

Good movie from the 80's!

1195009,3,B000006GFB,"""Mischief"" is kind of a fun movie, made during a wave of 1950s nostalgia (and therefore set in the '50s), but carrying the same themes that pretty much every teen movie in the '80s had. It's a long way from being great and doesn't elevate to the level of humor of ""16 Candles,"" the cleverness of ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off,"" the sexuality of ""Porky's"" or the downright debauchery of ""The Last American Virgin."" But it has moments of all four, and what everyone remembers most about this movie is Kelly Preston's full-frontal nudity in a sex scene (the only flesh exposed in the film).

Unfortunately the film is lacking in memorable scenes elsewhere. Four or five gratuitous nude scenes would have done this movie some good. Instead it's just an average film, definitely worth viewing more than one time but not worthy of being mentioned among the top films of the genre for its decade.",1412985600,,885,4.709677419354839

However, Mischief is much better than most sex comedy offerings. The performances are excellent. The characters are rather realistic and relatable. Like some other '80s bawdry, the story is actually fairly intelligent and heartfelt. I am not surprised, for the script is somewhat autobiographical (for Noel Black, not me). And, Mischief explores a 1950s America not always acknowledged. Real-life was not always wholesome and Leave It to Beaver. People led real lives, some of them R-rated.

His neighbor is a simpering coward with a crush on the hottest blond at school. Soon the greaser has taken charge of the wimp's sexual campaign.

The story is pretty basic- guy likes girl who seems to have no problem de-flowering him despite the fact that he is the dorky loser virgin nice guy. His best and only friend is the cool cat new to town who has the hots for a girl out of his price league. Not much really exciting happens unless you count the sex scene where the virgin loses his virginity to the slutty girl who happens to be a very fully naked Kelly Preston way before she became Mrs. John Travolta. I saw WAY more than I wanted to see of Mrs. Travolta whose rug, by the way, does NOT match the curtains. Don't know why but I always thought she was a natural blonde. But NOOOO! Anyway this is just a cute little high school movie with a love triangle since the geeky Jami Gertz has a crush on the nerdy virgin. I can't imagine anyone actually wanting to watch this movie unless they had quirky taste like I do for 80's high school flicks that are set in earlier times...

1195166,5,B000006GFB,just what I ordered  and it is a great comedy for the that era .... the real people  that the story would have come from  would not be much different from this story !,1357084800,,167,3.8529411764705883
1195167,3,B000006GFB,"Once upon a time in the late eighties (1986 or so.) I was channel surfing as many of us do.  I turned on HBO to see a movie that I had heard of but did not see titled ""Mischief"" was on.  In a case of very good timing, I had turned on HBO just as Kelly Preston was stripping naked.  Needless to say I was amazed at what I saw.  Kelly Preston was so beautiful I could not believe it (What's even better was she did a full frontal scene.  Something you rarely see, at least at the time the movie was made, 1985 specifically.).  I changed channels right after that scene.  My thought was, who needs to see anything else after that!

I did not think much of it for a long time afterwards.  Recently I saw the movie was available through Netflix and decided to see it just for the sake of seeing it.  As a whole ""Mischief"" is a harmless movie in the sense that it has a very good cast who does well.  In addition he producers did a very good job of recreating the time period of 1956 Ohio where the movie is set.  Once the movie was over I felt "" I have seen better I have seen worse."".  I believe that is what you will think as well.

The movie gets off to a very clever start with a spoof of ""Star Wars"".  After the 20th Century Fox logo appears, you see the famous opening sentence from every ""Star Wars"" movie:  ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...."".  After approximately five seconds the words ""Ohio 1956"" appear on the end of the sentence.  That got a small laugh out of me.  The saying ""It's all downhill from there."" thankfully does not apply here, but as I said it's not all that great.

As I said previously you can't knock the cast because they do well in their respective roles.  The standouts are Catherine Mary Stewart and, despite the fact that she only has a small part, Jami Gertz.  Speaking of Gertz, her character is one of the reasons why this movie is not all that great.  Not because of her personally or her acting ability, she does quite well in that area as I mentioned, it's just because her character uses old tired plot devices.  At the start of the movie she is an ugly nerd with braces, large glasses and her hair in pigtails.  At the movie's climax (The prom.  That's been done before.) her braces and glasses are gone and she lets her hair down to show she is actually quite attractive.  That's been done too many times before, on an episode of ""The Brady Bunch"" for example.

Jonathan (Doug McKeon) spends the whole movie lusting after the stunning Marilyn (Kelly Preston).  When he finally gets her, he realizes she is not the woman for him (Yawn.).  Plot devices such as this hurt the movie, but don't kill it all together.

If you're looking for something to pass a little time with on a day when you have nothing else to do, ""Mischief"" is the movie for you.  However, after you have finished watching it, you will forget about it pretty fast (Except for...).",1356566400,,2899,4.252747252747253

It's a romantic comedy about how the clumsy, no common sense or game having school geek tries to get with the school beauty queen with a little help from the school James Dean that is. Kelly Preston plays the alpha woman, you know the one that sparkles walking down the hall in High School, all the guys want her, all the other females want to be her, sex with her will add years to your life. There's one in every High School. I'm sure most of you have seen this storyline before in other movies so you already know how it turns out. Doug McKeon plays Preston's pursuer, the clumsy sex starved geek & I must say he doe's a very convincing job of it, so much to the point of where it gets annoying, to me anyways thats why I didn't give the movie 5 stars.

The resulting story is a wonderful delight of teen passion and romance with rivalries, mayhem and, of course MISCHIEF!",1330560000,,615,4.293103448275862

When Jonathon tried to say goodbye he got so choked up with emotion he couldn't say anything. He seemed so real, excellent acting.  The movie didn't pull any punches.  The boys talked and swore just like true teenage boys do.  They didn't soften down the language to make it more palitable for all ages.

The depiction of life of a male teenage ""horndog"", a misunderstood tortured soul heartthrob, and good girls who get the hots for bad boys.  These issues are represented well in this movie.

1195237,4,B000006GFB,"(3.5/5 stars)  Something that distinguishes a good coming-of-age film from your average teen sex comedy is the ability of the filmmakers to convince the audience the experience of making the film was nostalgic, even therapeutic for them. Whether it is ""A Christmas Story,"" ""Cinema Paradiso,"" ""My Life as a Dog,"" or ""Mischief,"" the product seems like a memoir, a romanticized trip down memory lane. OK, so ""Mischief"" isn't quite the caliber of the first three; nonetheless, this little story does a good job of evoking the atmosphere of Small Town, USA in 1956. Being successful takes more than simply adding hit songs from that period of time or getting the clothing or automobile styles correct; the story needs to pull us in and get us to sympathize with some of the characters, and this film succeeds in this. The actors all do a fine job in creating this sincere tale of an average teen, Jonathan (played by Doug McKeon), who reluctantly accepts help from the cool new greaser, Gene (Chris Nash), in getting his dream girl, Marilyn (Kelly Preston). Eventually Jonathan realizes friendship means more to him than his fantasies, which would have been better left unfulfilled. Look for Terry O'Quinn, who currently plays John Locke on ""Lost,"" in a brief role as Gene's father. Once again, Anchor Bay has performed a great service by creating a very clean widescreen transfer of a film that otherwise might not have seen the light of day.

Doug Mckeon is the little dwarf nerd who wants the hot popular blonde of his school.

Chris Nash plays the rebel without a cause stereotype misfit who befriends the little dwarf nerd and helps him to get his hot blonde dish.

He finally gets her in the sack but finds out later that beauty is only skin deep when she dumps him after commiting to go with him to the prom so that she can go with the big football king kahuna.

The rebel gets close to another guys girl and that girl dumps the beaver cleaver looking punk.

The rebel and beaver cleaver get into a big fight and eventually the rebel gets kicked out of school and so on...

It's been done before but so what...it's still a hoot and the great 50's soundtrack which is a mix of doo wop and just great rock n' roll boosts up every scene as well as the commited and passinate performances of the cast.

I must admit that after all these years after seeing it for the first time when i was 16 years old i still get extremely hot watching the delicious Kelly Preston get naked as she has one of the most luscious and incredible bodies i have ever seen.

Anyway, if you're looking not to boost your iq but to just spend a night havin' a good old time rockin' and rollin' and getting into the fun mischief that these kids get into then pop this baby in but i warn you that Kelly Preston's body will make your dvd player SMOKE!!!!!

1195245,5,B000006GFB,"This is a teen movie with the endless teen theme of boy seeking to get the goodies from the girl. It is better than the average for this genre due to several factors. Mostly, it is because is well done.

The subject matter lends itself to course treatment but that is not what is presented here. Instead, the situations are depicted with as much dignity as possible from hormone driven teenagers and is is presented with comedy.

The time of the film is the 50s. Society was more innocent back then but boys still had the same thing on their minds that they always have and always will. In this case, the school geek has a bad case for the school beauty queen. He is aided in his quest by the cool loner from out of town who has his own heart set on ""the nice girl"". Meanwhile, the unpopular girl has a bad case herself for the geek.

The geek achieves his goal and learns that the decorative aspects of women sometimes cover up the less desirable traits. The loner finds that the nice girl really is a nice girl and that love is something special. The unpopular girl undergoes a hormone miracle and becomes a prize catch. Everyone winds up happy except the town bully/rich boy. It is simplistic in its portrayal but no less appealing for that.

Kelly Preston plays the beauty queen and she really is the stuff of dreams until the wrapper comes off. Doug McKeon plays the geek who becomes a prize himself. Catherine Mary Stewart is the nice girl that I wish had lived next door to me and Jami Gertz is the metamorphosed hormone miracle. The cast is rounded out by Chris Nash. Each does a good job in the role. Teen angst comes to the fore and a worthwhile story actually results.

I remember wanting to walk out about halfway through.  Even looking for familiar locations got boring.

It was originally called HEART AND SOUL.  20th Century Fox, a major studio, produced this film--but I'm not sure what they were shooting for.  A sweet AMERICAN GRAFFITI knock-off with some teen 80's sex?  They changed the title to MISCHIEF to try and lure some of the PORKY's crowd, I think.

Any way you look at it, this movie doesn't work.  The kid from ON GOLDEN POND makes a surly little lead character.  The tough biker kid from the wrong side of the tracks is Fonzie-lite.  You reach a point in this film where you pretty much dislike everyone and couldn't care less what happens to them.

That point, for me, is the famous sex scene with the incredible Kelly Preston.  She is beyond hot and she looks spectacular naked.  This one scene is probably the only reason anyone now shows this film any interest.

But afterward, all rooting interest in anyone is lost.  The GOLDEN POND kid is a weasel for thinking only of himself, Kelly is a slut, etc.  Nothing special about these kids.

The cast is great, featuring Doug McKeon as a ""Fonzie"" type guy who wears a leather jacket, and Chris Nash as a nerdy (let's make that VERY nerdy) teenager who is trying his best to lose his virginity.  The friendship that develops between this unlikely pair is a treat to see.  It makes the movie a feel-good kind of experience that you will savor for days after the credits roll.
The female side includes the lovely Catherine Marie Stewart, playing a wholesome 1950s girl.  Kelly Preston plays a shallow & superficial babe who acts as a foil to Stewart's personage.  As tender as this all sounds, I would not recommend this film for family viewing.  Preston does a nude scene and I must concede.......she has one of the most incredible bodies I've ever seen.
The 1950s Rock & Roll songs in the movie are a wonderful complement to the story on-screen.  In truth, I've never cared too much for 50's Rock.  However, in this movie I found the songs very refreshing.  They did a lot to re-inforce the 1950s feel.  In fact, the songs comprise the whole soundtrack - there is no incidental music @ all in the entire film.

The song selections, choosen from that era, were beautifully choreographed for the situations, both funny and romantic. The acting was decent, the setting fantastic, and the transformation from an innocent, naive boy to one who wises up in the end was superbly done. I enjoyed this more than ""American Graffiti"", because it seemed more authentic from that time period, and the music choosen was simply perfect throughout.",1009670400,,494,5.333333333333333
1195319,5,B000006GFB,"This brought back a lot of memories (I graduated in 1963 from Lawton High of Lawton, Oklahoma)of cars,girls and fighting (without the guns and knives of today).  The drivein movies, drive in eateries and sevice stations.  Every class had a Marilyn, Bunny, Rosalie, Gene and the rich kid and Jonathans.  I wish they would make a soundtrack and put it on a DVD because my VHS tape is about worn out.  The original songs by Fats Domino and later covered by white groups were part of it too.  Elvis was thought to be an influence on rebellion but we were just kids wanting our own type of music-rock and roll.  Will always enjoy this movie-it compares to American Graffiti-growing up from innocent times and making plans for the future.  Gooooooood Movie.",1008720000,2,751,4.687022900763359
1195320,4,B000006GFB,"This isn't a great film but its still one of my personal favorites.  Basically, this storyline is familiar from anyone who saw any teen films in the mid-80s.  Likeable but nerdy boy falls for the school beauty and, with the help of a much cooler James Dean type, pursues her against tremendous odds (well, against her football player boyfriend anyway) and in the end, discovers that beauty is only skin deep.  However, this film manages to take that basic concept and actually liven it up with a sharp script, breezy direction that keeps the story moving, and finally some really winning performances, especially from Doug McKeon (the likeable geek in question who is hardly portrayed as an angel here), Catherine Mary Stewart as the type of girl we all actually loved in high school but didn't know how to talk to until college, and especially a talented actor named Chris Nash who takes on the stereotypical James Dean/rebel-without-a-cause role and actually reveals to us a vulnerable, genuinely likeable human being.  Nash's genius is that even though he's playing Dean's character, he doesn't allow himself to fall into a slavish imitation of Dean as so many other young actors have a tendency to do.  Instead, he creates his own, unique rebel.  Whatever happened to Nash after this film?  Of course, the film's real claim to popularity seems to be that McKeon's dream girl is played by Kelly Preston, back in her days when she was the hot blonde in every teen movie and had yet to marry John Travolta.  Though underrated as an actress, the true key to Preston's success in those films was her willingness to do more nudity than other young actresses and this film contains what is probably her best and most celebrated nude scene.  Of course, it helps that its also one of the rare explicit movie scenes that actually makes sense in terms of the plot, doesn't feel like exploitation, and actually has an unexpected payoff.  This is a film about sex and at times, its fairly explicit but its also very humorous and honest.  Watching this film, the characters truly come alive and you actually feel like you are just watching a bunch of teenage friends living the best years of their lives.",1001635200,171,2194,4.777777777777778
1195321,2,B000006GFB,One of the funniest and entertaining teeny bop movies of the mid 80's.  Up there with Fast Times and Porky's.  Kelly Preston...that sweet body of hers....FUGEDABOUTIT!!!!!,985305600,,171,5.538461538461538
1195322,4,B000006GFB,"Ok so I may be prejudice since I had a small role in this, but is gratifying to see that people still love it so much!  Is a funny and warm story and a kicking 50's soundtrack.  One of Catherine Mary Stewart's best  roles (and great lady to boot) and Doug McKeon is totally believeable as  Jonathon.  Enjoy!",953769600,,307,4.224137931034483
1195323,5,B000006GFB,"This movie was soooo cute!  Kelly Preston bugged me and Doug McKeon was okay.  I loved the touching love story between the ""Rebel"" Gene and the ""Girl Next Door"" Bunny.  I enjoyed watching their first  encounter, and their first kiss, and the ending!  As a person in her 20's,  I am always a sucker for a cute love story.  BUY THIS FILM if you love  romance and comedy.",947980800,2,368,4.3088235294117645
