1830688,4,B000089787,"Terry O'Quinn rocks as the Stepfather. This was a big improvement from the first volume with lots of subtle humor and scary moments; although, Meg Foster's eyes were probably the scariest part, lol. The commentary sucks, as most commentaries do. The deleted scenes should be deleted. For a B movie, this one is pretty good. Terry O'Quinn is underrated.

Skip the third movie because O'Quinn is not in it, and the plot sucks.",1091145600,6,424,4.808219178082192
1830689,4,B000089787,"Isn't about time they gave us a series of films about a malevolent stepfather? You just knew this would happen eventually what with the bad reputation stepfathers have in American culture. We all know they are evil beings with warped minds, human vultures with deranged value systems that seek out innocent families to prey upon. Now that I think about it, I heartily salute the filmmakers associated with the ""Stepfather"" trilogy for bringing this massive threat to wider attention. Certain individuals have formed a conspiracy to throw us off the trail by making movies about machete wielding killers wearing hockey and Halloween masks, but now that we have these films, we know the truth. Evil is more insidious than a massacre at a summer camp, more pervasive than a razorblade clawed monstrosity haunting our dreams. Wickedness, true wickedness, reaches out to us in the form of a middle aged white guy who wears cardigan sweaters while offering to play catch with us in the backyard. After watching this film, along with the two other entries in the franchise, I feel it is essential to alert the unwary to this horrific hazard. Run, don't walk, to pick up a copy of ""Stepfather 2.""
Terry O'Quinn returns as the enigmatic Stepfather in a sequel that continues the nightmares seen in the first installment. Locked safely away in a mental hospital at the beginning of the film, the Stepfather longs for the day when he can once again walk the streets of suburbia with his own idyllic family. First, he must escape from the facility, not an easy task considering how much the guards hate and fear him. Fortunately, a new psychiatrist decides to try a different tack with the Stepfather. By giving the inmate new freedoms and a sympathetic ear, this fool hopes to rehabilitate the sociopath. Oops. Of course, the Stepfather escapes after concocting an ingenious plan realized in part in the facility's woodworking shop and actualized in the shrink's office. As bodies fall to the floor in various states of permanent disarray, our anti-hero strolls off the grounds of the hospital as nice as you please. It isn't long before he's back to his old tricks, sitting in a hotel room sifting through advertisements and video dating tapes in search of a new bride who will give him everything he's ever dreamed of in life.
Enter Carol Grayland (Meg Foster) and her son Todd (Jonathan Brandis), a mother and child recovering from their recent separation/divorce from an overbearing father. When the Stepfather moves in across the street posing as a sensitive counselor named Gene (replete with notepad, pen, and the requisite sweaters), Carol discovers she's attracted to the guy. The clincher comes when she accidentally stumbles on Gene playing friendly authority figure to Todd. Despite a few warnings about the counselor from a nosy postal employee friend, Carol charges ahead with plans to marry Gene. Serious warning signs, like the sudden disappearance of her ex-husband and the terrible suicide of her postal employee pal, fail to register on Grayland's radar. And why should it? Certainly Gene wouldn't have anything to do with such unseemly incidents. Alas, disturbing evidence to the contrary finally emerges immediately before the two love birds exchange vows. A wedding has never been such a bloody affair as the union between Gene and Carol Grayland. And once again, if only fleetingly, the Stepfather's plans for the domination of the American family unit is once again foiled. Or is it? The existence of another sequel seems to say no. Sadly, Terry O'Quinn fails to return in that movie.
All kidding aside, ""Stepfather 2"" is a very effective horror film. It is rare to see so many elements click in a film in this genre. The performances are much better than you would expect, with Terry O'Quinn leading the way as the oily killer. His portrayal of a sociopath with a one-track mind is chilling to behold. One minute he's the caring suitor to Carol and the benevolent father figure to Todd, but look out when things don't go his way. Only a few people survive one of the Stepfather's killing rages. O'Quinn plays it all with ease, conveying a complex range of emotions with subtle facial gestures. Equally effective is the always awesome Meg Foster as Carol Grayland. You've seen Foster in several other films, ""They Live"" serving as a prime example, so you know she's the gal with the amazing eyes. I never tire of watching this actress in a movie, so her addition to the cast was a good one. Even Jonathan Brandis does an acceptable job as the surprisingly nonirritating Todd. Set these good actors up with a surprisingly engaging plot and sauce heavy murders and you have all the fixings for a great film experience.
The DVD has several surprising extras. You would think a sequel, probably a straight to video sequel at that, would be a bare bones production. Think again. You get a commentary track from the director and the producer, extensive alternate scenes, stills, and several trailers for other films like ""Dracula II,"" ""Below,"" ""Asunder,"" and ""Halloween: Resurrection."" It's been a few years since I saw the first ""Stepfather"" film, but if memory serves me correctly I would have to say that this sequel is as effective, if not more so, than the original. Still, I am looking forward to the day when they release the first and third movies on DVD.",1085184000,17,5370,4.895718990120747

1830691,5,B000089787,"I actually enjoy Stepfather 2 more than the first Stepfather movie. The haunting theme does a lot for creating a truly sinister atmosphere. Rarely does a film score stick in my head, but this one does. And then there's Terry O'Quinn who plays the character just right.
You have to remember that this film was basically made in only 4 months. That's writing the script, casting, shooting, post production, etc. It was made for about 1 and a half million dollars and originally was supposed to be a direct to video release. Some additional shots were added and changed when the studio decided it was going to run a theatrical release like the first Stepfather, and they needed a more violent ""Horror Movie"".
The DVD release presents the film in it's original Widescreen format, and it's a very sharp Animorphic transfer. A great thing included on the disc is that it has many alternate and extended scenes that were from the original Director's cut. There is also a short still gallery, and a very interesting full-length commentary by the Director and Producer of Stepfather 2. The only thing missing is a theatrical trailer...albeit most Buena Vista DVD's lack a trailer so it's no big surprise there.
If you like this film then you need this DVD, it easily blows away the old VHS and Laserdisc editions. Now, if only they'd release the 1st Stepfather movie on DVD!!!",1049587200,24,1367,4.772151898734177

1830707,4,B000089787,"""Stepfather II"" (creepily sub-titled ""Make Room For Daddy"") knows he isn't the original. He knows you probably won't care for him as much as the one that came before him. But he would like to try. Maybe if you just spent some time with him, you'd grow to appreciate that he is not in any way or form trying to replace his predecessor but that he's always there for you if you need him.

With that in mind, the low-budget sequel to the surprise slasher/thriller flick, ""The Stepfather"" is a noticeable yet serviceable step-down from the original. Director Jeff Burr, who would go on to helm other horror sequels like ""Leatherface: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre III"" and ""Pumpkinhead II: Blood Wings"" does a pretty decent job of keeping ""Stepfather II"" from being too much of a step-down in quality. While the suspense from the original is all but gone, the film moves at a nice pace that compliments its somewhat contrived feeling. You might not be surprised or shocked while watching the film, but you'll never find yourself counting the minutes until it's over, either.

It helps that the film boasts a solid cast. Leading the pack is the indispensable Terry O'Quinn, returning to the titular role. O'Quinn is given many an opportunity to expand on the character and have a little fun with it, and boy, does he. One absolutely killer line in particular -- the disgusted ""I even had sex with you, for God's sake!"" -- hinges completely on his deadpan delivery and his commitment to the character. Meg Foster plays his would-be wife, and as with anything she's appeared in, she's a pleasure to watch and classes up the whole affair in the process. A young Jonathan Brandis plays the hapless and clueless kid to perfection, while Caroline Williams entertains as the suspicious and somewhat obnoxious best-friend and neighbor, making the perfect foil for O'Quinn.

The film was born in the era of mindless yet enjoyable slasher sequels and it shows. There is a lot of extra violence and gore that was shoe-horned in at the last minute, much to the dismay of the director, and often the film plays for cheap thrills whenever possible. But while it is nowhere near as effective as its predecessor, it is an enjoyable and breezy 89 minutes just the same. Worth seeing just to see Terry O'Quinn do his thing once more (he would be replaced in the mostly unseen third installment) and certainly of interest to any fan of '80s horror just the same. If you make room for daddy,""Stepfather II"" promises not to disappoint.",1445472000,,2507,4.745412844036697

Bottom line is, anything with ""Terry O'Quinn"" in it is gonna be good and watchable. I love him in ""LOST"" as Locke. But anyway it was gonna be really tough to make a sequel as good as the 1st one.

Rate: 8

8/12: How weird is that the film Stepfather II doesn't include The in the beginning. It just feels more comfortable saying it. Anyway, Terry O'Quinn improbably comes back to reprise his famous role after his character gets stabbed in the heart with a large butcher knife. The stab was pretty deep as well. I'll be interested in knowing if anyone actually survived this type of an attack before. Based on what I've seen out of Jerry Blake/Henry Morrison/Gene Clifford (whatever his name is), there is absolutely no way he would be deemed insane to land in the psychiatric hospital. He is a criminal, plain and simple. I question Gene's methods. Why bother with offing Matty? It's just a random freak coincidence. Maybe the high school thought that it finally traced the guy, but Jerry just happens to have the same name. Pretty harmless. What he should have done is report to the superiors at the postal office that Matty had been opening his mail, a federal offense. The rest of the way is not so bad at all; sometimes it can be viewed better than the original. Acting-wise, Terry is better than before. Poor Jonathan Brandis, it might be the early warning signs, hm? It is amusing to see Matthew Laurence in this picture to play a character who is a dentist and cheats on his wife. How Beverly Hills 90210. All in all, Stepfather II proves that sequels do not always suck.",1346284800,,1395,4.647773279352227
1830750,5,B000089787,"Despite seeming to be quite dead after being stabbed in the chest and taking a tumble down some stairs at the end of the first film, the titular stepfather, still using his most recent name ""Jerry Blake,"" is incarcerated in an insane asylum. Needless to say, it isn't long before he escapes, murdering his psychiatrist in the process.

The stepfather soon moves to California where he starts a new life for himself, and begins searching anew for his perfect family. Posing as a psychiatrist named Gene Clifford, the stepfather begins a romance with Carol Grayland, the real estate agent who sole him his new house. Carol is a recent divorcee with one son, Todd. Ideal for ""Gene"" to begin setting himself up as husband to Carol and stepfather to Todd.

Everything is going swimmingly for Gene until Carol's ex-husband Phil returns and starts trying to get back with her, threatening to edge Gene out. In the meantime, Carol's friend Maddy is suspicious of Gene. She doesn't believe he's actually a psychiatrist, and begins trying to dig up his past. Things being unraveling quickly for him, all headed towards the inevitable disastrous, blood-drenched climax.

This was a completely unnecessary (and theoretically impossible!) sequel. Fortunately, it's also quite good, thanks to a fairly good story and of course the acting. Terry O'Quinn returns as Jerry/Gene and delivers the same strong, terrifying-yet-sympathetic performance he did before, and Meg Foster and her gorgeous eyes as Carol is the other half of this doomed romance.

This DVD is quite excellent. It's a somewhat mediocre sequel that's given the same special edition treatment as its predecessor. There's an audio commentary, a documentary and several deleted and alternate scenes. The Stepfather II apparently had a slightly troubled production history, with the studio reshooting some scenes to make them more violent.

Things appear to be going well until her estranged husband returns to reconcile and her closest friend begins growing suspicious of her new fiance. The sequel does offer a familiar plot, but with weaker characters, writing, and suspense, it ends up feeling more like a cheap imitation than a true continuation story. TerryO'Quinn remains to be the only ingredient in the film that works, although his performance feels much less inspired than before.  Sequelitis has also set in, as the blood and gore have been noticeably increased in order to capture some of the late 80s Slasher audience. While it may not be as enjoyable as the original, THE STEPFATHER 2 maintains a similar style and tone that should appeal to series fans.

See we've always been very big on late night horror viewings and consider these two decades to have some of the finest work out there. Not that they're actually really great movies, but they are so perfectly entertaining in the sense of b.

Terry O'Quinn returns as super psycho Jerry Blake as he spends his time in a mental institution after his first installment of murders. He winds up breaking free and getting back out there on the streets in search of a new wife. He begins a new identity as psychiatrist Dr. Gene Clifford and moves into a nice home in anytown USA.

Her friend (Caroline Williams from Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2) suspects that something isn't quite right with the new beau however, as do some others, and it isn't long before there are grisly demises for many.  Capably directed by Jeff Burr (Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3, From a Whisper to a Scream), this installment is certainly bloodier, and definitely not as serious as the first film before it, but despite all that, Stepfather II is still worthwhile thanks to the performance of Terry O'Quinn, who manages to be magnetic, frightening, and even hilarious all at the same time.

1830792,3,B000089787,"Ah, the only thing good to come out of Hollywood regurgitating, er, I mean remaking old horror films is that it gives who ever owns the rights to the original a money incentive to release special editions of the originals, for the first time ever in regard to the first Stepfather.  Here we have an unlikely sequel in Stepfather II.  Unlikely because the original, while being extremely well received critically, came and went at the box office.  Once on video the original started gaing steam and became a hit similarly to the original Austin Powers.  So, about two years later a direct to video sequel was planned and Terry O'Quinn was courted to reprise his very complex role.  They eventually got him and a sequel was made.

Firstly, this is a pretty good film as far as sequels go.  Of course, it requires huge leaps of faith right from the top.  At the end of the original Stepfather Terry O'Quinn's character was definitively DEAD.  No, not wounded, no not take off to prison, but totally and absolutely D-E-A-D.  This sequel makes the wise diecision to just start with The Stepfather in mental institution with some knife wounds.  No big explanation of how he survived, but there he is and he has.  Much better then some convoluted soap opera explanation ala Halloween: Resurrection.  Then the plot moves into familar territory in the Stepfather escaping and resuming his old tricks, the persuit of the perfect family, under the guise of a marital therapist.  He courts Meg Foster(a stunning beauty whose exotic pale blue eyes limited her from getting more meaty parts).  When Meg Foster's character's ex shows back up, well....well, if you've seen the original Stepfather you know the rest.

Getting O'Quinn back in the title role is the main reason to see this sequel.  The sequel plays up the black humor elements from the first regarding O'Quinn's Reagan era inspired perfect family ideal, and closed off-ness to sexuality of any sort.  In this film when he is invited to be for some carnal knowledge he treats it more like a chore, job or duty rather then an act of passion.  Hmmm, sounds like a typical conservative type. LOL.  Meg Foster is the woman in question and she is a very sturdy foil for O'Quinn to play off of.  She comes off interesting and understandable without seeming too much like an idiot, not noticing her finace' weird behavior.  Caroline Williams(Texas Chainsaw Massacre II) plays the obligatory best friend, who also conveniently happens to be a mail carrier.  Jonathan Brandis plays Meg Foster's son in one of the young actor's earlier roles.  They're all solid and lend a level of realism that a sequel of this nature desperately needs.

The problem with this sequel, beyond the fact that it's a sequel, comes in the form of the ending.  The ending is very hurried and doesn't quite live up to the build up the first two thirds of the film promises.  Sure, you get some great blood battered bride imagery, but that's about it.  Joseph Ruben did a much better job of miling the suspense and thrills from his rote finale to the original Stepfather.  Plus, once you've seen the first film, you know the routine and in this film, though they do throw in some nice twists(the blind neighbor is quite inventive and hysterical), we've been here and done this before.  O'Quinn creates such a compelling character that he keeps you in the game if the plot doesn't.  Plus, it's hard to simply just except The Stepfather being alive at the top of the film.  For a few minutes the contrivance reminds you naggingly so that the first film was a masterpiece of the genre.  Once O'Quinn gets rolling with his character it helps ease the pain that comes with sequel-itis, but it may not work the same way for all.

Director Jeff Burr(Leatherface:Texas Chainsaw Massacre III, Pumpkinhead II) keeps things stylish and similar to a Dario Argento film from the late 70's.  I've listened to two commentary tracks from Jeff Burr, and he provides one for the new special edition of Stepfather II, and this one has a Leatherface tinge to it.  Burr seemed to have been one of the few innocent souls working in Hollywood in the eighties.  He talks, like in the case of Leatherface, about studio interference, and how some other director came in and added some slight gore scenes to his final cut.  A great anecdote on the commentary is how Burr sent a VHS copy of his first cut of Stepfather II to reknowned critic Pauline Kael to see, so she wouldn't judge the film based on the final product.  He says she wrote back, but doesn't go into detail on what was in the letter.  This commentary track is the same one that was on the Mirmax DVD released back in 2003, as is the alternate scenes(which showcase Burr's original and far more subtle take on the suspense scenes), but comes with a brand spanking new thirty minute retro doc interviewing Burr, the producers, editor, and screenwriter.  It was interesting to find out that this film actually did have a theatrical release.  The producers were so anamored with the final product that they put up the dough to put it in some theaters.  Then, they went as far as to make the third Stepfather film sands Terry O'Quinn(actually saw the third one first when I was twelve, it's not too good---mostly due to the lack of Terry O'Quinn).

I got this DVD really cheap used.  I'm not a huge fan of this sequel, but I love Terry O'Quinn's returning performance, and Burr's stylish direction, but most of all I like the black comedy that is further mined from the material.  It's not campy black comedy, it doesn't take you out of the suspense, but it's more abundant in this sequel.  It's worth checking out, at least renting.  I'd rather sit through this sequel then ever see the remake.",1256428800,,5742,4.6836327345309385

1830796,4,B000089787,"The Stepfather returns!

This was a pretty good sequel, I thought.

There are not many times when a sequel is nearly as good as the original, but I think that Jeff Burr pulled it off nicely!

What I like about this one is that the films picks up where the first finished. Jerry (well, no-one really knows his real identity), is locked away. He soon escapes and resumes back to his old ways of finding another family.

It's kind of a love-hate relationship with this character, because as intense and as much of a psychopath as he can become, Terry O'Quinn, makes the character really likeable in a twisted way.

At heart, he has family values, and he wants to live the american dream of the perfect, loving family, but each time, his new potenial family goes wrong and things end badly.

That said, it's a fun and entertaining movie.

Terry turns in another wonderful, yet psychotic performance (I say that with a smile on my face!), and another excellent performance by Meg Foster and Jonathan Brandis (R.I.P).

A must see- because you wouldn't want to disappoint him, would you?",1176163200,,1080,4.647368421052631
1830797,3,B000089787,"...but at least Terry O'Quinn stuck around for this one.  Jerry Blake's latest fiancee in this film is played by Meg Foster, an actress who has always given me the creeps for some reason.  I was actually rooting for Jerry Blake to kill her.

FOR SOME STRANGE REASON this sequel is on DVD and the original is not.  Go figure.  Are the ownership or distribution rights to the first one in dispute or something?

The first one RULES!  Great psychological horror and a career-defining performance by O'Quinn.  And director Joseph Ruben would go on to make some other great films, including ""Return To Paradise"" with Anne Heche and Vince Vaughn.

As for ""Stepfather 3""...  ignore it except for the fact that O'Quinn's replacement is Robert Wightman who actually does a very very good job replicating O'Quinn's mannerisms, body language, facial expressions, speech patterns, voice, etc.  It is more imitation than acting, maybe, but he's very good at it.",1157414400,,948,4.936708860759493
1830798,4,B000089787,"THE STEPFATHER was one of the most minor but great horror films to come out in 1987. Terry O'Quinn fit the role perfectly, and the rest of the cast, while not all filling their roles to a tee, nonetheless supported him well, making his character all the more believable in his psychotic rage. Now, I saw STEPFATHER 3 before this one, and I wasn't impressed with the third one and don't plan on owning it anytime soon. But there was one reason I bought this DVD and decided to give STEPFATHER 2 a chance: Terry O'Quinn.

You might all remember the end of the first film, as Jerry Blake (O'Quinn's character in part 1) brutally attacked his wife and daughter, having been disappointed that they are not ""perfect"". He was starting to make another life for himself, but he failed and ended up being stabbed at the end by Stephanie. Did the Stepfather survive the chaos? You better believe he did, thanks to some surgery and healing of medicine. I was hoping for good things with STEPFATHER 2.

We pick up with the Stepfather (in the first frame still Jerry Blake) in a psychiatric institution, a little hair loss and a dream of the events from the prior film. We find that the Stepfather still likes to build houses out of wood, but not so much birdhouses anymore. He's seeing a psychiatrist and at first you feel bad for him because he looks like a poor schmuck the first time he sits in for a session. Ah, but you know by now this guy means business, and he makes a plan to escape, and he does...killing the psychiatrist and bludgeoning the security guard in his wake. He walks off the ground while in the background the alarm at the facility sounds off, marking an escape and panic ensues...all while our Stepfather calmly strolls off the grounds a free man. Now Jerry decides its time for a change, so he checks into a hotel, gets his hair back and changes look again, and starts to plan his next move (I was laughing because the bellboy never saw the picture on the paper...is it that obvious you're serving a killer?). He sees a dream house show on tv, and Palm Meadows seems like a good place to land his next life. He also picks his next identity in the form of family therapist Gene Clifford.

We pick up sometime later down in California near L.A., and Gene is looking at a house with beautiful real estate agent, Carol Grayland. After mentioning that she is divorced, and with son, well, our Stepfather is up to his old tricks again. He starts a session with divorced/troubled women and things seem to start off right for Gene. He has a new home; he meets a new woman; he even gets admiration from her son, Todd. Things seem to be going good, and even Carol's best friend, Matty (the sexy Caroline Williams), likes Gene. However, things suddenly change when Carol's ex-husband shows up to reconcile...and that just isn't sitting well with Gene, and instantly it triggers a reaction. He goes to the garage and starts cutting and throwing wood on his trusty saw-board device, and we see echoes of the first film in his presence of anger. But when snoopy Matty shows up looking around, she begins to suspect Gene isn't really who he claims to be. She starts to snoop through his mail, eventually finding a ""letter"" that triggers her suspicion confirmation. All the while, Gene kills off Phil after meeting with him to talk about his reconciliation with Carol. He checks Phil out of his hotel, puts his things in the trunk with his body, and then drives his car to a junkyard smashing it around and then casually leaving whistling his fave Camptown Races (this is going to be a fatal flaw later). Things seem to get better again, until Matty finds out about Gene and then summons him for a meeting in the park, which ultimately leaves our stepboy a bit off. He makes love to Carol before leaving to kill off Matty and then brings back a bottle of wine. He sets Matty's death up like a suicide, but a blind man is the only witness to Gene's diabolical deed. Things start to go downhill a bit and Gene begins to worry his wedding day is in jeopardy. And on the big guy's big day, things do take a turn for the worse. After Carol sees the wine bottles, and then hears her son whistling Camptown Races, Gene is exposed, and the mayhem ensues, with the Stepfather once again being killed by a courageous child and a strong but battered mother. Poor Stepfather, his intentions are admirable but his methods of getting there are far from conventional.

The acting in the movie is mostly typical, but Terry O'Quinn is once again masterful as the evil stepdad out for another ""perfect"" family. He conveys the character so well...he was built for this role and, thanks to his performance, the movie is memorable. Meg Foster and Jonathan Brandis are also good, and surprisingly, Brandis isn't annoying...the kid can act and he put on a good show. Meg Foster's eyes are creepy, but she's pretty so you'll forgive that. The violence isn't obvious, but it's there and what we see still makes you cringe. The movie as a whole isn't as gripping as the first, but it still makes a very good sequel...entertaining, suspenseful at times, and never cartoon-ish.

STEPFATHER was an entertaining cult hit. STEPFATHER 2 manages to convey some of the first's power and execution, and thanks to Terry O'Quinn, manages to be memorable for the most part. Sadly, O'Quinn would not return for the third entry, and so the pale Robert Wightman was chosen to replace him. Avoid the third sequel like the plague and, instead, watch the first film, and this entertaining sequel. But in watching, you'd better ""make room for daddy!""",1130803200,12,5600,4.584830339321357
1830799,4,B000089787,"Stepfather was a vastly underrated Horror film that dealt with the psychotic Terry O' Quinn (one of my favorite actors) once again trying to find the perfect family and the perfect life.  We never really know his chracter's true name as he constantly adapts new alias's to find new families to move into and eventually kill.  This time he escapes from the mental facility where he was placed after the events in the first film.

He takes on the alias of Dr. Gene Clifford, a marriage counselor and moves to an idyllic subdivision.  He eventually sets his sights on widow Carol Grayland (Meg Foster) and her son Todd (Jonathan Brandis).  Once again Gene seems like the perfect dad but this time some of the neighbors and friends of Carol begin to suspect something is not right.  Gene responds by killing anyone who gets in his way and tries to interfere with his perfect life.

The film basically follows the same formula that the first did but that's ok because it's a solid formula and O'Quinn is so very watchable in everything he does.  Meg Foster is far better in her role as the wife this time than the bland Shelly Hack was in the first.

7980409,5,B000089787,"Terry O'Quinn returns (after much contractual recapitulation of needs) in the role of Harry Morrison/Jerry Blake/Bill Hodgkins/Gene F. Clifford (a.k.a. The Stepfather) and this time wrecks havoc on Carol Grayland and her son Todd when he escapes a rather lax psycho ward at a state prison and insinuates himself into the lives of the lonely lady and her offspring. But Gene Clifford doesn't have this murder/invade/infiltrate gig down pat yet, and (just like the doomed Jerry Blake) he soon gets his facts mixed up, starts whistling in front of an older blind man with an impeccable memory, and takes a fancy bottle of wine from one of his victims (the great B-movie queen Caroline Williams, who was so good in TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE 2), ultimately setting himself up to fall for his wedding day which, as you may have guessed by now, doesn't go exactly as planned.
Directed by the brilliant genre movie favorite Jeff Burr, STEPFATHER 2 comes complete with a DVD cover and packaging art scheme that makes it look a lot more gruesome than it ultimately is; the new Synapse special edition DVD is a must have item for all genre buffs, especially since Red Shirt Productions has wisely chosen to continue the chronicling of the saga's production histories. Here, director Burr and producer Darin Scott recount the rather harried production of the film, how it was made within a very compressed time limit, and how the script (begun by the rather proficient John Auerbach) underwent a few changes on its way to the screen. Scott, who also briefly discusses the tragic demise of actor Jonathan Brandis, explains the process of being hired by ITC alongside of Burr, and the two relate how the creation of a new genre horror division afforded them a job opening here. Burr relates his frustration at being berated (by the Weinstein kids!) because he didn't put enough blood and thunder into the shooting of this ""horror"" movie--but the DVD includes a nice selection of deleted scenes so that the viewer can get a better idea of what kind of film that Burr himself really wanted to create. Still, if the Weinsteins had not gotten involved the picture would have suffered minor distribution instead of getting a proper theatrical release (as it ultimately did)--nonetheless, one cannot help sympathizing with Burr in his estimation that the picture was fine in his originally imagined version. The documentary also closes with a great hand-made recording of O'Quinn performing his song ""Bad Daddy Blues"" over the closing credits--and this is a fantastic find! O'Quinn has a hilarious sense of humor, and the rhythm will get your foot tapping while the song's dark, ironic lyrics can't help but make a horror fan smile.
Now, while the picture does contain blood, it isn't really as over the top as it could have been, and O'Quinn's amazing performance again elevates the already intriguing material into a new realm of genre film greatness. As Burr himself mentions in the making of featurette, following the original STEPFATHER movie was from the get go a daunting task, but overall I deem the picture to be nearly as enjoyable as the first. The reshoots (done by a different director after the Weinstein guys fired Mister Burr) are pretty worthless and obviously do not fit with the rest of Burr's movie; however, there is a hilariously dark moment when O'Quinn's character slams a man's hands in a car trunk and we see the amusing expression of shock and horror on the victim's face--it is classic horror dark humor/irony. What really hurt the movie was the shoddy marketing campaign, which opted for submitting goofy, slasher movie style ads and trailers instead of putting together a slowly building suspense movie trailer (such as the original picture utilized). Of course, the original STEPFATHER picture is a tremendous Saturday afternoon thriller and one of the best concept movie/horror satires ever, but don't think that this sequel does the original an injustice. Really, even on the surface, it is a fantastically entertaining picture.
Synapse catches up with SHOUT FACTORY's wonderful DVD of the original film by including a plethora of great extras (including the original trailer, and the aforementioned deleted scenes) and a fanciful audio commentary by Burr and Darin Scott in which the two of them stay on topic very well but have fun nonetheless repeating the history of the movie's making for listeners, with Scott ribbing Burr here and there and giving a very informative and insightful look at how these kinds of pictures get financed and released (something of interest to all filmmakers everywhere). The Synapse DVD offers a tremendous picture and sound transfer, with the volume crisp and loud enough to register, and the image fairly clean and tight for such a smaller scale affair. The movie might remind some of darkly dreaming afternoon soap opera style fluff, but those who enjoy this kind of movie will absolutely love it. And for fans it is a must own in any case.
