7000060,4,B00T4LLNQ6,"This is a beautifully produced film, with well-researched material. What it lacks is interviews with people who knew the McCollum's during the time of the murder, and who could also give an accurate portrayal of the motivation of Ruby McCollum to commit the murder. More specifically, her role in the affair with Adams is underplayed, leading the viewer to believe that she was a helpless victim. Contemporary accounts of the affair by her African-American attorney, Releford McGriff, are quite different, quoting her as saying, ""I pick my men from the top, black or white."" She also bragged about her affair, and the Pittsburgh Courier reporters who covered the case reported that it was a torrid love affair that went sour over time. Contemporaries report that the affair deteriorated only when Loretta, Ruby's child by Adams, was born, and the affair was rubbed in Sam McCollum's face.

  What bothers me the most about the film is that many of the commentators are too young to have witnessed this story, and most are not from Live Oak. These people are parroting the research of William Bradford Huie, as if they had personal knowledge of the facts. Those who were old enough to remember, had little knowledge of the affair between Adams and McCollum, and none worked with either Adams or the McCollums. Also, relatives interviewed were not living in Live Oak when the murder happened. It is apparent that the farther removed in time, the more sympathetic family descendents and relatives of descendents are of Ruby. But they did not know her, so their opinions of her are what they would like to think she was like.

  The appearance of Ruby's classmate to give a description of her, and the tape of Huie, along with the statement of Ruby's sister are the most powerful points in the film. All of the other statements by relatives far removed from the story are meaningless to the events of the story, and serve only to record the distant effects that it had on the family. Those feelings are certainly valid, but they do nothing to uncover the truth leading up to the murder, and there is nothing ""scientific"" about recording these comments, any more than there is about Tweeting opinions.

  I was really surprised to see the son of the then Clerk of the Court display the murder weapon. Why wasn't this weapon secured in the Courthouse vault, along with the slugs from the gun, which are there now? Why is this part of history now in someone's personal possession just because their father had control over it? This is a part of history, and it is not pleasant for anyone who values history and the lessons it teaches to see people taking personal trophies from murder trials. Of course, this is no reflection on the documentary itself.

  The documentary does have a number of errors. For example, Dr. Tammy Evans's remark that ""the town was unified in the statement that Ruby shot Dr. Adams over a doctor bill, nothing more, nothing less,"" is belied by the Courier reporting that Ruby McCollum was involved with an affair with Dr. Adams and that his murder was a crime of passion. This was also the statement of Releford McGriff, Ruby's African-American attorney, recorded by William Huie. Further, it was Ruby McCollum who created this scenario of the doctor bill. According to her own attorney, she did so to distract Adams so that she could shoot him in the back since she could not fend off his attempts to defend himself due to her small size. In short, Dr. Evans has no knowledge base for her statement that the doctor bill story was the only one circulating at the time.

  A second error was the statement by Keith Black's relative that he retired to help Ms. Adams file her wrongful death claim against the McCollum estate. While Black did indeed leave his post after he knew he was not given another term, it was in the form of filing for and receiving disability from the State of Florida. In a letter dated September 16, 1954 to William Huie, Mr. Mawhinney, the Director of the Florida retirement system, writes, ""Mr. Black retired under the disability clause of the Retirement System on December 24, 1952,"" which, coincidentally, marked the end of the McCollum trial. Further, he was ""totally and permanently disabled from performing his work,"" during the course of the trial, as determined by a state-appointed physician. The letter continues, in what is apparently the obvious question asked by Huie, stating, ""It has never been tested in the Courts of the State whether after a person retires under disability, he can continue to follow his profession..."" So, Keith Black was determined to be disabled during McCollum's trial, and supposedly unable to perform his duties. This explains why his assistant, O.O. Edwards, carried the prosecution under his supervision. The end result was that Black, because of his disability application, continued to receive money from the state, even when he was not given another term. (This letter is now in the Huie collection at the Ohio State University).

  I was impressed by the fact that the reporting of the trial was accurate, admitting that Ruby was allowed to testify about her affair with Adams. However, the documentary failed to report that numerous African-Americans were called to serve on the jury, yet opted out by objecting to the death penalty. One alternate juror was African-American. This is the first time in the history of Suwannee County that blacks were called to be on any jury, and is one of the many reasons I have written that this is the trial that shook the foundations of the Segregationist South. It is the impact of the trial, not the silencing of Ruby McCollum, that makes this a landmark trial in the history of Jim Crow ""justice.""

  This being said, Adams was a sociopath. He also enslaved at least one white woman that I know of with drugs, making him an ""equal opportunity"" villian. He also stole, lied and cheated rampantly, as all sociopaths do, with victims in both black and white communities--including his own uncle, Claude, and his close friend and owner of the Blue Lodge whose will he forged in an attempt to inherit his property. And, certainly, there was no chance that Ruby's delusion of being an equal with Adams would ever come true.

This being said, Adams, the victim, is the one who was truly silenced. We will never know his side of the story as we know Ruby's side from her testimony and her letters.

Finally, the documentary did little to show the devastation that the murder brought upon both families. Neither Huie nor Ruby's family members spoke in support of her actions and, in fact, her closest brother, Matt, blamed her for the murder when interviewed by Jet Magazine in the 1950s when she was in Chattahoochee.

Did Ruby have an alternative? Consider the plight of L.J. Hopps, the Suwannee County Bolita King prior to Sam McCollum. He packed up and left town with his money, leaving his house to Sam and Ruby when he got into trouble with the white community. Was this right? No. But it was the way things were during Segregation. And that is the lesson we should take from this story--that social change sometimes comes in painful ways, and not always through the justice system.

I was invited to appear in this film but could not since I had another conflicting obligation. In fairness, I have to state that I believe I would have been heard and included, allowing an alternative point of view from the filmmakers.

8700233,5,B00T4LLNQ6,"I am Whitfield Jenkins from Ocala, Florida and I have purchased and viewed a DVD of the Documentary You Belong To Me.  I find it to be very insightful, containing accurate and factual realities.  As a member of the family, it is my opinion that it is well-researched with a strong focus on illuminating truths has strong emotion components as one would expect in such a human and tragic incident and the results that follow.

I knew from the beginning because of the passage of time, elements of human actions that all the evidence, information, testimony, etc. the actual persons would not be in this documentary as originals.  However, in my early education, I was taught in science classes the principles of hypothesis. This was the principle of identifying and use of as many relevant facts as available, process them in the equation, then state the unknown and conclude the best accuracy from the equation.  In my opinion, the Producers over many years, worked intensively to identify relevant persons who had an important value to this work and include their contribution.  Great efforts produced important information (evidence) which has been purposefully concealed or was never brought forth in the past.  As a blood relative of Ruby McCollum, my spirit maintains an air of restlessness until this day which the documentary healed somewhat.  While I can't remember Ruby herself, I remember seeing her husband Sam McCollum, Sr. and Sam Jr. during their visit to the Zuber area immediately after the shooting.  Once Kay and Sonja established residences with their
Uncle and Aunt, Clemon Jackson, Sr. and Sarah, I associated with them until their deaths.  I did have the opportunity see Loretta at
least twice upon her visiting the area.  A very pleasant experience that I am presently having with the releasing of this documentary.
Approxiately three weeks ago, a diverse organization ( First Friday Forum ) that I  am a member of conducted a forum on Race. The
attendance was overwhelming. Since that Forum, I have shared the release information of the documentary.  The follow up  from white
members wanting to know more of the incident have been intense. Otherwise, this offers a great opportunity for race education which
is very much needed, even for the youths of today, for progress in race relations.

For me most of all, the Documentary raises and exposes the veil on the Justice System of that period and encourages a conversation
for today's system. Until this Documentary, the Ruby McCollum story was told in a manner to make her the total villain and maintain
Dr. Adams as pure. You Belong To Me provides black persons for the very first time the strong information to draw a conclusion independent
of white persons directive. For that reason I rate the documentary Five Star*****.

8700234,5,B00T4LLNQ6,"Why I think You Belong To Me  is a great film is because it touches a number of points that make it spectacular for it's time and relevant still today on many social issues regarding women and women's rights.

  You Belong To Me is a case of a wealthy Black woman, Ruby McCollum shooting a white respected doctor, Dr. Adams, in segregationist  Jim Crow ""justice,"" in Live Oak Florida in 1952.  This Astounding fact does not just make the case itself a stand alone point of interest; but  for me as a woman what screams from the balcony is not whether Ruby consented out of fear or power but that when a woman, any woman says no, it should be heard, accepted and respected. You Belong To Me asks the question, did Ruby really have a choice?

You Belong To Me also points out the Ku Klux Klan's power in Florida at that time was not fortuitous. Therefore, no black man could have sat on that jury and served justice without it being a matter of life or death.

  Why it is important to understand that Ruby's voice needed to be heard is because as the film You Belong To Me states  Ruby's ""choice,"" was mired in  muddiness.  If  ""no,"" means placing your family in jeopardy, losing shelter, do you really have a choice? If a man says I will help you, loan you money, charge you exorbitant amounts of interest, or in this case charge you highly priced  medical bills to add insult to injury so that your children can eat , go to school and have a home. Is this fair and reasonable?  When all the man  asks is a  small little price he expects you to pay with your soul in recognition of his generosity. The price is : you must  sleep with him,  and convey ""gratitude.""

You Belong To Me begs you to ask yourself how  can this ever  be considered mutual? Talk about abuse in spades, not only will you lie on your back but I will charge you for it... The man says : ""I'm going to call it love,"" or a woman's ""lust,"" and ""shame,""  so that he may appear unscathed, altruistic, seduced. powerless; and the woman, a harlett

You Belong To Me speaks of  a white man's power to dominate a  black woman because it his  rite. What a woman needs to call it, is irrelevant; as long as you comply, as long as the man's pleasure is paramount and the woman's incidental if at all.
 Is that really choice? You Belong To Me forces the viewer to ask these questions and to balance the scale by giving a victim a voice.

You Belong To Me points out that Dr. Adams was a sociopath. I believe that a sociopath does not selectively turn his psychosis off and on like a light switch. It is a festering open wound ready to explode and potentially paralyze anything in it's way. Having said that I do acknowledge that no-one can truly know what Dr. Adams was thinking or what Ruby McCollum was feeling since they are both now deceased.

  In You Belong To Me,  Dr. Adams was known to have drugged and enslaved a white woman, do you really think Ruby McCollum had a choice as a Black woman? This is the powerful message You Belong To Me sends. One does not leave men like this.

You Belong To Me wants yesterdays voice to ring with the relevance of  women today who  are still oppressed, badgered, harassed and forced to duck the longing eyes of desperate men, in hopes those desires are not manifested at their peril.

  You Belong To Me compiles powerful testimonials and re-enactments for the world to understand that  you really aren't  going to tell me a black woman in 1952 in the south with paramour rights from a 100 years earlier still in the shadows of the law, for men to 'glorify,' rape  ever had a choice?
