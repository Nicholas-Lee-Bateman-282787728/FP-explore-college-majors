8228959,3,B000XPU4SU,"I'm a new to golf enthusiast who's constantly seeking advice and tips to make my game less awful than it currently is.  I found the two Leadbetter discs informative but they were too technical for the novice - too much information was being directed at you to take it all in properly.  For the novice, at least, they're better watched in short bursts rather than all at once.

I did however find Butch Harmon's disc the best of the three.  He was clear, easy to follow, and the disc was well broken up into stages.  His instruction was clear and intelligible even to me.  And it did help - at least for a while...",1229385600,6,613,4.333333333333333
8228960,5,B000XPU4SU,"This is the first time my husband and I have seen a DVD or box set (whatever it's call) that offers insight from the top two guys in the game, Butch Harmon and David Leadbetter.  My husband and I are avid golfers and I purchased this for him.  The Harmon portion is broken down into the short game, swing and course knowledge/management.  Harmon also offers some nice insight into his past, I didn't know his dad was a Masters Champion.  The Leadbetter piece focuses on drills and tips you can use during practice sessions.  Leadbetter gets a little more technical with his instruction which we loved!  We have several golf videos, but this is by far the best one we own....five stars here!!!",1204848000,14,692,4.585365853658536
