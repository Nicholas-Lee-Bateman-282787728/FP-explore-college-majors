3465009,4,B001AR0D3Q,"This is one of my favorite shows.  I bought the set from Discovery Store and already watched the first season.  The kids are adorable and THEY are the reason I watch.  So many people have said horrible things about Kate.  News Flash:  She isn't perfect - just like the rest of us.  I don't agree with some of the things she does and the way she treats her husband.  But I still believe they love each other.  We don't live with them 24/7 so we don't know what really goes on.  Jon often says that their opposite personalities mesh well together.  I can't imagine the stress this woman has gone through the past 8 year.  I had my first child 4 months ago and I can't even imagine having more than one at a time.  Let alone SIX!  I say, unless you've had twins AND sextuplets and have walked in her shoes ... don't judge!  One previous reviewer said that they have/had 200 grand in their bank account ... how would she know??  It's crazy the things people think they know.  I don't personally know the Gosselins, but I admire them.  They are doing what they think is best for their family.  Yes, Kate bugs me sometimes, but I've learned a few things from her too, like organizing, etc.  I enjoy the show and will continue to watch as these beautiful children continue to grow and thrive.  The odds were so against their survival and it was through love, hard work, and dedication that this family is succeeding.  I wish them all the best.  So they get some free stuff.  So what....  I'd hate to have their monthly grocery bill!!",1216857600,10,1526,4.367857142857143
3465010,4,B001AR0D3Q,"I think that any program that spot lights children or animals will be a winner i.e The Dog Whisperer. The Gosselin children are no different. There are many special moments in this program. However, I have to admit that Kate's personality is quite hard to take. I can't help but wonder if she was as controlling, demeaning, belittling towards Jon before the children or if her brand of abuse is something that developed since having 8 kids. I have to applaud her for her hard work and dedication to her children, but someone.. brother Kevin, Aunt Jodi, friends Beth and Bob, or Nana Janet needs to tell Kate to lighten up! She and Jon has to get these children through their teenage years. There is only so much abuse a person can tolerate and Jon may decide to walk 8 kids or not. All in all this is a lovely show about a couple trying to raise 8 young ones. It is one of my favorite programs.",1216684800,12,894,4.359281437125748
3465011,3,B001AR0D3Q,I love these kids and generally enjoy the show a lot. Wish the producer would show more of the Tups and less of Jon and Kate. What some folk don't understand is that the show is Jon and Kate's job.,1216512000,10,197,3.95
3465012,5,B001AR0D3Q,"I am so thrilled that Jon and Kate Plus 8 are now available on dvd! Jon and Kate Gosselin have the most beautiful twins and sextuplets I have ever seen, and this family has enough love to fill up the entire state of Pennsylvania. Watching Jon and Kate raise a family of 8 children (six 3 year olds and twin 7 year olds) takes an enormous amount of energy, patience, time, intelligence, kindness, cleanliness, understanding and of course all topped with an endless supply of love! The children all have  their own personalities, as Jon and Kate unbelievably find the time to nurture their individual identities.

America has always loved family shows since the 1950's, like real life family Ozzie and Harriet, and the Gosselins are no exception. America loves the Gosselins, as they so generously allow us to view parts of their lives each week. The difference between Jon and Kate plus 8 and all the other great family shows through the decades, is Jon and Kate Plus 8 is not scripted, the Gosselin family is real. There is no script, they are totally human with human flaws as all of us have. This only makes the show all the more loved by America, because the real love shows through, it is not fake or scripted. You can see these precious children are thriving each week, with such GENUINE love! I am just so happy that Jon and Kate have so generously allowed America to let us take a peek into their lives of these beautiful twin girls and their sextuplets of 3 girls and 3 boys. It's a rare treat to see twins and sextuplets up close and especially these incredibly endearing children!

There are a few people who have made very judgemental criticisms of the Gosselin family. For those of you, who have the nerve to criticize people you don't personally know, I have some very old, very wise advice for you. Let he/she who is without sin, cast the first stone. For all of you stone throwers, this may come as a shock to you, but you are not sinless, nor will you ever be perfect, so keep your stones to yourself.",1215388800,5,2017,4.505464480874317
3465013,4,B001AR0D3Q,"I discovered the Jon & Kate Plus 8 show after they were featured on Oprah in February, 2008.  I quickly became addicted to watching it, and I would venture to say that most people who watch it have opinions about Jon, Kate and their kids.  Another reviewer, 'Americanlife-American Dreams,' did an excellent job of describing the episodes in a nutshell.  I have no idea how I would cope with the stress, financial burden, chaos, and confusion if I had twins and sextuplets.  That being said, I'd like to offer my list of 'Best of' and 'Worst of' moments of the show:

Biggest Kate Meltdown: At Disneyworld, when the kids all got ice cream (in what was probably 80-90 degree heat) which started melting down (the ice cream didn't 'melt down' as fast as Kate did!) their clothes, Kate had a fit, took all the ice creams from the kids and told the kids they could have some if it were fed to them.  I love what Jon said later in the interview chair, 'I would have just let them have it, let the ice cream get all over them!'

Second Biggest Kate Meltdown: On their skiing trip to Utah, Kate starts crying because their plane is diverted to Idaho because of bad weather.

Most Embarrassing Moment: When they are Christmas shopping with all the kids, and Kate berates Jon twice for being in the wrong place, saying he was, 'Playing with toys instead of doing his job.'

Best 'Way To Go, Jon' Moment: When Jon is loading up the van after the Christmas shopping trip, and he tells Kate how she made him feel in the store, he said, 'I felt like a fr**ken dog.'  And later, during their interview, she did not even apologize, all she said was that 'I don't notice anyone when I'm in a store.'

Sweetest Moment:  Leah and Joel, and Hannah and Collin holding hands in the dentist's chair during their first dentist appointment.

Weirdest Moment:  Excited Kate taking a picture of one of the sextuplets (Leah or Alexis) with her first 'deposit' in the potty!

Biggest 'Oops' Moment:  Kate gets badly sunburned on the surprise Florida vacation she planned for Jon's 30th Birthday present because she doesn't like the greasiness of sunblock!

Fastest Recovery From Altitude Sickness:  The first morning in Utah, after Kate had been vomiting all night, and wasn't able to help Jon dress the kids that morning, it seems as if she and Beth went to the spa that same day, and Kate seemed just fine!  (Just to give the benefit of a doubt, it could have been film editing that made it seem that the spa visit was the very same day as her being sick, I don't know for sure)

Meanest Mom Moment:  Kate not allowing the kids to use markers when they went to the Crayola Factory.  Kate says, 'They wear nice outfits when we go out, and if you have one kid getting marker stains on their clothes, it's not a big deal, but when you have 8, that's a whole day I get to spend in the laundry room, getting stains out.'

Bravest Moment:  Kate showing the world her pre-tummy tuck 'jowls of the
dog, butt in the front' belly!

Biggest Germ-O-Phobe Moment:  On the way to Disneyworld, when they stayed in a motel along the way, and Kate would not let the kids walk on the carpet without shoes!

Biggest Question:  Although Jon has somewhat explained the absence of his parents in their life, (his dad is deceased and his mom has remarried, has a job, etc.)  Kate's explanation of the absence of her parents in their life brings up more questions.  Kate has said that the kids' grandparents are 'not a part of their everyday life, but they have others like, Nana Janet, who love their 8 kids.'

Kate's Favorite Word: To Jon, to get his attention, 'HELL--LOW!!'

I have to give Kate credit for doing the best she can with her job of being the stay at home mom of 8 kids, I give Jon credit for putting up with Kate, I give Aunt Jody credit for doing her best to help Kate, even though Aunt Jody has 4 kids herself.  I think Kate's true nature can be seen at times when she laughs while she and Jon are in the interview chair, or when she and Jon are taking one of the kids out on that kid's special day.  I also wish that Jon and Kate didn't play up to or talk to the camera so often, just let the events unfold naturally instead of commenting about it at the time, they can do that later in the interview chair.
All in all, I love watching the show, although Dr. Laura says once the cameras are in your home, it's no longer reality...",1215216000,35,4399,4.383477188655981
3465014,5,B001AR0D3Q,"I love this show -- it's absolutely addicting. I watched the original special ""Surviving Sextuplets and Twins"" on the Discovery Health Channel and I can't believe it's been 3 years since we met the Gosselin's!  The family as a whole is just adorable, and it's been wonderful to watch the twins and sextuplets all grow up. Jon and Kate really encourage and notice the individuality in all of their children and it's really amazing to see all of their personalities and how different they all are.

I am so glad this is coming to DVD, I watch it on TLC every week, and I hope there are more DVD sets to come and the show continues! And I know that Jon and Kate try to read all of their e-mails, so if you guys are reading these reviews and see this one, keep up the good work!",1215043200,9,774,4.258503401360544
3465015,5,B001AR0D3Q,"Typically, I'm not very big on reality shows. Most of them are kinda [...], and over dramatized to designate specific stereotypes that the producers want to attract fans (The Hills, for example). However, Jon and Kate + 8 is original in the shows presentation that its a ""what you see is what you get"" type of production.

I first found out about this show from a coworker, who was telling me about this amazing family with Sextuplets and Twins. It definitely peeked my curiousity - I mean, after hearing that statement, could you not help but think ""God Bless that family!"". I think one child would be a challenge for me, I couldn't imagine having eight! So I checked my local listing and found that the show aired on TLC and set my DVR to record a mini-marathon (as they often have them on the weekends, in my area at least).

After watching the first couple of episodes, I was seriously amazed at how Kate and Jon handled everything. I also think that it was very brave of them to share their story with the world, as I know many people such as myself must be curious to see what goes on in the life of having two sets of multiples. Kate's super-organization (she so reminds me of myself!) and Jon's laid back attitude balance each other out perfectly.

Their children, Cara, Mady, Alexis, Leah, Hannah, Joel, Aidan, and Collin are too adorable! They each have their own little personalities so different from the next. I think it's so adorable how Hannah is mommy's ""mini me"" in that she wants to help with the housework all the time! She reminds me of my pseudo niece (not really related, but I'm an aunt to her), who has to do everything with you at all times, even cleaning and folding laundry. Aidan loves animals, and I agree with his parents that I could see him being a zoologist or a veterinarian when he grows up. And every time I see an Allegator now, I think of the Gosselin's daughter, Alexis and think ""that's an Al-der-gater"" as she calls them. I could go on about how adorable these kids are, but just see for yourself - watch the show/buy the dvds - you won't be let down :)

For those of you who do not know, Jon and Kate have an official [...]  there you can view their scheduled appearances, as Jon and Kate often visit churches and communities around the world to share their story. I truly hope that someday I can attend one of these sessions, but being that I'm a college student starting Pharmacy School, unless they come near North Carolina, the chances of actually attending one for me is quite small.

Also, to all the fellow fans of the show, please buy this DVD set. You know the family gets proceeds from their book/DVD sales, that money can help them do things like fund their children's education. Contrary to popular belief, they are not ""super rich"", and sending 8 children through college is a huge expense (I know my tuition is $[...] a year for six years [Pharmacy School] --- that's $[...] in Tuition alone ---now multiply that times eight!). And by the time these kids get to college, you know that tuition will be significantly higher. I will be ordering my copy to have it shipped as soon as it comes out, anything to help this awesome family!",1214697600,5,3187,4.4862068965517246
3465016,5,B001AR0D3Q,This show is inspirational and a pleasure to watch.  It brightens my day to come home and know that I can enjoy a show that will make me laugh and apperciate my life.  Thank you for sharing your lives with the rest of the world.,1213488000,22,228,4.044444444444444
3465037,3,B001AR0D3Q,"Well, for the price I paid, I can't complain. The disc seem like cheap re-prints, but not surprised since the show isn't too pupular anymore. My main concern is the one of the discs was loose in the case, however seems to be undamaged. Also, the discs look exactly the same with no way to distinguish between seasons. Since there are only two discs, it's not that hard to figure out. Just a minor annoyance since I happened to put in season 2 first. I will probably mark 1 and 2 on them for future reference.",1416441600,2,508,4.302083333333333

3465056,3,B001AR0D3Q,"so I have watched this show since day one.  I know that this DVD is missing more than 3 episodes.  It is missing the two from the Disney vacation.  That was one of the better shows, especially for a person who loves disney.  There are a lot of tv shows that are taped in disney land or disney world and those episodes are on the DVD's now, so why aren't they on jon and kate plus 8I also wish they would have had both shows of surviving sextuplets and twins (orrignial and revisited).",1238544000,,484,4.172043010752688

3465058,5,B001AR0D3Q,"If you like shows with little kids in them like my daughter, then this is a great video.  The only really annoying thing is before every episode you have to watch the same intro where everyone is introduced instead of just being able to go to that show.  This has kept my daughter who is 10 busy during an illness and on long car rides.  I personally find the parents really annoying but as long as you focus on the kids it is fine to watch.",1236038400,,441,4.104651162790698

3465063,4,B001AR0D3Q,"If you don't know the show, Jon & Kate had fertility problems and after treatment, produced twin girls. They wanted one more but had sextuplets!  This makes for a wild life, which the cameras record.  These DVDs don't have any extras, really, just the episodes, but it's a bargain price-wise.  If you like the show, you will like this.

As for the show, I consider Kate a control freak.  Having 8 kids gives her an excuse to be bossy. She is actually OK with the kids, but in these episodes, she talks to Jon like he works for her, and she doesn't think too highly of his abilities.  This is a problem because she wants everything to be perfect, and when it's not she takes it out on him. I'm sure all of us had had cringe moments when married couples are critical of each other in public.  Imagine that with cameras rolling!

In these episodes he actually seems to roll with it, but if you follow the tabloids, you know that the strain of 8 kids and cameras intruding has pretty much wrecked their marriage, which is sad for all concerned.

These episodes record happier times.  I hope the kids watch them when they're all grown up.",1233792000,2,1133,4.403846153846154

3465077,1,B001AR0D3Q,"All I can say is these parents are exploiting their kids, that should be some sort of child protection agency in on this.  They may not be abusing the kids, but by filming their every move and letting them support them finacially, is exploiting them.  I think the writing is on the wall, Maddie is already acting out and the rest will follow...the kids will figure out they are being exploited and start resenting it.... This book and everything else the parents do, is to add wealth to their lives so they can get more material possessions at the expense of their childrens right to privacy.  I think Kate is way to concerned with keeping the kids clean and 'camera ready' at all times.  It's not natural and I really feel sorry for the kids.  They may have more than most kids, but they have to earn the money for the family....the parents don't work...Kate acts like an obnoxious Queen Bee, not like a loving wife or mother....",1226361600,15,930,4.511904761904762
3465078,4,B001AR0D3Q,"I had read the other reviews here on Amazon and was concerned to read that some people thought the DVD set was incomplete. I ended up buying it anyway, since this was the only DVD set my local store had and I kind of needed it immediately. I've since watched it, written down the episode list, and compared it to the complete episode list available at IMDB. I thought I would put the information up here for other people considering this product, so they'll know exactly what's on this DVD and what's missing. So here's the list of the episodes which ARE on this DVD set!

Disc One:
- 10 Little Pumpkins
- Twins Turn 6
- Gosselins Go West
- Shopping for Ten
- Garage Makeover
- Housekeeper Hunt
- Pancakes & Potties
- Jon Turns 30
- Sextuplets Turn 3!
- Breakfast in Bed

Disc Two:
- Gosselins Go Dutch
- Sextuplets' First Dentist Visit
- Red, White, & Gosselin
- Sugar Rush
- A Cow Purchase
- Sara Snow Visits!
- Babies & Bedrooms Part One
- Babies & Bedrooms Part Two
- BONUS: Surviving Sextuplets & Twins One-Hour Special

Just so you know, season one is complete, but season two is missing a total of three episodes. And strangely, some of these episodes are presented out of order, which seems odd. But anyway, just so you know, here are the episodes that are missing from this DVD set.

The Missing Episodes Are:
- A Day At The Zoo (Season 2, Episode 10)
- Hit The Road (Season 2, Episode 11)
- How It All Began (Season 2, Episode 12)

I don't know yet if those three episodes are available on the individual season sets, because I haven't purchased those yet. But I like to know what I'm getting when I buy something, so at least now you'll know what's on this DVD set and what isn't. Personally, I still think it's a pretty good deal for what it is. However, I've removed one star from the rating simply because, in my opinion, the packaging should state clearly what's contained in the DVD set. I think it's disappointing that it doesn't explain that more clearly, so bad job, TLC! Other than that, though, the video quality is at least good, even if the DVD menus aren't anything particularly special.

That said, the show is *fantastic*! I couldn't recommend it more highly. It's so endlessly refreshing to see a family on TV that really honestly love each other and always strives to do what's right. Sure, they aren't perfect, but who is?
The show never fails to make me smile, it's so fun to watch the darling little kids, and it's honestly just a whole lot of happiness crammed into half-hour segments. It's great for families, adults, kids, whoever! Give this show a chance and I know you'll end up loving the Gosselins as much as I do!
Bottom line, 'Jon & Kate Plus 8' deserves five stars, but TLC deserves only 3 for not being clearer about the packaging. But hey, at least now you know!",1225238400,105,2805,4.394990366088632

This is a wonderfully, enjoyable DVD about everyday life about a real-life family with twins and sextuplets. The kids are adorably cute and Kate (the mom) is so organized, she makes handling eight kids seem like a ""cake walk."" Her husband, Jon, is a fun ""side-kick"", and a great hands-on dad. Not only will you watch everyday life at the Gosselin home, you also get to travel with them to interesting and fun places (Disney World, Oprah, pumpkin patch, Gymboree, etc.). These places may not be on this DVD, but these are some of the places the Gosselins have visited and filmed for their TV program on TLC.",1223683200,3,792,5.6
3465080,4,B001AR0D3Q,I suggest this version of seasons 1 and 2 because it is only two discs and much cheaper.,1223251200,2,88,3.9444444444444446
3465081,5,B001AR0D3Q,"I love watching these DVD's.  What a terrific family.  A lot of tough, trying times - I don't know how they do it.  I guess the hugs that they get from the kids make all the struggle worth it.  When little Joel told mommy, Kate, that he liked the way her face smelled, I think it really touched her heart!  I also like the episode when Jon takes the boys out for the day to the golf course (this episode is NOT on these DVD's however, I think it's on a later season).  Sometimes I fall asleep with these DVD's playing.",1223164800,3,518,4.079207920792079

3465083,5,B001AR0D3Q,I enjoyed watching it. I learned some on how to organize. It amazes me how she can stay so organized and on top of things(Majority of the time)with that many kids. Watching it showed me not to complain having two and that I really have it easy. Glad it came out on DVD.Can't wait for season 3 to come out.,1222992000,3,305,4.1
3465084,3,B001AR0D3Q,"I am a HUGE fan of the show Jon & Kate Plus 8 which is on TLC.  I watch it every week and any time it's on or they have reruns.  I was super excited to buy the seasons 1 & 2 on DVD but I couldn't find it in stores.  I bought it here on Amazon and I immediately watched it and there's sooo much information missing and episodes missing.  I don't understand why they didn't put more on it.
It's still a great show, but I feel like there's half missing from the very beginning.  It was very disappointing to feel this way...",1222646400,26,521,3.9238095238095236
3465085,5,B001AR0D3Q,"I DO NOT like reality shows, but this show has me mesmerized. When I can finally sit down for the day, the first thing I do is check TLC to see if this program is on. Thus, the reason I finally bought it on DVD. I can't imagine what it's like to raise 8 small children, 24 hours a day, then alone with cameras in my face watching my every move and hearing my every word. The children are well behaved (or as well behaved as children can be), Jon and Kate's personalities compliment each other, (she's extremely organized and he takes life as it comes along) and I thoroughly enjoy this program. When Season 3 is released in November, I'll be buying that as well.",1221609600,8,662,4.261904761904762
3465086,5,B001AR0D3Q,"This is a wonderful show my kids 3 & 7 and I love it.  It's just good clean fun in a world of television shows that are full of foul language and questionable morals this is something we can enjoy as a family.  I really hate the Kate bashing, I think she is a great mom and I challenge anybody to go through a day in her life without losing it completely.",1221523200,7,355,3.9166666666666665
3465087,5,B001AR0D3Q,"This show is great for the entire family, and is highly recommended for moms and dads who are facing a great deal of stress.  If Jon and Kate can do it with eight kids, so can everyone!  The show portrays the challenges and triumphs of this awesome family, and is an inspiration for everyone.  The stress, as well as the love, is obvious, and the kids are gorgeous.",1221523200,2,365,4.338235294117647

3465089,3,B001AR0D3Q,"I love this show, but I never got to see the ""Hit the Road"" episode where they go to Disneyworld. I got this DVD set because according to many websites, including imdb.com, that episode is supposed to be included in season 2. However, once I put the DVDs in the player, I couldn't find that episode on the menu! Even though I like watching this show, I bought it mostly to see that one episode (because it's rarely on TV and it's the one episode I have missed). I'm very disappointed. I thought the DVD set was supposed to include ALL of the episodes from seasons 1 & 2.",1221004800,23,570,4.238532110091743
3465090,4,B001AR0D3Q,I absolutely love this show. I have watched every episode since it begain with the special. My 5 year old and 3 year old daughters love it too. We watch it every week. I completely understand Kate with all her little things people complain about. I would be the same way if not worse. I only have 3 kids and my house is just a crazy. She is an amazing mom to those beautiful children. I just wish that every single episode would be on the dvd's. My kids would be in heaven to watch them whenever they wanted. And some of my favorite episodes were when the younger kids were still young. I recommend this show to anybody who like family programming.,1220313600,5,648,4.276422764227642
3465091,5,B001AR0D3Q,"I discovered this show while trapped in a Motel 6 in Iowa City prior to the worst Graduate School interview I've had in my entire life.

TLC was running a marathon (which they often did and do, and I'm thrilled with the habit) and I tuned in because there wasn't really anything else on... and I was charmed.  So very, very charmed.

I don't like reality shows.  That's not a hardline rule, but I'm deeply pressed to think of a single 'reality show' that I'll watch more than an episode or ten minutes of.  I sat through four hours of this show, straight out the door, and look forward to new episodes.  Why?  Because of this show's sweetness.  Moreover, of how it isn't glammed up or white-washed or scripted.  It's, basically, a bunch of home videos of eight wonderful children and the two parents that are doing their best to make it work.

Honestly, the kids are adorable and funny and loud and just plain kids.  They have melt downs and get dirty and silly and have moments that make me want to cry with the aching sweetness.  This is their childhood laid out for people to watch and enjoy, but it's also so, so honest.  None of the kids (or the parents) are perfect.  They each deal with stressful situations the best they can, but at the end of the day - like the opening says - there's love and care and I think there are a lot of families who could learn a lesson from that.",1218672000,25,1383,4.310077519379845
3465092,5,B001AR0D3Q,"I really enjoy this show. I think it's very funny at times. I don't really like the way Kate treats her husband Jon. But I do think there household can be very stressful, and sometimes you don't mean to say things the way they come out. If you think you have a handful with your family of 2 or 3 kids you need to watch this show, and maybe you will rethink your opinion about your own household.",1217894400,6,395,4.076923076923077
3465093,5,B001AR0D3Q,"This is an enjoyable program.  A loving family who aims to put God and each other first in their lives throughout the difficulties of raising eight very young children.
I think that because the Gosselin family is in such a unique position, everyone (including parents) should be careful before they judge, until they've walked a mile in their shoes.",1217808000,4,349,4.915254237288136
3465094,5,B001AR0D3Q,"This show is great.  It does show the reality of dealing with life with kids, albeit more kids than any of us know. Yes Kate can be demaning, however when you are dealing with that many kids and keeping a household running things get pretty hectic.  Organization is a must!  Kate does a great job of it.

Here's my problem with people who like to slam this show and Kate:

first do they EVER get frusterated with their significant other?  Aparently not because they are just above it.  I only have one child and boy can things frusterate me.  Maybe they have time to pull aside their significant other and talk it out, but when you have eight kids pulling at your attention it would be difficult.  Bottom line, I nor the majority of people out there know what it is like to be in their situation.  So to take a lesson from my Mother...Never judge a man until you have walked in his or her shoes.

Secondly so they are getting freebies.  Does it really necessitate them taking everything they get?  Here's the thing that some people OBVIOUSLY don't take into consideration.  The volume of freebies. I nor anyone else probably gets the amount of freebies they get.  Wouldn't you take the pick of the litter?  I would and I am not ashamed to admit it.  ALSO Their name is going to be attached to the product, like the bibs the kids wear, Dura Bib.  I certainly would not want my name attached to something that is substandard or second rate.  But I guess people do not think that way.

Lastly on Kate not letting the kids do certain things.  I've read people slamming her for not letting the kids use markers at the Crayola factory.  Here's my response, did no one see how fast Aaden put the play doh in his mouth?  Kate has her reasons for doing what she does, but so does every mother out there. I'm sure that every mother out there has let her kid do exactly what he or she wanted at all times. Right?!?!?! Not on your life.  and if they are that explains the state of things.

To summerize, I can not believe the amount of people negativly judging this family for being who they are.  And for all the perfect mommies out there that do everything right at just the right time, please stand up because just maybe they should make a show about you and then watch everyone slam you.",1216857600,28,2279,4.353919239904988

I only took photos on our trip and no home movies, so I sometimes watch those episodes with my preschoolers to remember our trip. Lots of other fun shows, too. As a mom, I'm inspired by Kate G's organization and creativity, but also can't help but learn from the disrespect she showed her husband. In some ways, I'm impressed she even got everyone dressed and fed every day. I've never been the mother of 8 young children, so I can't say I'd do it any better if I were in her shoes.",1443830400,,608,4.486486486486487
