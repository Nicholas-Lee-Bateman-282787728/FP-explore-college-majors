7927553,2,B00004YS7T,"Hilary Stagg has written some of the most hauntingly beautiful and passionate music. But those songs are not represented here for the most part.  Besides the exorbitant cost of this visual DVD the song selection is not good in my opinion.  And I have all of Mr. Stagg's albums!  Would not suggest that you spend your money on this DVD, but do get all the other Hilary Stagg albums.  You will not be disappointed.",1390262400,,412,4.527027027027027
7927554,3,B00004YS7T,"Not what I expected. Not wide screen. Pretty, but not what I was looking for. I expected a couple of hours of soft music and fantastic film of ocean places and creatures. Instead it was about an hour of narration of ocean life, with beautiful ocean creatures.",1382832000,,259,4.531914893617022
7927555,4,B00004YS7T,It's a nice DVD for divers and all friends of the underwater world. There is no word - only very soft meditative wonderful music. Only the quality of the filmed scenes is not the level as for example IMAX films. But nevertheless I can recomend it very much!,1045094400,13,257,4.375
7927556,5,B00004YS7T,"I've recommended you to buy it. It's worth, Picture is so beautiful.
For me I love fish dance scene,the motion is so fantastic.
Music is so romance. It'll make you relax. Maybe you can keep it for your next generation. :)",1026172800,7,221,4.414634146341464
7927557,5,B00004YS7T,"Breathtaking visuals and beautiful music combine to produce an unexpected mood altering experience.  I bought this for my children to watch because they are fascinated by undersea life and I had been told by a friend (an avid scuba diver) that this was one of the most beautifully photographed programs I could get. My children of course loved it (they are six and nine),  but what amazed me as I watched it with them was the spell it cast.  My friend was right, the picture quality was incredible - the colors, the variety of sea life and locations were all the best I've seen.  But what I wasn't prepared for was the poetic camera work combined with the lovely music and editing that brought an emotional depth to the whole experience.  There was an artfullness to this program that went well beyond anything I've seen in anything remotely associated as a ""nature"" program before.  I'd even say more then many films I've seen. While my children have enjoyed watching this DVD,  My husband, myself, our parents and friends have all been captivated by it.  I highly recommend this program.",981763200,32,1089,4.724867724867725
