6401743,2,B00K31RCKC,"Why repackage Seasons One & Two when they have yet to release the remaining seasons.  I love this show and already purchased Seasons One through Three!  Get on the stick and acquire the rights to the rest of the series before they start re-cashing in on repackaging in on older seasons!

6401756,5,B00K31RCKC,"The Nanny has long been a guilty pleasure of mine.  I think too many people missed out on this show because of ""that voice"" and didn't give the comedy a chance.  And that's their loss, because Fran Drescher has incredible comic chops.

There are no extras here - there's barely an index of episodes.  But to get nearly fifty episodes for this price is a no-brainer.  Enjoy!",1483833600,,373,4.507462686567164

The Nanny is good family fun. I like to watch it with my daughter.

I rated this at four stars because of the packaging. There are four disks inside, and they are all stuffed into the same slot, so I have to be very careful with them. There are no subtitles, but I do love the PLAY ALL option.",1438560000,,424,3.8181818181818183

6401809,5,B00K31RCKC,"This set of the first two seasons of the nanny is pretty good.  Seeing as how the original sets are not as easy to get a hold of as they once were, for the price this is a good bargain.
The quality of the transfers is very good, the sound is good and considering we've been watching these off youtube for years it's really so much better to finally have the discs.

6401815,5,B00K31RCKC,"I have to say that I enjoy the series more on DVDS than in syndication. Fran Drescher stars as Fran Fine, a wedding specialist who ends up selling make up door to door on Manhattan's East Side. Fran is hired to be the nanny to the Sheffield children.

This four disc set includes 48 episodes from the first two seasons but no extra features like a Fran Drescher biography or a reunion show.

Renee Taylor is a hoot as Fran's mother, Sylvia. Charles Shaughnessy (Days of Our Lives) plays Maxwell Sheffield, Broadway show producer who lives in the Upper East Side townhouse with his children and faithful butler, Niles (Daniel Davis). Maxwell's business partner is C.C. Babcock (played delightfully by Lauren Lane). I loved the bickering between C.C. and Niles. This sitcom has plenty of memorable moments like when the family gets stranded in a blizzard with Sylvia and Mort in their rent controlled apartment in Flushing, Queens, New York.

There are memorable guest appearances by Cloris Leachman (Nanny Mueller), Lesley Ann Downe, Lauren Koslow, Marianne Muellereille, Nancy Frangione, and others.",1424044800,,1099,5.060773480662983

2 season CD of how The Nanny all got started.  Have only
watched several episodes so far and it lives up to all the
expectations.  Right from the bat, you can tell this series is
a winner.  I'm looking forward to seeing the next 30 or 40
episodes and then starting to watch them all over again,
just as I did with the later episodes.  Fran, you're a riot!

I would go to my room, turn off the lights and just watch the show. Of course they figured out I was still awake when they heard the loud laughing from my room but when you're watching The Nanny, you're going to laugh.  I've already watched this dvd more times then I'm willing to admit and I know I'm driving my family up the wall with it but I just can't help it.
