While probably essential to Our Gang completists, even ardent fans will find this one-off 1936 feature little more than a frustrating curiosity.

Under pressure from changes in the movie-theater industry, producer Hal Roach is said to have made the film to test the viability of the Rascals in a longer format.

But then why didn't he make more of a dedicated Little Rascals movie and film the children in their element? Here, he seems to be pretty much daring them to fail by using an unproven format within another unproven format. General Spanky features just three of the core kids -- five other minor players turn up as well -- and places them within a decidedly adult-dominated scenario set in the Civil War era.

And from the earliest stages, it doesn't work. The film feels as though it was made on the cheap -- Roach adapting a pre-existing script to make room for the Rascals, rather than starting from scratch.

In any case, it's a poor fit and, unsurprisingly, the filmmaker didn't repeat the experiment with Our Gang. (He would make further feature efforts with a different set of children in the late '40s.)

Now, while this is not in the same league as even the weakest Our Gang shorts from 1936, it's not a total loss. There are charming moments -- notably from Buckwheat. Generally speaking, co-directors Fred Newmeyer (who helmed the first, rejected Our Gang short in 1919) and Gordon Douglas (who handled many in the mid and late '30s) do capture the children in the natural fashion of the short subjects.

But the film's basic premises work against them -- achingly slow to get moving, it drags throughout -- and the weight of grown-ups in particular is an unwelcome harbinger of the progressively weaker shorts of the MGM era that began in the summer of 1938.",1364256000,5,1855,4.70679012345679
7935188,2,B00005AB2L,"With the 1935 success of Shirley Temple's ""The Little Colonel,"" producer Hal Roach believed that a Civil War vehicle would make an ideal feature debut for the delightful antics of Our Gang. Unfortunately, Spanky, Buckwheat and Alfalfa take a back seat to the adult leads in this well-made but rather hackneyed melodrama. Even worse, the Gang look awkwardly out of place in a period setting  an experiment Roach never repeated. The critical and commercial failure of ""General Spanky"" (1936) proved that short subjects were Our Gang's forte.",1257552000,3,539,5.195402298850575
7935189,5,B00005AB2L,"I watched this movie with my children, age 5 and 8, and they loved it. I've never seen them react to any other movie as they did to this one. They were kicking their feet with the pain of suspense, they were squealing with delight as good triumphs over bad, they laughed their heads off at the jokes and gags, they were crying out to the characters to watch out for this bad guy and that bad guy, they felt Buckwheat's hungry stomach. If you're tired of the contemporary Disney trash and television cartoon junk, I recommend this movie. It's definitely NOT PC, it's a product of American society in 1936, but it's clearly child-friendly in my opinion. Enjoy!",1031270400,9,658,4.53781512605042
