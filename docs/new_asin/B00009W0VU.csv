1891801,3,B00009W0VU,"I thought this PPV would overall be great, I was pretty disappointed by a lot of the matches. Whatever here are my opinions.
PPV Intro - Wow WWE is always the best in making these kind of videos.
Dudley Boyz v. Batista and Flair (World Tag Titles Table Match) : You think this would be a good match considering being in PHilly, ECW land and being a tables match with such awesome talent. But it was really bad.
John Cena self-promo ft. RVD - Nice...
Rey Mysterio v. Jamie Knoble (WWE Cruiserweight title match) : I was really looking forward to this match but it was a waste of 3 minutes. Plus the storyline with Nidia did not climax, it happened on the next Smackdown! which makes no sense, why didn't they just put it here?Whatever.
Eddie Guerrero v. Chavo Guerrero : Another match that I was extremely looking forward to. Slow-paced match not that good actually.
Hardcore Holly v. Brock Lesnar (WWE title) ; I still have trouble believing that Sparkplug Bob Holly was maineventing Smackdown! for more than a month. Anyways I thought the storyline itself was pretty good. But the match was another waste. Sudden F-5, over, crowd pretty pleased with that too actually.
HBk v. HHH (World Title Last Man Standing Match): Their match on DEcember,30th,2003 in San Antonio was so much better, this was bloody and had its moments but also not that good. People disliked the finish but it made sense for the characters roles.
Goldberg meets Lesnar Backstage II
Eric Bischoff say hello to Paul Heyman: I loved this segment.
the 2004 Royal Rumble: incredibly predictable but I still loved every moment of it. Amazing sixty minutes.",1077494400,,1623,4.71830985915493

The only good match on the card. HHH and HBK put on a great show.
6th Match: Royal Rumble Match *************************
Very good and lots of surprises: undertaker's gong, return of Mick Foley, Billy gunn's return.
Must buy DVD. The only flaw about this PPV was that the 30 superstars were announced. It would be better if they left it to be a surprise. I am also judging the arena. The arena for Royal Rumble was not that creative but cool in a way. Overall but this DVD.",1077321600,,864,4.884353741496598
1891803,4,B00009W0VU,"Let me begin by saying that this review isn't based on the Pay per View that the WWE showed on TV.  This review comes to you from section 7, Row 3, Seat 8.  Two seats behind the chair reserved for Mic Foley.  Tazz got some serious ECW chants all night.  Ratings are out of 5.
Dudley Boys vs. Evolution  **
The match iself wasn't bad, but how much longer do we need to see Ric Flair in the ring?  Batista is just a monster who is waiting to reach his potential.  And the Dudley Boys are the Dudley Boys.  Coach interfeared and the Dudley wailed on him accordingly.  Any time the Coach gets beat up it's not a bad thing, it's a good thing.  (it's me, it's me, it's D D P.)
Noble vs. Mysterio  ** 1/2
These two can do so much better.  In fact, they have done so much better.  And I'll admit, I'm a little biased because the only cruiserweight worth watching jumped to Raw.  That's right, Veeeee ooonnnnnnneeeeeeeaaaaaaah.  MF'er number 3 right here.
Eddie vs Chavo  ***
The only thing this match was lacking was that stupid horse that Chavo used to bring to the ring with him.  This story line of Chavo against Eddie has been done.  Hopefully this will be the end of it.
Brock vs Hardcore  *** 1/2
Does Brock really work as a chicken?  I didn't think so either.  The match itself was a little slow, with to much use of the Brock Lock.  Really now, half the match consisted of one long body scissors.  Holly hit the Alabama slam, but decided not to get the win.
Michaels vs HHH *****
Two of the greatest of all time in a match that will easily be considered one of the years best.  I'm never a fan of the double countout, but both men put on incredible performances.  Lots of blood, and some sweet chin music later, and that's all she wrote.  Buy this DVD for this match alone.
Heyman and Biscoff get stunned by Stone COld *****
'Nuff said.
Royal Rumble *****
The match itself was good.  I'll admit, I was one of the marks that went insane when the lights went out and that music started.  I was glad to see Benoit win so that he could get the chance to win the championship.  The ending was a little slow.  Angle got dragged out by his own Angle Lock, and Benoit was able to pull the Big Show out.  Big Show put on a great performance, any anytime that Goldberg doesn't win is good.  And the ECW chants for R V D were a nice touch.  Those of us who remember life before the WWE was the only show in town know all about ""The whole F'n show.""
On a personnal note, at Denny's afterwards, we ran into some of the wrestlers.  I'll say it now, in print, Chavo is a waste of oxygen.  But John Cena was the coolest person you could ever want to meet.  He signed my chair.  Matt Morgan is just plain intimidating.  Hardcore Holly was pretty cool, but he is as angry in person as he appears in the ring.  Billy Gunn and Kurt Angle were cool as well.
Buy the DVD",1077148800,9,2848,4.155963302752293
1891804,2,B00009W0VU,"Royal Rumble came to you live from the Wachovia Centre in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
1st Match: World Tag Team Championship Tables Match:
This match was the worst of the card. It seemed like they were to puffed to do anything. Then Coach came down unfortunately getting the Dudleys distracted putting D-Von through the table by Batista at around 3 minutes
2nd Match: WWE Cruiserweight Championship Match:
This match was also bad. This is like the worst match of Rey and Noble's career. Like the other one it seemed they were just standing around. Ended when Nidia tripped Noble for Rey to hit the 619 at 6 minutes
3rd Match: Eddie vs. Chavo Guerrero Jnr with Chavo Guerrero Snr
This match was also bad. It was very boring lots of submission holds, which bores you. Ended when Eddie frogsplashed Chavo for the pin at 13 minutes. He then went spastic.
4th Match: WWE Championship Match:
Basically it was just Holly chasing Brock around the ring. When suddenly they decided to get in the ring, right away F-5 1-2-3! at 6 minutes. Very quick and boring match.
5th Match: World Heavyweight Championship Last Man Standing Match:
The only good match on the card. It was awesome. It was phenonemal. It was fantastic. It rocked my world. Though the ending sucked as HBK hit the Sweet Chin Music then fell back down for the double 10 count. Does HBK ever leave an arena without swimming in blood.
6th Match: Royal Rumble Match:
This match wasn't bad. It was better than last year. Ending was quite boring as Big Show and Chris Benoit were just fighting for 5 minutes then Chris Benoit tossed Big  Show over for the win.
Comment: Sucked I repeat sucked. Do not buy this DVD it sucked. But if you really want to get it get it on video that way it's sort've worth the money.",1077062400,,1762,4.593650793650793
1891805,5,B00009W0VU,"one word WOW the royal Rumble 2004 plants the seeds of an awesome wrestlemania!
Like Brock vs. Goldberg and the undertaker's return to his dead man persona!
Witness as Chris BEnoit do a Shawn Michaels
watch as the two General Managers of RAW and SmackDown! getting on in the ring but the main reason in buying the Royal Rumble is the breathtaking Last man standing match between Triple H and former best buddy shawn michaels. The Rumble match was ok but the superstars were eliminated to quickly.
If you were me I'd buy this on DVD but since DVD is not yet out, this video will suffice - BOO YA!",1076803200,,595,4.418181818181818
1891806,5,B00009W0VU,"Insurrextion results
- Jazz beat Trish to retain the Women's title after outside interference from Victoria and Teddy Long, who shoved Trish shoulder first into the ring post.
- Christian beat Booker T to retain the IC title by pinning with his feet on the ropes. Booker did a spinaroonie and had the upper hand after a very slow start.
- Austin backstage with Theodore Long. To cut it short, Austin puts Long in
a six man with Nowinski and Mack against the three Dudleyz.
- RVD and Kane beat La Resistance
- Al Snow interviewed Goldust to hype the Goldust/Rico match
- Goldust beat Rico with a powerslam. Boring filler match.
- Freddie Blassie tribute video aired. Plenty of loud ""FREDDIE"" chants from the Newcastle crowd, respecting a guy who most of them probably haven't seen wrestle. JR and King applauded the crowd (on screen too, apparently) after the video.
- Highlight Reel - Jericho comes out to a good pop, but that turns to heel heat after he put down the cheap set for his show, and Newcastle's failed Capital of Culture for 2008 bid (that title went to Liverpool). He also made a few cheap remarks at the expense of local football/soccer team Newcastle United and it's manager Bobby Robson (which I liked, since I support Sunderland - but that's by the by). Eric Bischoff comes out, and the pair continue a verbal barrage on Newcastle. Glass shatters, Austin comes out to a monster pop. Talks about how much beer he drank... then says he made the main event (Nash/HHH) a street fight. Jericho said a killer long line to the crowd (""if you want me to have a beer say..."") and the three had a beer bath. Austin stunnered Jericho, before teasing a Stunner to Bischoff, before hitting it on his co-GM.
- Dudley Boyz beat Rodney Mack, Theodore Long and Chris Nowinski
- Scott Steiner beat Test with his Flatliner-like finisher
- HBK (massive pop), Nash (none at first, then polite applause), and HHH (good pop) got their separate intros to the main event. HHH beat Nash in the street fight after a sledgehammer to the head, when Nash was distracted by Flair. Flair and HBK were sent to the back early on, but not before Flair started juicing. Flair returned late in the match with practically red hair from the blood loss. Usual shenanigans as Flair helped HHH, then HBK made the save before being laid out. The crowd started to leave after HHH's entrance, by the way.",1057190400,5,2377,4.6084905660377355
1891807,5,B00009W0VU,"I was at Insurrextion in my home town and it was definitely one of the much better UK PPV efforts. Compare this event to Badd Blood shown a week later in the USA and this is a much more enjoyable PPV in my opinion. For example the RVD/Kane Vs. La Resistance bout is much more enjoyable here, as is Booker T Vs. Christian, the Dudley Boys Vs. Rodney Mack/Chris Nowinski w Teddy Long. All of the matches gain from having clean finishes, unlike Badd Blood. The only match which was better at Badd Blood was Nash Vs HHH but that was to be expected. The main highlight of the PPV was the Austin segement on Chris Jericho's highlight reel, the crowd was so loud in the arena you could hardly make out what was being said, great stuff!. A touching moment was the video tribute to Freddie Blassie (which hopefully will make it to the DVD) which earned a standing ovation and loud ""Freddie"" chants, clearly moving announcer Jim Ross. I would highly recommend anyone buying this DVD, which will hopefully come with some extra's.
Full Card: Trish Vs. Jazz, Booker T Vs. Christian, Kane/RVD Vs. La Resistance, Goldust Vs. Rico, Chris Jericho's highlight reel with Bischoff/Austin, The Dudley's Vs.

1891809,5,B00009W0VU,"1. Dudley Boyz vs. Ric Flair & Batista tables match for world tag team titles: This match was a solid opener. It sucked that it was not elimination, but still a solid tables match.
2. Rey Mysterio vs. Jamie Noble Cruiserweight title: This match was another good cruiserweight match. This was before Rey Mysterio was considered a top superstar. This match was perfect for the middle of the card like most cruiserweight matches are.
3. Eddie Guerrero vs. Chavo Guerrero: This match had a good backround to it which made the match better. Even the thou its easy to tell who would win and dominate in this match.
4. Brock Lesnar vs. Hardcore Holly WWE title: This match had a good backround, but it sould have been saved for smackdown. This match was bad in the wrestling format.
5. HHH vs. HBK Last Man Standing Match For World Heavyweight title: Man! This match put all the other matches to shame excluding the royal rumble. This match had so much blood, weapon shots, and it was the perfect length. The only bad part was the ending, but I will let you watch it to find out.
6. 30 Man Royal Rumble Match: This match arguably is the best royal rumble match. The match was over an hour long and I love the ending to it. I Have a lot of respect for the winners wrestling career but that's just my opinion.

Overall: I give this ppv 5 stars for the two main event matches plus the other matches are good as well. This dvd also includes a lot of extras plus HBK and HHH heading to the trainers room. Lastly this royal rumble might have been the best overall ppv I've seen (seen 03 through 13). Please tell whether this review was helpful or not.",1371513600,,1638,4.3881578947368425

Rey Mysterio vs. Jamie Noble was weird with Nidia but an ok match (3/5). Eddie Guerrero vs. Chavo Guerrero Jr. w/ Chavo Guerrero Sr. was a really great family rivalry (5/5). Brock Lesnar vs. Hardcore Holly was an ok match, but not the best mid-card (3/5). Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels I have to say was better then the Rumble this year, great match and physicallity from both men, and a surprise ending, LOVED IT! (5/5)! And lastly Rumble a great match yet again like always. (5/5).",1322179200,,623,4.571428571428571
1891813,4,B00009W0VU,"Dudley Boyz VS Ric Flair and Batista: This match was rather short. Dudley's looked good but Coach distracts Dudley Boys and Batista chokeslams D-Von thru a table for the win.

Jamie Noble VS Rey Mysterio: Anther very short match with Mysterio winning.

Eddie Guerrero VS Chavo Guerrero: I enjoy Eddie but this match really did nothing for me.

Brock Lesnar VS Hardcore Holly: Most of this match consisted of Lesnar trapping Holly in a body scissor. Holly did look good when he wasn't looked in the move and he actually hit his finisher move. Holly went for a full nelson and kept that on for two minutes even going to the outside with it. Then Lesnar hits an f-5 out of nowhere and its over. When it wasn't a submission move, the match looked good but they only wrestled for three minutes or less.

Shawn Michaels VS Triple H in A Last Man Standing Match: A great match even though there was no winner. A must watch match.

Eric Bischoff and Paul Haymen start to fight in the ring until Steve Austin hits the scene on a four wheeler and stuns both men.

Royal Rumble: A very good Rumble with some great moments. Benoit wins in the end to go to WrestleMania.

Overall, this was a good Rumble. While the first three matches were kept short, it was by no means bad. Holly-Lesnar went quick but had to submission holds applied for way to long. HBK-Triple H was awesome and the Rumble was good overall. A must see PPV.",1259366400,,1413,4.4324324324324325
1891814,4,B00009W0VU,"Tables World Tag Team Championship Match: Evolution (Ric Flair and Batista) (Champions) vs. The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray and D-Von)
The match started off with some nice brawling, and Flair took a pretty sick back body drop on the outside of the ring. The Coach was doing guest commentary with J.R. and The King for this one because the Dudley Boyz damaged his ribs when they hit him with a 3D through a table on Raw. Anyway, the action was pretty straight-forward from there, with Bubba sliding a table across the ring to effectively baseball slide Batista! Batista wouldn't let the Dudley Boyz suplex Flair through the table by almost tossing the table out of the ring, and at one point, Bubba took some mean chops on the table as it was leaned in a corner. Batista received a variation of the 3D where it was a neckbreaker instead of a ""cutter"" like it usually is, and then Coach ran into the ring. D-Von and Bubba started beating him up, and they almost performed the What's Up on him, but Flair knocked Bubba out of the ring. D-Von responded quickly with a flying clothesline that sent Flair out of the ring, but when D-Von turned around, he received a vicious Chokeslam from Batista through the table! Fast-paced and well done, which means it was an overall pretty good match. Winners: Evolution. Match Rating: 4/5

WWE Cruiserweight Championship Match: Rey Mysterio (Champion) vs. Jamie Noble (with Nidia)
This match was pretty sweet with a lot of fast-paced cruiserweight action. Jamie Noble can really wrestle, and so can Mysterio, and it's great seeing them work together. There was a lot of high-flying luchador-style offense from Mysterio that was extremely impressive, and there wasn't a single boring part of the match. The end came when the blind Nidia accidentally tripped Noble, and Mysterio hit the 619 as well as Dropped the Dime to get the victory. Another exciting match to continue the pay-per-view. Winner: Rey Mysterio. Match Rating: 4/5

Chavo Guerrero (with Chavo Guerrero Sr.) vs. Eddie Guerrero
This was a disappointment. Both Chavo and Eddie have had absolutely classic matches in the past, and this match really should have been much more exciting than it actually was. The first giant chunk of the match was agonizingly slow, with occasional lock-ups, chops, slaps, etc., but when it finally started to build up things got interesting. Eddie was attacked by Chavo Guerrero Sr. at a couple of points, of course, and one really sweet move came when Chavo tried to hurracarana Eddie, but Eddie took him to the ropes to try to powerbomb him to the outside only to have Chavo perform the hurracarana to send them both to the outside! The ending came way too early and fast when Eddie hit the Five-Star Frog Splash for the win. Winner: Eddie Guerrero. Match Rating: 3/5

WWE Championship Match: Brock Lesnar (Champion) vs. Hardcore Holly
I wasn't expecting much from this, but it ended up being a tad better than I expected. Lesnar actually sold for Holly and let Holly counter the F5 and beat on him for a little while outside of the ring. Back in the ring, the match became a submission fest with Lesnar locking on grapple after grapple on Holly, slowing the match down considerably. Holly hit the Alabama Slam but, stupidly, didn't go for the cover and instead locked on a full nelson that had them rolling around on the mat for a while. The fans actually got behind it though when Holly managed to wrap his legs around Lesnar's waist, and they spilled to the outside. The end came when Lesnar hit the F5 for the win. Slow, boring, but it had its moments, and it was great to see the fans actually behind Hardcore Holly. Winner: Brock Lesnar. Match Rating: 3/5

Last Man Standing World Heavyweight Championship Match: Triple H (Champion) vs. Shawn Michaels
This match should be an absolute classic, but unfortunately, it just wasn't as good as it should be. Don't get me wrong, this match has some amazing spots and great psychology, but the only problem is there are too many close ten counts so the atmosphere is sort of plucked away from the proceedings. It was all violence on the outside, with Triple H taking the covers off of both announce tables, even smacking Howard Finkel in the face with one of the covers! Triple H and Michaels ended up on top of the SmackDown! announce table, and Triple H was poised to suplex Michaels through the Spanish announce table, but Michaels countered. Later, Michaels attempted to a springboard crossbody, but Triple H moved out of the way, and Michaels was sent crashing through the Spanish announce table! This also busted Michaels open, and this is where the match slowed down considerably. He was losing so much blood that the match went from hardcore and brutal to do one move and then wait for the referee to count to nearly ten, only for Michaels to stand up. Triple H did hit the Spinebuster, his facebuster, and even countered the Sweet Chin Music by punching Michaels in the groin, followed by a Pedigree a little after. A steel chair Triple H brought into the ring ended up being used against him, and Michaels whacked Triple H in the head to bust him open. The end came unexpectedly when Michaels hit the Sweet Chin Music out of nowhere, and both men ended up succumbing to the ten count. Extremely disappointing ending to an otherwise phenomenal match. Winner: Draw. Match Rating: 4/5

Royal Rumble Match
Another awesome Rumble, though it doesn't stand up to the year's before it. There was a lot of solid wrestling throughout, with Chris Benoit and Randy Orton being really impressive. Kurt Angle also made things interesting, as did Nunzio when he entered. There were a lot of great performances by ever superstar involved in the Rumble, even John Cena was very entertaining (and took a SICK bump to the outside). The Big Show dominated everyone and it worked really effectively, and it all led up to Big Show tasting an Angle Slam, a picture-perfect Lionsault, the Five-Knuckle Shuffle, the Flying Headbutt, and the Five-Star Frog Splash! The biggest surprise of the night was when Test was knocked out in the back before he could enter, and Stone Cold had him replaced with Mick Foley! Foley ran out to the ring and quickly eliminated Randy Orton with his patented clothesline. Foley then choked Orton out and smacked a WWE official in the head with steel steps when he tried to restrain him. Orton countered Foley with a couple of chair shots RIGHT to the head which made me cringe. Foley chased Orton up the ramp, and as he prepared for Socko, Orton came out of nowhere and struck Foley in the groin. Socko was still used, however, on the poor, unsuspecting Nunzio. Towards the end of the match when Goldberg was dominating with Spears on everyone and he failed to Jackhammer The Big Show, Brock Lesnar interfered and hit Goldberg with the F5. Throughout the match, Matt Hardy was one of the most entertaining superstars, and he performed many Shawn Michaels-like Rumble maneuvers throughout the entirety of the event. The end of the match came when Benoit eliminated the Big Show single-handedly, and won the Rumble, meaning he'll go on to WrestleMania XX to face Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship! Winner: Chris Benoit. Match Rating: 5/5

BACKSTAGE SHENANIGANS

Stone Cold delivering Stunners to both Paul Heyman and the eccentric Eric Bischoff is always entertaining, but the interaction between Goldberg and Brock Lesnar in the locker room was corny and embarassing. Goldberg couldn't act to save a life, and why the hell were these two in a rivalry anyway? What was the point really? Following the Eddie/Chavo match, Eddie brutalized Chavo and Chavo Sr., which was fun, and following the Triple H/Shawn Michaels match, Michaels refused to be taken out on a stretcher and walked backstage, which earned a big pop. The Goldberg/Lesnar interactions were terrible and almost ruined it though. Rating: 4/5

EXTRAS

I was very impressed with the Extras for this DVD. From the Extras menu, you can watch all of the promos that played before the matches, and you could also watch an interview with Pat Patterson, the creator of the Royal Rumble, detailing the Rumble's history and some of its greatest moments. There are interviews with Mark Henry and Theodore Long, Kurt Angle, and Eddie Guerrero, plus an extra Sunday Night Heat non-title match between Women's Champion Molly Holly and the very talented Victoria, who is accompanied by Steven Richards. The actual match is pretty crap until the end when Victoria delivers the devastating Widow's Peak to get the win on Holly. There is also a backstage extra that shows Triple H and Shawn Michaels receiving medical treatment following their match. Rating: 5/5

OVERALL EVENT

There were a couple of disappointing matches, those being the WWE Championship Match and the Eddie/Chavo match. Hardcore Holly just wasn't ready to be in a main event match, and Eddie and Chavo just didn't give it their all. Still, the Rumble match is excellent, plus the Last Man Standing Match, the World Tag Team Championship Match, and the Cruiserweight Championship Matches were all very entertaining. It could have done with less Goldberg and Brock Lesnar though.",1247270400,,9194,4.834815756035578
1891815,4,B00009W0VU,"I enjoyed this edition of the Royal Rumble. It was a good start to the year of 2004 for the WWE. Held on January 24, 2004 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, this was a enjoyable show.

But it had a problem that kept it from five stars, and this was the show's undercard. Not only were some of the matches that not fun, they were too short. The first three matches were over in less then 40 minutes! Considering the whole card only had six matches on it, that meant the remaining three matches had to fill up over two hours. I know one of the matches was the Rumble itself, but that's still ridiculous.

Why four stars then? Why not a lower rating? Because of the HBK vs HHH match and the Rumble match. Both superb.

Here's my rundown:

World Tag Team Championship Tables Match
Dudley Boyz vs Ric Flair & Batista
This match was way too short for a tables match. It was over before you knew it! For some reason, I don't think Ric and Batista had that much chemistry as a team, and I don't like Batista as the heel monster he is here, it's like he has no personality at all. The Dudleys tried to keep it exciting, but this match couldn't be thrilling in the short time it was given. Disappointing. (2.5/5)

WWE Cruiserweight Championship Match
Rey Mysterio vs Jamie Noble (w/ Nidia)
The main focus of this extremely short match was on Nidia, Jamie Noble's blind girlfriend. Apart from her, this match was fun and fast, and was over too quickly. The ending was kind of bad, due to the fact Nidia grabbed Jamie's foot, thinking it was Rey. May have gotten a higher rating, had it been longer, cos I usually enjoy the Cruiserweight division. (2.5/5)

Eddie Guerrero vs Chavo Guerrero (w/ Chavo Guerrero Sr)
This match was basically all about Eddie wanting revenge on Chavo for betraying him. It was longer then the previous two matches, but still way too short! The wrestling on display was great, and the post-match beatdown of both Chavos was entertaining. (3/5)

WWE Championship Match
Brock Lesnar vs Hardcore Holly
I was surprised to see Hardcore Holly in a championship match of all things. Hardcore wanted revenge on Brock Lesnar for breaking his neck a year earlier. Unfortunately, this match was incredibly boring. Lesnar and Holly don't have good chemistry, and it developed into a match I could hardly sit through. Probably the worst match on the card. (1.5/5)

World Heavyweight Championship Last Man Standing Match
Triple H vs Shawn Michaels
Here's where things get good. This match is SUPERB. I reckon Triple H and Shawn have had some great matches together in the past (take for example, their match on Raw from 2003 - it's on Shawn's Heartbreak & Triumph DVD), and this is just another one. The Last Man Standing stipulation just made it all the more interesting, as bodies and weapons flew through the air. What I liked about this match is the way Shawn just wouldn't give up, no matter what Triple H threw at him, he'd just get back up again. There were a couple of tense moments, where you'd be wondering whether either man would get up before the 10 count. Both guys were almost half dead by the conclusion of the match, and even though Shawn lost, I was still mightily happy with this match. And we still have the Rumble to come! This match would have been an amazing main event on any other PPV. (5/5)

Royal Rumble Match
The Royal Rumble is always my favourite WWE event of the year, even over Wrestlemania, mainly cos I love the Rumble match. I look forward to it, cos I love battle royals. And this one didn't disappoint! There were many amusing moments, including Nunzio sitting outside the ring for about 15 minutes, and then John Cena coming out and throwing him into the ring. Another funny moment was when John Cena, Chris Jericho, Chris Benoit, Rob Van Dam and Kurt Angle tried to throw the Big Show from the ring but failed when Show shoved them all away from him. Other memorable moments included Kane thinking the Undertaker was coming out despite him being buried alive the year previous, Brock Lesnar coming out to eliminate Goldberg and the #1 man, Chris Benoit, lasting all the way to the end to win the match. A great Rumble, one of my favourites. (5/5)

There are some extras too, mostly interviews and promos, but there's a match from Sunday Night Heat with Victoria facing Molly Holly, a rather good diva's match. There's also a fun little segment on the history of the Rumble where Pat Patterson talks about inventing it and they show some of the famous moments.

Overall, this PPV scores four stars due to the strength of the Rumble and HHH vs HBK. Those two matches are fantastic, with everything else ranging from decent (Eddie vs Chavo), ok (Rey vs Jamie), boring (Brock vs Hardcore) and could have been good if it was longer (tables match).",1244937600,,4778,4.583138173302108
1891816,3,B00009W0VU,"Royal Rumble 2004 had one of the best Royal Rumble Matches ever. The Last Man Standing Match was just brutal. Some pretty good matches. There wasn't really a bad match, theres was some bad bookings but all the matches are decent at least.

1. Tables Match for the World Tag Team Championship
Batista & Ric Flair vs. The Dudley Boyz
This was the second tables match to take place at the Rumble but it wasn't as good as the first one that took place in 2000. It had some good brawling on the outside in the beginning. Flair & Batista looked a little lost but it had a good table spot at the end. I really loved Flair's after match interview; it was very entertaining to me. 3.5/5

2. Cruiserweight Championship
Rey Mysterio vs. Jamie Noble w/ Nidia
Now I have a question, what ever happened to the cruiserweight title? Did Vince eliminated it or what? The cruiserweights always put on a good showing but this match wasn't that good of a showing. I think it was more about putting over Nidias blindness gimmick more than anything. I would have rather seen Mysterio & Tijari fighting for the title. Decent match. 3/5

3. Eddie Guererro vs. Chavo Guererro w/ Chavo Guererro Sr.
This was a good battle from these. Good Guererro offense from both men. Chavo Sr. interferred but he got his after the match. The Guererro's put on another good showing. 4/5

4. WWE Championship
Brock Lesnar vs. Hardcore Holly
I have no problem with Holly being in this title match but the title just wasn't for Holly during this time period. Holly went for Lesnar in the early going. This was just an all out brawl. Most of the match Holly went for Lesnar's neck but then Holly got hit with the F5 out of no where. Good showing from Holly. 3.5/5

5. Last Man Standing Match for the World Heavyweight Championship
Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels
This match was just brutal. They wore each other just the slap out. Hunter and Shawn both bled a lot but to me the match just didn't felt like it lived up the hype so a speak. The match itself went a little too slow and seemed like it dragged on, but don't get me wrong, both Hunter & Shawn left everything they had in the ring at the end but it just felt differently from their previous encounters. But is was just a brutal match to say the least. 4.5/5

6. Royal Rumble Match
This was a very good Rumble Match. It had some good elimination spots, some good wrestling, some good comebacks, just some good everything.

The match started with Benoit and Orton being the first two and they put on a good showing all the way up to when Orton got eliminated. Kane also had a good showing when he entered the ring, he would even chokeslam Spike on the steel ramp way after a preview of the returning Undertaker would get him eliminated. The Cat had a good comedy act going on. The crowd got pumped when Angle entered the match but they really went wild when Mick Floey made his return to the ring and went after Orton which would lead to their match at Wrestlemania & Backlash. It had a good final four showing. Benoit had a great match showing throughout the whole match and he really deserved this one. Great Rumble. 5/5

1891828,4,B00009W0VU,"As with all Royal Rumble events, the Rumble itself is the main event.  Still, there has to be other matches, and none of them in particular really impressed me compared to other Royal Rumbles or the Rumble itself.

World Tag Team Championship

Batista and Ric Flair (C) vs The Dudley Boyz

This was a very standard table match, and in no way anything like the table match at Royal Rumble 2000.  Ric Flair is boring to watch--he's getting too old for wrestling, and Batista alone can't cover for his obvious deficiencies.  Not too much good action here, but it wasn't a complete dud.  (4/10)

Cruiserweight Championship

Jamie Noble (C) vs Rey Mysterio

What was this given, like three minutes?  Rather than putting on a spectacle here, the match was done and gone as soon as you were starting to get into it.  (5/10)

Eddie Guerrero vs Chavo Guerrero

This was one hell of a storyline they were developing here.  The match was barely much longer than the previous cruiserweight match and almost 1/3 of the total time was spent post-match with Eddie brutalizing Chavo and Chavo jr.  (5/10)

WWE Championship

Brock Lesnar (C) vs Hardcore Holly

The career-jobber in a main event match?  No way can Hardcore Holly be much more than a jobber without a serious gimmick makeover and an improvement from mere brawling style to something more athletic.  I could see the justification in this match, where a year and a third before, Lesnar botched a powerbomb and broke Holly's neck, but rather than give us a fight truly worth vengeance, the booking has Holly trying to ""break"" Lesnar's neck with cheap full nelsons and other half-wit submission holds that make for a gloriously lackluster match.  (1/10)

World Heavyweight Championship

Triple H (C) vs Shawn Michaels

I love Triple H despite his lack of real wrestling talent, and paired with the right opponents, his negatives are easily hidden by his positives.  This was something of that for an example.  The match was slow to begin with, but it began picking up at points, including an amazing moonsault by Shawn Michaels onto the Spanish Announcer's table---missing Triple H as he rolled off the table.  My only major complaint was the easy and obvious blading done by Michaels and Triple H (even a point where you could see Triple H removing the razor from his wrist tape).  (8/10)

Royal Rumble Match

Having witnessed only two other Royal Rumbles, in a time before WWE started decaying in quality (Rumble 2000 and 2001), I was surprised to see that the match actually maintained the same quality I'd come to expect.  The action wasn't as spectacular as in 2000 or 2001, but it was entertaining enough, and even with a cliffhanger ending which saw someone who actually deserves a Wrestlemania main event title shot go through hell to win.

1891834,5,B00009W0VU,"The 2004 Royal Rumble match is perhaps the greatest rumble of all time, second perhaps only to the 1992 match. The undercard here is decent, with some very good matches and some fairly awful matches.

Batista (C) and Ric Flair (C) vs. The Dudley Boys in a Tables Match

A decent way to start off the show, but not an especially good match. There were some nice spots involving the tables, but Batista really didn't look so great here, and Flair seemed out of place with a table in his hands. The Dudley Boys weren't even especially good, and this is supposed to be their expertise.

Rey Mysterio (C) vs. Jaime Noble

If this match had been given a decent amount of time, it would have been great, but the two worked with what they got and put on one of the better matches of the night. Noble is a very good technical wrestler and he looked very good next to Mysterio who was exciting as always.

Eddie Guerrero vs. Chavo Guerrero

This one suffers the same fate as the previous match: not enough time to take off. The Guerreros put on a good match but it was a disappointment considering what these guys are truly capable of. Some nice high flying moves and some very good technical wrestlers. The two have great chemistry together, from all those years of wrestling with each other.

Brock Lesnar (C) vs. Hardcore Holly

This is a match that never should have happened. Bob Holly is not main event material, and Brock Lesnar is an awful wrestler. He got where he was because he was strong. He's basically Mark Henry. While guys with real talent were midcarding, these two got to fight for the WWE title. It's pretty sad. Holly is a decent wrestler, but not nearly good enough to make Brock Lesnar look good. The only person I can remember doing that was Chris Benoit. The match was also very predictable. The only good thing to say about this match was that it was short.

Triple H (C) vs. Shawn Michaels in a Last Man Standing Match

These two always put on solid matches, and Last Man Standing matches tend to be exciting. This is definitely the best match of the night other than the main event. Obviously, Michaels had no chance of winning, but that didn't put a dent into this match. Very good performance.

2004 Royal Rumble Match

As I said earlier, this might be the greatest Royal Rumble match of all time. Chris Benoit was absolutely outstanding and any time you get to watch Chris Benoit for an hour its a very good thing. Randy Orton and Kurt Angle also looked very good, and even Goldberg was entertaining in this one.

This DVD is worth getting solely for the Rumble match. The undercard was decent, but not phenomenal. Skip over the Lesnar-Holly match. Otherwise, buy this for an amazing rumble.",1139356800,6,2711,4.5081632653061225

Match Two-Cruiserweight Championship-Rey Mysterio(C)Vs Jamie Noble-Whats with this show??? This was another very short match. So their progressing the teased Jamie & Nidia break up but it shouldn't be overshining a cruiser match. These two could do a lot better. My rating 3.18/10.

Match Five-Last Man Standing-World Heavyweight Championship-HHH(C)Vs Shawn""HBK""Michaels-This was a brutal bloody brawl with lots of bumps and good action.

RIC FLAIR & BATISTA defeated THE DUDLEY BOYZ in a Tables Match to Retain the World Tag-Team Titles: Damn it; Open with the cruiserweights!!! How many more times do I have to say it!?!?!? Yes, The Dudleyz do also effectively open shows, but this match, and the one that followed it, proved why the WWE have to revert back to the cruiserweights opening shows. This was a very mediocre & short bout which almost appeared as if it was 100% ad lib. It gave the impression that there was no planning to it at all. Furthermore, there wasn't much intensity in the ring, despite it being a decent feud. The abrupt ending just topped it off!!! Match Rating...4

REY MYSTERIO defeated JAMIE NOBLE to Retain the Cruiserweight Title: Man, if I called the last match short, then this one didn't exist. I think it lasted less than 4 minutes!!! What more can I say, everything that happened in the 4 minutes was fast-paced & crisp, while there was some decent storytelling involved with Nidia & the ending to the bout. But at only 4 minutes, this one's hard to rate. Match Rating...5

EDDIE GUERRERO defeated CHAVO GUERRERO: This match also surprised me in the way it was booked. I won't say it was anti-climactic, but with the importance that the feud has been given lately, I did expect more. Having said that, I did state last week that Eddie is above Chavo & he should win this bout cleanly, so I can't really complain. I suppose Eddie didn't dominate, but the fact that Chavo never really looked like winning definitely surprised me. The beatdown after the match also had me scratching my forehead... Were the WWE testing reaction to an Eddie heel turn, or were they trying to quickly sweep this feud under the carpet, so that these 2 can start new & separate feuds!?!?!? Another hard one to rate. Match Rating...6

BROCK LESNAR defeated HARDCORE HOLLY to Retain the WWE Championship: Acceptable time-passer, although I think most know my opinion on the existence of this match on a major ppv card. The feud has been good, and I like the way the psychology aspect of it was used in the match. I even agreed with the reasoning behind Lesnar tying Holly up & grounding him. But my goodness, was it overdone... and badly at that!!! There was way too many boring spots for a match that hardly travelled 10 minutes, and I think the rear gut-wrench/bearhug that Lesnar applied more than once, was quite possibly the weakest looking move I've seen this decade!!! Match Rating...5

TRIPLE H & SHAWN MICHAELS Wrestled to a Draw in a Last Man Standing Match for the World HeavyWeight Title: I think I have had trouble rating every single match on this card. This was no exception. While it was entertaining & generated some excitement at various stages of the match, there is something about the way that this bout was structured that had me a little underwhelmed. After the first 3 minutes, the 2 wrestlers basically just took turns in beating on each other for a short spurt, until the one that was taking the beating got up somewhere between a 7 and 9 count. I think that's why I have never really liked 'Last Man Standing' matches; They are all fairly similar. While I wasn't super impressed with the result, the ending didn't bother me too much. Match Rating...7

ROYAL RUMBLE MATCH Won By Chris Benoit: Now, I'm going to be a little tough on the rating here, and in all honesty, it is a little unfair to the match itself. But stuff it!!! I pretty much, with a few exceptions (eg: 1992 & 1999), always rate the Rumble match a 9 out of 10. It is that consistent & entertaining from year to year, in my opinion. But I've decided to drop a point here because of the predictability aspect of it. The Chris Benoit rumor was indeed true, and I have to personally state that it reduced the impact of one of my favorite wrestlers winning one of the biggest matches of the year. And he did it from position #1 in over an hour!!! Bottom line; The WWE MUST do something to stop information like this leaking to the internet. But let us not get bogged down there, as that's a whole different column.

There's not much else I really need to say. The match was entertaining. I didn't have too many problems with when wrestlers entered, and when they were eliminated (although, I thought Goldberg should have lasted another 2-3 minutes before Lesnar ran in). There were also some nice touches, such as The Undertaker's gong, Mick Foley's brilliant & intense appearance, and the excellently booked & performed ending involving Benoit & The Big Show. All in all, these Rumble matches are always great viewing & a good reminder of the depth of the talent roster at a point in time. This one was no exception. Match Rating...8

PPV RATING (35/60) = 58

Looking at the key, I have basically given the 2004 Royal Rumble a 'C' grade & said that it was 'average'. That's probably a little harsh, but The Royal Rumble ppv is always a hard event to grade, as there are less singles matches on the card & those matches are almost always shorter than what we would expect. What this card did lack that the past few Rumbles have had, is a quality back up to the Battle Royal. I thought that the World HeavyWeight Title match would do the job, but it fell a little short. That, and the leak of Benoit winning from position #1, just soured the event a little in my view. Now if only I could stop reading newsposts & spoilers!!!",1114732800,,5909,4.529080675422139
1891844,4,B00009W0VU,"Royal Rumble 2004 was a great way to start 2004, however the rest of the year wasn't as good as this event. The two main reasons to watch this was of course the Royal Rumble, in which Chris Benoit gets his rightful chance to win the World Heavyweight Championship, and the Last Man Standing match between his two opponents at WM 20.

Tag Team Championship Match

Tables Match

Batista and Ric Flair [Champions] vs. Dudley Boyz:

I really didn't like Batista and Flair as champions, and luckily this was the only ppv event in which they defended their titles. The match itself was about five minutes long, and Flair and Batista win after Batista throws D-Von through a table in the ring. 7/10

Crusierweight Championship

Jamie Noble vs. Rey Mysterio [Champion]

Not that good, this match was maybe 4 minutes at the most. Rey hits the 619 to retain his championship. 3/10

Eddie Guerrero vs. Chavo Guerrero:

I liked the Guerreros when they were a tag team, and maybe its time to bring them back because the tag team division really needs the help. The match was good, but really slow at some spots and since it was less than 8 minutes long it really didn't help that much. Eddie wins with the Frog Splash. 6/10

After the match Eddie beats up Chavo as Chavo's father watches when his tie is wrapped around the bottom rope.

WWE Championship

Brock Lesnar [Champion] vs. Hardcore Holly

I never liked the idea of Holly coming back to only break Brock's neck, but I disliked Lesnar about that time so this match didn't do it for me. Holly actually takes it to Lesnar but Lesnaer wins with the F5. 5/10 [Lesnar's worst ppv title defense ever]

World Heavyweight Championship Match

Last Man Standing Match

Triple H [Champion] vs. Shawn Michales:

Now this was a good 25 minute match. Shawn even goes through an announce table in the middle of the match. Chairs were used and both men were busted open. The crowd finally woke up to get well into this match, and there were some intense moments in this match.

The ending had both men unable to stand after Shawn gave Triple H the Sweet Chin Music kick. 9/10 [Good match, finally!]

Royal Rumble Match

Winner gets to headline WM 20:

What a Rumble, Benoit proves he is for real. So many different angles in the match; from Mick Foley coming back and attacking Randy Orton, to the Big Show tossing around 6 or 7 guys around the ring, to the Undertaker's old gong going off and distracting Kane. Good stuff.

The ending saw Brock Lesnaer come down to the ring and F5 Goldberg which then let Kurt Angle toss Goldberg out. Then when it was down to two men left Benoit grabbed Big Show's head and threw him out of the ring. 10/10 [Benoit earned that victory]

Royal Rumble 2004 is definately worth it for the last two matches alone, yeah it did have a horrible undercard, but the last two matches saved the whole thing.",1114214400,,2861,4.53411306042885

1. World Tag Team Championships: Batista and Ric Flair vs The Dudley Boyz, quick, shirt tables match that hid everyones' limitations, some typical interference from Johnathan Coachman enables Batista to throw D-Von through a table to win and keep the belts for himself and Flair **1/2

2. Cruserweight Championship: Rey Mysterio vs Jamie Noble: An original way to end a match, as the blinded Nidia costs Noble the win in an exciting, if slightly rushed, encounter *

3. Eddie Guerrero vs Chavo Guerrero: ANOTHER short match, but this time was slightly more brutal than the last two, with Chavo getting pretty busted up after Eddie pins him, some good wrestling, but a complete squash in the long run  **

5.

This match was ok a bit short and had a predictable ending. I predict big things for Batista in the future.

Match 2-Rey Mysterio VS Jamie Noble.(Crusierweight Titel)

Not the best cruiserweight math ever but not the worst. Rey Mysterio wins when Nidia accidently trips Noble up and Rey hits the 619.

Match 3-Eddie Guerrero VS Chavo Guerrero

I think that this match was one of the better matches on the card, even though it was a bit predictable. Eddie beats the hell out of Chavo and wins whith the frogsplash. I expected the match to be a bit longer, and get rid of Chavo senior.

Match 4-Brock Lesnar VS Hardcore Holly (WWE Championship)

I was dissapointed with this match. Hardcore should be the no1 contendor for the U.S Titel no the WWE Championship.

Match 5- Triple H VS Shawn Michaels (Last Man Standing, World Heavyweight Championship)

This was the best match of the night(part from rumble). HBK Should have be named the champ. Lots of blood. The two beat the hell of out each other until HBK hits sweet chin music and falls. Neither men get up for the 10 count so its a draw and HHH Retains. Not many people were happy bout the desision.

Match 6- Royal Rumble

One of the best Rumbles ever. I think Goldberg should have won and it have been Goldberd vs HHH vs HBK at Wrestlmania but there you go. I have nothin against Chris Benoit but prefer Goldberg. The best parts were Undertakers Gong which causes Kane to be eliminated by Booker T , and when Mick Foley returns and kicks Randy Ortons ass. The best part was the look on Ortons face. Another good part was when all the superstars teamed up and performed one of there finishers on the Big Show.

I would also complain that Raw should have had one more match so both shows could be even but it wouldn't have really mattered anyway because the matches would just be shorter that way.

This match was definitely the best besides the Rumble match. It was brutal and entertaining. It made the other matches completely forgettable. 9/10

30-man Royal Rumble Match (Chris Benoit wins after starting at #1 and going all the way)

It was an outstanding Rumble match. The best parts were when The Undertaker's gong distracts Kane and he gets eliminated by Booker T, Mick Foley replaces Test at number #25 and he and Randy have a fight, then when they are at the ramp Nunzio gets a mandible claw from Foley. Also it is interesting when Nunzio never enters the ring and just sits back on the barracade, even though he is eventually thrown into the ring by John Cena. Goldberg coming in was probably the best part cause it's his first Rumble and he destroys some Smackdown stars with his deadly Spear. Goldberg is eventually eliminated when Brock rushes in and F-5s him and Kurt throws him out of the ring a few moments later. Chris Benoit and Big Show are the last two. Benoit grabs Big Show's head and pulls him down through the ropes. He hits the floor pretty soon and Benoit is the winner of the 2004 Royal Rumble match. 10/10

I still think only the Rumble should be on the DVD and the Last Man Standing between Triple H and Shawn Michaels for the World Heavyweight title. I realized now why it's called the Royal Rumble because they don't really care about all the other matches except the Rumble. Or they were just too worried about going over 2 hours and 40 minutes.

Royal Rumble- Not a bad one.  special appearance by earnest the cat miller and some other i guy i forgot his name who was with earnest.  they started singing but the #1 entry benoit and #2 entry orton beat them out of the ring.  Highlights of thge match include undertakers gong sounding but spike coming out instead costing kane the match, who chokeslamed spike onto the steel who didn't make it into the rumble.  mick foley took test's spot after knocking him out and went right for orton and eliminated himself and orton and proceeding to fight outside the ring and up to the ramp, where foley gave nunzio the manible claw when he came out and nunzio stayed out of the ring waiting for it to clear, but cena got him in.

1891884,4,B00009W0VU,"While I did like the 2004 Royal Rumble, it was the Rumble match itself that saves this card along with one other match:
The Dudleyz Vs. Ric Flair/Batista (RAW World Tag Team Title Match under Table Match Rules) - Very slow and boring match. Flair looked totally out of his element here! Thankfully it was short when Batista put D-Von Dudley through the table!
Rey Mysterio Vs. Jamie Noble w/Nidia (WWE Cruiserweight Championship Match) - Good match but WAAAAAY TOO SHORT!
Eddie Gurrerro Vs. Chavo Gurrerro, Jr. w/Chavo Classic - Match was just about the right length. Was definitely more serious than their WCW encounters a few years ago.
Brock Lesner Vs. Hardcore Holly (Smackdown WWE World Title Match) - Was more than I expected but ended as I figured with Brock taking down Hardcore!
""The Game"" Triple H Vs. Shawn ""HBK"" Michaels (RAW World Heavyweight Title Match under Last Man Standing Rules) - The second best match on the card! What keeps this from being THE match on the card is the suck-booty ending they gave us! It wasn't the greatest match in history but definitely a classic and better than what we had seen thus far until......
The Royal Rumble Match - Winner gets a world championship shot at WrestleMania XX! This match was great! Not the best Rumble but it pretty much saves the card along with the Michaels/HHH match! Benoit's performance has to be considered the top five performances ever in that particular match! Here is my ranking as far as performances in that match:
1. ""Nature Boy "" Ric Flair - Not only did he last over an hour in the 1992 version of The Royal Rumble but he won the WWF World Title as a bonus! True, he was number 3 but come on! What's two numbers! Coming in that low and winning was unheard of until 1992!
2. Chris Benoit - He's got to be considered next because he was the first man in years to start it and finish it! Not only that, he was the first man in years to last over an hour and win!
3. Bob Backlund - Though he didn't win the 1993 Royal Rumble (the winner of that one was the late Yokozuna), he was number 2 and lasted over an hour before being eliminated by Yokozuna and he was 43 years old at the time! That is a hell of a feat!
4. Kane - He didn't win the Royal Rumble either in 2001 but he did enter at number 5 and lasted nearly an hour before being the last man eliminated by the winner of that Rumble (which was ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin). Now, considering that Kane is around 6'11"" tall and weighs over 300lbs. of mostly muscle, the ods are really against him surviving that long! I am in pretty good shape (I am 6'2"", 250lbs.) and I would have a tough time doing that. He shouldn't have been able too but he did!
5. Shawn Michaels - I only give him credit because he did start at number one and won it! Beyond that, his win at the 1995 Royal Rumble was totally overhyped! I totally agree with shinedownfan's opinion on HBK's win! I mean, that year the wrestlers entered every 60 seconds! Which means that he only had to wrestle 35-40 minutes tops! Impressive to be sure but his win was way overhyped!
Back to the Rumble 2004, in addition to the inspirational performance of Benoit, Randy Orton as well as The Big Show gave a good accounting of themselves. The surprise appearance of Mick Foley was an added treat as well! I give Randy credit because he showed as much endurance as Benoit and probably would've been there at the end if not for Foley (not that I was heartbroken that Orton got eliminated but got to give the man credit). TBS only gets credit because he was so dominant for the short time that he was in there though he ended up on the wrong end of signature moves of Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho, RVD, John Cena and others!
Well, overall not bad. The last two matches saves it though!",1089590400,,3765,4.38

Raw Tag Titles - Table match - Dudleys V Flair & Batista
This match was too short and it ends quite abruptly. Also, only one member of a team has to go through a table, it used to be both. It was entertaining while it lasted though. 7/10
Cruiserweight Title - Jamie Noble V Rey Mysterio
This match could have been great, but it lasted only 3 minutes! It never had time to get really good. 6/10
Eddie Guerrero V Chavo Guerrero
This could have been a great match. How, it was paced a bit slowly, and didn't last long enough. After it ends Eddie beats up Chavo more and also beast up Chavo Sr. 6/10
WWE Title - Brock Lesnar V Hardcore Holly
Hardcore Holly should probably stick to mid-card, maybe trying to get the US title. This was an alright match, but it ends too soon (again!). 7/10
World Heavyweight Title - Last Man Standing Match  - Triple H V Shawn Michaels
They don't use weapons much at all in this match. They use a chair a few times but that's about it. Shawn Michaels does go through the announce table though, and it looks cool. Both men bleed quite a lot, and the match had enough time (it was the first match of the night to actually last long enough!). It was a good match, but the ending was disappointing. Neither man answers the 10 count so it's a draw and Triple H keeps the title. The crowd boo quite a lot there because it looks like Shawn should have won. 8/10
Royal Rumble Match
This was a pretty good rumble. Not as good as 2003 or 2001 but better than 2000. Mick Foley enters by attacking Test and then eliminates himself and Orton. Undertaker's gong sounds causing Kane to be distracted. Big Show put on a good show, and Nunzio was just funny. Benoit came in number 1 and it was great to see him win it to go on to WrestleMania XX. 8/10
Overall
The Rumble match was good, and so was HBK/HHH except for it's ending. All the other matches were too rushed, which brought the whole show down a fair bit.",1086393600,,1943,4.237196765498652
1891887,4,B00009W0VU,"My friend let me borrow this DVD and I saw it and I was really pleased, but a little dissapointed thing to it, a couple of matches was too short but they where still good,
1)Dudleyz vs Ric Flair/Batista  Tag Titles
I liked it but a little sloppy, but it turned out pretty good 7.5/10
2) Rey Mysterio vs Jamie Noble  Cruiserweight Title
  again a awesome match but way to short 8.5/10
3) Eddie vs Chavo
  great match up, littl longer than previous match but a gret match 9/10
4) Hardcore Holly vs Brock Lesnar WWE Title
 O.K match up, bad ending  7/10
5)HHH vs HBK  World Title
finally a long match up and the best match of the night with the rumble, bad ending though 10/10
6) Royal Rumble
 this was a great Royal Rumble, longer than I thought it will be, mayb some matches was short because of The Rumble
This was a great PPV, worth buying",1084406400,,840,4.226415094339623
1891895,5,B00009W0VU,"this rumble was great. finally benoit gets what he deserves. benoit winning the rumble was the best thing of the night. triple vs hbk was good but, i hate the ending. other matches were to short. the first couple of matches were only 10-15 min.
""nothing left to lose"" was a good theme for rumble. as it signified what benoit has gone through the past 18 years to get to royal rumble and win and go to wrestlemania 20. best rumble EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! get it now! do it, do it now!!1",1082678400,,494,4.5
1891896,4,B00009W0VU,"royal rumble is always a good ppv because of the rumble match. the extras on the dvd were good. the only downside is the 1st 4 matches seemed to be rushed. there are several confrontations between raw & smackdown superstars on this ppv that are a must see.
MOLLY HOLLY VS VICTORIA 1/10- this match was on sunday night heat. the crowd was not interested in the match; neither were the announcers. boring is the word for this & why wasn't the title on the line?
TABLES MATCH
WORLD TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP
RIC FLAIR & BATISTA VS BUBBA RAY & D-VON DUDLEY 4/10- this match was way too short. only about 4 min. a tables match needs more time, especially in the old ecw territory. was over before it really got going. disappointing.
WWE CRUISERWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP
REY MYSTERIO VS JAMIE NOBLE 7/10- a very good match but was too short. this match should have been 15-20 min long. 6 min is too little for the cruiserweights. it was fast paced & action filled with a stupid ending. if not for the ending & short time, could have been a 9.
CHAVO GUERRERO JR. VS EDDIE GUERRERO 7/10- great buildup to this match. uncle vs nephew. bringing chavo guerrero sr. out of retirement was an excellent idea. crowd is really getting behind eddie lately. great idea that turned out to be sort of a letdown. was expecting a 10/10, but match was too short. after the match looked too fake & staged. need a rematch.
WWE CHAMPIONSHIP
BROCK LESNAR VS HARDCORE HOLLY 4/10- one of the worst wwe championship matches ever. it was only 7 min long. it was over too quickly plus holly is not a main eventer who deserves a title shot. hope this fued ends quick.
LAST MAN STANDING MATCH
WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP
TRIPLE HHH VS SHAWN MICHAELS 7/10- a good match that could have been better. michaels put on another outstanding performance. triple hhh's slowness & the sorry ending kept this from a higher score.

i don't understand why wwe puts its eggs in one basket? 54 minutes into the ppv & 4 matches were already contested. at least the last man standing match was given plenty of time. a lot of wasted time such as the confrontation between paul heyman & eric bischoff before the rumble. wwe made it look like 2 matches & the rest as time filler.",1081987200,,2870,4.629411764705883

Royal Rumble 2004 really shows a more slowed down and back to basics style of wrestling which can be quite enjoyable if done right. The event featured:
1)World Tag Team Championship: Table's Match:
Batista & Ric Flair(c) vs. The Dudley Boyz. This match never truly reaches a climax as it ends quite abruptly. The action was quite sloppy and I'm getting alittle tired of the Dudley Boyz. 3/10
2) WWE Cruserweight Title:
Rey Mysterio Jr.(c) vs. Jamie Knoble. A match that could have a been a classic if not for it only being 3 minutes long! 5/10
3) Chavo Guerrero Jr. vs. Eddie Guerrero. A really decent match unfortunatly Chavo isn't quite as gifted as his uncle in the ring. 7/10
4) WWE Championship:
Brock Lesnar(c) vs. Hardcore Holly. Holly should had never have been given the oppurtunity to take on Brock. The match is tremendously slow paced and right when think things are going to get exciting the match is over. 4/10
5) World Heavyweight Championship: Last Man Standing Match
Triple H(c) vs. Shawn Micheals
Not quite as good as their match on raw the previous year but quite entertaining none the less. 9/10
6) 30 Man Battle Royal: Literally the show saver, the match featured many memorable moments like Mick Foley jumping Test to get entered in the match, Undertaker's gong and Chris Benoit finally getting the spotlight put on him. Big Show also puts on quite the performance. 10/10
Overall 3/6 matches were great and they took up the majority of the show, so this is definity worth a look.",1079481600,2,1647,4.7421602787456445
1891899,3,B00009W0VU,"EVOLUTION VS. THE DUDLEY BOYZ IN A TABLE MATCH FOR THE WORLD TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP
This was an okay match.  I wish the Coach would have gotten 3D'd again, but it was cool to see D-Von get chokeslamed through the table.  2 out of 5.
REY MYSTERIO VS. JAMIE NOBLE FOR THE WWE CRUISERWEIGHT TITLE
This match was too short.  It was high flying how ever, and Nidia messing up Jamie Noble set up their No Way Out Match.  3 out of 5.
EDDIE GUERRERO VS. CHAVO GUERRERO
This was again too short.  Eddie did nothing for the first 7 minutes.  All he did was a triple suplex and the frog splash.  However, the post match beat down was cool.  It was a personal match.  4 out of 5.
BROCK LESNAR VS. HARDCORE HOLLY FOR THE WWE CHAMPIONSHIP
Once again, this was a short match.  It was considered the Smackdown main event but it was only 10 minutes long.  3 out of 5.
SHAWN MICHAELS VS. HHH IN A LAST MAN STANDING MATCH FOR THE WORLD HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPIONSHIP
This was not a good match.  They did not use any weapons barely.  That is basically why Last Man Standing Matches are cool.  Shawn Michaels can get up after a pedigree, but not after giving sweet chin music.  Absolute Horse Crap.  2 out of 5.
ROYAL RUMBLE MATCH
This saved the show.  Benoit was #1 and went all the way.  It was good.  The Undertaker's gong was cool to.  This was GREATNESS.  5 out of 5.

1891900,2,B00009W0VU,All the matches were too short as if they were short in time. Rey vs Noble 3mins ?! The main event between HHH and HBK was disapointing. They had a 2 times better match on Raw earlier. The Rumble itself is one of the best i've seen in my 20 years i've been watching wrestling.,1079308800,,276,4.036363636363636
1891901,3,B00009W0VU,"On paper this rumble appears to be 1 of the best ever. However WWE's new slower paced matches and POOR time allocation helped ruin what could have been a 5 star ppv.
The tables match opener was slow paced and nothing happened- the end just was there outta nowhere and it did not deliver. 3/10
The cruiser match could have been awesome. Look at the Smackdown the week after this. It was a rematch and was incredible. Instead they get a really cheap 3 min match with only 1 or 2 good moves. What a waste of great fast talent. 4/10
Guerrero/Guerrero could have been another great match but there was NO offense in the whole match. 3 suplexes and a frog splash and thats it? Terribly played out. Should have taken the time for the beatdown after and used it for the match. 5/10
Hardcore Holly is not a good wrestler. But the buildup was good and Brock can usually carry crappy wrestlers. Holly proved to just be too rusty and luckily it wsa kept short. Decent in ring work though. 6/10
HBK and HHH was a letdown. Only 1 high spot and a questionable ending. The match on raw 2 weeks before was far and above this match and it just seemed like they weren't sure where to go with this match. It plodded along and it was a poor culmination of their conflict. I guess it served its purpose of setting up Mania. 6/10
The segment with Heyman and Bischoff was TERRIBLE! give teh earlier matches more time. The first 5 matches were through in an hour and they throw in this crap.
The rumble was incredibly entertaing and the finish had the crowd going nuts. SO many high spots and so many buildups made this incredible to watch. Perfectly executed building up Benoit and Orton and this was the best rumble of all time. 10/10
The DVD has decent extras- nothing worth watching more than once. Basically just promos. No extra points for the presentation thats for sure. Overall a decent ppv saved by the rumble.",1079308800,,1895,4.417142857142857

2. Rey vs. Jamie Noble, 4/10 Not that good of a match but it built up the Nidia/Noble match at least Rey won.
3. Eddie vs. Chavo, 8/10 history making match a good family match
4. Brock vs. Holly, 6/10 decent match But i like Brock
5. Triple H vs. HBk 5/10 what was so good about this? sure HBK was awesome but why barly no weapons
6. Royal Rumble 10/10 a great match undertakers gong was cool i was hoping so bad he would come out and brock was cool how he F-5 Goldberg. Micks return was cool how he attacked Ortan. The rest of the Rumble was amazing but im not going to spoil it for you ;)

7993450,5,B00009W0VU,"1.) WWE World Tag Team Championship Tables Match: The Dudley Boyz vs Batista and Ric Flair (c)

In a bit of an interesting Royal Rumble fact, this was the 4th Royal Rumble PPV in a row that the Dudley Boyz were in a match with the Tag Team Championships on the line and the 5th Royal Rumble that they were overall involved in a Tag Team match. Batista cuts a heel promo on The Dudleyz on the way to the ring and claims the Dudleyz are the biggest 3x losers since the Philadelphia Eagles. That's all it takes for the Dudleyz to attack Flair and Batista at the entrance ramp and a brawl between both teams opens up. The Coach was at the commentary desk with Lawler and J.R. to specifically call this match after he had recently been 3D'd through a table by Bubba and D-Von. The Dudleyz had prepared to finish off Flair with a 3D through a table but Coach interfered with a distraction and as expected, takes a beating. Flair prevents the Dudleyz from hitting the Wassup on Coach and ejects Bubba from the ring. Batista appears back in the ring and puts D-Von through a table with a spinebuster for he and Flair to retain the tag titles. Coach does a post-match interview with Flair and Batista and Flair cuts a borderline deranged promo (then again all Flair promos are like that) claiming Evolution is forever.

Josh Matthews gets John Cena's thoughts on the Royal Rumble match but RVD randomly interrupts before Cena goes on to proclaim he'll win the Royal Rumble match

2.) WWE Cruiserweight Championship Match: Rey Mysterio (c) vs Jamie Noble w/Nidia

Nidia came to the ring blind as she'd recently been ""blinded"" by black mist from Tajiri, which seemed like a big reason why this match happened was to continue the Nidia's blind story. Nidia ends up accidentally tripping Noble whom she thought was Mysterio. But since she was..blind, she had no clue. Nidia's accidental trip, distracts Noble long enough for Mysterio to dropkick him into the ropes and drop him with a 619. One pin later and Mysterio retains the championship. Noble yells at Nidia after the match about costing him the championship. Quick but nice, fast paced cruiserweight action.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

3.) Chavo Guerrero w/Chavo Guerrero Sr. vs Eddie Guerrero

I remember seeing this storyline unfold back when I was a kid and looking back on it, I still feel the same way when I say it was awesome build up. The story had the typical team split story where one gets tired of being in the other's shadow but the intense heat that was built between Eddie and Chavo leading up to their match was purely great. It was the first Uncle vs Nephew match in WWE and it was a good one. This was another short match, unfortunately. Eddie and Chavo make good use of their time though with some satisfying action. In the end, Eddie hits the Frog Splash on Chavo for the win. A furious Eddie viciouslyattacks both Chavo and Chavo Sr after the match, busting Chavo open in the process. Great match that was the kickstart of Eddie's main event push. However this match deserved at least 10-15 full minutes of action after such excellent booking

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Josh Matthews tries to get Chris Benoit's thoughts on the Royal Rumble but he's almost immediately interrupted by Evolution. Flair tells Benoit he always comes in at second each time he tries to rise to the top. Flair says it's not about Benoit, it's about Evolution. He goes on to remind Benoit one last time that he'll always be second best and goes off partying with Batista and Randy Orton.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

3.) WWE Championship Match: Hardcore Holly vs Brock Lesnar (c)

This match all happened after Brock Lesnar legitimately broke Holly's neck with a powerbomb back in 2002, so they turned it into a storyline and Holly returned a few months prior to the PPV with a vengeance. It was a bit weird seeing Holly as a main eventer, competing for the championship. Yes he was a veteran and maybe he had earned some main event spotlight time, but something about him just didn't belong in the World Title picture. Anyways, Holly attacks Lesnar as he gets in the ring but Lesnar fights back and stays in control in the early parts of the match. Holly makes a comeback with an Alabama Slam and tries to break Lesnar's neck with a full nelson. Lesnar slides under the ring and ricochet's Holly's repaired neck off the top rope, causing him to release the hold. Lesnar F5's a stunned Holly and makes the cover to retain the title. Didn't really care for this match and didn't seem appropriate to take place on PPV but moreso on Smackdown. The fans didn't seem too interested in this match and didn't seem invested in Holly's comeback story or his position as a main eventer either. I guess WWE took note of this or either felt the same way as fans because this was Holly's only time he got his 15 minutes of fame. Following the Royal Rumble he was right back to fighting on the mid-card on Smackdown

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

5.) WWE World Heavyweight Championship Last Man Standing Match: Shawn Michaels vs Triple H

After a lackluster WWE Championship match, excitement picks up with this World Heavyweight Championship match. The epic and intense Shawn Michaels/Triple H feud from 2002 was renewed in late 2003/early 2004 and they were butting heads again. Their return match against each other was in this brutal and bloody Last Man Standing Match. They waste no time tearing into each other. Shawn takes a sick dive into the Spanish announce table and hits his head on something because he was cut open moments later with blood flowing down his face. After some competitive back and forth action, Michaels connects with Sweet Chin Music on Triple H and collapses immediately after. Neither Triple H or Shawn Michaels could answer referee Hebner's 10 count so the match goes to a draw. It was a clever ending to make sure neither man looked weak, losing. It was also just the latest match in the bloody Triple H vs Shawn Michaels saga.

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Eric Bischoff storms down to the ring and puts over Raw, claiming that Raw is the superior show than Smackdown in every way and he's the superior general manager. Heyman comes to the ring and tackles Bischoff which leads to sheriff Stone Cold Steve Austin riding to the ring on his ATV. He lays out both Bischoff and Heyman with Stunners and drinks a few beers before making his way to the back.

Goldberg is interviewed by Terri about the Rumble but Lesnar interrupts and we get a segment between Lesnar and Goldberg to tease a match between the 2, which as everyone knows would eventually happen

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

6.) 2004 Royal Rumble Match

The 2004 Royal Rumble turned out to be an exciting one, mainly because for the first time in a long time were multiple superstars other than just the favorite 4 or 5 who were favorites to win. A large part of this thanks to the brand extension. Over on Smackdown; Chris Benoit, Kurt Angle, Big Show, John Cena, and RVD were favorites while over on Raw; the favorites were Goldberg, Booker T, Chris Jericho, and Kane. Of all of these favorites, the top 4 were narrowed down to Benoit, Goldberg, Angle, and Cena. Chris Benoit was #1 and Randy Orton came out at #2. Scott Steiner was #8 which would mark his last WWE match before his release. As the clock ran out for #11, the arena blackens and Undertaker's gong sounds to haunt Kane, warning him of his return. The omen distracts Kane long enough to allow Booker to eliminate him. #11 would end up being Spike Dudley who never made it to the match after being Chokeslammed on the ramp by Kane. Mick Foley returned at #21 to a nice pop from the crowd and went right after Orton (who along with Benoit dominated the Rumble up to that point). Foley ends up eliminating Orton and they beats the crap out of each other to the backstage area. Goldberg was #30 who within seconds of dominating the ring was blindsided with an F5 from Lesnar. Goldberg warns Lesnar he's next before getting eliminated by Kurt Angle. The final 2 come down to Benoit and Big Show and after lasting all the way through, Benoit throws Show over the top rope with a front facelock to win the 2004 Royal Rumble. Not only was Benoit the second longest lasting superstar in the Royal Rumble match (until 2006), he was the first superstar since Shawn Michaels at the 1995 Royal Rumble to enter at #1 and win the entire match. Benoit had been booked as the underdog all the way throughout leading up to the Rumble. With no one from Paul Heyman to people in the Smackdown locker room to Ric Flair believing that Benoit could win the big one, he proved his critics wrong and outlasted 29 other men from the beginning to win the Royal Rumble. Fantastic ending to a fairly great Royal Rumble match

Overall: The 2004 Royal Rumble was an overall solid PPV and a big improvement from the previous year's. For starters, all of the undercard matches with the exception of the World Heavyweight Championship match were kept short and simple which was for the best (Eddie vs Chavo could've been a bit longer though) to allow the Royal Rumble match to get all the time it needed. Benoit's official rise to main event status began here, but unfortunately due to the events of 2007, this moment has been erased and ignored in WWE history books. But you can relive this moment by either buying the DVD or watching it on the WWE Network. Overall, the 2004 Royal Rumble is one of the best Royal Rumble PPVs to ever happen",1422144000,,10246,5.0887432995830855
