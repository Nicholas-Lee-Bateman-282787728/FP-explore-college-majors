8181495,1,B0002VKZSY,"This DVD is very slow paced and I am by no means an exercise enthusiast, but this was a little too simple for me.  Perhaps if you are brand new to yoga or have never exercised, the simplicity of this yoga workout might be advantageous (any workout is better than no workout, right?), but otherwise it gets boring fast.  I'd opt for a different workout that can be modified for beginners but also provides more levels as your fitness level increases.",1296432000,,449,4.530864197530864
8181496,1,B0002VKZSY,"Having purchased and used yoga videos in the past, I would simply describe this CD as horrible!  The yoga practice is very brief and disjointed.  Most of the time on the CD is head shots of the two English ladies who host the CD and talk too much!  Less than impressed!  If I hadn't opened it, it would be returned!",1264896000,2,315,4.2
8181497,5,B0002VKZSY,"This is very gentle yoga that anyone can do during the pregnancy. It gives me a better posture, uplifts my mood and relaxes me. You will probably hate it if you like working hard, sweating or having sore muscles the day after. But if you are looking for relief in your pregnant body, you will love it.",1207612800,4,301,4.298245614035087
8181498,5,B0002VKZSY,"I DONT EXERCISE ALL THAT MUCH. just the ocassional walk. but i knew that my labor would be easier if i did. so i thought i'd try this. and i love it! it really stretches and works out my muscles (though it doesnt seem so at the time).also i'm usually a very light sleeper, but after i started using this i noticed i slept better and deeper. i highly recommend ""Simple Yoga For Pregnancy"" for anyone who, like me, doesnt exercise much or who has never really done yoga.",1170201600,11,468,4.269662921348314
8181499,4,B0002VKZSY,"I'm so glad I got this DVD for my wife. It has helped here in so many ways. I'm not sure what the other reviewer was talking about, but it definitely has been good for her. I'd highly recommend it to anyone on bedrest or not. I've bought quite a few DVDs from this company and have been satisfied with everyone. They have really good instructional dvds. Thanks!",1106265600,8,361,4.323529411764706
8181500,1,B0002VKZSY,"If you have ever done yoga before, this DVD is not for you.  The poses are very simple and will definitely not raise your heart rate.  It may be good for those women who are on bedrest.

With the exception of the relaxation portion of the program, there was very little to no background music.",1104019200,8,293,4.290909090909091
