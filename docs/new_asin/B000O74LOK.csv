8183133,5,B000O74LOK,"This appears to be the same 12 presentations as are in the DVD series ""Answers ... with Ken Ham"" which is currently being sold as a 12-DVD set, but this earlier 3-DVD set has four 29-minute presentations on each DVD.  I think it's the same presentations, but I have not seen the 12-DVD set so I cannot say with certainty.

The series was filmed as a series of live presentations in front of a large student audience at Cedarville College, a Baptist college in Cedarville, Ohio and the copyright date at the end of each presentation is 1999.
