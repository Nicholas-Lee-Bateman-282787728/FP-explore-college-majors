6583838,5,B00MJFQ2WO,"WoW...I'm a HUGE fan of Styx and simply LOVE this BluRay...it looks and sounds FANTASTIC.  Tommy Shaw's replacement does a GREAT Job singing and playing and Dennis DeYoung is AWESOME.  I LOVE this Concert...one of my favorites, and I have a collection of over 300...!",1414540800,,267,4.911111111111111
6583839,4,B00MJFQ2WO,The concert sounds allright. 4 stars might be a little generous.  I just listened to it this afternoon and for a two-channel stereo only release it probably sounds as good as you can find . It does not compare in sound quality to many of my 5.1 hd concert blu-rays that i own.  Allmost returned it without opening when i saw that had a stereo only soundtrack as the only option.  However I am going to epcot next week to see him live.,1414022400,6,434,4.204819277108434
6583840,5,B00MJFQ2WO,"I have seen Dennis DeYoung two times in the past two years, and Styx in between the Dennis concerts, and In my opinion Dennis with his current band blown the current Styx line-up away! The guitarist for Dennis's band, August Zadra, does an excellent job duplicating Tommy Shaw's vocals on songs such as Renegade, Two Much Time On My Hands, Blue Collar Man, and Crystal Ball. I am not saying he is better, but he does the songs justice. This Blu-Ray does an excellent job of showing how great the live performances are of Dennis and his Band. I love this Blu-Ray. Great HD quality and great sound. You can't go wrong with this purchase.",1414022400,11,635,4.530434782608696
6583841,5,B00MJFQ2WO,I was at the show with my buddy who handed him the album on stage. He even got them signed after the show. It was an amazing show worth the watch. Dennis is a really nice guy and an amazing performer he sounds just just as good as 20+ years ago.,1413504000,3,245,3.823529411764706
6583842,5,B00MJFQ2WO,"Fantastic, I has a back flash of my childhood when Dennis said before playing The best of Time ""remember your school days back in 1981"".",1480809600,,136,4.48
6583843,1,B00MJFQ2WO,"Ordered Blu-ray disc, It did not work on numerous machines. Now I have to deal with returning it. Is it worth it? Can I give it 0 stars?",1458604800,,136,3.892857142857143
6583844,5,B00MJFQ2WO,Absolutely great concert. Danny is fabulous and very comfortable on stage. The band he put together are very good. I love it.,1453593600,,125,4.7272727272727275

6583849,4,B00MJFQ2WO,"If this would have included some of the concert footage where Dennis DeYoung performamed with local symphonies in the last few years, I would have given it 5 starts. At least he played some of the classic Styx songs that the rest of the band neglected on their Young People's Symphony disc. Definitely worth owning if you are Styx fan and love the original ""voice of Styx"".",1435708800,4,373,4.582089552238806
6583850,5,B00MJFQ2WO,Suite Madame Blue... Serious Business folks!,1435276800,,44,6.5
6583851,5,B00MJFQ2WO,Excellent.  His voice still sounds great at 67.  I prefer his performances over what is Styx today.  Audio and video quality are excellent.,1433462400,3,139,4.956521739130435
6583852,5,B00MJFQ2WO,Dennis is still delivering an awesome performance and vocals. The band he has assembled together is every bit as magnificent as the original.,1433462400,,141,5.173913043478261
6583853,5,B00MJFQ2WO,This is a must buy if you are a Styx fan. He sounds just as good now as he did back in his hey day with the band. He plays to a small crowd and on a small stage is my only complaint.,1433116800,,182,3.255813953488372
6583854,3,B00MJFQ2WO,"Shot in Los Angeles in March 2014, this is a performance of the music of Styx except the song ""Desert Moon"", who is from DeYoung solo album. This is a faithful interpretation of the classic Styx songs, including the most progressive rock song ""Suite Madame Blue"" who is not played with the band Styx recently. Ironically, this song was overlook by records companies at the time it came out. Maybe it was not too radio friendly and a bit too long. It's quiet a shame that the band didn't make more songs of that nature, but then again Styx would have become another type of band. The music here gives you immediate fun and pleasure, accessible to a large audience. The members have fun on stage and the guitars players have haircut similar to the original Styx's members. It's almost like Styx!",1431302400,2,793,4.591549295774648
6583855,1,B00MJFQ2WO,Pathetic. Leaves little doubt as to why Tommy and James  split with him.,1431216000,,72,4.538461538461538
6583856,3,B00MJFQ2WO,Dennis' voice is as strong as ever and he still commands the stage.  Its a shame he had to bring in Tommy and JY look-alikes as opposed to just having a strong supporting band behind him.  Not a concert DVD I would watch over and over.,1427846400,2,235,4.086956521739131
6583857,5,B00MJFQ2WO,"Dennis DeYoung's unique, irreplaceable voice and brilliant arrangements have always been the magic behind classic Styx. Both are as strong as ever here. The band is astonishingly good. Everything sounds fresh and new with this hand-picked line-up, and they present some surprising new arrangements of a few of the classic tunes as well. The video is crisp and clear and the audio was mixed by Dennis himself. What's not to love? Highly recommended.",1427760000,,448,5.1506849315068495
6583858,5,B00MJFQ2WO,Exactly as described,1425427200,,20,6.0
6583859,4,B00MJFQ2WO,Good if you like Styx music ....  But not very original band ...,1421712000,,64,3.923076923076923
6583860,4,B00MJFQ2WO,"I'm a huge fan of Dennis, have all his published works, and see him in concert every chance I get.  But I have admit I was pretty disappointed that this blu-ray disk only has a 2 channel stereo mix.  The main reason I chose this over the standard DVD was that I wanted to hear the band in 5.1 surround.  The video quality is fantastic but I would have loved hearing this in 5.1 audio.  If you get an opportunity to see Dennis touring with this lineup I highly recommend it.  I hope and pray that he'll hit the studio and record new material with these guys.  Styx was my all time favorite band growing up and I'm longing for new material from Dennis.  And frankly I'm getting tired of the number of new live recordings from both Dennis and the band pretending to be Styx.  Please, please, please, record some new material.  Don't get me wrong, I love these old songs, always have, always will.",1421366400,3,893,4.331325301204819
6583861,5,B00MJFQ2WO,"Dennis is forever cheesy, and it's hilarious how much this band actually looks like Styx.  He's in full voice and the performance is strong.  I prefer this to the official Styx!",1420848000,,177,4.67741935483871
6583862,5,B00MJFQ2WO,So the show live at Mohegan Sun.  Outstanding!!!!!,1420761600,,50,5.25
6583863,5,B00MJFQ2WO,"This concert by Dennis DeYoung is excellent. From the song selection of classic Styx compositions and ""Desert Moon"", which is a song from the solo album of the same name, DeYoung's performances and enthusiasm inspire the band and crowd alike. DeYoung takes control of this show at its inception and doesn't let up until the very end and his voice is as clear and vibrant as on the original recordings. It's quite evident that he hasn't lost much, if anything, in the way of his vocal range. He also appears to be genuinely humble and appreciative of his fans and comes across as the kind of artist that you would truly enjoy meeting. Also, guitarist August Zadra sounds eerily like Tommy Shaw when he sings and you'll hear Shaw's compositions such as ""Blue Collar Man"", ""Crystal Ball"", ""Too Much Time On My Hands"", and others covered faithfully, flawlessly, and with a great deal of respect. There is no disappointment regarding the performances of any of these songs and, if you didn't know better, you would think that Shaw was appearing as a guest. Although this is a Blu-Ray disk, DeYoung did not take advantage of the 5.1 surround format so the only audio option is stereo, which is also the only disappointment. Even so, the sound and energy of the concert is stellar and the ears can be deceived by configuring the sound through the AV receiver such that it produces a faux surround environment. Therefore, I can't in good conscience give this concert less than five stars.",1420070400,8,1480,4.74031007751938

6583869,5,B00MJFQ2WO,"WOW!!! If you want a Night with Styx, get this Blu-ray, Dennis is 67 years old & sounds like he is 20-30 years old, I felt transported back to the 80's.  Dennis DeYoungs voice is... WOW!!!!  My Blu-ray came perfect, no sound issues, everything was as described.  Dennis put on a great show & you can see he truly enjoyed being there, not only that  he did not use a teleprompter for songs & he only had earplugs in not ""ears"", the man sang in a club wearing only earplugs that you buy in the store & he was spectacular!!!! he really engaged the crowd & the guitarist sang just like Tommy Shaw, You have to get this Blu-ray.",1418601600,5,623,4.2100840336134455
6583870,4,B00MJFQ2WO,I was at the concert.  It was great!  Bought the blue-ray and was a little upset that they cut one of my favorite songs; Return to Paradise.  Still a great concert and recommend it.  Dennis Deyoung still holds his voice.  His band sounds great and somewhat looks like Styx.,1417910400,2,273,4.489795918367347

6583872,5,B00MJFQ2WO,"I think it's natural for us to remember a band/group in a unique way of liking an iconic lead vocal, guitarist, drummer, keyboardist, bassist etc. So here I am, my long time favourite vocalist and an icon of Styx and I remember Styx because of Dennis.

I have the DVD ""Return To Paradise"" and I truly love it. I pre-order this BD without any hesitation because I know Dennis will not fail me. True enough, all the track has momentarily turned back the clock and I repeatedly playing it again and again and enjoy with my kids age 9 & 13 (they especially like ""Babe"" and ""The Best Of Time"").

The band is great and played at their best. Dennis at this age still rock like a fireball and sing so effortlessly. Excellence picture and audio quality. The audio is only a stereo and that's the catch because audiophile quality don't call for any surround feature!).

Highly recommended to put this BD in your library.",1416960000,,910,4.503030303030303
6583873,2,B00MJFQ2WO,"Sorry to burst any bubbles, but for a modern blu ray release a stereo mix, and a bad one at that, is unacceptable. Beyond the lack of a 5.1 mix, why is the stereo mix bad? The reason is simple, some of the guitars are virtually non-existant in the mix. When I see the guitarist moving his hands and there is virtually no sound, it's a bad mix. We are not even talking about being buried under another guitar, but when he is the only one playing the guitar is all but absent. I am a professional musician with over 30 years of live and studio experience and can tell you based upon that experience, this is a poor mix. Great video, excellent editing, Dennis DeYoung sounds fantastic and his choice of players (although the guitarists bare more than just a little resemblance to his JY and TS former bandmates) are top notch players. No question about the overall performance at all. Well done. The lack of a surround mix and poor stereo mix brings this one down a few notches for me.",1416873600,14,982,4.371584699453552

6583877,5,B00MJFQ2WO,"Great show,  took me a while to warm up to it. But once I sat back and listened it was great. I have always liked Dennis and of course Styx. Glad I purchased this DVD great songs and Dennis still has a great voice.",1416355200,,214,3.8636363636363638
6583878,5,B00MJFQ2WO,"This concert is simply breathtaking. He totally recreated the classic Styx of the seventies and eighties. The musicians are so great , matching Tommy Shaw or James Young. Both Styx is top notch bands and it seems only Dennis DeYoung and Tommy Shaw kept their voices as they were 30 years ago. Thanks Dennis for the music what you created  over your lifetime. You are the best!!!",1416009600,,378,4.641791044776119
6583879,5,B00MJFQ2WO,He sounds amazing - just can't believe it ...vocals are awesome ...and the band is having a great time. Yes it should have been produced in Dolby Surround ...but overall still sounds very good. Blu ray quality is solid. Setlist is fantastic!,1416009600,2,241,4.761904761904762

6583881,5,B00MJFQ2WO,"Despite not being able to bill himself as such, most fans will instantly recognize Dennis DeYoung as the voice of Styx since he wrote/co-wrote and sang all but one of the top 10 hits he contributed to the band he founded.

I was at the recording of the LA show, and I think the DVD is almost as good as being there.  Mr. DeYoung still sings all his songs in their original keys and at 67 still displays the energy, humor, and awe-inspiring showmanship his fans know him for when performing live.

In addition to being a superb guitarist, August Zadra provides vocals on the songs Tommy Shaw originally performed in Styx.  IMO, August has a better voice than Tommy, and I thought his performance during this show was energetic and flawless.

In addition to August's contribution to the show, Tom Sharpe on drums, John Blasucci on keyboards, Jimmy Leahey on guitar, Craig Carter on bass, and Mr. DeYoung's wife Suzanne on backing vocals all help make this show a must see for any ""classic lineup"" Styx fans.  Buy this, watch it to see what you're missing, and then go out and show your support for the music of Styx by seeing Dennis DeYoung and his band live.",1414972800,4,1157,4.538461538461538

8672781,5,B00MJFQ2WO,"Dennis DeYoung still has the pipes he had when he was young. I saw them live in 77, 78, 81 and 83 and I honestly didn't notice a drop in the quality of his voice in this performance. His range be a bit reduced, but the clarity and steadiness are still there. I wish I could have been there to see it live, still one of the best performers I have ever seen,",1528243200,,356,3.8904109589041096

8672788,5,B00MJFQ2WO,"This Blu-ray concert is phenomenal and I don't use a word like this lightly.  I would not categorize myself as a huge Styx fan.  I own one of their CD's and that's it.  I also saw them once in concert - Boston 1978.  But, I like many of their hits songs, have a lot of respect for Dennis as a singer/songwriter/performer and decided to get this following mostly positive reviews.  There was one review from a ""musician"" who said the mix was not very good.  A few others have complained about there only being a stereo audio option.  I own hundreds of concert dvd concerts and dozens of blu-ray concerts.  Live in Los Angeles ranks up there with the very best in every way - including audio.

The entire performance, song selection, musicianship, entertainment value, audio, video are all phenomenal.  I want to emphasize that the audio sound is excellent - all the instruments are clearly heard and distinct from one another.  I believe the mix is great.  Dennis sings and plays his heart out.  His vocals are spot on and hasn't lost a thing.  The 2 guitar players (and the one who sings Tommy Shaw's songs) are great.  The whole band is great.  I thoroughly enjoyed this and, most of all, I am really happy for Dennis in that he has a great band to play with despite the fall out with the guys in the official Styx band.

I agree with another reviewer who said Dennis' band out Styx's the ""official"" Styx.  It's true.  If both bands were playing on any given night in the same town, I would always put my money down to see Dennis' band over the other one (I also own Styx's Pieces of Eight/the Grand Illusion blu-ray).

Lastly, the video editing is as good at gets - no rapid changes where the camera can't stay still/in place for more than a second or two on any given performer; the camera angles change of course but remain in place for much longer periods of time than they do for most other concerts on dvd/blu-ray.  Whoever was in charge of shooting/editing the video - thank you for knowing how to properly shoot a concert video!  I wish all concerts would be shot this way where the cameras changes are much less frequent and don't have ADD.  The concert was very high on energy but the cameras, thankfully, were not.  See if you agree and buy this blu-ray.  Highly recommended.",1482883200,4,2287,4.466183574879227
