7344696,4,B012AN1GU2,"Strong independent film considering its budget was only two million (in comparison - Leo's new movie The Revenant cost $135 million to make.)
The Timber has a tiny budget and sometimes it shows but it packs a big punch.",1445817600,7,219,4.641025641025641
7344697,2,B012AN1GU2,"I really wanted to like this movie. I haven't seen a good western in ages and I guess I still haven't. Westerns must be a lost art from the days of John Wayne. I'm thinking that Josh Peck and James Ransone who play brothers did their best but there was no meat to this film. Josh and James are brothers who live together and the bank wants of foreclose on the house and property, they don't have the money but the banker says that if they capture and/or kill their criminal dad, they will be square. things happen on the search including tons of snow. It took a really long time to get to it and the ending was terribly unsatisfying.",1445817600,7,633,4.239669421487603
7344698,4,B012AN1GU2,"From the beginning scene, this movie is a brutal one, stating quite plainly that living in Alaska is a place making everyone at least a little mad, as the story shows. This is a stark and violent film no matter what any redeeming qualities. Some of the scenes may not be for the squeamish since they involve cannibalism, a woman being beaten, several knifings, a man being shot point-blank, and a man's hand being cut off.

Two brothers abandoned by their father as children decide as adults, to bring him to justice and use the rewards to pay off the mortgage on their ranch, which is currently buried under at least three feet of snow.  One wants to simply kill him, the other wishes to bring him in alive.  Various other characters have reasons for wanting the brothers not to succeed and perish in the effort and their one supporter is the local sheriff.

The entire story is shot in snow, knee-deep to a horse, falling in heavy flakes, slogging through it all, and one can almost feel the biting cold as one watches.
Though one of the opening scenes clearly states this takes place in Alaska, it apparently was made in Romania, with US, UK, and Romanian actors, so I suppose that qualifies it as an international effort.

The acting is good, though the dialogue is sparse with mostly scenes of slogging through snow, and fighting to stay alive.  Some of the acting is a little odd. A few of the characters have unusual voices and they appear to be ""declaiming"" rather than acting.  A good bit of their dialogue sound poetic, even Shakespearean in delivery as well as wordage. One good thing...with all that snow, at least it's a clear picture and easy to see.

All in all, it's a good movie, the scenery is stark but beautiful, but the slowness and slightly disjointed appearance may cause some to bow out before the finish. There's success and a kind of happy ending which is short and abrupt, but the main message seems to be that living in a hostile climate makes everyone, both men and women,as cruel as the land in which they live.

This movie was viewed as a rental DVD and no remuneration was involved in the writing of this review.",1468886400,,2144,4.548051948051948
7344699,3,B012AN1GU2,I wasn't expecting too much and so I wasn't very disappointed. It is a dark and cold movie. My main complaint is that it is a lot of work to follow the plot and sometimes the dreams and flashbacks aren't clear. The acting is good. My only other complaint is the plowed roads. They look very well groomed which doesn't flow with the remoteness of the movie setting.,1466812800,,364,4.367647058823529

8725751,1,B012AN1GU2,"So let me get this straight. You're a cowboy living in Alaska you go out into the wilderness after a wanted killer having only a knife, no guns. Everyone you meet along the way is bat crap crazy and you run into a cannibal. Shut up, just shut up! But hey, the scenery was really nice.",1516579200,,284,4.089285714285714
