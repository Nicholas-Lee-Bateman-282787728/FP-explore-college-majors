Cons:
  Audio volume is OK but no attempt to clean up background noise so some scenes are almost unbearable.
  No subtitles.
  No main menu so movie starts playing as soon as disc is inserted (one of my pet hates).
  No main menu so no chapters.
  Video is reasonable but obvious blemishes from age so not a great job on the restoration (if any was done at all).
  No extra material.
  Price - at $10 this release is certainly not value for money.

Pros:
  The anti-piracy message at the start is nice and sharp however why anyone would want to make copies of this over-priced lack-lustre release is beyond me.

I give this release 1 star and suggest potential punters try their luck with alternate releases.",1368662400,,959,5.534722222222222
