Granted it's poverty row (Monogram Pictures), so the production values are nothing special. But these little pictures have neat, trim plots that keep you guessing until the end, and they play fair with the viewer: no gimmicks. Most important, they star Boris Karloff in a change-of-pace role as the erudite antiquarian of Chinese art and literature turned detective. The role fit Karloff like a glove, for Mr. Wong was intelligent, thoughful, and well-read, with a sly sense of humor - very much as the actor himself was in real life. As a bonus, Karloff didn't have to spend tedious hours in the makeup department having monster makeup applied and removed. And he has a nice rapport with co-stars Grant Withers and Marjorie Reynolds as the irascible police captain and feisty, irrepressible news reporter, and all three play very well against each other. The print and sound quality of these pictures are good for their age, and probably derive from the same source as the earlier Alpha releases. As double features, they make an attractive package.",1241049600,,1141,5.010526315789473
