7360676,5,B013702RE6,"Artful film/camera work with a fine diversity of owners and trainers sharing their real life experiences with the Rotty.  Candid and insightful assessment of the responsibilities and challenges this primarily working breed brings and demands of its owner.  In spite of the author's and participants' loving bias towards the Rotty the film provides a realistic description of the breed as a family member and working companion infused with exceptional traits of loyalty, courage, drive, intelligence, versatility, affection, physical power,  and an inherent gentle demeanor.  This film is  both instructive as well as highly entertaining.  Youngsters in particular should find this film a joy to watch..",1461283200,2,702,5.6380952380952385

8727016,5,B013702RE6,"I had a Rottweiler for 10 years an she was the sweetest dog I have ever had the pleasure of knowing. I find how the mainstream media and Hollywood have portrayed them over the years to be despicable. They absolutely do not deserve the reputation they have as a ""dangerous breed"". It saddens me to see how easily people are manipulated into believing everything they hear/see. So happy to see them portrayed so positively as they should be.",1505260800,,439,4.641025641025641
8727017,4,B013702RE6,"Rottweiler owners will like this movie.  It just reaffirms what we already know about our favorite breed. It would be a great video for first time Rottie owners before they get a dog, and also for those who have been misinformed about the breed. I felt the agility training segment was longer than necessary. The part where the guy was explaining about agility training kinda droned on longer than it should've. But, everything about this movie is what we Rottweiler fans have always known: this breed has far more personality than they've been given credit for.",1499472000,,562,4.854166666666667

8727019,5,B013702RE6,"I absolutely loved this movie. I have my first Rottweiler and he has been nothing but a love bug who is extremely hard working. This past year I have been through so much and having him by my side really just makes my life so much better. I had learned many things in this movie that I did not know about this breed and all of which they are capable of. I wish it were longer! I do recommend this video if not for the beautiful Rotties shown in
the movie but for the knowledge you'll gain on just how much they can do!",1483574400,,518,3.9903846153846154
8727020,5,B013702RE6,"I think it gives a great representation of the breed! It goes through many of the great attributes of the dog, but also gives the type of lifestyle and training the Rottweiler needs.",1483574400,,182,4.545454545454546
