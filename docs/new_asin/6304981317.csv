7880427,5,6304981317,"Perhaps the greatst ufo videos ever made. This filmmaker goes where other filmmakers never go. The pursuit of truth takes this filmmaker from the Usa to scandinavia to russia and everywhere inbetween. He takes on the mysteries of ghosts,multidimensions, and possessions,ufos,aliens,government conspiracies,time travel, as well as reincarnation,shammans,and all sorts of pyschic phenomena,he covers all these topics and many more with a fresh and new approach that is honest and forthright. He doesn't allow politics,established science,or religion stand in his way. There are many highly eduacated and artistically gifted individuals on this dvd set,that get a chance to share there stories and experiences without having to be filtered by the highly controlled and censored mainstream media. This has to be one of the most enlightening films ever produced. This one is a must see. It is full of esoteric knowledge and cosmic secrets. This DVD collection may be just the tip of the ice berg,but what and enriching tip it is. This may be the best source of knowledge out there right now,until the freemasons and the blue midgets start talking anyway. Live long and prospere and live again and again and maybe make a spacefriend who is also gay and sexy!!!",1060300800,,1254,5.243781094527363
7880428,3,6304981317,"If you're interested in UFOlogy then, there are definetely better videos out there than these. There is another 'Madacy' 5-pack called ""Aliens: the complete truth"" (It is another modestly priced 5-pack). This title is the most comprehensive one that I've seen and is very, very interesting and nicely edited. Full of factual events and scientific speculation, whereas ""UFO and Paranormal Phenomena"" is full of vague interviews with people who look like they are reading off of cue cards and it really is poorly edited.
Even though the 5-pack only cost $34.99 +tax it isn't worth the price of the stupid uninformative interviews that you have to fast forward through to get to an interview of someone who actually sounds like they know what they're talking about. It does have some nice interviews with HUFON founder Derrel Sims and Nuclear Physicist Stanton Friedman, but even that can't save this collection from the terrible editing. While watching this set of DVD's you really learn to appreciate what lower budget videos like this go through when the person producing them actually seems to care about the subject matter and takes the time to get interesting cut scenes and a descent soundtrack to go along with the video, instead of tons of cut scenes of totally unrelated material and shots of him and the other people involved in making the series doing basically nothing. And that wouldn't be so distracting if they wouldn't do it during the good interviews. It's so mind boggling that the producer 'Juhann af Grann' would rather show you himself holding a prop camera or a shot of him wearing goofy sunglasses instead of promoting the material (It's like a Deiter skit from Saturday Night Live, but it's not funny at all).
All in all, there is really no new material here that's presented in a descent way or warrants any of your attention or money, (All of my friends really liked the boxed set of 'Aliens: the complete truth', but I'm afraid to even let them see this one because it's soo badly presented that it might cause them to question the ideas presented).
I felt ripped off after seeing the first two videos and they're all produced by the same guy, which means I can only be in store for even more disappointment. Please, save yourself the agony and get something else.
P.S.- the three stars are only for the Stanton Friedman and Darrell Sims interviews. Everything else is just filler.",970531200,21,2406,4.828087167070218
