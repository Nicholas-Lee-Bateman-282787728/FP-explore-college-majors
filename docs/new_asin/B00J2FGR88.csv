Classic in the sense that it's not a gory film but relies on building a spooky,  atmospheric and claustrophobic world. It can be a little talky at times but it builds up to something good. It's basically 3 woman who spend a weekend in cabin when one of them makes a stupid mistake while drunk that leads to dread and horror coming at their front door. File it under classic Satanic cult horror movie.",1473811200,,497,4.461538461538462
