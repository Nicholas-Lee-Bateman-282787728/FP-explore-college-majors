8316370,5,B001KWHXIY,"Janette Oke's ""Love Comes Softly"" series is a wonderful series, but surprisingly, I'm going to suggest that you not purchase this particular package. Instead of paying more than ten dollars for three movies, you can get all ten movies for less.

. . . . . LOVE COMES SOFTLY - 10th Anniversary Collection

I got the ten-movie set in yesterday's mail, and I'm already up to the fifth movie.

Things started out rough on the prairies in the 19th century. Marty, recently widowed, meets Clark, also widowed but with a young daughter, and they agree to what we would now call a ""marriage of convenience,"" a platonic friendship. Their friendship grows. They learn to love each other, and even the daughter comes around.

There is so much more in these movies, and they are well worth your time. If you are like me, you will watch these again and again. I'm donating my set to the local library so that others can enjoy them, but I will borrow them back at least every year or two.",1428192000,,974,4.517045454545454

Good acting and the stories always leaves you with a good up-lifting, and positive feeling.  The people in the stories were hard workers, honest and content with the little they had.  Kids were grateful and appreciative with material things that was given to them, and people appreciated a good work ethic and love for God and family.  Wonderful stories and I highly recommend them.",1239926400,3,473,4.8625
