5374443,5,B00A04YHFU,"The Cyclist begins with the main character, Nash, nearly destitute and attempting to reconcile the disarray of his current life situation. He has lost his job, his apartment and the love of his life.  His only possession of value, his bicycle, is wrecked and ruined, as is his motivation and self-esteem.  Nash turns to his lifelong friend, Jack, for assistance and direction. As the two friends reconnect they are reminded of their shared passion for amateur cycling and their reasoning for abandoning the sport they loved.  As only best friends can they coax and challenge one another to ride again. From there, the film continues on a spectacular journey of team cycling, friendship, rivalry, love, grief, strength and resolution

The Cyclist is not a film you merely watch, it is a film you experience. Through breathtaking scenery, remarkable cinematography and a beautiful musical score, I was thoroughly entertained, impressed and inspired. Though unseasoned to the sport, I found myself mesmerized by the cycling. I felt the thrill of the race; I reveled in the glorious sensation of overtaking a competitor and the exhilaration of crossing the finish line.  The characters were impressive, their dialogue meaningful.  I enjoyed them on their bikes but appreciated them even more when they were off.  I laughed with them. I felt their pain and cried with them as they faced despair.

The Cyclist is obviously a film about cycling; it is about setting goals and achieving dreams.  The Cyclist is also about overcoming adversity.  It is a valiant film with a strong, positive message.  Above all else, this is what I appreciated most about the movie.  Winding through this excellent film is a message of perseverance and determination.  It champions the individual human spirit, but also asserts the importance of positive influence and relationships in our lives. It is a wonderful family film, appropriate for all ages and guaranteed to delight!",1362441600,3,1953,5.1424050632911396
5374444,5,B00A04YHFU,The scenary was beautiful and I really felt like it protrayed the real world of amateur cycling without overdoing the message.  There's an intensity; mentally and physically that was well captured.  Absolutely loved the camping scenes as well!  That brought levity to the story which makes me want to watch it again.,1362268800,,316,5.038461538461538
5374445,1,B00A04YHFU,"This movie is painfully bad.  It's a poor story with weak acting.  I would suggest you not waste you money on this one, even if you are a cycling nut.",1362182400,,150,3.966666666666667
5374446,4,B00A04YHFU,"Pretty good movie for anyone.  If you are a cyclist you will definitely like it though it isn't great, it is good and well paced so it need not be longer than the 90 minutes it is.  SPOILER ALERT- some details contain plot line information you may not wish to know ahead of time.

Most movies about cycling seem to find the need to add in some life or death like conflict.  In American Flyers, Kevin Costner's character had cancer.  In the recent Premium Rush there were life and death in a couple of ways, in Quicksilver Kevin Bacon's character had a show down with a bad guy.  Why?  Why the need to make it life or death?

I think cyclists find cycling more alluring, addictive and important to them than seems warranted by other people.  Why should grown ups find it so important to ride a bike?  I think these movies generally try and get that feeling across by including these life/death decisions mixed up in the movies about cycling.  Cycling is very important though it usually isn't life or death.  It is more about passion, and life itself.

Breaking Away was a departure from this cliched cycling plot and possibly the best of cycling movies for it.  I wish more cycling movies would do that.

This movie follows the normal cliche however.  The main character's best lifelong friend, once a cycling champion, gets back to riding despite his woman's displeasure, and of course dies in a finish line crash at the end of a local race.  Nash, the main character, is  working as a bike messenger and 'wasting' his life, losing his girl etc. etc.  His friend dies after following him back into cycling, his best girl is back in town without telling him and her mother is dying of cancer.  He rights it all, after some soul searching, and tribulations just like you expect.  Some lucky insight and guidance from strangers, and unexpected help from his arch nemesis in the local cycling scene puts him back on the path of making good on his cycling ambitions. One year later he wins the race his friend died in, gets the girl back, makes peace with his demons etc.  It really is done in better style than it sounds from my description.  I am leaving out enough detail it will entertain you with the little flourishes and detail used in making the movie.

So a well done, well shot, well acted, well cast cliched cycling movie.  A good movie still, and not bad even for non-cyclists I think.",1361664000,,2393,4.522144522144522
5374447,5,B00A04YHFU,"I liked this film a lot. It centers on two friends, Nash and Jack, who used to compete in amateur cycling races, but who have been out of the game for the last two years. The Cyclist details their journey to start competing again.

A reporter in the film makes the point that so much has undermined professional cycling lately, that the real story is in the amateur cycling, because those are the unsung heroes who are putting their lives into the sport. I'd agree that this movie succeeds at telling an interesting story about the real people who spend half of their lives riding and the other half of their lives in the local bike shop. I liked The Cyclist for a lot of the same reasons I liked&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Word-Wars/dp/B0007LPSG8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Word Wars</a>, the story of a Scrabble competition. Like that film, this movie delves into a very interesting subculture that everyone's aware of but few really fully understand the intensity of.

The acting is great in this film, but some of the dialog is a bit weak, especially in some of the more emotional scenes. The romance in the film was fun, too.

I also really liked all of the cool scenery and biking shots in the film. The film spends a lot of time on scenery and racing shots, but I thought they fit in well with the movie.

I'd recommend this movie to everyone who loves biking and to everyone who likes independent films.

Pros:
+Tells the story of amateur cycling competitions
+A lot of beautiful Utah scenery, filmed in Moab, Park City, and Salt Lake city
+Good story
+Good acting
+Fun independent film
+Lots of cool racing bikes in the film

Cons:
-Some of the angry emotional dialog got too angry, too fast, so I thought the writing of some of the emotional scenes could have been done a little better",1361318400,,1843,4.8164556962025316
5374448,5,B00A04YHFU,"It is nice to see a movie that shares the ""real"" emotion of people, the ups and the downs, and yet at the same time still inspires you.  The Cyclist does this very thing.  It is the perfect length at 90 minutes and will keep your attention throughout.  I am glad that we saw this one!",1361232000,,284,4.035714285714286
5374449,5,B00A04YHFU,To me this film was the perfect mix of good cycling action and a good story line.  The theme dealt with why cyclists enjoy cycling and how to relate that enjoyment to non-cyclists without taking yourself too seriously. I also enjoyed that this was a relatively clean movie that I can watch with my family.,1381449600,,305,4.545454545454546
5374450,4,B00A04YHFU,"I liked it...  Entertaining, but not ""great"".  Seems similar in many ways to American Flyers (maybe b/c both revolve around cycling, but I'm a cyclist and certain themes in the storyline seem familiar even to me)...  The acting was excellent...",1369699200,,244,5.05
5374451,5,B00A04YHFU,The scenery and the story are great.  The Cyclist offers challenge and adventure and hope.  This is NOT a chick-flick .... the cycling is thrilling and guys will like this film every bit as much as women!,1368144000,,204,4.486486486486487
5374452,2,B00A04YHFU,I was pretty excited to see a movie about cycling show up. I was quickly disappointed though after I started watching it. Everything is so over dramatized and it just seemed so fake. I could not even finish watching it. Oh well.,1366329600,,228,4.4523809523809526
5374453,1,B00A04YHFU,horrendous acting and almost made me blush it was so bad.  I want my money back and the 90 minutes it took to watch,1365120000,,115,3.7916666666666665
5374454,1,B00A04YHFU,"Bad acting. Scenery was wasted on this movie with it's horrible plot and editing. Couldn't decide what continent I was on. Whoever scripted this, arranged for property didn't get it right. Wasted my money on this one.",1365120000,,217,4.891891891891892
5374455,5,B00A04YHFU,"Anyone who enjoys cycling will love this movie. It's got a great story line and is very well done. If you like independent films and like bikes, this movie is for you.",1364256000,,167,4.25
5374456,5,B00A04YHFU,"A must see movie......Good story.  KC Clyde does a great job. A movie I would watch again, it is surely a five star movie.",1364083200,,122,4.083333333333333

8545848,4,B00A04YHFU,Good movie! Funny but take you to the world of the cycling niche of serious competition.  I can relate to the world of cycling myself very expensive sport and can be dangerious at times.,1420156800,,186,4.470588235294118

8545851,1,B00A04YHFU,"Poorly written script, and I have never seen a lead character be such a loser.  Instead of rooting for him, I wished he would just go away.  ""Nacho"" was the only redeeming part of the film/script.  With the exception of bikes, and some beautiful riding scenes, this film was a waste of time.",1417219200,,291,4.452830188679245
8545852,5,B00A04YHFU,Very good film not saying this just because I'm in it myself but it was well written directed etc great bunch of actors and actresses etc,1408579200,,137,4.3076923076923075

8545854,2,B00A04YHFU,"This might be the worst cycling movie made. It had bikes so there is a star, and pretty scenery in Utah which gives it another star. The acting however, was laughable it was so bad. Buy Rising from the Ashes, that is a great cycling movie.",1398470400,,239,4.217391304347826
