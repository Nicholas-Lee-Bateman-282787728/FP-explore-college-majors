5162960,5,B008H6GHII,"FINALLY!! It's happening what so many 'Angels"" fans wanted for so long! yes ""Angelettes"" the DVD box set is being released, this IS reality not an ""Angels Fanatical dream"".  It may mean having season 1-4 doubled up on, BUT the benefit to that is this, we all lost hope to some degree that s5 was NOT being released especially after the re-boot didn't succeed on tv in 2011. However, Sony put the joke on us, because s5 will be included in the box set. So basically that makes buying the dvd set alone worth buying it and having a 2nd copy of s1-4 in your collection, or if you don't have any of the seasons then you just bought yourself a little piece of tv history! I'm buying this for DAMN SURE...just for s5! Because i have s1-s4 but hell s5 was my fav cast...MY GOD THANK YOU SONY FOR ANSWERING ANGEL FANS PRAYERS EVERYWHERE! For the box set...but most importantly, for finally giving us s5!",1342828800,5,895,4.391566265060241

5162982,5,B008H6GHII,"Charlie's Angels:The Complete Series contains all five seasons of the crime drama television series about three women who work for a private investigation agency, and is one of the first shows to showcase women in roles traditionally reserved for men. The series stars Kate Jackson; Farrah Fawcett-Majors; Jaclyn Smith; Cheryl Ladd; Shelley Hack; Tanya Roberts; David Doyle; and John Forsythe as the voice of Charles Townsend, also known as ""Charlie"". The series was broadcast in the USA on the ABC Television Network from 1976 to 1981 and was one of the most successful series of the 1970s.

Three women, the Angels graduated from the Los Angeles police academy only to be assigned such duties as handling switchboards and directing traffic. They quit and were hired to work for the Charles Townsend Agency as private investigators. Their boss, Charlie is never seen full face. He assigns cases to the Angels and his liaison, Bosley via a speaker phone. Fawcett-Majors and Jackson eventually left the series during its run. Fawcett-Majors was replaced by Cheryl Ladd in the second season. While Jackson was replaced by Shelley Hack. In the final season, Tanya Roberts replaced Hack in the fourth season.

Like other American TV crime shows of the 1970s, Charlie's Angels was generally formatted in the way of a procedural drama. Most episodes followed a regular structure whereby a crime is committed, the Angels are given the case details by Charlie and Bosley at the Townsend office and the trio go undercover. Towards the end of the episode one of them is uncovered and it is a race against time for the others to rescue their friend before they meet some horrible fate. Inevitably, the final scene would be back at the Townsend office with Charlie offering his congratulations for a job well done.

This was one of the most popular shows in the 70's as it was the first show to feature women in police work. Also,it was a delight to the male viewers as they have the sexy stars in skimpy clothes and bathing suit. Some have considered it sexist in a way that it was its primary feature to gain viewers but it was part of the so-called Jiggle TV era of the 70's. Also,it presented good stories despite being dated at present times. Overall,it was one best shows ever created.",1427932800,2,2279,4.838461538461538

Yes it was worth the pride but had I known it was so cheaply thrown together as it was. Stacked DVD on top of DVD. That was very stupid.

5163074,4,B008H6GHII,It's is a fair price for the entire series collection of Charlie's Angels. My only disappointment was the packaging of the disks. They are all just stacked upon each other in the box and held in place with a cheap piece of cardboard. Not a good way to keep the disks for archive purposes. Might need to repackage the disks somehow with a homemade remedy.,1408924800,,354,4.461538461538462

5163077,5,B008H6GHII,"I missed this series when first on TV.  Thoroughly enjoyed having and watching the DVDs at my own convenience.  Not so complicated in plot that I cannot cook or do paperwork or simple tasks while the show is on.  And the level of ""violence"" is VERY far below that of many current popular detective series (like Criminal Minds, CSI series, Flashpoint).  Love mysteries, but I do not appreciate the extreme violence seen in so many today;  I think seeing so much violence can make a person too immune to the horrors of brutality.",1407196800,,527,4.623655913978495

5163108,5,B008H6GHII,"I had purchased Seasons 1 thru 4. Actually haven't opened 3 & 4 yet, taking my time!  Did not realize that Season % was even available for sale when I purchased the 4 about 1 1/2yrs ago. I almost purchased Season 5, but saw that it cost as much as if I were to purchase the entire Season 1-5.  Well, that was a no-brainer; I can always re-sale the individual seasons or just keep them(hell they are paid for-right-and they are the ANGELS!!)  When I was 13yrs old., I went to a Catholic School on Pico Blvd down the street from 20th Century Studios.  Charlie's Angels used to use the church for the filming.  I had the pleasure of meeting the original # Angels & getting their autographs.  What a thrill for a 13yr old boy!!

5163109,5,B008H6GHII,I love all of my angels from the original three to the last three. Each Season has its own hit or misses since that is pretty much in the eye of the beholder as to what you enjoy. The DVDS come stacked but not a big issue for the price and quality on all the ones ive watched so far are great.. Looking back you realize even more so how beautiful these women were and are.. Absolute Stunners..and you always believed they could do their jobs never thought once they couldn't .,1402099200,,476,4.184782608695652

5163121,5,B008H6GHII,I grew up with this show and was so excited to see the complete series in a set. The price is unbelievably great! Thanks for helping me relive one of the best parts of my childhood,1401321600,,180,4.027777777777778
5163122,4,B008H6GHII,"As most of us know, Charlie's Angels was one of the more television shows of the late seventies. Like the majority, I had already purchased Seasons One through Four in their respective DVD sets, but was desperately waiting for the release of Season Five. It seems that this series was almost always in the headlines back in its heyday for some reason or another: the cast changes, writing staff changes, and, of course, the publicity surrounding the three beautiful females at the center.

Season One was undoubtedly the peak of Charlie's Angels. The best episodes, the best set of Angels, the best acting, so on and so forth. The three original Angels, Kate Jackson, Farrah Fawcett-Majors, and Jaclyn Smith, are very believable as best friends and have a great sense of chemistry. Season Two continues with great stories, even without Fawcett-Majors, who had emerged as the show's breakout star. Season Two starter Cheryl Ladd is a welcomed addition as Fawcett-Majors's little sister. Season Two is, in my opinion only, the only season that can compare to the magic of the initial season.

Season Three is where the problems begin for me. Most reviews online for this season have been fare, but I am not am personally a little weary at some of these episodes. The writing seems to have taken a nosedive, with weaker scripts and more emphasis on fluff than drama. The off-screen battles between Kate Jackson and Cheryl Ladd are increasingly noticeable, with several episodes limiting their screen time together. Season Four introduces yet another Angel. This time it is Kate Jackson who leaves, and it is Shelley Hack who replaces her. Hack seems to have been a mistake from the start. Her character seems to be hopelessly undeveloped; and it seems as if she was fitted in to script written prior to her casting. Some of the season's earliest episodes have her in a minor role, although some later episodes give her a chance to stand out. The chemistry is gone with Season Four. Season Five does not help matters. Shelley Hack is gone now, and Tanya Roberts come aboard. Roberts, although a beautiful woman, also seems to be a mistake. Her acting abilities are slim, to say the least, but she seems to be a better fit than Shelley Hack had been. Season Five is simply horrible. Many of the episode are just plain boring, excluding a few. The finale episode will disappoint most. It is merely a clip show with a reworked plot from Season One. The Angels seem tired, and it was probably for the best that the series went off the air after five years.

To sum it up, Charlie's Angels is not great Shakespeare, but it's not John Waters garbage. The emphasis on the women's curves over their acting is noticeable, and some episode barely have plots, but this is still a great show that will continue to have a loyal fan base. As for the Box Set, the artwork is great and the description on the back it pleasing, but the main problem is the packaging of the discs in two plastic black spirals. Still, this is worth it due to the low price.",1401062400,,3033,4.686679174484053
5163123,5,B008H6GHII,"Relive all of the fun!!! Makes great gifts for a new generation of Angel's Fans! You get to see all episodes including some of the non or rarely rerun season 4 and 5. Tanya Roberts, and Shelley Hack deserve more credit than they got at the time. Sit back, Relax, and go back in time",1400457600,,282,4.1454545454545455
5163124,5,B008H6GHII,We have not reached the end of the second season yet. It's so much fun to see them over and over and not to have to wait for them to show up on TV. I'm really glad I got them.,1399939200,,175,3.4
5163125,4,B008H6GHII,"The DVD quality and delivery were excellent. The only disappointment was with the DVD case/holder. The seasons are all group together on two spindles, so you have to go thru all the DVD's if you want to skip around. And because the two holders are just ""gummed"" to the box I dislodged them upon opening the box. Still happy to have all five seasons finally.",1398556800,,357,4.507692307692308
5163126,1,B008H6GHII,The video quality is very poor. Only a frame width and height of 740/540 with a data rate of only 1491 and total bitrate of 1619. I had watched the replay of Charlie's Angels on TNT HD channel on my TV and it was excellent quality. Sony put out a cheap product in this box series. It was a waste of my money and time.,1398470400,,317,3.8923076923076922
5163127,5,B008H6GHII,I loved the TV series.  Tv shows now have way too many commercials and not the 50 minutes of good TV programming.,1397692800,,113,4.136363636363637

5163129,5,B008H6GHII,This is one of my favorite television series from the 70's. It has some pretty good mystery and I love how the angels figure out the clues and slowly finding the culprits behind each case. One of the best boxsets I have purchased!,1394323200,2,230,4.372093023255814
5163130,5,B008H6GHII,The series is just great fun and everybody who remembers it knows that and for those who don't it's got three lovely ladies in peril every week which makes it easy on the eyes and the stories are always entertaining.  But the packaging sucks.  The entire series is split in two stacks of DVD's that are unceremoniously dumped on two spindles and held in place with a piece of cardboard.  If Charlie knew about this he'd send the Angels to kick whoever's hiney is responsible!!!!  So be warned.  But it is cheap and complete (I'd check them all on receiving them to be sure they're all there and in order and not scratched) so there's that at least.  I'd have some other covers ready to transfer the disks too if I were you but if you want the whole series at an affordable price here it is.,1394150400,2,790,4.340136054421769
5163166,5,B008H6GHII,My mom wanted it and she is too freaking cute to deny so I got it for her. She spends her days off reliving the glory days of this franchise. Though she was only a child when it came out.,1393113600,,187,3.7

5163168,5,B008H6GHII,"I think I was really proactive buying season's 1 through 4 of the series the past decade and the complete series is reasonable too and from what I heard and hinted of the Mill Creek offering of season 1, I think that the complete series by Sony Home Entertainment is far more superior than Mill Creek's season 1.  I'm lucky to have the complete series as well because I now have all five seasons of the series.",1390608000,,410,4.324675324675325
5163169,5,B008H6GHII,"I'm SOOO glad I purchased this for only $32.99 last year (2014)!!!  After reading all the negative reviews here, I was hesitant to purchase Charlie's Angels The Complete Series.  I am glad I did, too.  I found the box set to be complete and exactly what I wanted.  Yes, the DVDs were on 2 separate spindle, secured in place with a cardboard top, yet they were stacked neatly and in order of the season, so it was a breeze to transfer them in order into my DVD case.  There is also a nice reference card noting the season, the disc, and the episode (which fits nicely in the DVD case for reference).  The foldable double box inside the outer box folds apart with a montage of scenes from Charlie's Angels on the inside.  For this price, I found this to be an EXCELLENT deal.  If you want a detailed description of each episode, you can always go online and look it up.  There are several websites that cater specifically to big Charlie's Angels fans.  This compilation is great.  As long as I have the season, disc, and episode title, I am happy.  So, disregard all these negative reviews-they were submitted obviously by people who are just way too picky and are misers looking for the best at a reduced price.  If you are a Charlie's Angels fan, GET THIS!  Do like I did and transfer all the discs to a DVD case where you have ease of access, as well as access to the included index of season/disc/episode.  I give it 5 stars for the prismatic/holographic paper that lines the inside of the case alone!  This would make the PERFECT gift for ANY Charlie's Angels fan.

Still high but at least manageable.  **UPDATED REVIEW:  02-28-15 : I still consider this a very nice set &  complete perfect transfers of the original T.V. series, but : WOW:  This set must be in low quantity for it to be going for close to $600.00.  When I purchased mine, I'am sure it was under $100.00.  If it ever gets up to a $1000.00 I may consider reselling mine, but for now mine is not up for resale. I like it too much.  Hopefully, this set will be re-issued to bring down the price.*****  **ORIGINAL REVIEW WHEN THE PRICE WAS RIGHT  12-26-13:  Perfect transfers of this Complete Original Series with a nice price and nice box packaging for fans of the Original Series.**",1388016000,,834,4.516778523489933

5163175,4,B008H6GHII,Love this series and I am so happy it is out in a one box set. I know there are those who complain about the packaging but really it's not as bad as people are saying. The cardboard inserts are a bit flimsy but they do the job of keeping the discs in place. My bigger problem was that the backing of the disc holder separated from the box but a little super glue and it's now perfect. The video quality is wonderful and the sound is perfect!,1386028800,,441,4.0227272727272725
5163196,4,B008H6GHII,"Has them all. And I thought I had seen all the episodes only to realize I never did. What a treat to be able to see something for the first time from this series after all of these years. Made it more than just a memory walk. Anyway, I won't comment on the series as I have in other reviews on individual seasons. But I agree with the other reviews in that the package was a little disappointing. There are these cheap flimsy trays that two seasons of DVDs stack on top of each other as you force them down over a pole in the center of the tray. The pole fits through the center hole of the DVD. The problem is the DVDs scrap against the cheap plastic like fingernails over a chalkboard. And you feel like you are going to break the DVDs as you have to continuously force them off and on the pole tray. The tray itself appears as if it cannot support the weight of the DVD stack and might easily tear leaving you with loose DVDs to worry about. The sturdy cardboard encasing for the DVD trays is first rate. Good design. But the trays just sit there  inside loosely. They are not attached to the envelope. Anyway there are no behind the scenes stuff on these DVDs either. You would think after all of these years you would see some bloopers or something. Nothing.",1384041600,,1263,4.240663900414938

5163198,5,B008H6GHII,"I'm giving this 5 stars because you simply can't beat getting all 5 seasons of quality DVDs for only $25. The menus and menu graphics are a little simple and basic, but who cares, you're buying these to watch the TV shows not stare at the menu all day.  The shows have the same film quality that existed when they aired for the first time, which certainly isn't the HD most people are used to these days, but I'm guessing those buying this set know what to expect.  I personally like the quality, it's what gives these '70's TV shows some of their appeal (or maybe that's just me).  Regardless, the quality is no worse then what was first aired, so there's nothing to complain about there.

However, the packaging leaves a lot to be desired: all the other reviewers are right when saying the packaging is bad.  All 5-seasons-worth of DVDs are stacked on top of one another, divided into two stacks on two blow-molded plastic spindles which are glued to either side of the bi-fold opening box (both of my 'spindles' had come loose of their glue and were tweaked around inside the box, but no damage to the discs or anything).  No plastic or paper separator protection between discs, so they're free to rub on one another.  I didn't find any noticeable scratches from this (which would be circular-ish scratches since they'd spin on one another), but I do have three discs with scratches that more or less radiate out from the center, caused from who knows what; hopefully they won't skip.  Like one reviewer said, the cardboard ""holder"" that fits on top of the spindle to keep the discs in place when you close the box will work about twice before becoming too loose to work.  Rather than listing the discs and their episodes on the box, there is a one-page insert that lists what episodes are on what disc (this is pretty convenient, actually).  I went ahead and bought these because I have a 400 disc player that I load all my DVD's into and just toss out whatever packaging I get. However for those that need/want the packaging you'll need to doctor up this packaging to work or find another solution for all the discs.  Packaging may be poor, but you simply can't beat the price.",1383091200,,2182,4.540816326530612

5163221,3,B008H6GHII,"I am wondering why so many comments about the packaging of the product.  Like many people, the packaging is discarded by me as packaging from the factory takes up way too much storage space.  This is not the Gutenberg Bible, people.

Charlie's Angels featured the most beautiful women ever to be seen on broadcast TV, from Jaclyn Smith to Farrah Fawcett, with the superhot Cheryl Ladd and Tanya Roberts as added attractions.

All of the shows had just enough plot, just enough humor, and just enough drama to carry your attention thru an hour long program.  The Angels were not only beautiful but endearing, at least a little bit.  Unlike beauties like Bo Derek and Pamela Anderson, Jacky Smith and Farrah seemed to be genuinely nice and human.

The show parallelled Mission Impossible insofar as there was a leader on tape or phone, not appearing, using a collection of actors[i.e. the 'Angels'] to examine a problem and solve it using their leader's directions, but with a bit of their own improvisation.

One final word: if you never saw the TV series, you might be surprised that it was so, umm, modest.  Even for TV standards, the series now could be rated PG, even G.  It was extremely conservative in that way, far less ribald than, say, Married with Children...",1374537600,,1269,4.7534246575342465

So you get the 70s clothes and free sex attitude for the first 2 seasons. Then you can see the hairstyles change as well as the attitude toward sex.

5163238,5,B008H6GHII,"So here's the deal, I bought this set for $37. Was I surprised that the inside packaging was crappy, yes, but it was $37. The show is not streaming on Netflix, and I really wanted to watch this series. I saw a lot of episodes growing up, but never in the right order because it was already syndicated by then and this was before VCR+ was around. Fun show, typical of the late 70's and early 80's. They tried to remake it and I prefer the original series. The complaints about this have mainly been packaging, and maybe back in 2010 when this was released it would irritate the people who bought 1-4 prior and could not get 5 without waiting, but if you are like me who doesn't/didn't own any of the seasons individually, this is a great way to get them.

5163244,5,B008H6GHII,"Everything other reviewers have said about this box set's packaging is the truth: there are two spindles that hold all of the discs in place, ""locked"" by two cardboard fixtures that you place over the spindles. Having said that, this arrangement is much better than the Marilyn Monroe box set, where the dics are forever slipping and sliding out of their cardboard envelopes, and so, arriving scratched. I bought both at the same time. The Marilyn set has several scratched discs that won't play, freeze up, etc. Charlie's Angels had one out of the 27 which was defective and I get the idea it was due to the pressing, not the packaging. Also, not one of the discs was scratched. If you can get this for thirty dollars or less, it is well worth the money and will not disappoint.

Now onto the product itself, since most people are just reviewing the packaging. This is actually the first time I have seen the complete series, what a blast! Farrah was a phenomenom at the time, and it would have been nice to have seen her stay at least another season. It was news to me that she did another six episodes after season one, because I only caught the show occasionally in the 70s. She was also so athletic, too, I had totally forgotten the famous skateboard sequence. Cheryl Ladd was a great replacement in season two, interesting the episodes where she and Farrah are together as 'sisters.' And Jaclyn Smith? A classic beauty. The one miscast to me was Kate Jackson. She was awesome when she first started out on Dark Shadows and in the Rookies, by Charlie's Angels, she had lost some of her appeal and her mind looks like it is elsewhere, evidently it was as she left after season three. Which brings me to Shelly Hack, how gorgeous she was! Personally, I would have kept her on as she made a nice compliment to Jaclyn Smith and put one of the two of them in the 'leader' role. The studio, of course, lost faith in her and replaced her with Tania Roberts, who was interesting, too, but had even less chemistry with the others.

I was also surprised at all the guest stars in the show when they were either at the end of their careers or just staring out: Robert Englund, Jamie Lee Curtis, Kim Basinger (in the Angels in Chains episode, no less), Stephen Collins, Timothy Dalton, Kim Cattral (who was very hot when she was young), just to name a few. Everybody who was going to be anybody ended up in Charlie's Angels at one time or another, it seems. In a behind the scenes featurette, the show's producers admit that they had a hard time reinventing the show over time. Isn't that the truth, by season five they were repeating all the same storylines they were doing in season one (Jaclyn Smith, for instance, gets shot three times, even in the series finale), and Farrah gets kidnapped and taken cross country in a truck while later the same thing happens to Cheryl Ladd. The show has its flaws, but still, what a terrific trip down memory lane seeing all five seasons at once was! Highly recommended, if you can get past the spindles!",1371254400,2,3037,4.509981851179673
5163245,4,B008H6GHII,"As others have noted, this set employs a most usual storage mechanism. The disks sit in two plastic spindles. While this seems like something that would pose a problem, it actually works out very well. Box sets of this kind (Complete TV Series) always seems poorly constructed in a manner gauranteed to scratch disks. It's counter-intuitive, but the spindle avoids that.

I had less trouble with this odd packaging than I have with other complete series sets.

It's a great bargain if it is discounted. Otherwise just buy the individual seasons.

The disks themselves are well put together with good video quality and include closed captions. Beyond the packaging, this isn't some cut-rate set like you would get from the likes of Mill Creek.",1371254400,,742,4.967741935483871

5163268,2,B008H6GHII,"Every negative comment on this site about the packaging is spot on.  After making fans wait years for season 5, Sony gave us the option of getting it on DVD-R DVDs with no art work, or getting the complete series, which ironically is cheaper than season 5.  Unfortunately, the complete series must have required Sony to invest at least $1.49 (in total) on the packaging and art work!
You get two 5 cent plastic cases that hold the season 1-4 previously released DVDs, with no additional art work or even a simple episode description, and 4 season 5 DVDs held down at the bottom under a 1 cent cardboard cut out.  FYI - lose or destroy that cardboard cutout and your DVDs will be in a free fall.  Of course, nothing keeps the DVDs from scratching as they are just piled up in the two spindles.
I am confident Sony will make millions of dollars on this set because the fans of this show will buy it.  I did.  I would just like to appeal to the investors and ask you if you don't see this the same way I do - - this is the most compelling argument for bootleg DVDs I can imagine.  If you are going to get piece of crap DVD-R DVDs, no art work, exceptionally poor packaging, no special features, no fan/consumer appreciation, why on Earth pay retail?

However, I noticed several episodes are edited down from their original broadcast versions. The set features the EXACT same DVDs that the previous seasons 1-4 sets contained, so there are no new bonus features unfortunately.

5163281,4,B008H6GHII,I bought this as a gift for my partner. He's a huge Charlie's Angel fan. The packaging is a bit strange since the disks are essential held by two spindles with cardboard disks to hold them in place. Other than that it was a great buy.,1351296000,2,234,4.108695652173913
5163282,1,B008H6GHII,Sony has really dropped the ball with this one. Heavy stack of discs in a plastic spindle glued on a cardboard box that breaks off during shipping.,1351296000,5,147,4.481481481481482
5163283,3,B008H6GHII,"When this boxset arrived on 10 October I was all fired up at obtaining the complete
series in one box. It came in a glorious box that spelled out ""I am a glamorous
series that ended up having six very sexy and talented actresses in my history"". I
was very excited to open the box, but when I did, I was shot down so fast my hands
shook, my nerves were shot to pieces, and I said to myself ""My God, the boxset
from hell"". It was like opening your favourite box of candy and finding one's
nightmare inside, but nightmares only last until your nerves carm down.

The dvds are piled on top of each other with no protection what-so-ever, with a bit
of crappy cardboard and flimsy plastic to hold them in place. I dread the thought
of what will happen if the cardboard or plastic becomes useless. I made a pact with
the Devil and swore that I will sit down and watch all the discs to see if they
work, as my nerves will not be the same until I do.

While you are watching the series (all 91 1/2 hours) the discs have to be left out
or pulled out again and again to see the next disc, which is a nightmare. I kept
them in sleeves off book cover discs while I watched them. There are 11 discs of
seasons 1-2 on one side and 16 discs of seasons 3-5 on the other side.

The show was exciting for the 1970s as three women working for a mysterious man
(Charlie) as private eyes. The Police Academies where Charlie found them would not
miss them, as they were not suited for the dangerous jobs they had to do, so they
opted for the less dangerous job as private investigators.

The only issue I have with this series was with the Angels wanting to see Charlie.
In one episode Charlie was kidnapped, so, if the Angels wanted to find out about
who Charlie was, a private eye worth half his or her salt would have no trouble
finding out.

It was good to see the Angels again, but this series was no different from a dozen
other private eye shows, but the Angels made it easier to digest, and it was worth
watching.

It would be impossible to review each episode or each disc, but I enjoyed the series
again, even though I had been on a time consuming mission of my own this time. The
episodes are flawless with no negatives about the dvds, everything was as it should
be.

Aaron Spelling was a MEGA producer who had produced many successful TV shows, which
this series was but one of them. The Angels were cast perfectly for the show, so
Farrah Fawcett-Majors, Jaclyn Smith and Kate Jackson were superstars overnight. This
made it even harder for Cheryl Ladd, Shelley Hack and Tanya Roberts, who followed
in the series.

If one can get pass the opening of this box, then I would recommend it to anyone,
but it will take a few basic steps to protect the discs while watching them. I
recommend you do what I did, keep them in single sleeves or cases until you are
finished one side of the box. Be careful with the packaging as it will not take any
rough treatment.

I would love to give this boxset 5 stars, but it will only get 3 instead. If the
storage went into as much thought as the box itself, it would have been 100%
(perfect), but alas it wasn't. So it is at the detriment of the series that they
chose the cheapest way out, and have such a stigma associated with such a beautiful
boxset. It is by far the worst packaging I have seen so far. What a crying shame.",1350950400,2,3352,4.2087227414330215
5163284,1,B008H6GHII,"I do not own the complete series set but share the surprise, and disappointment, of other reviewers regarding the quality of the packaging. I own 1,000s of DVD sets and expected that this set was comprised of individual season sets. The packing and the price indicate that strongly.

The packaging looks like it includes individual sets and charging $50 for 5 seasons of a show for which individual seasons cost an average of $10 suggests that you get the individual season sets. I predict that this turkey will ultimately go for around $25.

Turning to the series itself, a friend and I were just discussing how Aaron Spelling made HUGE suckers out of the American public in the mid-70s to late 80s. No one ever would have mistaken his productions for Masterpiece Theater, but I only realized while fast-forwarding through Tivoed episodes of ""Angels"" how little actual plot that show, and its companion series ""The Love Boat"" and ""Fantasy Island,"" had.

In the case of ""Boat"" and ""Island,"" each of the three stories per episode only had roughly five minutes of actual plot. The episodes themselves were roughly 45 minutes. Ten minutes was devoted to the setup and another ten minutes went into the wrap-up and ""amusing"" scene among the crew or Roarke and Tattoo. This left approximately 20 minutes total to actually tell three very predictable stories.

In the case of ""Angels,"" watching each fast-forwarded episode took no more than 20 minutes. The innocent of the week would show up and have John Forsythe brief the angels on his or her case. The angels would then establish their undercover roles, there would be minimal detection, at least 20 minutes of an unduly long chase, and five minutes of wrap-up followed by a brief segment in which the angels would make middle-aged and competent Bosley feel like an impotent doddering old man.

There are much better, and comparably priced, escapist shows from that era out there. I still enjoy the equally dated ""Remington Steele,"" which at least shows some creativity in most of its chase scenes.",1350000000,,2046,4.901734104046243
5163285,5,B008H6GHII,Well when they pull these petty tricks on us to buy the same four seasons again to get the fifth. There is nothing you can do. So the best thing I did is give my four seasons to someone who is not a fortunate as me to by dvds whenever I want. It made my best friend very happy so give your four season to a good friend who can't afford them. They will be ever so grateful. I am waiting anxiously for the set to see if the first season is redone. Too grainy on the first season the rest were fine. I did the same thing with Dark Shadows I gave my brother the individual sets I bought so I could by the whole coffin collectors edition. My brothers eyes lit up when I gave him all 26 volumes and the six original non Barnabas episodes too. Treat your self the new editions and make someones day by surprising them with dvds you don't need cause a better set is out there.,1348790400,8,868,3.9942528735632186
5163296,4,B008H6GHII,"Many recent reviews have been posted have been negative about this DVD set. While I agree that Sony could have done a better job with the packaging (stacking the DVDs on top of one another), at least we finally have a complete set here. I have watched a few episodes of Season 5, and the quality looks great to me. As for the remainder of the art on the DVDs (for those of us who bought Seasons 1-4), these are the same DVDs that were from the individual sets (all grouped together now).
For those waiting for Season 5 to be released on it's own, this set is probably the preview to what you can expect when Sony finally releases it. There probably won't be any special features on it either.
So, I give 4 stars for the set (minus 1 star for the packaging).",1348790400,8,757,4.227586206896552

What a disappointment.  After the great job Sony did with the Season 3 and Season 4 release, I was expecting great things from this complete collection.  What a let down.  The discs are stacked in two spindles which anyone will tell you is a terrible way to store the DVDs.  If you're going to watch these episodes a lot, going through the ""stack"" to find the disc you want is going to be a huge pain and it's going to be very easy for the discs to get scratched or damaged.  Very disappointing.  I am sending this back and sticking with my season sets and hope they will eventually do an individual release for Season 5 soon.",1348790400,21,797,4.410958904109589

Personally, I'm more concerned about the quality of the DVD content. One some of the previous releases, I noticed that the episodes had been pooly edited-  they were chopped up for the original syndication. It would be great to have the broadcast airings included with the Complete Series box set. At least then, you'd be gettng something different than with the seasons already released. I downloaded the Season 5 premiere and it was cut from the original 3-hour ""Night with the Angels"" special into 3 individual episodes with no special opening sequence; like the other seasons, there was special intro for the season 5 premiere and key scenes were cut from the episode.

Plus I hate that there are still no extras besides the Angels forever featurette. If they didn't want to include any cast interviews, how about some episode promo's from the series run",1348704000,,1069,4.736559139784946

Although season 1 could have had artwork. It had none. SHAME, SHAME, SHAME on Sony for having no extra's whatsoever in this so called compete box set! They could have interviewed and done featurettes on all the former Angels even putting one together with Farrah using past Interviews unseen or even seen. How about Jack Condon the guy who has probably the most extensive collection of Angel Memorabilia EVER! He wrote a book The Charlie's Angels Casebook with David Hofstede forward by Jaclyn Smith(Apr 20, 2000). How about including The Movie Condon's book is based on,Behind the Camera - Charlie's Angels Starring Dan Castellaneta and Lauren Stamile (2005) There are other books to reference as well!
 The discs are just stacked on top of one another with no protection except a cheap piece of card board to keep them from falling out of this crap set! Sony with all the money they waste on the GARBAGE T.V. and movies they distribute could have given The Fan's and The former cast and crew the respect they deserve with a stellar tribute in a nice box set! I mean come on. I am sure SMITH~JACKSON~LADD~HACK~ROBERTS would have given commentary on their favorite shows and some of the fans favorite shows! Not to mention the CREW and a slew of now famous guest stars who would have participated by giving interviews!
They had GOLDBERG and so many other people attached to the show that would have giving their perspective and experiences and what it was like making television history. Not too mention like I said past interviews with FARRAH and DAVID DOYLE~JOHN FORSYTH and AARON SPELLING.
  It wouldn't have taken a lot of imagination to put together a great product because Charlie's Angels ignited imaginations all over the world! It was my favorite show along with The Rockford Files and the best of 70's t.v. and one of the best show's of all time!!! Look at how anything CHARLIE'S ANGELS still sells gang busters online. What a sad way to pay tribute to THE THREE LITTLE GIRLS WHO WENT TO THE POLICE ACADEMY, THE THREE WHO REPLACED THEM, CHARLIE, BOSLEY AND ALL THEIR LOYAL FANS! ME INCLUDED!

5163302,1,B008H6GHII,"Though I would've preferred a metal tin (see Justice League Complete Series)for the outer box, a decent enough cardboard material is used. The lone Amazon pic shows the first two of the four different sets of Angels on the left side of the outer box (in all their Silver Convention glory). The right side pleasantly shows the latter two sets of angels. Each of the four inside flaps are dedicated to one of the four sets of Angels, fully covered with photos from that phase. Most of which are from the indidivual season sets. A few new pictures along with each Angel's name appears on the flaps that cover each spindle. Which brings me to the main issue ... the two spindles which hold both stacks of discs. Though not as bad I first thought, a series so great as this deserves the five-star treatment and not some budget packaging. The discs seem somewhat secure in the cheap plastic holders but the inevitability of scratching will probably occur after the first removal. Which causes me to rethink ditching my individual season sets. Because even though I loathe thin cases, they're still better than spindles. There's also no booklet, just an episode list/insert inside the box. The discs of Seasons 1-4 all seem identical to the ones from the indidivual sets, with no added special features or remastering. Also, no special mention of Season Five's debut on dvd and the artwork on those discs are basically the photo from the box (which also appears on Amazon's CA : Season Five homemade item page). Cosmetically speaking, this box rocks but because of the disc housing inside and lack of booklet, the set gets a low rating. Word to the wise, wait for the individual Season Five. A better package would've consisted of the same outer box housing 5 individual 14mm cases (which hold 5-6 disc) and a booklet/episode guide along with whatever exclusive goodie I'm sure Sony could've throne in. See Riptide or Jem Complete Series for examples.

Season Five breakdown
*No Special Features or Previews
*No Special Options (subtitles, closed captioning or anything else)
*Lackluster Menu : no big Charlie's Angels: Season ... logo on the menu screen like the other sets have, just the small black Angels silohette with the disc number. Disc 1: has a Kelly pic while the remaining three discs show all three Angels. The design is slightly more modern than the menus of Seasons 1-4, but very generic at best. It's what you would probably see on a disc of a low budget sequel versus the original hit movie's disc and design.",1348444800,6,2519,4.777522935779817
5163303,3,B008H6GHII,"FAN OF THE SERIES
I am a somewhat new fan of Charlie's Angels. Since 2010, I've ordered seasons one through four separately from Amazon. I absolutely loved the seasons. The packaging could've been better, though. But the point is: I searched for like two years for season five's DVD release. I kept thinking: ""What's the hold up? Sells for the first four years were pretty good and this show has a loyal following and several petitions to release season five.""

FINDING OUT ABOUT THIS SET
One day I went searching for ""upcoming Charlie's Angels DVD releases"" and I found Amazon's page showcasing that Charlie's Angels: The Complete Series was available for pre-order. I was so mad. I thought that Sony had just lost their minds. I looked into the package, though. At first, I saw no clues for a separate season five DVD release. I was eager to see to complete series, though.

BUYING THE BOX SET
So, not at Amazon, but at my local Wal-Mart, I bought the complete series... just for season five. It was like $37 total. Not too bad, I guess. But yet it was, figuring I already had seasons one through four and because I was just buying the set to get sixteen episodes on what was reported to be just four DVDs.

OFFICIAL REVIEW FOR THE SET
When I got home and opened the box I saw the real problem was just to come. The outside of the box is very glossy and has the Charlie's Angels logo with ""Charlie's Angels the complete series. All 5 seasons and 27 discs"" typed on the outer layer. Turning to the left side I saw cast photos of the first three seasons, and on the right, for seasons four and five. The main box set slides out of the outer box and you see several tiny pictures that are something our snap shots. You flip it over, the same style of, but different, pictures are there. Most of these pictures were from seasons one through three. When I opened it up, I saw similar pictures, but these pictures were all from seasons four and five. I finally started thinking: ""Where on Earth are the DVDs?"" You open the binding yet again and see more pictures on the far left and far right. It has a profile shot of each Angel, with their Angel, not real, name listed below it. Dead in the center there is a quote box that says ""Good Morning, Angels..."" I must say I was pleased with the artwork and quality of the pictures, but was disturbed because of the cardboard packaging. Then I saw the long waited DVDs. They are stacked in two black prongs. On the left side you have seasons one and two and on the right you have seasons three to five. There is no protection for the DVDs. They are just stacked on top of each other. To keep the DVDs in place there is a stiff cardboard over the DVDs. I was so angered by this. Fans have waited nine years and this is what we are awarded with? There are absolutely nothing new about the DVDs, no new special features. We get like a twenty-minute documentary, called ""Angels Forever"", that was initially included in the 2003 release of season one. Just so I would not get to fiery over it, I just bought a two flip, four DVD holder DVD case to put my season five discs in. I've already started working on artwork for it and I looking forward to my homemade DVD set.",1347321600,7,3205,4.3561872909699

Charlie's Angels - Front/Rear Box Art for 'The Complete Series,' Plus Word of Separate 'Season 5'
September 25th release of the entire show's run (in time for the holidays), then a separate S5 set down the road
Posted by David Lambert
 7/30/2012

Once upon a time, there were three little girls who went to work for Charles Townsend, a mysterious man they never got to see, at his Beverly Hills detective agency. And they became the sexiest, most eye-popping crime-stopping private eyes to ever grace TV.

On September 22, 1976, ""Charlies Angels"" premiered, making Kate Jackson, Farrah Fawcett and Jaclyn Smith overnight superstars. The series continued for five unforgettable seasons and included four different sets of Angels. When Fawcett left after the first season (she returned in the third and fourth seasons as a guest star in six episodes), she was replaced by cheryl Ladd, who played her little sister. The fourth season introduced new Angel Shelly Hack, who replaced Jackson, and in the fifth season, we meet the final Angel, Tanya Roberts, who replaced Hack. The series co-starred David Doyle as John Bosley and was produced by TV legends Aaron Spelling and Leonard Goldberg.

""Charlies Angels"" The Complete Series contains all the glamour, guns, hair, bikinis, high-kicking action and dangerous intrigue packaged into 117 episodes, include the original pilot, plus the ""Angels Forever"" featurette!
A week ago, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment announced their September 25th plans to release Charlie's Angels - The Complete Series as a 27-DVD set, with all five seasons of the original 1976 show. Now we've gotten front and rear box art for this gift package, which is currently the only way to get the show's fifth season. The only bonus material on this title will be the ""Angels Forever"" featurette mentioned in the studio description above, and which was made for 2003's DVD release of the first season.

You'll see the package art (both sides of it) shown below, along with a pre-order button link at Amazon. For some reason the entry at Amazon has been renamed from ""The Complete Series"" to a breakdown that this set contains ""Season 1, Season 2, etc...""; the complete series set of Rescue Me (which Sony releases the same day) has also been listed at Amazon this way for a week now. We don't consider this to be anything to worry about; it's just some titling nuttiness that will probably be resolved before you know it.

The other question we've been getting concerns how this Complete Series package is the only way to get the show's final season. We asked Sony about a separate Season 5 set, and they tell us it will come later on. So if you already own the first four seasons on DVD, then it would make sense to wait. We'll alert you when that individual S5 title is coming, so stay tuned!

Why even bother releasing the complete series anyhow as the first 4 seasons are now available at Best Buy for $10 each. This is just corporate greed and I refuse to buy the complete series just to get the final season.",1343088000,9,450,4.433734939759036
5163336,5,B008H6GHII,"""Charlie's Angels"" will always be well remembered as being one of the most popular series on network television in the United States. Debuting in the fall of 1976 the police drama quickly became a Top 10 show, made stars out of its three leads (Kate Jackson, Farrah-Fawcett-Majors and Jaclyn Smith) and put ABC on the map as the #1 network.

 Even when Farrah and Kate Jackson left the series the show still had a very loyal audience who followed the angles/police detectives week after week for five seasons ending, sadly in 1981.

 It was actually Kate Jackson who was responsible for the title of the show. Originally named ""The Alley Cats"", Jackson suggested to the producers that it didn't sound right and that having ""angels"" in the title sounded more promising. It was also Kate who came up with the idea of having Charlie not be seen by the anglels or the audience to give the show a kind of mystery. These ploys worked and thus ""Charlie's Angels"" was born.

 Finally, fans can enjoy all five seasons worth of shows (110 episodes) in one complete package at a very good price. I know many have complained that they already have the first four seasons and have to spend extra cash just to get season five, but there is still a possiblity the studio may release season 5 as a solo set.

 I am just ecstatic that ""Charlie's Angels"" will live on in posterity in wonderful DVD format!",1343001600,12,1387,4.587044534412955
5163337,5,B008H6GHII,"This is a great deal ONLY if u don't have the seperated seasons sets 1-4 but if u have them like i do then u have to wait until FINALLY season 5 will be released SO OUR TORTURE OF WAITING AND WAITING...MAY COME TO AN END.

 PS.

 Sorry but i don't want to have seasons 1-4 2 times just to get season 5.",1343001600,6,302,3.746031746031746
5163338,1,B008H6GHII,"This is just another typical ploy to get folks to rebuy stuff they already have. Sorry Sony, no sale. I already have $80.00 invested in the series with seasons 1-4. And additional $45.00 is just too much to ask for one season. That's $120.00 all together with little to no chance to recoup any of it. Yes, I can attempt, and I do mean attempt (everyone else will be trying to do the same thing and getting even $5.00 out of each set will be difficult), to resell my duplicate seasons, but let's remember that Sony is the worst at complete series packaging. The discs will all probably be on some kind of plastic hub with no protection in between the discs. Scratched discs are a definate possibility. Flimsy cardboard outer casing. The whole thing will be an absolute nightmare. Until season 5 is released as a stand alone, Sony isn't getting another dime from me for Charlies Angels. I already have the seasons that I most wanted anyway. The final season is the pits. Bad packaging, bad season, double dipping on seasons 1-4, where is the logic in buying this again? None that I can see. Definate pass on this.

Note: it has been revealed that this set will be on a plastic spindle hub like the complete Soap, Good Times and other such sets from Sony. WAY cheap. Yeah, again no sale Sony.

Further Note: It has been stated by Sony on tvshowsondvd.com that there will be a later release of Season 5 by itself. So, those that purchased seasons 1-4 will not have to buy this set just for Season 5.",1343001600,15,1495,4.452554744525547
5163339,5,B008H6GHII,"I have the first 4 seasons and have to spend 46.19 for all of them again?  Not a bad price all in all but it is just the principal!  I have been dying to get season 5 and complete my set so I probably will cave.  UGH!

They better have some extras or something to make it worth my while!",1343001600,10,287,3.7333333333333334
5163340,5,B008H6GHII,"i like the rest of you feel this is crazy to have to buy season 1,2,3,4 and now having to rebuy these 4 seasons again. however i kinda figure this is the only way i was going to get season 5 i brought season 5 back in march of this year on i offer however that person never sent me it.  i do have season on my dvr and on itunes but i wanted it out on dvd verson so i can finish with all of the angels and yes i did buy the reboot it well never be like the original 6 angels and i have the 2 movies i been a angel fan for years and now it will have been 3 yrs and 2 months since season 4 came out on dvd and the price to buy it is very cheap.  just a shame that we have to have 2 of every season and one of season 5 and maybe if this sells then they may put season 5 on a stand alone season after all.  and who knows about the packaging is it going to be bad like some of the other series i heard about like i dream of jeannie or wild wild west.  and if the is the case then i put season 5 in a different package so i can have it by itself.  i also have season one again in a charlie's angels lunch box that i have never open.  but hey either way at least i can say i will finally have all of the angels old and new and be finally done with it.  Well I got it for a birthday present but some of the reviews are right about the packaging one side came unglued from the back cover, my sister got it and i glad,i won't be buying the season 5 it would be useless due to the way they put it together ,you can go online and get every season episodes so that way you know what each season is about.
so now i done with my complete charlie's angels,all 5 seasons,the 2 movies and the reboot of charlie's angels.  I will not buy season 5, I suggest that you buy this set and forget the season 5 by itself there is not guide to it like there isn't on this but however your not getting dvd-r,you are at least getting discs that shows their faces like the other season,  the charlies angels sites shows that they are just plain white discs with no pictures of them and no episode guide either.  so I am now done, I printed out the episode guide of all 5 seasons off the internet so i won't worry about season 5 stand alone dvd set.",1343001600,2,2217,3.7586206896551726
5163341,4,B008H6GHII,"Sony Pictures Television should release season 5 as a stand alone. It's great news that finally season 5 is been release along with the previous four seasons which I already own like I guess most of the rest of fans. The price of the package of $46.16 is reasonable but why not release the s5 separately? The reboot 2011 version got it's release, so why denied the the loyal fans the pleasure of owning s5 by itself? Either way Sony will make money since I am very sure that fans are awaiting for it, it will be a hit. Charlie's Angels is a classic television series like no other. Season five was great & fun to watch. Hope Sony Television will change it's mind and be angelic enough to grant fans their wishes. Thank you.",1343001600,4,723,4.362962962962963
5163342,5,B008H6GHII,"all I can say is we are getting Season 5 on DVD FINALLY ... yes I own season 1-4 already ... who cares we are getting a FULL 1-5 set which means more to me than ever !!! $46 is worth the wait to me ... Thank you Charlie for giving all us Angels here on earth the best gift ever ... a complete set !!!

P.S. Thank you Sony it's about time !!!",1342915200,,341,3.608108108108108
5163343,4,B008H6GHII,"Finally season five comes out on DVD, It is worth waiting for even if i have the I tunes package on the computer. My main complaint is why must we double dip in the four seasons just to get season five on DVD, that and no new extras. On the other hand season one is wearing out, so getting the boxed set is worth it all. The season opening show and the one where Kelly is stalked by a very deranged transvestite are worthy episodes to see again. Oh yes, then theres the redo of The Seance, called Attack Angels. So what if it is a redo of a season one episode, it is another good one in which Julie gets hypnotized into knocking off the company president. Well done for us Angels fans.",1342915200,2,685,4.119402985074627
5163344,5,B008H6GHII,"We've waited forever for season five.  It's finally here, although it would be nice to have a stand alone set or at least some extra bonus features.  I'm ok with it though, since the price is so reasonable.  Thank you, Sony!",1342915200,,224,4.414634146341464
5163345,1,B008H6GHII,"With better packaging, this could have been an excellent release for the price, even having to double-dip on Seasons 1-4. However, the plastic spindles are very cheap and there are cardboard inserts to keep the stacked discs in place. The set looks very nice until you open it up and see how the discs are stacked. **NOTE** See the photos I posted of this in the IMAGES Section of this product.

There are no new bonus features included which is a shame, only the ""Angels Forever"" featurette that originally appeared on the Season 1 set that came out way back in 2003. Still, this was a must-have for me, having waited FOREVER for Season 5 on DVD. Now I wish I would have waited though for the stand-alone release that is rumoured to be coming out later. I will probably buy that and sell this set.

We kick off the final season with a two-parter that forgoes the exotic location shooting of season-openers past and brings us instead a standard case of murder and corruption within the modeling industry, introducing us to scrappy, tough-talking final Angel Julie Rogers (the stunning, statuesque Tanya Roberts).

Due to an actors' strike in 1980, the fifth season was truncated and only 16 episodes produced. The team spirit that was missing from Season 4 is re-established here even if the scripts are hit-and-miss. Some of the series' worst episodes show up in Season 5--from the boring ""Mr. Galaxy"" and ""He Married an Angel"" to the cringe-worthy ""Moonshinin' Angels"" and ""Chorus Line Angels"".

Some of the best episodes of Season 5 include ""Angel on the Line"" which features Kelly squaring off against a deranged transvestite in the one of the series' (unintentionally) funniest scenes; ""Hula Angels"" has a terrific turn from guest villainess Joanna Cassidy; while ""Island Angels"" boasts a guest-star roster including Carol Lynley, Lyle Waggoner, Randolph Mantooth, Barbi Benton and more.

The outer box is sturdy and looks great and the inner case has great photos of ALL the Angels, but the stacked discs on cheap spindle make this a lousy set.",1342915200,30,2050,4.879310344827586
