1367187,5,B00004XMSU,"A brilliant and absolutely authentic story about the stark realities of pioneer life in late 1800's Wyoming.  ""Heartland"" is based on a series of letters (""Letters of a Woman Homesteader"" by Elinore Pruitt Stewart).  The actors are very real, and the story unfolds almost like a documentary.  Rip Torn and Conchita Ferrell are superb in mostly just living their everyday lives.  However, they perform tasks and ""everyday pleasures"" considered quite extraordinary by modern standards, especially considering the harsh winter conditions.  Excellent photography, and DVD bonus commentary explaining each scene.",1071100800,55,607,5.775280898876405
1367188,5,B00004XMSU,I saw this movie when it first appeared on cable and never forgot it. I watch each time I find it showing. My Grandmother was born in 1880 and I remember the stories she told me.  This movie is absolutely true to life and incredibly well done.  I am researching my ancestry and this movie will be a permanent addition to my Library of events as a very 'real' part of family life in the 1800's. Don't miss it! Rip Torn and Conchata Ferrell are wonderful.,1060992000,17,453,4.255813953488372
1367189,4,B00004XMSU,"This movie shows a good example of a healthy relationship between two independent adults. This model should be shown to all adolescents, so that they can have a good basis for comparison as to what a relationship should be; not the drivel that hollywood and the television feed them. It is powerful and moving, but most of all it is a textbook case of morality, hard work, survival, and how love can grow anywhere.",1052006400,11,414,4.608108108108108
1367190,5,B00004XMSU,"I can't believe that this movie is finally available.  I loved this movie so much, I found a used PAL video in England (over the internet), bought it and then took it to a video place and had it transfered to NTSC format.  This is a terrific movie.  Conchata Ferrell is brillant.  A wonderful actress, she rarely gets a role that is worthy of her (anyone out there know if the TV series Hot l Baltimore is going to be transferred to video?).  But this movie.  Watch it.  Share it.",980208000,7,480,4.266666666666667
1367191,5,B00004XMSU,"I have been waiting for a long time for this to be re-released.  Since hiring it almost accidentally from a video shop years ago and loving it, I have been trying to get hold of it.  I have never met anyone who has seen it and can't wait to get hold of a copy so that I can lend it to friends.  What has stayed in my mind is the opening shot of the train travelling across a vast expanse of land to the accompaniment of a hymn played on what sounds like a musical saw - absolutely gripping.  I remember excellent photography, the clear stark colours and the beauty of harsh scenery, the honesty and integrity of the script and the restrained acting.  I had no preconceptions about this film when I first saw it and it took hold of me and wouldn't let go. The relationship between the Torn character and the housekeeper is an unlikely one but totally credible and very moving. I do not think I will be disappointed when I see this film again.",973814400,17,941,4.23463687150838
1367192,5,B00004XMSU,"Torn and Ferrell star in an authentic depiction of the harshness of homesteading about a hundred years ago in Wyoming. (It's still a tough place to ranch.) It's exciting and sad and sometimes blissfully joyful. A great movie I hadn't seen in a long time, but had been looking for for years to buy.
Based on a series of letters written by the homesteading woman in the early years of this century, the film tells a story far more grim than the determined cheerfulness of Elinore Pruitt Stewart does in ""Letters of a Woman Homesteader.""  Both stories are true.",966211200,9,558,4.636363636363637
1367193,5,B00004XMSU,"This is a brilliant story of the power of a woman's heart.

1367196,5,B00004XMSU,This is a true to life movie and a lesson in history.  I first saw it years ago and it was reminiscent of my family who came from France and homesteaded in Wyoming.  My father had always told me how unromantic and difficult those years were and I think this movie portrays that very thing  My family survived the bitter weather but not the drought which was followed a year latter by the Depression.  I strongly recommend it!,1453420800,,425,4.410256410256411

1367211,3,B00004XMSU,"This is a good ole pioneer type of movie, but I feel like the quality supposedly ""good"" was way overrated.

1367213,2,B00004XMSU,"Having read the book it was based on, I found this adaptation dreary and depressing.  The book was interesting and funny and full of oddball characters and beautiful stories.

1367215,5,B00004XMSU,"Rip Torn is always good for a laugh, so I bought this.  Little did I know, this is a very serious movie.  I got half way through it before my cat demanded to be brushed and a raccoon got into my house and was eating my dinner off the kitchen table.  Now, I have to start it over.  I gave it five stars for the benefit of the doubt.",1397952000,,331,3.753623188405797

1367217,5,B00004XMSU,"I've seen this movie at least 6 times.  The theme played at the beginning and again at the end
is a hymn I have loved since childhood.  that's a looooooonnnngg time.
These two performances were almost spellbinding.  A very serious film about life in the western
plains in maybe the late 1800s or the turn of the century.
a homestead with no one around for miles.  The word for life was 'hardship'.
It's putting one foot in front of the other, one day at a time during a very harsh Wyoming winter.
The little girl who played Concetta's daughter was so charming.  The sweetspot in the film.
Don't know the name of the gentleman who played the part of their ""sometime ranch-hand"" and
friend, but he was so likable.  The death of the baby was sad, but that's the way it was, hard.
I'll probably watch it 6 more times.",1390521600,6,813,4.386666666666667
1367218,5,B00004XMSU,This movie showed the real toughness that was needed to settle the west. Rip Torn and Conchata Ferrell are wonderful actors and really keep the audience's attention. Love this movie.,1389484800,2,182,5.1
1367219,4,B00004XMSU,"A very plain and simple story which I love about early 20th century American ranchers eking out a living in Wyoming, based on a true story. Solid acting.

1367221,5,B00004XMSU,"I saw this movie years ago on cable and was surprised at how well they captured the raw way of life of living in the 1800s in the northern U.S. ----, the hardships, the extraordinarily cold winters, the few joys settlers had, the difficult and endless work they did daily, how well they got along with the few things available to them, and their ingenuity.  I admire the honest treatment the director gave this film. It's one of my favorites.",1369353600,4,442,4.525
1367222,5,B00004XMSU,"First, let me say up front that if you are looking for an action movie--don't buy this one. If, however, you are looking for a realistic depiction of pioneer ranching, beautiful scenery and interesting human interaction from the early 20th century this might be the one you want. I first read a review of it in my big Roger Ebert's Four Star Review book. I don't always agree with his reviews, but I do agree with this one. It's a little gritty for city folk in a couple of places, but it's just showing things the way they were on a small ranch in the mountains in the early 1900's. I can recommend it if a person is interested in this type of movie.",1366848000,2,651,4.258064516129032
1367223,5,B00004XMSU,"My idea of a great movie is it sticks with me.  You know, like when an audience in the theater sits through the credits instead of pouring out, or when you still think about it the next day. I saw this on cable years ago, and it still sticks with me.  I saw Torn on an old TV show today, it reminded me how I've wanted to see the movie again, so I came here looking for it, so this review comes before the purchase.

Chemistry reviewer seems to be looking for sexual heat of some kind...pay no attention.  This movie is almost unbearably, starkly intimate--the real kind.",1365724800,,571,4.2592592592592595
1367224,4,B00004XMSU,I don't like justifying my desires to you.  I'm sure whatever I write here will go for waste.  What meaning would my words here carry with them?  Who will read this?,1360540800,,165,4.258064516129032
1367225,5,B00004XMSU,"Considering the avalanche of grade ""Z"" films being foisted on us by a talent-starved Hollywood, ""Heartland"" is a breath of fresh air; a true story about real people surviving in a truly harsh environment.  The performances of  Conchata Ferrel and Rip torn are truly deserving of being recognized as Academy Award quality.  One viewing will back up my statement as to the  quality of effort by all concerned in this wonderful movie.  JHR",1353974400,5,436,4.917808219178082
1367226,5,B00004XMSU,I have this movie on 8track which is now obsolete. I wanted it because so much of the theme of the movie hits so close to home for me having grown up on a farm in the 40s and 50s. It is a movie I will cherish. Well acted and true depiction of days gone.,1351728000,,253,3.618181818181818

1367228,5,B00004XMSU,Thoroughly enjoyed this movie!  I read the book several years ago and actually travelled to the area where the book was written when we were in America 3 years ago.,1348185600,,164,4.466666666666667
1367229,5,B00004XMSU,The is one of my wife's favorites and it was great to have it one DVD. We did have it on VHS.,1338940800,,93,3.272727272727273
1367230,5,B00004XMSU,"I saw this movie when it came out, maybe 20, 25 years ago, and I loved it then. Touching, honest and hard story of life in cold Wyoming in the early part of 20th century.  A brave woman, and a strange but straight up man facing an unforgiving frontier life.  I think it is among my 3 favorite movies of all time.  I am happy to have my own copy now.  The opening music is a terrific solo version, clarinet I think, by George Lewis of my favorite church song, ""What a Friend We Have in Jesus.""  Lewis is old New Orleans jazz based. Wrenching and winsome, delicate and loving music.  Wish I could get a CD with this piece on it.",1331856000,2,626,4.090163934426229
1367231,5,B00004XMSU,"Both ""Letters of a Woman Homesteader"" by Elinore Pruitt Stewart and ""Heartland,"" the movie based on the book, stay in my consciousness.  Some of the reviewers have criticized the movie for being bleaker than the uplifting and optimistic book.  I believe they tell two sides of the same story.  While I love the book and know its tales are a genuine part of the whole--and the most entertaining part, too--homesteading in Wyoming in 1909 couldn't have been that enjoyable for the participants!  It was a brutally hard life, but if not for a core of humor and optimism it would have been a life of desperation.  Elinore became aware very early that her letters were considered fit for publication and realized, too, that the entertaining aspects of them would be what would sell, so she wrote with that in mind.  I think the fact her daughter was consulted on the movie lends credence to the harsher reality.  While seeing beauty around you and enjoying the characters who pass through one's life is what we enjoy most in a story, it would be remiss not to acknowledge the harsh and difficult aspects as well.  The casting was brilliant.  With Conchata Ferrell you always feel you're watching a real character, not an actor; she doesn't get the credit she deserves.  I thought she and Rip Torn were just right for these roles, and portrayed very believably the quiet, understated relationship between the characters as it developed.  I also thought the ending was good; after the winter's desperation, the two together have saved the calf, and you sense they're going to make a new beginning.  If this had been a series or miniseries, there would have been more time to round out this story.",1324080000,4,1689,4.766323024054983
1367232,5,B00004XMSU,"'Heartland' is a movie where not much happens.....not much except life, work, struggle, sacrifice, birth, death, love and--always--the cold, harsh reality of life on the plains in the early 20th century.  This beautiful film features stunningly realistic performances by all its actors---Rip Torn, Conchata Ferrell, et al.  The viewer understands and cares for these characters immediately based on the sparse but meaningful dialogue, and the filming that captures everything from the vastness of the plains to the claustrophobic intimacy of the homesteaders' cabin.  Nothing here is overly sentimental or overworked--it just feels 'real'.  Having grown up on a homestead in eastern Oregon, I can vouch for the authenticity of 'Heartland' in reflecting the many hardships and struggles, and the brief, often scant rewards of working the land and building relationships.  This is not merely an entertainment, it is a heartfelt, wrenching telling of the story of the lives of the immigrants and pioneers who claimed and carved out a life based on self-reliance, and tempered with community, sharing and commitment.  Truly one of the best American films of the 1970's....or ever!",1315699200,3,1176,5.469613259668508
1367233,5,B00004XMSU,"I have loved this movie since I saw it on cable a long time ago.  I have never gotten it out of my head.  I have searched for a DVD for a long time and I am so very happy to find it now.  I ran across the book ""Letters of a Woman Homesteader"" in a used bookstore and when I picked up the book and started looking through it, I was instantly aware this was the book the movie was taken from.  Of course I purchesed the book and took it home and it has become one of my very favorite books.  I love this movie and it's portrail of life on a Wyoming homestead in the early 1900's.  What an impressive movie.  Ms. Farrell and Mr. Torn have done an excellent job in reaching inside your heart and pulling on those heartstrings.  They did a wonderful job.  If you are looking for a movie that portrays life in the west in the early 1900's, I think this would be as close as it gets.  You will love it.",1308787200,3,895,3.922222222222222
1367240,5,B00004XMSU,"A movie where no word is wasted, no object redundant or unnecessary.

1367241,4,B00004XMSU,"This one is hard for me to review.  I first saw it in the theaters some thirty years ago and loved it.  Found it about ten years ago on VHS in an antique shop and happily snapped it up.  Now I have the DVD copy: the gold standard.

This is a very good movie, as others before me have said.  I have no problem with the quirky chemistry between the two main characters, it only adds to its period authenticity and charm.  My dilemma is with the scenes of animal violence.  I understand this was a fact of life for folks on ranches at the turn of the last century.  But couldn't it have been suggested rather than captured?  There are only two or three such scenes, but they make me uncomfortable and close my eyes.  I suspect some other viewers will feel the same way.

That aside - and it's a somewhat large ""that"" - ""Heartland"" is a fascinating story with wonderful performances. Ferrell and Torn have had successful careers since, but their performances here suggested greater future commercial success.",1289088000,3,1004,4.49171270718232
1367242,5,B00004XMSU,"If you like realistic down to earth movies that are based on something that actually
happened then this is the movie for you. Rip Torn and Conchata Ferrell give perfect
performances and put you in a place where you can almost be with them in their struggles
to live their lives homesteading. You will get tired, dirty, hungry, and cold living
on the prairie with these people. A definate A+ for Heartland.",1284768000,3,405,4.638888888888889
1367243,3,B00004XMSU,"I bought both the book and movie for some research I am doing on women homesteaders in Wyoming. I read the book first, Elinore was the bubbliest woman, who loved telling the stories of all the fascinating people she met in the Burnt Fork area. She gives superb descriptions of foods, animals, scenery, but leaves herself out of the picture most of the time (and I'm sure she didn't put in all the woe of her life, so I do know that this may have been glossed over). And Clyde who plays such a minor role in her letters helps her in any way he can to help her prove up on her land though she doesn't want help, she wants to prove to herself and to others she encourages to come to Wyoming as single women that it could be done. (And she does do it - alone)

Then I watched the movie, knowing that some said it is more on the harsh realities than her perky attitude. But even so, I'm not sure why they bothered to base the movie on the book, besides names and location, almost nothing from Elinor and Clyde's life are portrayed correctly. The three things beside names that were close is their first baby boy died, (but not of fever as in the movie)and she did buy the homesteading property adjacent to Clyde's (but not in that manner or for the reasons she did in the movie) and she did come to work for Clyde, (but he advertised for her while in Denver and took her back himself unlike the film.) Oh wait, she did get married in her apron and old shoes, so they got that right. I think that mainly killed it for me. Within seconds of seeing the actress playing Elinor, I turned to my husband and said, ""That's not Elinore;"" and it wasn't. Wasn't the actress's fault, but why bother making a movie based on something if it's nothing like? Just make up your own story!

I did appreciate the movie for what I wanted it for: I wanted to see the Wyoming territory and have a good idea of what the ranchers did back then. But technically the film was shot in Montana, so I didn't really get that, but it seemed very close to what Elinore describes.

But for watching it as a movie, I don't know what the reviewers giving it so many stars and praise and watch it over so many times for if not simply the scenery. The acting seemed stilted (yes, I know what stoic means, but that doesn't mean people back then were all stoic; from the letters, I would say that Elinore and Clyde were quite happy, for she loved to tease him, he did seem that he may have been a bit stoic, but she was so having fun with his personality, I'm sure she enjoyed him in part if not the whole - in a happy manner, she loved making fun of his accent and getting the best of him - they played basically.) The movie plot was minuscule, for I'm guessing the attempt was for ""realism,"" yet it wasn't ""real"" in the sense that this didn't ring true to the book it was based on, an eyewitness account through letters of a real woman. So how does it make it more real if you decide to tell it your own way? Now granted, her letters don't have a plot, but her characters were real and her personality was real (which is not the personality on screen). I know that the scriptwriters consulted Elinore's actual daughter for this movie, so I wonder what she thought of it and if she thought it were more ""real"" in being that perhaps, Elinore's writing to her old boss was more an exercise in fun than an exercise in realism. Makes me wonder.

The ending made both of us say, ""That's it?"" This is very much just a ""day in the life"" kind of film. I'm sure the life/events portrayed in this film were easily real, but once again, I'm hung up on the fact that it strayed so far from the events/themes/feelings of the book.

I'd recommend the book, definitely, but this movie only if you want a good look at Wyoming (actually Montana) ranchers in early 1900s which I am glad that they used real animals (and killing of those animals) to give me that glimpse into that life, and if you won't care that it's not much like the tenor of the book or care that you will not meet any of its secondary characters.

Letters of a Woman Homesteader by Elinore Pruitt Stewart is the book, in case you are wondering, I am grateful for the reviewer that made mention that this movie was based on it, for that's how I found that wonderful resource.",1269475200,4,4284,4.243872549019608
1367244,5,B00004XMSU,"For many of us, our lives are SOOO easy here in the U.S.  It wasn't always that way and likely won't be in the future.  This excellent movie depicts very realistically and with superb acting how a widowed mother struggled to survive, and in small ways to thrive, in the Old West.  It should be shown in schools and colleges all over the country ... in history classes, women's studies classes, and classes addressing climate change, etc.  From it, people can learn to appreciate what they have, consume less, and prepare for the future.

I grew up on a farm in North Dakota.  I remember when we didn't have electricity, indoor plumbing or a telephone, much less a computer.  I watched my grandfather plow his fields with draft horses and my grandmother haul water from the well in buckets.

1367248,5,B00004XMSU,"This is a wonderful slice of life from the early 1900's. Homesteading in Wyoming. Almost a documentary the way it's presented. A Scottish immigrant (played by Rip Torn) (he was born for the part) advertizes for a housekeeper in an eastern newspaper. Elinore Pruitt (Conchita Ferrel) (also perfectly casted) Answers the ad and comes west on the train with her 6 year old daughter. She's met in Burnt Forks by Clyde Stewart and told to go to the general store and order supplies. ""I'll be back in a half hour"" he says. Not a lot of chit chat in the way of introducing himself. That sets the tone of the story for awhile. Most of the film shows the everyday chores and tasks of living on a small ranch. Some might find this a boring film since it's not your everyday entertain me every minute film. They worked hard just to survive. It's amazing how much the world has changed since 1910. In some ways I envy them. But it was an awfully hard life. The winter was bitter cold. As the movie progresses Elinore claims the land next to Stewart and finds she can't keep up the land by herself so ends up marrying Stewart figuring between the two of them they can keep both places. There is not a lot of affection or hand holding between the two. They seem almost like strangers to each other but as time goes on you can tell there is love between them. People were much more reserved in those days. They have a baby boy but it dies during the winter. The feelings are kept inside and eventually Elinore breaks down while hanging up the laundry. She drops to the ground with a scream of anguish. And just as quickly is back to the laundry. Part of the way they were I guess. Most of the livestock is lost in the winter but in spring they start over. The last scene is of Clyde and Elinore helping a calf being born with a comealong and some rope by pulling the calf out of the cow. It appears to be a real calf being born.
It's an abosultely wonderful film of the old days of a time long gone. I'm sorry its gone. Wonderfully filmed with wide open scenes of Wyoming in all seasons. Outstanding acting. Highly recommended",1203206400,9,2111,4.333333333333333

1367250,5,B00004XMSU,"I first saw this when it first came out on a video I rented.  I have been trying to buy the video for several years.  I recently bought it used at a video store and I was so ecstatic I was bouncing off the walls.  Based on the Letters of a Woman Homesteader by Elinore Pruitt Stewart, a book I bought from an Amazon seller.  Conchata Ferrell stars as Elinore, a widow with a small daughter who, answering an ad by Scotish bachelor Rip Torn, comes to the frontier to work for him.  They fall in love, marry, have a child together.  Their trials and tribulations and their love for each other and the land overcome the tragedies that befell them.  I highly recommend this movie.

1367251,5,B00004XMSU,Excellent film for those who enjoy looking back into a realistic history of early 19th century american life in the west.  It is rich earthy and touching as you watch these people struggle with nature.  My father grew up on a farm and remembers many of the authentic images of farm and ranch equipment.  I would recommend this film to any one who wants to watch a film about the reality of the period.,1189555200,5,401,4.391891891891892
1367252,5,B00004XMSU,"My grandmother and grandfather homesteaded in Wyoming in 1910, and luckily for me, my grandmother was a wonderful storyteller.  We learned about the obligation to feed a cowboy passing through (for next to nothing, no matter how poor your were), about the fact that eating prairie dog was a sign that you were nearly starving.  Their nearest neighbors were 7 miles away, so any emergency had to be dealt with on their own.

When this first came to theatres, I went with my family (our grandparents had died by then), and we literally staggered out afterwards.  Our grandparents' story had become so real that it was overwhelming.

All this reality, and the fact that the film was partially funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities, could give the idea that it was one of those ""stuffy, documentary-type"" films that tries so hard to re-create history that it lacks drama.  There is drama aplenty in ""Heartland,"" and marvelouos acting.  The dialogue is sparse: the actors' faces and movements,their actions, the images speak eloquently of hardship, cooperation, trust and beauty.",1177891200,21,1088,5.044692737430168
1367253,5,B00004XMSU,"Heartland is a great representation of life on the frontier on the early 20th century.  This is a picture of what life was really like and is based on the real lives of real people.  It is just wonderful, and I wanted it to go on so that I could still follow these people as they face the day to day challenges of living on the frontier.  Conchatta Ferrell and Rip Torn are just wonderful in this movie.  You forget they are acting and just accept them as the real thing.  I reccomend this to all ages.",1171238400,8,502,4.134020618556701
1367254,5,B00004XMSU,"Low key and undramatic in it's presentation, this is nevertheless riveting. It is a slice of life, in the finest sense of the term. The scene is one year in the life of a small group of people, set in turn of the century Wyoming. The story has, at it's center, two strong-willed individuals - a widow with a young daughter to provide for, and her new employer, a brusk ranch owner in need of a housekeeper.

The harsh realities of this time and place are neither side-stepped, romanticized nor over dramatized, but instead are simply dealt with honestly and matter-of-factly, as do the characters themselves. It is not a comedy, though there are moments of hilarity. It is not a tragedy, despite desperately tragic moments. It is as if a window opened and we are graced with a glimpse of the past.

This honesty is the true heart of the story and is the result of the fact that it is a true story, that of the daughter, whose understated presence in the movie is dealt with as straight-forwardly as all the rest.

I am now on my third copy - 2 worn out VCR tapes later, I now own it on DVD and highly recommend it to anyone with the heart to bear it.",1162512000,19,1150,4.314814814814815
1367255,4,B00004XMSU,IT MAKES YOU APPRECIATE THE LIFE WE LIVE TODAY IN COMPARISON WITH THE LIFE IN 1910.

1367256,5,B00004XMSU,"One of the most moving experiences in cinema I'd had for years.  Superb understated acting.  There are elements that are completely lost by several of the other reviewers regarding ""Heartland"".  Victorian Pioneers were a stoic type of people, look up stoicism if need be.  They did not wear their emotions on their sleeves as we do today, and whining was nearly unknown.  Self reliance was a code of conduct lived each day.  One reviewer commented on the lack of ""chemistry"" between Clyde and Elinor.  That is almost a laughable remark- marriages among ranchers even to recent days is often based upon economics and not compatability and romance as such.  Clyde and Elinor actually loved one another with a depth that would frighten most moderns, dealing with death, birth, and life- good, bad and indifferent.

One of my favorite lines from the entire film is when Elinor confesses to her female rancher neighbor played by Lila Skala, that she just cannot talk with Clyde.  The neighbor replies with all sincerity, ""You better learn to before winter sets in.""",1139961600,53,1060,4.937853107344632
1367257,1,B00004XMSU,"I recently read the book ""Letters of a Woman Homesteader"" on which this movie was based for a Historiography class in college.  In another class we were assigned the task of watching the movie in order to compare the differences from the book and the movie.

If the names used in the movie were not the same as those used in the film, I would be shocked to know that these two works were actually related to each other.  The actual letters on which the movie is based are overwhelmingly positive, filled with adventurous stories, interesting developments on the homestead, and a huge endorsement of the process of homesteading.  (In Elinore's very own words, she encouraged people who aren't afraid of work to come and homestead for themselves, rather than working as a seamstress for starvation wages)

The movie on the other hand, is devoid of ANY of the wonderful stories that Elinore tells, and quite honestly is generally devoid of any hope whatsoever.  The movie makes homesteading appear to be a dismal life with no end to trouble, and the end of the movie is simply shocking in comparison to the book. (Shockingly dismal, in comparison to actual events.)

The movie was quite honestly boring and tedious in comparison to the compilation of the Letters of a Woman Homesteader, which I rather enjoyed reading.  Please don't let this movie cloud your judgement of the book, which is uplifting and delightful to read.

This movie failed to deliver at all the message and tone of the real Elinore Pruitt Stewart, and instead makes her life look horrible and bleak when it was actually filled with optimism and achievement.",1139270400,17,1625,4.816546762589928
1367258,5,B00004XMSU,"If you're hooked on the romanticized, idealistic frontier stories that are so common, this ain't for you. But if you want to practically feel the bone-chilling cold, the aching muscles and uncertainty of life on the frontier in the early 1900's, I highly recommend this one. The writing, acting, scenery, direction, even the music, are all fantastic. Of course, I didn't live out West in the early 1900's, but I can't imagine a more realistic, dead-on portrayal of what life was really like for those trying to make a life for themselves in a mostly unsettled territory.  One of my all-time favorites.",1128729600,39,601,4.892156862745098
1367259,2,B00004XMSU,"I realize that living in the Western Plains of Wyoming during the 1900s was brutal, in fact, it probably is still brutal today, but was it monumental enough to transform into a seemingly ""made-for-TV"" movie?  Also, women's rights were still budding in this nation during this time, so to find an independent woman determined to start fresh in this harsh territory, and still show the realism of the era ... would it make for good viewing?  Honestly, I don't know.  I have thought about this film for the past two days, and I still can't seem to muster the strength to say that it was a horrible film, yet I can truthfully tell you that it wasn't the greatest I have ever seen.  From several hodgepodge styles of acting, to two mismatched actors playing devoid of emotion character, to some of the most gruesome PG rated scenes to ever come out of late 70s cinema, it is hard to fully get a good grasp on Heartland.  Was it good?  Was it bad?  That may be up for you to view and decide yourself, but until then, here are moments I enjoyed and desperately hated!

This film continues to be a struggle in my mind because there were some very interesting scenes.  Scenes where I wasn't sure what the director was doing or which direction he was headed, but somehow still seemed to work well as a whole.  I thought the story as a whole was a very interesting, historical tale.  I do not know much about living in Wyoming, especially during the early 1900s, so this film captured that image in my mind.  The thought of very cold winters, no neighbors for miles upon miles, and this Polaroid-esque view untouched by corporate America.  It was refreshing to witness and sheer breathtaking to experience (though the television).  There were scenes that really stood out in my mind, like the cattle-branding scene, the pig slaughtering scene, and the saddening homesteader that didn't survive their journey, that just brought a true sense of realism to this story.  Director Richard Pearce did a great job of bringing the view of Wyoming to the viewers, but I am not sure he brought decent players to accompany the view.

While I will constantly compliment the scenery of this film, I had trouble coping with the actors that seemingly walked on the set and read their lines from cards on the side.  Rip Torn seemed out of place in his role as Clyde Stewart, a loner that somehow finds a connection with Conchata Ferrell's Elinore Randall.  The two as actors have no chemistry at all.  Their scenes that they share together are pointless and honestly void of any emotion.  The pregnancy scene nearly had me in stitches because of the way these two ""veteran"" actors portrayed it.  The brave Elinore does what she has to do to get the child out of her, while Clyde gives an approving nod when she is done.  This is love?  Was it supposed to be love?  I don't know, I think with stronger characters we would have seen a stronger bond, but with Torn and Ferrell, it felt like two actors just playing their parts.  Other scenes that just seemed to struggle in my mind were ones like when the frozen horse ""knocks"" on the door for food or shelter, the constantly fading and growing compassion that Clyde had for Elinore's daughter (I just didn't believe it), the lack of true winter struggle, and the entire land scene.  The land scene especially because I needed more explanation on what Elinore was doing, why she was doing it, and why Clyde would build her a house if they were married!  It was these simple events that if taken the time to explore, would have made for a stronger film.

Overall, I will go middle of the road with this feature.  There were definitely elements that should have been explored deeper, such as the relationship between these two strangers and the ultimate homesteading goals of Elinore, but they were countered with some beautiful scenes of our nation.  These panoramic scenes which, in the span of 100 years, have changes from vast mountains to enormous skyscrapers.  While there were some brilliant scenes of realism (starring cattle and pigs), I just felt as if we needed more.  Depth was a key element lacking in this film, which was overshadowed by marginal acting and a diminishing story.  Pearce could have dove deeper into this untapped world, but instead left open loopholes and clichd Western characters.  Ferrell carried her own, but Torn was completely miscast.  Decent for a viewing, but will not be picked up again by me.

A woman moves from Denver, where she was earning $1.80/day and presumably had friends, to live as a housekeeper on a lonely small ranch in Wyoming in 1910 to earn $7/week.  We are never told her motivation for such a seemingly disadvantageous move, and that is one of the weaknesses of the film.  Another weakness is that it does not have closed captioning or subtitles for the hearing impaired.  The acting and cinematography are excellent.  She marries the rancher out of convenience, and their circumstances get worse as they become poorer and poorer and have to face fierce blizzards that kill most of their cattle.  The soundtrack consists mostly of blowing, icy wind.  The film has little plot and moves slowly.  I take their birthing of a calf at the end as a symbol of hope.",1495584000,,904,4.530864197530864
