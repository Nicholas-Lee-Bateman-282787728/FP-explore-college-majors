7841368,4,6303218709,"Baseball - Inning 8, A Whole New Ballgame is one hour, fifty-five minutes and twenty-nine seconds long and originall aired on September 27, 1994. Baseball Inning 8 covers the years from 1960-1969. It start off with expansion in baseball. The Los Anglas Angels become a team and the original Washington Senators become the Minnesota Twins. In 1961 two of Babe Ruth's records were broken. Roger Marris hit 61 homers and his shut out World Series record is broken also. Sandy Koufax starts out his career as a lousy pitcher to becoming a formible pitcher towards the end of his career and being the youngest person ever elected to Baseball Hall of Fame. Stan ""The Man"" Musial says good-bye to baseball Ty Cobb dies this decade. Casey Stengal would come out of retirement to manage one of the worst team in baseball history-the New Yorks Mets. The only team where the fans came out to watch them loose. Branch Rickey dies; the man who force the intergration of baseball. The ball players try to end the century old gentleman agreement clause and bring in Marvin Miller. Carl Yastrzemski has a Triple Crown year but, his Red Sox still lose the World Series to the Saint Louis Cardinals. Football begins to challenge baseball but, the series does not go into great detail as to why. Baseball Inning 8 ends with the New York Mets winning the World Series and Curt Flood challengimg the reserve clause. Overall I did not think Baseball - Inning 8 was very informative. More like bits a pieces thown together to kill time. Also they could of gone into more detail of why football was a threat to baseball. I can only give Baseball - Inning 8, A Whole New Ballgame a B-.

7841369,5,6303218709,"""A Whole New Ballgame"" always strikes me as being substantially different from the preceding seven ""innings"" of Ken Burns' celebrated ""Baseball"" documentary.  Not only does it covers players and games I remember from my youth, most of the photographs and film clips are now in color, which seems somewhat out of place after having watched hours of images in black & white.  Still, there are the soothing tones of John Chancellor, who represents the voice of spring for me each opening day when I watch ""Baseball"" from start to finish once again.  This episode covers the Sixties, a decade that said goodbye to Ted Williams and hello to the New York Mets while economic issues continued to come to a head.  The decade began with Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris chasing Babe Ruth's home run record and ended with Bob Gibson and Denny McLain having MVP seasons on the mound.  In between there was Sandy Koufax.  The episode ends with Curt Flood refusing to be traded from the Cardinals to the Phillies and challenging the reserve clause as institutional slavery.  As we will see in the final ""inning,"" it was indeed about to become a whole new ballgame.",986083200,2,1148,4.767676767676767
