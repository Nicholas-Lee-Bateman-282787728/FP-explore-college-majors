8293773,5,B001DJ69BG,"After this DVD arrived I couldn't wait to watch it.
As an Australian, I enjoyed it emensley and as I don't know about the politics behind the sport, it didn't worry me ,(as some US fans have critisized it for the lack interviews)
A fine set of DVD's",1268784000,,249,4.208333333333333
8293774,3,B001DJ69BG,"This DVD was at the top of my Christmas List.  In past years I have asked for and enjoyed the Winston 2002 and 2003 and the Nextel 2004 and 2005 and Chase For the Championship 2006 and 2007 and was so looking forward to the same type of format which would show interviews and commentary from the entire season.  This format is the 10 cup races..period.  The only direct interviews are with the winner and maybe with the runner up and very short.  If you missed the races and want to see the races.........this is fine.  If you want to learn about the entire season, then I think it will disappoint.  It is the 10 cup races which seems to me to present the idea that the whole season is the last 10 races.",1230681600,,704,4.2164179104477615
