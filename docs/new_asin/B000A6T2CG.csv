8075051,5,B000A6T2CG,"""The Blood Drinkers"" alone is worth the price. A stylish vampire film from the Philippines, ""Blood Drinkers"" makes interesting use of color and has a solid story that's as much about characters as it is about gore. A real find for fans of international horror. The picture looks as good as it probably did on American drive-in screens. Not pristine, but perfectly watchable. The DVD is packed with extras, including trailers for other cult horror films and an enjoyable commentary track by U.S. distributor Sam Sherman.

The other two films are rubbish, but rubbish of a very amusing, ""classic drive-in cheese"" variety. Both are films cobbled together by notorious Z-grade director Al Adamson from a combination of footage from other films and new footage shot to change the story completely, in a typically bizarre way. This was Adamson's preferred method of filmmaking, and makes for a pretty surreal viewing experience with wild shifts in tone and production value (not to mention cutting back and forth between two completely unrelated stories and different casts of characters).

""Horror of the Blood Monsters"", largely cannibalized from another Filipino film ""Tagani"" which was basically about vampire cavemen (awesome!), has obtained a minor cult status for its corny effects, crazy monsters, ludicrous sci-fi premise, and a scenery-chewing performance by the always welcome John Carradine. Make yourself a 10-year-old boy on a lazy Saturday and this movie will be perfect. Another Sam Sherman commentary track is included.

""Doctor Dracula"", another Al Adamson joint, is just rubbish. No cult status here. But the acting is hilarious, and you get Dracula PLUS Svengali PLUS a Satan you must see to believe. The boom mike has a hefty role, too.

These are three separate DVDs in their own separate cases. ""Blood Drinkers"" includes liner notes. Altogether a fun, worthwhile set for the monster movie junkie.",1338854400,,1913,5.241830065359477
