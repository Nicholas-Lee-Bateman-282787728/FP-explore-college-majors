8632685,5,B00HGT19CG,"The beyond is a supernatural zombie thriller directed by Italy's master of horror, Lucio Fulci, and filmed in New Orleans. If I had any complaint about this particular edition, it's that the DVD contains special features but is Region 2 and will NOT play on a standard DVD player. But the Blu-ray itself plays just fine.",1407628800,,320,4.732142857142857

8632687,5,B00HGT19CG,"This is the region free release from Arrow Video that I've been waiting for, because for once the product description was correct and it works like it should. I've had problems in the past with other Arrow Video releases being listed as Region free/all Regions only to find that it's limited to Region 2. Much to my surprise, this was not the case and this release is all Regions. The movie looks brighter instead of dark like other releases. Not the smoothest quality and not the absolute best transfer, it doesn't even look remastered from the original film negative but still looks like a pretty good mastering. I guess what I'm trying to say is that Blue Underground releases of other Fulci titles looked better but don't let that stop you. The steebook packaging features some well executed poster designs on the front and back and in the interior. Disc one is a Region ABC Blue-ray (should work on just about any Blu-ray player) which features the movie itself, some interviews, and 3 different audio commentaries. Disc 2 is a Region 0 DVD with several interviews, each with animated opening credit sequences in reference to The Beyond and other Fulci titles. Some of the other special features are the exact same to the US Grindhouse release, like the color opening sequence and just one of the Audio Commentaries but most of the special features are way different from that release which is a nice plus, along with a hidden easter egg on the Disc 1. I'd say all of the content on these discs are completely identical to the previous Arrow Video special edition of The Beyond and this release also contains the same 32 page collectors booklet. Only real gripe is that just 1 entire second is missing and the DVD disc did not work on my Blu-ray player (but totally did work on my DVD player/Xbox 360, just a word of warning). Other things to look out for: unlike the previous Arrow Release of this, it does NOT contain any posters and lobby cards). Those faults are hardly anything to complain about, it's a really good release but I'd mainly recommend this if you're a hardcore collector (and as long as you don't already have the previous Arrow Video collectors edition) and want some kind functioning Blu-ray of this movie (because a US Region A of this movie has yet to be released). All in all, it's a sound release with awesome packaging and nice features.",1388966400,,2368,4.667464114832536
