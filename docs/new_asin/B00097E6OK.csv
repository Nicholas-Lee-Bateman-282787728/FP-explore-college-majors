8057926,1,B00097E6OK,I only watched because God Awful Movies is going to be reviewing it next week. The protagonist appears to be climaxing when he puts on the glasses during class and the sexual tension between him and his sister is palpable. My favorite part was that it only lasted about half an hour.,1519430400,,283,4.461538461538462
8057927,5,B00097E6OK,"Shared this with our youth group years ago and it opens up a realm of discussion topics. This is a great tool in showing and explaining the spiritual battle that exists. Not the greatest special effects, but considering the time period, a great movie about spiritual warfare.",1518307200,,275,4.872340425531915
8057928,5,B00097E6OK,"Unique Christian horror movie, a guy can see and hear demons with special glasses. Christian movie with witness for Christ in the movie, not for kids.",1459728000,,150,4.8076923076923075
8057929,5,B00097E6OK,Excellent movie on warfare.  A suspenseful flick.  Great for high school or college small groups.  All believers need to see it.  Remember our warfare is not that which we can see.,1404777600,,180,4.709677419354839
8057930,5,B00097E6OK,"This is one film maker's interpretation of spiritual events as described in the Bible, applying them to the lives of several young people. This film brings to the forefront the realities of the unseen spiritual world, putting them into our perspective so that we can see our own lives and the world around us with spiritual eyes.
My husband and I are middle-aged grandparents and we loved this film. I showed it to my teenage nieces and one of their friends, and they were glued to it from beginning to end; plus it was excellent for opening dialog.
This film conveys an excellent message in an entertaining and suspenseful story.",1292889600,3,630,4.736363636363636
8057931,1,B00097E6OK,"The other night, my husband asked me if there was a reason why I am scared to death of demons and ghost.  I told him that when I was thirteen, I had been shown a film in youth group that had scared me to death.

So today, I went Googling for this film, thinking that I could find it and face my demons, so to speak.  I finally found it - it's this movie. ""Invisible Enemies,"" produced in 1997.

I remembered that the movie was about a boy who puts on a pair of glasses and and suddenly hears and sees demons everywhere. The night after I watched this movie in youth group was the first night I slept with my door open and every light upstairs on. I was scared to put on my glasses in the morning, thinking that I would start to see demons.

The most horrible thing about ""Invisible Enemies"" for me was that it meant that demons and ghosts were real.  This wasn't just a scary movie; the Christian grown-ups that showed me the film believed in demons.  That was the last time I ever felt safe in a church. I felt that no preacher or pastor could protect me.

I'm sure the special effects were hokey and stupid, that to an adult or older teenager this movie is not especially scary.  But to a younger kid, who had certainly never thought about demons and spiritual warfare before, it was very scary and hit very close to home.  To this day, I'm not able to watch movies about demons or ghosts. My husband argues that I ought to be afraid of more realistic horror films, like serial killers.  But thanks to this movie, I am still more afraid of being chased by demons than being murdered by a serial killer.

I've read about a number of people who were forced to watch the evangelical message films ""The Thief in the Night"" and ""Mark of the Beast,"" who were deeply traumatized by these films.  After watching these movies, kids grow up thinking that the rapture is going to happen at any minute, that demons are constantly surrounding them.  Who in their right minds would show movies like these to children?

I am no longer affiliated with any kind of organized religion, and this movie is partly why.  Kids shouldn't have to worry about their souls, or becoming spiritual warriors, or being chased by the devil.  The world is already pretty scary - why give your kids something else to be afraid of?",1287532800,3,2298,4.356807511737089
8057932,5,B00097E6OK,"I caught the last half of this movie one night while watching TBN. It was soo interesting and even the little bit I saw was full of wisdom. It has allowed me to see where those invisible enemies are working in my own life and I will not let them have their sneaky way anymore. They really are all around and their only agenda is to do evil and make/force others to do evil whether it be in your thoughts or your actions or the way you talk to and about other people.

Their only agenda is to kill, steal, and destroy! There is NOTHING at all good about those enemies. They just go around looking for the slightest little or wide door opening in someone's life so that they can influence or even possess a person and rule their lives. NONE OF THEIR POWER IS GREATER THAN THE POWER OF JESUS CHRIST! Jesus is the name above every name.

This movie makes it clear that we need to be fully armored so that we can fight the battle. :) Go  in victory. You're way above them if you have Jesus Christ. Use His power to fight against those Invisible Enemies.

8057933,1,B00097E6OK,"I love this type of movie, so I'm easy to please, but this one goes straight to my ever-growing list of ""Worst Films I've Ever Seen"".  The ""special effects"" of demons were laughable, as was the directing and ""acting"".  Very disappointing.

**Update 8/22/10:  I just re-read this and I swear to God I cannot remember a single solitary thing about the movie, except that it would've made great MST3K material.  < Sigh, I do so miss Joel and his robot crew.>",1196640000,3,455,4.567901234567901
8057934,2,B00097E6OK,"The acting is fairly questionable, in general.  It is a very early example of Jason Guess's work, and he's really cute with hair.  REALLY cute.  I am, however, biased.  The special effects are really quite humorous.  The plot, well, is thin.  The frequent references to Jesus are confusing and have little grounding in the rest of the story.  Good for an amusing half hour and some priceless quotations.  ""It's like the devil's collecting souls, and he's got like a zillion ways to do it.  He's trying to destroy us"".  It's pretty funny.  Oh, and Trip?  What a name!",1180051200,3,566,4.663265306122449
8057935,3,B00097E6OK,"Invisible Enemies is about the unseen involvement of demons in the ordinary affairs of people.  This ugly realm is seen thru the lens of a special pair of glasses found by the lead character.  When he puts on the glasses it's like a 6th sense kicks in enabling him to know, see and hear things (evil things) he couldn't naturally; for example, when driving by a house he can hear the arguing of a couple.  The 1980s fashion styles might seem odd for a DVD released in 2005, but it's no mistake, and it will make sense by the movie's end.  There's nothing complex about this low-budget flick that doesn't get much into the particulars of the devil's schemes, as do the books Screwtape Letters or Lord Foulgrin's Letters, but it's short enough and to the point enough to serve as a good conversation starter for a youth Bible study or a family discussion for pre-teens and up.

(For anyone interested in a much deeper, know-thy-enemy, personally equipping work of spiritual warfare fiction (though an audio not a DVD), I cannot recommend highly enough the audio version of ""Lord Foulgrin's Letters"" by Randy Alcorn.  Best heard, not just read, a sample is available for listening by clicking Amazon's link for the audio download listing of Lord Foulgrin's Letters.)",1169251200,10,1263,4.770642201834862
