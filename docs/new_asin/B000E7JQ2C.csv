8106924,5,B000E7JQ2C,"With a Filipina wife' Calvary Command, was a 'must have' movie. It's a bit dated and follows the Hollywood 'formula"" for movies of that time but still different enough to be enjoyable for those who like cavalry movies. There are aspects of Filipino culture that are as true today as they were when the film was made. From the traditional 'candle dance' (like our square dance it's kept alive and yes they do wear those puffy sleeves on certain dresses). The Hill People are a different culture (just like the Highlanders are from Lowlanders are in Scotland) all in all I liked Calvary Command. I never watched Cotter so I can't comment on it.",1431475200,,642,4.640350877192983
