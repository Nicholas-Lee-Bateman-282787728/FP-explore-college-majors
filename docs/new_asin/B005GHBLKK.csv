8471549,5,B005GHBLKK,"This is a great instructional for HEMA enthusiasts and fills an important void in many current schools of historical fencing. For example, the Lichtenauer teachings are widely taught to everyone including new students who have no prior fencing knowledge and this was not Master Lichtenauers intent. Common fencing was a prerequisite and such techniques are very well demonstrated in this video from the perspective of a living Portuguese tradition. Utilizing these drills will increase one mastery of the necessary skills of blocking, parrying, distance and timing. These skills should be mastered before one begins learning winding and binding techniques.",1466726400,3,656,5.636363636363637
8471550,5,B005GHBLKK,"This is an excellent training DVD to show you how to use  long sword for people who are into improving their skills to be a better knight for the next  Ren. Fair  ,or for me to be better with a  sword for the next Pirate Festival. What is even better is the fact that the price for this DVD will not stab a hole in your wallet compared to some other Sword training DVDs.",1404864000,,370,3.9594594594594597
8471551,5,B005GHBLKK,"If I want an inception of action that inspires me to work the blade--at whatever length and number of opponents--a certain type of movie is needed, Should I, however, want to learn how best to be disciplined by the blade so it forms me to its use, I prefer a well-conceived, short, and almost mechanically repetitive tutorial. Preto and his sparring partner deliver and delightfully so. More, it is clear it is delivered with the intent to delight in the martial art of the western blade. That it is called fencing brings to focus what your training must entail.

The best thing to be said about this tutorial is that by its end you want to find the training its preparation promises. Most blade tutorials seem crafted to generate far too many _Highlander_ routines; this one thankfully makes you want to learn the blade in order to know the logic behind the responses you are making reflexive through training. Well done.",1380499200,,922,4.726708074534161
8471552,3,B005GHBLKK,Be sure to read the product description carefully it says it is for ADVANCED beginners.  I just got the DVD and was very excited to watch it but ended up disappointed.  It does not go over any of the basics like basic moves and their names.  It mainly goes over things like maintaining correct distance and  parrying well. If you don't know the basics this DVD will not make much sense to you or be very helpful.  It is also very short: like 9 short segments.,1358035200,4,459,4.290697674418604
8471553,4,B005GHBLKK,"This DVD is a nice, short introduction to some logical training strategies on striking, parrying and tactical application with longswords. Actually, it looks like pretty classic Jogo do Pau to my eyes, and Luis could just have easily substitued the normal longstick for the nylon longswords used.

But that doesn't matter, the material is what counts and it is very good, albeit a bit too brief (I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the brevity - I wanted to see a lot more and would happily have sat through a DVD that was double or triple the run time here). As good as Luis' books are, I would like to see more DVDs from him, as seeing drills and exercises performed in motion is just so much more useful than just reading about them and having to mentally visualise them from static photographs.",1352073600,,804,4.506849315068493
