8393460,1,B0002BBUKG,"In this DVD, Dr. Alexander attempts to explain the strategic concepts found within Sun Tzu's 13 chapters and apply them to tactical martial arts examples. Unfortunately, his treatment of each chapter is over simplified, and he often misses the central lessons found in each chapter. After watching the DVD, I felt it failed to convey the depth and scope of the large amount of tactical lessons found in each of the chapters in Sun Tzu.",1418860800,,435,4.8133333333333335

8393464,1,B0002BBUKG,"I have been a Martial Artist for almost 27 years and have trained for many years in TKD, Judo and American Kenpo Karate and am a Kenpo Instructor at a local school; I currently run a Martial Arts program for the United States Military.  I have read several Versions of ""Sun Tzu's The Art of War."" and this DVD completely missed the mark, it really has almost nothing to do with Sun Tzu's work.  Although the author seems to be a very Skilled Martial Artist in his own right, the DVD is basically a show case or perhaps an instructional video on his version of self defense techniques that I imagine he teaches in his Dojo to his students.  The DVD really does not address Sun Tzu's work, it only makes references to some of Sun Tzu's statements and makes a very feeble attempt to apply their true meaning to a self defense technique of his choosing.  The relationship of the Karate techniques to the sayings is what the DVD is all about; it is basically an instructional video in his system making vague references to a great work.  The sound fades in and out, it uses very primitives editing, and the cinematography is of a very poor nature all adding up to a mediocre at best presentation with very minimal emphasis on the true nature of Sun Tzu's material.  The DVD is not worth your while unless you are one of his students.  If you want to learn what Sun Tzu had to say, buy one of the many books on the market, they are short, easy to read and of course unparalleled, Amazon.com carries many to choose from.",1099958400,24,1513,4.382142857142857
