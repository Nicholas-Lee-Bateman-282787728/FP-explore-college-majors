8206791,1,B000SSONQG,"Boring schlock.  And this ""actress"" is the not the famed cellist Jacqueline Dupres is ""her only film role"". Just a name stolen for one movie.
The cover image is nowhere in the movie.  Satan never appears or speaks. Just plain dumb.",1404604800,2,231,4.609756097560975
8206792,4,B000SSONQG,"I purchased this DVD, Director Mario Bianchi's 'SATAN'S BABY DOLL' aka 'LA BIMBA DI SATANA'-1980 a few years back and was hesitant on watching it because at the time there was not alot written about it and all I had known was that it was a remake of Director Andrea Bianchi's 'MALABIMBA'- 1979, a film which I thought was pretty wild for its time.  An Italian Horror that has a reputation of being an ultra sleaze experience, there seems to be at least three versions of 'MALABIMBA' out there and Severin films has both the tame and XXX hard core versions available.  The XXX version is basically how some of the early Seventies Horrors of Director Jess Franco were handled, hardcore scenes were inserted to beef up the sleaze quotient and were not necessary to the narrative.  I also thought that Director Mario Bianchi was related to Andrea but that was false also.  He is the son of Director Roberto Montero and has the same last name of Bianchi also (confused?, so am I). Having been wrongly compared to the original and for some viewers may come up a bit short in the gore factor, this film emerges as an enjoyable version of the same 'MALABIMBA' plot with the same actress Mariangela Giordano this time playing a wannabe nun who is the Yoda-like aid to the Aguilar family in the story.  Spaghetti Western villain Aldo Sambrell plays the sleazy monarch of the household who has slain his wife played by Marina Frajese who's spirit,in turn, enters the young body of uber-teen Jacqueline Dupre causing her to become a sexual succubus in order to expose her murderer.  Bianchi directs competently slowing down the sleaze factor and concentrating on erotic sequences unfortunately bogged down with a tepid music score by Nico Catanese.  There is also nice camerawork by Angelo Lanutti especially in a sequence where we are placed at the bottom of a wheelchair and being wheeled along with the actor throughout the corridors of the castle.  The script by Piero Regnoli is virtually identical but is given a better adaptation this time around.  Giordano also worked for Andrea Bianchi in his Zombie guilty pleasure 'BURIAL GROUND' aka 'LE NOTTE DEL TERRORE' -1980 notorious for having her breast bitten off by her zombie son.  There is also a great 18 minute interview with the director 'EXORCISM OF BABY DOLL' who has a great memory of the shoot and also discusses his early film experiences as a director of Spaghetti Westerns and talks about the Nunsploitation genre.  He also has a great story of how Horror Maestro Lucio Fulci hired Bianchi to complete his film 'SODOMA'S GHOST' aka 'I FANTASMI DI SODOMA'- 1988 shooting 1/3 of the production and helping Fulci complete but not receiving any credit or thank you.  There is also an Italian Trailer included.  Severin Films has a gorgeous 1.85 transfer from the Italian negative in its original language with English Subtitles.  As Bianchi apologizes in the interview for having the film look cheap on account of the lack of budget, he more than makes up for it in atmosphere and I hope my review will guide Euro fans to purchasing this underrated film from the last years of true Italian horror.",1346976000,7,3148,4.784132841328414
8206793,3,B000SSONQG,"Had much more potential.  The blurbs I have read about it don't pay off.  It does not contain as much scare value, or erotic suggestion that you might expect it to carry.  This is a case where the cover is better than the film.  I do like the look of the film, and don't mind the slow pacing, but, if you are going to cover these horror themes you best give it all you got for entertainment sake.  Only worth a rental, not a purchase in my opinion.  Interview with the director is better than the film.",1193702400,40,502,4.123711340206185
