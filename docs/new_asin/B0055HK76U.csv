4578414,5,B0055HK76U,"Nick Kroll always brings it.  UCB, The League, numerous characters on Comedy Bang Bang, etc.  Super talent.  It's nice to finally see the characters brought to life on TV.",1325376000,4,171,4.827586206896552
4578415,4,B0055HK76U,"Nick's stand-up is very good but it's the sketch work in this special that I really liked the most, especially the ""Oh, Hello"" segments with John Mulaney. Their scenes waiting on line to get in the club, and then sitting at the bar having tuna tini's is are greatness. Even the outtakes of these two are pretty much gold. As shown on Comedy Central, this was edited down and also had the naughty words bleeped, so along with the bonus stuff, this DVD is worth it for sure.",1319500800,4,472,4.375
4578416,5,B0055HK76U,"These characters are hilarious. Kroll is a genius. If you are shocked his show is over and have not seen this, you have to see it. If you never saw Kroll Show, watch this and you will go find his show to get more of this very unique comedic artist.",1433894400,,248,3.98
4578417,2,B0055HK76U,"I loved the Kroll show, but I had to turn this off.  When Kroll started his own stand-up routine (after his character ""Bobby Bottle Service"" did the opening number), he immediately starting talking about the DMV. I thought this was a joke, because I feel like a comedian talking about  how weird people are in the DMV is a huge clich. As I continued to watch I realized he was not ""joking"" and was actually trying to be funny. I was very disappointed, but I will always be a fan of Kroll Show.",1432857600,,493,4.290322580645161
4578418,3,B0055HK76U,It was ok.  I love nick kroll but I didn't find myself laughing as much as I thought I would.  If you watch the kroll show you might find yourself bored halfway through as he uses the same characters but if not you might enjoy watching this.,1430265600,,241,4.1063829787234045

4578422,5,B0055HK76U,One of the most ridiculous displays I have subjected myself to. I loved every moment.,1419811200,,85,4.733333333333333
4578423,5,B0055HK76U,This guy is hilarious.  I like everything he does.,1418774400,,50,4.555555555555555
4578424,2,B0055HK76U,Not nearly as funny as his series - and he's a bit racially offensive without getting a Mulligan for being hilarious or clever or original. He's far better when he's got input from a team of writers - his sketch show on comedy central is the incredible.,1415664000,,253,4.404255319148936
4578425,5,B0055HK76U,Very funny,1415404800,,10,4.5
4578426,5,B0055HK76U,"His humor is probably something you either love or hate. I personally love Nick Kroll in anything, whether it's this, The League, or The Kroll Show. The stand-up parts of this tape are my favorites, but a few of the skits are pretty funny too. Nick Kroll has a way of taking what should be tired old themes (cat or dog? airport security) and making them fresh. Not suitable for kids, but fairly mild and inoffensive for adults.",1402358400,,427,4.487179487179487
4578427,1,B0055HK76U,"I like his show, but this is like if his show ate its own foot and then puked up bits of bone, flesh, and tendons, swimming in a pool of bloody vomit. Thats basically what you are watching with this ""movie"". Dont bother.",1395705600,2,220,4.1395348837209305
4578428,5,B0055HK76U,"I think the best part about this special is its unique nature, it's not a straight hour of Nick being Nick, which i'd still watch the hell out of, but he lets his character work fill out the special as well, something that any fan of Kroll Show can widely appreciate. It's awesome that each character isn't just a separated bit, but that he instead finds a way to weave them all together, so that not only is this a stand up special, but somewhat of a ""story"" as well.

 I'd look forward to potentially seeing a second special of a similar format out of him, especially since i feel like just from watching his recent work that he's got this amazing energy that deserves to be seen. His material is funny, realistically easy to relate to, and a blast to watch....especially scenes where he's interacting with himself.

Comedy is subjective and what's funny to some might not be funny to all, but i feel like you'd be lying if you say you didn't laugh at least once during this special. I've watched this multiple times and have found a new reason to laugh every single time. I said this on his Kroll Show review and i'll say it again, i think Nick just ""gets"" comedy. His characters are honest, sometimes too honest but i think that's what makes them so enjoyable. I think if you give this special a chance you'll be pleasantly surprised.",1392595200,,1338,4.453061224489796
4578429,1,B0055HK76U,"I liked the league so much, this made me sad. It was just cringworthy through the whole thing. Forced laughs and really bad skits. It is too bad, I think Nick Kroll is very talented, this just didn't work out.",1387065600,3,209,4.25
4578430,5,B0055HK76U,"After watching the Kroll show we found this on Amazon Prime and it was free to watch for a while but then they pulled it from the free lineup - so I had to buy it. It's hilarious!! Did you know Mindy Kaling is in this?? Briefly, but it's still her! <3

Bobby Bottleservice is my all time favorite and my entire family walks around talking like him and quoting scenes from his sketches. Buy this DVD, you won't regret it! Nick Kroll is one super funny, super talented guy who knows the deal with cats!",1374796800,,500,4.208333333333333
4578431,3,B0055HK76U,"It's hit or miss with Nick Kroll.  Some of his characters are awesome and others, meh. He's very good at emulating New Yorkers.",1367539200,,127,4.521739130434782
4578432,2,B0055HK76U,"As said in the title, it has its moments. But othrt than that its not funny. Its very dragged out im the begining and starts late",1361836800,,129,4.0
4578433,5,B0055HK76U,This was  incredibly funny. Nick kroll is very entertaining. The comedy is original and fresh. He made me laugh from beginning to end. I was sad when it was over. Happy that the kroll show is on comedy central ;). He is for sure one of the funniest comedians ever!,1361750400,,264,4.28
4578434,4,B0055HK76U,"I really hope Nick Kroll finds a way to do an entire special revolving around the ""Oh hello"" guys.  I've seen them before and was really happy they were on this DVD.  I cry laughing when I watch them.

The rest of the special was pretty good.  I'm a die hard fan of Nick Kroll so I may be biased but I think he is a very, very funny man.  His characters could use a little work maybe but that's the only fault I'll find.",1351036800,,420,3.8941176470588235
4578435,2,B0055HK76U,"I watched this special (streaming via Netflix) last night.  I was unfamiliar with Nick Kroll but I like stand-up, and had just watched a documentary about stand-up (""I Am Comic"") in which Kroll had the funniest bit - a protracted fake-sob story about his mother.  I won't spoil the punchline, but while Kroll's tears proved to be phony, mine were very real, brought on by a minute of nearly-painful laughter.  I had to see what else this guy had done, and Netflix had this special waiting for me.

Ultimately I was somewhat disappointed.  The stand-up was solid, with some extremely funny jokes mixed in with pretty typical material.  From the standpoint of someone who obsesses over the work of Louis CK, Patton Oswalt, David Cross (though his last special was rather dire), Todd Barry, and others, Kroll seemed like a guy who could be that good eventually, but isn't yet.  He has a few good ideas though, and a great delivery that elevates even rather hackneyed material (why cats are worse than dogs [spoiler: it's because dogs love you and cats don't], Michael Jackson looked weird after the plastic surgery, etc.).

Unfortunately, the stand-up occupied only about 75% of the running time.  The rest was devoted to extremely broad characters out of mediocre sketch comedy.  The flamboyantly gay set-dresser, the incomprehensible and over-excited Hispanic DJ, the macho ""seh-kurr-ity"" guy who feels up chicks.  This all felt very out of place next to his relatively (emphasis on that word) low-key and reality-based stand-up work.

Advice for Kroll, not that he's asking for it: keep the characters in whatever sketch comedy you do, and treat your stand-up (which shows some promise) as its own thing.  They're very different spheres of comedy that just don't overlap well.",1330387200,3,1776,5.0

8458391,1,B0055HK76U,"Could not get past 10 minutes of it,,, I love Nick kroll especially when he played Ruxin on the league. One of my favorite shows. But save your money with out a doubt it's not even worth $1.00. I personally wouldn't give it one star",1492387200,,232,4.177777777777778

I don't think I laughed more than 5 times. The Kroll Show is 5 stars, this is 2.",1438992000,3,241,4.041666666666667
