7808534,5,6300276996,"I LOVED this video as a child and plan on sharing it with my children...my only complaint has nothing to do with the video. There are so many Disney Classics that have been put onto DVD and this needs to be another one. I have looked all over the web for Pluto and Fifi on DVD! And I have had no luck in my searches! I know that there are DVD /VHS recorder players that allow you to record your VHS tapes onto DVDs, but I do not have that many VHS tapes to spend the money on another electronic device I do not need...guess I can find a cheap VHS player at a garage sale or resale shop...because these CLASSICS are MUST BUYS!!!!",1335398400,,628,4.07258064516129
