2672150,5,B000JJ4DF0,"yes, at times hemalayaa goes a little fast to follow the first time around, but exact replication isn't the point.

this video is tons of fun.  the moves are very accurate to modern bollywood films.  and the go-at-your-own-pace attitude is refreshing.  i just tried this video for the first time right after recovering from strep throat, while still having a cough and i was able to keep up perfectly fine.  resting when i need to.  and the more you do this video, the more you'll be able to keep up with the festive dance moves.",1170288000,4,529,4.515789473684211
2672151,5,B000JJ4DF0,"I just got this in the mail and tried it out today. This was hysterical fun and the time sailed by. Thanks for an interesting, joyful workout!",1169856000,,142,4.296296296296297
2672152,5,B000JJ4DF0,"My Mom (who is usually more comfortable on the couch in front of the TV) wanted to do this with me -- huge change since I can NEVER seem to get her to exercise.

I loved it and shimmied around and broke a sweat and caught some new moves for the dance floor.  (Gorilla shoulders is a lot of work but it LOOKS GREAT!)  While she wasn't able to do all the moves or to keep up with me, she had a blast going at her own pace and we ended up laughing big time!  But she wanted me to leave it at her house so she could practice.

I'm so happy to have found a workout fun enough to get her moving!",1169683200,6,589,3.7560975609756095
2672153,5,B000JJ4DF0,"If you're looking for a fun alternative to the same old workout and you like to dance to groovin' music, give this one a try. Hemalayaa is very likeable and makes each move easy and acessible. Before I knew it I felt like I was in a scene from Bride & Prejudice. It's great fun and I broke a nice sweat. What more can you ask for in a workout?",1169683200,5,343,3.914285714285714
2672154,5,B000JJ4DF0,"I really hate ""exercising,"" but as I've recently become a big fan of Hindi film and the dance styles therein, I thought this DVD might be fun--and I was so right! Drawn from a variety of sources (bhangra, yoga stretching, pop beats) it's a really fun workout for any fitness level. The workout is divided into several sections; in each one, the instructor demonstrates at a do-able, learnable speed and once you're warmed up and have a grasp of the moves, she moves into a double-time speed. I'm nearing 60, and a bit sedentary, so I do have to slow down from time to time and just stick with the slow speed--and there's also a fair amount of hopping or jumping, so foot-pain sufferers will need to be cautious--but I'm getting better, and if I can do it, anyone can! Hemalayaa (the instructor) is awfully cheerful, but there is an option to do the workout without the narrative--you still have the music, but not the voice. Another plus: bhangra dance is really getting popular all over; this is a great introduction to some of the moves. Spice up your routine, learn something new, and have fun!",1169683200,13,1097,4.6020408163265305
2672155,2,B000JJ4DF0,I suppose when i got this i thought there would be more traditional dance mixed in but it is mainly modern street dancing. It reminded me of a music video. I thought i would try different kinds of dance videos to spice up my workout routine. I have an Island girl video and i love it. But this one is not for the faint of heart. If you have knee problems or back or neck problems i would advise you against buying this. She does alot of flayling about that gave me a headache. I felt silly doing most of these moves. Especially the face excersises. She goes to fast and i felt like i was just jumping around most of the time. I also disliked the naration tract over the video. The extra preformance you can watch looks like sleepovers i had when i was a kid and was fooling around with my friends.,1169596800,7,797,4.148387096774194
2672156,5,B000JJ4DF0,"I rarely review items but this workout is so sexy and fun, I felt compelled to spread the word! You get to dance with abandon in ""Bollywood"" style in the privacy of your home. You work through all the parts of your body and you feel limber and supple after you're done.  It gets my day off to a great start!",1169510400,6,307,4.032786885245901
2672157,5,B000JJ4DF0,"The workout is fun and although I am an advanced exerciser I enjoyed the video.  She constantly tells the viewer to move at their own pace if she is too fast.  Therefore, beginners can move on their own and do the easy base moves she provides.  If you are advanced, you can also enjoy a great 40 minute workout on days that you don't want to really push it.  That's what I use this video for.  It's just enough cardio.",1168387200,14,418,4.175
2672158,5,B000JJ4DF0,"I know it is a workout dvd, how can it be fun!? But really, Hemalyaa (and please don't ask me how to pronounce that name. I have no idea, sadly.) approaches the workout as playtime and makes the individual segments very enjoyable. The time just seems to fly by which is especially weird for an exercise dvd!

The dance ""playtime"" is exactly what you would expect to see in a Bollywood film. It combines hip-hop, basic belly dance, and just plain fun body movement to form a style that looks execptionally easy and fun- when Hemalyaa does it, not me. I probably look like a floundering chicken. But I don't care! I still had fun and it was a definite workout particulary in the upper thighs.

The choreography goes fast but is pretty well explained and they always redo all of the movements, so even when you feel like you have no idea what you are supposed to be doing the dancers will suddenly go back to moves that you have already mastered. Sometimes it is just fun to watch them dance for a minute- and I say that not just because I was slacking for that minute!",1168300800,216,1066,4.378787878787879

2672173,3,B000JJ4DF0,"I wanted to do a little more Bollywood style dancing, and this was more bangra, which is fun too. The workout was not too hard, but she did a good job noting how you could make it a little harder or easier at each phase. I know it's tough to make these videos appealing, without making them too soft-core flirty in that super-awkward way. Good news is she never licked her lips at the camera, which I've seen before on other workout videos. ;) I rented this one to see how it went, and I'll probably buy it",1460073600,,506,4.173469387755102

2672186,5,B000JJ4DF0,"I love this workout video. I am not a fan of videos that required me to pick up weights and put weights down, get on the floor and stand back up only to get back on the floor. This video was broken up into a warm-up, legwork out, arm and core work out, floor routine and then putting it all together for a little dance routine. It's intense enough that you feel like you got a good workout and feel good about it too.

The dancers seemed like they knew what they where doing and had a pleasant look, but I don't think that this video is for beginners and I felt like a duck flailing around on the ground.  Um, no.

The arm moves really opened up the muscles in my arms and back. It felt really good.

2672229,5,B000JJ4DF0,I think this is such an exciting workout all because Hemalayaa has a beautiful smile on the whole time.

She's about getting your body worked up in a sweat and smiling while doing it. She stressed often not to push your body if it can't move a certain way, so this isn't a push to the limits body workout. It's helpful to start with the first couple segments for a few days then add the next and the next. Work your body up to it. It's taken me at least a week of this to work up to the last segment and be more graceful with the moves.

2672250,3,B000JJ4DF0,I was so hoping that it would be a collection of her 1/2 hour shows on Veria TV which meld spiritual wisdom from India with explanations of mudras etc into a workout.

It's 50 mins. long and I was getting tired by the end.  Later in the day my body was feeling good and my back was loosened up.  If you have bad knees this may be a little tougher for you as there is a segment with a lot of jumping on 1 leg but you could skip that part and still get a decent workout.,1389830400,,456,3.71875

2672263,4,B000JJ4DF0,I really enjoy this video. It's a little silly but the girls make it feel non-judgemental. The dance moves are great and even my 5 year old likes doing it. It's a nice change from my normal work out routine.,1389657600,,207,4.2
2672264,3,B000JJ4DF0,"Could be fun once I get used to it, but im having problems the first time through. I don't like when the people on screen aren't in sync with each other. It distracts me to no end! Also with the cut aways when switching from one move to another, sometimes the movements aren't on beat. *sigh*

 Also, there is no kind of warning before you transition into another move, she just kind of throws you into it, so I found myself stopping trying to see what she changed to. She'll start doing double time and 3or4 movements into she'll finally say it. So if you weren't looking at the screen (for spinning around or whatever) theyve moved on to something else and you missed it.

They spend alot of time focusing on her face instead of showing what her body is doing. *shrug* I probably should have tried to instant video this before I bought it for full price....Hopefully ill get to liking it eventually.... but after the first try, I don't feel like I burned any calories. While I did get a little warm from the moving around, I did not break a sweat.

I STOLE THE FOLLOWING FROM A FELLOW REVIEWER BECAUSE SHE WAS DEAD ON WITH THIS.....

*The cueing is off; Hemalayaa will be doing one thing and the two women behind her will be doing something else, or they will be a half-step behind.
 *The verbal cues to the person at home are off; the best comparison I can make is to a sports commentator talking about things other people are doing as -- or slightly after -- they happen. It's almost like she's surprised at what comes next.

2672271,2,B000JJ4DF0,"I will start this off by saying that I am not a dancer, by any stretch of the imagination.  I am neither graceful nor coordinated and I was always the kid in ballet class turning the wrong way.  I have trouble following complicated choreography.  Nonetheless, sometimes I like to attempt dance-style exercise DVDs in the privacy of my own living room.  (For what it's worth, I know next to nothing about Bollywood-style or bhangra dance.)  This information is all just to give you some perspective on my review.

First, some things I liked about the DVD:

*The set is pretty and appropriate
*I didn't find the choreography difficult to follow, even with my (lack of) background
*I thought the clothing worn by the participants was suitable for an exercise DVD (reminded me a bit of bellydancing get-up but with wide-legged pants instead of yoga pants or skirts)
*The women (Hemalayaa as well as her two companions) were slender, but had feminine bodies and did not look like fitness models
*Segments with clearly-delineated beginnings and ends mean you can choose just a couple to do if you're pressed for time

And some things I didn't care for:

*The music was irritating (each segment had its own music, but they were very short pieces of music played on an endless loop)
*Hemalayaa talks too much (I understand there's an option to turn this off, though I haven't explored all the DVD menus in depth)
*The cueing is off; Hemalayaa will be doing one thing and the two women behind her will be doing something else, or they will be a half-step behind
*The verbal cues to the person at home are off; the best comparison I can make is to a sports commentator talking about things other people are doing as -- or slightly after -- they happen.  It's almost like she's surprised at what comes next.
*The woman in the blue top and black pants doesn't always look particularly happy to be there; she doesn't smile very often (Hemalayaa and the woman in red pants seem happy enough)
*The camera work was, at times, quite annoying; there'd be a white flash or a moment where the screen went black, and when the picture came back, the participants were on to different moves or were now half a beat off what I had been doing in time with them, previously

Some notes on the segments:

Warming: I understand that this style of dance makes heavy use of the neck and head, and while I appreciate the amount of time dedicated to this, other areas were lacking.  There really wasn't enough focus on the large muscles of the legs (at least not for a suitable length of time).  The performers didn't do any sort of count, so it was difficult to tell if the same moves were done equally on both sides.  Speeds of moves changed without warning at times.  And sometimes, you just couldn't see what the participants were doing because of the camera angle.

Playtime Begins: This segment has a lot of lower body work and so can partly be considered an extension of the warmup for the legs and hips.  There are some really deep plis here and a lot of spinning in circles.  The background dancers are definitely out of sync at times, and this segment contained some of the white flashes I mentioned earlier.  These made me think that perhaps some bits had been edited out and the rest had not been spliced back together particularly well.

Footwork: This segment has some full body movements, walking, head shaking, and a bit more.  The camera angle changes seemingly at random.

Now We're Hot!: I did not find this segment to be hard on my knees, but I can see how it might affect some people.  There are a lot of bouncing plis in this segment and a lot of hopping on one leg.  One thing that bothered me a bit was the line: ""allow it [your knee] to be the shock absorber.""  I do have bad knees, and while this segment didn't bother me, physically, I'm not too keen on knees as shock absorbers!

Ground Play: THIS was the segment that hurt my knees.  There are some squats where you go down so far, your rear end is almost on the ground between your heels.  Later, you BOUNCE into this position.  The only warning is: ""try that a few times and see if it's okay on your knees.""  I really have to back off on this one for fear of injury.  There's a bit of ab work on the ground that's not too bad, though.

Playful Dance: The other two women mysteriously disappeared for this segment.  This segment involves a fair amount of jumping around, including something like a ski jump and a ""running man"" move.  Unfortunately, due to the camera angle, you can't see Hemalayaa's legs for a large part of this.

Cool It Now!: This segment's camera work left a lot to be desired, as well.  It's not a bad cool down; it involves gentle stretching with movements that are not held for too long.  The last bit might be hard on your knees if you have bad knees like I do.  The only thing I really don't care for is that it gets a bit boring and repetitive.

Who would this be good for?  I can think of a couple of instances in which you might want to use this DVD.  One way I have used it in the past is to do a couple of segments as warm-ups before weightlifting/strength training.  This way, I can avoid segments that I know would hurt my knees, but still have a little cardio to get moving so I'm not lifting weights with cold muscles.  It's just not intense enough on its own to burn a lot of calories and to constitute a full workout for someone like me, who is fairly experienced as an exerciser.  This *might* be good for a beginning exerciser who knows her limits in terms of knee function, or who doesn't have knee trouble to begin with.  The impact is mostly low with some higher-impact moves (e.g., jumps).  You do not have to be particularly coordinated.

I can live with the music, I suppose.  I think if the production value -- editing, syncing, voiceovers/cueing, coordination of moves among Hemalayaa and the backup dancers -- had been higher, I'd've rounded up to 3 stars.  This had a lot of potential that, unfortunately, it really didn't live up to.  It might work for some people (see the previous paragraph), but it had some major flaws and it really wasn't right for me.

The running time for the entire workout is about 50 minutes.",1376870400,3,6217,4.471162377994676
2672282,4,B000JJ4DF0,"So, one should know that this video is ""follow along."" This means that the instructor does the dancing with you. It is relatively medium paced and for someone that's never done it this might be a little fast. However, I liked the pace after the instruction was over. It's also important to mention that the voice over instruction is often wrong or in the wrong place. So, ignoring it and just following the visuals is the best way to do this video. Overall, it's fun, has a good pace once the instruction is done, and has relatively good music. The mistakes in the video show poor production quality, but the instruction itself makes up for this.

It's more low impact than running (though there are a couple of exercises involving jumping around), and more fun (unless you enjoy running).  There are a couple parts where the instructor gets a bit silly (like face stretches), but she has a good positive attitude.  The backup dancers need to learn how to smile, lol.  My biggest complaint is that I would like more slow, clear-cut instructions because I'm a really slow learner when it comes to dancing, and I have very little natural coordination.

2672295,3,B000JJ4DF0,"First - this is not for people with knee problems. There will be too much (literal) hopping around, and too often knees will be twisted or stressed sideways.

I thought this would be a slam dunk lovefest for me, as I prefer any workouts I can do barefoot. I loved the music from the start. The rest was a mix of pros and cons for me, though. Here's the basic format:

Warming - 6 minutes
Playtime Begins - 7 minutes
Footwork - 6 minutes
Now we're hot! - 8 minutes
Ground Play - 6 minutes
Playful Dance - 5 minutes
Cool it now! - 9 minutes
Bonus performances - 6 minutes

Overall - the great and catchy music is somewhat dampened by her slightly too loud, dubbed in after the fact narration. Prepare to be annoyed by her announcing the move change *after* it happens, many times. Luckily, it comes with the option to turn off that narration track and watch it with music only; definitely something I'd do on the 3rd or 4th go around.

This is not at all a low quality looking production. Unfortunately, it did suffer from some bad editing, meaning if you are following the music and the narration, there will be visual cuts often that will result in the girls on screen being suddenly off rhythm, or to have switched sides, that will cause a couple seconds of confusion.

Warming - unless you know a bit about classical indian dance, prepare to be confused why you're doing so many seemingly odd face or neck-specific stretching. Those really won't come into play later in the video, though, other than being reminded to smile.

Playtime - you are about to spend most of this time dizzy. You'll be whipping your head about a bunch in combination with a lot of spinning moves. I don't know if the disorientation was worse for me, because I was trying to watch what to do at the same time my head naturally would have been following my body moving away from the direction of the TV, though. Perhaps more tolerable if you've memorized the routine a bit after a few rounds.

Footwork - it starts easy but, as one of the other reviewers noted, you're going to feel clumsy compared to her once it goes double time. At this point, you realize why she's been mentioning so much  not to worry about rhythm and form and just keep moving.

Now we're Hot - There's no way this portion of the workout can be easily adapted to low impact. Here's where your hopping around on one foot laterally will come in. You will indeed feel the burn in your entire lower body, even from the beginning of the segment.

Ground play - I loved the way she approached what would otherwise be boring, basic crunches in other classes. Highly recommend. These are moves I'll be using from here on out.

Cool down - definitely turn off the narration for this part, if you haven't already, for a nice, relaxing cool down. It was only at this point, with some reeeeeeally slow pans and close ups of her hips and chest, that it occured to me the cameraman might have a thing for her.",1364169600,,2944,4.413284132841328

2672321,3,B000JJ4DF0,"This will make you break a sweat but is not a very intense workout.  Some of the moves are hard on the knees (the krishna hops and the ""squats"") so if you have bad knees improvise.  The biggest problem with this workout is that while it is intented to be somewhat free-flowing and improvisational, the voice cues come after the transitions making it difficult to follow in many parts.  Still it was a nice change of pace with pretty scenery and was fun to do.",1341014400,2,459,4.376470588235295

2672323,3,B000JJ4DF0,"Hemalyaa is a fun instructor, so I would say that she makes more of the workout than is actually there. It's kind of a goofy workout, maybe good for days when you don't want to take yourself too seriously. My problem with it is that it's just too high-impact for my taste. I guess I was expecting it to be low-impact from the description and from seeing a preview on Youtube. But in actuality there's a lot of hopping and jumping that's more on the high-impact side. Honestly, the moves are a bit too masculine for my taste. I go more for feminine moves. But if you like high-impact and don't mind the silliness, this could be a good choice for you. It will give you a thorough workout, from your thighs to your shoulders.

If you're looking for a piece Hindi choreography, forget it. The performance section is just some more goofing around, the fun of which is, unfortunately, ruined by too many video effects. But if you're looking for a high-impact workout that doesn't take itself too seriously, go ahead and give this a try.",1336953600,,1030,4.508021390374331

It actually gave me a little sweat, and i love the moves. My fave is the middle part where we work out the core and abs and legs o something the part where you jump alot and then go onto the floor to work abs. It actually works! my legs look awesome, great stressbuster too.",1334102400,,442,3.8152173913043477

2672327,4,B000JJ4DF0,"As a former dancer I was concerned this might be too easy. However it's not and I even worked up a sweat and felt the burn in my hips and thighs. I'm pleasantly surprised. More advanced users can contentrate on perfecting form to look exactly as Hemalayaa does. And on that note, I might even say some dance experience is of benefit here. While beginners can do this, the moves are difficult enough that I would not be comfortable performing them in public without practice. Overall a fun workout and great practice if I'm ever invited to an Indian wedding! I think I'm going to check out her dance routine workout to see if I can find an even more challenging workout to keep up my interest.",1331510400,,692,4.456692913385827
2672328,5,B000JJ4DF0,"I hate working out and on top of that I have a bit of a disability to contend with which in my own mind gives me every excuse in the book to avoid any ""organized"" form of exercise. I've decided that 2012 is the year to get my a** - ummm,.... *act* together, especially health-wise so I've made a commitment to find ways to improve my health and fitness levels. In doing so I had to find inspiring and fun ways to stick with a program that works for me. Luckily I found this DVD which IMO is the perfect solution for those like me that need a little FUN in their workout.

Others have described the program at length so I won't go into detail their but I will confirm, yup she does the classic pole dancer hair toss and sexy eyes and you need to be okay with that. I'm more than okay with that - since no one is critiquing me in my living room, I do the sexy eyes right along with her! Beautiful setting and great music, btw!

Edited to add: The DVD features the following sections:

Warm Up - 6 minutes
Playtime Begins - basic steps 7 minutes
Footwork - Fancier steps to burn calories 6 minutes
Now We're Hot - Legwork/Endurance 8 minutes
Ground Play - tone abs, buttocks and core 6 minutes
Playful Dance - Cardio for fat burning and improved coordination 5 minutes
Cool It Now - return to resting heart rate 9 minutes

Bonus Performances - Get Inspired! 6 minutes

I like that you can turn off the instruction and it just uses the music and visual instruction. I have watched the whole thing but so far only had the ability to get through the first section. It gives a great warm-up and I did not hurt myself which is usually VERY easy for me to do. Goes with the natural flow and rhythms of the body without contorting me into crazy painful positions. My feet stay on the floor most of the time so this is very low impact which is great for my knees (bad arthritis and screws holding knees caps in place due to falls).

I'm very pleased with this program and considering how many I own and never use that's saying a lot! Happy to recommend.",1330300800,6,2042,4.223076923076923
2672329,4,B000JJ4DF0,I am starting from scratch in terms of fitness and found this to be a good way to transition into working out again.  I could not finish the video with my first viewing so be prepared for an intense workout if you can make it the 50 minutes.  THe first half is a gentle beginning but the last half is extremely vigorous so should be appropriate for low to moderately in shape students.  Serious cardio burn for about 35 minutes.,1327363200,,428,4.325
2672330,1,B000JJ4DF0,"I enjoy dance dvds for something different or for a lighter day if I have already done some cardio or weight training.  I like the music and the idea of this, but the cueing was bad, the moves were boring - hip shakes in place, spine stretches, yawn. Face stretches were simply silly.

Wasn't for me, but sounds like it's a 50/50 chance as others seem to have enjoyed it.",1326931200,,371,4.285714285714286
2672331,3,B000JJ4DF0,"I wanted a dance workout. I saw this one and it looked like it was belly dancing style. I youtubed a clip of it and it looked easy. Im a hand full of woman (fat) so I figured easy is great, and I purchased it.

What I was watching was the warm ups. It definitely picks up pace.

***The good***-

-It's fun and what the reviews said are true. Time does fly when you're doing this. I usually do my own made up workout every morning for 10 minutes. Those 10 minutes feel like an hour and it's all I can do to push through a lousy 10 minutes. I did this one for 25 minutes and it went by quicker than the 10 I usually do.

-Very customizable. Like I said, I'm a large woman, and not in the best shape. I found that alot of the stuff she does is customizable to your fitness level. For instance on some of them she started off slow then quickly doubled the pace. If you're in decent shape, doubling with her is fine. I'm not, so I stayed at the orignal pace. There's other areas where she hops up in the air, I bounced a little, but stayed on the ground.

- I H.A.T.E working out. hate it. Did I mention I hate it? I hate it. I bought this dvd last night and tried it then. This morning I woke up finding myself aching to get out of bed to do my work out. Anything that makes me WANT to work out gets a thumbs up from me. Especially when I look at work outs like most people look at getting a root canal.

***The bad***

-If you're looking for a back breaking hard core work out, this isn't for you. If you want a fun workout that'll eventually get you sweating (some people sooner than others) - this  one is nice.

-alot of head shaking/bobbing/spinning around. If you get dizzy easily, you better watch it with this one. She does alot of head shaking, hair flipping, bending down and flipping back up again, etc. I had to do my own version of this because trying to do it at her level I quickly found myself dizzy and verging on a headache. Infact I skipped some of it all together. It seemed silly and unnecessary to me.

All in all, I don't regret this purchase.",1326153600,10,2062,4.069135802469136
2672332,3,B000JJ4DF0,"The instructor is a little annoying, she's making much love to the camera way too often. Found it very distracting and uncomfortable, however it feels like a work out.

It's a shame, the dance moves are fun and you can get a reasonable workout from this video. But while you're working out, the instructor will be staring at you like you're a white chocolate and raspberry muffin, which is a bit off-putting.",1325894400,4,334,4.583333333333333
2672334,5,B000JJ4DF0,"I rented this DVD from the library to see if I'd like it or not. I definitely do! I generally have a hard time getting into working out if there's not music or dancing involved. I have a background in dance and know how great of a workout it is, so other types of exercise seem like a bore to me.

This workout kept me interested. I started sweating about 7-10 minutes into the video. It's really great cardio, but I could feel my thighs, abs and arms getting a great workout, too. Some of the steps are very fast, but it's fun if you just let go and don't think about how you look doing the moves. The cool-down was probably my favorite part though =] It was very relaxing!

Word of caution: There is a lot of jumping in this workout. If you do not have good knees or ankles, I would just try to do a lower impact move in place of the hopping. I'm a petite girl and my ankles even cracked a few times (but I know this is normal for me).",1325894400,,937,4.005347593582887

Well, as it turns out, they really are fun. With moves like ""Feed the Chickens"", you can't help but smile while working out with the DVD. Hemalayaa is gregarious and wonderful instructor. I find her enthusiasm infectious and I cannot wait to work out again with her.

The best part about the workout is that while driving to work in the morning, my shoulders and back felt loose. I typically always have a lot of knots from stress and lots of driving. However, this workout seemed to really loosen up my trouble spots.

My only criticisms are that the workout was not more intense and the background dancer. Now, with that said, it is nice to have a few DVDs that are a little less intense on days when I am not up for something more. The background dancer on Hemalayaa's right seemed to be off most of the time on the DVD. It seems like the production crew knew it and just filmed her face whenever possible. It can be a little distracting.

Overall, I am really happy that I bought this DVD.",1311120000,,1165,4.3842592592592595

2672342,5,B000JJ4DF0,"Thank goodness she says to dance like nobody's watching and I'm glad I DO when nobody's watching because I'd probably never do these videos or dance games. I had this DVD a couple years ago and the only reason I quit despite really enjoying it was because of peanut gallery commentary. I ordered a replacement copy, which came yesterday, and I tore into it. I use dance workout DVDs and dance console games on my cardio days because regular, structured cardio and treadmill/elliptical stuff bores me to death. It feels a little cheesy when she routinely tells you to smile and have fun with it, and some of the moves seem silly, but when you're done, you're sore and sweaty and your heart rate is definitely up. Best of all, it is FUN, so the time flies. I don't find the footwork terribly complicated or difficult, if you're larger some of the  bouncing may be a bit much and there's squat moves that might be rough on your knees if you have issues (I have PTTD in my ankles so I didn't do the side jumps, I just modified with other moves in those times) You can do this no matter your skill level if you can count and move. Who cares about looking right or being in perfect step, that will come with practice. Just get off your butt and move and dance and sweat.",1302825600,2,1264,4.3559322033898304

2672347,3,B000JJ4DF0,"I enjoy trying different workouts and will often check them out from my local library to try them and to see if the workout is something that would hold up over time and keep my interest. With this dvd I found it moderately fun to do but not one that I would choose to purchase.

The workout is approx 46 minutes in length, with a 6 minute warm-up and 9 minute cool-down segment.  I would consider the workout an intermediate workout and the choreography was fairly straight-forward.  You run the gamut from shimmies, spine rolls, hip scoops, hops, deep plies (bends), hip circles, torso circles and rib isolations.  There is also a little ab work in their too.  You are definitely moving, but it is not a sweaty aerobic workout.

Here are my likes and dislikes on this one:  the cuing was so-so, sometimes the cuing was done as she did the move instead of a little before so you knew what was coming, the camera angles did not always show the footwork at the beginning of a move, which I could still follow but I found rather odd for a workout video where this seems important.  The warm-up also included face exercises(?)....what(?) am I in danger of spraining my lips or something if they aren't warmed up?  Not sure what that was about.  The neck rolls I thought were in bad form because you are dipping your head all the way back which I had been instructed by my old dance teachers you do not want to do because it grinds your neck discs together.  This I try to avoid.  What I did like: the set was colorful, as were the costumes, the dancers seemed happy and like they were having fun, the moves were moderately fun to do and the music was not overpowering. It is something different if you want something out of your ordinary fitness routine and it does get you moving.

Overall, it was fine for an occasional work-out, but I can't see myself putting this one into rotation and would not choose to purchase it. This might be a good choice if you have trouble getting into traditional workouts and want something a little lighter to do.",1298160000,,2044,4.447721179624665

The narration and dancers were often out of synche with each other, which was very frustrating. My other major gripe was that it lacked any of the grace that is found in Indian dancing. I found the instructor very tacky and seemed she was more interested in displaying herself than teaching any moves. At some points it was simply vulgar and that is not what Bollywood is about! I noticed a reivew from a professional Bollywood dancer and she also commented how far-fetched it was.",1298160000,,682,4.691666666666666

Additionally, the dance moves are very awkward and do not flow very easily. I mean, even the instructor and her partners to not seem to flow through the moves.

I find it easier to complete the full workout when I force myself to keep a steady pace while still maintaining some intensity.

I decided to give it a try. Previously, I had watched maybe 5 minutes of Tae Bo, 2 of a Richard Simmons, and seconds of an overpriced infomercial one. WOW! I LOVE this! It is for a beginner, others may find it too low cardio. For me it is a fun dance that someone sweetly talks you through. Great camerawork, and as Ms H says, it's most important to have fun. At last, a workout that you feel great about it AND yourself, no matter what level. You also can't help but feel beautiful and powerful with these sensual movements. And I don't need to move furniture, unless I want to, lol! That means you can download it to your travel computer (SO easy with Amazon's video library) and do it at a hotel. This was my first try at Amazon's library feature, if you haven't tried it, it is TERRIFIC!
But back to this video...her voice is like silk, which is important if you plan on watching over and over. This is a wonderful way to start moving if you are very large or have been inactive for a long time because it is very easy to adapt to anyone's limitations.

I suppose I would still get a good workout alternating gaping at the screen in wonder and failing to imitate the dancers while still moving, but this video certainly won't be teaching me any Bollywood dancing.  The dances also aren't what I'd hoped for or expected based on Bollywood that I've seen, but my expectations may have been unrealistic.

2672385,2,B000JJ4DF0,"After having used this Bollywood video workout several times and enjoying the moves on their own, I must say that I find the focus on the idolatrous Hindi deities in the background a major turn off and distraction. As a devout Christian, I find the blatant and frequent display of two pagan religious icons in this video backdrop offensive.

I love East Indian culture for the most part - I love to eat curries and I adore making unusual clothing with sari fabrics. But I despise idolatry of any kind - especially the misplaced use of it in a video supposedly designed as a light-hearted and fun workout.

For a while I also studied classical Indian dance, which this Bollywood dancing workout has not the slightest resemblance to. Back then, I was a Christian as well, but thankfully the teacher did not have any idols in her dance studio. But when I finally performed in an East Indian dance show with my class, I was horrified by the huge many-armed statue of Shiva in the back of the stage with incense burning in front of it.

Needless to say, it was the last time I danced in one of their shows, though I do have a great deal of respect for the intricacies of Indian classical dances. For this reason, I have decided not to use use this video, and have destroyed it instead. It's a regrettable thing, because without the idols and the demonic looks occasionally flashing out of Himalaya's eyes, this video would have been a keeper.

Update, Sept. 25, 2009:

As the many comments on this review show, I have received a great deal of criticism for my opinion here, and have even been accused of hate, which is not the spirit behind what I have written. I do not hate the girls dancing in this video or the instructor. I do hate the idols and the demons these idols represent, however. As an act of love, I am praying for people like Himalaya all over the world, and hoping that they will come out of the darkness they are in and into God's marvelous light, where love, mercy, forgiveness and kindness prevail toward people and not hate.

I also pray that they will stop killing the Christians in their communities - Christians like me who wish them and you no harm and would never wish to use violence to solve a conflict but don't want to bow down to anyone's idols or be ridiculed for not wanting to either.

Please understand that I put this review here as a warning to other Christians who might not want to be cursed by the idolatry in this DVD. It was an act of kindness toward others like me who do not want to do anything to displease God, even if it displeases people. Sorry if it offends some of you, but I have a right to my opinion and so do you. So go ahead and call me names if it makes you feel better. But it won't change how I feel about idols and demons. I will always hate them both even while loving and praying for the people who bow down to them.",1242086400,7,2872,4.337057728119181

2672396,3,B000JJ4DF0,"""The Bollywood Dance Workout"" with Hemalayaa supposedly provides 50 minutes of dance workout for the enthusiastic student. The DVD does try to be a workout.  Complete with a warm-up, dance segment, floorwork and cool down, Hemalayaa and her two ""sister"" class shimmy their way through an upbeat albeit redundantly soundtracked ersatz Bhangra routine.  Unfortunately, some of the moves are difficult to follow and Hemalayaa offers no ""basic"" section on the DVD where the student can actually watch and practice the moves before attempting to follow the choreography. The Bollywood Dance Workout is a wonderful idea with plenty of potential but little execution.  It is, sadly, disappointing.

I consider myself to be an expert of sorts due to my thirty years of effective injury-free exercise (running, kickboxing, aerobics, yoga, Pilates). However, I am not a dancer. With that said, some of the moves that Hemalayaa suggests performing while ""letting go and having fun""--head and neck throws and back undulations, can potentially cause injury if attempted without control and form and with complete abandon.  Again, a segment where Hemalayaa teaches the move outside of a dance sequence in slow motion with the proper attention to form and control would definitely be beneficial and lower the risk of pulling one's neck or hurting one's back.

I purchased the DVD because I find the dancing performed in Bollywood flicks combines sexiness, innocent fun and high energy. Unfortunately Hemalayaa's routine does and does not fit the bill adequately. Hemalayaa embodies high energy, but her voice over instruction does not adequately teach the moves.  The music used during the workout is repetitive; the moves are attractive, but never explained in terms of India and its culture and worst of all although the cardio dance is high impact, incorporating hopping and jumping, I never really broke a sweat.  Therefore I must categorize the Bollywood Dance Workout as just an introduction to the type of dancing seen in Bollywood film despite the inclusion of a warm-up (watch out for those ridiculous neck and head throws) and overly long, in relation to the duration of the cardio, cool-down.

Hemalayaa's instructions encourage, but for the most part she urges the student ""to just let go and have fun"" rather than concentrate on timing and step-by-step implementation of each move.  As this routine is really not a workout, my advise is the same as Hemalayaa's ""just let go, let the music move you and have fun.""If you don't you are not going to work your heart enough and the purpose of the 50 minutes is lost.

Hemalayaa's bonus dance segment features the trio and then Hemalayaa in a solo performance. Difficult to follow because of fade-out camera techniques and odd angle shots, it can visually please, but is useless for studying technique unless one watches it repeatedly. Unfortunately, I don't have time for that.

Bottom line:  The Bollywood Dance Workout with Hemalayaa disappoints.  Its fun to watch and try, but in terms of a workout where one's heart rate is elevated, this one did not do it for me, but again, I am not an exercise beginner. The overall presentation would benefit from a fundamental moves segment where each of the body movements are explained in terms of the actual doing and their relevance in or derivation from Indian culture. Recommended only for beginners.

2672402,5,B000JJ4DF0,"This is a great workout for free-spirit types who don't easily tolerate methodical running or tedious treadmills. Hemalayaa's love for dance is infectious; she motivates without words through body language, unlike many fitness leaders whose false cheeriness is more grating than helpful. The dancers have real bodies and real laughter. The workout is great for its repeatability due to the option of switching off vocal instruction. Instead, you can focus entirely on your dancing and the bhangra beat. There's just something very appealing about dancing barefoot around the living room.

The workout is approximately 50 minutes long and includes warm up and cool down sessions that enclose five sections of cardio, with toning incorporated in the workout. The time flies by, and the fun factor is motivating to pop in the DVD every day. The workout is appropriate for any level. Background dancers move at a different pace to give the viewer options (such as bouncing one hip instead of also incorporating arm movements). Hema urges the viewer to find her own groove: ""You don't always have to do what we're doing."" The dancer who allows herself to truly let go and laugh at herself will benefit most from this workout.

I have found that the Bollywood Dance Workout is a perfect accompaniment to my daily yoga routine. I also recommend Brazilian Body by Kimberly Miguel Mullen, a backup dancer in this DVD.

Note: Some of the sequences are high-impact and involve hopping. This isn't a problem if you keep your knees bent - unless you have knee or feet problems. One stretch, the spine whip, irritated my neck muscles for a few hours after the first workout, most likely due to self-created tension. Make sure you are properly loose and take it easy, as with all new workouts.",1231632000,3,1778,4.9397993311036785
2672403,5,B000JJ4DF0,"I absolutely love Bollywood Dance. This is my favorite cardio activity. It gets my heart racing, my muscles burning, and my sweat running.

Pros:

* Customize it. They teach you the moves yes but Hemalayaa is constantly encouraging you to ""do what feels right"". If you're having a hard time keeping up, just stick to the basic and keep the rhythm. If you need to amp it up, put more ""bounce"" into it (Can you ever have too much bounce? I think not!) or try some of the more complicated steps (I still can't do the Bhangra Bounce without falling).

*Fast and Upbeat. Do not let that warm up fool you. Once you get started, it does NOT slow down until the cool down. Just when I'm dying in the Ground Play there's a whole other segment of really fun torture.

*No pressure. You aren't really freaking out about perfect ""form"" and stance and other formal things. You are playing and burning major calories while doing so.

*Silly as heck. I usually can't help but laugh at myself at least once during this DVD. And the first time I did it I couldn't stop laughing.

Cons:

*Silly as heck. I cannot, under any circumstances, do this while anyone's watching. I feel way too silly. But I shut the door to my room or do it in the morning before the rest of the family's up, and it's on! I think to really benefit from it you HAVE to get into it. And it is really hard, for me personally, to really get into this when someone's watching me.

I love the workout and I want the rest. This is probably one of my top 3 workout DVDs if not my #1.",1228694400,,1533,4.243986254295533

2672406,1,B000JJ4DF0,Absolutely no sweat and no fun. This video is not a good dance workout or even a good dance intructional video. I will never buy a dance workout again.,1225497600,,151,4.241379310344827
2672407,3,B000JJ4DF0,"This is a video I wish I could love, but that just doesn't do it for me.  Part of it is sheer silliness - flubbing the lips in the warm-up? - and part of it is that Hemalayaa's narration style bothers me.  (It might work for other people, but I find her to be a bit too flip.)  There's the occasional odd transition, and the background dancers are sometimes doing something completely different from what Hemalayaa is demonstrating, which is confusing - is it a modification for more/less advanced viewers? is it bad cueing? what?

As far as the workout goes, it's actually pretty fun.  The moves might not necessarily be Bollywood, but they've got enough of the flavor to offer something different from a lot of the dance-style videos out there.  The moves are generally easy enough for anyone to follow, although people with bad knees may find the emphasis on knee movement to be difficult or painful; it's more high-impact than not, with a fair amount of hopping in the workout proper. There's a lot of repetition, which makes picking up the moves very easy but which can make things a little boring.

Overall, this video is a mixed bag for me.  The workout is enjoyable but the narration is not, and the hopping may be a bit much for a lot of people.  I'd recommend trying to find this at a local library before buying it, I think.",1224460800,,1335,4.5062240663900415

Constant jumping and bouncing til my teeth rattle isn't my thing. I didn't feel sexy doing it either which surprised me because I thought I'd be a wildy sensuous indian princess aftewards. Go figure! Nice set but I'm giving my copy to the local library. It just didn't have that sharp, intelligent dance snappiness or, alternately, any down-lo sexy flow -- of which I expect one or the other of in a dance video - especially an Indian one!

I am one of those ppl who reads reviews before buying anything. I was skeptical intially looking at 4 stars for the DVD. I own a lot of Ana brett's( 5stars for most of it) DVD as well, while Ana's DVD was really good, it never motivalted to pop it into the DVD player as much as Hemalaya's did. While I am not denouncing Ana's , I realised 'to each his own'. I prefer Hemalaya's because at the end of her routine , I am sweaty at the same time I am exhilarated. I spend the whole day in that state. She also does this thing she calls 'spinal whip' which actually loosens the spine. I could feel the tension in the spine leave as I do it. All limbs feel loose and strong at the same time at the end of the workout as she incorporates both yoga and aerobic activity into her routines. Though I am not much of a regular to exercise, the DVD makes me feel that I haven't 'excerised' as much as I actually  have:)- if that makes sense.",1222819200,2,938,4.043010752688172

My kids and husband like dancing with Hemalayaa too. The background is beautiful. I feel like Hemalayaa is a little too sexy but she's definitely having fun. I like that she doesn't take herself so seriously. She's a bit mesmerizing to watch. The voice over is too loud for the music, but it can be turned off.

I got exactly what I was looking for!  Though recently lapsed, I was a dancer for 15 years, so I was able to pick up on the steps and combinations very quickly as she jumps right into each move... for beginners, it might be worth it to watch the DVD once through without doing the steps to get a better idea of what you'll be doing.  The 3 15 minute segments make a fantastic work-out if used together... but what I really love is that each piece can be enjoyed on its own, too!  I love sneaking in section 1 before work, maybe 2 if i'm home for lunch, and 3 is a great way to unwind when I get home for the day.  However it works into your schedule... this DVD is a blast.

* Presentation can be improved, also the narration.
* Change the title for this DVD... its misleading.

1. Hemalayaa is beautiful and inspiring, as are her ""sisters"" (the other dancers). They have real bodies and seem happy and healthy!

2. The set/location is fantastic. The colors are gorgeous and I love the garden behind them. You could imagine yourself in India or even in California (which is probably where it was made) if you want to!

3. The music is great. I feel like I'm in a Bollywood movie.

4. The steps aren't too hard but are still fun and plenty of cardio (but not too much that I can't breathe).

5. The option of turning off the instructions are really cool, too.

6. My favorite move is when you get to squat and bend over really deep and come back up and flip your hair up. It makes me feel primal and gooood.

7. It makes me feel goddess-y.

8. I did it two days in a row, which is a first for me with ANY workout!
I usually do a dvd or video once and never watch it again.

9. Definitely worth my money, energy, and time!

10. If you learn all the moves and want more, you can follow along to the bonus performances!

I really like this dance workout - Hemalaya has a very fun and easygoing approach.  The reason why I gave this 4 stars, instead of 5 stars, is because the dancing is a little off beat at times - it's not always cued to the music.  This bothered me at first, as I was trying to stay with the dancers on screen.  But, after a while I just went at my own pace so that I was on beat (even if the dancers were off).

2672428,5,B000JJ4DF0,"I was a little concerned about adding ""The Bollywood Workout"" to my aerobics workouts. For one thing, I thought it might only be for girls. Also, Indian dancing is barefoot, and the moves are impossible in gym shoes. I like dancing without shoes, the human foot was meant for this, but injured myself when doing aerobic workouts without running shoes.

I decided to give it a try because in Bollywood films, the guys dance just as crazily as the girls, trying to impress them I would suppose. As to the shoe issue, the ONLY impact movements in this workout are the two and three hop Hare Krishna moves and Hemalayaa is very conscientious about telling you to bend the knee to absorb the stress. The other foot moves are characteristic of Indian dance and art: rather than being *en pointe* or a continual *jete* into space (with stress on landing) Indian dance stays rooted to the earth and gets its strength building from variants of *plie*, if you'll pardon my French!

This I found a very rewarding workout that unlike Jane Fonda's (which I also like) seems to last far less than fifty minutes, because there is more variety. The ladies look like real women and not Barbie dolls but are ""eye candy"" all the same.

You do need to be careful in the head whip moves if you have any history of neck or back trouble. But doing them slowly and ramping up may (in my nonmedical opinion) help to clear these very problems up.

Of course, as an introduction to the vast dance tradition of India, this is like playing Louie-Louie on the *sitar* and purists may be offended. But Bollywood itself plays around, respectfully, with India's traditions and this workout introduces the Westerner to many unvisited bodily zones, for example, when Hemalayaa invites you to breathe into a specific area.

More advanced dancers will of course laugh at these gals, but those of us fighting depression and advancing age with Siva's dance applaud Hemalayaa's efforts to bring this important practice to ordinary gymnosophistical slobs such as yours truly.",1202860800,49,2034,4.783475783475783

2672433,2,B000JJ4DF0,"This video can be sort of fun I guess, but I prefer a more efficient workout.  In my opinion this 50 minute video wastes a lot of time on silly (and potentially harmful) things like whipping your neck around a thousand times.  There are a couple of segments that do get my heart rate up, but most of the video is spent on dancing ""like no one is watching,"" being ""sassy,"" letting yourself go, and ""feeling"" the music.  The only problem is that the music isn't that good, so there's nothing to feel.

On top of that, I just don't like Hemalayaa's personality in this video. The voiceover is incredibly annoying because she's overly enthusiastic about every little thing.  Throughout the entire video you get to watch her mug for the camera--the voiceover might be explaining some footwork, but on screen you're watching Hemalayaa's face and chest while she flirts with the camera.  If you exercise first thing in the morning, and you're not one of those people who just wakes up happy, beware.

Bollywood dance is largely about shaking the shoulders and neck, and stretching the back and I've found that working out to this DVD is of tremendous assistance in getting me limbered up. It might not seem macho, compared with lifting weights and making grunting noises, but it's a really good workout. Add to this the fact that it means working out while looking at beautiful women - which inspires and makes it all enjoyable.

The warm-up segment is a great way to loosen up and get used to the flow of this program. It is very different from your usual cardio in that the movements are flowing and great for the joints and loosening up muscles that are usually very tense after exercise, such as the neck and the lower back. The best part is that it is not precise and demanding; the instructor, Hemalayaa, asks you to just ""not think about it too much"" and just to move to the rhythym. You don't need to worry too much about coordination or be a dancer to do this workout.

I personally have had some health problems over the past two years that prevent me from doing strenuous exercise and this workout boosts my heart rate and my metabolism without causing me pain. Actually, all the bhangra shoulder movements have helped loosen up the scar tissue in my chest wall and actually makes me feel better after I workout.

The chapters are divided up into segments that make it easy to mix-and-match the parts if you don't have time to do the full workout. The first three segments are a perfect 20 min. workout or do the whole thing for about a 45 minute total cardio session. Excellent DVD, even the set is beautiful.

There are some moves done repetitively but there is nothing to memorize.

Also, I don't remember a single belly dance movement in this DVD...even what Hema calls a shimmy is not really a shimmy.  I don't see how doing belly dance videos will help you with this video as some other reviewer has suggested.

The impact is kind of high at times especially since you aren't wearing shoes.  So be careful of your knees.  The only movement that I thought was a big no-no was when Hema did a full swat that she hopped into and out of.  When she did it she said something like,""See how that feels on your knees.""  No...don't see how it feels.  You might seriously injure your knees.",1199491200,,962,4.588235294117647

2672447,4,B000JJ4DF0,"I borrowed this DVD from my local library, but purchased it because it's such a fun workout.  I expected to be more annoyed than anything during the workout, but actually started to have fun while vigoroussly shaking my hips.  It can be difficult to keep up with the action, however.  The narration does not always give you a lot of warning prior to transitioning to new moves, but that didn't hinder my workout.",1199232000,,412,4.616438356164384
2672448,4,B000JJ4DF0,"I saw this in a Border's and it looked different and interesting so I thought I'd give it a shot, and I was glad I did. In the beginning, this is a slow paced dance workout that builds to some heart pumping cardio--it got me sweating!
The DVD is broken into 7-8 segements, including a warm up and cool down. Each segment concentrates on various areas of the body, using Bollywood dance moves. I enjoyed doing this DVD and the 50 mins flew by quickly. My only complaint is when I started to get really heated up with the hardcore cardio moves, the workout was over!
Pros: Fun, doesn't feel like almost an hour, works body from head to toe, you WILL feel it the next day, easy to learn and follow with modifications if you can't go all the way
Cons: Workout ends right as you get heated up and are getting into it, lots of hopping for those with bad knees, some moves are a little silly but the instructor tells you to ""have fun with it"" and ""dance like no one is watching""--isn't that what dance is all about anyway?
Overall, this was a great workout I look forward to adding to my rotation of cardio DVDs. Surprisingly, the areas that were sore the next day were unconvential ones: tops of my thighs, back (muscles, not spine) and shoulders (you ""bounce"" your shoulders A LOT, giving them a good workout)
If you love some silly dance with your cardio (plus there's a little floorwork segment on abs) then this is for you. If you have bad knees and want low impact, you should try something else.",1198713600,4,1495,4.362007168458781
2672449,3,B000JJ4DF0,"I've tried Hemalayaa's older videos, her Yoga for Urban Living & Dosha Yoga & felt though she has good intentions, she didn't have enough body awareness to be teaching something that is focused on having that ability & cultivating it further. She was good that her videos overall would keep someone who doesn't work out regularly heart rate up. Since this is just dancing, I figured this might be her strength, but I was wrong.
The menu choices include: Intro, Play, Chapters, Bonus Performances, Music Options (music only, music w/narration), & other videos from Acacia.
The other videos clips are Hemalayaa's Yoga for young bodies for 1:30, Yoga Trance Dance :30, Duncan Wong: awakening level :30 (he's awesome), The Elaine Petrone Method 9:44 (has a lot of video testimonials)
The Bonus Performance was same music showing Hemalayaa w/two girls in slow motion fade in/out clips of them dancing for almost 3 min, then Hemalayaa alone for 3 min w/paused video, slow mo, double video effects, etc. to make the dancing look better then it is & you can't follow along with this either.
In the intro, Hemalayaa says is from Bangra, which is from Northern India dance (big, bold, sassy, & outrageous)& incorporates modern dance, hip-hop, even belly dancing.
The 2 backup dancers are Juju & Kimberly (who's also the stage director & consultant). In the credits, these dancers were dead last which is very unusual.
The chapters are:
Warming (6 min), Playtime Begins (7 min), Footwork (6 min), Now we're hot! (8 min), Ground Play (6 min), Playful Dance (5 min), Cook it now! (9 min)
The set is gorgeous, with colors & textures, the music is fun, but it's looped after a few seconds & gets annoying after a while wanting to hear the rest of the song.
One of the dancers didn't know when the next move was herself many times which is annoying & shows they didn't practice enough. The voice over cuing was ok, She didn't really break anything down, or really give any body movement instruction to help you understand how to move, but since easy moves, it isn't so bad. She just tells you to ""get down, let go, get sassy, dance like no one's watching"" throughout.
At the playful dance portion where she is alone, she narrates kinda a routine, but very repetitious. She has you do a goddess move where you move forward toward the tv pushing one hip out leading... then does a literal hip-hop running man (moving backwards) though she does it in a more simplified/corny style & alternate those. She said it's natural they go together & ""the running man is RUNNING AWAY.. actually he's running fwd toward the goddess..."" Which makes NO sense.
There were some good ones, but very few. I got bored with the repetition. You will get your heart rate up since she incorporates a lot of hopping... like hopping 3x in a row to one side, hop & wiggle your gluts, then the other many times or other moves like a pony from the 50s in an Indian style or other moves that have knee lifts.
The idea is there, but I still don't like Hemalayaa's style or think her ability to dance was good enough to be teaching. I found myself following the background dancer who knew the routine instead.
If you want a hybrid Indian dance that's corny, silly & helps you let go because it's easy & silly, this is for you.

2672450,1,B000JJ4DF0,Bought this DVD thinking it might show a few more dancemoves for Bollywood.  I am so disappointed with it!  3 women in a Bollywood inspired setting who frollock about for 50mins demonstrating moves that a 5 year old would do better.  Very badly demonstrated and not at all 'sassy'...this is constantly used to describe what you should be doing while dancing.  Not at all inspiring and ideal for 14-16yr olds who fancy themselves.  Really bad DVD and it isn't a workout.  Save yourself the bother of getting it only to return it and just get any of the other DVDs!!  Such a pity as some of the reviews were positive and influenced my decision to purchase - will be more cautious in future.,1195689600,8,688,4.544715447154472

It might have been okay, but I just couldn't get past the fact that all the girls were doing the steps at different rhythms.  Not only that, but the girl on the right didn't seem to know what she was doing at all.  This workout felt thrown together.  They could have benefited from a little more rehersal time.

The moves are fun.  So if you can get past the ""thrown together"" feel of the video, you might enjoy it.  If you can't, you might want to skip this one.",1186617600,18,522,4.108910891089109

I am new to workout videos and I am still trying to figure out some of the foot work but I keep moving anyway. To me this DVD is an escape from everyday and I found myself thinking I was dancing (and looking) just like the dancers in the DVD until I looked across the room into my mirror and I just had to nearly die laughing at myself. For the price, this DVD is great and I am achieving my goal of getting some fun physical activity daily without feeling like I am ""Working Out"".",1186617600,2,603,4.025
2672456,4,B000JJ4DF0,"The video is filmed in a nice set, well lit and you can see everything clearly. On some occasions the camera is on a face when I'd have wanted to see the feet, and some close-ups are not in time with the rhythm of the music but overall the editing is OK. Hemalayaa and her 2 ""sisters"" who dance along most of the time are wearing workout clothes, the feet are clearly visible. I only wonder why they are wearing Egyptian coin belts in an ""Indian"" dance workout...

The intro features Hemalayaa with a speach that was a bit over-enthusiastic for my taste. You know, stuff like ""once you start, you never can stop""  in a tone as if she was on some kind of happy pills...
What irritated me was that according to her Bollywood dance is ""not about elaborate choreography."" Helloooo? If we define Bollywood dance as ""dance like in Hindi films"" - well it's ALL about choreography, and most of it is quite fast and elaborate!

There's a warm up section that I have mixed feelings about. Some of it is good, but there
are at least 4 different head movements that can hurt your neck. I thought it was well known 20 years ago that rolling your head all around can be bad for the neck?
Also, I think she should have mendionned that knees have to be aligned with the feet when bending them because she does a lot of plunges.

The dance workout section mostly teaches Bhangra movements and the music is modern Bhangra as well (Bhangra is a North Indian folk dance, originally danced by men).
They are a good joice for a workout but only a small part of the movements and styles used in Bollywood dance numbers.
There's one hopping step she calls the ""Hare Krishna"" but never explains why and I really don't get the connection.
There's not a lot emphasis on the arms and hands, so you mostly work out the legs and there is a section called ""ground play"" that also works out the abs.

As this is a workout where you are supposed to be constantly moving, the movements aren't really broken down, just sometimes done slowly and then faster.

It certainly made me sweat, so this mission was accomplished :-)

Hemalayaa gives voice-over comments and repeatedly tells us to ""have fun with it!"" and ""smile!"" Well, if you don't want that, you have the option to do the workout with music alone.

I liked the cool down section (except more head rolling) although I missed a good stretch for the legs which would have needed the most.

There's an extra performance showing Hemalayaa with or without the two other dancers basically bopping around to the music we already heard in the workout, using the movements that were taught. Unfortunately it's all cut in MTV style, sometimes in slow motion - so it's not like you could really dance along.

All in all, it's OK for a workout video. You will learn some fun dance movements that you can use at the next Bollywood/Bhangra party but it will not make you a Bollywood dancer.

(BTW, I have been bellydancing for 17 years and I really don't see any bellydance movements in this DVD! The hip moves are done differently.)",1185235200,19,3042,4.492753623188406

The moves aren't broken down step-by-step like with other videos, so you have to pay attention.  The camera work makes it easy to see what the dancers are doing so just take your time and practice and you'll get the hang of it.  The first few times, I didn't worry about keeping up with the dancers, instead I just focused on getting the moves right.  It definitely got my heart pumpin!",1182902400,3,471,4.379310344827586

I still did not feel I got a great workout, but it did help in letting off some steam. This will be something I do on my ""off"" days just to remain active.",1181606400,3,491,3.871287128712871

During the commentary by the instructor and during the introduction, Hemalayaa stated that the types of dances above would be explored in her dance video. The cover is deceiving because this is the only place that there is an authentic East Indian dance pose. The only other Easten Indian dance pose in the actual video is the cool down. I am a dance instructor and an avid dance enthusiast. I have taught African dance, hip hop and creative expressive dance for more than a decade. As well, I have studied yoga, Odissi (one Indian classical dance form) and bellydance. This video is best categorized as an EXPRESSIVE DANCE WORKOUT with some miscellaneous influences. If you want to have fun, jumping around and sweating--this is for you. If you are a dancer who wants to learn new bollywood dance moves, this is NOT for you.  The dance technique in this DVD is very disappointing. The DVD is not a total loss because of the overall look of it. The overall visuals are very creative and sensuous. I just hope that in the future, Hemalayaa will not propose to teach techniques that she is not able to execute.",1181001600,24,1326,4.690987124463519
2672465,3,B000JJ4DF0,"I bought this workout DVD because it was recommended for beginners and was touted as low-impact on some other sites that carry it. I have recently lost 60 pounds and I can tell you that I wouldn't have made it half-way through this video 60 pounds ago - I would say it was more in the intermediate range. I also had knee surgery a year ago, so I have limitations on how much I can do with the knees.

Pros: Lively music, decent instruction, fun.

Cons: Has a lot of twisting around, which torques the knees.

  Has some jumping - sometimes on one leg at a time - which was too much impact on the knees.

  Lots of knee bending!

I think if I did not have knee problems this would be a great video, but I would not recommend it if you are too overweight due to impact and some positions that are NOT achievable with rolls (I still have 30 to lose and that even got in the way).",1180569600,29,876,4.076023391812866

Pros: Good workout, it can actually make you sweat. Easy to follow. The dance moves aren't precise and this can be good for unexperimented dancers (actually, you don't even need to know how to dance to do this workout).

Cons: 1) If you're looking for a belly dancing, do not buy. None of the moves is related to belly dancing. 2) Also, bad, BAD narration (Be sassy! Be sexy! Etc.). Honestly, I would NEVER do this workout with someone next to me. 3) The music is awful. 4) The whole workout looks like a Spice Girls video. 5) Some of the moves can actually be dangerous for your neck/back.

So if you're looking for a fun workout that will make you sweat, that's for you. Otherwise, you can find much better dance DVDs somewhere else.",1180396800,6,862,4.512820512820513

2672468,3,B000JJ4DF0,"The great thing about this video is there are three dancers in which you can easily see their movements, the set is lively while also being simple enough to not be overwhelming.  Hemalayaa is also an advocate of having fun and seems to be less rigid in the structuring of her routine.

On the down side, sometimes I felt like it was just three girlfriends getting together to dance around, esp as Hemalayaa herself seemed like a free spirit.  There was alot of ""head shakes"" as part of the exercise/routing (throwing back the head and shaking it vigorously) and a squat and rolling out of the spine... these were bearable... but they kept popping up for the first 5-7 minutes after the warmup which seemed to break the dance/exercise portion and really broke the mood with some kind of child like ""let's call this dancing"".

Then one of the first series of footwork had you turning in a awkward circle in which the steps were not clearly broken down, nor could you really watch and perform the steps, as you were to be moving in the circle. This may be okay for experienced dancers or video exercises, but for novices, it would seem to be quite frustrating.

Overall, there were too many circle movements (turning around with the intire body)... but this was one of the better Bollywood exercise dvd's I've seen.",1178928000,10,1312,4.637931034482759

Cons: Tried it with a friend who hated it: I think she had a hard time following the moves so if you don't dance or enjoy dance type workouts, this might not be fun for you.  I have trouble following the cooldown stretches; might be easier for someone with yoga experience?

On the whole, I strongly recommend this DVD for someone who enjoys dance workouts and is looking for something fun and different.",1178841600,2,633,4.584070796460177

I have tried yoga, pilates, bellydance, and other bhangra dance workouts (as well as aerobics but who wants to do that stuff when there's so much fun stuff out there now). I found this workout pretty easy to follow, motivating, and energizing as well as a ton of fun!  It's challenging for anyone out of shape (the sweat was dripping down my face) but so much fun you don't mind pushing yourself a little harder.  I felt like I was at a party the whole time.  The hopping sequence is difficult for overweight people who may have joint problems but I just modified it in a way that I could follow along to keep moving and it's such a short sequence that I didn't feel I lost anything from doing that.  The workout while somewhat tiring left me energized and happy for the remainder of the day.  I highly recommend this to anyone looking to add interest to their current routine or even someone trying to find the motivation to begin a routine.  Hemalayaa has a great teaching style; she breaks down the moves in simple segments and I love the names she gives them (""feed the chickens"").  Try it, you'll love it!

The first time i went through it took me a bit to get the groove (and I've been a dancer for 8 years) of the Bollywood beat, but the second and third time through it was much easier and more fluid.  The option to turn the instructions off and just dance to the music is really nice.  Also, the segment where you can watch the three girls just dance however they want to shows you how you can combine all the moves to be either really funky or really graceful.

2672478,3,B000JJ4DF0,"So based on all of these reviews, I got this DVD and did it this morning.

Setting:  Teacher + 2 dancers in a room with an Indian rug on the floor.  The background dancers are the most uninspiring dancers I have ever seen on a workout video.  The one on the right (your right) is stiff, uncoordinated and rhythmless.  Who is she?  She must be a friend of Hemalayaa.  Luckily she is blocked in most of the camera shots. Sorry if this is cruel but in a workout video you at least want the dancers to look like they are having fun AND can do the moves. Neither one of them were good at isolations. The people doing the workout can be uncoordinated, not the actors!!

Music:  It is canned Bhangra music.  Not that good.  Better music can be found on Jain's Bhangra Masala workouts.  That music is percussion and really motivates you to groove.  This music doesn't.  Also H. is in voiceover and she is much louder than the music.  So if you turn your TV up, she just gets louder and the music volume stays the same.  Next time I do it I will use the music only section as sometimes H. is counting and it doesn't match the moves or the music. Sorry I am blessed with rhythm and I can't stand being off beat. UPDATE: Just did it with music only.  Somewhat better, but I can't see it being in my dvd rotation.  I'll probably just toss it. Still looking for a dance dvd that can compete with Soul Sweat.

Choreography:  Simple but high impact. Not exciting.  No modifications.  Hip shimmies. Hopping on one foot. Turns (not good on my carpet, but I managed), lots of shoulders, head shakes. There is a warm up, footwork, and 2 aerobic sections, on the floor and cool down.  The best section is when H. is dancing by herself as she is energetic and all of her body parts move with the music as opposed to her ""sisters"".  I must say that sometimes the steps are out of sync with the music; the background dancers moved in the opposite direction than H.,and sometimes the fade in and out editing caused rhythm problems. All of this could have been fixed with better editing.

Overall:  I sort of liked it.  I did her Dosha yoga Vata segment after the DVD to stretch some more.  My knees do hurt because you do plie bounces and lots of hopping around. Will I do this again.  Jury's out, I'll try it with just music and see how it goes. Sort of disappointed 'cause  I really needed another DVD to alternate with Soul Sweat.  By the way, get that DVD.  You will love it.  I sweated and felt like I worked out but I didn't feel satisfied like I do after Soul Sweat. I guess, I'm just a big Nia fan. I'm still waiting for someone to come out with a kick [...] Bhangra workout DVD.  Maybe Sarina Jain will come out with Vol. 6 soon!! Please!!!

There is no choreography and the movements are very sloppy -- the dancers just seem to stumble from one half-hearted motion to the next.  If you've actually seen a bollywood movie, you won't recognize this workout as anything like it.  Also, the music is not very interesting and the instructions are rather ridiculous at times.  My boyfriend (who is used to seeing me do dance tapes) was laughing out loud at the tape while I was trying to follow it.

I got to go with a friend to a monthly Bollywood Dance held at the Fez in Portland last month and now want to go every month for the workout.  Nothing better than 3 hours of dancing like this to a great beat!  I'm not Indian, but that didn't matter.  They start the dance with lessons and they the mixes go on!  Hemalayaa was kind of silly with the whole sassy thing, but there is that element to Bollywood and I think she was just trying to remind us to keep it light.  The directions are not as specific as I'd hoped but next time, I'll slow it down and study the one's that are more complex.",1171843200,2,882,4.141176470588236
2672481,5,B000JJ4DF0,"I am always looking for ways to make working out fun and this workout definitely does that.  It is about 50 minutes long but you're having so much fun, you don't even notice it.  It just feels like you're dancing in your living room with your girlfriends.  I am not very familiar with Bollywood but I had no trouble following the moves.  A couple of them were a bit tricky at first but Hemalayaa is always reassuring that you don't have to do exactly what they are doing, and I liked that feeling of freedom.  If, after doing the workout a few times, you didn't feel like following their moves, it would be perfectly comfortable to just dance along with the music.  I recommend this DVD to those who like different kinds of workouts, especially dance workouts.  This will provide great variety and definitely keep you from getting bored.  I have only one warning: you might want to make sure you can be alone to do this workout so you can really get into it and enjoy it without feeling self-conscious.  But that all depends on you!  I also recommend Elsa Leandro's World Dance Workout, which also has a Bollywood segment, along with other dance forms.",1171411200,90,1152,4.548543689320389
2672482,5,B000JJ4DF0,"It is a nice, effective workout that is fun to do. OK, so maybe it is not the hardest of cardios but it is especially good for those among us who find it hard to motivate themselves to move their bodies.",1171411200,,203,3.975609756097561

50 minutes of shaking it up!",1171324800,,101,3.761904761904762
2672484,5,B000JJ4DF0,"I had a lot of fun with this workout. It's challenging and time flies, and so does the sweat! It has its warm up and a number of segments -- some basic moves (for the workout) and then a couple routines, ending with some yoga-infused cooldowns, and a few minutes of floor work in between. The workouts are more challenging, and if you're not in the best of shape you may want to pace yourself: some of the moves involve a lot of knee bends and squatting deep down and there's hopping around (high impact, definitely), so if you don't have strong knees or have a lot of weight to carry, modify until you're stronger -- you'll still get a good workout -- especially with the dance steps and kicking your knees up high -- and Hemalayaa makes you use your arms a lot, which is good for total body. It's a lot of fun to dance around, the music is nice (you don't have to have voiceover while working out, either), the setting is beautiful, and Hemalayaa is cool, along with her 2 dancers (by the way, she emphasizes a lot of ""sass"" as part of the workout -- which some might find annoying). If you love bellydance or think the Bollywood numbers are a blast you should really enjoy this. Some of the moves are definitely different from what you see in other videos and DVDs (the names of some of the moves, such as ""Feed the Chickens"" are fun, too), in a good way. One word, besides the potential hard work on the knees, if you aren't familiar with a lot of these types of dance moves, a bellydance dvd or class might help a lot, since a lot of these steps are bellydance inspired, only with more oomph. It's great fun!",1170460800,120,1613,4.2918032786885245

8150774,5,B000JJ4DF0,"I've had this DVD for years and I never seem to get tired of it. It's just FUN even though I work up a sweat doing it. If I haven't worked out in awhile, it can kick my behind and have me gasping. If I've been in a workout groove, it's still a good workout. Hemalayaa is upbeat and cheerful without being annoyingly so. I feel like I'm having fun hanging out and working out with a pal. Some of the moves just make me smile -- I mean, who can be cranky when you're doing ""feed the chicken""? A few of the moves could be rough on the knees (especially the Hare Krishna) if you have bad knees, but overall it's not bad about that IMO.",1516406400,,631,3.9763779527559056

It seems pretty beginner friendly though those with bad knees or other joint issues should be careful or modify as needed. It's not high impact but there's twisting motions, hopping, deep squats, and spine rolls.",1480896000,,490,4.632183908045977
