3729599,1,B001OBBS0A,The video portion is excellent but the audio leaves so much to be desired. I tried to use it in my English class and the students couldn't understand anything that was being said. This is unfortunate because there is too little out there in a visual format to enhance this topic.,1242518400,7,279,4.490196078431373
3729600,2,B001OBBS0A,"The work focuses on Chaucer's life and times much more than on ""Cantebury Tales.""  A person could watch this and not get a synopsis of that book; this documentary won't act as Cliff Notes.
Luckily, this work doesn't have cheesy reenactments.  That's surprising as this is the time period that college Creative Anachronism groups love so much.  Still, there is one still painting of the 1300s after another.  At two hours, I think many a non-academic viewer may not sit through this entire work.  Unlike many other documentaries that interview at least a half-dozen people, this work only had Terry Jones and the narrator.
Terry Jones is both a ""Monty Python"" member and an Oxford alum.  It's great that he has mastered the comedic and the scholarly.  However, if just seeing him cracks you up, you will have a hard time watching him expounding on a highbrow subject.  However, there is a humorous signifier here: behind Jones is a painting of him bucked naked playing a baby piano.  It looks like Martin Landau's nude piano scene in ""Pete 'n' Tillie.""  In the same way that ""Fargo"" is funny because the characters seem totally unaware of their humor, Jones never once looks at or refers to his painting and chubby booboo.
This work is too long to play in a high school's English class period.  I imagine that some viewers could benefit from seeing this alongside the film ""Cantebury Tales.""",1241481600,6,1390,4.7740585774058575

8330239,1,B001OBBS0A,"I am writing this review as a public service to warn others not to waste a dime on this DVD.  I am planning to visit Canterbury on my next trip to England so I bought this DVD to educate myself about Chaucer beforehand.

This documentary is narrated by Terry Jones, one of the members of the Monty Python comedy troupe.  It starts out with Jones sitting in front of a nude portrait of himself.  Unfortunately for us, it's the rear view.  We're subjected to his butt every time the narrator is on camera.  Very thoughtful, indeed.

In addition to the content being delivered in a boring lecture style, the chronology is completely disjointed, jumping around in time in a very confusing manner.  I fell asleep numerous times during the monotonous 2 hour run time.  At one point Jones was talking about Chaucer as a young man working at the customs house; then my eyes closed and reopened sometime later after a delicious nap and Jones was talking about Chaucer working at the customs house again, as if he hadn't mentioned it long ago.  He jumps from Richard II and then somehow we're back in time talking about Henry II.  It's jarring and confusing, especially when waking from an interesting dream.

If having the effect of an elephant tranquilizer is not enough to keep you from this DVD, be forewarned that Jones is not satisfied to simply bore you to death.  He also wants to inappropriately subject you to his political beliefs.  Yes, he somehow manages to malign Margaret Thatcher, George W. Bush, Dick Cheney and the War on Terror while making facile comparisons to the poll tax, dim-witted medieval kings and their wicked puppet masters.  I wish I had slept through those segments.

The worst part of this entire experience (aside from the waste of money) is that I don't feel like I understand Chaucer any better for having watched this awful tripe.  Unfortunately I know Terry Jones better.",1467936000,,1899,4.723404255319149
8330240,2,B001OBBS0A,"Did not care for this video.  It is long and drawn out, and seems to focus on information not really needed for the study of Chaucer.  My students seemed bored, and I, myself, became a little bored when I previewed it at home.  Would not recommend it.  Am looking for a replacement.",1350518400,3,282,4.365384615384615
8330241,1,B001OBBS0A,"I am very disappointed with this product.  I purchased it in the hope it would enhance my teaching of the subject.  It is muddled and disorganized.  The narration is hard to follow.  The host has a painting behind him that is a distraction; in the first scene it may have been a cute joke, but to display it throughout the entire presentation was a bit much!  I tried to salvage some of it ny going to particular chapters, but the writer had a hard time staying focused and the narration wanders.",1338422400,4,496,4.406593406593407
8330242,3,B001OBBS0A,"The title is ""Chaucer & The Canterbury Tales."" Anyone who wants a acted version of the Tales will be disappointed with this DVD. Instead, what Terry Jones and narrator Jones offer is a detailed discussion of Chaucer's life and career as a courtier, diplomat, administrator, and poet closely aligned with the powerful John of Gaunt and King Richard II (who became king at age 14 and is thought to have been the first English king in a long while to speak English).

Much of the photography accompanying the narrative is of sites and buildings around London and Canterbury that are associated with Chaucer and his time. I visited London in 2009 and found the street scenes and buildings and interiors not only familiar but apt. Others might know London too well to need that or might not especially care. The close-ups of manuscript illustrations are sometimes not in focus, which is a shame, but the narrative is intelligent and informative, though the low-tech recording reveals slight background hiss stopping and starting when the narrative pauses between scenes. I found the voices easy to follow, but I tend to turn up the volume on videos. Standard classroom equipment might not work as well. And the English do have English ""accents,"" don't they?

Terry Jones brings life to the presentation by discussing interesting problems of interpretation about the facts of Chaucer's life, which are mostly derived from documents. As the narrative points out, we know more facts about Chaucer than we do about Shakespeare, despite Shakespeare having lived 200+ years closer to our time, because Chaucer was an important person at court during the last 30 years of the 1300s. This makes what happened to Chaucer an interesting problem, because after Richard II was deposed and murdered by Henry IV, Chaucer simply disappeared from the documentary record. Did he happen to die of natural causes at that time, or was he eliminated as a close associate of the deposed king?

Terry Jones points to the satirical portraits of churchmen in the Tales (the friar, the monk, the pardoner, the prioress) and theorizes that Archbishop of Canterbury Arundel, who fled to the Continent for a time and then returned with Henry Bolingbroke, may have taken offense at the anti-clericalism and/or seen Chaucer as a potential propagandist for Richard and against Henry. Jones also discusses the Lollards and Wycliff, with whom Chaucer may have been in sympathy. This would have been dangerous because of the supposed Lollard influence on the bloody Peasants' Revolt of 1381.

In short, this DVD will be most useful to those who already know something about Chaucer and his writing and who want to deepen their understanding of the period. As for the nude piano player (who is properly wearing a necktie), it is a little distracting to see Terry Jones jowl by cheek with the painting behind him. One view was amusing; repeated views not so much.",1328400000,,2921,4.979508196721311
8330243,3,B001OBBS0A,"As an English teacher, I hoped this video would be more interesting than it was for my students to learn about Geoffrey Chaucer.  There was a lot of historical information not relevant to what I was teaching, so it did not fit my needs.  The students were also bored by the way the material was presented.  I will not use it in my classroom again.",1287360000,4,347,4.3076923076923075
8330244,4,B001OBBS0A,"The title is somewhat misleading, because this lengthy documentary is about so much more than the Canterbury Tales. Indeed, it covers Chaucer's life and career and the various literary works he produced, including the Canterbury Tales, but also Book of the Duchess, etc. It also provides a great deal of incidental information about life in the 14th-century, the politics, economic situation, the Black Plague, the 1381 Rising, etc. Terry Jones is not only a member of the Python group, but also a published scholar about the 14th century, including books about Chaucer's pilgrim knight (titled Chaucer's Knight), and the politics near the end of Chaucer's life (Who Murdered Chaucer?). He has participated in other documentaries about the period that are a bit more humorous and Python-esque, such as the delightful series, Medieval Lives. However, this foray is much more serious. The length would make it cumbersome to show in a single class period, but at the college level, it would be a useful adjunct, for viewing in the library, for students taking courses in Chaucer and other medieval literature. I did not have any problems with the sound or understanding the accents.",1265587200,24,1179,5.145833333333333
8330245,1,B001OBBS0A,"While those who are as interested in Chaucer as Jones seems to be might enjoy it, I felt I should point out that unlike most of Jones' historical documentaries, he does not ""host"" or even ""narrate"" this one.  He is only shown in brief, rather dry interview segments between long stretches of even drier narration by Peter Morgan Jones (likely no relation to Terry).  The video portion consists mainly of panning over still images, with any actual video footage being zoom-ins and zoom-outs on scenic views, containing very little motion at all.  The only real comic relief is the painting behind Jones.  Misidentified as some random joke by another reviewer, Python fans will recognize it as depicting Jones' ""nude organist"" character from Monty Python's Flying Circus.  While there are plenty of good historical docs from Jones that are both educational and entertaining (and this is the first one I've seen that isn't), I'd recommend this only if your focus is on Chaucer rather than Jones.",1258934400,4,992,4.987878787878788
8330246,3,B001OBBS0A,"I had hoped for a bit about the sources of his Canterbury Tales. It did inspire me to read ""who Murdered Chaucer"". Some interesting ideas there...",1253491200,,146,4.653846153846154
8330247,3,B001OBBS0A,"I was a little disappointed because I thought this was going to be a filmed version of some of the Canterbury Tales.  Instead, it is a narrative by T. Jones about the background history of the times, and of Chaucer, and shows some places in England that relate to the Tales.  The DVD is interesting to me because I have a deep interest in English history, but was not what I expected.  There was no way to discern this from my reading of the blurb that accompanied the Amazon DVD info. Or, because it didn't say 'narrative only', I expected something different.

Nonetheless, I have appreciated it for what it is.  Just wish I'd known that before I sent for it.",1250726400,17,661,4.429752066115703
