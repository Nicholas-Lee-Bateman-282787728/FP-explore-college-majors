217063,5,6300182649,"Peter Sellers third last movie featuring his soon to be wife Lynne Frederick.  This has always been one of my favourite Sellers movies, based on the classic novel.  I loved the blend of slapstick and verbal humour and Rupert of Hentzau has long been my favourite villain.  The movie follows the book with reasonable fidelity, although replacing the thoroughly middle class Rudolph Rassendyll with London cabbie, Syd Frewin, adding a side story involving a mistress and her jealous husband and adding a happy ending.

This movie is a gentler comedy than many of those Sellers starred in and came out the same year as his finest role, Chance the Gardiner in ""Being There"".

If you love Peter Sellers, this is well worth a look.",1334793600,2,725,4.814516129032258
217064,1,6300182649,"The DVD jacket itself, not the ad @ Amazon, carries the statement that this DVD is playable ONLY on play-only machines. My player has the capability to be hooked up to the internet. My machine is not currently hooked up to the internet. Nevertheless, this DVD will not play in my machine. When I put the disc into the machine, this message pops up on the screen: ""DISC ERROR.""; then the machine ejects the disc. Bummer! Could/can Amazon begin warning customers of this in their ads for each DVDs of this type?",1325203200,6,509,4.543478260869565
217065,5,6300182649,A must see for true Peter Sellers fans.  Here he shows his versatility as a multi-rolled actor.  Very funny depiction of a classic movie.,1286323200,,137,4.666666666666667
217066,3,6300182649,"The incomparable Peter Sellers shines in this 1979 comic remake of the Anthony Hope classic as he plays three roles (one relatively brief). Director Richard Quine seems a bit uneasy with the swashbuckling slapstick, but a decent cast makes up for the weak spots. In one of his final films, Sellers delivers a spot-on Michael Caine imitation as the no-nonsense Cockney cab driver. ""The Prisoner of Zenda"" is a pleasant romp that will not erase memories of the 1937 Ronald Colman version.",1236124800,,486,4.939024390243903
217067,3,6300182649,"If you like Peter Sellers this is a near must-see. He plays several characters all are not well developed. It's enjoyable, but not great.  It is very sad that this movie has not been made available on DVD.",1176336000,2,205,4.394736842105263
7804137,4,6300182649,"Leonard Maltin and others have criminally underrated this charming, rollicking adventure comedy.  Admittedly uneven, it boasts gorgeous production design and nuanced performances by the great Sellers, particularly as a warm, caring, dimensional cabbie.  As his royal doppelganger, Sellers affects a consistent accent which is somewhat irritating and may cause viewers to lose a line or two.
Critics may have expected a comedy with adventure rather than an action spectacle in which comedy is secondary.",1521504000,,502,5.77027027027027
7804138,5,6300182649,Watched it with a friend year ago.  I am now sending it to her to remember the fun we had watching this movie.,1482537600,,110,3.782608695652174
7804139,4,6300182649,"Plenty of vintage Sellers here. Reminiscent of the wonderful ""Mouse That Roared"" with the multiple roles Sellers plays.",1433289600,,119,5.666666666666667
7804140,3,6300182649,"This is Peter Sellers at his most madcap.  It has little to do with Hope's novel nor with the Ronald Colman nor S. Granger versions of that novel.  It has less to do with ""Zenda"" than did Tom Baker's Dr. Who (Androids of Tara) version.  It relates to Zenda as much as the Sellers-Niven-Woody Allen ""Casino Royale"" has to do with Ian Fleming.",1418342400,,341,4.380952380952381
7804141,5,6300182649,"If you like Peter Sellers , you'll appreciate this movie as he plays more than one role . The street smart , self made working class hero and the spoiled worthless , weak king , who's environment has given him political power but no strength of character .",1399075200,,256,4.354166666666667
7804142,5,6300182649,"I was so excited to see this film in Blue Ray, finally!  This is one of my all time favorite films.  If you are one who does not like films taking the original story as just a suggestion then maybe this one is not for you. Otherwise, you will like I think .",1398643200,,257,3.830188679245283
7804143,5,6300182649,One of my favorites of Peter Sellers. I will probably where out the tape and will have to buy another.,1393977600,,102,4.15
7804144,4,6300182649,"The Leonard Maltin Movie Guide assigns this film the BOMB rating.  Does anybody there ever watch the movies they are trashing?  This is thoroughly engaging lighthearted entertainment.  Peter Sellers assumes multiple roles not as memorably as he did in past films but it'll do.  The Austrian landscape where the film was made is breathtaking and the production values are first rate.  Good supporting cast includes British film veteran Lionel Jeffries, Norman Rossington(""A Hard Day's Night""), Blake Edwards regular Graham Stark, and Gregory Sierra from TV's ""Barney Miller"".  This isn't classic stuff but it's good fare to pass the time.",1379635200,2,637,5.383838383838384
7804145,4,6300182649,"The movie is a loose retelling of ""The Prisoner of Zenda"" written by Anthony Hope, and contains all the comedy associated with Sellers in those ""Pink Panther"" movies that established Peter Sellers as an international star.  The first of three roles (the aging king) is dispensed with in the first few minutes of the film, and from there Sellers plays two roles, that of Syd and Rudolf.  The two are exact physical matches which is explained in the film.  All the ""Zenda"" plot is told with gags and comedy lacing almost every scene.  I saw this in 1979 and am very pleased to get to see it again in 2013, and it is still an entertaining film, with no pretension to be more.  The fine film score by Henry Mancini makes it even more enjoyable.",1371945600,3,740,4.451851851851852
7804146,3,6300182649,Peter Sellers made the film more than watchable. There were good performancenes by the supporting cast. The story line and script struggled at times. Still a watchable film with typical Sellers laughs.,1359849600,,201,5.3125
