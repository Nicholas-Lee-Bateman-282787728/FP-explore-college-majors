8316252,4,B001KVZGCA,My wife bought me this as a gift because I really enjoy rugby. This film shows a great depiction of the hardships and sacrifices players have to face while trying to make it to a higher level of rugby. Film work isn't all that great but the stories are great.,1458086400,,259,4.2
8316253,5,B001KVZGCA,"This is an excellent documentary that displays the sacrifice and heart of the rugby experience in America.  Having grown up in the USA rugby world from the age of 16, and then going on to play professionally in England at 24, I know the amount of strength, commitment, and sacrifice that goes into playing the game in America as opposed to any other country.  That's what this movie portrays.  It is not just a smash and grab expo on rugby as a whole, or simply a shallow promo of some of the players, like some have suggested it should be.  Even though it has tremendous action and shows USA scoring the ""Try of the World Cup"" against the eventual champions, South Africa, 'Try' takes a deeper look into the actual lives of the players and what they personally had to do in order to reach their goals.  In this way, anyone with lofty aspirations can relate to the people of this film and be inspired to achieve their own level of greatness.  I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film, and recommend it to every audience.",1243555200,8,1019,4.510869565217392
8316254,5,B001KVZGCA,"This is a great film! Especially, if you want to learn more about rugby.

I really liked the history of it - who knew that America is the only country to have won gold medals at the Olympics in Rugby.
The players stories are inspiring and they're awesome.
The film made me want to go and watch a game. A very good film for children to see.",1243036800,10,339,4.059701492537314
8316255,3,B001KVZGCA,"This is a fairly interesting documentary of three guys trying to make the USA Eagle rugby team for the 2007 World Cup. Though their personal stories are interesting, the film is a bit lacking. It would have been much better if the film would have been a little more in depth about the team, its stars, the training, and included some of the Eagles game highlights.",1242345600,4,364,4.53030303030303
