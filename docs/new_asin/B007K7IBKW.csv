8518808,1,B007K7IBKW,"The ""new"" (still wrapped in plastic cover) DVD that I received will not play on my DVD player; the same DVD player that I have used to  play all other Sharpe videos. It will also not play on my Mac Computer.",1434067200,,207,4.048780487804878
8518809,4,B007K7IBKW,I am buying the whole series. We like the historical perspective of a soldier's journey through the Napoleonic Wars.,1418342400,,116,5.157894736842105
8518810,3,B007K7IBKW,"Don't try and fool me that you have enough extras for a full regiment or company. I've bought this blu-ray release hoping the production values had gone up from the first two shows but no. I just can't watch 20 or 30 men marching around pretending they are a larger unit. Also paper mache canons are a joke and showing the same scene over and over again to fill out your time. You don't have to over act and loop scenes to make a good show. Decent acting, good writing, and a capable director can make low budget shows works.",1353283200,,525,4.26
