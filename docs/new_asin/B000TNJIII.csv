2907540,5,B000TNJIII,"It is very enlightening to watch Wes' hands as he plays, and see how he uses the fretboard. I've been playing a long time, and this video has given me a new way to approach my instrument. I would recommend this to any guitarist that wants to play jazz.",1201478400,3,252,4.163265306122449
2907541,5,B000TNJIII,"I've tried but never really got why he was considered so great. For example, 'Smokin at the half note' really underwelmed me. However, this stuff is amazing! I'm converted! His style is nuanced and subtle rather than flashy, but everything about his playing that makes him great and unique is on display here. The sound is well restored. If you like jazz, you won't regret getting this one.",1200096000,4,390,4.75
2907542,4,B000TNJIII,"This new release is better than anything I've seen previously. Let's face it, anything (audio-visual) produced back in the sixties lacked the technology that exists today. Most of the footage looks like it was shot on a TV soundstage. But, if you have never seen this man perform, this documentation is well worth the $20 price tag. There are closeups of his hands playing and enhanced AV, that make this more revealing than the Legends of Jazz Guitar series. Anyone who is a student of this instrument, will benefit from this disc.",1195257600,5,532,4.793478260869565
2907543,5,B000TNJIII,Excelent. Wes Montgomery at his best!!! Three takes from Television wich demostrate the qualiity of a great performer. I would say that this DVD is a must. Buy It and you won't regret it,1192492800,,186,4.5
2907544,5,B000TNJIII,"Finally, this DVD makes available a 78 minute collection of 3 European TV videos of the Jazz guitar master Wes Montgomery w/ 3 different trios backing him in mostly his compositions... the music is an inspiration & watching the many camera angles of Wes playing guitar is a revelation to anyone who admires this legendary innovator [who stands with gypsy Django Reinhardt & Les Paul as the 3 most influential Jazz guitarists of this past century]... Montgomery's right hand thumb strumming & picking is uniquely innovative to his sound & in this video, you can marvel at this amazing technique again & again as he is breezin' thru his chord soloing & octave melodies... i especially enjoy the 2nd set in Belgium as Wes really swings w/ an all black jazz musician's trio behind him burnin' thru ""Impressions"" & ""Jingles"" as well as 3 other tunes... this DVD is an ""Instant Classic"" that belongs in any serious jazz-influenced guitarist's collection !!! the liner notes by Pat Metheny are very detailed & great to read in addition to watching Wes finally in a full length DVD... this amazing video has reinspired my love of Wes Montgomery like the Grappelli 2 DVD set does for my love Django's playing = Buy It if you love virtuoso Jazz Guitar !",1191542400,19,1243,4.732718894009216
2907545,5,B000TNJIII,"Where do I start..? first... I have been playing the guitar for more than 40-years as a pro..and last 15-years as a jazz guitarist. This DVD has three parts..the second part was available in portions under the Ginus of Jazz guitar Vol 1 and 2.

However...this DVD has cleaned and restored the picture and sound to a level that it is just amazing from  T.V. shows recording back in 60's.

Now about the content. The minute I started watching Wes in the first concert talking to the piano player and the band and teaching them a new tune by just casualy speaking and smoking ....my god..Wes Montgomery was alive and well speaking about music right in my living room.

I would say the way he plays the guitar and plays all his ideas one after another with such ease and smile..makes you cry...

Confession...the last three days I have been going home make myself a drink and playing this DVD and sit there and weep.

See ...I grew up listening and envy this guy..now I can actualy see him play....

I have seen many many jazz guitar artists play live and on screen...to me nothing beats Wes.

There are and they were lots of guitar players that as far as instrument technique have been superior ...but NOBODY had the SOUL and the GROOVE of the WES...when he gets going..the whole band is riding on his tale..as if by god I can't beleive this. he had a incredable GROOVE and sense of SWING that made the drummers happy as a kid in a candy store....

Ask any jazz guitar player what kind of guitar sound are they after ...I bet more than 90% will say I like my guitar to sound like Wes..and in the DVD you see what he is using..the Wes Montgomery Model Gibson L-5 (one pick-up only) and Standler tube amp which were being made since 1953...they still make them  around $4000.00.

Now...this DVD is a must for anybody who likes jazz, anybody who playes the guitar, anybody who likes incredable visual music experience..and more...

Last...in my opinion the reason Wes elevated the Jazz guitar to another level was...he played it as a guitar not trying to emulate piano or horn lines as lots of guitar playes did or still do ( he used lots of bluesy runs and double stops and block chords)...anothewords...the way he plays ..it can only be reproduced on the guitar...not on any other instrument..and that my friends... will stay forever...!!  enough already..by the DVD...make it number one on Amazon..he deserves it....!!",1189555200,50,2415,4.614485981308412
2907546,5,B000TNJIII,"!Wow

I see why Pat Metheny said this is guy was the best Jazz guitarist in the world. This dvd showcases 3 Wes Montgomery concerts and shows rare footage never before seen. Simply put, Wes was a guitar genius and there will never be another like him, Get this dvd.",1189468800,,265,4.3
2907547,5,B000TNJIII,"All the Jazz Icons are real treasures. To capture Wes Montgomery on film is a rare and joyous event. It is a real shame that we didn't
have the kind of coverage then,  that we have now, for half the talent.",1407456000,,206,4.024390243902439
2907548,5,B000TNJIII,Great DVD!,1406419200,,10,4.5
2907549,5,B000TNJIII,"Mr. Montgomery is my absolute favorite musician. I love his jazz guitar style, he is in my opinion one of a kind artist. I love this concert DVD",1401840000,,144,4.178571428571429
2907550,5,B000TNJIII,"I have a fan of Wes Montgomery for many , many years. all the way back to the 50's and 60'. I was so taken by where he recorded some his music that I and my wife last visit Bern Switzerland and to the club where he had done some of his recording on the DVD, Bern Switzerland",1396396800,,274,3.7413793103448274
2907551,5,B000TNJIII,"This is a great way to see Wes do his thing.  The practice sessions are great!  He is truly a genioius, and you can see that by the way he directs the band during these rehearsals.  A must see!",1395619200,,193,3.8974358974358974
2907552,5,B000TNJIII,"Let's agree that the amount of available video footage of Mr. Montgomery is diminutive to say the least.
These three short sets filmed in Europe in 1965 are a blessing to those of us too young to have ever seen Wes Montgomery in person. Granted that of the three sets, the British cats do come off 'a bit tight'. However; it still swings because of Wes'
phrasing, his choice of notes, his rhythms, and his ability to groove. This is just a great package from the folks at Jazz Icons.
Lastly, this is a perfect compliment to the 12 CD box set of Wes Montgomery's complete Riverside recordings.
As world famous jazz DJ Alan Grant used to say, ""Stay beautiful!""
Wes Montgomery is beautiful, man!",1392508800,,692,4.544
2907553,5,B000TNJIII,"If you play, or aspire to play, electric guitar you simply must have this DVD. Watch it over and over again. You will be amazed and inspired.",1374278400,,141,4.2592592592592595
2907554,5,B000TNJIII,"It is the genius of Wes Montgomery, LIVE, with brief snippets of him rehearsing too.  An important historical document.  Great sound and video quality.  I'd give it 6 stars if I could....",1362441600,,187,4.78125
2907555,5,B000TNJIII,"What else can I say, except that to listen to Wes, is to be inspired.  Even today, Wes Montgomery adds new dimensions to jazz.  Go ahead and take a listen to The King!",1361577600,,167,4.03030303030303
2907556,5,B000TNJIII,"Great dvd worth twice the price. This is my second one. The first copy was borrowed by a friend and fellow guitarist. When I didn't get it back after a year, I decided to let him keep it and purchase another one! This should be in EVERY guitarist's collection. This dvd shows some incredible footage of Wes! It also displays that element of cool that was/is shared by all of the great jazz musicians - controlled excitement! Look at Prez, Bird, Peterson or Wes and you will see all of them tell beautiful , colorful and exciting stories on their instruments but do it effortlessly! I  also agree with Pat Metheny - it is impossible after viewing Wes' interaction with Pim Jacobs that anyone can logically say Wes had no music theory!",1359072000,,733,4.553030303030303
2907557,4,B000TNJIII,YOu can really tell who is comfortable playing with Wes and who isn't. No so much for the European guys.  Wes is boss,1348531200,,117,4.086956521739131
2907558,4,B000TNJIII,"Review: DVD; Wes Montgomery Live in '65.

Great DVD. Fantastic archival footage of the great Wes Montgomery and his supremely talented band members. Close up shots as rarely seen in music video footage of this age. Beautifully presented, with titles introducing each song. Good quality audio (for its time). This video really captures the 1960's vibe. The only reason it is not five stars is that it is in black and white. Digital coloring would have been good.",1337472000,,461,4.910256410256411
2907559,4,B000TNJIII,"Wes Montgomery needs no introduction as one of the premier jazz guitarists--arguably THE premier jazz guitarist--of all time. Here he is seen in three diverse settings, playing with pick-up bands from across Europe. These three performances from 1965 demonstrate Montgomery playing at his very finest, and laughing and chatting with his bandmates. For being filmed in 1965, the production comes close to current concert-film standards, providing frequent looks at Montgomery's left or right hand to try and reveal his technique in a particular moment. Attention is also paid to the musicians he is playing with, strong jazz musicians in their own right. Perhaps the best part for me, however, is how frequently the camera shows Montgomery smiling as he plays, showing how much he enjoys the experience of playing with these groups. One of the most rewarding sequences is the rehearsal for ""The End of a Love Affair,"" where Montgomery describes the chord changes to his pianist. Humble, cheerful, warm and good-natured, Montgomery quips about how the guitar is ""not a perfect instrument"" and even spares a few compliments for his bandmates as they rehearse.

The performances themselves are fantastic, as this is the same year when Montgomery would record ""Smokin' at the Half Note"" with the Wynton Kelly Trio, one of the great live jazz guitar records. The introduction by Pat Metheny is informative as well, providing insight on this period in Montgomery's career. The facts that the combined footage lasts only 80 minutes and the tracks are in mono are the only detractors, but they're small things. Overall, this is an excellent buy for any jazz guitar fan, an excellent display of a humble man and his incredible talent.",1327622400,2,1724,5.135231316725979
2907560,5,B000TNJIII,"Anything I say here won't do it justice.  I play this dvd at work, at home.  Sometimes I sit and watch it on my sofa with a glass of wine, sometimes I wash dishes or do homework and play it in the background without watching.  It often takes priority over my jazz cds.  The music speaks for itself, but the video is an added bonus.  The music clarity is crisp and beautiful.  The video is from 1965 and still satisfying (naturally not Blueray)...I have no regrets, and I'm the first to criticize!  The guy is amazing and the guys at Reelin' in the Years Productions did a great job.  I haven't found better video quality on Wes yet.  The stage chat is fun.  Nice booklet too!  Alas, Wes is now playing guitar to a backing of harps and wings, but he'll always be in my living room!",1307404800,,780,4.238095238095238
2907561,5,B000TNJIII,I feel that it this is one of the best DVDs out If  you like Jazz you'll lov this DVD. It will give all of Wes fans a chance to see how great he really was.,1303084800,,156,3.3333333333333335
2907562,5,B000TNJIII,"I feel that this is a must own for any jazz guitar player or fan of Wes Montgomery. It is comprised of three sessions with Wes playing with various groups. The first section with the band in Holland is superb. It's nice to hear Wes talk and teach a tune to the band. The second section is great, but has been previously released on Legends of Jazz Guitar Vol. 1 which I already own. The third section in England is okay. At the very least, it's nice to have.

Overall, a great DVD and learning tool for a guitar student or a great piece of music and history for lovers of Wes.",1292630400,3,576,4.142857142857143
2907563,5,B000TNJIII,"If you enjoy jazz, especially Wes Montgomery, do yourself a favor and pick this up.  Watching Wes play guitar makes me want to hang mine up, or practice my rear off.  This is just great footage of a legend.",1285891200,,206,4.256410256410256
2907564,5,B000TNJIII,"I've loved this man since I was in my twenties. What a gift to the world this man was! If you love jazz, grab this dvd. You won't be disappointed. Wes will teach you it's ok to be different!",1284163200,,190,3.8974358974358974
2907565,5,B000TNJIII,This video shows Wes as the knowledgeable musician who is in total control of his instrument and his craft. I enjoyed it so much that I purchased a second video to share with a friend.,1255996800,,184,4.285714285714286
2907566,5,B000TNJIII,"Amazingly clear footage with great shots in a relaxed atmosphere that captures  Wes' character, relaxed approach and technique to his awesome playing style.  The dialogue between Wes and the piano player in working out a tune gives a glimpse into their chord knowledge and experience.  I've been playing for over 40 years and was influenced by Wes and Kenny Burrell in my beginning years.  I recommend this video for any serious jazz guitarist.",1255046400,5,444,5.041095890410959
2907567,5,B000TNJIII,"As I have mentioned on more than one other occasion in reviewing various musical genres, what goes around comes around. On the basis of doing a review of the legendary and ground-breaking Texas blues guitarist T-Bone Walker a friend sent me a this DVD of jazz guitarist Wes Montgomery. Well, although jazz is not my main area of interest (except where it intersects, as it does in many places, the blues) of course I knew the name, if not the specific work, of Wes Montgomery.

What we have here is very lovingly done tribute to Brother Montgomery, as part of a jazz icon series, by showcasing a set of three European performances in 1965 done during the prime of his jazz powers. Look, I know folk guitar and many of its virtuoso players backward and forward. I know rock guitar and many of its virtuoso performers as well. I know blues guitar and its virtuoso performers, like the above-mentioned T-Bone Walker, backward, forward and side way. I cannot same the same for the jazz guitar. I can say, though, off viewing this series of performances that Mr. Wes Montgomery fits very comfortably in that virtuoso category.",1250640000,,1121,4.719387755102041
2907568,5,B000TNJIII,"It is well known that Wes Montgomery is the greatest of all Jazz guitarists. Indeed, who can we compare to him? When waching these performances I am struck by the sheer control Wes exercised over his instrument. His capacity to create the most interesting and inventive octave, block chord, and single-note lines are not only without paralel among jazz guitarists, but I dare say that he stands with only a handful of the greatest Jazz musicians on any instrument. We are very lucky to have these video performances of Wes, which feature examples of some of his finest work. The quartet here that featured Harold Maeburn is also one of the best Wes ever had. Never has a Jazz musician been better portrayed on video.",1250121600,3,716,4.736

2907571,3,B000TNJIII,"I never saw Wes play (just a bit too young), only heard him.  Been a big fan for decades.  I have to say the Holland set was worth the price of admission.  The sets are in decreasing order of quality.

Holland set was great.

The Belgium set is more structured and much less at ease than the Holland set.

The English set revealed one thing.  English audio engineers did not know how to record jazz (take the bass volume down a notch and lower the drum mics by 2 feet) and English guys didn't know how to swing. Even Wes couldn't drag them along.  The set was by far the worst of the three. The English set bassist was Rick Laird  (Mahavishnu Orch.) Good thing he took up photography.  As for Ronnie Scott... A bit pretentious.. What say?

From a historical perspective, I am glad to own it. Maybe they should have changed the order to Belgium, England and Holland.  End on a high note. (Pun intended.)",1234569600,2,902,4.335329341317365
2907572,5,B000TNJIII,"If you love Wes you need to buy this DVD. Wes' playing is top notch on these video performances and it is a joy to watch the master in action.
Very tasty indeed.",1233964800,2,161,3.909090909090909
2907573,5,B000TNJIII,"I never realized Wes was this good.

Move over Jimi, Mahavishnu and the human race, Wes is the man.

This music flows from his heart with simplicity and power, as well as with complexity and surrender.",1233014400,2,201,4.555555555555555
2907574,5,B000TNJIII,I have been playing guitar for 45 years. I had no idea how good Wes was live. I'm truly amazed at this video. I don't think anyone plays that well. This had to be his best performances ever recorded.,1229472000,4,199,4.128205128205129
2907575,5,B000TNJIII,This DVD is part of a series of European concert and studio footage of great jazz musicians.  The segments on this DVD are well recorded and excellent performances of Wes Montgomery.  Informative booklet is included.,1228176000,,216,5.142857142857143

The Dutch sidemen seem to push Wes to an even higher level of energy, inspiration, peerless musicianship, unimpeachable swing and unlimited soul.
Despite the lack of audience Wes and his Dutch bandmates manage to fill the television studio with some genuine musical heat as they - completely unprepared - work through a three part programme stamped with Wes's awesome virtuosity.
