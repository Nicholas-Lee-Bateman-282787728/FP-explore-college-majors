8578495,4,B00C7Z1KXW,"This is a great movie for anyone who wants to understand the transition from studios to independent productions. This movie has two stars who were bankable at the time: Les Barker and Merle Oberon. It is a taut, less than two hour, movie. The cinematography is excellent. All the performances are excellent. Growing up in a small town, movies like this were the staple of drive-ins and second features in theaters. If you don't like this movie, it is because you don't understand anything about American Culture.",1454630400,,512,4.896551724137931
