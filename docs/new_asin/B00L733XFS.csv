8664184,5,B00L733XFS,"Small Small Thing is a history lesson about Liberia and the struggles of the young girls (women) of that nation. Olivia's life story is full of heart retching, tears flowing details that you will struggle with throughout. I can see why the documentary has won so many awards. Watch it and you will find a place in your heart for Olivia.",1409184000,,336,4.524590163934426

8664186,5,B00L733XFS,A view into what seems like another world. Olivia's story is captivating. It is maddening and sad to learn how so many in Liberia are victims of a broken society.,1406764800,,162,4.433333333333334

8664188,5,B00L733XFS,"This film reminds me of the TV show The Wire. Both The Wire and Small Small Thing (SST) tell the story of specific people, but by doing so, also tell the store of a place and a society. SST follows the story one very charismatic little girl, that has suffered a great injustice. But the story goes deep. Great injustice is rarely an isolated case, it usually has deep roots, which are all explored in this wonderfully made film.

It's an amazing view into a world that western city-dwellers like myself rarely see this up close. I highly recommend it.",1403654400,4,551,4.51

8664190,5,B00L733XFS,"I have seen this documentary numerous times and have never found it boring. The film is heart wrenching, but engaging telling the story of a young girl's desperate circumstances in Liberia and the people who attempt to help her. I believe that most people have no idea of the serious situation that continues there for girls, and Jessica Vale's documentary tells it well with gritty but beautiful photography. Olivia's tale is a sad one, but one you must see to truly understand man's inhumanity to man( or in this case, young girls). Hopefully it will encourage us all to do something about it. Bravo Jessica and Nika, excellent job!",1403568000,4,634,4.825688073394495
