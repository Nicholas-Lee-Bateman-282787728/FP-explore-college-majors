RAW Tag Team Champions New Day vs. The Club - The Club tried to get a jump on their opponents right at the bell leaving them able to focus on only one member using illegal tactics along with impactful moves only for the New Day to rebound with Big E using his strength & Kofi with his athletic ability as both teams used similar strategies throughout the match such as double team maneuvers in an entertaining opener.

Crusierweight Champion T.J. Perkins vs. Brian Kendrick - Kendrick attempted to control the body early on with different tactics from basic wrestling to taking advantage of the ring environment while TJP used his mix of athleticism & submission tactics only for Kendrick to match him on the submission tactics as both men either used offense seen before only with a more physical result or unique combinations never seen before including one that ended up taking both men out in what was a great showcasing of different styles of offense from both men.

Cesaro vs. Sheamus - The last match in their ""Best Of Seven Series"" with each man tied at 3-3 with Sheamus heavily focusing on the back that he injured earlier in the series from various types backbreakers to different strikes & dropping weight directly to that area of the body while Cesaro focused on a more diverse style relying on his trademark uppercuts to executing offense from different positions in the ring from a springboard corkscrew to the top rope including a move never seen from him before straight out of ""San Diego"" & one move that was he was able to walk after the scary landing as they continued to trade momentum back & forth from counters & reversals to submissions to their signature finishers with the action being unable to be contained inside the ring as both men literally beat each other into exhaustion in what was a very physical match & definitely saved the best match for last in this series with the only negativity about it being the final result depending on how you want to look at it.

Sami Zayn vs. Chris Jericho - Zayn went after Jericho with aggression early both in the ring & on the floor to go after him on the outside while Jericho was able to take advantage of his aggression on more than one occasion returning the aggression using his environment to his advantage as they went back & forth with utilizing counters & high risk maneuvers along with some impactful offense taking the action both in & outside of the ring that ultimately came down to one man being able to catch the other with this being the strongest performance from Zayn in weeks & Jericho in months.

Womens Champion Charlotte vs. Sasha Banks vs. Bailey - Three of the ""Four Horsewomen of NXT"" face off here for the championship with one woman having ""tunnel vision"" focusing on only one opponent wanting her for herself causing her other opponent to let her know that ""I'm in this match too"" resulting in those two going at it as there were various moments here such as all the women going for the same move at the same time, utilizing all areas of the ring to their advantage, more than just the legal participants making their presence known, the women attempting the strategies of either ""divide & conquer"" or taking out both at the same time & various times where the pin attempt was broken by the third competitor or even attempting to steal the pin in a very good match full of cool exchanges & near falls.

United States Champion Rusev vs. Roman Reigns - Rusev attempted to keep him grounded with a strategy of ""ground & pound"" along with taking shortcuts when possible both in the ring & on the floor being able to stop any attempt at offense before Roman was able to mount some momentum giving Rusev back some of the same punishment he received as both men traded momentum with Rusev relying on his strong kicks & taking advantage of any distractions in his favor while Reigns continued to use his power to reverse & counter while taking advantage of his environment as well in a solid match.

WWE Universal Champion Kevin Owens vs. Seth Rollins - Seth came into the match full of adrenaline as he kept a ""hit & move"" offense on Owens using various kicks & acting aggressively on the outside before Owens was able to target Seth's previously injured knee while also giving receipts for the punishment he took earlier while using material from other's playbook as they traded momentum utilizing the same strategy as trading kicks to getting more aggressive over time from a clothesline that turned an opponent inside out to a maneuver off the top rope were you saw the effects when he receiver went high risk himself as a good main event with the only negative being the finish depending on how you want to look at it.

The kickoff show match was Nia Jax vs. Alicia Fox.  This was a strong show for RAW to debut on as a separate brand with the only criticism being how some of the matches ended again depending on how you want to look at it but the action was here & not a bad match on the card.",1475452800,2,5069,4.55543358946213
8763499,4,B01GU20VPU,"The first Raw only show in sometime, since the brands split, again. Every Raw title up for grabs and some backstage segments as usual. Maybe not as many as I would have liked, but most of the actual in-ring action made up for it. The Main draw no doubt being the Universal Title and the Women's match.

Other matches of note--Y2J and Sami, Cesaro and Sheamus. I guess it wasn't too long after this, Foley got the idea to throw them together as a makeshift team; an idea that's been done so many times you can't cite everyone (Booker T. and Golddust), but I guess the idea panned out. :-)

Probably some better Raw only shows in the future (Hell in a Cell), but everything can't be 5 stars. Good entertainment, at any rate...",1525824000,,724,4.395522388059701

CLASH OF CHAMPIONS 2016

This was the first PPV for the RAW brand after the brand split.

1. NIA JAX VS ALICIA FOX-these two had been going at it for a few weeks prior to this, Fox was doing the whole crazy thing. This was a pretty good opening match for the event. Much better than I thought it was going to be as Fox put up a bit of a fight. Still Jax was too much for her ending it with a Samoan Drop.

2.[TAG TITLES]NEW DAY VS THE CLUB-this was a great way to start off the PPV portion of the event. These two teams work extremely well together. The action kicks off real fast as The Club just attack and take it to the New Day early. They just beat of the all three guys until the tide changes just a little. But Gallows and Anderson looked real strong here in a fun match. Woods though would lend a hand in his partners win as he nailed Gallows with Francesca. The New Day retain in a real fun match.

3.[CW TITLE]T.J. PERKINS VS THE BRIAN KENDRICK-we follow that tag match with another fun and fast paced encounter. These two at the time were the main story coming out of the Cruiserweight Classic. Of course they put on a great match full of wonderful action from both. T.J. wins but Brian lays him out after the match.

4. CESARO VS SHEAMUS-this was the final match in their best of seven series, it had been a while since one of these series had occurred. This match felt like a brawl and real fight as these two have great chemistry. This was a back and forth battle that ended in a draw as they just beat each other from in the ring to outside of it.

5. CHRIS JERICHO VS SAMI ZAYN-the battle of Kevin Owens buddies, well one former. These two had a really good match with Jericho and Zayn taking it to each other. This was a good back and forth battle with Jericho taking the victory after a from nowhere code breaker.

6.[TRIPLE THREAT WOMENS TITLE]CHARLOTTE VS SASHA BANKS VS BAYLEY-these three women really work well together and it shows well here. All three women looked great here and all had some wonderful moments. Plenty of near falls and action including that moonsault finish for Charlotte.

7.[U.S. TITLE]RUSEV VS ROMAN REIGNS-the feud that would see Reigns act more like a heel than the actual heel. This was actually a better match than most people I knew thought it would be. Of course with these guys it was a hard hitting match with both guys looking good. Lana of course made her presence known only to be kicked out of the match and forced to the back. Reigns of course continues to get his push and wins the U.S. title.

8.[UV TITLE]KEVIN OWENS VS SETH ROLLINS-one of the best matched of the night, possibly the best really. These two had a good story going in with Triple H turning on Rollins in favor of Owens. This was a fast paced match that even went outside involving tables. This match would see Chris Jericho and Steph getting involved one way or another. This was a great match between two of the best in WWE with Owens retaining.
