8419896,5,B004AB2F3K,"Not being encumbered by any knowledge of ballet, but being a professional musician, and long-time lover of the arts, particularly symphony and opera ... I enjoyed this performance greatly, as much as I believe anyone can :)",1405987200,,223,5.054054054054054
8419897,5,B004AB2F3K,"I love this ballet enough that I went ahead and purchased the La Scala production - I already owned the Pacific Northwest Ballet one - despite Natalia Olivera's warning that it was incomplete.  Lo and behold, the copy I got is complete, ending, as it should, with Puck ascending.  Can someone explain this?  In any case, I am grateful there are two excellent versions available.",1357257600,6,378,4.7846153846153845
8419898,4,B004AB2F3K,"Excellent performance of a Balanchine masterpiece.  Alessandra Ferri is a pleasure to watch as Titania.  The excellent orchestra, chorus and soloists are far better their counterparts on Pacific Northwest Ballet DVD.  I would still love to see a DVD of the 1967 New York City Ballet production of A Midsummer Night's Dream filmed by Columbia Pictures with the incomparable Suzanne Farrell as Titania.",1350777600,3,400,5.317460317460317

8419900,3,B004AB2F3K,"I would recommend this beautiful DVD for the dancing...but the last 5 minutes or so of the ballet have been excised! Yikes!!

First, the good - The Dancing! Ferri, as expected, is wonderful as Titania, but equally impressive are other La Scala soloists, such as Brazzo and Zeni in the Act II pas de deux.

Now the not-so-good:  Alas, folks familiar with the Balanchine ballet will be deeply disappointed that this La Scala version abruptly ends with the 'Italian Divertissement' of which the pdd is the centerpiece. In other words, there's no final reconciliation in the palace & no final scene at the forest, with Puck rising above the stage. For this reason alone, I give this DVD 3 stars. Sorry, I like my ballet DVDs of purportedly ""complete"" ballets to be truly complete. I was shocked and kept wondering if my DVD was flawed...but I see that the earlier TDK DVD release of this film also ran 104 minutes.",1323043200,9,910,4.675
