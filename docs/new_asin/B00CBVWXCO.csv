5713274,3,B00CBVWXCO,"From previous reviews I was expecting a great movie. This was not that great a movie. The actors weren't outstanding, especially the dad. Would not recommend.",1381708800,2,158,5.115384615384615
5713275,5,B00CBVWXCO,A lovely story that displays the magic of a youths imagination. A long absent parent comes back into two boys lives only for his personal selfish reasons.,1378944000,,154,4.7407407407407405
5713276,5,B00CBVWXCO,"This film is imaginative, fun and heartwarming. It hasn't come out of my DVD player since I received it. Please give it a try and pass it on to your friends. The children really deserve some recognition.",1378771200,,203,4.513513513513513
5713277,5,B00CBVWXCO,"Boy brought back memories of my childhood. Not all of them pleasant, but all of them a reminder of who I am and how far I have journeyed in life. Throughout the difficult times of my life, my Maori sense of humour has always helped me through. Taika Waititi understands this and portrays it through all of his characters. This is movie is bittersweet for me.",1377043200,10,358,4.4393939393939394
5713278,5,B00CBVWXCO,"I absolutely adore this movie, and can watch it over and over again.  It's such a sweet, funny story.  The main character, Boy, age 11, worships his absentee father that he's glamorized in his mind (though he's actually in jail), and one day, ol' dad returns.  Boy tries to be like his father and tries to impress him, and over time, slowly starts to see his father for who he really is - and that's a guy who's not so great after all.  His younger brother, Rocky, is the sensitive, perceptive one, and he has a special little storyline that just makes me love him even more.  I never expected to fall in love with a goat, either, but damnit if they don't make you love that animal!  The entire movie takes place over a very short time frame (maybe a week?) and we get to see how much Boy changes over that time.  I laughed, I cried, and I've watched it several times since I bought it (and have also made others watch it).  At an hour and a half running time, it's an easy flick to fit in to even the busiest schedules.  Highly recommend.",1376265600,8,1039,4.233502538071066
5713279,5,B00CBVWXCO,This movie is one of my new favorites and I recommend it to everyone. Everyone from young to old will appreciate this witty movie.,1375401600,3,130,4.458333333333333
5713280,5,B00CBVWXCO,Loved this movie.  Great acting.  Weird. Funny. Emotional.  This movie has made me a huge follower of the talent coming out of New Zealand.,1524614400,,139,4.708333333333333
5713281,4,B00CBVWXCO,This was an outstanding little slice of life movie with some phenomenal acting on the part of the kids though it wasn't without some tedious moments. Its in English but I had to use the Closed Captions.,1523750400,,202,4.486486486486487
5713282,4,B00CBVWXCO,"Can Taika Waititi do no wrong? With Hunt for the Wilderpeople, Thor: Ragnorok and this movie, he's in the running with Denis Villeneuve as my favorite active filmmaker. Like those movies, it tells an engrossing story about the dark side of colonialism. Set in the 80s in a small town populated by Maori, it follows brothers Boy and Rocky, whose mother died during Boy's birth and whose father is in prison. Not unlike some Native American reservations, their hometown is a neglected place with few legal ways to make money. The brothers cope through fantasy, Boy by idolizing Michael Jackson and the more introverted Rocky by drawing comic books with him as a superhero. Their father, played by Waititi, unexpectedly returns home from prison, but unfortunately for the brothers, he's more interested in pursuing his own fantasy - one of buried treasure - than in being a dad. Like Waititi did with Wilderpeople, Boy proves how adept he is at blending moments of pain and tragedy with funny and joyful ones. It deftly proves that flights of fancy can bring joy to any situation and are probably necessary to make life bearable, but there are consequences when they're taken too far. After all, no matter how long the flight, we all have to come back to Earth. With the Lord of the Rings movies, Peter Jackson proved that New Zealand is an incredibly beautiful country. Boy and Wilderpeople also prove this, and thankfully, we have them so we can see what life is like in New Zealand outside the Middle Earth frame.",1523404800,,1513,4.778625954198473

5713286,5,B00CBVWXCO,This was a magical movie that takes us through a child and his brother's imagination. The scenery and the music gave me goosebumps. The powers the little boy Rocky has from his mother. It's really good movie and makes you feel like a child from being to end. It's a must see and must have in your collection for sure!,1517097600,,317,4.3
5713287,3,B00CBVWXCO,"Enjoyable but not as good as the reviews would have me believe.  I have seen other films by director Waititi and this one is similar in style.  Adorable main character and quirky supporting cast.  Also has a nice tribute to Michael Jackson, stay for the credits.  Fair amount of cussing but with the heavy accents its hardly noticeable.",1516838400,,336,4.741379310344827
5713288,5,B00CBVWXCO,"Poignant, funny, uplifting, and heartbreaking. Boy is somehow able to bottle up childhood innocence and the reckoning with adolescence, while also dealing with the pain of loss and abandonment. Though over the top in some ways, Boy is a subtle film that is a comedy if you aren't really paying attention, and is a coming of age story that is a bit different from the typical American movie.",1516060800,,390,4.75

5713291,5,B00CBVWXCO,"Man I love this show. I have watched it 10 times in the past year and it only gets better and better. There are a few F-bombs, so buyer beware...otherwise, this show is a classic. The humor is almost like a New Zealand version of Napoleon Dynamite.
Great stuff from Taika Waititi!",1514851200,,280,4.403846153846154
5713292,5,B00CBVWXCO,"This movie was the first I've seen in a long time that made me cry just as often as it made me laugh. Poignant and witty. I would watch this film a hundred times over. This film (as all good films do) left me lost in thought long after the credits ended.
(if you have trouble with the Kiwi accents, there's always subtitles)",1514764800,,324,4.158730158730159

5713294,5,B00CBVWXCO,Wonderful. One of the best films I have seen in a while. A beautifully acted and directed little gem.,1513123200,,101,4.368421052631579
5713295,5,B00CBVWXCO,Really enjoyed this movie.,1512259200,,26,5.75
5713296,3,B00CBVWXCO,"A fun little film, full of quirky characters.  plus a taste of a very different culture with a cool accent.  The plot is simple, with kids taking center stage, growing up quickly but not turning into Hollywood adults.  Accents can be hard to decipher at times.",1511568000,,260,4.608695652173913
5713297,5,B00CBVWXCO,"We love this film. If you have a pulse, you will love it too. Absolutely delightful, charming, and heartbreaking at the same time. So glad we found it on amazon. We've seen it twice.",1509926400,2,182,4.382352941176471
5713298,5,B00CBVWXCO,I thought this movie was very good. It has a cheesiness that makes it endearing. Very worth watching!,1509753600,,101,4.666666666666667
5713299,5,B00CBVWXCO,"At this point, I think I will love anything Taika Waititi does. Eagle Vs Shark was already one of my favorite movies.

For the film, there is a quirkiness to the movie that somehow, to me, translates to the movie feeling real and honest. It made me feel emotions very similar to ones I had myself growing. Too often the life lessons from coming of age style films are too on the nose. I think a good coming of age film will leave a little to interpret. In our own lives, there are few times when we change in a moment. It is usually over time. I think this film captures that well.",1508976000,,581,4.1415929203539825
5713300,3,B00CBVWXCO,"Looks like a cute movie in a lot of ways. Read several reviews and had the impression that it was a pretty family-friendly movie -- not heavy on graphic violence or sexuality. However, we sat down to watch it as a family (with younger children), and found that there was more coarse language than we prefer -- several F-bombs, even in the interaction between teacher and student. SO: interesting and amusing story; typical modern-movie language.",1508112000,,445,4.946666666666666
5713301,5,B00CBVWXCO,"AWESOME!  Waititi peers through the magical and unintentionally hilarious lens of a childs imagination to bring a tragic subject into focus. The writing is spot on. The tiniest details are tender, funny and gut wrenching. Rollestone and Eketone-Whitu are phenomenal young actors.  Like any right of passage, Boy is both heartbreaking and empowering.",1507766400,5,349,5.566037735849057
5713302,4,B00CBVWXCO,"would like to have seen an endearing friendship between the ""mental guy"" and ""the one who fell in the water"" and also between the ""big son"" and the ""other sons and woman at the house"", but overall it was heartwarming and you kinda have to hold your emotions in a couple scenes to not cry.the kids in this movie can act damn near better than the adults! haha",1507593600,,357,4.264705882352941
5713303,4,B00CBVWXCO,"beautifully shot in the New Zealand countryside. Coming of age tail..in the vein of so many other great movies (my life as a dog, toto the hero, stand by me, rushmore, etc.). If you liked Napolean Dynamite, you would probably enjoy this movie. Sweet and hilarious performances, touching lessons about life, family, tragedy, forgiveness, and the nature love that children have for their parents, even a a never-do-well like this boy's dad.",1507593600,,438,5.097222222222222
5713304,1,B00CBVWXCO,"This movie makes light of the deplorable parenting skills of Boy's father and doesn't adequately address the feelings of abandonment Boy feels.  Moreover, the socioeconomic situation in Boy's culture is treated as perfectly normal.",1507593600,,231,5.794117647058823
5713305,3,B00CBVWXCO,"Many reviewers complain of inability to understand the Kiwis depicted in this film. Did they lack closed caption subtitles now available with Prime?

The film is quirky. The hero, Boy, is an 11-year-old in charge of an assortment of children, some quite young. With the exception of Rocky, a younger brother, their identity is unclear. One might assume, however, that they are the offspring of an aunt who manages the neighborhood general store.

The house belongs to their grandmother, but she is absent for the duration of the film. Nothing indicates that the aunt is involved, but, her possible assistance aside, Boy is left to in charge. His father soon shows up with a couple of friends, after being jailed for most, if not all, of Rocky's life. The (arguable) adults move into the garage but offer no help. Rather, it's like more kids have joined the brood.

There are amusing scenes, but it's a stretch to call this a comedy. For example, because their mother died during his birth some eight years earlier, Rocky feels responsible. Indeed, compounding the tragedy of her death, he believes that he killed her. I fail to see any humor in that. Nor do I see any when the two boys must drag his pet goat home for burial after the father's car strikes and kills it.

Viewing scenes often disjointed and frequently boring, I was repeatedly tempted to stop watching. Despite focus on an atypical family, I continued, however, hoping to learn something about Maori life. Yet, having made it to the end, I'm skeptical that much was accomplished along those lines.",1507334400,,1563,4.799256505576208
5713306,5,B00CBVWXCO,"Found this movie after seeing ""What We Do In The Shadows,"" which was do-directed by Taika Waititi and Jemaine Clement (of Flight of the Concords). So happy to know about Waititi so I can watch out for his work in the future - BOY is a gorgeous and truthful film, and Waititi is a versatile and powerful performer, as well.",1507075200,,322,4.383333333333334

5713321,5,B00CBVWXCO,"What a beautifully done, heart-wrenching film. The coming-of-age story is a strange one, but well-worth the journey. One bad review claimed all the viewer saw was the poverty of the children and the irresponsibility of the adults, so of course, one star was merited. Really? This is a film, not a documentary, so if the poverty and irresponsibility upset you, then the movie more than accomplished its goal and should be lauded for its authentic portrayal. Taika Waititi is so brilliant, as the writer, director, and irresponsible father in the movie, I'm trying to find all his works!",1506211200,6,585,4.979591836734694

5713330,2,B00CBVWXCO,I don't see how it could be described as hilarious. It was sad to see the neglect of the children and annoying to watch the stupidity of the adult characters. Depressing.,1505606400,,170,4.516129032258065
5713331,5,B00CBVWXCO,"Beautifully touching and profound in its study of the basic need for love and, sometimes, the toxicity of love. Someone said that ""nothing happened""; it's just everyday life. No car chases or explosions, not even heroes or villains. Therein lies the beauty.
The unspoiled naturalness of the child actors contributed to the complete package. I love this film.

On a side note, If you've seen the movie ""Smoke Signals"" you will appreciate the similarities in theme and understated emotional turmoil.",1505520000,4,497,5.2125

5713358,3,B00CBVWXCO,"There were nice moments in this film, though I really didn't see it as much of a comedy.  It was sad to see the influence of such a messed up father on his boy.  I have nothing against smoking marijuana, though substance abuse being passed down to subsequent generations, are just not that funny.  I found it to be more of a drama that, sadly, plays itself over and over again all too much in the USA (and I am sure elsewhere too).

I have watched this film four times now, and each time I find a new layer of both joy and sadness. The performances from the actors are such a surprise. I cannot believe this film is not more popular here in the states. I only happened across is after being curious what else the director had done after I had watched ""What we do in the shadows""--an excellent film in a completely different genre. I'm quite surprised by the range this director possesses, and whatever he does in the future I will watch without hesitation.

I think the beauty of this movie comes from the director's ability to show us the perspective that Boy has on the world. We know why he feels the way he does, but we know it is sad, and it is hard to watch someone who has such hope and potential place so much faith in his dysfunctional father.

5713395,5,B00CBVWXCO,"Boy is a lovely film, and I think it's true charm lies not just in the hilarious and heartbreaking story, but in the two amazing lead child actors, James Rolleston and Te Aho Eketon-Whitu. I really loved how these two kids, and all the children who were in this film, were able to shine as they actually acted like children. I grew up in an area and situation similar to the area and plot and it's so refreshing to watch a movie and feel like it was made just for me.
Quirky is a pretty easy label to use for Taika Waititi's work but I think he just writes the stories he wants to writes and directs his movies the way he wants to direct them, and his sincerity and love for his characters is visible and what makes his movies so enjoyable. There is one beautiful scene towards the end of the film which has an almost Wes Anderson sensibility complete with roller skates and a firecracker, but the emotional resonance of a child's innocent confession, apologizing for the death of his mother, makes it more than just a nice scene to look at it.
I probably made this sound more somber than it actually is, because it's actually a very fun movie to watch. It's hilarious, it's beautifully shot, it has a very nice soundtrack and I'm so happy a film like this exists :-)",1455494400,15,1267,4.350210970464135

5713397,5,B00CBVWXCO,"Quite a good film, made in 2010 but set in 1984, this film follows around two weeks in the daily life of an 11 year old Maori boy who lives on a rural farm in a sparsely populated part of the New Zealand coastline.  His mother died giving birth to his younger brother, which was around the last time he saw his father. Boy's imagination has come up with an alternative hero like occupation and reasons for his abandonment which he tells other kids, who of course don't believe a word of it.

At his grandmother's farm, Boy is the man of the house, so when his grandmother decides to go on a trip to attend a funeral, she leaves him to run the house and look after the younger children that live there. So when his deep embellished recount of the days event conversation with his pet goat is interrupted when three men in a car pull up outside his house, he has to see what they want. The driver not recognising who this annoying nosey kid is at first, eventually realises that Boy is his son. Boy invites them in to stay, assuming his father is back in his life for good and will take him with him when he leaves to make the fantasy life he has been telling everyone else a reality. Of course the father is just there to find the loot from his crimes before he went to jail, only thing is he isn't bright enough to remember where he buried it so he'll have to stick around for a while.

A sort of reality check coming of age story for both the father and child, although the father isn't that interested in being anything than what he is. Although it is a sad sort of storyline for Boy and his brother, it is told in an amusing and not depressing way. It does have some mild violence in it but it's certainly no Once Were Warriors. Like the TV show Scrubs, there's plenty of fantasy imagination world scenes which are a lot of fun. The kid who plays Boy (James Rolleston) does a very good job, as does Taika Waititi who plays the father. You instantly dislike the father character as you need to for the film to work, so it's well played. Stay watching not only as the credits roll where you'll see a Thriller music video parody with elements of the haka intertwined but also when the credits are over you'll see Boy's pet goat from the film do the intro to the Billie Jean film clip.",1453593600,,2284,4.23394495412844

My brother in law is Maori, a professor, two wonderful children, married for 20 years. Probably wouldn't make a great movie. Perhaps a movie showing what it takes for Maori to overcome the racism and stereotyping they are subject to in the NZ schools would be a winner. The myth of we are all Kiwis and everything is swell is a joke. Maori children are told early and often by the dominant pakeha culture that they probably aren't going to acheive much academically, and hahaha it's OK, good on ya, we like to go fishing too. In the end the jokingly, stereotyping of Maori in New Zealand isn't funny. It is deep-seated racism, culturally and institutionally. Boy is a wonderful movie that captures an aspect of New Zealand beautifully and touchingly, but if it didn't also remind you of the inherent racism that Boy's life is a result of, then you need to take another look.",1441756800,,1047,4.664864864864865

Boy, about ten, narrates the story as he goes to school and manages the care of his younger brother, Rocky, and his cousins while their grannie is away for a funeral.  He and Rockys mother died giving birth to Rocky.  Boy has conflictual interactions with another boy over Boys father, whom Boy depicts as a war hero and a reincarnation of Michael Jackson (Boys idol).  His father is actually in jail for robbery.  The father shows up with a couple of cohorts and Boys naive adoration gradually begins to cave as the charming, talented, but utterly self-serving man reveals himself.

5713436,3,B00CBVWXCO,"""A Bronx Tale"" was an important meditation about divisions btwn the father you were born with and the father you choose.  ""Boyz N da Hood"" was partially praised because it showed a positive relationship btwn a Black man working hard to raise his son.  In the United States, in my community, many Black males don't have present fathers and many have incarcerated fathers.  I think we African Americans, but many others as well, can relate to the troubled or absent dynamics btwn a father of color and his son.  If you thought ""Once Were Warriors"" was sad, then prepared to be saddened by this work too.  Given that Michael Jackson has passed away, learning that he had a devoted young fan 1/2 a world away will be eye-opening.  This movie is profound and resonating.  However, I might only see it once 'cuz it also brings up sad realities that many can't take too often.  I think I heard it was a HUGE hit in New Zealand and it deserves that popularity.

5713455,5,B00CBVWXCO,"One of the reasons I like small indie films is that every now and then you come across a real gem. Taika Waititi's film, Boy, definitely qualifies. Set in 1984 in New Zealand, Boy is a coming-of-age comedy drama about an 11-year-old Maori boy - nicknamed Boy (winningly played by James Rolleston) - who worships pop star Michael Jackson and lives, along with a younger brother, an indeterminate number of cousins and a pet goat, with his grandmother in a rural Maori community on the coast. All of the kids lack parents, in Boy's case because his mother died giving birth to his younger brother and because his father hasn't been around for years, a condition for which Boy makes up elaborate fantasies, which the film reveals in the opening scene were Boy is giving a prepared talk to his class at school:

 ""Kia ora. My name is Boy, and welcome to my interesting world. My favorite person is Michael Jackson. He is the best singer and dancer in the world. My favorite subjects are art, social studies and Michael Jackson. I have a six-year-old brother called Rocky. He's got powers. I'm named after my dad. He can dance as good as Michael Jackson. He's a master carver, deep sea treasure diver, soldier, captain of the rugby team and he holds the record for punching out the most number of people with one hand. My dad isn't here right now. He's a busy man. When he comes home he's taking me to see Michael Jackson - live. The end.""

The reality of Boy's situation however quickly becomes clear when a classmate named Kingi taunts him after his talk:

Kingi: ""You're a liar. Your dad's not overseas; he's in jail for robbery.""
Boy: ""Shut up Kingi! You don't know!""
Kingi: ""Yes, he's in the same cell block as my dad.""

Most of Boy's life consists of helping his grandmother look after the younger kids, hanging out with his friends, and trying to impress an aloof older girl named Chardonnay (RickyLee Waipuka-Russell) on whom he has an impossible crush in spite of the fact that she's a teenager and towers over him by almost a foot. He's so fixated on Chardonnay that he's completely oblivious to Dynasty (Moerangi Tihore) a pretty but quiet girl closer to his own age who wistfully keeps hoping he'll notice her, at one point showing him a hidden grove of pot plants that belong to her uncle, who happens to be the biggest pot dealer in the area. (Note: Dynasty's name is apparently due to the pervasiveness of American pop culture of the time as she has a brother named Dallas and a sister named Falcon Crest).

When his grandmother (Mavis Paenga) suddenly has to leave for a funeral across the country and leaves him in charge for a week, no one is more surprised than Boy when his dad - Alamein (Taika Waititi) - suddenly shows up one night along with two low-life cohorts he claims are his gang. Boy is delighted. His younger brother Rocky (Te Aho Aho Eketone-Whitu) however is wary - Alamein is a complete stranger to him, having been absent his entire life.

Recently released from prison, Alamein says he's there to reconnect with his sons and spend some quality time with them. The reality though is that he's there to retrieve the money from the robbery he was in prison for, money that he buried in a field before getting caught. The problem is that he can't remember just where he buried it, having been seriously stoned at the time. It quickly becomes clear that in spite of his efforts to portray himself as a serious gangster, Alamein is instead as incompetent at being a criminal as he is at everything else, including being a father - at one point he tells Boy ""Can you stop calling me `dad'? It sounds weird."" It takes time, however, for this reality to penetrate Boy's continued fantasies, which the film frequently plays with by showing scenes with Boy repeatedly imagining Alamein in Michael Jackson videos. But as the facade is gradually worn away by his father's pathetic bumbling and self-absorbed irresponsibility, Boy finds himself having to choose between falling into his father's lifestyle of directionless denial or taking responsibility.

While the film is serious at times, given the nature of the themes involved, Waititi imbues it with a lot of unique humor, particularly in the idiosyncratic dialogue that gives flesh to the laid-back culture of Boy's rural Maori world, like in this typical exchange when Boy runs into some of his friends in a pasture:

Boy: ""So what you guys been up to?""
Dallas: ""We're self employed now.""
Boy: ""What's your job?""
Dallas: ""Chucking mud at those cows.""

While most of the actors in Boy are first-timers, Waititi did an exceptional job in selecting them and as a group they give very natural performances that don't feel affected at all. James Rolleston is highly engaging as Boy and his performance takes you in completely as he goes from a kid who goes from hero-worshipping a father he cannot remember to coming to grips with the harsh disappointment of just how far short of his idyllic fantasies his father falls. You can see the conflict rising in him as he teeters on the edge of becoming just like his father even as he's realizing just how little that really means. Te Aho Aho Eketone-Whitu's Rocky is equally engaging, a shy introvert to Boy's motor-mouthed extrovert. Like Boy, Rocky has an equally creative imagination, but while Boy's fantasies are centered around his father and the way he wishes the man to be, Rocky directs his inward, imagining himself to have mental powers that give him some control over a world where in fact he has no control. Their differences are brought out in other ways, as in a scene where we find that Rocky regularly spends time at his mother's grave, openly missing what he has never known, while Boy cannot bring himself to even open the gate to the graveyard, a characteristic we later see that he shares with his father - the tendency to shy away from the harsher realities of life. Another nice touch is the subtle ways in which, as Boy is starting to back away from their father, Rocky is starting to move closer, seeing the damaged man their father is and trying to use his imagined powers to fix him. And Taika Waititi's Allamein is a deft performance in its own right, finding just the right balance to make the man likeable and sympathetic while at the same time showing his pathetic weakness, revealing him to be a man who never really grew up and who has no idea of what it means to be responsible, let alone to be a father. And Moerangi Tihore's Dynasty is marvelously expressive in a quiet way, never really giving voice to her thoughts but you know exactly what she's feeling from her eyes - wistful as Boy gives a sparkler to Chardonnay who only seems bored by it; hurt and betrayed when she catches Boy showing Alamein and his cohorts where her uncle's secret pot grove is hidden. She doesn't have to say a word - Boy's guilty reaction shows that he knows from her eyes what he's done.

A couple of minor notes. Taika Waititi, a relatively new director, is best known for his first indie film, Eagle vs Shark, another off-beat comedy that's become something of a cult film. Boy was actually released in 2010, and although it turned out to be a hit and ultimately became the highest grossing film in New Zealand, it is only now making its way to the US. It may be hard to find, but it's definitely worth the effort.

And one other thing definitely worth mentioning is this fantastic and completely unexpected dance number that comes up at the end with all of the cast doing a traditional Maori haka dance mashed up with Michael Jackson's Thriller. While it has nothing to do with the plot, it brings all of the elements of the movie together and is enormously fun to watch. I looked it up and found it available on youtube if you want to check it out.

Highly recommended for anyone who likes coming of age movies, small indie films or just plain enjoyable films in general.",1386979200,18,7909,4.620640569395018
5713456,5,B00CBVWXCO,"OK, I have to admit this movie is pretty predictable.  Also, as some critical reviews have noted the actor playing the father is good but not great in the role--he manages to convey great love and affection for his sons very well but is less effective at projecting the sense of desperation and disappointment and fear for his sons' future that one would expect based on the plot.  HOWEVER, I absolutely loved this movie.  Every moment feels genuine and is infused with warmth.  Maybe it's the scenery.  Maybe it's the personalities of the cute but never cutesy child actors.  I don't know, I just know I enjoyed every moment.  And the dance sequence for the closing credits was dead solid perfect.  If you can understand dialog delivered in New Zealand accents (watch an episode of Flight of the Conchords to test yourself if necessary) and you want to watch a movie about innocence and hope and joy and what it means to grow up, and you want it to have some of the gritty resonance of ""Once Were Warriors"" or ""Whale Rider,"" but with a lot more sweetness, you should definitely see this film.",1384128000,2,1093,4.597938144329897

In a very good way it shows that the boy is more realistic and grown up than the father.",1382054400,,143,3.9655172413793105

8580057,1,B00CBVWXCO,"I have no idea why this movie gets 4 stars. I watch a lot of movies and a lot of foreign movies, but this has to be one of the worse movies I've ever seen. I can't think of anything good about it. I would give it zero stars if I could. Very boring, hard to understand, but even if I could have understood it better, it was still horrible. Don't waste your time.",1529107200,,361,3.891891891891892
8580058,5,B00CBVWXCO,"""Boy"" may not be the greatest film ever made technically (""In Bruges"" Is, by a mile I think), but it may be the most enjoyable.  I absolutely loved it.  The film itself is just so real and such a vivid, sensitive, compassionate look into the hard, ugly, beautiful world of the Maori of New Zealand, which is also an homage to Michael Jackson (!) and the best coming of age film of all time from anywhere.  But the best is yet to come.  You may recall the Maori war dance?  If not Google it.  A Michael Jacksonesque Bollywood Maori war dance?  Yup.",1529020800,,547,4.303921568627451
