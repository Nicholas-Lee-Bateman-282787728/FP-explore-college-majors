8654517,5,B00JXNBX4C,"Saint Ignatius of Loyola gets classic cinematic treatment in this black and white Spanish film from the 1940s. It's not perfect, but this film is one of only two feature-length movies (alongside the 2017 English-language ""Ignatius of Loyola"" biopic) of the life of the Spanish soldier who founded the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) to which Pope Francis belongs. Those familiar with the story of Ignatius, who found God after being wounded by cannon fire in a battle at Pamplona, will be pleased to see the main outline of his autobiography covered here. The film is by turns romantic, ascetic, devout, heartrending, and mystical as it depicts the man's conversion from soldier of fortune to a soldier of God. The brief battle scene is done well and a haunting English hymn version of the saint's ""Suscipe"" prayer (Take, Lord, and receive....) is used to good effect in key spiritual moments. Although the film does not provide a comprehensive biography of St. Ignatius, it covers more of his life than the newer film, and it captures his spirit and the Spanish flavor of his religious fervor quite well.

The DVD includes two versions of the film: One is the Spanish-language production without subtitles (a disappointment for those of us who'd like to see the original with English translation) and the other is an English-dubbed version released to American theaters. The English version includes a framing device with a Jesuit professor from Fordham University introducing the life of Ignatius to a then-modern room of students. Despite being a potential distraction, the English dubbing is actually better than what many international films pass off nowadays, and it kinds of grows on you after awhile. Lip movements and voices generally suit the characters. This film occasionally appears on EWTN, a Catholic cable network, around the feast of St. Ignatius on July 31 each year. I recommend it for all alumni of Jesuit schools and all men of goodwill, particularly those who want to understand the roots of Pope Francis's spirituality a little better.",1428451200,4,2053,5.07396449704142
