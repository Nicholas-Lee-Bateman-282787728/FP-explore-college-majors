7804192,5,6300154238,"We had this video many years ago and lost it, so I ordered it for my 19 year old daughter to remind her of all the times she used to spend watching it over and over. It's an enchanting tale that we all loved.",1225756800,,208,3.75
7804193,5,6300154238,"My brother loaned us his copy of this video.  He had to twist my arm to get me to take it as it didn't seem like our boy would like it, or was old enough, or...whatever.  I wasn't expecting much.  Well, after about 30 watchings, I must say that it is still enjoyable!  And our 2 1/2 year old son hasn't stopped requesting to see it again.  There are 3 animated stories on the video.  The first is the longest and the best, ""Rupert and the Frog Song.""  There are 2 more ""stories"" (the last 2 are closer to animated music videos), and they're enjoyable, but not in the same league as Rupert.  The music on the first is a tribute to the Hollywood swim-ballet movies of the 30's & Grand Opera--composed by Paul McCartney.  The second is a sort of Reggae song done by Paul & Linda McCartney & Wings.  The third is a classic rock song with a wonderful guitar solo by Paul.  The animation is imaginative and detailed.  This video is well worth the investment!",1027641600,2,952,4.286516853932584
