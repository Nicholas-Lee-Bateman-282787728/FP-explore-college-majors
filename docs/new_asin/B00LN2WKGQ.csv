6492492,5,B00LN2WKGQ,Really great movie. It was one of the better Monster High movies and it was defientely worth it. Girl power and equality and diversity is pushed with this movie in a unique and wonderful way.,1411603200,11,191,4.485714285714286

6492494,5,B00LN2WKGQ,"This is definitely one of the more fun and cute Monster High movies so far.  As someone who wasn't a big fan of the Frights, Camera, Action movie; I was pleasantly surprised at how enjoyable this movie was to watch.  The character interaction is hilarious, and the fused ghouls were a delight.  Ghoulia was particularly a highlight when killing time in the catacombs.  Overall, Monster High movies work best when they have a good variety of personality types all dealing with a problem together.  Having the fused ghouls made for even more clashing personalities to interact with each other and made for a fun ride.",1411171200,11,615,4.819047619047619

6492502,5,B00LN2WKGQ,"This movie was surprisingly great. I wasn't planning on liking it since the freaky fusion dolls kind of bug me. But it's a GREAT movie! And the message is even better. It includes a whole host of Monster High characters, and really highlights their personalities. This movie teaches us about who Frankie's grandfather is (Victor Frankenstein), and we learn about Robecca Steam's dad (Hexiciah Steam) and his great importance to Monster High School. It is a really interesting movie, and it also explains the dual hybrids like Nathan Rot, Avia Trotter, Bonita Femur, and more. My daughter's favorite character is Sirena Von Boo, although she plays a minor role. The ghouls learn about accepting each other's differences (which is already a main theme for Monster High). I really liked this movie. I wish we would have purchased it instead of renting it. It will make the christmas gift list, for certain.",1474588800,,903,4.986754966887418

6492543,1,B00LN2WKGQ,"I know this Monster High movie is a ""classic"" . . . but come on! This is one horrible Monster High movie for this day and age. I'm refusing to let my Sister watch this anymore!
#1- that mean, horrible Cleolei picking on Toralei . . . because of a deformity (?sp)! Would you do that to someone you first meet who may have something wrong with him. And to snub Cleo ...!...
#2- there is no way on this earth that they would let Draculaura fly! Let along grab on it and fly away! Of course Rebecca could only fly. . . WOULDN'T YOU if it was your child!
#3- Lagoonafire setting the water on fire! How dare she! And for so long!
#4- Showing the monster plant Clawvenus made! Come on! Do you really want your child to ask you about that?
#5- That rude, Obnoxious (?sp) Robot!
#6- Letting sirena von boo be the new ghoul in this Movie. I want her to appear on Haunted First! Shameful!
Monster High movies are to show our girls a fun time about sorta real life things to our creatures! This is one movie that Monster High should be ashamed of!
I can't believe all the other reviewers gave it 5 stars, just cause it's an old movie from last year.
WAKE UP! Don't buy this movie . . . and DO NOT let your kids watch it!
If I could give it negative stars, I would! It doesn't even deserve 1 star, but you have to put something.",1433289600,,1315,4.081081081081081

As part of the celebration of Monster High's Bitecentennial, the students are being asked to do reports on their scaritage, but Frankie Stein, whose parents/creators refuse to speak of him, knows absolutely nothing about her father's creator, her grandfather, and former MH student Victor Frankenstein.  Naturally her friends offer to help her with her research, particularly Robecca Steam, whose father/creator Hezekiah Steam was Victor's MH professor.  They set off in search of Professor Steam's lost lab somewhere in the catacombs, but thanks to the curiosity of Toralei, they accidentally activate a time machine, sending most of them back 200 years to the school's founding.  After dangerously interacting with several people in the past, our heroines return to the present only to find that several pairs of them have been fused together into single bodies.  While Ghoulia works on fixing the time portal, the fused monsters turn for guidance to the recently transferred in hybrid monsters, who know a thing or two about managing mixed monster types and mixed powers, before they wreck the Bitecentennial Play with their clumsiness.  What they fail to realize is that they've been followed through the time portal by someone who doesn't really know what he is doing,...

but insists on doing it anyway.

There is a lot going on in this story; it might be the most ethically complex of them all what with all the arguing about what is needed in order to create life.  Gently Pushed Moral: MH came out against their version of racism as early as the second TV special, but in this story they specifically come out against racism against those of mixed race or monster type.

6492704,5,B00LN2WKGQ,Two Monster Thumbs up.  Like Ghouls Rule had Cleo's dad in it I really like having Frankie's human grandpa and Robecca Steam human father in this film.  Just was I was brought to tears when Optimus Prime died in his battle with Megatron in 1985 Transformer Movie or when Sailor moon used her life force in Sailor moon R movie to stop asteroid heading for EArth I was also brought to tears when Frankie gave up her spark battling Sparky's monster to save her friends.  The story Frankie not knowing her family history get help from her monster high friends who trip back in time to 1814  which results in some of the monsters to be fused together when returning to 2014.  Unfortunately Sparking wanting to know Frankie's secret to being alive followed and caused more havoc in the present than in the past.,1412035200,5,805,4.5625
