Both she and David Niven did a fine job of acting, both actors in different roles than I usually see them in, proving they are for real actors. David Niven has played lots of types of characters but some people think of Leslie Caron as only Gigi, but she's a great actress, as well as being just gorgeous. Pretty good movie about being caught in the middle of a banana republic revolution. This movie is a lesson on why you better stay home, instead of trying to save some money by living in a cheaper but less secure country. Your success is good as long as the current dictator is in power, but you could lose everything overnight.",1467590400,,808,4.322368421052632
