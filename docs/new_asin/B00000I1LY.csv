8212050,4,B00000I1LY,"This a late fifties/early sixties telecast of a Judy Garland special with guests Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin.  Apparently the distributors felt they could sell more copies by billing it as some sort of quintessential Sinatra performance.  Disingenuous, manipulative, exploitive.  (Delta is a low-budget, ""careless"" label always requiring the consumer to be cautious.)

The colors are washed out (apparently a tinted B&W telecast), and the resolution is fuzzy and somewhat ""cartoonish,"" betraying the origins of the source as an early telecast.  Thankfully, the audio, for the most part, is kind to the performers' voices.  Judy obviously tried some binge dieting before the special and came up a bit short.

It's welcome music by all three, even if Sinatra's total time is about ten minutes!  Admittedly, it's always a kick to see Garland, but I'd rather see reruns of Judy's black & white weekly show and the television specials for which Sinatra did, in fact, receive top billing.  The price was nice, but the postage and handling fee produced mild sticker shock and resentment.",1199836800,,1082,5.208092485549133
8212051,1,B00000I1LY,"What a disappointment!  This DVD is a double feature.  While the first section is entertaining, showing some good music from Judy and Frank, with a little humor thrown in from Dean, it is the colorization that is poor.  The really bad part is the second section.  An extremely poor attempt at videomanship!!  It plays like a bad lip sync gone worse.  Et al....don't buy this DVD.",1009324800,,379,4.666666666666667
8212052,3,B00000I1LY,"The special featuring Frank, July & Dean is excellent. All are in good voice & apparently having a lot of fun while performing. If this were the entire dvd content I would rate it at 5. However, the supposed biography included is boring & pedestrian.",1006819200,,250,4.5777777777777775
8212053,1,B00000I1LY,"The DVD is in two parts, both of them misleading.  The ""legendary concert with Judy Garland, Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin"" is actually just one of the Judy Garland Show episodes.  It's fuzzy, with poor color, and looks like a VHS tape recording.  The songs are ok, but this is not a concert, and certainly not legendary!  The second part, ""The Man and His Music"" has a interface IN JAPANESE (not English).  If you don't know Japanese, you have to try several combinations just to play the movie.  Now come on, when the DVD cover is in English, why do this to the consumer?!! Then, when you finally find the right combination to play the movie, you get the worst color of any video that you've seen.  The basic hue is green, which is how you feel after you paid good money to buy the DVD.  Also audio in no way relates to what is shown on the video!!  Songs are played, and you keep thinking that the sound is out of sync ... but it isn't!!  The producers of this ""tribute"" put any video clip that they could find, then ran them willy-nilly as the audio clatters on about something else!!  The Disc jacket mentions that ""Delta Entertainment is not affiliated with Frank Sinatra, or any of his related companies.""  No wonder!  DO NOT BUY THIS DVD, and beware of anything from Delta Entertainment!",990230400,17,1295,4.459574468085107
8212054,1,B00000I1LY,"This is the worst thing I have ever viewed.  The DVD is split into 2 segments.  The first, is a ""COLORIZED"" Judy Garland episode of poor quality.  The second, is a lousy attempt at a documentary.  The video quality is poor.  It looks like the footage was taken from bad VHS copies of Sinatra in concert.  The still photos are all washed out or they are green or red. The editing was worse than a high school student project.  Don't waste your money. Not to mention the cheap home computer graphics and amateur narration.",988848000,9,520,4.468085106382978
8212055,1,B00000I1LY,"Sinatra fans don't be tempted by the cheap price. This DVD should have never been mastered. The ""Documentary"" with poor footage, lousy photos, very few snipits of music, none of which is in sync with the random pictures we see, make this the disaster of all times. The editor should hang his head in shame !",985564800,7,307,4.5
8212056,5,B00000I1LY,"This great program, although packaged to appeal to Sinatra fans, is Judy Garland's show; Sinatra and Dean Martin guest star.  Garland and Sinatra fans alike should snap this one up.
The colorizing didn't bother me at all the first time I saw it; it only became more noticeable with subsequent viewings.  You can always turn your color off if it bothers you.  One might wish for a more authentic representation of this special, with its original titles and even commercials in tact, but this is nontheless a thrilling program, with Judy in great form, still on the heels of her Carnegie Hall appearance, expertly directed by Norman Jewison.  The centerpiece of the program is Garland's performance of THE MAN THAT GOT AWAY, and many Judy fans consider this her greatest filmed performance of the song.
Sinatra's performance is solid, as is Dean Martin's, and their fan's won't be disappointed.
I give it 5 stars in spite of the flaws in the packaging and the half-hearted attempt at a documentary on Sinatra.  That's how great this program is.",969494400,3,1042,4.864406779661017
