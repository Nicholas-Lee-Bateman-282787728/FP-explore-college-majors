2714212,1,B000LV6VYM,"I was so anxious for this this roast to be released. Yeh, it's a blast to see Shatner talking trash and getting trashed.  But that 1 minute little piece of film with Nimoy and Shatner that opened the show IS NOT THERE !!!!!!!!!!

WHY THE &*%$# NOT?

That one single minute is a brilliant little bit of comedy, brilliantly executed by two people who have been known for their love/hate relationship, and absolutely worth the price of admission. I would buy a DVD of that bit alone. I am sorely dissapointed.",1174435200,30,506,4.538461538461538
2714213,3,B000LV6VYM,"William Shatner is known for over-acting, and he's put on some pounds since his appearance as a crew member on that one show in space. That pretty much captures the jibes on Capt. Kirk by comedians and comediennes in this sometimes-funny, but not-groundbreaking extension of Comedy Central's welcome resurrection of classic celebrity abuse.

Acting and weight. The rest of the jibes are aimed at other on-stage ""luminaries,"" fellow comedians or celebrities: Jason Alexander hosts; Andy Dick, Greg Giraldo, Lisa Lampanelli, Artie Lange, Patton Oswalt and Jeffrey Ross hold down the stand-up comic end; Nichelle Nichols and George Takei (""Star Trek's"" Uhura and Sulu, respectively) appear sans Leonard Nimoy; and Bette White and Farrah Fawcett appear to ... take up space and endure jokes about age and drug use. Kevin Pollak does a bit on his Shatner impersonation that made its way into Shatner's autobiography a few years ago. Fred Willard does a bit that get cuts short, even in this extended DVD.

The entire proceeding is fairly funny. The recently out-of-the-closet Takei knocks it out of the park with lots of gay jokes. Andy Dick rocks the podium in ""Star Trek"" regalia and Vulcan ears to put his own spin on the long-lived genre of Internet porn that captures a love between Kirk and his science officer, Spock. I'm also happy that the previously recorded bits from Sandra Bullock, Ben Stiller, and Sarah Silverman with Jimmy Kimmel were funny. I usually fear those call-in shout-outs.

Comedy Central's roasts are funnier because they're raunchier and more cutting than the classics that Rat Packers endured decades ago. But those classic roasts were also a little better because the people who showed up really knew the celebrities. Here, Alexander says Shatner doesn't know any of the comedians personally, and that's clear. They spend at least half their time dishing out on the others there. There's plenty to rip on - his lousy music work, his choice of roles, etc. But they steer clear and mostly focus on his over-acting (which he's now comfortable to acknowledge) and his weight (he clearly doesn't care).

This is worth a watch for ""Star Trek"" fans and those who like watching comedians rip each other.

DVD Extras: Behind-the-scenes footage, red carpet interviews, and a featurette are all uniformly short and uninteresting. It would have been nice to get some more stuff, like full versions of the ""Rocket Man"" video, maybe a video with Ben Folds from his latest album, etc.",1174176000,3,2494,5.043689320388349
2714214,5,B000LV6VYM,"I use to love the old Dean Martin Celebrity roasts. The pokes at the person roasted were well aimed. Comedy Central has taken over the tradition, they have only done a few..however their previous subjects (Jeff Foxwothy, Pam Anderson) have been quite at home with their Roasting

Eighty minutes is too short for a roasting for William Shatner. The former Captain Kirk/T.J. Hooker/Priceline dot com Diva is right at home being roasted.

This so called tribute starts with  a taped message from his former co-star Leonard Nimoy who in his spockian way said ""A Roast, why are you doing it>? Is it for the food?' Pointing out that Shatner has put on a few pounds since his Trek days

And that gets the ball rolling uphill as most of Shatner media career from Trek to Priceline, from Boston Legal's Denny Crane to his singing styles are poked and slammed dunked home

Shatner takes this spirited roast in great form, seeming to crave more and more roasting from many people as the audience (YOU) will want more too.

AS in Free Enterprise (see my review), Shatner pokes fun at himself..Now in other hands, Shatner just sits back and laughes and so will you

So Beam aboard for the laughes

2714215,4,B000LV6VYM,"Just so you know, there are several JOKE SPOILERS here.

I saw this uproarious roast of William Shatner several times when Comedy Central aired and re-aired it last August. After the wickedly funny Comedy Central verbal drubbing of Pamela Anderson last year (2005), I was wondering who they were gonna put next in the chair of humiliation. Well, it turned out to be Captain James Tiberius Kirk himself. I thought the idea of the iconic and self-mocking William Shatner was a brilliant follow-up and a chance for the roasters to really outdo themselves. Now, I haven't seen this uncensored version yet (there was a Shatner roast pay-per-view, but I wasn't about to put out the chump change for it), so I'm basing these comments on the edited television release by Comedy Central, not on the forthcoming dvd. Being a completist kind of fella, odds are I'll amend this ""review"" as soon as I get the actual dvd in my paws. But, for now...

William Shatner must be blessed with towering self-esteem, along with a very keen sense of humor, to have withstood all the verbal onslaught and still come out intact and laughing; the roasters absolutely took no pity on him, and, yet, there Shatner was, chortling and seemingly having the time of his life. George Takei and Nichelle Nichols represent the original Star Trek cast in person, while Leonard Nimoy opens the festivities with a video clip conversation with Shatner, even managing to get a dig in as he tries to talk his former shipmate out of doing the roast (""Why are you doing this? Is it for the food?""). Takei, by the way, comes in as a well-humored and thick-skinned dude and, for his own part, gleefully aims several well-honed, gut-busting zingers at his fellow roasters (poor Farrah Fawcett); having just come out of the closet in October 2005, in Frontiers magazine, he actually takes almost as many shots as Shatner. However - and this just may be me being influenced by all the rumors of the animosity which Shatner's Star Trek co-actors held for him - I did sense a certain tension between Shatner and Takei (and, no, it's not sexual tension), when one was speaking of the other, and vice versa. And where was Walter Koenig? He's still alive, ain't he?

Actor/comedian/Cap'n Kirk-impersonator extraordinaire Kevin Pollak, the porcine and potty-mouthed Lisa Lampanelli, Greg Giraldo (""You overact more than Betty White's bladder"") and perennial roaster Jeffrey Ross (""Look at you, Shatner...you have let yourself boldly go"") perform their comedy shticks from the dais and generally made me laugh, while filmed ""tributes"" by Sandra Bullock, Ben Stiller, and the duo of Jimmy Kimmel and the fearless Sarah Silverman are hits or misses. I was actually knocked for a loop when Betty White proved to be as raunchy and funny as she did (""It always makes me laugh when I see Artie Lange on stage - knowing I'm going to outlive him""; and did Betty and Shatner really do the nasty? Aarrgh!). Lastly, it's always a pleasant surprise when the roastee is able to give as good as he's got, and, make no mistake, Shatner hilariously tore a hole into his tormentors. Kudos to Cap'n Crunch...er, Kirk.

Now, the negatives: Roastmaster Jason Alexander does try his darndest, but he ends up being merely adequate in his hosting duties. The ever annoying Andy Dick yet again demonstrates that he is neither clever nor funny (this numbnut wastes television air time by mugging for the camera, being weird, and licking faces). And then there's Farrah Fawcett, who was on some odd kind of drugged-up or drunk bender when she horrifically attempted to perform her ""bit."" Her time on the screen was abysmally embarassing and so excruciating I had to turn the channel and only returned when I thought she had finished. Again, poor Farrah.

The only aspect of Shatner's multi-media career that wasn't brought up and gutted was his stint as a sci-fi author. Nothing else was too sacred or too personal for the irreverent roasters as they avidly demolish just about every fixture in the William Shatner mythos: the hammy acting, the weight, T.J. Hooker, Boston Legal, the toupee, [...], the spoken song career, and, of course, Captain Kirk. As I've mentioned, I've only seen the televised roast on Comedy Central and, honestly, I had a rollicking, laugh-out-loud good time. William Shatner is an overwhelmingly easy target, a fount of low brow insults, and, while I thought the jokes were fairly obvious, they were still so ferociously funny, in spite of their viciousness (or maybe because of their viciousness?). Undoubtedly, the uncensored version is even more hilarious and vulgar and, hopefully, comes equipped with quality bonus features. And, finally, for the last time, that poor Farrah Fawcett...

*********************************************************************

Update: So I just watched the extended & uncensored dvd of this roast, and, as predicted, it was even more of a blast than the cleaned up show that aired on Comedy Central months ago. Surprisingly, Roastmaster Jason Alexander showed real improvement when not bleeped or edited. He was actually pretty funny. And, as expected, roast hangers-on Greg Giraldo, Patton Oswalt, Jeffrey Ross, and (especially) Lisa Lampanelli shine best when unleashed uncut in their full vulgarity. Betty White was awesome, as was George Takei, while Andy Dick remained intolerable. Fred Willard and Nichelle Nichol's moments on the podium weren't shown in full, but, sadly, Farrah Fawcett's weird ""episode"" was, in its full excruciating glory. I also noticed that the video clip with Leonard Nimoy which opened the aired show was absent in this dvd. Hmmm...

The bonus features weren't all that: a brief ""Making of the Roast"" segment, ""Red Carpet Interviews,"" ""Behind the Scenes Footage,"" and 3 Comedy Central quickies (short segments from the Colbert Report, Reno 911, and Drawn Together). The one to check out is the ""Red Carpet Interviews,"" where you get to see the cute, bespectacled interviewer (her name's Jessie something) start out sober as she talks to the roasters before the show; then, the camera cuts to after the roast and to a drunk off her mind Jessie, who's still interviewing!

When I heard that Comedy Central was going to have a Celebrity Roast of him I just knew it would be a comedic explosion and thats exactly what it was! Words can not describe how funny the insane insults were and knowing William Shatner, you can only imagine how crazy it got. It got so crazy that it almost seemed like they were roasting George Takei who was on the roasting pannel who played ""solo"" on Star Trek because of his recently ""coming out of the closet"" and saying he was gay.

2714244,3,B000LV6VYM,"William Shatner might have spoken the only line of truth during the roast when it was finally his turn to get up and take his own shots at the line of ""comedians"" and co-stars who gathered together to hurl insults at the legendary William Tiberius Shatner!  Because, in truth, most of them weren't very funny.  In fact, I felt that only four people were funny: Betty White, George Takei, Kevin Pollack, and William Shatner himself (who was arguably the best!).

Perhaps it takes a certain level of sophistication to refrain from constant sexual innuendo and profanity as the majority of the comedians used.  What probably made them even more inept with their jokes is that they were actually reading them from notes!  They might as well have brought a joke book to read from.  It's truly pathetic when a so-called comedian has to use notes.  However, Farrah Fawcett was so bad, she actually could have used a note or two as she could hardly speak.

I take you back to the classic Dean Martin Roasts.  Personally I found those to be absolutely hilarious with two major differences from the Shatner roast: no profanity, and no notes!  I personally do not mind some profanity, but used constantly, it begins to lose its punch, and thus the humor is somehow diminished.  You'll note that Shatner himself only used a couple of swear words, Betty White used none, Pollack used a couple, and George Takei used a couple (one used the best of all at the end of his reign at the podium!).  The rest of the panel hurled one profane word after another, and each using notes.  Some of them started out being funny but quickly dropped off.  One couldn't help but say during this barrage, ""Are they using the same joke?  I could swear that I just heard that one or something similar.""

Bill Cosby may have said it best, ""A good comedian finds that he doesn't need to rely on profanity to be funny.""  A good comedian also knows how to use such words to make the most impact.

This is definitely a must-see for any fan of William Shatner, but rent it, don't buy it.  You will probably find that one time through is more than enough.",1206316800,3,2115,4.5476190476190474

Betty White gamely plays along with the locker room humor. Watch the extras on this DVD and you'll learn that she didn't go as far as she was asked to. In a similar vein, the legendary Fred Willard takes a stab at four-letter funnies and seems a little out of place. Maybe that's why he got a couple of lines instead of a full segment. Ben Stiller appears in a pretty funny taped segment about what happened when, as a kid, he respectfully requested an autograph from ""Captain Kirk.""

The single greatest mistake at this event was asking her to participate. Andy Dick isn't funny, and while he provides a convenient target for many of the comedians, he's just...not...funny. Jason Alexander is an ""OK"" host...some of his delivery is really forced (but his David Spade joke hit the bulls-eye). Kevin Pollak doesn't add anything to the proceedings and Patton Oswalt looks like he'd really like to be one of the gang but his heart's just not in it. There's no shortage of racial humor directed toward Nichelle Nichols, who shrugs it off for the most part. The roasts were built on the premise that everyone's a target, everyone's fair game, but in these days of excruciatingly ""correct"" behavior, that premise may not be appreciated by all who watch. An audience reaction shot of Reno 911's Cedric Yarbrough after one of the Nichols jokes illustrates that point. Shatner's closing ""rebuttal"" to the roasters is funny enough, but with Shatner, he IS the joke...and yes, he ""gets it""...the clips of his TV appearances and excursions into song are priceless. 50% killer stuff, 50% groaners and jokes that miss the target...about par for any celebrity roast. But...BECAUSE we're talking...about William SHATNER, you...MUST...buy it...NOW. The disc holds up to repeated viewings but unless you have it on for background noise, you WILL fast-forward through some segments. A three-star effort that gets its fourth star entirely because of Lisa Lampanelli...she's one funny lady.",1179014400,,2629,5.018306636155606
2714251,5,B000LV6VYM,"This is by far, the best of the best.  Easily the funniest roast that Comedy Central has done so far.  Do not miss this one!!!",1178668800,,126,4.0
2714252,3,B000LV6VYM,"Comedy Central has had a blast producing frequent Roasts over the past few years (Denis Leary, Jeff Foxworthy, Pam Anderson), and the Roast of William Shatner is no different. Gleefully shameless for it's running time, the Roast of William Shatner features 'ol Captain Kirk himself being a good sport in the heat of being verbally insulted by such comedians like Lisa Lampinelli, Patton Oswalt, Artie Lange, and Jeffrey Ross (as well as video remarks from Ben Stiller, Sandra Bullock, Jimmy Kimmel, and Sarah Silverman); but this Roast isn't without it's flaws. For starters, it would have been nice to see some more Star Trek personalities here besides George Takei and Nichelle Nichols, and speaking of Takei (who had just come out of the closet prior to the Roast being filmed), he ends up taking more needless insults than Shatner does a number of times. Not to mention that the inclusion of some of the guests here (namely Farrah Fawcett and the always annoying Andy Dick) is mind-boggling. There are some funny moments though that outweigh the bad, like a look back at Shatner's post-Trek career, which is just too funny in itself, and Jason Alexander makes a good host as well, and Shatner's concluding strike back comments are worth the price of admission alone. All in all, if you enjoyed any of the previous Comedy Central Roasts, chances are you'll dig seeing Captain Kirk get what he deserves.",1177804800,7,1405,4.907563025210084
2714253,1,B000LV6VYM,"I can't remember the last time I was so disappointed by a ""celebrity event.""  I used to say, ""Heck, I'd watch William Shatner read the phone book,"" and now I'm sure that would have been a better use of time (his AND mine.)  Full five stars to Leonard Nimoy for not participating in this crude, cruel, and contemptible exercise.  There were a couple of very funny moments, as when one of the pack of ""comedians"" did a spoof on having to have a speech coach ...  for years  ...  and years ...  to correct ,,, his tendency  ... to speak as Shatner did and still probably does in Boston Legal.  My advice:  go watch old Star Trek, old TJ Hooker, new Boston Legal -- anything but this nasty bit of trash. Can only hope he got paid well for participating.",1176336000,9,749,4.285714285714286
2714254,5,B000LV6VYM,"one of the funniest comedy specials i've ever seen. if you are easily offended, don't buy this. if on the other hand, a good dirty joke brightens your day.....ENJOY!!!",1176163200,2,167,4.793103448275862
2714255,3,B000LV6VYM,"I agree with many reviewers about the crudeness. Most of the humor is not that funny, just shockingly rude. And I have to admit that making so many harsh gay (not that there's anything wrong with that) jokes about George Takei (Sulu) wasn't that funny either. Just crude.

Don't get me wrong, I am opposed to being politically correct. I can crack a lot of harsh jokes (jokes mind you) about race, religion and sexual preference. But I simply got bored with all the rude Gay Jokes. George seemed to like the jokes or the attention.

However, to me this roast was worth it to see Clint Howard reprise his role as Balok (is that how you spell it??) from the episode THE CORBOMITE MANEUVER from the first season of the original series of star trek. This had me on the floor and wanting to tell all my trek friends about it. I am buying it just for the Tranya.",1175472000,11,856,4.34375
2714256,1,B000LV6VYM,"Okay, I'm a fan of roasts.  At least I was back when funny people were doing the roasting.  And I'm a fan of Shatner.  At least I was back in the day when I was a 12 year old Star Trek fan.  I looked forward to this video...it seemed like a slam dunk purchase.

But this isn't funny.  It's a conglomeration of nastiness and schoolyard ""humor,"" which might only be funny to young teens, and only because they're looking for a way to rebel.  Gay jokes?  Stupid gay jokes besides?  Is this what American humor has become?  I am not a prude (my favorite comedian is Bill Hicks, ferchrisakes...no Pat Boone, he) but this was not funny, mostly, but simply crude.  The part I most appreciated was when one of the couple of roasters with any wit about them turned to the other comedians and said ""pee-pee ka-ka jokes: very funny stuff, guys.""

The worst part about this is that now I sound like one of those old geezers:  ""Back in my day, we knew what comedy was!""

Shatner, it must be said, is a pretty easy target.  But most of the humor in this DVD misses that target.  It is lame and juvenile and embarrassing.",1174694400,13,1106,4.296116504854369
8164273,4,B000LV6VYM,"This was a Christmas gift and I watched it last night and I have to admit I was laughing so hard at so many moments.  Of course as many reviewers pointed out tons of crude humor and racy jokes, but like Shatner said he gave them lots to work with because of the show business life he has lead.  I recognize lot of the roasters because of TV or Movies that I heard of or watched,  but I also sad watching Farrah attempt to do her bit on the roast like watching Courtney Love during the roast of Pam Anderson.  But unlike people who gave it bad reviews and one star or two star ratings I gave it a four star rating because most of the jokes made me laugh nearly cried on a few of them, which one of the best lines was the comment about Shatner entrance on a horse and then the camera went to Andy Dick and Lisa Lamp however spell her last name nearly made me fall over.  In closing still a pretty decent roast and very laughable material, but added a star because of the bonus material is a great add on.",1514332800,,1002,4.040404040404041
