7666400,5,B01BSW1OQ2,"This is gritty stuff. Which makes me love it.

It covers ultra low-budget horror films, and the people who make them. And there's a lot of charm in all this. You get the idea that the people who make these movies love what they do. And the footage from there films has some real over-the-top gore. So if you're a gore hound, you'll probably appreciate that part. But some of it is fun and funny too. So some of these filmmakers do pretty dark and disturbing work. While others do more horror camp. You get to see a little bit of everything.

It's not as slick as a lot of documentaries. But that's okay. It's going for more of a grindhouse feel. Which matches the mood of the movies featured. And the hostess Bianca Allaine adds a glam touch as the horror hostess who introduces it.

So I give a lot of credit to Johnny Daggers for putting something like this together.

One extra note: it's pretty long, so don't feel like you have to watch it all at once. You can go back to it and pretty much pick up anywhere you left off. And re-watch your favorite scenes and interviews. You do get more out of it on repeated viewings.",1465257600,5,1124,4.287735849056604

My favorite message I've taken away from this film: Be who you are and do what you love to do. If the things you want to be doing don't exist where you are, make it exist where you are. You can tell Johnny Daggers put a lot of heart into this film. Blood on the Reel is worth a watch for anyone into documentaries and horror.",1465689600,,575,4.236363636363636

7666417,5,B01BSW1OQ2,"This film is one of the best of its kind. Let me tell you why.

First, this is what people in the film business go through to make their own film. Not for money but because it's what the love. When it says blood on the reel there is a great chance that actor or director probably cut themselves making sure a deadline was met on time.

Second, when you have someone that busts their humps as much as these people do you can't help but to watch it. This encompasses all of the dedication and passion entwined with behind the scenes and without any Hollywood glamour attached.

Lastly, this is raw and real. There's no fluffy material added in to help make the story true. Even if I know some of these people in this film personally, I'm still incredibly proud that this was made into a clear picture of what actually happens. The struggles. The victories. The hard work. The tears. I've seen some of the work in person that goes into something like this. You spend your own money and sometimes you don't eat. That's how dedicated and passionate you are about your own work.

Bottom line, this is a must watch for all filmmakers and upcoming people who want to do this. Especially in the horror genre.... This is real life for them and for the rest of us that get to appreciate the finished product.",1465344000,4,1297,4.391666666666667

What I love about this one is that it has a lot to say and shares commentary both serious and humorous, after all, in films you do have to laugh at yourself, and  Johnny Daggers does just that, too!

Clips from those films look like an inebriated monkey stole a tourist's video camera, okay?  It's really awful stuff, but these buffoons proudly revel in the opportunity to regale us with their oh-so-clever anecdotes. For example, Johnny Daggers says it never occurred to him that it might be illegal to trespass on nuclear power plant property and start filming the facilities... Yeah, they really are THAT stupid.",1518739200,,619,5.4375

8751200,5,B01BSW1OQ2,"Review-Indie horror is a very tricky subject. I always wonder if most people are aware of what indie horror truly is. Hollywood would tell you that  It Follows is an indie horror film. People believe that Fox Searchlight is an indie studio. No offense to that film or that studio, maybe at one time they both had indie roots but when you have a backer that can shove millions if needed into you, the word indie no longer applies. I think people today want to think that indie film is alive and well, but I feel in reality the death of the video store chain and stores that catered to selling movies only with no cosmetics or car part asiles sort of hurt indie films, like taking away the walking stick of a blind person.

 Blood on the Reel is a look inside indie film told thru the lens of Johnny Daggers. This 2 hour plus film talks to several indie directors about certain topics like horror magazines, their greatest achievement and working on an indie film like the problems or getting permits. The shock to me is when they talked about the death of magazines, that no one ever brought up the rise of the internet critic or websites, blogs and podcasts. If any platform ever kept the voice of indie horror alive, it was people like me. The true fans of indie horror, who do not give ratings based on what ads you are paying for. Who do not see their numbers dwindling and decide to host a indie horror month in an attempt to belittle the true sites. You would think that Daggers could take 20 minutes shaved off his agenda of putting him all over this disc and talk about the true heroes of this genre. While they do mention websites in passing, it was negative of course.  They say hateful things. I want to address this and the comment made early on about people who put out their first film and does not do a edit and think they hit gold.

I have reviewed so many first time filmmakers and gave them my review and showed them my gripes and arguments, the label agrees but the director does not. Instead of being an adult, they go online and say malicious things and cannot take that people hated their film. Some people who direct an indie film think they are the next  Blair Witch or  Paranormal Activity that their small idea is going to bloom into millions overnight. This film shows that some people get the real side of that.

James Balsamo of Acid Bath Productions comes across on this disc as comic relief which really gives this film such a balance. I have dealt with Balsamo in 2011 and 2012, dude is insane and I feel it is not an act, but he is a true voice for this genre and deserves to be heard. Mike OMahony is another one of those directors that I feel is insane, should be institutionalized for the things he puts on film, but he deserves so much more success than he gets. To hear him on this documentary, you just root for him. He is humorous in a very awkward way. Vito Trabucco is also interviewed and if you have not seen Bloody Bloody Bible Camp by now, you are truly not a horror fan. There were so many more than were interviewed and the interviews on here for the most part were very good.

Johnny Daggers though is where I have my issue. This film at times does feel like an infomercial for him. That the agenda behind this documentary was to get everyone talking about his film or curious as to all the self made hype he does in this film for his work. I am not saying he is a bad or good guy, I am just saying that the biggest negative people have with film is that hype gets laid on too thick. When you have the director being the one it just gets too much.

This film also opens up about pet peeves like a director to claim he is an award winning director. I would also like to keep this argument going and saying, I hate when actresses call themselves scream queens. It is like the Soska Sisters saying they are indie directors. You get paid by WWE to direct their vision, that is not an indie company. See, people feel the fans love a true underdog and will help them out, but this documentary shows you who that true underdog truly is.

I know this was put out by SGL as a way to get some of their titles over, but I feel this film would have been so more open if it would have had Ramage from Brain Damage Films, Wild Eye Releasing or Bill Zebub. Talk about someone who needed to be on here, no offense to anyone in this film but if you want to talk about someone who is tailor made for this film, Bill Zebub is. If you trim away 10 minutes of Johnny Daggers bragging about himself, this film would have been perfect. If you would have really been about true independence and put more labels like Troma and the ones mentioned above, it would have really been more for the indie fan than being more for the indie fan who loves Johnny Daggers.

If you are a first time director or thinking about jumping into this deep end, this dvd could be a great self help tool. It really talks about the negatives and how to avoid them or hide them up. To show what kind of dream world Daggers resides in, he wants people to think critics do not know anything because directors should not be blamed for the majority of issues with a film. That we should understand that people at times may not can complete a scene or idea because of this or that. So fans, Johnny Daggers wants you to love a film that does not deliver on its promise because that is not the directors fault. Johnny, whose fault is it then? So, If I go see Ghostbusters and they have no ghosts I should just be satisfied with what I got?

I do not agree with the bulk of what comes out of Daggers mouth, but the man put together a great documentary that I feel if you are a fan of indie horror, you should have in your library",1466899200,,5721,4.232813932172319
