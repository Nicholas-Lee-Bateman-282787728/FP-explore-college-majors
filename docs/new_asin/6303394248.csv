641868,4,6303394248,"Over the years, many child actors have had a go at martial arts films, most obviously Ralph Macchio in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Karate-Kid-movies/dp/B0006OBPTA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Karate Kid movies</a>, but few of them were both skilled and consistent enough to become genuine action heroes. Ted Jan Roberts filled that particular void better than any could have expected, and one of his best vehicles in doing so was undeniably 1995's ""A Dangerous Place."" A surprisingly dark and well-made action-thriller produced in B-movie form, I've no doubt that had this one been released less than a decade earlier and on a larger platform, it would've become a cult coming-of-age classic. As it is, it's a minor gem of karate filmmaking and a great showcase for Roberts.

The story: when his brother is killed after falling in with a gang of adolescent karate thugs, young Ethan (Roberts, ""Masked Rider"") takes it upon himself to avenge his murder by infiltrating the group and learning how he died.

The movie is unique for being the only R-rated feature from this stage of Roberts' career, and earns its rating not from profanity or violence but by the depth of its drama and subject matter. At times, it seems like the film could have gotten away with a PG-13 designation, but then it feels all the more surprising when it investigates the feelings of losing a young family member and the dangers of peer pressure with (for the most part) genuine integrity. The script by Sean Dash is nicely mature for a movie mostly starring adolescents, but is still peppered with idealism and at its core is a story about needing to decide whether to succumb to the positive or negative influences in our young lives. Admittedly, it's a bit harder to apply these particular life lessons than the ones Daniel LaRusso and Mr. Miyagi taught us, but it's nonetheless pleasing to see a movie with this much heart examining such an extreme scenario.

Acting his part pretty well, Roberts himself finally looks like a teenager after two previous vehicles wherein he still appeared inappropriately childlike. He's supported by no less of an 80s nostalgia icon than Corey Feldman (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stand-By-Me/dp/B00003CXIP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stand By Me</a>), as well as Marshall Teague (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Road-House/dp/B000FI8MPW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Road House</a>) and the sorely missed Mako (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Seven-Years-in-Tibet/dp/0767806239/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Seven Years in Tibet</a>) as respective evil and good senseis. Erin Grey (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dreams-Awake/dp/B006RUT21A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dreams Awake</a>) does a reasonably good job as the brothers' grieving mother, and Dean Cochran (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Air-Marshall/dp/B001OFM2UG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Air Marshall</a>) does well enough as Ethan's ill-fated brother.

What struck me as most surprising were the movie's action scenes. They're deceptively good, especially when you consider that it's a bunch of kids doing the fighting. Though they produced a ton of karate flicks, the quality of PM Entertainment's action content has been hit & miss, and it especially leaned towards the latter when Art Camacho (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Match/dp/6303236898/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Match</a>) acted as fight choreographer. Luckily, the debilitating camerawork and choppy editing I've grown so used to by now are all but absent from this film, allowing the impressive talent of the young performers to shine through fully. One look at his particularly good kicks and fluidity of movement makes it clear why Ted Jan Roberts was the star of so many action flicks, and he's supported well enough by his co-stars (including&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nick-Hill/dp/B00005MM61/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nick Hill</a>&nbsp;for a single match with Dean Cochran). The eleven fights are better than good, for the most part, and the two-part finale between Roberts and Corey Feldman is better than it has any right to be, considering that Feldman doesn't appear to be genuine martial artist.

There are a couple lapses in logic during the movie's less important scenes, and had it been produced with a larger budget to give the picture a crisper visual quality, this one would've hit five stars. As it is, it's still worth owning, and definitely a picture newcomers can use to introduce themselves to the main star. I haven't seen too many TJR films yet, but this movie makes me want to change that.",1360713600,2,4894,6.180616740088106
641869,5,6303394248,"Though it may seem a bit 'cheesy' at times, I actually did like this movie. It reminds me of the Karate Kid though more urban and darker. It had some good acting and a very good cast to say the least. I say it's worth a shot.",1347840000,,225,3.8085106382978724
641870,5,6303394248,I have been searching for the name of this movie for the last like 10 years and i finally found it! I saw it when I was like 7 and didn't knoow the name I am now 23 and have found it. One of the greatest martial arts movies ever!!! A MUST SEE!!!!,1314835200,3,246,3.660377358490566
641871,4,6303394248,"There is no doubt that TJ Roberts would never have been the next Ralph Macchio in the acting department, but that's not the reason to be watching this movie.

A Dangerous Place does offer up some very exciting action and a great opportunity to see Corey Feldman playing a cardboard cutout adult action movie baddie trapped in a teen boy's body. The story is good but predictable, the acting fair at best, but the martial arts talent of TJ is what clearly shines here. Some well cut together scenes and slow mo shots of young 13 year old TJ in action rival many other movies with adult actors, including the overrated Jet Li. TJ's style, grace, poise and overall positive energy plays off perfectly to Feldman's rigid, streetfighter type mode of martial arts. No wires or computer generated effects needed here, these guys DO the work, and its literally breathtaking to watch at times.

Bottom line here: If you want a truly heartwarming film about an underdog kid beating the odds and coming out on top, see the Karate Kid for the 300th time. TJ is no underdog, he has true black belt talent that shines through in every scene, in every way. If what you are looking for is a great martial arts movie with more of a storyline than many that stars someone with real talent in martial arts, not just movie magic simulated butt whippings, then A Dangerous Place is for you.",1134691200,4,1369,4.583673469387755
641872,5,6303394248,I am into Martial Arts movies and crazy about them. I really enjoyed this one not only martial arts but he got revenge on the people who killed his brother and you could not ask for a better movie to watch and the actor that was the main star of this movie I think this was the best movie that he played in and starred in thank you.,1130284800,3,332,3.8970588235294117
641873,4,6303394248,"I'm a very big Martial Arts crazy fan.  I love alot of them, hate alot of them.  But this one, is one of my favorite films.  Has a good climax and plot to it, and has some good fighting in it.  This is a good movie and T. J. Roberts is a good actor, to me would have been a awesome upcoming Martial Arts star.

Now, the 1st review on this movie is totally uncalled for.  This is a good movie, maybe even a great movie.  It is actually better than alot of HIGH class martial arts movies.  T. J. Roberts is a good martial arts star in this movie and all of is other 4 movies.  Wish he'd continued to make them, shame he didn't.  But I know he would have if he could have.  And I would so recommend watching the Magic Kid 1 & 2 along with The Power Within and Tiger Heart movies.  Tiger Heart is probably his best, I loved it.  So pay no attention to the 1st comment, which shouldn't have been posted because of rude comments and just plain down right mean.

But this movie is about a boy that took karate off his older brther.  Then his brother dies at high schoool, so its up to T. J. Roberts to find out what happened to him.  So he goes undercover I guess you'd say, and some fighting takes place.  Just a really good movie, great plot and climax to this movie.  Great story behind it.  Better than most.

So all in all, I would recommend watching this movie, and all of T. J. Robert's movies.  They are all good.  You won't forget them, tell you that much.",1118880000,3,1458,4.042105263157895
641874,1,6303394248,I cant believe that hollywood would release such joke of a film. It stars this little pint size dork who makes zoolander faces and thinks he is some karate master. That kid couldn't beat a fly on his best day. Total disaster but a good laugh if you want to see why hollywood hasn't cast a moron like this in another film since 1902. Someone needs to tell this kid to find another job.....,1100217600,,388,4.256756756756757

Quite frankly I think Corey Feldman did a great job acting the bully part. The choice for the high school principal was odd, but hey, it was the early 90s, so there you go. This movie is a lot better than the current junk for teens today.",1368662400,,398,4.102564102564102
