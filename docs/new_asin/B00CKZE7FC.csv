5724989,5,B00CKZE7FC,"I think this is a great movie that addresses Asperger's Syndrome, religion/GLTB issues, as well as the impact of losing someone very close. These are issues that many face daily.

The performance of BooBoo Stewart alone is worth the time to view it. Tyler Posey gives a great performance as well.",1374537600,8,296,4.803921568627451
5724990,1,B00CKZE7FC,"I cannot remember the last time I saw a movie this bad.  A weak script, poor dialogue and bad acting make for an unpleasant movie going experience.  At times I was actually squirming in my seat.  Joan Chen's performance was embarrassing.  As was BD Wong's.  If this movie had been a little worse, it would have been a good farce!

5724992,5,B00CKZE7FC,"Everything about this movie is great. The plot is beautifully constructed, the acting is excellent, the pacing is good, there is a powerful theme, and the story has lots of heart. Give it a few minutes to get going. The opening scenes set the stage for what follows and don't reveal the incredible impact the movie ends up delivering. And yes, the title is fitting but not in a way you're likely to guess. This is one of the few films I'll never forget. Very highly recommended.",1373846400,18,478,4.505747126436781

5724994,5,B00CKZE7FC,"I almost didn't rent this movie but I like boo boo Stewart so I decided to give it a try. I am so glad that I did. This was one of the best movies that I have watched in a long time. It breached many topics that are very delicate and even though the movie begins with a tragedy, it still ends on a very positive and happy note.",1372204800,11,327,3.753623188405797
5724995,4,B00CKZE7FC,"When I read a short synopsis of this movie, I was intrigued. Asperger's Syndrome has become more prevalent in recent years, and seeing it portrayed on film, particularly by someone who does not suffer from it, was quite fascinating and (in this case) well done.

I was actually surprised at how well a Twilight-saga-veteran could act; BooBoo Stewart is endearing as Nick, a young man with Asperger's dealing with the stress of both dealing with his brother (Chaz)'s death and discovering his brother's secret life. BD Wong plays the difficult but necessary role of the frustrated and grieving parent with a harsh believability, and the motley crew of Chaz's friends who take Nick in after their friend's death provide good drama and much needed comic relief. Harry Shum Jr., as Chaz himself, is stunning.

Overall, this is a strong, heartwarming film that dares to question the ideas of normal and perfect in today's society.",1371513600,18,925,5.0

But it did continue through the film after leaving it for a few minutes (& a bit if use of the remote). Finally I saw the movie I had seen the pre-release trailer for and it was as good as I expected.  Simply frustrated that the disc froze at the same point AND on different players for each disc!

5725008,2,B00CKZE7FC,"This movie is something. And by that I mean super heavy-handed. It has its heart in the right place, but basically nothing else is. I'm not sure what the indie genre's fascination is with rich, privileged people and their problems. This film is ethnically diverse. I'll give it that. It just lacks dramatic heft. It's trying too hard to speak about family, sexuality and mental disorder. It's got too much on its mind and none of the skill to pull it off. Everything comes off half-baked and forced. Some of the developments feel so abrupt and random that I simply had to laugh. There's some okay stuff in here that's marred by all the really bad stuff.",1412035200,2,653,4.589743589743589

5725011,5,B00CKZE7FC,"Stunning! I was just watching it for Booboo Stewart's portrayal of a teen with Asperger's syndrome, plus Manish Dayal from 'The Hundred-Foot Journey'. And then... the story arc bowled me over !! But the print quality of the DVD seems deficient compared to the digital version. All shadows in the outdoor scenes appear too dark! For day scenes, the shadowed side of the actors' faces or spots under trees were totally black! The night scenes were worse. For example at 15:15, I could hardly see the mother on the floor despite her wearing a white top. I had to adjust my TV's brightness almost to maximum just to watch this DVD.",1408579200,3,627,4.657657657657658

5725013,5,B00CKZE7FC,"I gave it a five star because it was just an amazing film! This film touched on so many subjects and it was amazing!

The storyline was very good and there were many surprises. I cried towards the end of the movie and I normally don't cry. I only cried in a Korean film I saw which was called Miracle in Cell no. 7 and Toy Story 3, I usually would feel a bit of a heartache when I watch sad films, but this had me crying.

This movie is great for the family because you learn a lot and I think the young audience would love it!",1403913600,5,527,3.8703703703703702
5725014,4,B00CKZE7FC,"This is very much an indie film in that it didn't have the highest budget. But, excellent story with excellent performances all round.

5725015,5,B00CKZE7FC,"Overall, it was a good movie.  Did not regret purchasing it.  If I were to be critical of the movie, the only problem I would have was some of the acting.  The boyfriend of Harry Shum's character, I wasn't too sure why he was very mean with Booboo Stewart's character.  The rich boy characterization was a little over the top but I was able to overcome it when he got around to trying to be a friend to BooBoo Stewart's character.  I would have liked them to have establish Kelly Hu's character more because the scenes she was in were a little off-putting.  I would have also probably had her button up her blouse just a little bit.  Otherwise, she's always awesome to see.",1398816000,,673,4.379032258064516

I loved it!!!",1397433600,3,110,4.55
5725017,4,B00CKZE7FC,This movie is really less about being gay and more about loss of a loved one. Pretty good film and the acting is quite good. I recognize some of these actors from various tv shows. Wish there were more scenes of interaction with the younger and older brother but I guess the story had to be structured the way it is.,1389744000,5,316,4.19672131147541

5725019,5,B00CKZE7FC,"For the first 30 minutes or so I was not sure why this was a gay movie. I won't reveal any of the plot but the second half will have you reaching for the tissues.  Some of the cast is from ""Teen Wolf"" and some from the ""Twilight"" movies. B.D. Wong plays a straight dad. Great acting and story and a hunky cast. Highly recommended.",1387670400,3,330,4.076923076923077
5725020,1,B00CKZE7FC,"Most of the other online reviews of White Frog seem to have been written by teenagers who have seen more TV than movies, so I'll try to give an adult perspective, in case any other adults are thinking about buying this movie.

First of all, except for two of the adults, I had never before seen or heard of any of the actors in this movie. So a statement like ""Booboo Stewart gives, by far, his best performance to date"" just leaves me puzzled. A person named Booboo has made movies before? Wow.

Others who rattle off other movies or TV shows these cast members have appeared in together, or refer to a ""handsome teen idol cast"" also leave me (and probably many other adults) clueless.

Second, I was not ever for even one second moved to tears while watching this movie. Not anywhere close. It is EXTREMELY sappy and manipulative - and painfully predictable. If you are eager to be swept up in shallow emotionalism - or are an adolescent who can't help it - then you may love this movie. It just made me want to pull my hair out.

Finally, if this really is Booboo's ""best performance to date"", he might want to consider a different career while he's still young enough to change easily. Only very young people who have seen very little of life and the world could be impressed by his performance in this movie. He looked down and mumbled all through the movie... and THAT is supposed to be a great performance? Only in an adolescent TV universe could that be true.

So I'd advise adults to look elsewhere and leave this movie to the kids, with their innocent enthusiasms and the rampant emotions that seethe just under the surface of their lives. It may be better than the TV they're used to, but as a movie it's not worth watching.",1387584000,3,1735,4.443396226415095
5725021,4,B00CKZE7FC,"I know this movie is not on most peoples radar. And if you have a problem with gay issues you don't even have to keep reading. But my 13 year old daughter and I watched this. It was such a poignant film. Not just because of the obvious issues, but of the hidden ones too. The actors/actresses that were cast were superb. My daughter and I had a fantastic conversation afterwards about Autism, gay issues, family dynamics, hiding one's true self, finding one's true self and so much more. I recommend this as a hidden gem!",1387497600,7,521,4.4375
5725022,3,B00CKZE7FC,A lot of expense and effort to make a plastic film with mostly poor acting and ridiculous costuming and makeup.  The only thing that gets 3 stars are the sugar candy leads.  One or two could actually act but were provided with synthetic dialogue and opera style amphitheater makeup for close-ups?  It's OK if you can see it for free but otherwise there many much more effective and enjoyable choices available.  PEACE!,1387238400,,418,4.763888888888889
5725023,5,B00CKZE7FC,"Unless you know what White Frog means, don't assume anything about what it means or what the movie is about.  In White Frog, the two major complementary themes that run parallel eventually create an understanding for their family and hopefully the audience.  I have much admiration how the movie chose to create such a story in this manner.  It is special.  The cast is outstanding. Joan Chen is in this movie! BooBoo Stewart was amazing.
This particular family is church-going, so Christianity is part of the story. However, the story did not seem preachy to me, and I hate being preached at.  I did see a subtle message how wealthy church-going folk don't always have the answers and certainly might display a gap in their behavior in contrast to the relatively poor kid Doug, a prince of a guy and not necessarily in the pews every Sunday.  At one point when Doug was looking out for Nick, the song playing in the background was ""Words that Define"" with the lyrics about the gospel of Christ. I took that as a clear message that people like Doug are what Christ had in mind, whereas regular Christians are awfully challenged at showing unconditional love.  However, Christianity is a lesser theme in the overall story.  There is a lot more going on in this movie.  Make a point of seeing this one.  It is well done and very poignant.",1384214400,6,1336,4.622881355932203
5725024,5,B00CKZE7FC,"Seriously wonderful film... Not really my style, but it totally won me over. I actually shed tears at the end... very rare that.

5725026,5,B00CKZE7FC,"David Henry Hwang's a darn good writer, and I think his involvement in the film shows. The script is great, the acting quite decent, the eye candy is really nice, and the messages are important. I think the less you know about the film before seeing it, the better, so if you haven't seen it yet, stop reading these reviews and watch it. I watched it before reading any reviews and am glad I did. I loved the surprises. Thanks to everyone involved for making this one. I loved it.",1382227200,3,480,4.344444444444444

5725033,5,B00CKZE7FC,"Mark, a shy high school freshman with mild Asperger's Syndrome, was very close to his super-popular older brother, Chaz, to whom he felt much closer than his parents, who were somewhat emotionally distant from him.  When Chaz gets killed in an auto accident, Mark has to deal not only with his own grief, but being virtually ignored by his parents, who are dealing with their own issues.  One of Chaz's friends, Doug, takes Mark under his wing, and he joins the ""study group"" (actually a weekly poker game) with Chaz's friends, including Randy, to whom Chaz was the closest.  The distraction of learning to play poker (which he does remarkably well, with great effort) gives Mark a welcome distraction, but he really relishes the times the group talks about Chaz.  When he learns that Chaz was a volunteer at a local diversity community center, Mark checks that out, eventually learning about a part of his brother's life that he never shared.

Director Quentin Lee does his usual remarkable job with a challenging screenplay, and gets standout performances from a talented cast.  Mark is played by Booboo Stewart (""Twilight"") with his brother Chaz was Harry Shum Jr. (""Glee""); their parents are played by BD Wong and Joan Chen. The actor playing Doug, Tyler Posey, is a current popular heartthrob for his starring role in MTV's remake of ""Teen Wolf.""

The gay aspect of the film is not evident until the latter third, which is a commendable move, in making it clear that the characters' hang-ups go way beyond homophobia. The film pushes the envelope in pointing out that educated, upper-middle income people, including racial minorities, may be so worried about ""fitting in"" that they are not as open-minded as they may believe.  ""White Frog"" made the rounds of many gay film festivals, and I was surprised not to see any awards listed, other than one at the Philadelphia Asian Film Festival.  DVD has trailer and ""making of"" featurette.  Also available On Demand on some cable systems. Not rated, but would be a light PG; recommended for ""mixed"" audiences.  I recommend it highly, and give it five stars out of five.",1375660800,13,2119,4.874651810584958

8582865,5,B00CKZE7FC,"This is a surprising little gem of a movie. I say this because it deals with so much in the way of familial and interpersonal relationships in a compact amount of time. The storyline of this film revolves around an Asian American family and its trials and tribulations particularly regarding their two teenage sons. (NO SPOILERS HERE.) The excellent BD Wong plays the father, Joan Chen is the mother, Harry Shum, Jr is Chaz the eldest son, and a superb BooBoo Stewart is Nick the youngest son who suffers from Asperger's Syndrome (a kind of autism). Despite his affliction, Nick is a whiz in math and school, and does Chaz's homework for him (not necessarily willingly) as payback for Chaz's earlier big brother protection at school. Chaz is also the one who really takes care of him and Nick is very much dependent upon his ""surrogate"" dad. Chaz regularly goes out on Friday night to ""play video games"" with his friends among them being Gregg Sulkin (Faking It) and Tyler Posey (Teen Wolf). Nick wants to join them but is rejected as being too young. At one point, Chaz stays behind for awhile to play basketball with Nick and then later departs on his bike to meet with his friends. Shortly afterward word comes in that Chaz is in the hospital, the result of being hit by a car driven by a bunch of rowdy drunk teenagers. Chaz dies (no spoiler here since it happens at the very beginning of our story and is essential for what will evolve from this tragedy). What we have from now on is basically the following: A coming of age story involving Nick who must learn to overcome his condition and live successfully in an independent way without his late brother to comfort and protect him; a father who must discover the full substance of his youngest son (who, at one point, even wondered if his son was actually his) and learn to fully accept him; a mother who must come to terms with the rest of her family and assert herself when necessary - which she eventually does magnificently; and a final revelation that both shocks and ultimately cements the entire family into a new coherent whole. The supporting cast is top notch; and all play a key role in Nick's evolution as well as the resolution of those elements that were tearing the family apart. Talulah Riley has a key role as a shelter for needy children. The title of this film is a metaphor for what Nick does not want to be and refers to a Chinese delicacy and the way it is prepared. The ultimate sub-text contained in this film's story is really secondary to everything else mentioned earlier in this review.  BooBoo Stewart's performance alone is ""worth the price of admission"" and should have been rewarded with some kind of nomination. Buy or rent this DVD.  It is mesmerizing.",1464652800,2,2743,4.595918367346939
