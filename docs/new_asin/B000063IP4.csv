1690812,3,B000063IP4,"After seeing this dvd for the first time I was surprised at how heavy the concert was on 80's era songs. Not that that's necessarily bad. The newer Kiss songs were taken soley from Lick It Up, Creatures of the Night, and Animalize. There are only 6 makeup era songs on the set. Only 5 are from the Criss/Frehley era. ""Detroit Rock City"",Cold Gin"",""Love Gun"",""Black Diamond"", and ""Rock And Roll All Nite."" I was shocked that songs like ""Deuce"",and ""Calling Dr. Love"" were not included. Some of these songs sounded rushed through. Kiss, during this period, were clearly more comfortable playing the 80's stuff. Average as concerts go. Except for Gene breathing fire, there are no visual highlights to speak of.",1055635200,,708,4.859504132231405
1690813,4,B000063IP4,"My copy is an import from South America, and it is subtitled in Portuguese (the banter with the crowd, not the singing).  Turns out this video didn't hold up as well over time as I'd hoped, but you can chalk that up to the outrageous mid 80's clothing and hairstyles.
Still, this is a VERY hard to find disc - and KISS fans will want to add this to their collection if possible, right?  The set list is decent yet unremarkable, but at least we get ""Cold Gin"" live, which is my favorite part.
Hard to believe it has been 20 years since they first took off the make-up.  Oh god, am I getting old!",1055635200,,594,4.147826086956521
1690814,4,B000063IP4,"Well first off this is a really entertaining piece of film showcasing Kiss 2 years into the non-makeup era and looking a little lost (Gene with his wig held on with a sweatband due to his ""acting"" he was doing on the side, Paul in a ridiculous pink floaty thing and Spruce Kulick playing like his feet are nailed to the floor!).
The set list is good as it features songs from Lick It Up that though lost on the album were much faster and came off better ""live"" which raises another oft discussed Kiss topic - is it live or memorex.... well, there isn't a doubt in my mind that the guitar is touched up as are the vocals (you can hear Paul when hes nowhere near the mic... you can hear his guitar parts when he isn't actually playing it etc etc... the same stuff as would later become very irritating on the Kiss Konfidential video) -
However for entertainment value - well worth buying!",1052352000,,886,4.311377245508982
1690892,5,B000063IP4,"I used to own this concert in VHS format but sadly it was lost behind a built in wardrobe in `94. I scoured everywhere for a replacement then found a copy on DVD format in Amazon.
Having not seen the footage for 18 years I was pleasantly surprised when I pushed the play button - the image was sharp and the sound was clear and very sharp.
The guys obviously knew there were cameras rolling but like the total pros they are played a superb set - very rock n roll and I found myself turning it up LOUD!
It was 1984 and wireless guitar systems were in their infancy back then - I was amazed by just how much `moving around` they did - were not in the same place for long, especially Paul!
And as for Paul`s intro tales..... well, you have to take them with a pinch of salt..... the crowd loved them!!!!
All in all I wish I had been in Detroit that night - KISS were superb. This ranks right up there with the best as far as I am concerned.
If you love the 80`s glitz and glam then this one`s for you - plus Bruce Kullick`s guitar work and the late and very much missed Eric Carr`s drum solo is just sheer class - Paul and Gene were lucky to have them! ;)
KISS - KISS - KISS - KISS",1335571200,,1178,3.9746835443037973
1690893,5,B000063IP4,"Kiss was still at the top of their game  here.  In fact this tour was a smash success and they were smack in the middle of the 80's here , both with hairstyles and clothes so disregard anti 80's idiot reviews that complain about that. Back then these styles were fine and why not have flamboyant clothes on stage sometimes? it's a concert not a workplace. The show is a smoker and this dvd needs to be put out in north america.  Kiss is a great melodic metal band and that's the truth of it and this dvd proves that in the mid80's they were still on top and tearing it up.",1301616000,,572,4.089285714285714
1690894,2,B000063IP4,"I wonder if anyone at this show were bothered by the fact that Simmons and Stanley spend more time staring and making faces at the camera, than playing to the audience. Stanley, in particular, is so obsessed with making goofy faces at the camera, you have to wonder if he even remembered there was an audience in front of him. They open with ""Detroit, Rock City"" for the 2,047th time. Stanley is so concerned with impressing himself, he manages to forget an entire verse, and sings the ""12 o'clock"" verse twice.

God forbid we actually see any of Bruce's solos. No, no, we can't get the spotlight off of Stanley and Simmons, even for a few seconds. So when you hear Bruce playing his solos, you get to see close-ups of Simmons and Stanley shaking their asses, rather than see Bruce's fingers. During the solo to ""Fits Like A Glove"", however, we are treated to a split-second shot of Bruce's FACE. How kind. And while Bruce is shredding during ""Under The Gun"", we are treated yet again to the Stanley and Simmons Dance Show, from multiple angles. Great. Of course, when Stanley plays the little 5 note riff midway through the song, we get a close-up of him throughout, making faces as though he had to practice his whole life, just to play it.

While Bruce rips through the solo to ""Thrills In The Night"", we are treated to a great slow-motion shot of Stanley not only jumping 2 feet in the air, but running at the same time. Wow. Almost as good as the shot of Stanley sucking on his finger during ""Heaven's On Fire."" Thank goodness that shot was in slow-mo also; we wouldn't wanna miss that! There are some great non-threatening shots of Bruce (i.e. shots of him NOT playing beyond Simmons and Stanley's capabilities) just standing behind a mic, pretending to be singing backup, when in fact he just has his face up to the mic (see ""Fits Like A Glove""). Maybe he was trying to hide? Why bother showing his solos, when we can see this? This concert was no doubt edited with Simmons and Stanley standing behind the editor, holding a gun to his head.

Now, of all things, it was bad enough that Bruce didn't even get his own solo. But Stanley? He barely PLAYS his guitar throughout the show. He seems to feel important running around and jumping while holding a guitar, but not actually playing it. Is this guy cool, or what??? Maybe he was resting his fingers for his four-minute ""solo"", when he showcases his undeniable skills by repeatedly pointing at the crowd. It's hard to believe he goes up there playing some simple pull-offs for a few minutes, and then playing cheering section games with the crowd for another few minutes, while there is no solo for Bruce. We do get treated to another great Simmons bass solo. He manages to stretch six notes into 4 minutes. Why play another song, when we can hear that instead?

This show was also heavily dubbed. There are guitar harmonics coming through the speaker system, when both Stanley and Kulick are not playing them. In particular, listen to ""Cold Gin."" Toward the end, Kulick is clearly not playing the harmonics, while Stanley is on the floor doing a Richard Simmons impersonation, while his guitar hangs from his neck helplessly, asking, ""Why am I here?""

Before a cool version of ""Love Gun"", we must endure one of Stanley's 5 minute ""I had to pay a visit to the doctor"" stories, rather than having the band play an extra song. He wastes additional time by describing the jeans he was wearing (""you know, those Levis, tight, 401s?"") I'm sure the audience members were all wondering, ""I wonder what jeans he was wearing that day?"" It's hard to believe he actually sat around writing that stuff.

Eric Carr was a big highlight of this show. Thank goodness he was allowed to have a drum solo. Of course, Stanley can't just say ""Eric Carr on the Drums!"" He has to add his two cents: ""He may look like a boy, but he's built like a man!"" Maybe someone should have told Stanley, those words don't sound quite right, coming from another guy. ""I Still Love You"", ""War Machine"" (with Simmons forgetting the ""let the arrows fly"" verse), and ""Black Diamond"" were other highlights of the show. We actually get to see ALL four members playing, as well as a cool part of the stage show (during ""Black Diamond""). Too bad when Stanley yells ""Detroit, we love you"" at the end, he sounds like someone just stepped on his balls. ""Young And Wasted"" is good as well, despite having to be subjected to Simmons' antics. ""Let's see, Eric is singing this one; how can I get attention?"" Gene must have wondered. We find the answer soon enough, with Simmons running around the stage holding panties. This guy is so cool!

For their encore, they play ""Rock And Roll All Nite"" (WHAT A SHOCK!). It actually sounded pretty good, until they turn it into an 8-minute song. We get to see Stanley at his absolute worst. He attempts some kind of half-ass Stevie Wonder impersonation, then starts moaning into the microphone like a chick in a porno movie. If that doesn't get you sick, watching Stanley swing on a rope and beat his chest like King Kong, probably will. But why stop there? Stanley is on such a roll showcasing his talent, he wraps the mic chord around his neck! Then he unwraps it! Wow!!

This is why this show hasn't been given a proper DVD release, and was left off of the Kissology box set. Judging by the way they edited down most of the other concerts in the Kissology box set series, this would probably be edited down to 4 or 5 songs, and Eric Carr's solo. Stanley and Simmons would be very embarrassed, and rightfully so. Before other reviewers, who obviously will praise EVERYTHING that Kiss does, criticize me the way they criticized the ""mechanic"", they should criticize Stanley and Simmons. They have released most of Kiss' recorded shows (at least in edited form), even the sloppy, mistake filled Largo show from '79. But they won't even touch this, even in edited form. Their actions speak alot louder, than my words.",1255910400,6,5964,4.588180112570356
1690895,5,B000063IP4,"Man, what a blast from the past.  I was 12 when I first saw this concert on VHS.  KISS was my favorite band at the time.  Seeing this concert again made me remember why I asked my parents to buy my first guitar, a Charvel, just like Bruce Kulicks.

If you're a KISS fan, you really do need to get this DVD, or VHS; whatever you've got.  The guys are energetic and put on a solid, entertaining show.  The tracklist is excellent, with a nice mix of classic KISS and their current stuff.  The music is just plain fun and great to listen to.  Is their music going to save the world, like Bono and U2?  Nope.  But for 100 minutes, you are going to be in for a sonic treat.  Like I said, the performances are pretty spot on.  I've heard a lot of Paul's audience banter before at other shows, but who cares?  I will say though, that while I enjoy the classic KISS, the lineup on this DVD is what I loved back when I was in middle school.

Is it cheesy?  You bet it is.  Animal print spandex, big hair, pointy guitars; it's all there.  But what do you expect?  It was the 80's and KISS was enjoying a resurgance in popularity.  And again, it was the 80's!!!

If you want music describing the woes of the world and of the human race, this isn't what you are looking for.  If you want fun, party music and if you're a KISS fan, whether hardcore or casual, you need to check this DVD out.  Even if you don't enjoy it as much as I am right now as I type this, you probably won't have any trouble selling it off.

Overall, good production values, and a great KISS concert.",1137801600,4,1559,4.089403973509934
1690896,3,B000063IP4,"When I saw that Amazon offered this 1984 concert on DVD, I freaked out. I ordered it immediately. But my joy soured some when I popped the DVD in my player. It was made in Brazil, I think. That was one of the cons. The other is a biggie:The video & audio does NOT match up. You see Eric hitting the drums,then hear the actual snare,cymbal,tom-tom,or bass sound 1/2 to 1 full second after you see it. Cleary this problem arose from the VHS to DVD transferring. I'm just waiting for the day when KISS releases it on DVD,the correct way.",1102550400,5,534,4.297029702970297
1690897,5,B000063IP4,"I saw this at the impressionable age of 10 and to this day, I have never seen KISS so quick on their feet and truly Alive!
It seems like people view 80s rock in the way you remember a bad girlfriend you had in high school. Aside from Gene's obvious wig and the 80s animal print outfits, KISS was simply absolutely amazing on this video.
Without the 7 inch platforms, the band speed to and from all over the stage in a way just not possible with the original image. For me, the kream of the krop is seeeing Eric Car (R.I.P.) do a truly amazing drum solo before ripping into Gene's Young & Wasted.
From beginning to end it's non stop rock and roll and hearing Paul's voice on I Still Love You still makes the spine tingle. He sings as if he truly still missed an old flame as he belts it out. As I said I saw this at 10 and had no idea just how raunchy his onstage rants were until I was older. His trip to the doctor's office with his Love Gun is as classic as the song itself. Funny as hell!
This is truly a great view of a band that laid the groundwork for the bands that surpassed them in the 80s, but if you wanna hear fast and then-updated versions of Cold Gin & Black Diamond - be sure to get this. It's not the Kiss you're used to but they don't stop rock and rolling all nite on this great concert video.",1077062400,3,1311,4.00763358778626
1690898,4,B000063IP4,"First off, a correction.  A review below that overall pans the show incorrectly states Rock And Roll All Night does not appear on this DVD.  It does indeed as the last song of the evening and has appeared in every version of this video, including the original MTV edit.
This performance takes place in 1984...making seeing this show even more of a gem now that 19 years have since passed.  The original VHS release of this concert was a best seller for months, staying at the top of the music video charts.  This DVD is an official release out of South America and can be found in stores such as Tower Records and even Best Buy.
Animalize Live Uncensored takes a snapshot of the band.  At this point the band was still running on...releasing albums and touring and breaking new ground, unlike today's nostalgia act version which only reaches into the past.  Heaven's On Fire was a brand new MTV hit.  Bruce Kulick had just been asked to officially join the band at the time of this show.  Eric Carr was alive and well.  Gene Simmons had been trying his hand at acting, so yes he is wearing an unflattering wig to hide his shorn locks (cut for the movie Runaway.) The costumes are very much mid 80s, spandex and animal skins in keeping with the album's concept.
The concert begins with a blistering performance of Detroit Rock City.  The sight of Paul, Bruce and Gene all standing on the platform above the drum riser with the KISS sign BLAZING behind them, arms in a smooth in-sync windmill motion, to the opening chords of the song to this day still gives me chills.  Then watching all three bolt down the stairs to the stage.  A rarely mentioned classic moment in KISS concert history.
The songs are performed faster in this period than one may be used to..which can throw you off...but also give the chance to experience the songs another way.  One can only hear Cold Gin done the same way over and over for so many years.  Keep in mind that the songs are performed in this way purposefully and are not a result of drummer Eric Carr playing too fast, unable to play them at their ""proper"" meter as some have speculated.
The show is relatively short on theatrics for a KISS show.  At this point in their career they had turned the focus to the music.  Make no mistake...the band has proved many times over they can perform on a bare stage and still out do their peers.  The energy level of this show is very high throughout for the most part.
Regarding the solo's:  Neither Gene's or Paul's solos are done with any intent of giving out the illusion of being virtuosos on their instrument.  Paul's tapping routine was purely done as a visual gimmick that build's up to an audience participation thing.  Gene's bass playing is done with Eric drumming along...it's actually a cover of a song from someone else, but the name escapes me at the moment.  Eric's solo is a highlight and quite catchy.  I've found myself pounding it out on more than one occasion.  The solo builds up to Young and Wasted, which is sung by Eric instead of Gene.
This show is definately worth buying if you want to get a glimpse of KISS from this era.  This concert video was the only official release until 2003's Alive IV: KISS Symphony.",1069459200,6,3213,4.5
1690899,5,B000063IP4,"First of all, don't listen to the loser who is reviewing from his GARAGE from FLORIDA. A reviewer from Florida in a Garage with greasy overalls and named 'BUBBA' is not a fan, thats scary. He just wants to be cool. KISS were thriving at this time and kicking butt doing it. They were on the road promoting the PLATIMUM selling album ""Animalize"". Two original members are gone at this point and Bruce Kulick (The one ""GOOBER"" criticized) had not been in the band a week and he was adjusting to being in KISS. For the time recorded and the point KISS were in KISSTORY the DVD is a must in your library, as a real KISS fan and not a mechanic, I bought the video in 1985 when released and I still watch it every now and then and get off everytime. Klassic without makeup KISS!",1065744000,7,772,4.258503401360544
1690900,2,B000063IP4,"Oh brother. Was there anything more funny than KISS in the 80's? This concert is entertainment for camp value, much like a Friday the 13th flick. Don't get me wrong, I'm a KISS fan (and Jason Voorhees too), but I'm not a sheep fan who thinks Gene is God, and KISS can do no wrong.
Lowlights of this show include:
The outfits and hair: Gene's mullet wig and black leather / animal print leggings. What's with the headband, to keep the wig on? Good lord without the makeup, Gene was as lost on stage as Barbara Streisand headlining with Slayer. Paul is here in all his effeminate glory with the feathered pants and bearskin rug shirt (oh wait, my bad, he's not wearing a shirt). Bruce Kulick is on board with his French poodle haircut that just got worse as time went on. As Paul pouts and Gene wags his tongue, Bruce patented his own closeup shot technique. He constantly squints his eyes and puckers his lips until his face resembles a contorted duck. Eric Carr has a zebra spandex outfit complete with hairband, but at least he's sitting down.
Dialogue: What the heck is Paul talking about? The doctor's office visit and the long tongued baby was stupid. As was the `Eric looking like a little boy' schtick. The only time I've seen Paul totally speechless was when a fan threw a sheet up on stage. It was a hand drawn banner featuring KISS to include Ace and Vinnie in makeup. Oh Paul does not like that. In a fit of anger he slams the sheet down. Of course this show is full of Paul's own `What? Who me? Ain't I the coolest one?' Facial gestures that gets ld after the first time.
Solos: Oh man here we go. We see Gene running around stage with his axe bass doing a one string solo that a five year old beginning bass student could do after one lesson. Then he stands with his arms folded and sneers at the audience as if he's just performed the most incredible symphony in the history of music. Next we get Paul attempting a solo on his broken mirrored BC RICH Warlock. Even he has to admit he's doing pretty porly with the `so-so' hand sign. But the sheep in the crowd beg for more. Bruce does not get a solo even though he is no doubt the best guitarist in the band. But Gene and Paul had already learned their lessons. After being upstaged by Vinnie Vincent time and time again, their taking no chances this time with Bruce. Eric is the only saving grace in the solo department, but how far can a drum solo really go?
Setlist: At least they did this right. Mixing KISS classics with Animalize material. Detroit Rock City, Cold Gin, Dr. Love, Thrills in the Night, Lick it Up, etc. During this time though, for whatever reason, KISS had dropped Rock n Roll All Nite from the set. Not that that brings down the whole show, but for those who refuse to see KISS live without that tune, will be disappointed. The show ends with Black Diamond.
As the 80's dragged on and on for KISS it only got worse. Asylum was a decent album, but the costumes were even worse. Then the terrible Crazy Nights album. KISS needed the makeup, Peter, and Ace even back then.",1064620800,2,3055,4.36140350877193
1690901,4,B000063IP4,"I remember seeing this concert on MTV with an ex-girlfriend who was only slightly impressed with the band.  I remember being blown away, since I was more of an 80's era KISS fan, although I loved the 70's stuff.  KISS to me, at that time, was Paul, Gene, Eric and Vinnie.  This DVD, an import from Brazil, brought back all the great memories of watching it for the first time.  Although the bass and drums sound thin by today's standards, it is a good documention of that tour, which I saw in San Antonio, Texas.  The sound and picture quality is very good, probably more of a reflection of the quality of recordings of that time and definitely worth the money.  Paul looks comfortable in that era, Gene looks a littly silly and lost, Eric is right at home, but Bruce does not look like he quite fit in at that time.  However, Bruce really proved how hard he rocks in the Revenge and Carnival of Souls era and turns out that he is my favorite KISS guitarist, even surpassing Vinnie and Ace.  In short, buy the DVD. Even if you don't like it, it will give a good snapshot of what the band was doing at time, just prior to Ace's solo career and God knows what Peter was doing at that time.",1056585600,4,1187,4.267857142857143

While I think this show is incredible, I have to say that the review by Cliff A. Schnurer is spot on accurate.  This video is definitely the ""Paul and Gene"" show.  Watching the video, you hardly realize there are actually 4 members to the band.  I get it, though.  Paul and Gene are KISS.  They founded KISS, they created KISS, they made KISS and they are the only surviving active members to date. That said, it is a shame to see Eric Carr and Bruce Kulick get so little face time, considering their skills far surpass Paul and Gene.  It is really Eric and Bruce that give this concert the energy and earth shaking qualities that most of us love so much.  I would love to see this title released properly on DVD format, as my VHS is getting severely worn out.  For that matter, I would love to see Itunes carry this title.
