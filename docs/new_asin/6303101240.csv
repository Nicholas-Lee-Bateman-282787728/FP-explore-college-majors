563101,5,6303101240,"I had never heard of ""Wrestling Ernest Hemingway"" until a friend suggested that I view it. Wow, what performances the two main actors bring to the screen! I had previously seen Harris in Gladiator, but this film truly proves his talent as one of the finest actors around. Duvall also shines in what is a very realistic performance, showcasing subtle acting at it's best. I was quite surprised the film didn't garner any Oscars as it has all the right elements needed to win many, many awards. And to think that such a wonderful piece of moviemaking was written by a 21 year old. Now that's an accomplishment.
Don't let the fact that this film didn't perform well in theatres, rent it for what it is: A great little film with a stellar cast, which even includes Sandra Bullock in one of her first roles. You won't regret it.",1001894400,14,823,4.530201342281879

One day they meet in the park and at the time of their first meeting neither of them could guess how good friends they would become.  There is not much I can say about this movie, except that it is very, very good. It's a story about friendship, loneliness, life and aging. The screenplay is great (written by a 21-year-old) and every actor is wonderful. Besides the two fantastic leading men (Richard Harris and Robert Duvall), the cast includes Shirley MacLaine and Sandra Bullock, just before her big breakthrough with ""Speed"".

I am surprised it didn't even get mentioned in the Oscars - just proves how over-rated the Oscars are.  However, back to the  film.  Richard Harris is simply brilliant as Frank, an ex-sea captain.  And  Robert Duvall.  This is my second Robert Duvall film; the first being  ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" in which he plays the role of Boo Radley.  Had I not already known that Robert Duvall is American, I would have  thought him to be a Cuban.  His Walter the Cuban barber is just out of the  world, complete with accent and gestures.  Shirley MacLaine has always been  my favorite.  She could light up an entire film even if she only has a  2-minute role.  As the last reviewer has said, you would want to own a  video of this film.

563237,2,6303101240,"Review of ""Wrestling Ernest Hemingway""
Hot Toasty Rag, June 26, 2017

I thought Wrestling Ernest Hemingway was going to be a heartwarming, lightly funny movie about old folks, like Cocoon or The Boynton Beach Club. Its not, and if you're looking for a good movie, don't watch this one.

Sure, Robert Duvall has a pretty good accent as a Cuban retiree, and Sandra Bullock is well cast as a low-class but kind-hearted waitress, but this movie is pretty bad. It could have been so much better, if the screenwriters had thought a little longer. For example, at the start of the film, Richard Harris keeps talking about his son, and how excited he is to see him for a visit. Wouldnt it be an interesting twist if Richards son was dead, but he had Alzheimers and didn't remember? Or when Shirley MacLaine complains about her ex-husband, wouldnt it be clever if Richard Harris was her ex-husband and thats why shes always hostile towards him? I won't spoil anything, but this movie isn't very clever or twisty.

Its also pretty depressing. Richards always talking about how lonely he is, and when he reaches out for companionship, nobody likes him. Its not very inspiring to watch an old person living alone in a retirement community, trying and failing to make friends, trying and failing to have a romance, all the while melting in the Florida heat because his apartment doesnt have a working air conditioner.

If you like Richard Harris, watch This Sporting Life. If you like Robert Duvall, watch A Family Thing. If you like Shirley MacLaine, watch The Apartment. You don't have to watch Wrestling Ernest Hemingway.",1498953600,,1611,4.805054151624549

Robert Duvall and Richard Harris are just outstanding in this film. Two old fellows meet and strike up a casual relationship that grows due to the loneliness of their situations. The action is interesting but the acting is superb.

I'm a Richard Harris/Robert Duvall fan, so that might color my opinion, but they were both at their bests here.  Sandra Bullock and Shirley McClain (sp?) were also very effective - not the bubbly Sandra here, just good acting.  And Shirley has become a fine character actress.

Harris' performance was superb on all counts. Otherwise, a nice little reflective story about coping with aging.

I have enjoyed the story for years and seen it several times. Most recently with a friend who had never seen it before.

This is a movie lovers dream, where the actors and dialogue carry you from start to finish. The film balances the frailty of life and the choices we make with some wonderful scenes of guilty pleasure fun! Duvall and Harrison give the performances of their careers, but smaller characters played by McClain, Laurie and Bullock are also impressive and notable. This is one of those films that grows on you and will soon become a personal favorite. The performances are rich, truthful and painfully real.

This film has been completely overlooked and should have been nominated in all the top categories at the Academy Awards. The acting, direction, pacing and music score are flawless and will leave you smiling, but with a lump in your throat.

564676,5,6303101240,"Wrestling Ernest Hemingway is NOT about Ernest Hemingway, but the importance of love, friendship and touch, especially as we grow older. In it, Robert Duvall plays an unusual character, a somewhat fastidious retired Cuban barber living in Florida. At first Walt appears a sort of fussy little man, because, although Mr. Duvall is not physically small, he somehow gives that impression in this character. However, when Frank, a lonely retired seaman blusters his way into Walt's life, it soon becomes apparent what a tender and compassionate person Walt really is. Walt's gentle straight man to Frank's broad humor makes for lots of laughter and comedy. Together, he and Frank bond, fight, and broaden one another's horizons as they search for love with the women they meet.

Walt has never married, but has formed an innocent attachment to a waitress working in the local cafe (Sandra Bullock). He's entrancingly sweet, and this rare characterization of a mild-mannered, modest barber makes Walt impossible not to love. Consequently, it generates within us a deep sense of gratitude to the young waitress for being so kind to him. When Walt finds out she is marrying and moving away, the dignified pain on his face put me in tears. Of the many different characters Mr. Duvall has played, this is one of the most uncommon in addition to being one of the most lovable.

While Wrestling Ernest Hemingway is especially meaningful to people over 40, anyone over 16 would be touched and enlightened by it. Richard Harris as Frank sometimes over does it, but in Walt, Robert Duvall has created a kindhearted, irresistible personality, turning this story about friendship and loneliness into a beautiful film.

One is a salty curmudgeon, the other a rather proper gentleman.  The story starts when the two meet each other in a park.  From this point on, a developing friendship starts to unfold.  The performances given by these two veteran actors are second to none.  Although the overall theme of the story is rather melancholy, it is an overall depiction of a facet in some people's lives.

Showing off the undeniable adorable of Sandra Bullock before anyone had ever heard of her, of the brilliance of Robert Duvall (as if that is hard to find), and Shirley MacLaine turning in one of the most inspired performances of her overtly inspired career. This is a collection of the greats, together, and somehow capturing the grace of life and the gritty and churning disbelief of age together and creating a memory that doesn't seem to go away. Though it has been nearly 20 years, this remains one of the truest and finest films I have seen and ranks up there for me with Full Moon Over Blue Water. Kudos, esp to Duvall who is in a place of his own.

Buy this movie, no matter what.

  Oh, and just a mention here. Richard Harris somehow makes this film what it is, but yet casts the genius off onto the supporting characters. I am unsure to give 100% of this film's absolute brilliance entirely to him, or take it away because everyone else just shined so brightly because of his perfection of suspension of disbelief. In any review, Harris puts in a performance here that will never leave you, no matter your age, sex, or values.

564805,5,6303101240,"I've owned a VHS copy of this film for many years (originally released in 1993), and have just ordered a DVD, now that it is FINALLY available. This review will focus on the movie itself, and I'll add any comments about the DVD quality after I get it (hopefully soon!). I'm sure that in any format, this film will still rate 5 stars.

I'm not sure how I even first heard of this film, as it passed through the theatres largely unnoticed, and unfortunately also very unheralded, in '93. Surprising to me now that it still hasn't reached a very wide audience, in view of the relative paucity of reviews posted to this site (for both the VHS and DVD versions). Films of this quality regularly get hundreds of reviews on amazon.com, when they are widely-known. But if you're discovering it for the first time from reading this review (or others on this site), my best advice for you is: order it now, sight unseen. You won't be sorry, and my guess is it will become one of the favorite movies in your DVD library.

Watching this again the other night, this film still resonates with unusual sensitivity and feeling for it's principal characters. The plot is simple, focusing on two 70+ retirees living in southern Florida somewhere (maybe Miami, though I don't believe it's ever specified exactly in the movie), who while seemingly complete opposites, and most unlikely to develop any kind of relationship, become fast friends, and rediscover something of enduring value, about themselves.

Richard Harris plays Frank, a former sea captain, who clearly hasn't lost much, if any, of his salt over the years. He's driven by maintaining his physical strength and appearance (""I was a sight to see, Helen....I was a sight to see.""), routinely loud, somewhat rude, and profane regardless of his audience (men, women, or children), and clearly estranged/abandoned/somewhat forgotten by his family, particularly his son (whom we never see throughout the entire movie). When I first saw this movie, Frank so reminded me of my own father, right down to the worn out old orange shorts he wears every day, that I knew this would be a movie that would be dear to my heart for the rest of my life- my deepest regret being that my own father wasn't around to share this movie with. Harris' characterization of this totally likeable, unlikeable 70 to 80 year old (his age changes, according to his audience, throughout the film)firebrand may well be the best acting role in his long, distinguished career. It's a moving, memorable, richly layered performance.

Robert Duvall is Walter, who manages to convincingly pull-off his role as a Cuban retiree, and ex-barber. Walter is a fastidious, relentlessly old-fashioned, polite gentleman, with a platonic crush on a young waitress (Sandra Bullock, in one of her earliest roles) at a local cafe he frequents for his daily lunch of self-made bacon sandwiches. I know what you're thinking: Robert Duvall as a CUBAN? But just sit back and enjoy this one- he is completely lost in this role, and it's a brilliant acting performance.

Clearly, when Walter and Frank meet in a park for the first time, you have little sense that they will find any common ground, and their initial few encounters back-fire as you would expect. But Frank is a persistent kind of guy, and slowly but surely, a relationship grows, supported by several other memorable bit roles by the excellent supporting cast.

And that supporting cast is outstanding, with accomplished actresses like Bullock, Shirley MacLaine (who plays Helen Cooney, Irish landlady of the seaside motel where Frank resides), and Piper Laurie (who plays Georgia, a prim and proper widow who frequents the daily movie matinees, in her attempt to fill in her loneliness, and whom Frank tries valiantly to charm, with varying degrees of success). Micole Mercurio has a small role as another waitress at the cafe where Bullock (Elaine) works, and even this bit part by a relatively unknown actress is spot-on perfect, and heart-felt. There are no wasted lines or unnecessary scenes with any of the characters in this film, and while there also is no grand action of any sort, the intelligent, thoughtful screenplay (story written by Steve Conrad, and expertly directed by Randa Haines)is mesmerizing. Only small problem for me was that, at 123 minutes, I just wish this movie was LONGER. But as it is, the pacing is probably perfect, and each character is given just enough screen time to leave a memorable impression.

I might add that the cinematography is singularly outstanding, too- numerous scenes with obviously carefully chosen backgrounds, and some scenes where the framing of the characters on the background of the scene look like artwork: sailors running through the rain in front of a cafe at night, reminded me of an Edward Hopper painting; fireworks exploding in an evening sky over the ocean, while Frank and Walter watch from a beach; even a simple shot of Frank standing in an alley, where the rubble in the background almost seems arranged with a certain art-like precision- this film is just loaded with brilliant cinematography shots. Expert movie-making, to say the least- and remarkably subtle, too- I've only just noticed some of these things, after watching this film for maybe the tenth time over the years.

The soundtrack (by Michael Convertino) is worth buying for itself (I have a copy), and is simply beautiful, and greatly enhances each scene in the movie, and lends an additional layer of dignity and tenderness to the lead characters, in several memorable scenes. You'll know them when you see them, and no spoilers here, but the haircut scene, and the fireworks by the lake (""feed the fish""), are two such moments, and in my mind, are examples of consummate movie-making, where all the elements come together (acting, directing, cinematography, musical score). The result is nothing short of magical.

I give this movie my highest recommendation. It has passed the ultimate movie test for me: that even after multiple viewings, over many years, it still resonates with feeling. It's a pure joy to introduce someone to it for the first time, too, as I did with a daughter the other night. There is some profanity (from Frank, as you'd expect), and one scene with sexual suggestion (between Frank and Helen), but none of these were such that I would be uncomfortable watching with my children. It's a movie with very mature themes, and probably not likely ""exciting"" enough for a very young audience, but the overriding humanity of this film will likely touch anyone, of any age.

5+ stars for buying this excellent movie, in any format, and pick up a copy of the soundtrack CD while you're at it, too.",1282176000,5,6703,4.913427561837456

564807,4,6303101240,"I didn't really think that I liked Ron Howard films unless they were directed by Ron Howard (or Penny Marshall), but Randa Haines beautifully underrated 1993 film `Wrestling Earnest Hemingway' hit me in the right places.  There is the saccharine levels of Hawardism used in appropriate places (thankfully that predictable ending was not overloaded with sympathy but actually became overshadowed by growth) and the clich&eacute;s are played down by the superb performances.

So, while the director is obviously courting our heartstrings, it becomes a welcomed advancement.

The film centers on two elderly men who are handling their current stage of life in drastically different ways.  Frank has an abrasive personality to endears some but repels most.  He has been basically pushed aside by his son, who doesn't seem to have the time for him anymore, and so he is forced to make the best of his dwindling life by drawing attention to himself.  Walter, also getting along in years, is a quiet and reserved man who flirts with attention but never truly takes the steps needed to gain any.  These men couldn't be more different, but as the old saying goes, `opposites attract' and thankfully these two men found one another.  Through their companionship they learn and grow as people.  Frank learns to finally become less self absorbed (the bike scene was especially moving) and Walter finally learns to step outside of his box and live his life (dancing has never been so touching).  Along the way these two men encounter a few women that change their lives for the better, and the impact they have on the women is remarkably sincere and earnest.

That, my friends, is thanks to the acting.

I'll talk about Duvall and Harris first, since they really carry this film on their shoulders.  I haven't seen much from Richard Harris.  I've seen his stunning 1963 work in `This Sporting Life' and consider it near genius.  His portrayal of Frank here is very moving, and while it falters in areas (he wasn't able to hide his accent well at all) the emotional connection was especially moving.  Even in the simplest things he was honest.  The scene when he first meets Walter, he makes a comment to a young girl about how the `years fly by' and the way he says it, with a masked pain in his eyes, is so touching.  When he hears that his son isn't coming, his minor breakdown, almost made me tear up.  He understood the character, so the technicalities don't really count.  Duvall is the star of the show for me.  I love him as an actor and really admire his soft and subtle work here, because it is so NOT Duvall.  This performance (complete with a remarkably authentic Cuban accent) feels so different from anything he's done before.  You can feel that awkward solitude stripping him of his enjoyment and you can't wait for him to tear it down and finally breathe!

Sandra Bullock, Shirley MacLaine and Piper Laurie are all outstanding here, especially MacLaine, who really embodies Helen with a sense of jilted tenderness.  Her interactions with Harris as some of the films highlights (her take on Irish whiskey alone is priceless).  I really loved Laurie's proper elderly woman, making Frank work for her affections, and Bullock uses her charm (I don't understand anyone who doesn't LOVE her) to the fullest extent, and her final scene with Duvall is just so beautiful.

The film has a powerful message about aging and the ability to remain young at heart and thus find the riches within your own life.  So many, sadly, allow their present condition to limit their happiness, but it is so important to cherish your life and the ability we have to make it something worth cherishing.

Mr. Know it All (MKIA) raved this movie to the point where I wasn't sure if I could possibly enjoy it as much as I was supposed to (hehe) but he actually knew it all this time.  Sure, I don't laud it as much as he has, but I totally appreciate this film and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I've never been one to consider aging a bad thing.  I try my hardest to enjoy every stage of my life and I look forward positively to what my life has in store for me, but a film like this does make you truly appreciate every moment you have, doing what you love with the ones you love.

Thanks MKIA, for the recommendation and that film (such a great friend!).  I hope I was kind enough to your baby!",1266192000,3,4362,4.658823529411765

Today for some reason the movie popped into my head, and I decided to come here to Amazon to buy the DVD.  And as others here mentioned, I too am stumped as to why this particular movie costs so much.  But as another reviewer here mentioned, you can find it somewhat cheaper on the Warner Bros website.  I just went to the site and ordered the DVD for myself!  There appeared to be no shipping charge for me in NYC, so with the tax the total came to $22.  That certainly beats $40 plus tax/shipping on Amazon!

The transfer is nice, but there are no extras and the release isn't any where near what this film deserves, but at least it's available and looks and sounds clear!

This is a movie lovers dream film where the actors and dialogue carry you from start to finish. The film balances the frailty of life and the choices we make with some wonderful scenes of guilty pleasure fun! Duvall and Harrison give the performances of their careers, but smaller characters played by McClain, Laurie and Bullock are also notable. This is one of those films that grows on you and will soon become a personal favorite. The performances are rich, truthful and painfully real.

This film has been completely overlooked and should have been nominated in all the top categories at the Academy Awards. The acting, direction, pacing and music score are flawless and will leave you smiling, but with a lump in your throat. The film is full of subtle yet bold scenes of friendship, missed opportunities in life and so many poignant realities that in real life they just seem to pass us by.

It's perfectly paced, funny, thought provoking, frightfully true and so heartbreaking it should have swept the Oscars in 1993 in IMHO!

There is not one false note in it's 2 hour running length and the music score by Michael Convertino is one of the best I've ever heard. I urge everyone to go to [...] and buy this gem of a movie and look for the out of print soundtrack! This is pure lightning in a bottle and I have never seen any of these actors turn in a better performance!

The film is full of beautifully understated scenes, one where Duvall's character learns his waitress friend is moving away and the subtle look and expressions used by Duvall will just rip your heart out! Both actors have so many good scenes, that you just don't want the movie to end! Not only the main actors, but there isn't a bad performance in the entire film. Harris and Duvall's antics will have you laughing one minute and reaching for the tissue box the next!

I can not recommend this film enough! It's that great and it fit's easily into my top 10 favorite films of all time! Search for it, buy it and be prepared to see and hear how movies are supposed to be made! Absolutely fantastic and it gets better each time I watch it as I discover something new with each viewing.

Ever since then I have wanted to  ask Mr. Duvall or the director ""Whose look did you use in your choice to do 'Walter's' make-up/look""? I thought my grandfather had risen from the dead to make this movie. That was the first thing that drew me in many times to watch this gem over and over. As with the other reviewers I whole-heartedly agree that this film not being nominated for any awards and subsequently not being available on DVD are both travesties especially given the drivel we have seen receive those nods in years past as well as presently.
 On another note--- Try one of Walters made-famous-by-the-movie bacon-on-buttered-wheat toast sandwiches. It is an all-time best!

The movie is truly great in the way it shows how a friendship develops between completely two opposites so late in life.  The scene where Robert Duvall gives Richard Harris an old fashioned shave and hair cut you literally are just as relaxed as if it was yourself that was receiving that treatment.

565214,5,6303101240,"If I looked that up in a dictionary, it might just say... Watch ""Wrestling Ernest Hemingway"". Until I saw this picture I had always thought of Richard Harris as a so-called Actor who never really tried all that hard. Or maybe in casting, people were just closed-minded about his potential. His performance in Wrestling Ernest Hemingway was beyond Oscar-worthy and I feel that the only reason he was not nominated for Best Actor was because this picture received none of the manipulative campaigning put out to the voters.

When Harris's character says to Robert Duvall's, ""Don't tell me I have a lousy son...because I already know it!"" he rates comparisons I think, to Ernest Borgnine in Marty.

There is not a bad performance to be found here. Had I not known that I was watching Robert Duvall in this picture, His performance, the make-up, and his accent may have just convinced me that he really was a retired Barber from Cuba.

Sandra Bullock, every now and then shows what she can do and her character is a good example of her talent. To watch her with Duvall, you ache for him and the crush he has on her. Shirley Maclaine and the rarely seen Piper Laurie (See the Hustler) do so much with their supporting parts, the movie just keeps getting better and better as it goes along.

It was around this time that Harris was experiencing a second chapter in his career. In 1990 after years and years of mostly uneventful work,and considering retirement based upon the worthless parts being offered to him, he delivered an Oscar nominated performance in ""The Field"". Afterward he began appearing in pictures alongside Clint Eastwood, Harrison Ford, and Russell Crowe.

 I now see him as the man in a Sixty minutes interview he did after his appearance in the first Harry Potter picture. He said that when he begins to think of himself as ""Richard Harris, the big movie star"", he comes back to limmerick, Ireland where to the people in a local pub he's just ""Little Dickie Harris"" and it brings him back down to earth.

 That Pixie grinned fellow had a lot of us fooled by toiling away in lesser roles all the while knowing what he could and would do when the chance came.

This picture moved me in a way that rarely happens. What a surprise it was when I happened upon it on a local TV channel and then bought the VHS tape. I eagerly await the DVD release.",1157155200,5,2356,4.577197149643705

Sandra Bullock plays her small, but pivotal role very well and in some ways I think performs better here than her roles once she became a star. Shirley Maclaine, what more can you say about this lady - once a star, always a star. The counterpoint and relationship between her and Richard Harris (Francis) is great.

This witty and softly tragic film contains something for everyone. It is a film about finding soul mates, about love, about facing loneliness and bravely avoiding despair through grace. It is a film about hope. One of the many great crimes in Film history is the fact that so many have overlooked this beautiful and gently profound film.
