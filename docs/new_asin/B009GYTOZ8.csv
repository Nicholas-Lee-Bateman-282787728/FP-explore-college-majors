5334620,5,B009GYTOZ8,"I have loved Dr. Who since the 80's and caught some of the newer series when I could.  When I saw this gift set I was ecstatic!  Finally, I can watch from the beginning of the 9th Dr. and put all of the pieces together.
The extras are a nice touch and an added bonus to a fan that had not purchased any of the series before.  It was well worth every penny and I am trying to savor every episode and all the extras.",1355529600,,414,3.847058823529412
5334621,5,B009GYTOZ8,Had been looking for a good deal on the Doctor Who stuff as i had watched the first series on netflix and my family was interested in getting into this series with me.  I like to have physical media and this set was perfect...and highly affordable compared to buying the series' individually.,1354924800,,292,4.615384615384615
5334622,5,B009GYTOZ8,I have loved Doctor Who for so long. I was thrilled when this came out. I gave the screwdriver to my husband because he likes the 11th doctor more than I do. My favorite Doctors or the 9th and 10th. This is a great set. Too bad they can't do a set of the earlier Doctor Who series.,1354579200,,281,3.8620689655172415
5334623,5,B009GYTOZ8,"This box set comes with Doctor Who series' 1-6, the David Tennant Specials, the BBC America Specials, a comic book, 11's sonic screwdriver, and three art cards. I'm a big Doctor Who fan but I never really bought the DVDs because they were too expensive but when this deal came along, I jumped on it right away!! This set is perfect for any Whovian/Anglophile but you should be wary of the box. It opens strangely from the front and can be very difficult to close.",1353888000,2,463,4.458823529411765
5334624,5,B009GYTOZ8,"Dear BBC, please redesign the attrocious plastic DVD holders for Series 1-4. They tend to break where the DVD discs are held in place and often ruin the DVD discs themselves. The discs also tend to become dislodged during transport and get scratched up. Please rectify this ongoing issue and and do not use the platic slip cover mess things that were used for Series 1 & 2. Use the DVD Boxset type from Series 5/6 and please update the artwork for Series 1. The artwork for Series 2 and onward are still aestethically pleasing but series 1 needs some updating.

*The Series: The show itself is funny, exciting, silly and bittersweet all rolled into one. The way it goes from happy to sad, serious to levity and everywhere in between is something that is truly hard to find these days. The stories are sometimes clever, inventive, but ultimately fun. Yes, there are quite a few stinkers but that is true for any televised program. I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that I love Series 1 - 4 moreso than the recent ones. I still enjoy the current series mostly because of Matt's take on the Doctor though. I like his old weary traveller approach to the role of the Doctor.

*Visual Effects: The new series visual effects are bold, daring and sometimes impressive. They make the first couple of series look really dated as a result but overall, the effects from Series 1 - 4 are inventive, fun and have personality to them.

*The music on the show is fantastic and some argue that it directs the the emotions for the viewer during Series 1 - 4. I disagree with that and I believe that is sorely missing from the most recent series. Murray Gold is an amazing musician and the music from Series 1 & the Specials really showcases his work. I'm not dumping on Series 5 and onward, I just find that it is lacking something that was present in the other series musically.

*The Doctor: The differences between actors does no phase me, sure I have a preference for David Tennant but I also like Matt and Chris' take on the Doctor.

Christopher Eccleston: Chris' Doctor was quite goofy at times but his smile hid a traumatic past underneath. I just wish that we saw more of it in the time that we had with him. Stiil, he was quite enigmatic as a result of that. :)

David Tenannt: David's Doctor was very human and quite lonely if a bit silly at times. The continuation of the budding romance between Rose and the Doctor from Series 1 into Series 2 was made more believeable because of him. His energetic performances were sometimes manic but thoroughly entertaining. He could convey emotions quite well when dealing with the darker and sadder traits of his character. He also had intensity during the most bombastic and dire of situations.

Matt Smith: Matt's Doctor is very evidently the wise old man of the three nu-series Doctors. Alot of his scenes convey his years coming through his face and how he looks at the universe. His evolving care and nurturing of Amy and Rory through Series 5 & 6 shows him invested in their burgeoning life story together. I also liked the fact that he is dealing with his demons and inner turmoil underneath and feeling quilt for Rose, Martha, Donna and so on. I'm excited to where Steven Moffat takes his story and I hope that it is a worthy journey for the good Doctor.

*Companions:
Rose: Rose is the girl who fell in love with the man from the stars. She was swept away on a grand adventure through time and space. Sure, she had a boyfriend but who could blame her for wanting to leave him behind to see the universe with this otherworldly being who has a spaceship that can travel through time and space. People complain about the domestics that Rose' brought to the show. I could not disagree more with this because it grounded the character to the world. Her mother and Mickey add a bit of backstory to her and they were explored during Series 1 & 2. Mickey even grew from meek to being a fighter. Jackie reconnected with her dead husband.

Martha: Martha had an unfortunate storyline, her falling for the man who was heartbroken and in love with someone else. Still, she grew into a strong character throughout her series run. I wish we could have seen the 1 year she was travelling the world spreading the word of the Doctor. She too had a backstory and her family was a part of her life but it was not a rosey story. She also had a career unlike Rose, and her time with the Doctor shaped her into something more that was touched upon in the following series.

Donna: I can understand the criticisms regarding her initial appearance in the Christmas Special for the third series. I have to say that her return during the 4th Series completely shattered that in my opinion. She was not interested in romancing the Doctor. She was not completely trusting of him but she wanted to see his world. She wanted to be an equal partner in saving the world. Out of the three companions during the Davies Era, her story was exciting and seeing her evolve through the fourth series was really funny and cool. The way it ended for her was truly a sad conclusion to her story though.

Amy: For much of her time during Series 5, I could not get into her character. I could understand that Steven Moffat wanted to get away from the domestics from previous series'. So it completely baffles me why he brought a prenancy, two weddings, many deaths and revivals, and a near death during Series 6. I would definitely call those story elements somewhere within the domestic range and soap opera mainstays. Through all that, we never really got to see Amy and her family and her place therein. I found her cold and disconnected in that way. Series 5 can get away with that being that is was part of the story but Series 6 continued that. Sure her and Rory sometimes went home but we never really saw her at home with the family.

Series 7 had Rory's dad and that is something completely tragic in and of itself which leads me to...

Rory: I felt bad for this character through much of season 5. He was killed and brought back and so on. I was surprised that he wasn't thrown into a blackhole for good measure. Still, Arthur Darvil was very amiable, heck he should have been the main companion character for Series 5 and 6. That would have been a total break from tradition.

The Ponds: How it ended for them did no affect me at all. Call it the ""cry wolf"" syndrome but when you have so many scenes of your characters on the verge of dying or being killed, that when it does finally happen it loses a great deal of impact. Even though they did not die, they are gone through timey wimey conventions.

River: The character at best can make a wonderful foil for the Doctor. At worst, she can overshadow (Series 6) the Doctor and be campy. I much prefer her when she is somewhere in between. Not quite a mugging cow and not quite overly ahead of the Doctor. She was, I think very well done during the 4th series two parter. I liked her most recent appearance this season as she was somewhere in the middle. Will she make another appearance? I don't know but it has been established that she will be there before Matt's Doctor regenerates again.

Anyway, we are getting a new companion this Christmas. I don't know if this new companion is in any way similar or the same person we saw in, Asylum of the Daleks. I just hope that we could get away from the too clever and too Ellen Page smart/cynical/sarcastic female companion that seems to plague much of Steven Moffat's writing.

5334625,2,B009GYTOZ8,"My son is a Dr. who fan and I was very excited when I saw this set.  It seemed perfect - it was being released the day before his birthday.  So I ordered it a month in advance, with overnight shipping so I would get it on his birthday.  At 11 pm on the day it should have shipped the site told me it was still scheduled to arrive on his birthday.  At 5 am on his birthday, Amazon sent me an email informing me that the DVD MAY arrive 2 weeks late!  This doesn't leave me any time to come up with something to replace it.  Amazon you really dropped the ball on this one!!  Maybe it didn't arrive, but if this is the case why does the website no longer list it as a pre-sale?  I usually depend on Amazon at Christmas - but given this I have my doubts this year...  The email from Amazon could have at least given a reason beyond the item didn't ship and will arrive in two weeks - that in my opinion is not a reason.",1353456000,10,914,3.8972972972972975

So,6 for a little more than the price of 2? And everything else it comes with? Yes, please!",1353110400,12,335,3.869565217391304
5334627,5,B009GYTOZ8,"I love watching Doctor Who.

Wasn't a huge fan of Christopher Eccleston, not that I hated him either. David Tennant was awesome, quite possibly my favorite. But Matt Smith is starting to grow on me, so we'll see.

I do find it amusing, as one of the other reviews says... this HUGE set is great for someone who hasn't bought any DVDs already. If you have, you're bound to get some repeats.

So for the Whovian who hasn't bought any of them... why not buy ALL of them! =)",1349827200,36,470,4.258426966292135
5334628,5,B009GYTOZ8,"BBC brings you the Doctor Who Limited Edition Gift Set just in time for the holiday season! This limited edition Doctor Who collector's box will be the ultimate holiday gift for Doctor Who fans! It includes the complete seasons 1-6 covering the 9th, 10th and 11th Doctors (Christopher Eccleston, David Tennant, and Matt Smith), over 70 hours in all, plus hours and hours of bonus features including 3 new Doctor Specials coming to DVD for the first time ever. The set also includes a collectible 11th Doctor Sonic Screwdriver, 3 original art cards and the comic book, ""Doctor Who at Comic Con."" It's a Doctor Who dream come true.

BBC Home Entertainment has announced an incredible 6-season release of Doctor Who - Limited Edition Gift Set, covering the new 2005 program from Series 1 through Series 6 (and including the various specials as well, of course). This item is only going to be available in DVD format, so no Blu-ray release here (because, as passionate fans already know, the show was only produced on standard-definition videotape - which is completely incompatible with high-def resolutions - from ""Rose"" through to the 2008 Christmas Special, ""The Next Doctor"").

Cost of the 41-disc title is $249.99 SRP, and as the studio-provided description quoted above says, it will include a collectible Sonic Screwdriver in the style that the 11th Doctor (Matt ""Bowties are Cool"" Smith) uses, plus a comic book, three original art cards, and three Specials which are new-to-DVD. It's available on November 20th. Amazon has a listing for the title, but isn't taking pre-orders just yet. We don't have any further details than that for now, nor do we have any images of the packaging at this time other than the (somewhat blurry; sorry!) thumbnail picture at the right. Stay tuned for updates!

5334630,5,B009GYTOZ8,I was brand new to the world of The Doctor and this was an excellent way to get introduced to all that Doctor Who has.  This combo had everything that was needed to fully watch the new series without confusion and was far less expensive overall than buying the individual seasons(series) separately.  A must-buy for those wanting to get into the series.,1366588800,,353,4.67741935483871

5334633,5,B009GYTOZ8,"I noticed in other reviews that there were several quality control issues.  I have had no problems with the set I bought.  Every disk has played and I have experienced no problems at all.  Seems to be a very superior product.

I can't say that about the storylines though.  I can see why the new series has garnered more popularity than the old.  The effects are bigger and the sets more interesting.  It's a shame the story line suffers.  I am actually getting tired of seeing extinguished races such as the Daleks return time and time again.  I also preferred the series before it became a love story.

The Doctor has always cared for his companions, but in the old series he never asked them up to his flat to look at his etchings.",1363564800,2,734,4.41044776119403
5334634,5,B009GYTOZ8,"Love having all the new seasons. One disc with scratch through the extras so unwatchable, but all the rest in great shape and play well.  They could have done the sound mixing a bit better, once in the shows you need to crank up the volume to follow dialogue, but then the sound effects are LOUD, lol. I am running the sound through  surround system with full control, but still not done right on discs, not really a bad thing though, just noticeable esp on first 4 seasons. And a sonic screwdriver, what more could you want?",1362960000,,525,4.402061855670103

All of this was brought about because of this series and how many of my family members have become addicted to these characters and the worlds created by and for them.

I had seen all of the episodes already on Netflix but had never seen any of the behind-the-scenes/special feature stuff. And these DVDs are loaded with extras, which made the purchase price absolutely worth it! Although I may have to upgrade to Blu-Ray for the seasons that are in HD, but oh well. Still a great deal since I didn't own any of the DVD's prior to this. And the art cards are really cool too! I have them displayed on my wall over the shelf that holds the DVD's, along with other Doctor Who stuff.

What surprised me most was how quickly I received it, especially since it was ordered from a private seller. Since no tracking information was given upfront, I was a little nervous, but the package arrived sooner than I expected. And the gift set was packed very carefully with a lot of cushioning, like a newborn baby nestled lovingly into its carseat.

The extras that come with it are an added bonus. There's literally nothing about this set that I can say is bad other than it's availability issues. I was actually just about to buy ALL of the seasons separately when I found out about this - so I'm definitely glad I saved a good $200 or so.,1357948800,,429,4.180722891566265

5334651,3,B009GYTOZ8,"My mother bought this set for me. Okay. I had started watching the first series a few days later and the second disc was skipping scenes. After the disc finished playing I checked it to have found that there was one scratch on it. The same thing happened to the third disc. I did not check the others.

As I was watching the first disc of the second series with David Tennant I wondered if there were other people that had scratched discs. So I went online found one person and saw that they had checked the discs. So I did just that and found, not including the first series, that all the discs were fine aside from one in the third series. I was grateful that the rest of them were okay but was still disappointed that there was even ONE disc scratched.

I'm still keeping and watching the discs despite the fact that three discs are scratched but if anyone if thinking about buying this set for a loved one or whatnot, please keep in mind that there is a possibility that the discs might be damaged.",1357084800,2,1002,4.296296296296297

This series contains all six seasons and also the Doctor Who Confidential episodes as well. They also have lots of extras, including commentaries, deleted scenes, and more.
The good points of ordering this set are: price (ordering the set is a lot cheaper than ordering them separately) and the extras.
