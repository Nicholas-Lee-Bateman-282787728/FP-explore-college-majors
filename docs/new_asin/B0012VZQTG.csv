The transfer on both films is terrible.  The sound is not much better.  The first movie is supposedly a spy/gangster/monster movie parody.  It's narrated by the main character, secret agent XK150, code name Sparks Moran (Robert Towne).  He infiltrates a gang of thieves who have managed to steal some Cuban gold.  They make good their escape with a few too many Cubans they'd just as soon do without so the criminal mastermind Renzo Capetto (Antony Carbone) hatches a scheme to make them think a sea monster is killing off all the excess Cubans they have onboard the boat they've escaped to sea in.  When the real sea monster shows up.............
This movie is just bizarre.  But I have to admit I did laugh a couple of times because it is so incredibly stupid.  It's impossible to believe a group of adults made this movie; it feels like a high school project (if I were generous I'd give it a C -.  But it's really just a D + effort).

As for the second feature.  The title is definitely misleading.  It's more like a bad vacation.  Two brothers running from the law end up on an island populated with female pearl divers.  The want to get off the island.  Ruthless Queen Pua wants them off in the worst way.  Yes, some sharks are involved but as adventure films go, this one doesn't.  There's little to no suspense.  They sit around a campfire for pity sake, singing and dancing!  A fine time was not had by all, especially when the evil queen decides to toss a girl into the sea (like she could afford to lose a perfectly good pearl picker).
It's an awkward attempt to make more of what it doesn't deliver.  Its original title was simply Shark Reef.  American International Pictures insisted they add She-Gods to make it seem like it was more than a mere morality tale involving a good brother pitted against a bad brother.  Thank goodness it was short (at a little over an hour).

Neither is worth watching again.",1409702400,,2041,4.528767123287671
