8289866,4,B001CU95QC,"Like the previous reviewer said, this was good, but a little old. This features the Shinkansen (Bullet Train) and the TGV, which are two iconic high speed rail systems. It also features Acela, which isn't really high speed (instead of Acela, they should've had another European system, like the German ICE).

The DVD shows both the construction of the three systems and the constant maintenance that they require. The beginning of the DVD briefly discusses the history of railroads. Towards the end, it talks about the future of high speed rails and Maglev technology.

If you're a train fan, don't even think twice about purchasing this.",1381708800,,638,5.009433962264151
8289867,4,B001CU95QC,"The DVD begins with the very first 'trains' - simple ore cars on wooden tracks in Germany, followed by the steam engine (20 - 25 mph in England), then the need to upgrade to solid iron/steel tracks. U.S. steam trains got up to 128 mph, but were replaced by diesels - not for faster speed but much less need for maintenance. (Steam engines required about 3 - 5 hours of maintenance for every hour of operation.) Acela represents the pinnacle of U.S. train service, capable of 150 mph speeds, but limited to less for much of its run due to sharing tracks with other trains. Its electric power system is much lighter than a diesel-electric.

Japan was the first to create a high-speed train system. This required a separate set of tracks and eliminating sharp curves and road-crossings. No fatalities.

France then upped the ante with its high-speed, nationalized trains. When the DVD was produced it had about 1,000 miles of high-speed rail service for an area about the size of Texas. Again, separate lines were required to avoid conflict with slower-moving trains. The innovation was 'forced' by the shock that auto and airplane travel were threatening to put passenger rail out of business. Now about 80-90% of the commercial travel market for 350 miles or less is via high-speed trains. No fatalities.

Japan has since produced an MLX (maglev) train that went 345 mph. Not in commercial service - incompatible with current infrastructure and requires building from scratch.

Unfortunately, the program predates China's move into the high-speed train market, and does not cover their accomplishments - except to mention they're planning a maglev train from the Shanghai airport to downtown, since accomplished. Its top operational speed is 268 mph, the world's fastest.",1364342400,3,1770,5.030716723549488
