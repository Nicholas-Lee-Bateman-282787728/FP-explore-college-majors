8403606,4,B003RF7238,"British Lion Film Corporation presents ""KING'S RHAPSODY"" (26 October 1955) (93 min/Color) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) -- Based on a musical play by Ivor Novello, about a European prince Richard, King of Laurentia (Errol Flynn) who falls in love with a commoner Marta Karillos  (Anna Neagle). The prince abdicates his duties (as Prince) and goes into exile so he may set up house with the woman he loves. When the King dies, Flynn is obliged to return to his throne and marry the hand-picked Princess Cristiane (Patrice Wymore). Years later, Richard finally free to marry whom he chooses, seeks out Marta.

The music is of course the first and foremost attraction. Beautiful as always. Ivor Novello like Johann Strauss and Franz Lehar never failed when it came to music. The story is charming and like so much of Novello's work, bitter-sweet.

Patrice Wymore was Mrs. Flynn at the time.  And director Herbert Wilcox and his leading lady Anna Neagle were husband and wife.
