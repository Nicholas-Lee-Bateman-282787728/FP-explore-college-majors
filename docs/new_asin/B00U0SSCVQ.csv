7027124,4,B00U0SSCVQ,This is an usual film in so far as Hollywood films are  rarely made about South American cultures probably because what is little known about them due to many records being destroyed by european and therefore an understanding of their history. The story revolves around two nations at war with the defeated one leaving Mexico to go to North America but not realising that this country is already inhabited with whom differences of opinion have to be resolved before they are found by their enemies for the penultimate battle,1442793600,4,524,4.887640449438202
7027125,5,B00U0SSCVQ,"A very good and well presented and well acted historical epic from the ancient central american view, with the Mayans fleeing from the more powerful Toltecs, who have acquired the knowledge of metal weapons of wooden weapons, which the Mayans still possess. Having fled to the shores of what is now modern Texas and encountering a native American tribe led by Yul Brynner, George Chakiris, Shirley Anne Field and his people have to put the differences aside and abandoning ancient traditions, much to the annoyance of their high priest Richard Basehart, they have to work together to build their new way of life and surivial, as well as having to deal with the arrive of the Toltecs, led by Leo Gordon. A great movie from 1963, supported by epic battle scenes and a rousing music score, makes this particular Blu-Ray movie, a must see and a must own and I would recommend to anyone, who purchases it online from amazon.com.",1442707200,6,923,4.775
7027126,3,B00U0SSCVQ,Certainly not a great film but fun. Not many films made about the Mayan culture. Too bad they didn't use actors of Mayan ancestry in some key roles. Great Elmer Bernstein score. Transfer okay but could be better. Mono sound is fine for the era it was recorded.,1435881600,5,260,4.4375
7027127,3,B00U0SSCVQ,They could have found better actors for Chakiris and Fields parts !,1435881600,,67,4.666666666666667

7027132,5,B00U0SSCVQ,"I saw this movie when it came to the movie theaters in 1963. I was 10 years old. That was a long time ago. I have recently purchased this movie in its original screen format. Loved this movie then and love it even still..Thank about this for just one moment for those of you that can relate having seen this movie when it came too the theaters,that not only was it great too watch then, but that it was also in a class of its on during this time. I'm just so glad that there are those that preserve these great classic movies and that I think that they deserve our gratitude and a lot of credit for doing so. Thank You. It is sad that this movie did not get  good reviews from the critics during that era from some of the history I have read on it, but what do they know? If you decide to purchase this DVD movie, I think that for anyone who has not seen this classic, that you will be pleased. If you do, it is my hope that the younger viewers that watch this movie, will appreciate it for the era that it was made in and too not compare it to the movies that they have now .I will eventually buy this on blue ray.",1465689600,2,1115,3.9776785714285716

7027139,5,B00U0SSCVQ,"Other than Mel Gibson's ""Apocalypto""  This is the only other movie I have seen dealing with the Mayans.  More unique than that its the only movie I have seen that has zero European presence ""Except the actors"" but is based on the meeting of Mayans with Native north Americans!!  There is some archeological evidence pointing to the Mayans making as far up into the states as the Ohio Valley.  I saw this movie a few years ago & found it so interesting I was very pleased when Amazon.com showed it in my search reference.  I love History even speculative history like this meeting of two worlds.  Yul Brynner is great as always & much like Duane ""The Rock"" Johnson has that unique look about him  so he can successfully play many different ethnic heroes & pull it off.  But this is a great action adventure story & a pleasure to add to my collection!",1448496000,4,849,4.467532467532467
