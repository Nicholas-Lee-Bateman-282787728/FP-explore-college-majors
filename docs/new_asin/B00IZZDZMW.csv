We're enjoying what you are sure to find a satisfying aerial journey, when you inset this disk.",1410048000,,264,4.760869565217392
6307085,5,B00IZZDZMW,"A must have for those who would love to travel to the southwest region of the USA but can't.  1st Smithsonian Channel Blu-Ray that I've bought and will not be the last.  It is broke down by individual states.  Have only viewed Arizona so far but WOW!!!!. Very impressed.  Though the Blu-Ray is not in 3D, if you have a 3D player and 3D TV capable of converting 2D to 3D, you will be pleasantly surprised as this appears to have been shot in 3D though it was not.  Thought I knew a lot about Arizona but have learn several lessons about the state. Looking forward to viewing the other states in the Southwest.  Deem Smithsonian Channel: Aerial America - Southwest (Blu-Ray) a must buy.",1408147200,8,684,4.432
6307086,5,B00IZZDZMW,"This is a great series and we love the Southwest and the mingled cultures, so seeing this gives us a different perspective and an excellent history of the development of the land and states. Wow, what a neat idea!",1406851200,2,213,4.487179487179487
6307087,5,B00IZZDZMW,"If you have wanted to visit the southwest and wondered what you may see and care to visit, this DVD is an excellent overview of beautiful destinations.

It is done with photography and a narrator. Each state has it's own section of the DVD so you can stop it at any time or even skip to the state you wanted to know more about.

I watched the entire DVD and learned about some new sights that I am now interested in visiting in the future.

You will learn about the cities, natural features like lakes and mountains, the animals and plants , size and number of people living in the state, and more.

You will definitely will enjoy this DVD. You feel like you are actually there visiting the state.

6307088,5,B00IZZDZMW,"The seller did get the product to me prior to the arrival date in new condition. The Aerial America series is very enjoyable, especially this particular one, which has Florida in it.",1446163200,,182,4.71875
6307089,5,B00IZZDZMW,When we moved to 4K we found most of our nature/travel blurays were really poorly produced and failed the 4K upconvert test.  4K tends to improve the picture greatly if the disk is well mastered but quickly shows up flaws in the source materials. This series from Smithsonian is stunning on a 4K system be it TV or Projector! It was clearly produced with lasting quality in mind.  I wish they would release more.,1443052800,,412,4.554054054054054

6307092,4,B00IZZDZMW,"Love the scenery and you do learn a lot from this program. Makes you want to start a list of all the places to go before you die. I would have given it 5 stars if they would lay off the civil rights junk, it's been fifty years it's time to get over it.",1438819200,2,252,3.685185185185185
6307093,3,B00IZZDZMW,Wonderful photography but I wanted more nature - Monument Valley not even shown. Too much man made.,1437264000,,99,4.882352941176471
6307094,5,B00IZZDZMW,"Aerial America is an interesting mix of beautiful aerial views, history, trivia, gossip, landmarks and little known facts.",1437091200,,122,5.833333333333333
6307095,4,B00IZZDZMW,"Mostly outstanding, except for all the bias and misinformation. They got some major facts wrong, for example in Arizona we get our water mostly from the verde and other rivers. The colorado river is NOT our only source. There were many other things they got wrong.  The photography is fantastic. The script is faulty.",1434499200,5,317,4.87037037037037
6307096,2,B00IZZDZMW,I do not have a problem with showing the negatives because this is a part of the fabric and history that makes each state unique. But lets just be honest about it and fair when it comes to political input which quite frankly just does not belong in a production of this type. The left leaning commentary is so obvious that I cringe at its predictability. The liberal indoctrination on every front is unbelievably relentless especially on the academic front.,1433980800,19,457,4.725
6307097,5,B00IZZDZMW,"Loved the scean and all the great info beautiful area. My question is why was Tennessee left out. We would like to see all the
Beauty of Lookout Mountain and many other areas. So much history there",1433721600,,197,4.351351351351352
6307098,4,B00IZZDZMW,"This was a good presentation for places you might want to travel to, but I would have preferred a more nature type show.  It showed too many towns & man-made locations for my personal taste.  It would have been much better if it had just concentrated on natural settings alone from my perspective.  Only about half of the episode showed natural settings.",1432944000,4,354,4.67741935483871
6307099,5,B00IZZDZMW,Nice HD.,1431993600,,8,3.5
6307100,1,B00IZZDZMW,you never fail to mention republican scandals like Bridgegate and watergate and fail to mention Teddy Kennedys  scandal but mention the death of Jfk junior off Martha's Vineyard? So obvious. What a joke!,1431820800,12,203,5.151515151515151
6307101,1,B00IZZDZMW,This would be one of the most fantastic series ever if it wasn't for the constant interjection of liberal opinion.,1431216000,16,114,4.75
6307102,4,B00IZZDZMW,"I use these fly-over videos as visual ""background music"". This video is the least impressive of the Smithsonian efforts to date. Not to fault the producers. It's just that the topography of  SE USA is not as impressive or beautiful as other areas. If you have a fondness for the SE you may appreciate the video more than I do.",1429401600,,326,4.433333333333334

6307107,3,B00IZZDZMW,Great photography but rambling script. Scandals detract from this series.,1428105600,5,73,6.4
6307108,4,B00IZZDZMW,"Interesting--with a lot of information.  But the Florida section is heavy on Miami, with a lot of tourist info and little coverage of the rest of the state.  The Alabama and Mississippi sections are heavy on racial problems--which are hardly mentioned in the Florida section!",1426377600,,275,5.088888888888889

6307111,5,B00IZZDZMW,"Wonderful series - very informative - I learnt a lot about North Carolina that I hadn't heard over the past 8 years from moving here!
Recommend it just for the views, let alone the factual content.

Just need them to issue it on a Region 2 DVD so I can show my family...!",1421280000,4,271,4.113207547169812

As I did a road trip around this region in 2013, I was very pleased to revisit these unforgettable places by air. Highly recommended if you love America, architecture, history, nature, curiosities and beautiful scenery.",1417996800,3,363,5.385964912280702

8646912,2,B00IZZDZMW,"This series was produced by something called Tusker TV. Aerial views are enjoyable, the photography good, as expected of the Smithsonian, where some of our most iconic photography can been found in their outstanding magazine. The narrative, however, is shameful. The Smithsonian tradition of factual accuracy and political neutrality has been abandoned. Tusker seems not to employ a researcher, or a fact checker. Many things presented as facts are not, and many seem to have been collected from tourist brochures or social commentary. Important, even compelling, historical data are ignored, replaced with often obscure ""facts"" of dubious validity. Narrative seems driven by the desire to present locations and events through the prism of liberal, politically correct, reality. This is best watched with the sound off.",1464566400,10,819,5.56
8646913,2,B00IZZDZMW,"Great scenery and history but the liberal bias is over the top. Ex: Michigan-you mention  Eminem and michael moore but not Ted Nugent or Kid Rock?
Alaska-""many say the race [Iditarod] will be cancelled due to global warming?"" Who are the many? temps for the race are almost always below -20F.
Massachusetts-no mention of Chappaquiddick
New Jersey-bridgegate?",1462147200,11,358,5.280701754385965

8646915,5,B00IZZDZMW,"I bought this series as a gift for my mother.  She watches my 9 year old niece every day and my niece has now watched the entire series at least 4 times.  I originally saw this series on the Smithsonian channel and was mesmerized with the amount of information that they pack into the video.  This isn't your average nature series.  There is so much information about the history of America, good and bad, architecture, America's infrastructure, manmade projects and some nature thrown in, a lot of it you probably didn't know.  Great series and highly recommended.",1456876800,,565,4.783505154639175
