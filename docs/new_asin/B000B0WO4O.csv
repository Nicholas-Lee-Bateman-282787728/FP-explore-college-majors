2398926,1,B000B0WO4O,"This movie was arranged by Walmart to counter ""The Walmart Movie, The High Cost of Low Price"" DVD by Robert Greenwald. Buy it if you want, but when was last time you paid real money for a corporate info-mercial? You get that crap every day on TV for nothing.",1132358400,5,258,4.285714285714286
2398927,5,B000B0WO4O,"I saw this when it originally aired on PBS and it made me both angry and sad. Angry that a huge BILLION dollar company cannot afford to give their employees affordable healthcare,put some AMERICAN companies out of business(Rubbermaid)because of their greedy buying tactics and overall have shady business practices. Sad because they have been getting away with this irresponsible behaviour for far to long. People are beginning to wake up and realise how much harm this company is really causing America. If you need to find out information for yourself please buy this film. You will walk away from it never wanting to shop at Walmart ever again.",1132099200,53,647,5.0
2398928,1,B000B0WO4O,"a) Rubbermaid is NOT out of business.
b) If Wal-Mart pays so poorly and if it provides such poor insurance compared to other companies, read mom and pop here, how come it is the LARGEST single employer in the U.S. and all those downtrodden Wal-Mart employees are not RUNNING to the nearest mom and pop to take advantage of all those benefits?
c) Does anyone remember the great howls of complaint about how Wal-Mart was ruining the small town ""drugstore/pharmacy""?  Well, it looks like the verdict is in on THAT one... WalGreens is the business that shut down the local drugstore, NOT Wal-Mart.

This is a liberal as usual anti-big business video from a network that is decidedly anti big business, but surprisingly gets a lot of MONEY from ....big business...

Why did I watch it?  I got it to show a couple of clips to a media class and let them decide for themselves.",1203033600,5,869,4.587096774193548
2398929,5,B000B0WO4O,"In today's sound bite world, getting the truth out of a news story can be difficult. While the evening newscasters reduce the top stories to little more than broken sentences designed to run in spots not longer than thirty seconds and often much shorter, the high-quality, fairly reported in-depth looks like those put out by PBS's Frontline series are a true treat for the information seeker. Certainly, this was the case here.

Some might be tempted to label this title as preaching to the converted, but I would not agree. PBS has done an excellent job of showing exactly how the low prices found at Wal-Mart directly translate into fewer jobs in the United States. Is Wal-Mart Good for America looks at the issue more from the perspective of the United States economy and what Wal-Mart means for the United States worker and less from the perspective of foreign worker's rights, unlike&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wal-Mart-The-High-Cost-of-Low-Price/dp/B000BTH4K4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wal-Mart: The High Cost of Low Price</a>. This different perspective makes both titles worth viewing, they both do an exceptional job of addressing the issues.",1200355200,,1201,5.709497206703911
2398930,5,B000B0WO4O,"A excellent show on what really goes on at Wal-Mart. This company is like a run-away freight train. Really sad that greed could cause so much turmoil in our society. I believe Wal-Marts profits for last year was around 350 billion, yet they keep trying to bully themselves into more cities and towns across America. I love to see former employees of companys like Wal-Mart, blow the whistle on the inside information that you don't get to read about in the news. Maybe someday, somehow this giant gorilla will be brought to its knees.",1186099200,2,534,4.691489361702128
2398931,5,B000B0WO4O,"To understand the economic effect of Wal-Mart on the United States, maybe it's best to start by looking at their enormous growth in a relatively short time.  Aggressive is a good word to describe this company's approach to retailing.  In 1970, there were 38 stores.  In 1980, it was 286 stores.  In 1990, Wal-Mart had 1500 stores and overtook all of its competition in 1991 to become the largest retailer in America.

Part of this huge influence on our markets can be partly attributed to an ill conceived, permanent trading agreement with China during the Clinton presidency.  In the early 1990's, Wal-Mart flooded their store inventories with manufactured goods from China and low wage countries.  These products had a high mark-up which seriously boosted profits.  By the late 1990's, Wal-Mart was dependent on low cost Asian imports but it suited them well financially.

China pays employees anywhere from 25 to 50 cents an hour for work.  This helps keep production costs down.  So much so that it hurts American companies trying to compete and has even forced some of them out of business.  As stated in this program, Wal-Mart has some 6000 global suppliers for its goods and 80 percent of those suppliers are in China.  Knowing that China is the largest exporter of consumer goods to the U.S. economy and Wal-Mart is the largest retailer in the U.S. economy in consumer goods, it becomes abundantly clear that Wal-Mart has designs on dominating all retailing in the United States.  One interview with an employee from the Port of Long Beach also reveals some interesting information.  The port brings in 36 billion dollars of consumer goods from China each year and the U.S. exports 3 billion dollars of raw materials to China.

With a massive imbalance such as this, you can only imagine the frightful trade deficit it can create.  Since this program first aired on November 16, 2004, Wal-Mart reported record sales of 285 billion dollars, up by 11 percent.  The commerce department reported a record trade deficit with China of 162 billion dollars, up by 31 percent.  With these figures in mind, one expert in this program estimates that this lopsided economic situation has caused America to lose approximately 1 million jobs to China since the early 1990's.

This documentary is not all one sided.  There are interviews for and against Wal-Mart and their business practices so it is a fair look at both sides of the picture.  In the end, from my viewpoint of the evidence given, it appears that Wal-Mart is not good for America for many obvious reasons.  This mega-company appears to hurt the U.S. economy more than help it.  To further examine Wal-Mart and their structure, I would highly recommend the documentary `Wal-Mart: The High Cost of Low Price' in conjunction with watching this one.",1179964800,6,2804,4.917021276595745
2398932,2,B000B0WO4O,"This review will probably not be received with equanimity by most americans...

The movie by frontline focuses heavily on the fact that China is putting in a LOT more goods thru walmart into USA at a MUCH cheaper price than can be manufactured by american companies, and that thousands of jobs are being lost etc..

All admirable points and no doubt true.

Before  we ask if ""Walmart is good for/to America"" in isolation, in the much vaunted/desired ""GLOBAL"" economy that has been vigorously pushed by the so called economically developed nations over the last century, shouldnt we ask ""Has AMerica been good for/to the world 's economy"" as a whole , in a Global/trans national view? considering yourself as a ""global"" citizen rather than just an American.

Now all of a sudden, when the technological superiority has been evened out in consumer products, but the relative wealth level is still enormousl y lopsided, it is UNFAIR for those countries to sell cheaper?

By that argument it would have been unfair to even colonize america from the point of view of the native Indians, or unfair to sell arms for INCREDIBLE amounts of raw materials/labour in extremely uneven exchanges over the past 60 years with all the 3rd world nations. Global economics ALSO has its cycle of evolutons, and I for one, am glad that extremely poor people for whom this is  is pretty much a survival issue are able to raise their living standard a little, as opposed to America, where the problem of the ""poor"" is..obesity. The real culprit here is the ""Corporation culture"" that the ""developed"" countries have created, with th result that the top 1% of the population in the USA control 90% of the wealth. this would have been a better DVD if it had not played upon the fears of a public in inflaming the ""chinese are taking our jobs"" model and focused on corporate greed, of which walmart is only a single example in the USA.

I found the DVD amusing .",1162944000,5,1935,4.704142011834319
2398933,5,B000B0WO4O,"This documentary was first shown as a expose` on the PBS series, Frontline.  It started a trend.  It asks the hard questions about how Wal-Mart became the world's largest retailer, and at what cost?  It is not preachy as with Robert Greenwald's version and it's not biased like Michael Moore.  It gets both sides of the arguement to explain themselves and it gives the viewer the chance to decide.  Very powerful journalism!",1144022400,14,424,4.833333333333333
2398934,5,B000B0WO4O,I had no idea how much the Chinese have a grasp in our world or retailing.  The cheap labor markets we have created over there have started a frightening trend in world commerce.  How much does Wal-Mart care about human rights violations in China?  What about the million or so American jobs being lost because of Wal-Mart's slimy practices?  What is happening to our country?  We are selling out to the lowest common denominator and greed not service seems to be the corporation's motivation.  I thought Frontline did a very nice comparison of Rubbermaid vs. Wal-Mart.  Kind of good vs. bad ways to conduct international business.  Wow!!,1141862400,11,638,4.897196261682243
2398935,4,B000B0WO4O,"This movie is situated between Greenwald's High Price of Low Wages and the other pseudo-documentary, Why Wal Mart Works and Why it Makes Some People Crazy. It is very well researched indeed. Actually, and I know this is not the right forum, but I would respectfully submit to a previous reviewer who wrote that this movie was a pro-Wal Mart propaganda piece that he/she (named DW ""real life"" (Texas)) probably confused it with the Why Wal Mart Works movie. It is understable as you actually have a number of Wal Mart ""documentaries"" on the market, either pro or con.",1138320000,9,566,4.7272727272727275
2398936,5,B000B0WO4O,"This is another superbly done documentary from the award winning PBS investigative journalism series Frontline (Peabody Award, Emmy and many more!). Disregard what one reviewer said about this being pro-Walmart propaganda paid for by the corporation. He's obviously  smoking something, because this is made and hosted by Hedrick Smith, a PULITZER prize winning journalist who used to write for the NY Times. He is one of America's most respected journalists. I started watching the show since I was in high school (I'm now late 20's) and their shows are exceptionally high quality. Now, if Frontline is interviewing people who lost jobs and showing Rubbermaid factory equipment being auctioned off because they got put out of business by Walmart, how is this pro-Walmart?

The story starts in America and its impact on the US economy. He interviews some professors, economists, managers, suppliers, and executives. Then the story moves to China and HK, and then back to the US. There are some very clear insights from nmost of the people interviewed especially from one professor who talks about the shift in American culture and business history.

Is Walmart good for America? I can't answer that and neither can Frontline. This documentary does an excellent job presenting facts without judgement and presents both sides and the complex shades in the middle. It asks some thought provoking questions. The US trade deficit is getting worse every day. Quality is going up (some ""Made in China"" stuff is now very good and getting exponentially better every year), and that's really scary for us in America. Who's the blame? Well, all of us. We're not competing well in the global economy, and we want the cheapest goods. We're not willing to put our money where our mouth is.

If you're interested in economics, history, social issues, this is a must see. If you care about the American economy, and global events, you should watch this documentary. It's loads better than the ""Walmart, the High Cost of Low Prices"" film (which is very one sided and not nearly as well done). oh,.. and start learning Chinese!",1138060800,21,2108,5.0315186246418335

this is an absolutely fascinating look at how a single corporation can have the power to change the market.

8081225,1,B000B0WO4O,"Frontline is too easy on Wal-Mart. It ignores the low wages paid to employees, the company's violation of American labor laws like refusing to pay overtime to employees, and finally, Wal-Mart's  parking lots are not monitored on a regular basis. As a result, many shoppers have been kidnapped and killed.
Everything considered, Wal-Mart is not good for America. Shop at Costco,Target and even better, Safeway. which pays union wages.",1389571200,3,433,5.27536231884058
8081226,4,B000B0WO4O,"As an employee of Wal-Mart I was very interested in viewing this news documentary that was done a few years back on the PBS series ""Frontline"". ""Is Wal-Mart Good For America"" is I feel an unbiased look at the largest retailer in the world. ""Frontline"" doesn't look to vilify Wal-Mart in its business dealings nor is it out there trying to convince everyone that it is peaches and cream when Wal-Mart comes to town. What the documentary does do is show the viewer how Wal-Mart works at being the biggest retailer around and the ways they try to draw you to come into their stores and buy, buy, buy. There are things I learned I didn't know before how they lure customers to spend their money at Wal-Mart and I work there! Certainly for me it was an eye-opener and educating. Working for Wal-Mart I have met people who for them shopping at Wally World is almost like a religious pilgrimage. There are others who I have talked to who would not step inside a Wal-Mart if their life depended on it. Either way you may feel about this retail chain if you have the chance to view this documentary I would highly recommend it. I believe you may find it as informative as I did and understand better the business practices of Wal-Mart. If I had one complaint it would be that I wish it was longer. I have this feeling from watching the documentary there was many more stories behind the business dealings of Wal-Mart that was not covered by ""Frontline"". No doubt due to the 60 minute time limit for the show ""Frontline"" stuck to just the biggest or at least more well known incidents involving Wal-Mart.",1385424000,,1594,4.5

What didn't get mentioned is why WM basically does what it does - your neighbors and friends FLOCK there to spend piles and piles of money. While the economic implications of WM's contribution to China's empire is obvious and dramatic, it didn't happen by accident.

8081231,4,B000B0WO4O,"I am just a college student who studied business, and now I work in the retail industry. I'm not particularly out to get Wal-mart or anything but this documentary really shows how their greedy practices have been a MAJOR contributor to the current self-destruction of our US Economy.

Everyone likes to shop there and save money, and then we wonder where all our manufacturing jobs have gone. This documentary gets to the bottom of it, and shows why we need to be concerned- It's only BEGUN to get serious. The documentary is by PBS's Frontline, which guarantees they will try to be as unbiased as possible. They present the facts, let both sides state their case, and then you can form your own educated opinion. Here's a tip though... When one side continually says things like ""We're not going to comment on that"" or if they aren't willing to comment at all... They are doing something they KNOW they shouldn't be.

They are exploiting China, whose workers are paid 50 cents an hour or less, and given NONE of the labor protection OUR employees get. So OF COURSE, they can make TV's or whatever cheaper then we can WITH the price of shipping across the Pacific Ocean included. Our companies and factories can't compete, and as a result, China is easily scooping up entire industries, while we go into serious debt and even bankruptcy. Our unemployment is soaring. We blame the Democrats or the Republicans or Obama or Bush, but it really comes down to how willing Americans are to demand cheap prices at Wal-mart and then stick our heads in the sand like an ostrich and pretend there are no consequences. ""Wal-mart""... its called a ""monopoly,"" and isn't our government supposed to break up those things?

Another great documentary of a similar nature is:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wal-Mart-The-High-Cost-of-Low-Price/dp/B000BTH4K4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wal-Mart: The High Cost of Low Price</a>, which goes into many different levels of unethical Wal-mart practices.
