2561657,5,B000FDFSJA,"Oh my gosh!! I don't even know where to begin with the compliments on this DVD!! This DVD explains about Chris Brown's life and how he is just a regular teenager just like all of us. He's not different just because he's famous! Which I don't mean in a disrespectful way. He goes through the same things all us teenagers go through! While watching this DVD, it makes you realise that he is just the same like all us teenagers, likes hanging out with friends and fooling around! Not only is there a journey of his interesting life, but he also has the makings of his three videos ""Run It! (f. Juelz Santana), ""Yo (Excuse Me Miss)"", and the ""Gimme That- Remix (f. Lil Wayne)"". Not to mention a session of krumping with the one and only, quote and quote Chris Brown and a can full of bloopers. So overall this DVD is great and is a one of a kind just because the hot looking teenager Chris Brown is in it. So if you didn't already buy this DVD, as one of Chris Brown's biggest fan I say... GO OUT TO THE STORE AND BUY IT!! And believe me when I say, you definitely will not regret my advice! I'm sure a lot of the other Chris Brown fans agree with me as well.",1154476800,6,1155,4.137777777777778

8121115,4,B000FDFSJA,"This dvd is really really good. I bought it within the last month and even though it was filmed and released towards the beginning of his career I still appreciated all the footage that they put in the film. It was really nice to see his goofy self and the way he interacts with his family. With celebrity's/famous people its often hard to remember that they are regular people and go through the same emotions and feelings, watching this film helped me to see the real him and It was really nice to do so. Watching this so far from when it was released was also cool because I get to see how much he has grown; I was able to not only see his journey that was shoed in the DVD but I also got to see him in the beginning of his career to the present. This is a great great great DVD that all fans and supporters of Chris Brown should see.",1333238400,,837,4.078787878787879
