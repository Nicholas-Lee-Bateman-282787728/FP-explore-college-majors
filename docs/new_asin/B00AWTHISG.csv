8558589,5,B00AWTHISG,"Can never go wrong with an Akshay Kumar movie.  Funny, fast paced, action movie.  It had good reviews in the tabloids too.",1367971200,,122,4.5
8558590,3,B00AWTHISG,A bit long winded and I was hoping for an endingsoon after the middle of the movie......Not one of Akshay Kumars best...,1362614400,,120,4.5
8558591,5,B00AWTHISG,"Very funny!!  If you liked ""Kung Fu Hustle"", you will love this movie.  Ashkay is a delight. You can't even describe it to people; they must see it to understand the plot, because it is convoluted, complex, and oh, so funny.  I left the theatre feeling good, and now I'm ordering it to enjoy it with family and friends.",1358380800,3,319,4.372881355932203
