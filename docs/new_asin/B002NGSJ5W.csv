8630194,2,B002NGSJ5W,"The video on this dvd is terrible.  It's not as long as stated The first video of the Jackson 5 is so grainy you can't even really tell it's the Jackson 5 or who it is.  The only decent part is when Michael is doing ""man in the mirror"" at the awards.  Most any thing else on the dvd is on the Live in Bucarest (not spelled correct) and with much better sound and video quality.  Use your money on something worth while and NOT THIS DVD.",1255564800,,436,3.9770114942528734
