7874193,3,6304584350,"Despite this film may lack certain plot/storyline or some screenplay to make it seem more apocalyptic, this was a decent OVA. I happened to like this movie and even though its not the greatest,  it has it's moments, especially the ending. I can also see some aspects of this anime can relate to ""Angel Santuary"".",1455408000,,312,4.672727272727273
7874194,3,6304584350,"This is a cool anime. If you're into the ""Digital Devil"" or the games you'll probably like this. I like the storyline and the broader concepts presented. To me this is a hidden anime gem that is a welcomed addition to my collection.",1423699200,,232,4.4186046511627906
7874195,4,6304584350,"First off, this movie's original title is ""Shin Megami Tensei: Tokyo Revelation"".  The series title removed due to Shin Megami Tensei series only exclusively available in Japan at the time.

It is a tie-in/prequel to the Shin Megami Tensei video game series.
If you're a fan of those games, you'll understand this movie.

Sometimes it does feel a bit rushed and may be missing some information here and then, but usually will repair any confusion within the next few minutes.

Bit too fast paced of a movie, only for the fans of the ""Shin Megami Tensei"" games or ""Digital Devil Story"" book.",1315612800,4,590,4.754901960784314
7874196,2,6304584350,"Two stars for the odd humor contained in this movie, and zero stars for the plot that tries to be overly impressive, but ends up being confusing and not that interesting to me at all...everybody has something they dislike...this one right here. =(",1284422400,,247,4.767441860465116
7874197,2,6304584350,"I wanted so much to really like Tokyo Revelation.  I liked the characters, the concept, the art style, the overall look. (Although I can understand some people not liking any of those)  But it failed.  It falls on it's face.  Cerberus, the 3 headed dog of the underworld, lacks 2 of his heads... points like that grate on the nerves.  The story is underdeveloped, the main characters have some development, but never seem to get anywhere because the story isn't fleshed out enough to give them room.
The dialogue needs a lot of work and research.
It should have been done more slowly, and done as a longer series.  Double the length or perhaps more.  More fight scenes with all the otherworldly demons introduced.  More conflict and confrontation between the human characters. More development on the identities of characters and their relationships. More internal conflict for the characters who have to accept changes in themselves and those around them.
It's not the worst anime I've seen, but it left me feeling like I'd been cheated out of something worthwhile.",1080950400,,1066,4.916201117318436
7874198,1,6304584350,"The majority of anime fans tend to be the most uncritical consumers i've ever encountered. ""Tokyo Revelation"" is horrible: its characters have no depth, its plot is mediocre and predictable, and its animation is horrendous. If this was adapted into a live-action movie even Hollywood wouldn't release it... If it was written into a novel it would probably never see print... and if it did no literary critic worth her salt would consider the story to be worth any literary acclaim.
  the dialogue is written by either a team of overworked monkeys or semi-literate manga fans who think a good storyline involves some lesbian erotica, demons, and scantily clad female characters who speak in one-liners.
  why, for the love of god, do many anime and manga fans like this kind of garbage? have they never read a decent story in their lives? have they never watched a good film?",1034812800,,874,4.845637583892618
7874199,3,6304584350,"""Tokyo Revelation"" is an anime that kind of shocked me. By looking at the cover, one could ask how is this anime going to be. It looks reminiscent of the popular ""Angel Sanctuary"" but after watching this anime, it actually has potential but ""Angel Sanctuary"" it is not.
This anime has occult situations, a little bit of yaoi type situations and some adult situations but the animation is quite nice and the storyline had potential but the main characters lack the emotion where one can feel sorry for them. I think that's probably because it's only a sixty minute animation. If anything, you feel more for the main character's friends who are attacked by demons.
... Pretty much the main character, Kojiro helps Akito when he was young and introduces him to the occult but Akito is happy to be back and happy to see Kojiro again but I guess he expects more of a reaction from Kojiro...especially after their hug.
Without revealing too much, I'll just say that fans of the anime X and ""Angel Sanctuary"" may enjoy this anime.
Unfortunately, this story probably needed more time to help introduce the characters and for people to actually have interest in them but that is what I found lacking in this anime.
As for the DVD, the DVd features Japanese and English tracks, subtitles and that's about it.
All in all, this anime is targeted towards fans who enjoy anime dealing with the occult and Yaoi fans may like this anime.",1030320000,4,1421,4.665338645418327
