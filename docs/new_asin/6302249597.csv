445597,5,6302249597,"I was a kid when i first saw Rituals on WOR-TV (channel 9), NYC TV in the early 80's. It was a rainy saturday afternoon and it was a horror  double feature, teamed with the classic ""Tourist Trap.""  I had seen Tourist Trap before, and loved it's eerie and creepy  atmosphere, so after it finished, i decided to see what Rituals was all about. It stuck with me for the next 30 plus years.

Of course i had seen deliverance before viewing Rituals, AND, actually read the book as well, but this was a different type of film, it carried itself uniquely, with it's own distinct atmosphere, and course. Let me express my perspective. I am often annoyed by this idea that Rituals is a copy... or a rip-off.  I believe those who use that phrase lack the ability to examine this film objectively, due to the reverence for Deliverance.  Aside from five doctors in ""Rituals"" and the four men in ""Deliverance"", and the wilderness, of course i will say that for those of you that so voraciously use the ""woods"" as such a powerful example of ""Rituals"" being a wanna-be ""Deliverance"", there isn't much similar between these two great films. At the start of Deliverance we understand the mountain-folks hostility towards Burt Reynolds and co, that much is quite clear from early on. We know whom John Voight is up against, and although there is suspense, the killers are defined. In Rituals, there is an unknown presence, that is quite enigmatic, not only do we wonder ""why"", we also yearn to know ""who"" and ""what"". Suspense in Rituals is not only coupled with terror, but it is tripled with the viewer being totally and fearfully clueless, until Holbrook and Dane speculate on their stalker, and even then we still have no idea, as to who and why.

Should i argue the ""survival"" concept? Really? Aren't most horror films about survival? The victims rising above an insane adversity and element, to live to see a brighter day. So, we should examine the whole survival theory as well. It's too simplistic to say Rituals and deliverance are connected solely on survival-horror, that's a weak, surface analysis.

Now in the context of actors and ""acting"". I will agree that Deliverance was superior in that category, ONLY because all four friends in Deliverance were superb actors, and in Rituals you only had one incredible actor.. Hal Holbrook. But, if we were to look at the caliber of Holbrook's slow building, and emotional performance in Rituals, it could be debated that he may have out-shone Reynolds, or Voight, dare yourself to examine that point. Lawerence Dane was good but not superior, but the performance of the openly gay character played by Robin Gammell is often overlooked.

Yes, the plot and storyline in Deliverance was scripted much more effectively than that in Rituals, but the plots were still quite different. The characters being doctors in Rituals, were a key part to the plot. It ties in nicely, and is in no way similar to the plot in Deliverance. In Deliverance we wondered if they were going to make it off and out of that river. In Rituals we wondered what they were up against, if and when they could make it out of the wilderness..where would they make it too? The survival factors in Rituals were numerous, in addition to the fact that the remaining men trekked by foot, they also carried a corpse, there were no canoes in Rituals.. to coast them to safety.

It is very possible that the producers and film makers of Rituals may have been influenced by Deliverance. In fact if you Rituals-bashers want to swear by that...by all means do so. Most films are influenced by others, thats just simply how it works, but to say that Rituals is a rip-off of Deliverance is an utterly, ignorant concept, that needs to be intensely re-examined.

Rituals is a brilliant, and inexcusably underrated terror-film. The suspense and atmosphere are powerfully different from those in Deliverance, and the cinematography in my opinion is superior. I have seen many Hal Holbrook films, not all of his work, but i can say this is one of his most emotional performances. The killer in Rituals, is a stalking strategic predator, and his shadows and silhouettes that are seen sporadically are enough to nurture a growing fear in us until we meet him in the film's finale. Rituals is a film who's budget was considerably lower than that of deliverance, but it is still a quite different film and an extremely effective movie, in which i always find something new and unique every time i watch it. These two films shouldn't be compared at all.. they should both be individually praised for their effectiveness, dread-looming atmospheres, and individual terror filled contextual brilliance.

I love Deliverance, it is a great film, and i have watched it numerous times. I also love Rituals and have such reverence for it as well, and own two copies of it. One unopened. Two very different films. It is Sunday evening, and i am conflicted on which one i will watch.. I think its going to be Rituals, i'll save deliverance for Monday...

For those who haven't seen Rituals, your missing a thing of greatness...

445598,5,6302249597,"Five doctors go camping and wake up the next morning discovering that their boots are gone. Unfortunately, the mysterious stranger has a deadly agenda towards the group of doctors.  This morbid person will bump them off one at a time.  The survivors are trying to figure out who is after them and why.  The final survivor will face off with the mysterious stranger when all is revealed.
  If I'm correct, this movie was made in 1976.  It was also known as ""The Creeper.""  I never heard of this movie until I read an article about it in the ""Rue Morgue"" nearly two years ago.  I was very anxious to see this movie and I'm glad I own it!  I've never seen a movie like this before and it's too bad that it is not very well known.  It's a very simple movie filmed in Canada.
  The ""Rituals"" is a slow movie, with a sense of doom.  The atypical music is not what I expect to hear but yet it works just fine in the movie.  The location is perfect: being lost in the middle of nowhere very far away from modern civilization.  A perfect setting for being trapped with no chance for help.
  You're not going to see the killer running after his victims and hacking them away.  He waits for the right moment to strike and bump off the remaining survivors; effectively shattering their level headed approach to everyday life.  They're confused, angry, and losing their patience very quickly.  The results are not good for the victims and I don't want to reveal the horrors they encounter.  You have to see for yourself what happens and I think you'll agree that the approach is much better than the common horror movies.
  This movie should not be compared to ""Deliverance"" because the approach and situation is totally different from one another.  The only similarity they have is the ""backwoods"" label.  Also, I would not recommend this movie to someone who are expecting a fast paced movie, female nudity (there are no females in this movie) or even explicit gore.  It was not needed and it did fine without any one of those typical elements found in a horror movie.
  This is an excellent 70's horror movie and for me, one of the best ""backwoods slasher"" movie ever made.  If you don't like it watching it for the first time, try again after some time pass by.  Maybe you'll like it better the second around.
  The best print version of ""Rituals"" is only from Code Red and no one else.  I believe Code Red restored the movie best as possible even though there will be some scratches on the screen.  Overall, just think of watching a print with a grindhouse style.  You can actually see what's going on compared to the videocassette version or a previous version released by another company many years ago on dvd.  For example, I couldn't see very well what the killer looked like near the end of the movie.  Thanks to Code Red, the appearance of the ugly character is loud and clear.  Also, there's an extra feature on the dvd where you can watch a somewhat interesting ""interview"" with two of the ""Rituals"" actors:  Lawrence Dand and Robin Gammell.",1304985600,13,3041,4.520220588235294

445600,5,6302249597,"The fact that I'm writing this in summer 2010, and there has never been an ""official"" DVD release of RITUALS is a bloody shame! A crime! This superb suspense-thriller is second only to DELIVERANCE in the ""survival horror"" sub-genre. The story is intense, the characters are believable, and the mysterious stalker / killer is actually frightening. Hal Holbrook (THE FOG, CREEPSHOW) is perfect as the central figure in this creeper. His odyssey is violent and ultimately tragic. A classic! I hope this will be released on disc someday, before all discs have gone the way of this VHS tape!...",1281139200,3,589,4.959595959595959
445601,5,6302249597,"Christmas has come quite early for me this year.....

I was in my early teens, maybe 12 0r 13 when i had first seen ""Rituals"" on TV.  It was a dreary saturday afternoon, and my mother and i were home together, she was studying for her Masters degree and i was turning the knob on our old color television and stopped at channel 9 WORTV in NYC.  A double feature was about to begin.....""Tourist Trap"" and ""Rituals.""  Tourist Trap was first and i thoroughly enjoyed it, but i won't talk about that early 80's classic now,  the next movie was Rituals starring Hal Holbrook, and I had never seen this one before.

The story unfolds......a bunch of doctors head to the Canadian wilderness to camp out and enjoy the nature.......but suspense and terror ensue. I haven't seen this movie in years so i cant go in depth about it, but there are some distinct memories that i have. I recall interesting characters that we got to know from some very good acting. The clearest memories i have of the film are the vast and creepy wilderness and valleys adorned with dilapidated cement ruins of what i have heard was an old dam or structure of some sort. I remember Hal Holbrook's character who tried to keep his friends alive through the strange and creepy ordeal. The most vivid images i have are towards the end where the final confrontation unfolds......some of the doctors are murdered in very cruel fashion and it seemed quite possible that something like this could happen.

I won't expose the reason why these doctors are being murdered......that part of the plot unfolds beautifully. The killer is very mysterious almost supernatural at times....we don't see him throughout the movie until the end, except for a very haunting far off shot of him in the middle of the film. On TV this movie was edited and the lighting in the finale was so dark it was a bit hard to discern what was unfolding clearly but you got enough to understand what was happening.

""Rituals"", i have heard, was given ""dog of the week"" by siskel and ebert, when it was released in theaters. This is such a great, haunting film. It has a slight bit of gore, but who needs that when the atmosphere of the film is so eerie and uncomfortable. This ,i repeat, is not a ""knock off"" of deliverance"", except in the fact that a group of men are being stalked in the wilderness. This is a horror film, no not some hollywood cheesy slasher flick that has little if any purpose. ""Rituals"" is a classic film that pulls you in....and keeps you wondering ""why?"" until the very end.

I have heard that this CODE RED release has been re-mastered and brightened in the needed places of the film, and it is uncut.....the full theatrical version. I haven't watched this film in close to 30 years, and refused to watch a horrible VHS copy or even a dvd version that comes from the VHS version...both whom i have heard come from the TV edit.

""Rituals"" is such a special fim. It is quite scary and psychological, and has some intense moments, some with violence(tastefully done by the way) and some without. Stephen King talks about this as one of his top horror films.....and it is on my top 10. I have waited impatiently for this to reach a true dvd transfer and finally as i said christmas for me starts early this year.....November 17th! !

Thanks a bunch CODE RED DVD.

445602,4,6302249597,"This is a powerful, surreal and frightening film. Like Deliverance, It's mostly about the very thin veneer of civilization. Shot in a cinema verite style, the brutality and horror seems almost documentary like, unlike Deliverance where there are practically signposts saying ""meaning here"", this film allows the horror and absurdity of itself unfold itself slyly around the edge of the frame. (consider the brilliant satire of having the surgeons chant ""take him apart! take him apart!"" as they dance around the campfire. And the eerie shot of the forest dwelling killer standing on top of the hill, a shadow against the sun.)

Wheras Deliverance was all about northern white guilt, the doctors in this film have something to be guilty about. I think ""Rituals"" is great but the film reveals it's limitations, it's lack of guts, and it's prettifying of nature. Ultimately ""Deliverance"" is a superior film.",1211155200,,904,5.149659863945578
445603,5,6302249597,"This is another of those movies that I first saw on the C.B.S. late night movies on Friday nights when I was young.  A ""Deliverance"" clone, this little Canadian thriller works very well and will keep you on the edge of your seat.

  6 friends(all Doctors) meet for their yearly retreat together and fly deep into the Canadian woods to go fishing and hiking. All of these guys have problems(drinking, homosexuality, malpractice, and apathy for their jobs) so we learn what each man's failings are. They run across some strange things, but are having a good time, till the next morning they wake up to find someone has come into the camp at night and taken all of their shoes. The man who planed the trip brought an extra pair and sets off for help, never to be seen again. The others with no shoes and dwindling and an uneasy feeling of being stalked wrap their feet up as best as they can and set off to escape the woods.

  As the fight their way out the ""person"" leaves clues that show that a doctor did not treat him very well and is now going to take it out on them,or was it one of them that messed him up. The movie is well paced and is very scary. The atmosphere is everything here and it keeps you at the edge of your seat. Hal Holbrook is the only real ""name"" star here and that helps the mood because it makes this seem more documentary than movie. Well worth your time.",1175472000,6,1380,4.264367816091954
7823283,2,6302249597,"When a group of doctors takes a trip out to the Canadian wilderness for some camping and fishing they get terror and death instead of rest and relaxation.  Someone is stalking them through the dense forest, and they are miles away from anyone that might be able to offer the slightest bit of help.

As they are killed and maimed the culprit decides to start leaving clues.  Armed with no useful knowledge despite the clues the doctors begin turning against each other taking things from bad to worse.  As they desperately try to escape the isolated wilderness they remain at the killer's mercy and drop one by one with each death becoming more gruesome.

The Creeper (AKA ""Rituals"")  is reminiscent of Deliverance  though it contains a higher body count and a few more gruesome scenes (no rape or hillbillies).  It's interesting in that the victims are a group of educated, middle-aged men rather than wild teenagers (which I guess is one reason I equate it to Deliverance).

It borders on being interesting.  The acting is better than I expected.  Hal Holbrook shines playing particularly well off Lawrence Dane.  I enjoyed their argument over whether to leave an injured man or not.  There are scenes of grown men breaking down in tears, fighting amongst themselves, pain and anguish, and soul searching that acting-wise is often done well.  I also think the general premise, isolated forest location, hiding of the killer and his motives until the very end (although the motivations and logistics themselves are ultimately weak), and other disturbing elements are largely well done.  There is definitely a feeling of tension and terror here.

This is a long way from a perfect movie. In addition to the plot problems towards the end (I won't say anything more than what I already did in the interest of avoiding spoilers) the beginning is weak as we get poorly presented character information before we know why we should care about the men talking.

A huge problem is that the poor quality (which I'll detail more in the DVD section) make it hard to follow some of the action and dialogue.  This really hurts the flow and impact of the story.  I didn't realize one guy had gotten cut until later when he was bandaging his leg, and when the killer came into view I wasn't immediately sure who he was supposed to be which steals his thunder. Its hard to fully enjoy a movie when you cant tell whats going on.

Content:
This has a fair amount of violence including a severed head, but its really quite tame for a rated R movie. Its possible that I saw an edited cut but haven't been able to find enough specific details to say for sure.

DVD:
I got it in a pack of 50 Drive-In Movie Classics. This is reformatted to pan-and-scan and is terrible in every way. The audio is messy with weird levels and lots of white noise.  Most of the sound effects sound like indistinct cracking, and the dialogue is sometimes muddled. The video is often extremely dark, contains a lot of trash, and is sometimes severely scratched up. Its so bad that it can make the movie hard to follow and makes it a chore to sit through. A Mill Creek logo pops up like a stalker to make a bad experience worse. There are no extras.

DVD editions are hard to come by but do exist. The only one that I would chance spending my money on would be the one from Code Red which reportedly has a decent transfer and at least a couple of extras. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to get my hands on one. Details on other editions are sketchy and don't look promising.

FINAL THOUGHTS:
While it has its downfalls this might be good enough to get at least 3* out of me if not for the horrendous presentation quality. It will muster a meager 2* out of me as a result. Ive got my eye out for a better edition at a reasonable price (either Code Reds DVD resurfacing or someone like Film Detective taking it on for a new edition). If I get the chance to see a better print Ill revisit this review for sure. Youre going to want to stream it or go as cheap as possible unless you know for sure you're getting quality that doesnt completely suck.",1521158400,2,4101,4.5257452574525745
7823284,3,6302249597,Have never seen this movie and decided to order based on a recommendation. Still need to watch but the box and disc seem homemade and the disc is DVD-R format.,1509235200,3,159,4.333333333333333
7823285,5,6302249597,"First things first. In order to fully and objectively review RITUALS (aka The Creeper) from 1976 one MUST drop the immediate rush to compare RITUALS and DELIVERANCE. They are two very different films which share the theme of outdoor survival of groups of men being systematically hunted by unknown assailant(s) while dealing with the realities and hardships of the natural world. However, beyond this thematic similarity RITUALS and DELIVERANCE have many extreme differences. In DELIVERANCE it is made quite apparent early in the film that Jon Voight, Burt Reynolds, Ned Beatty, etc. are being ""hunted"" by backwoods sadists. In RITUALS however, who or what is tormenting the group of 5 doctors led by Hal Holbrook, Lawrence Dane, etc. is far more mysterious, with only strange clues (such as the X-Ray sheet left behind by the antagonist, hinting that perhaps the ""hunter"" may hold a specific grudge against doctors). Throughout nearly all of RITUALS the men have no clue who is tormenting, setting traps, and causing them to one by one be either injured or killed. This question mark is compounded by the extremely hostile environment of the Canadian wilderness in which the film takes place. In many ways the environment, which ranges from the scenic beauty of the Canadian forest to the extremely barren wasteland of rock and dust that is the fire ravaged steppe, as well as a river quite similar to DELIVERANCE in rapids, gorges, waterfalls, etc., is actually at times more impressive than DELIVERANCE.
The screenplay for RITUALS is quite good with some of the dialogue being downright excellent. Despite the fact that this serious and well-made film was completely wasted by poor distribution, lack of theater play (in some cases the film wasn't shown in theaters until the 80's), it does NOT come across like a low-budget grindhouse flick, but rather a harrowing, bleak, and by the finale downright disturbing piece of filmmaking. As the film progresses and the men's morality and bonds are pushed to the limits RITUALS hits on several themes which DELIVERANCE actually fell short of. The pure desperation and conflict between one's need to help one's friends versus pure self survival is explored a bit more deeply in RITUALS. Don't get me wrong, DELIVERANCE is one of my all-time favorite films and a masterpiece, however, RITUALS proved that there was much more ripe territory to be explored in a survival drama. Especially as RITUALS deals with a group of doctors who've taken an oath to do no harm yet must make decisions under radical duress which causes them to revaluate their role as friends and men.
Which brings me to a distinct element which makes RITUALS totally different than DELIVERANCE. One CAN point to RITUALS as a film which nears the horror genre. With some of the stalking nature of the film pre-dating the ""slasher"" film, RITUALS transitions during the third act from a survival film into something much more akin to a quite brutal and unsettling horror film. At times RITUALS is truly a painful film to watch. The acting ranges from solid to outright brilliant which really makes this film stand up as a lost gem. The cinematography is at times truly astounding and there is an excellent dichotomy of large, panned shots and very tight close quarter shooting (as if the camera is traveling at knee level through tall grass.
The finale of the film is simply classic...It is everything you'd want in a film of this nature's climax. Super-tense, with the two remaining doctors facing their tormentor in an unavoidable and gruesome battle to the death. The film really holds out on revealing the identity of the hunter until the final minute or two when we learn the horrifying reality.
While not a ""gore film"" by any standard, RITUALS does contain quite a bit of extreme violence and some quite excellent gore effects. From bear traps to beheading to severed arteries to burning while alive, this film is in totality more violent than DELIVERANCE in my opinion. The harrowing ending of the film just highlights how dynamic the film truly is, crossing multiple genre boundaries and succeeding in them all. The final scene of the film is a perfect ending to a film that was totally treated unjustly when it was released in 1976. A film of the quality of RITUALS should never have been allowed to fall through the cracks...
In the end, if you go into RITUALS with an open mind, pay attention to the small details that make the film so good, and simply take the trip, I think you'll find (like myself) MUCH to enjoy and a film worthy of multiple viewings. In my opinion RITUALS deserved much more respect than it received upon its poor initial release and I'm very glad that it at least has built a strong cult following of viewers who recognize the film's quality and execution. And the film never gets easier to watch. It's always bleak, uncomfortable, and often brilliant as it depicts the testing of the limits of human mental and physical endurance and how individuals react to such unusual and unforgiving circumstances..",1498608000,2,5050,4.900700934579439
7823286,2,6302249597,"I don't have an actual copy of this movie, but I did watch the one hour and 39 minutes of the movie, which is supposed to be the full movie. Now first off, I watched the movie on YouTube. There are two versions, to my knowledge, and edited version and the full version. The video is fuzzy at best. I found the movie to be sadistic, the breakdown of civilized behavior. Also, the depth to which Hal Holbrook, his character went through to save one person was irrational. And when he finally strangled another character to put it him out of his misery I didn't even care because the movie was so very lame. I might be able to give this movie another star if the video quality had been better, but overall this movie was sadistic, depressing and just an awful way to spend some time. I honestly do not know why people like this movie so much, but then there's a lot of sick and sad stuff in movies that other people find enjoyment in.",1485561600,,931,4.265536723163842
7823287,2,6302249597,"I've been looking for this film for quite some time. I knew that it had a cult following and that many circuits like Rue Morgue gave it high acclaim. The comparisons to Deliverance furthered my interest and lo and behold, I finally got a chance to see it.

While Rituals is absolutely heavily influenced by Deliverance (it's practically a reinterpretation), the style/pace is just different enough to give it its own feel.

What I appreciated most was the utilization of the Canadian scenery/wilderness. The shifting environment and its dangers make for good visual pacing and create some atmospheric moments. There's also some decent suspense as the protagonists' situation continues to escalate over the course of the film. Unfortunately, the initial mystery regarding the killer (or, the Creeper) ultimately goes nowhere beyond a cryptic/generalized motive. Disappointing considering the time the film takes to establish the mystery/clues only to essentially forego all of that for a very simple/shoulder shrug of an ending (much the way Deliverance is rather anticlimactic).

For the most part, this is a movie about social breakdown. Several male doctors venture out for some camping only to gradually turn on one another as the unseen Creeper picks them off. From the get-go, the characters are all rather unlikable as their incessant bickering and complaining become grating. That, and all of them carry disdain for one another. As the story continues, loyalties shift as things become more dire and conversations shift into lament. I liked that the movie focused on this breakdown of guys who seemingly grew apart over time and never rid themselves of personal demons, but the movie is so stretched out/plodding with it that it becomes repetitive the nth time the group yells at one another or mopes about how everything is hopeless. Once it's down to two (lugging a third), this happens almost nonstop. The only character that I ended up liking was Henry (the gun-toting guy on the cover) and his arc is tragic and uplifting at the same time.

I understand a lot of people dig this movie (and I can see why), but for me, the movie was repetitive, not scary and far too drawn out. I found the suspense compelling as to what would befall each character (especially without the utilization of gore) , but I never found it intense or the least bit frightening. While the story could have elevated it beyond a meager slasher/Deliverance clone (sorry guys, that can't be avoided; it is), I found the story simply went where I expected it to. Again, disappointing considering the premise hinted at something so much more compelling (what with the X-rays and what not). It also should be noted that the movie becomes extremely difficult to see during the night sections as nearly nothing is lit. Thus, it's just more yelling and that's about it.

Overall, it's good for the atmosphere (the Canadian landscape is really its own character) and the initial story is interesting/suspenseful, but I found it to be merely a decent, overly long survival movie.",1469836800,,3054,5.01577909270217

IT SEEMS MOST PEOPLE WHO WERE INVOLVED IN HORROR FILMS RARELY GRANT INTERVIEWS.  HOWEVER, I CONSIDER THIS FILM A SURVIVAL/THRILLER FILM.  I'M NOT REALLY A FAN OF BLOOD, GORE & GUTS UNLESS IT IS DEEMED NECESSARY TO THE PLOT/STORY OF THE FILM.  THE DIRECTOR: PETER CARTER PASSED AWAY IN THE EARLY 80'S.  I DID READ SOMEWHERE BEFORE THIS DVD WAS RELEASED IN 2011 BY ""CODE RED DVD"" THAT THERE WAS GOING TO BE AN INTERVIEW W/ HAL HOLBROOK.  UNFORTUNATELY, THIS DIDN'T HAPPEN PROBABLY DUE TO THE PASSING OF HIS WIFE, DIXIE CARTER.  I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT.  MAYBE, IF IT'S RELEASED ON BLU-RAY BILL MIGHT ADD A FEW OTHER SURPRISES!  AN ISOLATED TRACK OF THE COMPLETE SCORE BY HAGOOD HARDY WOULD BE NICE (IF IT STILL EXISTS)!  I ALWAYS ENJOYED HIS SOUNDTRACK TO THE FILM.  HE COMPOSED/PERFORMED SOME OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PIECES OF MUSIC!  I HAVE MOST OF HIS ALBUMS ON CD!  I WISH SOMEBODY WOULD DO A BOXED SET OF HIS MUSIC.  IT'S A SHAME HE PASSED AWAY IN 1997.  THE OPENING/ENDING THEME IS A VERY SAD & REFLECTIVE PIECE OF MUSIC THAT FITS VERY WELL W/ THE FILM BEGINNING TO END!  IT WAS ORIGINALLY RELEASED IN 1976-1977 AS ""REUNION"" ON THE ALBUM ""TELL ME MY NAME"".  HOWEVER, I LIKE THE FILM VERSION BETTER!  FINALLY, I WILL ALWAYS HAVE FOND MEMORIES OF THIS FILM!  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND SEEKING THE VERSION RELEASED BY ""CODE RED DVD!""  AS I SAID ABOVE, IT'S THE BEST THE FILM IS GOING TO LOOK IN ANY FORMAT!

Holbrook gave one of his best performances in this eerie, slow burn thriller which focuses on a group of seasoned, vacationing doctors who are being stalked and viciously taken out one by one by an unseen enemy in the Canadian outback.
A survival thriller yes, but to compare it with the earlier ""Deliverance"" would be erroneous as both are unique, personally I like this film more.
One of the best and one of my favorites, it was initially released in 1977 under the title ""The Creeper"" and was produced by co-star Lawrence Dane.
Try to find the uncut version, running 100 minutes.",1434758400,2,613,4.847619047619047

7823291,4,6302249597,"Rituals is a forest survival movie, that is seems to predate the Friday the 13th films, but with a more mature audience in mind, instead of the teens that came by the truckloads to the theaters to watch the slashers of the 80's. Five men go to a camping trip, but then become followed by a stranger that isn't revealed till the end, yet this person is deadly. A great film worth watching for someone who is in mood for a film that is in the style of Deliverance.

Code Red released this film and when it dropped, a lot of people complained of the damage to the print that were VERY noticeable. I kept that in my head when I purchased it, and to my surprise, it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Sure it's clearly damaged, but the damage doesn't seem to bother me. The audio is decent enough to understand everyone (not crystal clear), and the only part that becomes difficult to see is near the end (yet that seems to be a problem that occurred way before Code Red was even involved).

This film is going for quite a bit of cash, so I suggest searching around for the right price. I got mine for 30 dollars brand new. The movie is great, and I'm happy to have it.",1399248000,,1169,4.168141592920354
7823292,4,6302249597,"This is a powerful, surreal and frightening film. Like Deliverance, It's mostly about the very thin veneer of civilization. Shot in a cinema verite style, the brutality and horror seems almost documentary like, unlike Deliverance where there are practically signposts saying ""meaning here"", this film allows the horror and absurdity of itself unfold itself slyly around the edge of the frame. (consider the brilliant satire of having the surgeons chant ""take him apart! take him apart!"" as they dance around the campfire. And the eerie shot of the forest dwelling killer standing on top of the hill, a shadow against the sun.)

Wheras Deliverance was all about northern white guilt, the doctors in this film have something to be guilty about. I think ""Rituals"" is great but the film reveals it's limitations, it's lack of guts, and it's prettifying of nature. Ultimately ""Deliverance"" is a superior film.",1391040000,,904,5.149659863945578
