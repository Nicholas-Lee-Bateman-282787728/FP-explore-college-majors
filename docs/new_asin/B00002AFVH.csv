7915456,4,B00002AFVH,"The delivery boy gives the daily newspaper to Daisy. The mailman delivers the mail. Dagwood finds his shirt and the missing sock. [Notice the large size of the cartoons.] J. C. Dithers returns from New York early, he flew rather that take the train. Dagwood surprises him! Why was the Cartwright plan changed? Alvin comments on the stuck door. The boys take a test. That salesman has a clever method to sell products. Cartwright has a clever plan to get out of the contract and blame Dagwood for it.

Baby Dumpling had a problem because of his name. Dagwood is fired over that contract. Daisy is caught and taken to the dog pound. ""What can happen next?"" Dagwood gets into a fight, Baby Dumpling plays hookey, and Daisy was adopted from the pound! There is an interesting scene at the rich man's estate. Of course there is a great misunderstanding when Dagwood climbs over a wall! There is humor from what could be a serious situation. [Melinda's walking is a subtle reference to the polio epidemics from that era.] Dagwood will get a bonus and his job back. [This must be the dream for many then, like winning the lottery.]
Note how the humor in this story overlays the grim world of business competition.",1242864000,,1206,4.635514018691588
7915457,5,B00002AFVH,"Just when the new mailman thought he had a new clever idea to deliver the mail to the Bumsteads without the letters literally becoming air mail, here comes Dagwood again!  Alvin (Danny Mummert) is back to visit his pal Baby Dumpling (Larry Simms) to exert his intelligence.  Today is Baby Dumpling's first day in school and not all goes well.  The next film in the series is BLONDIE ON A BUDGET.",1040256000,,395,4.535211267605634
7915458,5,B00002AFVH,"The ""Blondie"" features have been family favorites since 1938, and ""Blondie Brings Up Baby"" (1939) is one of the best in the series. Blondie reluctantly sends Baby Dumpling off to school, while Dagwood has troubles at the office. This episode has much more heart than the average sitcom-styled Blondie, and Penny Singleton and Arthur Lake are charming as a young married couple; in later years, the scripts became broader, and so did the performances. The ""Brings Up Baby"" script is both funny and touching, and Frank Strayer's direction strikes the right note every time. When the situation is funny, the action is very funny, and when a sentimental moment arises, the tone is sensitive (there's a memorable shot of Singleton watching Baby Dumpling walk down a long, long school corridor). Cartoon fans might be interested in seeing Grace Stafford, the voice of Woody Woodpecker, in a character role. This is a very enjoyable show, and if you like Blondie and Dagwood you shouldn't miss this one.",972950400,9,996,5.006024096385542
