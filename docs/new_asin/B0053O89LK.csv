4541676,5,B0053O89LK,"You'll love it. It's not about cougars. The name is terrible. It's a hilarious, heartfelt, joyous comedy.  After the first few episodes of season 1, it evolves into a fantastic ensemble comedy about friends in their early 40's.",1336867200,13,227,4.973684210526316

4541808,5,B0053O89LK,I love this show. The Scrubs humor is there. I quote this show all the time and no one understands. More folks need to get on the Cougar Town (the name does not represent the show!) train.,1477267200,2,188,4.108108108108108

4541810,5,B0053O89LK,"Co-created by Bill Lawrence, who wrote for ""Friends"" and other popular sitcoms and created the hugely successful ""Scrubs,"" Cougar Town is a well-written sitcom with a great cast (Courtney Cox, Christa Miller (who is also Lawrence's wife), Busy Philips, Josh Hopkins, Dan Byrd, Brian Van Holt, and Ian Gomez).  It doesn't take itself very seriously---it's a fun, witty, and mostly light-weight story about middle-aged friends with a shared interest in consuming vast quantities of red wine living on a cul-du-sac in Florida, who band together as a sort of semi-functional family.",1476662400,,578,5.351648351648351

4542067,5,B0053O89LK,Don't let the name scare you away! Even the creators are tired of the name because the show quickly evolves from Jules being a newly single cougar to her settling down a bit more and finding new beginnings in a more lasting relationship. The whole Cul de Sac crew has stolen my heart and I now can't get enough of this witty little comedy.,1400630400,,339,4.3125

Very happy with the service and dvd.",1398038400,,308,4.385964912280702
4542070,1,B0053O89LK,"Just not funny anymore, it's become almost a slapstick comedy and frankly the characters grow old with their dependancies and frankly jacked up relationship styles. It's just no longer funny to make the characters dumber and some of them meaner at the same time. Ellie should just get a divorce and call it a day.",1395273600,,313,4.709090909090909

4542074,5,B0053O89LK,"It's just funny what can I say. Great ensemble, very balanced. What Courtney Cox's character may lack in differentiation from Monica, the rest of the ensemble delivers with style. Ultimately Monica, I mean Jules, is everyone's foil.",1386028800,,232,5.297297297297297
4542075,4,B0053O89LK,"Continues to be a funny show. I understand why they cut back on episodes but am a bit bummed by it. Still, that's better than the alternative of canceling it. The friendship, wit and silliness is great. I recommend this.",1384905600,,220,4.525
4542116,5,B0053O89LK,"Love the show, love the cast, love the story line. I wish I was part of the Cul-de-sac Crew, life fail on my part.

4542119,5,B0053O89LK,I really love this series. I only wish there were more episodes per season. The whole cast is very likable and there are so many running jokes and witty one liners (especially love the Tom Cruise ones) that I'm always laughing or appreciating their dilemmas. Hopefully it stays around for awhile. There aren't that many series that I really look forward to.,1377216000,,357,4.774193548387097
4542120,1,B0053O89LK,I can only watch one episode on disc two.  The rest freeze during viewing and won't unfreeze.  Vendor policy is that you only have a month to return.  So I won't be buying from this vendor again.  A DVD should last longer than a month.,1371081600,,235,4.155555555555556

4542125,5,B0053O89LK,"I love this show and recommend that everyone watch it!  I have already turned my sister, two of my co-workers and a few guy friends onto watching it.  The cast is great together, the comedy is believable and not to sound like to big a fan, but I have made my own penny can!!!  You have to watch the show to know what I am talking about :)",1368057600,,338,3.9411764705882355
4542126,5,B0053O89LK,I think this show is hysterical. The title is completely unfitting for the show and suggests it is something that it is not.,1367452800,,124,4.434782608695652

4542131,5,B0053O89LK,I avoided this show for the longest time because of the title.  When it switched to TBS i kept seeing the commercial and decided to give it a try.  It is an excellent show!  Too bad the title turns people off.,1364774400,,209,4.048780487804878
4542132,5,B0053O89LK,Finally the 3rd season is on DVD! I am so glad that TBS picked this show up. ABC wasn't doing it justice and I'm glad it found the right home.,1364515200,,142,3.7666666666666666

4542134,4,B0053O89LK,"Funny show---I hope it's on for a few more years. I get nervous when shows move to cable. Another reviewer is right---nothing to do with Cougars.

4542217,5,B0053O89LK,"Okay so the title doesn't really make too much sense after the first season, but I can't help but love this show.  I'm so glad that Cougar Town is availble on dvd and that the show keeps coming back for more seasons!  It's slapstick with few real serious moments.  From the minds behind Scrubs (another fav of mine) it's the perfect way to un'wine'd and laugh.",1361664000,,360,4.424242424242424
4542218,5,B0053O89LK,"""Cougar Town"" is underrated by far. It's hilarious, heartfelt and even a bit over-the-top sometimes. The dialogue is smart and quippy, too, just like ""Scrubs."" I'm so happy Season Three is finally on DVD. Only bummer is the shortened season. Either way, you will fly through the season and itch for more. So, if you are a fan or curious, pick this up and enjoy...and just like the characters, it's best to enjoy a good time with a glass of wine. When in Rome!",1361491200,,459,4.476190476190476
4542219,4,B0053O89LK,"I have mixed feelings about season three.

I like that Barb Coman appears less and less. I'm not ecstatic at the growing role for Tom Gazelian.

Jules, Ellie, and Laurie continue to entertain. Travis becomes less interesting. Andy is Andy. They tried to make Bobby Cobb a bit too likable; I would have preferred if they had left him as the cheating ex with few redeeming qualities.

I like that they included a therapist for Jules, but the character of Lynn Mettler doesn't seem like it was written as well as it could have been.

Overall, if you enjoyed the first two seasons, by all means get the third!",1360281600,,605,4.522935779816514

4542222,5,B0053O89LK,I love Cougar Town!  Courtney Cox gives another hit TV show. It is funny and so relateable esp. if you are in your 40's. And I love having this on my kindle!!!  I can tuck it in my purse and be somewhere and bam!  I'm having instant fun watching this show.  Thank you Courtney!  And thank you for puttin' 'this on the kindle!,1353456000,3,325,4.095238095238095
4542223,5,B0053O89LK,"TVShowsonDVD.com just announced that Cougar Town season three will FINALLY be coming out on DVD on February 5th. Since ABC is no longer producing the series (it has moved to TBS now), Lionsgate will now be publishing the DVDs for Cougar Town (including seasons one and two).

Season three was a fantastic season (though very light on character development for Laurie). I'm very excited that it is finally coming out on DVD!

Don't forget to watch season 04 of Cougar Town when it starts in January on TBS!",1353024000,17,505,4.7272727272727275

They have to make every premiere, finale and episode before a hiatus into pure magic in order to ensure that if it's the last thing anyone remembers, the show was fulfilling. Cougar Town is a fantastic show week-to-week, but it's ""special"" episodes always take it to the next level.",1348185600,2,361,4.65625
