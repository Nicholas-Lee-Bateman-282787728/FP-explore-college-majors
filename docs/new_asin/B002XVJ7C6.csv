8383920,5,B002XVJ7C6,"I homeschooled my 3 sons years ago, all 3 graduated home school and all went on to college and graduated. When they were very small, I received Jesus Christ as my Saviour. Being a young Christian I was appalledby the cartoons on television. I did away with cable and introduced  the Hanna Barbara Greatest Adventures from the Bible, and now years later my grandchildren are enjoying these cartoons. Very Good for baby beginners.  Scripturally correct in the presentations.",1391904000,,472,5.038461538461538
