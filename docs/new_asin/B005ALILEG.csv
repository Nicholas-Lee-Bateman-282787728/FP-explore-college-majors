4641019,4,B005ALILEG,"For years, I have wanted Disney to start releasing on DVD the shows and movies that I remember seeing and growing up on in the 80s when ""The Disney Sunday Movie"", or whichever title it was going by, was on TV. I was extremely excited when I discovered that Disney had indeed opened the vault and were releasing wonderful titles on the 'Disney Generation Collection' line. How great! Maybe we will finally get more of the shows/movies/specials we have been waiting for.

""Fuzzbucket"" is a charming and whimsical tale that, even though we have seen it's kind before and probably will know exactly who it goes, doesn't fail to be charming, watchable, and takes you back to a more fun and innocent time. 12 year old Michael Gerber is starting middle school. Everyone thinks that his invisible friend, Fuzzbucket, is just Michael acting out over starting MS. How wrong they are. Fuzzbucket is real. Once he becomes visible, we see that he sort of looks like a mixture of Alf and a rat. Fuzzbucket had turned invisible because he was away from his home after midnight, which gives it a sort of ""Gremlins"" like take with it's after midnight rule. Fuzzbucket must return back home before midnight, or this time, the invisibility will be permanent.

Written and directed by the great Mick Garris, and produced by John Landis, ""Fuzzbucket"" is a simple tale in a time when that was enough. The simple pleasures of this show, as well as the others shown on Disney, are refreshing and most welcoming in an age where everything has to be high concept, high maintenance, and battling each other out to be the hippest and edgiest. There are also some familiar faces here - Joe Regalbuto(Murphy Brown), John Vernon (Animal House, Dirty Harry), as well as actresses you remember seeing growing up like Fran Ryan and Robyn Lively. One of my favorite parts of this DVD is how it also includes the original ""Disney Sunday Movie"" opening and Michael Eisner's intro the show, alongside Mickey Mouse himself. I am so glad that was included. It brought back a lot of memories.

There really isn't much else to say. ""Fuzzbucket"" is cute and charming, and will surely bring back a wave of nostalgia of a time when something like this was shown regularly on network television. Now, if this 'Disney Generation Collection' continues, maybe we can finally get Mr. Boogedy/Bride Of Boogedy, Brand New Life with Barbara Eden, Not Quite Normal with Alan Thicke, and so many others, out on DVD. Thanks, Disney. It means a lot that you have started to do this.",1339286400,7,2525,4.747152619589977
4641020,5,B005ALILEG,"My adult daughter was thrilled to find this in her stocking. I recall wonderful memories of her and her friend Casey watching this movie and loving it. And the bonus, she looked up her childhood friend just to tell her about getting the movie. AWESOME!!!!",1325721600,2,255,4.688888888888889
4641021,4,B005ALILEG,The item was packed well. I arrived on time. It was what the sell stated it was. I am very happy with this product.,1322179200,,115,3.8333333333333335
4641022,5,B005ALILEG,"I have been searching for this movie forever and am so excited to finally have it available.  I don't care if the quality winds up not being perfect.  This is a movie my kids loved when they were young.  I had recorded it from tv and the tape hasn't played in years.  This movie will bring back so many memories for all of us and I cannot wait to watch it with my 7 year old grandson!!  It is a heart-warming, wonderful story.",1316822400,,426,4.0843373493975905
4641023,4,B005ALILEG,"This tele-film is finally available purchase in this authentic, direct-from-Disney effort. Originally shown on ABC network as part of their Sunday night movies (it may have also shown on the Disney Channel), this DVD is in its original full-frame format, or approximately 1.33:1. The video is average; looks like a copy from an old VHS tape, but since this was never released here in the United States, it's hard to verify this (although it may have been released on video overseas). It is finally available, though; best of all, the original opening for the Disney Movie is just before the movie, as is the original Michael Eisner introduction of the movie. Not bad - I'd really like to see more of these 80s films available, as few were ever released for home video.",1314144000,3,768,4.7819548872180455

4641025,3,B005ALILEG,"This was our daughter's favorite show growing up.  It was on Wonderful World Of Disney if I remember right.

The show was as we remembered it but what was disappointed was the video quality.  This disc was on par of the VHS copy I have fro when i recorded the show originally.  I realize that it is an older show, this was recorded on a dvd+r, etc.. but one would think with all the technology out there, this could of been cleaned up to not look like a VHS copy.  Remastered would of been really nice, especially for how expensive it was.

Not chilled with the quality but did enjoy the movie and my daughter introduced Fuzzbucket to her kids.",1446076800,,644,4.325

4641033,5,B005ALILEG,"My wife has been talking about this movie for years wishing that our now 8 yr old some could see the film, and after years if searching I finally found it.  I also remembered the film and being huddled around the tv as a kid on Sunday nights watching the weekly Disney movie.  The movie as a product was excellent, case and DVD were as advertised and good quality. The movie as entertainment unfortunately doesn't hold up.  My wife enjoyed seeing it again but our 8 yr old was not impressed.",1394236800,,491,4.373626373626373
4641034,5,B005ALILEG,It was a surprise gift for our daughter who loved this movie as a child. Have been looking for it for a couple of years. Movie was great and service was right on time for delivery. Would recommend Amazon to all my friends and family!,1390262400,,233,4.2
4641035,3,B005ALILEG,"There aren't any special features and its a vhs quality, so its not a great DVD, but its a good DVD to add to our collection even though it was pretty expensive too. But all in all, we are still glad to have it.",1389744000,,211,3.8181818181818183

4641039,5,B005ALILEG,"My ""kids"" all in their 30""s watched this movie over and over when they were young.  Now they have kids and when I saw it on Amazon I had to get it.  The Grand kids thought it was great and my ""kids"" sat and reminisced about what they were doing 20 plus years ago when they first watched.  I think that reminder for me and watching the ""grands"" listen to their parents and aunts and uncles was MORE than worth the small price of the movie.",1379030400,,438,4.069767441860465

4641042,3,B005ALILEG,"As a kid, my brothers, sisters, and I loved this movie!  We watched it all the time, whether it was on Disney channel or on the worn out VHS tape we recorded off if tv from.  In fact we lived it so much, we had been searching for it even in out adult lives to show our children.  So you can imagine my excitement when I found our Disney was releasing it.
Alas, as an adult, the movie is not nearly as magical as I remember.  The story also end abruptly, leaving you unanswered questions.  However, it kept my 5 year old glued to it for the whole movie, so I am glad I got it.",1362355200,,575,3.9224137931034484
4641043,4,B005ALILEG,"This little show was a great memory, and especially so for my son. I only gave it a 4 star rating because the ""quality"" of the print was not the best in a couple of spots, but still well worth owning and viewing again and again.",1343779200,,228,3.9782608695652173

8463372,3,B005ALILEG,Kinda/sorta creepy film with this creature named FuzzBucket (carefully not to mix the F and B around!). He's like an ewok mixed with Minnie Mouse. Sorry to put those images into your head. He and this kid have to travel underground to his musty lair.,1500681600,,250,4.5777777777777775
8463373,2,B005ALILEG,"Weird, unpleasant creature feature for kids from Masters of Horror creator Mick Garris. That said, it has some value if you have an appetite for true oddities.",1484006400,,159,4.925925925925926
8463374,5,B005ALILEG,"Of course this movie is cheesy and makeup/effects aren't good but what else can you expect from a movie made in the 80's. With that being said, I love this movie. Reminds me of when I was a child watching it. Has cheesy humor, adventure ""through children's eyes"" but also friendships.",1484006400,,284,4.588235294117647

8463377,1,B005ALILEG,"I used to watch this as a kid. I remembered this movie being weird and creepy and when I rented it for nostalgia's sake I found that I had the same sentiments. I hate this movie! There are plot holes, bad acting, and the principal at the middle school seems like a pedophile. *shudder. It was hilarious to see my husband and son watch it. I wanted them to see it just because it is so bad that you can't believe it until you see it. My son actually jumped up and ran screaming towards me at one point in the movie when something scary/surprising happens. My dad said it was possibly the worst movie he ever saw. I can see this being played on repeat as a form of the cruelest torture in North Korea. I will probably rent it again in fifteen years when my kids will be old enough to know how bad of a movie it is.",1475193600,,812,4.049689440993789
