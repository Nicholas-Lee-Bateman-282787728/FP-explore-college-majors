2473976,5,B000CSUNBQ,This is a great series.  It is very pro Native American and Anti White America but the information is awesome.  I Love this DVD.,1329436800,4,128,4.291666666666667
2473977,5,B000CSUNBQ,"I watched this on PBS back in the 90's and was glued to the TV each night until the series was over.  Good historical account of our Native Americans and how they were lied to and cheated by our government time and time again.  If you are into history of the west, I highly recommend this one.",1283212800,5,293,4.12280701754386
2473978,1,B000CSUNBQ,"The DVDs arrived in a timely manner.  I watched the first one.  THen tried loading the second disc to watch the conclusion.  My DVD player kept saying disc error.  I removed the disc and looked at the back of it.  It had been broken and then concealed completely across the width of the disc.  Then some sort of cosmetic seal across the break.  Regardless it won't and still won't play.  I contacted the seller, and contacted Amazon.  Nothing was done, I have never heard from the seller.  I won't recommend Moviemars for anyone as they are unreliable and do not live up to the Amazon contract.  THey do not stand behind their product and this borders on deception.",1252800000,8,665,4.5508474576271185
2473979,5,B000CSUNBQ,"Whenever I try to compare ""The Way West"" with the Ken Burns series ""The West"", I'm always of two minds. On the one hand, I consider TWW to be superior in terms of entertainment; the soundtrack remains one of my favorite CDs, and stands well on its own separate from the film. I also find myself somewhat more engrossed in ""The Way West"" than ""The West"". However, from a historical perspective, I consider ""The West"" to be the better production. TW gives a broader and more balanced historical view, with more variety of speakers, than TWW. In its attempt to portray the genocide of the western Indian tribes, ""The Way West"" glosses over some important points: for example, that the Lakota were recent inhabitants of the Black Hills, having wrested it from other tribes by warfare during the 1700s...while one would get the impression from the Lakota representatives in TWW that the land was always theirs, and that they were a peaceable tribe until the Whites came. It is omissions like this which make one wonder what else wasn't being covered. On the other hand, TWW does go into more detail of the fight for the Black Hills than ""The West"" could, because of time constraints. Both are strong in their own ways, and well worth owning.

(Review based on the VHS release, will revise if needed when TWW DVD becomes available.)",1252454400,41,1326,4.7155172413793105
8102146,5,B000CSUNBQ,"I've seen very mixed reviews on here, with most of them complaining about how ""dark"" it was.  First off, guess what?  Your America, my America, who we were and who we are, IS very dark.  It's not a pleasant history, and most of us are too afraid to face the truth that this nation was built on racism, lies, theft, and violence.  I get it; it's hard to face.  However as someone with a degree in history, I found this documentary not only dark, but necessary.  Most people get their impressions of the 19th century West from Hollywood westerns, and if you wish to remain ignorant, perhaps you should go watch a John Wayne film.  If, however, you want to learn the things that we did that you were never taught in grade school about the West, then I cannot recommend this series highly enough.  A lot of it is told from the perspective of Native Americans; to me, that makes sense, as they were the original inhabitants and were the most populous race in that region until the post-Civil War era.  Don't get me wrong, Ken Burns' ""The West"" series is solid too, but at times it shies away from the horrific, genocidal moments of this period of American history that this documentary does not.  Brace yourself, but please pull up a chair and watch this.  You may not be so proud to be an American after watching this, but I feel that a hard truth is better than an easy lie.",1524009600,,1371,4.379446640316205

8102148,4,B000CSUNBQ,"Rather dim view of our history but expected as much from PBS. Otherwise well worth a viewing if you already know history , if you don't ,I'm afraid,this series will sour you on our great nation.",1510531200,,194,4.416666666666667

8102151,3,B000CSUNBQ,"Well, one can say that if you have watched this series, you would not come away feeling ""entertained"" at all. You would come away feeling a ""punch"" to the gut, especially if any of you had relatives in this time period living in the USA. It primarily gives a one view ""perspective"" of the years before and after the US Civil War between the Southern States and the Northern States.
After the Victory of the US, not only did the new President Ulysses S. Grant have to deal with a defeated South and reconstruction, he had to deal with ""the Indian problem"" as was described by most of the Government at that time.
After Thomas Jefferson got the ""Louisiana Purchase"" from Napoleon and France in 1803, the US knew it had basically doubled it's land size. What they didn't know was that ""native"" peoples were already living on that land. The ""Lewis and Clark Expedition"" deals with that in another well done documentary.
Even in the years of President Andrew Jackson, the states surrounding ""areas"" known to be ""Indian land"" were contested and were not recognized.
So, here we had the ""Trail of Tears"" as is described in those years, way before the Civil War started.
As to this program itself, it was pretty well viewed and known by most living in the time period between 1840 and 1890 that the expansion of the West was inevitable at some point.
It's a fairly decent program told mostly from the Native point of view. In my opinion, after watching this in it's entirety, it seems that some details may have been left out.
For me, was the FACT that they never mention the Mexican Government taking huge swaths of land from THEM on the West Coast. Now, I wonder why that is? The Native Americans living on that land before 1840s were not living on THEIR land, technically, since Mexico claimed it as theirs.
IT'S NEVER MENTIONED and the FACT that other Nations had laid claim to the land even before White Americans came West. Spain, France and Russia (the territory known as Alaska). NO MENTION OF THAT, EITHER.
Here, we have at least three Native American descendants talk about how their people were murdered and run off their land. Yeah, I can say they were not treated well, at all, and I am a white male born in 1966 in Los Angeles.
The narrators never mention the fact that many of these Native Indians were savages as well and killed, maimed hundreds of settlers with cruelty to the extreme. Scalping, cutting up the bodies of women and children as well. The narrators never mention that fact, either. It's all one sided.
So, the murder and blood was on BOTH SIDES. Some tribes of Native Americans were to blame, not saying all did, but all settlers were not there to kill the Indians, either.
Did General Custer act on his own at Little Big Horn? Most likely, yes, and without official orders to attack a Native American encampment that was not looking for trouble or to start anything. He did not know the amount of Indians there and paid the price when his troops, numbering just over 250 total, got outnumbered and killed. It was in all purposes a fatal blunder that cost lives. The US Army would not forget this incident and remains one of the most brutal in Army history. The other known incident that goes down as brutal, is the one at ""Wounded Knee"", where at least 146 Native Americans in all, were shot to death by an itchy trigger finger Army watching the captured Crazy Horse. After resisting, he was bayonetted several times and died by troops. The other Natives at some point outside became agitated, how, they got guns is uncertain, but one of them had one, raised it, the gun went off and he threw dust in the air. Well, to the Army troops, this was a signal to attack in some form. The Union troops opened fire with guns and artillery used in the Civil War. Many died in the first volley of fire, and the remaining Indians there split up and ran for their lives. They didn't get far as they were mowed down by hails of bullets flying all over the place. No one was exempt.
The bodies were later recovered after a blizzard snow storm came through on a ""death detail"". The bodies of the Native Americans were recovered and placed in one mass grave, so this program says.
""Sitting Bull"", having been killed in an earlier incident was placed in his own grave in a modest pine box, I am certain, with a grave marker.
The program is one sided pretty much. If you want a more detailed view of those years, you may want to get the Ken Burns ""The West"". But, it is good to have both of these programs, as I think it is more well rounded if you see both sides, not just from 3 Native Americans and a few ""historians"".
There are 4 Episodes, on 2 DVDs. It is lengthy, with each playing about 1 hour and a half.
No other special features here, just the programs themselves.",1478995200,3,4780,4.47651775486827
8102152,1,B000CSUNBQ,"Very very negative commentary  against the white settlers moving across the nation to the West. The very opening lines are from a woman who is suppose to be depicting an Indian saying she ""hears women weeping, her men have been shot by white people"". The narrator continuously makes negative comments against the settlers. In fact - the settlers were hard working farmers and other families wanting a new life in the west, they were not making the arduous journey across the plains to attack Indians !! If you are wanting to watch a documentary with interesting stories about what it was like for the pioneers to travel to the West I would keep looking, this is more of an unfortunate very negative commentary.",1468800000,7,710,4.772357723577236

8102154,2,B000CSUNBQ,This dvd is very focused on Indian life and loss.  I came away feeling a little guilty . I had expected more history on famous Western outlaws and characters. This was not the case. The title and description of dvd are somewhat misleading.,1440374400,6,239,4.558139534883721
