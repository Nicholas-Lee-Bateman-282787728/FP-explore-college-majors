The main thing that I don't like about it is that it's not the most user friendly program, ready for plug 'n play. Don't get me wrong, it's also definitely not the hardest but they incrementally improve on that aspect with each new version. I haven't spent too much time with it so far but the stuff I've learned about the virtual instruments and the like has made it very helpful in the mean time. In the end, this product has more value than I realized, and will continue to realize, so give it a try.",1334275200,9,620,4.353448275862069
