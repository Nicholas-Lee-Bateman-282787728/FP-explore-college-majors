2152034,5,B0002Z3NNE,"Ebola Syndrome

directed by Herman Yau

1996, ?? mins

Back when I got really interested in horror/gore movies (I'd always loved horror, but when I was a kid I couldn't stomach those hardcore movies), I read a lot about which were the most gruesome ones around, and along with the Guinea Pig series, Men Behind The Sun, August Underground's Mordum, and Sal, Ebola Syndrome was always mentioned as one of the most extreme movies ever (along with some other Wong/Yau movies, such as Bunman: The Untold Story). Therefore, I couldn't believe my luck when I came across this DVD here in Holland. I, of course, immediately bought it, and watched it that very night. I'd been expecting a lot, but Ebola Syndrome turned out to be quite something different than what I'd heard.

---minor spoilers---

Sure, it was extreme, bloody, gory, politically incorrect, definitely, but above all, I laughed my 'rse off. Anthony Wong portrays Ah Kai, the ultimate loser. He makes out with his boss's wife, but when the two get caught, and the woman blames Kai for assaulting her, the boss and his servant start beating up Kai. Kai goes crazy and kills the servant, the boss, and the boss's wife. After being walked in on when he's trying to set the boss's daughter on fire, Kai flees. Next scenery: South Africa. Kai now works in a burger restaurant, and he's still the loser he ever was. However, the daughter of the boss he killed back in Hong Kong accidentily visits the restaurants and recognises him, after which she warns the police. But of course, they do nothing.

On a field trip with his boss (when they're out to buy some pigs), Kai rapes some woman who is just dying of ebola, and thus Kai gets infected. However, after experiencing some severe sickness, Kai heals magically. Apparently, he is immune, although he now is a carrier of the ebola virus. Kai goes on a rampage again, and now he rapes his boss's wife (who constantly insults him). His boss walks in on them (dja-vu) and, surprise, Kai kills both of them. The boss's cousin comes around too and Kai kills him as well. After having slaughtered all of them, he makes them into burgers. However, the burgers have the ebola virus in them and half of South Africa is soon ebola infected. Kai has, in the meantime, stolen the boss's money and is off to Hong Kong again. There the police do start hunting Kai and it all ends in some bloody and farfetched scenes.

---end of spoilers---

Despite 'Ebola Syndrome' being terribly funny (I've seen it several times now and still love it), it's also very extreme, very graphic, and very nasty. The gore scenes look quite fake, but are sometimes gut-wrenching (mainly the autopsy). Some animal slaughter scenes are also featured, one in which some frogs get cut up (for a meal), and one where a couple of chickens are beheaded for the sake of some tribe-ritual (during the trip to the jungle). These scenes are 100% real and hard to stomach for most people. I found those scenes a bit too much and quite cruel, since I am a vegetarian myself, but this movie is still great. Don't watch it though if you are quickly offended or shocked. Rape, gore, murder, it's all there. Wow.

2152035,3,B0002Z3NNE,"Ebola Syndrome (Herman Yau, 1996)
This, I am ashamed to say, was my first exposure to the wonderful world of Cat III Hong Kong cinema. I sat there for the whole movie saying ""wow, I didn't know Joe D'Amato had moved to Hong Kong.""
The movie opens with the seemingly mentally slow Ah Kai (Cat III fixture Anthony Wong, last seen on these shores in Black Mask) having, erm, relations with the boss' wife. When the boss walks in on them, hilarity ensues. Kai ends up slaughtering the family, with the exception of the daughter (once again, he gets walked in on), and fleeing to South Africa. (Not a spoiler. We're five minutes into the movie.)
Kai has become a waiter in a popular Chinese restaurant in South Africa. If anything, he's gotten slower. His misanthropic tendencies have been honed to razor-sharpness by the treatment he receives from the boss (kung-fu flick veteran Meng Lo, recently in the third installment of Sex and Zen) and his wife. One day, while off buying meat in zulu country, through a series of events best left to the reader's imagination, Kai contracts ebola. He is, however, one of those rare people who will survive the disease and become a carrier...
Everything about this movie can be summed up in the word ""nasty,"" the same way it can with Joe D'Amato joints. Yau (The Untold Story), however, keeps things on the up side of D'Amato with a grisly sense of humor that pops up just when it's needed. As with most exploitation flicks of this sort, the plot is bone-thin and often transparent, the acting is average at best, and the camerawork is nothing special. It's a fun little movie if you have a really strong stomach, but not something you could hold up as a shining example of the genre... I hope. ***",1089158400,,1733,4.593548387096774
2152036,2,B0002Z3NNE,"i have seen this movie on dvd and frankly i don't understand why people are calling this movie sick. honestly there is nothing shocking or gory. if you are around 15 yo, than yes buy it and youl will find it interesting. people over 15 should think twice. it is pure waste of time.",1047600000,,281,4.222222222222222
2152037,3,B0002Z3NNE,"Before I watched this film, one of my friends stated that it's ""as nasty and low as a movie can possibly be.  Nothing will shock you after you see this.""  Well, he was right.  In this flick, Anthony Wong, portraying a sick restaurant owner, turns his back to all of today's morals and taboos as he performs actions that cause him to catch and spread the Ebola virus.  For instance, in one scene, he first rapes an innocent woman, promptly kills her, then saws her to bits, grinds her up into hamburger meat, then feeds the meat to the customers in his restaurant.  And that's certainly not the only example of low morale!  When the spread of the virus is eventually connected to him, Anthony first realizes that he has Ebola in his system, and then uses it as a threat to all who attempt to catch him (as he cuts holes in his arms and spits the blood out to those who don't heed his warning, thus infecting them).  Several intricate fighting sequences and fast action accompany the stomach-churning sequences, providing much-needed distraction.  Admittedly, this movie satisfies the cravings that many have for the complete indulgence of one's cravings, regardless of the consequences brought about and the rules broken.  Even those who declare this movie to be unfit to watch and forbid their children to ever set eyes upon it will still get a guilty pleasure out of the observation of the utter sickness of Wong's actions.  Also, like in most famous Hong Kong action movies, the lightning-quick, dazzling action sequences will leave you mesmerized.  Still, after the movie's conclusion, you will find yourself having trouble eating and sleeping every so often as the more graphic, gory scenes pay a quick visit to your memory.  They're easy to brush off, but unpleasant nonetheless.  However, they will fade sooner or later, making Ebola an experience to remember, but not repeat.",994118400,7,1882,4.84375

2152039,5,B0002Z3NNE,"This movie is one of the greatest asian horror films ever made. Anthony Wong is wildy entertaining.

This movie is about a man that is working in South Africa in a local Asian resturant. The owner's girlfriend is constantly nagging and insulting him, While on a trip through the African wilds in search of a pig for sale, Anthony Wongs character decides to fool around with a local tribe woman. What he dosent know is that she is infected with the horrible Ebola Syndrome. He does not find out until after the fact. But luckily for him, He is immune to this particular disease. HE recovers quickly, But he continues to spread the virus to that comes in contact with him. Through his urine, saliva, blood, semen he spreads the virus to  many people. Once the public becomes aware of this syndrome, There is an attempt by the police to capture him for murder and to stop the spread of the Ebola syndrome.

This film is very similar to the director's previous film ""The Untold Story"", Mostly because of the use of the same actor and the subject matter of using people for food. An excellent film that should be seen by fans of hardcore asian cinema!

2152040,4,B0002Z3NNE,"Back in 1986 Hong Kong, Kai Sang (Anthony Wong) was caught having sex with the wife of his boss and starts to murder them. 10 years later he is working in a Chinese restraunt in South Africa, one day he buys some meat from a local African tribe and rapes a sick native woman on his way to work. He suddenly gets infected by the Ebola virus but it doesn't kill him as he becomes a carrier of the virus, he goes mad as he butchers some people to make them into special hamburgers that satisifies the costumers cravings. Unknown to them, the burgers are also contaminated with Ebola and soon Sang goes back to Hong Kong after he has found his boss's hidden money pile. Now he starts to spread the virus to some people in the city and the police with the contamination unit are on his trail.

Entertaining and gory horror comedy from director Herman Yau who made the infamous Hong Kong extreme horror cult fave ""The Untold Story"" as this was a nice follow-up to his disgusting masterpiece. While not as over the top as the other film but it does offer plenty of good gore such as skin ripping, cannibalism, eye gouging and others including some sleaze abound, there is some eye pleasingly beautiful Asian girls in this movie.  It does have some dark humor to spice up the film with a dark sense of atmosphere, i recommend this to fans of horror comedies and Asian cinema.

This DVD contains excellent picture and sound with the original Cantonese Language with accurate Subtitles with some fine extras like trailers to this and other titles, audio commentary, an interview with the director and Deleted Scenes.

2152041,5,B0002Z3NNE,"Because Herman Yau & Anthony Wong are at it again!!!!
The team responsible for ""The Untold Story"" are back in the kitchen.
And this time, they're cooking up human pork buns in South Africa.
The only difference is these Pork Buns are chock full of the Ebola Virus!!!

Pretty much the same premise as ""The Untold Story""
but without the police investigation angle, and twice the mayhem.
While ""The Untold Story"" was a more frightening, more believable story,
Ebola Syndrome is much more fun.
It has twice the amount of depravities as ""Untold Story""
though they're not as viscious.
That was until I discovered that 99% of the deleted scenes were extended gore scenes. (Much like The Untold Story, the actual violence tends to take place offscreen)
I was a little upset to say the least.
You still get to see all the carnage taking place onscreen,
which is grotesquely beatiful
dont't get me wrong,
but the camera doesn't dwell nearly as long as it should,
which you'll see quite clearly in the deleted scenes.
Each gore scene was supposed to be a a few seconds longer.
In fact,
one scene involving a chewed eye-ball was missing entirely.
So in all honesty you might want to find a different version.
(if there is one, which I'm pretty sure there isn't)
Despite the fact that this version is alledgedly unrated.

SYNOPSIS:(With almost no spoilers)
Kai gets caught in the act with his boss's wife.
His boss, furious, beats Kai about the apartment,
This confrontation ends in a triple homicide,
with their daughter as the only witness.

12 years later, Kai is working in a kitchen in South Africa,
for a frugal businesman, who, to save a little money,
decides to buy his pork from an african tribe infected with the Ebola Virus.
During their excursion Kai becomes infected, but as it turns out,
he's one of 10 million who are immune to the virus,
which makes him a carrier.
Which means anyone coming in contact with any of his bodily fluid is infected.
When they return to work, ownership of the restaurant, violently changes hands.
And the previous owners are now on the menu.
But someone recognizes Kai
remembers him from Hong Kong,
remembers what he did.

Half the movie is spoken in Chinese,
& the other half is spoken in bad english,
Which makes for quite an unintentionally hilarious combination.
It's painfully obvious that the director doesn't speak english.
Because every actor not speaking chinese, was just downright awful,
pure cardboard, like they were reading lines off an intelligible cue-card.
Their acting, to say the least, seemed out of place.
Anthony Wong however was great, in a gross kind of way.

The Depravities include:
- a severed tongue,
- ebola rape
- decapitaion
- mutilation
- cannibalism
- toothpicks to the eye
- facial urination
- porkchop masturbation
- chewed eye-ball
- child murder
etc, etc.

MORAL OF THE STORY:
If you can't beat 'em.........
cut 'em up, and turn 'em into pork-buns.",1203897600,4,2914,4.783300198807157
2152042,5,B0002Z3NNE,"Definitely one of my favorites of it's kind, this is one of the best Cat3 film's out there, and that's saying alot. The story is about a viscious killer who gets infected by the ebola virus after raping a girl, then spreads the virus in South Africa and Hong Kong causing people to convulse (oozing with bodily fluids) in violent seizures. There are some really great special effect's (one scene evern reminded me of the Guini Pig series), eyeball's being sucked out, private area's being stabbed, autopsy's, some unforgiving rape scenes, and really good production values. Fans of Untold story should check this out, Anthony Wongs' performance is brilliant as usual. Highly recommended to fans of bad-a** cinema.

2152043,2,B0002Z3NNE,"Ebola Syndrome is for the die-hard exploitation movies fans who like gratuitous violence and sick fun of such films. Herman Yau, the director of this masterpiece, previously worked with Danny Lee on the set of The Untold Story and took two things from that film into his new opus. First - lots of gore, second - Anthony Wong, who brilliantly managed the role of a psycho killer as well as in The Untold Story. Actually Anthony Wong is the only worthwhile reason to see Ebola Syndrome, he plays one of the most deranged characters that I've seen in movies. All other aspects of this film - whether it's cinematography or story-line are just stupid. But you may still like it if you enjoy sleazy flicks. After all it's funny to a certain extent.

Kai is sleeping with his boss's wife. Being caught red-handed and bullied by the boss he goes completely nuts (as he already was mentally unstable as it seems), kills both his mistress and her husband and flees Hong Kong. He finds himself in South Africa, working in a restaurant. One day he rapes a Zulu girl who obviously was ebola infected and contracts this lethal desease. But he turns out to be one in a million that can spread it without getting sick himself. So the epidemic starts.

Gorehounds will find everything for their pleasure here: blood, killings, dismemberment, rape, lots of nudity, frog vivisection, masturbation with meat chunks, grisly deaths etc. As I said Ebola Syndrome is very stupid, and the second star goes only for Herman Yau's ability to compile all these exploitation attributes in one place, because at first this task seems impossible - you'll literally find anything to your liking here. And if it's more important to you than a story-line and common sense, you'll enjoy this piece immensely.",1172793600,,1773,4.790849673202614
2152044,5,B0002Z3NNE,"The Untold Story starring Anthony Wong and directed by Herman Yau is one of my top favorite movies.  I was researching more Anthony Wong movies and found this one.

I sometimes start to think I have uncovered all the great movies there are but I have found a true gem when I watched this with low expectations (due to another Amazon review stating how cut it was and thinking this would be more of a drama on the ebola virus).

We have Anothony Wong back again and he is basically the same character as he is in the Untold Story.  He is a psycho restaurant worker who kills those who enrage him and end up being served to the patrons.

In this story, Anthony Wong is Kai the restaurant worker who is always complaining to himself about ""being bullied"" by everyone he encounters and eventually kills three people.  This time he goes to South Africa before he gets caught.

In Africa, he does a whole lot more complaining to himself about ""being bullied"" until he kills again.  Yet again, Kai goes on a killing rampage and his victims are served as tasty ""African Burgers"".  But only after going on a pig shopping trip for the restaurant where he rapes a dying African woman infected with ebola.

Kai however is a one in 10 million type who can become a carrier of ebola but doesn't die from it.

He soon realizes his new crimes will be discovered and escapes back to Hong Kong (10 years after leaving).  Of course, his deviant lifestyle and various altercations start him spreading his disease and leaving a trail of victims.

This is all as intense as it was in the Untold Story and constantly had me laughing as well.  It may even be a little more fun than Untold Story as it has more of an adventure than Untold Story.

There are plenty of scenes of Kai's misuse of meat and extreme violence that will make this a new favorite with you as well.

There is another review here that discouraged my from seeing this movie further.  I believe this review is wrong.  If there is more to see, I certainly agree that all should be shown but this movie is excellent and pretty severe throughout.  It does not appear to have the intense content cut-out.  If so, I of course, would like to see what was cut out, but there is plenty exceptional content left.  Some research on my part and the stated research of the other reviewer indicates probably 3 minutes is missing and is missing due to it no longer being in existense rather than censored for this version.

I don't believe this is anywhere near as known as 'the Untold Story'.  If you found this movie while searching for movies similar to it as I was and I believe will probably be the case with others as well, don't worry about the bad review here, this is a great movie and almost like having 2 more hours of Untold Story to watch.",1169424000,4,2783,4.403131115459883
2152045,4,B0002Z3NNE,"I have no frame of reference as to how much this film was cut from the actually originally HK release. However after doing some serious research, I have come to the conclusion that this film is only missing 3 minutes from the original disease infested masterpiece. It appears that all current DVD versions of this film came from the same print (which is actually the only print known to be in existence). Therefore, this is the best version any of us are likely to ever have the pleasure of viewing...

That being said, I found this film to be incredibly entertaining and highly amusing. Once again, director Herman Yau and Cat III Master, Anthony Wong have teamed up for an exploitative winner. The first film I had the pleasure of viewing from this winning team was the amazing 'The Untold Story'. That film was based on a true story and was much more serious in tone. This little gem was much more exploitative and over-the-top...

I absolutely love the plot of this masterpiece. The movie starts out with a bang (literally). Anthony Wong is caught having sex with his bosses wife. He then quickly and violently dispenses with both of them. Now of course he needs to disappear so he heads to South Africa where he obtains work in a filthy restaurant. The price of meat becomes too much for him and his boss to handle so they head into the bush to acquire some 'bush-meat'. On the way back to the city he rapes one of the natives. This woman happened to have the Ebola Virus...

Luckily for us, Mr. Wong is a rare one-in-a-million case of individual who will carry the Ebola Virus without succumbing to it's terrible deadly side-effects. The rest of the film is a joy to watch as Mr. Wong careless spreads the disease to the terrified populations of South Africa and Hong Kong in various entertaining ways...

Anthony Wong is pitch perfect as the perverted psychopath and Herman Yau once again provides the deft direction needed to please use gore & sleaze fiends...

I don't want to give away too much of the plot (like it matters), but as a fan of sleaze, explotation, and gratuitous entertainment I can wholeheartedly reccomend this sweet little film. If you are a fan of wonderful Cat III filth directly from Hong Kong, the 'Ebola Syndrome' does not disapoint....",1168992000,8,2269,4.648379052369077

Much nudity, gallons of blood and guts, the same chopping up of bodies in a restaurant and selling them as entries to the customers as TUS.  The big difference of course is that Wong is a carrier of the ebola virus so everybody starts dying from that in some incredible gory and sick vomit inducing scenes.

Movie Review: This movie has been in my head for years. I wanted to see it but parts of me didn't. I don't know why. Now that I have seen it, I got to say this is a great movie. It is very sick and twisted with plenty of T&A, sex, blood and gore and yet it doesn't feel like it's overdone. The story is different and innovative especially for a Chinese movie about a sociopath raping and killing people and spreading Ebola all over Hong Kong. And to point out one more thing: I never really thought much of Anthony Wong. My exposure to him was House Of Fury (fruity), Heroic Trio and Hard Boiled. But because of this film and Taxi Hunter I'm starting to develop a fondness for Anthony Wong. Now I look forward to more Anthony Wong films (except any sissy romance drama; up yours).
