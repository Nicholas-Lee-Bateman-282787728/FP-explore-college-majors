7801006,4,1890228249,"I got ""Ninku The Movie"" as a dual feature with ""Yu Yu Hakusho The Movie"" released by AnimeWorks. The run time of each movie (according to the box) is 60 minutes, but it is still the same movie. I guess this is the edited version and I got the uncut version or the box lied about it being the length of each instead of total. Either way, it's still too short for my tastes, even if at an hour in length, because it flies by!

The fight scenes are very well done, even though no real weapons are used (I'm into sharp, pointy items that shine :P). There is a lot of detail used in making the special moves and their effects. I didn't feel cheated at all, even without any samurai swords.

As well known as the Ninku are, no one ever recognizes them! Fame and fortune don't always go together as they are often searching for ways to get food and money.

Fusuke may look a lot like a child with a blank expression, but he had been the captain of the first Ninku division. In the movie I have, he shows himself to be a very thoughtful, generous, loyal, and level-headed guy; what you'd expect in a leader. I found myself laughing AT him more than once during the movie and wondered how HE could possibly be a former captain. I didn't have any doubts once the fight scene truely started. He becomes very serious and the vibe you get from him changes.

Touji was a captain for the sixth division of Ninku. In the movie he seems to be Rihoko's brother. I was shocked at first to see him tear off his clothes to fight in his underwear, but it became comical.

Aicho was a captain of the nineth division of Ninku. Rihoko has a huge crush on him and he does about all he can to stay away from her.

Rihoko doesn't fight, she just tags along with the guys (I'm pretty sure she is in fact Touji's sister). I think her main role is comical relief and to be the occasional damsel in distress, but I like her sometimes bossy character.

The penguin is named Hiroyuki. He is very intelligent. Unfortunely, he also tends to have really bad gas. Poor Fusuke seemingly faints when Hiroyuki farts on him in the movie. Immature humor? Sure, but it's still funny to me. It isn't overdone or used in bad taste, so I don't have a problem with it. I'm sure it's an effective move in a fight.",1144713600,3,2264,4.238979118329467
7801007,5,1890228249,"So what that it's 24 minutes long. It's Awesome. And when I say awesome, I mean it's funny in a japanese way and the animation for the fight sequences is some of the best I've seen in anime. Animation is somewhere along the lines of Ninja Scroll meets Cowboy Bebop meets the animation from Kill Bill. For what it is, it stands with the best I've seen.",1125964800,2,351,4.253731343283582

7801009,4,1890228249,"This being my first time ever even hearing of Ninku, i was pretty impressed.  From the start the characters are very likeable.  As far as story goes, it was alright, but the elements the anime itself drew me in pretty fast.  Such as thier Ninku fighting styles, and them being of the well know ninku clan, but yet no one knows them and they're always looking for food and money.  All in all it was very refreshing, though i recomend seeing the series first, or at least reading on Ninku before jumping into the movie.  Ja ne!",987206400,2,525,4.371134020618556
