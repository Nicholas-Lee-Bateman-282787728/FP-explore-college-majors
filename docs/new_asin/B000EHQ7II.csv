They say Jaws is based off this incident, but this movie is sort of based on Jaws, but not scary really - not that I watched it to be scared.

I would definately recommend this to anyone and I think it is a great companion to go w/ Jaws, I think you can see a lot of similarities in the story.",1407196800,,514,3.849056603773585

2518762,4,B000EHQ7II,This is a good movie to watch about the events that happeded that summer. My son has become more interested in Historical events and this one he found very interesting.  Although it is a movie I found most of it to be very true to the actual events that he and I have read about those 12 days. Both of my children ages 11 and 7 enjoyed watching it and so did I. Good movie for the price.,1398297600,,387,3.9615384615384617

2518767,4,B000EHQ7II,"Interesting since it was based on (loosely maybe) a series of real events. A little low budget, not totally historically accurate but considering they were trying to tell it as a story in a 2 hour TV movie, it's entertaining enough. I've always heard these were the attacks that gave Peter Benchley the idea for ""Jaws"", so I like to watch the 2 back to back.",1377388800,,358,4.4393939393939394

2518769,4,B000EHQ7II,Really well done recounting the true events.  To my recollection it followed the book very closely -- An amazing story.  My only critique is that main actor while very likable was a little stiff.,1372204800,,195,4.705882352941177
2518770,5,B000EHQ7II,"Although I have never heard of this video, I have often heard the story it is based on. I am not familiar with the actors in this docu-drama, but they were all excellent, the costumes and sets were accurate, and the movie itself was very believable and authentic. I am a ""Jaws"" fan and I loved the book and movie, but they are no comparison to this. ""12 Days Of Terror"" was tastefully done, accurate, realistic and plausible. The portrayals of the shark were not obviously phony or ""villainistic"", just a big fish doing what it normally does. Which only made it that much more credible. In short, this is an EXCELLENT video. If you are a shark fan, you will want to see this!!!",1371772800,,677,4.424

2518772,4,B000EHQ7II,"Like many others, I've seen Jaws, Jaws 2, and many other shark movies.  The truth is, almost all of these movies are unrealistic and we may or may not know it.  This dvd, 12 Days of Terror, is a docudrama about an actual event that occurred around 1916 by the New Jersey coast in which 5 shark attacks occurred around the space of 12 days and 4 of the 5 attacks were fatal.  These events inspired the novel Jaws which of course inspired the movie Jaws.  So indirectly, this movie about the actual events inspired the top selling fictional account of a great white shark terrorizing a beach community around New York.  I find this account more realistic and more believable.  In fact, the only parts of the movie that are fictional are the main character and his friend the boat captain. Those fictional characters connect the 5 actual shark attacks, but the depiction of those actual attacks is very realistic.",1362960000,,910,4.62111801242236
2518773,3,B000EHQ7II,It was omay. Just very dry for a shark attack movie that was based on a true story. Acting was B movie quality.,1354233600,,111,3.869565217391304
2518774,4,B000EHQ7II,"I liked the movie, but for a person obsessed with Great Whites and the shark attacks of 1916 I was annoyed with the historical inaccuracies. It was not so terrible that I could not enjoy the movie, especially once I forced myself to except the movie as a piece of entertainment with literary license. Colin Egglesfield (I hoped I spelled that right!) was excellent and quite handsome as the hero!
Side note: the most accurate movie (or documentary) about the 1916 attacks I have seen is ""Blood in the Water."" It is on the shark week 25th anniversary DVD.",1351468800,,554,4.606060606060606
2518775,4,B000EHQ7II,"12 Days of Terror is based on an acutal series of shark attacks, but is hardly a documentary.  Fictional charaters are added to tie everything together, and while some of the incidents shown are exactly as they were said to have occured, others are pure make-believe.  There is still debate as to the shark involved in the attacks, a great white or a bull.  At least in the extra material they mention this, as well as the possiblity that two sharks were to blame, one in the ocean, one in the creek.  If not taken as a litral account of what happened this is good, although certainly not great, movie.",1333584000,,602,4.445454545454545
2518786,4,B000EHQ7II,i enjoyed this movie. i thought it would be scary but it did not terrorize me or keep me awake after i watched it. it was based on true events that happened in the early 1900's about some shark attacks that happened in the east coast. the characters were played well by colin egglesfield & john rhys-davies.,1312675200,,307,4.4035087719298245
2518787,4,B000EHQ7II,"In 1916, NJ was plagued by a series of attacks by an unknown shark (the movie says its a Great White) where 4 people were killed with 1 surviving the attack. The chaos lasted 12 days before the shark was suposively caught (to which no one knows if it was the shark). This real life incident was the inspiration for the novel (but more remembered for the movie) ""Jaws"".

Now this was a low budget movie, with a cast of mainly unknowns. Cheap gore but overall its a pretty good movie. It was very interesting to know what happened in those fatefull 12 days. I would reconmend this movie for any person who loves to watch a movie based on actual events or shark movies in general.",1287532800,,677,4.330708661417323
2518788,5,B000EHQ7II,"This is a TERRIFIC shark movie -- one of the best I've seen yet, coming in second to ""Jaws"".  It captures the time, people and shark attacks of 1916 in New Jersey, except it takes place at one location (Matawan Creek) instead of three different places along the Jersey shore.  Other than that, it is great!  The setting and costumes look authentic and take you back in time, reminescent of Boardwalk Empire.  I highly recommend this movie for anyone that studies sharks.  I just finished reading Close to Shore, the book by Michael Capuzzo depicting the New Jersey shark attacks of 1916.  My next read will be the book in which this movie, 12 Days of Terror, was based as the movie was exceptional, especially considering how badly made and written the movies on shark attacks generally are.  You won't be disappointed; any shark-lover will enjoy it.",1275868800,,850,4.741496598639456

2518791,2,B000EHQ7II,"Ok, so this is suppose to be the event that inspired the epic classic ""JAWS"", well, it is a true event, however, it is rather lame.  The story lacked direction, the acting was sub par, the story line was more of a love story than anything else and the ture ""star"" of the movie was not the shark.  There are some moments when the movie shines, but they are few and far between and quickly forgotten.  Stick to the original ""JAWS"" movie, or even the lame sequels, they are much better than this one.  One thing I can recommend, is it will put you to sleep.",1256342400,,554,4.19811320754717

2518794,2,B000EHQ7II,"Wow, talk about a perfect example of a ""B"" movie.  The story is fairly interesting but the execution is dull and the acting is poor.

2518806,4,B000EHQ7II,"This movie retells the tragic story of how, during 12 days during the summer of 1916 in New Jersey, a shark attacked and killed 4 people, while maiming a fifth. The victims were Charles Vansant on 7/1/16; Charles Bruder on 7/6/16; Lester Stillwell and Stanley Fisher on 7/12/16. Joseph Dunn was also attacked on 7/12/16, but was the lone survivor.
This movie is non-stop in the suspense and action. There is literally very little time to catch your breath and relax before the next attack takes place. There is an attack and death within the first 20 minutes of the movie! If that wouldn't grab your attention, I don't know what would! I found this movie held my attention from the beginning, and is worth watching again. I actually prefer this movie over Jaws, maybe because it's based on true events.
The special effects in the movie are okay, at times looking like it was computer generated. You never get a good look at the wounds of those that have been attacked by the shark, but you get just enough of a glimpse to see the damage that was done, and why it was so devestating.
The events of this movie are considered to be the inspiration for Peter Benchley's ""Jaws."" Scenes in this movie can be found to be similar to what Peter Benchley wrote in his book. For example, after the first death, a lifeguard named Alex tells people that the death was due to a shark attack, but was told it could have been done as a result of an errant torpedo from a German U-Boat. This is very similar to Jaws, when the girl dies, and Brody is initially told is was due to a shark attack, but then later told it was the result of a boating accident.
A bonus feature states that a 7 1/2 foot Great White Shark was caught and found to have human remains inside of it, but there is speculation that it was actually a Bull Shark, and not a Great White.
Skip Jaws, watch this instead!",1206316800,,1868,4.3861671469740635
2518807,5,B000EHQ7II,"I thought this movie was well made, more realistic than JAWS.
It wasn't a Spielberg summer time blockbuster like JAWS.
This was the story that Peter Benchley used for the inspiration
to write the book & then make the movie JAWS.
Plus I'm sure they put more money into making JAWS, Than 12 Days
of Terror, but the shark in this movie looks a little more realistic
than JAWS.
The shark they built for JAWS looks like a submarine not a real shark.
I thought this story was easier to swallow than JAWS as far as realism.
I rate this DVD a 5 of 5 stars!!",1197331200,,549,4.188679245283019
2518808,5,B000EHQ7II,"I like this movie an awful lot. With all apologies to Peter Benchley, may he rest in peace, I find this movie a lot more believable than the Spielberg/Benchley one. This one is based on a true story that occurred off of the shores of New Jersey in the Summer of 1916. The photography is, in my opinion, much more ""life-like"" than the Jaws version, and the attack scenes especially. I'm not saying avoid the Jaws movie, heaven forbid, just give this one a chance. I think that you'll be pleasantly surprised.",1188777600,,507,4.521739130434782
2518809,4,B000EHQ7II,"I've been fascinated with sharks ever since I was eight years old.  A few years ago, I stumbled upon the book ""Twelve Days of Terror"" at a bargain book store.  I read it, and was very interested in the story.

Then I found out there was a movie based on the book.  I bought it, not really expecting much, since I've seen some really bad shark movies.

You know what?  Twelve Days of Terror is a very good movie.  Considering the budget, the movie was quite good.

I felt the movie stayed true to the facts for the most part while adding some cinematic license for dramatic effect.  The movie ties all five 1916 shark attacks together very well.

My only complaint.  The movie was too short.  I would have liked to see more of the ignorance of the period that was illustrated in the book.  In 1916, bathing in the ocean was fairly new.  People still didn't know much about sharks...in fact, they still don't.  I remember there was a post card from the Jersry Shore in the book written my a woman who thought she was safe because the sharks were ""man eaters.""

Other than that, a surprisingly good shark movie.  Although I highly recommend reading the book first.",1188604800,,1161,4.42654028436019
2518810,4,B000EHQ7II,"Since I live in Matawan, NJ where some of the shark attacks took place in 1916, I was extremely interested in seeing the movie.  I felt it was very well done and that the time era in which it took place came through as very realistic.  Although it wasn't as scary as Jaws, it did keep you on the edge of your seat when the attacks occurred.",1187827200,,340,4.059701492537314
2518811,3,B000EHQ7II,"12 Days of Terror: 5 out of 10: This is one strange film. A period piece Jaws taking place in Matawan NJ in 1916. (They actually do a nice job recreating the early nineteenth century Jersey shore line, except the boats are too modern.) I always have enjoyed a good (or even bad) shark attack movie. I always figured it was because of the fun munch the swimmer action. I never really thought about the T and A part of it. You know all those nice girls running around in their string bikinis or even less. Since 1916 female swimwear was apparently designed by the Taliban there is barely an ankle visible in the whole film. Funny how you don't miss the little things till they are gone.

Creating an even bigger quandary is the surprising over the top homoerotic overtones throughout the entire film. Seriously not since Jeepers Creepers 2 have I seen more shirtless boys making googly eyes at each other. The two leads Colin Egglesfield and Mark Dexter are supposed to be in a love triangle with Jenna Harrison but the way these two carry on with each other that poor girl doesn't have a chance no matter whom she chooses. It's like Brokeback Beach Bingo.

That aside this is Jaws by the numbers throwing out the actual historical facts and having our hero along with John Rhys-Davies (who apparently still will appear in any movie offered him.) go shark hunting with barrels and a crazy naturalist. (This along with the rundown ship having an inboard gasoline motor is needless to say ahistorical.) So if you like your Jaws slow paced, with a made for TV Merchant and Ivory feel and you prefer the first victim be a hunky guy in wet clingy cotton one-piece rather than a naked blonde girl. I have got your movie. I on the other hand am going to go watch a Ginger film to help clean my palate.",1169078400,,1792,4.477064220183486
2518812,4,B000EHQ7II,"Maybe it's because people seemed more dignified in the early 1900's, I'm not sure, I just enjoyed watching a shark film without the sterotypical cast, including the arrogant shark hunter, a bunch of foolish babes that get eaten, etc. etc. It made me think of A and E's (Arts and Entertainment) version of, 'The Great Gatsby,' in it's design. Overall one of the better shark films.",1164326400,,380,4.7727272727272725
2518813,5,B000EHQ7II,"When I rented this movie I was expecting another Shark Attack 1, 2 or 3 type movie, but this movie was better.  The acting was good, the setting was excellent for the era and the low budget involved, and most importantly you didn't get those really fake (and funny) special effect shark attack scenes.

I started reading the book Close to Shore a few years ago which is about the same events of 1916.  I am just not a reader, so when I saw this movie was available I immediately rented it and have watched it twice that is how much I enjoyed it.

If you like shark movies you won't be dissappointed in this movie, unless you like shark movies purely for the really bad special affects.",1153180800,,685,4.328125
2518814,3,B000EHQ7II,"12 Days of Terror is essentially a made-for-TV docu-drama that intends to captitalize on the consistent ratings buster ""Shark Week"" programs that Discovery Channel shows during sweeps a couple times a year. However, that doesn't make this film any less interesting or, a couple of times, emotionally charged.

The docu-drama presents the basic facts of the very real, very strange shark attacks that took place on the Jersey shore in 1916, when several people were attacked by a shark (or sharks) and subsequently died as a result of the attacks. Since it had only been a few years previous that people began to actually take swims in the ocean, the fear that these events induced was very real and very damaging to the burgeoning seaside resorts. One of the more bizarre aspects to the attacks is the fact that apparently one or more sharks made their way up Mattewan creek ( a freshwater creek) and took the life of a small boy and then that of the boy's would-be rescuer. Then, later, the shark mutilated yet a second boy.

12 Days of Terror stars former model/current TV soap opera hunk Colin Egglesfield as the lead in the film. Egglesfield will probably never win any acting awards, but this isn't a big budget film either. Egglesfield holds his own fairly well and isn't painfully bad, and at moments, even displays some thoughtful acting chops. Egglesfield, who is in just about every scene, is the emotional center of the film, and acts as ""Everyman"" in his reactions to the events that play out.

The script is based on a book which documents the true tragic events on the Jersey shore during the summer of 1916. The storyline has been adjusted to make it a bit more cinematic and dramatic. It doesn't really hurt the story, but it does make it seem that certain people were involved more consistently than they were.

Egglesfield's real life counterpart was certainly involved in two of the deaths, but beyond that he was not. The writers obviously wanted to create a linear lead for the film. The part of the fisherman (John Rhys-Davies) is a large supporting part, however, in reality, the fisherman only provided assistance when the shark was discovered in the creek. Rhys-Davies method of over-acting certainly balances Egglesfield's sub-acting.

What would have made the film a bit more robust is more background information on the era itself. Modern audiences are often uninformed and quick to dismiss historic events because they don't know the ""why"" aspects of the situation. More emphasis on the naivete of the experts with regard to sharks would have really helped. Instead, we only see that the shark expert keeps attempting to interview our male lead to learn more about what actually happened. That isn't effective in demonstrating what was known or believed at the time - more information should be shown so that we can see the difference between what was believed 90 years ago by science and what even the lay swimmer knows today. That would have been effective.

So...the film is not exactly true to the facts...does this make it a bad film? No. The acting isn't exactly stellar. Does that make it unwatchable? No. In fact, if anything, this film is more of a teaser, enticing the viewer to go out and read the book or at the very least to learn more about the actual events that took place that fateful summer of 1916.

Worth your time if you are interested in some of the historical aspects of the events.",1147737600,,3434,4.771043771043771
2518815,3,B000EHQ7II,"Despite the all-too-familiar story about man-eating shark, ""12 Days of Terror"" tries to view the material from a different angle. The made-for-TV film uses the source material from the book of the same title written by Richard Fernicola, which reports the real-life events that happened in 1916 when people were attacked by a shark on the coast of New Jersey. The horrible attacks, which I think are now almost forgotten, influenced, it is said, Peter Benchley who wrote a book called `Jaws' much later.

Colin Egglesfield plays Alex, a life guard on duty when a shark attacked the first victim on July 1, 1916. Though there is no possible cause of the fatal injury on the person, the authority is not wise to close the beach, fearing the massive panic and decline of the local economy that relies heavily on vacationers.

Despite the too optimistic view of the Mayor, the attacks continue, killing people one after another. Alex decides to capture the killer shark with a help from a local fisherman (played by John Rhys-Davies).

I must confess that I haven't read the book '12 Days of Terror,' but in spite of the obviously fictionalized part of the film such as dialogues exchanged between Alex and his former girlfriend, the filmed version seems to be trying to be as faithful as possible to what happened to the victims of the shark attack as far as its costumes and the set are concerned.

And that is, I am afraid, exactly the weakness of the film. Many characters appear, including entrepreneur-minded animal trainer who is determined to catch the shark, but none of them is round and interesting enough to convince their authenticity. There is no scene-stealing Robert Shaw, and his memorable blackboard-scratching. Though the scenes of the shark attacks are competently done, giving some scary moments, the entire film seems at a loss about how to deal with the source material.

The director is Jack Sholder probably best known his sci-fi thriller `Hidden.' Though Sholder shows his skills in the scenes of shark attacks, the film could have been more suspenseful with more dramatic development of the story and characters, and perhaps with more deaths. However, as the film insists on its historical accuracy, using archive footages and costumes, that is not an option. As you see in the film's title, everything must be solved within 12 days, and that is what you see in this film.

The photography is beautiful, and the film is successful in giving occasional scares, but I couldn't help thinking about Steven Spielberg, who made drastic changes to the original book in making `Jaws.' I know the comparison is unfair, for Spielberg was dealing with a fiction, but it is also true that he knows what people want to see in this kind of film. '12 Days of Terror' tries to do something different, adding the historical truths to the format of the genre, which masterpieces like `Jaws' have already established. It is worthy attempt, but the marriage of history and shark attack is not a successful one.",1141516800,,3013,4.875

Rather than hew to the historical facts, though, this movie does an embarrassingly scene-by-scene Jaws imitation, stealing so much from that classic that at times you can even guess the dialogue. There's influence, and then there
is just aping someone else's movie.

An improbably buff lifeguard, in a New Jersey that looks suspiciously like southern California (mountains? by the water?), thinks the beaches should be closed after at first shark attack, but the town mayor . . . well, you know the rest.",1496534400,,697,5.008620689655173

8109755,4,B000EHQ7II,"Contrary to what some on here have posted about this movie, this is a very good movie about the shark attacks in 1916. I have read articles on this event and while the movie does take some literary license , it is accurate in the main. I think any negative reviews are driven by the blood and guts, sexy babes , and antagonistic  types who think any movie like this should be profanity laced, with side plots of sexy affairs and us vs them .  While some scenes were bloody of course, it was not sensationalized. We need more movies along this line of presentation and less like Jaws and it's sequels.",1473552000,,600,4.348214285714286
8109756,3,B000EHQ7II,"as an enthusiast for the history of the 1916 new jersey shark attacks, i was siked to see a movie made of the events in their time period, as opposed to jaws, which draws much inspiration from the attacks, but crafts a story around them. twelve days is clearly a made for teevee movie, and a plucky one at that. it's directed by the very confident jack sholder of freddy's revenge and the hidden fame, and his dp is in none other than the original elm streets jacque haitkin. consequently, the movie looks great, and moves at a nice pace. the story constructed to fit the events is a bit hokey, but always earnest. colin egglesfield, who plays the righteous lifeguard who can't believe the mayor and asbury park hotelier want to keep the beaches open (""did you actually see a shark?""), is awesomely emotional and passionate, and looks like an amusing cross between michael fassbender and zac effron. despite being a made for teevee movie, the production values are solid. the time period is effectively established, and the shark is generally well executed, particularly when you can't see her, or don't see her very clearly. this is smart, and also helps to reinforce how scary and unknown this confounding fish this must have been to all of these turn of the century ignoramuses: ""it is scientifically impossible for a shark to attack a bather in shallow water."" the attack in matawan creek--a staggering 17 miles inland--is executed with particular effectiveness. this movie has plenty of silliness, and the acting is extremely uneven, but there's sincere effort here, and i liked the results for the most part.",1468886400,,1614,4.830324909747293
8109757,1,B000EHQ7II,"This movie was a lot of work to get through.  The lead characters were such awful actors that if there had been a coherent story they would have really distracted from it.

Egglesfield really relies on good looks rather than ability.  He really deserves a Razzie Lifetime Achievement Award. I've seen better performances from high school kids. In fact, I was embarrassed for him. All of the actors were horrible but he gets extra special note.

This movie stands as proof of what a non-actor with noticeably good looks and a great body can accomplish. I'm sure he answered an ad stating, ""No talent needed"".  Let's hope he finds a different career so we are not subjected to him in the future.",1461283200,,693,4.647540983606557

8109759,4,B000EHQ7II,"I really enjoyed the portrayal of the 1916 time period, the suits , the horse and buggy's, for a low budget film they put a lot of care into making it.  The violence and blood seemed pretty realistic.",1436227200,,200,4.2631578947368425
