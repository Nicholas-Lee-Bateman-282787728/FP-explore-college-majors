It was hard for me to watch Danny Glover in this movie. If this would have been the first time for me seeing him work, I would NEVER want to watch another thing by him again. The acting sucked, the writing sucked, the storyline sucked. Basically, it sucked. Never again.",1469059200,,461,4.423529411764706
