7670213,5,B01BX2B01Q,"I love this show.  I came upon it while researching Matthew Macfadyen, bc I thought he was terrific in MI5 (""Spooks"" in UK) and Pride and Predudice with Keira Knightly. I became enamoured of this historical police drama immediately.  So much to say about the show that hooked me in -- great acting, complex plots, historical/social issues brought to life, and the overarching storylines of each character AND their intertwined relationships --  not just amongst themselves ( one could write a book just on that!) but in their relationships to the community ( Whitechapel) and people who live, work and commit crimes there.  The depth and growth of the main and ""secondary"" characters are represented in historical context, which is fascinating in itself.

 Re: Season Four.  If you are new to the show,  I highly suggest you either watch (and enjoy) the show from the beginning or find a good synopsis somewhere because I would find it hard to jump in at Season 4. Too much has already taken place, and I would be wondering so many things I might just move on to another show.  Evidently the writers chose to just continue directly from end of season 3,  like a play w/intermissions. Don't be discouraged! Just get some background -- although I can't help but suggesting again watching every episode!  Are there crimes to be solved, criminals to be brought to justice?  Absolutely. And some are...well, no spoilers here.

What I also really like is that as in life, not everything is black and white, and how all the gray areas in between are portrayed by the writers and A++ actors, make this series worth more than 5 stars. Ripper Street was going to be cancelled after the first (second?) Season, but evidently a petition w/40,000+ signatures to keep the show alive did the trick. I would have signed, for sure. An exciting, thought provoking show, w/historical police procedures, characters struggling with real personal/historical issues, some bad-___ criminals, and excellent actors.  (It has been said this show has violence/is violent --but compared to what's on American TV these days, I respectfully disagree.  What IS portrayed is police procedures/criminal rights evolving in the historical timeframe of each season.) Also, the main character, Inspector Reid, excellently played by Mr. Macfadyen, is as  much a  thinker/philosopher as he is a great, forward thinking policeman.  So try it-- and don't get discouraged if you just joined the show. There are lots of ways you can catch up and slip into your seat, well- prepared to watch the unfolding of Season Four!  :)",1469923200,13,2580,4.972027972027972
7670214,5,B01BX2B01Q,So glad the 4th season's FINALLY available on the western side of the big pond. Eagerly looking forward to the rest of the season's brilliant Victorian-era police procedural--but why won't Amazon make the complete season available for purchase from the onset? It does with other series airing concurrently with programs they release here.,1469750400,2,338,5.39622641509434

1) Good -- View it on the BBC America cable channel, where each episode is 55 minutes.
2) Better -- View it on Amazon Instant Download, where each episode is 59 minutes.
3) Best -- Buy the Blu-Ray/DVD where each episode is 62 minutes (plus or minus five seconds).

Precise Timings for Episode One - Timing for program content only (no previews or closing credits.)
1) BBC America = 54:20 (not counting 20 minutes of commercials. I stopped watching after the first episode.)
2) Amazon Video = 58:34 (I paid to download the first episode on Amazon just to get the timing.)
3) Blu-Ray = 61:01

4) Ultimate Method
--- Move to the United Kingdom.
--- Get a credit card from a British Bank.
--- Use it to subscribe to Amazon UK Instant Downloads, where each episode is 63-67 minutes.
Amazon UK Downloads are one to five minutes longer than Blu-Ray Episodes.
- And Blu-Ray is the best that American viewers can get.

What a mess.
There is no logical reason why British customers should get preferential treatment.
The last time I looked, Amazon was based here in the US.
For further information [and acrimony] click the link to Season Three below.
Read my review and the comments that follow.

Amazon UK Timings for Season Four:
Episode 1 = 62.5 minutes *
Episode 2 = 62.5 minutes *
Episode 3 = 67 minutes
Episode 4 = 65 minutes
Episode 5 = 66 minutes
Episode 6 = 64 minutes
Episode 7 = 63 minutes
Not being a Brit, I haven't actually seen [or timed] any of the Amazon UK downloads.
My information about the timings is based solely on the Amazon UK website.
* US Episodes 1 and 2 were combined into a single 125 minute UK episode.

""Ripper Street"" is a British police series set in Victorian London.
Contrary to the title, it is not about the hunt for Jack the Ripper,
but is set in Whitechapel shortly after the Ripper killings.
Lead character Detective Inspector Edmund Reid is obsessed with his failure solve the Ripper case.
And that's not all he's obsessed with - very much a flawed hero.
Extremely violent - Police interrogations frequently involve beating a confession out of the suspect.
The female characters are mostly current or former prostitutes (with or without a heart of gold).
This is the dark side of Sherlock Holmes' London.
What Would Basil Rathbone Do?

Seasons One (2012) and Two (2013) were produced by the BBC.
After complaints about naughtiness, the BBC elected not to produce a third season.
Amazon stepped in and produced Season Three (2014) as pay-per-view video downloads.
They did an excellent job - no let down from Seasons One and Two.
BBC Home Entertainment has now issued Seasons Three and Four on Blu-Ray and DVD.
They will be issuing Season Five in 2017.
SAD NEWS: Amazon has announced that there will be no Season Six for ""Ripper Street"".
Read the first comment after this review for the official announcement.

Principal Cast:
-- Inspector Edmund Reid = Matthew Macfadyen  - He retired at the end of Season Three, but it looks like he's back.
-- Inspector Bennet Drake = Jerome Flynn - Inspector Reid's Sergeant, he was promoted to Inspector in Season Three.
-- Captain Homer Jackson = Adam Rothenberg - An alcoholic American ex-army doctor who finds part-time work as a London police medical examiner.
-- Susan ""Long Susan"" Jackson (Mrs. Homer Jackson) = MyAnna Buring - She was a successful businesswoman in Seasons 1-3. Season Four opens with her in prison awaiting hanging.

Be careful with fan sites on the internet - there are some terrible spoilers out there.
Wikipedia gives away the ending to Season 4 without any warning.
Aargh.

No extra features. English SDH subtitles.

Two characters in ""Ripper Street"" were based on real people:

-- Detective Inspector Edmund Reid, played by Matthew Macfadyen.
The real Edmund Reid (1846-1917) was a Detective Inspector at Scotland Yard,
transferred to H Division in Whitechapel in 1888, the year of the Jack the Ripper murders, where he succeeded Frederick Abberline as Chief Inspector and Head of the CID.
The real Edmund Reid retired from the Metropolitan Police and moved to Hampton-on-Sea in 1896.
The fictional Edmund Reid followed his example at the end of Season Three (but unlike the real Edmund Reid, the fictional Reid came out of retirement and returned to Whitechapel).
Before the Ripper murders,
Constable Edmund Reid was better known as an amateur aeronaut (balloonist) with 23 balloon ascents.
In 1877 Reid made the first parachute jump in the UK from 1,000 feet.
He was awarded the gold medal in 1883 from the Balloon Association of Great Britain to commemorate his record-breaking ascent in the balloon ""Queen of the Meadow"" from The Crystal Palace.

-- Detective inspector Fred Abberline, played by Clive Russell.
The real Frederick Abberline (1843-1929) was Edmund Reid's predecessor at H Division in Whitechapel from 1873-1887, before being transferred to Scotland Yard.
At the time of he Ripper murders, he was Reid's immediate superior and took an active role in the investigation.
Abberline retired from Scotland Yard in 1892, and served as head of the European Division of the Pinkerton Detective Agency for twelve years.
Prior to ""Ripper Street"", Inspector Abberline was portrayed in film by Michael Caine in the 1988 TV mini-series ""Jack the Ripper"", and by Johnny Depp in the 2001 film ""From Hell"".

7670217,5,B01BX2B01Q,"Ripper Street, from Series 1 to the end, has been a long and colourful, educating series. I have learned so much from it. I LOVE the actors, the lush settings, the silky dresses, and delicate, antique jewelry. The actors, are true professionals in this somewhat difficult and taxing series. They all must have worked very, very hard to keep up with knowledge they needed to make this series, work so well. The costumes, are worth the watching for all on their own. The story lines, are gripping and riveting. The actors are mostly unknowns in the USA, but they have certainly earned their credits in this series. From day 1, I was hooked on this series and on many of the male actors, I just LOVE Jerome Flynn, his rugged handsomeness, and Adam Rothernberg, is too handsome for words. His plaid pants, his dark hair and his ribald lifestyle is fun sometimes, and difficult at other times. His sweet smile, that he always uses to his advantage, is most often is great to watch! The lovely villainess, Myana Burning was so unexpected. Her character is so lovely, so well dressed, so charming that I never expected her bone chilling performance as a super villain! She is just that good as an actress! Sweet Rose, is just that. Sweet Rose. Chief Inspector Abberline, is lofty, handsome and fabulous! He is so impatient, so exact and so demanding. I LOVE HIM! The daughter of Mathew MacFayden, is just a young, lovely actress, with very much going on She's great! Mr. MacFayden is fabulous in every story in every scene, he's just wonderful! A real must see for the British Drama Lover!",1499990400,,1582,4.673835125448028

7670221,4,B01BX2B01Q,"A short review for now. I've really gotten hooked on this show. Never expected to stick with it as I thought Ripper history was sole focus. Acting is great, enjoy all characters very much e.g. Reid, Jackson, Susan.  Was so very sadden to observe Benet going downhill and ultimately losing the will to live.

7670352,5,B01BX2B01Q,"Mysterious story-lines in every episode but consistent backstories of all the main characters that keep winding through each show, keeping the audience interested & waiting for the next chapter/episode.
Discovering the actor who plays Mr. Homer Jackson's character makes this series fantastic. I had to look the guy up & google everything I could find out about him. Read he's dating Rose from the show in real life. Awesome actor he is! And of course Matthew McFayden is good too. That's a given. And the actor from Game of Thrones plays another cop in this series. I read about him also and had no idea he actually was part of a singing duo extremely popular in Europe & they sang mostly big hits from days of old. Couldn't imagine him singing so had to look him up on Youtube. What a riot. And a great voice too!

Hands-down, Ripper Street is the best series I've discovered in a long time. Watched one season on Netflix bought another on iTunes then discovered my Amazon Prime had the remaining seasons up through Season 4. It's worth buying on Amazon & downloading onto laptop for the simple reason I could turn on the closed caption & catch every word each character said & never miss any dialogue. Cannot wait til Season 5 airs in 2017. And to think the producers were going to stop making shows after Season 2: but so many viewers were hearing about this show through word of mouth in England where it's filmed so Amazon Prime bought & ordered 2 more Seasons. Isn't that cool?!!
Enjoy watching the shows: you'll like them all. Just forward through the few gory violence parts if that personally bothers you and you'll be just fine. Great Series!",1480809600,,1653,4.622448979591836

Great acting, great script, good story lines, big improvement in film quality. It was still a bit contrived at times, but pretty entertaining.  I was very much looking forward to another great season of Ripper Street. This season still had the great acting, but unfortunately the writing was junk. No more witty dialogue, plots were slopped together, scenes played out ridiculously bad.  The investment in quality writing was clearly not carried over for this season. I would categorize this season as a poorly written, trashy, period themed, soap opera. For whatever reason Amazon has dropped the ball on this show.

The human condition of the Jews in London is as my grandmother described it to me (and as a Jew, it is important to me that this part of the story is told with as much realism as possible).

Although Season 3 was a bit lackluster compared to seasons 1 and 2, season 4 has pulled me back into the show's incredibly complex characters, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. Long after Ripper Street is gone, I'll think of Reid, Drake, and Jackson, characters whose depth sets them apart from most. Each one is flawed and tormented in his own way. The cinematography, sets, scripts, and cast are all superlative. Why hasn't Ripper Street received the critical recognition it deserves?  Apparently season 4 ended with the above episode.

7670462,5,B01BX2B01Q,"I really love this series and am so happy it's back. However, if you've not watched it before, you'll be lost.
What makes it special is the relationships the writers' have set up between the characters. Are they friends or enemies? Supporting or betraying?
The actors are very good. I especially like Jerome Flynn who is also on ""Game of Thrones"" as Bronn. David Threlfall, the best actor you've never heard of, is terrific.
""Ripper Street"" airs on BBC America. It was not available for free on Amazon Prime so I bought Season 4. Yes, I like it that much.",1473033600,,555,4.56

7670470,5,B01BX2B01Q,"Always great to catch up with the gang. Plenty of twists and turns and a dark side, with Reid and Drake always struggle to crawl back into the light. Jackson is always keeping you guessing and Long Susan is so well portrayed by Myanna Buring, it is a pleasure to watch. Very good historical detail and great acting. The setting they use for London's Whitechapel is fantastic. Gloomy, atmospheric, just the place for dark deeds to be done. Some outstanding guest stars make this one of the best shows ever. BBC must be kicking themselves for cancelling it. Thank goodness Amazon picked it up. All I can say is, in the words of an earlier Victorian fictional character, Oliver Twist, MORE please!",1472860800,5,694,4.69672131147541

It's actually one of only two things I watch on regular television right now. The other being Mr. Robot.",1472774400,7,278,4.148148148148148

I was happy to see Amazon pick it up but now hear the same fate awaits.  Update; after anticipating season 4 and my DVR not recording it, I went ahead and bought this season only to just now realize that there were only 7 episodes rather than the usual 8.  I'm highly disappointed and now will probably have to wait a year for the final season.",1472515200,,492,4.114583333333333

8751807,1,B01BX2B01Q,"Another great series perverted to the service of political correctness.
The actors are great McFadden, et.al. The writers are good but are whoring their product to serve PC. Too bad. I was going to buy the whole series but PC shot that all to hell.
However, this series is clearly paying homage to Edmund Reid. For that I praise it highly. Macfadyen was clearly the star of the series as he kept the series on course as best he could--though the writers betrayed him by having him in a self-servicing and inaccurate telling of real life in Whitechapel. The story line of Long Susan and Capt. Jackson is confusing as the dickens because all I got out of that is that the writers were telling woman to be as corrupt as men because woman are as incompetent as men as just as irresponsible--that woman are not the great white hope for saving the world after all. That they can be just as evil. Well, I believe the writers took a fantastic opportunity to actually portray Whitechapel, as the did in the first season, and a real piece of history and blew in on a worthless story that clearly sends a screwed up political correctness message. too bad.
But hats off to Edmund Reid and Drake.",1519516800,,1183,4.506976744186047
