5736366,4,B00CRWDKV0,I enjoyed this DVD which is full of action and also reflects the dedication of these fishermen who often have to accept the reality of unfavourable weather and the power of some of these massive fish. It is reassuring to see that sustainable fishing practice was followed,1387756800,,271,4.787234042553192
5736367,5,B00CRWDKV0,Love this DVD set.  I bought it to be able to put in slow mo and freeze frame to see the gear and other stuff.  Also to rerun parts to learn how to tuna fish.  Now I qualify as a gogan and can go fishing and make a bunch of dumb mistakes for those guys to complaiin about.  Maybe if my mistake is dumb enough I will get on TV!,1384041600,2,326,3.6142857142857143
