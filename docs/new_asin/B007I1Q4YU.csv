5087653,5,B007I1Q4YU,Lear is probably the most complex of Shakespeare's plays. This is a wonderful rendition. I like it so much that I bought it for my son who teaches honors English.,1374364800,13,162,4.433333333333334
5087654,5,B007I1Q4YU,"Absolute genius. Ian McKellan if one of the best Shakespearean actors ever, and that includes Olivier and Burton. Worth the price, many times over.",1353888000,12,147,5.166666666666667
8517074,5,B007I1Q4YU,Ian McKellan is a most excellently evil Macbeth.,1480809600,,48,5.125

8517076,2,B007I1Q4YU,"Ian McKellan is going around saying this MacBeth is an accessible and engaging version of Shakespeare. It's not. It's dense and long. If you want Shakespeare for all, a better choice would be Franco Zefferelli's Romeo and Juliet (1968). It's gripping in all the places where Baz Luhrmann's 1996 version of Romeo + Juliet leaves you wishing you cared what happened to the characters.

I didn't watch Lear.",1466467200,,404,4.9411764705882355
8517077,4,B007I1Q4YU,An excellent double feature produced by a reputable company featuring outstanding actors.,1457827200,,89,6.5
8517078,5,B007I1Q4YU,Very enjoyable.,1438992000,,15,7.0
8517079,1,B007I1Q4YU,"I couldn't finish watching, it was so bad -- well, bad for me -- this was a ""modern"" production, with nothing but actors on a small circular stage -- no sets, no props, no period costume -- certainly not what I think of as a play or a movie production of a play.  It was produced for those who are already fans of the Scottish play and already have the dialogue memorized.  I remember reading it in high school and enjoying the story, but this was not the video version for me.  But it might float someone else's boat.  I started Macbeth (but couldn't finish it); I didn't start King Lear so I don't know if it is the same high-brow production style.",1438387200,4,650,4.260162601626016
8517080,3,B007I1Q4YU,I want to like this and there are some things to like about both performances. Unfortunately the defects blur the positive. Macbeth is well acted but I have to agree with the previous reviewer who notes its circumscribed presentation. It is too tightly woven in its intimacy. One glaring defect is perhaps in the video transfer which is horribly grainy and distracts from what might otherwise be interesting effects of light and shade. After watching this I need to revisit the Roman Polanski film which is one of my favorites.,1432598400,2,527,4.866666666666666
8517081,2,B007I1Q4YU,"""Macbeth"" is a claustrophobic play, tightly controlled in space and time, written for performance on an open stage with almost no scenery.  I'm not persuaded that it can be done effectively on-screen, especially a television screen.  This presentation in particular presents ""the Scottish play"" in a claustrophobic setting, which so circumscribes the drama as to make it difficult to watch, much less appreciate.
  The same is not true to the same extent with ""King Lear,"" but the scale of the setting here is still wrong.  It's too small.  Both plays really need a certain amount of space to be played in, and in this case both are presented in settings that are too limited.  I think the reason for this is that the major characters are written as very large-scale human beings, powerful but evidently more influential than their human limitations can legitimately support.  That is finally what these two plays are about.",1431993600,2,924,4.993464052287582
8517082,5,B007I1Q4YU,"I'm currently in a retirement home, where in December I'll be showing Macbeth to an informally organized film group -- continuing in that theme I'll next be showing Kurosawa's Throne of Blood.
I like the Thames Shakespeare collection because it's true to the text, and has great actors.
It would be nice if there were subtitles, although one could argue that they are unneeded because we should have learned the Shakespearean canon by heart.
The Lear is merely first-rate.",1413072000,5,472,4.987341772151899
8517083,5,B007I1Q4YU,"This is a wonderful DVD and the actors take you right back in time without elaborate scenery, to those dastardly days of murder and remorse.  Judi Dench is unbelievable in her performance of Lady Macbeth.  You clearly experience every emotion as if you were right there.  All the actors are equally as intense.  2 very well done performances in this package!",1390867200,10,358,4.819672131147541
