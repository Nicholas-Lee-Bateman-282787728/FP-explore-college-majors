28041,3,0767817648,"The 1980's were an era that mass produced more... screwball comedies than ever before. It was also the era that movies filled with mega-violence were made and cloned more quickly than mulitpling mosquitoes.[I thought] one of these such films was BLUE THUNDER.

BLUE THUNDER has all the elements of many of those violent 1980s films. The lead character is a Vietnam vet struggling with vivid flashbacks. He has a comical sidekick (in this case played by Daniel Sterns) who is murdered about halfway through the picture. The lead character ends up getting caught up in a plot that runs deeper than he originally imagined that ends up leading all the way to some secret government sector or plot. In the end the hero takes things into his own hands and goes on a rampage to get the bad guys and set things right and is cleared of all wrong doing, accused or actual.

Roy Scheider stars in the film as L.A.P.D. aero-division pilot Frank Murphy. Schneider does a decent job considered the material he was given. Besides one feels an immediate kinship to anything Scheider acts in; this is the guy that killed Jaws. His sidekick in the film is a young Daniel Sterns (before he gained fame with ""The Wonder Years"" and HOME ALONE) and he does a good job playing the greenhorn.

However, neither Scheider or Sterns is the star of this movie. They are both second billing to a super-duper armed police helicopter called (you guessed it), BLUE THUNDER. You see Blue Thunder was created by the government to keep us rebellious citizens in line and to protect people at the 1984 Olympic Games in L.A. However, some really evil guys planned to use the machine for alternative purposes to help ""keep order"" (hint, hint). This chopter has armor, can sense heat, shoots a lot of bullets really fast, and can hear and see through walls. She's the star.

Overall, the movie's not all that good or bad. The movie starts off slow but picks up after the first half hour racing steam until the exploding, yet let down of a conclusion.",1013558400,,2011,4.656338028169014
28042,3,0767817648,"Have you ever wondered what life would be like if...it was the future? All books were burned? Aliens invaded? Then you've probably turned to sci-fi to live out your dystopian (or utopian) fantasies. So in the never-ending quest for the right drug, take the blue pill. Blue Thunder, that is. Blue Thunder explores all possible options for expostion. Such a revisionist history usually attempts to redefine science fiction in film-specific terms, opting variously for epistemologically based or image-based criteria instead of the source-based or narrative-based assumptions that have so far shaped most discussions of SF film. Not so with Ol' Blue Thunder. Central to the genius of this film is the reconsideration of the question of whether cinemato graphic aspects of film production could themselves mark film as science fictional or provide in themselves phenomena worthy of consideration by the SF community--the spectacle of production technology deserving and rewarding our attention just as surely as do narratives about the impact of technology. And the SF community would have a lot better things to talk about than cinemato graphic aspects if they did the wild thing more often, instead of drooling over Captain Kirk's tush in Star Trek! The fleeting colaboration of brilliant thespian (Rob Schneider) and brilliant director (John Badham), combined with the building blocks of life known as craft service (oh yeah, and let's not forget the writers!) made one tour de force without the tour or the force, so I guess this film is just made of ""de"" (get it?) So what are you doing still reading this review? Go out and rent it!",998611200,,1634,5.146616541353383
28043,4,0767817648,"Blue Thunder is a good film. Not great, but good. It's biggest boost comes from actors Roy Scheider (Jaws) and the late Warren Oats (The Wild Bunch, Stripes). Warren Oats gives his captain role enough witty sarcasm to make other actors in kind take note. This was his last film performance. If your a fan of either actor that of it's self is reason to own the film. The Arthur Rubinstein music score also helps give the film a pulse (note: to give the music a haunting effect, Rubinstein placed a microphone in a water cooler bottle and set it underneath a Grand Piano while recording some tracks).
As for the story, it tends to lose the pace of the film at a point but that pales in comparison to other, more obvious flaws. Things like a boom mic in a shot, or continuity mistakes like that found in Lymangood's death (note: watch his hands).
The herald of Blue Thunder coming forward with the Pinkville sunrise in the background is just as menacing now as it was for a certain nineteen year old who saw it in '82. The climactic duel between Murphy and Cochrane (Malcolm McDowell) is also one of the films best moments even if it was imposible. There are little features to be had on this DVD, this might hurt any must-have-it-all collectors like myself, but for me one reason was all I needed to purchase Blue Thunder, ...memories.",984182400,,1333,4.512396694214876
28044,4,0767817648,"""Blue Thunder"" is an experimental helicopter designed to be prevent or otherwise deal with any terrorist situation.  With its armor plating and rotary cannon, Blue Thunder (a converted Gazelle Helicopter) is no mere observer helicopter.  Also equipped with an array of sensors and a computer that can hack into anyting, and an engine silencer and its pilot can sneak the chopper's awesome firepower right up to the enemy before being spotted.
Roy Scheider is Murphy, a police pilot and shell-shocked Viet Nam vet, is given the task of field-testing the new chopper in hopes of getting it in service for the LA Olympics (this movie is circa 1982).  Never one to go by the book, and with the help of fellow flyer Lymangood (Dan Stern), Murphy takes the super-chopper on an unauthorized jaunt and discovers the dark secret of Blue Thunder's purpose, uncovering proof of a massive conspiracy to turn LA into a police state governed by a fleet of gunships.  When the conspirators - who include a sinister pilot (Malcom McDowell) who was also Murphy's Commander in Vietnam - realize they face exposure, they kill Lyman and set their sites on Murphy.  Driven to desperation, Murphy hijacks the machine, stalling for time until his girlfriend (Candy Clarke) can find the proof that Lyman left behind revealing the truth about Blue Thunder.  The police and the military pull out every stop to bring Murphy down - missiles, fighters and other choppers.  Murphy's solutions are pretty inventive, but you know that these are only previews for the big one - the major dogfight between Scheider and Macdowell over the streets of LA.
Blue Thunder is actually pretty smart, obscured though by how much fun it is.  The first half, before we see the super-copter show its moves, is wonderfully paranoid, with an eerie electronic score and wonderfully spastic camera movements (now ruined in countless episodes of NYPD Blue).  Schieder and Stern develope this great dialog (mostly ad-libbed) that keeps things flowing, Macdowell is great as the evil Colonel and Warren Oates - though underused - is also excellent as Scheider's boss.  The flight-scenes are incredibly choreographed and have yet to be surpassed (after nearly 20 years!?!?).
All in all, a great flick.",983923200,5,2247,5.032345013477089
28045,5,0767817648,"Blue Thunder is the fictional story of a high tech helicopter which the government plans to use against the population under the guise of ""crowd control from the air"" for the upcoming Olympic games.  Some of you may remember Airwolf, or even the short lived Blue Thunder series with James Farentino and Dana Carvey, this is where it all started.
Although the plot is kinda lame, this movie boasts state of the art (in 1983) aerial combat action sequences over Los Angeles (L.A. natives will recognize the Piper Tech building, where air support is headqurtered, the downtown cityscape, the L.A. river), and a cool chase scene through the LA River, which like the rest of L.A., is concrete and steel.  Roy Scheider (Murphy), Daniel Stern(Lymangood), and Warren Oates (in his last picture), give great performances, however, Malcom MacDowell's character, a sinister Army Lt. Colonel, is a bit hard to believe.  The real star of the show here is Blue Thunder, a modified 1972 French Gazelle, outfitted with listening devices, video and infrared cams, and an M61 20mm vulcan cannon fitted to the nose. Blue Thunder is able to see through walls, peek down dresses at 1000 feet, and destroy a city block at the touch of a button. Some will notice the similarities to the Apache AH-64, and the cockpit windows are faceted, much like the then-classified stealth fighter.
Blue Thunder takes us to that ""big brother is watching you"" card reminicent of 1984,(which is the year the Olympics were in L.A.) what with its surveillance equipment, and there is even a reference to that in the movie, when Lymangood asks Murphy, ""Big Brother, you want it on or off?"" referring to the cockpit recorder which records their conversations. ""I think we can lose that,""he replies.
The ending battle scene is great, with an awesome finale, and a somewhat chilling epilogue, as the credits begin to roll.  You get the feeling that Murphy has avenged.
All in all, a pretty good movie with a bit of techno-sci-fi-thriller.",972691200,7,1993,4.905044510385757
28046,4,0767817648,"This was one of my favorites as a pre teen.  If you've ever seen the TV show AIRWOLF, you get what this movie is about. They kind of ripped this movie off with that show.  The action scenes are top notch and the story is  pretty amusing.  All around a pretty solid flick.",945129600,6,271,4.056603773584905
28047,3,0767817648,"One hates to get caught agreeing with such insufferably elitist movie critics like Pauline Kael and Leonard Maltin, but their misgivings about the movie Blue Thunder are fairly accurate.  Kael goes too far in calling the film ""Suspense In A Void,"" for its implied argument that the film skimps over characters and plot is unfair.  The film establishes good audience involvement with the characters, helped by the fine performances of Roy Scheider, Daniel Stern, and Malcolm McDowell.
The main draw, of course, is the helicopter, a French-built gunship, reminscent of the AH-64 Apaches featured in Firebirds, but sporting a Gatling cannon with a fire-rate of 4,000 rounds per minute, and high-tech surveillance cameras and microphones.  The ship's lethality is demonstrated in a terrific test run by the Army for LAPD brass; the ship blasts away at cardboard dummies representing terrorists and civilians within a mockup of a city block.  The film pointedly highlights civilian dummies getting blasted; the audience thus forgets that, given the hopeless interminging of terrorists amid civilians, the gunship's ability to pick out the right targets comes through as well as can be honestly expected.  It all closes out with a delightfully explosive strafing run of a bus manned by terrorists.
Frank Murphy (Scheider) is assigned to test Blue Thunder over LA, this over the trepidation of old Army foe Colonel F.E. Cochrane (McDowell).  Murphy and his copilot Richard Lymangood (Stern) test the ship's surveillance capability in hilarious fashion when they stare down the cleavage of a waitress and then listen in on a CHP cop (nicknamed Double Dork by Murphy) in bed with another man's wife.  But then they get wind of the real reason for the chopper's existence when they follow Cochrane to the city's federal building and record a conversation between Cochrane, other members of the Blue Thunder project, and several government types; they've been instigating rioting in LA's barrios to justify bringing out Blue Thunder in a program called Project THOR.  It is a plot that lacks even a minor level of believability or plausibility.
The action scenes and cast are good, but the absurdity of the plot ultimately hurts the film.  Nonetheless, the visuals are worth a look.",926553600,3,2271,5.183060109289618
28068,3,0767817648,"For some odd reason, the 1980s was the decade for the ""character machine,"" where audiences became engrossed in the capability and technology of a vehicle almost to the point of the vehicle becoming a major star or protagonist in the film. Blue Thunder is in my opinion the epitome of this phenomenon, along with The General Lee (Dukes of Hazard), Airwolf, Street Hawk, Firefox, KITT (Knight Rider), Back to the Future's DeLorean DMC-12, Time Rider, and to a lesser extent, B.A. Baracas' van (""The A-Team"") and the Ferraris of Magnum PI and Miami Vice. Blue Thunder is an action flick at its core, with some plot holes and over the top stunt work, but contextualized properly, is a fun film. Very few models were employed to make the film (yes, Blue Thunder was a fully functional flying modified A&eacute;rospatiale Gazelle), and the blue screening effect to make it seem like Roy Scheider is actually piloting the chopper is surprisingly good. If you see this film, do so with the understanding that it wasn't about character development, acting, etc. but it was a stunt film for stunt fans. And for 1983 the stunts are pretty good. Go for the Blu-ray, not the DVD, as the cleanup of the original on Blu-ray is noteworthy.",1492732800,,1223,4.773584905660377

28093,5,0767817648,"I'm the 110th person to give this film Five Stars and the 194th person to review it.

I forgot how much I loved this movie. I saw it in theatres in a third run discount theatre in Williamsburg, Virginia and so loved the movie. I love it even more now.

This film has just enough plot to keep us interested but not enough to whet our appetite. For instance, what were the Hispanic men trying to accomplish when they waylaid councilwoman McNeely in Brentwood? How were the police notified so quickly? The cruisers arrived almost immediately after the assault began! I've called the police myself in nice neighborhoods and it took 10 minutes for the bastards to arrive. These cops were on the scene like they'd been teleported there. What were the criminals trying to do? They clearly were not hit men and they were not attempting to rape her as was reported in the film. And had they been hit men they would have slain her immediately and not roughed her up to the point where she screamed for help and drew attention to herself and the ongoing crime. Hit men would have used a sound suppressed pistol to kill her and yet that's not what was done. These guys did nothing but get themselves killed for no reason (They Accomplished Nothing). The film offers vague allusions as to some secret cadre of government officials wanting to start riots  so as to have Blue Thunder's capabilities demonstrated. Unfortunately this is not explored too much in the film. Despite this I enjoyed the film and was surprised by a plot element that was revealed at the end of the film during one of Frank Murphy's flashbacks while engaged in aerial combat.

The aerial photography in this film was incredible! It had aerial chases galore as well as good old fashioned ground car chases. This makes the film unique for the time period. The fact that there was little computer generated imagery (F-16's Notwithstanding) in the film appealed to me. It is ironic that the technology depicted in this film is now available to us all at the consumer level! In the 1980s it was all cutting edge. Today it is par for the course gear that we all take for granted.

Frank Murphy was a realistic character. He's a man we admire who suffers from PTSD. He seems to be a loner except that his girlfriend Candy comes back into his life and brings joy along with angst. She's the everyday lady next door raising a ten-year-old boy. I liked their on again off again relationship but I really loved the loyalty they showed to one another. If only every guy could have a woman like her.

I won't go too much into the storyline. Others have done a better job at that. I will say this, however. If you like Airwolf and Blue Thunder I recommend this DVD highly. This edition is in print but is fill screen. The widescreen special edition is out of print. If you can find it, buy it. Otherwise you will have to make due with the full screen version. I'd love to see a remake of this film.

It's a race against time for them as they try and uncover the plot with the help of a friend, played by actress Candy Clark (American Graffiti). The ending is a showdown against Scheider and McDowell over the skies of Downtown Los Angeles in the early 1980s.

28159,5,0767817648,"BOTTOM LINE: Been a fan of this film since it first splashed across cineplex screens. I've owned it on tape, two different DVDs version and now this Blu-ray. BLUE THUNDER is a solid action film, thrilling and highly entertaining from start to finish. Roy Scheider is excellent as is the rest of the cast. I enjoy revisiting this movie every so often, like an old friend. The audio/video improvements in this new 1080p format make it a recommended upgrade. This spiffy new BLUE THUNDER Blu scores a solid 4 STARS from me.

THE STORY: U.S. government develops a highly-specialized prototype helicopter gunship, nick-named Blue Thunder. The copter sports impressive firepower, is heavily armored and loaded to the rotors with all manner of high-tech, stealthy surveillance gizmos. It is assigned to Los Angeles police department's Astro Division to test its real-world capabilities, in anticipation of using it to possibly quell unrest & potential trouble during the upcoming 1984 Summer Olympics. Loner pilot Frank Murphy (Roy Scheider) draws the short straw and together with his newly-assigned partner Richard Lymangood, (a young, gangly Daniel Stern), the duo takes to the skies. Soon afterward, Murphy uncovers a sinister plot by a handful of corrupt government officials within the Blue Thunder program to turn the super-duper chopper into an unchallenged master of the not-so-friendly skies. When these creeps discover that Murphy knows, (a terrific ""Oh, crap!"" moment), he suddenly becomes Target Number One.

THOUGHTS: Lifting off in early summer of 1983, BLUE THUNDER is a slick allegory about Big Brother-type evils, a too powerful government and advanced technology getting ahead of our ability to use it properly and ethically. Rough-edged everyman actor Roy Schieder is perfectly cast here as Vietnam vet Frank Murphy, an idealistic but world-weary (and slightly damaged) man still suffering bouts of post traumatic stress disorder due to some deeply disturbing events he experienced while serving in 'Nam. Despite his desire to live a normal life the horrors of war are never far from his mind, often haunting the tortured ex-soldier in his dreams. Frank has few he can call friends. Among them are the Chief of the Astro Division (the late, great Warren Oates, in his last screen role), a mean as a snake, tough as saddle leather type who takes no crap but has a genuine soft spot for Murphy. Cute-as-a-button Candy Clark is Frank's ditzy, off-again/on-again girlfriend. New to the fold as Murphy's eyes & ears while aboard Blue Thunder, Daniel Stern's turn as Lymangood is a joy as he brings a genuine, earnest, goggle-eyed and eager to please energy to the role. You like him almost immediately. Lymangood, (""JAFO"" to the boys in Astro), also brings a valuable skill set to the table, making him an integral part of the narrative and not just a shell or red herring. Rounding out the cast as Frank's nemesis (and old war ""buddy""), is Malcolm McDowell as callus retired Army colonel F.E. Cochrane. McDowell crafts a smug, slimy, unhinged, slick & irritating character in Cochrane. Seriously, you just want to kick this guy in the nuts every time he's on screen.

F/X-wise, the full-scale Blue Thunder chopper itself is pretty impressive but sadly outdated in today's real world of ultra-sophisticated gunships like the Apache & Cobra, and their Super versions. Still at the time this came out, it was a cool yet also frightening concept: something that could blow away most anything in the air and at the same time be capable of silently hovering undetected outside your window and stealthily recording everything you say & do. Big Brother in the air? Scary stuff - and rather prophetic. (Although the airborne eyes & ears that we must contend with and worry about today are tiny remote-controlled drones rather than huge manned gunships.) The movie's SFX miniatures look good but the optical composite work is rather lacking; (the shots of the Air Force jets are kinda lame). They work well enough to service the story, and if you've gotten into the movie and are rooting for Frank during the film's tense, climactic airborne confrontation then the jet F/X wonkiness won't even matter.

THE BLU-RAY: Mill Creek gives us a really nice quality transfer. The movie has never looked or sounded better than it does on this Blu-ray, but be advised that this disc has ZERO extra features. If you've got the Special Edition DVD then you'll want to hang onto it for the bonus content. Even without the goodies, this Blu-ray is worth the double-dip for the improved video & audio.",1448323200,,4585,5.036890645586298

Old Murphy (Roy Scheider) would be dumbfounded by how far we've sunk.

I had an old copy which I loaned to someone the other day (they really enjoyed it), and darn if I didn't give it another whirl since it had been so long since I pulled it off the shelf to watch.

I kept seeing a lot of extras not on the original DVD, and found out they are on this special edition, which I understand has been remastered in HD.

Even though I have the original DVD, I ordered the special edition to check it out in HD, and for all the extras (making of the movie, the helicopter, etc).

Roy Scheider did an excellent job, and Warren Oates is great as his crusty, no-nonsense boss.

It also has a great soundtrack, which is always icing on the cake for a great movie.",1439164800,,898,4.167630057803469

Sure...there are bits of it that are cliche', but we aren't looking for high brow, mind expanding material here.

Roy Scheider is the pilot cop who comes to term with the new beast, bests the bad guys, and saves the country from itself.  Many of the flight sequences are outstanding, though the dialog frequently sucks and makes the pilots seem stupid.  This is one that is worth sitting through every couple of years.",1423872000,2,543,4.880434782608695
28227,3,0767817648,"I've always had very mixed feelings about Blue Thunder.  On the plus side it features it features one of the last big budget Hollywood leading roles for the perennially under-appreciated Roy Scheider plus wonderful supporting turns by Warren Oats as his exasperated boss and Candy Clark as his flaky but brave girlfriend and a hissable villain in Malcolm MdDowell.  The movie is fast paced and sometimes exciting and is slickly directed by the underrated John Badham.

So what's the problem?

Blue Thunder just has so many things in it that don't ring true it can be frustrating to watch unless you are dumb or willing to turn your brain completely off.  First of all the plot involves a conspiracy by shady government officials and firearms manufacturers to create phony crime to justify the police buying the helicopter of the title--but it's pretty hard to imagine any scenario where a city would allow a heavily armed military chopper that can take out whole city blocks at a time to be used by the police.  Then there's the question of how the very British Malcolm McDowell who never attempts an American accent became a colonel in the US military.  Or how the US military is getting involved with domestic policing even though that is illegal.  Or why the chief assassin for the arms merchants drives around in a beater without any plates that makes him look extremely out of place in all of the upscale areas where he happens to be plying his trade in the movie.

The sequence where Roy Scheider outsmarts two F-16's and their heat seeking missiles is fun but, realistically, a lot of innocent people likely died as a result of Roy Scheider's evasive maneuvers since this is all happening in the middle of the day when the buildings would be full of people.  The script is co-written by the normally reliable Dan O'Bannon (Alien; Dead and Buried; Return of the Living Dead; Total Recall) so it's hard to understand why Blue Thunder is frequently so dumb.

In the end Blue Thunder isn't a 1980's action classic in the same league as Die Hard or Robocop or Predator or The Terminator because there are way too many obvious and fixable problems with the script--but on balance it's probably more good than bad and qualifies as reasonably good mindless entertainment, basically a slicker and much more expensive version of the entertaining but dopey schlock that Cannon was churning out.  The frustrating thing is that Blue Thunder could have been excellent if someone had bothered to rewrite the script.",1423440000,3,2507,4.818181818181818

BLUE THUNDER: Tired of the same old car chases? Try a chopper chase instead. Tired of the same old car crashes? Try a couple of copter crashes (which have become almost a clich in action movies since ""Blue Thunder."" I recall seeing a gag pie chart entitled ""What Helicopters Do In Movies,"" for example, in which the entire pie is colored blue, and the Key reveals that blue equals ""crash."")

Badham knows how to direct action (once he finally cuts to the chase), and here we get plenty: Copters vs. copters; copters vs. cars; F-16's with heat-seeking missiles vs. Blue Thunder (and Frank's wits); and--just in case you aren't tired of car chases--a doozy of a chase that begins in a drive-in. There are in fact a lot of chases and a lot of destruction (but very little blood); some macho fun; adventure, suspense and wowing aerial action; and another wonderful performance from Scheider.

I wanted to see this movie after reading about it and the fact it came out around when it did which I like those years, I thought well there are Choppers and Even read about a Corvette(it's a 1980 maybe a 81' but appears briefly,it's the 80-82 Style however the 82 has crossfire on the side,among other things so its not a 82 and this movie was made 82' even 81' I read.)Well,I did Enjoy the Lead Actor's acting and the cast,I enjoyed Roy Scheider's work in Jaws and even more so In The Seven Ups which has one of the greatest car chases of all the time,that being said this movie despite the good: Helicopters(Sadly French ones),Helicopter Chases,Brief Corvette Cameo,and despite the part where you will see a Woman doing some Incredible stuntwork of her own if you know what I mean,(it's around the start of the film.)The Plot is So Hollywood and so Typical,Considering the Era,Carter Lost,Reagan Won and now with Age since the Riots Of L.A.,Crime and of course the fact that there is no coming Policestate like most Loons think will come or thought then,and if any Everyone knows we are more at risk of a bunch of Leftleaning Crazies instead of The Righties,that said The character in this film as a Police officer is so inconsiderate of the damage he inflicts upon private property,disobeying orders and just being a Liberal Lion and a Hero to that side of the stratosphere makes the movie a Downer. Yes,I totally want to see Values And Fighting Crime as A Conspiracy to impose on civil liberties Please Hollywood you haven't it done before,and as mentioned there is a great Car Chase with A Chevy Vega,the film on the dvd was re-edited so alot of the chase isn't there,The Character's Trans-Am Is Great but did not get enough time despite a little more than the Corvette. Also,In The Seven-Ups Movie(1973),Roy Scheider 's Character(also then a Police officer) uses a Pontiac Ventura (looks like a Nova) So How Come in Blue Thunder we see another Pontiac? Yes they were popular in the 70s/80s courtesy of Smokey Films and even now but That to me seems the conspiracy was Roy a Pontiac Spokesmen? the dvd Snapcase that comes with my dvd also features a little booklet explaining how this Cliche of a Hollywood Movie came to be,the writers were disturbed by the fact Helicopters or a Helicopter(police) were flying over their home,Heaven Forbid Police Patrol the area,Of course originally they were picturing a Dystopian PoliceState movie(How Original.) and they came up with this even more Original of a Idea for a Movie,the final Product you see of Blue Thunder.

They show police helicopters flying. Men gather for their assignment. Is this a good assignment? They report for a 211 in progress and follow the robber with a searchlight. A helicopter's blades create a downdraft. They spot an abandoned vehicle. This is an unusual attraction at night. ""How does she bend like that?"" A radio call takes them away. There are shots and suspects fall; they call for an ambulance. Their manage has complaints; they are grounded. Frank's driving tells of his attitude. His girlfriend visits. The TV reports the death of a politician. Frank Murphy is suspended. Two Federal agents tell of a new helicopter that will be tested (the Olympic Games will be held in Los Angeles). It has anti-terrorist capabilities. [Is that legal?] Its 20 mm rapid fire machine gun does tremendous damage (with collateral casualties).

Frank will do the test flight. His helicopter develops engine trouble and crashes! [Sabotage?] Driving down a one-way street the wrong way? Does Frank have memory flashbacks to Vietnam? [Note the personal conflicts added for drama.] Frank is warned about his comments to that Colonel. He flies the helicopter at night. The computer can research names, and he overhears a conversation about the shooting of a Commissioner. Is Murphy a threat? ""Take him out."" Captain Braddock grounds him again. His copilot Lyman is attacked at home and tortured so he'll give up that tape! Can he escape? Who will be blamed? Murphy listens to a telephone message from Lyman. Who will he call? He calls his girlfriend to pick up that tape hidden at a drive-in theater. A police car shows up but she gets away. [A chase for action.] Two police helicopters fly near, then have to land!

The helicopters fly along a river bed, one helicopter has to land. Frank's girlfriend is stopped. Can she get away? Will police property be destroyed? The TV station broadcasts the live news. Will F-16s be sent to shoot down the helicopter? Yes. One heat-seeking missile goes astray, so does the next one! But a small helicopter succeeds in shooting Murphy's ship. The TV station plays that tape and learns who is stirring up trouble! Who benefits from a riot that can be suppressed with military force? [Don't they ever run short of ammunition or fuel?] The pursuit helicopter is forced down. ""Catch you later."" A freight train demolishes that helicopter. The death of that Commissioner is reopened due to this new evidence. [Where will it lead?]

There are better action films. This depends too much on a mechanical item to its story. The personal conflicts between a municipal employee and Federal agents seem too contrived for me. It does provide a warning against Federal involvement with civilian authorities. Was this based on some policy in the 1980s? In 1867 the Supreme Court banned military involvement (martial law) in municipal affairs when there was no rebellion.",1373760000,2,2912,4.973305954825462

I mean, silent mode and turbine boost? So realistically done too. Now, I just chuckle at how foolish I was having watched the movie again. Naturally, it wasn't quite as fun as when I watched it many years ago, still, it had some pretty nifty aerial combat sequences featuring some very low flying urban chase scenes and special effects that were way too good for its time.

Roy Scheider is as cool as a cucumber, Warren Oates is is grizzled best (""when you're walking on eggs, don't hop!""), Malcom McDowell overplays his slimy villain to great effect and both Candy Clark and Daniel Stern - while their characters are slightly annoying - are truly believable. Add to this a great screenplay buy the brilliant Dan O'Bannon (who wrote ""Alien""). Then add the unfortunate fact that surveillance technology has been getting more and more intrusive since this film was released and you have quite a film.

There's a shocking scene in the TV series ""Mad Men"" where a '60s family pack up after a picnic and simply dump all their trash out on a beautiful green lawn. Times change, huh?

I thought about that when our hero Frank Murphy, a police helicopter pilot played by Roy Scheider, saved himself by tricking the bad guys into firing missiles into a crowded barbecue joint and a high-rise office tower, and again when he shot up a civilian apartment building while trying to take aim on a bad guy in another chopper. This was particularly grating since Murphy had earlier spoken against the bad guys' low regard for civilian lives.

Forget the characters. Forget the plot. They will only annoy you. This movie is stunt porn, pure and simple, and given that it was made before the era of computerized special effects, we have to respect the ingenuity, skill and courage of Hollywood stunt people.

The movie is dumb, but entertaining. Lots of stuff gets blowed up real good, and helicopters are cooool. If you want more than that, you'll want to look elsewhere.",1252108800,2,1184,4.623809523809523

Blue Thunder. In a nutshell, he and his JAFO (Daniel Stern) take the helicopter for a nice evening flight and stumble across a disturbing plot by Thunder's THOR organization (led by Frank's Vietnam War enemy, Malcolm McDowell), which is to use Blue Thunder for much more than what was intended for this helicopter (police surveillance and riot-control).

28375,4,0767817648,"During the early 1980's, Americans were treated with vehicles that sported the latest futuristic technology.  For cars, there was ""Knight Rider"".  For motorcycles, there was ""Street Hawk"".  And in 1983, people were captivated by a helicopter known as ""Blue Thunder"".

The film was directed by world renown director John Badham (""Saturday Night Fever"" and ""WarGames"") and feature a screenplay by Dan O'Banon (""Alien"" films and ""Total Recall"") and Don Jakoby (""Vampires"" and ""Death Wish 3'), music by Arthur B. Rubinstein (""Double Jeopardy"" and ""Face Value"") and cinematography by John A. Alonzo (""Star Trek: Generations"", ""The Meteor Man"" and ""Internal Affairs"").

""BLUE THUNDER"" would star Roy Scheider (""SeaQuest DSV"", ""Jaws"" and ""The French Connection) as LAPD helicopter pilot Officer Frank Murphy.  Together with his new rookie partner Officer Richard Lymangood (Daniel Stern), while the two were patroling Los Angeles through the air, they happen to come across on what appeared to be a robbery attempt on city councilwoman Diane McNeely.

Unfortunately, before they arrived near the city councilwoman's area, the two were using their helicopter to observe a woman working out nude in her home.  But also, due to previous situations, Officer Frank Murphy is due for a psychological evaluation.  In fact, Murphy tends to use his stop watch to make sure that his mind is thinking straight (despite having nightmares of a Vietnamese soldier being thrown off a helicopter that he was piloting).

While meeting with his superior, Captain Jack Braddock (Warren Oates), the LAPD is calling the situation of the councilwoman as a theft and rape incident but Officer Murphy knows that there was no rape but his superior doesn't want to hear anything further from Murphy and relieves both him and Lymangood as pilots for the LAPD temporarily.

But the good news for Murphy and Lymangood is that they will be able to test out an advanced helicopter known as ""Blue Thunder"".  Using the latest in weapons armament and stealth technology, the ""Blue Thunder"" can listen to any conversation as far as 200 ft., armed with machine guns, able to video/audio record outside incidents and also to be tied into various government and law enforcement computers and much more.  The bad news is that the person that is heading the operation for ""Blue Thunder"" is US Army Colonel F.E. Cochrane (Malcolm McDowell) who is the primary test pilot of the new helicopter.  Both Murphy and Cochrane end up crossing paths and because of their past history, Murphy despises him for a reason unknown.

While on the first night testing the ""Blue Thunder"" in Los Angeles, both Murphy and Lymangood are just in awe of the capabilities of the helicopter.  But the two end up using the equipment to spy on Cochrane for the fun of it but what they hear is a shocker.  Because of this, Murphy and Lymangood become a target.  Can Murphy and Lymangood survive long enough to stop the people behind Project THOR?

VIDEO & AUDIO:

For those who are big fans of ""BLUE THUNDER"", you will be happy to know that the film is given a magnificent transfer on Blu-ray.  The film is presented in 1080p High Definition (with an aspect ratio of 2:40:1) and having seen this film and having it on VHS and DVD, I can tell you that this is the definitive version to own.

For one thing, for a 1983 film, the film just looks great.  The film offers a stark contrast between the day and nighttime sequences and there is a broad spectrum of colors utilized throughout the film.  I didn't notice any significant artifacting, banding or source noise.  I was so happy to see this film not DNR'd (digital noise reduction) and the grain of the film included but not to the point where its too distracting.  There are far many 1980's films that are too soft or too grainy and this film is just right.

As for the audio, ""BLUE THUNDER"" is presented with an English and French Dolby TrueHD 5.1 soundtrack.  It's important to emphasize that this film is a 1983 film and can't be compared to today's modern action films.  But  yet, the soundtrack is utilized quite well.  The helicopters rotors spinning, to the echoes of the megaphone, the many explosions and the musical score just coming out quite clear (and loud).  Dialogue remains crisp and clear and overall, there is a good amount of action scenes that utilize the explosions and thus filling the soundstage with automobile and aircraft sounds and machine guns galore.  I was very impressed by the soundtrack for this 26-year-old film.

As for subtitles, the film is presented in English, English SDH and French.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""BLUE THUNDER"" comes with the following special features (featured in standard definition):

  * Director, Editor and Motion Control Supervisor Commentary - The Blu-ray includes the 2006 DVD Special Edition commentary featuring Director John Badham, Editor Frank Moriss and motion-control supervisor Hoyt Yeatman.  For those who have never heard of a Badham commentary, Badham is very concise and definitely gives you a peak through his mind of directing and is quite thorough on explaining how this film was created.  It's important to note that these days, a lot of these scenes would be CGI'd but back then, the chase scenes between helicopters were done without CG.  So, it was a challenging and risky film to direct.
  * ""The Special"": Building Blue Thunder: Making-of the Helicopter - (8:23) Director John Badham, Sydney Z. Litwack (Art Director) and staff from the film discuss the making of the Blue Thunder helicopter and how the concept was created.
  * Ride With The Angels: Making Blue Thunder - Multi-part Featurette - (44:41) This making of featurette discuss the Director John Badham and his involvement with the film.  Badham and producers talk about the talent they worked with in the film and what they added to the film.  Also, how talented Warren Oates was in the film but passed away a month after the film stopped shooting.  Discussion about the storyboards, Roy Scheider talks about his excitement of riding in the aircraft and Malcolm McDowell's fear of flying.  Also, how a lot of the explosions and destructive scenes were created.
  * 1983 Promotional Featurette - (8:34) The original 1983 featurette featuring clips from the film, behind-the-scenes footage and interviews with the talent of the film.
  * BD-Live Enabled - For those with Blu-ray players that are Profile 2.0, this Blu-ray disc is BD-Live enabled.

JUDGMENT CALL:

When I was younger, I was totally enamored with this film and also the helicopter television shows (""Airwolf"" and ""Blue Thunder"") at the time.  Typically, we never really saw a helicopters as a mean, fighting machine.  But ""BLUE THUNDER"" really gave us a glimpse of modern technology at that time.

It has been 26 years since this film came out in the theaters and watching it again, its easy to be shocked of how much of this film featured actual helicopters flying through Los Angeles and of course, how the destruction of parts in Los Angeles was shown through this film.  Surprising because now in Post 9/11, these type of films will never be created in this manner and nor would we see aircraft going at it like this and if it did, it would be CGI.

But it's just remarkable to know how much went into the filming of ""Blue Thunder"" without the use of today's modern technology.  How the talents (Scheider and McDowell) actually were in the helicopters being filmed during the air battles and also, the overall destruction of parts of Los Angeles.  There is no way we are ever going to see this type of destruction in this manner in a film, especially how it was created.

For the most part, the film shows its age through the various vehicles and clothing styles of the early 80's but the Blu-ray transfer really brings out the detail of the film.  One of the problems of the Special Edition DVD is that the film looked soft and muddy but for the Blu-ray release, I was impressed by its High Definition transfer.  Also, combined with the lossless audio and the fact that audio is a big part of this action film, it made the film much more enjoyable.  And where many 1980's film are devoid of special features for their DVD or Blu-ray release, the good news is that this special edition of ""BLUE THUNDER"" does come with a few hours of special features.

Overall, ""BLUE THUNDER"" is an awesome release on Blu-ray.  The release is quite solid with its impressive on HD and its easy to recommend this film but also, I'm quite confident to say that this is the definitive version of ""BLUE THUNDER"" to own at this current time.

For fans of this film, this Blu-ray release is definitely recommended!",1249948800,56,8678,4.8604492852280465

Anything shown on TBS and TNT has commercials of  upcoming programming  popping up every two seconds at the corner of the tv screen, is the worst thing these days. Thank the gods for home video, dvd & blu-ray etc. BLUE THUNDER is one of those forgotten treasures and what a joy it is to watch on a big sceen tv, letterboxed, and with full stereo.  A great action thriller that could have fit well with those great paranoid political thrillers of the 70's (released in 1983). Roy Scheider in one of his best roles upstaged lovingly by an urban-assault-helicopter. Underneath all the action is a social statement of urban crime and who controls it. It's a shame that the tv-series (starring James Farentino & Dana Carvey) didn't do as well.",1234742400,,853,4.598684210526316

28380,4,0767817648,"Roy Scheider passed away on February 10, 2008. He was an actor who's presence always added greatly to any production. This is certainly the case with Blue Thunder, which would have had less of an impact without his performance.

The 80's were a great time for big ""B-MOVIES"". Blue Thunder plays like an episode of the A-Team or Knight Rider on steroids. If you like your action films with an 80's ""escapist"" style, then Blue Thunder will deliver the goods.

Those who are put off by nudity or strong language may be surprised by some of the content. So be warned if you have only seen the edited TV version.

If you enjoy this film, seek out the short lived TV series, also available on DVD. The character of Frank Murphy (Scheider) is replaced by Frank Chaney (James Farentino). The Character of Richard Lymangood (Daniel Stern) was changed to Clinton Wonderlove (Dana Carvey, in an early starring role).

Make sure you get this ""special edition"" and not the older DVD version. Lots of good special features!

An equally fitting choice to go along with this would be ""War Games"", which came out the same year and shared John Badham as the director.  What this and ""War Games"" have in common and don't have in common with ""Firefox"" or this reviewer is a distrust of our government.

There are other things I didn't like about ""Blue Thunder"".  It had unnecessary R-rated language.  It had some sensuality that may entertain some, but it did not help me relate to or root for the characters.

I will say that it did include Roy Sheider, who has always been one of my favorite actors.  Additionally, it introduced me to Daniel Stern, who I liked better in the ""Home Alone"" movies.  Furthermore, it was an exciting thriller, with good (though sometimes improbable) action.

I'll close by commenting that it may be Badham saw or read ""Firefox"", and liked the concept of a super flying machine, but not liking the Russians being the bad guys, and remade the story to be more sleazy and to make the U.S. the villains.  Too bad.",1169078400,,1111,4.61734693877551

28388,3,0767817648,"This Special Edition turned out to be not so special after all. Okay, the new transfer is better looking than the previous release. But the movie itself remains the same old version, missing a good bit of the car chase which, for some reason, was included in European copies but was never shown in the US.

The missing part - check it out on imdb - takes place when Roy Scheider's wife, rushing to the TV studio with the tape, drives into a back alley with patrol cars on her tail: there, she skids into a wall on two wheels, bangs the roof of her car, then resumes her crazy run as the patrol cars slam into each other - and this is what makes Scheider wince from his chopper above.

Apart from leaving aside a nice piece of stunt work, this cut also accounts for a continuity loophole, when we see the car drive into the TV studio parking lot with a badly battered rooftop.

Granted, this missing part is no big deal, but it certainly makes this so-called 'Special Edition' a bit of a disappointment.

28402,4,0767817648,"There seems to be some differing opinions with regards to the picture presentation on this DVD release of the movie Blue Thunder (1983).  I just bought the Region One DVD, and it only has the fullscreen format (1:33:1), and is a singled-sided disc.  Perhaps some reviewers purchased the foreign market DVD release, which apparently has both the widescreen and fullscreen formats.  Now I have heard rumors that Sony is planning a Special Edition release of this film in the future, but then again, I hear a lot of things, and only about half are true...co-written by Don Jakoby (The Philadelphia Experiment), Dan O'Bannon (Alien), and Dean Riesner (Das Boot), and directed by John Badham (Saturday Night Fever, WarGames), the film stars Roy Scheider (Jaws, Sorcerer), Warren `Quaker' Oates (Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia, Stripes), Daniel `no relation to Howard' Stern (Home Alone, City Slickers), and Candy Clark (American Graffiti, Amityville 3-D).  Also appearing is Paul Roebling (The End of August), David Sheiner (The Gong Show Movie), Joe Santos (""The Rockford Files""), and perennial screen villain Malcolm McDowell (A Clockwork Orange, Time After Time).

Scheider plays Officer Frank Murphy, an ex-Vietnam helicopter pilot, prone to flashbacks, who now works for the Astro Division for the LAPD, assisting ground units from the sky to keep the mean streets of L.A. safe for us civilians.  As the film begins, Murphy's saddled with a new partner, Officer Richard Lymangood (Stern), a goofus type, and the two proceed to show us the value of air support in law enforcement as they assist in catching a few violent punks, when they're not peeping at a nekkid contortionist.  During their watch, a local politician, a mayoral appointee to the commission on urban violence, is assaulted.  The attack is written off as a random act of violence, but Murphy's not convinced.  After Murphy and his partner are grounded for some aerial shenanigans, their flight status is re-instated so they may participate in a gooberment program testing a prototype helicopter, one which features plenty of after-market modifications like thick armor, a forward mounted 20-millimeter electric cannon capable of firing 4,000 rounds per minute (hoo-ya), infrared night/heat vision capabilities, sophisticated eavesdropping equipment, turbine booster, whisper mode operation, and more.  Turns out an old war acquaintance of Murphy's is also involved in the program, that of Colonel Cochrane (McDowell), and the two don't get along (Cochrane's played up as an uppity a-hole).  During a test flight, Murphy and Lymangood accidentally on purpose catch wind of the true nature of the project (if it's tied to the gooberment, you know it must be evil), and the link to the now deceased politician, using the state-of-the-art surveillance equipment on the Blue Thunder, and have now become liabilities as those parties responsible will do whatever it takes to keep their plans secret, including murder...

The story might be predictable and even thin in a few places, but I thought the film, overall, was a lot of fun, and the pacing pretty tight.  One thing the movie features a lot of are spectacular aerial shots of helicopters in action, highlighted by some excellent musical scoring, which made me long for the widescreen format to really experience the full on excitement of these sequences.  The actual helicopter did look a bit awkward, especially when compared to the much slicker, shinier one featured in the ""Airwolf"" television series, released a year later, but it was still pretty cool.  As far as the characters, they seemed secondary to the whirly bird, but then that's usually the case in movies or television shows like this featuring a high tech whizzbang (how many people watched ""Knight Rider"" for David Hasselhoff's stellar performances?)...I thought Scheider, along with most of the others, did well enough, the real standout for me being Oates, as Captain Jack Braddock, Murphy's gruff, no nonsense superior.  I've always dug on the Oates, and he fit his role here perfectly.  It's a character I've seen countless times in other films, that of the supervisor stuck between a maverick type subordinate and his uptight, establishment superiors, complete with scene involving Oates' character stating how his behind has been chewed off for his subordinate's antics, but Oates seems to pull it off better than most.  And then there's Stern's character of Lymangood...seemed his only point in the film was to provide a plot device, which he did, before his departure.  As far as McDowell, he plays the villain role well, due to the fact he's played it so many times, but he seemed just a bit too smarmy here for my tastes.  A toned down, less obvious characterization would have come across a little better, in my opinion.  I did like the aspect of the story that involved the initially unintentional use of the Blue Thunder against those who sanctioned the program, the irony of using the sophisticated machine against those who developed it, in terms of exposing their surreptitious (and evil) plans, but I thought it odd the gooberment, fully understanding the capabilities of the aircraft, not having some sort of built in safeguard in case it should fall into the wrong hands.  How hard would it have been to install a secretive, remote detonation device within the machine?  Not very, but then we probably wouldn't have had much of a film.  I suppose I could go on and on being all nit picky and such, but, as I said before, I really liked this film, but I thought it was relatively well put together, despite the preponderance of clichs.  This is more or less an action film, and works the way it's supposed to...the best scenes are loaded up on the back end of the film, as Murphy, hunted by the authorities (after the gooberment spooks purposely attribute some of their underhanded activities to a now renegade Murphy), steals Blue Thunder and has to face off against two F-16 fighter jets.  Seems like an uneven match, but keep in mind, a helicopter is a lot more versatile in a cityscape environment than jet aircraft, and Murphy, being the experienced pilot he is, uses this to his advantage.

As I mentioned earlier, my DVD is single-sided, and features only the fullscreen format, which looked decent but could have been better (I did notice a little dust on the print in a few scenes, but overall, the picture was relatively clean).  The Dolby Digital 2.0 audio came through well enough.  Extra features for this release are sparse, including an original theatrical trailer and some material on the DVD case insert in terms of comments from the crew about the film.  A solid four stars for the film, and two and a half for the lacking release.

28405,4,0767817648,"As a boy growing up in the 80's, this was just about as cool as it got this side of Star Wars.  Although my tastes have become somewhat more sophisticated over the years, I still enjoy a well-crafted action movie, and this certainly qualifies.  Although the movie at times becomes campy due to overacting or poorly choreographed action sequences (hey, Badham didn't have $150M to work with, OK?) the movie's themes regarding the dangers of advanced technology as a tool of repression and protection of the homeland against terrorists still ring true.  And besides, the helicopter is still really cool, even if the cockpit is reminiscent of Knight Rider's KITT (another 80's must).
Technically, the film is quite good overall.  Especially in the chase scenes, one gets the feeling that Badham and his crew spent hundreds of hours in the air to get the quality and quantity of footage necessary to pull this movie off.  The editing, however, leaves something to be desired at times, particularly the ADR, which on numerous occasions does not appear to match the actors' mouth movements.  Otherwise, however, the film is masterful, especially considering the technology used to edit it at the time.
If you are looking for high art, look elsewhere.  If you are looking for Matrix-like special effects, look elsewhere.  If you are looking for an entertaining action movie from the Reagan era, you're in the right place.",1053993600,15,1414,4.987234042553191
28406,5,0767817648,"BLUE THUNDER is an outstanding action film that holds its own, and even surpasses some of today's Hollywood escapists fare.
The futuristic premise concerning the ominous prospect of the L.A. police experimenting with military hardware in preparation for the Olympics is even more profound in this day and age then it was twenty years ago.
The hero, played by veteran actor Roy Scheider of Jaws fame, is an L.A. police helicopter pilot assigned to test pilot an experimental attack helicopter. Later he becomes disturbed by the implications of the department using such a monstrous attack vehicle in an urban setting. Which puts him at odds with the projects secret sponsors.
Blue Thunder does an excellent job of combining elements of the action genre with the police thriller. Famed N.Y. film critic Pauline Kael described the film as ""elegantly kicky"" and that John Alonzo's night time cinematography gave the film's night shots ""a psychedelic, futuristic quality like (the film) Alphaville."" Alonzo's hard photography does give the night scenes on the DVD a particularly radiant and atmospheric mood.
The film's only few setbacks are mainly in the first half. After a great, documentary like opener, the plot shifts into low gear. And only glosses over the intrigue and socio-political implications when it would've fared much better had it delved deeper into them. Like in one clever scene at a military demonstration site.
Fortunately, by the middle of the film things take a turbo charged turn as the hero and his side-kick uncover the sinister goings on and are forced to take drastic action. The aerial combat scenes are exhilirating. While the car chases on the ground provide an amusing counterpoint to an action convention.
All in all, a great DVD. Providing great acting, an intriguing premise and thrilling action.",1046217600,2,1827,5.154882154882155
28407,4,0767817648,"""Blue Thunder"" is an experimental police helicopter planned to keep LA safe by the time the Olympics come to town (this flick came out a year or two before the '84 Summer games).  Clothed in armour plating, boosted by powerul, turbo-charged engines, and carrying a 20MM rotary cannon in her nose, Blue Thunder is a two-man, flying SWAT team.  Muscle aside, the chopper also bristles with sophisticated surveillance gear centered around a computer that can hook into any other mainframe in America.  Though Thunder has been evaluated throroughly by the US Army, the authorities want one of LAPD's own pilots to test-fly the chopper across LA's skies.
The pilot, however, is Murphy (Scheider), a burnt-out flier who drove gunships for the army in Vietnam.  After catching a dazzling demonstration of Blue Thunder's power (on a mockup town full of white and red dummies symbolizing by-standers and terrorists), Murphy learns that the army's chief test-pilot is FE Cochrane (McDowell, keeping a lot of his accent despite playing an army colonel), his commander in Vietnam, and a brutal sadist.  Cochrane aside, Murphy has other problems - mostly involving unfavorable psych evals, and a suspension resulting from their failure to support cops in the ground in a botched attempt to save the life of a controversial city politician.  Nevertheless cleared to fly the chopper, Murphy and LAPD flight observer Lymangood (Daniel Stern) fly outside their assigned plan and, using the chopper's electronic gear against its developers, learn of their darker intentions for the super chopper (without giving away anything, let's just say that this flick has some strangely prophetic ideas on the ""Homeland Security"" issue).  Recording proof against Blue Thunder's developers, and hoping to hold out long enough for his girlfriend to contact the media with proof that will ground Blue Thunder for good, Murphy hijacks the chopper and finds himself targeted by everybody.  Other cops and the USAF soon find their hardware isn't enough against Murphy, meaning that Cochrane himself will have to finish the job, setting the stage for an epic low-level chopper-dogfight among the city streets of LA, looking sort of like a car chase from one of those 70's cop shows, only using helicopters instead of that ""Gran Torino"".
""Blue Thunder"" is an excellent movie.  The flight scenes are fantastic, the special effects are great and everything is held together by an edgy electronic score and cinematography taht highlights the story's paranoia (if you saw ""The Insider"", you've got the idea).  More than that is how much fun the characters have with their roles - the light banter between Stern and Scheider and Warren Oates (as Murphy's boss) keeps things going until we actually get to see the super-chopper in action.  Even then, the script builds up to Cochrane and Murphy's battle-royale, straps you in and never lets go.",1038355200,,2902,5.153191489361702
