8592452,5,B0002SBER8,"Guyanese comedy--What I appreciated most of all about Tickle me 'till meh laff, is not so its comedy, although there was plenty of that to go around, but the overall effort by all the actors and Director/Producer. Given the size of their small (non-hollywood) budjet, this was a remarable achievment. Producer/Director Roxanne De Cruiz did a remarkable job, given the size of the small budjet she was given to work with and Golden ArrowHead Productions deserves nothing but Kudos and our support for being Guyana's fist serious motion picture company. They actually have another production: A Tropical Adventure (Guyana Ecotours) which like Tickle me 'till meh laff, is also available on Amazon.com in both DVD and VHS format. A must-have!------This review is excerpted from Caribbean Diary Magazine and is written by its Assistant Editor, Nadia de Frietas.",1116115200,,857,5.262773722627737
