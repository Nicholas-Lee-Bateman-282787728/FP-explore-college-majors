7798608,5,1573676446,"Rhon explains tunisian crochet stitches and colorwork techniques very clearly.  Unfortunately, when he demonstrated the stitches, he picked a dark color yarn that made it difficult to see the stitches and worked rather quickly which also made it a bit difficult to follow.  Since this is a dvd, you can play the segments over and over until you 'get' it.  Still, watching the video is easier than trying to follow written directions, at least until you learn the techniques. Besides the instructional dvd, also included is a cd with the class patterns that can be printed.",1490140800,,572,4.9375
