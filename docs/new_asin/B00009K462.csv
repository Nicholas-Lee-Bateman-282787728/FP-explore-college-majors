7990922,5,B00009K462,Well done. Filmed in Umbria.  Taken from Daniel Spoto's biography of Francis of Assisi. Not a Hollywood version with Donovan singing in the background.,1314403200,,151,5.291666666666667
7990923,5,B00009K462,"There are many disappointing books and films about Francis and Franciscan spirituality.  This film, based on Spoto's biography of Francis, isn't one of them.  It offers a wonderful introduction to the Poverello of Assisi, beautiful to the eye and illuminating to the heart and mind.  Replete with the usual breathtaking Assisi scenary one finds in films about Francis, this documentary also provides a sensitive interpretation of what Francis was up to, what values he represented, and what kind of lifestyle he lived and, by example, taught.  With the aid of interpretive commentary from experts such as Murray Bodo and Bernard McGinn (as well as, rather oddly, from nonexperts such as Mario Cuomo), the film honestly explores Francis's sense of failure towards the end of his life and the extraordinary experience on Mt. Alverna that enabled him to reexamine his life's work and find peace with it.  Throughout the film there are several contentious interpretations given as fact--the claim that Francis suffered from leprosy, for example--but overall, a fine and commendable addition to the growing body of work on Francis.  Highly recommended!",1073001600,16,1147,5.30939226519337
