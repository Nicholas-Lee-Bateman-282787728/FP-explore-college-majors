8144086,5,B000I5XMM0,This is a beautiful woman with a voice to match. She's not an artist that does a lot of dancing while singing but then again she doesn't need to. I think she has one of the purest sounding voices I've ever heard and most of the songs are excellent. Most of the songs are ballads and pop along with a few entertaining rock songs from the movie she made.,1480464000,,352,4.115942028985507
