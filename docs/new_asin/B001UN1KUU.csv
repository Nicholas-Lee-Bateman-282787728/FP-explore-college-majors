Back is the endearing homemaker Donna, her pediatrician husband Alex, and their teenagers Mary and Jeff. This edition contains a whopping 38 episodes of the finest of 1950's television Americana.  Many episodes contains comedic family moments while others embrace tender occasions as well.  A fine complement to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Donna-Reed-Show-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B001CO42LQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Donna Reed Show: The Complete First Season</a>.

Both seasons of The Donna Reed Show are super family friendly; recommended without reservation for all!

UPDATE: 07.27.09

With this second season release, you will find the same quality from Season 1.  The audio is crisp and the video has nice gray-scale resolution with just a minimum of artifactual trash.  Oddly the episodes are numbered as a continuation from Season One with the first episode of Season Two being numbered #38 and so on.  New with this set is a black plastic clam-shell housing all 4 discs on 2 swing brackets.  An insert page on the front shell lists episode titles with original air dates; Disc 1 & 2 on one side and Disc 3 & 4 on the flip side.  Also new this season are picture discs with Donna, Alex, Mary and Jeff on Discs 1, 2, 3 & 4.

In all another wonderful release with just a few cosmetic changes.

UPDATE: 08.21.09

I spotted a little boo boo with Episode S.2.09 (46) co-starring Marion Ross.  Only trouble is the end credits are from Season 1.37.  But that's okay with me as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Donna-Reed-Show-Season-3/dp/B002JODUES/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Donna Reed Show: Season 3</a>&nbsp;is is out now with Season 4 due out around Mother's Day of 2010.  Kudos to Virgil Films And Entertainment with a quick roll out:)  Nothing like the mess from CBS/Paramount.  One other little anomaly is during the opening credits on all episodes, the phone rings, Donna picks up and speaks and another ring is heard.  I think it just adds a little character to the show:)

UPDATE: 09.09.09

Regarding the bonus features, one is an Original Production Still Publicity Photo Gallery displayed to the tune of Debussy's Arabesque #1; most apropos!",1236211200,13,2507,6.0625

Having just watched some old episodes, I realized how life has become so much more complicated, and the problems today are not solved with one line answers.  This show was very nostalgic for me, and I am going to watch the first 2 seasons all the way through.

Watching this again reminded me or how the worst things you could do in high School was chew gum, smoke or be in the halls.m now days it is drugs, sex and guns.  Watch Donna Reed and enjoy a simpler time.  :)",1397174400,2,526,4.117647058823529

I hear that Season 2 is a bit blurry on DVD also. IF there's a demand at this high price, imagine how many would sell at a more reasonable price? I WON'T be buying the first 2 seasons until the price comes down. I like owning the DVDs so I don't want to just Netflix the set....This is a luxury, not a necessity. I have a feeling that the more expensive first 2 seasons don't really sell very often, but no one wants to take the leap and try pricing them where they will sell....Supply and demand should control the price, but it seems all of the sellers want to hold back for a killing by a stupid buyer.

3803305,2,B001UN1KUU,"For content alone, this would be 5 stars. But Virgil's release of this is amazingly bad, it's like watching TV with Vaseline smeared over your eyes. The DVD opening promo for Virgil is annoyingly amateurish, there were better graphics on the very first VHS tapes. And be sure to mute the sound, this part of the DVD will blast you out of your living room it's so loud.

The ending of each show cuts off abruptly as well, fading out before the Screen Gems credits even though this is an integral part of the closing. I only didn't give Season 2 a ""1"" rating as the DVDs all play okay, the show is just of low quality playback and offensively butchered by Virgil. I still recommend buying it, just know in advance the experience will be somewhat marred by poor production values.

The good news is it's a whole new ballgame when MPI takes over the show for Season 4. The video and audio won't be mistaken for Blu-ray but it's a hundred times better than Season 2. And best of all not only is the Screen Gems closing credit fully intact, you also get some original commercials and some sponsor graphics on the credits for many of the episodes.",1379808000,,1140,4.423809523809524

3803308,5,B001UN1KUU,The Donna Reed show was a favorite of mine from the 50's and 60's.  I used to watch it all the time.  The characters and acting and stories are funny and very good.,1369094400,,164,3.9393939393939394

3803310,5,B001UN1KUU,I love the old shows and Donna Reed was one of the best.  The writing and acting far surpasses anything out there today.  Warm and humerous without the modern day filth.  I would highly recommend these shows.,1349740800,,208,4.5675675675675675
3803311,5,B001UN1KUU,Just finished watching all the episodes and will definitely have to purchase Season 3.  What a wonderful show.  Donna Reed one was of my favorite actresses.  They just looked like the were really a family.  If you haven't seen this show it's well worth buying. I would recommend this.  It's a great family show with good clean entertainment.,1329868800,,341,4.810344827586207
3803312,5,B001UN1KUU,"Though the Donna Reed Show would probably be scorned these days for its lack of sex, drugs, rock n' roll, and political correctness, this show is the essence of all-American goodness and purity.  The spanking clean family values exhibited here in all their crystalline glory are out of date, true...but oh so sweet.  Corny and silly too, but awfully loveable and amusing.  Not out and out hysterically funny, but loaded with hometown comfort and clever verve...entertaining and uplifting and, despite 50 years down the pike, not dry or withered at all.  Adorably addictive to the point of excess, the Donna Reed Show makes for a fine evening sitting by the fire, as you savor a taste of good taste.  You're watching a museumpiece, true, but one that rings with simple truths now so long gone. As for the beauty of it, I'd say Donna is just about the loveliest mother I've ever seen, bar none.  A fantasy worth owning up to, because watching this show may help you beat depression, sadness, ennui, pain, or anything else that ails you.",1304380800,6,1034,4.748603351955308

Wouldn't it be great to go back to a time when life was simple? Of course, we'd be without computers, but there are time I think it'd be worth it.
Since we can't rewind our lives, the next best thing is watching a family in that time frame.
Donna Reed 2 is a great show. The picture and sound suits me fine. Excellent quality.
I've noticed some say the picture is grainy..maybe those of you who feel this way watched reruns on TVLand. For those who lived in the 50's and 60's watched TV shows with lines, spots, all types of blemishes. lol.

My only gripe is, I wish there each disk had Special Features..Bloopers would be fantastic. Interviews. Perhaps later versions will have them..Let's hope.",1276819200,,721,4.5038167938931295

3803319,5,B001UN1KUU,"The Donna Reed Show Second Season doesn't dissapoint.  This season is just as good as season one.  Life situations don't change, just styles.  There is something to learn in each episode.  Black and white is very relaxing on the eyes and has a calming influence.  The background music is also very calming after a stressful day.  For me one very important takeaway for moms is Alex Stone's reassurance that it is by making mistakes that children learn. Stressful but true. Because of the design of the show, a different character is featured in each show.  It isn't just about children, or adults. This way it has something for everyone.
It is a truly great show!",1253923200,,663,4.71304347826087

I wouldn't know if they have been edited or if this does the original episodes any justice because I am seeing them for the first time but I can tell you they are of great quality and they seem to be complete.  I highly recommend them for first timers and for old original fans.",1253318400,,500,4.05050505050505

3803322,4,B001UN1KUU,"I bought the second season of the Donna Reed show because when the series was first brought back by Nick at Nite in the late 80s I was immediately hooked.  What a sweet simple show with believable characters portrayed by great actors old and young.  My only gripe about the second season is the packaging.  I love the principle stars' faces on the discs, but why a clam box?  The first season packaging was perfect.  However, I will buy the rest of the seasons even if they come in a crumpled paper bag.",1251158400,3,503,4.365591397849462
3803323,3,B001UN1KUU,"The shows themselves are great.  There are some quality issues for the manufacturer.

I am grateful to this company for putting out both the first and second seasons of ""The Donna Reed Show"", as this was a favorite growing up.  Doubt that Sony or Shout! Factory would do the honors, though Shout! did do another Screen Gems classic in the first three seasons thus far of ""Father Knows Best"".  Granted, the programs have not had all the polish they could have, but they are not horrible copies being used either.  All shows are enjoyable to watch.  My negative points go towards the opening credits and the music & effects being out of sync, and no chapter markers per show where the commercial inserts should go.  If I have to stop watching at a point, I don't like to fast forward through back to where I left off.  It is easier to have chapter markers per show to take you to a segment, then if you have to fast forward a little, that's fine.  Not the whole show.  The opening credits seem to be ahead visually than what you are hearing with the theme song.  Donna is already having a conversation on the phone & ready to call Dr. Alex to it, with the phone still ringing.  For the closing credit, after a Todon-Briskin or a Todon production, it cuts off, and doesn't give the Screen Gems insignia.  Shout! did this on the first season of Father Knows Best, but corrected for Seasons 2 & 3.  Does Virgil not want to give credit where credit is due, or does Sony not want this on the reissues since they are not doing it themselves?  Before Season 3 arrives later this year, Virgil Films needs to take some of these constructive criticisms into mind, so future seasons are a little better presented.",1250467200,11,1700,4.456310679611651
3803324,3,B001UN1KUU,"First of all, it's good to see this series finally make it to DVD by someone because Sony doesn't do much with classic television and they have a ton of it with the old Columbia and Ziv United Artists shows etc.(Rescue 8, Dennis the Menace, Highway Patrol, Sea Hunt etc.) unless it's in color and has always been around, but this show should have been fully remastered with the original titles in tact. The same main title is on every episode and the end credits cut short before the Screen Gems logo and what true collector want's to buy a show in that condition. Yes, it's cost's money to do a full remaster, but it's the only way to preserve these shows for generations to come. Before the masters go bad and then you have nothing. Everyone looks too much at the bottom line anymore and not enough at true quality and continuaty. At least 80 percent of the people who buy these shows are collectors and they want to see these shows as they originally aired. commercials, next week previews, logo's etc. CBS/Paramount is doing a better job in accomplishing this of late, and I hope they continue. The other guys are doing quite poorly. I respect the fact that other reviewers are appreciative that the show is out and have expressed that in there reviews but if you don't express your true feelings, the studio's will figure everything is just fine and continue down the same path. Is that what you wan't? I doubt it! Let them know!",1249430400,25,1434,4.519230769230769

3803326,5,B001UN1KUU,"I say the WONDERFUL ""Donna Reed Show"" Season 2 1959-60 because it is truly a wonderful, treasured slice of Americana in the late 1950s and heading into the early 1960s. Season 2 has some great episodes, including ""Going Steady"", ""All Mothers Worry"" (truly one of the very best and most touching of Donna Stone's comforting speeches), ""The Punishment"", ""Just A Housewife"" (Donna Stone has quite a bit to say in this episode about housewives and she is right on the money), ""Cool Cat"" and more. The kids, Mary and Jeff, are growing up and it's nice to see how they are progressing. The relationship between Dr. and Mrs. Stone is also becoming even closer and seems even more natural than Season 1.
I can hardly wait to see these episodes again. I've pre-ordered my DVD!

One message we should all kindly send to the DVD manufacturer is this: PLEASE continue to release more seasons of The Donna Reed Show. Season 3 1960-61 contains such excellent episodes as, ""The Model Daughter"" and ""The Good Guys and The Bad Guys"".
Season 4 1961-62 contains the episode which is perhaps one of the most beloved of all the seasons episodes ""Donna's Prima Donna"" aka Johnny Angel and season 5 1962-63 contains the equally excellent and touching ""My Dad"" episode.
With high quality DVDs and complete episodes, season by season, this series is destined to win the hearts of many fans both old and new.",1247875200,,1382,4.734439834024896
3803327,5,B001UN1KUU,"Much has already been written about the forthcoming second season of ""The Donna Reed Show,"" so I'll just add that this and subsequent seasons are well worth the wait for patient classic television fans like myself.

There are so many great episodes on this 1959-1960 season, that it's difficult to just touch upon a few, although I may amend this review as time goes on.

I just want to build upon how a recent reviewer mentioned how watching the show was just like watching a ""real family documentary,"" since the four main players are so comfortable with one another, etc. It's interesting to note (and also adds to the enjoyment and ""realism"" conveyed) that Donna Reed tried her best to instill a real familial, warm atmosphere on the set, which comes through in the ensemble performances.

According to Reed's main biographer, Jay Fultz, the quartet became a very close-knit surrogate family throughout the show's initial run, amd remained so when it ended. The four remained close long afterward, usually meeting once a month for lunch and turning heads in the process. They all stayed close until Betz's death of lung cancer in 1978, as well as Reed's battle with pancreatic cancer until her passing in 1986. Today, Petersen (spelled Petersen, not Peterson; I can't believe how often his name is misspelled even though he is constantly in the news) and Fabares are still like brother and sister, remaining in contact; he also went to visit her when she was recovering from her liver transplant due to an auto-immune disorder, noting his ""wild"" days of the 1960s and '70s: ""I do all the drinking and you get the liver!""

In sum, for those who love the classic era of TV, this is a well-written, well-acted, comical, and thoughtful show that was painstakingly overseen by its namesake, although her husband got most of the production credits.
However, for those willing to delve deeper into pop culture history, they will find that Reed was an underrated, uncredited ""auteur"" who oversaw almost all of the elements of the show. The result is a timeless family show that fully deserves its place among the annals of classic programs released for home media.",1244073600,3,2159,4.874659400544959
3803328,5,B001UN1KUU,"I was very fortunate to have our local library get the first Season of Donna Reed for me.  I do hope that they will continue to get each Season as it is released.

Mary Stone is now 15 and brother Jeff is now 12 years old. Mary at 15, starts to date, as the high school boys and even young college men take notice of the beautiful young woman she is becoming. There are great guest stars on these  episodes as well. The beautiful Esther Williams plays Donna's school friend Molly. And a young Marion Ross, the Happy Days mom plays Jeff's new teacher. This second season is just as wonderful as the first, as you follow life in the Stone household through the end of 1959 and halfway into 1960. Hopefully, the next six seasons will follow just as quickly as this one did, as each season just keeps getting more wonderful than the one before with such great stories and guest stars!
