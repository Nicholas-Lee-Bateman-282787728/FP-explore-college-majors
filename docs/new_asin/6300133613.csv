Not only are they all stupid and obnoxious people, but the leader screams all his lines like a certifiable lunatic. After 30 minutes of nonsense I just wanted the ""villain"" to start murdering them all... violently! I don't know why writers sometimes insist on making their protagonists insufferable dolts.",1531958400,,408,5.196969696969697

8732565,3,6300133613,"In BRIDGE TO NOWHERE, five teen Kiwis on a wilderness romp run afoul of a rural eccentric. He reacts at first by harrassing them from a distance, but things soon escalate to grisly proportions.

After scenes of skinnydipping, boombox dancing and frivolity, the carefree city kids backpack toward their goal: the so-named bridge that's set in a non-populous area. Across it and a river is land owned by ""Mac"" (Lawrence), a recluse who so resents these noisy intruders that he chases them into the forest with his shotgun and dog. Mac's intentions soon turns deadly. Totally lost and with no food, weapons or survival plan, the panicked ""game"" thrash about trying to both avoid their pursuer and relocate the river.

Lush and hilly New Zealand country plus high-octane '80s Kiwi rock distinguish this drive-in style terror trip, while a consistently shrill tone does get annoying in the last half-hour.

As of 3/09, ""Bridge to Nowhere"" was not available on DVD.
