It contains over 2 hours of instruction with 24 tricks and additional tips covering a wide range of easy magic including card, coin, mental, and everyday objects.  This is a good value for the money for any youth or adult to begin performing some really good, easy magic--with a little practice.",1384560000,,376,4.681818181818182
8319697,3,B001LT403M,"Got this as a birthday gift for my son (10).  He gets it out from time to time and takes on another trick.  He's gotten pretty good at some of 'em.  They aren't witch crafty or creepy, just simple optical illusions that do take practice and effort to learn and perform.  Only gave it 3 stars due to the price.  The video is very short and isn't much bang for the buck.",1337644800,,368,4.055555555555555
