8417515,5,B001HCT3M6,"Unique suspense film starring a young daughter of a diplomat.
Move over Nancy Drew and 007, this girl is the greatest secret agent of them all.
Patty Duke was a good actress but Kathy Dunn beats her out easily. What a great movie! Kathy Dunn was a fine young actress! Totally original idea. The plot is also unusual. Young girls (pre teens and junior high girls), will really get into this film, even though it was made in 1963! In fact, all ages would enjoy it.
Kathy Dunn it seems, had a short career for some reason, but she was a very beautiful girl and a great actress. Everyone turns in a fine performance.
Now, the color, this film has perfect color! Its a fine example of color cinema of the 1960s.
Buy it! Others besides me have given it a five star rating.",1521072000,,766,4.326388888888889

8417518,4,B001HCT3M6,"B-movie producer/director William Castle was famous for luring audiences with gimmicks.  In ""The Tingler"" staring Vincent Price, theatre seats were fitted with vibrating devices to ""tingle"" the audience; in ""13 Ghosts"" staring Donald Woods and Rosemary DeCamp, special viewers were needed to see the ghosts -- when Woods donned his special glasses, you had to put on yours.  The gimmick in ""13 Frightened Girls"" is the girls themselves.  An international talent search was conducted, or so the press release said, to find the most beautiful teenage girls from around the globe.  Lovely, they were; talented, not so much.  But it's a fun flick, nonetheless.

""Girls"" opens at Miss Pittford's Academy for Young Ladies -- a Swiss boarding school that caters to the daughters of diplomats.  The girls are on their way to London for a holiday at their various embassies.  Candace/Candy Hull (Kathy Dunn), daughter of the U.S. Ambassador to England, is the star of this movie about a teenage Mata Hari who becomes the target of a Communist Chinese spy ring.

The adult actors -- Hugh Marlowe, Murray Hamilton, Joyce Taylor, Norma Varden and Keigh Deigh (Wo Fat of ""Hawaii Five-O"") -- are all veteran character players and lend credibility to the production.  According to Hollywood lore, Castle had two goals as a filmmaker:  to make money and to have good time doing it.  Because he was affable and had a reputation for being fun to work with, Castle had no trouble attracting talent on both sides of the camera.  The film has better than average production values and is well acted despite some rather forced performances from the girls.  Only one of the teenagers in the cast, Alex played by Alexandra Bastedo, has had a successful screen career, very successful, in fact.  Kathy Dunn appeared on Broadway as Louisa in ""The Sound of Music"" a couple of years before ""Girls.""

Candy has a crush on CIA agent Wally Sanders (Hamilton) who works for her father (Marlowe).  While visiting her friend Mai-Ling (Lynn Sue Moon) at the Chinese Embassy, Candy witnesses the murder of a Russian official.  In an attempt to impress Wally, she begins gathering information that might be useful to him by listening to conversations between the other girls and to adults while visiting her classmates at their embassies.  Candy adopts the code name ""Kitten"" and sends bits and pieces of gossip anonymously to Wally.  As she hones her skills as a spy, Kitten attains international notariety in the espionage community and puts herself into mortal danger.

It's a 1963 movie so, as one might guess, all ends well, but with a substantial body count.  Fortunately or not, all of the girls survive to the closing credits.

The musical score lands somewhere between cheesy and charming; part LoonyToons and part Fats Domino.  Candy and Mai-Ling doing The Twist is a hoot.

It's probably because I'm a fan of William Castle and saw this movie as a teenager that I like it so.  But, I've shared it with friends -- many of them somewhat younger -- and it always entertains.  The hairstyles alone will bring a smile.",1313366400,8,3087,4.897880539499036
