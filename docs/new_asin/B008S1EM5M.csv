8530149,5,B008S1EM5M,"This UEFA Euro 2012 Final match between Spain and Italy is a great video and a spectacular soccer match.  Italy is a wonderful side with a great soccer tradition, but Spain seems at the top of its game and in its own world with its extraordinary ball control, confident inside and down-the-middle of the field passing, and speed. All complemented by aggressive defense that so often got the ball back from the Italian side quickly. Soccer lovers will want to have this video in their library.",1377734400,3,492,4.72093023255814
