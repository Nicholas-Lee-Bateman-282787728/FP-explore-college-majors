5688803,1,B00C2ISGOK,"This disc was a complete disappointment, as I was expecting it to be the complete first season.  There were groans and moans  all round when the disc ended after the first episode ""The Battle Begins"" (2 episodes if viewed online). We ended up buying the remaining episodes via Amazon Instant Video for $1.99 each - a much better deal.",1375056000,7,334,4.6440677966101696

8576545,3,B00C2ISGOK,"This seems to be a theme with these Lego product tv shows;  Ninjago was the same way, with 2 episodes only on a dvd, and no clear indication that's what you were getting.

My guess is that these came out to placate the Lego product-loving family before the full season was available.  As of this writing (January '14) you can download via Amazon's Instant Video feature ($1.99/episode) the whole 1st season, but the DVD of ""Season 1 Part 1"" isn't even out until January 28.

My son (age 7) loves the two episodes.  As we don't have cable and don't (yet, anyway) download videos, this is all we've got.

As for me, I'm somewhat perplexed by the whole Chima story.  Different species of animals have come to walk on two legs, with the Lions being the keepers of this ""Chi"" stuff, which they distribute to the other creatures, which apparently helps them all continue to walk and talk and do great feats and such.  When this Chi became available to them, many years ago, some of each species refused to consume it, and remained as they are here on Earth... ""legend beasts"" they are called by the Chi-consumers.  They show up every once in awhile.  The bulk of these two episodes seems to be to establish the backstory and show how each group (Lions, Crocs, Eagles and a couple others, functioning kind of like tribes I suppose) has their own characteristics and how they all try to function together in the land of Chima.  The main lion character (Laval, who inexplicably talks like a teenage surfer dude) was childhood friends with the main Croc character (Cragger) but tragedy and misunderstanding pushes them apart.  Laval is dealing with whether he wants to honor the old ways as he readies himself to eventually become the head of his tribe.

Kids shows don't have to appeal to grown-ups, of course.  I have mixed feelings about this whole thing.  It seems obvious to me that everyone should just stop eating the Chi and go back to being Legend Beasts.  But maybe I don't know enough about the show.  We'll see how it goes once we get our grubby paws on more episodes!",1390435200,,2070,4.581521739130435
8576546,3,B00C2ISGOK,"it keeps my kids busy for a while, it is a fun show to watch, just wish they had more than 2 episodes on this disc.",1390348800,,115,3.4615384615384617

8576548,5,B00C2ISGOK,"This DVD only contains the first two episodes from Season 1 of the Lego Legends of Chima cartoon. Amazon doesn't always do a good job on their DVD episode listings so here are the episodes that are included on this DVD:

1. The Legend of Chima
2. The Great Story",1384387200,14,262,4.24
