8567553,4,B00BF371IA,"I saw a Frontline episode that focused on Haiti after the earthquake.  I titled my review ""Cry Even Harder for Haiti"" because it showed that Haiti was poor, downtrodden, and corrupt before the 'quake and nothing has changed.  This work says the same thing about Colombia and the little gold it has present.  The film ""Our Lady of the Assassins"" presented Colombia as very violent and unsafe.  I had a roommate whose former roommate was Colombian and he said when a man gets home from work in Colombia, he goes outside and shoots his gun in the air to let his neighbors know that they shouldn't dare rob his home while he's present.  I think that awful Pablo Escobar may  have been from Colombia.

If poor people could make money off of gold, rather than cocaine, then that would be a good thing.  However, the government and paramilitary groups are taking over what could have helped many impoverished families.  This reminded me a lot of the African issue of blood diamonds.  Colombians are dying to find gold that is in dust form that can barely fit on a dinner plate.  The gold rush may be ruining the environment (just like the Brazilians are ruining the Amazon rainforests).

So if you want to hear tragedy after tragedy, then this work is a must-see.",1375228800,,1256,4.608108108108108
