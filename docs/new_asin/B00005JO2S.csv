Peter responds to a question from his wife with ""I don't know"" and he gets slimed. I'm getting the feeling that a lot of people didn't get that joke since no one is talking about this DVD set yet.",1120608000,5,357,4.114285714285714
1523983,5,B00005JO2S,"My big sister and I LOVED this show!! I was only 4 or 5 when I started watching it and I honestly didn't get what was going on at times but this show still made me laugh. I've recently been on a retro Nick show binge lately and sadly, many of these shows that were from the 80s and 90s are on VHS only...but who uses a VCR anymore! I'm tired of having to turn to youtube for these shows. They need to put these on DVD for crying out loud. I just bought Pete&Pete and Hey Dude!...I'm hoping they'll put shows like Welcome Freshmen, Round House, Today's Special, and YCDTOT on DVD soon! I'm 25 now but I'd still watch them! Maybe show them to my kids one day..haha. Shows these days just aren't what they used to be. It just seemed everything back then was so much more original and quirky - in a good way!",1320364800,,804,4.094936708860759
1523984,5,B00005JO2S,"Nick has released Pete and Pete, Clerissa Explains it all Hey Dude and several other classic shows however YCDTOT remains conspicuously absent from the line up of releases and however runs Nick these days is shooting themselves in the foot in not releasing the DVD.  More then a few of the episodes are to be found on Youtube and while the show is 25 years older and the jokes don't translate as well as they once did so am I and I still manage to chuckle at some of the sketches.  While none of the sketches can be called ""politically correct"" I remember finding them hilarious at the time.  Maybe there is some problem with copyright or a disagreement over how the money gets distributed or maybe the suits are worried if they release it they will step on the toes of some ""Children are people too"" advocacy group who can say?  All I know is that if the DVDs or whatever the current format is was released I would buy and so would a great many others.",1308009600,4,953,4.337078651685394

1523989,5,B00005JO2S,"You Can't Do That On Television is to TV as is Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory to Movies. Both Gene Wilder & Les Lye are remembered for their larger than life roles in video history.  Both Wonka & YCDTOTV created a world of imagination & escape for their cross continent viewers. They are both anchored in the hearts & minds of the children who once watched them regularly.  I, for one, still watch Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory on a regular basis.  Well, not every day, but a few times a year when I break from my diet.  I can only hope that I will be able to watch Les lye, ""Moose"", & the whole gang once again.  I know they are available on fan sites, but clarity and ease of view they are not.  I even own the entire series on a bad collection of dvd's.  Of course, I was still anxious to watch every episode.

Roald Dahl created such worlds as Willy Wonka. Sid & Marty Krofft created such worlds as H.R. Pufnstuff. And, Roger Price created such worlds as You Can't Do That On Television.  Charlie & the Chocolate Factory (though closr to the book) isn't the same classic.  The new Land of the Lost movie was horrible.  Though, I am looking forward to the new (but grounded in the originals) versions of Sigmund & the Sea Monsters and Pufnstuf.

1523992,5,B00005JO2S,"Do the kids of today even know where green slime came from? It came from a WONDERFUL show called ""You Can't Do That on Television!"" This was a classic show and dealt with the ""hot"" topics of the 80's -- peer pressure
(remember when they dropped the pier on Kevin Schenk's foot?), soap opera addiction (Lisa Ruddy glued to her tv set)and hard work (Moose shoveling a pile of dirt and her dad even came to help her!).

1524023,5,B00005JO2S,"I remember watching this show when I was a kid, and it's a heartwarming experience to see it today with the warm glow only nostalgia can bring about.  I used to love watching this show when I was a kid, and since my mom hated it, I wanted to watch it all the more.  Ha ha ha ...  There was a certain love for this show that a kid would feel, as the show was partially written by the cast of the show.  This is a period piece, with mullets and Magnum P.I. shorts for the boys and permed hair and blue eyeshadow for the girls.  The humor is very junior high school, but it's still clever enough to make you think you're seeing true theater, thanks to the talents of the two adults.  It's full of catch phrases (""I heard that"", ""Don't encourage him"", etc.), and of course the mystery of water and green slime being dumped on people.  What WAS the inspiration for that?

The Canadian television company that holds the rights to this must be holding back for some reason I can't fathom.  It brings back wonderful memories of watching Nickelodeon in its infancy.",1234828800,2,1056,4.319796954314721

They are in about the same condition our old home movie projection films are in, but are still a favorite.  I would marvel at a digitally remastered, high definition DVD collection.  I would put this collection somewhere amidst The Dukes of Hazzard & The A-team, H.R. Puf n stuff & Sigmund and the Sea Monsters, and Alf & Charles in Charge.

1524027,5,B00005JO2S,"I've read somewhere that the difficulty in releasing this series on DVD (and also the reason it's not aired) is that there are 30-40 some kids that were involved in this show through it's run - and they would all be due royalties from any airings/DVD releases.  Complicate this with the fact that they are mostly Canadian, and the legal loopholes become significant.  STILL, this show is a major part of the upbringing of a major population demographic, and they need to figure out a way to make it work!  Bring back YCDTOT!",1225238400,3,524,4.612903225806452
1524028,5,B00005JO2S,How could Nick not help to make this release possible is wrong.  You Can't Do That On Television helped put NICK on the map.

I grew up watching this and know that a lot of 30 somethings would love it for the nostalgia.  Most kids today probably wouldn't like and may find it outdated and not racy enough for them, but do it for us, people who knew that t.v. didn't used to be all trashy.",1221782400,5,378,4.295774647887324
1524030,5,B00005JO2S,"I just don't get it.  There must be some legality between CJOH-TV (I think that's it) and Nickelodeon that is preventing them from re-issuing this show on DVD.  Perhaps CJOH wants more money than Nickelodeon is willing to pay?  What I further don't get is: Don't either of these two companies want to make money?? There's clearly a large market of people in their 20s and 30s who are ready to scoop this show up on DVD.
A modern day revival of this show (although I can't imagine the PC police allowing a lot of the content in today's world.....children's firing squad anyone?) would be a welcome addition to the rather pathetic Nickelodeon lineup.  Perhaps it's just me, but the Nickelodeon of today has really, really gone downhill. If I were a kiddie today, it'd hardly be the network of mine. Oh well.....

1524031,5,B00005JO2S,"I absolutely agree that they need to get this put into DVD as soon as possible.  I grew up in the 80's and LOVED watching this show.  I had seen a thing on t.v. that explained why it isn't aired on t.v. as reruns, and I believe that it had something to do with having to pay residuals to all of the cast members.  As we all know, if that is true could be quite a lot of money.  Nevertheless, we need to ban together and demand these wonderful, iconic shows that have given us such joy in our childhood be put on dvd so that our future generations can enjoy them as much as we did.  Another show that I loved was ""Today's Special.""  Muffy the mouse was great with her little mouse mansion in the store.

1524107,5,B00005JO2S,"Nickelodeon has been toying with the public about releasing ths show for years now.  And, I believe it's time to release it already.  I am 31 years old and would love to have this so my kids could see what dad laughed at so hard when he was young.  And if they are anything like me, they will becomedinterested in that period of time like I was with the 60's and 70's.  Come on Nickelodeon, just release the shows already!!!!!!!",1210464000,3,428,4.3125
1524108,5,B00005JO2S,"Cable TV didn't enter my home until the end of the 80's or early '90's.  Flipping through the newly accessible channels, I chanced upon YCDTOT in a scene where a Mexican firing squad was about to execute a kid.  ""Hold it, hold it, stop the execution"" said the kid before requesting a last wish.  Capitano, the firing squad leader, agreed since it was a traditional right of the soon-to-be executed.  The kid then requested not to be shot, and the Capitano, honor-bound to comply and not shoot the kid, realized he'd been tricked, saying to the camera, ""I hate smart kids.""
  It was this brief scene that made me an instant fan of the show.  Not since OUR GANG of the 1920's and 30's have kids and adults conversed one-on-one so naturally.  And, in its own backhanded way, it was the only show to declare (at least in a long long time) that kids were smart.  (What a refreshingly original attitude to discover in a children's show!)  It spoke as kids would speak.  Its ideas of what was funny was often appreciable or even spot on.
  Having, myself, gone through a music conservatory before discovering this show, I still smile and sometimes laugh aloud every time I recall the classroom scene where Kevin Kubusheskie is asked what Beethovan is famous for, and Kevin, struggling for an answer while looking at the bust of Beethovan on the teacher's desk (obviously not having done his homework), declares boldly (and with false confidence) that ""Beethovan was a composer who....had....no arms and no legs.""
  Deeper issues sometimes resonated unexpectedly and saccinctly in brief sketches that other programs would have taken a half hour or more to tell -- and not presented as well.  (I'm thinking of little sister Amy deiberately annoying older sister Jill by horning in on her at-home movie date with potential boyfriend Chris,
only to find that Chris really liked her (Amy) better (mutually preferring horror movies to the romance films that were Jill's favorites).  This left Jill (who had nothing much in common with Chris) to call him a pig, at which Amy responded with ""I like pigs,"" and prompted Chris -- with eyes always glued to the horror movie -- to naturally swing a protective and comforting arm around Amy.)
  This was a very clever, sarcastic sketch comedy show.  Highly deserves to come out on DVD sometime (like The Adventures of Pete & Pete has already done).  It seems I am one of many many fans who would like the chance to see reruns of this show again.  It also highly deserves of a reunion special or a retrospective, following up on where all the child performers ended up (since several have gone on to be surprising contributors to society or gone into unexpected careers).  Would love to be able to see the many shows I never caught in the remaining reruns aired.  Would ADORE seeing a reunion special and/or retrospective.",1208044800,3,2851,4.747967479674797

My students and I would always talk about the show and share some laughs about it. A previous writer was completely right when he pointed out the original programing that was aired on Nick as compared to what is being aired on Nick and Disney. There is no originality at all on Disney and Nick has gotten into a real rut with one exception: I think Ned's Declasssified School Survival show does have many of the originality elements of the YCDTOTV. It is funny that Nick still uses the slime on its awards show but many of today's youth have no idea where it originated.

1524168,5,B00005JO2S,"I've been patiently awaiting the release of the YCDTOTV dvds because like many of the reviewers here I grew up watching the show and have begun to feel a bit nostalgic towards the yester-years...  But, as I found out, the reason why it has not been released through Nick is because it was leased programming -all true YCDTOTV fans know that the show was produced in Canada.  What some of you fans may not know (and I didn't until someone else explained it to me) is that any said distributor of Canadian programming such as YCDTOTV -would have to pay royalties not only to whoever owns the show's copyrights, but to each and every actor that participated on the show itself (part of the Canadian Actors Guild).  Thus, it would become quite costly to distribute such a program due to the large number of actors who joined the cast throughout its existence on the air.
I don't know if that will change or if this only applies to dated programming.  However, there is hope...if you really want to satisfy your YCDTOTV fix, you can visit the website (YCDTOTV.com) where you can watch classic episodes of the show in its entirety.  Plus, if you're a real die-hard fan you can trade or buy copies from people who have dusted off their VHS tapes in order to make copies and share with others.",1185408000,6,1285,4.545454545454546

But it's still a crime that YCDTOTV isn't being syndicated for today's children. Everyone is so uptight. Children of my time related more to things like that than today's immoral, unethical and sarcastic television shows.

But if and when this show comes out on DVD, expect it to be heavily edited and incomplete. There were many plugs for celebrities and it'll all be cut out due to today's ridiculous standards.

Also, why is it that even back then Canada and England put out great kids' shows but not America? And America STILL doesn't.

YCDTOTV, Third Eye series, and many other greats that were on Nick are out there with collectors, many including commercials. Your best bet on reliving the great past is to get it pre-recorded. Forget re-releases. They suck bad!!",1175212800,,875,4.781456953642384

Some of the early 80's great shows I remember, ""you cant do that on television"", ""tommorrow people"", then the mid 80's ""cities of gold"", double dare"", ""noozles"", the 90's brought us ""Clarrissa explains it all"", ""Pete and Pete"", ""Are you afraid of the dark"", ""legends of the hidden temple"", ""Hey dude"", Salute you shorts"".

It's a shame, the quality of television has plumeted. Movies suck. politicians are more phoney then ever. There's nothing good about the 2000-2010 era... heck, we don't even have a name for it!",1162166400,15,850,4.673333333333333
1524226,5,B00005JO2S,"This was probably the greatest show ever on television, and I'm pretty sure that anyone who has ever seen it would agree. I have been waiting for years for this thing to be released in some sort of format, and I can't believe it never has. I also can't believe that with all of the cable channels out there now (including the Nickelodeon spin-offs) that none of them air these repeats.

You Cant Do That On Television aired on Nickelodeon from 1983-1992 and basically made the first network for kids everything that it was... (I mean come on, they STILL use the green slime!) Actually though, the show was Canadian, and started out in the late seventies... it was HUGE! Then after 1992 it just dissapeared, never to be seen again... (However FYI there are a few episodes on YouTube that I discovered not to long ago- check those out if you've never seen the show before, because I'm sure you will become a fan.)

This is a show that must be released on DVD, but I'm sure there is some sort of battle of rights about this. I'm also sure that in todays sacharin world this show would never be deemed viewable for kids the way it was when I was a kid. It's too bad, cuz it really was funny.",1161734400,7,1187,4.342342342342342
1524227,5,B00005JO2S,"I am 34 years old and have out grown this show but I am very nostalgic and think it's a shame that this show has just fallen off the face of the earth. It's a great show. I watched every episode when I was a kid. I even wrote letters to Les Lye, the man of many characters on the show, and he wrote me back every time. From Kevin Illianovitch Rasputin Kubacheski, Alasdair Gillis, Lisa Ruddy, and the rest. What happened? Why does Nick ignore the show that helped launch it to stardom? I'd rather my kids watch reruns of this than stupid MTV shows. Maybe we just need to complain a bit more.

So what I need to know is who owns the shows and how do we get this put on DVD already? I'd really love to see it again just to reminisce and here those great Les Lye one liners.

The thing that reminded me of you can`t do that on television was when i was watching wrestling the other night and some of the wrestlers got green slimed in the middle of the ring. As i saw that it reminded me of the show. Brought back a lot of fun memories. Sure some of the jokes were crude but i dare anyone to watch this show without getting at least one laugh from it.

I find it hard to believe that the people who own the rights to this show would not put it out on dvd.why not cash in on what would be a sure seller.",1150848000,4,669,3.9555555555555557

1524315,5,B00005JO2S,"For the love of God and all things sacred... Well, okay, nothing is sacred to this show. And that was the irreverent beauty of it. To be honest, I had forgotten that this show existed until a few days ago. I am so ashamed. This show is undoubtedly the root of my sense of humor. I can admit that I was a rather devoted fan back in the day.

Sure, it was crude, sure the jokes were one-liners, sure it was obnoxious, campy, and the best this since Monty Python's Flying Circus. Not even the venerated SNL and Mad TV can really effectively compete with this show. Frankly SNL has deteriorated over the last 10 years+. But YCDTOT is an icon, a shining example of what every TV show today strives NOT to be: tasteless, classless, and well just plain stupid at times. But funny enough to keep you coming back for more. It's kind of a  Monty Python (crude, hilarious) meets Married with Children (classless, tasteless) and then cross-breeds with SNL and Mad TV. Of course it was first, and it was best...

The fans DESERVE this to be remastered and released in all its vile gut-busting glory. Prefer by season, with commentaries, possibly interviews and where-are-they-now's, any behind the scenes footage, cut scenes, banned episodes, out-takes, un-aired episodes or sketches...

Fans will eat it up, spit it out, then eat it up again, then go visit Barth.
