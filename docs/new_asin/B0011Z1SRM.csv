8479866,4,B0011Z1SRM,"my fiance loves to cook, and she's very good at it.  she also loves to watch cooking shows (ina garten, ellie kreiger, alton brown, etc.), which i can barely stand.  most of these tv people are so in your face it drives me crazy, but i can actually watch gretchen do her thing and imagine being right there in her kitchen.  i'm a novice in the kitchen and i feel like i could follow gretchen, and my fiance said she thought the content was good...she even picked up a few tips.  i hope she'll use them because this bread and soup will be great for the long, cold new england winter.

anyway, i figured i should comment since i was trying to find her a new cooking show to watch that would spare me the same old food network stuff.",1207612800,3,730,4.185714285714286
8479867,4,B0011Z1SRM,"I rarely feel the need to write reviews but I was thoroughly impressed with this cooking DVD. The soup and bread recipes are healthy, delicious, and easy.  The presentation is tasteful, aesthetically pleasing, and easy to follow. I cook for my family and always struggle with meals as cooking has never been my forte, however, this DVD makes me feel like a real cook! Its amazing, really. If you love cooking with fresh herbs and healthy ingredients and having a finished product that is both satisfying and healthy, then this is the cooking DVD for you.
I can't wait for volume 2.",1206576000,,581,4.696078431372549
8479868,5,B0011Z1SRM,"I was delighted to find this cooking DVD by the chef/owner of a restaurant on San Juan Island, Washington where we dined years ago while on vacation. At her Duck Soup Inn I was impressed with the homemade bread and the fresh home grown herbs and vegetables served with the creative entrees.

  In this DVD Chef Gretchen demonstrates step by step how to make Rye Bread with Flax Seed, and also Tomato, Onion and Fire Roasted Chili Soup. I am a beginner at the art of bread making, yet my bread was a success after watching Chef Gretchen explain and show how it should look and feel at each step.

  All my senses were fired up during the soup lesson and again when I prepared the recipe.  Printed recipes are included as well as a listing of every step/topic of the recipes on the DVD.  It was easy to go back and find the section I needed to review when making the bread and soup. The instructions were clear and detailed.

  My mouth was watering as I watched the DVD and I was motivated to run out to get the ingredients and try the recipes the next day.",1206403200,,1056,4.282828282828283
8479869,4,B0011Z1SRM,"I really like this DVD... I have bought a couple of cooking DVDs and this one is my favorite.. .anyone can follow it which makes it great for beginner's or even experienced cooks. I am a beginner but it would be just as good for someone w/more experience. Gretchen who hosts it is so personable. You feel like you are in her kitchen which is very cool.

The layout of the DVD is great for being able to go back and review anything that you miss since it is tabbed into chapters... so you can easily stop and start or go to a specific thing that you want to review.
It worked well for me so that as you go along and have to stop or go back and see a step over again it is so easy to do.

I had a lot of fun trying the recipes for the soup and bread... the presentation style is easy to follow and it makes you feel like you are cooking w/a master chef.

bon appetit. !",1206316800,2,867,3.914772727272727
8479870,5,B0011Z1SRM,I love this DVD!  I usually do not like to follow directions when I cook and I watched this DVD to the very end.  The directions are easy to follow and the end result is a delicious and healthy light meal.  I highly recommend this cooking DVD to anyone who would like to try their hand at making soup and bread and needs some help getting it done.  Gretchen does a great job explaining what she's doing and makes it enjoyable to watch and listen.  I love the pictures of the garden and the kitchen.,1205798400,,498,4.2
