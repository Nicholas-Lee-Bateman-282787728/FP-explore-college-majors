2270073,5,B00097DXSA,"This is a wonderfully intelligent and subtletly crafted film with Shakespearean overtones.  It is understated for the most part (with the exception of one scene that is a bit jarring and out of place).  It focuses on the burdens of family obligations - and the effect that peoples choices have to make.  If you like this movie, I'd also recommend the Celebration with the same actor.",1134950400,2,383,4.7727272727272725
2270074,5,B00097DXSA,"Four years ago, Christoffer left his family steel firm in Denmark and moved to Sweden.  There he met and married a theater actress, Maria, and opened a restaurant.  Together, they had established a happy life together.

When his father unexpectedly commits suicide, his mother calls him back to Denmark to take over the firm.  This unwanted inheritance takes a great toll on his relationship and his soul.

The movie excellently portrays the conflict between family obligations, career ambition, and obligations to a partner.  Full of tension, sadness, hope and despair, it's a portrait of humanity.",1134086400,3,599,5.252631578947368
2270075,3,B00097DXSA,"This is a movie about a mother I wish you never have, and a son you should avoid emulating. He's in love with a fantastically beautiful woman, who also adores him. But daddy dies, and steely Mom inherits the Swedish steel factory. She has plans for her son, and by sheer force of character and intimidation, tries steering him away from his love. It's an insidious, relentless battle, with little compromise. Emotions are raw, and visage close-ups magnificient.",1129248000,4,461,4.923076923076923
2270076,5,B00097DXSA,"The Inheritance (Arven), one of the most thoughtful films to come out of Denmark in recent years, is directed by Per Fly.  The Inheritance is actually the second film in a trilogy about class in Denmark (the first was the highly regarded The Bench, starring Jesper Christensen). It is  not, however,a political film: its focus is, instead, personal. This film stars Ulrich Thomsen (from The Celebration) as a young man who runs a cafe in Sweden but is abruptly called home to Denamrk when his magnate father dies.  His overpowering mother (played by a force known as Ghita Noerby, one of Denmark's finest actors) insists that he take over the business, even though he has no interests and has tried before to enter the business world of running a factory with disastrous results. The decision to accept his responsibility results in the collapse of his marriage to a loving Swedish wife and eventually the loss of his ethical and emotional equilibrium. Fine natural acting throughout is augmented by an exceptional score.  The extras are revealing, especially when the actors speak about their respective challenges. Highly recommeneded antidote to mindless Hollywood blockbusters.",1122422400,20,1181,5.167539267015707
2270077,5,B00097DXSA,"Choices in life often make a person choose a direction that will affect their own and the people near and dear to them.  In the light of this Per Fly has directed a powerful drama with a contemporary Shakespearian tone, maybe Hamlet, where the theme brings along several intricate side plots that will influence the audience in several ways.  The film opens with Danish businessman Christoffer (Ulrich Thomsen), who many will recognize from Celebration (1998), arriving to Stockholm where he is supposed to have a meeting, which unfortunately has been cancelled.  Instead of returning home he wanders the streets of the Swedish capital, as if he lived there.  Then he sits down in front of a fountain gazing up at a window where a woman closes a window, as the story flashes back five years.

In the nearby country of Sweden Christoffer has sought a personal refuge from family and family company.  He has succeed in establishing himself in the competitive Stockholm restaurant market and he is about to diversify himself through his profits in another restaurant.  Everything seems to fall in place for him, as his love life with Maria (Lisa Werlinder )is even growing stronger than his professional life.  Maria's career is also blooming, as she reveals that she has been offered an annual contract with the Royal Theater in Stockholm, including a part as Juliet in Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.  It seems as if nothing in the world could touch their happiness.  When Christoffer's father, Aksel (Ulf Pilgaard) arrives unannounced he is ecstatic to share with him about their happiness and success.  However, this unbreakable bubble of joy slowly begins to fade away when Christoffer finds out that his father has hanged himself shortly after his visit.

The news of his father's death forces him to leave Stockholm at once in order to arrange the funeral and all of the details around the family business.  Here the audience could possibly recognize the parallel to Hamlet.  When Christoffer arrives his mother quickly informs him that he is needed in Denmark, and that he is to take over the family steel company.  It also seems that Aksel hid a large negative balance and the banks are getting restless with his death.  Amidst the family crisis the company also faces dark financial times that will force them to lay off at least hundred employees and find a company to merge with in order to maintain strong on the highly competitive steel market.  Christoffer also has to take into account that Maria has a life in Stockholm with a thriving career and he has taken the position that was understood that his brother-in-law, Ulrik (Lars Brygmann) should have.  Whatever Christoffer's decision is it will hurt someone, as he finds himself in a troubling crossroads of his life where his decision will make strong ripples throughout his life and those near to him.

The fascination with the story rests within Christoffer's choice and how he tries to keep things together while slowly drifting into a personally miserably state.  Fly creates an atmosphere where the protagonist is selfish and unselfish at the same time, as he drifts into a cerebral confusion where he wanders aimlessly in order to please them all.  In the process of helping others, he gets himself lost where his misery induces a more depressive tone to his life, which he begins to accept.  All of this is possible through a brilliant performance from an outstanding and a rather unknown cast on this side of the Atlantic.  In addition, Fly illustrates his eye for details, as the mise-en-scene embraces the characters in a pragmatic, yet artistic manner where everything that needs to be framed within the shot exists.  Cumulatively, those who find themselves engrossed in this poignant drama will discover Christoffer's transformation radiantly tragic, as the human drama reaches its pinnacle.",1119484800,15,3870,5.001560062402496

8058229,4,B00097DXSA,"I was recently browsing the foreign movie section of my local library and stumbled upon this. Didn't know too much about it going in, other than what I read on the DVD jacket, so I took a flyer on this.

""The Inheritance"" (2003 release from Denmark; 115 min.) brings the story of Christoffer (played by Ulrich Thomsen), who years ago left his family's business (a steel factory) back in Denmark and now lives happily in Stockholm with his beautifil Swedish wife Maria (played by Lisa Werlinder). When Christoffer's dad commits suicide, Christopher's mom begs, manipulates and cajoles Christoffer to return to Denmark and succeed his dad as head of the company, and against the wishes of Maria, Chrisoffer finally does. As soon as Christoffer takes over, he gets confronted with insider backstabbing, board room drama, and financial pressure from the banks, all the while trying to keep Maria in line and happy. Will Christoffer succeed in saving the family business? Will Maria stay with Christoffer? To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: the movie starts rather slow and in the first half hour feels more like a soap than a corporate board room/family drama. But after that the movie settles down, and I found myself more and more intruiged, drawn in and very entertained as the movie played out. Apparently this movie won a ton of awards at the equivalent of the Danish Oscars. If you are in the mood for a quality foreign movie, I can readily recommend ""The Inheritance"".",1356998400,,1579,4.844444444444444
8058230,3,B00097DXSA,"I thought the acting was great and the story had potential but I couldn't shake the persistent feeling that there is no way that this man would ever make such a choice.  Where the movie falls short in my opinion is in not providing the viewer a plausible explanation of the main characters choices.  One can infer I suppose that the dominating Mother controls his life but there is nothing  shown to support that other than the cold Mother herself....it would have been much stronger if they had supplied more of a back-story in some way...even if it had been in flashbacks.  All the audience gets is a very brief glimpse of this very happy man with the ""perfect"" life and then he just shifts over to the cold business man simply because his Mother wishes it so.  Here is a man with much wealth and a business perfectly set up to keep going without his total involvement (although it had fallen on hard times, the management was in place and he simply could have taken on a much more perfunctory role).  In fact, the Brother-in-law seemed like the perfect successor and only schemed after he had been treated like dirt so there is no reason to assume that he would have been anything other than a good CEO if given the chance.  Basically, this story amounts to a controlling Mother who has ruined the lives of her family with zero compassion beyond her own desires.....this would have worked to much greater effect had the viewer been given more to create plausibility.",1283558400,2,1469,4.583969465648855

8058233,5,B00097DXSA,"This is one of those profound films based on a simple story.  It is profound because it makes you think about the choices you make in life and how each choice leads you to a different destiny.

""The Inheritance"" follows the life and choices of Christoffer, a young Danish entrepreneur who has successfully opened a thriving restaurant in Stockholm.  He is blissfully happy and deeply in love with his stunning actress wife, Maria.  His business is flourishing, his wife's career is receiving recognition and offers, and he seems to have everything anyone could want.  Then he receives a call that his steel magnate father has committed suicide, the family business is about to fail, and he is asked to return to Denmark, save it, and take control.

Christoffer fled Denmark some years earlier when he resigned from a disastrous career in that same family company.  Where do his loyalties lie--to his wife and their happy arrangement in Stockholm, or to the hundreds of employees and family members dependent on his business acumen in Denmark?  Can he make that life work?  Should he just stay in Stockholm?

It is a story beautifully portrayed that touches one's inner core, a theme that is timeless and universal.",1245196800,,1214,4.9068627450980395
8058234,5,B00097DXSA,"I developed quite a taste for Scandinavian movies after watching, ""The Inheritance,"" the ones that I have seen tend to have hard-hitting and emotionally compelling themes without the sugar-coated, happy ending nonsense that you see in many Hollywood films.

""The Inheritance"" is not simply a movie about family relations and having an overbearing mother as several reviewers have suggested. It's also about the failure to develop autonomy and become a person. It's about betrayal of the self and betrayal of the environment. The suicide that happens early in the movie is physical manifestation of the psychological and emotional death of the main character that happens near the end of the movie, a complete betrayal of who he is and could have been.

I hope I don't sound too clinical and analytical when describing this movie, it really is a deeply emotional movie. I think ultimately, it illuminates a core bastardization of human experience that happens throughout the world, whether in business, academia or even the arts. Many of us have had moments, perhaps years when we have gotten confused and gone for the external validation of money, status, family acceptance - or as in the case of this main character in this movie - all three.

Why do you think anti-depressants and therapy have become so prevalent in society? Because many, on some level, have followed the pattern of the main character in this movie and turned against what really matters. Drugs and endless psychobabble and talk about the past are a wonderful way of masking the pain, without really having to take action and change how you live.

8058235,5,B00097DXSA,"At first, what seems a documentary-style film with quite dry content, becomes a fascinating study of the power of family duty hardening the heart of a good man. Christoffer (Ulrich Thomsen) has a beautiful wife and great life. Just how he turns into a ruthless, impotent mechanoid, only interested in the family company's success - at the cost of everything and anything else that may be in its path, is both shocking and captivating.",1217462400,,434,4.878378378378378
8058236,5,B00097DXSA,"Writer/director Per Fly is a strong filmmaker from Denmark who is unafraid to make controversial statements that challenge certain 'family values' sentiments prevalent in this country.  In this brilliantly written, directed and acted film he manages to reveal the inner destruction of a family under whose surface is an institution of envy.  It is a riveting film that despite its in excess of two-hour length keeps us riveted to our seats in its never-ending exploration of the darker side of familial machinations.

Christoffer (Ulrich Thomsen) has escaped his Danish family and is comfortably ensconced in Stockholm as a successful restaurateur, living with the beautiful actress Maria (Lisa Werlinder) whose love for life extends beyond the fulfilling pleasures of the boudoir. Their bliss is interrupted by an unexpected visit from Chrisoffer's father who briefly spends time with the couple, happy for their state of success in all things.  Upon his departure Christoffer receives a phone call that his father has hung himself and his presence is demanded in Denmark. Christoffer and Maria fly home to the matriarch of the family, Christoffer's mother Anneliese (the brilliant Ghita Norby) who immediately takes charge of the family, demands that Christoffer take over the failing family steel company thus skipping over Christoffer's designated brother-in-law Ulrick (Lars Brygmann), a fact that tears at Christoffer's sister Benedikte (Karina Skands). Taking the position of head of the family business would mean his giving up his dreams in Stockholm, negate Maria's burgeoning acting career, and placing Christoffer in the ominous position of having to fire longtime employees and make changes that would decimate many - not the least of which would be Christoffer's character.  But Anneliese is strong and gets her way and thus the destruction of Christoffer's humanity and life begins.

Christoffer is able to merge the company with a French company and make the family business successful.  But at what a cost?  Maria leaves him after they have a child, Benedikte collides with him over his ruining her life with Ulrick, and Christoffer moves to France where he drowns his sorrows in alcohol.  Per Fly is not one to tidy up all of the loose ends of a family disintegration: he leaves the end results of a bad decision up to the audience to figure out.  It is this respect for the audience that endears this artist to us.  The script is brilliantly written, the acting is superb, and the direction is tight and sensitive to the storyline.  In every way this is a film worthy of our attention, not only as an art piece, but also as a means of re-examining 'family values' that here are presented in quite a different light than our usual reference phrase suggests.  Highly recommended.  Grady Harp, November 06",1163116800,6,2821,5.131004366812227
