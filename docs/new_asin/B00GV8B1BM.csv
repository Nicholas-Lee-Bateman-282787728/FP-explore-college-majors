6119175,3,B00GV8B1BM,I'm a huge lifelong Lucy fan.  This isn't ine of her better projects.  The ILL bit had run its course and the chemistry between Lucy and Desi was gone.  The sets were less convincing than on ILL. Yet I did LOL during the wedding chapel scene. The Lucy-Milton repartee was worth the wait!,1472342400,,287,4.377358490566038

6119189,2,B00GV8B1BM,"According to both IMDB and a 1959 TV GUIDE, this special was originally broadcast in color--not surprising for NBC.  However, this DVD is black-and-white.  Why?  It would have been a unique treat viewing Lucy and Ricky Ricardo in living color for the one and only time.",1436227200,,269,4.804347826086956

6119204,4,B00GV8B1BM,"So great that this finally came out on DVD.  Not their best, and they are both looking a little tired, but a hidden gem nonetheless.  It suffers from a lack of the Mertzes, and resembles some of their later Lucy-Desi comedy specials.  You can see that they are at the end of it all.",1423872000,,282,4.185185185185185

6119208,4,B00GV8B1BM,"I am prompted to write this review because this dvd program has gotten panned, by even Lucy fans, and I really think it is undeserved.
From what I can tell, this was produced as a Milton Berle Special starring Lucy and Desi as Lucy and Ricky Ricardo from 1959 as they were winding down their Lucy-Desi Comedy Hours. It was filmed at Desilu, it was directed by Desi Arnaz, it was written by two of I Love Lucy's writers,... what's not to like? I think it stands as a fine addition to the collection of late fifties catalog of Lucy-Desi Comedy Hours. Milton had a reputation of not being easy to work with and hamming up and stealing a scene,...but for as many times as Lucy
worked with him, it seems as though she had much respect for his talent. and as history has taught us, she was a formidable talent, who definitely managed her stage. This was filmed without their
signature live studio audience. In the late fifties
they did that more and more especially as they
went on location. There are solid gags- including
one reminiscent of ""The Freezer"", where they use
the same makeup techniques to emulate Lucy's
frozen arm and hand. It'sjust plain funny. There's
also a gag calling on ""My Fair Lady"", which was
popular on Broadway at the time.
Ok, it's not VitaVetaVegemin, or the Candy Factory, but its solid comedy and deserves the attention by all true Lucy fans.",1419724800,3,1366,4.556910569105691
6119209,2,B00GV8B1BM,Pass this one up. Pretty dismal.,1419292800,,32,4.5

6119217,5,B00GV8B1BM,"I made sure as there was some confusion, this is definately not the Milton Berle episode of ""The Lucy/Desi Comedy Hour"" released by CBS/Paramount. Everything the case and artwork promises holds true in this rare and never released gem and definately will complete your Lucy/Desi collection. Great Quality, I admit the script is subpar but in my humble opinion so were the ""Lucy/Desi Hours"".compared to ""I Love Lucy""...but it is so refreshing just to see another new to viewers hour of classic Lucy & Ricky, sadly though no mention of the Mertzes.",1397520000,5,546,4.945652173913044
6119218,4,B00GV8B1BM,I was pleasantly surprised that this special was very funny; of course if Lucy & Desi weren't in it I never would have purchased this special.  I am not a big Milton Berle fan.  I suggest anyone who loves Lucy should buy this special.,1397174400,,234,4.295454545454546

6119220,3,B00GV8B1BM,"If you are a die-hard Lucy fan then you will want to buy this one.  I had never seen or heard of this special so I suppose it was favorable in that respect.  Otherwise, this special wasn't particularly Lucy at her funniest.  Wait until it goes for under $10.00 than it may be worth it.",1395619200,,285,4.1454545454545455
6119221,5,B00GV8B1BM,"Lucy and Desi fan or not, you will love this wonderful piece-Lucy and Desi are already American comedy legends, but add in the fantastic Milton Berle and you have a comedic masterpiece!! Worth watching again and again and family friendly!",1395014400,,238,4.975

6119223,5,B00GV8B1BM,"It's always a special treat to find a long lost rarity featuring Lucille Ball finally put on dvd! Finding this The Lucy-Desi Milton Berle Special from 1959 on dvd is an especially rare treat! Don't be confused thinking this is a Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour, because it isn't. This is an NBC Television Special from 1959 simply titled The Lucy-Desi Milton Berle Special.

I am a huge Lucy lover and have never seen this NBC special on dvd ever- this is a first! This rare 1959 special is actually one of the last times Lucy and Desi worked together and it is delightful to see. The storyline features Milton Berle and his bandleader Ricky Ricardo playing at El Rancho in Las Vegas. Milton finds himself in a pickle when he forgets his wedding anniversary when his wife Ruth tells him he has to fly home for their party she's having. Lucy, who as always, has been pestering poor Milton in Las Vegas, tries to make things better by having Milton's wife Ruth fly to Vegas to get a better surprise from Milton- a diamond ring! Milton can't believe Lucy has been doing all this behind his back but ends up liking the idea- even the expensive price tag that goes with the rare Winthrop Diamond he buys for Ruth.

The only problem is that two jewel crooks were planning to steal the ring, so now they have to rob Milton instead of the Jewelers. Lucy just has to try this Winthrop Diamond ring on, and it gets stuck. The fun starts here, as the crooks don't care how they get the ring, as long as they get it! This NBC special was directed by Desi, produced by Milton Berle and filmed at Desilu Studios. You'll also see a very young Nancy Kulp (Miss Jane from the Beverly Hillbillies) in it too. The film and sound quality is average- which is good for something this rare and this is just such a thrill to finally own it on dvd!

There are two more Bonus features included- the first being The Lucy Show- Lucy Meets The Berles. For Lucy fans, you'll remember this being the show where Lucy thinks Milton is cheating on his wife Ruth with Ruta Lee. The quality is really bad on this show, but if you already own this on The Lucy Show dvd's, it doesn't matter. The second Bonus feature is another treasure for Milton Berle fans- it's called The Buick Berle Show from New York also filmed at NBC. Milton sings and dances with Broadway dancers and also features Broadway's Janet Blair- who was famous for South Pacific. From Madison Square Garden you'll get to see boxing champ Ezzard Charles- Milton does some fancy foot work in the ring. This 1954 Special talks about Ezzard's coming up fight with the great Rocky Marciano. And being NBC, we get to go to a Steve Allen Show in New York- it's all really enjoyable fun!

This never before seen on video The Lucy-Desi Milton Berle Special may not be digitally restored, but it's well worth buying, as it is wonderful to see Lucy, Desi and Milton back in 1959 for the first time in decades! It really reminded me of the famous Lucy show where Lucy could not get Liz's famous ring off her hand- you can see where the Elizabeth Taylor/Richard Burton show got it's ideas from! Also getting the Bonus 1954 Buick Berle Show featuring Broadway's Janet Blair, Steve Allen and Ezzard Charles is a real treat! This is a rare 5 STAR treat for Lucy or Milton Berle fans and well worth buying to add to your Lucy Library!!",1392508800,19,3340,4.443719412724307
8627788,5,B00GV8B1BM,"If you love ""I Love Lucy"" or if you just love Lucille Ball, you will like all her shows including this special tv movie (less than an hour long).  Lucy stars in this one with her then husband, Desi Arnaz, and Milton Berle.  In this movie, the Berle family are good friends with the Arnaz family.  Milton and Desi are performing in Las Vegas at one of the casino hotels.  Lucy of course wants Milton's attention and wants his autograph and all.  Soon, she is involved in trying to mend the relationship for Milton and his wife by suggesting he buys a super expensive diamond ring for her.  However, a couple of robbers have been eying the same diamond for a long time.  This purchase creates havoc for Milton and Lucy as they are trying to get away from the robbers.  Very entertaining as always.  Lots of fun watching Lucy and Milton work together.",1516320000,,848,4.454545454545454
