8264174,4,B0016S7TQ8,"This DVD is older photography, but helpful - it fills in a lot of knowledge gaps that you can watch over and over again - how to tie certain knowts, differences and purposes of various types of lines, tips on various types of casts, etc.  And it has some fun live-catch scenes, as well.  Personally, I like it - it's sort of a ""go-to"" watch several times over the colder months for review and for a fix!",1296604800,,403,4.220779220779221
