7795375,5,0989490572,"This DVD features a 90-minute chastity presentation to teenagers in an unidentified city, with chapter stops and a brief ad for the ""Chastity Project,"" but no extra features. The talk is given by popular Catholic husband-and-wife chastity speakers Jason and Crystalina Evert, who weave their own stories into the presentation in an entertaining way. Jason is in it far more than Crystalina, but it's pretty much the exact same talk they give on their speaking tours throughout the United States, and there's nothing new here if you've seen them speak in person. They are dynamic speakers who appeal to teenagers with their realism about sex, but this DVD functions better as an ad for their real-life presentations than as a stand-alone tool to teach the value of chastity. Nevertheless, it's a great presentation, and I highly recommend the DVD for teenagers and young adults who don't have the opportunity to see the Everts speak in person. They have a real gift for speaking on the level of teenagers about the reality of sex and the value of waiting, without using scare tactics or condescension. Jason Evert, a Jesuit-educated product of Brophy Prep, has a particularly strong grasp of the Catholic teenager's world.

If you've seen the Everts in person, this DVD is a nice memento of their stock presentation, but it's not a good supplement or preview of their talk since it's the exact same thing. For instance, I don't recommend showing this video to students who are about to see the Everts present in person, as it will simply give away the entire talk before they hear it in person. Also, I didn't like this video as much as some earlier products released by the Everts, as they seem to be getting a bit bored/repetitive as they approach age 40. Their earlier presentations (including those on DVD) had more freshness and energy than this one, even though this one is still great.",1397260800,3,1891,4.854489164086687
