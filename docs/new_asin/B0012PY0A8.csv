8247285,1,B0012PY0A8,"When you're a little kid, one day you venture outside and decide to build the most grand tree house anyone has ever seen. But in the end, your final creation pales in comparison, and is little more than a few crooked boards with bent nails. And afterwords you might need a tettinus shot.

This movie is the equivalent. Don't get me wrong - It is great that people came together to make a movie. But this movie is only worth seeing if you get it for free. By no means is this a good movie in any regard, and by no means should you ever trade legal tender in order to own a copy.

Think: junior high students team up with a local community college to film an eclectic movie.

However, the movie is fun to watch. The sheer campiness, the lack of acting, the special effects that aren't special, the repeated explanations of what ""Marshall Law"" is, and the cameo appearance of Colonel Sander's suspenders worn by the Father/Preacher are wonderful.

The special effects have been super-imposed and are the same quality as those of the show Aqua Teen Hunger Force, and you'll spend the entire movie waiting for Frylock, Meatwad, and Milkshake to burst in from stage right.

If you turn this in to a drinking game, watch for the following:
- Whenever the green-screened driving scenes are up, look for the background to reset.
- The number of times they drive up the ""Police Line Do Not Cross"" sign.
- The number of times the UFO is shown - and why does it seem to leak gasoline? Don't aliens use more efficient forms of fuel?
- The ""military"" helicopter... which is oddly the only hint of the military being in the town
- The number of times an explosion wipes out half the globe",1249516800,5,1673,4.436482084690554
8247286,4,B0012PY0A8,"It's great to see indie filmmakers going for it, putting it on the line and getting their film(s) made. This was a fun, sci-fi movie with a dramatic twist. Story also has a heart-warming message.",1232841600,,195,4.6
8247287,4,B0012PY0A8,"No, this is not a multi million dollar movie that is overloaded with big name actors, but that is what gives this movie its appeal. It takes place in Maine, which is one of the most beautiful backdrops for any movie, and the acting is great!  It is a movie that you have to pay attention to, or you will miss something, and you'll have a hard time understanding what is going on. It's well worth the watch.",1216512000,2,406,4.205128205128205
8247288,4,B0012PY0A8,This movie is a good Sci-fiction movie to watch on a rainy afternoon. The acting is good.,1209340800,,89,4.294117647058823
