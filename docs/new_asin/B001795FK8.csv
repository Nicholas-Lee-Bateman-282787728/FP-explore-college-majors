8429770,1,B001795FK8,"All 3 of Julius dvds are crap. He talks too much, and keeps talking of concepts rather than teach drills and various techniques.he also keeps flinching during moves as if he is expecting to get hit. That is so irritating. Even my wife commented on that although she doesn't practice arnis eskrima.
Then he has these huge two apes as his partners who look like duhs or Shrek who keep pretending as if they are in pain and also keep grinning to someone off the set.
I bought these three videos from blackbeltmag.com and not from amazon.
All the 4 clowns in these videos which includes a weak looking female are dressed to kill with waist scarves with their names on them and some weird emblazoned forearm sleeve which has no purpose whatsoever. You would think it provides some protection during practice but it obviously doesn't because you often see Julius pulling it up so it's obvious it's not designed to protect.
Melegrito also keeps throwing in the cops into his ramblings and it seems to me it was to impress.
Don't waste your money on these bulls*** videos. I wasted my money. Don't waste yours. And don't believe the guy who gave the 5-star rating.",1427155200,,1156,4.616504854368932
8429771,5,B001795FK8,"I discovered this when I was looking to supplement my martial arts by reading books and viewing dvds. I was pleasantly surprised at how Mr Melegrito explained the fighting style systematically, allowing enough repetitions for me to follow. I also found out that it complements the Tae Kwon Do that I practice and does not at all counter anything that I have been taught at the Do Jang.  I bought all 3 volumes and I must say that it was a very good buy. I highly recommend it to anyone looking to supplement their martial arts knowledge.",1327622400,4,537,4.536082474226804
