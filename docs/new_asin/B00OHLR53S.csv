8683632,4,B00OHLR53S,"Paul Henreid made both his producing and directing debut with THE TALL LIE (aka: FOR MEN ONLY), a 1952 release that, on its surface, might seem a bit dated, but considering recent events reported in the press, it probably isnt.

This interesting and entertaining drama deals with college fraternities and their hazing practices.  Apparently, back when the picture was made, hazing was being blamed for a number of deaths on college campuses around the United States, and THE TALL LIE was meant to expose these practices.

Henreid also stars in the movie, playing a respected college professor who takes on a fraternity that has inadvertently caused the death of one of his prize students.  The young man had refused to kill a dog during a Hell Night initiation and, ever since, the fraternity members had been going after him; sullying his reputation and trying to drive him out of school.  Once Henreid takes up the fight, the fraternity turns on him also.

The movie introduces several performers who would become well known to audiences in the future.  They include Russell Johnson (GILLIGAN'S ISLAND), actresses Vera Miles (PSYCHO) and my friend and former publicity client, Kathleen Hughes (IT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE), who was later publicized as Universal Pictures answer to Marilyn Monroe.  Indeed, Kathys resemblance to MM is quite remarkable.

Also in the cast, playing Henreids wife, is Margaret Field, actress Sally Fields mother.

THE TALL LIE is available on DVD from VCI Entertainment.

8683634,5,B00OHLR53S,"This film hadn't been shown since a TV airing back in 1972, so it's kind of amazing to finally have it on a commercial DVD.  The film centers on a sadistic fraternity man (surprisingly played by Russell Johnson, who would later gain fame as the professor on GILLIGAN'S ISLAND) who orders a pledge to kill a puppy to demonstrate his ""manliness"" during a hazing ritual.  The pledge refuses, and is harassed unmercifully by the men of the fraternity.  A fatality later leads to an investigation of the ugly incident.

Most of the college-set films I have seen from the 1940's and early 1950's tend to be either musicals or funny ""hi-jinks"" satires.  In comparison, THE TALL LIE/FOR MEN ONLY is deadly serious.  Director Paul Henried plays a crusading professor who investigates the scandal.  His path is complicated at every turn by an administration that wants to look the other way, and by an attractive coed who has designs on him.

Films released near the end of the 1950's would explore more tawdry scholastic situations, such as TEA AND SYMPATHY, THE STRANGE ONE, and even Roger Corman's SORORITY GIRL.  Paul Heinried's THE TALL LIE seems far ahead of its time, coming in 1952 (which means it was actually filmed in 1951).  Heinried had previously directed the women-in-prison film SO YOUNG, SO BAD. As a director, he never shied away from tackling difficult issues.  The death of the puppy isn't actually shown, but it remains shocking.

THE TALL LIE isn't a masterpiece, but it is a surprisingly valid expose.  Kudos to VCI for releasing this thought-to-be-lost motion picture.",1421280000,3,1582,4.902255639097745
