8217367,1,B000V90MDU,"If you have any perception of ""Fantom Kiler"" being a sexually explicit slasher movie, then think again. What we have here is 82 minutes of cheap home made pornography.

There's no plot to speak of, just a succession of naked ladies. The entire thing is filmed as one massive masturbation fantasy. The few male roles are comedy toilet cleaners and police officers, who are dubbed with an audio quality that doesn't sound anything like the rest of the film's soundtrack! Oh yes, and the murders are fixated on the vagina and the anus. I can imagine the director getting into a froth of excitement over each drawn out scene of chase, stripping and sexually related death (all the women are directed to act as though sexually aroused during their murders).

There are a total of 4 sets - an office, a lobby, a bedroom and a forest (which looks to be about 5 meters square and indoors). All the women in the film become naked and oiled up (?), sometimes within mere seconds of appearing on the screen. And there are plenty of extremely explicit close ups. Some of the film is based around two toilet cleaners who imagine what all the women who pass by would look like naked...cue lots of footage of women naked. We also spend nearly 15 minutes watching one of the cleaners stick a wooden spoon up some girl's butt.

Take it from me, ""Fantom Kiler"" is pornography, nothing more. It's also not even Polish (which is what it's trying to look like, but they can't even do that convincingly). It's a film about naked women...everything else is an afterthought, in fact it's practically a waste of time trying to review it in the horror/thriller genre at all.",1314316800,,1648,4.617747440273037
