2154314,4,B000300QFG,"Before I say anything, I am going to point you to P. Krug's fantasticly well typed review, I recommend you read it.

I am mostly typing this out because I think this exellent game deserves more attention and reviews.

As mentioned in P. Krug's review and in the short Amazon.com summary, you are a sophmore high school student named Makimura Kotaro. You live a pretty normal life: You go to school, fawn over the school goddess(Serizawa Kaho) and have a childhood friend who's feelings you're completely oblivious to(Ai)(I personaly find her to act and look like a mix of Misuzu from Air and Excel(More in looks then personality) from Excel Saga.)

After fawning over her one day in school, Kotaro finally gets up the courage to ask her out...but how does he approach it?

Kaho turns around while Kotaro is watching her and greets Ai.

Ai returns the greeting while Kotaro is shocked to find out they know each other.

Kotaro drags Ai and Takeshi to Paradise Cafe, their usual meeting/hangout place while he discuses ways to profess his love to Serizawa.

After deciding on a method(The method varys depending on what you choose, although you ultimately are forced to give her a Letter in the game, despite what you might have originally choose) you ask Ai to help you out. Ai is reluctant at first, but ultimately caves once you beg her and promise to buy her a yogurt shake.

Satisfied with your method of attack, you go home. But you hear the sounds of heavy boots behind you(Okay, she's not wearing heavy boots, but it sure SOUNDS like heavy boots.), you turn around and see a woman(Kotaro originally thinks the person in a trench coat is a guy. Poor Kotaro. It must be painful to be so blind.) in a trench coat. You move forward a bit, but she still follows you. Now, depending on what decisions you make, you'll either run away impale her on your bike, or you'll try to find out who she is, and impale her on your bike; regardless, you'll end up breaking the jar she's holding and getting a strange dust all over you, Kotaro guesses that it's bath supplies.

When Kotaro comes to, he finds the woman he chased is gone,(He knows it's a woman now, from the scream) and now he smells like bath supplies. Kotaro decides to admit defeat and go home; however, despite the fact that he took a bath, he can't get the smell entirely off him...not a good day, and it'll only get worse.

Kotaro goes to sleep but finds that it's disturbed by a strange mix of rainbow-esque colors and an obnoxious sound(Whether Kotaro hears the sound or not, I don't know. But it'll be quite obnoxious to you, the viewer.), but he can't move and can only surrender to unconciousness.

When Kotaro awakens, he quickly rushes off to school, only to find that no one is around the classrooms or halls, the whole place is eerily empty of life. Finally Takeshi finds you(How? I really don't know...it's kind weird.) and tells you that everyone is attending the opening ceremony. Kotaro is understandably confused. Opening ceremony? Isn't Summer just a few days off?

Despite his confusion, he follows Takeshi to where the principle is making his opening announcements and ""story"".

But everything seems wrong; the room is quiet and everyone is  wearing a long face. Ai is trembling and even the principle doesn't seem to act natural. Kotaro notices the strange absence of anyone resembling Serizawa.

His confusion only worsens when the principle announces ""an unfortunate accident""(Kotaro has the incredible skill of not being able to put Two and Two together.). Shortly after hearing that, he notices that Tomomi is injured and some students are talking about a ""stalker"".

Kotaro thinks that maybe the principle was talking about Tomomi when he mentioned ""an unfortunate accident"".

Yet this is quickly disproven when he is told that ""He looks suprisingly well, considering that his girlfriend, Serizawa-san, was killed on the way to meeting him.""

How does one become the boyfriend of someone that he does not even know? Why is today September First, instead of July Fifteeneth? What happened to Tomomi? Those questions flowed through Kotaro's mind.

And they all get answered when you play through Hourglass of Summer. It's truly a beautiful game that any fan of anime, Quantum Leap, or anyone that just appreciates a good story should buy.

The artwork is exellent, the music is great(Although they have it turned down way too low in game. You might want to listen to it by putting in ""BGMMODES"" in the Extra menu. Track 18, Snow Chapal, is my favorite.) and the story is well-woven.

My main gripe is that the translators seem to screw up, a lot.

There are countless punctuation and spelling errors throughout the game.

But that's not my main complaint so much as is the random inclusion of Japanese words that they really don't bother explaining to the common American.

I am a major anime fan and otaku, I knew what senpai, -chan, -san, -kun, ETC. meant. And I'm guessing most people that buy it will probably know what it means, too. However something really obscure, that I'm guessing even most anime fans won't catch, is when Kotaro says ""I was busy saving a 'Kohai'"". This is mentioned in Serizawa's scenario. A ""Kohai"" is an inferior, in this case, it's a lower level student, a Freshman.

And another thing that really bugged me is when the translators din't mention that ""Ai"" means ""love"". Ai mentions in her scenario how she was teased as a kid for having the name ""Ai"". But the translators din't bother explaining it at the top of the screen or anything to anyone(Or if they did, I certainly missed it).

I would like the translators to be more considerate to non-anime fans. I would like to see ren'ai games spread to a broader audience.

That's why this game loses one star, lazy translators.

Otherwise this is a great ren'ai game that deserves a place in anyone's DVD libary.",1112313600,4,5872,4.730392156862745
2154315,4,B000300QFG,"I bought this out of interest, but was turned off when it didn't have english. Still, I got into it, and found it was a beautiful, charming story, accentuated by little bits of drama, comedy, and ultimately, tradgedy.

The graphics are top notch. Truly, an art form in animation, gorgeous to look at and very gripping in their presentation. these alone convey the emotions of the characters, further brought to life by the vocals. Like most ""choose your own adventure"" stories, this one allows you to literally change the future of the main character's life. Passwords, the DVD's equivalent to scene selection, can be accessed by pushing the menu button, and this will give an eight-digit password to that point in the story.

A word to (and from) the wise: plan on spending a good deal of time with this DVD. There are many plot twists and minute changes that can alter the future, for better or for worse. I myself have played through this DVD only once so far, but it still took me nearly two days, and that was with the unhappy ending, which ends halfway through the game.

Despite its minor flaws, it is a sweet, compelling tale of love, devotion, and conflicting emotions, all bundled together throught the magic of Japanese artwork. All in all, if you like either Anime, or even the genre, you won't be dissapointed by this magical story of a Summer of pure Fantasy!",1098230400,3,1373,4.6652892561983474
2154316,4,B000300QFG,"From the makers of PHANTOM OF INFERNO comes this, an interactive anime teenage love story with a dash of surreal sci-fi.

You play the role of Kotaro Seno, ordinary high school guy who is looking forward to summer vacation. Kotaro lives next door to Ai Senou, a girl your age and life-long childhood friend. Ai lives with her father (her mother passed away some time ago,) who works at his own home-owned fish resteraunt Uomasa, at his own house. Ai is ditsy, extreamly clumsy and a crybaby (say, could she be related to Sailor Moon?) yet she is also the manager of the boy's soccor club, though probably because she'll gladly take care of whatever tasks they ask of her, such as laundry. Ai often asks Kotaro for rides on his bike so as not to be late for school. She also comes over to his house every night to play his racing video game, even though he always beats her.

At school Kotaro is a member of the boxing club, pressured into it by his other friend, emotionally surpressed Tokieda Takeshi, boxing champ and president of the club. (The club is minscule, consisting of only one more member other than Takeshi and Kotaro.) And there is Tomomi Yanagihara, a rather unconventional biology teacher who also takes a deep interest in  supernatural phenomenon. She is won't to doing things like wacking her students on the back of the head with the corner of her attendence board for standing out in the middle of the hall and calling them names like ""stupid losers"" when she gets annoyed with them.

The most popular girl in school is Kaho Serizawa, drama club member and daughter of a famos, rich painter who lives on top of the hill in a grandious mansion. Beautiful, intelligent and well-poised, Kaho is sought after by every guy in school, including Kotaro. He yearns desperately to go out with her, but can't even work up the nerve to talk to her.

At the student's favorite after school hangout, Paradise Cafe, an American diner-themed resteraunt, Kotaro discusses with his friends his desire to ask out Kaho, and they tell him she's out of his league. He asks Ai to introduce him to Kaho, and she reluctantly agrees.

Later that night, the night of July 14th, (in Japan summer vacation is only one month long,) as he's walking home, Kotaro finds himself being stalked. It turns out to be a young woman in a trench coat, hat and shades. Upon accidentally running into her, she spills a stange powder on him that smells like bathroom cleaner. She runs off and he goes home where Ai awaits. He beats her at let another round of video game racing, and then she goes home and he prepars for bed. Then suddenly he is assaulted by the strange fragrence of the powder, as well as rainbow-like colors and an odd ringing sound. The next morning he wakes up and goes to school, and finds that, increadably, it's already September 1st. He learns that he has indeed been dating Kaho, but now the whole school is in mourning because, tragically she was killed in a terrible accident just the day before. Kotaro suddenly finds himself jumping back and fourth through time between the days of July 14th. and September 1st., always when he goes to bed and always greeted by the ringing, the smells and the colors. Sometimes he goes a couple days passing time normally, then unexpectedly jumps forward a couple days or back several days. He can never tell for certain when he'll jump or to what day he'll arrive in. Can he beat fate and save Kaho from her untimely end? Who was the woman he ran into? Can Tomoi help him?

The story was excellent and the characters were all likeable and intresting, and I wanted to see what happened to them how things turned out based on what desicions I made. But now here's one major design flaw: there are NO passwords. Meaning, in other words, that every time you restart the game/story, you have to begin all the way back at the beginning. Passwords are the interactive DVD equivelent to a scene selection. You make certain decisions, and every now and then you come to a screen that shows a certain password of how to get to that point in the story after making those desicions. Begin at the beginning and make different desicions and you get different passwords, since your different choices have different consequences later on. Here, however, there are now passwords to be found. Couple that with the fact that the story actually takes sometime to tell all the way through (the first time I played through an entire story from beginning to end I ended up making a grand total of 58 choices,) and you should be prepaired to devote the better part of a day playing through this disk. On the plus side, it is possible to fast-forward through until you get to the next option, so if you have to start all over again before completing the story you can fast-forward to each option, making the same choices as you did last time, until you reach the point you left off.

In short, this DVD is still highly recomended, but it REALLY needs passwords.",1097625600,7,4978,4.579124579124579

8035430,3,B000300QFG,"Pros: Engaging story
Cons: Controls/ scenes quirky
I probably wouldn't get one of these interactive DVDs again. I read the reviews and didn't expect full-on animation, but transition between even still-scenes is choppy, and tends to cut out the first subtitle for that scene. You can correct this by fiddling with the controls, but then the subs and the scene are mismatched. As mentioned by others, the password and other controls aren't intuitive. That said, it still marginally hold my interest due to the story. Problems might be solved with a different DVD player but mine is fairly ordinary and I don't feel I should have to get a new one or computer software just for this. I'd wait until interaction & scenes are improved before buying another. it IS a DVD after all.",1283558400,,775,4.791044776119403
8035431,1,B000300QFG,"I am surprised that this game has such high ratings. Based on these ratings I decided to try one of the few Visual Novels commerically released in the US. It was a big dissapointment, the characters are uninteresting, the story that I feel has so much potential with its time traveling plot succeeded in being really boring. Perhaps this might be worth it if you've never heard of Visual Novels before, however, if you are familiar with the Visual Novels by key such as Canon, Air, and Clannad you will be terribly dissapointed and shouldn't waste your time with this. I don't mind the spelling and grammar mistakes regulary appearing in the english translation, but if you are going to play this keep in mind that it might not work properly on a PC DVD player. Use a PS2 if you have one.",1239062400,,788,4.5174825174825175
8035432,5,B000300QFG,"THE GOOD:

-Amazing graphics
-Detailed story
-5 girls, all with very different personalities
-Lots of choices to make
-PHENOMENAL music
-Main character is voiced
-There are passwords
-Both a soundtest and pic galleries at the end
-Can have two characters onscreen at once.
-Uses innovative visual effects (the sun gives off a glare during the day and it's dark at night, the screen shakes when someone bops you on the head, a frightened character hides behind another one, etc)

THE BAD:

-Too long.  Can take as many as 6 hours to get through
-Can't skip individual lines of dialog.  Only entire scenes, which makes you miss plot if it's the first time you're seeing it.
-Password system is set up so poorly some people don't even realize it is there.

On the whole, I really like it.  If you could skip line-by-line, it would've been perfect.  It is still pretty darn close.",1237680000,,876,4.717105263157895
8035433,5,B000300QFG,"Have played the game twice just on the same scenario, and eventually hope to go through all the other scenarios, before doing the first one a third time(I don't see how anything in the game can top the route I did the first time!).  If you're interested in a good story, this one has it.",1162512000,,287,4.218181818181818
8035434,2,B000300QFG,"Love the story.  Hate the user interface, especially the password system that hangs in the middle of your input.  It violates everything that was taught by Human-Computer Interaction specialists and you can see how that turned out.  I believe they wasted money on game developers who could do a lot better if they were given real games to work with.

It's sad because the plot is top-notch.",1145664000,,390,4.776119402985074
8035435,5,B000300QFG,"well i played this game and it is the best.

you can get ending for all the girls and the story for each

girl is very deep. It is way better than ""amusement park"" because

you barely make any choices and the story is not deep at all.

so if you like interactive dvd game and don't know which one to get,get this one.",1145577600,,317,3.90625
8035436,4,B000300QFG,"Hourglass of Summer took me by surprise when I saw it for sale - mostly because I had played through the original Japanese game, Natsuiro no Sunadokei, a little bit and was surprised that an English version was available!

Since Miss Brimhall and P. Klug both gave very good synopses of the plot, I won't repeat it, and will instead touch on some of the technical aspects.

First and foremost, I'm not sure if Hirameki re-authored the dvd game since the original release, but as Nikki Fay mentioned, the version I purchased only a few days ago DOES have a password option - while playing the game, click your ""Menu"" button on the DVD player and you can choose a ""Get a password"" option, or something similar.  I used that option several times while playing and trying to get the good endings, so it definitely does work - so if that was a deterrent, you should be fine.  There is an insert slip with the DVD with the instructions on how to use the feature.

Also, as Miss Brimhall mentioned, the translations are a bit wonky at times.  Some words are misspelled, a couple of times the characters' names are wrong (one of Ai's lines in her endstory is labeled as being said by Kotaro), and in at least one instance, they forgot to translate a character's name, resulting in Mana's name coming up in kanji on the screen (consider it a cultural learning opportunity!).  In all cases, they didn't really keep me from figuring out who was saying what, or what was being said, so I don't think they'd really confuse anyone else either...but they were noticeable; more of a nuisance and a small smudge on an otherwise enjoyable release, is all.

Also, like she said, there are no ""liner notes"" to explain the terms used, such as when first-year student Mana refers to you (a second-year student) as sempai, or a few other cultural items, such as what a yukata is, for people who don't know that it's different than a kimono.  A little sheet of translation notes would have been awesome for helping out people who are new to anime or Japanese culture - as it is, a quick trip to your favorite internet search site will usually help you clear it up, but it's a minor bother to do so.

Another note, since I don't believe it was mentioned - this is a translation of a Playstation2 game called Natsuiro no Sunadokei, which is a ren-ai/interactive novel/""h-game"".  As such, as with most ren-ai games, there is actually LITTLE to NO animation outside of the opening theme and closing credits.  Most of the scenes are static or have only a few animated frames, with still-shots of the characters (though beautifully drawn still-shots, and with various facial expressions and poses).  The original version had characters' eyes twinkling and lighting effects, which have made it into this version in a slower form...but in short, don't expect to be watching an anime while playing!

In a similar note, Hourglass contains only the Japanese dialogue - presumably to keep production costs down for what is a very, very niche market - so there is no English dub.  You will hear the original Japanese voices for the characters - if you have a serious aversion to Japanese with subtitles then you may want to avoid Hourglass, but you'll be missing out on a great game (also as a ""trivia note"" - the ending theme to the game when you complete one of the good endings, ""Mirai kono Hoshi de"", is sung by Nana Mizuki, the voice actress for Kaho Serizawa!).

One option I would have liked would be a ""fast forward"" option.  You can chapter-skip ahead from a chapter, but if you do so, you miss what happened completely. A double-speed fast-forward with the Search buttons would have been great so we could tell if someone important showed up on a given day's activities, especially on the second and third (and fourth and so on) plays through, when a lot of days might start the same, but turn out very different later on depending on what you did in the past (or future!).

While on the subject of past and future events: since this game involves time travelling to days in haphazard order over the course of a summer, and (with a couple exceptions) only going to a day once - a calendar option would have been great. The original did have that, showing you which days you'd gone to and which day it currently was...sometimes it can become very confusing where (or when!) you are, especially if you're playing a few storylines one after another in succession.  As such, I had to jot down some notes here and there while playing so I could remember which days I'd gone to and what I'd done - perhaps keep a pen and paper handy the first couple times playing through.

For those worried about questionable ""adult"" content (hey, this IS a ren-ai game after all!) - Hourglass has none.  As far as I know, Hirameki removes hentai (adult) scenes from all their releases as a general practice, but an interesting note is that Hourglass didn't have hentai scenes originally anyway; they were added for the PC release by Berries, a few months after the original PS2 version from PrincessSoft (of which this version is a port).  So if you're squeamish about edited/censored imports, don't worry - Hourglass stands well on its own without such scenes, and the story really doesn't miss a beat without them, since they originally weren't there anyways.

All in all, Hourglass of Summer kept me entertained for an entire weekend - I found myself really interested in the various storylines available, and how they all fit together when you go through them and find out details which you might not have known from going through a different one.  I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who enjoys Japanese ren-ai/interactive novel games, especially since not only is Hourglass one of the best ones I've played, but it will support the translation of more games!

Definitely worth the purchase - even if a few technical issues and lack of a helpful liner notes insert count as minor knocks against what is otherwise a tremendously sweet and romantic story.",1122854400,13,6013,4.6660359508041624
8035437,4,B000300QFG,"I just wanted to add a quick note about the absence of passwords in this DVD mentioned in another review.

In the version I just received (May 2005) it says in the inside instructions that there ARE passwords with this game. I am using WinDVD on a PC to play/watch and so they are not needed (or available it seems).

But for those of you that may be playing on your PC and have a version of WinDVD or some similar program, you can most likely set your own bookmarks before exiting the game. In my version, it finds where you left off automatically even without a bookmark.

Just a tip.",1116288000,3,586,4.261261261261262
