But Hitting the Ground is an excelent film, that even those who like to watch 5 hour long films that would give the average country born redneck (such as myself) an aneurysm.
In fact, getting me to watch anything other than an action film is like trying to get a child to the dentist, it just isn't pretty.  But I did watch, and I did enjoy.  Maybe I liked it for it's portrayal of the media, or the theories of chaos that are so prevelent.
I could go on and on about the intricacies of this film, but like I said, I am not a film scholar, nor to I pretend to be.  So I leave it to those who are, or think they are to go in depth about the multitude of metaphors, social and political statements, and all that other stuff.
It is an excelent film, for anyone who wants to add a little bit of intellegence to their movie collection (maybe I'll put it right next to Spaceballs).",1003104000,2,1063,4.07177033492823
