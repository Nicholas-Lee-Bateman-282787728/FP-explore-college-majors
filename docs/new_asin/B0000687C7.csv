Needless to say, there's a lot of sex in this movie, most of it between the main character (played by the voluptuous Serena Grandi) and her various suitors.  As for the acting in this movie, it was OK, although that is hard to judge given that I saw an English-dubbed version of this movie, which is not the same as the DVD being sold by Amazon.  However, I enjoyed it and I only regret that I didn't see more of Ms. Grandi's movies while I lived in Italy for four years.  She alone is reason enough to get this movie.",1131840000,24,717,4.450381679389313
1722442,4,B0000687C7,"I bought this dvd based soley on the fact that Serena Grandi is in it. No one in North America really knows her, but where I'm from in Toronto they used to show her movies on the Italian Programming station over a decade ago.
This is a REAL Italian movie, and she is they way a woman should be built,if you like them voluptuous--- gorgeous.
The movie itself is very nicely shot, has a sensible and humorous storyline.
If you like Serena this is a must.",1046476800,35,452,4.267441860465116

7963695,4,B0000687C7,"Another excellent offering by Tinto Brass, treating us to the sensuous beauty of Serena Grandi A clever montage-opening, that sets-up an artful (and eyeful), erotic shot of Serena Grandi, as she's putting on her stockings! The voyeuristic-up-skirt shots, while she danced on the boardwalk, etc. ""Miranda"" from 1985, was written and directed by Tinto Brass (from a story/subject by Carla Cipriani). ""Miranda"" takes place in the post-war Italy of the 1950's (this seems to be 'Tintoretto's' favorite epoch). 'Miranda' (Serena Grandi) is a war widow running a tavern, where 4 men varying in age and origin, vie for her love and attention. There's the humble tavern-caretaker, the rich local aristocrat, the American G.I., and the headstrong and possessive 'Berto'. 'Miranda' will try them all on, but she will eventually give herself wholeheartedly to only one of them.

Once again, Tinto Brass has given us an erotic and funny film, that is also masking a much deeper and significant message! The usual eccentric and quirky characters are all in place too. But what really stands out here, is the excellent cinematography by Silvano Ippoliti, the Art Direction of Paolo Biagetti, and the music of Riz Ortolani. The lighting and color composition were sumptuously done. Especially significant, was the shot emphasizing the radiant natural beauty of Serena Grandi (looking out her window), juxtaposed with the start of another glorious day. Serena Grandi is actually a very decent actress! The film has been completely restored for this DVD release by Raro Video. This film is a must have, for all Serena Grandi admirers. PAL format, Italian (dolby-digital), no English/Italian subtitles, extras, FFN, NR 95 mins. (BTW: this review is for the Raro Video director's-cut DVD, which I bought through Amazon.it.)

Love and Peace,

7963696,2,B0000687C7,old fashioned and not really enough spice that we are used to with his recent movies. Hoping for better next time,1377993600,,113,4.428571428571429
7963697,1,B0000687C7,"this movie should be sold with a warning
it will bore you to death
the only thing i liked was andrea occhipinti's nude scenes",1370131200,,125,4.25
7963698,2,B0000687C7,"This was a major disappointment, particularly aver having seen&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Private/dp/B000GI3KSK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Private</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monamour/dp/B003ODKZTQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monamour</a>. I gave it a chance, I really did. But after 20 minutes this movie was putting me to sleep.

To begin with, this film lacks both the eroticism and the fun of other Brass movies. It even lacks the exposure; and then when you do finally get to see Serenda Grandi's unforgettable uh, grandis, you'd better be prepared also to see unshaven female underarms. I can't recall that that was the case with the other two movies above. Call me an obnoxious American if you want to, but I like my women to look like women, and not to have more body hair than I have.

The plot was dull, the characters were dull. I found it to be pretty typical of these foreign sex romps in that the female lead just won't settle down and plays multiple men at one time (essentially that's the plot...I think).

I definitely could have lived without seeing this one, much less buying it...and if you're a fan of soft-core porn, don't waste your time on this.",1344729600,,1276,5.776595744680851
7963699,4,B0000687C7,"If you want to see a dialogue with sex and a bit of drama about a MILF, then this is your title - but if you ain't in to what I just said exactly well...  then move on if you ain't into this particular director",1322265600,,210,3.6666666666666665
7963700,2,B0000687C7,"Disappointing is the word on this apparently censored version of Tinto Brass movie Miranda. While the story is not a big deal, the cuts made the movie much less enjoyable",1254528000,4,170,4.7
7963701,3,B0000687C7,"Serena Grandi is very, very, hot without question. Serena Grandi taking a piss is not. And certainly not the scene with the obnoxious Texan taking a dump in the woods. And worst yet, just to make sure you didn't miss this fantastic plot point, Tinto takes the liberty to shows you the actual turd. My, my, my. And the fact that that Texan didn't wipe his butt afterwards...well, gee wilikers Jed, I was just beside myself with erotic palpitations. Yeah, that some superb filmaking there. Not!!!!!!!  After watching three of Tinto Brass movies I am convinced this guy truly has a fetish for bodily fluids, urine in particular, with a occassional turd or two on top. When an otherwise talented director has to show you a woman urinating and people defecating in a scene that literary serves no purpose at all(even if its once)you know they ran out of ideas and talent. Sooooooooooo! How can you tell a good comedian is no longer funny? When piss and crap jokes become his whole act after nothing else is working. It's easier to gross you out than work on a new act. That axiom certainly holds true for directors as well. But, hey if you like this sort of thing, then you'll love what Miranda has to offer. Bon Apetite!!!!! Oh,and don't miss the anal scene at the end where he licks the blood among other things off his hand. Hmmmmmmm tasty.",1204675200,26,1338,4.575
7963702,2,B0000687C7,"After watching and enjoying a light sexy romp by Tinto Brass called Cheeky. I decided to try another Tinto brass movie. Alas, Miranda didn't do much for me.  Miranda is eighteen years older than Cheeky and that might be part of the problem; softcore movies may have loosend up in the intervening years.

But that wasn't the only problem. The women of Cheeky were generally more attractive to me. They were trimmer and slimmer as opposed to full figured and there were more of them. Underarm hair was shaved and the ladies pubis was trimmed in the latter movie.

The stories were about equally dumb and the acting in both cases was average. Still Cheeky caught my attention while Miranda lost it.",1161648000,11,695,4.680327868852459
7963703,2,B0000687C7,"If you dislike ""The Key"" then you won't like this one either. I find both films to be the least likeable films of Tinto Brass, who is otherwise a great director of Erotica. 2 stars for the leading lady... but that's it.",1142035200,10,219,4.238095238095238
