3100403,5,B0012Z36FI,"Have watched the first two seasons so far. Gorgeous prints and sound. Remarkable how a mid-sixties show holds up and doesn't come across dated. Imagine the great writers this show employed because every week for seven years they wrote a one hour sting movie! In this fourth season Martin  Landau left the show and was replaced by Leonard Nimoy just off the cancelled Star Trek series ( dumb Paramount executives! )His character was named Paris. Ironically, Martin turned down the Spock character and here we now have Nimoy replacing HIM on Mission Impossible!.. By the way Paramount, do we have to thank the ghost of Lucille Ball ( cause it was created by Desilu) for not screwing the public on the price by splitting it into two half seasons and charging the same price as an entire series like you have with Gunsmoke, Rawhide and the Untouchables? Shame on you. You should stop this practice immediately. We have only so much money to spend on DVD's. The Untouchables is four years, Rawhide is eight, and Gunsmoke is twenty. Please stop!

3100437,4,B0012Z36FI,"Very good. It would have been a nearly impossible mission for Leonard Nimoy to have satisfactorily replaced Martin Landau, and he doesn't. But he does a tolerably good job. The search for a replacement for Cinnamon results in a revolving door of fairly talented female actresses who all do a fairly good job. Over all, this is a good series.",1476489600,,341,4.7

SMART people doing their jobs well and though they have a leader they all have important roles to play in the success of the team.  Back then and even now I love all of the cool gadgets and plots that got the job done.

3100461,3,B0012Z36FI,"I still love the MI TV series but after Paramount let Martin Landau and Barbara Bain go in Season 4, the series lost most of its appeal for me.  The parade of ""stars"" they used to replace these two one of a kind actors was sad and disappointing, especially ""The Great Paris"".  There really was nothing great about his acting nor his ability to play multiple characters like Mr. Landau could.  It's too bad that money was allowed to ruin such a gold mine.  I think this series could have gone on for many more years if it hadn't been for the change-a-roo.",1467676800,,554,4.349514563106796

3100487,5,B0012Z36FI,"We are still enjoying watching the Mission Impossible series, even with the change in the cast of characters (Martin Landau and Barbara Bain are gone, Leonard Nimoy and Lee Meriwether replaces).  When you watch the episodes back to back, rather than once a week like the original viewings, you see certain similarities.  Like they use some of the actors again and again - this week so and so was an Eastern European army Major, three weeks ago he was a Latin American bandit, next week he is a Middle Eastern Sheik. The locations for the tape recorder and pictures tend to get reused as well, and of course the reel to reel tape recorders are reused.  And all the locations end up looking like southern California, because they all are in southern California. The same buildings, the same dirt roads through the mountains, etc.  It looks a bit cheesy to modern eyes, but back in the day when I first watched the shows, I was none the wiser.  They are still a lot of fun and give you a neat look back into America in the late 60s.",1461542400,,1029,4.452127659574468

3100491,3,B0012Z36FI,"I'm a fan - a huge fan - of MI, but Season 4 contains what might arguably be two of the worst episodes the series produced, and several not-so-good as well. The tiresome ""Chico"" (the near clone of the far superior Season 2's ""The Seal,"" but this time for dog lovers) and even worse ""Gitano"" are made even less impressive by having been aired back to back. The three part ""The Falcon"" could just as easily been a two part or even a single episode. To say nothing of including that stock footage of Barney in an elevator shaft squeezing himself against the wall as the elevator goes by. I think that appears at least once a season. There are two episodes that pander to the student movement (and there will be more in Season 5) ""Phantoms"" and ""The Martyr."" They are virtually indistinguishable, not because of identical plots, although they are similar, but because there's nothing distinctive or memorable about either. There are a few good episodes. I'm partial to ""The Crane,"" and its Purloined Letter hide-in-plain-sight device. ""The Numbers Game"" is good, largely because Nimoy has such a romp masquerading as a sort of Che Guevara revolutionary. ""The Double Circle"" is fun, and Anne Francis brings back a welcome sultriness as well as intelligence to the femme-agent of the week. I'm not a fan of Lee Meriwether's multiple appearances in that role - and yet she was cast many times over the lifetime of the series. Her attempt to look vulnerable and seductive in ""The Robot"" is almost painful to watch. She's far more successful when playing cool and intellectual than when stripped down to a very short slip and trying to charm the sleazy security officer (and why she was wearing nothing but that slip under her trench coat is a mystery never really explained.). I don't know why Francis was never given another nod, because she's very good here, and the series didn't get an effective female lead until Lynda Day George was hired for Season 6. Season 4 also ramps up the ""personal"" plot lines, with the team members being framed and falling in love with enemy agents, or otherwise foolishly compromising themselves.  I've given this season only three stars, consider it tough love, for when MI is good, it is very, very good, so when it is only okay or slightly above, it's an even greater disappointment.",1459814400,2,2312,4.73697270471464

3100493,5,B0012Z36FI,"Along with Season 3, one of the best of the 7 seasons. This is prior to the bottom falling out when the stories went south in Season 5 and beyond. They were still taking on the Eastern People's Republic, and not the mob. Paris was excellent, although I still preferred Rollin. The various female guest stars were generally good, although only Lee Meriwether came up to the standards of Barbara Bain.

3100600,5,B0012Z36FI,"Like all seasons this one too is great, but for me because of a different reason.  I like this season because it is an excellent example of how the series started having flaws in it episodes.  This is not a complaint, but an interesting facet of the program for me in terms of how it was handled and developed.  This particular episode has two main plot flaws which are common among the later episodes of the series.

It this short list I do not count things like Barney's ability to repair a 200amp power box that has just been hacked to pieces with an axe, using only a pair of pliers, screwdriver, and his bare hands.  A genius like Barney, does not even need the pliers and screwdriver.

1. Like most of the later seasons episodes, this one involves competing with some form of security agency.  Either a highly secure military location or some other group of security personal and apparatus.  In this case a form of security policy are involved under the direction of a supposed notorious bad guy.  Yet there is no security anywhere.  All locations are empty of guards, a group of several here-to-fore never seen people are allowed easy and instant access to a royal palace, no one is supervised at any time, and no background checks are made on anybody (not that the background checks would have done any good, since Barney would just take a ride in his always ready ""stat telefon"" truck, tap into the phone cables somewhere underground, and intercept whatever needs intercepting).  Not very good security.

2. They make a point of telling the audience in the very beginning that the drug they will be using, though it will fake the symptoms they need, is totally harmless and the prince (one of the bad guys) who they will give it to, will never be in any danger.  Yet one of the elements of the scam is to let the security commander kill the prince (collateral damage of a sort).  So why be so concerned about this bad guy prince, if your plan is to let someone else kill him anyway?  For me this is both a plot problem, and a cool part of the series; opening up for a lot of discussion with friends about the morality of the IMF and all that.

I still enjoyed it.  I like these flaws too.",1434240000,,2197,4.438902743142145

Jim Phelps leads this team.  Jim is not a traitor.  Nobody named Ethan Hunt is ever in this series (thank goodness).  It is a Desilu production and had a small budget (like Star Trek) but they still put out a good show.

Leonard Nimoy does a good job of replacing Martin Landau although it took me a long time during the original running of the series to get use to Nimoy (who I had always seen with pointy ears) playing Paris.

No fancy computer graphic or insane stunts in this series.  No multiple plots.  Just good old fashion intrigue and suspense.",1399161600,,720,4.5625

3100625,5,B0012Z36FI,"IMF fans were rightly concerned when Martin Landau and Barbara Bain left the show after season three but to many people's surprise season four contains some of the very best work that creator Bruce Geller and company ever did. Leonard Nimoy brought another dimension to Landau's character, adding more presence and a touch of flamboyance when needed. Even in the weaker episodes, Nimoy is fun to watch. Bain replacement Lee Meriwether filled in very nicely for the six episodes she was part of but after that the rotating female leads only made it more obvious how much Bain was missed. Surprisingly, after sixty some episodes of scripts that had to create a new, impossible mission for the force, the writers in season four produced some of the strongest scripts the show had ever worked with. That along with new producer Bruce Lansbury's guidance and a top notch production crew led to some of Mission's most memorable shows. Near the top was Mission's only 3-parter, The Falcon. Given its length, sets and surprisingly sustained plot, Falcon stands as one of Mission's greatest achievements. Not far behind is the claustrophobic The Controllers, featuring an inventive contract killer who momentarily outwits the crew; the inventive Robot, in which Nimoy has a field day playing five characters; the brilliant The Double Circle, in which Barney & Co. create a complete duplicate apt a floor below the original; one of the best known and highly regarded episodes (Submarine), in which the IMF team tricks a Nazi war criminal into revealing where funds are hidden (and containing one of Mission's most dramatic finales) and The Brothers, in which Phelps operates on a 'Saudi' prince in full view of the evil prince and his henchmen and Barney switches bodies from below.
Season four really is a tale of two cities, the first ten episodes being of high quality and the remaining shows struggling to achieve something interesting. Perhaps the series was simply running out of steam but one can't help but wonder what might have happened if Meriwether had been kept on and Paramount hadn't tightened the purse strings so much. It has to be mentioned that the Mission Impossible theme song was perhaps the greatest and most recognizable instrumental TV theme song of all time. And though MI didn't invent the quick cut montage, the opening of each episode that showed the most exciting moments to come in a rapid-fire montage was certainly groundbreaking.
If year four was Mission's last great season, certainly the first half of the season proved that there was plenty of imagination left in the series.",1395878400,,2602,4.997695852534562

3100661,4,B0012Z36FI,"It is almost impossible to discuss the fourth season of Mission Impossible, without mentioning the contract dispute that caused the husband and wife team of Martin Landau and Barbara Bain, to end their three year association with the highly successful program.  Paramount Studios refused to meet Landau's request to rise his salary, bringing about the last minute addition of Leonard Nimoy, who was available after winding up a three year stint as Mr. Spock on Star Trek.  The show's producers did not find a true replacement for Barbara Bain, who had won three consecutive Emmy awards for her portrayal of Cinnamon Carter.  Instead a number of actresses including Lee Meriwether, Anne Francis, Jessica Walter, Antoinette Bower, Julie Gregg, and Barbara Luna, filled in.  In nine of the twenty six episodes, there simply was no female IMF member.

With Landau's and Bain's departure, the show had a new look.  Jim Phelps (Peter Graves) was still running the operation, but having no one cast in Bain's role, created problems both for the cast, and for the audience who both never knew what to expect, week to week.  As The Great Paris, Nimoy assumed the roles normally reserved for Landau.  When impersonating a key figure, Paris employed conventional methods of disguise more often than the rubber masks, that the writers had overused with Landau.  While having no regular female IMF member created a huge void, it did provide the opportunity to expand the roles of Barney Collier (Greg Morris), and Willy Armitage (Peter Lupus).

Deception and masterful con jobs are what Mission Impossible is all about.  One of the best is ""The Submarine"", where in the East European Republic, Kruger Schtelman (Stephen McNally), who knows where loot stolen by the German SS in World War II is stashed away, is about to finish a 25 year prison term.  The IMF's mission is to find out where the money is, and prevent the growth of a neo-Nazi organization.  In classic fashion, the IMF convinces Schtelman that he is aboard a submarine, and is about to die, and soon he is screaming over and over, the secret he has kept for decades.  It's deliciously absurd.

Intrigue at the highest levels of government is familiar ground for the IMF.  One of their most ambitious undertakings is ""The Falcon"", which stretched over three episodes.  The plot reads like a fairy tale, where corrupt General Sabattini (John Vernon) is holding Prince Stephan (Joseph Reale) prisoner, in order to force Stephan's fianc Francesca (Diane Baker) to marry him, and make him first heir to the throne.  The current heir, is Francesca's cousin Nicolai (Noel Harrison), an adult with the mind of a child.  Fascinated by magic, Nicolai has invited the magician Zastro to perform at the palace.  Paris impersonates Zastro, while Tracey (Lee Meriwether) is the psychic Madame Vinsky.  In addition Barney temporarily losing his sight, Francesca is entombed alive, and the crown jewels are stolen.  What is most unusual, is that the plan unravels at the end, and the IMF has to scramble wildly, in order to complete the mission.

Adventure can occur anytime or anywhere.  In ""The Death Squad"", Barney and Jim are vacationing in the Latin American country of Cuidamo, when Barney gets involved with a local artist (Cicely Tyson).  He has a scuffle with a jealous admirer, and the man is accidentally killed.  Police Chief Corba (Pernell Roberts) is in the habit of executing prisoners without a trial.  As the dead man happens to be Corba's brother, Barney is under a death sentence, and Paris and Willy arrive to help.  Leon Askin, and John Shuck also appear in this exciting ""unofficial"" adventure.

At its best, Mission Impossible is like a magician's illusion, where knowing that what you are seeing isn't real, doesn't necessarily detract from the enjoyment of the performance.  With outlandish plots, set in fictional locations, often with slim ties to reality, and major loose ends, it is hard to regard Mission Impossible as anything other than an outrageous fantasy.

Lalo Schifrin wrote the theme for Mission Impossible, and helped to establish the musical tone for the program, with his unique selection of tonalities and instrumentation.  Composer Jerry Fielding, who wrote the theme for Hogan's Heroes, adds a distinct ""Hoganesque"" flavor to Mission Impossible's music in season four.

Which of the female IMF operatives did the best job is debatable, but Lee Meriwether was the only actress featured in more than one mission, and reportedly wanted the role very badly.  Of the rest, Jessica Walter seemed to have both the maturity and cool to be suitable, however the matter would become moot, when Lesley Ann Warren was chosen as a regular in season five.  Other radical changes would come as series creator Bruce Geller, would be kicked off from his own show.  Season four was a struggle, as besides the crisis with the cast, the show also had problems finding writers who could produce the unique kind of scripts the series required.  Overall the quality of the shows was good, but not great.

Image quality varies, but is generally very good, as in some closeups you can remarkable facial detail.  The subtitling often helps with figuring out some of the names and fictional locations.  Unfortunately there are no extras.  It would have been nice to have had some contribution from Leonard Nimoy, but he may have less than warm feelings about the show.",1279670400,15,5422,4.986651835372636

3100664,4,B0012Z36FI,"This review may contain spoilers.

I borrowed Season Four from my local library.  Given that I am VERY familiar with Leonard Nimoy's work as Mr. Spock of Star Trek, I was VERY impressed with his work as ""Paris"", the newest member of the IM Force.  I also had a lot of fun spotting other Star Trek actors and remembering the episodes that I had seen them in, (i.e. who remembers T'Pring from Amok Time?).  I enjoyed the fact that Leonard Nimoy, (the former Mr. Spock), was in an episode that involved his ""former Vulcan wife"".

I was also pleasantly surprised to spot other actors from other TV series from my childhood, i.e. Pernell Roberts, formerly of Bonanza, and Barry Williams, formerly of The Brady Bunch.  Seeing their faces again brought back fond memories.

However, the final episode of Season Four, ""Martyr"", was NOT to my liking!  To me, it felt like the script writers took the Star Trek episode, ""The Way to Eden"" and recycled it.  The writers also seemed to have forgotten one very important ingredient....persuading the audience into having a willing suspension of disbelief.  This episode expected me to believe that Paris, (Leonard Nimoy), could pass for a 25-year-old college student in 1970.  By this point, Mr. Nimoy was well into his 30's, possibly approaching 40, and there was NO way I could believe he was a 25-year-old.  Handsome as he is, in 1970, he did not have a 25-year-old face.  He was clearly much older than the character he was pretending to be.

Because of the way this last episode of Season Four was produced, I'm giving the Fourth TV Season of Mission Impossible four stars instead of five.",1248912000,3,1630,4.73404255319149

3100669,5,B0012Z36FI,"Season Three of Mission Impossible had major upheavals in which the main writers of the series abruptly quit.  The show survived this by brining in Paul Playdon as lead writer and Stanley Kallis as Producer.  Season Four began with even more potentially damaging changes as Martin Landau and Barbara Bain also abruptly left the show.  To replace Landau's ""Rollin Hand"" character who wore masks and impersonated other people, Leonard Nimoy was brought in as ""Paris"" (we never learn his first name). Nimoy is not the actor Landau is, and he complained later that he was not given enough challenging roles, but he was adequate.  His best performances were in the episodes ""Gitano"" and ""The Code"" which otherwise were not among the best stories.  Later in the season, lead writer Paul Playdon left the show due to exhaustion, along with Producer Stanley Kallis.  In spite of this, the show continued to make fine entertaining episodes, in spite of the fact that no single leading lady actress was brought in to replace Barbara Bain's ""Cinnamon Carter"" character.
In two especially good episodes, ""The Crane"" and ""The Submarine"", the IM Force has to race the clock as intensive police cordons are zeroing in on them while they have to deceive a leader of a police state or break an ""unbreakable"" prisoner.  On the whole, this season has as many fine episodes as do the preceding seaons, in spite of the difficulties the cast and crew faced. Highly recommended.",1225238400,6,1455,4.914285714285715

3100671,5,B0012Z36FI,I just love the old MI series and they keep getting better. The stories were so much better as the years went by and the acting in this set was superb.,1223769600,2,151,3.903225806451613
3100672,4,B0012Z36FI,"Season 4 of Mission: Impossible continues the intricate missions and cerebral plots of the previous seasons. With the departure of Martin Landau and Barbara Bain after season 3, there's some new blood in the IMF this year: Leonard Nimoy joins the cast as new master of disguise Paris, while various guest stars are recruited to fill the female agent role.

Watching this series for the first time, I find the introduction of Paris to be a nice change of pace. While none of the agents are ever developed much and Paris is pretty much Rollin Hand, a fresh face does draw attention from what are the increasingly noticeable flaws in the series - the repeated use of the same backlot sets and California locations, stories that strain believability with the IMF predicting every thought and action of their targets, and cliffhangers that are resolved almost immediately. The fun is still there, and the payoff at the end of each episode is still worth it, but the show isn't quite as fresh as it was a few seasons back.

Still the addition of Paris works, and the rotating female agents mix things up too (since it makes more sense to change agents as needed by the mission, and it also brings some relevance back to the dossier selection scene that precedes most of the stories). Notable is Lee Meriwether, who appears in a handful of episodes, and you end up wishing if they'd selected a permanent female agent this season, it would've been her. She certainly matches Bain in style and beauty. Standout episodes this season include a faked submarine voyage in ""The Submarne,"" ""Lover's Knot"" and ""Death Squad"" which break the usual story mold, and ""The Falcon"" which is a well-paced 3-parter with some genuine twists. If you're in the mood for more classy 60's spy action that takes itself seriously, season 4 of Mission: Impossible still delivers the goods.",1223164800,3,1856,4.796875
3100673,4,B0012Z36FI,"The fourth season of Mission: Impossible finds the series making a second major change in cast. After season one Stephen Hill was replaced by Peter Graves which was a very positive change. After the third season the team loses Martin Landau (Rollin Hand) & Barbara Bain (Cinnamon). To the best of my knowledge Landau wanted a big raise but CBS wouldn't give it; Bain quit in support of Landau, they were married at the time. So in season four Leonard Nimoy joins the cast replacing Martin Landau but no permanent replacement was made for Bain. I distinctly remember this change & looked eagerly toward the new season. I was a big fan of Leonard Nimoy after his portrayal of Mr. Spock from the legendary series Star Trek. I didn't have anything against Landau, I enjoyed his performances very much &, honestly, CBS made a wise decision in not attempting to replace Bain.

The fourth season of Mission: Impossible has a total of 26 episodes &, like any series, there are some good episodes & some weak episodes. The opening episode, ""The Code"" was a good choice for the premiere introducing the character Paris to the viewing public. ""Numbers Game"" is one of the team's most complicated efforts. ""The Submarine"" is even more elaborate. ""The Falcon"" is a three part episode that has no padding; this story is a strong one. I think that casting could have cast someone else in the role that Noel Harrison does, he's not the best actor in the world. It seems to me that with this episode CBS was making a conscious effort to appeal to younger viewers. ""Gitano"" has a young Barry Williams (Greg Brady from The Brady Bunch) portrays a 12 year old king. ""Lover's Knot"" might be the set's weakest episode in which the team goes to London. Paris falls for a foreign agent & doesn't like the consequences the lady will have to face. I'm not saying it isn't possible for an agent to become romantically involved but this was a VERY professional team. Some of it might be because I didn't feel that Nimoy was very convincing in this episode. ""Death Squad"" is an unique episode in the Mission: Impossible catalog; Barney is accused of Murder while on vacation with Jim in a Spanish speaking locale. It dispenses with the normal ""Good Morning, Mr. Phelps..."" bit & shows the team at their ad-libbing best having to create a plan on the spot. Pernell Roberts guest stars making his second appearance in a Mission: Impossible episode. Season four closes with ""The Martyr"" another weak episode that makes a strong appeal to younger viewers.

There aren't any bonus features unless you include subtitles. There is a warning that ""some episodes may be edited from their original network versions"" though, honestly, I can't tell. It's been a long time since I have seen these episodes. Of course this IS CBS/Paramount who became notorious with their release of The Fugitive, Season 2, Vol. 1. But the tampering as in the previous season releaes has been kept to a minimum.",1221523200,4,2951,4.728155339805825
3100674,3,B0012Z36FI,"Many fans will miss the presence of Martin Landau and Barbara Bain in this fourth season. They both added a very distinctive flavor to the show.

Replacing them were Mr. Spock... sorry, Leonard Nimoy... and a stream of guest actresses, some good, others very much of ""guest star"" stature or worse.

Nimoy starts out rough. His acting for the first handful of episodes is flat and insipid. Later, he starts to show more range and variety and it becomes interesting to see different sides of him. I suspect that this is at least in part due to bad directing in the early episodes. It doesn't take long for Nimoy to relinquish the title of worst actor among the regulars to Peter Graves.

Once the new cast hits its stride, it's back to being enjoyable, but Landau and Bain weren't the only ones who got dumped. So was plausibility.

In the first three seasons, the scenarios mostly tended to be built around highly improbable situations and confluences of favorable events, but while extremely unlikely, they were still plausible. In the fourth season, plausibility is thrown to the wind and you find our happy-go-lucky crew instantly writing 200-page books that pass muster when experts in the field read them and wielding sci-fi gadgets like holographic projectors. Sticking to the plausible made the first 3 seasons seem clever. Gone is the cleverness, replaced by cheap theatrics and so much divine intervention that the ancient Greek thespians themselves would cringe at the abuse.

It's still fun to watch, but it's a lower form of art than the previous seasons.",1217980800,13,1566,4.8943396226415095

The only small complaint I have is the lack of extras. I would love to be able to watch a small featurette in which cast and crew members discuss the 4th year of the show or if select cast and crew members would have a commentary or to during specific episodes.

I am also finding familiar plots. Compare The Numbers Game with The Submarine. In both, the IMF is trying to obtain a bank account number. Compare Fools Gold with other counterfeiter episodes. Even some of the guest actors reappear from earlier episodes.

I am also tired of seeing studio buildings (The Submarine) and the same obvious locations in the suburbs, being used over and over again -- same buildings, different country, LOL.

Unfortunately, this was the last season of the high ratings. Just when the show was high on the hog, the departure of Bain & Landau didn't set well with some, but was welcome for others.

If you could lump all of the things that made Mission great, the episode that shows this is here: Submarine.
Voted a fan favorite & an award winner, it compiles all that made Mission good.

The whole set contains great a transfer, excellent sound quality & all that is to love about the greatest spy show ever.

The show continued with its great guest stars, sometimes complicated plots, and skillful use of the ""con the bad guys"" approach that was the hallmark of the series. Graves came in and fit seamlessly at the same time his brother James Arness was continuing his long run as Matt Dillon on Gunsmoke. A notable addition to this season was the arrival of Paris, a master of disguise, played with gusto by Leonard Nimoy, fresh off of what would later be a legendary performance as Mr. Spock on Star Trek.

This show will always be treasured for its pioneering plot devices and its challenge to the viewer to keep up with what was going on. It's great that this series is finally on DVD.",1208044800,5,798,4.612676056338028

But, hey, actors and actresses come and go, depending on their acting ability. The better they are they want to get paid more and if they don't get what they want, they just quit
! This is only human. I will forgive the couple. But the world of Mission Impossible still goes on with or without them. I like to see through the end of the 7th. After this, my wish to see the HIGH CHAPARRAL SERIES with 98 episodes and hope Paramount will take into consideration of this popularity and demand just like Mission Impossible, The Fugitive and other well-produced series.

3100693,5,B0012Z36FI,"You step into the fourth season (1969-1970) of ""Mission: Impossible"", produced by two men: Stanley Kallis from season 3 and newcomer Bruce Lansbury (former ""Wild Wild West"" producer) who brings with him writer Ken Pettus, and, above all, it's creator Bruce Geller's final input before his departure. Witness if you will two  paramount changes: a new master of disguises named Paris (played by Leonard Nimoy) and a legion of female agents but only one appear almost regularly (six times): Tracey (played by Lee Meriwether aka Bruce Geller's protge) and she gives her best performance as fortune-teller Mrs. Vinsky in the three parter ""The Falcon"". You'll find three top episodes: ""The Controllers, Part I & II"" (guest starring David Sheiner and Dina Merrill), ""The Falcon, Part I, II & III"" (a superb monarchist and adventure story written by scripts genius Paul Playdon and guest starring John Vernon, Diane Baker and Noel Harrison), ""Submarine"" (guest starring Stephen McNally), and a selection of good ones: ""The Crane"", ""Fool's Gold"", ""Gitano"", ""The Choice"", ""Orpheus"" (written by scripts genius Paul Playdon and guest starring Albert Paulsen and Jessica Walter), ""The Numbers Game"", ""The Code"", ""Robot"" (guest starring Malachi Throne and Larry Linville), ""The Double Circle"" (guest starring Anne Francis). Actor Leonard Nimoy shines in three episodes: ""The Code"" as Che Guevara-like revolutionary El Lider, ""The Falcon"" as flamboyant magician Zastro, ""The Choice"" as Rasputine-like charlatan Emile Vautrain. Supported by producer Bruce Lansbury, writer Laurence Heath introduces private episodes centered around the love affair of IMFers: Paris (""Lover's Knot"") and Barney (""Death Squad"").

Imagine the great writers this show employed because every week for seven years they wrote a one hour sting movie! In this fourth season Martin  Landau left the show and was replaced by Leonard Nimoy just off the cancelled Star Trek series ( dumb Paramount executives! )His character was named Paris. Ironically, Martin turned down the Spock character and here we now have Nimoy replacing HIM on Mission Impossible!.. By the way Paramount, do we have to thank the ghost of Lucille Ball ( cause it was created by Desilu) for not screwing the public on the price by splitting it into two half seasons and charging the same price as an entire series like you have with Gunsmoke, Rawhide and the Untouchables? Shame on you. You should stop this practice immediately. We have only so much money to spend on DVD's. The Untouchables is four years, Rawhide is eight, and Gunsmoke is twenty. Please stop!

3334958,3,B0012Z36FI,"I still love the MI TV series but after Paramount let Martin Landau and Barbara Bain go in Season 4, the series lost most of its appeal for me.  The parade of ""stars"" they used to replace these two one of a kind actors was sad and disappointing, especially ""The Great Paris"".  There really was nothing great about his acting nor his ability to play multiple characters like Mr. Landau could.  It's too bad that money was allowed to ruin such a gold mine.

3334984,5,B0012Z36FI,"We are still enjoying watching the Mission Impossible series, even with the change in the cast of characters (Martin Landau and Barbara Bain are gone, Leonard Nimoy and Lee Meriwether replaces).  When you watch the episodes back to back, rather than once a week like the original viewings, you see certain similarities.  Like they use some of the actors again and again - this week so and so was an Eastern European army Major, three weeks ago he was a Latin American bandit, next week he is a Middle Eastern Sheik. The locations for the tape recorder and pictures tend to get reused as well, and of course the reel to reel tape recorders are reused.  And all the locations end up looking like southern California, because they all are in southern California. The same buildings, the same dirt roads through the mountains, etc.  It looks a bit cheesy to modern eyes, but back in the day when I first watched the shows, I was none the wiser.  They are still a lot of fun and give you a neat look back into America in the late 60s.",1461542400,,1029,4.452127659574468

3334988,3,B0012Z36FI,"I'm a fan - a huge fan - of MI, but Season 4 contains what might arguably be two of the worst episodes the series produced, and several not-so-good as well. The tiresome ""Chico"" (the near clone of the far superior Season 2's ""The Seal,"" but this time for dog lovers) and even worse ""Gitano"" are made even less impressive by having been aired back to back. The three part ""The Falcon"" could just as easily been a two part or even a single episode. To say nothing of including that stock footage of Barney in an elevator shaft squeezing himself against the wall as the elevator goes by. I think that appears at least once a season. There are two episodes that pander to the student movement (and there will be more in Season 5) ""Phantoms"" and ""The Martyr."" They are virtually indistinguishable, not because of identical plots, although they are similar, but because there's nothing distinctive or memorable about either. There are a few good episodes. I'm partial to ""The Crane,"" and its Purloined Letter hide-in-plain-sight device. ""The Numbers Game"" is good, largely because Nimoy has such a romp masquerading as a sort of Che Guevara revolutionary. ""The Double Circle"" is fun, and Anne Francis brings back a welcome sultriness as well as intelligence to the femme-agent of the week. I'm not a fan of Lee Meriwether's multiple appearances in that role - and yet she was cast many times over the lifetime of the series. Her attempt to look vulnerable and seductive in ""The Robot"" is almost painful to watch. She's far more successful when playing cool and intellectual than when stripped down to a very short slip and trying to charm the sleazy security officer (and why she was wearing nothing but that slip under her trench coat is a mystery never really explained.). I don't know why Francis was never given another nod, because she's very good here, and the series didn't get an effective female lead until Lynda Day George was hired for Season 6. Season 4 also ramps up the ""personal"" plot lines, with the team members being framed and falling in love with enemy agents, or otherwise foolishly compromising themselves.  I've given this season only three stars, consider it tough love, for when MI is good, it is very, very good, so when it is only okay or slightly above, it's an even greater disappointment.",1459814400,2,2312,4.73697270471464

3335097,5,B0012Z36FI,"Like all seasons this one too is great, but for me because of a different reason.  I like this season because it is an excellent example of how the series started having flaws in it episodes.  This is not a complaint, but an interesting facet of the program for me in terms of how it was handled and developed.  This particular episode has two main plot flaws which are common among the later episodes of the series.

It this short list I do not count things like Barney's ability to repair a 200amp power box that has just been hacked to pieces with an axe, using only a pair of pliers, screwdriver, and his bare hands.  A genius like Barney, does not even need the pliers and screwdriver.

1. Like most of the later seasons episodes, this one involves competing with some form of security agency.  Either a highly secure military location or some other group of security personal and apparatus.  In this case a form of security policy are involved under the direction of a supposed notorious bad guy.  Yet there is no security anywhere.  All locations are empty of guards, a group of several here-to-fore never seen people are allowed easy and instant access to a royal palace, no one is supervised at any time, and no background checks are made on anybody (not that the background checks would have done any good, since Barney would just take a ride in his always ready ""stat telefon"" truck, tap into the phone cables somewhere underground, and intercept whatever needs intercepting).  Not very good security.

2. They make a point of telling the audience in the very beginning that the drug they will be using, though it will fake the symptoms they need, is totally harmless and the prince (one of the bad guys) who they will give it to, will never be in any danger.  Yet one of the elements of the scam is to let the security commander kill the prince (collateral damage of a sort).  So why be so concerned about this bad guy prince, if your plan is to let someone else kill him anyway?  For me this is both a plot problem, and a cool part of the series; opening up for a lot of discussion with friends about the morality of the IMF and all that.

I still enjoyed it.  I like these flaws too.",1434240000,,2197,4.438902743142145

Jim Phelps leads this team.  Jim is not a traitor.  Nobody named Ethan Hunt is ever in this series (thank goodness).  It is a Desilu production and had a small budget (like Star Trek) but they still put out a good show.

Leonard Nimoy does a good job of replacing Martin Landau although it took me a long time during the original running of the series to get use to Nimoy (who I had always seen with pointy ears) playing Paris.

No fancy computer graphic or insane stunts in this series.  No multiple plots.  Just good old fashion intrigue and suspense.",1399161600,,720,4.5625

3335122,5,B0012Z36FI,"IMF fans were rightly concerned when Martin Landau and Barbara Bain left the show after season three but to many people's surprise season four contains some of the very best work that creator Bruce Geller and company ever did. Leonard Nimoy brought another dimension to Landau's character, adding more presence and a touch of flamboyance when needed. Even in the weaker episodes, Nimoy is fun to watch. Bain replacement Lee Meriwether filled in very nicely for the six episodes she was part of but after that the rotating female leads only made it more obvious how much Bain was missed. Surprisingly, after sixty some episodes of scripts that had to create a new, impossible mission for the force, the writers in season four produced some of the strongest scripts the show had ever worked with. That along with new producer Bruce Lansbury's guidance and a top notch production crew led to some of Mission's most memorable shows. Near the top was Mission's only 3-parter, The Falcon. Given its length, sets and surprisingly sustained plot, Falcon stands as one of Mission's greatest achievements. Not far behind is the claustrophobic The Controllers, featuring an inventive contract killer who momentarily outwits the crew; the inventive Robot, in which Nimoy has a field day playing five characters; the brilliant The Double Circle, in which Barney & Co. create a complete duplicate apt a floor below the original; one of the best known and highly regarded episodes (Submarine), in which the IMF team tricks a Nazi war criminal into revealing where funds are hidden (and containing one of Mission's most dramatic finales) and The Brothers, in which Phelps operates on a 'Saudi' prince in full view of the evil prince and his henchmen and Barney switches bodies from below.
Season four really is a tale of two cities, the first ten episodes being of high quality and the remaining shows struggling to achieve something interesting. Perhaps the series was simply running out of steam but one can't help but wonder what might have happened if Meriwether had been kept on and Paramount hadn't tightened the purse strings so much. It has to be mentioned that the Mission Impossible theme song was perhaps the greatest and most recognizable instrumental TV theme song of all time. And though MI didn't invent the quick cut montage, the opening of each episode that showed the most exciting moments to come in a rapid-fire montage was certainly groundbreaking.
If year four was Mission's last great season, certainly the first half of the season proved that there was plenty of imagination left in the series.",1395878400,,2602,4.997695852534562

Still, a good collection of US versus THEM, the THEM mostly being commies or other types of goons. Includes one really bizarre episode with lots of hippies and folk songs. If there is a recurring fault with this season of Mission Impossible it was the way that it pandered to a younger audience by having episodes which revolved around ""youth movements"" in the Eastern Bloc... the only youth movements in the Eastern Bloc were Communist ones (come to think of it, so were most of the ones in the Western Bloc).

3335158,4,B0012Z36FI,"It is almost impossible to discuss the fourth season of Mission Impossible, without mentioning the contract dispute that caused the husband and wife team of Martin Landau and Barbara Bain, to end their three year association with the highly successful program.  Paramount Studios refused to meet Landau's request to rise his salary, bringing about the last minute addition of Leonard Nimoy, who was available after winding up a three year stint as Mr. Spock on Star Trek.  The show's producers did not find a true replacement for Barbara Bain, who had won three consecutive Emmy awards for her portrayal of Cinnamon Carter.  Instead a number of actresses including Lee Meriwether, Anne Francis, Jessica Walter, Antoinette Bower, Julie Gregg, and Barbara Luna, filled in.  In nine of the twenty six episodes, there simply was no female IMF member.

With Landau's and Bain's departure, the show had a new look.  Jim Phelps (Peter Graves) was still running the operation, but having no one cast in Bain's role, created problems both for the cast, and for the audience who both never knew what to expect, week to week.  As The Great Paris, Nimoy assumed the roles normally reserved for Landau.  When impersonating a key figure, Paris employed conventional methods of disguise more often than the rubber masks, that the writers had overused with Landau.  While having no regular female IMF member created a huge void, it did provide the opportunity to expand the roles of Barney Collier (Greg Morris), and Willy Armitage (Peter Lupus).

Deception and masterful con jobs are what Mission Impossible is all about.  One of the best is ""The Submarine"", where in the East European Republic, Kruger Schtelman (Stephen McNally), who knows where loot stolen by the German SS in World War II is stashed away, is about to finish a 25 year prison term.  The IMF's mission is to find out where the money is, and prevent the growth of a neo-Nazi organization.  In classic fashion, the IMF convinces Schtelman that he is aboard a submarine, and is about to die, and soon he is screaming over and over, the secret he has kept for decades.  It's deliciously absurd.

Intrigue at the highest levels of government is familiar ground for the IMF.  One of their most ambitious undertakings is ""The Falcon"", which stretched over three episodes.  The plot reads like a fairy tale, where corrupt General Sabattini (John Vernon) is holding Prince Stephan (Joseph Reale) prisoner, in order to force Stephan's fianc Francesca (Diane Baker) to marry him, and make him first heir to the throne.  The current heir, is Francesca's cousin Nicolai (Noel Harrison), an adult with the mind of a child.  Fascinated by magic, Nicolai has invited the magician Zastro to perform at the palace.  Paris impersonates Zastro, while Tracey (Lee Meriwether) is the psychic Madame Vinsky.  In addition Barney temporarily losing his sight, Francesca is entombed alive, and the crown jewels are stolen.  What is most unusual, is that the plan unravels at the end, and the IMF has to scramble wildly, in order to complete the mission.

Adventure can occur anytime or anywhere.  In ""The Death Squad"", Barney and Jim are vacationing in the Latin American country of Cuidamo, when Barney gets involved with a local artist (Cicely Tyson).  He has a scuffle with a jealous admirer, and the man is accidentally killed.  Police Chief Corba (Pernell Roberts) is in the habit of executing prisoners without a trial.  As the dead man happens to be Corba's brother, Barney is under a death sentence, and Paris and Willy arrive to help.  Leon Askin, and John Shuck also appear in this exciting ""unofficial"" adventure.

At its best, Mission Impossible is like a magician's illusion, where knowing that what you are seeing isn't real, doesn't necessarily detract from the enjoyment of the performance.  With outlandish plots, set in fictional locations, often with slim ties to reality, and major loose ends, it is hard to regard Mission Impossible as anything other than an outrageous fantasy.

Lalo Schifrin wrote the theme for Mission Impossible, and helped to establish the musical tone for the program, with his unique selection of tonalities and instrumentation.  Composer Jerry Fielding, who wrote the theme for Hogan's Heroes, adds a distinct ""Hoganesque"" flavor to Mission Impossible's music in season four.

Which of the female IMF operatives did the best job is debatable, but Lee Meriwether was the only actress featured in more than one mission, and reportedly wanted the role very badly.  Of the rest, Jessica Walter seemed to have both the maturity and cool to be suitable, however the matter would become moot, when Lesley Ann Warren was chosen as a regular in season five.  Other radical changes would come as series creator Bruce Geller, would be kicked off from his own show.  Season four was a struggle, as besides the crisis with the cast, the show also had problems finding writers who could produce the unique kind of scripts the series required.  Overall the quality of the shows was good, but not great.

Image quality varies, but is generally very good, as in some closeups you can remarkable facial detail.  The subtitling often helps with figuring out some of the names and fictional locations.  Unfortunately there are no extras.  It would have been nice to have had some contribution from Leonard Nimoy, but he may have less than warm feelings about the show.",1279670400,15,5422,4.986651835372636

3335161,4,B0012Z36FI,"This review may contain spoilers.

I borrowed Season Four from my local library.  Given that I am VERY familiar with Leonard Nimoy's work as Mr. Spock of Star Trek, I was VERY impressed with his work as ""Paris"", the newest member of the IM Force.  I also had a lot of fun spotting other Star Trek actors and remembering the episodes that I had seen them in, (i.e. who remembers T'Pring from Amok Time?).  I enjoyed the fact that Leonard Nimoy, (the former Mr. Spock), was in an episode that involved his ""former Vulcan wife"".

I was also pleasantly surprised to spot other actors from other TV series from my childhood, i.e. Pernell Roberts, formerly of Bonanza, and Barry Williams, formerly of The Brady Bunch.  Seeing their faces again brought back fond memories.

However, the final episode of Season Four, ""Martyr"", was NOT to my liking!  To me, it felt like the script writers took the Star Trek episode, ""The Way to Eden"" and recycled it.  The writers also seemed to have forgotten one very important ingredient....persuading the audience into having a willing suspension of disbelief.  This episode expected me to believe that Paris, (Leonard Nimoy), could pass for a 25-year-old college student in 1970.  By this point, Mr. Nimoy was well into his 30's, possibly approaching 40, and there was NO way I could believe he was a 25-year-old.  Handsome as he is, in 1970, he did not have a 25-year-old face.  He was clearly much older than the character he was pretending to be.

Because of the way this last episode of Season Four was produced, I'm giving the Fourth TV Season of Mission Impossible four stars instead of five.",1248912000,3,1630,4.73404255319149

3335166,5,B0012Z36FI,"Season Three of Mission Impossible had major upheavals in which the main writers of the series abruptly quit.  The show survived this by brining in Paul Playdon as lead writer and Stanley Kallis as Producer.  Season Four began with even more potentially damaging changes as Martin Landau and Barbara Bain also abruptly left the show.  To replace Landau's ""Rollin Hand"" character who wore masks and impersonated other people, Leonard Nimoy was brought in as ""Paris"" (we never learn his first name). Nimoy is not the actor Landau is, and he complained later that he was not given enough challenging roles, but he was adequate.  His best performances were in the episodes ""Gitano"" and ""The Code"" which otherwise were not among the best stories.  Later in the season, lead writer Paul Playdon left the show due to exhaustion, along with Producer Stanley Kallis.  In spite of this, the show continued to make fine entertaining episodes, in spite of the fact that no single leading lady actress was brought in to replace Barbara Bain's ""Cinnamon Carter"" character.
In two especially good episodes, ""The Crane"" and ""The Submarine"", the IM Force has to race the clock as intensive police cordons are zeroing in on them while they have to deceive a leader of a police state or break an ""unbreakable"" prisoner.  On the whole, this season has as many fine episodes as do the preceding seaons, in spite of the difficulties the cast and crew faced. Highly recommended.",1225238400,6,1455,4.914285714285715

3335169,4,B0012Z36FI,"Season 4 of Mission: Impossible continues the intricate missions and cerebral plots of the previous seasons. With the departure of Martin Landau and Barbara Bain after season 3, there's some new blood in the IMF this year: Leonard Nimoy joins the cast as new master of disguise Paris, while various guest stars are recruited to fill the female agent role.

Watching this series for the first time, I find the introduction of Paris to be a nice change of pace. While none of the agents are ever developed much and Paris is pretty much Rollin Hand, a fresh face does draw attention from what are the increasingly noticeable flaws in the series - the repeated use of the same backlot sets and California locations, stories that strain believability with the IMF predicting every thought and action of their targets, and cliffhangers that are resolved almost immediately. The fun is still there, and the payoff at the end of each episode is still worth it, but the show isn't quite as fresh as it was a few seasons back.

Still the addition of Paris works, and the rotating female agents mix things up too (since it makes more sense to change agents as needed by the mission, and it also brings some relevance back to the dossier selection scene that precedes most of the stories). Notable is Lee Meriwether, who appears in a handful of episodes, and you end up wishing if they'd selected a permanent female agent this season, it would've been her. She certainly matches Bain in style and beauty. Standout episodes this season include a faked submarine voyage in ""The Submarne,"" ""Lover's Knot"" and ""Death Squad"" which break the usual story mold, and ""The Falcon"" which is a well-paced 3-parter with some genuine twists. If you're in the mood for more classy 60's spy action that takes itself seriously, season 4 of Mission: Impossible still delivers the goods.",1223164800,3,1856,4.796875
3335170,4,B0012Z36FI,"The fourth season of Mission: Impossible finds the series making a second major change in cast. After season one Stephen Hill was replaced by Peter Graves which was a very positive change. After the third season the team loses Martin Landau (Rollin Hand) & Barbara Bain (Cinnamon). To the best of my knowledge Landau wanted a big raise but CBS wouldn't give it; Bain quit in support of Landau, they were married at the time. So in season four Leonard Nimoy joins the cast replacing Martin Landau but no permanent replacement was made for Bain. I distinctly remember this change & looked eagerly toward the new season. I was a big fan of Leonard Nimoy after his portrayal of Mr. Spock from the legendary series Star Trek. I didn't have anything against Landau, I enjoyed his performances very much &, honestly, CBS made a wise decision in not attempting to replace Bain.

The fourth season of Mission: Impossible has a total of 26 episodes &, like any series, there are some good episodes & some weak episodes. The opening episode, ""The Code"" was a good choice for the premiere introducing the character Paris to the viewing public. ""Numbers Game"" is one of the team's most complicated efforts. ""The Submarine"" is even more elaborate. ""The Falcon"" is a three part episode that has no padding; this story is a strong one. I think that casting could have cast someone else in the role that Noel Harrison does, he's not the best actor in the world. It seems to me that with this episode CBS was making a conscious effort to appeal to younger viewers. ""Gitano"" has a young Barry Williams (Greg Brady from The Brady Bunch) portrays a 12 year old king. ""Lover's Knot"" might be the set's weakest episode in which the team goes to London. Paris falls for a foreign agent & doesn't like the consequences the lady will have to face. I'm not saying it isn't possible for an agent to become romantically involved but this was a VERY professional team. Some of it might be because I didn't feel that Nimoy was very convincing in this episode. ""Death Squad"" is an unique episode in the Mission: Impossible catalog; Barney is accused of Murder while on vacation with Jim in a Spanish speaking locale. It dispenses with the normal ""Good Morning, Mr. Phelps..."" bit & shows the team at their ad-libbing best having to create a plan on the spot. Pernell Roberts guest stars making his second appearance in a Mission: Impossible episode. Season four closes with ""The Martyr"" another weak episode that makes a strong appeal to younger viewers.

There aren't any bonus features unless you include subtitles. There is a warning that ""some episodes may be edited from their original network versions"" though, honestly, I can't tell. It's been a long time since I have seen these episodes. Of course this IS CBS/Paramount who became notorious with their release of The Fugitive, Season 2, Vol. 1. But the tampering as in the previous season releaes has been kept to a minimum.",1221523200,4,2951,4.728155339805825
3335171,3,B0012Z36FI,"Many fans will miss the presence of Martin Landau and Barbara Bain in this fourth season. They both added a very distinctive flavor to the show.

Replacing them were Mr. Spock... sorry, Leonard Nimoy... and a stream of guest actresses, some good, others very much of ""guest star"" stature or worse.

Nimoy starts out rough. His acting for the first handful of episodes is flat and insipid. Later, he starts to show more range and variety and it becomes interesting to see different sides of him. I suspect that this is at least in part due to bad directing in the early episodes. It doesn't take long for Nimoy to relinquish the title of worst actor among the regulars to Peter Graves.

Once the new cast hits its stride, it's back to being enjoyable, but Landau and Bain weren't the only ones who got dumped. So was plausibility.

In the first three seasons, the scenarios mostly tended to be built around highly improbable situations and confluences of favorable events, but while extremely unlikely, they were still plausible. In the fourth season, plausibility is thrown to the wind and you find our happy-go-lucky crew instantly writing 200-page books that pass muster when experts in the field read them and wielding sci-fi gadgets like holographic projectors. Sticking to the plausible made the first 3 seasons seem clever. Gone is the cleverness, replaced by cheap theatrics and so much divine intervention that the ancient Greek thespians themselves would cringe at the abuse.

I should have stopped watching with the first three seasons. The fourth season just doesn't cut it with me.",1212105600,12,633,4.962264150943396
3335182,5,B0012Z36FI,"I was so looking forward to Mission Impossible the fourth season.  Even though Martin Landau(Sorry if I spelled his name wrong) is good, I enjoy Leonard Nimoy so much more.  He is so great as Paris.  I also don't think the quality of the show diminished when the cast changed either.  I just hope season five is as good, but I don't think I will be disappointed in Leonard.",1211328000,,373,4.36231884057971

Same great quality audio/video & as good as Landau & Bain were, Nimoy does a good job too.  The scripts are still solid & I highly recommend this set.",1210809600,,257,3.9038461538461537
3335184,4,B0012Z36FI,"Being a looong time Mission fan, this season was my personal favorite. It told the viewers we can make a huge cast change & still hit it big.

Unfortunately, this was the last season of the high ratings. Just when the show was high on the hog, the departure of Bain & Landau didn't set well with some, but was welcome for others.

If you could lump all of the things that made Mission great, the episode that shows this is here: Submarine.
Voted a fan favorite & an award winner, it compiles all that made Mission good.

The whole set contains great a transfer, excellent sound quality & all that is to love about the greatest spy show ever.

A true diamond in anyone's collection.",1210723200,14,681,4.380952380952381
3335185,5,B0012Z36FI,"I found it very misleading to have the main credit of this season to be Barbara Anderson,who according to internet movie database only appeared during 1972 in 7 episodes. Surely Peter Graves or Leonard Nimoy should be given top credits for the 4th season?. This has been long awaited by Nimoy fans and contains some really great episodes ..highly recommended !",1209427200,5,360,4.918032786885246
3335186,5,B0012Z36FI,"Mission Impossible - The Fourth TV Season continues the groundbreaking episodes that made this show so fun to watch.

The show continued with its great guest stars, sometimes complicated plots, and skillful use of the ""con the bad guys"" approach that was the hallmark of the series. Graves came in and fit seamlessly at the same time his brother James Arness was continuing his long run as Matt Dillon on Gunsmoke. A notable addition to this season was the arrival of Paris, a master of disguise, played with gusto by Leonard Nimoy, fresh off of what would later be a legendary performance as Mr. Spock on Star Trek.

This show will always be treasured for its pioneering plot devices and its challenge to the viewer to keep up with what was going on. It's great that this series is finally on DVD.",1208044800,5,798,4.612676056338028
3335187,4,B0012Z36FI,"I have fond memories of this show in re-runs. Nimoy was great as Paris the new master of disguises. I particularly remember an episode where he does Japanese Kobuki(sic). Strange there was a series a few years later called ""The Barbary Coast"" where William Shatner plays a con-man/master of disguise in old San Francisco. Even forty years later this show looks like it was done yesterday. Great quality.",1205884800,3,403,4.9411764705882355
3335188,5,B0012Z36FI,"Undoubtedly, I'm an ardent fan of Mission Impossible TV series which would run to the 7th Season ultimately. Just placed an order for the 4th. I will look forward to seeing the coming series the soonest. Too bad that Martin Landau and Barbara Baine are no longer present in the 4th. But, hey, actors and actresses come and go, depending on their acting ability. The better they are they want to get paid more and if they don't get what they want, they just quit
! This is only human. I will forgive the couple. But the world of Mission Impossible still goes on with or without them. I like to see through the end of the 7th. After this, my wish to see the HIGH CHAPARRAL SERIES with 98 episodes and hope Paramount will take into consideration of this popularity and demand just like Mission Impossible, The Fugitive and other well-produced series. And Paramount should know that High Chaparral is also a high revenue earner if it has the vision for the fans all over the world. Cheers.",1204934400,2,985,4.5083798882681565

3335190,5,B0012Z36FI,"You step into the fourth season (1969-1970) of ""Mission: Impossible"", produced by two men: Stanley Kallis from season 3 and newcomer Bruce Lansbury (former ""Wild Wild West"" producer) who brings with him writer Ken Pettus, and, above all, it's creator Bruce Geller's final input before his departure. Witness if you will two  paramount changes: a new master of disguises named Paris (played by Leonard Nimoy) and a legion of female agents but only one appear almost regularly (six times): Tracey (played by Lee Meriwether aka Bruce Geller's protge) and she gives her best performance as fortune-teller Mrs. Vinsky in the three parter ""The Falcon"". You'll find three top episodes: ""The Controllers, Part I & II"" (guest starring David Sheiner and Dina Merrill), ""The Falcon, Part I, II & III"" (a superb monarchist and adventure story written by scripts genius Paul Playdon and guest starring John Vernon, Diane Baker and Noel Harrison), ""Submarine"" (guest starring Stephen McNally), and a selection of good ones: ""The Crane"", ""Fool's Gold"", ""Gitano"", ""The Choice"", ""Orpheus"" (written by scripts genius Paul Playdon and guest starring Albert Paulsen and Jessica Walter), ""The Numbers Game"", ""The Code"", ""Robot"" (guest starring Malachi Throne and Larry Linville), ""The Double Circle"" (guest starring Anne Francis). Actor Leonard Nimoy shines in three episodes: ""The Code"" as Che Guevara-like revolutionary El Lider, ""The Falcon"" as flamboyant magician Zastro, ""The Choice"" as Rasputine-like charlatan Emile Vautrain. Supported by producer Bruce Lansbury, writer Laurence Heath introduces private episodes centered around the love affair of IMFers: Paris (""Lover's Knot"") and Barney (""Death Squad""). The music scores are very strong, especially two: ""The Controllers"" composed by Jerry Fielding and ""Submarine"" by Lalo Schifrin.",1201737600,69,1822,5.601449275362318

8248431,4,B0012Z36FI,"This DVD package of Mission: Impossible The Fourth Season features all  26 episodes of the series which originally aired on CBS during the 1969-70 season. While the show was at the height of its popularity at the time, it was enveloped in turmoil as the fourth season went into production in the spring of 1969. Martin Landau, who, along with his wife, Barbara Bain, had been with the show since its inception and was seen as many as the shows real star, had an acrimonious falling out with Paramount, the studio which produced the series, when his annual contract came up for renewal. Shortly after that Bain departed the show as well. Additionally, a new producer, Bruce Lansbury, was brought in, and the studio, never happy about the costs necessary to produce the show, became even more tight-fisted.

In the eyes of many fans, the departure of Landau and Bain was the beginning of the end of the show; the carefully-created chemistry which had been a hallmark of the show since season one was gone, never to be recreated again. It would take a year before the show would feature a woman among the weekly regulars again, for Season Four guest stars, such as Jessica Walters and Lee Meriwether., would fill in.  While they would, for the most part, be fine, the lack of a familiar weekly heroine would be one of the shortcomings of Season Four.

For Landau a replacement was found literally right on the Paramount lot. Leonard Nimoy, fresh off playing the emotionally-repressed hyper-logical Mr. Spock on Star Trek, was called in, first as a temporary seat-filler for Landau, then being named a permanent member of the cast. His character was The Great Paris, world renowned illusionist and master of disguises (it was the sort of character an entire show could be built around). At least for this season, Nimoy seems to enjoy being liberated from playing the human Kabuki mask that was Spock; in Mission he gets to play a wide range of characters, from Two Thirds World revolutionary leader to Middle European peasant to Rasputinesque monk. Its fun watching him express his underwritten characters inner emotional lives through line readings, vocal inflections, even facial expression, and he elevates every scene hes in.

The episodes themselves run the gamut from classic to serviceable, with many falling somewhere in-between. The show itself is the arch-type of episodic TV. Each week the enigmatic Mr. Phelps receives a brief message on a tape recorder lying out the problem he has to solve (if you decide to accept it), he assembles his team to implement the solution he has worked out, and then the mission is underway. While technically considered a spy thriller, Mission at its essence is really a weekly caper film, with the I.M.F. force perpetuating an elaborate con on unsuspecting dictators, military strongmen, enemy agents, and international outlaws in order to uncover some vital piece of information, stop a dangerous plot that threatens world piece, or unmask a traitor.

The rule of thumb is the better the con the better the episode, and Season Four offers some real classics, including The Submarine, in which a soon-to-be-paroled official of Nazi Germany, believing he in an actual submarine being depth-charged,  is conned into giving out the number of the super secret Swiss bank account which the Nazis stored all their ill-gotten loot, and Phantoms, in which guest star Luther Adler plays an Eastern European dictator who comes to believe the spirt of his dead wife has come back to haunt him. Making somebody believe World War II has broken out would become a shopworn plot device for the series, but here, in Numbers Game, the concept is both fresh and a little chilling. Fools Gold, in which Paris, at one point, has to break into a bank vault, destroy counterfeit money, and get out before the high-frequency alarm system turns his brains to mush, ranks as suspenseful an episode as any in the series history.

Other stand-out episodes in Season Four include the two-parter The Controller, set in an Eastern bloc country developing a mind-control drug,  and the three-parter The Falcon in which the I.M.F. attempts to prevent the overthrow of a  Middle European royal family that is friendly towards the United States. These episodes really represent the last time Mission would  feature the large-canvas story-telling and big budget production values that the creators originally envisioned for the show. As usual, several episodes rank as oddities. Gitano offers the opportunity to see a soon-to-be Greg Brady in drag. In The Martyr, an autocratic leader attempts to hijack a Worlds Youth Conference. The story is  is set overseas, but the conniving politician seems a stand-in for certain American political leaders at the time. (This is also one of the very few Mission: Impossible episodes that is drawn squarely from the headlines of the late 1960s).

This season would also see the creative team start to tweak the show here and there, diverting, if only by a little, from the rigid set formula. Sometimes, now,  the team members would encounter unplanned for problems, such as in The Raven, when Barney suffers a concussion and goes temporarily blind, and an explosion reveals Pariss real identity before he can make his clean get-away. In Lovers Knot, Paris begins to develop actual feelings for a British aristocrat who may be working for the other side. The most radical departure occurs in Death Squad, which, for the first time dispenses with the usual format all together, and has the team working off the books to save Barney from a corrupt, sadistic chief of police.

 But overall Season Four includes the usual quota of just-this-side-of-plausible gizmos and technical sleight-of-hand by Barney, hidden identities revealed at the last moment by pulling masks off, and James Bond-style moments of suspense fans of the show came to love.

Overall Season Four offers hours of enjoyable entertainment for fans of well-crafted classic TV shows with an espionage flavor.  One note: Its important to remember that Mission Impossible was produced during a time when TV shows were completely episodic, each episode its own stand-alone narrative unit, meant to be watched once, at a time and date set by the networks.  Which is to say they were not conceived with todays habit of binge-watching in mind. If you start watching these shows back-to-back, the seams will start to show; plots and narrative devices will begin to re-occur, guest stars, sets, exteriors, re-appear with frequent regularity.  This is a show best watched in installments.

Perhaps the best review for Mission: Impossible Season Four comes from guest star Luther Adler: This show is meshuga! I love it!",1488585600,3,6716,5.0161725067385445
