6016354,5,B00FOHHO80,I am a huge fan of Eastbound & Down so this final season DVD was a must have. I would recommend to anyone who likes the show.,1401408000,2,125,3.6666666666666665
6016355,5,B00FOHHO80,This final season was great and hilarious. I would recommmend this to anyone who loves a good laugh and TV show.,1400889600,,112,4.380952380952381
6016356,3,B00FOHHO80,"Was not as good as previous seasons, and predictable at times sad way to end series.  Long live Kenny Powers",1400889600,,108,4.4
6016357,5,B00FOHHO80,"Ordered this as a gift for my bf for xmas, and we just got it the other day!  It was not released yet on video.",1400457600,,111,3.44
6016358,3,B00FOHHO80,"I don't think there's any doubt that Eastbound and Down is one of the funniest comedy series to come along in a long time.  Every season, Kenny Powers managed to be one of the worst humans ever put to film, but somehow to make you root for him in the end.  Even though he consistently made selfish decisions and treated other people horribly, there was still an ember of a good guy underneath all the craziness.  Plus there were so many situations in the other seasons that were just too hilarious not to make you laugh and forgive Kenny a little bit..  He was over the top way more than he was right.  The fourth season takes most of the characters to a really dark place, and I didn't feel like there was enough redemption to bring up that tail spin.  I don't want to give away any spoilers, but those of you who have seen the season know what I'm talking about.  I did think the last episode was pretty amazing, but I'm not sure it was good enough to bring up the rest of the season.

Also where is Ashley Schaefer?!  Come on?!  No final showdown?!",1399248000,,1051,4.262626262626263
6016359,5,B00FOHHO80,"This was certainly the right way to wrap up the series!  Way to go, McBride!  You are one of the best!",1396828800,,102,3.8095238095238093
6016360,5,B00FOHHO80,"God Bless the people who put this series together. This IS the funniest thing I've ever seen. Season 4, with Ken Marino, is genius. Marino nails it as a retired athlete egomaniac like you've never seen. Not to mention our ""hero"" Danny McBride, as the best character ever written for the screen.

Christina Ginder",1396742400,,312,4.777777777777778
6016361,5,B00FOHHO80,I do think this is the weakest season overall but several standout moments and a mind blowing last 5 minutes make it more than worth owning if you love the show.,1394064000,,161,4.225806451612903
6016362,5,B00FOHHO80,"Man, am I happy that Mr. McBride and co. came back for one more season.

Only 5 episodes in, and I really think this might be the best season of Eastbound & Down yet. It's as hilarious as ever, but also it's a great character study. The season starts off with Kenny living as a normal everyday guy working at a car rental place. Although he hates his job, he has a loving wife and family, but that isn't enough for KP. One of my favorite moments of the show is when April is getting an award for being the best real estate agent, Kenny is standing in the back of the crowd listening to her acceptance speech, not happy, but angry. Is this really his life?

I don't want to spoil anything that happens, but definitely check out this season (and the others, obviously-- but you probably already have), it has not disappointed so far.

I will edit this review after the conclusion of the season, and series. I am excited, scared, and just flat out sad for what the final episodes of Eastbound & Down will hold.

--UPDATED--

Wow, what a finish. This season was flawless in my opinion, and it ended on a truly remarkable and hilarious note. Will go down as one of the funniest shows to ever grace television, without a doubt.",1383177600,29,1221,4.361233480176211

6016370,5,B00FOHHO80,"7 years in the making and worth every minute of it. Binge watch this series and ride the ups and downs, it's amazing, you can't stop feeling of success and failures of Kenny and crew. Kenny is like someone you might have known in high school. Kenny gets money and is self destructive, abusive and then he snaps out of it and showers his family and friends with love and respects. The jet-ski and jet pack gags are great. There are times when you'll blush if you're in mixed company at some of the gags. Everything is a gas, Seeing lots of big name actors in the different episodes is a goof. Will Farrel is a super character that does battle with Kenny. Binge watch this series if you're feeling low or bummed with your station in life; it will lift your spirits. Buy the whole series it's a gem. I wish it could keep going.",1480118400,3,824,4.288461538461538

So's Steve Little - the guy who plays Stevie.  Don't watch this until you watch every episode of seasons 1-3 in order though.  There's a definite story line that you need to follow to make sense of this show.  All in all, a brilliant comedy.  Would have given season 4 a score of 4.5 stars (if that were possible on this site).",1448841600,,494,4.180851063829787

6016438,5,B00FOHHO80,"The final, epic chapter of Eastbound is delivered with just as much raw aggression and knuckle-whitening intensity as the fist two seasons. The series begins with a hard-working, family man version of Kenny Powers, he has a steady job and a lovely wife but of course, is absolutely miserable. By the final episodes of the series we see Powers back on top, filled with bravado, drugs and his trademark contempt for everyone around him. The dialogue is as strong as always, I cringed and laughed simultaneously for most of the show as usual, ans the strong involvement of Katy Mixon as April saw the quality of acting soar to record heights. Danny McBride, Ben Best and Jody Hill deliver this totally satisfying conclusion to a truly poignant and important television show with delicacy and brutality, which is just what it deserves.",1405296000,3,831,4.900709219858156
