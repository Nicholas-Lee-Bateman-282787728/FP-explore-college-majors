6494012,3,B00LO1T0FU,"The original title was ""Roundabout American"" but for deceptive marketing the ""American Pie"" similarity took over. The film is not a spoof of American Pie, but more like ""Risky Business"". Alex (Edouard Giard) leaves France for someone he met on line, someone who has a boyfriend. While drunk, he mentions starting an upscale pizza and escort service. Ron (Patrick Zielinski) an unkempt individual who knows Chicago and people helps Alex turn his musing into a lucrative business.

The concept was better than executed. Patrick Zielinski leads a group of quirky characters that made the film watchable.

Okay for a comedy rental that borders on a teen sex comedy.

6494085,2,B00LO1T0FU,"The story revolves around a heart broken French chef (writer, actor Edouard Giard) who came to America to meet a woman he has been having a long distance relationship. On his arrival he is jilted and left alone. Drowning his sorrows in a dive bar he meets a halfwit who befriends him and after some nights of senseless drinking he suggests Giard meet up with an escort to take some of that rejection pain away. Together, the chef, halfwit and escort decide to start an escort service hidden under the guise of a gourmet pizza delivery service. And hilarity ensues. Or does it? For me this was largely a fractured funny bone of a film. It tries hard and it does have some comedic value, but it misses far more times that it hits the target. The actress who plays escort is the best of the lot. She delivers her lines well and doesn't look like she is acting. The rest are wooden and unrefined. There are some funny scenes that I chuckled at, they just weren't there enough for a good comedy. They tried. They really tried to make a film. Yet the production quality is amateurish. Set photography is poor quality. The acting is forced more times than not.

If you are looking for a T&A film, it is okay, just scan the newspaper or something while it plays in the background. If you are looking for something to give you belly laughs and leave you with a smile, then look elsewhere. This slice will leave you looking for Zantac. This film is not even listed on IMDB. Really? I can find information on UCLA film school shorts on IMDB. That should make you wonder just who cobbled together this worn out shoe of a movie. It sounds like I hated this movie. I did not hate it. I expected more from it. All I want from a comedy is to come away with a some laughs and a smile and feel my valuable time wasn't wasted. Edouard Giard owes 2 hours of life. I'll settle for a double Amaretto on the rocks to help me forget this one.",1426896000,,1918,4.313019390581718

6494180,3,B00LO1T0FU,"douard Giard and Marielle de Rocca-Serra were especially good in this movie. There is, unfortunately, also some not-so-good acting from others, and frankly the story is pretty clichd. And yet, somehow it all works okay. The movie is filled with some great original music, including some pieces de Rocca-Serra helped with lyrics and vocals, and it breaks from the formula at least a little bit, enough to set it apart.

Alex has come to America to meet a woman he met online, only to find that she's involved with someone else. We never find out how things go with her and her new apparently abusive and controlling boyfriend; I guess that's a whole other movie, as she dumps Alex off at a low-rent motel and that's the last we see of her.

Alex drowns his sorrow in a nearby bar, where he gets drunk and comes up with a brilliant (in movie-land anyway) business idea, and meets one of his new business partners (Ron) who gives him a ride home. He has no recollection of this the next day, so Ron has to explain it all to him. Alex is initially skeptical, but after hiring an ""escort"" of his own (who escorts him nowhere, except his own hotel room), comes around to the idea. Add Bob and the escort Helena as partners, along with subcontractor pizza master Reza, and we're off to the races.

There's plenty of the usual devices: crooked politicians, Chicago gangsters, not-so-subtle foreshadowing, to name a few. It's not a ground-breaking movie at all.

But it's a fun romp with some good lines and reasonably harmless and lighthearted conflicts to move the story forward.

This movie was apparently released originally under the name ""Roundabout American"", which was probably a better name than ""American Slice"" if for no other reason than that it avoids a comparison with the very different ""American Pie"". ""American Slice"" is much more in the ""rags to riches to rags"" mold, and not all in the ""highschool sex romp"" category, a distinction the cover art does little or nothing to help make.",1411171200,4,1992,4.712643678160919
