8761500,5,B01FT6W0GG,"This is definitely a nice work out but I must have missed the fine print because you do need to buy extra items if you don't have them at home. A aeropilates circle, a small workout ball and therapy bands. I did have to order a couple of these items online in order to do these a good amount of these exercises. But once you have it all she has great ideas and I definitely felt it the next day. I also like that they are broken up into about 20 min workouts. So if you want to do just one you can or add on from there. Definitely worth getting!",1484092800,3,545,3.918918918918919
8761501,5,B01FT6W0GG,"I absolutely love this video! It literally has changed my body. I feel longer, leaner and stronger. I have a two year old toddler so it makes it difficult for me to get away to a Pilates studio. Working out at home is the perfect for my situation. Sheena makes each workout fun and challenging. Best workout video I've ever done.",1471219200,,329,4.409836065573771
8761502,5,B01FT6W0GG,"I love this video! I have been doing Pilates in a studio for years and until now I haven't found a video that inspires me to practice at home. Sheena is a great instructor - she has a fun personality and is motivational. The video is easy to follow, fun to do and best of all effective! It is broken down into sections to allow for your workout to be customized. Perfect for a busy schedule! I highly recommend this video.",1470182400,,422,4.222222222222222
