943239,4,6304950136,"A drifter (Vince Vaughn) befriends the son of a sultry widow's emotionally crippled twenty-one-year-old son, defying her efforts to keep the boy submissive.

I do not know most of the actors in this drama, they being of a different generation than I and therefore new to me, but the parts were well played and the story told held my attention, although there was little actual action involved.  This is a psychological story, heavy with allegory and emotional undertones.

Well worth viewing.

943240,1,6304950136,"OR so little story, so much (125mins) time.
That this film has a running time OVER 2 hours, and has had little or no theatrical recognition, immediately activates my senses. This length will complicate scheduling on  pay-cable, and meant pressing an additional disk for the laser package.  Why?. One possibility (rare) is that it is truly an auteur's masterpiece,  not for the masses, maybe, but important enough, as is, to be kept intact.  The more likely scenario  is  that this  movie is such a waste of time that  everyone involved could really care less what gets released. By now  they've all changed their names, left town, and moved onto the  next..
Predictably, The Locusts falls into category 2. Vince Vaughan in a  muscle shirt and Ashley Judd with her cotton dress flying in the wind are  about all this film has on the plus side. Dragging and nagging situations,  disconnected dialogue, and uncertain motivation tend to make most every  frame tortuous to endure.
First time-writer-directors (John Patrick  Kelley here) tend to script a very personal project, one based on material  with which they are intimately familiar-they draw on their strength.  Subsequent efforts can wane, as the writer ventures into more unfamiliar  territory. With this in mind, I leave you with 2 questions: (1) Where in  the world did this story come from? And (2) What can we expect from John  Patrick Kelly when he starts writing from an unfamiliar point of view  ?
The answers may scare you.",951868800,7,1486,4.911290322580645
943241,4,6304950136,Vaugh has created another masterpiece. When you watch the movie you must try to get into the deranged head of Flyboy. But be careful because you never quite no where this twisted movie will take you. I love Vaugh and  think he's a genius. This is a must see movie!!!!,920764800,2,267,4.34
943364,5,6304950136,Very good movie and loved seeing a younger Jessica Capshaw in the same movie as her mother. I would highly recommend!,1357171200,,117,4.619047619047619
943365,5,6304950136,This movie was just another garage sale buy for me when people were getting rid of all their VHS tapes.  Its turned out to be one of my favorites!  I was so happy to get it as a DVD.  Its another one of those movies everyone seems to have missed but when I convince them to watch it people like it alot. It has a riveting story but is emotionally disturbing because of the immense pain the characters are suffering thru and it runs along the theory that you are what you experience in life.  I think its a look at the effects of pain and injustice that evil leaves upon our souls and the  hope that we have that there is goodness left in the world and that it will triumph over evil and the realization that in the real world evil wins a lot more than we care to admit!!,1355270400,,770,4.0394736842105265
943366,5,6304950136,Love the movie. Unexpected ending. I have seen this movie 3 times and I don't usually watch things twice. Bought it for my friend. The challenged son is what gives it believability....,1336348800,,184,4.78125
943367,2,6304950136,"""The Locusts"" can be summed up (perhaps unfairly) as ""Vince Vaughn ain't Paul Newman"".

The writer and director, John Patrick Kelley, obviously loves degenerate Southern melodrama. And as I strongly believe in ""learning through imitation"", I have no right to criticize him for attempting to reproduce the kind of film he enjoys. But that doesn't mean ""The Locusts"" is successful.

""The Locusts"" is a mechanical copy of plays and films from an era Kelley (probably) hasn't lived through. It's noteworthy that Kelley has a character talk about ""the parameters of a relationship"", something no one outside academia would have said in 1960 (assuming /anyone/ said it). When Flyboy asks Clay if he wants to hear one of his late father's records, it's an LP, not a 78. And how dumb can you be to name the villainess ""Mrs Potts""? (Angela Lansbury would likely have played the part more-convincingly than Kate Capshaw.)

The ending is poorly motivated and ludicrously overwrought, more likely to provoke laughter than tears.

With the exception of Jeremy Davies' Flyboy, the performances are uniformly flat and uninteresting. The writing is uneven and the direction uninspired; the actors wind up looking bad. The photography is similarly dull and devoid of atmosphere.

If you're new to screenwriting (as I am), I nevertheless encourage you to see ""The Locusts"", as a outstanding example of how /not/ to write a genre film.",1327104000,,1416,5.112554112554113
943368,3,6304950136,"As in most movies, the viewing audience is polarized on this Southwestern potboiler. Some like it a lot while others....not so much. I found it watchable but little else. Somehow it all seemed so familiar.

The plot involves a drifter (Vaughn) who is on his way to California to (supposedly) see his brother. He needs cash and hires on with a feed ranch. Varied sorts of troubles ensue and things go South rather quickly.

The cast is pretty good. This must have been earlier in the careers of Paul Rudd and Vince Vaughn but they still do an admirable job. Jeremy Davies is good but he usually plays a nut case so there isn't much new there. Ashley Judd is pretty to look at and she does a decent job, but her character wasn't written particularly well. The big surprise was Kate Capshaw. I guess it's good she married Steven Spielberg, because the horrendous job she does acting in this would pretty much cut off the rest of her career.

The directing is pretty much meat and potatoes. Carter Burwell's music score is good and the other areas of production are all professional. I guess I just didn't believe it all. It's almost a caricature of the genre. As though someone had seen Hud or Of Mice and Men and tried to ""one-up"" those films.

If you like this sort of film and have time on your hands, have at it. If not, don't bother.",1279584000,,1335,4.436734693877551

943370,2,6304950136,"Kate Capshaw can be so appealing, but not so much in this movie.  Vince Vaughn is more than just the comedian, in this one.",1275091200,,123,4.125
943371,5,6304950136,"THE LOCUSTS is an extraordinary movie, what will
please the viewers, from the originality of the
story, and from the harmonious mix of actors chosen. It's
the story of how everyone is unique, each person has their own
strengths and weaknesses, life experiences, social
pressures and too often, people have only a limited
road on which they can walk, on the path of Life and Work.

Clearly, Vince Vaughn is at his best in this movie,
feeling at ease and natural in the role of an ""older
brother"" to another individual, who is stigmatized,
psychologically impaired, and physically disabled, named Flyboy.

The character is played convincingly by Jeremy Davies, who
perhaps some may underestimate, considering the later valuable role in
Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. Kate Capshaw, does a fine job.

Some have noted the manic, omnipresent ""smoking"" of this
movie, which defies explanation. Perhaps it's just a
device that was seen as having worked well in the
earlier movie, with Judd too, SMOKE, perhaps the director decided
to employ it in LOCUSTS as well.

The most difficult to believe part, is when Vaughn, a
total stranger to a small town, hooks up, and gets hired
on the basis of one beer, in the local tavern. However,
for the remainder of the movie, all the scenes are
extremely believable and the story unfolds convincingly, thus
captivating the viewers' attentions.

Overall, what makes this movie succeed, is the charm and
""utopia"" of another time and space, perhaps 200 years ago,
of a small town, in rural America, aside from the
tragic, and insidious story underpinning how Flyboy's
humanity was destroyed as a child, for example. Other aspects
that many will find interesting, is the libido between
Vaughn and the girls on the farm, including Ashley Judd,
the unease felt by the other men feel in face of all of this, the
tension of a new hired hand joining the group, learning
an entirely new, and unappetizing profession, and more.

LOCUSTS simply takes the viewer on a trip for 90 minutes,
and as such is a valuable addition to a collection. Judd's
presence simply makes the movie even more appealing.",1270166400,,2119,4.921568627450981
943372,4,6304950136,"Although the subject line is very dark and hopeless, the acting was over the top.  I have never seen Vince Vaughn more beautiful and passionate... This is the first movie I saw him in and it caused me to want to see all his movies thereafter.  Now, it seems, he is bent toward more comical and silly films.  Still, in this movie he gives a performance full of presence.  One might even compare him to a young Paul Newman or dare I say?.... even Brando? It must have been the 'wife beater' shirts...
Jeremy Davies plays the part of a broken [but gentle] man-child, with grace.  His presence in each scene will only incite the most empathetic of all virtues from the viewer.  Truly, I wanted only to save him and it was frustrating to see the tragic turn of events that was to seal his doom.  It is my observation that Jeremy goes on to play many roles similar to this one.

Kate Capshaw is nothing less than brilliant and persuasive.  She conveys the epitome of the evil human being; so full of selfishness; a soul completely absent of conscience; a mother completely devoid of maternal feelings... ""Mommy Dearest"" will seem like a walk in the park compared to Kate's character.

I believe this movie is worth watching.  The lack of hope and the onslaught of sorrow might have you feeling empty; much the way reading, ""The Grapes of Wrath"" may make you feel, but it's truly a movie that deserved a closer look.  I can't imagine why this isn't to become one on the list of classics.

I disagree with the criticisms that others have given this movie in the previous reviews.  The attempts at compassion and befriending may be shallow (and indeed they are) but they are no different than those attempts in the movie ""Of Mice and Men"".  There is reason for this, I believe.  The strength is in the main characters and their own private hell... no so much in their intamacy with each other.",1261267200,2,1884,4.497058823529412
943373,1,6304950136,"Rarely do I read other reviews before I write my own. I want to focus on a careful expression of my thoughts before allowing the influence of the considered (and often excellent) opinion of others. But I just didn't care enough about this movie to try to think carefully and then express carefully. I wanted to dash off a review--and quickly check to see if others were also offended--to warn to avoid this film. So, first, these opinions from other reviewers:

""Nagging and dragging"". . . Exactly!

""Nauseating"". . . Exactly!

It is sickening to see this level of cruelty and hatred in a film. Anything positive here--the fun and sexy relationships between the young couples, the camaraderie between workers, between drinkers, the attempts at compassion, at befriending--seems so shallow, so trite, so false. Anything evil here--the hatred of the mother, the sexual sin of the son--seems so real, so true. This is sickening stuff. This isn't a film; it is a pathology report.",1218153600,4,976,4.939024390243903
943423,4,6304950136,"If you are a Tennessee Williams fan, The Locusts is a ""must have"" film for your collection. No, it's not by Tennessee Williams, but it might as well be.

Certainly owing a great debt to the masterful Southern playwright, this film has all the elements of one of Williams' plays. There's the heat, the rural locale, the unspoken mystery, the sexy male drifter and the faded Southern belle.

The Locusts takes place in the 1950's. With the arrival of a drifter, (Vince Vaughn), life changes for many residents of the small town. He gets hired on by the local feed ranch's owner, an aging drunken widow (Kate Capshaw). Clay, the drifter, quickly becomes her new lover, and in the process, also befriends her quiet teen aged son ""Flyboy"" (Jeremy Davies). The boy hasn't spoken a word in years and is completely withdrawn since the death of his father. He only speaks to his pet bull. Clay tries to get the boy out of his shell, much to the chagrin of the boy's mother. Clay doesn't understand what's going on, but soon it is all revealed and Clay realizes he's stumbled into a hornet's nest.

The acting is superb and the craftsmanship of the film is excellent. Ashley Judd and Paul Rudd also appear in smaller, but pivotal roles. This is a fine film.

I still swear it has to be a Williams' play.....",1186704000,2,1297,4.553648068669528
943424,5,6304950136,"Stellar acting from a great ensemble and a plot that could have been written by Flannery O'Connor, Truman Capote and Erskine Caldwell during an all night drinking session. Only disappointment was the last 30 seconds of the film -- a Hollywood ending to a Southern Goth only leaves one wanting more.",1172966400,6,298,4.862745098039215
943425,4,6304950136,"I have a thing about Ashley Judd. She is one of my favorite actresses so it's not surprising that I look for her movies. Last night I watched `The Locusts,' a slow moving movie of high drama set in rural Missouri and of course featuring Ashley Judd as Kitty, who was actually supporting actress to, Kate Capshaw who played Delilah Ashford Potts.

The way the story goes, the widow Potts owns Ashford farm, a cattle feed farm, employing many of the area's young men and occasionally taking one of them as her lover.

Clay Hewitt (Vince Vaughn), a drifter, is hired by Potts, who has plans for him but he takes up instead with Kitty. He also makes friends with his boss's twenty-one year old mute son, Flyboy (Jeremy Davies) and with persistence begins to bring him out of his shell.

Reputedly, thirteen year old Flyboy found his father hanging from a tree and had been institutionalized until recently, where he went home and became the cook. Flyboy wouldn't talk and performed his duties with his gaze diverted and the widow Pott's seemed to like it that way. When Clay befriended her son, Pott's seemed to resent it and started to do mean things. This ultimately ended in tragedy.

Conclusion

Although the story didn't particularly grab me, there was some damn good acting here. No not from my sweetheart Ashley Judd, though she did alright. Both Vince Vaughn and Jeremy Davies played their characters to a tee and put on great performances. Even Paul Rudd did his character proud.

The story centered around Flyboy and Clay's efforts to get him to open up. Fly boy ostensibly discovered his has father hanging from a tree after committing suicide. The alleged reason he killed himself was that he once often found his serial adulteress wife in his bed with a lover.

Neither the plot, story, time period (late 50's) or setting were particularly compelling for me. Nevertheless, the movie was well directed, the cast was well chosen and they did a commendable job. Final rating 3.5 stars, rounded up.",1166400000,5,2003,4.755043227665706
943426,3,6304950136,"THE LOCUSTS is a downbeat film, but has some admirable qualities.  Vince Vaughn gives a stellar performance as a mysterious drifter who shows up in Sealy, Texas and takes a job as a ranch hand on a beef farm run by cold and seductive Kate Capshaw.  Capshaw's husband committed suicide after finding his wife making out with a ranchhand.  Their impressionable 13 year old son was then committed to a mental home after breaking down from the tragedy.  He is now 21 and is superbly emobided by the underrated Jeremy Davies.

Vaughn establishes a relationship with him and also steals the girlfriend of a fellow employee.  Ashley Judd shines as the girl who wants to settle down with Vince, but doesn't know he has a shady past.  The movie's biggest drawback is the lackluster performance of Capshaw; she is lethargic and a more energetic actress would have made her character more devastating.

Nonetheless, with Davies and Vaughn especially good, the movie is worth a look, but it is rather depressing.",1147651200,3,1000,4.841176470588235

She doesn't just castrate bulls. Vince Vaughn is not just another sexy ranch hand. He is a sensitive, caring human being who befriends her emotionally depressed and disturbed son. She learns that Vince Vaughn has a secret after he refuses her advances. Vaughn is vulnerable and strong.

Very Tennessee Williams-feeling. The cast was superb-with one exception. Kate Capshaw just plain sucks in this film. Her delivery is so flat you'd think she was reading from cue cards. Thankfully, this wonderful drama is saved by the rest of the cast. Vince Vaughn is dreamy, like a young Elvis, you can feel the heat coming off the screen from this guy, and it makes me wonder why he is routinely cast in goofy comedies these days. It's a shame, because he nailed this role. Jeremy Davies is excellent, in a role that could make or break this film, he makes it and then some.

It begins in a rural area. The cars and music are from the 1950's. Young men and women drink beer at a bar and talk. A song by Buddy Holly plays on the jukebox. There is a conflict between two men. One man is advised to move along. Hewitt is going to California and wants to find work. A feedlot needs help. The gossip tells about the people and their history. Later the boss lady talks to Hewitt at supper. Her son had been in an institution. At night a young woman drives there and takes him for a ride. Why did Clay leave St. Joe? Young bulls are processed so they will put on weight. At night Clay visits the son, who plays a record from his father. Flyboy learned to cook in the hospital, he went there at age 13. Clay discusses women and how to approach them. Clay meets that young woman again. During lunch there is conflict among the men; Carter gets told off. Clay talks to Flyboy about going to a drive-in.

Flyboy talks about locusts who stay underground until they come out to breed and live for a few months. Clay offers to teach Flyboy about working at the feedlot. The story continues. One woman wants to go with Clay, but he refuses and explains his involvement with a 16-year old girl. [Surprised?] Then there are scenes in the barn at night with rain and mud. [Symbolism?] Clay advises Flyboy to stand up for himself. Flyboy spends time with a girl, they talk. Who do they resemble? Then there is a crisis inside! Flyboy talks about the past; was this why he was sent to the hospital? The next day Mrs. Pott talks to Clay about his past in Kansas City. She tells him to drink. Then she explains her past. Clay reacts violently after being threatened. Flyboy interrupts them. Clay runs after him for an emotional scene. Clay runs into the house but Mrs. Pott won't talk to him. Clays girlfriend drives off with him. The setting sun symbolizes the end.

The musical selections date from the late 1950's to reflect the setting. Is this a realistic drama? I don't think so, but I didn't live in a society like that. A feedlots purpose is to fatten cattle before they are slaughtered for food. Fatty, marbled meat gets higher prices, but may not be the best food for most people. Note the complete absence of religious life in this rural town. Is that realistic for that era? That house looks too big and well kept given a lack of servants. If Clay was involved with a 16-year old girl how did he escape the authorities? Why was Clay so involved emotionally with Flyboy? What about the neighbors or those hired hands? The story doesnt seem realistic to me.",1521158400,,2593,4.409185803757829
