5787343,4,B00DBPBQ6I,Arrived on time and in great condition. Interesting twist to a idea that others have premised before. A lot of good action and well played roles but I I am far cry from an experienced reviewer. I found it to be entertaining to watch may not frequently but every so often. I find to add to my collection worth while. I think you will too. I recommend selection for ones collection.,1404604800,,380,4.366197183098592
5787344,5,B00DBPBQ6I,Being a person who watches this type of movie for more than entertainment...if you watch closely you will see things within this movie that are happening today.,1394323200,6,160,4.962962962962963
5787345,1,B00DBPBQ6I,"Could not watch past 20 minutes. Bad bad acting, not even trying too hard. That was probably what ruined it for me. This DVD contains 2 1.5 hr discs...beware :)",1388966400,,160,4.366666666666666
5787346,5,B00DBPBQ6I,Very good movie and I highly recommend this for any sci fi movie fan.  This is the movie I could easily watch more than once.,1387411200,9,125,4.0
5787347,5,B00DBPBQ6I,"should be a must for every citizen.  Entirely feasible and closer than you may think.  You see, we have no knowledge of the impacts of technology, and, no proof that it cannot evolve in this way.",1386460800,6,195,4.388888888888889
5787348,5,B00DBPBQ6I,"An interesting more where up-to-date version of the evil mega electronic entity threatening the world.  Can a team of outsiders out whit the monolith government and the entity to save mankind or should they just give up now.

This happened a few times before as in ""Colossus: The Forbin Project (1970)"" and we know who won that one.

And it looks like the entity has this thing about for a young male programmer - ether loves him or kills him. Shades of ""Demon Seed (1977).""

Remember this is a series so do not be surprised if they throw in the kitchen sink. Still all in all it is fun.",1385856000,10,587,4.3577981651376145

5787354,5,B00DBPBQ6I,"Delete is like the movie entitled Eagle Eye. Serious things are happening here that are relevant to understanding the tensions about initernational IT security and how it influences policy. It is actually very fast paced and action packed and I am so pleased that they made the episodes so long because is helps you be immersed in the story more. It is also similar to Depp`s movie ""Transcendence"". This could also be a prequel for the ""Terminator"" scenario. Fun and educational!",1428883200,,479,4.925925925925926
5787355,5,B00DBPBQ6I,This movie is about artificial intelligence running out of control. Whoever wrote this story knew about the internet and how interwoven it has become in our daily lives [ALL OVER THE WORLD]. In my opinion it is one of the best films of 2014. I highly suggest that readers of this review [WHO ARE COMPUTER LITERATE] consider adding this title to their library. IT'S A KEEPER! ! ! ! !,1425859200,5,382,4.4714285714285715

8591318,5,B00DBPBQ6I,"This is a valuable movie.  It shows us what could happen.  It's not science fiction.  It is a true cautionary tale for the times we live in.  I am telling all my friends and family about this movie.  Thanks, Amazon Prime.  You are the best investment I make each year.  No doudt.",1530576000,,279,4.25
8591319,4,B00DBPBQ6I,I enjoyed the movie. The characters were great. Some of the photography was interesting. But overall the movie was great! I was going from part 1 to part 2 to part 3 looking forward to what the AI was going to do and how they were going to stop it. I like how it ended. It makes you wonder if we are too dependent on technology and computers.,1529107200,,342,4.044117647058823
8591320,1,B00DBPBQ6I,"Within the first 20 minutes of the film, the dumb photographer pointed the camera lens at every available light source distorting the images which got washed out in GLARE! 20% of the images should have ended up on the editing floor. But in reality, it should have never been shot in the first place. As a photographer, I see this as a violation of acceptable cinematography. It took away all incentive to continue watching the overly drawn out story - that is, I assume had one.",1527206400,,478,4.569767441860465
8591321,4,B00DBPBQ6I,"Not as far-fetched as Speilburg's ""AI"" which ends with alien beings after humanity is extinct. This 3-part mini-series escalates with each installment. It is written by Joseph Malozzi and Paul Millie of Stargate SG-1 fame. Malozzi also wrote and produced SG-1, Stargate Atlantis, and Stargate Universe with whom he co-wrote with Mullie.

The AI 'being' in this movie is malevolent, bent on annihilation. I can say no more. The cast is comprised of familiar faces at every turn. I was quite surprised by this; quite, save that of a select few fresh lovely, sexy ones on center-stage throughout, though perhaps familiar to younger audiences; and ones you will love to hate! probably more than the evil AI 'herself.' The leaders, esp., certain ranking and military always muck up the plot! making for necessary tension-equilibrium.

It begins strong, and I did not find it especially predictable at all. The ending is good, and left me with a sense of completeness. I recommend it to all Sci-Fi fans and general audiences equally, given its universal subject matter.

""Delete,"" aptly titled, is pure entertainment at its best ---mind-dumbing in places, sobering in others, as well as thought-provoking. I would give it a 5 star except that it is not as original as it would have been 10 years ago.
Thank You.",1527033600,,1305,4.977064220183486
8591322,1,B00DBPBQ6I,Really bad attempt at this.,1525478400,,27,4.6
8591323,2,B00DBPBQ6I,"Unrealistic Computer Scenes. For that reason, not even  mildly entertaining, unless you can get past all of the technical ignorance by the writers. Acting is surprisingly good, and I liked all of the actors. Good job guys and gals. In fact, the only thing that saves this series is the acting.

1. Hacker boy gets arrested; FBI seize his laptop; they are ""going through it.""

Duh. Who leaves their laptop unencrypted at the boot level? Not hackers. They don't even use a drive, opting for portable Linux running off of RAM.

2. Hacker boy and media girl break into a computer outfit's brick and mortar shop. Jump right on to a computer because, you know, again, no passwords or anything, and hacker boy says, ""Some of these files are probably encrypted."" Media girls says, ""Go ahead, we have a long time.""

I hope you have about 9 billion years to brute force 128 bit AES.

3. The rouge AI turns their phones on remotely. Yeah, ok, so the AI could have downloaded malware to the phones, which made them seem like they were off. I can buy that. But in order to keep the AI from using their phones against them, they throw their phones out. Well, I don't care how good the AI is, it can't run without power. All they needed to do is take out the battery. Another ""duh"" moment. Sure they could have all had those cheapie phones with perma batteries. I guess.

4. US leaders want to unleash nuclear war heads to create an electromagnetic pulse that destroys all electronics, thereby destroying the rogue AI. The rouge AI knows there are shielded locations where it can hide. Humans never thought of that? Really? This was the cake that lowered this series from a weak 3 to a 2 star flick.

I'm just sick of these types of flimsy films written by those who obviously know nothing about technology. I mean, they don't even know enough about basic physics to know that without energy, you have a nothing burger. Take the battery out of the phone; you get a glass and plastic brick. Try it sometimes. You'll be amazed at how useful your devices are w/o a power source.

Ahh, geeze, they could kill this AI in one shot by simply turning off the power in all major cities, isolate the networks, delete any rouge program on the machines, and go city by city like that until they scrub it completely.",1524787200,,2288,4.493975903614458
8591324,3,B00DBPBQ6I,"You may delete this from your viewing/buying list. It is only slightly entertaining, with questionable effects. Low budget made-for-TV mini-series of 2 episodes. Overall bad acting with the exception of Matt Frewer who makes his character at least believable. Most others are comic book clichs. It is an interesting view on Artificial Intelligence though and the dangers therein.",1520467200,2,379,5.551724137931035
8591325,5,B00DBPBQ6I,Very good movie. Worth the money.,1471219200,2,33,4.666666666666667
8591326,4,B00DBPBQ6I,"It's a GREAT ""what if"" sci-fi flick. I grew tired of waiting for a re-pressing of this 2013 mini- miniseries, so,
I just bought it on DVD. This is part of The Doomsday franchise. I'm sure that they are best described as
T-W-O HOUR MOVIES stretched to T=H=R=E=E... but, they never fail to please... in more of a soap opera
than mega-blockbuster-sci fi-spectacular sort of way. My only regret is that I settled for a DVD of t-h-i-s entry
in the series. Seth Green was actually entertaining in this movie.
Recommended... in a beer 'n' pretzels kinda way!
The---three hour---two-parter is only available in DVD, unless you want the last BD for $30.",1465084800,,644,4.707964601769912
