6016600,5,B00FP87B40,"If I had to pick a favorite out of all three of the DVDs produced by Namaste Kid this one would be it.  I love the simplicity of all the DVDs without the visual distractions and the layout of the menu, but I found this one the easiest for my students to follow.  I work with children who have Autism and limited imitation skills.  I had to initially physically assist one of my students during this DVD, but by the end he was imitating the actions on his own.  It was so rewarding to see him doing it!  I also found the instructor in this DVD to be engaging and fun.  It's easy to tell that she really likes children and can connect with them.  If your child or students enjoy sports this is a great way to teach them yoga.  I'd highly recommend this DVD!",1390867200,7,755,4.123287671232877
6016601,5,B00FP87B40,"I have & love all of the Namaste Kid yoga DVD's. I LOVE the sports theme, creativity, kid-friendly menu, short segments, distraction-free background, kid-friendly pace, simple instructions, parent info section & that it includes affirmations (I am fun! I am playful!). Love that this DVD also has Cool Down & Yoga Rest segments. If you are a kids yoga teacher, this DVD will give you some new creative ideas for yoga poses (ex: scoop up your legs to add sand onto the sand castle in flower pose, cross-crawl hike from Brain Gym as a soccer ball bounce, a modified dancer pose as a slam dunk in basketball, etc.). Kids yoga teacher trainings very rarely come to Oklahoma so I am always excited to find other ways to get new ideas.

I have seen / reviewed most of the kids yoga DVD's out there. What makes the Namaste Kid DVD's unique is that it has no distractions in the background. Just a kid-friendly yoga instructor on her yoga mat on a plain white background. They have found that this format works well with young kids short attention spans and also works well with kids who have ADHD, Autism, etc...

While the DVD was designed for young kids (3 to 8 years old), it also would be appropriate for older kids that need a simplified format with no distractions.

Why does a ""distraction-free"" background matter? See details in my review of this DVD on the OMazing Kids blog.

6016602,5,B00FP87B40,"This is the third Namaste Kid DVD we picked up and it's a fun and unique approach to kids yoga. My little girl saw the DVD under the TV when we came home and asked if she could put it in right away. She like the other ones a lot and recognized the box. She went through the whole thing on her own and wanted to do it again. She was able to do all of the poses with no problem and had a blast.

The video is really easy to follow and the instructor does a great job walking the kids through each pose. The sports twist also made it even more fun and a bit more relatable. As with other videos, the set is completely white which I think helps to remove distractions.

I highly recommend this video to anyone looking to help kids be more active and focused at the same time.",1388620800,2,771,3.967741935483871
