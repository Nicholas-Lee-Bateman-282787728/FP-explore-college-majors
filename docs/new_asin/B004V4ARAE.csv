8442884,1,B004V4ARAE,"This movie was boring, depressing and not well written. Anytime someone reads scripture, I enjoy it. Fortunately scripture was read periodically throughout the movie, which was the only good part. If children watch this movie, be prepared to comfort them and have a discussion afterward. Even though this is a family movie, parts are very sad  . I do not recommend this movie and am sorry I purchased it. I didn't purchase it from Amazon, but from a bible bookstore.",1456358400,,466,4.825

8442888,2,B004V4ARAE,"A slow moving film, with a poorly written plot.
The acting is not great and the movie is boring.
It does have some important Christian ideas.
I don't recommend seeing this film.",1409529600,,177,4.5625
8442889,5,B004V4ARAE,"I stumbled upon this movie and while watching it I was able to reflect on my own life.  This movie is so real and down to earth as each life is untangled by Jesus and faith in what He can do if you only allow Him in your life

I cried when Joshua died because he was on the right path with God and couldn't understand why he was taken after sacrificing a kidney so his brother Christopher could live, but our thoughts are not God's thoughts nor His ways our ways!

Overall, great movie, moving and very spiritual...a must see for the whole family

God bless you!",1390348800,2,562,4.175925925925926
8442890,3,B004V4ARAE,"This movie was good at times but it just kept dragging on.  I wanted to stop it several times before it finished.  There were too many professionals in this picture who were Christians and it was unrealistic.  It seemed as if every person that came across the path of the main characters was a Christian.  It was just too fake and unbelievable.

I love Christian movies and I encourage them but this movie was poorly made.  There were several scenes that were too dark and they even blurred out the license plate on the main character's car.  I have never seen that in a movie.",1343088000,4,577,4.438095238095238
