1437227,5,B00005JKCE,"Blake Edwards transferred the moody, cool series to the big color screen with some tweaks here and there but kept up the quality.  Though some may miss Herschel Bernardi as Lt. Jacoby, Ed Asner is an excellent replacement.

Mystery, action, cool (there's that word again) Henry Mancini music and the dry, unruffled Craig Stevens in his signature role. Also, as Preston Sturges might say ""A little bit of sex in it"".",1375228800,,415,4.830985915492958

1437230,5,B00005JKCE,"I fell in love with the TV show, wouldn't miss an episode if at all possible, was thrilled when the Movie came out. Saw it several times and loved it every time. The Mancini Theme still rocks, even after more than 40 years. I Looked for a release on CED, Beta, VHS, DVD to no avail. I'm still impatiently awaiting a release. Like Matthau's ""The Laughing Policeman"", it's not a today's politically correct type of movie, I hope that's not the reason why it still has not been released. even though some of the old movies that I have waited for 30 years to be released have been, perhaps this one will finally join the ranks.",1364688000,2,623,4.379310344827586
1437231,4,B00005JKCE,"For three seasons (1958-61), Craig Stevens played private eye Peter Gunn on a half hour television program of the same name.  Some six years after the series left the air, Stevens returns to the role of Peter Gunn, in the full length feature film Gunn (1967) (aka Peter Gunn, Detective Special), which features the detective doing what he does best, moving through the shadowy underworld of Los Angeles, investigating a murder.  The film also features series creator Blake Edwards (The Pink Panther films) as director, and Henry Mancini who composed the iconic Peter Gunn Theme, also returns to provide the music for film.

While at sea on his yacht, a big shot gangster named Scarlotti and his mistress, are perforated by machine gun fire.  As Scarlotti once saved his life, Peter Gunn becomes involved in the murder investigation, joining forces with his friend police Lt. Jacoby (Edward Asner).  Scarlotti's successor, a man named Fusco (Albert Paulsen) is the prime suspect.

In the Peter Gunn television program, things moved quickly, as there was little time to spare.  The movie version features a more relaxed pace, as Gunn actually has the time follow up on numerous leads, question a number of suspects, and engage with several women.

Like the TV show, the nightclub called Mothers is Gunn's favorite hangout, and Edie (Laura Devon), a singer there, is currently Gunn's main squeeze.  Their relationship hits the skids, when a gorgeous young chick named Samantha (Sherry Jackson), unexpectedly appears in Gunn's bedroom.

With some violent deaths, and a number of twists and turns, this is a stylish and engaging little murder mystery.  Along with Samantha's unexpected presence, there are some other odd pieces to the puzzle, that come together nicely in a shocking finish, which comes completely out of left field.

A worthy extension of the legacy of Peter Gunn, Gunn is a solid crime drama, with some pretty good acting performances.  With a lot more time to work with, the character Peter Gunn is able to stretch out and become more fully developed.  He's a little stiff, and not the smoothest guy around, but Gunn is very competent, and is kind of the predecessor for the wave of suit wearing private eyes like Mannix, and later Jim Rockford, that would soon appear on television.

Blake Edwards directed this big-screen adaptation of the once-popular TV detective series Peter Gunn, which Edwards helped create. Peter Gunn (Craig Stevens) is a tough but polished private eye who fights crime with the help of friendly advice from an inside source at the police department, Lt. Jacoby (Edward Asner), no-nonsense nightclub owner Mother (Helen Traubel), and Gunn's best girl, Edie (Laura Devon). When a top crime boss is assassinated, Gunn is called in to investigate. Fusco (Albert Paulson) is a mobster poised to take over the city's criminal empire, and Daisy Jane (Marion Marshall) is a madame who thinks that Fusco pulled the trigger to further his own career. Jane wants Gunn to dig up the truth about Fusco, though Daisy Jane turns out to be the one with the biggest secret of all. Gunn retains Henry Mancini's memorable theme music from the original show, and brought back Craig Stevens, who played Peter Gunn on the original TV series, though Herschel Bernardi and Lola Albright were replaced as (respectively) Jacoby and Edie.",1295222400,18,1204,5.688888888888889

1437315,5,B00005JKCE,Don't let the stupid movie poster fool you!! A noir-classic! Craig Stevens stars as a bit of a hipper looking Joe Friday as the intrepid sleuth Peter Gunn private eye. Also checkout the excellent performance by the young Ed Asner as the cynical police lieutenant.  Throw in plenty of beautiful mysterious women and you got a hot film without being raunchy. The writing is superb in that wonderful hardboiled noir-style. The cinematography had tons of great shots. and angles. Most of all I dug the great jazz sound track by the brilliant Henri Mancini. I wonder who the session musicians were because the music was first rate. You even heard an early electric-sax!. The flute work is also extremely smooth and sexy.  Very 'mod.'  Great twist in the end that is very timely.  Highly recommend~!,1467504000,,793,4.851851851851852

1437389,4,B00005JKCE,"One of my favorite memories of detective shows was the Peter Gunn series. He was the first suave, sophisticated, handsome and debonair detective to grace television. Any before that did not have his flair and sex appeal. I miss this type of detective series. Stuff now is too gritty and gory. This particular movie version was good, and the young lady who took over the role of Edie was adequate, but I still wish they could have gotten Lola Albright to repeat her role. There was just something about the chemistry between Pete and Edie that Stevens and Albright made that could not be duplicated with another actress in the part. All-in-all, it was a good movie. I liked it a lot better than what they did to the movie of Mission Impossible. I always thought that for die-hard Mission Impossible fans, the Tom Cruise series is a disappointment. Making Mr. Phelps a villain and killing him off, I mean really! They should have just given it another name. So I do appreciate that with this movie, they left Gunn's character in tact, and stuck with the original intent of the series.",1457568000,,1082,4.640625

The character ""Samatha"" was a nice touch...should have seen it coming (especially when she mentioned she was rich and didn't have to work).

And the 1950s ""cool"" does not mesh with Hollywood's pre-Easy Rider cornball and inaccurate depiction of hippie culture. I've been looking for this for years and it seems to only be available on Amazon Prime (free), so if you have that it's worth a look as a curious misfire. Even the surprise twist at the end doesn't save it. Blake Edwards, who created this character, does not do him justice. The director of the Pink Panther movies and Victor/Victoria had the talent to turn this into something special. Instead, it has the look and feel of a bad TV movie of the era.",1398643200,2,958,4.575581395348837

The color and music are superb, with singer Laura Devon aptly filling the role of Edie, while a more formidable Ed Asner, picks up where Hershell Bernardi left off in the series.",1397692800,,294,4.9
1437639,4,B00005JKCE,"Peter Gunn was the first TV detective that was hip, cool and suave Jazz, sexy women, humorous dialogue and great characters. This movie is a flashback to the fifties. Button down shirts, big hair and bell bottoms trousers.

Except for the smooth Craig Stevens all the supporting cast is different than the TV series. However, they were actually better in their rolls, especially Ed Asner as LT. Jacoby.",1391472000,,402,4.911764705882353

1437641,4,B00005JKCE,"Written and directed by the great Blake Edwards,  Craig Stevens puts the C in cool as Private Detective, Peter Gunn.  This is west coast hip, mid 1960 style.  Theme song by Henry Mancini with a great bass riff and those hot horns takes on a life of its own. This series set the stage for director/writer Blake Edwards and Mancini collaboration in the great Pink Panther movies that followed later. I can't watch it enough.",1388102400,2,422,4.6
