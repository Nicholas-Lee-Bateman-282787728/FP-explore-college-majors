8275911,5,B001A3W946,"OK Friends... This is it!  The biggest box office hit of Spanish cinema finally released as it deserves:  fully restored, in widescreen  with excellent video and sound.  The quality is so good it plays like a new movie! Buena Vista Home Entertainment only missed one thing: English subtitles.  It's hard to understand that an American company would go abroad and release an European film classic such as this and not provide subtitles. There is also the ""region"" problem if you reside in the US or Canada but you can solve it by purchasing a multi-system region-free DVD player.  Believe me, it is worth the extra expense.  (Actually multi-system region-free DVD players are not that expensive and you can buy them locally for about the same price as a regular one.  With one of those gadgets a whole new world of movie viewing will be opened to you. Go for it!)

""El Ultimo Cuple"" (The Last Song) was filmed in 1957 and became an international sensation breaking box office records in Europe and Latin America.  It remains the highest grossing film in the history of Spanish cinematography although film critics and intellectuals have debated for years about the quality of this production and the reasons behind its fantastic success.  To them I say two words:  Sarita Montiel.  Only a great actor like her could have made the storyline believable to the masses.  Only a voice like hers could have sung those ""cuples"" and touch the hearts of so many people. Only her charismatic persona could captivate and charm men and women of all ages and different cultural backgrounds.  Only her indescribable beauty and powerful sex appeal  could make us accept that the character she plays is deep down a ""good girl"" in spite of her dubious morals. ""El Ultimo Cuple"" gives us, if nothing else, the experience of what a true film star should be.",1271030400,2,1837,4.802547770700637
8275912,4,B001A3W946,"Although our leading lady Sara Montiel sometimes billed as Sarita Montiel was already a well known actress at this time. This movie ""El ultimo Cuple"" or I believe in the States it was called ""The Last Torch Song"" is the one that began her carrier in a succession of movie musicals that spanned into the 70's. This movie was made in 1958, it was filmed in  Eastman Color and Ms Montiel plays Maria Lujan a singer trying to make a singing carear.
She meets an impresario who is willing to launch and invest in her but she is not in love with him and makes sure that he is aware that his investment in her is strictly a financial one an not that of sexual pleasure.
However, she does fall madly in love with a young man aspiring to be a matador and he dies in the ring. By this time her carrear has really taken off and she has made some friends and enemies along with way. For example, the boys life long girlfriend he left for her is not a fan.
After the death of her love, her carear goes spiraling down. She ends up losing everything she had and singing in dives. This is when the impresario meets her again and is willing to help her wth a comeback.
During her stage appearance she decides to sing a song that was a favorite of her past love a old song called ""Nena"". The emotion she puts into this song while her mind replays memories of him is too much of strain and she dies of heart failure.
No doubt old fashioned melo-drama but this movie is to Spain what ""The Sound of Music"" is to the US. It played in some cities for well over a year in the same movie houses.
For Americans Ms. Montiel made 3 American films. In a musical starring Mario Lanza ""Serenade"" she plays his wife while Joan Fontaine plays his past love interest.
In ""Vera Cruz"" she plays a Mexican girl that Gary Cooper falls in love with. Burt Lancaster is also in that film along with Denise Darcel
In ""Run of the Arrow"" she plays an American Indian and Aldo Ray and Rod Steiger star in that film with her. She was up for the part of Ximena el ""El Cid"" bur it went to Sophia Loren. Lucky for Ms Montiel she had a lovely voice at the time and could sing these songs in a very sexy style. A style that still today in Spain (Ms Montiel is 82 as of March of this year) still makes her beloved by the movie going public.",1255132800,4,2288,4.141573033707865
