2628776,4,B000H5V8CW,I thoroughly enjoy watching the movie over and over.  The kung fu scenes were awesome.  I also thought the chemistry between Brenda and Shin was strong - makes you believe that Wendy and Shen could be more than friends.  Hope we see more of Shin Koyamada.  I give this movie 4 stars.,1161388800,3,283,4.384615384615385
2628777,4,B000H5V8CW,"Now before anyone could simply dismiss my comments as invalid, let me say that I enjoy films of all genres.  I usually do not enjoy Disney Original movies.  However, as an action movie fan I thought this movie was very entertaining.

In response to a few comments earlier made, this film wasn't meant to be a dialogue intense film.  It's a Disney take on Asian action films, and its intense choreographed fight sequences, though at some times a bit silly, are a tribute to a style of film that is deeply enrooted in modern asian culture.

The idea of a high-school beauty who stereotypically is obsessed with popularity, looks, and of course shopping is rather endearing.  Also noteworthy is the slight commentary on how American culture sometimes easily enables us to forget our previously deeply held cultural heritage and the traditions that come with it.

I particularly enjoyed the scence in which the Wu family is enjoying dinner, and for dessert, the family enjoys Moon Cakes (a traditional Chinese celebratory delicacy).  The family all enjoys them, except for the father, who is troubled by the fact that he nearly forgot about the pastry.  It later leads him to comment that he ""wants to be an ASIAN-American family"".  I find this comment to be rathe bold for a Disney film.

All in all the film was enjoyable.  Particularly silly, but gripping and endearing.  I highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a bit of action mixed with silliness.",1157932800,15,1459,4.834677419354839

2628785,4,B000H5V8CW,"This is a watchable film even if you're not part of the target demographic for Saturday Morning Disney type sitcom humour, stereotypes and storylines (ie a tween or lower aged teen).  There are some amusing moments where you're supposed to laugh and also some aspects such as a fight between the monk and Wendy's brother (possessed at the time so not really him) where for a supposedly you'd imagine fight to the death both keep kicking over the heads of the other one or back flipping away. For supposed best of the best good and bad guy fighters in China's history, they fail to connect even once and the winner is pretty much the guy who was worn out the least from the long what turned into a dance routine.  The title character like many of these Disney teen shows/films where the character must grow, become more mature and realise what is really important in life is rather annoying at first, selfcentered and displays every other unlikable quality you would expect as she fails history and only cares about one thing, becoming homecoming queen.  It doesn't make a great deal of sense that she's failing history (Chinese history is what they're studying too) since her Grandmother who lives with her is from there and her mother works in the museum and is responsible or the China exhibit.

This is a film where various people including other students and teachers are possessed, you know this has happened each time by the fact they have glowing green eyes.  It's also one of those films why you wonder why the bad guy is so patiently waiting around to get on with it and kill who he needs to kill, rather than waiting around for the monk to save/train Wendy.  There's a lot of obviously done with a wire Matrix type propelled backwards fight scenes, and actual fighting where you never see Brenda Song or the other character's faces making it a bit obvious doubles are being used.  But overall it's an entertaining enough hour and half or so, for a movie ten years old at the time of this review, it's better than a lot of other stuff aimed a tweens and teens that Disney has brought out over the last decade.  Don't go into it expecting to take anything to seriously and you'll enjoy it!",1451779200,,2197,4.572519083969466

2628790,3,B000H5V8CW,"Pretty much predictable translation of a Chinese-version of the shallow female student who wants everything but may not deserve it.  Most of the Chinese kids I grew up with had their parents standing right behind them - beating them over the head with a textbook.  Not this little Disney princess, though.

Speaking of which, this, being a Disney studio production, is of the after school variety and there is a happy ending (and the guy that was supposed to die - and expected to die - didn't.

But he was corrupted by the Western values of the little princess so maybe he's now on that downward death spiral anyway.",1434931200,,617,4.63302752293578

2628802,3,B000H5V8CW,"Wendy Wu (Brenda Song) has set homecoming queen is her latest target in life.  Her lifelong rival seems to have the upperhand.  To make things even more difficult she has a destination with history; a history that she never knew.

Okay some of the dialogue might be right out of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" (1992) other lines admittedly from Jackie Chan.  But it is how they are applied that makes this movie unique.

Okay I admit that there is nothing really original in this movie.  It is a standard coming of age formula right out of Joseph Campbell.  However most people watch movies for the formula that they like.  Sometimes there are twists and turns that can be anticipated; sometimes there are twists and turns that may be surprising.  And we all know what the ending is going to be.  But the fun part is knowing these things and being able to kibitz.  No one ever stays in the car. The winner gets his/her just reward and we will not talk about what the loser gets.

I am proud of Disney because with all the mock violence and action you do not see any real blood and guts, we do not hear any forbidden words, and we learn lessons on how to deal with friends and adversaries.

I did not give this movie a top rating only because it is more of an exercise in storytelling and filmmaking.  It is fun while it lasts yet there is nothing extraordinary or exceptional.",1384128000,,1372,4.414342629482071

2628805,5,B000H5V8CW,"Wendy Wu Homecoming Warrior(2006) is a fun Disney Channel movie starring Brenda Song and Shin Koyamada. It was shot in English in New Zealand on a low budget. The story borrows ideas from Joss Whedon's Buffy the Vampire Slayer. There's a spoof of Shaolin Soccer(2001) in one scene. High school student Wendy Wu and a monk from China battle an evil demon that has the power to move from body to body. Wendy Wu is campy and over the top, but it is fun and lightweight. Brenda Song is superb as Wendy Wu. Song has tried to shed off her squeaky clean image with movies such as The Social Network(2010). She's acted in movies such as Like Mike(2003) and Leave It to Beaver(1997) and TV shows such as The Suite Life of Zack and Cody. Shin Koyamada(The Last Samurai) is quite good as a Chinese monk. At one time, Song was cast as a monk. Koichi Sakamoto(Drive, Power Rangers) staged the fights for the TV movie. Tsai Chin(You Only Live Twice, Casino Royale) plays Wendy Wu's grandmother.
I can see why Song has fans. She's talented, charming, and sensual. Wendy Wu is 91 minutes of cheesy fun.",1346112000,2,1086,4.517766497461929
2628806,3,B000H5V8CW,"I realize that as a reviewer of primarily masculine action movies, I may be putting all of my credibility on the line with this one. Why the heck am I reviewing a movie with a pink cover starring the bratty kid from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Suite-Life-of-Zack-and-Cody/dp/B000FC2FY2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Suite Life of Zack and Cody</a>? Well, believe it or not, there's a simple answer for that: Koichi Sakamoto. Casual viewers won't recognize the name, but Sakamoto is just about Japan's best action director, responsible not only for every&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Power-Rangers/dp/B0080730CK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Power Rangers</a>&nbsp;installment but also fantastic feature-length flicks like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Drive/dp/B0000ZG040/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Drive</a>. Imagine my surprise at finding him involved in this one. My curiosity got the better of me and I sought to find out not only what he could do with a Disney production (alongside director and fellow ""Power Rangers"" veteran John Laing), but also how Disney TV movies were doing these days. Believe it, I wasn't completely disappointed...

The story: when an ancient evil threatens the world, a young monk from the east (Shin Koyamada,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Samurai/dp/B0001JXOVC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Samurai</a>) is sent to find a destined young girl from California (Brenda Song) and activate within her the warrior spirit.

I know next to nothing about Brenda Song, but as far as child comedy stars go, she's pretty alright, with decent delivery and good facial expressions. It's necessary to focus on these factors, because as a martial artist, the movie doesn't capture her best side...but more on that in a bit. She's clearly the theatrical star of this otherwise family-oriented movie, which doesn't have a great deal of laughs for viewers beyond its target demographic. You get the expected gags of Wendy shirking her training to talk on her cell phone and taking her monk teacher on a shopping spree, etc. However, there's also a bit of drama regarding her family discovering pride in their Chinese-American ancestry for the first time. The only standout performer of the bunch is Tsai Chin (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Memoirs-of-a-Geisha/dp/B000EHRVMY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Memoirs of a Geisha</a>) as the quirky old grandmother. Regardless of how I think of him otherwise, co-star Shin Koyamada really isn't that great of an actor...

...however, when it comes to the movie's action content, he saves the picture. I really can't fault Brenda here too much, since a lot of her action included acrobatic wire-fu and subsequently a stunt double, but Shin is just about the only performer who really shines when it comes to the physical stuff. A legitimate martial arts champion who looks like a young Robin Shou, he's either been given a very convincing stunt double or he's doing about 95% of his own work. The fights themselves are a mixed bag: Sakamoto's clearly drawing more on the ""Power Rangers"" standard than his more mature work, but the result features a lot more wirework than he usually supplies. Style trumps substance at least half of the time, and the training scenes aren't inventive enough to help make up for this...but believe it or not, this is a lot more than I would have expected from a Disney production. Younger viewers who can appreciate kung fu will definitely be pleased, and with luck they'll follow Koichi to his better work in a few years.

""Wendy Wu"" is a pretty decent TV movie, but I'm not sure who the target audience is: when I was younger, not too many girls were kung fu fans, and I doubt too many boys will want to sit down to this...but I could be wrong. The film seems to have done fairly well for what it is, and though it's clearly not meant for me, I can tell that a lot of effort was made for it - it's not just some throwaway quota-keeper for Disney to show how race-sensitive they are with a bit of kicking thrown in. Kids who take an interest should definitely check it out, but everyone else ought to go back to what they were watching before - the age cutoff here isn't especially high.",1340841600,4,4415,5.5949177877429

2628808,4,B000H5V8CW,"The jacket cover on the DVD I purchased is a little different from the one Amazon displays on this page, but I checked by UPC bar code number and it is the same. I think I have an earlier version of the cover where it does not state Extended Ending in a banner at the bottom.  The extended ending is listed in the back along with the other extras, which are Homecoming Warrior in Training (which didn't play on my copy), Cast Connections With Brenda Song (basically a promo for the other actors' Disney appearances), and a Special Episode of The Suite Life of Zack and Cody (which was probably a commercial attempt to get fans of that show to buy this DVD).

As far as the extended ending, it's only 40 seconds long and, to me, not worth making a big deal about, except to squeeze out more sales.

The extras are something to be desired, but have no effect on the ratings I gave it.  Not a movie I'd generally pick up and watch, I was very pleasantly surprised.  It is silly, and that silliness extends to some of the action scenes, sort of a beginner's level Jackie Chan type silliness mixed with Jet Li style flying.

Of course, it is predictable. She is the top contender for Homecoming Queen. The spirit of an evil warrior possesses various people, and the last one it chooses is Wendy's school rival.  Wendy must make a decision of going to the Homecoming Dance, or saving the world. We know at the end, she will make the right decision.

The one nit I have is that the grandmother is an immigrant and it is assumed that the father is the son of immigrants. Not all Asians are recent immigrants. Chinese immigration into the United States started in the 1850's and was a significant ethnic group when talking about the history of Northern California and about building the Western half of the transcontinental railroad. I know I'm revealing a chip, but I kind of wish that as long as the writing had Wendy and her family rediscovering their Chinese heritage, that they also make a mention of the rich and deep history of the Chinese in the United States.

The chemistry among the cast was excellent, and that's a main reason why this film works, and the director didn't try to make it more than what it is: an enjoyable hour and a half.",1313884800,,2241,4.4330900243309
