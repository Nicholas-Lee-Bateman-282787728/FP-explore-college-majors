6432681,1,B00KITEHI4,"terrible! inappropriate! language! this looked like it would be a good family movie. Wrong! what a waste of money. depressing with a sad ending. bailee madison is the only reason i watched, but fast forwarded and or muted several scenes.",1416787200,2,237,4.95
6432682,5,B00KITEHI4,Great heartwarming movie for every age. We need more movies like this one! Butch and Bailee are very well cast...,1414454400,2,113,4.7

6432684,5,B00KITEHI4,"I really never cry in movies, but I found myself totally involved with these characters. Butch and Bailee are so believable and actors that I hope very much to see in the future..  The script was very well written, so much so that one could not predict the end of the movie. Is Butch in another movie in the near future?? Hope so!!!",1414454400,2,332,4.26984126984127
6432685,2,B00KITEHI4,"There was to much drinking, and sextual content.",1412121600,2,48,5.125
6432686,2,B00KITEHI4,I thought this would be heartwarming.  Sadly it is just overall depressing.  If you like a happy ending then avoid this one.  The storyline splits into so many pieces that they all come up short in exploration.  Not for me and definately not a family movie.  Keep walking............,1409702400,,283,4.8125

6432715,4,B00KITEHI4,"An indie film with a lot of heart anchored by an amazing performance by young Bailee Madison. Actor-Writer Conrad Goode's passion project has a super solid cast headed by Madison and Laura Bell Bundy in the leads along with Goode himself and veteran character actors Jonathan Banks and John C. McGinley who, as usual, deliver strong performances. If you like a character driven film that has no SFX and is mostly good for the whole family (one bedroom scene) and has a wicked twist at the end, check out Home Is Where The Heart Is aka Watercolor Postcards.",1418860800,5,556,4.683673469387755
6432716,3,B00KITEHI4,"Wow --- big issues!  In my opinion, definitely not a ""feel good""  movie although the writer and director try to lead you in that direction  at the tragic ending  by a short wrap up narrative --- did not work for me. Although, as a whole, the picture  is probably accurately  reflective  of reality in the real adult world of small town life during a severe modern economic downturn. Regardless,  I have a hard time calling it a family picture. Let's see --- you have a death at the beginning; you have a hero  trashing out professional football ---- definitely a  ""no-no""  in the state of Texas (the location of this picture) where football is tantamount to another religion; then the hero dies and a young girl tries to execute the hero's  horse -- the alleged culprit of the hero's death.  Wow !  Kind of depressing ! The most positive aspects  of the picture were (1)  Bailee Madison's  performance  --- far better than would ordinarily be expected  of someone at her age -- hope we see more of her; and (2) the horse lived.
The title of this picture and the wrapping pictures of  the DVD -- are misleading/deceptive,",1417910400,10,1120,4.5606060606060606

8659390,5,B00KITEHI4,"Across the board I was impressed with this film. The scenic backdrops, the acting, the music. It also had some fun familiar faces for the cast. It was interesting to watch the characters blossom throughout the story. You genuinely care for them and want to see what they do next. The music production weaves perfectly throughout. A few scenes are real tear jerkers because they get emotionally deep. I would like to see the main character Butch in more movies because he is very enigmatic and compelling. He also wrote the story, so you can feel the passion behind it as you watch. On the flip side of that, it has some great humorous stuff too. I think people of all ages can connect with this movie and I recommend it for a first date because it gets the love juices flowing... A MUST SEE FILM!!!",1492041600,,798,4.472602739726027
