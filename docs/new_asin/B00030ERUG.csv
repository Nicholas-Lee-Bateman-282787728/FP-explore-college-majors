8035723,5,B00030ERUG,"I'm a big Kylie fan, so this is a must! A budget DVD with only 6 videos from Kylie's ""Destruction era"", 4 vidoes I already had, but 2 videos that are not on Kylie's ""Greatest Hits 87-97"" DVD. ""Where Is The Feeling"" and one of my favorite Kylie tunes ""Some Kind Of Bliss"". ""Where Is The Feeling"" is a good song with a video of Kylie singing it up in the ocean. One of my favorites ""Some Kind Of Bliss"" is with Kylie playing a bad girl looking ravishingly HOT! Becoming a scarce DVD, this is a must for any Kylie fan! This is only in PAL format as it was never made available for the US market just like most of Kylie's materials. So make sure you have a multi format player.",1388534400,,673,4.067669172932331

'The Artist Collection' is made of the videos for Kylie's 6 single releases with deConstruction.

I already own her 'Greatest Hits' and 'Ultimate Kylie' DVD releases, but purchased this to fill in the gaps remaining.

As neither 'Where Is The Feeling' or 'Some Kind Of Bliss' feature on the 'Ultimate' collection I found this DVD pleasing, if somewhat short.

The only quibble (which I've removed a star for) is that the video for 'Cowboy Style' isn't included. Kylie's last, Australian only release for deConstruction would have elevated the value of the DVD.",1193788800,2,661,4.875
