4597901,2,B00582GLC6,"This Snow Days release shows how dreadful the Peanuts Specials became in the 1980's.

SHE'S A GOOD SKATE CHARLIE BROWN (1980) is hard to sit through. It stars Peppermint Patty, who spends most of the show just skating, and only features Marci & Snoopy. The rest of the gang includes cameo appearances of Charlie Brown, Linus, Lucy, and Schroder who do little more than cheer Patty from the fan seats.  They have NOTHING to do in this TV special!  And one of the cardinal rules of the Peanuts world has been violated here, the ADULT teacher TALKS! Gone is the muted horn that only the Peanuts kids can understand.  I have seen some of the other 1980's Peanuts specials and some of them are even worse.  This show will prove once and for all that there is no reason for Warner to release a Peanuts The 1980's collection.

THE CHARLIE BROWN & SNOOPY SHOW (1985) #18 ""Sally's Sweet Baboo"" is well worth watching, and proves that even in the dreadful 1980's quality Peanuts shows can be produced, capturing the flavor of the original specials of the 1960's & 1970's.  It is no wonder that Warner Home Video placed this first on the menu.

So basically you are going to be buying this DVD for one 22 minute TV show that you will watch, and one 22 minute TV special you will fast-forward through.",1319673600,12,1289,4.502145922746781
4597902,5,B00582GLC6,"She's a Good Skate, Charlie Brown is one of the sweetest Peanut's specials I have ever seen.  I own it on VHS and actually mailed it to my father to use his fancy machine to put in on DVD for me.  Finally I can purchase the real thing.

Charles Schultz's daughter Amy was a figure skater...and as I understand it, she and other actual skaters served as the models for skating shown in the animation.  I think this one was special to Mr. Schultz, and it shows.  The music is O Mio Babbino Caro, from a Puccini opera...and it is lovely.  I think this special has as much  heart as the most beloved and better known Peanuts specials.  The ""climax,""  which involves a technical difficulty when coach Snoopy goes to play Patty's music at her long-awaited skating contest, still brings a tear to my eye.  I carry this Peanuts Special and one favorite Sex and the City in my ipod, for those times when I need a little pick me up.  I highly recommend this to other sentimental fools.",1319328000,2,975,4.391061452513966

4597904,4,B00582GLC6,"Let's be honest, Happiness would be if they'd go back to releasing the peanuts specials in chronological sets instead of the same few specials shifted around on new themed releases all the time, still most fans will take what they can get, myself included. These ""Happiness Is..."" releases are at a more affordable price and at least include episodes of the Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show that haven't been seen on DVD before.

This release includes:

She's a Good Skate, Charlie Brown (the tv special)

Peppermint Patty prepares for a skating competition with Snoopy as her coach.

Originally Aired: 2/25/1980

Sally's Sweet Babboo (from The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show)

The Play: Charlie Brown writes a term paper about what happened at the previous year's disastrous Christmas play. Sweet Babboo: Everyone in the gang is hoping for valentines from their favorite sweeties on Valentine's Day, including Sally (who is looking for a valentine from Linus). Snoopy's Story: Peppermint Patty writes an essay about Snoopy and then is chosen to read it in front of the whole school.

Originally Aired: 10/12/85

So you aren't getting much, as I said I much preferred the chronological sets, but some parents will pick this up for the kids and some fans won't mind seeing the older special and an episode from the old series for only ten bucks. I wish they would put more on their releases though if they are only going to release individual volumes. I'd hoped these ""Happiness Is..."" releases were just to test the waters for a complete series release of The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show but that seems less likely to be the case as time goes on.

The bonus material, an episode of ""The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show,"" has its moments too despite a dreadful theme song.

4597951,4,B00582GLC6,"HAPPINESS IS PEANUTS: SNOW DAYS is a DVD that includes the final episode (#18) from THE CHARLIE BROWN AND SNOOPY SHOW and the tv special SHE'S A GOOD SKATE, CHARLIE BROWN.

Episode #18 of THE CHARLIE BROWN AND SNOOPY SHOW includes three segments:

""The Play"" - Charlie Brown writes about his most memorable Christmas. It was one in which Lucy was chosen to direct the school Christmas pageant and decided to hold it at the skating rink so she could be the star. Everything goes wrong.

""Sweet Babboo!"" - set during Valentine's Day, Sally makes a very special Valentine addressed to her Sweet Babboo and becomes despondent while passing out Valentine's Day cards at school when Linus doesn't come forward to pick it up.

""Snoopy's Story"" - Peppermint Patty writes an essay about Snoopy that ends up winning her an essay contest and she is chosen to read her essay before the entire school.

The episode is structured like most of the episodes from the series with a longer segment and two shorter segments.

SHE'S A GOOD SKATE, CHARLIE BROWN is an animated Peanuts short that first aired on tv in 1980. The short revolves around Peppermint Patty and her preparation with her coach, Snoopy, for an upcoming ice skating competition. Peppermint Patty is the star of the episode. Most of the other characters are only background characters in this story. The exceptions to this are Marcie who Peppermint Patty talks into designing a skating dress for her (even though she can't sew), Snoopy (who is Patty's coach), and Woodstock (who has one of his most sweet, memorable, and moving appearances on film). This special is loosely based off of Peanuts strips from the mid-1970s. SHE'S A GOOD SKATE, CHARLIE BROWN is a bit different than other Peanuts specials because of the focus on Peppermint Patty. However, the style and tone are the same as most of those specials. The only major difference is that this special is the first time that adults can actually be heard as talking; instead of the traditional ""mwa, mwa, mwa"" when an adult speaks you actually hear an adult's voice talking real words.

Overall, this is a nice little disc. It's a must have for serious Peanuts fans, but one that the casual fan might enjoy renting.

The only extras on the DVD are a series of trailers: a trailer for HAPPY FEET TWO: THE VIDEO GAME,  a trailer for HAPPINESS IS PEANUTS: FRIENDS FOREVER, a trailer for the PEANUTS HOLIDAY COLLECTION, and a trailer for SANTA'S MAGICAL STORIES.

One a side note, I have to admit that I'm kind of tired of Warner Brothers teasing Peanuts fans by releasing just an episode here and there of THE CHARLIE BROWN AND SNOOPY SHOW paired with a never before on DVD Peanuts special. I wish they would just release the entire THE CHARLIE BROWN AND SNOOPY SHOW series and THE PEANUTS, 1980s COLLECTION and be done with it.",1325376000,4,2832,4.726166328600406
4597952,5,B00582GLC6,"Ahh, opinions.  Everyone is welcome to their own, and it seems like everyone has their own regarding the main special on this DVD, She's a Good Skate Charlie Brown.

Personally, it's my favorite out of any Peanuts special ever made.  I love Snoopy the grumpy coach, I love seeing Peppermint Patty in a different light and finally dedicated to something, and I absolutely adore the ending.  It's got to be Woodstock's finest moment ever, and one of the most heartfelt moments in Peanuts history as well.  The first song I ever bought on iTunes was O Mio Babbino Caro thanks to this special.

Like another viewer I had this on VHS and iTunes, but I had to get it on DVD as well, didn't want to wait for the decade DVD that may never get released.  I'm hoping it does though, because I seem to be in the minority in really liking a lot of the 80s specials.

The Charlie Brown and Snoopy special is average.  There was something weird about the middle segment, 'Sweet Babboo'.  The animation seemed very basic/amateur.  Three decent stories, but there were no little shorts that I really liked about the Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show.",1325203200,,1130,4.5721393034825875
4597953,1,B00582GLC6,"I recently rented this video. I'd say where but it'd just get blocked out. Anyways,I received the disc today. Just finished watching it now actually.
The first special well was...essentially re-dubbed rip offs of ""Its Christmastime Again,Charlie Brown"" and ""Be My Valentine,Charlie Brown"".The second special was about Peppermint Patty's passion for skating...and rather boring. And don't even get my started on the barf-worthy new ""theme song"".
Also, being a ""Peanuts veteran"",the thing that irked me the most was that you could actually hear/understand the adults. No more of the good ol' mwa mwa mwa mwa's.
In short don't rent it,don't buy it. IT IS NOT WORTH IT!!!
