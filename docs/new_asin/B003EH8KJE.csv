8395488,5,B003EH8KJE,"As a bowler myself, I enjoy movies that have bowling in it. Though the movie is about bowling, it is a movie about life and the twists and turns that may occur. It is well done with good american oldies music. 5 stars!",1378857600,2,218,4.093023255813954

Was nice to see a lighter romantic comedy since it has been awhile since he's protrayed something this light and fun.",1356307200,2,284,4.4423076923076925
8395490,5,B003EH8KJE,"This dvd is 10 episodes long - it is a Japanese language tv ""dorama"" and I bought it for one reason - Takeshi Kaneshiro.  However, after watching it - and seeing the very sensitive and correct english subtitling, and the rather hysterical situations and characters - I must say I really enjoyed this movie.  It is basically about a hard-working stockbroker by day, serious bowler at night, with a tragic past about his supposedly ""dead"" love. For me, it is important that doramas end happily and this series does.  There are some really funny moments - usually against the challengers - who represent all sorts of couples and although I don't care for bowling, I found the bowling setting very appropriate and really got into the bowling game.

Makes you want to go out and go bowling or so!

Picture quality is excellent (the original 4:3 screen of the dvd  was easily stretched perfectly on my Panasonic blu-ray and Vizio tv without any distortion, and the color and resolution was wonderful on these dvd 9 discs.  The subtittling turns off and on, and the english subtitling is english perfect.

The audio is almost completely of American songs - ""You are my destiny"", Diana, and several others as the background.

It is also about unfaithfullness - Takeshi Kaneshiro plays Akutagawa (who still carries a torch for his ""lost"" love),  when he meets a married woman who finds out that her husband is cheating on her when her husband's lover starts making mysterious phone calls to her.  They meet at the ""Golden Bowl"" a bowling place.

It is about friendship, and trust and loyalty. There is a visitng cynical, singing yakuza developer who is trying to coerce the owner to sell the Golden Bowl property so the developer can build a ""love hotel"", but the owner suggests he will sell only if his bowler will lose to the developer's bowlers.

From then, the pairs of bowlers that they come up with are fun!  There is a really funny scene where secret champion female bowlers (dressed as geisha  demand that for each strike the losers drop a piece of clothing - I won't tell you what happens - but this is one of my favorite scenes - there is nothing indecent in here - all ""g"" rated!
Anyway - I enjoyed this dvd very much and worth the price I paid for it. If you are a Takeshi fan - this is not to be missed - and if you enjoy Japanese films -you might recognise some familiar faces - such as Tatewaki Muga.  He acted in some ""jidaigeki"" films - enjoyed the ones he was in.

It is great the seller chose to sell it through Amazon.",1319500800,4,2529,4.523076923076923
