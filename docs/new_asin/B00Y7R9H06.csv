8717655,3,B00Y7R9H06,"Got this and an album of original Man fro UNCLE to remind of how long NCIS ""ducky"" doctor has stretched a remarkable career. This film is quirky and obviously of an age, not for modern tastes. Still glad I did it , but won't be re-screening.",1495238400,,241,4.260869565217392

8717657,5,B00Y7R9H06,"When this frothy comedy came out in theaters in 1966, I skipped it as I had felt saturated by this type of material for some time. Also, why should I shell out money for a leading man that you could get for free on T.V. Yes, youth is wasted on the young. What did I know that movies would get so increasingly mean-spirited and grimier as time went by?

If you like em old fashioned, with an attractive cast dressed to kill and backgrounds of stunning European locales, this is definitely your cup of tea. It is a virtual tour of the best Italy could offer in those days before high risers obstructed such views.

The print provided on this made-to-order DVD-Rom is not blu-ray, but it is exceptionally sharp with well saturated color - and you can understand what the actors are saying. If you like The Pink Panther and The Biggest Bundle Of Them All, this ones for you.",1451347200,3,870,4.39751552795031
8717658,4,B00Y7R9H06,"Watch this film if not for the storyline...than for its beautiful shots of Italy in 1960's.  The scenery is breath taking from ancient cities to cool-breeze waterfronts, all the way to snow covered mountain peaks.  The settings reminded me of the ones from On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969).  The film does not contain much action, there is practically none.  This is your typical European comedy-romance from the late 60's...with plenty of dialogue, well dressed people, and type of humor reminiscent of The Pink Panther (1963) and Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961).",1449446400,2,568,5.208791208791209
8717659,4,B00Y7R9H06,"This is that rare bird that defies criticism and goes down as smoothly as a gondola ride through the streets of Venice.  David McCallum delivers an affable turn as the genial but nave tour guide and he also warbles a delightfully bouncy tune over the opening credits.  Sylva Koscina is a sprightly vixen who missed her calling as a Bond girl.  Tammy Grimes gives a saucy turn as a sexually insatiable schoolteacher.  Everything is tied together by the lush panoramic views of Italy and Switzerland.  The cast and crew didn't so much work on this film but got a paid vacation.  This film would be a good companion piece with ""If it's Tuesday it Must be Belgium"".",1437868800,4,661,4.6068376068376065
8717660,5,B00Y7R9H06,I thoroughly enjoyed the movie which I remember when it came out in the 60's. I never thought it would be on DVD but was happy to find this being offered. Played with no problems. Highly recommend this company to buy from.,1436832000,3,222,4.309523809523809
8717661,5,B00Y7R9H06,"Yes, I loved to ""recover"" this old B-movie, which bears still the freshness of that kind of movies, made with great efforts and few means by actors, directors, and crew. McCallum is at the top as always, and all the cast dances around him in perfect timing. Nice to hear Sylva Koshina and Domenico Modugno talk in English. Modugno was the singer who wrote VOLARE, a song which made the tour of the world in 1958, and as fare, he was a complete artist. Considering the rush, the computer graphic of today that doesn't leave the chance to actors to act, this must be considered a good souvenir of good cinema. In my opinion, of course.",1436486400,4,633,4.4655172413793105
8717662,4,B00Y7R9H06,"""Three Bites of the Apple"" is MGM's 1967 film release that provided David McCallum, then the curious heartthrob from ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."" with his first starring role.  It is a very well written comedy by George Wells that co-starred Tammy Grimes and Sylva Koscina.  Alvin Ganzer provided an extremely attractive production and directed the story well, even though the music by Eddy Manson is rather corny making the roots of its being greenlighted  for David McCallum, a television star, more apparent.  The story of a travel guide who accidentally wins a fortune in a casino decided, at the urging of an Italian adventuress he meets and who, with the help of her ex-husband, to try to swindle the guide who at the same time lends his heart to the lady.  A bit more intelligent that regular TV fare and quite scenic, although the interiors and some sets were filmed at Cinecitta.  The husband is played by Domenico Modugno very well and I believe he composed the pretty theme ""Carla"" that plays throughout the movie.  The title song ""In the Garden - Under the Tree"" is sung by McCallum himself.  Overall, a very nice production that proved McCallum to be leading man material.  The Warner Archive MOD presentation is in Panavision and Metrocolor.",1435104000,10,1252,4.84037558685446
