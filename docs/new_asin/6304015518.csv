7858685,5,6304015518,"I have been a professional flamenco dancer throughout the US and in Spain, where I have studied extensively, for 15 years. I have also been a professional flamenco singer for the last 5 of those years. I loved this movie for the beautiful representation of the diversity of styles (both of the Sevillanas themselves and of the performers) that Saura has brought to the screen with obvious love and respect for flamenco and Spanish culture.
The artists in the film range from legendary professionals (Camaron, Manuela Carrasco, Paco de Lucia, Manolo Sanlucar, Merche Esmeralda, and SO many others) to unknown but passionate Spaniards. This is a valuable depiction of the variety of Sevillanas in Spain, that you can see in theaters, classrooms, nightclubs, and fiestas. I also appreciate that Saura showed the joy and vibrancy that can be expressed in Sevillanas. So many people are only familiar with (and only expect to see) the somber side of flamenco, which does not fully represent such a great culture. Flamenco has a full spectrum of moods and emotion, and I aprreciate that Saura has shown that in this as well as his other films.
Through music, dance, and beautiful cinematography, it gives the watcher valuable insight to many aspects of a culture known for its passion and diversity. Yes, the whole film is of different individuals and groups all performing the traditionally-based Sevillanas. If this had been done by any other director or if it hadn't been so inclusive of so many styles, it would have seemed redundant. However, all the Sevillanas are varied and unique, and performed with such beauty and passion that I can't imagine anyone being bored. Also, the visual tone and mood created by Saura for each individual performance adds greatly to the performances and to the viewer's understanding of the diversity found (and encouraged) even in the most common dances. While this is not my favorite Saura film (I prefer his flamenco trilogy of Blood Wedding, Carmen, and El Amor Brujo) this film is a gem and a must-see for anyone with a love and appreciation for flamenco or for Spain! Gracias Saura!",1071964800,15,2119,4.955056179775281
7858686,5,6304015518,"The film will show you the multiple facets of the only popular andalusian music (some people wouldn't classified it as flamenco, but as flamenco like folk singing) that has spread outside the region to be widely enjoyed all over Spain. Dancers and musicians range from top professionals to ordinary people. Not really fiery or passionate, but restraint and stylish. A jewel.",1038009600,6,374,5.147540983606557
