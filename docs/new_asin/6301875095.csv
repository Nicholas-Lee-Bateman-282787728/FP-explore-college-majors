Met her at Cornerstone Festival in the 90's. She like Charlie Peacock is her music. Excellent !,1369440000,,262,4.458333333333333

I just love her voice. Her beautifully crafted song writing and joyful delivery!  I've seen Maggie B in concert many times and she always inspires me to press on in faith and in having a deeper relationship with God and others.  In this Video she is doing an acoustic set with her and another gentleman on vocals and acoustic guitars.  And it's a great sound.  You get real raw talent ear candy! It's a joy to behold!
I actually had a copy of this years ago and somehow it got eaten by my VCR machine. When this happened I was so upset thinking I could never fix it or replace it.  Well one day I just happened to check to see if anyone had a copy on Amazon and I was thrilled to see it available! I just had to replace it I loves it so much!",1291852800,,804,4.0
