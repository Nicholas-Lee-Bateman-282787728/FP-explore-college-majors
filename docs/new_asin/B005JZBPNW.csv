4713776,2,B005JZBPNW,"First let me say that the Shulgins get 5 stars for their lives and all the goodness Sasha has brought into the world.  He is a brilliant scientist with the best kind of creative inquiring mind - the kind of person so desperately needed in our messed up world.  I am thankful this film was made, as it gives a glimpse into their realm that one might not ever be able to have without the benefit of video.

But then I have to say that the documentary is pretty weak.  There is not much content, just a rambling walk through their homestead.  The scenes seem very random and unconnected.  Many times I was wondering if they had just left the camera on by mistake.  But surely the editor would have picked the best stuff ...

So I am left to conclude that the film was not edited.  Just a bunch of footage assembled with no real plan or narrative.  Footage from Burning Man, from the Chapel of Sacred Mirrors, some of a raid on their lab which never gets explained.  Lots of side stories and interviews with others in the field of psychopharmacology and neuroscience.  Some of that is interesting and some of it is a waste of time.  Watching the one guy play bad guitar in his garage while he tells you he has never taken psychedelics was the minus three point for me.

Still, there are some redeeming moments.  I'm trying to tell myself that the director was French, and so it has a European feel to it - an art film.  Not sure if I'll be able to convince myself of this or not.  If you are really into the whole altered states scene and the people who are behind the powders and pills, you should check this out.  If you are looking for a great documentary film which follows the typical biographical narrative with concise interviews and cool images set to music and such, this will leave you dissappointed.",1347926400,8,1806,4.372372372372372
4713777,2,B005JZBPNW,"I mainly watch documentaries and informative films and left `dirty pictures' thinking, ""what was that?"" I think the root of the problem is a director who didn't try to direct anyone to make this a film about the Shulgins (or any specific message), and so people started off by describing their own work, and finished with their self-reflections. The result is that everyone in the film is a star, and instead of a flowing story that builds on a central theme you get it all piled up like so many short stories chopped up and shuffled into one deck.

Some of the clips were taken from other documentaries that were freely available on the Internet even before this film was released, so some of the Shulgin content in this film is actually being resold at an inflated price. Even the name `dirty pictures' is a serious let down, if anything it's misleading, and at best it's a title that was used by MGM for a film they released on DVD in 2000.

My painful honesty is pretty much lost on the Shulgins huge and loving fan base; if you don't like the Shulgins then you probably don't like people in general, but this isn't just about them, it's also about many other people which forces it's scope to be shallow, and for that the film seems to run too long; and not far enough into the lives of the amazing Shulgins.

I think the worst thing a documentary can do is to move the general public to indifference so for that the film earns one star, but because I have a deep affection for the Shulgins I'm adding on one star to the film for them actually being in it; it's my personal bias.",1336089600,29,1584,4.380952380952381
4713778,1,B005JZBPNW,"I am very interested the subject matter of this film, but the film is terrible. I have read Shulgins' books and many others. I was really looking forward to this movie when I bought it.

This film is one of the worst films I have ever seen.

The editing is bizarre and disorienting. The movie does not flow.  The movie is basically a collection of video clips, randomly cut and mixed together with no sense of proper timing or coherence. The result is a jarring experience that is hard to watch. I felt it was giving me a headache.

Making matters worse, there was no narration or story flow. Some of the clips had no apparent connection to the subject matter.

We made it through about half the film before turning it off.

Its a shame that such fascinating subject matter was treated with such carelessness.

Seriously, this is the worst documentary ever made.",1328054400,30,862,4.558441558441558
4713779,4,B005JZBPNW,"I did some work on behalf of this film (a long time ago), so, bias acknowledged. That said, whatever else you discover in this film, from lovably eccentric geniuses to people with truly dedicated and quietly passionate relationships, you WILL fall in love with the Shulgins and their friends. It's impossible not to. They're simply delightful, loving and humorous, and the film shows that throughout.

If you've any interest in smart people who humbly but completely defy convention, and you're not completely opposed to conversations about psychedelics, you will probably be glad you saw this film. Another warning, seeing it may make you want to buy it.",1327536000,4,655,5.121495327102804
4713780,5,B005JZBPNW,"Really great film for anyone interested in the Shulgin's work. In addition to Dr. Shulgin there is also a good bit of information on & interviews with a number of other researchers in this field. I feel like it may be geared more towards those that only know a little bit about Sasha & his work, but enjoyable for those more knowledgeable as well. My only complaint is that there weren't any deleted scenes or extended interviews in the DVD special features. Enjoy!",1326672000,2,465,4.614457831325301

4713783,4,B005JZBPNW,"In most cases the title of a movie relates directly to the content of the film. Other times it may be a purposeful misdirection to heighten interest with perspective members of the audience. This just happens to be the case with a documentary recently released by Broken Glass Pictures, `Dirty Pictures'. Your natural inclination would be to think that this film is about pornography or perhaps risqu art but you would be far off from the subject matter of this insightful and eminently entertaining movie. This documentary considers the life and work of a name that is most likely unfamiliar to you, Alexander ""Sasha"" Shulgin. As an organic chemist he was responsible for the proliferation of a compound whose technical name is Methylenedioxymenthamphetamine. Once again the name may elude you but it is reasonably certain you know it by its acronym or at least its common street name, MDMA, Ecstasy, or simply `X'. There is a lot of just cause to vilify this substance as recreation use and abuse of the drug has accelerated the destruction of many lives leaving a considerable death toll in its wake.

Typically there are several approaches a documentary filmmaker can take ranging from humorous to straight arrow serious. The content can also be either colored to suite a particular editorially view point or stick to the facts as if the movie was presenting legal testimony. In the case of the documentarian Etienne Sauret his style is a refreshing combination of previously unconsidered facts presented in a home movie style. This has the effect of seamlessly blending some technical details that brought me back to graduate studies in Organic and bio-chemistry. This subject matter could have turned out a movie that was bone dry or bordering on popular propaganda but in Sauret's highly talented hands the result was not only exceptionally informative but retained its exceptional entertainment quotient. After a long string of documentaries that try too hard to prove a narrow point of view it is refreshing to watch one that is up front with its intentions. Those vehemently opposed to al uses of psychotropic substances this is not for you. It does place Shulgin's lifework in a different perspective, one that forwards the concept that certain valid uses for these substances do exist.

Long before MDMA was the recreational drug of choice on the rave scene there was serious research into its therapeutic and research potential. It was first synthesized by German chemist, Anton Kllisch, who was employed by Merck initially while researching its potential as an anti-coagulant. Due in large part to some of the psychogenic side effects this use never really panned out and the formula lay virtually unnoticed in a draw for quite a long time. Due to the intensity of these side effects there was some clinic exploration for use as a treatment for post traumatic stress disorder until the fear of misapplication lead to the criminalization of the substance by classifying it as a schedule I drug in the mid eighties. The profound effects of the drug included euphoria heighten feelings of intimacy, self confidence and peacefulness. These are precisely the psychological alterations that made the substance so desirable in social recreational settings such as rave. There was continued curiosity concerning the therapeutic application as a possibly valid treatment of numerous debilitating conditions. It also captured the keen interest of Sasha Shulgin. As the documentary delves into the primary interest that Sasha felt was over the molecular mechanism of the drug. His basic premise was garnered from a very valid observation, like many psychotropic substances MDMA works by attaching itself to specific bio-chemical receptors in the brain. Sasha was one of the first scientists to investigate a mystery of Neurochemistry; why should a human brain contain receptor sites for chemicals of this very specific configuration. This dovetailed perfectly into why the drug could be used in the treatment of depression, anxiety and PTSD. He felt that this reason these substances were able to alter our mental state is they were analogous to naturally occurring neurotransmitters that are responsible for everything from our emotions to our perception of the world.

Shulgin embarked on decades of diligent work investigating these substances that resulted in him literally writing a couple seminal textbooks on the subject. He also greatly forwarded the precepts that have guided research into the way our brains function on the molecular level; a level never before imagined by serious researchers. This Harvard educated scientist frequently relied on organoleptic testing methods that attempted to quantify the extremely subjective effects of these drugs. He often utilized himself, his friends and wife of forty years as test subjects. In several scenes in this film they recant the experiments noting the results were a `Plus One' or ""Plus Three', utilizing the scale Shulgin devised now referred as the Shulgin Rating Scale. To look at Sasha and his associates again you might be mislead. One the surface they come off as a group of aging hippies with long grey hair that has not been tamed in decades. As this film shows you are actually witnessing a group of dedicated researchers that advanced the study of neurobiology by decades. It is notable that they have a whimsical look on their faces as they recall these investigations.

I am rapidly becoming a fan of tienne Sauret. I have seen a couple of his documentaries including his fascinating examination of American foreign policy called `Why We Fight'. His style here is straight forward and as mentioned frequently unpolished. This is not a comment intended to deride this film it is indeed praise. Sauret is intent on introducing his audience to the man not so much the technical details of the work. He also brilliantly balances the construction of the film between the dedication that was exhibited by Sasha and his devoted wife Ann and the much broader implications of the investigation of this line of research. As Shulgin is quick to note and Sauret displays in his expert fashion some of the most important scientific discoveries are made by human intuition and dedication that is performed by individuals rather than high tech laboratories. Sauret expertly takes a controversial and highly technical subject and humanizes it into an enjoyable visit with the pioneers of this field. The most exciting research ahead will lead to a greater are vital to understanding our humanity and Shulgin lead the way.",1320624000,28,6582,5.148598130841122

If you don't know about any of these things already you might find this film tedious, as it does little to present the wide background needed to really appreciate it. The filmmaker was clearly deeply interested in the Shulgins as people, not simply as players in a drama. The ""dirty pictures"" referenced by the title is what Alexander Shulgin called the drawings of the forbidden molecules in his notes and vial labels, as we learn in the final moments of the film. This is not a ""spoiler"" unless you were anticipating lewd activity in the documentary. Alexander Shulgin, who died in 2014, was a remarkable person who accomplished an astounding amount of scientific research on psychedelic drugs outside of the traditional university or corporate settings.

Whether you think that his impact was overall positive or negative is up for debate, but the man himself is a very friendly grandfather figure.

This documentary, however, could use a lot of work. Having known about the majority of Shulgin's life and work, I didn't have much trouble following things when watching it alone; but when watching it later with several people, I found myself having to explain Shulgin's life and work to people because the documentary was being too eratic to explain anything.",1403654400,,648,4.944954128440367
4713832,1,B005JZBPNW,"How could anyone make a bad documentary about a character as fascinating as Alexander Shulgin?  Well, (is it Ms. or Mr.?) Etienne Sauret has managed to make a documentary that's not only bad, but it's downright painful to watch, and, would, given only a tiny amount of smart-alecky extrapolation, provide good evidence that psychedelic drug consumption might be best avoided by aspiring artists, in stark contrast to the commonly held myth that they aid artistic ability.  I mean, usually psychedelic artistic output is usually just a little hokey at worst, like old Yes and Hawkwind album covers from the 1970's or maybe some black-light painting with an R. Crumb theme, not this incredibly confused effort that feels like it was scripted by someone who'd been watching _Memento_ repeatedly during a 72 hour meth binge.

Before you judge me, please let it be known that you'd be harder pressed to find a bigger fan of the Shulgins than I.  I've worn out my copy of PIHKAL -- twice.  I checked the website for this movie regularly and prayed that it'd finally make it to DVD.  Trust me, I was looking for any possible excuse to like it, or even like a little bit or piece of it.

The directing ""style"" is a art-school sophomore effort (although I could not tell if it was intentional or not) that is somewhere between the disjointed narrative of Harmony Korine's ""Julien Donkey-Boy"" and the final ""acid montage"" scene of _Easy Rider_.  Even if you have already have a fairly good idea of the story and characters before you watch it, you'll find yourself scratching your head wondering how the entire effort could be so disjointed -- there is almost zero continuity between facts, characters, places, and situations to the point where the movie is almost like a series of unrelated vignettes that could be shown completely out of sequence with no net overall loss of comprehension on the viewer's part -- because it's simply impossible for the viewer to have an idea what's going on (David Nichols is shown as some wacky harmonica player and little else, and I never did get who that hipster-biochemist with the pierced ears was, although he was apparently important for some reason as he seemed to get more air time than the Shulgins.

Actually, this movie reminds me of a specific drug experience from many years past. Back in my ""party days"" I did a bunch of Ketamine with several others, someone cued up _Planet of the Apes_ on the VHS player, and then I realized as the movie was ending that I had absolutely no idea what just transpired in the last two hours, since my memory had gone from Charlton Heston shooting up in his spacecraft to damning all the apes to hell with no narrative in between.  The saving grace was that that two of my compatriot fraternity-house ""psychonauts"" had used another fellow's ketamine anesthesia as a good excuse to write a ""Twisted Sister"" logo on his forehead, which made for some good yuks after being effectively knocked unconscious by a strong dissociative anesthetic.  Perhaps the director was trying to evoke a similar experience, as I found myself constantly waiting for the ""punchline"" in this movie, or the point it would ""really get rollling"", which never came.  On the other hand,  I still chuckle when I think about someone waking up in the morning with a Sharpied ""TS' logo on his forehead, proving that perhaps it's much more rewarding to actually use drugs than to watch movies about people that make them.  What does any of that have to do with this documentary about the Shulgins, you say?  I can only respond that you're mired in the Old Linear Paradigm of 'Coherency Thinking': I'd try to explain it to you, but it's some of that deep quantum physics string stuff that you wouldn't understand.

My biggest pet peeve is the the constant use of Burning Man imagery throughout the movie. This is not to say that Burning Man itself is necessarily bad, as it is definitely the nexus of contemporary psychedelic culture and there are some cool people that go, sure: some would call it a profound spiritual event, or even a ""movement""; others might just confuse it for a mass gathering of Bay Area IT workers in animal costumes on Ecstasy who take _Mad Max Beyond Thunderdrome_ a little too seriously: in either case, it's not interesting, relevant, or appropriate to insert non-sequitur shots from this festival constantly amidst the rest of the film imagery.  Just when SHulgin starts making a reasonably interesting historical anecdote about how he, say, discovered 2-CB, it's back to Burning Man.  Perhaps the whole movie was just designed to reinforce the notion that for all the potential of Shulgin's discoveries, they're really mainly just used to help hippies have sex and make seven days of nonstop techno tolerable?

The only mildly redeeming part of the movie is when Shulgin is actually given a bit of space to talk about some of the compounds he's discovered, but he's hardly given any space to talk at all and (do you notice a pattern here yet?) the disjointed (a word that any review for this film would max out available synonyms for) editing immediately pulls another character, event, or situation in for some anecdotal, who-what-the-heck-was-that clip which is only half-explains (at best) before shifting gears again.  Actually, maybe this is really a movie about Burning Man, and the French-sounding director is taking a clue from the likes of Deleuze and Guattari's _A Thousand Plateaus_ or similar French postmodern philosophy?

Trust me, I would love to at least say this movie is for ""completists"" or ""diehards"" only but I really cannot see anyone with even the slightest sympathy towards coherency being anything but annoyed with this film.",1385856000,8,5718,4.856115107913669

4713838,5,B005JZBPNW,"I'm shocked to learn that this lovely film has recieved a couple of prominent bad ratings on amazon. I'm not a ""Shulgin Fanboy"". In fact, the existence of this marvelous couple just recently entered my consciousness. This film has been the first time i really saw them walk & talk for a longer period, so consider myself rather unbiased.

As a documentary filmmaker myself, i deeply appreciate the style of this movie. First of all, one has to appreciate the fact, that this is not a propaganda film"" of some sorts. ""Dirty pictures"" does not scream & shout. It's progressing silently without failing to entertain, or to inform us about the life of the shulgins and their friends and colleagues. I simply love how the filmmaker decided to include other notable figures,and family to let them speak. Why? Because the concept of the film is such that it's not only about the shulgins themselves  but also about the core of the psychedelic experience and how one can scientifically deal with the topic. The whole 90 minutes are are truly a glowing example of love and compassion and how these compounds are able to inspire lifelong bonds of partnership in various forms.

The film has almost an ethnographic character, leaving a lot for the viewer to figure out. But in a way, it's ethnographicness is not a deliberate choice of style. The words Sasha an Ann speak, directly tie into the concept of the whole film - in a very crafty way.

All i can say is that i thoroughly enjoyed ""Dirty Pictures"".

Stay away if you can only accept a aggressive, highly political style of documentary filmmaking.",1356393600,2,1593,4.736462093862816

I found the film to be most refreshing.  There was no agenda to speak of. After watching I felt like I knew them just a little bit.
There are some moments that I found to be unexpected and pleasing.  The footage at Burning Man is fun.  The shots of the police coming to his lab are telling.
The title is referring to Dr Shulgin's moniker for the molecular structure diagrams that he draws.
If you are aware of who this man is and the contributions he and his wife, Anne, have made to psychopharmacology and spirituality, then this film is a must have.

8476286,5,B005JZBPNW,"WOW! What an amazing movie! I did NOT know there is currently a whole realm of pharmaceutal scientists legally, conventionally exploring new pharmaceuticals similar to MDMA. I mean, it makes sense, but I learned a lot about the reality of that from this movie. Sasha Shulgin SUCH an inspirational figure we learn much about in this film! A humble explorer dedicated to his learning and exploration journey, which as he explains, never really ends. Altering his consciousness on the drugs he discovers is always a study for him, a taste test and exploration of new possibiltiies of himself and life. We learn about him and the people around him - friends and his wife. We hear peoples' various experiences and perspectives about hallucinogenic drugs and the ways they can truly be of benefit for healin and becoming stronger, clearer, more intelligent, more effective at a human race. I myself have never been very into any substance, but did have 2 or 3 majorly powerful hallucinogenic trips in my early 20s that left me with some profound shifts and/or insights, so I do have some understanding of what these people mean. While it is not for everyone. this film reinforced for me the idea that MANY people in Western society could greatly benefit from taking drugs like MDMA or LSD with a psychological, safe guide/counselor keeping the focus.

8476288,5,B005JZBPNW,"Great documentary, with good points of view, fun facts and a real eye opener for the way people view drugs, prescribed and recreational as well as psychotherapy, spiritual journeys & the overall balance of the brain. I enjoyed the feeling I had while watching this documentary and the very calm nature of the film. There are many things in the world that people with share different views on and I think this film helps let people view these experiments or chemical compound conclusions for how drugs alter the brain and how people are effected differently.
  Mr. Shulgin I believe was very much in love with his work and has a great passion for what he has been studying over the years. He did not want recognition for the cons of the drugs he was studying or idolized for how the mainstream media viewed some of the drugs he was working with, he just wanted to identify the characteristics of each molecule and where each molecule lead to, as he mentioned, ""One door leads to a hallway, at the end of that hallway there was another door that lead to another hallway and so on & so forth.""I could see how everyone around him or knew him was drawn to him with great happiness.
  I understand as the young man said, (the doctor with earrings playing the guitar in his garage), that there are two people in this world, people that have experiment with the drugs and people that have just studied drugs, he did not oppose to anyone that had experiment with any of the drugs he had been studying, he was open to their ideas and views because he had only studied them nor tried any of the drugs personally. To me that speaks volumes.
  This film is definitely worth watching til the end. I believe a few reviews about this film were premature because they did not watch this film all the way through. With that being said, as far as drugs go, they will always be around and there will always be pros and cons as well as less educated people trying to make a buck without researching what there are doing before hand. But once we have learned all the characteristics of the drugs we have in this country, we will be able to break down these chemicals and use the best parts of these drugs to help better people that deal with personal mental set backs as mentioned, anxiety, anger, depression..etc.
  Also, the government will saying anything to keep control of the people of this nation. Scare tactics from our government have shown over time and time again.
  So I say to Mr. Alexander Shulgin, great job on all your work, studies, experiments, research and with all the results you have recorded for our history in pharmaceutical drugs.",1492819200,4,2633,4.547568710359408
8476289,2,B005JZBPNW,"To be honesty, I didn't watch it all the way through.  I just got tired of the subject matter and the man himself.
Two things bothered me, the first was Dr. Shulgin's either refusal or inability to realize the absolute harm he is causing.  As the DEA agent pointed out, and working in healthcare, I've seen it first hand...People who are NOT chemists are trying to make these compounds, and they're causing enormous damage.  They're destroying themselves, their families, endangering the people who live around them (and not with the effects of the drugs, that's a different argument all-together) with the *insane* level of danger most of them are creating with toxic fumes, products, and explosions.  This is dangerous even to people who live around them, who drive around them (mobile meth labs come to mind...), and to those who may purchase and live in the house after they have gone if the building isn't condemned.
And his wife...his wife bugs the CRAP out of me with her ""lay therapist"" jargon and her insistence that people are just using these drugs on a spiritual journey, that they're exploring their world, etc. etc.  As a hospital worker, I'm calling a grand old BS on this one.  Maybe some people are, but the vast majority of people on drugs are on them because they're self-treating an underlying issue, that is NOT being helped by getting high and running away from it.  They're destroying themselves, their families, children, spouses, parents, siblings...People care about those who become junkies, and it destroys them right along with the person they care about as they go down that path.  If these people had been given a better outlet to overcome their initial symptoms, problems, mental illnesses, or disillusion, then they would be healthier, happier, and positive members of society/the world.
Very few people get high in modern times order to attain a spiritual journey.

That being said, the documentary seemed well crafted and did a good job of presenting both sides of this divisive and fascinating issue, but the subjects themselves, I personally, found to be off-putting.",1489968000,2,2104,4.988571428571428
