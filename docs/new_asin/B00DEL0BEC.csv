8592560,1,B00DEL0BEC,"*update*: only buy if you live in Europe. Will not work in the United States.

We received our first copy and tried it in out Sony bluray player, didn't work. Then tried it in our PS3, didn't work. Tried it in both of our laptops, didn't work. Tried to play it with our parents' bluray player, didn't work!

We sent it back to exchange and just received our second copy. Tried it in all the above and it still doesn't work. Not sure why?? It looks like a legit disc and case. Just doesn't play.

Will be returning it for good. Bummer",1388102400,,533,4.205882352941177
