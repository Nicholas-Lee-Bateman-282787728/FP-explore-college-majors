2006354,4,B0001JZXUW,"The movie starts out showing us a boring, mostly mute ghost. One that stands around and stares. In a northern isolated cabin, Mira Sorvino returns to her family cabin where she used to spend her summers as a child. The ghost seems to tolerate her presence, but weird things happen such as doors closing by themselves and the Victrola playing by itself. The film moves slow...as does the ghost. The cabin has no electricity, and after a few days, she still has cell phone reception. Where is the tower? What kind of battery does she have? Hey! I want one of those!

Anyway, her slightly jerky boyfriend (Justin Kirk) shows up and wouldn't you know it, the male ghost has testosterone issues or so it seems. Creepy huh. Things start to happen to him. The film moves slow and just about when you think nothing will happen, Bam! it does. First slowly, then more dramatic things happen as the film progresses. The boyfriend turns out to be less jerky than he was at first and is the picture of understanding while the serene Mira is somewhat psychotic...or is it the ghost? or a demon from her past?

We soon discover this is more than a simple ghost haunting...

The film is done in a way you can feel the tension between the characters, the influence of the ghost, and the frustration of the boyfriend. The movie has an existential Christian theme to it, but shies away from stating any specific names that pin it to Christianity.

No sex or nudity.",1340582400,3,1446,4.55
2006355,5,B0001JZXUW,"I liked this movie. It's rather a quiet movie, but it has a good story. It's a good message, in the end of sin and redemption. It really illustrates how we let ourselves be haunted and tortured by our own pasts. It's not really a horror movie, but a story that looks at a dark subject and its long-term effects. I like how the story unfolded, so that it left you wondering who was who and had some surprising twists and turns.
It could have easily fallen into boring cliches, but managed to avoid that, while revealing more and more about the different characters in the movie. I realize the message of the movie is not for everyone, but I found it refreshing to see a movie that reflects some of my own values, and it does so in a quiet way, not banging you over the head with them. This movie is a rarity; a movie with a Christian view that isn't sugary and dumb. All in all, I highly recommended this movie.",1339891200,12,910,4.235632183908046
2006356,2,B0001JZXUW,"I am a movie buff and I'm always up for a good scare. This movie was ok but lacked a ""good"" scare moment if you know what I mean. If your just looking for an ok movie with a hint of scare than you'll like this movie. The acting was great don't get me wrong, but the script was missing something...",1324080000,2,297,3.8852459016393444
2006357,5,B0001JZXUW,I got this move because it is something I grew up watching as a young kid although it's a cheesy low budget film I still love it and always will.,1299456000,,145,3.8666666666666667
2006358,3,B0001JZXUW,"I got this because I remember watching this on network televison along time ago, and remembered liking it. It was called Danger Island then. Back then, I didn't care about acting, script, plot, or any of those other concepts that contribute to a good cinematic viewing experience as I do now. I bought the DVD for nolstagic purposes, and I was pleased to finally watch this film in its entirety and with cinema appreciation I now carry. The movie is cheesy, with low acting; however, the premise/plot is actually quiet thrilling and interesting. I didn't know it was slated to be a TV series until I read about it online.
I doubt most will like it, but like I said, I enjoy the nostalgia and escapism aspact of it.
And Kathy Ireland is hot as always! lol.",1185408000,,755,4.518248175182482
2006359,2,B0001JZXUW,"In the barrel of B-rated movies, The Presence floats near the bottom.

From the beginning till the very end of the movie the question ""what the heck is happening?"" floats in the subconscious. At the very start of the movie, a bikini photo shoot is mysteriously interrupted by mortar shells and armed militia. While this makes for a good excuse to see Kathy Ireland in a swimsuit, it left me wondering where the movie was supposedly set, why the military was attacking, why the military would attack a photo shoot and what purpose this played in the movie as a whole. As it turned out, the first twenty minutes of the film were solely used to gather a clich group of American expats onto a plane that would predictably crash on an island. From there the plot continued to surprise me with the unexplained appearances of monsters, shape changing villagers and what looked like a miniature Godzilla character. A few of the issues were cleared up by the remarkably convenient discoveries of a 'doctor' character but most were left to apparently place the viewer on edge.

Strangely the movie all in all was entertaining, not for the gripping acting or well laid out plot but simply because the movie was so ridiculous. In fact, after the first fifteen minutes of the flick I began to thoroughly enjoy the film. After I started making fun of the horrible plot twists and laughable costume design, the movie became quite enjoyable.

If you're looking for a good low budget movie to nestle down with, The Presence pry isn't your best choice. However, if you have friends that enjoy making jabs at horrendous acting and mind boggling story lines, this is the movie for you.",1112572800,,1665,4.714776632302406

2006424,4,B0001JZXUW,"I really enjoy ghost stories without violence, and this was made to order for me.  The age old story of good against evil comes into play in this film and I found it thought provoking.  I would like to see this genre again, especially the 'creepiness' of just seeing a pale entity standing in a corner, or looking through the windows.  Thank goodness there was no sudden violence inserted just to make you jump.

 I still am not sure who the shrouded figure was in the boat, however.  I'll have to watch it more than once!",1403481600,,522,4.385416666666667
2006425,5,B0001JZXUW,This movie is a good ghost story with a twist. Excellent acting and story concept. The surprise is in the REAL presence,1397606400,,119,4.454545454545454
2006426,4,B0001JZXUW,"This is a very Stephen King-ish film, but without any gore; just rather scary and gripping.  Don't recommend watching this before going to bed, as it gave me some gruesome nightmares!

This film has good acting, great writing, good music and is rather original.",1392249600,,261,4.909090909090909
2006427,5,B0001JZXUW,"Not exactly what I expected. But it was a very pleasant surprise. let me start by saying no matter what the content of this movie, I would have loved it alone for the scenery. But then I love everything about the state of Oregon. That being said, I loved the switch from the ""normal typical"" ghost story and the religious theme was well played. It was played well enough that my best friend missed it all together until pointed out. A refreshing break from the recycled haunted house tales and slasher blood and gore flix we seemed to be flooded with nowadays.",1379462400,5,560,4.5

I enjoyed the credits more than the movie.",1377475200,,174,4.0
2006429,4,B0001JZXUW,The movie began slow and left you wondering what was going to happen.  It ended in an unexpected way compared to other horror movies.  It really has a moral to it that probably matches what the world is actually like.  I really enjoyed the end of the movie.,1376956800,,257,4.3125

2006451,4,B0001JZXUW,"Not the typical ""ghost"" story.  I thought it was well shot, well directed, and the actors were very believable.  I can say that because it was easy to lose myself in the story.",1369180800,2,176,4.303030303030303
2006452,4,B0001JZXUW,"I really enjoyed the content of this movie...  I was trying to quess what was going on, who the presence in the cabin was, with out giving it away... I will say NICELY done. Unexpected ending!",1363219200,3,192,4.333333333333333
2006453,2,B0001JZXUW,"Recently, I came across this movie, and thought I should try it out, but I wish I had not. Without any spoilers, there is a message in this story, and how the message was conveyed was... was... well, blah. There was, of course, the romance part of it, all horror movies have that, right?  I guess this depends on what you were looking for at the time of watching, if you are looking for a lot of story and some romance in a horror movie, go for it.",1356998400,,448,4.090909090909091
2006454,1,B0001JZXUW,This movie sucked big time.  It was slow and very boring.  The ghost was just a pale expressionless guy standing around watching. This movie was a total waste of time and money.,1354665600,,177,4.5

2006457,3,B0001JZXUW,"I like Mira Sorvino. She's the rare modern-day Hollywood actress who seems more interested in leading a fulfilling personal life, aging naturally & perfecting her craft than on glamour + money. This makes her a tad more relatable, just as one regular woman to another. I would think hetero male viewers would like her for (if nothing else) her long hair, slim figure & long legs. You could watch this tale with a date or a good friend & I doubt it'd bring up a lot of discomfort in either party. There's no nudity that I can recall, little (if any) foul language & minimal violence.

This is a quiet tale. If you liked Brittany Murphy's ""Deadline"", Fred Astaire's ""Ghost Story"" or Jennifer Connelly's ""Dark Water"", this would probably be your style of film. Personally, I love ""voyeurism"" films where you get to see someone as if no camera is watching, with them just living their life. I don't know why, but this type of film has always been appealing to me. It is reminiscent of seeing JoBeth Williams go about her day-to-day chores in ""Poltergeist"" before the supernatural stuff hits, where she senses something a little odd about her surroundings suddenly, but has no rationale to base that on. I suppose that early influence of seeing movies where the normal turns into the surreal, yet in a more quiet manner (at least until the final crazy climax) has stuck with me. I find that style of film infinitely more appealing than the gore-and-shock horror genre that a lot of so-called ghost stories tend to fall into these days. I'm a writer, so I can relate to the main character of the film, as that is also her occupation. She likes her peace, quiet & solitude- also like me. She is definitely not that great at forming or keeping relationships with people regularly- which I can relate to on some level. If you are more of a loner & appreciate beautiful views of the outdoors in your films (which I do), you'll dig this film, IMHO. The cinematography is admirable here. For that reason alone, I'll give it at least three stars. To me, I'd actually give this picture about three-and-a-half stars, because some elements are done just beautifully.

This is not a film that will leave you with nightmares for a week. It has it's eerie moments, but they're few & far between. The first hour is quite slow, though not dull to me. There are plot holes, which have been discussed on places such as IMDB. I like the film for it's atmosphere, it's leading lady (who makes a fairly unsympathetic role more likeable) & it's fairly easy-to-follow storyline. Yeah, there's a couple of places where you just think (especially in the last half-hour of the movie), ""WTF?"", because the plot gets a little out-there. Not everything makes sense in the setting Mira's character is in (it's EXTREMELY rustic, almost to absurdity by even just 20th century standards). And just in terms of realism- bathing, for example- certain actions would seem mighty difficult in this extreme type of setting. But I'm willing to put this stretch of imagination aside. It's kind of alluring to see a movie get totally back to basics. Is it a must-see film? No. Worth a viewing? It depends entirely on your tastes. Memorable? Eh, only in sparse places. I enjoyed it, and wouldn't mind seeing it again, but this IS my type of movie. I don't know if the modern blockbuster-loving public could go for it in droves. Sorvino did a good job here, even if the rest of the cast was a little forgettable. Dialogue is rather minimal here, and it's depth is fairly shallow. Watch it knowing you'll get nothing entirely new or really exciting here, but more of a movie that feels like a warm bowl of soup on a cold autumn day- there's just something refreshing & comforting about it in totality.",1347148800,2,3751,4.656108597285068
2006458,2,B0001JZXUW,"The movie was very choppy and kept ""loading"" every 10-20 seconds, then it might play for about a minute and then ""loading"" again. This was very frustrating and after about 10 min of this we stopped the movie and restarted it. After restarting the movie (and watching the first 10 min over again) the movie played fine with no problems. I noticed this problem with many Amazon rentals. I don't have streaming problems with any other site. The movie itself was very good and I'd give the movie at least 4 1/2 stars, I give Amazon 2 stars.",1347062400,,536,4.479591836734694
2006459,1,B0001JZXUW,The only reason I gave this film 1 star is because of the cinematography. The storyline was o.k. but it could have been much better. I would say skip it because there are a lot better haunted house ghost story films out there that are recently released.,1344470400,,253,4.404255319148936
