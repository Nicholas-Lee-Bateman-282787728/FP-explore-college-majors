731601,5,6303935397,"We Dive At Dawn is a standard issue, exceptionally well acted British war film about a submarine of the Royal Navy.  It is a visual masterpiece of Navy detail.  Sir John Mills et al, are well cast and extremely believable in their roles.

The filming was done on an actual submarine and depot ship.  I know a sailor who was in the depot ship, HMS Maidstone in Holy Loch Scotland, at the time the movie was made.  He advised me of a small detail that make the film much more interesting to watch.  If you look closely in the control room scenes, there is a sailor in a white turtleneck sweater close to Mills.  That sailor is the actual submarine CO keeping a close eye on things to make sure nothing awkward happens.

This film is a tale of submarine warfare in the Baltic Sea.  It was not an easy area for submarines to operate in because it is relatively shallow and a submarine likes to have a lot of water between it and the enemy on the surface.  This is not the case in the Baltic.  There were heavy casualties amongst British submarines sent to this area.

I had an opportunity to live in the Holy Loch area in the mid-60s when HMS Maidstone was replaced by USS Hunley.  As I look at the film, I see some of the same landmarks that were there in 1941-42 as in 1964 - absolutely unchanged.

What is a little bit different for this film is that we see a great deal of the life of the sailors of the Royal Navy.  It readily shows the team concept that is life in submarines.  Remember, there may only be 5-6 officers in addition to the captain.  The crew was essentially masters of their own destiny in a very real sense since even junior sailors had tremendous responibility placed on them.  And they excelled, uniformly.  The ending is typically understated British and yet highly effective.  As the submarine of the story returns, another departs on patrol, ""like a ruddy train line"" as the flag officer watching the boat leave comments to Mills as the latter stands by to give his report.

This is an exceptional movie and belongs in any navy history enthusiasts library.",1043884800,62,2079,4.418421052631579

731603,5,6303935397,"This B&W movie is a classic. You are given insight to the crew's personal lives and interactions. There is enough action (after the first 25 minutes) to keep you interested constantly. Very interesting, a few very exciting action sequences.

731604,4,6303935397,"A British submarine in WW2 is sent on an impossible mission to sink the German warship ""Brandenburg"".  To destroy their target, they must find their target - somewhere deep in enemy-controlled waters.  The captain navigates his submarine past nets, mines, and enemy destroyers, and then must clandestinely obtain fuel and oil from an enemy-held port for the return voyage.
This tale of submarine adventure was made with the support of the British military in the darkest days of WW2, so the boats you see really are warships and not Hollywood mock-ups.  The plot is fairly predictable and the overall production is hindered by thick British accents at times, but its still a good late-night war movie.  ""The Enemy Below"" and ""Torpedo Run"" are better, but this film is British and made under war-time conditions, so that counts for something in the ""Authenticity"" department.",974073600,33,874,5.090909090909091
731605,5,6303935397,"This is one of the best English movies of World War II.  From the taut suspense of the submarine sequences, to the humor of Portman's drunk scene in the fish and chips shop, this film is a wonderful portrayal of ordinary  life and the military during the war.",954979200,6,259,4.375
731606,2,6303935397,"This film was shot with the cooperation of the Royal Navy at the outset of WW2, so the boats you see are the real McCoy, which is pretty cool if you're a submarine enthusiast.  The plot is good, but the film is hampered  by: (a) thick English accents.  My American brain had some trouble  understanding some of the dialogue at the beginning of the film, but after  awhile I either adapted to the tongue or the actors spoke clearer. (b) poor  film stock.  Back in the 1940's war time pressures limited movie studios in  production qualities, so the sound is garbled a bit and the film clarity is  slightly blurry and grainy, as if you were watching this film through  water, and (c) character development which didn't seem to accomplish much  other than to slow down the pace of the film and give us some background on  the poor Brit sailor of German heritage who ends up saving the life of the  crew in a final act of heroism.
The submarine is sent to attack the  German battleship ""Brandenburg"" in the heart of German-controlled  waters.  The boat must go through mine fields and undersea nets to reach  its rendezvous point and make a daring attack.  It also makes an  unscheduled stop to steal fuel oil from a German-controlled port.  Good  action here makes it worth the struggle through the beginning of the  film.
Not the best WW2 sub film you'll ever see, but worth a viewing or  two.",950832000,12,1391,4.520161290322581

731737,5,6303935397,"Certainly dated, but excellently done.  Really good submarine film with excellent acting.  One of the top 20 war films I've seen.  A must have for the ""war"" collector and a should have for drama buffs.  Filmed during the war using a real submarine, about half of the film is about the off duty life of the characters and some of their backgrounds allowing you a sense their humanity.  The balance of the film is about their mission and how each character deals with the situations as they arise and their interaction with one another.  In a submarine, each crew member is an individual and must alter himself to fit within the team when it is demanded of him.  Often he must act on his own doing what needs to be done without input from the officers or other crew members, who must do likewise.  It is the toughest assignment in any navy.  You live in a metal tube unable to see sky or breathe unfiltered air for days or weeks at a time. This is a film that lets you feel the loneliness of being in a group, the fear that you feel no one else has and the thought that you may never see home and loved ones again.  If your idea of drama tends toward artificial CG, explosions and gratuitous violence, skip this one.  But, if you want to feel what life in combat feels like, watch fine acting and encounter suspense at its best in glorious black and white, then join the Royal Navy in this great film.",1454198400,2,1399,4.32183908045977

731830,4,6303935397,"Anthony Asquith's wartime action film is surprisingly good, given the constraints under which it was made.  The battle sequences are well staged, with stock footage intercut with interior sequences taking place in the submarine.  Asquith captures the claustrophobic life of the crew at sea, with each man trying to live as best they can under highly cramped conditions, while remaining loyal to their captain, Lt. Taylor (John Mills).  Everyone accepts that death might occur at any time, yet they try their best to extricate themselves from a difficult situation, after trying to torpedo a German battleship, the Brandenburg.  WE DIVE AT DAWN is an interesting example of a wartime propaganda film in which every social class is represented, from the upper class officer Lt. Gordon (Jack Watling), to the no-nonsense working class L/S Hobson (Eric Portman), who believes that his wife Alice (Josephine Wilson) has left him for the local fish-and-chip shop owner.  Once aboard the submarine, however, social divisions are forgotten: everyone is committed to the cause of destroying the battleship and returning home safely.  This message of all people pulling together was one of the most familiar refrains of World War II, both on the home and the battle fronts.  In the end the crew succeed in their task, but not without a daring raid on a Danish port in order to purloin some fuel oil, which they achieve in the face of spirited resistance from the Germans.  It is chiefly due to Hobson's resourcefulness that the crew succeeds.  WE DIVE AT DAWN might seem a little antiquated now, its social attitudes redolent of a bygone age, but it still stands up as an effective piece of wartime propaganda.",1408060800,,1700,5.0213523131672595

731859,5,6303935397,"I've long been a fan of submarine movies, and can't argue with the usual list of all-time greats, such as the WWII action films Run Silent, Run Deep and The Enemy Below. I've always added the Science Fiction adventure Around the World Under the Sea to the mix. (Saw that one when it first came out in 1966, and it has lost none of its charm over the years.)

Now I must include We Dive at Dawn as well. What a great film! Perfectly balanced between personal back stories and undersea action, with a believable plot and realistic combat scenes. I've of course never personally been aboard a submarine being depth charged, but I've nevertheless always found it a bit unrealistic when the crew is able to stop a sprung leak by turning a convenient valve. (?!?!?) Not in this movie! the bulkheads are warped and fissured, and water is pouring in at alarming rates. Also, the sub's torpedo attack was delightfully ambiguous (the crew doesn't learn the results until days later), just the way I imagine it would have been in reality. No stereotypes amongst the crew members - real people all.

In short, plenty of action, characters you genuinely care about, no wild innacuracies or implausibilities to laugh at. Also, interesting to see submarine warfare from the British point of view, instead of the usual German U-boat film or American submarines in the Pacific.

The movie does begin a bit slowly as we get to know the crew and their personal problems, yet once the sub is out to sea, the action moves along quite quickly.

The Sea Tiger's assignment is to locate a new German battleship and sink it, but they soon find that they have missed their target and must now follow the battleship into the heavily fortified Baltic Sea in order to complete their mission.

A tense depth-charge attack and a daring attempt to refuel the Sea Tiger in an enemy-controlled port are key sequences in this well made picture that co-stars Eric Portman.

Directed by Anthony Asquith

The plot is all about reality, submarine warfare in WWII, with all the behind the scenes thrown in for good measure. We Dive At Dawn is not one of the absolute best of this genre but it is very good. Any film involving John Mills would have a problem being bad. And there is also the marvelous Eric Portman.

This film is much stronger than the later submarine based film 'Above Us the Waves' also starring Mills probably because this was actually made during the war, when there was a real threat. It's a good story, with dastardly Germans (Nazi's) and the good old Royal Navy coming up with the goods.  Typical war film and Mills with his stiff upper lipped British officer role pulls it off brilliantly.  Mills, who must by now know how to command his own submarine, battleship and platoon. He makes it look believably realistic looking through a periscope searching for his next mission.

A must see film.  Highly recommend!

731976,5,6303935397,"WE DIVE AT DAWN directed by Anthony Asquith is an excellent submarine film. This is a very realistic film containing skillfully structured dialogue giving insight into the daily lives of the sailors aboard a British Submarine. It is very atmospheric and gives a good feel of what life may have been like aboard a submarine during WWII in part thanks to cinematographer Jack Cox and art designer Walter Murton whose efforts helped achieved this immensely. The exceptional cast includes Eric Portman, John Mills and Niall MacGinnis. Once again it's the ordinary man put into extraordinary circumstances that perseveres. I like this one.",1147651200,,634,5.2254901960784315
731977,5,6303935397,"I love a good war movie, but there's something really special about a good war movie made during a time of war - and Great Britain pretty much cornered the market on those during World War II.  1943 wasn't exactly a banner year in British history, but the spirit and pluck of the British spirit that would ultimately lead them to victory is strongly revealed in this memorable submarine drama.  We Dive At Dawn not only takes you underneath the waves for some pretty realistic combat, it gives you a great picture of submarine life and the camaraderie of the men who manned the tin cans of terror.

The movie starts rather slow, as we are introduced to the crew of the Sea Tiger as it heads home for a much-anticipated leave.  You've got guys just looking for a good time, an officer lining up appointments with all of his favorite ""aunts,"" a fellow with exceedingly cold feet over his pending nuptials, and one poor sailor who barely gets to see his little boy because his wife wants nothing to do with him.  The men don't get to relive civilian life for long, though, as orders soon come in for them to report back to their sub.  The Royal Navy has a special job for the Sea Tiger - sink the Brandenburg, one of Germany's fancy new battleships.  It's a dangerous mission, as the sub will have to travel close to the surface in order to make their appointed rendezvous time with the iron behemoth.  They have to be ever vigilant and ready to dive at a moment's notice in order to keep from being spotted by any German planes or sailing vessels.  It looks like the mission might be scrubbed when they discover they are too late to intercept the Brandenburg close to the German coast.  That's when the tension really begins to build, though, as the Captain decides to enter the dangerous Baltic Sea in pursuit of their prey.  The Baltic is dangerous territory; just getting in is a problem, and the comparatively shallow sea is laced with mines.  Once they finally spot the Brandenburg and fire upon it, they are assailed by depth charges that leave the Sea Tiger leaking water and spewing much-needed (and easily detectable) oil.  They don't even know if any of their torpedoes hit the target or not.  This is when things really get good.  A safe return to England looks darn near impossible - unless the sub can somehow play possum long enough to escape German eyes and somehow engineer a miraculous refueling at a hostile port.

There's nothing fancy about We Dive at Dawn.  It's just an excellent, realistic film that really gives you a feel for submarine life and combat during the height of World War II.  It also pays tribute to the indomitable British spirit that would see them through the darkest days of the early 1940s.",1136592000,,2730,4.559426229508197
731978,4,6303935397,"One has to admire the movie ""We Dive at Dawn,"" especially considering that at the time it was being made, Britain was still in the midst of fighting the Germans, and victory in World War II was nowhere near an assured thing.

The movie itself tells the story of the Royal Navy submarine Sea Tiger, and its pursuit into the Baltic of the German battleship Brandenburg. The movie starts a little slow with an odd little bit of what people today would call ""soap opera"" as we follow the seamen of the Sea Tiger on shore leave and see a glimpe into their private lives. That leave however is abruptly canceled as one by one the crew are recalled to duty on board the submarine.

That's when the picture really picks up with rising tension and suspense. To say anymore would realy spoil much of the fun of the movie, but be assured there is action aplenty and well shaped characterization in this gem of the British cinema.

One quibble about the transfer. When I first put in the disc I was somewhat perturbed by the quality of the movie with the occassional blurring and odd editing. However once the action began I found it easy to ignore these shortcomings (probably a result of the movie's age) and instead just enjoyed it's escapism.

This review refers to the Region 2 DVD release",1095724800,4,1282,4.512931034482759
731979,5,6303935397,"I agree with most other reviewers of this film.  It just may be the most realistic of all the WWII sub genre (except maybe ""Das Boot"").  The tape has a grainy image and the sound is sub-par.  This is forgivable because it adds to the film's realism.

Strong storyline and plot elements do a good job of keeping things moving between the somewhat low-key battle sequences (meaning that they are not ""in-your-face"" like typical Hollywood efforts).  An excellent cast contributes significantly to the overall success of this film.  The ensemble work is stellar.  The interplay between players is like the action, understated.  The end result is that the viewer is taken along by the story as a whole and a very competent script.

This film works well as a whole and stands up to multiple viewings.  Highly recommended.",1092528000,2,815,4.840579710144928
731980,5,6303935397,"Of the entire WWII sub genre of the 40's and 50's, this may be the  most realistic.  Filmed during the war in G.B., the film does an excellent job of weaving the crews personal and naval lives into a lively and coherent story.  The acting is typical low-key, stiff-upper lip British.  This allows the excitment to build naturally, without the hoopla of loud band music typical of Hollywood efforts.  In short, I like this film.

Now, the sound isn't perfect.  And yes, they speak in British accents.  (Afterall, it's a British movie.  What would you expect?  Texas drawls?)  The stock footage is limited to that available during a Britain under a veil of war security.  None of this detracts from a great story.

On the whole the film works well and stands up to multiple viewings.  One of the best of the genre.  Worth a purchase.",1092528000,3,831,4.595890410958904

The producers and directors have no idea how a submarine actually works.  The acting was very good and was done well by professionals; however, the whole story was hokey.  A professional submariner will tell you that is not what life in the boats is like.  A real submariner will tell you that life in the boats is hard and you have to work hard to make sure everything turns out Ok.  My recommendation is to look elsewhere for a good submarine movie --  Run Silent, Run Deep and Das Boot are the best examples -- the only thing missing from either one is the smell.",1495843200,,717,4.546875
