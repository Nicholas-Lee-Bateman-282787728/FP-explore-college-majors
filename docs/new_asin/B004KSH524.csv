8433376,5,B004KSH524,"This rare performance recorded at The Whisky in L.A is about a 45 minute concert back in 1979. The film isn't top notch but it's viewable w/ a little distortion top of the screen. This doesn't interfere w/ the performance. It fits w/ the punk scene and the audio is good enough. They cover a number of tracks from their 1981 album ""Nightmare City"" and even a few tracks from 1982 ""Escape From Planet Earth."" Also a cover of Stones ""Under My Thumb"" and a few unreleased songs. The Alley Cats consist of 3 members, Randy Stodola on guitar and vocals, Dianne Chai on bass and vocals, and John McCarthy on drums. Randy w/ his Dylan lyrics as well as vocals and Dianne vocals are just as beautiful as her bass playing. McCarthy fills this trio w/ some hard hitting drums. The performance is excellent as they switch vocals and seem to please the crowd. This is a rare performance and I am glad I purchased it. I think The Alley Cats are one of those bands that should of gotten more press than they deserve.",1335744000,,1002,4.39247311827957
