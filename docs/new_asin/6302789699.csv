7831263,5,6302789699,"A hidden gem!  This item has the official World Series highlight films from both 1952 and 1953, for a tiny fraction of what they cost from other sources.  As for the content itself, it's typical of the day, fake bat sounds, stiff posed players, and the droning, monotone narrative of Lew Fonseca, but all the highlights of each game are there.  If you want bells and whistles, this isn't it, but if you're just looking for genuine game film from ""the day"", this is it, at a great price.",1229040000,,486,4.438202247191011
