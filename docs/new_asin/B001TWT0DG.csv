We have seen Jo Koy on Chelsea Lately many times and have always laughed.  But 10 minutes into this DVD, we shut it off.  Boring, not clever, and definitely not funny.",1243382400,4,339,7.45

3794378,5,B001TWT0DG,"Sometimes a DAD has to just LET IT ALL OUT!! Which he manages to do in a brutally honest, yet heart-felt and hilarious way! His facial expressions ALONE can get you rolling with laughter! His impersonations of his son (and mom) are ri-di-cu-LOUS!! He tells it like he felt it, sharing personal, private stories about his relationship he has with his SON (and mom)! Does an incredible job of relaying his message so we ""feel his pain""! ROFL!!!  THIS is the one that has the story about his son's ""ting-ting""! Oh my!
The seller sent my purchase right on time and in excellent condition! I recommend this movie, and this seller to buy it from!
HAVE FUN!!",1393977600,,651,4.564102564102564
3794379,5,B001TWT0DG,"I am a huge fan of Jo Koy because he is from my home town and I find him and his material for his stand up to be quite hilarious. I can relate to his humor. Sure he's not funny to everyone, but I love him.",1393632000,,205,3.4782608695652173

3794382,5,B001TWT0DG,Excellent DVD! Was even better than the one they showed on Comedy Central. It was a great price & fast shipping. Very impressed!,1358294400,,128,4.608695652173913
3794383,5,B001TWT0DG,"The first time I saw Jo Koy on comedy central , I went to Amazon to look for his videos. If you like comedy Jo Koy will have you laughing with tears . Awesome !!!",1328486400,,162,3.657142857142857
3794384,5,B001TWT0DG,Koy is a rising star in the standup comedy for all i know about it and every since I heard of him I was on the floor laughing at some of his original stuff. I hope he continues his comic career for years to come.,1324425600,,212,3.7333333333333334
3794385,5,B001TWT0DG,Jo Koy is absolutely hilarious!!! Especially when he starts talking about his son and his mother and how she pronounces her words,1298851200,,129,4.909090909090909
3794386,5,B001TWT0DG,"Jo Koy is FANTASTIC.  It has a bit of language in it, but he is wonderfully funny.  I've shared this stand up with many people who all have different tastes and everyone really digs this guy.  He's GREAT~!  If you want to laugh hard and watch it again then this is a GREAT buy~!",1298073600,,278,4.092592592592593
3794387,5,B001TWT0DG,Jo Koy is the funniest comedian we've seen in a while.  I recommend him to anyone who wants a good laugh!!,1292889600,,106,4.0476190476190474
3794388,4,B001TWT0DG,This dvd is great. Jo Koy is hilarious from beginning to end. I saw him in person and I had to have this dvd. If you purchase this dvd you surely won't be disappointed.,1289865600,,168,3.9705882352941178
3794389,4,B001TWT0DG,"I was startled by how short this was without the commercials! Could have at least had ""bonus"" material to make it a full hour.  Jo Koy is hilarious that's for sure! If you ever have a chance to see him live, go! It's worth it!",1268352000,3,226,4.022222222222222
3794390,4,B001TWT0DG,I related to his jokes regarding to his Filipino mother and his son. The jokes he made regarding his trip to France and Michael Phelps at the Olympics were so hilarious.  His description of how women behave whether giving birth or driving a car is  true. It showed that he really respects his wife and the female. I highly recommend it to anyone who will enjoy a good laugh!  I wish his show was longer!,1266710400,6,403,4.346666666666667
3794391,5,B001TWT0DG,"The package was wrapped and was brand new.  The DVD was in brand new condition, just like it should have been.",1263686400,,110,4.238095238095238
3794392,2,B001TWT0DG,Nothing I expected.  I have seen him before and this was not his best work...also a little short.  I prefer Dane Cook.,1251849600,,118,4.318181818181818
3794393,5,B001TWT0DG,Jo Koy is a brilliant comededian that is rising on the scene. His style will leave you laughing and talking for hours after about how he finds the humor in life. They guy is hysterical!,1246752000,,185,4.314285714285714
3794394,5,B001TWT0DG,"I laughed so hard I cried! His bit on France alone is worth it! Very fast paced. And he's sooo energetic during his performance, which makes him incredibly fun to watch as well!",1246492800,2,177,4.393939393939394
3794395,4,B001TWT0DG,"Long interview short; if you like Jo Koy, and think the video (above) for this DVD is funny, just buy it!  It's worth it!

  This DVD has two sets of Jo's stand-up and numerous special features clips.  For fans of Jo Koy, I think this goes without saying as a must-have DVD.  However, that said, in my opinion, his Comedy Central stand-up (which is included in the special features of this DVD) is still better than the main ""Don't Make Him Angry"" set.  He seems more rehearsed and comfortable with his timing/material in that one, which was what caught my attention in the beginning.  Jo gives you the feeling of a good old friend you've known for years that just has a funny outlook on the things in his life, and doesn't mind telling you all about it.
  Otherwise, this DVD has lots of cool behind the scenes interviews included too, for example, you get a background on how his interesting career began to take shape in Las Vegas, interviews with friends, a quick little introduction to little Jo, etc.

Good entertainment, funny as hell; what more do you want in a stand-up DVD?",1246233600,3,1083,4.530927835051546
3794396,5,B001TWT0DG,i absolutely loved watching JO KOY's DVD... such a great guy and a great comedian... i had not received any problems with my order... it was perfect... plus the other copy was given to my Friend who admires Jo Koy...,1245715200,,216,4.425
3794397,1,B001TWT0DG,"Amazingly disappointing. He's so funny on Chelsea Lately so what gives?
Started off very unfunny and then began ranting about the French. The Bush/Chaney people must have been thrilled. If he's trying to impress that Hasselback lady on The View, he'll need to clean up his language first.

43 minutes was way too long for this piece of trash (we barely made 10). We usually give away dvd's cd's and things we don't want to Goodwill and other charities, but to save others the anguish, this one gets destroyed (in the greenest manner possible.) Thanks for nothing!",1244851200,,563,4.804123711340206
3794398,4,B001TWT0DG,"Love this guy. This special is funny, but it could have been longer. 42 minutes? I can't pay the price of a full DVD for 42 minutes of material. Same with Ron White's ""You Can't Fix Stupid"": Great material, but only 42 minutes?

There are standup comedy DVDs out there by comedians like Christopher Titus, Ralphie May, Pablo Francisco, even Ron White... that are 70, 80, 90+ minutes of material... THAT is something I might pay full price for, but 42? No.

If this DVD goes on sale sometime for 6.99 or something, it would be a bargain. The material is quite funny and not bad for his first time out. Remember, he's only started to make it big just recently. He's opened for a lot of great comedians, he's been on Chelsea Lately... he even did commentary for I Love the 80's. But this is his first big special, so the length is forgivable... Here's hoping he will have more material for his next one.",1244332800,9,900,4.4156626506024095
3794399,1,B001TWT0DG,"Netflix gave this rave reviews which means either their marketing staff was writing them or Jo Koy's friends were. Either way they managed to steal 43 minutes from me.

This is not an all night show. He doesn't have the time to wind up to the big grand slam. He needs to come out with both guns loaded and blazing. He does pretty much the opposite. He takes some not very funny material and tries to milk it which does little more than underline how unfunny the material is. The slow pacing and laconic delivery urged me to start looking at my watch which is not the right response to stand up comedy.

In all fairness he did have a couple of good bits about his young son's fascination for his ""ting ting"" and another about female genitalia but it simply wasn't enough to pull this out of the doldrums. I understand he's supposed to be a funny guy but there is no way you could tell so from this performance.",1243555200,3,909,4.309941520467836

8342381,1,B001TWT0DG,DVD would black out in middle of the stand up multiple times. Only reason it got one star is because Jo Koy is amazing!!!!,1494028800,,122,4.125
