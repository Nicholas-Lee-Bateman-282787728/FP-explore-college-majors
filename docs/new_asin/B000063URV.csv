8590433,1,B000063URV,The other cat who said save your money is absolutely right.  He described the DVD exactly.  This DVD along with all the others(I was dumb enough to buy the whole boxset which I'm returning) put me to sleep literally.  I'm embarassed to say I even watched this.  I had to force myself to get through it.  I'm definitely sticking to And 1.  Their DVDs might be a little on the short side but at least they're entertaining.,1096848000,,420,4.3896103896103895
