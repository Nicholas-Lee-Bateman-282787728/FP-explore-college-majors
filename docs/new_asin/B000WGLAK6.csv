He was a favorite to win his race in the Olympics, but when he found that the race was on Sunday, causing him to go against his convictions, he declined to run and swapped races with another athlete.  Eric Liddell went on to become a martyr in China and died during internment in a Japanese concentration camp.

I have also been keeping these cartoons in heavy rotation and the kids LOVE them. They watch the cartoons over and over again and never get bored. Best of all these cartoons are GOSPEL SATURATED.

2968415,5,B000WGLAK6,My children were fascinated by this story.  I love that someone has made a historically accurate account of Eric Liddell who stood up for his faith both in the Olympics and his later life. This is a great series for anyone who wants to show their share with their children the stories of real people who stood strong in their faith.  Excellent!,1206835200,2,344,4.532258064516129
2968416,4,B000WGLAK6,"The Torchlighters video series is a series of animated DVD's dedicated to ""Highlighting the honor, integrity and life-changing experiences of those well-known and little-known Christian men, women and children who in response to God's call, dedicated their lives to a life of whole-hearted commitment and passionate service to Jesus."" The series is targeted primarily at children between the ages of eight and twelve. It is a production of Christian History Institute along with International Films and Voice of the Martyrs. Previous entries in this series include brief biographical films of Jim Elliot, John Bunyan and William Tyndale. The fourth installment is The Eric Liddell Story.

I have watched all of these films with the family and we've enjoyed them. Like the others in the series, The Eric Liddell Story has moments that frightened the children--primarily when the Japanese Air Force was bombing China and the life of the story's hero was in danger. But the film is definitely family fare. The quality of the animation has not really increased and it is a long way from the kind of animation you might see in the big-budget films on the silver screen. Still, my children didn't seem to notice and they enjoyed learning more about Liddell. The film took them from his childhood in China, to his rise as one of the world's fastest men, to his Olympic triumph and to his missionary service in China. It closes with his internment in a Japanese camp and stops short of his death there of a brain tumor. The story was narrated by a Chinese character representing one of the men who was saved through the ministry of Liddell.

Like all of the Torchlighters titles, this one is a 30-minute feature and also includes a previously-recorded documentary on the subject's life. Like the others, it is a worthy addition to a family or church DVD collection. Future installments in the series promise to deal with the lives of Gladys Aylward and Richard Wurmbrand. And I look forward to watching those ones as well.",1200960000,11,2014,4.920588235294118
