8623970,5,B00GJXBU2E,"Teaching a class in which students dreaded the course (graduate level course).  This gave them an appreciation for the topics of economics. It shares the concepts from a perspective which they could relate to. They became eager about the topic, already looking forward to the rest of the course, saying it gave them a whole different view, one they can relate to and appreciate.  I would encourage a discussion, highlighting the concepts which some could be easily missed because you are so entrenched in their stories.  Definitely a permanent keeper in my video library.  Excellent documentary for all age groups engaged in the topic of economics.",1391817600,,648,5.084905660377358
8623971,5,B00GJXBU2E,My current observations of U.S. economic policy is that of constraining individual freedom. We have lost site of how economics and our freedom from tyranny are connected. Truly we are deserving of what we have chosen in political leadership. It is unsustainable however. This DVD is a reminder of the importance economics and it's effects on freedom.,1389052800,,350,5.157894736842105
