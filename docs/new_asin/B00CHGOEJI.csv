Al Di La' del bene e del male (1977) tells us about the relationship between Lou Andrea Salome, Nietzsche and Paul Kees. They agreed to live together and share common experiences.

But as soon the project begins, the problems emerge: jealous, rivalries and bitter contradictions lead to a hellish environment. The secure direction of  Cavani paves the way to show us with relentless realism the in and outs of a decaying social environment.

Dominique Sanda's alluring and enigmatic beauty (Remember Maria Casares?) dazzles the screen. Erland Josephson makes a very credible portrait of the German philosopher and Robert Powell's talent embodies the tormented spirit of Paul.

A brave and hard to watch movie that requests from you all your attention and emotional maturity. Not recommended for squeamish.",1461024000,,965,5.281045751633987
