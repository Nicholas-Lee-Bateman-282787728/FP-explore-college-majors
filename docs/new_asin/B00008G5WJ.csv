2342107,5,B00008G5WJ,"The reviews here (dated before 2012) are all wrong, this ALPHA video release of ""Sprintime..."" IS IN COLOR.  This is one of the few Alpha Roy Rogers movies that really is in color the way it should be.  It is uncut too.  So if you want a nice looking uncut color version of this movie this would be it.  By the way, the VHS tape of ""Sunset In The West"" put out by the Republic/Artisian company IS IN COLOR also and it looks beautiful.  It's listed incorrectly on the tape box and on Amazon too, but the Republic VHS tape of Roy's ""Sunset In The West"" IS actually IN COLOR and it looks great.  Buy it while you can. Make it a double color feature night of Roy with the Republic VHS tape of ""Sunset In The West"" and ""Springtime In Sierras"".  Happy Color Trails.",1343347200,6,759,4.1931034482758625
2342108,3,B00008G5WJ,"Springtime in the Sierras will satisfy every Roy Rogers fan with its wholesome portrayal of Good vanquishing Evil. Yet some of the subtext provides perks for those of us with a taste for the unusual. One of the bad guys looks and sounds just like Dabney Coleman. Whenever I re-watch this DVD, I keep waiting for him to make wisecracks. My anticipation, of course, is as futile as expecting Wile E. Coyote to catch the Roadrunner. But part of my guilty pleasure in viewing Springtime in the Sierras is waiting for this Dabney-like foil to fall into a trap set by three women, as in Nine to Five. The villainess in this flick is certainly capable of victimizing males. She manipulates a young man into crime, and at one point she has Roy hogtied in a walk-in meat locker. In the original version, she basks in a mink coat while taunting poor old Roy, who is freezing his tush off...suggesting a B&D scene. Unfortunately, the extended scene is clipped short in the version I bought. (Roy faces a similar plight in Son of Pale Face, when bandit queen Jane Russell ropes him to a barber's chair before riding off to commit her crimes.) But never mind the asides. Just watching Roy be Roy provides sufficient entertainment.",1336176000,,1217,4.638888888888889
2342109,3,B00008G5WJ,"Springtime in the Sierras, 1947 film

The movie begins with riders and horses. A stray fawn is rescued and take to an animal sanctuary. An organized gang of poachers hunts wild game in this area. The meat is sold to the wealthy. It deprives every American of their right to hunt. Bert challenges Roy to a fight. Roy pulls a prank with flash powder. [Out of character?] There is a song by Roy while he plays the guitar. A man shoots a doe in the woods. Roy chases this poacher but loses him in the woods. The game warden catches the gang, but someone catches him! They will make it look like an accident. Roy questions Bert. They sing at the funeral. Roy explains why the death was a murder: the gun was in Foster's right hand. Bert was unhappy with his previous job. Jean plans a celebration on her ""Lazy W"" ranch; its part of a trick to become a respected citizen. Jean has a pre-war imported rifle, its ammunition is scarce. Roy checks it.

Roy questions Bert about Captain Foster's death. There is a fight. [Impromptu entertainment?] ""Never trust a fat man."" What do they know about Jean and her friend Matt? A refrigerating plant? Geese, ducks, and venison are worth more than beef. Roy tells his suspicions to Kathy. Roy has a plan to learn more. Like a good confidence man, he manipulates Jean to do what he wants. But does this move fall into Jean's plans? The song ""What are you going to do then"" reminds us when people had no retirement pension. Roy finds the hidden freezer with venison, Jean and Matt find him. There is another fight, Roy is captured and left in the freezer. A frozen body in the hills will be another accident! Bert left Jean, but is lured back to the ranch. Will they try to make it look like another accident? Can Roy and Bert escape from cold storage? Cookie has a plan too. Things start to go wrong for Jean and Matt. Cookie's truck is like a Trojan Horse!

Roy is pursued by Jean's gang, and they are followed by Cookie and Roy's friends. [A chase is always part of an action movie; you know the movie will soon end.] Kathy catches u pto Jean, Roy catches up to Matt. The good guys triumph. There is a song about the end of the day. Kathy will leave the area.

It was unusual in these movies to have a murdering villainess in charge of a gang. [A novelty to attract audiences?] Could poaching be a lucrative business in place of stolen cattle? This story about illegally obtained goods could have been located elsewhere. Was the claim that using a telescopic sight isn't ""sporting"" true then? Does its anti-poaching story make it a message movie?",1291248000,,2580,4.436708860759493
2342110,4,B00008G5WJ,"75 minute version: Full length film. Absolutely first rate. Perhaps my favorite of any western, ever.

54 minute version: TV edit, done in the 1960's. Cut to run for one hour, with commercials. This is the version usually available nowdays. Not good at all. Important plot developments removed.

The 75 minute version is out there, if you look hard enough.",1204243200,,356,4.916666666666667
