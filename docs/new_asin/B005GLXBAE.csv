8471858,5,B005GLXBAE,You can't watch these episodes online without paying for them and this was cheaper. I like Bethany and wanted to see the continuation of her relationship even though I know it ends badly. I call it my trash TV.,1476576000,,210,4.410256410256411
8471859,5,B005GLXBAE,Can't get enough of Bethenny. What was great is that the DVD was cheap enough to purchase so I could watch at my pace and then I loaned to my sister who can now watch this season too!!,1426723200,2,184,3.8684210526315788
8471860,5,B005GLXBAE,"for those of you who love Bethenny, season 2 is a must have.  i saw her on Anderson
Cooper when her dress revealed her bottom & she just let it go.  why be silly, embarrassed &
apologize over & over, she just soldiered on.

Ellen was right about Bethenny being new voice for a talk show.  We loved her enough that her show has been picked up to being her back to us, i hope soon.  go Bethenny!

there is bad news, she said no more reality show.  no more Bethenny Ever After.  you can't see it but i'm pouting.",1345593600,,509,4.02
8471861,5,B005GLXBAE,"I have Bethenny's first season ""Bethenny Getting Married"" so I wanted to purchase her 2nd season as well and I cannot stop watching! She is such an amazing entrepreneur and truely inspires people to follow their dreams. Although she's got a potty-mouth, I absolutely adore her! I hope she keeps making more seasons of her show on Bravo.",1318377600,5,336,4.810344827586207
