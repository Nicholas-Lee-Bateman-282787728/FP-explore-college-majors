904007,5,6304653395,I won't talk about the in's-and-outs of the story line and the social impact of the film.  I'll just say that this DVD version being sold here on Amazon is an outstanding rendering of the original film.  This DVD version is sharp and well-made and I didn't notice any parts of the movie that were cut.  I'd recommend buying this DVD if you're looking for a great copy of the film.,1123200000,6,380,4.323943661971831
904008,5,6304653395,"This film was great it stuck in my head for years, I seen it on playboy magazine in 1977 and WOW!I could not believe the sex . It blew me away I neve seen anything like it ever. Then two years later I saw it in a second run theater the film story was something different at the time I was about 17 and I never seen a film like this before. So all these years I have been looking for this film. And now I could go back to that place in the darken theater an watch sarah & kris do what I rememberd the most about this film and the boy who played the son. I'll enjoy keeping this vhs but I hope it will be on dvd. It's a great film to thoughs who have seen it know what I am talking about I got my copy.",1062028800,5,700,3.6733333333333333
904009,2,6304653395,"This film is a failure, I think because surely it's based over a complex novel. Cinema is good for action and image, but surely has his limits. I don't know the original book of Mishima, but all these is evident. The  movie show us, not one, but two stories and truly there's no much cohesion  between the two: the children's gang and his chief -a little Hitler-, and  the history of the widow and the sailor. These two tales doesn't attain to  make a full unity, but remains as two different histories without no much  relation though full of pretentions and false steticism. Probably at his  time -1976- this movie was very daring owing the nudes of Sarah Miles, but  this is another tale.",960940800,7,691,4.524193548387097

I recently saw it again.  Disappointingly it has one of the most erotic scenes edited.  The trick of  showing time passing by having a picture boat glide across a picture ocean  really seems corny.

But the print I have which has an entirely different cover from the one pictured here, and uses the original film poster on the front, is complete. The crucial scene in the bedroom is uncut. So look for that version. It's a very strange, intriguing film that suffers from being reset in the UK instead of Japan, like the novel. Rituals are a huge part of Japanese culture, and without revealing the plot, so much depends on how well this works on film. You have to be convinced of this crucial plot element, and here it doesn't quite work. Sarah Miles is excellent, but Kris Kristofferson just isn't up to the task. It's beautifiul to look at, bold, haunting, and it will stay with you, but it's not without its problems. But it is worth a look.",1421884800,,792,4.394557823129252

904189,3,6304653395,"I'm another viewer who remembered this from years ago - I don't know if I've just changed with the years or what, but this really didn't seem near as erotic as it did when I saw it in the 80s.  Unfortunately I wasn't familiar enough with each intimate scene to determine whether the blu-ray is the full version or not, I'll see if I can find more detail to watch for as far as any censorship.  But I can say that I was not as impressed with Sarah Miles, somehow the lovemaking facial expressions were bizarre rather than exciting.  Cheesy editing for some of the fades and so forth to show time passing.  I don't know - I have a lot of old movies that still are just as hot to watch now as they were when I was young, so I had hoped this would be too.  Honestly, Sarah Miles is more interesting in Hope and Glory... although the two scenes of her alone are alluring, more than the scenes with Kris K... and those do appear to be intact (yet still awkward somehow).  The disc has zero special features - there is a ""menu"" but all it does is play the movie, I don't think it even has any subtitles.  But again, all of this would just be dismissed as ""well it's an old movie"" but it cost a lot to find out that it didn't quite hold up.",1400716800,2,1232,4.087136929460581

904191,1,6304653395,If you enjoy watching young boys secretly watching their mother undress and doing other things that can't be mentioned then this is your movie.

904192,1,6304653395,"I like Kristofferson's music, but I'd only ever seen him in ""A Star is Born"" in which he played himself, so I didn't know what a horrible actor he was.  He plays this hick from Kansas who became a sailor and seduces a widow.  The widows son is a member of a gang of private school boys who have declared war on adults for some unknown reason.  They drug and mutilate a cat, then do the same to Krisofferson at the movies end.  Sad that anyone would make this movie.",1394668800,2,465,4.133333333333334
904193,3,6304653395,"Made four decades back via bastardizing a Japanese novel, this film treatment is more Henry Miller and Oedipus than Eastern culture.

While the novel focused on the sailor's vision of his future at sea and the way it was compromised by his affiar with the widow, this capitalized on 1970s sexuality zeitgiest in film exploiting the relationship between the sailor and widow against the Oedipal foil of the son who, abetted by a Lord Of the Flies-type club of upper class school boys, exacts revenge on the sailor in the end.

The film is full of sexual symbols, none greater than the boys' meeting place. It won't shock anyone in 2014 except those that have read the book and fall asleep waiting for something to happen in the first hour of the movie. If you make it to the second hour, the sexuality and boys' perversions is far greater than what the book had to offer.",1393200000,,870,4.57051282051282

904266,5,6304653395,"The tagline speaks for itself on this one. It has a bit of everything. Sexuality, horror, mystery and the ending will surprise and creep you out!

904267,4,6304653395,"It had been many years since I first saw THE SAILOR WHO FELL FROM GRACE WITH THE SEA. I had forgotten what a beautiful film it is to look at and what a perverse film it is thematically. I've never read the original Yukio Mishima story but considering his life and death, I shouldn't be surprised by the content. I hadn't read the story before seeing the film and now I'm glad that I didn't. A number of reviews talk about how it doesn't work in its English setting transplanted from the Japanese. That may be but with nothing to compare it to, I found the English seaside setting most effective. Now, out of curiosity, I'll seek out the original and make my own comparison. The inherent British class system among the boys lends itself to the events that unfold. The head boy, known simply as ""The Chief"" (a wonderfully disturbing performance by Earl Rhodes), comes from a wealthy and privileged background. He is all intellect and no emotion making him a Nietzschean prototype who despises the weak and seeks perfection in all forms. The other boys, who aspire to his position and wishing to curry favor, hang on his every move and go along with him in each increasingly disturbing act that he commits. One of these boys, Jonathan (Jonathan Kahn), is the central character of the film for it is his connection with The Chief and with his widowed mother (Sarah Miles) that is the primary focus of SAILOR.

Despite the film's great beauty (lovingly photographed by Douglas Slocombe) and evocative music from Johnny Mandel (M*A*S*H) or perhaps because of it, the film becomes increasingly uncomfortable to watch ***SPOILERS*** as we are invited to take part in voyeurism (the boy secretly watches his mother undress in her bedroom), dispassionate violence (the boys dissect the Chief's house cat), and a final scene that saddened me. Perhaps that's the point. Writer-director Lewis John Carlino started his career as a playwright (THE BRICK & THE ROSE) before becoming a screenwriter (THE MECHANIC) and occasional director (THE GREAT SANTINI, CLASS). He knows how to write dialogue and how to bring characters to life. My question is...Why these characters? There is much food for thought here but most of it is of a very depressing nature. The love scenes between Miles and Kris Kristofferson are no longer scandalous just erotic and they heighten the impact the film ulltimtely has. Back in 1976 this was considered a mainstream film that many people went to see (the spread in PLAYBOY didn't hurt) and that was all but dismissed by critics. Today it would be an arthouse indie that would garner critical awards and audience indifference (think NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN). Along with A CLOCKWORK ORANGE it remains one of the most pessimistic movies ever made. Although well done, I have no desire to see it again.",1386633600,,2810,4.829875518672199
904268,5,6304653395,"One of my favorite all time movies. I was spellbound throughout and finished in a state of shock.  Beautify produced, directed, and performed.  A must see for anyone looking for superb drama.",1381968000,10,191,4.9375
904269,1,6304653395,"I wouldn't advise this movie to anyone.
If I had seen anything like that before, I never would have purchased it , never would have given it a
second thought!
I love Kris and his acting. He's one of my favorites.
BUT was shocked at the kids in it and the way that the cat was killed poisoned by these kids
holding the cat and pouring it down the cats mouth.
Anyway, IF it disturbs you to see any abuse of an animal, I Would NOT purchase this. I haven't read all of the reviews, but had no idea this was in the movie. All it says is it get's more shocking. Just the scene of poisoning a cat and a very sick one from the abuse of the kids in the movie, I don't want anymore of that kind of shocking. I know that Kris was very young in the movie and in life I doubt now he would have condoned it.
I think on the cover it should have WARNING, Animal abuse.
I would have never purchased the movie. I wish that I hadn't. I can't get that out of my mind.
Hope it helps. Kris has way too many GOOD movies to choose from.",1375920000,3,1012,3.893719806763285

904273,1,6304653395,"This is an interesting film about an American sailor who decides to give-up the sea life for an English woman who seems to be in need of sexual gratification after the death of her husband (who may have been killed by unsuspected foul play). Unfortunately, her son is a member of secret gang led by some arrogant kid who hates adults and their rules that have created laws and civilization in order to protect the ""weak."" He even poisons a house cat as ""punishment"" for leaving behind its wild ""nature"" and living a pampered life. This is also the fate that awaits the sailor. This review isn't for the film itself but the blu-ray edition. If this had been released by a major studio, I think we might have expected a decent release from the best available elements. But this Shout release obviously used a very poor source for this ""high-def"" transfer. The images are generally washed-out, definition is poor, flesh-tones tend to be on the red side, there are specks, dirt and imperfections galore, and dark scenes are devoid of clarity, marred especially by pixel-failure where whole portions of the screen seemed blanked-out. There was obviously no attempt to ""clean"" it up. Just horrible. The DVD version is far superior to this, if only because the imperfections are less obvious.",1340236800,7,1285,4.819004524886878

An abysmal transfer, made from what must be the same ancient scan of the film elements that was struck many years ago for what, the DVD release, maybe even as far back as a LaserDisc. An entire rogues gallery of defects, including deep black crush, pasty release print looking skin tones, plugged up and constricted contrast ranges, etc. etc. All in all you wind up with something that looks just like the height of video quality, from around about 1990. It's not even for sure, from the look and feel, that the original transfer was at 2k. It may be a 1k transfer now scaled up to Blu-Ray resolution presentation.

Oh, and this is a featureless disc. Not even a menu. No extras at all. You can't even access a pop up while it is playing. It can be started and stopped. That's it.

What with Mill Creek, for example,  blowing out their old, and vastly superior transfers for as little as $5.99 this disc is an insult at $19.99 and certainly at the pre-release, pre-order  price of $24.99.

At least one of the sexual scenes was omitted and and another chopped up I believe.  It has been a long time.

Both of the available VHS copies and the newer anamorphic DVD copy are missing at minimum two to three minutes of original footage. Namely, the much talked about graphic sex scenes that drive the morbidly perverted plotting of the boy and his sicko gang. At least one copy has also done a horrible job of overdubbing a new crappy musical score over the original.  In some places, you can even hear a sort of double exposure of the audio (old bleeding into the new).  A terrible remastery job if you ask me.  This film did make it onto the early HBO broadcasts around 1979 or 1980, I remember watching it over and over until the tape was nearly worn out.  If you are looking to see this film in its original pristine state - which stands alone as a fairly good work of art, despite the fact that it veers pretty far from what Yukio Mishima originally intended with his writing - then you'll have to acquire a 16mm print that hasn't been cut down from it's 211-or-so minutes and transfer it to DVD yourself.

904386,4,6304653395,"Yukio Mishima was a fascinating writer, and as interesting as his writing was, it was almost overshadowed by his real life. One of Mishima's overarching themes was perfection, and how once perfection is achieved--for instance, a body builder or warrior attains his peak physical form--then decline is inevitable. Age takes its toll, and Mishima argues that he would prefer death rather than witness that decline. This is the theme of his extended essay, called Sun and Steel, and also the theme of The Temple of the Golden Pavilion, where the young acolyte burns down the temple rather than see it fade from its former glory. Sun and Steel, in particular foretells Mishima's own fate, as he died after forming his own militia and calling for an overthrow of the post WWII Japanese government. When his coup d'tat failed, he committed the ritual samurai suicide, Hari Kari, on November 25, 1970.

Destroying something when it begins to fall from the state of perfection is also the theme of The Sailor Who Fell From Grace With the Sea. The story is set in England instead of Japan, with Kris Kristofferson playing an American sailor named Jim Cameron (I'm the King of the World!), but it doesn't really translate that well in this filmed adaptation. Mishima's writing is very intense, and he can be making a completely reasonable argument, but then he will just take a leap into the irrational. It would be hard to translate to film, and though a valiant effort is made, it falls far short of the mark.

Sarah Miles plays an Englishwoman living in the port city of Dover in Britain. She sells antiques and is a single mother raising a young teenage son. She is very close to her son, perhaps too close, and they share many passions. They both fall in love with the American sailor played by Kristofferson, but in their own ways. The son sees him as a hero, but only as long as he remains true to the sea. When he decides to settle down with the boy's mother, he sees that as a betrayal.

Also complicating the situation is a young nihilist at the boy's school who psychologically bullies the students, dubbing himself the chief, and assigning them all numbers in the pecking order. The chief feeds the boy's sense of betrayal, and you just know that things are not going to end well--for anyone, but especially for Kristofferson, and the poor cat, Sebastian.

Sarah Miles and Kristofferson both do a good job with the basic story of the romance. The boy, played by Jonathan Kahn, the chief (Earl Rhodes), and the rest of their group are O.K., acting-wise--but they are all just so IRRITATING! The Chief was no doubt meant to be irritating to adults and those not under his sway, but was he not also meant to be charismatic? I didn't sense any of that, he just seemed like an arrogant cry baby. The film comes off as a mishmash of  The Love Boat, Love American Style, an after school special, a little bit of soft core, and The Lord of the Flies. It really doesn't do the Mishima material justice.

904387,4,6304653395,"Anne Osborne (Sarah Miles) is a young widow living in a picturesque seaside village in England.  Her troubled son has fallen in with a bad crowd; he belongs to a secret society run by a bully who has his own very definite ideas about the proper order of things.  When Anne decides to marry a merchant sailor (Kris Kristofferson), her son takes the news quite badly and turns to his pals for help.

This movie was quite controversial in 1976, and with it's graphic sexuality and shocking cruelty, it still is.  Miles is well-cast as the needy widow but sometimes overdoes the cow-eyed trances and histrionics.  Kristofferson looks the part of a rugged seaman and the two have great chemistry.  The creepy boys club provides some truly cringe-worthy moments as innocent young boys commit unspeakable acts, and this movie is not for the squeamish (especially animal-lovers).

Lovely Devon locations contrast nicely with the increasing tension and overall feeling of doom.  An interesting and haunting movie for adults.",1259020800,3,1015,5.0359281437125745
904388,4,6304653395,"The Sailor Who Fell From Grace With the Sea is an erotic love story gradually transformed into gothic horror.  It brings together a lonely widow, a jaded sailor and a group of boys straight out of The Lord of the Flies.

Scenes of graphic nudity and lovemaking along with an intense scene involving the boys and a cat make this a movie best suited for adults.

The scenery and photography provide a beautiful background for a very disturbing tale.",1256169600,,447,4.632911392405063
904389,3,6304653395,"""The Sailor Who Fell From Grace With The Sea"" was a shocking film when first released in 1976 because of its blend of sex and mystery-bred tension.  The newly-released DVD is very high quality and the content--based on Yukio Mishima's novel--remains erotic and scary.  The performances are very good, with Sarah Miles especially showing her strengths (and lots of other things).  The film is polarizing; many will stop watching in the first 30 minutes, but most will find it captivating.",1221004800,4,487,5.0625
904390,3,6304653395,"Haunting, and utterly creepy oddity from the 70's, a time when film makers could finally begin to bring their personal artistic visions to the screen, without the fear of censorship.  The subtle, romantic affair between the woman and the sailor, and the disturbing nature of her young son and his band of twisted friends, make for a jarring combination of light and darkness, innocence and evil.  The seaside village is extremely beautiful and provides a fine backdrop to the tale.  But after all I heard about ""controversial sex scenes,""  I must admit that i didn't see anything of the sort.  There is one scene early on in the film, where Sara Miles masturbates in front of her mirror, while her son watches through a peep hole, covered in sweat!  But after that there was really nothing.  The scenes with Miles and Kristoferson just aren't there.  The scene always seems to begin after they are finished with the sex and just lying in eachothers arms.  It seems that so much is missing that parts of the story don't even make sense.  For instance, when the mother goes berserk after she discovers her son watching; why does she go so crazy, I have to wonder what he saw, because i didn't see anything!  Also something he sees through that peephole causes him to develop a totally unreasonable hatred and disrespect for his mother, and her lover, who always treated him very nicely!  If this is indeed cut, it is only evidence that censorship is still alive and well and thriving in the closed, dirty minds of Americans.  It seems like we should have made some progress since the 1970's, but it saddens me to see that we have somehow degenerated as a society, at least in our views of sexuality.  This saddens me for some reason.  Other than this glaring and unforgivable flaw, the dvd offers a gorgeous, widescreen print of this film, making it an even greater loss somehow...",1219276800,21,1879,4.685975609756097
904391,3,6304653395,"There is much to like in this film.  It's certainly stylish, has nice shots of the sea and the English countryside.  The actors, Kristofferson and Miles were at the peak of their appeal, and yes, there are plenty of explicit love scenes.  However there are a lot of problems, too.  The Amazon reviewer does a good job of laying them out.

I found reading some of the reviews of Mishima's novel from which the film is made very useful.  It makes much more sense in the context of Japanese culture.  Translating it into Western culture robs the story of any credibility, in my opinion.  Kristofferson, too, is quintessentially American and brings a very realistic quality to this tale which is quite spare and almost surreal.  Mishima's style can make you accept the story he's telling but when it's translated into this realistic, Western setting, much more needs to be explained in order for the film to work.

The ""Chief,"" a young boy who obviously has a dreadful home life, is presented as a psychopath whose cruelty to animals is justified, he thinks, by his superior mentality.  Think Leopold and Loeb.  I found it hard to believe that he would have been able to get so far with this group of boys, given the fact that they were all from apparently well to do families.  The mother, played by Sarah Miles,  dislikes this boy but somehow her son manages to keep close company with the group, to the point where he is carried away with the insanity the Chief teaches.  The boy, Jonathan, at first is enamored of Jim, the sailor, played by Kristofferson and it seems to be a healthy connection.  I found the change in Jonathan to lack credibility.  No doubt it works in the novel; here it just seems terribly odd and oddly terrible.  The actor playing Jonathan isn't great; maybe that's part of the problem.

It seems that quite a few of the reviewers here are fans of the film for the sex scenes.  If that's all you're looking for, I'm sure you can find better ones elsewhere.  If you're looking for the meaning of the tale, then I recommend reading the book.",1205539200,7,2061,4.576502732240437

904393,1,6304653395,"I purchased this wierd film today on 1/2 price from media play.

I thought it might be an interesting sea film, and it delivers on that point. The cinematography is gorgeous, but the cruelty overshadows it. Thank God for DVD. I was able to stop the scene, and go to the next, when they are about to ""operate"" on the cat. And I am putting this mildly!!! I would like to take those kids, and castrate them myself!!!!

The scene with them on the row boat is no better. This is where the Chief little brat (and i am being nice!) throws a fire cracker up in the air, the seagull catches it,and blows up and dies!!! Yikes, i can't believe i am explaining this stuff!

The sex is no big deal! I could have directed it better myself!

At least the film folk put in that no animals were harmed during the making of the film! That would be evil in itself.

I wonder nearly 30 years after what the kid actors think of this film ..they are in their 40's now... and what Kris Kristofferson thought of all of this... the ending doesn't go into detail. You know what's going to happen... these kids like the Manson Family too much! anyhoo, that's my story and i am sticking to it!!!",1137024000,12,1167,4.238738738738738
