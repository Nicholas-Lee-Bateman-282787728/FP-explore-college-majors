8511431,4,B00771AV1I,"Japanese filmmaker Inoue Umetsugu made some movies for the Shaw Brothers Studio in Hong Kong. Some of these films were remakes of his Japanese movies. Hong Kong Rhapsody(1968) is a fun, campy, Japanese/Hollywood style musical comedy-drama.
Xiao Ping(Li Ching) plays an orphan who lives with magician Chen Tsz-hsin(Peter Chen Ho). Tsz-hsin is a womanizer, but he has to clean up his act around Xiao Ping. A grumpy, old rich guy tries to help Xiao Ping succeed in the entertainment business.
Most of the Hong Kong movies that people are familiar with are kung fu movies and shoot-em-up action thrillers. Hong Kong's film industry has also made comedies, dramas, horror movies, historical epics, ""plum opera"", swordplay epics, and more.
The Great Hollywood Musical genre went downhill in the 1960's. Dreamgirls, High School Musical(2006) and TV's Glee have sparked a renewed interest in musicals. Many ex-Vaudeville entertainers worked on classic Hollywood musicals. Hong Kong Rhapsody has slick production values and a fun, larger than life feel. For two hours, we get to relive the 1960's. The music score is good, too. The film does have some corny melodrama and romance. Hong Kong Rhapsody is hardly a ""masterpiece"". There's too many cliches, stock characters, and some of the storytelling is contrived. Xiao Ping's friends just happen to be aspiring musicians!  Most of the film's colorful musical numbers take place in the last half of the movie. Hong Kong movie starlet Li Ching is quite lovely. She acted in an assortment of movies. The late Peter Chen Ho was a ""Chinese Cary Grant"". In the 1970's, more and more macho men such as Jimmy Wang Yu, Bruce Lee, and Ti Lung dominated Hong Kong movies.  At one time, women dominated the silver screen! Hong Kong Rhapsody(1968) is a fun, colorful product of its time.",1352678400,,1815,5.046666666666667
