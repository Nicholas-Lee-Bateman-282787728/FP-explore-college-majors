4267842,5,B0046GDMV8,"Loved, loved, loved this family movie with Robert Townsend, Angela Bassett, Victoria Rowell and others.  The actors were great.. very professional. The story line was touching depicting a family ""set on Chicago's West Side"" coping with grief.  I guarantee you'll love it!",1310515200,2,271,5.428571428571429

The movie is about lost, love, redemption and hope. A modern day tale that should have made it to the big screen. I don't want to give the plot away but please buy, watch, or rent.

4267844,4,B0046GDMV8,"Excuse the culinary pun., But this movie is gourmet soup The casting,scripts, lights cameras and action all made up the ingredients this great family movie.., I give it a solid ""A""... Between family issues and social environment issues parents today can't always bring their family through to a clear emotional, methodological point a-z safe path thru life., Here is where the father searches himself for those answers where he becomes conscious of his wife's demands to increase his roll as a father...",1307318400,6,503,5.146341463414634
4267845,5,B0046GDMV8,"Yes Robert Townsend has done it again.  I just happen to come across this movie did not know anything about it.  Since i am a Robert Townsend fan since his variety shows and the 5 heartbeats and his first movie i knew i had to buy it.  I was not disappointed with the stellar casts and the theme of hurt, pain, forgiveness, and just saying i am sorry.  This movie tugged at my heart.  I laugh, cried and reflected on the decisions  that i have made in my life.  This movie touches the heart's of man and do not forget the box of tissue when you watch it.",1306713600,7,554,4.074074074074074
4267846,5,B0046GDMV8,"Before I watched this film I knew nothing about it.

This is a movie for the whole family (and you should watch it together). Thanks Robert!",1301529600,6,245,4.466666666666667
4267848,5,B0046GDMV8,"Robert Townsend never ceases to amaze me. He must have put his own money behind this, because, hollywood ain't sayin' nothing about it. And it is a wonderful movie. Felt it might be good. But, didn't know it would be as good as it was. The anguish felt after the loss came through so mightily, it touched my heart. The turmoil in the home came through. This was just an excellent movie. And they took the time to tell the story. Kudos.",1300838400,,435,4.317073170731708
4267849,5,B0046GDMV8,"It is great to see Robert Townsend returning to movies again and especially with the talented and gorgeous likes of Angela Bassett and Victoria Rowell!  I would give spoilers but the movie revolves around family, tragedy and importance of God to get through life's tough spots; we need more family oriented movies like this, Hollywood has entrenched itself the making of violent movies, this is a great movie for all ages, races and religions, just buy it!",1296432000,63,456,4.922077922077922

4267880,5,B0046GDMV8,"My son being one of the stars of the film aside, the movie was very moving with strong, positive messages and issues that affect our community today. It is a film every black family in particular should see because it provides us with examples of faith in God, love of family, and solid family structure with the father at the head of the household. (the way it should be)",1405036800,,372,4.405797101449275

4267883,5,B0046GDMV8,This movie was a great one about a father raising his family after the lost of their mother.  It is a family movie with a great story behind it.,1400112000,,144,3.9655172413793105

4267885,4,B0046GDMV8,I enjoyed this family oriented film. .. it has a great message for all ages.  It was both moving and exciting. ...I purchased it and would like to see more family oriented and inspiring films like this. Thank you Robert Townsend!,1393200000,,229,4.585365853658536

4267890,5,B0046GDMV8,"Even after reading several reviews for this film, I wasn't prepared for the emotional grasp it places you in, and keeps you in for the duration of the movie. What I like most about the movie is that it wasn't overacted, overproduced or overdone. Each character played their role as if it was really their life. No token rappers or singers to sell tickets or to gain appeal, just a well written story with a good plot.

This is a Black movie, that doesn't offer the stereotypical portrayal of Black culture. There is no foul language, no exaggerated ignorant people who are from the ""hood"", and practically everyone actually speaks without the use of slang. You can't make enough movies like this. Robert Townsend isn't given enough credit. Makes you wonder how different things would be if he actually did end of writing for BET before Bob Johnson refused to bring him on board.

Simply put, watch this movie with your family, friends, loved one, etc... It is a gift to be shared by all.",1378512000,,987,4.634285714285714
4267891,5,B0046GDMV8,"This movie started a little slow but once you get into it, its not a bad movie. The youth group in my church watched it on our summer trip.",1376956800,,139,3.8275862068965516
4267892,5,B0046GDMV8,"A tear jerk-er.  A true reality of what can occur in a family when a love one is suddenly gone from your life whether through illness, accident or being murdered.  A sudden change is taking place in your life and it can be overwhelming.  You do question why, you do get angry at God and nothing no one says seems to help.  But God is always there to strengthen you and He understands the pain you are feeling and He will comfort you with memories of that love one.",1375056000,,464,4.179775280898877
4267893,5,B0046GDMV8,This is how movies of 2010's should be made dealing with topical but pertinent family issues. The young men were particularly great actors.,1373414400,,139,5.086956521739131
4267894,5,B0046GDMV8,This movie is great and gives one a lot to think about.  It is a must see. Order this one. Life's lessons.,1365811200,,106,3.8181818181818183
4267895,5,B0046GDMV8,"I stayed on the West Side of Chicago for a year and recognize the intersection of the fatal accident that starts the story ""Of Boys & Men.""  When tragedy strikes, lots of little tensions burst into flame, threatening every relationship in the family.  The unfairness and poverty of the inner city only add more pressure. Each of the family members is a distinct character with his or her own issues to resolve.  Townsend does a fine job playing the widowed father trying to deal with his own grief and keep the family together.  I would have liked the theme song to be something less syrupy and more tough to reflect the gut feelings in the situation, but this is a minor criticism.",1364688000,,682,4.565573770491803
4267896,4,B0046GDMV8,I liked the movie because it showed how people can go through hardship and find the strength to forgive and survive.,1360022400,,116,4.571428571428571
4267897,5,B0046GDMV8,"Here is another 5 star movie. I thought the acting was great. Real deep story with lots of truths in it.
It had comedy, drama & it will even bring you to tears. To top it off, the ending was very good.",1355702400,,201,3.8095238095238093
4267898,5,B0046GDMV8,Not the best I have seen but as a coping tool for men going through a lost it was fine.  Shows that women are stronger in times of lost.,1355270400,,136,3.689655172413793
4267899,2,B0046GDMV8,Robert Townsend has ALWAYS been a bad actor!! This movie left me asking too questions like why was the oldest son in the house with the guy who was raping the Lil boy when Robert came to beat him up?? Also what was in the envelope that the white man gave him?  Why did the son move away? This movie wasn't detailed enough for me,1348358400,,328,4.046153846153846
4267900,5,B0046GDMV8,This is a great movie to sit down on movie night and watch with the kids. This movie touches all ages from 5 yrs to grown ups.,1347148800,,126,3.7037037037037037
4267905,5,B0046GDMV8,"I turned to this movie not knowing what to expect. It was sad but really good. I lost my mom at an early age so the tears were just rolling as I watched them deal with the loss.
5 star movie!",1346976000,,191,3.682926829268293
4267906,5,B0046GDMV8,"Great film about how different family members cope with grief. Angela Bassett portrays the mother killed in a traffic accident, leaving her husband (played by Robert Townsend), a workaholic, to raise their three children. The fact that the kids are far apart in age presents interesting storylines as each are also contending with personal issues, such as career and peer pressure. The movie also addresses the subject of sexual abuse in a sensitive manner. The screenplay, acting, and directing are all top-notch. This film should be shown in all middle and high schools.",1344902400,,572,5.161290322580645
4267907,5,B0046GDMV8,"I really enjoyed watching this movie. I finally had an opportunity to watch the entire movie. The plot was amazing and contained a great deal of reality. It was very sad, but it teaches one to appreciate family and don't take life for granted. Tomorrow is definitely not promised! When someone go through a difficult time like that, you have to continue to pray and depend on God for strength.",1343606400,,393,4.628571428571429
4267908,5,B0046GDMV8,"I am usually very critical about movies, but I must say that this movie was a true depiction of what happens when a loved one is lost suddenly. I really enjoyed it and always enjoy Robert Townsend! Highly recommended!",1339027200,,217,4.589743589743589
4267909,5,B0046GDMV8,"This DVD was a great add to my group dealing with loss. The teens I work with found it relatable. I also was able to incorporate other aspects of the movie into our discussion from the movie such as peer pressure, male role models andappreciation of family. Great DVD!",1335916800,,268,4.489795918367347
4267910,5,B0046GDMV8,"It was very touching and worth every dime I paid for it. He was a confused father but he found his way back He was awaken by God and he begin to hear his son cry for help, because he missed his mama so much. Very inspirational. Loved it.",1335744000,,237,3.857142857142857
4267911,5,B0046GDMV8,This is an excellent movie with a very real and relatable story line. Robert Townsend did his thing with this one! 2 thumbs up!,1332201600,,127,4.333333333333333
4267912,5,B0046GDMV8,"Although it was very sad at times, I really enjoyed this movie. It's hard to write a review without giving the story away, but I will say that it's worth adding to your collection.",1331164800,,180,4.323529411764706
4267913,5,B0046GDMV8,This is definitely a movie that I think everyone can relate to on one level or another. It makes you appreciate your family more and the things that GOD has blessed you with. This movie is truly a testimony within itself. I would recommend that every family see this movie.,1330214400,,273,4.48
4267914,5,B0046GDMV8,Found this movie to be outstanding with each character giving their all. In my opinion this is a MUST see and add to your collection. 5 stars to Robert Towsend,1326499200,,159,4.333333333333333
4267925,5,B0046GDMV8,"this movie is a must see for anyone who has lost a love one. It starts off a bit slow but it is well worth watching. ""Kudos"" to Robert Townsend...excellent movie",1326326400,,161,4.225806451612903
4267926,5,B0046GDMV8,"Believe it or not this was really a good movie. It all boils down to family struggles, strengths  and values. Not the typically shoot it up bang bang stereo types you find in some of the  african americans movies. This movie does hit home in alot of ways (just warning you). But overall the whole family can enjoy this movie. All ages.  Check it out.",1324857600,,350,4.3538461538461535
4267927,5,B0046GDMV8,"ROBERT TOWNSEND does it again this one of the best family dramas I have seen since SOUL FOOD. I can't understand why it is not on TV, Lifetime of Hallmark.",1323907200,,155,4.2
4267928,5,B0046GDMV8,"Normally I am not a fan of Robert Townsend movies for the simple fact that they are normally stupid and stereotypical. However, this movie was nothing short of Amazing...Townsend stars in the movie as a father that is forced to have to deal with the reality that he is now a widow. His wife Angela Bassett is killed in an auto accident. Townsend is now forced to care for his children alone, his sister Victoria Rowell comes to help. Townsend starts to spiral downward because he loves his wife so much that it is that much harder to deal with the fact that she is gone. So he starts to become angry and bitter and holds a grudge against the driver that ran into his wife. The movie is very emotional and even though Angela Bassett's part was not long due to being killed, the movie does numerous flashbacks and shows her talking to Robert as a ghost. It is a must have and worth then the $8. I don't say that much about a movie but its true in this case.",1323475200,,955,4.252747252747253
4267929,5,B0046GDMV8,"This move is very good and is not the usual Poverty/in the Hood type of movie that is so often associated with African Americans.  For not being a stereotype, I give it five stars based on that alone.
The roles are well acted and the characters are believable.
The story centers around a middle class family with issues that greatly impact their lives.  The characters exhibit courage and love as they resolve and learn to live with things that cannot be changed, and to change the things that they can.

I heartily recommend the movie to those that want to see how a lot of Black people actually live.  The movie has no buffoonery, no shucking or jiving.
The movie is about a family of love and is not suffused with anger and negative emotions.  NO angry Black women - no Black men stuck on rage as their only reaction to the problems of life.

The movie is also clean and can be seen by all ages.  It is thought provoking. It is not for those seeking mindless entertainment.

Robert Townsend has done an excellent job and the movie was well worth the money that I spent for it.",1318809600,2,1079,4.386934673366834

4267933,5,B0046GDMV8,"WOW. This film was so inspiring for a few reasons.  One, it was a quality, uplifting, movie about an African American father -- so rare to see in film.  Second, it offered reassurance to me and hope, that just because I am grieving long, that does not make me unusual.  So much of what this father illustrated in grief, I'm struggling with.  It was so refreshing not to have heard God's name trashed in this film, as seems to be the norm by actors these days.  Very powerful.  Thank you Amazon.",1314835200,11,494,4.373626373626373
4267934,5,B0046GDMV8,I enjoyed this movie; it was easy to watch and understand the characters.  I enjoyed Robert Townsend's interpretation of the husband and father.  I like his strength and his frailty.  I would be willing to watch it again.,1310947200,5,221,4.7631578947368425
