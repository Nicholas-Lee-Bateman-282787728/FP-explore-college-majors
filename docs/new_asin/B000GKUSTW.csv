8133317,5,B000GKUSTW,"Yes India is poor and officials are mostly corrupt, but there are several great people who work under extreme hardships to dispense their duty, and fight for truth and justice. The bhagalpur blindings are very controversial. Some human rights chaps had genuine concerns about balancing punishment and human rights, but there are several sleezy Arundhati Roy types who needlessly vilified some brave police officers who had the take extreme steps to bring crime under control. I am not an expert on the facts of the case and will not comment whether the movie represnts reality. I will comment on the movie on the assumption that it is based on facts. Does an honest police officer have a choice given such dire circumstances. But doesnt meting out brutal punishment a slippery slope? Interesting questions. I loved the movie because I am a huge Ajay Devgan fan.

Being raised in India amidst corruption, brutality, squalor I have seen how ordinary folks ( like the police office of this movie) make huge ethical decisions every minute - people tell small lies to save the big truth. When I sit in MBA classes in the US and listen inane fetid professors lecture on corporate ethics etc, it makes me laugh and cry at the same time.

Some people in the US ( and of course in other parts of the world) have made a living out of crying about genuine or alleged violation of rights. There are of course several great genuine human rights activists who who balanced views and do recognize the severe constraints that law enforcements officials work under, and the challenging conditions and low pay of their profession. The latter type of acttivists have my utmost respect, the former my lowest contempt.

Anyways back to the movie - it does have its weak points, but overall a good attempt to depict the troubles of Bhagalpur - I only hope the depiction was real, and in fact no innocents were needlessly punished.",1272758400,,1908,4.775757575757575
