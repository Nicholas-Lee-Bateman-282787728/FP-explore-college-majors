8676844,3,B00NAQDW60,"While this is touted as the best Israeli comedy ever, the jokes are not all that funny.  The humor is very obvious and predictable.  The situations are the kind of silly scenes you might have found in a 1950's or 60's American sitcom.

On the other hand, I actually bought these as an aid to learning Hebrew.  With both Hebrew and English subtitles, I find these very helpful in studying colloquial Hebrew.",1464998400,2,406,4.597222222222222
