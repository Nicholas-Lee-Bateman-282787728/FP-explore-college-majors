8428020,5,B004FN27F4,"This was a very informative and entertaining - if somewhat dramatic - program about the Eastern European front in World War II. The best part is the interview with King Michael of Romania, one of only two surviving heads of state from that war, a war hero, a good person and the monarch who works so hard for the Romanian people. The people love him and want him, and the monarchy, back in Romania.",1396396800,,398,4.391891891891892
