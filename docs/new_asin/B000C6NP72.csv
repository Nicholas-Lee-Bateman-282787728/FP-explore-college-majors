2453316,4,B000C6NP72,"This movie is as campy as camp gets, it's a B-Movie pure and simple. That's what makes it great and a lot of fun to watch. Anyone who watches the trailer or looks at the movie poster should have an idea of what to expect imo

The acting, the script, the effects, the production quality are all reminiscent of the Roger Corman classics we all (well some of us including me) loved from the 60's 70's.

These are not films you critique, these are films you plop down with a bag of popcorn and few drinks and have some laughs and escape for awhile.

I give the film 4 Stars because I believe it accomplishes exactly what it intended to do and be...many, many films touted as ""A"" films with 10x the budget miss that mark.

This is a fun romp of a film, you don't try to make sense of it...you just sit back and roll with it ;)

That all said, B-Movies are not for everyone. You need a sense of humor and the ability to suspend critical thinking for a few hours. And remember, it's not hard to make a bad film...what IS hard is making a bad film that's fun to watch!

So enjoy the camp, enjoy the schlock, enjoy the 80s nostalgia and beach fun!

Then Evils of the Night will be a night & a movie to remember!

Regards & Happy Viewing :)

2453317,1,B000C6NP72,"Evils of the Night (Mardi Rustam, 1985)

This is another one of those movies where you find yourself asking ""how on Earth did the people who made this movie talk these actors into doing this?"" Not because the movie is inherently bad--it is, but producers, directors, and casting agents talk marginal actors into doing bad movies all the time--but because the quality of the actors, as a ratio to the quality of the film, is stunning.

A group of aliens (in what looks like a Toyota Corolla without wheels) come to earth and take over a hospital on an island known for summer-break partying. They need platelets from young humans in order to elongate their own lifespans. To this end, the aliens, headed by Drs. Kozmar (John Carradine) and Zarma (Julie Newmar), recruit two local mechanics, neither of whom has much in the way of brains, Fred (Aldo Ray) and Karl (Neville Brand in his final screen appearance, the poor guy). The rest of the movie is your basic Friday the 13th ripoff. One of the kids is played by Tina Louise, the rest by actors who'd either never worked before, worked only in this movie, or, in one memorable case, was trying to make the jump from porn to mainstream (Amber Lynn has a minor role); who do you think survives the rather banal carnage?

Rustam--who never directed another big-screen feature (for obvious reasons)--seemed unsure whether he wanted to make a softcore film or a horror film, and the end result doesn't do either very well. There's a rather surprising amount of full frontal nudity for a film made twenty years ago and given an R rating; one wonders if they traded the nudity off for anything remotely resembling realistic gore effects. There's a relatively early scene where we see a splatter of red on a wall, and it turns out to be Ray painting the wall red. Unfortunately, the movie's special-effect blood never does look much more real.

Basically, if I'd seen this when it came out, while I was still in my teen years, I'd have probably been mad over it. (Badly) simulated sex, (obviously) ersatz violence, and a real, honest-to-goodness porn star. Now, though, it hasn't aged at all well, and wasn't terribly fresh to begin with. *",1184025600,9,2182,4.704188481675392

2453319,1,B000C6NP72,"This film had so many internal plot faults as to make it very annoying.

John Carradine is the cheif alien. Julie Newmar looks bored in her role.",1154131200,8,367,4.6461538461538465
2453320,2,B000C6NP72,"Probably the best thing about this DVD release of Evils of the Night (1985) is the wonderfully sleazy and ridiculously lurid cover art which, by the way, was also used to promote the film during its original, theatrical release.  It's also interesting to note the artwork, at least on some of the posters, was slightly different than what you're seeing on the DVD case, specifically in terms of the woman portrayed and her overdeveloped flesh globes, the element missing here being a pair of oversized nubbins proudly pointing upward, straining to break free of the woman's flimsy top.  Produced, directed and co-written by Mardi Rustam (Psychic Killer, The Bad Bunch, Eaten Alive), the movie features, in no particular order, Aldo Ray (The Violent Ones, The Green Berets), Julie Newmar (""Batman""), John Carradine (Hillbillys in a Haunted House, The Astro-Zombies), Tina Louise (""Gilligan's Island""), and Neville Brand (Stalag 17, Eaten Alive) in his very last role.  Also appearing is Karrie Emerson (Chopping Mall), Bridget Holloman (Stoogemania), Tony O'Dell (The Karate Kid, ""Head of the Class""), and adult film star Amber Lynn (Hot Tails, Poonies, In and Out in Beverly Hills).

The movie opens with a spaceship arriving on Earth, followed by some soft core action as various individuals get it on during the night in some woods by a river...some stuff happens, at least one person gets murdered (I think), and now we're in a hospital as two women dressed in truly ridiculous space outfits are wheeling a gurney with one of the kids from the woods.  As the two alien orderlies start fondling each other (seriously), the kid decides this a good a time as any to escape.  Passing an open doorway he sees three individuals, whom we later learn are named Dr. Kozmar (Carradine), Dr. Zarma (Newmar), and Cora (Louise), babbling on about something.  The kid makes his way outside, but not much further than that as he finds himself on the wrong end of an alien power ring.  Now it's daytime and we're back on the beach by the river.  There are a whole lot of idiot teens running around engaging in all sorts of shenanigans (check out the topless girl rubbing lotion on the other topless girl...they sure seem to be enjoying themselves).  Night comes and our focus shifts towards five teens...we're now twenty-five minutes into the movie and I still have no idea in hell what's going on...since I ended up sitting through the entire film, I'll just save us both a lot of time and cut to the chase...some vampire-type aliens have come to Earth in need of the blood from youthful individuals, and have enlisted the aid of a couple of trashy, sleazy, moronic mechanics played by Aldo Ray and Neville Brand.  Now here's the funny part...the alien research indicated the spot they're at as ideal for their needs (a small college town) given the large amount of young people present, but said research neglected to relate the fact that it was summer break, and most of the students were gone, leaving behind relatively slim pickings.

First I'll tell you some of the things this movie has...there's nekkid female flesh, fondling, kidnappings, moronic teens, frisky codgers, John Carradine looking pathetic as can be in an incredibly lame silver space suit, Julie Newmar showing off her legs (even at fifty plus years of age Ms. Newmar still had it going on), a haunted house, and deaths by garrote, power drill, chopping axe, laser blast, and brake pad.  Now for the things the movie doesn't have...a discernable plot, decent acting, a cohesive script, a sense of direction, a worthwhile budget, and a reason for being...the movie is broken up into three, basic parts...the first part of the film is all the teenage skin crapola, the second part Carradine, Newmar, and Tina Louise acting like aliens, relating their schemes, and then the third part has Aldo Ray and Neville Brand tormenting the kids along with the bits of gore.  I don't know why the filmmakers didn't just eliminate all the useless alien garbage from the story and create regular characters for Carradine, Newmar, and Louise in a straight up horror tale about two, crazed, murderous auto mechanics terrorizing a bunch of teenagers in a small town.  That would have gone down a lot better than this psuedo sci-fi horror nonsense, but whatever...I'm unsure who edited this thing, but whomever did sure managed to kill any sense of positive flow within the film, the overall effect being that similar to watching a television show and having someone changing the channel every ten minutes or so...looking back on the movie I can't help but wonder if perhaps a good deal of it was made bad on purpose in an attempt at humor, but given some of director Rustam's other projects I think I'd be giving out too much credit if I pushed that idea.  I suppose one could have fun with this film, given two things...they know what they're getting themselves into and second, their expectations are extremely low.  You know, I do appreciate companies (like Shriek Show) out there focusing their attention on independent features like Evils of the Night and making concerted efforts to bring them to DVD, but how about dredging up some decent and worthy ones, along with the slop?  How about working on releases for Night of the Comet (1984), The Bermuda Depths (1978), From Beyond (1986), Crack in the World (1965), or Damnation Alley (1977), or Night of the Creeps (1986) to name a meager few?  Certainly many of these have large enough and dedicated followings to warrant the attention.

This Media Blasters/Shriek Show DVD release features a fullscreen picture format (1.33:1) of the film.  The picture quality is decent, but know there is some grain and a good deal of the film takes place at night and the lighting was less than spectacular during shooting.  The audio, presented in Dolby Digital 2.0 stereo, comes across okay, but again, it's nothing spectacular.  Extras are limited to a small promotional photo gallery (four, count `em four shots), a short, original trailer, and previews for other Shriek Show DVD releases like Shadow: Dead Riot (2006), Death Trance (2005), The Being (1983), and Neighbour No. 13 (2005).

Soon, several of these geniuses are nabbed by masked men, Fred and Kurt (Aldo Ray and Neville Brand!) and taken to a ""hospital"" (aka: alien hideout). Fred and Kurt are paid handsomely for their services by Cora (Louise). Bloody horror occurs. EVILS OF THE NIGHT (aka: DEMON'S NIGHT- 1985) is like two movies in one. The first half is the goofy, cheeezey, soft core movie. The second half is the goofy, cheeezey slasher-ama, w/ aliens standing around. Together, it all becomes a deep-dish, sub-sludge pizza! While Carradine and Newmar weren't given much to do, Tina Louise is actually pretty good in this. In fact, she's the best thing about the whole project!...

2453421,3,B000C6NP72,"I have to admit that I love B-movies, and anything with John Carradine as an alien leader in a silver jumpsuit with tiger stripes has to be worth seeing. If the cast also includes Tina Louise, Julie Newmar, and Aldo Ray, ""Evils of the Night"" must be a potent piece of cinematic cheese indeed. The film opens with typical teenagers being stalked by aliens in the woods; the aliens (Carradine, Newmar, and Louise) want their blood because everyone knows the blood from hormonal human teenagers dramatically increases alien lifespans. The aliens set up shop in an old abandoned hospital and subcontract the teenager abduction to two dimwitted mechanics, Aldo Ray and Neville Brand.

There is a lot of downtime in the film, some of which involves gratuitous skin (Amber Lynn even makes a special appearance!) but some of which just pads the running time (e.g. the scene in the car where two girls can't shut up about Prince Andrew). As the teens are progressively kidnapped and held in the garage, they stage a revolt which eventually involves the misappropriation of a power drill. The fight scenes are exceptionally slow and are frankly boring. I did enjoy the ""shoelaces of death"" scene, and the film slowly devolves into a series of struggles to the death with an ax murder subplot, attempted alien escape, and underwear that looks like a bandana (don't ask). The conclusion is suitably ridiculous and justice is (sort of) done.

Extras include a television version from 1987 which doesn't have Amber Lynn (obviously), some outtakes with no audio (which somewhat defeats the purpose), and a trailer which is pretty funny. The best thing about this DVD is the outlandish cover art which was also used in promotional materials when the film was released, but even that can't totally save a film that is tawdry and intermittently violent, but is also boring in long stretches.

The plot is fairly simple, aliens who look human have paid a pair of bumbling mechanics to bring them young healthy teenagers so they can harvest some sort of chemical from them. Something, they give you the impression, that is vital to the survival of their own kind, and they happen to have a narrow time window in which to retrieve enough of. Now it would also seem that their leaders aren't much more intelligent than the mechanics, who are accepting gold coins for their kidnapping services. So the sex crazed teen victims happen to be vacationing at a lake, and there's plenty of nudity and campy humor to fill in the duller moments between kidnappings. Most aren't actually killed in a bloody or gorey manner, if/when they die it's almost always on the operating table. You'll recognize an aging Ginger from Gilligan's Island as well as an aging Cat Woman from the old school batman show as two of the aliens. Overall not a lot of substance here, but if you like campy, goofy, and a decent amount of nudity, then this not so serious sci fi horror isn't a bad way to pass the time.",1453593600,7,1209,4.475113122171946

The film opens with four overage teenagers at a midnight excursion in the woods enjoying such common things as underwater fellatio and doggie-style sex. They are abducted by a race of aliens (led by Tina Louise, Julie Newmar and John Carradine) who remove their blood platelets which will increase the aliens' lifespans. The aliens set up shop in an abandoned hospital and pay bumbling garage mechanics Neville Brand and Aldo Ray (in career busting performances) gold coins to help them with the abductions. The aliens need 10 people between the ages of 16 and 24 within the next two days to complete their experiments. The grease jockey duo kidnap and hold three teenagers in their garage while they wait for the aliens to contact them. Brand gets horny and tries to sexually assault one of the girls. She fights back and Brand power drills her through the stomach. He goes after the other girl and ends up crushed under an hydraulic car lift. After seeing his buddy lying dead with a bloody sucking chest wound, Ray assaults the poor girl and gets an air hose shoved in his ear by another girl who has escaped from the alien hospital (she shoves it in his right ear and blood spurts out of his left one!). This severely disturbs Ray, who grabs an axe and chops the hospital girl to pieces. The departing aliens kill Ray with a green death ray as payment for a job well done. EVILS contains plenty of gratuitous sex and nudity in its first 30 minutes, but goes for a deep slide after the story kicks in. It's painful to listen to the actors speak such ridiculous line as: Brand: ""I sure would like to hump one of those girls!"" Ray: ""Why not? We've done it before!"" After Newmar finds Louise's head caved in on the hospital floor she utters this immortal line: ""She's been expunged!""

2453440,4,B000C6NP72,"This is easy to follow, low-budget, and is simply a trash flick that you can just turn off your brain and watch. It begins quickly with a spaceship landing, and the purpose of the film is just to keep the film simple with sex, nudity, and violence. It's about some human space aliens who land and take refuge in a hospital. They then recruit a couple of garage mechanics to help them capture humans. The movie was made with a small cast, and it basically takes place in and around the forest; some scenes on the beach and other scenes in and around the woods, and there's some indoor stuff like when some people are tied up and held hostage in a shack and some scenes at the hospital. A lot of the film takes place at night, and I thought that the film was usually fast-paced and lively. The film has a good amount of violence, but it doesn't have a lot of gore overall. I've never read anything about this film being cut to receive an R-rating, but there's a scene when a girl is killed by a drill that looks like it may have been shortened. It made me wonder if there's more to this scene on the original negative. One of the things that's most memorable about the film is that the sexual content is very strong for an R-rated film around the time it was made because this was when the MPAA started censoring a lot of content from horror films like the FRIDAY THE 13TH films. Some women get fully nude, but the film is dark and this makes it difficult to see a lot of full frontal nudity. However, there's some strong sexual stuff and a good amount of nudity. One scene that is worth mentioning is a lesbian type sequence when a couple of topless women are rubbing lotion on each other on the beach; scenes like this weren't the norm for horror flicks around that time. The movie is well scored, has some decent locations, not much suspense, and doesn't provide a lot of effective atmosphere.  I thought the film has a quick pace; the nudity, sex, and violence begin quickly. However, some may not like the directing. This is a very 80s style film, and the film is trashy and cheap. I guess some might describe the directing as amateurish; so if you don't like the way it's directed, then you won't like the film despite the fact that the exploitation starts really early. Another problem some may have is that the characters aren't interesting, so this also may make the film uninvolving.

The DVD quality is a little dark, but everything else is fine. I have the old Shriek Show DVD. There's no interviews or commentaries.",1390262400,6,2526,4.406852248394005

For example, there is a scene where it cuts to a guy looking at two random naked women rub each others breast, then his girlfriend gets mad, pulls out her boobs and proceeds to jiggle them. Then it cuts to random boobs about 60 more times. Naked women are not a spice in this movie, they are the main course and everything else doesn't matter. It's a damn soft-core porn. Just looks at the positive reviews and try to find one that judges the movie by it's cinematic merits and doesn't mention naked ladies.

I give it two stars because it has great picture for an 80's porn spoof and there were a few jokes I chuckled at but I couldn't finish it. The poster is great too, more entertaining than the movie.",1525219200,,1217,4.291304347826087

Lots and of great characters like First Girl Having Sex, First Guy Having Sex and Connie! Other entertaining characters include Bumbling Garage attendants/ vacationing Teen-Traffickers who are possibly seeking immortality from their alien overlords. Contains sex montage of two synchronized horror kill bait couples, one set in a spooky house the other in the woods with bad original 80s songs from the Big Ragoo himself Eddie Mekka! These make the love scenes from the Room seem well executed. Seriously after the music fades the girls asked what was that?  The apparently cash strapped B stars, seem to have all of their scenes shot at once almost as unrelated to the rest of the picture as an Ed Wood picture. Once the Aliens cut bait to run after the baffling garage abduction climax, I guess they are trying to cover their tracks or end the movie because like a complete afterthought their retreating ship backfires some lazer bolts that kill the remaining henchman. And we know for sure that he is dead because the badly looped penultimate bit of dialogue in which an oversexed survivor says He bled to death.

Fans of serious horror and gore will be disappointed (because there is none). Fans of comedy and ""camp"" will be disappointed (because there's nothing to laugh at, intentionally OR unintentionally). There's NO redeeming value here. Even the beginning, which is overloaded with nudity, fails to titillate because it's so bland and unappealing. Avoid!",1524182400,,508,5.283950617283951
