5792606,5,B00DD0P08G,Awesome learning tool!!!,1409788800,,24,7.333333333333333
5792607,5,B00DD0P08G,This is definitely not a HD video! More like a VHS tape transfer over to DVD.  But for the price and the lessons the DVD is still worth the price. My son already learned the Em chord and I am so proud of him!,1385683200,9,208,3.727272727272727
5792608,5,B00DD0P08G,"My nephew just turned 8 and I decided that this would be a good time to get him familiar with music and learn the fundamentals of guitar.  I expected him to start out slowly and just take a couple lessons at a time, but he zipped straight through this DVD and hes been having a lot of fun with his new found hobby! Hearing him play Mary Had a Little Lamb on the guitar reminded me of when I started playing the piano and I could not be happier with the results of these lessons. If you want a child to start on the right foot in learning guitar this is a really good deal. My only complaint is the video is not the highest quality. Like others have posted it looks like a VHS tape.",1383609600,6,681,4.007352941176471
5792609,5,B00DD0P08G,"My 9 year old son has recently taken an interest in learning to play musical instruments. Unfortunately, he is not in a family of musicians, and we were at a complete loss as to how to help him learn something we never learned. The ""Beginner Guitar Lessons for Kids"" DVD made it all simple for everyone. It's a great step by step guide. It starts at the very beginning with explaining everything that the child needs to know about the guitar itself and how to hold, play, and tune it. Then, it goes into the different chords, and by the end of the DVD, my son was playing ""Mary Had a Little Lamb."" We were so proud of him. This is really a great product.",1379462400,12,654,4.24
5792610,5,B00DD0P08G,"My son had been expressing an interest in learning to play the guitar, but before sending him to expensive lessons, we wanted to make sure he was serious about playing.  We purchased this DVD lesson for him, and I was very pleased with how detailed the instructions were and how easy they were to understand.  He had no issue at all picking up the chords and was even able to tune the guitar himself on the first try. Out of everything, the included song lessons were his favorite part of the whole experience. The material that is included is very complete for this age group, and for the price, you really can't beat what you get.  The video was very well made, however the resolution was a bit grainy, but did not effect the usability at all. I would recommend this video to any parent looking to start their child off with learning about and beginning to play the guitar.",1373932800,7,875,4.45625
5792611,5,B00DD0P08G,"""Beginner Guitar Lessons for Kids"" is an excellent choice for children just embarking on their journey as a guitarist. It well explains the base chords for any guitar player and explains them in such a way that your child could learn from the DVD without instruction from an adult. I know this from experience, as since I've gave it to my daughter five days ago, she's learned four chords and is now progressing towards playing them in harmonic succession. I'd recommend this DVD to anyone who is looking to learn the basics of guitar for a price as cheap as ""Beginner Guitar Lessons for Kids.""",1373760000,3,594,4.666666666666667
5792612,5,B00DD0P08G,"The instructor of the video does a good job with teaching my kids how to learn to play the guitar in words and steps they understood.
He gave step by step instructions to all the basic parts of the guitar and good reviews of what they have learned.  I really liked how he uses colors on your on your fingers to learn the chords of the guitar.  I also liked how he let my kids know that playing the guitar takes practice.
I would recommend the video to every parent who wants their children to learn how to play.  It is an easy and fun video for learning!",1373328000,5,554,4.111111111111111

5792641,3,B00DD0P08G,"my 12 year old daughter thought this was too ""young"" for her and said it would be OK for someone much younger to learn from. I would not recommend it for anyone over probably 9 years old.",1430179200,2,187,4.081081081081081
5792642,1,B00DD0P08G,Did not even play in my dvd player. Very dissapointed! Never had a problem with any dvd not playing before.,1429056000,,107,4.4
5792643,5,B00DD0P08G,"This is an EXCELLENT video for teaching ANYONE who has never played guitar or had other musical experience. They teach parts of the guitar, how to hold it, how to tune it, etc., before going on to lessons on notes, strumming, and chords.  My daughter is enjoying her lessons, and so am I! One quick tip: there is a hand with color coded fingers in the video that helps with finger placement; I bought corresponding finger nail polishes that I put on my daughters fingers and also on the guitar to help her remember, and that technique helped tremendously. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to learn guitar.",1426550400,31,615,4.590909090909091
5792644,4,B00DD0P08G,"My two 1/2 year grandson learned the names of the guitar parts on the first viewingIt was difficult to move through the video as he wantes to see the guitar played and hear the songs, which would have been a motivation factor.
