7944077,4,B00005LMB2,"This OVA is a sequel to ""Graduation,"" but you can watch it without having seen the prequel (I did). The same characters also show up in ""Sailor Victory,"" which is an alternate universe. However, as far as I can tell, there isn't any continuity between these three works. It's just that the same five female friends are reused in different alternate settings.

This disc contains two short (27 minute) romantic comedies, both of which are cute and funny without being profound or deeply memorable. Each of the episodes is mostly self-contained, though the first episode does seem to set up the relationship in the second episode, so it's important to watch them in order. Because of the brevity of the episodes, you shouldn't expect complicated plotting or deep character development. DO expect a quirky sense of humor and some touches of sentimentality that are sweet without being too sweet. In my opinion, the bizarre ""informational"" segments in the middle of each episode are the one thing that really make this anime stand out. They look like parodies of educational videos, and yet, at the same time, seem to be trying to offer serious advice to the viewers or characters. It's odd, but amusing.

I've given this anime four stars, but I really think it is probably about a 3 1/2 star work: entertaining, but not great. If you are in the mood for a couple of short, sweet, and somewhat silly romantic comedies, it's worth giving this anime a shot.",1306540800,,1451,4.8
7944078,4,B00005LMB2,"Ever think about your future?  Ever wonder how or when you're going to meet the man or woman of your dreams?  Ever wonder why people get married.
In Marriage, a group of female friends decide that they are now ready  for the next, important step in their lives.  Settling down and getting  married.  They are comfortable in themselves, in their frienship with each  other, and where they work.
Marriage talks about such issues as why  people get married, how your friends can help you get married, and also  about people simply maturing.
Marriage is a sweet, good anime.  The  subtitling is very well done, and well time.  The voice acting is also very  good (it features some of the best in the business).  The art is smooth,  highly detailed, and full of color.  The music helps to frame the overall  theme of the show, without being obtrusive.  The only real disappointment I  had with this, is it seemed short to me.  Such a romantic topic covered in  some 80 minutes.
Overall, a very romantic, sweet, and mature look at  marriage.  A worthwhile title in your collection.",963273600,4,1075,4.661290322580645
