8347598,5,B001WYHKQK,"This is a film montage, a sweeping documentary of the political movements and personages in the 1960's and 1970's, a stirring and engrossing narrative of those turbulent times. Many of the faces and persons in this film will be unfamiliar to American viewers. This should not be a deterrent to purchasing and viewing this documentary. The film documents events of a very important time politically and socially. 1968 represented the fulcrum of when the post-WWII structure crumbled and fell apart. New political alliances were being made, and many of the post-WWII leaders -- de Gaulle, Nixon, Mao -- either fell from grace or were on the downward path. On one side were the new generation of students, on the other were the establishment political leaders. The urgency of the student leaders are clearly apparent in the film, as is the paralysis of the Old Guard. Stuck in the middle is the working class, divided to whom they should support. In this respect, it does not matter that the student revolts are given a French perspective. The dilemma faced by the world at that time was truly universal.

Chris March -- who passed away recently in July 2012 -- allows the newsreels and the events and persons in the footage speak more or less for themselves. March adopts the approach taken in an earlier film about the Senate McCarthy Hearings, Point of Order, of letting the newsreels tell the story. Here, while there is narrative it is kept to a minimum. The approach to movie-making is exactly similar to another documentary, Malcolm X, which was included as an extra on the two-disc special edition to the Spike Lee movie, X, where while there is narration, the story is told by the subject. The effect is dramatic.

The film is long, 180 minutes, but the viewer will not notice the time passing. The film is divided into two parts. Part I is entitled, ""The Fragile Hands."" It contains archival images from the following:

1. Che Guevara, including interviews from American operatives responsible for assisting the Bolivian government to track and kill Che and his followers.

2. Student demonstrations from Paris, London, Germany, the United States (including images from the Columbia University student demonstrations), but primarily French civil unrest;

3. Vietnam (definitely unembedded);

4. Chicago Democratic Convention demonstrations.

These events are intermixed with the passionate political debate and commentary from French intellectuals, political leaders, and working class members.

The historical figures depicted include momentary images of Salvador Allende; Pinochet; the Shah of Iran; Rudi Dutschke, a leader in the German student movement; Daniel Cohn-Bendit; and Fidel Castro.

Part II is entitled ""The Severed Hands.""

It contains archival footage of the following events:

1. The Russian invasion of Prague. The prominent features of this treatment are the poignant images of young Prague students pleading with their equally young Soviet soldiers to leave the city and a filmed statement of Fidel Castro, who, while giving lip service to his political support of the invasion followed with a vehement denunciation of the illegality of the act.

2. The Mexican Student riots of 1968.

3. The Olympics, Mexico, 1968.

4. China, the Cultural Revolution.

5. The Watergate Hearings.

6. The 1967 March on the Pentagon and subsequent police riot.

7. Paris Student street demonstrations of May 1977.

The historical figures shown include Salvador Allende (prolonged footage of his speeches); Richard Nixon; Jacques Mitterand; George Pompidou; Fidel Castro;

For those unfamiliar with the faces and events, this film should be considered a historical document, an accurate recordation of political events from across the world.

While there were cultural differences, the revolutionary furvor, both in Continental Europe was the same and very evident in this film.

For those who lived during those times or in those events, it will doubtless bring back memories. In either case, it is required viewing.",1354320000,3,4026,5.249609984399376
8347599,5,B001WYHKQK,Lengthy but fascinating look of the political turmoil and drama of the 1960's and into the 1970's. Some very moving scenes for those of us who were around in those days and maybe a pang of regret not to have been active (or more aware and involved) in those events in the United States. The title is somewhat obscure and the cover photo on the DVD makes no sense to me at all. I recommend it in the same way that I would recommend the documentary The Battle of Chile.,1297036800,15,467,4.2
8347600,5,B001WYHKQK,"The old saying- a picture is worth a thousand words- is an apt, more than apt, expression in reviewing this hotchpotch of a film documentary. Why hotchpotch? Well, this two part (on one disc), multi-lingual (in choice of languages to listen in and in the languages spoken in the various segments), three hour documentary exposition originally produced in 1977, of many of the great events of the middle third of the 20th century comes rapid-fire at you in a montage effect. For those who merely want a flavor of those political times (roughly 1960 to 1980) there is enough here to act as a primer, and to whet your appetite for more research of the times. For the political aficionado familiar with the period one has to dig a little to get a sense of the basically social democratic world view that informs the viewpoint behind the production by the filmmaker, Chris Markers. Either way it is an interesting way to spent three hours, although for non-political ""junkies"" perhaps viewing one segment at a time is the better course.

Some of the highlights here are much footage from the anti-Vietnam war struggle as it began to take center stage in the mid-1960s, especially in Europe; plenty of footage of Fidel Castro, Che Guevara (including his death) and the meaning of the Cuban revolution and rural guerrilla warfare for world revolutionary strategy; the then historic May Days actions in Paris in 1968 by both students and workers (together and in opposition to each other); the seminal events in Prague in 1968; Allende's Popular Front Chile in the early 1970s; and, strewn throughout reflections of the 1960s events from about a decade later perspective. Very little material here on the anti-imperialist struggle in America, but the rest more than makes up for it. Kudos on this one.",1279497600,13,1793,4.878688524590164
8347601,5,B001WYHKQK,"Readers who already know Chris Marker well should be very happy to see this essential film on home dvd at last--and will add it to their libraries immediately.  Other readers may know this singular artist through his better known films LA JETEE (the basis of Terry Gilliam's great movie 12 MONKEYS) or SANS SOLEIL. GRIN is much longer and much more historically focused. That said, it is a spectacular documentary by a great artist so what can you say but... HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

Many of Marker's films are documentary memoirs of and philosophical reflections on the radical left's political dreams of the 20th century in the form of refined and at times explosive film-essays. Although certain critics argue otherwise, these are not propaganda or one-dimensional films in that Marker's own political position is obscured through layers of regret, anger, and irony. His is the elegant voice of the revolution's unhappy consciousness. If he wasn't so attached to cats, one might want to call Marker the owl of Minerva. He is often reflecting on the history of revolutionary propaganda and campaigns from a position of sorrow that nothing goes according to plan, not in this vicinity at least.

So, this is a three-hour film essay and careful argument about the rise and fall of the international New Left in the 1960s and 1970s and its later aftermath. Formally, much of it seems to be found news footage, with additional voice-overs, and spare use of music. The film focuses on political and social developments in Marker's home country of France, but follows the ""revolution within the revolution"" elsewhere as well.  Marker uses Regis Debray's New Left phrase to feed his melancholic argument about a revolutionary ""grin without a cat.""  Much attention is paid to developments involving Castro, Che, and Allende  (with lots of great footage of early Castro and Allende), as well as the cultural revolution in China, and the flickering New Left movement in the US. Marker's voice-over ""essay"" is read by a number of fine voices (available in assorted languages on the DVD) and his selection of documentary footage is amazing as always). This film is like a set of essays that you return to time and again to glean new insights or recall terrific turns of phrases, but you get to see the original speakers making their statements in public. Wonderful.

Also highly recommended for use in university classroom, though students will need lots of assistance identifying the many historical figures treated here. My only quibbles: the cover is very misleading (my partner thought it was a new Penthouse video), there should be chapter selections, and there are no extras (not that we would ever expect to see Marker on screen talking about his films). That said, it does come with a nice insert including a short essay by Marker. The film itself is three hours long, and miles deep, so it's certainly well worth the price.",1243641600,42,2918,4.979466119096509
8347602,5,B001WYHKQK,"This is, simultaneously, the best movie I've ever seen and almost totally unwatchable. I know, a complete paradox, I apologize. The first 45 minutes or hour or so are engrossing, then it goes back and forth between being crushingly dull and back to engrossing. It's some kind of work of genius, rent it, watch it, don't get mad at yourself for falling asleep twice, you might emerge thinking that, in spite of all that, it's the best thing you've ever seen.",1242777600,34,457,4.654320987654321
