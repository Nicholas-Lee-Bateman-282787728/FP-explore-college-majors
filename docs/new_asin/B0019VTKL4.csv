3444286,5,B0019VTKL4,"The ""American Experience"" rarely disappoints me, and this is no exception. In my opinion George H W Bush has been wrongly cast aside in comments by political gurus on the effectiveness of recent presidents. Serving in the wake of Ronald Reagan, this is understandable. However, the accomplishments of this good man both before and during his presidency deserve reconsideration in view of our recent history. This film accurately portrays him and should leave the viewer with a renewed sense of his quiet greatness. History will one day look back on his years in the White House with admiration.",1241740800,7,594,5.071428571428571
3444287,5,B0019VTKL4,"I have long had an interest in American history, and especially for notable Presidents.  President Bush was a man I respected after becoming the director of CIA, through his all-to-short presidency, and his continued gracefulness in retirement from politics.  This production by American Experience is very, very well done, and is nothing short of inspiring.  History will treat this President Bush well, and PBS has done him justice.  If you're looking for an inspiring story of a modern-day role model, you might consider this biography of George H.W. Bush.",1227571200,13,559,5.247191011235955

8275409,5,B0019VTKL4,I purchased this DVD along with several others when I homeschooled my children. We watched them over and over  learned so much about our presidents. These programs are a joy to watch!,1485388800,,183,4.71875
8275410,5,B0019VTKL4,A balanced and nuanced portrait of a complex man who was much more interesting and likeable than he appeared to be in public. Your portrayal helped me realize what an important president he was.,1477094400,,194,4.735294117647059

8275412,3,B0019VTKL4,"Good documentry.  Learned a lot.  However, the liberal bias was clear.  For example, did you know the conservative movement was started by racist labor unions in Texas?  I didn't until I watched this.",1419811200,,200,4.96969696969697
8275413,5,B0019VTKL4,"A leader of integrity,  excellent communication skills,  a pride and a sense of the citizens of the USA.  Certainly would like to see one of his stature as a future president to bring people together.",1419552000,,200,4.6571428571428575
8275414,5,B0019VTKL4,This is a very well made documentary. All of the PBS American Experience Presidential biographies are of a high standard and this is no different. A previous reviewer incorrectly stated that there is no mention of the first Gulf War. Perhaps that reviewer should look again at the DVD menu and select Part 2 as apparently she only watched Part 1! Part 2 explores the Gulf War in some detail. I would definitely recommend this DVD to anyone with an interest in Presidential biographies or American politics.,1336867200,,506,4.827586206896552
8275415,2,B0019VTKL4,"This dvd was well made, and was a good American Experience production of an underrated president.  My main issue with this dvd was that it said nothing, NOTHING about the First Iraq War.  I don't understand how you can make a documentary about a president, who is to be the nation's commander in chief for the military and not say anything about the biggest military action of the 90's under Bush Sr.
  I couldn't imagine talking about FDR and not WWII, LBJ and not Vietnam, or Wilson and WWI, but we can talk about George Bush Sr. and not talk about Operation Desert Storm; it's almost like they wanted to ignore it, as if to avoid it.
  This is  a major failure of this video!  If you are looking for a full story of this president watch something else.",1334966400,4,755,4.381294964028777
8275416,4,B0019VTKL4,"George H. W. Bush was the last of the decent politicians who genuinely cared about people, his country and wanted to be the President because he believed in public service. This documentary is a bit long winded, but it covers George Bush's life from his birth to his retirement. I will always be appreciative of his role in ending the Cold War and the fact he nevered gloated about the U.S. and the West winning.",1330387200,,412,4.506666666666667
8275417,4,B0019VTKL4,First of i am a very loyal dem. i was 18 when Bush Sr was elected president in 1988 and i voted against him that year for Dukakis and in 1992 for Clinton. That aside after buying this dvd off amazon.com and watching it i appreciate him more.  he was a war hero in ww 2 all they way. he even went against his gop leanings to work with the dems in congress at times at the rage of conservatives in his party. He did what he thought was right.  now does that mean i would have voted for him back then in hindsight? nope not really. but i give props to pbs for a great insight of his life. His son W. is another matter entirely(eyeroll). but that is another review.,1280448000,4,661,4.0
