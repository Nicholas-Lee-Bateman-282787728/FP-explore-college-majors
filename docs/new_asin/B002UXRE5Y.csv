8381568,4,B002UXRE5Y,I am quite happy with this DVD. It lives up to its promise of giving an overview. I have the Balciki tapes which show a lot of technique and this dvd helped me understand that one even better. It could have been longer but I think it is a fair amount of the material for the price. The qaulity of the packaging and the menus are also quite good.,1442966400,,345,4.0144927536231885
