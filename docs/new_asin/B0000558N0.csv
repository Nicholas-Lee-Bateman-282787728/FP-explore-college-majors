The film begins with a song. Wyoming was great pastureland for cattle. ""Champion"" gets billing. Note the reference to taxes in Texas. An oil well can contaminate the streams so its unfit drink for man or beast. ""I don't know how to change a tire."" ""Bring the car to the radio station."" Will finding oil benefit the community? Smiley pays for lunch. The radio station is over the lunch room. [Who owns it?] Later Doris Maxwell drives to deliver the payroll but is robbed. Gene Autry rides up and stops the robbers. We learn about the robbery plot. Banker Maxwell has a cash flow problem, and the bank examiner is coming soon. Will the shortage be explained by a robbery? The townsmen chase the fleeing horses.

If they strike oil the railroad will build a branch line and this will benefit the ranchers. Autry is kidnapped to keep him from the rancher's meeting, bu he escapes in time. They don't want the oil well! But if it brings a railroad the ranchers won't take the losses of a long trail drive. The ranchers buy shares in the oil company. There is a sing-along for entertainment. Then comic relief. [The point is how a community can work together for their betterment.] Logan's gang has new plans. The ""Cabin Kids"" sing a song. Autry sings again. Agents provoke the people against Autry. The Sheriff wants to arrest him, but he escapes! They pursue to no avail.

Autry finds Sam Brown, who tells him about the oil well. All they need is dynamite to bring the oil up. Autry is chased again and again. The dynamite is dropped down the shaft. There is more drama when Logan's men show up for a fight scene. The explosion brings in a gusher. The bad guys will be sent away. The oil (black gold) will enrich the people. Happy days are here again!

This western movie is an example of a ""horse opera"" with drama and singing as part of a story. The idea of a community getting rich must have been a dream for people in rural towns.",1275350400,,1966,4.467966573816156

If you compare it to todays entertainment one would probably give it one or two stars, but you have to put yourself back when movies were in their infancy.  The movies back then never allowed the vulgar language and the disgusting sceens that they do today.",1439164800,,342,4.5
