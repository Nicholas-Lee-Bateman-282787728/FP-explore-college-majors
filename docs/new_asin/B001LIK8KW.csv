8318126,1,B001LIK8KW,"Ugh. I won't waste your time with even bothering to point out all the many flaws in this video... Suffice to say this thing is just boring, boring, boring. Avoid it and keep looking...

C-movie, no budget, weekend shoot. Though they did land the guy from the old Twisted Sister video :)",1419379200,2,286,4.5
8318127,1,B001LIK8KW,Boring. Horrible acting. A waste of money.,1419033600,,42,5.142857142857143
8318128,1,B001LIK8KW,"I like to think I'm a reasonably intelligent human being, but I could not make sense of this movie. It's like someone put three or four unfinished zero budget ghost movies in a blender and then threw it in your face. The movie is just a series of unrelated scenes. Maybe it's some kind of art film disguised as a horror movie. We just don't know!",1418860800,3,346,4.257575757575758
8318129,1,B001LIK8KW,One of the worst movies I've ever watched. It moved so incredibly slow and took way too long to get to any point. It's not even worth watching for free. Find some other way to spend your time and money,1417996800,2,201,4.05

8318131,2,B001LIK8KW,"I'm all for nonlinear storytelling when it results in a great movie like Eraserhead or Pulp Fiction. But nonlinearity is not an excuse for just throwing your scenes together in a way that doesn't serve the story. There are some really strong, disturbing horror images and an impressive atmosphere of foreboding, which is why I'm giving this more than one star, but I really would advise you to stay away from this because it's basically just an incomprehensible pile of wasted efforts.",1415232000,3,485,4.926829268292683
8318132,5,B001LIK8KW,This is one of several movies I bought with a 'Wisconsin' theme or setting (Filmed in Wisconsin if applicable). I'm very pleased with my purchase of this addition to my collection. Happy buyer.,1407628800,2,193,4.878787878787879
