3665634,4,B001KEGR8E,"I really like this play I was a little sceptical because of other plays were crazy.  But this was good.  It had a lot of stories going on at once, and it kinda leaves you hanging at the end, and some of the scenes were longer than they needed to be.  But anyway it was a good story though.  Check it out, I recomend it.",1239753600,,319,3.8615384615384616
3665635,5,B001KEGR8E,"This is a crack your side production.  My jaws were hurting laughing at this crazy play.  The acting was very believable.  The cast had good chemistry.  I am a stageplay buff, I've followed them for years.  I am a fan of Shirley Murdock, Jackee' Harry, Christopher Williams, but that Steve Vaughn I have to say, when he sung that high note it sent shockwaves through my TV screen.  I have seen him in plenty of things but this one he let loose.  This DVD is a MUST HAVE.  It's CRAZZZZZY!!!!!!!!",1238889600,,494,4.411111111111111
3665636,5,B001KEGR8E,"The play was hilarious, the acting was very good.  I enjoyed Shirley Murdock she has an incredible voice and Clifton Powell always deliver a strong performance.  I have to mention Steve Vaughn, I've seen Steve Vaughn in a number of productions over the years, but this time I seen a side to his acting and singing that has made me a true fan.  Get the DVD, you are sure to laugh.",1238889600,,379,4.309859154929577
3665637,5,B001KEGR8E,"Pretty good play that is funny, yet serious.  No real surprises to the story, however, good acting.",1236297600,2,99,4.823529411764706
3665638,5,B001KEGR8E,"This stage play is a feel-good, must-see! Many twists and turns along the way, along with pleasant...and not-so pleasant surprises. This play kept me tuned in the whole way through. A very unexpected twist which shocked me since usually as the audience we can see things coming.

The cast is phenomenal. Very good acting. No over-the-top circus shenanigans. Many crack-your-side moments! Good storyline.",1234742400,7,403,5.396825396825397

3665643,2,B001KEGR8E,"This play is far from excellent. The plot is fairly predictable, some of the acting was not all that good, the singing and music at points was atrocious and honestly the whole thing wasn't very entertaining. I admit there are good messages and it did have its moments but overall it was still pretty bad",1407456000,,303,4.527272727272727

3665646,4,B001KEGR8E,"I bought this play because I wanted to try something other than Tyler Perry's work.  It was fun to watch.  I was disappointed with the singing, but the overall story was good.  I would recommend this play to someone looking for a fun time.",1299369600,,239,4.386363636363637
3665647,4,B001KEGR8E,"This was a great play, kept you watching all through the end. Jackee was funny, dave holister and Christopher williams played great roles. Buddy Lewis was funny as hell BUT the best was Drew Sidora she was great.",1282694400,,212,4.605263157894737
3665648,4,B001KEGR8E,"Wow!  I caught this screening on TV [BET] by accident - - scanning the TV one day for something good to watch.  This was for sure a treat.  Clifton Powell/ D. Hollister/Jackee' et. al.  Wonderfully done, wonderfully done.  Relevant to today on many fronts.

Thanks to all who put it together from the Executive Producers, to the finaciers, to all the actors.  It was an 'All My Children' feature-play for sure.  I loved it! !",1272153600,,425,4.573333333333333

3665651,4,B001KEGR8E,"I really enjoyed this play, good comedy lines, however, I did not like the way it ended.  The ending left too much open, questions that needed to be answered.  I really hope there will be a Part 2.",1256083200,,197,4.157894736842105
3665652,4,B001KEGR8E,"This is one of my fav.stage plays to date. It has a great message behind it and is very funny as well as entertainment. I was sort of disappointed b/c I was able to see the play live and the dvd is kind of different. All in all, it's good though.",1254873600,2,246,3.843137254901961
3665653,5,B001KEGR8E,"This is a very exciting play! It keeps your attention, not boring at all. All of the characters are interesting. Many times we think the grass is greener on the other side or try to burn the candle at both ends and end up with nothing,what ashame! You never know what a person may become! Judging a person on the outside or what they may have is not the best policy to go by.",1251590400,,375,4.081081081081081

3665657,3,B001KEGR8E,"It was not the best play I have seen but it was decent, it got deep towards the end which I really enjoyed. Overall I would recommend it (I didn't really enjoy the songs none really matched the scenes and the singers seemed to try too hard to impress which was not impressive)<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Man-of-Her-Dreams/dp/B001KEGR8E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Man of Her Dreams</a>",1245196800,2,426,6.237288135593221
3665658,2,B001KEGR8E,"Not sure where the ball was dropped on this one, but it dropped. It became quite predictable about 30 minutes in. And it seemed to me as if the storyline was drawn out way too long.",1243814400,2,181,4.055555555555555

8314881,5,B001KEGR8E,It was a great movie and I continue to enjoy the Urban Movie Channel station.  They have so many great movies and I highly recommend the gospel plays shown!  The movie had a gospel twist to it which enhances the movie so much!,1481155200,,226,4.232558139534884

8314887,1,B001KEGR8E,This was horrible...I felt as if I were watching a middle school play...bad acting. The plot was predictable and yet still hard to follow from scene to scene...the dialog to song transitions were awkward and the casting was bad...most of the cast were not age appropriate for the character...40 and 50 year olds playing 20 and 30 year old characters and the grandmother looks younger than the actress playing her daughter...,1428278400,,424,4.985915492957746
