The video direction is excellent, with carefully thought out camera moves and angles that enhance the experience.

Got this first on regular dvd then upgraded to blue ray and I have to say it's night and day in comparison. The high definition blue ray  is much more detailed and sharper including the sound is more vibrant on blue ray!

The Rockettes do so many wonderful dances some new and
some iconic. I truly enjoyed watching and experiencing the beauty of the
program. We gave this CD to the Mother of a friend who was a Rockette in the 40's.

It was like a long, unsophisticated, pandering and repetetive commercial for the Rockettes.  The camera/editing style reminds me of a Miss America pageant.  Lots of kicking, zooming from one end of the theater to another, overly slick production with big toothy smiles.  Lots of zooming in on ""awestruck"" children and parents. The production completely lacked sincerity and smacked of how to make a buck off of Christmas.

On the other hand the good thing is that this $10 DVD saved me hundreds of dollars.  After seeing 15 minutes of this, I now know that I will never bother with purchasing tickets to watch the live Radio City Christmas show in NYC.",1387152000,,758,4.696969696969697

The Rockettes and other performer work in front of a LED video screen for quick scene changes. There are many quick cuts to faces in the crowd that enhace the feeling of ""being there"" While living the the NYC area back in the 1950s I was a great fan of the Radio City shows, the Rockettes, the Ballet and the Symphony. I saw a traveling ""Spectacular"" show a few years ago but it only had about ten Rockette dancers. I also have a  copy of the old  ""Spectacular"" DVD but was really disappointed with the video quality and the 4X3 aspect ratio used. Get this Bluray version!

3525541,3,B001D395NG,"It's hard to give a lukewarm review to a production this good, but the way you're forced to view it has to pointed out. I tried to watch this film and was going nuts trying to SEE what was going on! It was edited in the rat-a-tat style you expect for the trailer of a Bruce Willis ""Die Hard"" film. It's as if the director was so afraid the show was boring, he (she?) felt it necessary to cut to a new shot, or a close up, or a zoom, or a dolly shot as frequently as possible. At first, I thought this was just for the introduction, that things would slow down. Nope. It never slowed down. And the audience shots; billions of them. This has become standard in filming live performances of everything, now, other than concerts by the Berlin Philharmonic!  Yes, it's a great show, I just wish the camerawork didn't get in the way of seeing it. My advice to the would-be Kubricks out there with their twitchy over-the-top machine gun editing fixation: it's not a personal style if everyone is doing it. If you're going to smoke crack, don't edit concert footage.",1355875200,,1058,4.370558375634518

The DVD does an excellent job of imparting the spirit and wonderful dancing of the Rockettes. The actual show is not that long (about 90 minutes) and the DVD covers just about everything. The Rockette numbers are interspersed with some singers, ice skaters, and a little drama from Santa Claus. Wonderful family viewing.",1326412800,,446,4.730769230769231

However, each shot lasts about 1 second, so I never get a true view of what the dancers are doing, there is no continuity, and eventually I started to get a headache.

3525555,1,B001D395NG,"i've worked in live remote television production for over 20 years, and the on-line director of this production was clearly more interested in making as many cuts as possible than she was in allowing the audience to actually view what was happening on the stage during this christmas spectacular.  i've seen it in person, and i, like another reviewer, was ill after seeing so many shots of people in their 3-d glasses.  overall impression: combine too many shots of the audience, excessive cutting between cameras so as not to be allowed to see the choreography, & excessive use to the jib cam (talk about motion sickness) = not worth it.  i gave up within a few minutes.  even my 7 year old was disgusted.  i, too, am glad i didn't pay for this.",1324857600,4,746,4.578947368421052

Unfortunately, the editing is way too active, shot after shot after shot, most of which are missing the overall impression the choreography and staging were intended to create.  After about the fifth shot of the audience in 3D glasses, I gave up.  Sure glad I didn't pay to rent this, though I suppose it would be enjoyable enough if you just have it on for background.",1324598400,16,411,4.527027027027027
3525558,4,B001D395NG,"I watched this mainly as a time filler recently, because it was free to watch via our Amazon Prime membership.

The quality of the streaming video is not very sharp, thus the reason I docked it a point. Outside of that, it is a quite entertaining show. The dancing is top notch ... when these girls break unison its a rare shock ... they are spot on. The singing is on key and enjoyable. There are some nice numbers for younger children to enjoy, great dancing for Moms to enjoy, and (ahem) plenty of legs for Dads to enjoy. ;-)

I'm not sure this would top my list of ""must see"" Christmas entertainment every year, but it was certainly an entertaining diversion, and I'm sure that watching it live in the theater would have been a great experience. I had the opportunity to see the Rockettes live on one of my long ago visits to NYC, and its a show I still remember fondly.

I probably wouldn't be moved to buy a DVD of this show, but its certainly worth the price of a rental if you don't have Prime, and its a no-brainer for Prime members to take advantage of its availability.",1324512000,,1080,4.310344827586207

the director of this video should have kept the cameras directed at the stage, stop with the difeerent angles and the audience faces this should have been recorded from a center Orchestra seat view point and the shots of the faces of the rockettes were dumb . they are a precision dance team show the complete routine from the audience view point not from the side or back",1321401600,,855,4.0773809523809526

So, I'll keep this review brief, adding yet another 5 STARS and sharing some photos in CUSTOMER IMAGES.

After 75 years, The Rockettes' signature eye high kicks and precision choreography is now like a well oiled machine.  Sometimes you have to remind yourself that this is a real performance, by real people - not computer-generated imagery!

I enjoyed watching everyone's favorite - the Christmas toy soldier come to life in  'Parade of the Wooden Soldier'.  My favorite part is when Wooden Soldiers 'fell down' like dominoes after the 'cannon' shot the word 'BANG' taking them down!  'Parade of the Wooden Soldier' is the Rockettes in perfect harmony!  Truly awesome!

The more somber 'Let Christmas Shine' is indeed a 'heartfelt message of hope and love' by The Rockettes.  Dressed in silver and flesh colored outfits, they looked really smart!

The Rockettes' whirlwind tour on a double-decker bus 'visiting' Manhattan, Times Square and Central Park is a nicely done dance routine creating the essence of Christmas in 'The Big Apple'.  The Rockettes end their 'tour' with their signature kicks singing 'It's Christmas Time Again In New York City' - the girls in smart white costumes trimmed with red and green looked tastefully gorgeous!

My favorite on this DVD is 'The Twelve Days of Christmas' by Santa.  This 75th Anniversary Diamond Celebration is a must for your Holiday DVD Collection!

The Rockettes are an iconic part of Christmas.  This DVD would make a great 'Stocking Stuffer' - buy this 75th Anniversary DVD in lieu of Christmas Cards this holidays!

RUNNING TIME: 80 minutes
AUDIO: 2.0 Stereo
VIDEO: Widescreen

NOTE TO TIME WARNER INC:  I must admit, the video quality of this 2007 DVD is quite good.  It's a pity that this 'Radio City Christmas Spectacular' was never released on blu-ray.  The Rockettes would be magical in full 1080p Hi Def and Dolby DTS HD!  Take this bit of advice 'Time Warner' and re-release  'Radio City Christmas Spectacular' on Blu-Ray.  I would love to hear the Rockettes tap dancing to 'The Twelve Days of Christmas' with the audio in Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound!

RECOMMENDED: To see New York at Christmas with Holiday music as the audio track, then this DVD -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Christmas-In-New-York/dp/B00066X9V0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Christmas In New York.</a>&nbsp;is a must have for your collection!",1290297600,,2731,5.7004950495049505

I bought the video direct from Time-Life which was offering a 'twofer' with another Christmas-time video called 'Christmas in New York' - a 90 minute tour of all the Christmas decorations and Christmas related sites in the city, accompanied by a nice arrangement of uplifting xmas music.

3525576,5,B001D395NG,"A wonderful television rendering of the annual show performed every year on the Great Stage in Manhatten.  As much a part of Christmas in New York as the Rockefeller Center Tree.  This disc is extra special to me, because it is the exact show that I was able to witness live in my visit to New York.  As a matter of fact, a revised extremely edited version of the show aired on NBC the night I was at the show.  The show incoroporates it's contribution to the New York holiday tradition, and offers a tour of the great city, which was like a whirlwind look I had experienced earlier in the weekend visit.  From there it has a wonderful Santa fantasy piece allows a pair of young New Yorkers looking for some true Christmas spirit to be whisked off to the North Pole.  Of course through the entire show hosted by the jolly old elf himself, the world famous Rockettes dance the night away with their high kicking precision.  Two major highlights is the Rockettes famous rendering of the March of the Wooden Soldiers that absolutely sends chills down the spine.  And eqaully impressive live Natvity that wraps the show with the real reason for our celebrating every December 25.  The performance I saw was my second if I include seeing a touring show edition a couple years previously.  If you have ever seen the marvolous show on the Great Stage or on tour, you will find this a great moving scrapbook of the exeperience. If you have never seen the show live, you owe it to yourself to check this out for the virtual experience.  Either way it will be an amazing addition to your holiday season for year's to come.",1287792000,,1612,4.486301369863014

I first got to know about Christmas Spectacular only a couple years ago when I visited NY.
I toured the Radio City Music Hall and met one of the Rockettes.
It was only a shame that it'd be difficult for me to watch the show alive or broadcasted because I don't live in the States.
When I heard the news about the release of this DVD, I was so grateful and excited. :-)
I watched it over and over, and still it's so thrilling to see those eye-high-kicks and line dances done in unison.
I recommend it to anyone who've ever saw the show or who've ever heard about it and never had a chance to see (like me).
It's a KEEPSAKE.",1265673600,,666,4.2109375
3525581,1,B001D395NG,I was informed that this item was shipped on Dec 10.  It was going to an elderly friend who is housebound.  I was going out of town so I wanted to make sure it got there before Christmas.  I checked periodically if he'd received it and he hadn't.  I waited till after the last date on the shipping window info given as to a delivery date before making an inquiry.  I did get a quick response back and was told that a search was being made with the post office.  I inquired again about a week later and was told the same thing.  Since then I have not heard anything back with each inquiry including asking what the protocol was for items not received.  It's now over a month since my first inquiry and it's as if they fell off the face of the earth.  All I'd really want is that the item be received by the person I had it sent to.  Their initial quick response was very good but the lack of any further information or follow up means that I'll make sure I won't order from them again.  I still would just like the money back if it's no attempt is made to get the item to him.  So much for a Merry Christmas for him.

3525596,3,B001D395NG,"75th anniversary DVD could be better. I've seen the show several times and various productions, in NY and traveling shows. Here's what was missing: Rockettes in their famous santa suits and the full on pageantry of the living Nativity. The DVD live Nativity number was the shortest I've ever scene. I'm just saying, for the 75th anniversary they should have gone all out. Now, what could be lessened: the way too many shots of the audience's faces. A few children's excited faces would be a nice touch once or twice, but through the entire production?
The producers of the DVD should have taken more time to plan & really, really showcase 'The Christmas Spectacular'. If you don't plan on seeing the show live, the DVD will do nicely.",1262217600,,734,4.7421875

Their 75th Anniversary production was glittery and magical and filled with those 70+ dancing girls all 'hoofing' it up as my grandfather would have said.  The dvd is well-done, though one would have like there to be extras, like interviews with cast, rehearsals, backstage views, perhaps a retrospective history of radio city would have been nice?  You also don't hear a peep out of the majestic Radio City Music Hall organ which is also disappointing (I once had a friend who used to play it back in the 1980's).

Dull listless performances. Only little children in audience seemed to enjoy this show.
there is nothing in the show that is exciting,performers seemed bored.
Only interesting  actors  were two boys, brothers -older one is cynical  and thinks Santa is just an old phony--while his younger brother is entranced by the magic of the holiday and believes Santa is real-needless to say that by end of the show the older boy becomes a true believer in the magic of Christmas and give the -M.C-Singing-., Santa, a great big hug.

Obviously the director and editor were cutting this piece with no concept of what a live theater experience is! This DVD fails to capture the visual patterns of the choreography and staging.  The mix of constant shot changes, close ups, then the too many cutaways to the audience, made this product unbearable to watch. The Christmas Spectacular should not be edited as a MTV music video. The intricate choreography of the March of the Wooden Soldiers is totally lost! Constant and ever changing close ups of the Rockettes, is not what this show is about! Show me the entire stage picture. I want to appreciate the complexity of the staging! Next time I attempt to watch this with my kids, I will take some motion sickness meds!",1260921600,11,1079,4.590673575129534

There are only a few shots of the audience, and this makes me feel like I'm sitting there, too.

Also, I watch about 5 DVDs a day in my line of work, and this DVD fills up my big screen TV almost entirely, with just a small bar on the top and the bottom of the TV. The format ratio does not disrupt my viewing pleasure at all.

The audio and video quality are top-notch and the dancing is, of course, superb.  I have a feeling this will be part of our annual things to watch during the holidays.  We watched the whole show twice just this year.

The only thing that I had a hard time with was that the video angles kept changing so sometimes it was hard to get a feel for what the whole group was doing.  I thought that detracted a bit from the well-choreographed and performed numbers.  But, I did get more accustomed to the changing angles as the show progressed.

If you have seen the filmed productions of 'Cats' or 'Into The Woods',you probably noticed thatthe camera focused on the production...and we got to see the entire performances...
However, Ego brain never allowed the camera to focus on a dance routine or a singer for longer than five seconds without switching focus..He would pull the camera away so we saw more of the theater than the show..
I know no one who goes to the theater to watch the 'audience'...but Captain Ego showed as much of the audience as he did the show...

I've never been one into those quick action, quick editing of shows (tv, movies, cartoons) where you blink and the scene has changed, or the scene changed four times before your next blink.  Though this DVD isn't badly edited like ""Armageddon""(sp?), it's the same type of editing that I don't like. Other than that, it's basically the same show except we didn't have 3D glasses, and I don't remember seeing the two ice skaters that we saw live. It's a good dvd, the kids renacted the Nutcracker Suite scenes, and of course, the falling toy soldiers scene that is classic Rockettes. I've bought this for a couple of friends already.

I couldn't believe that I wasn't able to get this DVD to fill up my TV screen.  Since my Blu Ray player is relatively new, the first thing I thought was that there was an adjustment that I was not aware of and went to Best Buy to ask for help.  When the doubting salesperson put the disc on the in-store system, we were both amazed that it was,indeed, produced in a 4x3 matted version, leaving a good deal of black around all four edges.  I then went to the store that I bought it in and asked if there was a problem in the first pressing.  The sales person gave me a totally blank stare and said that no one had complained.  My next step was to call the phone number listed on the back cover.  The Time-Life rep who took the call was very polite and offered me a replacement DVD but didn't really know what I was talking about since, ""There have been no complaints"". I then went back to Barnes and Nobel and exchanged the disc for one from a new shippment that had come in.  Of course, the new disc was exactly the same.  The DVD is produced in high def. and looks simply spectacular!

3525656,5,B001D395NG,"I really like this DVD. It has alot of nice orchestra music and chorus singing often sounding similar to the great orchestra and/or chorus christmas music albums from teh 1950's and 1960's. But this should be no surprise since this show has been going on since way before the 1950's (though I'm sure not in this exact format that's on the DVD although some of it could in fact be).

The ROCKETTES are superb. Their dancing skills are second to none and they are really entertaining.

The character of SANTA really sounds like santa, the way I may have thought he always would have sounded like when I was a little kid. This SANTA character dies sing here and there also.

Many of the songs will be familiar, some will probably be new. Some are instrumental with the orchestra and the ROCKETTES usually/always dancing while others will be done by the chorus.

The name says it all- ""Christmas Spectacular"". The Rockettes perform their precision dances and capture the holiday spirit to the max. The Christmas Spectacular show allows adults to be kids again and lets kids absorb the experience and wows them in a way that the impressions will last forever.

3525661,5,B001D395NG,"First off, No, this video does not show off all of the features of the Radio City Music Hall.  Second, it does present a wonderful edition of the Christmas Spectacular of the Rockettes!

If you have ever gone to see the Rockettes in a venue outside of New York and enjoyed the experience, you will be thrilled with this video!  If you have been to Radio City Music Hall to see the Rockettes and are open minded enough to not expect an exact replica of the Experience of actually going to New York, you will also be thrilled with this video.

We enjoyed this video enough (we have been to their live perfomance in the past)that we purchased multiple copies of this DVD to send out to friends and family as Christmas Card attachments (actually got the idea from someone else who wrote a review at Amazon).

My mother (83) is not in any condition health wise to be able to leave San Diego and travel to New York to see this show (even presuming she could obtain tickes or have the financial resources to do this)and this was the next best thing to being able to take her there.  She absolutely enjoyed the Video and has watched it several times already!

Time Life has done a wonderful job creating this video and we found the quality to be excellent.  I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who asked about it!  As an aside, we sent out 15 copies of this video with Christmas Cards and have had nothing but good comments back from everyone who received it.

If you are able to actually attend a live performance of this show at Radio City Music Hall, this video will have gotten you well prepared and have you excited to see it live.  You will also be able to see that little extra and listen to that extra bit that only attending the live performance can bring.  If you are not able to attend a live performance, this video will have enabled you to enjoy a ""not to be missed"" experience that will quickly become a Christmas tradition to view at home.",1229817600,7,1954,4.382271468144045
3525662,5,B001D395NG,I purchased this DVD for my elderly parents who had been to the show a few years ago.  When they watched the DVD they were so excited!  They  have viewed it several times and love it.  It is great because they can no longer go to see shows like this.,1229040000,,250,3.94

it is 80 minutes of sheer pleasure.
I recomend it most highly.",1228694400,,113,4.181818181818182
3525664,5,B001D395NG,"I have gone to see the show a few times, I always wished they would come out with it on DVD.  It is excellent.  Has the show in it's entirety.  So if you always wanted to see it, but never got to NYC to see it, buy this DVD!",1228521600,3,224,3.5306122448979593
3525665,5,B001D395NG,"If you like musical shows this is a very good one but for only once a year.
the print and sound is very good  and nice color, the music is good also if you like this kind, the dance scenes are very good and worth buying  but its just another xmas dvd and for only to watch at xmas time then away she goes till the next year, but it is a change to the normal xmas time tunes",1228348800,,373,3.7088607594936707

3525667,5,B001D395NG,"I just bought this video. And I really enjoyed it. I did expect to see the girls in those red outfits with the white nylons; but what can you do. Solomon in Ecclesiastes used to like those pretty dancing girls too. It is not pornographic but is very sexy in parts. and since I am such a lonely boy, this pleased me. After I stopped seeing my tall leggy slender therapist I seemed to have a thing for the Rockettes. but the Rockettes have to be 5 foot 5 to get in, the accopmanying video says. And they ahve to look like pale Vogue models. Very sexy women!!",1228003200,2,556,4.157407407407407

3525669,4,B001D395NG,"This is 2008 the last time I checked. I've never understood how someone can film a show or movie in widescreen and then forget to render the DVD in anamorphic video. The poor mastering job and the 2.0 Dolby stereo soundtrack (as opposed to including a 5.1 Dolby Digital surround track)  are the only disappointments with this title. The show is awesome. Until someone wakes up over at Time-Life, this will be the best we can hope for. It's better than not having it.",1226793600,9,466,4.5476190476190474

3525671,5,B001D395NG,"Watched it tonight with my 3 yo twins & 6 year old.  I wanted to see how they would respond to it before we spent the money on train tickets & money on the show in the city.  They LOVED it as did I.  We will for sure be taking them all into the city next year to see it.  The quality was amazing.  A lot of these types of productions you feel like you are 10 miles away...with this one you felt like you were front row, center!  It was so clear & crisp.  Amazing!  So worth the money.  So worth adding to your Holiday collection.  So easy to pull out & watch every year, especially if it easy for you to just hop on over to Radio City to catch the show!  I have recommended this to several friends & family members already!!!",1226188800,10,725,3.9310344827586206
3525672,5,B001D395NG,"I'm a product of the Music Hall.  I worked on and off their for years.  It is really to bad that other stage spectaculars such as the Easter (Spring) Show or the other great stage shows that i know were video recorded but never released.  It shocks me that they released this as the full production and not as shown with all the edited TV version last year.  The production value of the Christmas Show is excellent and the sound is wonderful.  My only objection is that they didn't record the music halls grand organs.  I have no idea why you couldn't hear it during some of the numbers that i know from seeing the 2007 version live both grand organs were used.

Maybe if we press the Music Hall they will release other great stage spectaculars.  I started seeing productions back in the late 50's till last years Christmas Show and the many shows i worked on during the 60's and 70's.

This is a great purchase and if you have never seen a Radio City Music Hall Show, GET THIS ONE.  You won't be disappointed.",1225843200,41,1010,4.352941176470588
3525673,5,B001D395NG,"From seniors to toddlers, this is an experience to be cherished.  Filmed at the world-famous Radio City Music Hall - one of the greatest Art Deco buildings ever - the Christmas Spectacular is sure to please anyone that enjoys the holidays.

The Rockettes are superb and the mainstay of the performance.  I saw the show way back in 1973 and have always retained the memory of that experience.  This updated version is new and thrilling (the double-decker bus and virtual tour of NYC is fantastic), yet some of the original remains:

* The Parade of the Wooden Soldiers is in the show since its conception in 1933; in my opinion it is one the greatest choreographed music pieces of all time
* The Live Nativity is visually beautiful as ever

The price of greeting cards has risen so high that I seriously considered not sending any this year.  Along came this DVD...I've ordered several copies of this show to send to people this year in lieu of holiday cards.  I usually look at a holiday card for about 30 seconds.  This DVD is 90 minutes of entertainment that can be kept and enjoyed over and over again.  I don't know about you, but I've never saved a holiday greeting card from year to year; however, if I received this for the holidays, I'd keep it and remember who sent it to me.

And, let's face it, the show is just plain fun!",1225843200,45,1333,4.466942148760331
3525674,5,B001D395NG,I saw the show in 2006 and this is pretty much what i remember - lots of energy that really comes out and the colors on my flat screen are awesome - thought i had gotten a Blue Ray verison by mistake - really feel like you are a part of the excitement and cant wait to have this playing for the folks at my christmas party this year.  The kids will love it- i just hope they don't get too excited and want to go again anytime soon - this is as good as it gets.,1225843200,16,460,3.7422680412371134
3525675,2,B001D395NG,"I saw this show several times in the early 1990's and it truly was spectacular.  I received the DVD of the 2007 show yesterday, watched it last night and was immensely disappointed.

Granted the choreography of the Rockettes is fantastic but that's about all I can say that is positive.  It certainly did not leave me with a 'Holiday Spirit' as I didn't recognize the vast majority of the new songs that they are calling holiday music.

There is no more opening number with the Great Organ playing well known holiday songs and the closing number with the Nativity Scene no longer has the poignant narration of 'One Solitary Life'.  And the segment where they are trying to convince a 14 year old that Santa is real, and a magician, is absolute foolishness. And they call this entertainment?

Whoever the Producers are, you have destroyed a great product.  But, I'm glad I purchased this DVD...it certainly saved me the many, many hundreds of dollars a trip to NYC to see this show would have cost. I'm very disappointed.",1225843200,17,1020,4.696629213483146

And they get to wrap it up in one of the most beautiful art deco buildings in the world. This was the 75th anniversary production.  Most of the old favorite numbers were included and many spetacular new pieces (my favorite being the double decker bus ride through Manhattan). I was actually in the audience the night this was taped and I was very pleased to see considerably more footage of the show than was televised on network TV and, as I remember, in the correct order it appeared in the program.

The Radio City Music Hall looks fabulous and the show offers amazing production numbers. I especially loved when the camera panned the audience to show childrens' reactions....pure joy. And the Rockettes are marvelous....although they are most famous for their precision line kicks, these women are extremely talented dancers and they perform more than a few very intricate and beautifully staged dance numbers.
