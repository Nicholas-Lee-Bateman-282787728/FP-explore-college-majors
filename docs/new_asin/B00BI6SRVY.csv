5622425,1,B00BI6SRVY,"ABSOLUTELY NO GLITTER TO THIS somewhat ""Middle-School"" production of the Burton/Taylor saga, cluttered with endless temper-tantrums and lots of broken glass ..... [cleaning up the set must have been a doozie].

RUMOR had it that when Burton first met Elizabeth, he referred to her as ""Liz"" - not her favorite name, she responded with ""Dick"" .... draw your own conclusion .....

LOHAN is ridiculously miscast, but oddly appealing in a perverse way .... watching a train-wreck .... her throaty [?] laugh is very Lohan - unlike the somewhat shriller Taylor version ....

The ""Cleopatra"" set is intensely drab - as opposed to the sheer opulence of the original [which almost caused Fox to crumple].

The rest of the cast?  Grabbed the bucks and made off into the sunset ..... really not worth - even a nod.

Watch if you must - but with lots of liquid refreshment and unbreakable bar 'props'.

[The danger of botox is so visible in some of the close-ups .........especially the immobile lips during close-encounters].

AND Russell as Mama Taylor?  Very odd scarring on the chin and nose ....",1368144000,2,1087,4.896174863387978
5622426,1,B00BI6SRVY,"I truly believe Queen Latifah portraying Marilyn Monroe would be more effective than Ms. Lohan as the legendary Elizabeth Taylor. There was a very valid reason the griping began the moment Ms. Lohan was announced as being cast for the role - she is simply NOT RIGHT FOR THE ROLE!!! There should have been a talent search for an unknown who was more physically and facially appropriate. The ONLY thing this ""movie"" got right was the placement of Taylor's beauty mark. As Martha said in ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"", ""...sad, sad, sad."" Undoubtedly THE low point for Lifetime! A true and total trainwreck that does NOTHING to give the viewer even the remotest idea of who Elizabeth Taylor was. I am profoundly sorry that Elizabeth Taylor's memory was so ill-served by this travesty.",1365033600,6,784,4.858208955223881
5622427,5,B00BI6SRVY,"I must say that I really enjoyed this movie. A lot of people that watched it said some nasty things, but I believe that's only because they dislike Lindsay. Lindsay is a brilliant actress and channels Liz Taylor magically. And this movie was really good. Lifetime did it again! The inbetween moments between just her and Burton were so fascinating. This movie was really good and I suggest you check it out!",1364601600,11,407,4.666666666666667
5622428,1,B00BI6SRVY,"Everyone knew ""Liz and Dick"" was going to be a disaster as soon as it was announced. Two reasons why:

1. It was being made by the Lifetime Network, with a TV-movie budget.
2. It starred Lindsay Lohan.

The pessimism was not unwarranted -- this movie is so bad that I'm surprised Richard Burton hasn't risen from the dead just to throw liquor bottles at the people responsible. I actually hoped that it would be bad in a hilarious, campy way, but instead it's just hideously awkward, cheesy and cheap. As Lohan croaks at one point, ""I'M SO BORED!""

The story is narrated by Elizabeth Taylor (Lohan) and Richard Burton (Grant Bowler) from the afterlife. Apparently the heavenly host really want to hear the inside scoop on their relationship. It started during the shooting of ""Cleopatra,"" when Shakespearean actor Burton was unexpectedly cast opposite the scandal-generating superstar Elizabeth Taylor.

Well, despite a rocky start, they began a torrid affair. Their romance destroyed both their marriages (her fourth, his first) and caused an even bigger scandal than her previous homewrecking affair. Over the next twelve years, they lived in a whirl of fights, lovemaking, tragedy, alcoholism and gems -- only to divorce, marry and divorce all over again.

The story of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton really needs a HBO miniseries, because it's impossible to cram twenty-plus years of high drama into a 90-minute Lifetime movie. And the rushed pace is only one of the movie's problems -- cheap-looking costumes, awful greenscreen, and a choppy disjointed narrative.

And yes, the writing is eye-rollingly bad (""You do know I'm shagging him senseless, don't you?""), but not in a funny way. I hoped this would be an over-the-top, campy funny mess, but it was simply dull and fragmented.

But the death knell for this movie is Lohan. I have literally seen cats who give better performances than her. Her performance in this movie is more Tommy Wiseau than Elizabeth Taylor -- a doughy, puffy-faced, larygngitic mess that croaks her way through unconvincing fights and crying jags, unable to even convey BOREDOM.

And yes, she is even WORSE when she tries to convey some emotional depth (""I am your ocean, but he was your anchor""). For example, Taylor's ""suicide"" -- complete with prancing, posing and Bella-Swan-style ""despairisms"" -- is one of the worst scenes I have seen on television. EVER.

It makes me feel sorry for Grant Bowler, who actually seems to be trying REALLY REALLY HARD despite Lohan and a dreadful script dragging him down. Despite the movie's awfulness, he does convey some of the tormented, hard-drinking poet, when he isn't being saddled with dreadful dialogue. And David Hunt gives one of the few good performances as Burton's tragic brother Ifor.

I hoped that ""Liz and Dick"" would be a movie that was hilariously, mockably bad... but no, it's just tedious and horribly written, with the worst-cast Elizabeth Taylor EVER.",1362096000,12,2950,5.039014373716633

We thought Lindsay Lohen and cast did a spectacular job, and we enjoyed the movie immensely.  Our only beef was that the movie was too short, and there were far too many commercial breaks.  At times, it seemed as though the character lines were interrupted mid-sentence in order to squeeze in an additional commercial.  Other than that, however, we thought the Lifetime movie was an artistic success.  In fact, I ordered a copy of the DVD imediately and have enjoyed it ever since.",1408147200,6,613,4.855769230769231

5622446,5,B00BI6SRVY,"Lindsay should have waited for a Monroe bio-pic. She acts it well though, a fair script only too limited to just the liz and dick portion of Elizabeth's life. Make up and hair is great!",1401667200,,185,4.314285714285714
5622447,3,B00BI6SRVY,"As something of a Richard Burton scholar and the author of a play called Dick & Liz (believe it or not), I approached this film with trepidation. And yet, like most people who find the story of the Burtons love affair so intriguing, I couldn't wait. It turns out LIZ & DICK isn't as bad as many people make it out to be.

There is no denying that Lindsay Lohan is inspired casting as Elizabeth Taylor. But no one stands a chance when compared to Elizabeth Taylor in her prime when she was one of the worlds great beauties and arguably the finest film actress of her generation. Were she somehow able to play Ms Taylor without being compared to heronly the distance afforded by time, perhaps, would allow for this Ms Lohan mightve come off better.

Ms Lohan plays sex well, though arguably sex is different from being sexy (and Elizabeth Taylor was definitely sexy). For example, about half the film is taken up with kissing and, luscious as Lindsay Lohan is, her sullied reputation conveys a person less in love and more going through the motions of intimacy. She never gets to the heart of Elizabeth Taylor (who certainly equated sex with love) though many of the essential ingredients are on display: vulnerability, childishness, vanity, etc. As a result, the emotional scenes never portray the passion they should. If the premise of LIZ & DICK is to tell one of the worlds great love stories, then we need access to the feelings and passions of the protagonists. Instead of being told Burton and Taylor are in love, we should be shown it. Going through the motions of intimacy, or jealousy, or quarreling isn't convincing enough.

The production design is the real star of this biopic. The jewellery (essential in a film about Elizabeth Taylor) looks real, the sets are lavish, sometimes opulent, and the clothes, though sometimes ridiculous (oh, the seventies!) are right on the money.

Grant Bowler is very good as Richard Burton, though claims that his voice captures Burtons timbre are highly exaggerated. Bowler conveys the essence of Burton, however: the insecure coal miners son who never got over the death of his mother. His relationship with older brother Ifor is explored reasonably well, though the lifeline Ifor represented to Burton isn't fully examined. Bowler is a better actor than Lohan, which is problematic, given that Elizabeth Taylor arguably had the stronger personality. If not, she at least had the power, for Burton was constantly afraid she would leave himwhich she eventually did. Here it is clear Ms Lohan is the star, but she is simply acting opposite someone who is better than her, which serves to undermine whatever star power she may have.

The real problem with LIZ & DICK though, is the script, which moves from climax to climax with such haste that it becomes comical towards the end. If this great love story is going to have the effect it is supposed to have on an audience then we must be made to feel the tragedy of it all. Trying to cover too much ground makes the story superficial, ultimately. Without the roots of character and psychology firmly planted, we simply cant respond with the emotional investment tragedy requires from an audience. To truly plumb the depths of tragedy and sorrow and move beyond the shallowness of tabloid fantasy is the greatest challenge in telling this tale. People of privilege who live a life of riches beyond the imaginings of most of us must be seen to fall mightily if we are going to feel sympathy for them and thus deem their suffering tragic. It is sometimes a very fine line between catharsis (a purging of emotion as we respond with fear and pity) and comeuppance.

Make no mistake, this is a tragic tale, but mainly for reasons not explored here. Richard Burton was destroyed by Elizabeth Taylor. LIZ & DICK ignores that truth and tries to persuade us that Elizabeths suffering was the real tragedy here. We are told she kept Burtons letters to her to the end of her life. Sorry, that is sentiment, not tragedy. Burtons downfall and early death is a tragedy.

LIZ & DICK isn't as bad as some say, but it couldve been a lot better. For fans of Liz and Dick, theres still plenty to enjoy. Just don't expect, well, Liz and Dick.",1397433600,3,4215,4.710990502035278
5622448,5,B00BI6SRVY,"Everyone pulled their weight, except Miss Lohan, watching her try to be the great Liz was hilarious, that's why I bought I first saw it on Lifetime and laughed and laughed. A good campy movie.",1395532800,,192,4.514285714285714
5622449,3,B00BI6SRVY,"A somewhat disappointing narration, with Taylor and Burton telling the story from the Afterlife a la All That Jazz.  Some parts of it appear a little unbelievable. It's difficult to think Burton was so in awe of Taylor at their first meeting he continually fluffed his lines. There's no build-up to their attraction...one day they apparently hate each other, the next they're so madly in love they use each break to head to a trailer for some afternoon (or morning or mid-day) delight. There's no transition from one to the other. I was hoping for scenes showing the making of specific movies the two were in, as well as their interaction with others in the casts, etc.. Instead there were merely various scenes of lovemaking and fights, break-ups and reconciliations. Perhaps that's the way the screenwriters saw their lives together, or perhaps they didn't want to make this a 3-hour epic, or...perhaps they merely had to choose what to portray and this is the result. Though I remember the headlines well, a few days after watching this, I can barely remember any of it which is sad, since it could've been something very memorable and outstanding, a tribute to two people who were fine actors, instead of merely a catalogue of their clashes.",1394755200,,1245,4.845070422535211

5622451,5,B00BI6SRVY,"I have always been fascinated with Elizabeth Taylor's life. The men ,marriages ,the beautiful jewelry she wore. The saga with Richard Burton fascinated me the most. And I do believe she was the most beautiful Egyptian Queen yet. I just simply adored her in the movie Cleopatra. The campaign on AIDS was spectacular. This woman had many facets to her just like a diamond. Lindsay Lohan did a pretty good job.

5622455,5,B00BI6SRVY,"The star of Mean Girls, Freaky Friday, and The Parent Trap is back and better than ever! Lindsay Lohan is STUNNING in this portrayal of the classic love story of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. Not since Romeo and Juliet has a tale of two lovers been so timeless and ideal. Lohan's Elizabeth Taylor is filled with depth, pain, and excitement as we follow her through the years of the relationship with Richard. Her work in perfecting contrasting emotions, discoveries within the life of Liz, and secrets that she must keep from Dick, make this movie a real master class in acting technique. Watching the leading lady tell this story makes it seem as if someone followed the actual Elizabeth Taylor around with a camera. Tale as old as time. True as it can be. Barely even friends. Then somebody bends. Unexpectedly. Just a little change. Small to say the least. Both a little scared. Neither one prepared. LIZ AND DICK. Don't miss out on adding this soon-to-be classic to your collection!",1377302400,,993,4.77906976744186
5622456,4,B00BI6SRVY,"I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie. I had heard all the jabs at Miss Lohan's acting and her portrayal of Miss Taylor, and since I heard it was based on 'Furious Love' which I thought made Miss Taylor out to be quite the immature spaz, I didn't have high hopes. However...this one deserves to Lifetime a nod of the head. While I understand Miss Taylor's family's reluctance to participate in this film, it wasn't horrible, meaning I didn't have to make a drinking game out of it to get through. And the clothes! The clothes...the clothes. The costume jewelry wasn't so bad either, but those dresses! Ugh; I wanted to burn my 'rags' afterword.

Lohan could turn the water works on, but my main complaints were her lips (couldn't they just line the natural form rather than play up to her cosmetic enhancement?) and her voice (she should have at least tried to imitate Taylor's unique speech). In long shots her makeup and styling gave her the appearance of Miss Taylor. Grant Bowler was quite exquisite as Mr. Burton; I was impressed. He helped carry Lohan through some scenes.

I am an avid fan of Miss Taylor and like I referenced, 'Furious Love' made me think twice about some views of Taylor...but I was wrong. She did the best with what she had. She was strong and brave and intelligent far beyond what anyone gave her credit for.  When she died, it was one of the times I really felt a presence was lost in the world. I never met her, but her pictures adorned my wall all my life. Upon her entrance into the afterlife, I like to imagine her running through an open grassy field, splitting into two beings: one runs toward Mike Todd, and the other to Richard Burton. And both are happy.",1373673600,,1699,4.491909385113269
5622457,5,B00BI6SRVY,"This movie was playing on my treadmill TV recently. I started watching it reluctantly, but before I knew it, 2 enjoyable hours had passed. The miles and the minutes flew by. It was just downright fun to watch--Liz and Dick are train wrecks waiting to happen. In every scene, they're either smoking or boozing or partying or fighting!

I really, really enjoyed this feature. Lindsey Lohan was quite good. She was understated and elegant. (She's very pretty as a brunette and she took to the extensive costuming nicely.) If anything, Grant Bowler as Burton was the weak link here. This movie did not sink Lohan's career. If anything, it energized it. Again, she was great. Nicely done, Lindsey!!!",1371945600,,694,4.88135593220339
5622458,3,B00BI6SRVY,"To see this movie, you need to have two characteristics: To be a fan of Liz Taylor and the Golden Era, and to be a fan of Lindsay Lohan. If you hate Lindsay, you won't like the movie. If you don't know anything about Taylor, you will get bored. But if you have the combination of some kind of admiration for both of them, the movie will amuse you.
To be fair, Lindsay is not acting as Liz, is acting as herself (that is why you need to like her), but she wears a good makeup that helps to make some resemblance. The story is interesting, but the editing is really wierd (as the cuts are done for TV, they feel abrupt) and the ending is really bad. Spoiler: Richard and Liz marry for the second time. Next scene: Richard is dead. What?! What happened between those years? Nothing is explained. Still... the movie is OK",1371513600,,817,4.243589743589744

The only thing good about it was the scenery and the jewelry! Hopefully this will be her last movie and she won't torture us with her pathetic acting! What an insult to the beautiful Elizabeth Taylor to have this no talent ""actress"" even trying to portray her! Every once in awhile she kind of looked vaguely like Elizabeth Taylor, but once she opened her month, the illusion was shot!
Grant Bowler was pretty uninspired too. He had none of Richard Burton's charm and charisma! He didn't sound like Richard Burton, or even come close to looking like him...
The way the movie ended with the line about how Elizabeth Taylor kept all of Richard Burton's letters was just uninspired...I can think of lots of other things that were more important in their story then whether she kept his letters...LIke all of important contributions to worthy causes etc.
All in all, I think this movie was poorly done, poorly acted and poorly written. Glad I got it from the library and didn't have to pay to watch it!",1369872000,3,1117,4.562189054726368

Lohan is known as a mediocre actress, who squandered what little talent she had by her obsurd and childish lifestyle choices.

This could have been a fantastic movie, but the choice of cast was so far off the mark it became laughable. Shame on you Lifetime for demeaning Elizabeth Taylor with this shoddy, pitiful, tabloid-esque portrayal of her life.",1369094400,10,621,5.029126213592233

The film is told in part as a flashback with narration by Liz (Lindsey Lohan) and Dick (Grant Bowler) starting with the filming of ""Cleopatra."" I thought Lindsey Lohan would be right for the role, although she played it without class and style. Oh, they did get the contacts right. I kept waiting for that moment to tie the film together, to make everything I was watching on the screen suddenly become meaningful. It didn't happen.

I did watch other biopic adaptations of Taylor's life and yes there are much better but seriously give this one a chance. Logan is not the greatest actress guaranteed but she does an excellent job at portraying Elizabeth's insecurities and pain which are the two essential things that surfaced during Taylor's later years. Bowler does an excellent job at portraying Tim Burton and the chemistry between the two actors are almost spot on. Great made for TV movie. Seriously, this film really depends on your preferences and how you see the original Elizabeth Taylor.",1465776000,,843,4.943661971830986
8568883,3,B00BI6SRVY,"Liz & Dick (the media nickname for Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton) premiered on Lifetime back in November 2012, twenty months after Elizabeth Taylor had died in March 2011. This isn't a bad movie, but it isn't a great one by any means. As I said in my title for this review, this movie seems ""rushed"". I'm sure when Miss Taylor died, there were all sorts of people wanting to do a biopic, and evidently Lifetime got the rights to her story; or part of it at least. This movie covers some twenty-something years, spanning from around 1961 to 1984. Now that's a lot to cover in one movie that is roughly 90 minutes long. The story has to move vast, and with that, there are some inaccuracies (I'm sure) and there is a lot that must have been left out. With a time frame spanning this long, this shouldn't have been a movie, but instead a two or even three-part miniseries.

With all that aside, let's get to the movie itself. As I mentioned above, this isn't a completely terrible movie like everyone says it is, but there are quite few things wrong with it. First, let me talk about the cast. Lindsay Lohan as Liz Taylor, one of the world's great beauties in her prime, is hopelessly miscast. She did good in the teen-aimed Freaky Friday and Mean Girls, but she isn't quite cut out to tackle a role with demands like these. Her looks are shot, owing to her own substance abuse, but she isn't completely bad. There are a few good instances were she does look quite elegant, but her voice and body has to be the my main problem with Miss Lohan. She doesn't have the body Miss Taylor had in her prime, nor does she have that distinctive Taylor voice. As for Grant Bowler as Richard Burton, I suppose he does decent. His voice, too, is a little off, but he does resemble Burton, at least somewhat. Everyone else, I guess, is decent, nothing too bad, but certainly nothing too great.

Liz & Dick is a trashy time-waster. Don't come into this movie with extremely high hopes and you won't be severely disappointed. There is nothing here that hasn't been written before, but I suppose it serves its purpose of being a quick, inexpensive way of ""exposing"" Taylor and Burton's turbulent life together. I've given this movie three stars; I was divided, I almost gave it four, but my feeling that this movie is just ""Okay"" only warrants a three-star rating.",1464048000,,2350,4.501170960187354
