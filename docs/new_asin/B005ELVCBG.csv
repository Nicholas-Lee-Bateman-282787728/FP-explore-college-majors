4666146,5,B005ELVCBG,"This is one of the favorite DVDs in my collection.  Very entertaining and informational, even if you're not into religious shows. It has a very high replay value.  I've watched it probably 4 or 5 times all the way through and am still picking up on things I missed.  A little dated, but very well done.",1418688000,13,302,4.357142857142857
4666147,3,B005ELVCBG,"Despite the History Channel packaging, this five-disc set actually contains 10 episodes of A&E's richly produced ""Mysteries of the Bible"" series hosted by Richard Kiley in the 1990s. The actual content is very substantial, featuring a summary of Biblical tales with a consideration of the historicity (particularly archaeological record) behind each one. The non-chronological 43-minute episodes feature Abraham and Joseph (Old Testament) on Disc 1, King David and Jesus Christ on Disc 2, Jacob and Joshua on Disc 3, Job and King Solomon on Disc 4, and Samson & Delilah and Moses on Disc 5.

The big problem with these Biblical documentaries is that they are monotonous, dated, and unimaginative in their presentation style. Every episode features Kiley's sonorous narration with the same woman's voiceover reading Bible excerpts, interspersing scholarly interviews with static photography of religious artwork and some nice modern-day footage of religious and archaeological sites in the Middle East. Also, the episodes spend more time summarizing the Biblical stories than analyzing them. After a few minutes, the repetitive style becomes sleep-inducing, as one comes to appreciate how modern CGI animations and theatrical recreations have amped up the quality of this sort of documentary in the past ten years.

In summary, I think these videos might be of great interest to an adult Bible study or religion class, but I believe teenagers and younger kids will be incredibly bored by the programs. I would not show it to kids or teens today because it is too far removed from the quick-cutting, digitally enhanced television programs they are used to seeing. These episodes (over 7 hours on 5 discs) are remarkably informative as summaries of Biblical stories with informed analysis, but they are also incredibly dull by comparison to the ""reality TV"" style of more recent cable TV documentaries.",1394236800,12,1899,5.3478260869565215
4666148,4,B005ELVCBG,"For those who as a child sat through Sunday school or endured yet another session of bible study this film collection will bring back familiar tales of bible heroes. It is a good educational lesson on some of the well known characters. It is coupled with new research into solving the debate as to whether these events ever occurred. Also, a nice documentary for those history enthusiasts out there, I recommend it.",1373673600,2,415,4.777777777777778
4666149,4,B005ELVCBG,Well some of the stories are well put together other are not for the price it is a good deal so if you can get it for 9 dollars go ahead but not much more than that.,1367452800,5,165,3.4864864864864864
4666150,5,B005ELVCBG,"I expected this DVD set to align solely with biblical text and was pleasantly surprised to find that may references have archaeological evidence to support biblical text!  I am not a religious person, but rather a fact finder.  The Bible is one of the world's oldest history books and it was wonderful to watch a DVD that proves many of the historical references in biblical text now supported by modern day findings.  I'm on my last disc in the set and sad it will end...definitely worth the investment and a keeper!",1362441600,31,517,4.65934065934066
4666151,4,B005ELVCBG,"I was initially a little put off by the dated look of the documentaries, but the stories are fascinating and I quickly got over it. There is interesting input from biblical scholars throughout. Every documentary is fair and balanced, never blatantly advocating any Abrahamic religions and in some cases, challenging them. Overall, I finished the set and felt I learned a lot. My only complaint is the order of the documentaries, they start out chronological to the Bible (or Tanakh) and then sort of jump around. But you can always just pick the order that suits you.",1361750400,18,567,4.855670103092783

4666180,4,B005ELVCBG,"Real Success & Happiness, or Enlightenment & Salvation for Dummies ...Made fun!

Smooth as a smoothie: When you get the knack genuine success and happiness in some ways is effortless once realizing whats of greatest value, for when aspiring to the greatest good for all things people will often naturally want to hire, work with, and even help, thereby benefiting while aiding you in becoming successful. Achieving a livelihood and having taken care of the basics you're ready for the really good stuff!

Similar to Einstein's MC-Squared, simple yet profound: When you comprehend what is of lasting and greater value you become more connected or in sync with all of kindred motivation, somewhat as in physics when electrons are able to instantaneously communicate with each other over vast distances and like attracting like. You therefore begin to resonate and integrate with all thats harmonious (and timelessness), which not only makes you very happy but positively energized from being enhanced and expanded by everything of similar vibration/motivation  Kinda-like hitching a serene luminous wave through the universe ...And you don't have go incognito or wear sun-glasses because its inherently cool, and SEXY  (dont get excited, just kidding). Anyway, beats a hot dog or even a billion bucks any day Or be concerned about being saved by committing to a faith at a later date, or trapped in your car during the rapture without a sun-roof, tell your analyst, join anything, need a middle man ...And No Cover Charges (Yahoo)!

And to think in large part the key to happiness and the big questions could turned out to be so simply (Mmm, seems almost disappointing, too breezy, no drama).

 Well, I started this out as a serious metaphysical discourse, and wound-up with another comedy  - Oh well, maybe next time  - bwk

Humor:  Have you been snuggled lately?

I believe planetary salvation resides in the world becoming more snuggly. People need to begin to be cozy with one another, and start hailing one another with such greetings as; Are you cozy, or have you been cozied while praising the heavens for cozy places to go  - light and easy and warm and breezy and count their snugs at night.

Snugglers of the universe unite!

Just some prophetic cosmic humor to keep in mind through the day and warm at night.

By Expansionists Productions Unlimited (not really, just had a nice ring to it).  ( o ;

Having studied the commonality of ideals of capitalistic democracy, communism and religion worldwide its disconcerting to find throughout the ages the majority of resources serving extravagance, hierarchy and consolidation of power often achieved and maintained through the exploitation, depredation and ignorance of the common man  - Not to mention the persecutions and ravages caused by related warfare.
Such social entities go great lengths to create the perception of order from chaos, then fill in the discontinuities with canned patriotism, the requirement of faith to obtain eternal life, or worse avoid eternal hell.
It seems many people need structure, ritual, definition  ...an iconic supernatural entity to embellish, plead their cares to, worship And integral reward system to derived security from being destined for eternal life.
Although within all creeds and religions there are exceptional individuals with characteristics and values worthy of emulation, its common to project lesser human qualities unto the character of the divine and worship, cater too and regulate others accordingly while depending on divine intervention instead of taking personal responsibility to create a sustainable world and purifying ones motives while realistically aspire to whatever brings about the greatest possible harmony for all things.
Must we subscribe to exclusive assumptions without reservation and continually seed the beds of worldwide ecological disaster, convolution, divisiveness and strife?
... And why not goodness for its own sake? What could be simpler, more purifying, self-affirming, divine in character ...and to the point!

Religions with by far with the greatest following are those having integral reward systems i.e. those that promise eternal bliss and other incentives for adhering to an assumed supreme doctrine. Though there are those of religious orientation with admirable motives, many delude themselves of having genuine love/devotion, the real fascination and motivation deriving primarily from celebrity like status and power of religious figures and promise of an eternally blissful after-life. Take away the embellishments: Business-as-usual insurance policy.

 Secure in being raptured and eternity bound beliefs based on faith rather than proven fact manifest into serious threats from a third of the world not sharing fully responsibility for critical issues such as over-population, environmental degradation and general long-term planetary sustainability.

 Personally I find the conventional Christian concept of salvation and crucification baffling. Was Christs sacrifice originally divine or necessary could such a love for humanity been demonstrated inspiringly yet in a less harsh, debt laden manner?

Unlike Christ with decisive foreknowledge of knowing where he came from and going Im didn't submit being born into a world of contradiction, confusion, injustice and chaos. I just want the opportunity to be accepted as an imperfect work in progress and live modestly in peace and harmony - Which should be an inherent birth-right for all things ...so is there a logical reason to be beholding or saved?

 If there be a divine entity he would not have the petty traits, egotism, subjugations, and inflexible technical judgments projected onto him by people, but qualities of compassionate commonality.

Regardless of orientation it would seem cultivating an open heart, mind, progressive nature and aspirational focus on whatever brings about the greatest possible harmony to all things without further expectation of reward the more essential integral qualifying, comprehensive, and purifying essence of spirituality and human potential.

Devastating Perfection: Many find reason to question the existence of an all-powerful God with so much suffering having occurred to the innocent throughout the ages. Was Jesus wondrously delusional in a beautiful way? Did his disciples pass on biases or exaggerate to have a personal sense of power, security and everlasting future or many thereafter delete, distort embellish to feel special, superior, exploit otherwise? Bearing in mind faith is just that; faith not fact, leaves one with the premise that if there is some kind of divine order then lifes primary purpose is to learn and evolve to interact harmoniously. Though there can be no doubt for those of progressive inclination living is a great character building, many experiences seem pointless and even cruel still there is hope: For just as its unreasonable to assume the existence of the divine, its also to conclude its non-existence, for as myself, many people around the world regardless of religion or otherwise have had similar miraculous experiences with a common thread with no other possible explanation other than being of divine origin (i.e. see oberf.org). Having exhausted logical explanations, could inexplicable chaos and confusion serve a greater purpose of purification of motive and goodness for its own sake in other words regardless of what the future may hold aspiring to whatever manifests the greatest harmony for all things and therefore our greater and truer salvation as a planet, race and individual?

Antidote for what may be a godless world: If we find transcendent beauty and compassion in ourselves and examples elsewhere then surely in the vastness of the universe are evolved worlds, dimensions and beings of empathy that have manifested such benevolent harmonious qualities sustainably.

Such certainty assures great possibilities here and beyond for beings throughout the cosmos of progressive inclination.",1428451200,,8002,5.433414043583535
