It is not the best video for right before bed time, but great when your child has a lot of energy (which seems to be always!)  and it is very cute and entertaining for parents too.  My son watches this  video more than the others we have at home!",921456000,16,339,3.8550724637681157

821530,3,6304279485,"My 2 year old loves sesame Street, but seems to get distracted from this one easily. I think it's just that there are a lot of other kids in the video and she really just likes the characters that she's used to seeing. Cute video, nothing wrong with it.

When I first bought the video, she wasn't too interested in it, but now that she's a little older, she absolutely loves it.  We play the video at least once a day and she knows all the dances already.  We do them as a family, and I have to say, it's fun.  This is a great video when you can't get outside.",1445299200,,413,3.9878048780487805

821613,5,6304279485,My 2 year of loves this and wants to do it almost every day. Great songs and fun dances. It's clearly from the 90s or earlier so the picture quality is poor. I would like more videos like thisin our collection- especially ones in HD picture- but I haven't found any.

821757,5,6304279485,This is a terrific introduction to dance from Sesame characters for kids 2-5. Each dance is easy to follow and unique. My daughters particularly love the Dog Had a Birthday and the Jelly dances. Wish there were more dance tutorials like this one on the market.,1404518400,,260,4.673913043478261
821758,3,6304279485,"This sounded soooo nice, and I usually trust anything Sesame Street...but the kids are encouraged to behave like animals, literally, like dogs...that kind of behavior tends to stick with a kid, and is very unattractive outside of the ""dance"" arena.",1401926400,,248,5.225
821819,5,6304279485,I purchased this for my youngest grandson. Amazon was the only place I could find anything with big bird on it. He loves it! You should see him exercise/dance with Big Bird.,1399420800,,173,4.4375

821822,3,6304279485,My two year old loves Big Bird!  I like that I can put him on at any time. The story line is cute but I would like more instruction to be able to follow it.  Great for toddlers!,1394150400,,177,3.6315789473684212
821823,3,6304279485,Classic which in this case means a little boring for a busy 2.5 year old. Mommy didn't mind it! Didn't make it through the whole thing before kiddo lost interest.,1393891200,,162,4.433333333333334
821824,5,6304279485,I bought this for my son as a Christmas present and he was very excited to open it.  It engages him and is instilling a love of motion and dancing.,1389571200,,147,3.9
821825,3,6304279485,Was not a DVD to keep my children interested.  I choose it to give them activity inside during bad weather.  I would not recommend the DVD for the purpose.,1388448000,,155,4.310344827586207
821826,5,6304279485,"My almost 2 year old granddaughter received this for Christmas. While the other reviewers are correct, the clothing is totally 80's-we don't mind it. Big Bird and the kids on the DVD really do get a child to want to dance along. It accomplished what we wanted it to. Not a DVD that the child will sit and zone out while staring at it. Within 2 days she is following along with the dance routines. Unexpected benefit is that it is teaching her to follow a sequence of directions. Recommend.",1388275200,,489,4.444444444444445
821827,3,6304279485,"We bought this hoping to get the family moving together a little more. Our 4 year old was done after the first number. It was very active, which is good, but it wasn't a good workout routine which is what we were looking for. It would be fun to just dance with for a kid, but not so great for the family to workout together.",1384905600,,324,4.0
821828,5,6304279485,"basis of video is Big Bird takes his teddy bear, Radar, to a dance studio with some kids and they have a dance party.  very simple, they do have some scenes not in the studio - we love it for its simplicity, for not being ""busy"" - our son has Down syndrome and he loves music and watching other people dance, he enjoys this very much.  he tries to dance along and imitate.  it is not too fast paced either so he can keep up.",1380758400,,424,3.9647058823529413
821902,5,6304279485,I have grandchildren ranging in age from 2 years old to almost 8 years old.  They all love this video and they all dance together and giggle and get exercise and have lots of fun.  I am completely satisfied and highly recommend this dvd.,1379548800,,237,4.363636363636363
821903,4,6304279485,Outdated video quality but songs and dance and characters are classic. My 2yo twins follow the dances and sing songs,1378339200,,116,4.85
821904,5,6304279485,I bought Get Up and Dance because my son loves to dance and I was looking for something he would enjoy on video.  Well I hit the jackpot with this one!  My son is 3 1/2 and he watches and dances to this video all the time.  There are several fun songs with dance moves that are pretty easy to catch on to.  It's like being at the party with the cast!  And honestly my husband and I have both found ourselves getting up and dancing with him.  Hope your little one enjoys it like mine does!,1378080000,,488,3.979381443298969
821905,1,6304279485,"I bought this thinking it would be like the baby einstein movies that have short snips of dancing with the characters of Sesame Street.  It was an old 80s episode and I wasn't impressed by the acting or dancing.  It didn't get my daughter moving at all...in fact, she went to play outside instead of watching it with me.  Go fig.",1376611200,,329,4.360655737704918
821906,2,6304279485,It seems a bit dated which would be ok but my toddler just doesn't seem to respond to it.  I thought it would get her up dancing but it doesn't.  She finds it mildly entertaining because of Big Bird but the rest she doesn't seem to care for that much.,1376092800,,251,4.0
821907,5,6304279485,"My son loves this! He dances every time and asks for it to be turned on daily. Some times several times a day, but I only allow it once. All the songs are catchy and have great beats. Highly recommend this! I would definitely buy this again!",1374192000,,241,4.148936170212766
821908,4,6304279485,Some corny stuff (Big Bird annoys me at points) but my daughter loves it. 4.5 if I could give it.  Good movements. Good music. A bit of blues with beat and real artists.  Good stuff!,1373414400,,182,4.171428571428572
821909,2,6304279485,"i wanted something that my daughter and i could dance to together- i thought these dances would be led-like hokey pokey or chicken dance,  the first one is, but after that, they are just dancing to songs, she loses attention to it and wanders away",1372636800,,247,4.488888888888889
821910,3,6304279485,"I was hoping each dance would teach a sequence of moves, which the first song does.  And the three kids that I nanny, ages 2-yrs, 2-yrs, and 3-yrs, did pick it up pretty quickly.  I replayed the song 4 or 5 times and they had it. However, the remaining songs only have one move per song, such as running around with your arms out like an airplane.  I was hoping for something I could get some exercise with as well as keeping them entertained.  But they lost interest with the remaining songs as quickly as I did.",1372118400,3,513,4.257731958762887
821911,3,6304279485,This is more of a story with a few dances.  I was really hoping for something that would be really interactive and hold my daughter's attention.  It just doesn't.,1370304000,,162,4.551724137931035
821981,5,6304279485,my 18month old and my 4 1/2 year old love this movie! They love watching the kids dance and now they know all of the songs!,1367712000,,123,3.769230769230769

821983,4,6304279485,"I bought it for my 3 and 1 yr old boys so they could burn some energy before naptime. My youngest likes it more than his brother. The songs are cute but the movie in general is a little dated, not that kids mind much. I think next time I'll look for something that teaches some easy dance moves to get my older one a little more inerested.",1366070400,,339,4.0
821984,3,6304279485,"Got this for my 2 1/2 yr old daughter who LOVES to dance.  I don't know if maybe she didn't want to dance to it because the songs weren't familiar kids' songs or what, but I have tried it 3 times and every time she refuses to dance.  It's a pity because I was hoping this would be something to help get her up and moving more inside since we've had a late winter here and it's too cold for me to take her newborn brother outside so she can have some outside play time.
She likes watching it ok, but I don't really like her watching TV just to watch it.  I guess we will try it a few more times to see if she gets more interested in dancing after she's seen it a few times.",1364860800,2,672,3.8550724637681157

821986,5,6304279485,"This DVD is quite engaging, my granddaughter especially like the I'm a little airplane section of the dancing.

821988,5,6304279485,I got this because I notice my son was starting to bob his head to music.  this is a great dance video because my 18 month old recognized the animals in the dances he is totally enthralled by it and the songs actually have good beats so I don't mind listening to it either ;) I would definately recommend this video,1361404800,,315,4.163934426229508

I am surprised it was released in 2003 because the clothes the kids are wearing seems very mid-1990's which makes me wonder if it was taped in the 1990s and re-realeased to DVD in 2003 or something? But my 3 year old doesn't notice of course and therefore he doesn't really care. I'm just saying... I guess maybe it bugs me a little haha... but overall a GREAT DVD for kids.

My 19 month old was entranced and we danced around for almost the whole DVD. She loved it.  Like any Sesame Street DVD it is produced well - no shaky camera syndrome.  Cute, catchy songs good for little ones and fun, easy-to-follow dance moves. (Do the airplane, walk like a dog, wiggle dance, etc.)",1328745600,,442,4.714285714285714

As much as I hate to say it, he LOVES this thing.  It is very dated, and it kills me to watch to early 90s styles flash across the screen, but he is captivated by this video.  I still had to give it 4 stars just because of the plethora of 'mom' jeans that are shown in the video, but it is definitely a 5 star investment in my son's eyes.",1323820800,2,516,3.75

She only lasts a few songs, but when she rests she loves to laugh at me dancing to it.  the songs are fun and catchy and real easy for the younger audiance.  It wears me out as well as her!!  I was looking for something fun to do that was ""exercise"" with out being ""exercise"" and this video does the trick.  i would recommend this DVD for anyone that has kids (toddlers).",1316131200,,509,4.03
822128,4,6304279485,"I bought this for my 2 1/2 yr. old to help her burn off energy when we couldn't take her outside due to weather.  She loves it and has asked for it every day since it arrived.  (In fact, she's watching it right now.)  The dances are very simple and easy to learn.

It has eight songs/dances:
""A Very Simple Dance"":  This one is her favorite.  It gradually guides them through a bunch of moves (clap your hands, stomp your feet, turn around, touch your toes, etc.).  I helped my daughter follow along the first two times and she did it on her own the third time.  It reminds me of the little Dash's Dance Party clips on PBS.
""I'm a Little Airplane"":  I've seen this one on Sesame Street.  The kids run around pretending to be airplanes.
""Birdland Jump"":  Lots of jumping to a jazz song, plus things like flapping your arms, etc.
""Do the Dog"":  They crawl around pretending to be dogs (barking, turning in circles, etc.)
""Do the Jelly"": Reminds me of that 60s dance, The Swim
""Cat Had a Birthday"": No real dance moves for this one.  Kids jump to the song and say animal noises.
""Doin' the Grouch"": Scowling, stomping, etc.
""A New Way to Walk"": Kids are supposed to walk funny, with several suggestions provided.  Clips of lots of other people strutting/dancing, including lots of celebrities, like Garth Brooks and Marisa Tomei.  My daughter doesn't understand this one yet.
After that, there's a freestyle dance segment followed by a ""Bonus Track"" with Elmo rapping the alphabet 90s-style.

There are only a few lines of dialogue between each segment, and the opening two minutes of skit are easily skipped from the menu.  Yes, the dancing is really simple and sometimes is basically just jumping, but she's two -- I'm not looking for the meringue.  I rated it four stars instead of five because of things only adults would care about.  The whole thing looks about 15-20 yrs. old, and the plot is really annoying.  The dance instructor Celina complains about being tired after nearly every dance, and the more you watch it, the creepier Big Bird's responses become.  (Well, I don't know Celina.  This is Radar's party, and Radar says he wants another dance.)  Celina's singing is sometimes offkey.  Despite these things, it was exactly what I was looking for.  It gets my daughter physically active on days she can't run around outside, and she enjoys it.",1311552000,8,2354,4.655339805825243

This video teaches her that taking care of herself can also be fun and feel good. My one year old even stomps around and does some of the dances, she is already enjoying the video and will probably just enjoy it more and more as she gets older and more able to understand it.

The songs are catchy and cute and they don't seem to annoy me like other children's songs do.  The twins are now 16 months and they are starting to imitate the dancing from the video, which is also positive.  One other positive aspect of this video is that it is not rehashed clips from previous Sesame Street shows.

While the title is ""Get up and Dance"", it doesn't always show the moves, and the choppy editing makes it hard for a young child to follow.  The dance instructor's voice is shrill and she yells instead of singing.  I'm assuming that was simply for her to be heard over the children, but it is unpleasant to listen to.  ""I'm a Little Airplane"" is a cute, retro sounding song that looks like a music video, but unless you dance with your child, there's no ""dance"" instruction with this song.  My 2 year old loves Elmo, and there is a song at the end where Elmo dances- basically it looks like an Elmo puppet shaken in front of a black screen for about of half of the song, and then it cuts off.  Obviously there are other children who do enjoy this video, but I recommend that you rent, borrow or check it out of the library first to see if your child likes it before you buy.",1118620800,20,1020,4.178571428571429

The songs are all very catchy (and those of us who love unsung rock and roll heroes appreciate the inclusion of Jonathan Richman's I'm a Little Airplane), the dances are simple enough, and you'll find yourself humming along.
There is one big problem with the tape.  Celina, the dance instructor, may have the most grating speaking voice ever recorded.  The conceit of Celina needing rest gets a bit old after awhile, and her acting (as well as that of Big Bird) suggest that this was probably a very quick shoot done to make a quick buck.
Another problem you may have is that the Sesame Street puppets are only scene minimally.  My daughter doesn't mind, but others might.  THis was definitely worth every penny we paid for it just to hear her sing her first song, ""The Birthday Song.""  She sings along every time.",1053648000,7,932,4.511904761904762

I am sorry to say that the only dance that was worth anything was the first one where they actually interact with the kids and tell them what move to do - which my 2 yr. old daughter found lots of fun - but after that it was all down hill. They play a song about airplanes and tell the kids to run around like air planes. thats it. I can do that too and could probably think of other moves. the rest of the tape follow suit. I think they were just plane lazy. All they have to do is put a picture of big bird and elmo and relay on us succer parent to buy it and to accept the insult to our childrens abilities. I should have just bought another music cd for kids and let it run in the backround while I make up moves.
