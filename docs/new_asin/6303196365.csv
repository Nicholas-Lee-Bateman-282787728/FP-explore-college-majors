7840714,5,6303196365,"I saw this video when it first aired on television years ago.  At the time I was teaching 7th grade social studies which featured events in the Eastern Hemisphere.  I taped it and showed it to my 7th graders who loved it (Omar's drama added to the wonder of it all).  But the best part was the filming inside the pyramids themselves, especially the biggest one.  The diagrams showing at what point they were inside the pyramid was fascinating and helpful.
Also, the Egyptologist interviewed by Omar is the same one who provided a taped interview at the King Tut exhibit in Seattle this year (obviously, aged).",1360540800,2,609,4.663551401869159

7840716,2,6303196365,"""Mystery of the Pyramids"" is a short documentary about famous mysteries of Egypt.  This video explores more than just the pyramids at Giza.  Omar Sharif also talks about the Sphinx and Tutenkhamun's tomb.  He over-dramatizes these ""mysteries.""  In fact, most scholars of Egyptology are in agreement that there is little mystery in when these monuments were built and who built them.  Sharif also expresses his own personal views of the pyramids and the Sphinx, trying to convince the audience that there is some mysterious reason for their existence.  Also, he examined the ""curse of the mummies.""  This discussion has no basis in reality, and in fact is just wild imagination.  I recommend viewing this video only if you want to be humored by Sharif.  Don't watch this video expecting to be enlightened about the pyramids.",985219200,4,823,5.037037037037037
