7907218,2,B00000F6XF,"I had ordered this tape, ""Nature's Symphony"", thinking that I would put this tape on and relax to soothing music and running streams and flowing brooks and birds chirping and scenes of mountainous country side. Well, what this tape is all about is not relaxing music and quiet scenes, all though they are a few minutes of such, but action packed scenes of antelope running accompanied by bombastic symphonic music that you are hoping will end soon. But, it doesn't! So if your looking for sounds and visions of relaxation, this is not it. Howard",1260835200,2,545,4.747368421052632
