8342925,2,B000J3EZ90,"Very disappointing.  This DVD is only 30 minutes long, and it hardly merits the price.  The content of the DVD was interesting, and I would have liked to see more of it, but I was extremely disappointed when it suddenly ended after only 30 minutes.  I expected it would be at least an hour.  I also thought the DVD would show the paper mache pumpkins on the cover, which is the reason I bought it, but there was nothing about the paper mache pumpkins.

The quality of the video is not particularly impressive, but the host was good and the projects were interesting.  If this was a pilot, it would have made an interesting show.  But this small pilot does not merit the price of a full-length DVD.",1214697600,2,697,4.3984375
8342926,5,B000J3EZ90,"Mark Daniel Wood and Kasey Rogers co-host this (unaired) pilot for what was to be a how-to craft series, Hands on Holidays. Here the holiday in question is Halloween, and the duo demonstrate how to create a number of Halloween-related arts and crafts including party poppers, a bowl made out of carnival tickets, and party invitations. In between they discuss the interesting history of their surroundings, the Stagecoach Inn Museum (originally the Grand Union Hotel).

Wood and Rogers are the co-authors of a number of craft books (The Bewitched Cookbook: Magic in the Kitchen; Halloween Crafts: Eerily Elegant Dcor; Character Wreaths: Holiday Projects for Year 'Round Decor; Decorating for Christmas; Create a Bewitched Falloween: 55 Projects for Decorating and Entertaining), and fans of their series of books (or those interested in holiday crafts) will enjoy more of their style of easy-to-make, but intricate and charming crafts. The program is just as much fun to watch for the banter between Wood and Rogers, where the natural chemistry and ease of the two co-hosts demonstrated here would have undoubtedly made for a great series. Fans of Rogers (Strangers on a Train, Peyton Place, Bewitched) should particularly enjoy this pilot, and given the fact that Rogers (often billed as Laura Elliot in her early career) appeared in a long-list of Western films and television series (Silver City, Denver and Rio Grande, Trackdown, Colt .45, Bat Masterson, Wanted: Dead or Alive), the setting of the Stagecoach Inn Museum is a perfect match for her (and she even gets a chance to play dress-up!).

The series did not eventuate, with Rogers falling ill shortly after the filming of this pilot. As such, the episode is both a good introduction to the craft ideas of Wood and Rogers, while a particularly poignant tribute to Rogers at her entertaining best.",1163030400,7,1856,5.122112211221122
