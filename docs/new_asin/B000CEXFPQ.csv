8098769,3,B000CEXFPQ,"The copy of WATCHED that I got here recently is NOT the inferior SIMITAR brand SLP speed tape, but a VESTRON label SP edition. It's a shame that more of this ""last gasp of the counterculture"" film aren't available from Vestron, a  superior company.

WATCHED! (1974) is no work of art and SIMITAR, the manufacturer listed here, was no class label. If their product wasn't overmodulating, then the EP speed wreaked havoc with even the best-maintained VCRs.

I bought a few of their tapes many years ago from a dollar store. One in particular was a documentary of the recently-ended Gulf War. Wow, was that thing LOUD! (oy) And talk about boring!

So forewarned is forearmed, right? Not necessarily. WATCHED! is NEVER gonna be shown on TV as it's way-too coke-heavy, and NObody uses that stuff, right? Not even back in the day. Uh-uh, not us.

Whether or not you've got a 3-dollah bill to burn on SIMITAR's product in order to watch WATCHED is a hard choice, fer sure!",1267574400,4,965,4.652941176470589
