998540,5,6305234965,"I consider myself to be Jackie Chans most loyal fan. I own almost 20 of his martial arts movies, including classics from Police Story to Who am I. The Young Master is an absolutely essential purchase for anyones martial  arts collection, which is guaranteed to remain a highly regarded Jackie  Chan classic.  The movie is set during Chans younger days in cinema and  demonstrates his amazing skill in martial arts as well as his great talent  in entertaining the viewer through his humorous performances. He even sings  the song to the ending of the movie. The film really does show how  energetic and original Jackie is, and this is the main reason why I simply  admire his artistic talent. The Young Master tells the story of an orphan  named Dragon (Jackie) and shows how he struggles to set his friend free  from the evil clutches of Master Kam. The master uses his friend to commit  a number of crimes and in the process people confuse Jackie with his friend  and mistake him for the criminal. The final showdown shows Jackie  confronting the Master in a well-coreographed and extremely realsitic fight  scene. This is the first most important movie which catapulted Chans career  for Golden Harvest Productions and established himself as a great perfomer  in all aspects and not only in kung-fu. In conclusion, this is the most  thrilling, spectacular and entertaining movie which I have ever seen, and  from all his greatest hits this has to be the most enjoyable.",930528000,4,1471,4.816
998691,4,6305234965,"Young Master is a 1980 Hong Kong martial arts movie starring Jackie Chan as Dragon. The fight sequences are fast, furious and also funny. Apparently there is a 3 hour version of the movie. Maybe this will later be released as a directors cut. Recommended. 4 out of 5.",1311206400,,267,4.469387755102041
998692,5,6305234965,"This is one of Jackie's best movies in my opinion. It's got a great kung fu plot, brilliant comedic action, and it's fun to watch. This movie will have you laughing out loud one minute, your jaw dropped in awe the next. It is great to see Jackie and his 'little brother', Yuen Biao performing flawlessly together. This is a must-have for any Jackie Chan fan.",1230422400,,358,4.4393939393939394
998693,5,6305234965,"This movie is the most intense Martial Arts sequences by Jackie Chan, the story is very funny,the velocity, the ability is incredible. The final fight during aprox. 10 minutes, that is awesome. If you don't this movie in the Jackie Chan collection,buy,don't miss the opportunity the see this Martial Art Mayhem.",1228262400,,311,5.117647058823529
998694,3,6305234965,"The Young Master was Jackie Chan's directorial debut, and a quarter of a century on it looks a lot less groundbreaking than it once did. In fact, much of the first hour is terrible, feeling like one of those old Shaw Brothers films filled with crash zooms and elaborately choreographed ""a-one-and-a-two"" fight scenes where the stunt men are more interested in striking stances and hitting their marks than looking like they're actually trying to hit each other. In many ways, it's almost a transitional picture between the old formal, theatrical and wildly unconvincing style and the more believable let's-try-to-make-it-look-like-we're-actually-trying-to-hurt-each-other style of more modern Hong Kong action movies. What that means is that a lot of it is unfortunately both unconvincing and dull. Just when you're ready to throw in the towel and are desperately trying to think of who you can fob the DVD onto as a Christmas present, it suddenly comes alive in the last half hour with two great fight sequences - one in which Chan takes on group of crooks, the other a 17-minute dust-up with Whong In Sik that really works incredibly well despite offering no more than the two fighters on Tiger Mountain with a comic relief sidekick acting as referee/second. There's also some fun to be had working out where the film's score comes from. As with most Hong Kong movies of the period, it's mostly a `name that tune' pick-and-mix lifted from the studio's record collection, with Bernard Herrmann's Obsession and Holst's The Planets topping the most played list at Golden Harvest that month. Heavy going, but definitely worth it for that last half hour.",1210896000,,1651,5.073529411764706

Cast: Jackie Chan, Hih Tien (aka Shek kin),Yuen Biao, Chiang Kam ,lily le ,Wang Inn-Sik
Director: Jackie Chan (also stunt coordinator)
Writer: Lau Tin Chee, Tung Lio, Edward Tang King-sang

Compared to a list of about 75 other films, this one holds up pretty well, surprisingly.  This movie continues in the tradition of the movies he made with Yuen Woo Ping (Snake in the Eagles Shadow, and the masterpiece Drunken Master). This is one of my favorite kung fu comedy ,and one of the best Jackie Chan movies ever. Being one of nine movies he actually directs in the decades he`s been making movies, it really make you wonder. Why only 9? When he is really good at it. This is one of the first films after Golden Harvest bought out his contract with Lo Wei (The Police Commissioner in Chinese Connection).

The end fight is excellent. I know a lot about the martial arts and from a martial artist aspect this is one of the best. However this is a  kung fu comedy as I stated, well, In that department  it does not fail. It's actually quite hilarious.  This is Jackie Chan at the top of his forum.",1198713600,,1107,4.482587064676617
998696,2,6305234965,"Isn't it strange?  I love old-school kung fu movies.  I love Jackie Chan movies (at least before he started making films in America).  Yet old-school Jackie Chan films can really be tough to take.  Even some of his ""classics"".  This movie is definitely a notch above ""Drunken Master"" in both fights and humor.  It's just wildly inconsistent.  Though it does have the Korean born Hapkido Grandmaster Ing-Sik Whang.  He rocks.  Everything else is a little off.  Some of the humor is actually quite funny and there are some cool scenes.  The lion dance, for example.  It's not bad, and it is  enjoyable to watch, but not on the level I was expecting for a kung fu movie.  Though expectations will often turn a potentially good movie sour.

The film is digitally remastered and in widescreen, so the presentation is nothing to complain about, but... having Wei Pai and Yuen Biao in your movie and hardly having them do anything IS.  What a waste.  Usually in Jackie's films of this period the final fight helps make up for the lack of substance that preceded it, but here it doesn't work.  The choreography is very good, and ahead of its time, but the premise of the fight is too absurd for them to be able to pull it off.  This does have an option for English dubbing.  I was taking a chance thinking that it was subtitled only.  2.5, if that helps.

998697,4,6305234965,"Jackie Chan had already established himself in Hong Kong as a box office champion with 1978's Drunken Master and 1979's Fearless Hyena, but he was not getting his fiscal due from Lo Wei Productions. So he opted out of his contract with Lo Wei and was hired by Golden Harvest. The Young Master was his first picture under that studio. The film was interrupted several times because of the contract dispute with Lo and a Triad that wanted a stake in Jackie's fortune. This was eventually settled with help by Jimmy Wang Yu whom Jackie would owe (along many other actors) several favors. Even with all this chaos, Jackie was still able to create a memorable and must-have film, though the movie is marked by continuity problems.

Jackie stars as Ah Lung a mediocre student (funny he doesn't seem so in the film and that point is soon forgotten) who loses in a beautifully choreographed lion dance competition because his fellow adopted brother Jing Keung (Wei Pei), faked an injury and competed incognito for the Wei Yee school. Lung and Keung's sifu Master Tien soon finds out of this deception and this betrayal leads to Keung leaving the school. After an impassioned plea from Lung, Tien gives Lung his blessing to find his brother. Jackie takes his big white fan (important plot point.) Jing looks for work at the Wei Yee school, but is turned down when he is found to have helped the Wei Yee school win the Lion Dance competition. He is then recruited with two others, including Fung Hark-On (aka Fung Ke-An who was the martial arts consultant with Jackie) who has a large mole on his face - reminiscent of Jackie's mole in Police Woman, to free Master Kim (Hapkido expert Whang In Shik.) Jing uses his big white fan to help Kim escape. So Ah would later be mistaken for his brother and sought after by the local police inspector and his son (played by Hong Kong regulars Shih Kien and Yuen Biao.) This would lead up to an awesome fight scene between two of the Seven Little Fortunes, Yuen and Jackie. Yuen would expertly use a bench and you get to see Jackie use a pole again.

Even with the continuity problems (even admitted by Jackie, including one scene where Jackie is fettered and the next he is not) and the overuse of sped-up footage and zoom shots (including one that is parodied in Kung Pow), this is a fun film to watch.. The high points of this movie are the Cantonese comedy and the sublime martial art scenes. In those fight scenes you get to see him use many props such as sword, pole, bench and even a skirt, a skill he learns from his encounter with the Police Chief's daughter played by Lily Li. The high point of the film is a showdown that involves an 18-minute plus scene between Jackie and Whang (Jackie in his autobiography ""I Am Jackie Chan"" considers this his ninth best fight scene.) I do not want to describe this sagacious scene too much, because it has to be seen. I will say that I have never seen Jackie get beat up so much in any other movie and most of it is shot with wide-angle lenses with few cuts. Even his solution to winning is unique.

This movie is a must buy for Jackie Chan or Hong Kong film fans. The most important decision in buying this film on DVD is what label/version you purchase. There are many shorter versions out there, even several that are widescreen, but the scenes that are taken out are mostly from the action scenes! But, Fortune Star puts out a 106 minute version that is digitally remastered and has the Cantonese (along with dubbed version) audio. Though there is one caveat, many of the cheaper versions have a huge benefit that the Fortune Star DVD does not - Jackie Chan singing in English at the end of the film. Even without that benefit the Fortune Star release is by far the best version of an excellent Jackie Chan film.",1164067200,4,3795,4.505079825834543
998698,4,6305234965,"I was never a Jackie Chan fan,,,I always though of him as too commercial and mechanical.  However, after viewing this flick in it's entirety, and with some reservations,,I was pleasantly surprized.  I though the choreography and cinematography was well placed.  I really enjoyed this movie,,as it was truly entertaining from the start to finish.  I must admit,,after checking out this particular flick,,,I find myself profoundly sold, and would possibly entertain future Jackie Chan endeavours!!",1152489600,,495,5.648648648648648

I though he performed beautifully,,and not the same old same old.  The villain was equally impressive, with his amazing foot works. He captured the audience's attention from the moment he escapped  incarceration, and was set free by his buddies,,definately a fight scene to be remembered!!!

If you're a true Chan's fan, rest assured,,,you will not be dissapointed.  Truly one of chan's best earlier flicks,,,,would make a great addittion to the collection!!",1147305600,2,722,5.226086956521739

998819,4,6305234965,"There's no doubt about it, Jackie Chan is one of the most accomplished martial arts action stars in the world today, but long before he made it to the North American mainstream, this little beauty was alive and well in Hong Kong. Other than the 1977 version of Drunken Master, this has got to be the best film I've seen from Jackie Chan in his earlier period. The fight scenes are truly a spectacle to behold. The lion dance is one thing, but the actual fighting is just superb. During the scene where the crime boss is released from the custody of the authorities, he delievers the greatest kick I have ever seen. I must have stopped and rewinded about 8 times! The sound is not bad at all, and the picture is not too shabby either. The story and plot is pretty good, even if some dialouge leaves more to be desired. Other than that, no complaints. The Young Master is really something to see, and I would recommend it to those who truly enjoy Jackie Chan's martial art skill!",1035504000,16,977,4.403314917127072

998823,3,6305234965,"""Young Master"" has the trademark Jackie humor, but the fighting choreography is inferior to his later work, and there are no incredible stunts. This movie is for you if you are familiar with the newer stuff and are curious how his style evolved. General fans who like Rush Hour and Shanghai Noon (like my girlfriend) will probably be asleep on your shoulder in 20 minutes. So make sure you have your coke and chips within arm's reach so you don't wake her. But us Jackie fanatics will recognize this to be a fun action flick, just a little more raw than than we'd prefer. Some quick facts you're probably wondering: -There's no outtakes at the end. The audio is Chinese -no English option. I'm not sure if that's Jackie's voice. You'll have to read the English subtitles and that might distract you from the action. There's plenty of those mini-acrobatic stunts that show off his creativity, strength, and coordination. To me, the decision to purchase vs. rent a dvd hinges on whether you plan to watch it several times. I'm glad I saw the movie, but I probably won't watch it again. I recommend you rent it.",998784000,5,1108,4.629441624365482
998824,4,6305234965,"One of Jackie Chan's earliest films, the Young Master is a great example of his burgeoning comedic and fighting talents. The story is of a student kicked out of his school and Jackie's quest to find him. Don't be put off by the old school quality of this film as it is paced fairly well unlike many films of this period. The fight with the fan, the lion dance at the beginning, and the final action sequence with Whang Inn-Sik are three highlights here. The DVD quality is okay, but the film quality is pretty poor due to its age and its storage in Hong Kong. A good triple feature viewed alongside Drunken Master and Fearless Hyena.

Discs one and four (Fantasy Mission Force and Fire Dragon)are basically hacked up versions of the Fantasy Mission Force I had previously seen. The Fantasy Mission Force in this set is pretty shabby and lacking some of the elements that made the original strange enough to be worthwhile. Fire Dragon, with even poorer dubbing , picture quality and butchered editing is incredibly bizarre.....even missing over half of the Jackie scenes.
