7860309,5,6303934943,Mike Bitonio and I were classmates and sparring partners at The Kapu Kuialua school. We had trained hard for my fight but it was still an unknown of what would happen. When I lost UFC6 I trained with Mike even harder. We started training in a cage similiar to UFC but round. With the rules at that time we learned how to work the cage to our favor. I only wished we had trained in the cage for my fight. Mike was a newcomer that wasn't even expected to even hold a candle to veteran Bart Vale's who I've been told had once knocked out Ken Shamrock in his earlier years. We had trained for hours every day and when I was lucky enough to get him in any kind of submission move he wouldn't even tap unless I was on the verge breaking his ankle or something. He is definately one of the hardest sparring partner I've ever had. I'm pleased to have been a part of his training for the fight against Bart Vale. It was definately one of the best fights on the tape. One thing that I remember about him is that he was half my size yet he was as strong as I was.,1067904000,4,1052,4.038277511961723
7860310,3,6303934943,"This event took place in 1995. The tournament was divided in a grapplers division and a strikers division. Whithin the grappler competition there was a 22 min. time limit and a maximum of ten minutes for the ground fight. Biting and eye coughing not allowed. The difference with the strikers division was that there was a maximum of 2 minutes for the ground fight and the participants were not allowedd to win by submission. Strange rules i must say.
There were some very hard and bloody fights. For example the fight between Bitonio and Bart Vale. One of these fighter gets a good beating but refuses to quit. Also you can watch Renzo Gracie in action. In the first fight on this dvd Renzo shows bad behaviour against his opponent, the judo champion Ben Spijkers from the Netherlands.
The fights on this dvd are typical fights that we saw in the early UFC events.
If that's what you like, then this dvd is worth buying.",1017446400,,920,4.581818181818182
7860311,4,6303934943,"Back in 1996, the World Combat Championship introduced to the world a brand new MMA/NHB show. After watching this DVD one wonders why there was only one show...ever. Splitting an 8-man tournament into a strikers and grapplers division was strange, the rules within were even stranger. Because the WCC took place in the ""early"" days there were your fair share of mismatches, but as a production...it was like watching an HBO production. Very Impressive.
The grapplers division was expected to be an eventual matchup between Shootfighting legend Bart Vale and BJJ sensation Renzo Gracie. Renzo's now infamous ""step on the neck"" technique was used, and Vale's first round opponent gave old Bart everything.
The strikers featured 3 notable names: Jerome Turcan, James Warring, and Eric Paulson. On paper, Paulson had the most tools, but really was limited to using ""striking"" techniques. A real shame considering Paulson's a great technician on the ground, especially leg-locks. His hair proved to be his achillies heel though.
Again the card was very pro-like. Real announcers ( a little inexperienced as far as the sport) with good in between the fight segments and stories. 3.5 stars",1013040000,5,1182,5.193717277486911
7860312,3,6303934943,"This is basically an MMA event.  One half of the 8 man tournament bracket is full MMA, and the other half allows no submission holds, only allowing striking on the ground.  Because of this ridiculous rule, a couple of the fights are a lot more bloody and brutal than is at all necessary.  The only good fighter on the card is Renzo Gracie, and he walks through the competition.  Erik Paulson and Bart Vale also compete, but they didn't impress me.  The WCC only held this one event, probably because they were paying TOP dollar to mainly mediocre fighters.  The purse for the winner was $250,000, an amount only rivaled by the Pride Grand Prix and the annual Rings King of Kings tournament, both of which had MUCH better fighters.  You certainly can't complain that the WCC lacks action, though.",1003104000,,795,4.635714285714286
7860313,4,6303934943,"This one shot championship, open martials tournement, is actually one of the better productions to come along.  Trying to ride the heals of the UFC in the middle 90's, this tournment, though not perfect, did match the fighters much better than the first few UFCs.
Because of this, most of the bouts are more entertaining and strategic than many of the other early versions.  It is too bad that this one show was about it.  It never really took off and soon faltered.
Though the talent level was not the best, it was superior to the first couple UFCs and the fights even more interesting.  A must for martial arts fans.",987033600,7,618,4.54054054054054
7860314,4,6303934943,"This was the first no-holds-barred video I bought, and it really was worth it!  Professionally put together, some good fighters, and a hefty paycheck at the end of it all went towards this being one of the (potentially) best NHB events in the world.  UFC is the most popular, but WCC SHOULD be!  Bart Vale, Renzo Gracie, Eric Paulson are just a few names on the card, and I can tell you, the Vale-Bitonio fight is the BEST fight I have ever seen.  You have to buy this video even if just for that one fight.",985305600,,507,4.25
7860315,3,6303934943,This tape is sweet cause it features Renzo Gracie. A kind of unknown Gracie. But don't look for any UFC excitment in this video. But nice if you like having Gracie members besides Royce and Rickson on tape.,917568000,,206,4.447368421052632
