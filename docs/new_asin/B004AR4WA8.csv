8420734,5,B004AR4WA8,"The description of this set is wrong. There are four discs in the boxed set, not one as stated in the description. Each disc is in it's own slimline case, which is very nice.

What is confusing is that every season of Inspector Lynley can be bought as ""series"" 1,2,3 etc., or ""set"" 1,2,3 and so on. What's the difference?

""Series"" 2 is listed at between $30.00 and $40.00 here on Amazon, while ""Set"" 2 ranges from $8.00 to $13.00 (Both used but in good condition). However there is a new set 2 listed for $118.00... Yes, I said one hundred and eighteen. Note: there are only four episodes per season.

Oh yes, and Series 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, which has all 21 Lynley mysteries, including the pilot is priced at $4,267.54.

Something is very wrong here.",1382918400,,750,4.374100719424461
8420735,3,B004AR4WA8,"After reading most of Elizabeth George's books, I couldn't believe the casting of her mysteries.  In her books. Thomas Lynley was very blond.  Barbara Havers was chunky with terrible teeth, an awful hairdo, and mismatched clothing.  Why did they have to change all that for the television series?",1376784000,,296,5.125
8420736,5,B004AR4WA8,"I love all of Masterpiece Mystery items, Inspector Lynley Mysteries arrived in excellent condition and is a joy to watch.",1365033600,,121,5.1
8420737,5,B004AR4WA8,"While the stories are usually entertaining, the best reason to watch this series is Sharon Small as Barbara Havers. She is up against societal prejudices and is under-appreciated, but she does what is right despite have a big chip on her shoulder and tons of resentment. These are gualities that those who desire a permanent underclass are trying to eradicate. In 50 years or less, viewers will find it hard to understand a character like Havers - ""Why didn't she just sit at home and have an easy life on the dole?"" As someone who thankfully was born before the War on the Poor (not on Poverty as advertised) and was able to move up the socioeconomic ladder quite a few rungs, I find Havers a fascinating character.",1358035200,,716,4.6015625
8420738,3,B004AR4WA8,"I was a little Disapointed in the Inspector Lynley Mysteries. Reasons were. I thought the Inspector really lacked a personality. I just couldn't seem to warm up to him. One of the reasons could have been was that I had just finished the entire run of ""FOYLES WAR"" which is the greatest series ever filmed.",1351900800,3,305,4.5636363636363635
8420739,5,B004AR4WA8,"The Inspector Lynley Mysteries Series I is a well written set of murder mysteries with a good cast and interesting plot lines.  If you like Sherlock Holmes, then you will probably like this series.",1350864000,2,197,4.794117647058823
