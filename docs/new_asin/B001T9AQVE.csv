8340830,5,B001T9AQVE,"The 5-part tele-miniseries from 1979, based on a best-selling novel. It is considered an absolute classic in Russia. It will come across probably slowish and incomprehensible to many Americans. It contains some great samples of Russian, which will be useful if you are a learner. So if you wan to learn Russian language, get it! Vladimir Vysotsky, a star actor and singer who used to play Hamlet in Moscow's theater plays one of the two main two roles. He passed away almost immediately after this film, in 1980. The dialogs are written well. The miniseries was based on the book called ""The Age of Mercy"". In the post-war Moscow, criminal Investigations officers Gleb Zheglov (Vladimir Vysotsky) and Vladimir Sharapov investigate some brutal murders. Gleb Zheglov is a tough guy, an action hero who believes that humans could be re-forged by violence. Sharapov is his philosophical opponent. In one conversation, Zheglov's neighbor Mikhail argues with him, saying that only one quality -- Mercy -- can even attempt to fix the crooked timber of humanity. Warning: this will only play on ""Region Free"" DVD player like Pioneer DV220KV or others.",1386288000,,1143,5.085106382978723
