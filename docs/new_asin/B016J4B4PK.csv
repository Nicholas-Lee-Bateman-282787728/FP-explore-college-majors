8736517,5,B016J4B4PK,"This is a film #3 in a series of and by the three teenage sons of the Wild family, a missionary family living for several years [and still living there] in the jungles of Papua, New Guinea. The boys are homeschooled and part of their schooling is making films. This 28 minute presentation features the Wild family [the 3 teenage boys and their parents] enjoying some time off snorkeling and diving near  Raja Ampat which is in the middle of nowhere in western Papua, but is a world class diving resort Joining the Wild family is the Brown family, another missionary family with 3 daughters who have also spent many years in Papua. This is very entertaining, geared for teenagers but enjoyed by this great-grandmother, too. Be sure to see the previous productions, #1, Welcome to Our World and #2, Jewels of the Jungle.",1453334400,3,818,4.680555555555555
