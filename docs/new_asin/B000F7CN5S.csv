2554114,5,B000F7CN5S,"Together with Snow babies, Spy on the ice and Earth flight, this is among the best wildlife documentaries ever. It shows how social and how resilient these creatures are, as well as how loyal to each other, and gives a brilliant insight into how they behave in their natural environment.

2554117,5,B000F7CN5S,"GREAT show, as with their other ""spy"" programs.
These hidden, mobile spy cameras get incredible footage! BBC delivers again with intriguing and even surprising facts about our world.
Note: Their recent release ""Snow Babies"" includes, as a bonus, another ""spy"" program, ""Polar Bear: Spy On The Ice"" and their ""Extreme Bears"" 2 DVD set includes ""Bear: Spy In The Den"".",1405382400,3,366,5.116666666666666
2554118,5,B000F7CN5S,"My gripe with a lot of animal films is they over-anthropomorphize natural animal behaviors.  Heard through David Tennant's wonderful voice, these penguins are alive but not presented as though they are costumed humans.  Love the glimpses into everyday penguin life in three very different environments.",1395792000,3,302,5.688888888888889
2554119,5,B000F7CN5S,"""Penguins: Spy in the Huddle"" is one of the best videos on penguins available.  It covers the lives of Emperors, Rockhoppers, and Humboldt penguins.

While we have all seen the Emperors in ""March of the Penguins,"" there has been very few videos available on Rockhoppers and none on the Humboldt.  I'm so glad that someone was able to film them.  The spy-cam footage is priceless.  David Tennant's narration shows a real affection for these birds.

""Penguins: Spy in the Huddle"" is a unique way to peak into the lives of these fascinating animals.",1393891200,10,546,4.817204301075269
2554120,5,B000F7CN5S,"This was a DVD that our whole family enjoyed. There were humorous moments with the ingenious penguincams, which were amazing. These were various forms of the penguins studied, from an egg to the adult - able to right themselves and still film when, for example an egg is picked up by a predator and flown over the colony.

The film is 150 minutes long and does have English subtitles. The narration and filming are all well done. They cover 3 different types of penguins - the Emperors, Rockhoppers and Humbolts. The latter 2 do not live in the cold artic, but in more arid regions of South America. The program is divided into; the journey, the 1st steps and growing up. David Tennet, of Dr. Who fame narrates, but in his native Scottish accent.

This is a film that can have its funny moments - a penguincam attacked and losing its head by a jealous bird, but mostly it is amazing how these cams were accepted into the colonies and to watch the mechanics of them is astonishing. Most of all this makes the over 2 hour disc a wonderful and fascinating learning experience.",1393632000,9,1073,4.525773195876289
2554121,5,B000F7CN5S,"I haven't seen this particular product (which hasn't been released yet), but I've seen BBC's three-part documentary about the lives, times and contretemps of penguins. I must say that these flightless birds are both interesting and fascinating!

We get to follow the entire life cycle of three penguin species: the Emperor Penguin of Antarctica, the Humboldt Penguin of Peru and the Rockhopper of the Falkland Islands. The two latter live really rough lives, attacked by an assortment of vicious predators and competing sea birds, the Humboldt Penguins even being forced to cope with vampire bats. Another classic is a battle between over-sized ducks and five eagles, with a poor Rockhopper stuck in between! It seems juvenile albatrosses don't say no to catching some penguin meat, either. (Always wondered what albatrosses were eating out there?)

As for the Emperor Penguins, they really do look like strange humans in tuxedo, while their chicks look like badly made toys... Sorry, can't help anthropomorphizing. The documentary shows how the adults deliberately abandon the chicks, in order to trigger the latter's survival instincts. On their difficult journey to the sea, the Emperor chicks are escorted by Ad&eacute;lie Penguins, a different species. Why would one species want to help the chicks of another one? Pardon my cynicism, but I think the helpful Ad&eacute;lies simply want to get rid of the Emperor Penguins from what they consider Ad&eacute;lie territory.

The documentary was taped with the help of spy cams disguised as (you've guessed it) penguins or penguin eggs, creating all kinds of humorous situations. One penguin attacks a spy cam which spurned his amorous advances, while one of the egg-cameras is taken by a flying seabird, giving us an excellent panoramic view of the penguin colony from above!

Probably this year's best nature documentary. This is Penguin Power and definitely worth five stars. Let's hope the DVD is as good as the televised version...",1388275200,,1986,5.255520504731861
2554122,1,B000F7CN5S,"""Penguins!"" is the worst penguin video I have ever seen.

First of all, the cover shows Emperor penguins but there are no Emperor penguins on this video.  The video only shows Humboldt penguins.

I like Humboldt penguins but these penguins are not in the wild.  The entire video was shot in the zoo.  Not only that, but apparently the photographer did not have any special access, so it was shot from outside the enclosure using consumer grade video equipment.  The camera quality is poor and the entire video was shot on a single visit.  There is no narration or sound from the penguin exhibit.  The only sound is some really lousy music.

This is one of the cheesiest videos I have ever seen.  Do not buy this video!",1381968000,,718,4.5390625

Growing Up:, rather than what others had stated such as ""Emperors"". If anyone can clear up the confusion or direct me to the DVD that does actually have the Emperors, etc. I'd appreciate it!",1451865600,,345,4.242424242424242

2554131,5,B000F7CN5S,"A documentary about penguins. Narrated by David Tennant... Need I say more?

In case you do, please understand it was done quite well. The use of the animatronic cameras has given us a much closer look at the penguin colonies, specifically the emperor, rockhopper and humboldt penguins. It's rather interesting to witness, compare and contrast their journeys from mate selection, to breeding, to raising their chicks.",1441929600,,417,5.318181818181818
2554132,5,B000F7CN5S,"I got this as a present for my wife, who as been to Antarctica and saw the penguins nose-to-beak, as it were.

We watched it together.  She loved it, and so did I.

The use of hidden cameras greatly enhanced the presentation, being up close and personal moreso than other similar flicks I've seen.

Marvelous entertainment for all ages.  A bit of sadness, as is to be expected in any accurate view of the animal kingdom, but minimal.

The only negative (if that) is that the ambient audio is a bit louder than it needs to be, sometimes overpowering the narrative.

Buy it.  You'll definitely enjoy it.",1435363200,,601,4.5514018691588785
2554133,5,B000F7CN5S,"I had watched some of this with my 11 year old daughter when it aired on PBS. She loved it!! It was great to see the segments that we had missed on television.

I think we have watched it together at least ten times now. Uplifting. Funny. Poignant. Fun music. Perfect narration (so glad they retained David Tennant's original narration for the US region version... wouldn't be the same without his voice). Only wish it had been available in BluRay.",1420243200,,415,5.117647058823529

2554151,5,B000F7CN5S,Love this video.  Watching and hearing the penguins when they thought no one was about them was a wonderful thing. The cameras in the robots gave beautiful pictures.  Watching the quirky robots be accepted into the flock was cool.  Seeing an penguin female fighting the one robot for her beau was cool.  Bought more copies for gifts.  Captivated the students in the classrooms as well.,1419811200,,385,4.861538461538461
