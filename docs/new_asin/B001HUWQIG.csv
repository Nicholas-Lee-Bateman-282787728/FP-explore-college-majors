8588109,4,B001HUWQIG,"I really enjoyed Garden State and the extras on the DVD are funny--have to check the bloopers.  The movie itself was invigorating and all the characters were wonderful and when I rented this from the library, I wasn't sure if it was going to be a decent movie.  I was completely wrong.  I am glad I bought it w/ the combo You and Everyone We Know.  That one is a bit strange, but good as well.  I have the soundtrack to Gardent State, excellent!  I just love Natalie Portman's character in this movie, she plays it well and so believable!  Rent it first, not everyone I know liked it, but I thought it was great!",1266105600,6,612,4.269565217391304
