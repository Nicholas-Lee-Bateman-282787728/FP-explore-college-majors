8071464,3,B000A0GXL0,"As with many of these older recordings the process of converting themn to DVD isn't a smaooth path.  My copy of this has the note wobble you can somtimes get as notes are held unwaveringly at a pitch and as a result show up the inconsistent recording speeds.  It's not a deal breaker but as these DVD's aren't cheap it's not a great reflection on the quality standards of the manufacturer (whoever that was - can you imagine being on the recieving end of this process at Homespun and being stuck with these?).

However on the the content.  The usual very high standard of Steve Kaufman that's making him an institution in this field of flatpicking DVDs and publications.  All the songs are really nice and performable.  The tunes are all transcribed to a little book - better when scanned and enlarged.  (Would have been even better as a PDF - but producers seem reluctant to do this as they assume we'd all email their product everywhere - poeple do - but there must be a better way of supplying music in full size format)

So, overall a good mark - teaching excellent, songs excellent, content and value excellent, quality of this recording not excellent.  Frankly it would probably be easier to update the session and just re-record it.  The process is so cheap nowadays.

I bought s/h from someone.  I'd baulk at paying full price for this considering the recording quality.  But all the content is there so I'm happy to make adjustments to my expectations.",1261008000,,1461,4.638132295719845
