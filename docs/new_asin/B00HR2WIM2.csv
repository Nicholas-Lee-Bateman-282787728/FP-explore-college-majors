6199139,4,B00HR2WIM2,"Seasons 3 & 4 brings lots of change to Walton's Mountain on The Waltons. Season three starts off with a two hour rowder keg of an episode when kin of the Waltons are being forced off their land by developers building a new highway on the mountain.  John-Boy (Richard Thomas) starts college at Boatwright and faces the challenges of college life including being involved in a cheating scandal with a football player he is tutoring, gets involved in a dance marathon (ala They Shoot Horses, Don't They?) and gets duped in a book publishing scheme.  John, Sr. (Ralph Waite) takes off for a job in Norfolk leaving the family for a spell and then takes out a loan for faster equipment to expand the mill business.  Grandma (Ellen Corby) & Grandpa (Will Geer) move out after feeling neglected and Grandpa faces mortality after having a heart attack. Storekeeper Ike Godsey (Joe Conely) courts Walton cousin Corabeth (Ronnie Claire Edwards) and they end up getting married). Jason (Jon Walmsley) decides he wants to pursue music as a career against his father's wishes and John & Olivia (Michael Learned) renews their wedding vows after 20 years.  Season four involves more of John-Boy's adventures at Boatwright, Mary Ellen (Judy Norton) decides she wants to go to nursing school but finds out that Walton's Mountain school hasn't prepared her as well as she thought but learns there's more to being a nurse than just taking care of people.  The Walton's mill must face a new challenge of a rival mill, Jim-Bob (David W. Harper) learns the surprising news that he had a twin brother who died at birth, Olivia gets a job at a dress shop and Grandma and Grandpa come down on different sides of an old house that is slated to be torn down.  The two biggest events of season four are the fire that badly damages the Waltons home and forces the family to be temporarily separated and John-Boy buys a printing press and plans on keeping the local paper going.",1415664000,3,1947,4.711764705882353

8634589,5,B00HR2WIM2,It has been wonderful to experience the Walton's all over again with my own children. It has been really good for them to see the issues that arose during the depression and how it affected so many families -- rich and poor. My kids get a glimpse of what life is like living in a rural area and the struggles that face a large family. It's a good change of pace from today's self-absorbed tv characters!,1419724800,,403,4.315789473684211
8634590,5,B00HR2WIM2,Enjoyable TV for the whole family! I love that the show tied in the political atmosphere going on in the 30's and 40s. My children have connected the dots between issues discussed in the show and real life now. Great for history study.,1419638400,,235,4.488372093023256
