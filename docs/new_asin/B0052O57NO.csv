8454060,3,B0052O57NO,I have tried all the workouts and to be honest i did not feel it was a good workout. the cardio is hard to follow and it makes me scared that i will role my ankle or deflate the ball when jumping on it and im only 114 lbs . Its not my type of workout i prefer a more intensive make your muscles burn kind of workout,1484006400,,315,3.6470588235294117

8454064,4,B0052O57NO,This was included with the Bosu Ball that I got at Costco.  It was a great workout. I liked how it walked you through a warm-up before going into the workouts.  It's challenging and provides a great workout.,1359936000,3,207,4.421052631578948
8454065,1,B0052O57NO,"Great for beginners but HORRIBLE for those of us who have done even a few times. SO basic and hardly broke a sweat - sweating only occured when I tweaked it. If you are looking to just begin, this workout will do that but you will be SOOOO bored you might not want to ever get back on it. Try another DVD.",1356480000,,305,3.935483870967742
