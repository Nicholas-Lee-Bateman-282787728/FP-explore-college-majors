7787074,4,B01HHGAIHE,"I love this movie.  It defined my childhood and the way many of my friends look at what a real hero is. When Optimus meets his fate, not a dry eye in the house. Thst being said, the title of this item says blu ray and digital and yet, there is no digital copy included. While being a collectable, I can't help but feel a little misled. The movie is great quality and looks amazing. Be forewarned, if you show this to kids they will inevitably ask, ""why aren't the Michael Bay movies this good?"".  There is no answer...",1473724800,2,518,4.222222222222222
7787075,5,B01HHGAIHE,"Simply put: I love this movie. I was so excited for the blu-ray copy. The quality looks about as good as one would expect a cartoon from 1986 to look. The digital copy they advertise, though, is misleading. It's NOT UltraViolet compatible, but instead routes you their own site. If you're buying this while banking on UV/VUDU support, don't hold your breath, and just buy it on VUDU instead.",1473724800,,391,4.681159420289855
7787076,2,B01HHGAIHE,I have not watched the film yet - but since when do the Blu Ray versions not contain a DVD version as well?  I buy the Blu Ray version to get 2 copies - 1 for the car for trips (DVD) and one for the house - the digital copy helps make up for it a bit - but playing the movie on the car's entertainment system is very convenient.,1473724800,,328,3.6857142857142855
7787077,5,B01HHGAIHE,"This is only a review of the steelbook case mostly. I'll leave my real review of the audio, video, extras, etc stuff for the regular version of shouts transformers bluray.

If you preordered from shoutfactory the steelbook cases are shipping out or should have your copy in hand like me today or before the retail street date (Sep 13)

The steelbook case is pretty good. it is the picture they show u or advertise on the shout factory site.  Plus the case is holographic which they don't tell u. What i mean holographic imagine looking at a card or comic book cover where the covers of each end shine brightly.  Stick it it under the sun or under a light bulb and your know what i mean.

If u preorder from shout you do get a poster as well, but only while supplies lasted.  The digital copy is HDX, so for guys that wanted a ultraviolet or redeem at vudu, flixster , itunes, whatever digital service u like this might be a big strike for you.

Okay thats it for now when I finish watching all the movie and look through some of the extras I""ll make my complete review again but on the standered version (NOT THE STEELBOOK) of shout factory transformers.  Transform and Roll Out

Edit Oct 12 2016

My review for the movie was deleted for being bias, so I give u my full review here and heavily edited so it doesnt get deleted or me being bias.  Please amazon let this one pass?

Okay Tech stuff Now to Review!!!

First off this was made in the 80's before we had HD, 4K, or UHD so of course the quality won't have that Super nice look of a 2016 cartoon or the new teenage mutant ninja turtles 2000 plus versions (not the 80s version) non 4k will look better.

2nd-  ShoutFactory never said or advertise the digital copy would be from UV or iTunes.  Shout even answered hundreds of peoples questions if they were Vudo, hulu, digital versions when transformers was first announce for US Bluray or did tell people on their site it was going to be a Digital copy but not redeemable by VUdu, etc.  Some guys assume digital means UV or iTunes. which is understandable since its a common term used to help sell UltraViolet.  Plus if u look at the packaging cover of the front or back there is no purple label or the usual UV label we see in most Bluray/DigitalHd combo packs.  Just guys read or look for the signs that tell u ""ultraviolet, UV digitalHD , the purple UV label on the front/back packaging. Plus a theres tons of amazon digital questions about this already.

Video-  there are still some scenes that look fuzzy or could do better like the Hotrod and Daniel scene. Like some have said before ""there is a blurry or fuzzy picture at the start of that scene.  I get that blurry start too on my Australian/Madman BLuray as well, just for a split second it happens at the start of that scene.  there are a couple other scenes where it gets blurry or picture quality goes awol like the planet of Junk around 1hr 4 minutes.  Maybe for those particular scenes the master was damaged or original film was too wormed out.  Doesn't matter if u have a 1 million dollar machine that can repair film strips.  Once the film is smudged, cracked, or damage that scene will look crappy on ANY new remastered version.

Still in general I do notice a color difference, less dust,, sharper scenes, much more detail in Megatrons Face,Optimus Prime shines brighter than ever especially his fight scenes and Unicron.  Not a big difference in video quality to me and maybe for some that have my setup or a similar 4k setup you won't really notice big changes.  The color change or especially for Hotrod they really tried to restore his original color or when he was rodimus prime they gave him that much more dark red or very close to how optimus prime looks like.  Not a great remastered  but not a bad one as well if you take in the age of the film, the condition or what shout had to fix and replace that the other versions didn't have.

Sound-  Pretty good overall,  I was a bit surprise they got it to DTS 5.1 for a show this old and forgotten.  Especially if u have a home theater system like me or a 7.1 and up setup.

 I don't hear any or non hiccups from both tracks.  I do however hear a bit more sound effects and the voices are much clearer on the shout factory version than the australian.  a Good point to test is the prologue or watch Unicron scenes.  The Optimus Prim Ride or ""the touch"", was a little better I was able to hear some tires rolling, deceptions  bodies  thump when they hit the groun, but less ""U GOT THE POWER"", center channel.. heehhehe

Extras- In terms of goodies this bluray gets the short end of the stick.  Other than a few interviews the rest is recycled from previous releases.  All the international or japanese trailers are missing, bio files, scramble city,  stan bush the touch video, commercials,  beast wars bonus episodes, a new audio commentary not found anywhere else, the storyboards, and of course Peter Colin and more Optimus prime..  Maybe for teh 4k or tranformers 40th we're see more  or Peter cullen interviews next.  Though am not a big fan on the extras, but I do miss the stan bush videos and other stuff I get to see from my other transformers bluray.

Packaging- other than the steel book case.  Both new bluray editions have a reversible cover, both come in a stand one blurray case.

A lot of good memories here and pretty much still the best transformers movie overall.  I still remember and watch this movie more than the rest cause it was so good..  May not be the best version of transformers bluray we all like but still a great start and hopefully we will get a 4k too.

7787078,5,B01HHGAIHE,"This movie was simply epic for me as a kid. I guess I preordered the right version at the right time as this one coming out on September 13th has the bluray, DVDs and a digital version.  Which is perfect plus I ordered it when it was first announced for $15. Now I see it's already $35. I would still pay that easily for this copy as I haven't seen this since I was a kid and went to the movies over and over to watch it for just a quarter. It was the top of my youth before I moved on to other things.  This movie was truly special and just screams at my memories, when I was young and innocent.  I doubt any movie since has ever been so grand in scale due to my age and how much I loved the transformers. How I collected the toys or raced home from school to make sure I didn't miss the cartoon.  Something I don't think kids these days really understand.  Either way I am glad I chanced upon this and can't wait for the 13th to get here. As I get to watch this and getting captain America civil war at the same time.

When the movie came out(not the Michael Bay garbage, the only REAL Transformers movie) the massive quality increase(inconsistent but still) in animation and dramatic character deaths floored me.  Also celebrity voices, and some cursing!
I have the dvd release, of course, although they censored the cursing!  This new Bluray is a great improvement on everything(and cursing is back, of course) and while you can watch the 16:9 version, understand that the 4:3 actually has more picture to see since that is how it was ""shot"".
The extras are great, especially the embracing of the cheesy(but heavier metal than normal) 80's songs and full synth that sounds like synth(rather than imitating real instruments).

7787103,4,B01HHGAIHE,"TL;DR: Despite some production issues and lack of character development, Transformers: The Movie is one of the best American animated movies based on a television series of the 1980s.

Transformers was my favorite cartoon franchise growing up. I watched this movie countless times in the '80s, and still appreciate it today. There is a sense of  nostalgia, but the movie still holds up as an entertaining experience, especially for fans of traditional cel animation.

The film kicks off with Unicron, an enormous robotic sphere, devouring an innocent planet, Lithone. The robots are peacefully going about their daily lives when Unicron assaults them. Viewers will note the emotional impact of the devastation on the robots, who scream for others to escape, by individual names. The opening establishes a shift in tone fom the animated television series - this movie is not the kiddie-friendly fare served on Saturday morning - there is more violence and darker emotional content. The opening sets the tone for the rest of the film, which is more serious in nature than the playful television series, which usually closed with a happy ending for the Autobots.

The opening sequence leads into the introduction credits. These are similar to the TV series, but are accompanied by an epic hard rock theme by Lion. Returning to Cybertron, the first act is quickly established by showing Laserbeak spying on the the Autobots, who are making a last-ditch effort to reclaim the Decepticon-controlled planet. Megatron swiftly attacks the ship carrying the Autobots to Earth, similar to the pilot of the television series. This time, viewers are greeted with carnage, as the Decepticons decimate the overmatched Autobots, with visible on-screen violence. Some of the most well-known Autobots from the 1980s are killed during this sequence. Most of the victims are shot through the chest, and Megatron fires his cannon directly onto a battered Autobot's head. The head shot is shown off-screen, but the rest of the rampage is prominent, with dying Autobots strown across the ship, smoke pouring from their chest wounds. There are many character deaths throughout the film, including some of the most beloved transformers from both factions. I recall stories of children crying in theaters during the release.

After this scene, the writers establish the overarching plot, and introduce characters not previously seen in the franchise. The movie focuses on new characters, or rebuilt forms of old ones, many of which are gimmicky and undeveloped. Blur moves and talks fast, Wheelie speaks in limericks, Springer is a stock soldier, and Ultra Magnus is filler as a leader. Some of the most familiar and unique Decepticons get rebuilt into stock characters as well - Scorch, Cyclonus, and the Sweeps are standard villain archetypes. Even Galvatron is a stereotypical ""maniacal villain"", lacking his former charisma. Since many of the new characters are stock, much of the history of the older characters, as well as their uniqe personalities, are lost. This detracts from the emotional component established in the early part of the film. However, not all of the new Transformers are one-dimensional. The banter between Kup and Hot Rod is entertaining, like an experienced mentor developing an overconfident upstart (Kup to Hot Rod: ""arrogant young punk...I'll straighten you out yet""). There is also a hint of romance between Hot Rod and Arcee (the two press close against a mountainside to avoid a stream of laser fire, and Arcee says, ""...you better stay close to me""). These relational dynamics keep the story from becoming stale.  The film is focused on the robots, not humans, although the relationships between Spike, his son, Daniel, and the rest of the Autobots are part of the story.

The second and third acts have some great action - there is an escape from Autobot City, an unjust trial, crash-landing on an unfamiliar planet, a pursuit in space, and the final confrontation with Unicron. There are moments that seem silly in comparison with the dark tone established earlier. There is a scene where Grimlock receives a kiss on the nose in Dinobot form and says, ""me Grimlock no kisser, me Grimlock king"", and the entire concept of the Junkions speech mannerisms is rooted in 1980s pop culture phrases - ""test drive new ladies' model without obligation"" in reference to their spaceship, ""offer expires while you wait, operators are standing by"" when referring to an assault on the alien Autobots, and ""don't look behind door number two, Monty. End-of-the-line my valentine"" before chasing the Autobots. The Junkions explain their way of speaking later in the movie, but viewers will be clueless as to what the Junkions are saying or what it means during the first viewing. This trait made their personalities seem silly and roles unnecessary.

Toward the end of the third act, the action and emotional content builds, and some familiar characters resurface. Bumblebee, Jazz, and Cliffjumper return, Shockwave is shown as a commander on Cybertron, Spike and Daniel have a father-son moment, and one character evolves into a leader due to the Matrix of Leadership's influence. The story resolves itself with a satisfying ending that will please audiences unfazed by the character deaths earlier in the film.

The story starts off great, has some good moments through the middle, and picks up again toward the end, with great action sequences throughout. Some new characters are worthwhile, but many are stock characters within Decpeticon or Autobot factions. Also, the story has some cutesy elements that detract from the serious tone. Despite these criticisms, the movie is entertaining, especially during the first act.

The music on the album features a combination of synthesizer-based score (Vince DiCola), '80s hard rock (NRG, Spectre General), and inspirational pop rock (Stan Bush). There is a silly, one-off by Weird Al Yankovic (Dare To Be Stupid). The centerpiece of the soundtrack is ""The Touch"" by Stan Bush, a heroic anthem that serves as Hot Rod's theme. Fans of the film will likely remember many of the pieces, and be able to recall specifically when each song was integrated into the story. The music fits the film perfectly, including Dare To Be Stupid, since it is played during the Junkion segment.

The soundtrack is a decent stand-alone album. I tried finding the rock songs on TouchTunes and BarLink (digital jukebox apps), and was happy to find The Touch was available. The score is well-done, and I would be interested to hear more of Vince DiCola's work after listening to the Transformers soundtrack.

The sound effects could have been better. Many of the vocal parts are difficult to understand, some of which are critical in advancing the plot or dynamics between characters. It was only after I had access to the script, via fan sites on the Internet, that I was able to fully understand all of the dialogue. Some troublesome areas are Unicron's voice (when conversing with Galvatron the first time), Kup's voice (during the space chase), Wheelie's rhymes, and anything involving the Junkions. The muffled vocals undermine the all-star cast, including Leonard Nimoy and Orson Welles. The errors also detract from the entertainment value since they affect viewers' understanding of the plot.

The animation in the film is based on hand-drawn cels, like most animated films of the era. I found the visuals to be appealing, particularly scenes involving the chrome polish of the Transformers, the rebuilding of the Decepticons outer shells, and anything involving bright hues - laser fire, the scientists' flasks on Lithone, a ship exploding in space, the open Matrix, etc. Galvatron's assassination of a character after returning to Cybertron was particularly well-animated. For the most part, the animation is fluid, and viewers will get a feel for the intensity of the combat and destruction.

There are some errors in animation, especially in the early part of the movie. When the scientists' flasks are shaking, viewers will notice a hand flickering in and out of the frame. Some of Unicron's attacks feel rushed as he approaches the planet, like the pacing was inconsistent. A character explodes on the Junkion planet, and viewers will notice unconvincing laser fire and lack of detail during this sequence, which was a pivotal scene. The visual errors are sloppy but forgivable.

Transformers: The Movie is a solid American cartoon with the production quality of a Japanese anime, despite some audiovisual errors. The visuals are not as striking as Akira, but are much better than the televised cartoon series' of the '80s (G.I.Joe, Transformers, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, etc.). Toei Animation designed Transformers: The Movie, and stepped up the animation of the television series to the next level. There are far fewer animation errors in comparison with the Transformers television series, where Autobots were frequently miscolored, or voices did not match the characters. However, it is not comparable to the Disney films (The Great Mouse Detective, The Little Mermaid) or Don Bluth-directed movies (An American Tale, The Land Before Time) of the '80s. Those movies were directed at younger audiences than Transformers, but have more consistent animation, better sound, and more advanced scores and musicals. Overall, Transformers: The Movie is much better than other television-turned-movie films, such as Voltron and G.I. Joe, in terms of production quality and story.

I was a big Transformers fan into my twenties, having seen most of the television series (including the Japanese-exclusive Headmasters), and collected the toys. When I hit my thirties, I decided to move on to other hobbies, but I still feel inspired every once in a while to watch the first part of Transformers: The Movie. It showcases many of my favorite characters, and is a good coda to Season 1 and 2 of the animated series. I would recommend any graphic novel or science fiction fan to see the film, at least once.",1516924800,,10034,5.165538461538461
7787104,5,B01HHGAIHE,"Somehow, I missed this movie in the 80's (well I was 13 when it came out, probably only into boys and makeup at that age) - so when my boyfriend asked for this for his birthday, I was excited to find it here for a great price.  I did see this exact same thing listed from another seller for 4 times as much, so I'm thinking this was a pretty good deal.  He said he used to watch this with his dad, and his dad even had the soundtrack on cassette!  I also bought him a projection screen so we got to watch this in our 'movie room' and it was EVERYTHING!

Having not seen this when it originally came out, I have no point of reference to compare to this digital format, but it seemed fine to me.  The boyfriend loved it and brought back a lot of memories for him.",1516579200,,761,3.9802631578947367

I should also note that the download code expired in 8/17 but they are still honoring the code past the expiration date. what else is there to say about this movie that already hasn't been. It is an amazing piece of art featuring Leonard Nimoy and Orson Wells, this film is a valuable piece of history and should be on everyone's shelf.",1514419200,2,742,4.345323741007194

7787115,4,B01HHGAIHE,"The Transformers THE MOVIE, finally out there in incredible quality. I gave it four stars, though, because they actually could have put out a 4K UHD Blu-Ray copy.  This copy says right on the beautiful Steelbook that it was published from a fully remastered 4K copy of the film, which almost felt like a taunt, to read. That is, it COULD look even better, because the resources exist for them to have done it--which would have been an AWESOME move, at the time it was released--but they didn't. Knowing that they could have produced that and, as such, there could be an even better quality copy out there, then, logically, there is a potentially better Blu-ray release that could have be made. So, in comparison, this looks worse than it could have.

Knowing that there was the potential to put out a completely ""full quality"" physical media digital copy, as of 2016, copy--4K UHD HDR--then, is the ONLY reason this gets four stars, from me -- particularly because, by the time the 40th and/or 50th anniversary editions are released, there's a good chance it won't be in a physical format. That will unfortunately likely be a thing of the past, in 2026.

The movie is nostalgic but also by far the best Transformers movie made -- even if you count the 3-episode Transformers Prime Beast Hunters Movie (""movie"") that was originally shown as such (but which obviously cut to be shown in three episode runs, in syndication, but, again, I'm including it). The cast was incredible, beyond ""star-studded,"" including Orson Welles (giving his last film performance), Leonard Nimoy, Eric Idle (""one of those guys from that quirky British show""), Judd Nelson (while still being in the ""brat pack,"" and playing a brat who matures, in the film, kinda like his character  in ""The Breakfast Club), Robert Stack, Lionel Stander, Scatman Crothers, John Moschitta, Jr., Casey Casem, Norman Alden (Lou, the 1955 caf owner, in Back to the Future, ""Hey, kid! Whad'da do, jump ship?"") and, of course, Peter Cullen (Optimus Prime's human form) and Frank Welker (Megatron's human form). To see it in this form, in a ""home theater"" takes me back to the actual theater, but it's unfortunate to know that it could have been of even better quality, right now, (which won't be top quality, for the 40th or 50th Anniversary Editions are released), because that might have TRULY made me feel like a kid in that theater, seeing it in beautiful 4K HDR -- and a collector's edition of that would have been bought up, at $100 apiece, with just a few trinkets included.

I don't wanna spoil ANYTHING specific about the plot, for anyone who still has the opportunity to see it, for the first time, and those who have seen it know how it goes. It's a non-stop, roller-coaster ride of a film that brilliantly explains the Transformers diegesis and moves the G1 narrative along so quickly that it showed not only the world but also the producers just how iconic Optimus Prime and the Transformers had become, in American culture -- in less than two years.",1509408000,,3016,4.7701149425287355
7787116,5,B01HHGAIHE,"Yup.  I said it.  The cheesy animated movie from THIRTY YEARS ago is better than anything Michael Bay ever did.

It makes me want to buy the soundtrack.  The guest voices are also a warm welcome.  Even Peter Cullen and Frank Welker voicing Optimus Prime and Megatron respectively is awsome too.  The action sequences are epic at best.  The fact that Optimus Prime dies in the film is just heartbreaking.  The HD transfer is beautiful to look at.

For those of us who were part of that legion of sad, sad kids, it's a trip through nostalgia-lane that actually holds up.  For those who have only seen the Bay-monstrosities, now is your chance to see a Transformers movie with a semblance of plot.

7787203,3,B01HHGAIHE,"So, i too, scrutinized this 30th Anniversary US release of the bluray and compared to the Australian Madman release as well.

Pros:

1) i would say overall, they did a good job of cleaning up scratches and dust,

2) The colors are a pretty decent interpretation. the saturation of laser light is excellent ( eyes, mouth, beams coming from guns, fire, explosions, the matrix, etc )

3) the 5.1 Dolby Digital is excellent, better than the Madman release, but the madman's 2.0 Dolby Stereo mix is better than the US releases.. potato/potatoe... depends on your preference i guess.

Cons:
1) The documentary of the remastering was a complete farce. They said they worked from an original negative, but in fact, you can BLATENTLY tell this was worked from a standard positive film print, where the reals and colors treatments didn't match from reel to reel (5 reels total for TF:TM). They did their best to color correct,because the colors are good, but i think overall, they missed the boat in a major way on a few things. if they had legit started with a climate controlled original negative, this Re-master would have turned out considerably better.

2) The black level of this transfer is WAAAAY off. the blacks are too 'grey', AND this is after i calibrated the TV using the WOW Blurray disc. Compared to the Madman release, it is Inferior in this regard. The Madman's blu-ray release has a superior black level, dialed right in where it needs to be. in order to match the madman's black level, i had to turn the contrast up to nearly 100, and turn the brightness down to 15. normally when the TV is calibrated perfectly, the contract is at 75, and the brightness at about 45

3) sharpness is sort of all over the place on this Transfer. This is not not an error on the film print though, as i can tell upon close scrutiny, that sometimes the film is just out of focus, because the film grain itself blurs at times in certain scenes. the one exception is the Hotrod and Daniel gone fishing scene, where it's obvious a standard positive print was used, NOT the original, or even a working negative print. That scene IS a film print error. WHomever was mastering this, really sped through the autofocus procedure when taking the pictures of each individual frame, and probably didn't wear their glasses when they did it. Compared the Madman release, the Madman release is consistent and superior to the US release in regards to sharpness.

4) complete lack of extras... they re-used old extras from the 20th anniversary DVD, LAME.

5) a few scenes, such as the aforementioned 'Gone Fishing' scene with Hot Rod and daniel, have double imaging/bluring real bad. This is not in the original Rhino DVD release, not is it in the old school FHE VHSrelease, yet another easy tell that the original negative was NOT used to remaster this.",1477612800,,2828,4.685483870967742

7787206,3,B01HHGAIHE,"The movie itself is great, and with it I have no problems; however, the special features leave a LOT to be desired. I felt that, given that Blu-rays can hold a lot more information than a DVD, that Shout! Factory should have given The Transformers: The Movie the royal treatment in this 30th Anniversary release of the film. Madman entertainment put out this movie on Blu-ray in Australia, and had some material that would've been awesome to include, such as the UK opening of the movie, as well as the UK ending. There was an interview with Peter Cullen (Optimus Prime's voice), as well as Stan Bush's ""The Touch"" clip, and a commentary that could've gone into this release, and I feel that Shout! did a halfway job with the extras (to avoid using a swear word). It may be o.k. for some people, who never got the 2 DVD package which came out for TF:TM's 20th Anniversary release, but for everyone else it will likely be very disappointing. Note: In that 2 Blu-rays are used, they put the exact same features on both Blu-rays! So, if you're looking for extras, expect to be let down; if you only want the movie, you may be satisfied.",1477440000,10,1133,4.504854368932039

7787210,5,B01HHGAIHE,"This review is for the 2016 release.
I admit it--this is a completely subjective review. This is not a 5-star movie, but for kids who grew up at the same time I did, it was a 5-star experience. The first time I watched this, in 1986 I think, it was the coolest thing ever. I laughed...I cried...I got to hear profanity in a kids' cartoon movie, not once but twice!
Admittedly, some of it is a little doofy...like, say, the Junkion Musical Revue sequence. But even today, there's a lot to admire. The filmmakers really wanted to expand the mythology, and took some risks. This movies sees the death of 4 major characters (if you count Starscream as a major character), and only two of them get brought back to life! The beloved heroic character (and probably the best selling toy) Optimus Prime gets an emotional death and doesn't get brought back through some deus ex machina. Ultra Magnus gets blown to bits, but is later rebuilt by the Junkions. Megatron ""dies"" but gets reborn as Galvatron, who then blows Starscream to bits. Finally, Unicron gets his dang HEAD blown off, which becomes a moon for Cybertron. Heavy stuff for little kids! Also, let us not forget...Judd Nelson, Robert Stack, Leonard Nimoy! And Orson Wells. ...Orson. Freaking. Wells.

The modern-day Transformers movies are garbage, but this low-budget, toy-inspired animated movie unexpectedly has a lot of heart. I don't know what inspired the filmmakers to do something special with this movie instead of making it just a 90-minute episode of the show, but I'm glad they had the inspiration and I'm glad the producers had an open mind.

For this particular release, I'm really quite amazed at the quality of the special features, even though some of them have been on previous releases. For a movie that got poor reviews and lost money at the box office, this release was given a lot of love.",1477094400,19,1864,4.75

7787214,5,B01HHGAIHE,"This is pure, mainlined nostalgia.  It doesn't hold up as well when viewed through middle-aged, jaded and cynical eyes.  Very few children's products from the 80's do.  But you can read all about the nitpicks, the controversial genocide of the G1 Transformers for the sake of introducing new toys and the rest elsewhere.  For those that just want to relive the awe and splendor of Transformers cranked up to 11 on the big screen, this is THE release:  Fully restored, 1080p, widescreen.  It just doesn't get any better than this.

I haven't had a chance to review the extras, but considering the distinct lack of extras in prior releases, this is nothing but a bonus.

The icing on the cake, however, is the digital download option.  With Shout Factory, they don't give you the ""privilege"" of streaming your movie from some crappy service like Vudu.  No...  They give you DRM-free MP4 files in whatever resolution you desire.  Yours to keep and make as many copies as you need for your various mobile devices, desktops and set-top boxes.  If Shout goes under, I don't ever have to worry about losing access to my movies.  If I'm some place that doesn't have internet access, it doesn't matter -- I can play the file I downloaded to my device without having to login to a service.  It's beautiful!  Shout deserves 5 stars just for this and if this is standard for their releases, you can bet I'll be buying more Shout editions in the near future.

Oh, and the steelbook case is magnificent.  It fits with my regular cases just fine, as well.  Unlike steelbooks for the past (Akira Special Edition, I'm looking at you!), this one won't stick out like a sore thumb or require special shelving/storage considerations.",1476489600,,1713,4.726351351351352

As for the movie itself, the transfer seems pretty spot on. The color is amazing and this is NOT the edited version of the film. Spike does in fact say 'oh s***' in this. The downside of this is that Shout Factory has no idea what year we live in and instead of offering a true digital version of the film we care given a download code for the movie. For whatever reason the downloaded movie will not transfer to a usb drive so unless you have 5gb to spare on your phone or tablet you're pretty much SOL on this.",1476144000,,627,4.181818181818182

This steelbook version is great, but I gave it 4 stars because I wish they would have provided a digital download of the movie.  Maybe I'm mistaken, but the digital code provided only allows me to stream the movie on my mobile device.

There is a subtle to noticeable difference in picture quality between the blu-ray and dvd versions - depending on the scene.  If you're expecting animation with deep and rich color as you would find in today's cartoons then you might be disappointed.  I watch the blu-ray version on my 4k tv, with upscaling, and for the most part it looks slightly better than the dvd version.  Unless you're really attentive, you're not going to notice much of a difference.

I now have the VHS, DVD regular and 20th anniversary editions, and this 30th anniversary steelbook version.  I have no regrets and would recommend it to others.  It also helps that I pre-ordered the item and got it for $19.99.",1475625600,2,1016,4.631284916201118
7787224,5,B01HHGAIHE,"I really wanted a Blu Ray edition for Transformer The Movie for a long time and when I heard about this 30th anniversary edition I got excited. (None spoilers for those who haven't seen this great movie.)

The movie: When this movie came out in the 80s. I was just only a kid, and for a cartoon of that time period it had allot a mature themes for a children's cartoon. As an adult, the story still holds up however parts of it seem a little bit cheesy, but I still love it!

Picture Quality: This is the best version of Transformes The movie I've seen to date. It's the most clear and sharpest I've seen. The colors are crisp and closet to the original film cells we can get. Watching it again in HD I noticed details in the movie that I never saw back in the 80s and from the old VHS version of the movie. This Blu Ray comes with both Widescreen and Pan & Scan version which is cool.

Sound Quality: This movie has allot of famous stars lending their voices to the movie. Peter Cullen iconic voice of Optimus Prime and his famous line in the movie ""One shall stand, one shall fall,"" brings the kid out of me. Leonard Nemoy, Robert Stack and Orson Welles are some A class stars and they do and amazing job lending their voices to this movie.
The amazing 80s rock music sounds even better in this Blu Ray release. When watching the movie I can't help but sing along to songs like ""Dare,"" and the rock version of The Transformer theme.

Nitpicking: For this Limited Edition I was hoping for at least an art booklet or a poster. It just comes with a steal book case and 2 Blu Ray disc.

Conclusion: I recommend this Blu Ray version to all Transformer fans out there.",1475452800,3,1664,4.253164556962025

7787233,5,B01HHGAIHE,"Ah yes, Transformers: The Movie. It's funny looking back now, considering I saw this movie back when I was 6 years old (No, I'm not one of the early fans from the 80's, I actually had a VHS copy back in the early 2000's) yet it was the first live action Michael Bay film that would trigger my love for the never ending war between the heroic Autobots and the evil Decepticons. I saw Michael Bay's first movie in the summer of 2007, and for the next year or two all I could eat, live, and breathe was Transformers. Fast forward several years and I begin to despise Michael Bay's movies due to their over the top action, dumb plots, and unfaithfulness to source material.

Soon I'd begin to rewatch the original movie from the 80's. Ever since then, I've rewatched Transformers: The Movie over and over. As of now, the G1 art style and story are my absolute favorite out of any of the Transformer universes. Transformers: The Movie is EPIC as hell. This movie had the balls to do what no other kids movie would do. It killed off several Autobot characters in the beginning as if this was a real war where lives were absolutely vulnerable to the face of death. The scene where the Decepticons board the Autobot space shuttle and mercilessly shoot down Ratchet, Ironhide, Prowl, and Brawn while blaring the heavy metal 80's song ""Instruments of Destruction"" is all in all a perfect representation of the Decepticon personality.

Besides that, we've got Optimus Prime getting killed off, Starscream's theatrical death in front of all the other Decepticons, and the beginning scene of Unicron devouring an ENTIRE planet full of innocent robotic lifeforms. This film is pretty dark for a kids movie, and the fact that i can accomplish so much more than the entire saga of Michael Bay films shows just how timeless and classic it really it is.

I also can't believe how long it took for this film to finally get to Blu-ray in the United States! Its deserved this release for so long. Do yourself a favor and get it because the new restorations done to the film do it so much justice.",1474761600,8,2075,4.57258064516129

7787237,3,B01HHGAIHE,"This review is for the 30th Anniversary Steelbook with Digital copy.

They provide you with a widescreen disc and a fullscreen disc, which seemed a little unnecessary. The digital download was very disappointing, because they give you a ""VHX"" copy, and not a VUDU version. I've never even heard of VHX before. Call me crazy, but I like to have all of my digital purchases in one convenient place.

As for the quality of the movie itself, they claim on the package that it's from a ""4K transfer"", but the movie seems like it could benefit from a little bit more remastering. You can see a little bit of graininess and dust/artifacts in the picture, which can be a little distracting. Overall, I'm happy to finally have a blu-ray copy of this movie, even though I had a few gripes with the quality and useless digital version.

In regards to the actual movie, I still love it! I was 8 years old when I first saw it on the big screen and I got an instant rush of nostalgia the second the movie started. I watched this at home on my projector and it was awesome to be able to share this movie on the big screen with my kids. This movie had a little controversy when it released with the death of certain key characters, so it might be upsetting for younger kids, but it's still an awesome flick and I still like it more than any of the recent live action movies.",1474675200,11,1358,4.338582677165355

My only problem with the movie is the ""digital copy"" that was included. It's a code to go to a website and download it to your computer (oh, hello 2006, haven't seen you in a while). Haven't we gotten past this yet? Maybe I don't want to download it to my PC, but instead... add it to my streaming service (Vudu). Pretty much every movie comes with an ultraviolet copy now!!! Funny how the movie has ""30th anniversary"" plastered all over the packaging, but they treat their digital code like it's 2006.

Hasbro/Shout Factory needs to make this right and send us some UV codes. Until that's done, my rating will remain 2 stars for FALSE ADVERTISEMENT.

7787249,4,B01HHGAIHE,"Just introduced my 5 year old daughter to this movie. I had been waiting for a Bluray to eventually be released here in the US. The movie still stands up today as well as it did when I used to watch/wear out our VHS copy when I was a kid.

Visual detail is really amazing on this copy as compared to versions I have seen in the past and on live tv. Some of the scenes actually seem almost new because of the additional color palate and level of detail they have put into the restoration. In particular scenes in the Autobot City Battle, the Megatron to Galvatron upgrade scene, as well as the scenes on Junkion are amazing.

Audio is the real treat here. The music comes through in a way I have never experienced before. Background instruments, sounds, and what not can be heard adding new depth to the audio. The vocals are also great but don't expect the transfer to make up for some of the uneven vocoding put over some of the voices. Scenes with Eric Idle and Unicron will continue to be over-digitized and difficult to follow dialog wise (Eric Idles Wreckgar in particular) but this is an artifact of the mixing done by the original artists, not a fault of the transfer.

Lastly the two poor bits of the review, the extras and Digital Copy. The Digital Copy not being part of Ultraviolet or Vudu/Amazon is completely unacceptable at this date. I bought this mostly to get the digital copy and was very disappointed that I can't add it to my existing collection. The extra's aren't bad, just sparse. For a new release, to be missing extra content provided in other releases is kind of lazy. Also it's worth noting the commentary track is pretty dull and lifeless. Lots of gaps where no one says anything and hosts interrupting each other.

It's a great movie but this release definitely dropped the ball in the DC and Extra's department. Everything else is well worth the admission price, you won't be disappointed!",1473811200,,1919,4.53757225433526

Only issue I have is the digital  download is for something called VHX, no option I could find for Amazon, Vudu, itunes etc. VHX was easy enough and you can download a complete 1080p copy but i rather have the option of claiming it on one of the other services I and  most people already use.

Watching this brought back a lot of good memories so if you love The Transformers when you were young you gotta get this movie!",1473724800,,456,4.313953488372093
7787256,5,B01HHGAIHE,"I've been a TF fan all my life.  I love it, and I am so happy it is finally officially on Blu-ray.

HOWEVER.....The digital copy is not Ultra-Violet and is NOT Vudu compatible.  You have to log into shout factories special page to unlock a digital copy that you can stream or download and watch on your devices.  This is VERY disappointing.  I wish I had known as I like to have all my digital content in one locker.

AGAIN....NO UV or VUDU copy.  Digital copy on here is garbage!!!

5 stars for the movie and quality.  1 star for stupid digital decision.",1473724800,19,555,4.310679611650485
7787257,1,B01HHGAIHE,The digital copy is tied to digitalcopyfulfillment.vhx.tv. Not to iTunes or UltraViolet. Also inside of the steel book is a red Decipticon logo not even purple. Don't waste your money or your time. Feeling ripped off and I preordered this too.,1473724800,2,243,4.951219512195122
