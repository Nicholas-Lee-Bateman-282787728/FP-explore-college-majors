3862046,5,B00277NGP0,"Mondo Vision's release of Andrzej Zulawski's L'important C'est D'aimer is a cause for celebration. Absolutely stunning in both packaging  and in the sound and picture quality. This is probably the best place to start in watching Zulawski's unique cinematic vision. A sort of French take on Nathaniel West's Day of the Locust, it features Romy Schneider's best performance along with Klaus Kinski giving another scene stealing performance. I can't recommend this release highly enough. Zulawski is a love him or hate him type of director. Trust me you've never seen anything remotely like Zuiawski. David Lynch is a great director but Andrzej Zulawski is a visionary director. He's not for fans of Transformers or the Reader that's for sure. Buy this at once, you won't regret it!",1275436800,9,779,5.133858267716535
3862047,5,B00277NGP0,"I received the limited edtion as a holiday gift, and what a surprise. The whole thing, inside and out, exhudes high quality. The pacakge comes in a hard, book-shaped case that folds out with a cool magnetized snap cover to reveal an inner sleeve housing several postcard-sized poster reproductions; a listing of DVD scene selections and CD tracks; a thick booklet of fascinating liner notes comes wrapped in tissue paper.

Regarding the DVD quality: Although this rare film is from 1975, the image is immaculate and sharp with rich, vibrant colors. The sound is available in French mono, a German & English dub, and comes with removable English subtitles in a choice of white or yellow.

Next is a separate CD of the melodic, haunting score by George Delerue that has never before been released.  Again, the quality is excellent.

There's also a host of extras, none of which I've gotten to yet, but can't wait to check out: an audio commentary with the director, a video interview, image restoration, theatrical trailer, image gallery.

Oh, and what about the film?  Well, if you're reading this, you've probably either seen or know something about it already. But even if you're new to it, in my humble opinion, it's fantastic. A Euro-cult film lover's dream.

Overall, bravo to Mondo Vision. This incredible release rivals the best of Criterion and I look forward to supporting them by snapping up their other Zulawaski special editions soon.",1261785600,14,1445,4.946280991735537
3862048,5,B00277NGP0,"..more intellectual, hyper-link dramatic madness from Zulawski. This time you get Zulawski's poly-mathematic treatise on love and compromise, art and general lunacy. Italo-cult legend Fabio Testi stars in this baby as a photographer who falls for a fading movie actress played by tragic Euro-godess Romy Schneider, and to top off the junkie-melancholy glam-fest, you have Klaus Kinski playing an arse-kicking (literally!) homosexual actor as only Kinski can - it's definitely 'classic Kinski' many have not seen (I'll have to go back through my copy of 'kinski uncut', to see what his ravings are on this film!)! Imagine a latter period Nick Cave record meets Godard's 'contempt' refracted through Polish 'modern expressionistic' theater and you might get close. But with a classy 70s three pronged acting attack of some of that period's finest actors/actresses, even a lame duck is more interesting and entertaining than say Robert Redford movies of the same period?

Mondo Vision once again provide a superlative 'collector scum' package, worth every cent, from the image quality, down to packaging, liner notes, you name it, but none of this means bunk if the film is rubbish, and in this case it's a great film - you get the Royal flush here!

Mondo-Vision have upped the playing field for how Euro-cult movies are presented to the discerning and quality seeking English speaking cinema audience, and in a depressed market that's a public service to YOU THE DISCERNING CONSUMER!",1259625600,27,1482,5.222689075630252
8354159,5,B00277NGP0,Top quality.  Even with a 4K TV it still looks amazing.  Also I find the commentary superior than some of his other films.,1505347200,,122,4.260869565217392
8354160,5,B00277NGP0,"A wonderful movie.  Want to fall in love with Romy Schnieder?  Want to see how Zulawski delves into wildly different aspects of our society?  And how he uses a story of loyalty verses desire create a repertoire of all our little operas (read 'soap')?  Is it the Eastern European Communist oppression that causes me to see a link between Zulawski and Milan Kundera (The Unbearable Lightness of Being) or Pasolini under fascism where the horrible cruelty of oppression clashes with the beautiful and sensitive human characteristic of loving one's neighbor?  Judge for yourself --- these issues ride with us as much today in our world as they did in the world of those authors sixty to fifty years ago.  Want an antidote?  Consider Riane Eisler's The Chalice and the Blade and her Sacred Pleasure, Vanessa Woods' Bonobo Handshake, The Great Cosmic Mother by Barbara Mor and The Crone, woman of age,wisdom and power by Barbara G. Walker.  By the way, is it coincidental that all of these authors are women?",1458691200,,1002,4.852941176470588
8354161,5,B00277NGP0,"Fantastic movie that demands multiple viewings! While Zulawski's films are not for everyone, they are very interesting and highly artistic with deep metaphors and symbolism.
Mondo Vision did a beautiful BEAUTIFUL job restoring the color, and filled the disc with so many extras... Commentary is enlightening.
I loved this movie and have watched it many times since receiving my copy, and while not a happy film, it's satisfying every time. I notice new little things each time that enrich the movie. A wonderful movie that I'd recommend to those who enjoy bizarre, artistic and philosophical films.",1453248000,,598,5.239583333333333

8354164,5,B00277NGP0,"It's hard for me to understand why Zulawski is not hailed as one of our master filmmakers.  This film is wonderful.  But Possession will likely always be my favorite Zulawski film.  Also, this DVD has wonderful extra features and the presentation is top notch.",1397865600,,260,4.863636363636363
8354165,5,B00277NGP0,"Romy Schneider's star shines bright as the woman that cannot say the words 'i Love You"".
No matter what the circumstances are those words would trigger a response filled with anger.

A scene at the very beginning of the movie where she can't bring herself to say those words
even though they're part of a movie scene and they keep insisting she say them, ultimately
she refuses and loses the part.

She has a live in companion that she is devoted to and a confrontation develops at a restaurant
when she can't bring herself to say them even though she cares as much as she does causes a
screaming shouting match that causes him to leave/

There develops a relationship with a guy that sticks with her even though she verbaly abuses him
This guy gets beat up badly and barely survives. She seeks him out and finds him in this condition.
She then places her hands on his face and says the magic words, I Love You, and the movie ends.",1389225600,,931,4.401162790697675
