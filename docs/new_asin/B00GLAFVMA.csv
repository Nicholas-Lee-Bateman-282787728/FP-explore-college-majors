8624240,3,B00GLAFVMA,"I hadn't seen this movie since it first came out in the late 60's, and the only episode that I really remembered from it was the one with Raquel Welch. Seeing it again after all these years left me very disappointed at how outdated the whole film was. The only segment that, I think, passed the test of time was the one with Raquel Welch. No wonder it got stuck in my mind. Not that I'm particulary a fan of the lovely Miss Welch or anything, but her segment is by far the best. It's funny, cute and timeless.",1404172800,5,509,4.151515151515151
