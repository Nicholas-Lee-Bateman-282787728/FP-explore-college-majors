5933673,5,B00EPV4G9Q,This is an awesome movie that everybody should see. It will open the eyes of all the people that blindly believe on the democrats.,1380326400,36,130,4.458333333333333
5933674,1,B00EPV4G9Q,"I like most that it presents the best arguments against science. This is the best shot at busting science. It is well done in many ways, its funny and engaging. It is a problem that they purposefully misinform the public for some undisclosed beneficiaries, we can guess who it might be, but we just can't be sure. I am most concerned for poor people in the US, who will feel so betrayed by these people when they finally resign themselves to the fact that they have been played. It's very much like the people in coal country are suffering right now. They were promised the industry would be brought back immediately as soon as new administration takes power. They are still waiting, and will still be waiting 8 years later and 80, because they were being lied to then, and they are being lied to now. It is such a cynical business to fool the American public. The rich do it as an entitlement, the corporations with interest do it as a right of power, and the workers who carry out the dirty deeds do it for a silly job. Think about it, can anyone get any lower, even a prostitute can have a better sense of doing something good for society. This movie, and its actors, directors, and funders, can only have the pleasure of knowing they sold out the future of people for generations to come, for a miserly few days pay. Still, this is one of the best movies of this type.",1514505600,2,1372,4.3843137254901965

5933677,3,B00EPV4G9Q,"Expecting a consistent 'contra expertise' of the IPCC and many others CO2-fundamentalism, this dvd shows a somewhat vague opposition to the ultimate great global warming swindle. So, not a bad film, but somewhat disappointing.",1509408000,,226,5.676470588235294
5933678,5,B00EPV4G9Q,I really enjoyed this movie. I listen to Phil on the radio a lot and he elaborates on a lot of the issues and its quite interesting. Those that are Global Warming/Climate Change fanatics will most likely not even give this movie a change but for those on the edge its very nice to see the other side of the story without the media bias.,1509062400,2,336,4.184615384615385

BTW: Why in the world is this video in the ""Fantasy"" section? It is a factual documentary! If this is Amazon's doing, I am embarrassed for them. A very low, juvenile, judgmental, telling and dirty political move. Tolerance is dead. Do not expect any.",1501804800,,390,4.735294117647059

5933702,5,B00EPV4G9Q,Excellent movie that gives the other side of the story - what I believe is the true side.  Phil Valentine is not motivated by money or fame like Al Gore.  He's just tired of all the false climate change rhetoric holding this country hostage.  One of the most interesting facts I learned is that when cc supporters claim 99% of scientists believe in man-made climate change they are talking about 99% of the scientists who are receiving government money to research it.  I love listening to Phil and Johnny B on the radio and I loved this movie!,1499040000,2,544,4.520408163265306

5933708,5,B00EPV4G9Q,"Great documentary. Quality could be better, but honestly it doesnt really matter. The excellent content, comedic at times, made up for it. This DVD and ""the Great Global Warming Swindle"" are the best Ive have seen on the issue.",1493683200,,227,4.846153846153846
5933709,1,B00EPV4G9Q,"I suppose if you don't care that climate change is not only well documented and that we are headed toward catastrophic consequences, then this may be the movie for you.

The climate change crowd fails to understand there are 4 seasons, the earth wobbles on it's axis, and orbits are elliptical, not perfect circles around the sun.

5933712,5,B00EPV4G9Q,Everyone should see this.  Al Gore lives in the most exclusive part of Nashville and is making millions off of his global warming/climate change bovine scatology.  If carbon dioxide is a pollutant then everyone should stop breathing.,1477612800,,233,5.27027027027027

5933715,5,B00EPV4G9Q,"This movie slams the global warming/climate change pushed by politician Al Gore in his movie An Inconvenient Truth, and his limitless number of loyal supporter groups and people. If you know your science, history, and politics, you know your facts. But if you don't, get ready for a bit of everything that contributed to create this intricate plan. The movie provides events, people, and other info. for you to do further exploring.

Lastly, Phil Valentine is such super nice guy, how could Al Gore deprive him of an interview?",1471046400,,527,4.921348314606742
5933716,5,B00EPV4G9Q,"Phil Valentine is a conservative, clever, bright, engaging, and sometimes very humorous talk show host here in Nashville.

5933717,5,B00EPV4G9Q,"The big ""crisis"" of Global Warming comes from looking (inaccurately) at global temperature within the past hundred years or so, and then touting this trend as a huge problem that mankind is responsible for and that mankind can fix (or at least be taxed for).  FACT IS, YES, relative to a hundred years ago, our planet has warmed in a way that could be described as dramatic if one never looks further into the past.  BUT, FACT IS, a hundred years ago the earth was still in recovery from a ""Mini Ice Age"" that lasted some two hundred years.  PRIOR TO THAT, between approximately 1100 and 1600 there was a ""Medieval Warming"" whose peak temperature was over 4 degrees higher than today.  In other words, viewed over the last millennium, the present earth temperature is WELL BELOW AVERAGE.

The second Gore falsehood that this brilliant film exposes is the idea that mankind is largely responsible for climatic change.  FACT IS, THE SUN IS BY FAR AND AWAY THE PRIMARY FACTOR IN GLOBAL TEMPERATURE...all of mankind's energy generated is but a tiny blip in the noise far below what the sun is responsible for!  REAL SCIENCE has recently shown that sunspot activity has been decreasing, showing REAL CONCERN for a huge global cooling about to occur.

Carbon Dioxide is NOT a pollutant, it is an essential gas which plants use and therefore essential for life on earth!  In our distant past, for example, when dinosaurs were present, CO2 levels were much higher than anything near the past 100,000 years, and the effect was a warmer earth in which vegetation (the source of our food, by the way) thrived.

The people that headed up the Global Warming hoax, most importantly Al Gore himself, have a lot invested on fooling the public into thinking we can change our climate and, moreover, we need to.  Sadly, the average American thinks Global Warming is a problem, one that we are guilty of causing, and one that we can ""fix.""  All three parts (problem, guilt, fix) are complete nonsense put forward to make Mr. Gore and his fellow crooks the first ""Carbon Billionaires"" in history...all at our expense.

Thanks so much to Phil Valentine and his many helpers in making this film, it is a ""must see"" for all of us.",1452211200,2,2207,4.701298701298701
5933718,2,B00EPV4G9Q,"i heard about this right when it first came out and wanted so much to like it but Valentine didn't do too well with this one interviewing people we didn't want to hear from and only using sound bites of Gore to debate. I wanted to actually see him debate face to face, thus the rating. this could have been an audiobook. ended up returning this dvd.",1451433600,3,349,4.223880597014926

5933722,5,B00EPV4G9Q,"This movie is mind-blowing.  After watching Al Gore's ""An Inconvienient Truth,"" this movie reveals (once again) Al's tendency to over-exaggerate the truth (remember he created the internet).  It is also backed up by scientists opinions, wheras Al Gore's documentary is only his explanation of global warming.  After watching this movie you can see how the politicians and Al Gore are politicizing Global Warming and stand to make millions off of it.  I would reccomend watching both movies and making up your own mind on your beliefs about global warming...don't let politicians make it up for you.",1444953600,,598,5.197916666666667

Assuming Phil wished to debunk global warming, I think he spent too much time striving to debunk Al Gore and too little time striving to debunk the science that addresses global warming. A must watch if you are prone to confirmation bias instead of more complete research and your scientific understandings are based on politics instead of true science.",1432425600,12,489,4.821428571428571

I was especially tickled by Phil's story about the water shortage in California, followed immediately by the news that Governor Jerry Brown promises to fine Californians $500 per day for taking long showers. The water shortage is generated by tree huggers, who think the delta smelt is more important than the humans who need water. Phil's point is that none of Mr. Gore's ""facts"" are true, nor do they apply to global warming or climate change, or whatrever you wish to call it. He is using it to support Cap and Trade, in which he is highly invested. Did you hear about his business partner named David Blood?

5933773,1,B00EPV4G9Q,"I went into watching this for entertainment value.  I am a high school science teacher and have dealt with this debate and the literature for several years.  The Al Gore film has set the debate in this country and classrooms back decades.  Al Gore probably had good intentions or perhaps was just trying to make a buck on the issue.  Either way his documentary is something all classrooms and people should avoid.  There are many, many better documentaries about the issue.  The fact that a major political figure from a major political party made the film gives it the aura of bias from the onset.  It would be like George Bush making a film about how oil will never run out and how we should all continue to support drilling and refining the black gold.  Liberal heads would explode and with good reason.  I don't fault conservatives for hating the Al Gore film because he is a political figure that is polarizing.  He is not a scientist.  He simply parroted the information that other scientists told him.  So in my mind, Al Gore is irrelevant and I don't talk about him or show his movie in my class.  That being said....

Valentine's movie is very much like a creationist response to evolution.  The creationist will poke holes or ask questions about evolutionary theory and make the viewer believe that these questions give credibility to their explanation.  The fact is that since the mid 1800s the concentration of CO2 has risen.  That corresponds to the industrial revolution.  A simple study of the greenhouse effect and the way carbon dioxide traps long wave radiation being reflected by the surface of the earth and a reasonable person can surmise the possibility of long term effects of unrestrained carbon dioxide emissions.  Most of us in the middle on this issue simply want a balanced view of the subject.....lets put climate change aside.  The drilling, mining, fracking for oil, coal, and natural gas has a multitude of environmental and human health problems.  The issue is so mush larger than man made climate change and Al Gore....the issue is about air, water, and soil degradation.  The issue is about services the ecosystems provide for us for free and are being destroyed in the name of short term energy gain and profits.  The issue is about biodiversity loss and the promotion of sustainability.  Valentines movie does nothing to address any of these issues.  One leaves this movie with the feeling that because there is no man made global warming and Al Gore is an idiot we should continue to blow the tops off the Appalachian mountains, drill in the Gulf, and frack the shale formations until every ounce of fossil fuel is squeezed from the earth and burned without regard to human dignity.

This documentary is short sighted and small minded.  Al Gores movie was politically biased.  For a true understanding of how all these problems are interconnected you should view ""A Crisis of Civilization"".  It puts all the problems into context and looks for real solutions from an objective viewpoint.  Valentine's documentary is a feel good for conservatives living in their bubble....a justification for their adherence to antiquated energy.",1396569600,31,3167,4.887429643527205
5933774,5,B00EPV4G9Q,"Most of what is said here is the truth.  It is interesting that more and more those who want a New World Order want to limit freedom of speech by refusing to answer simple questions.  Also they create a bandwagon effect to try to overwhelm their opponents that gives the impression the debate is settled.  It is sad to see how they are brainwashing the public school and college age students to this nonsense.  CO2's are not dangerous in that our environment both produces it and needs it.  Most of the info presented on this video seems to be in line with new information becoming available since it was linked via emails of how facts were so badly fudged to make it fit their story line.

But I do give pause.  While there is big profit in creating fear and impending doom, I just wonder sometimes if many leading conservatives use it also to create profit for themselves?

5933790,1,B00EPV4G9Q,"First some positives:
1) Before watching, I suspected that Phil Valentine might be on the payroll of some organization or other when creating this film.  After watching it,  its clear to me that he was attempting to honestly depict the global warming issue as he sees it, and I don't think he is a shill.

A few problems with this film:
1)  I was expecting this film to be overflowing with facts, charts, and all kinds of data to convince me that all the climate scientists who think that global warming is real and caused by humans are all wrong.  Instead, I was disappointed to find that the film only had a handful of things to say about global warming itself (I'll address it's relevant non-straw man points below) and instead spends about 4/5 of it's time criticizing and making ad hominem attacks against Al Gore. Not that I care for Al Gore, but Gore himself has very little to do with the warming of the Earth.  Valentine spent a ton of time in the film trying to prank, harass, and making snarky comments about  Gore, ""liberals"", and what he calls ""Dirt People"" (environmentalists?).  He also spends a lot of time interviewing people on the street and mocking them in a sort of Jay Leno 'street walk' way,  or interacting blandly with irrelevant people he found in a book store where Al Gore was doing a book signing,  or Al Gore's security guards (not joking).  Valentine also spends time showing himself getting kicked out of peoples offices who didn't want to be interviewed.  It was simply a waste of time to watch these parts as they added nothing to the issue at hand.  Still more of the film was wasted with Valentine talking about himself, and also playing a song that mocks recycling and environmentalism over lengthy shots of glaciers and wintery pine trees.  So there went 4/5ths of the film.

2) Some of the interviewees in the movie have conflicts of interests:  Dr. Green is a member of the Heartland institute and The American Enterprise Institute (well known conservative and industry lobbying groups for special interests),  Dr Singer (the only interviewee to claim that warming will be a good thing for people) has been employed by General Motors, Ford, and has done consulting for  Exxon, Shell, Unocal Sun Oil, and ARCO in the past.  Valentine is quick to point out Gore's loose conflicts of interests (who is irrelevant to the issue, since any of a plurality of climate scientists could have stood in to defend Gore's position instead),  but overlooks conflicts of his own main sources for his own position in his movie.
It is perhaps notable then that Dr Spencer and Dr. Christy (the two remaining impartial scientists) did not deny anthropomorphic climate change, but simply withhold judgement on the issue.

the film boiled down to a handful of relevant or convincing parts:

3) The first (of only 2 or 3) charts shown in the film,  showing a huge peak during the medieval warming period is misleading.  This chart is result of a single method of measurement (and is the most extreme of all available measurements for this).  Charts that show all types of temperature measurement aggregated together do show a medieval warming period but it is not nearly as pronounced as the one shown in the film, and for those wondering, the aggregate chart shows the average global temperature warmer now than in medieval times (unlike the misleading one in the film).

4) Dr. Singer cites ""31,000 engineers and scientists"" who disagree with the IPCC reports as he holds up a book.  I think this scene is particularly misleading for two reasons.  First, the book he is holding is a book that he helped write himself (the NIPCC, notably published by the Heartland Institute),  not a book coauthored or endorsed or even known by the ""31k engineers and scientists"".  Secondly, the 31k engineers and scientists he is citing are practically anonymous signatories of a petition against government action towards global warming (the Oregon Petition) who self-verified their credentials.  Scientific American did a rough random survey  to get a sense of how authentic the signers were and found that ""Crudely extrapolating, the petition supporters include a core of about 200 climate researchers - a respectable number, though rather a small fraction of the climatological community.""  In my opinion, this scene alone put the film in propaganda territory.

5) The idea that CO2 follows the rise and fall of temperature is false.  It follows from a misreading of the ice core evidence.  Namely: The core tells you both temperature and CO2 concentration at that position and time, and if read directly CO2 levels do seem to follow rises and falls in temperature.  However, these temperatures are of course LOCAL temperatures.  When the CO2 rates are compared to average GLOBAL temperatures at the time of their deposit, they instead support the conclusion that CO2 is a greenhouse gas that causes global warming.

6) Valentine and Dr. Singer assert that there is no consensus on anthropomorphic climate change.  This is true, but only if you don't consider  ~95% of climate scientists to be a consensus.  Dr. Spencer himself on his website concedes that he is in the minority in not yet accepting that the climate change is caused by humans.  His research involves finding out what might be causing the warming besides humans (and it is the results of this type of research that I was actually hoping to see in the film).  Unfortunately for me (and Valentine), Dr. Spencer did not appear to be ready to make any scientific claims to the contrary at the time of filming. You can check his website to see the latest (he is still looking, and if you can sort through the snarky parts of his blog, he also helpfully states why he is still looking).

7) Valentine puts forth the claim that the Earth is not really warming but actually cooling.  For this he cites 3 things:  An article from ""The Register"", a quote from a political commentator, namely: ""it's the sun, stupid"", and shows Dr. Christy basically saying that this could be possible but unverifiable because the data is very noisy year to year and 10 years is too small a sample to draw any conclusion.  For those who already believe this, I suppose you might just bob your head in agreement.  However if you don't already believe this, this is a paper thin veneer of evidence at best, and at worst a laughable attempt at propaganda.  Further,  both Dr. Spencer and Dr. Singer agree that the Earth is warming (they simply don't commit to the idea that it is caused by humans) and therefore in this sense the film contradicts itself but succeeds in muddying the water (which I presume is one of the goals of the film?).

I am a bit hesitant to call this film outright propaganda because the word carries the connotation of a willful intent to mislead or deceive and I don't think Valentine set out to do this.  However I do think Valentine wholly lacks scientific critical thinking skills and ended up creating a right-wing version of a 9/11 truther inside-job film.

I was, at a minimum, hoping that I could point to this movie as the definitive argument for denying anthropomorphic climate change and perhaps have a debate with someone about it's points.  Instead, I will simply recommend Phil Valentine and supporters to closely study and internalize the wikipedia entry for ""List of fallacies"" so in the future they can better sort out information from irrelevant or incorrect nonsense.",1392854400,27,7454,4.808477237048666

While not as slick as Al Gore's movie, which had millions of dollars backing it, Mr. Valentine stacks up the facts to assert that there is no consensus on global warming and/or climate change.  Indeed, it is only a consensus in the minds of people like Al Gore, who have millions of dollars invested in the propaganda and have their hands deep into the pockets of the American tax payers.

I highly recommend another video, which can be seen on you tube, currently.  It is entitled, ""The Great Global Warming Swindle"".  This was made in Britain a few years back.

5933812,5,B00EPV4G9Q,I was actually a believer in climate change years ago until I started thinking for my self and doing a little research.

5933814,5,B00EPV4G9Q,"The only problem I have with this ""film"" is that it's very difficult to watch with my head buried so deep up my own rear-end. I find it's much easier to believe the 3% of ""scientists"" who have been paid by the oil and gas lobbies because it requires absolutely NO effort on my part to change. These corporate ""scientists"" tell me that I should just keep doing what I been doing and everything will be fine. I like that. I can keep driving the same car and using the same light bulbs, because I really don't have the intellectual depth to understand the severity of the problems we face.

Sure, 97% of scientists have said that climate change is a real, man-made problem and the consequences are severe, but what does that really mean? I dunno. Is 97% a lot?? I know that it's really cold outside my house right now, so global warming is fake. As I said, I'm not bright and can't be bothered to understand the difference between climate and weather.

Anyway, this documentary is just perfect. I love it.",1389139200,,1002,4.440217391304348

If you haven't made up your mind, you definitely should take a look. The principal establishes his environmental bona fides at the outset, and I think he does a credible (but not exhaustive) job in giving us a frank view of Al Gore and the his side of the story. He also exposes something that bothers me, and that is the public's acceptance of an opinion trumpeted by the press and public officials without having any idea about the underlying facts used to form that opinion. That's no real surprise, but it's fun to see people asked if they believe in global warming and then admit they have no idea why.

PROS: A refreshing effort to demonstrate skepticism of an accepted public opinion.

CONS: Expensive; there are better videos and speeches on YouTube (and they're free).

I wasn't able to attend one of his Theater screenings, so I patiently waited for him to release his DVD. As soon as I got paid I purchased his DVD and watched it as soon as I got it. One more thing, the shipping was incredibly fast-first class, I got it 2 days after I placed the order. As far as the documentary, it is well Phil Valentine filled with loads of information, graphs, experts, interviews, etc. There were parts that were very comical at times too, such as the security guard at the Al Gore book signing, and the people he interviewed around downtown Nashville.

5933881,5,B00EPV4G9Q,"My wife and I both watch Al Gore's ""An Inconvenient Truth"" on Sunday, October 6th and then we watched Phil Valentine's ""An Inconsistent Truth"" on Monday, October 7th.  I will happily share my findings between both the movies.  Few teasers (very mild giveaways) on each follow...

An Inconvenient Truth:
1) Al Gore presented some interesting statistics.  His carbon-to-temperature ratio was alarming, intriguing, and off the charts.  In my opinion, it swayed me most to wonder ""man's effect"".
2) Al presented facts about how water basins rapidly melted the Antarctic.  This was compelling to me, however, I was very skeptical.  I thought to myself, ""if this melting will put Miami, the World Trade Centers,and pieces of San Francisco Bay underwater, 'why haven't we lost any beaches yet?'""  Seems like a beach or a building would fall underwater before Miami goes...
3) Al offered other examples of the global warming's effect. I will leave it at that...

An Inconsistent Truth:
1) The first thing I was able to notice was that Al had much more to spend on the production.  Phil's production is good, but Al's is very professional.  There is a difference in production quality.
2) From the beginning, I noticed a slightly different tone in Phil's production.  First, Phil used multiple (6+) resources and various Ph. D.'s to explain his position.  From what I remember, Al was proud to be his own expert.
3) Phil has much evidence to counter what was presented in Al Gore's ""An Inconvenient Truth"".  For one, the mini Ice-Age lasting until the Civil War.  Second, what would you expect after an Ice Age - please don't say heating because that will upset Al Gore.  I found it Phil's knowledge along with his experts' knowledge very useful in developing my position.  I will allow Phil and his experts to explain it best.

Overall I highly recommend watching both films to develop your own perspective.  The most salient issue presented to me is that An Inconsistent Truth is based on EXPERT OPINION.  Phil even introduces many individuals opposing opinions and allows the viewer to make their own decision.  This does not occur in Al Gore's ""An Inconvenient Truth""...

I cannot recommend enough for you to be be open minded, watch both films, and make a decision for yourself on your positions regarding global warming.

I cannot help but leave you with one striking quote from Al Gore's ""An Inconvenient Truth"".  Al condemns the warming opposition in a quote from Upton Sinclair, ""It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it!"" As it turns out, THE POT SHOULD NEVER - EVER - CALL THE KETTLE BLACK!  I could never more emphasize the reasons to see both productions!",1381276800,59,2726,4.886710239651416
5933882,5,B00EPV4G9Q,Phil Valentine has himself a prize winning movie here and unlike Al Gore's inaccurate propaganda this movie shows things the way they are instead of trying to scare a lot of sheep who believe anything that comes from the left in this country.  The movie stands on it's own with great interviews and it does so in a highly entertaining way with lots of factual information and witty satire.  My mother wanted to see it after we told her about it so my wife and I took her and watched it again and it was still highly entertaining even a second time.  This movie will force any true open minded person to fully question the scaremongering they have been hearing for years by the global warming crowd who can't even call it that any more since we've been having a cooling period for the past 15 years.  Now they have to call it climate change so they won't be seen as the complete fraud's they are.,1381276800,2,895,4.373493975903615

5933886,5,B00EPV4G9Q,Thank you Phil for persevering when so many have tried to place roadblocks in front of the truth. I love this movie and I hope that everyone gets the opportunity to see it.,1381017600,5,172,4.242424242424242
5933887,5,B00EPV4G9Q,"Common sense 4th grade science. Carbon is life. I saw this documentary at the theater, and I'm buying it because of the interviews with scientists and other solid sources used in the film. The facts about the untruths of the global warming sham are delivered very simply by Phil Valentine and others. Watch it, and then recommend it to a liberal in your family. That's what I'm going to do. They might be surprised by how obvious some of the true facts of the matter are. Simple, easy to understand, and humorous. Hey Phil - did Al ever take your call? They ever open that gate for ya? No. Because the inconsistent truth they are hawking is full of holes. Thanks for poking those holes, Phil.",1381017600,35,692,4.5
5933888,5,B00EPV4G9Q,I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie but it ended up being very factual with some good humor injected into it. It was a little long but it would have been hard to pack all of that information into a shorter film. Very good job!,1380672000,34,235,4.0212765957446805

5933891,5,B00EPV4G9Q,"I was very interested in watching this movie after hearing how well it did in the limited theaters that it was released in, and especially because I often times find myself surrounded by liberal misfits that want to sell me the lamestream media line about global warming and how I'm destroying the environment because I don't drive a Prius. Many thanks to Phil Valentine for not only making this film unbelievably informative, but also fun! Who says learning can't be fun?! I especially love the scene where Al Gore gets called out for meeting with one guy while he was VP that he would later be on a advisory board with, and being asked if he wasn't personally benefiting financially from the proliferation of tree-hugging and dirt-eating. Clearly he is, and this film calls him out in a big way. Buy this and have a viewing party at your home for every goofy liberal friend you have! Give it as a gift for Columbus Day, or Veteran's Day!

The only point I give to Mr. Valentine is his highlighting the hypocrisy of Al Gore, etc... aside from that the examples he shows about polar bears and antarctica ice increase can quickly be refuted / rejected with modest searching capabilities.

He interviews scientists and even visits Gore's house ala Michael Moore. He attends a book signing where Al makes a get away rather than talk about his positions.

Portions of his testimony to Congress are shown, when he is asked if he has any connection to business that may profit from Cap and Trade, he dismisses their question. Insightful and frustrating to see how different positions can be created and dispensed. Says he has multiple houses and one home uses much more energy than other nearby homes.",1517961600,,648,4.785714285714286
