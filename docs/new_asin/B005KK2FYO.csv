8476859,4,B005KK2FYO,"ok this Double set has two films that well one will make you laugh and the other will make you go they did this on 30k and omg it rocks,,,

First up Automation Transfusion and it lives up on title
for a low buget film made in 9 days for 30 k it beats many i seen that cost millions etc... reason this is 4 stars not 5 for the two great films is due to this one, the only weakness this film has is that the camera shakes alot and not sure if it was intended but the video in it feels like drop frames in a video game , when scenes have alot moving the jerky video can hurt your eyes...

but this is a zombie film that should not be over looked ,,, if they did this in normal film style it be truly amazing low buget movie,, effects are way better then most acting is standed but fun.. other downer its only 75 min long and has a cliff hanger for a sequel.

Second film is Black Sheep a kinda braindead style classic with sheep  so move over monkys,,,,
this film is fun to watch  widescreen great acting and the plot is one hell of a classic party film....

All and all this be 5 stars if not for first film having that slight frame jerk and i am so glade i took chance on these gems ...",1481328000,,1185,3.87603305785124

8476861,4,B005KK2FYO,"With their town overtaken by zombies, a group of High School seniors take it upon themselves to fight back and find a cure for the disease. That's the plot, basically, for Automaton Transfusion. While I won't go so far as to say that the movie is one of the best zombie films in decades(like it says on the box as said by Bloody-Disgusting.com), I will say that it's a pretty decent film with above average special effects and average acting. It's pretty much standard zombie movie fare, to be sure, but it's a fair movie to watch for your next zombie fix. I have to admit, I hate how they ended the movie with ""To Be Continued.."". Course, this movie is intended to be part of a trilogy with the next movie(supposedly) coming out in 2012. I know alot of reviewers are saying the movie isn't worth your money or your time. It's not quite THAT bad. My only gripe with the movie is how they filmed and edited it. At times, the camera was just too shaky for my tastes. Otherwise, I liked it.

Black Sheep is a mix of wall-to-wall splatter and comedy. I'd be here all day trying to give you the plot of the movie so I'll just say that Black Sheep makes a convincing case for sheep as the new modern horror icon(just like the editorial review states above). These sheep aren't the garden variety type. They're genetically altered sheep who develop hunger for human flesh(zombie sheep?). Bad thing is that, once you're bitten, you change into one and become part of the herd too. This is the better movie out of the two in this double feature. Whoever came up with this idea for a movie was a true genius. This movie is extremely funny. I'll admit, I didn't think it would work when I read the plot on the box but it did. THIS is the movie that ought to have a ""To Be Continued.."" on it.

Overall, this Dimension Extreme Double Feature was worth it to me. I really enjoyed it and look forward to more Double Features from the company. In fact, I'm going to start looking now. ;)",1344643200,3,1971,4.353260869565218
