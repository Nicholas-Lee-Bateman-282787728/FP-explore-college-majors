1389663,5,B0000520SM,Except for the sensuality in End of Days; I liked it. We love Arnold! Virus was completely clean so it gets this DVD a A+ or 5 stars!,1422489600,,133,3.7857142857142856

1389667,4,B0000520SM,"I've always liked books and movies that talk about the end of days. The end of the world. The Bible is a good example. New and old Testament. The eternal battle between good and evil. Schwarzenegger is given the hardest task ever: to stop the Antichrist. The problem is that he is not a believer. And the demon will always take advantage of that. Now, I got to mention they did make some mistakes. They mentioned the number of the Beast is 666 when is really 616. Another thing I noticed was that they found the answers so quick with little evidence. A plan like this might take years to resolve. I've always had a thing for the supernatural, very interesting. But I can assure you, there is good and there is evil. Whether there is an afterlife or not will always be a mystery. But there's got to be some truth about this. Angels and Demons. Who will win? Language: English with optional English subtitles. Two disc set.  Widescreen versions. As far as the other movie, Virus, I haven't watched it yet. I bought this set just to get End of Days. Bottom line, if you like Arnold's movies, you will probably like this one.",1365206400,,1121,4.441747572815534
1389668,1,B0000520SM,Why they would ever rerelease these two dvds together is beyond me.  Both films were just awful; good ideas gone bad.  The End of Days disk is nice an full of extras but i was so put off by the film that the idea of seeing these extras was not very appealing.  As for Virus its just another comic book movie gone bad with a bad cast and bad writting.  Ive met the director of Virus and the producer at a comic book convention and when they were saposed to be promoting their film they seemed bored and not very interested almost as if they knew they had made a stinker.  The only plus side to boothe films were their visual effects.  Unless you are some how die hard fans of both i say avoid this collection its not worth the price and just shows they have a large number of these discs just laying around.,978739200,4,806,4.134615384615385
7929901,5,B0000520SM,"Absolutely excellent value for just one of the movies Virus was very clever although a bit macabre by the end. And of days was quite entertaining, too.",1526256000,,151,4.62962962962963
7929902,3,B0000520SM,"End of Days is terrific, and really scary.  The rogue element of secret, murdering priests in the Catholic Church wasn't quite as hackneyed then as it seems now, so I'm overlooking that.  Virus is okay.  I think even kids will get tired of more and more robots lurking around every corner in every scene.  The movie can't decide whether it is ""Battleship"" or ""Short Circuit.""  Just like Jamie Curtis, it's almost cute.",1502323200,,418,4.75
7929903,4,B0000520SM,This is a replacement for our dying VHS movies. I hadn't seen Virus before - so that was a bonus. I like the double feature movies,1483488000,,130,4.038461538461538

7929906,5,B0000520SM,My husband and I bought this for the Schwarzenegger movie End of days and it is such a out of the box for him that it works.  It shows a more emotional side of him.,1455580800,,164,3.6857142857142855

7929909,5,B0000520SM,"Why these two were put together i don't know but End of Days is an amazing movie that i watched December of 1999 which made me very paranoid of the whole Y2K thing but it was amazing, Virus is one of those B grades you can watch over and over.",1430438400,,243,3.88
