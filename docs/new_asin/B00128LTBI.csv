8244734,5,B00128LTBI,Classsic! This is a film that resonates to those who like Tom Seleck's western movies. I particularly like this film cause of its story and how he uses a Sharp rifle to its potential. Though...this is one of the many films he did...this one is the best one I like.,1414022400,,264,4.3
