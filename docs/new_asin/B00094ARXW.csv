2263172,5,B00094ARXW,"If you enjoy documentaries, filmmaking and human psychology then this film by Darren Stein and Adam Shell is for you! And, it is now on DVD!

PUT THE CAMERA ON ME is a deceptively cute film. It is actually a complex glimpse at the psychology of children and offers interesting insights into the development of adults and an artist. On the surface this is a nostalgic look at some home movies made in the 80's by a group of upper class neighborhood kids. One of the film's directors, Darren Stein, had access to a video camera and quickly took over as the artistic leader for all of the movies. Sure, these are just some cute kids having fun. But, this is also much more. This is a look into some moments in time as children grapple with a number of confusing issues that all of us face in life ---  fear, sexual awakening, unrequited love, loneliness and just trying to make sense of the adult world which seems to explode all around us. As we get older we tend to forget how overwhlelming the realities of life were when we were little.

What makes this film all the more valid is to watch a young Darren Stein turn into a little general of a filmmaker. It is clear that Darren is running this show and these little movies are his vision but they are all informed by his friends, their problems, the interpersonal dynamics and the general confusion regarding the horrors of adult life. A lot of children make home movies, but I've never heard of or seen children create ""little"" movies about the holocaust, homosexuality, nuclear war and the inability to fit in and make friends. These kids are confronting and dealing with some heavy stuff! This ain't no Brady Bunch happy hour!

As an added feature of the DVD one can watch the home movies in their entirety. Some are extraordinary and rather disturbing for us, as adults, to view. Still, others are just some kids fooling around with a camera. The power of this film is the way Stein and Shell pull various scenes together so tightly with running interviews with the kids --- all now adults and all still friends. This adds a new angle to the film. How many of us have stayed in touch with our childhood friends? These guys have. And, many of the issues with which they were dealing are still running between them two decades later. Much is all revealed thanks to some great interviews with the parents.

Among the conflicts -- a confession of a crush reveals a heart still broken, a very normal childhood sexual experience continues to be a ""sticky"" subject between two of the men, some ongoing resentments over the dynamics of relationships and there is still a member of this team who remains very much in charge and in center stage! Which makes perfect sense as one watches these home movies progress over the course of a couple of years. Darren Stein is a director. No doubt about it.

Stein and Shell take turns chatting with each other from time to time and one can't help but imagine the awkwardness of allowing us to peek into the young lives of these people. This is particularly true for Stein who has gone on to a great deal of success in the entertainment industry as a film producer, writer and director. From the first moment of PUT THE CAMERA ON ME we can see the emergence of a gay little boy trying to figure it all out. We also see sides of the artistic mind and personality that are not always ""nice"" or ""caring"" --- and, this is a bold move for any artist to share with an audience.

There are so many revealing moments, but a few that really stood out for me is a movie called ""Gay As A Whistle"" which stars one of the kids who is clearly also working out the fact that he is gay. Just at the same time as Darren who wrote the movie. In this movie, our little star is dressed in women's work out clothes (most likely Darren's mom's workout outfit) and acting as femme as possible. He holds a ""magic"" whistle that will turn you gay if you look at it. He goes on to turn the football team queer and per Darren's direction there is a bit of uncomfortable sexual energy going on here --- along with the humor. Just the fact that these kids are comfortable enough with each other to have filmed this says a great deal about the bond between these children. Another interesting moment features Darren dancing seductively --- as if to a mirror. We all did it. It is very personal moment --- and full of joy, innocence, curiosity and self-discovery. Another is that of one of the boys who seems to find ways to show off his chest and body whenever he can --- and the fact that Darren's camera is always quick to follow. I'd bet money that neither Darren or his friend could have named what they were feeling or doing, but the power dynamic we normally associate with adults is already formed in these normal boys.

The most disturbing and complex moments involve a movie in which we see a Jewish concentration camp victim being tortured and killed by a Nazi. We discover thru interviews and narration that the Nazi is played by a Jewish child and the part of the victim is played by a gentile child. It is a painfully disturbing moment that glimpses into the darker side of fear and the way children work thru the horrors of the adult world that are beyond adult understanding much less that of a child.

Entertaining, insightful, funny, cute, disturbing and memorable --- this is a film which all of us can relate to on at least 2 to 3 levels. This is much more than some home movies. This documentary captures the pain, beauty, joy and sadness of growing up. Powerful stuff --- and well worth seeing!",1138752000,24,5570,4.452941176470588
2263173,5,B00094ARXW,"Calling Put the Camera on Me a documentary is a bit of a stretch. This is creativity in action!

At the film festival screening where I saw this movie, an audience member stood up and thanked filmmakers Darren Stein and Adam Shell for sharing their film, calling it ""probably the single most accurate portrayal of growing up in the suburbs in the 1980s."" Heck, I know I recognized more of MY suburban past in this movie than anything else I've seen on the big (or small) screen.

As a kid in Encino, California, Darren Stein was a budding movie director. He was one of those twerps who knew exactly what he wanted to be, and would get there goshdarnit, if not by talent, but by sheer force of will. He had the attitude (pitting neighbor kids at each other to vie for parts in his films), he had the ego, he had the means (heck, let's just point out how lucky he was to have a video camera at his disposal), and shoot, judging from the examples, he certainly had a head full of ideas.

Marvel at the examples of youthful creativity at work: There's the Holocaust movie, with one (Jewish) kid giving a Heil Hitler salute, and dragging his shirtless and gauntly made-up friend across the kitchen floor to the ""gas chamber"" somewhere off-camera. There's the nuclear war film, complete with the bright flash of the bomb and crazed survivors writhing on the lawn. There's the one about the crossing-dressing kid who converts football players to be ""Gay as a Whistle!"" Of course, there is plenty of murder and mayhem (with some gross, homemade gory make-up effects), and even some simulated gay sex! Hilarious! Especially when you consider that the ages of those involved was anywhere from about 15 down to 5 or so. [I was excited to see that the full versions of the kids' short films will be included on the DVD!]

Put the Camera on Me revists these days through interviews with the ""kids"" as they are now: mostly middle-class 20- 30-something professionals. You can still hear the neighborhood-gang dynamics at work (they are all still friends), as stories are told and argued, and teasings and fights from the past resurface like uncomfortable unhealed wounds.

Those reflections offer a nice perspective on the movies, but what makes this film so richly funny is that some of the parents of the kids are also interviewed, and for the most part, they had no idea what was going on. ""I told him to stay off the roof..."" says one mom, as we then see a movie of a couple kids scampering across a rooftop, simulating a fight where one kid ends up a bloody-faced carcass on the driveway below. If Put the Camera on Me is not indicitive of the average suburban upbringing, I don't know what is!",1119312000,37,2685,4.585416666666666
2263174,5,B00094ARXW,"I've never laughed and/or smiled so much in my life. My face literally hurt after watching this movie. The films Darren Stein (the director) made with his childhood friends were way more ambitious than anything my friends or I made as a child. We pretty much stuck to straight horror, whilst Darren and Company tackled such heady themes as the holocaust, child abuse, and nuclear war. My favorite part: a little girl screaming ""no, mommy, no!"" in a monotone while her mother ""beats"" her (the little girl's barely suppressed laughter audible throughout). Other parts worthy of mention include the concentration camp ""execution"" scene (shot in a suburban living room) and the ""bank robbery"" scene (also shot in what appears to be the same living room). What makes the film really special, however, is watching a young Darren exhibit signs of being a truly manipulative, megalomaniacal film director. It's sweet, and also a little bit scary. This film is a must for all artists, writers, filmmakers, and musicians who knew what they wanted to be at an early age.",1118966400,9,1059,4.955056179775281
2263175,5,B00094ARXW,"OK - you want to test somebody on how comfortable they are with their adolescence and the embarrassing and maniacal changes therin - then get their immediate reaction from watching this uproarious doc about kids making socially relevant horror flicks in the suburban 80's. More than any movie I has ever seen, the film deals with burdening sexuality and ego in a way that is completely human, never dull, and flushed in the kind of inherent goodness of youth that is discolored by the fear-frenzied adult world where any quirk in youth is accredited to anything from insanity to perversion. Mini-mogul Darren Stien seems to be reaching for a deeper understanding of his triumphs and misgivings as the patriarch of strict kid's world. What he finds in himself and others isn't always pretty - but shows how one can improve and reconcile with age. What does change mean without reflection. I love this movie.",1118793600,11,906,4.8896103896103895
2263176,5,B00094ARXW,"This is such a fun and well-done documentary.  Not only is it extremely entertaining; it offers such a unique perspective on themes such as self-discovery, sexuality, and the dynamics of children's relationships.  I highly recommend it!",1117843200,3,236,5.527777777777778
2263177,5,B00094ARXW,"It takes a lot of guts to put your entire childhood right out there for everyone to see, and Darren Stein and Adam Shell have done just that... it's a really funny and honest look at this group of friends and their (mis)adventures.  The thing that makes it different from any other film about friendship/childhood/coming of age is its frank look at gay interactions and experimentation.  Lots of kids experience that but this film approaches it freshly and honestly -- you always remain aware of the connection these people had back then and still share now.",1117497600,,558,4.802083333333333

8057109,5,B00094ARXW,"This film and the films it contains are remarkable for several reasons which are not obvious on the surface.

While some have decided to specifically comment or pick apart the specifics of the childhood movies, I think the importance lies in the fact that the childhood films exist and that they have been shared.  It isn't that these people, who as children, had some weirdly creative lives, it's that a record of those times exist.  These kids cannot run and hide from who they were (and I'm not saying they would want to.) But it seems that some many people want to forget they were ever children because their adult lives are so much more important.

This film is a window into the creative minds of children.  From the topics of their films, we learn what was on their minds, what their fears were and just how talented children can be.  The film is also a great tool for the study of group dynamics.

Darren Stein: he's a creative genius along with being extremely smart for his age and very manipulative :)",1362182400,,1013,4.532967032967033

8057111,5,B00094ARXW,"Six boys and a gurl have a kingdom all their own in the hills above Ventura Boulevard. A cul-de-sac makes for an interesting location to develop paradigms and friendships that last a lifetime. One of them, having an early VHS cam-corder, sets out to organize skits, features, and documentaries. As adults one of them gets the idea to make this video documentary for posterity. At least half of the videos were still around. This movie is the result. I was reminded of the time my two friends and I put imaginary radio shows on cassette tape. We covered current events, made fun of commercials and played the oldest friends extensive 12"" LP collection. Some was made in total ignorance, but some of the topics we acted out, were truly our innocence leaking out as we planned to save the world from it's own stupidity. Hey, it seemed realistic to us at the time. And so ""realistic for the time"" is what Put the Camera on Me"" is all about. Covering world events, local issues and personal insights as seen from the eyes of the Kingdom of Boyhood. And one gurl (a little sister who admitted to being lost about the whole thing, but was one of the gang just the same). What ever walk of life you are from, you will be transported back to your own childhood and laugh, chuckle and ponder your own issues with the kids in the hills. If you don't add this to your DVD collection, ""it's your loss""!",1203033600,,1389,4.47244094488189
8057112,1,B00094ARXW,"After reading the glowing reviews here, I went ahead and took a chance on this and was frankly disappointed. So much so that I trashed my copy. How you rate this unusual documentary is going to be highly subjective. Take my advice and rent it before committing to a purchase.",1196035200,,275,4.52
8057113,1,B00094ARXW,"I bought this movie from Amazon because it was so highly rated.  It's a collection of home movies revolving around a few boys growing up, similar to what I have, narrated by two of the boys who are now grown.  Half of the running time is spent in interviews with the grown boys either explaining the home movies or reminding you how talented they are for having done this.  I tried watching it a few times then gave up halfway through the disk.",1193443200,4,444,4.325301204819277
8057114,1,B00094ARXW,"This was an impulse rental, and did I regret renting this Monument-to-Vanity stinker. Why would anyone want to watch 2 hours of the boring idle lives a bunch of spoiled Southern California suburban youngsters hanging around their swimming pools and protected little cul-de-sac life playing pretend? Now if you think that's boring, we get interviews with these grown up kids and their parents reminiscing about the videos, as if anybody except themselves gave a dingle dangle how these spoiled brats passed their lives of idleness and self-gratification anyway.

Particularly irritating is watching Darren Stein, who seemed to be the star of this DVD. IN the videos we see Darren as an pretty little boy with a angelic face that hid a manipulative and slightly twisted personality. The interviews with the adult Darren, it becomes apparent that Darren leveraged his control of the camera as means of instigating a series of intrigues among his playmates, to which he derived a sense of amusement. This manipulation extended to his own parents to whom he used the skits to out his gay identity to them.

Perhaps the Documentary does have a message---that the camera is a form of manipulation and creates it's own reality. And may be a source of corruption of the culture. But students of media already know this, and we didn't need this outrageous piece of personal vanity of a documentary to explain it to us.

Does the Stein family actually believe that this hodge-podge of home-made videos is something special? You can find more creative stuff on YouTube these days. These home movies were made by a bunch of upper middle class suburban kids, documenting the sort make believe that kids do all the time to amuse themselves. Despite what the narcissistic, self absorbed Stein family thinks, this is NOT high art, or even unique or creative. The only unique thing is that the Stein father was wealthy enough to provide his spoiled youngsters with a video camera back in the 80's amateur video cameras were too expensive for middle class families to afford.

I'd definately advise you to PASS on this stupid and uninspiring momument to a rich family's momument to their own narcissism.",1189209600,6,2184,4.959016393442623

8057116,5,B00094ARXW,"This movie was one of the most interesting and entertaining movies I've viewed in the last couple of years. It is a documentary made of video clips made during the childhood of the narrators. The, now adult, narrators provide explanation for this collection of videos. The wonderful thing is that there seems to be very little censorship of their material. The honesty and openness with which they share their childhood videos is somewhat surprising seeing as most people would be too embarrassed to be so open. The result is a realistic portrayal of childhood in the 1980's. They remind me a lot of kids I knew when I was growing up. But, allow me to repeat myself for the sake of emphasis, the surprising thing isn't so much what the kids do on video, but the fact that these videos wound up being shared with the general public. I see a lot of value in this sort of presentation, but I also fear that some people might find it disturbing. With the increased availability of video equipment, could there be more of this sort of thing in the future?",1148169600,26,1050,4.560846560846561
