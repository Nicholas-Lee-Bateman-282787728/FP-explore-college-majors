8732566,5,B000BFH2EQ,My children love watching this video and singing along with the songs. My son learned his ABC's from watching the Boulder Buddie's search for the alphabet. The DVD has bright and engaging animation that really grabs his attention and he always asks to watch it again. I have given this DVD as gifts and I always hear positive feedback afterwards.,1335571200,,346,4.783333333333333
8732567,2,B000BFH2EQ,The shipping was extremely fast. And I have nothing bad to say about the seller. But the product was not what I was expecting. In the description it says learning video. And that the format is dvd. I put it in the dvd player and it started playing music! My son needs to WATCH and learn the ABC's and 123's not learn songs. It was not what was in the description. I don't recommend it if you are wanting an actual video. But if you are wanting music then you would probably like it.,1249516800,,482,4.138297872340425
