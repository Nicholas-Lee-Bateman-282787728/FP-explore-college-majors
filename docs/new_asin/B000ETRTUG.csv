8114180,4,B000ETRTUG,"This dvd is amazing! From start to finish, it's a fully comprehensive tool for learning how to build your own computer. I'm a graphic designer/aspiring documentarian and I need a real powerhouse to push the kind of graphics software that I use on a regular basis. Since those kinds of computers are usually custom built, it's really hard to find someone who will work on them (and know what they're doing) and I've always wanted to be able to do my own maintenance. This dvd is my new Computer Science degree.",1203292800,5,509,4.604395604395604
