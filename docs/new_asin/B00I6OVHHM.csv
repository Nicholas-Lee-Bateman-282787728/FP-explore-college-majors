6252904,3,B00I6OVHHM,"This is a great movie, don't get me wrong. Worth owning. But don't bother buying the Blu-ray version of it. Watched this on our Xbox One, which is a Blu-ray player, and we also watched the regular version on it.  No difference. My techie son says that unless the movie is filmed with a high def camera, you won't see a difference. The regular version was 1/3 the price of the Blu-ray version, so save your money, and get the regular version.",1402444800,5,441,4.378048780487805
6252905,5,B00I6OVHHM,"I watched this movie twice. Once in regular mode and then with audio commentary on. The great part is how they all had something to say unlike some other audio commentaries and you could tell they really were into making the best movie they could on barely nothing. The music is just outstanding and I especially appreciate it when the actors actually play their instruments. I was so inspired by the soundtrack that I ordered the original soundtracks and original cast recording CDs the next day. You will not be disappointed
with this purchase. It gives me the same feeling when I watch The Commitments. (and where is THAT on Blu-ray?)",1401494400,6,637,4.747747747747748
6252906,5,B00I6OVHHM,"I came across this movie on TV at 1 in the morning. It had a quirky start, so I stayed up to watch the whole thing. As soon as it was over, I got online to buy a copy.

Once is a sweet story about music, friendship, and supporting each other in our dreams. It's heart warming but not saccharine. People have real world challenges and things don't turn out like a Disney plot, but there are successes and joys. It feels like a true story.",1400371200,6,437,4.0813953488372094
6252907,5,B00I6OVHHM,excellent movie and even better sound track.  one of the better romance movies out there.  i highly recommend this film!,1400025600,,120,4.95
6252908,4,B00I6OVHHM,"I watched this film on a recommendation from a friend.. it did not have obvious immediate appeal, and as I started watching it, it was clearly made on a budget, in a city I was unfamiliar with and with characters I was unsure about.  This is no amateur movie though, and all of those concerns were blown out of the water as the movie progressed - the core desires and concerns of these people were universal, the city had both its own character and yet played an `everywhere', a recognisable inner city anyone could relate to.  The songs were engaging because they were heartfelt, and always in the context of the movie.  In short, it was heartwarming, thought provoking, surprising and lyrical.
The two characters at the core of the story find a bond in their music - they share a piece of their soul through the music, and their time together helps each of them find their next step in life.  And that is really about it, story-wise.  The style has the hand held reality of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Before-Sunrise/dp/B001NA6096/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Before Sunrise</a>, with a similar sense of apparent freewheeling improvisation - but like the songs, this is carefully crafted, and does not cheat on your growing care for the characters by having an unreal Hollywood style ending.  To say hand held and `reality imbued' might make you concerned it is lacking ambition - far from it.  The director has some real bravura moments, albeit low key ones, such as the hand held camera tracking a walk back from the shop listening to a song, oblivious to the world around her, or the final shot in the window.
Labelled a musical, I watched this as a drama about two people and their interactions, which just happens to have a lot of songs in it.  Don't be put off by the musical label.  Basically, it manages the trick of being both charming and grounded.  If you like movies without any flash and bang, a movie about characters and how they relate rather than the plot they drive, then try Once.  It's a movie you'll want to see twice.",1395705600,14,2086,4.847887323943662
6252909,5,B00I6OVHHM,"There may be spoilers.

This was my favorite film from 2007. It has been available on Blu ray for some time now.  I believe I acquired my copy from a Canadian seller.  It plays fine in my Blu ray player.  It is a European product that I will discuss later in the review.  The American release will come in April, 2014.

While ""Once"" is not a traditional musical, about 60% of the film is made up of music. What makes this movie so special is the way the music is developed. The Guy and the Girl (that's how the characters are identified) meet in Dublin, Ireland. The Guy is a native and the Girl is from the Czech Republic. They are both struggling musicians and begin a friendship that produces some of the best original music from a movie in years (won an Oscar for best song).

Naturally they are attracted to each other but both carry relationship baggage of the recent past. Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova are rookie actors in the lead roles but are real musicians that became real lovers off-screen and eventually toured together as ""The Swell Season.""  The Guy and the Girl are obviously meant for each other yet remain committed to others so their relationship doesn't go much beyond great friendship. But the final scene of the Girl looking forlornly out her window lets you know she may have just lost more than a musical partner.

When I first saw this film, I was mesmerized by the development of the music. It was so real it felt almost like a documentary. Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova are perfect in their roles and show a different side of acting. Both are terrific musicians and the music is some of the best I've heard in a film. The songs are poignant and just gorgeous. Three great scenes to watch for: 1. When the Guy and the Girl finish the standout ""Falling Slowly"" that the Guy had begun to write. This is done in a music store. 2. When the Girl, listening on headphones, sings the words she had written to the Guy's song while walking home from the store where she had purchased batteries for the CD player. Done in one take! 3. When the Girl struggles through a very sad song she had written and finally breaks down before she can finish. Just great direction and great emotion from the actors. There are many other great scenes in this simple but effective and heartbreakingly beautiful story completed on a miniscule budget.

I had purchased this upgrade to a DVD I owned based on an improved video quality as well as an uncompressed audio track. The Blu ray video is excellent and is definitely better than the original DVD track. The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0. There are 2 additional commentary channels both in DTS-HD MA 2.0 (see below). While I admit I was disappointed that I didn't get a 5.1 option, I have to assume the filmmakers wanted it this way. The lossless sound is clear and strong, but is not the surround generally expected. I suspect the idea was to keep the sound in its basic format as it was made at the time.  The uncompressed audio and improved (1080p resolution, 1.78:1 aspect ratio) video are reason enough to upgrade. Extras include audio commentary by writer/director John Carney and actor/musicians Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova, musical commentary by the same people, 2 featurettes called ""Making a Modern Day Musical"" and ""More Guy, More Girl.""  There is also an English SDH option.",1393459200,23,3355,4.591973244147157
