8325971,5,B000ZFE5FQ,Rosalind Moss is a great teacher.  I remembered watching some of the shows and was very impressed - enough to want to have the program.,1488326400,,135,4.4
8325972,5,B000ZFE5FQ,"I had seen this series during a study at church several years ago and absolutely loved it.  I loved that Rosalind, formerly Jewish, could inform us on Jewish traditions at the time which led to far better understanding of the Gospel for me.  It's been several years, the memory isn't what it used to be so I wanted to watch it again.",1440288000,,333,4.354838709677419
8325973,5,B000ZFE5FQ,"Until this is available again at this site, try the EWTN Religious Catalogue. And you can download the audio mp3's or listen online for free at the EWTN audio library. Sister Moss is, indeed, a marvelous teacher and she is absolutely in love with the Lord and with our beautiful Catholic Church. I listened to her tapes (along with Scott Hahn's) when I was looking into the Church several years ago.

You can also find her at the Catholic Answers site and on the Catholic Answers Live radio show. Enjoy, and may God richly bless you on your own journey.",1230940800,3,553,4.53
8325974,5,B000ZFE5FQ,"Ms Moss is a great study leader.  She makes the program very enjoyable for people of all faiths.  She is an expert and a sweetheart.  I would give this to anyone, religious or not.  It is a great tool for having one's own study sessions.  The companion study guide written by her is also great and can be used with the program.  She is my favorite teacher!",1197590400,7,356,4.2388059701492535
