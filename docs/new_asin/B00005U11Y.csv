1662721,5,B00005U11Y,Incubus is one of america's best groups ever formed!  I will go out on the limb and say that!  All of their videos rule.  Especially since they made their own music videos at first!  This Video RULES,1016841600,,199,4.297297297297297
1662722,5,B00005U11Y,"Hello there everyone. :)  I won't mince words here, this is a truly amazing band. This DVD is like a portrait of what they do as a band as well as some really cool videos and live performances.  The extras are something else; they have even included a slot machine in one of the menus--which is a cool touch.  These guys are REAL and aren't products of corporate greed.  What you see and hear in this DVD is Incubus and not a record labels ideal.  Truly a great DVD and I hope they come out with another one soon.....:)  That's my two cents.  Have a good one y'all. :)",1015718400,,568,4.155963302752293
1662723,5,B00005U11Y,"I love this dvd so much...they have basically packed everything into this one dvd.  you see every single video basically they have ever made, you see them acoustic, you get a bevy of live performances, and also a peek at the making of ""Drive"" and ""Stellar""  So if you are an incu-fan, believe me when i say this is mantastic.",1015027200,,325,4.4
1662724,5,B00005U11Y,"There is only one thing i can say about the DVD, and if you are a hardcore incubus fan you know what i'm talking about when i say that the DVD is ""Mantastic""",1012867200,,157,3.787878787878788
1662725,5,B00005U11Y,When I first bought this I thought it was no gonna be that great because it said it only had 4 live concert songs. No. It has a whole concert plus the 4 from another concert. Also there is a small acoustic concert to. This Dvd is Fantabulous. Check it out!,1010793600,2,256,4.03921568627451
1662726,5,B00005U11Y,"This DVD totally gives you a look into the personal side of the band members, as well as giving you all of the goodies that you want, such as the music videos for ""Stellar,"" ""Pardon Me,"" and ""Drive.""  You also get the music videos for ""Summer Romance,"" and ""Miss You,"" and after watching them you know why you never saw them on MTV or anywhere else for that matter; however it's a bittersweet addition to the DVD.  Along with all of the live performances you get brief home video footage as well.  It's also really fun to watch the creative juices flow in the behind the scenes look for the videos of ""Drive"" and ""Stellar.""  This is definately a best buy for an Incubus fan, and a maybe for someone that enjoys this type of music.  You can watch the DVD over and over again just for the videos and the live performances, not to mention all the other stuff that is hanging around in the menus.",1010448000,3,892,4.317365269461078
1662727,5,B00005U11Y,"Incubus has come a long way and proved that they are real people.  The DVD has home video footage that is a little nerve racking when it's out of focus or pointed at the floor.  But hey, so was Blair Witch and it was a hit.  The footage is an insight into their lives.  They did it themselves more as a memory for then and not as the start of a motion picture.  They're great musicians, artists, writers, and all around great people.  I'm a huge fan and would recommend this to anyone who wants to see a real band, their accomplishments and silly days.  The boys are downright silly dorks but that's what makes them so great.  Their music and videos are a piece of their lives that leave us true fans yearning for more.  Another note, if you know anything about the band members you know that DJ Kilmore wasn't always in the band and there are videos on this DVD with the other DJ, Alex...  If you need a taste of them first, see a live show because the DVD can't compare to the magic they have.",1009411200,2,995,4.189473684210526
1662728,5,B00005U11Y,"Buy this DVD. Enough said.  It is worth any amount of money, for the buyer will truly see what makes a great band; one that isn't pre-packaged by the corporate world.  This DVD harnesses Incubus' true originality to the fullest and also shows why they are one of the best live bands to come on the scene ever.  Although watching the DVD cannot totally make someone comprehend the power and spiritual awesomeness of their live show, it will give the viewer an excellent idea of what and how music should sound like.  Not to mention the countless ""Extra Love"" packed into this amazing DVD.  Definant recommendation to any fan of music, true music.",1008892800,13,645,4.672566371681416
1662729,5,B00005U11Y,"This DVD is wonderful. The acoustic tracks alone are worth the price - with the 2 concert performances, the videos, and the wonderful clips and ""behind the scenes"" stuff just icing on the cake. Yes, Virginia - Incubus IS better than s-x !",1008374400,,238,4.558139534883721
1662730,4,B00005U11Y,"wether you've been a fan from the fungus amongus days, science days, or make yourself, this dvd is for you.  it contains live perfomances of all the best songs from science and make yourself.  it also has all there music videos, including videos which i believe have never been on mtv, a certian shade of green, and take me to your leader, but yea it has there big mtv hit videos too.  its got lots of great stuff though, a must buy for any incubus fan, and its pretty affordable too.",1008201600,,484,4.2967032967032965
1662731,5,B00005U11Y,"This DVD is of Incubus on the Sno Core tour with System Of A Down (Serj makes an apperance in one song), Mr. Bungle, and others. This is what to watch if you want to see what Incubus can do in concert. The thing that makes me like them so much is the way they mix things up. They're not afraid to do an extended version of a song, or change up the lyrics somewhat. Another reason this is such a good DVD is because of the little scenes in between a few songs. It really shows you that Incubus really do love what they do, and have a good time doing it. I really like how they mixed show clips too, it's interesting to see how they can change from show to show. Also, their song choices couldn't have been better. They play all of my favorite songs from S.C.I.E.N.C.E. and Make Yourself. They also play them perfectly, Brandon shows that he doesn't need vocal help like some lead singers do nowadays. Mike gets to show how good he is at playing guitar on here too, he really is amazing. The band as a whole prove that they are one of the better bands to see live. The sound quality by the way is really good, especially if you have surround sound.

Just a few of the best songs are Favorite Things, Pardon Me, The Warmth, and Redefine. Like I said though, every song is great, there is no song on here I would change. I reccommend this DVD to any Incubus fan in search of a good DVD of them. The extras alone are worth the price though (there is a TON), so pick it up for a great performance from a spectacular band.",1100995200,6,1515,4.118243243243243
1662732,5,B00005U11Y,"i bought this origionally for the music videos, i had never seen the stellar video.but i got this home, stuck it in the dvd player and was happily engrossed in viewing pleasure for 2 hours. the acoustic shows are great. the live concerts great, everythings great.i know that people are complaining about the music in the menue creens and the fact that you have to keep clicking for the different shows and features but i really don't care, i love it, i think its better than ""the morning view sessions"" as there are more special features on here than that disc, plus there was more work put into this one, don't get me wrong i love them both but this is better.

if you like incubus then get this, even if you dont, get it, you will not be disappointed!",1098748800,,753,4.378571428571429
1662733,4,B00005U11Y,"This DVD was a really good buy, even if you are just somewhat into Incubus, but if you are a big fan, it's a must have. The home videos and tour of the tour bus and all the music videos and concert footage was great, with great sound quality. Also, there is a really funny Take Me To Your Leader music video. It's a really cool DVD. The only thing i didn't like, was the ""Massive Song Archive"" the background music was kind of annoying, and you cant just sit and watch through the whole thing, you have to click on different things. But good buy anyways. INCUBUS ROX!",1096588800,,567,4.2110091743119265
1662734,4,B00005U11Y,"First of all this is a good DVD though there are some downsides to it.  For instance as someone else mention you have to click a lot of things individually so it gets obnoxious.  For instnace if you go into the index (which plays this god-awful noise over and over and over and over (you get the idea)) and click on the acoustic tracks, some of them will play just that song, some will play all the acoustic tracks-it's just really crazy.  To keep this short and sweet I will say this:  If you like Incubus then get the DVD, but if your looking for something that can go on in the background without you having to keep clicking stuff well then maybe this one isn't for you (but buy it anyway!)",1073952000,2,693,4.2272727272727275
1662735,5,B00005U11Y,"Everone else already said this is the ""best dvd EVER"" so there is no point repeating that... I will simply add to it my favorite qualities...  The absolute best thing is the live acoustic performace they did in Cali.... they redid A Certian Shade of Green to sound totally chill... the singing notes are even completely different.  When you enter the vegas option each time you click on it it shows something different (one of those things you just have to own it to understand).  It has all their already made videos on there which is great since I liked them w/o ever seeing a video until this dvd.  Take me to your leader is a funny video.  It's just plain cool... even if you don't like Incubus music (how could you not), just get the dvd for good laughs.  Only drawback.. it doesn't play everything straight through, sometimes you have to click on each individual thing.",1073347200,,875,4.54140127388535
1662736,5,B00005U11Y,"I bought When incubus Attacks Vol. 2 for my Birthday as well as Morning View Sessions and they were definately the best things i have bought for ages!! I love how in this DVD you can see them performing they're music as well as seeing them behind all the glamour and acting themselves! it's got fantastic song clips on there like Pardon Me (best song ever =D) as well as other songs from Make Yourelf, SCIENCE and Fungus Amongus.
I reccomend for all you Inucbus fans out there to go and buy this DVD, you won't regret it!!

1662737,5,B00005U11Y,"This DVD is great, not only does it include tons of Music Videos, including three diferent versions of Pardon Me and 2 of A certain shade of green, BUT It also includes an entire concert. I would recomen this video to all Incubus fans, this DVD is way before Incubus changed into the radiofreindly band it became on Morning View.
You can also see 4 great unplugged songs whch are just awesome. Nothing more to say really, it is just simply great.
- This DVD is a must-",1057363200,,468,4.329545454545454
1662738,5,B00005U11Y,"There are really too many adjectives to express Incubus' work, especially on this DVD. While some people would brand their style of music as ""weird,"" I simply state them as one of the most original and talented bands out. Their live concert in Chicago had me feeling like I was actually at the concert, but I was more impressed with their Unplugged sessions. They did a great job doing acoustic versions of hard songs 'The Warmth' and 'Certain Shade of Green', which I really thought was impossible to do.
Everyone is used to seeing lead singer Brandon Boyd go 'nuts' in his performances...but it is no secret that he has an amazing voice. I advise Incubus fans to buy this DVD (as well as the Morning View Sessions...but that's another review), and to you non-Incubus fans out there--start listening to their music.",1046044800,4,816,4.753521126760563
1662739,5,B00005U11Y,"the 421 option on the extra love section is a meditation session with brandon.  in order to view this, you gotta select 421, then, using the directional arrows on the dvd remote, press the right one 4 times, the bottom one twice and the left one once, and voila  there you go lol
p.s. this dvd kicks .......if you don't have it, buy it!",1045008000,2,336,4.234375
1662740,5,B00005U11Y,"This dvd is really sweet, with all the videos and live performances... the morning view sessions dvd is really cool too, but it doesnt have as much footage, this dvd is really good and i recommend it. (what is the 421 code thing anyway?)",1043539200,,237,4.409090909090909
1662741,5,B00005U11Y,"after a babysitting job that got me 80 bucks i decided- ""what better way to spend [money] ... on incubus dvds and a phantom planet cd?""- this was back in March- and i LOVE this dvd- its so awesome- the features on it are so great and the concert footage is awesome- ive watched it so many times and it always gives me something to do- so scrap up some hard earned or begged money and BUY THIS DVD",1040601600,,396,4.025316455696203
1662742,5,B00005U11Y,"Id definitively give this DVD 10 stars if i could. Heck, id give it 100 stars if i could!!! THeres never been anything as cool as this DVD, which turns out to be an awesome snapshot of the best band ever. The whole 2.5 hours of running time includes every video (not incluiding, of course, those belonging to the Morning View album, since the album has been made after the DVD, and also two previously unreleased videos: I Miss You and Summer Romance (the anti-gravity love song). It also has two really cool live performances and an acoustic/live show. Also, behind the scenes footage of the Drive and Stellar videos is featured, and a discography section... (and lets see if you crack the entrance to the secret 421 link!) Whatever, it just doesnt get any better than this. If you like this band, if ABSOLUTELY sure you'll love this DVD.",1039737600,,839,4.6

1662744,5,B00005U11Y,"This DVD is worth paying double.  Its amazing.  Perfect.  These five men are the most wonderful and creative men you will ever see or hear.  All throughout this DVD, the smile never left my face.  The pure joy of just watching it is extrodinary.  I loved every second of it.  I have been to some Incubus concerts and they were phenomenal. So if you can't make it to one of their live shows, this is definately the next best thing.
If you like Incubus as much as I do, you will die when you watch this.  Buy it.  Watch it.  Love it.",1027814400,3,531,4.117647058823529
1662745,5,B00005U11Y,"the title speaks for itself-this DVD is worth the money! It says on the back that the running time is 2.5 hours, but there's a lot more than that on the DVD. It has songs live in Chicago, acoustic song versions, backstage stuff, 7 music videos, making-of stuff, and on and on and on. buy this- you're not just going to need 2.5 hours to finish the DVD.",1025654400,,352,4.1911764705882355
1662746,5,B00005U11Y,"On the main menu, highlight ""Gigante Especiale"" and press right. It will highlight a picture of Chuck and it will say ""Let Chuck Choose"". This easter egg just randomizes clips from the DVD and chooses one at random. The next on is in the bonus features menu. There will be a long list of options in the special features menu. Scroll to the very bottom past the last choice. It will highlight a hidden ""421"". While the 421 is highlighted, press right 4 times, down 2 times, and left once. It will take you to a 10 min feature of Brandon Boyd meditating while trippy things go on in the background.
to access the story boards for the most recent vids like pardon me, stellar and drive. all you have to do is to go to the videos selection screen and chose one of the videos and when it starts press the subtitle button and it will bring up the basic art work story board for that vid",1024444800,22,880,4.244047619047619
1662747,5,B00005U11Y,"I have owned this DVD for probably two months now and have watched it over 100 times. It gets better and better everytime you watch it. It's a must get, even if your not a big Incubus fan. It shows how the band plays together so well and really makes you look at them in a different light.",1023667200,,289,4.0
1662748,5,B00005U11Y,"This is a great DVD.  If you have a choice of DVD/VHS get the DVD it contains about.. an hour more of footage I think, plus you gotta just have it for the great menus and things like that.  The greatest part of this dvd is the extras.  The main thing is basically a bunch of songs played live with some small interviews and clips in between.  In the extras there is more live footage, small funny clips, a tour of the tourbus with Jose (this is really funny), the 7 music videos they've had so far, a few other small things, and the coolest thing is the Akoostic Kali, which is 4 songs played acoustically (Clean, A Certain Shade of Green, The Warmth, and Summer Romance.) They are all great, the only thing that I don't like about it is that they didn't include any more acoustic things from that session because they actually played like 15 songs.  Oh well, thats what the Morning View Sessions is for, but check out this DVD you'll love it.",1023235200,,943,4.305084745762712
1662749,5,B00005U11Y,"This DVD is a must have for any Incubus fan!  It includes a good chunck of their songs prior to the Morning View albums, some with several versions.  The acoustic versions alone make this DVD worth the money!",1022630400,,208,4.447368421052632
1662750,4,B00005U11Y,This DVD has great vintage footage of the band and a ton of songs. This isn't really a Live DVD but chunks of live performances from different locations with some nice behind the scenes stuff. Worthy of your money.,1020643200,,214,4.512820512820513

7953947,5,B00005U11Y,"If you love this era of Incubus, this is the DVD for you! The acoustic set towards the end of the video was the absolute high-point in this outstanding production. The full on live performance in Chicago was just Incubus, the crowd and the pure energy you would expect the shows of this era to have. I wanted to also note that the picture and sound quality of this DVD are ina word BRILLIANT! I will always keep this DVD on hand when I want to ENJOY INCUBUS!",1361577600,,458,4.215909090909091
