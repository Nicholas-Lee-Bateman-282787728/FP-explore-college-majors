4398406,3,B004KV9312,I was excited at first thinking that this was a good buy until I saw it brand new at Walmart for the same price :,1317600000,,113,3.56
4398407,5,B004KV9312,"My son and I love these movies! The first one was ok, we love the 2nd and 3rd ones the best. I like the actors that did the second one better than the ones in the first. Selena Gomez did such a better job than Madonna. And the father in the second one is so much better than the guy in the first one.",1315353600,,300,3.703125
4398408,1,B004KV9312,"I love the original movie, but #2 is one of the worst sequels ever and #3 is the strangest.

1) Only some of the original voices. Maltazard is the worst, but there are quite a few.
2) Worst evil villain monologue ever. He goes on and on and on and... You get the point. Not only is his voice different, it's really annoying. Going from David Bowie to Lou Reed... Need I say more
3) Plot fail! #2 has the worst plot ever. Like it's villain monologue/monotone, it never goes anywhere.

Between Selenia's lack of dialog and screen time in #2, voice changes for both movies, and horrible plots about the only saving grace is, and I can't believe I am saying this, Snoop Dog. He almost makes it deserve a second star.",1315180800,,712,4.345864661654136
4398409,3,B004KV9312,"Ok, I really enjoyed the first movie. The second movie is ok, a bit long and drawn out. My children thought it was great, so that is all that matters.

However, there were a couple inappropriate moments in the second movie(such as the joke about the always pregnant sister).
The end credits of children singing every word of Lady Gaga's 'Poker Face' was going to far. I like the song, but really why on earth did they have it in a kids movie...and sung by small children??

Also, what the heck happened to the princess? She turned from independent and strong to damsel in distress!

We are about to watch the 3rd movie now. Like I said, these are cute movies... but there are some things that are not for small kids that I wanted to let others know about.",1313539200,5,755,4.378571428571429
4398410,4,B004KV9312,"Good movies, but not as good as the first,as far as the story.  Excellent animation and live action combo.",1312070400,,106,4.578947368421052
4398411,4,B004KV9312,"This double-feature continues the story of the original very well.  The spunk of the Princess is missing from the second movie, but then she is a prisoner of Maltazar.  But have no fear, it returns in full in the third movie. -- All the characters are there and share great adventures to the completion of the story.",1311638400,4,316,4.526315789473684
4398412,5,B004KV9312,My daughter loved the Arthur first so I bought her 2 & 3. She really liked them although she liked the first one better. Overall these are great movies for the price.,1311465600,7,166,4.21875
4398413,2,B004KV9312,"The first movie is really cute, the animation is still amazes me. BUF is anti- Disney and Pixar with it's incredible details and textures. Arthur 2&3 are created with the same software, but both movies lacked the charm of the first. If a movie is successful, it's best not to ruin it with lame sequils.",1309046400,,302,4.509090909090909
4398414,5,B004KV9312,"I had purchased the first one by mistake.  But after viewing it for about 50 times, I knew I would enjoy part 2 and 3 of Arthur",1307577600,,127,3.7037037037037037
4398415,4,B004KV9312,"I just saw these available today on amazon on demand (Roku).  We really enjoyed the first one, but I was a bit apprehenvise since these were direct-to-video releases.  However, the cast and the production (effects) quality were very good.  Some of the voice cast changed, but Freddie Highmore and Mia Farrow are back as the main Human characters.  Actually, we saw part 2, and rented it on demand and watched it before we realized there was a third part!  Luckily Part 3 was also available so we watched it right after Part 2.  So if you liked the first one, I recommmed these.",1302393600,17,577,4.553398058252427

However we were not able to watch this as it has been zone coded for Canada and America only.
The seller did not mention this in the ad, thereforth wasting everyones time!
Amazon is now going to refund me but had i known it was zone coded they would have to as I wouldn't have bought it.
Really angry at the laziness of this seller, list it in your ad that it has a zone code in it!

4398530,4,B004KV9312,"Two disks: ""Arthur and the Revenge of Maltazard""; Arthur 3: The War of the Two Worlds
Comparing this two part fantasy movie with a comparable story, ""The Secret World of Arrietty"", from the famous Studio Ghibli (and I am a Miyazaki fan), is like comparing the visuals in ""Rango"" to a '70s comic book. The French studios of BUF and EuropaCorp have surpassed the Japanese and maybe all but one or two of the American studios in producing detailed, lifelike animation that treats each character and even non-essential elements with individualization. They have not fallen into the economical rut of using the same, nonmoving, 2D background over and over again that is usually found in more cheaply produced animations.

Great crossover voices such as Snoop Dogg, Fergie, Will. I. Am, Selena; intelligent dialogue (with touches of humor and wit) and fantasy storytelling. Great CGI, sets, modeling, bluescreen and motion control.  Special shout out to Luc Besson for his range of creativity, commitment to quality and courage to pursue such diverse filmed storytelling.

Reduced by one star because I thought the second disk lost some creative juices toward the end and just dragged on.",1339977600,,1182,5.1139896373057

They are not quite as good as #1, and the voiceovers are not from the same well-known actors; but my daughter still loves them.  The movies are short and my daughter will sit and watch both of them in a row.  The movies are a cool mix of real and animated scenery and characters.  Cute and entertaining fantasy story for preschoolers.",1326931200,,503,4.308510638297872

The movies are mostly, maybe 3/4, animation, not something I normally select, but since I have Freddie Highmore's August Rush and Spiderwick and Two Brothers, I decided to give it a shot. It is a good story line, cute, a family movie for all ages.",1325894400,,416,4.085365853658536
