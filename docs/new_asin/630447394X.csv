7871984,5,630447394X,"I have seen many films and documentaries about the Australian Aborigine, I think highly of our people in this country, if you are interested, this is one of the great films to introduce you to them, or just have as a study guide, it is inspiring, and gives you a powerful glimpse of their true greatness,
through simplicity, they overcome their environment, and lived a balanced life with their lore and spirituality, they looked after Mother Earth, as true Guardians.
Loved it can not say enough, you will love it too.",1335657600,,519,4.714285714285714
7871985,5,630447394X,"As Christophus Colombus once said:
  ""Life has more imagination then you could dream of in your entire life.""
  True if you are not fully living the dream of life itself.  For australia's aborigines, they beleived of themselves as being life itself, creating it, shaping it throughout their entire life.
  This astonishing film is half documentary half story telling.  the documentary part of it, extremely well documented, follows the rhythms and story line of the actual presentation of the aborigine's mythological ""Dreamtime"".  Three facets of this films are weaved in a sublime way: the screenplay, the music and the storyline are one.  Now, that I know about the aborigines, I can't help myself from wanting to be truly human again!  They are cheer inspiration and hope.  Would you dare to dream???  I DO!",1082073600,3,811,5.053030303030303
7871986,4,630447394X,"This documentary is a glimpse into the lifestyle of Australian aborignes that is fading from existence. It ties the remaining population of a small tribe with the land, showing ritual and some ceremony used to keep the balance in life. I found it interesting to hear the aboriginal names of the animals who shared their environment, as well as learning about how each animal came into it's current form. The scenery is beautiful, as are the people and their disappearing artwork.",1051747200,5,479,4.925925925925926
