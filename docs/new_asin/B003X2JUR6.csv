""Most historians are agreed that if a count were taken of the twelve greatest men who ever lived in any country in any age, Aadi Sankaracharya would undoubtedly be one of them. I would call him the Universal Man. He deserves to be called the Universal Man in more senses than one. First of all, his accomplishments were of the highest order in a number of fields of mental and spiritual activity, each one of which would have been enough to make him immortal. He was a poet of the first order and also a philosopher par excellence. He was a savant and a saint of the highest spiritual development. He was a mystic and a religious reformer. Aadi, Sankaracharya was a Karma Yogi, Bhakti Yogi and Jnana Yogi, and he was right in the forefront in each category.""

""Aadi Sankaracharya was universal in his outlook. His message was meant not for Hindus alone, not for Indians alone, but for all mankind. Surely, Swami Vivekananda and Sri Aurobindo must have been thinking of him when both of them said that the destiny of India is to be the spiritual leader and moral teacher of the world.""

Discovering his birth place is greatest tribute to the Great Philosopher.. This documentary is a right away of letting know people what great philosophers are meant for..",1284768000,5,1297,4.655021834061135

Thanks to the Sringeri Mutt for this wonderful piece of work.",1281225600,4,244,4.674418604651163
