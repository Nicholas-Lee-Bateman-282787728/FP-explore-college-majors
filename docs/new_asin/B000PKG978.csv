8192254,1,B000PKG978,"This Sybel character is crazy. You never start off a Yoga routine with severely spread apart hips...that is for the end before Savasana (corpse pose) when your hips are already warmed up. She starts with a forward-bend butterfly (never) and I was shocked to see her do reverse plank, a back bend, and THE PLOW all within the first few minutes! She's not even giving anytime to hold the poses which is the real point of yoga.  This video is extremely dangerous and I had to turn it off within 10 minutes because I was in shock.  Her verbal instructions are terrible as well!

If this woman does have a REAL Yoga Teaching Certificate (doubtful), the program she got it from should be shut down.

And shameful for the ""baseball players"" to be used as a shoddy endorsement at the beginning. These guys don't know what a good yoga instructor and healthy yoga routine is from a hole in the ground. This routine would hurt these guys and in no way be a benefit to them.

This crazy woman would have never made it to a Yoga Instruction video if it were not for her background scenery. The producers of this should be ashamed!",1359244800,2,1117,4.455882352941177
8192255,5,B000PKG978,"This DVD has been a blessing to me and everyone that I have recommended it too. Sybel's faster pace yet soothing voice and instruction is just what I needed. She has the athlete in mind that will gain balance, flexibility and concentration that they don't get from their major sport. In a short period of time you go threw a amazing amount of poses without feeling rushed or bored. In working with cyclist's and triathlete's Sybel's yoga has been the only addition to there training that I have recommended that they stick to. The resulting improvement in performance and injury recovery can be attributed to Sybel's DVD.",1305158400,,621,4.813084112149533

This is set in someone's poolside with beautiful waves crashing on the beach backyard & people walk by. Sybel's teaches via voice over with twinkling wind chimes & the waves as the only ""music"". Sybel's voice is calm/almost monotone. She only gives the English names of poses, but only tells you some of the names sometimes. Poses are only held for 3-4 breaths which felt like as soon as you got in & right spot, you have to go out immediately. The production value is decent/good, mostly one camera angle & occasionally zooms in & you can hear the sounds clearly.

Relaxation - 4 min:
Lay down for her voice over guiding you to relaxation.

Though she gives cues, I would never suggest this for anyone who doesn't know basic yoga poses. I was very disappointed in her poses, they were not aligned as well as a yogi instructor should be.
You can see a quick video testimonial & intro of this workout & pictures of her ability to do the poses on her site: sybelsyoga com",1197072000,5,1880,4.943037974683544
