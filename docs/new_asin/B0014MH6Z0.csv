8291389,2,B0014MH6Z0,"This started out very promising with a scene where a husband's lover visits the married couple's home and announces her position with frightening authority--on Christmas day, no less. After that it just rolls along with violins, heavy sighs and a plot that takes too long to unfold. The couple move to a small town to try and start over. The wife is too broken to go along and begins an affair with a local womanizer. It's all about sex and forgetting what happened, but there's not enough substance to get the viewer caught up in the emotional goings on. Everything is predictable and thinly plotted. Kim Yun-jin (from Lost) gives a decent performance but the direction of the film is very weak.",1277078400,,696,4.713114754098361
