8602610,5,B00E8OUMK2,"This set (season one) is a very hard to come by set. This series of painting /teaching videos are a priceless value. Bob is just so enjoyable to watch and listen to. His voice is so soothing. There simply is not an easier way to learn how to oil paint. I remember watching these as a child while growing up. And now my daughter is becoming a professional painter due to these videos, I mean she really is!! God bless you Bob, rest in peace, you are a legend never to be forgotton!",1428278400,,480,4.172043010752688
