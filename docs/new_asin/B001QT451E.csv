8336205,5,B001QT451E,"THE HALAS & BATCHELOR SHORT FILM COLLECTION [1948  2015] [Blu-ray] [UK Release] 18 of the Best Animated Shorts from the Ground-Breaking studio behind Animal Farm!

Affectionately referred to as the British Disney, Halas & Batchelor's highly influential and internationally acclaimed body of work encompassed children's series, public education films, adverts and more. This collection of short films will both remind and reinforce how stunningly innovative, whimsically humorous and subversively entertaining their four-decade body of work actually was.

From an uncannily prophetic, Oscar nominated satire on technological overkill and automated gridlock Automania 2000 to the adventures of a paper cut-out dog and his friends Snip and Snap, the films present wide-ranging content in a gloriously inventive fashion. Drawn from an archive that includes numerous international award winners, these animated gems have been newly transferred in High Definition from the original film elements; all showcase the beguiling humour, questing yet playful spirituality and sheer technical brilliance that characterised the studio's output, serving as both an introduction to and celebration of a unique body of work that is ripe for re-evaluation.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Welcome to the Halas & Batchelor Collection the archive of what was for over 50 years, the largest and most influential animation studio in Western Europe. From small beginnings in 1940, they made over 2000 films and earned an international reputation for fine animation extending the medium to explain complex ideas with clarity and humour.

Halas & Batchelor Cartoon Films occupies a unique place in British cinema. The studio was formed in 1940 and produced films for the next fifty years. It was the country's largest and most influential producer of animated films from the early forties until the mid-seventies. Throughout its history, it always strove to pioneer new styles and techniques from paper cut-out figures to computer animation.

The studio was also renowned for discovering and nurturing new talent; indeed, a list of the artists who started their careers at Halas & Batchelor reads like a Whos Who of British and European animation. Although Animal Farm remains the most famous of Halas & Batchelor's films, they produced over two thousand others, from entertainment films to documentaries, and TV series to experimental art and animation films.

By 1950 the studio had made over 100 films, two of which were features. Their unique ability to produce longer works, for an adult audience, created not only new genre of animation, but gave them the necessary experience for making Animal Farm, their best-known work. Adapted from George Orwell's classic book, Animal Farm was released in 1954, and won critical acclaim worldwide.

From that time Halas & Batchelor grew into one of the largest animation studios in Europe, producing all sorts of animated films, from commercials and television series, to art movies and experimental films. Over the years that John and Joy collaborated, Joy wrote literally hundreds of scripts, and was the driving force behind most of the work. Her feature film, Ruddigore which made in 1964, was the first animated operetta, perfectly capturing the tongue in cheek quality of its creators, Gilbert and Sullivan.

After the death of Joy Batchelor in 1991, John Halas continued to produce films until his death in 1995. His last ever production was a projected series of 12 films about the European Union of which one stands out Know Your Europeans UK 1995 which was made by Bob Godfrey. In recent years the works of Halas and Batchelor have been somewhat forgotten, however this Blu-ray release is a testament to what is undeniable brilliant talent.

To celebrate the 75th anniversary of Halas & Batchelor, Network and the BFI [British Film Institute] National Archive where the Halas & Batchelor Collection is held and takes us back to where it all started for the inspirational animation duo. In the spring of 1940 the Hungarian John Halas and the Watford-born Joy Batchelor did two key things, they married, and they founded their own animation studio. For the next 40-odd years this partnership, which mixed the best of Johns European ambition, vision and determination with Joys innate design sense, storytelling skills and understanding of the British mind-set and revolutionised Britains moribund and overlooked cartoon industry. It is impossible to tell the story of British animation without Halas & Batchelor, and it is now impossible to tell the story of Halas & Batchelor without this Blu-ray release, especially with this remastering of their animation films, I am now going to list the release of some John and Joys brilliant animation films on this Blu-ray disc which some of the best of the companys short films is another must-have, plus also listed below is the equally awesome Blu-ray Extras. So here are the contents of this brilliant Blu-ray disc for your enjoyment and the main Titles are as follows:

The Magic Canvas: A Study in Movement, Form and Colour [1948] [1080p] [1.33:1] [10:04] Here is something different and exciting from any other ordinary cartoon film and is entitled The Magic Canvas. It is a ballet, in which the dancers symbolise two aspect of man. One part of him soars up bravely like a bird and brings riches and joy to the earth; the other stays imprisoned and wants to be set free. So relax and let your eyes and ears enjoy it. The animation film was made by Halas & Batchelor in 1948; and it is a very unusually personal and experimental piece dating from a period when much of the studio's output was propaganda. Peter Foldes, whose later credits include Hunger and A Short Vision, contributed to its designs. Beautiful study in animation giving a lovely play of movement, colour, and music, merging form and idea in a painter's fantasy and here is something new and exciting, so relax and let your eyes and ears enjoy it. As a brilliant bonus, at the start of this animation film, you get the original black-and-white 1948 British Board of Films Censors U Certificate.

Flying Free: Video Concerto No. 2 [1980] [1080p] [1.33:1] [8:08] In 1980 John Halas asked Phil Wells to update the soundtrack of The Magic Canvas with what was at the time a cutting-edge electronic composition, but which by now has its own nostalgic feel.

The ship sinks and the figurehead is saved by a beautiful mermaid who falls in love with him. Her love is not returned because despite his dashing looks he has the wooden heart of a saint. This Halas & Batchelor film is a mixture of 3D stop-motion animation with a technique of shooting through coloured filters devised by Alan Crick.

The History of the Cinema [1957] [1080p] [1.33:1] [7:48] This animated history of the silver screen lends itself naturally to satire. In just 7:48 minutes it covers a 100 years of screen history in a hilarious blend of fact and fiction, in an award-winning piece which uses traditional animation cells to expose the foibles of the film industry. The film attracted considerable attention when it was first released and was chosen for the Royal Command Film Performance. Narrated by Maurice Denham.

Automania 2000 [1963] [1080p] [1.33:1] [9:24] A satiric tour de force on technological overkill. This prophetic and humorous film concerns the state of the world at the millennium. Uncannily accurate in its prediction, the film shows the results of technology gone mad. In the race to produce bigger and better cars we see how humanity adapts to life in a grid-locked world. One of the studios finest films, Automania 2000 was a prize winner all round the world, including a Hollywood OSCAR nomination and a British Academy Award.

DoDo  The Kid from Outer Space: The Kidnapped Kid [1964] [1080p] [1.33:1] [5:50] ""He's the science-fiction pixie from a strange atomic race.

Tales From Hoffnung: The Symphony Orchestra [1964] [1080p] [1.33:1] [7:34] Based on the drawings of Gerard Hoffnung, artist, comic and raconteur. The film follows the performance of an over enthusiastic conductor who brings the house down  literally!

Flow Diagram: An Introduction To Problem Analysis and Programming [1966] [1080p] [1.33:1] [3:03] This is a humorous introduction to problem solving and analysis, in which bathing the dog becomes a fun way to explain elementary mathematics to children. This is typical of the Halas & Batchelor approach to making a difficult subject accessible.

The Butterfly Ball and the Grasshoppers Feast [1974] [1080p] [1.33:1] [3:45] Directed by Lee Mishkin in 1974. The Butterfly Ball and the Grasshoppers Feast is a Halas & Batchelor film based on the 1973 picture book by Alan Aldridge and William Plomer; Harold Whitaker and future Willo the Wisp creator Nick Spargo also worked on the film. It was picked as the best short of 1974 by the British Federation of Film Societies. This is a sumptuous and elegant animation in the classic style celebrating the Beatles era and the psychedelia phenonium. Unlikely partners of insects, frogs and small animals have a woodland ball against a backdrop of Alan Aldridges richly graphic illustrations and featuring Roger Glovers song Love is All. This is a brilliant animation film that will delight both young and old, which is an all-time favourite of mine, ever since I saw it in the cinema in 1974.

Autobahn [1979] [1080p] [1.33:1] [12:08] Autobahn, is just over 12 minute animated film and produced by Roger Mainwood, was commissioned by Kraftwerk's record label in 1979 and especially to be released on one of the first films produced specifically for a LaserDisc. A visual interpretation of Kraftwerks music Autobahn. A fast paced experimental film which proved to be a ground breaking combination of electronic and manual animation. It has now become an icon of late seventies design and music.

Dilemma [1981] [1080p] [1.33:1] [11:26] This is one of the first computer-animated films to tell a story. Where mankind has a choice, to use technology for good or ill. In a series of graphic images Dilemma shows the rise and fall of civilisations through the ages. Will we use our inventive abilities to benefit our world or will our scientific advances lead to its ultimate destruction?

Blu-ray Video Quality  The Halas & Batchelor Short Film Collection is brought to you with a brilliant 1080p encoded image, with of course a 1.33:1 aspect ratio. The restoration of the all animation films for this transfer is also impressive. The picture is great; carefully preserved to recreate the image without damaging the original look and feel. The colours aren't oversaturated, and it doesn't look too digital. But sometimes the short animation films sometimes do not look as sharp or clean, but it probably looks almost exactly like it did during its original run in the cinema, still it get a 5 star rating from me for a great effort of the tem at Network.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The sound is presented in 2.0 LPCM Stereo Audio, which is very clean, but doesn't really impress. Still, this is a great preservation of all the contents, and you have to allow for the age of some of the Halas & Batchelor animation and of course where network can get hold of the original material. But overall it is a great effort on Network and their team in finally seeing some of the best animation Halas & Batchelor produced, but I hope they release Volume 2, as there is still a wealth of animation cartoons in the Halas & Batchelor vaults.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: The Cultured Ape: 1980 Colourised Version [1080p] [1.33:1] [7:19] This is a colourised version of the 1960 animation cartoon, made for its 1980 re-release as part of the Tele-Tale Cartoon series.

Special Feature: Clapper Board: The Halas & Batchelor Story [1980] [1080p] [1.33:1] Clapper Board was a weekly TV show produced by Granada Television and headed by Chris Kelley. In 1980 Clapper Board devoted three special shows to the Halas & Batchelor studio, to mark their 40 years in the animation business. We are also told that Halas & Batchelors satirical cartoon The History of the Cinema irritated the film industry to such an extent that the then head, wanted to ban the showing of the film. So here are the following three special features:

Clapper Board Part 1 [1980] [480i] [1.33:1] [26:38] Included in this Granada TV Special, we have Chris Kelly, who is the presenter of this TV show, who we first see interviewing Roger Manvell [Professor of Boston University] in the studio. We also get to see Chris Kelly interviewing John Halas in his camera workshop in the Covent Garden Headquarters. We also get animation clips from the likes of the Walt Disney cartoon Three Little Pigs [1933]. But most of all we also get to view some rare clips from the Halas & Batchelor catalogue animations, which include Animal Farm [1954]; Wonder of Wool [1960]; Filling The Gap [1941]; Dustbin Parade [1941]; Handling Ships [1944] and Train Trouble [1940].

Clapper Board Part 2 [1980] [480i] [1.33:1] [40:28] In this second helping of Clapper Board from the Granada TV Special on Halas & Batchelor, we find Chris Kelly again back in the Covent Garden Headquarters of Halas & Batchelor, interviewing John Halas, who talks about his work in producing well over 2,000 animation cartoon films. We also get to see behind-the-scenes of the artists working on the actual pencil drawings, which eventually are used to transfer of to cells for the actual animation. But once again we get more rare clips from the Halas & Batchelor catalogue animation films, and the ones shown this time are Hamilton The Musical Elephant [1961]; Your Very Good Health [1946]; Magic Canvas [1948]; John Gilpin [Artist Ronald Searle] [1951]; The owl and the Pussycat [1952]; The Figurehead [1953] and finally Animal Farm [1954] which we get to see quite a few clips.

Clapper Board Part 3 [1980] [480i] [1.33:1] [26:34] He we get to view the final Granada TV Special on Halas & Batchelor. Once again we find Chris Kelly in the Covent Garden Headquarters interviewing John Halas again and talking this time about his work from the 1950s and onwards and also talks about all the awards he has collected over the years, and how much work goes into producing the animated films, but especially informs us how very expensive they were to make, even in those days and also the amount of people he employed to work on the animation films. But once again we get to view more rare clips, including the Award Winning animation film Power To Fly [1953]; plus other clips that include The World of Little Ig [1957]; The History of Cinema [1956]; Atomania 2000 [1963]; Children and cars [1971] and Autobahn [1979]. Chris Kelly also asks about his venture into a 100 minute sci-fi animation film, where half the work was to be in London and the other half in Hollywood, but whether it happened or what happened to the project, we never get to find out, as there is no information from Granada TV at the end of this final TV Special.

Special Feature: An Animated Utopia: The Life and Achievement of John Halas 1912  1995 [2012] [480i/1080p] [4:3/16:9] [67:09] This special documentary is brought to us by the Animation Academy of Loughborough University, and it was presented as part of a posthumous Lifetime Achievement Award at The Bradford Animation festival in 2012. It is also is broken up into different categories like Halas in Hungary; Halas and The Visual Imagination; Halas and Technology; Halas and Politics and Halas and Communication. The essay in question is entitled An Animated Utopia, is about the unsung animation visionary, John Halas, and is written and directed by Paul Wells, gives an in depth look at the character of John Halas as a humanitarian and it also explores John Halas look on life and explores his desire to save the world using animation. We are informed that Animal Farm was covertly funded by the CIA as part of its strategy during the cold war. For John Halas it was a labour of love enabling him to make a serious feature using animal characters. A politically charged film addressing everything from animal rights to conflicting ideologies. Another type of H&B production was demonstrated with an amusing clip from the Tales from Hoffnung short film Birds, Bees and Storks with Peter Sellers, as the voice of an old duffer explaining the facts of life. Anyway this is the story of John Halas and what brilliant work he achieved in his lifetime. We also get lots more rare clips from the Halas & Batchelor Catalogue of animation films. But we also get contributions from the likes of Clare Kitson; Vivien Halas; Brian Borthwick; Tee Bousustow; Paul Goodman; Stan Hayward; Borden Mace; Mette Peters; Martin Pickles; Graham Ralph; Jez Stewart and Harold Whitaker.

Special Feature: John Halas Remembered: An Animator Ahead Of His Time 1912  1995 [2015] [480i/1080p] [4:3/16:9] [12:04] At just over 12  minutes, this documentary is about John Halas, one of the most important figures in post-War British Animation, whose centenary was on 16th April, 2012. John Halas was originally from Budapest and his painting studies along with his first animated steps (firstly influenced by Bauhaus leading light Laszlo Moholy-Nagy) to his London studio creation in the mid-30s. Not easy years for a Jewish to travel Europe at that time, but John Halas moved wherever necessary to continue his animation career path, so once he got to know and employ his beloved Joy Batchelor for his Music Man film, a fifty-year partnership began. He is the one behind Britains first full length Animated Animal Farm feature based on George Orwells novel, one of the first to experiment with 3D stereoscopic animation, with computer animation, to found and chair the International Animated Film Association in the 1960s and a big contributor to the British animation as a whole. His birth centenary was celebrated, so John and Joys daughter Vivien film was commissioned and got to produce the 12 minute documentary film about her dad John Halas, and with a rare and unique opportunity to learn some basics of the British animation history. Vivian Halas runs the Halas & Batchelor archive collection. Narrated by Zoe Wanamaker.

Special Feature: Ode to Joy: A Life in Animation 1914  1991 [2014] [1080p] [4:3] [3:52] Here is aAnother of these documentaries is Ode to Joy. Joy Batchelor was the other half of the Halas & Batchelor animation team. The commentary tells us that in spite being one of animations most important figures, today she is one of its unsung heroines. Examples of Joy Batchelors work show she was a brilliant graphic artist, not only as an animator but also as an illustrator for newspapers and magazines when animation work was scarce. We are told that her illustrations set the house style for the studio. Her role was to translate a clients brief into an engaging story, in order to persuade, sell or entertain. She also excelled in managing the work of others with the unfortunate result that she is uncredited on many of the later shorts. However, on Animal Farm Joy is credited with script writing, direction, production and design. Narrated by Zoe Wanamaker.

Special Feature: Image Gallery [2015] [1080p] [4:3] [3:36] Here you get to view all of the artists sketches, that went towards the making of the brilliant Halas & Batchelor award winning animation films, plus also behind-the-scenes photograph images, and what you get to view is the following images: The Magic Canvas; The Owl and the Pussycat; The Figurehead; The History of the Cinema; Foo Foo; HaBa Tales; Snip and Snap; Hamilton The Elephant; Automania 2000; DoDo  The Kid From Outer Space; Tales from Hoffnung; Birds, Bees and Storks; Flow Diagram; The Question; Children and Cars; The Butterfly Ball; Aurobahn and Dilemma.

Finally, and that is just disc one, let us hope more will follow. One of the real gifts of this collection is the context that comes along with it through a series of special feature documentaries made at different times. The three-part Clapper Board profile from the 1980s benefits mostly from the direct interviews with John and Joy. John Halass unique approach of the English language and is a perfect accompaniment to the substance of his interviews. Two documentaries about John Halas were made to celebrate the centenary of his birth in 2012, which offer more analysis of his contribution to animation with the benefit of historical perspective. 2014 marked the centenary of Joy Batchelor, and the short profile of this much overlooked figure in the partnership is also a valuable bonus feature. So all in all this is a totally brilliant Blu-ray Collection and has gone pride of place in my Blu-ray Collection, because Britain gained so much from the Halas & Batchelor team and this Blu-ray shows their talent in the best possible way and again I hope in time with the success of this first Blu-ray Release from Network, and hopefully they will be adventurous and release a Volume 2, as again as mentioned earlier, there is still a wealth of brilliant Halas & Batchelor animation films to be plundered from their vaults and lets hope some good news will be forthcoming in the very near future. Highly Recommended!
