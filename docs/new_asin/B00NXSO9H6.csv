Originally I had the Italian Panorama channels with cable but it got too expensive, but I was addicted to this show. It was exciting, romantic, and thrilling all wrapped into one show. To top THAT, it showed some beautiful landscapes and architecture. Can't wait to get Stagione 02 on sale!!!!",1486598400,,378,4.8307692307692305
