3903762,3,B002C4N66M,"I bought this film as part of a double feature with a terrible movie called Gone With The West.  I was surprised at how good this one was.  It is about a self centered jerk, played by Sam Elliot, and an incredibly gullible and stupid woman, played by Vera Miles.  Vera is married to the obnoxious sheriff who is holding Sam in jail for murder.  Sam plays on Vera's gullibility to let him out of jail, thanks to the fact that the sheriff just smacked Vera in the face and made her mad.

Vera follows Sam out of town, only to learn that he is a total jerk.  The movie takes a really strong turn at the end, with a great climactic scene.  Check it out.",1151712000,18,649,4.103174603174603
3903763,2,B002C4N66M,"This undistinguished oater is made much worse by technical problems.  It isn't a bad little western, and the two lead roles are played competently by Vera Miles, whose most famous role was Laurie Jorgensen in ""The Searchers,"" and Sam Elliott, who was born to make westerns.  It had a good plot and some beautiful desert locations.

Unfortunately, the film was not well shot.  None--and I mean not one--of the interior scenes is adequately lighted; you can barely make out dark shadows moving around against a black background.  The scenes in the Cactus Jail, which are key and set up the movie, might as well be taking place in a cave without even a candle for light.  Then there's the DVD which is full-frame and was mastered from an extremely distressed print of the film.  The DVD is blurry and shows every scratch, spot, and speck of dirt that 33 years of obscurity could inflict on the print.  Too bad.  Miles and Elliott deserved better.  Frankly, because of the technical issues, the film is probably not worth wasting 90 minutes on.",1120003200,31,1040,4.727777777777778

3903804,5,B002C4N66M,"The title, ""Molly and Lawless John,"" reveals the plot of this underrated 1972 Western: A doomed-to-be-hanged Outlaw (Sam Elliott) escapes jail, taking the love-starved wife of the sheriff with him. Their misadventures ensue. John Anderson plays the sheriff.

While this is a low-budget Western, the filmmakers take advantage of their resources to produce a low-key adult Western that touches greatness. Despite the limited funds, the movie effectively supplies many of the typical Western staples, like a bank robbery, a jailbreak, posse chases, a sojourn through the desert, a watering hole, a Native American attack-and-capture sequence and magnificent New Mexican locations. Take, for instance, the Indian segment: Only a handful of Natives appear in the cast, but the filmmakers give the illusion of an entire tribe.

Yet it's the story itself where this Western shines. Despite the generally slow-moving drama, the movie maintains your attention with great performances and interesting psychological subtexts. Vera Miles is outstanding in the titular role as the gentle, humble, modest, compassionate and daring Molly. The ages of the cast members match the details of the story pretty well: Vera, as the childless wife, was 42 during filming while Sam Elliott was 27; and the stunning Cynthia Myers was only 21 in her brief and final role (remember her from the notorious ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls"" from 1970?). Myers was easily one of the most beautiful women to walk the earth at the time.

By the way, if you're thinking about viewing ""Molly and Lawless John"" expecting the typical amiable Sam Eliott Westerner, look elsewhere. Again, the title of the film tells all.

The film runs 98 minutes.

GRADE: A-

PS: People complain about the DVD because it's full-screen and the picture quality supposedly isn't up to snuff but, despite the full-screen presentation, I thought it looked fine for such an obscure Western; and I didn't have a problem making out what was going on in the dark jail, pueblo or cave. The filmmakers were shooting for realistic lighting and they did a fine job.",1418083200,2,2098,5.155882352941177

I would have gotten more entertainment out of throwing the money in the street and watching people scramble for it.

Sam Elliott is one of my favorite actors, but this doesn't represent him properly.

I would return it, however the shipping would be more than the DVD is worth.",1300406400,2,473,4.541176470588235
3903822,5,B002C4N66M,"Sam Elliott must've been in his mid 20's when he made this film. As a result he's got plenty of hair but zero mustache!!! It's no big deal really, but the cover might be a bit misleading. Without his mustache I thought he looked more like Tom Cruise than Sam Elliott. Maybe it's because he was so young.

Either way this movie is really good. Someone should remake it though. Time has not been kind to it and the picture and sound are not the best. Still, if you're a fan of Elliott and his Westerns this should definitely be in your collection. By reading the synopsis I believed this flick to be more on the romantic side. Quite the contrary. It can be really dark at times and the ending is really worth the wait.
