3068162,5,B0011UKORM,"Just thought I'd add my voice to those wanting to see this excellent series released on DVD. Today's television just doesn't cut it for we baby boomers. My shelves are stacked with shows from the 50s and 60s - Perry Mason, The Saint, The Baron, Gideon's Way etc. We are, after all, the generation with those few spare dollars to spend on frivolities.

3068164,5,B0011UKORM,"Like all the reviewers and fans before me, I too long for Warner Brothers to release this wonderfully entertaining series SOON.  This program bridged the 50's and early 60's with its fashion (remember the ""pencil ties"", fitted suits, zippered jackets with collars upturned, high heels, tight skirts with cashmere sweaters, highly polished shoes?) the dialogue (""cool baby"", ""I'm hip"", ""wow man!"", ""gone, really gone!"") Classic cars (mostly convertibles) that went careening down the Sunset Strip towards parts unknown or just pulling into the many Drive-in joints for the carhop service where your server was a cute Blond on rollerskates? How about an attractive cast of sexy, suave and savvy Private Eyes (Efrem Zimbalist as Stuart, Roger Smith as Jeff, and of course, the reigning teen hearthrob Edd Byrnes as Kookie, cast as the the valet with style and dialogue all his own?) Add an occasional murder, embezzlement, art theft, a damsel in distress (always a knockout with untold riches), a humorous racetrack bookie as a casual informant and Man Friday, a French receptionist with the looks of a Movie Magazine covergirl (who flirts with the boys only to recieve polite rainchecks!!!!!!) and you have the perfect Friday night fare!  Rarely has a TV program had such a profound impact on today's crime shows, for without 77 Sunset Strip we'd be stuck with Dragnet 2013........given the mores and happenings back then, this program provided wholesome, exciting ENTERTAINMENT that did not cause nightmares....the whole family could watch and not have to ponder the psychological implications so prominent in today's crime shows!  No slashers, child abductions, strip club shootings, just pure entertainment and a few laughs to boot!  Warner Brothers Television dominated the TV with great westerns, detective programs during this era; even the theme song was catchy and clever (remember the ""snap-snap"" sound at the end of each verse?  It was billard balls striking one another!)  Cool man,cool!",1361318400,20,1996,5.300632911392405

I'd love to see if the series is really as cool and I remember it.  I always liked the race-track tout that the detectives used as a snitch and the slightly ditzy secretary (secretaries?)that Kookie (Ed Burns)flirted with all the time.

One other thing the studio's need to remember......the generation that initially viewed the series are getting older and passing from the scene. That is where the purchasing power is. The longer they wait the fewer the die hard fans there are. Get smart Studio's. And they wonder why countries like China bootleg them.

I think many of the other present day shows are completely worthless, and I agree with what has been said about this product previously, why hasn't it been put onto dvd? If they aren't sure it will be a popular idea, then they can at least start with season 1, but I'm sure that wouldn't even be a problem.

There may be places out there that have some, but I couldn't tell you where",1334880000,3,693,4.564516129032258
3068179,5,B0011UKORM,"Warner Bros. was on a roll in the late 50's, early 60's when it began producing its private eye TV shows. Of Hawaiian Eye, Surfside 6 and Bourbon Street Beat, the granddaddy of all of them was 77 Sunset Strip. Stu Bailey & Jeff Spenser were almost too cool for words when surrounded by their sidekicks, babes and requisite bad guys. Put Stu or Jeff in a Thunderbird convertible, add in a blonde and a crook and the ""caper"" mystery magic began to bubble.

There was (and is) no such address as 77 Sunset Strip. The opening credits of the boys driving away from the office actually occured at 8523 Sunset Blvd., which is now the site of the Actors Studio. Dean Martin's Lodge (the hip hangout next door) actually survived until 1983 until, sadly, it was torn down and made into an office building. The parking lot drive thu that was studiously serviced by car valet Edd ""Kookie"" Burns still remains as a vague physical reference of the time and place.  Only a small plaque in the sidewalk at that locale commemorates the TV series.

When I began buying up available VHS' of the series (as Warner Bros. still obnoxiously has not released this in DVD format) and watched the shows produced from 1958 until 1962, I realized my original enthrallment had waned somewhat as most the plots and sets were more than mildly cheesy. It was a rare day that the film crew ever left the boundaries of the Warner lot to create a realistic environment that remotely bespoke of Los Angeles in that era. On those rare occasions, I would freeze frame the tape to read the name off a store or office building in order to Google its continued exisitence. Almost none remain. Sunset Strip has changed entirely in 60 years.

But I must say, all in all, there remains that kidlike fascination with that era of boozy, smoke-filled bars, martinis and blondes that were always part of Stu and Jeff's world. The series almost jumped the shark when Richard Long (from Bourbon Street Beat) was brought on board as the 3rd partner of the team. Although slick and suave, he seemed to lack the Bailey and Spenser mettle. The producers must have felt it, too, for he was gone after one season and replaced by Edd Burns -- who had mysteriously graduated from car valet to full-fledged detective after a contract dispute with the studio.

Season 5 heralded the final disintegration of the series when Roger Smith left due to illness (later recouperating enough to marry Ann Margret), and Jack Webb took over the production reins. It ceased to be 77 Sunset Strip as we knew it and more of an international detective drama. Only Efrem Zimblist, Jr. remained in the cast. When that season was over, so was the series.

If you are a Baby Boomer over 50, I urge you to find good reproductions of the show (and believe me, they're hard to find) just to relieve the era. Mix yourself a martini, light up a Camel and lean back and enjoy Hollywood detective TV from the 50's and 60's. It's gone for good now.",1328832000,8,2961,4.556390977443609

It illustrates its era, not just the suave men and sexy women but the fashions, cars, nightclubs, attitudes promoted as part of the post-war ""good life."" It was a keystone in creating my image of what men and women should be and how they should act -- not all for the good,  since it was highly glamorized and unrealistic -- but fascinating to look back on. It's an extended look at the ""Mad Men"" era, when a cigarette and a drink were part of the American image, and the country was on top of the world, for better or worse. I'd love to see full seasons of this series.",1313884800,2,621,4.254237288135593

3068189,5,B0011UKORM,"When I first read about the creation of The Warner Archive Collection back in March of 2009, I read that Warner was going to use their new mod service to highlight and release both vintage movies AND tv shows that may not sell well in wide release but were still being heavily requested by devoted fans. Well, so far I've seen both the best (and worst) of their old movies from the 30's, 40's and 50's released, and most recently they've stepped up emptying the vaults of their 60's and early 70's movies, but...where in the world are the tv shows?!!! Yes, I've noticed the 2nd season of Cheyenne as well as the upcoming release of The F.B.I.-but where are the shows multitudes of fans have really been begging for the last few years? I'm talking Maverick-I'm talking 77 Sunset Strip and yes, I'm also talking 77's companion shows Hawaiian Eye and/or Surfside 6!!! If the intelligent people (And I use that term loosely) in Warner's sales and marketing department are so deftly afraid the shows won't sell, then instead of letting them languish and corrode in their vaults, why don't they just lease the rights (at least temporarily) to Shout Factory or Image Entertainment, 2 companies who have done fantastic jobs with vintage shows like That Girl, the original Bill Cosby Show, Thriller, The Dick Van Dyke Show and the Twilight Zone. Heck, even the smaller companies like VCI or the companies that have been releasing Banacek and Mcmillan and Wife would do justice to these classic western and crime thrillers. I swear, many of the mod vintage films Warner has been releasing, particularly over the last 6 or 7 months, neither me nor many of my friends who are also old movie and tv fanatics, have never even heard of them! It's high time Warner started expanding their horizons and their dvd library and started giving fans what they really want-in other words, it's time they stopped scrapping the bottom of their (truly) obscure movie barrels and lets start seeing some great CLASSIC TELEVISION, preferably this century-Please!!!!!!",1306972800,12,2038,4.842406876790831

I caught up with this show a year or so ago when one of our local tv channels started playing it and I thought it just sparkled with wit, fine writing and good stories.  Not to mention delightful performances by all the cast.

Yes, the folks in their 50s and 60s would most certainly like to see it again - but so would us younger squirts who can recognize quality when we see it.  This show is miles ahead of the rubbish being produced today and I for one would be delighted to see a proper dvd release.  And since several of the show's stars are still thankfully with us they could be interviewed for a dvd set.

I encourage Warner Brothers, which has announced a feature remake of 77 SUNSET STRIP(God help us), to spend their money better by striking new 35mm prints of the show and using them for dvd masters.

A little ""by-the-way"" fact... the ""77 Sunset Strip"" building was real.  Of course, that wasn't the actual address on Sunset but the building was there complete with the awning over the sidewalk.  It didn't have the ""77"" on it, but the rest was accurate.  I say, ""was"" because it's been many, many years since I've been back that way and I don't know if it's still there.

The good ones stood out. As kids we would discuss in depth the next day the programme we saw the night before. 77 SUNSET STRIP was one of the good ones along with Burkes Law. A general point, why are we subjected to paltry offerings in the form of best of Season  dvds in colour. I want to see the early episodes in black and white, as I remember and loved them. When some series eventually went to colour this was usually after the series had run for a few years, consequently the ideas/scripts were no longer fresh and were well past their best. So give us complete seasons from day one even if they were in black and white. What executive makes these decisions, are they actually from our era, because they certainly don't appreciate the nostalgia and high regard these series were held in not only now but when they were first shown. Do they not read comments from potential customers. we are also fed up of series being released and then the seasons split up into volume 1 and 2. We all know this is a rip off so most of us will not buy them when presented like this. The execs then wonder why they don't get bought. Get it together and provide the customer with what they want and value for money. When will one of the best detective series, 77 Sunset Strip be released.

Classic cars (mostly convertibles) that went careening down the Sunset Strip towards parts unknown or just pulling into the many Drive-in joints for the carhop service where your server was a cute Blond on rollerskates? How about an attractive cast of sexy, suave and savvy Private Eyes (Efrem Zimbalist as Stuart, Roger Smith as Jeff, and of course, the reigning teen hearthrob Edd Byrnes as Kookie, cast as the the valet with style and dialogue all his own?) Add an occasional murder, embezzlement, art theft, a damsel in distress (always a knockout with untold riches), a humorous racetrack bookie as a casual informant and Man Friday, a French receptionist with the looks of a Movie Magazine covergirl (who flirts with the boys only to recieve polite rainchecks!!!!!!) and you have the perfect Friday night fare!  Rarely has a TV program had such a profound impact on today's crime shows, for without 77 Sunset Strip we'd be stuck with Dragnet 2013........given the mores and happenings back then, this program provided wholesome, exciting ENTERTAINMENT that did not cause nightmares....the whole family could watch and not have to ponder the psychological implications so prominent in today's crime shows!  No slashers, child abductions, strip club shootings, just pure entertainment and a few laughs to boot!  Warner Brothers Television dominated the TV with great westerns, detective programs during this era; even the theme song was catchy and clever (remember the ""snap-snap"" sound at the end of each verse?

3302676,5,B0011UKORM,"Warner Bros. was on a roll in the late 50's, early 60's when it began producing its private eye TV shows. Of Hawaiian Eye, Surfside 6 and Bourbon Street Beat, the granddaddy of all of them was 77 Sunset Strip. Stu Bailey & Jeff Spenser were almost too cool for words when surrounded by their sidekicks, babes and requisite bad guys. Put Stu or Jeff in a Thunderbird convertible, add in a blonde and a crook and the ""caper"" mystery magic began to bubble.

There was (and is) no such address as 77 Sunset Strip. The opening credits of the boys driving away from the office actually occured at 8523 Sunset Blvd., which is now the site of the Actors Studio. Dean Martin's Lodge (the hip hangout next door) actually survived until 1983 until, sadly, it was torn down and made into an office building. The parking lot drive thu that was studiously serviced by car valet Edd ""Kookie"" Burns still remains as a vague physical reference of the time and place.  Only a small plaque in the sidewalk at that locale commemorates the TV series.

When I began buying up available VHS' of the series (as Warner Bros. still obnoxiously has not released this in DVD format) and watched the shows produced from 1958 until 1962, I realized my original enthrallment had waned somewhat as most the plots and sets were more than mildly cheesy. It was a rare day that the film crew ever left the boundaries of the Warner lot to create a realistic environment that remotely bespoke of Los Angeles in that era. On those rare occasions, I would freeze frame the tape to read the name off a store or office building in order to Google its continued exisitence. Almost none remain. Sunset Strip has changed entirely in 60 years.

But I must say, all in all, there remains that kidlike fascination with that era of boozy, smoke-filled bars, martinis and blondes that were always part of Stu and Jeff's world. The series almost jumped the shark when Richard Long (from Bourbon Street Beat) was brought on board as the 3rd partner of the team. Although slick and suave, he seemed to lack the Bailey and Spenser mettle. The producers must have felt it, too, for he was gone after one season and replaced by Edd Burns -- who had mysteriously graduated from car valet to full-fledged detective after a contract dispute with the studio.

Season 5 heralded the final disintegration of the series when Roger Smith left due to illness (later recouperating enough to marry Ann Margret), and Jack Webb took over the production reins. It ceased to be 77 Sunset Strip as we knew it and more of an international detective drama. Only Efrem Zimblist, Jr. remained in the cast. When that season was over, so was the series.

If you are a Baby Boomer over 50, I urge you to find good reproductions of the show (and believe me, they're hard to find) just to relieve the era. Mix yourself a martini, light up a Camel and lean back and enjoy Hollywood detective TV from the 50's and 60's. It's gone for good now.",1328832000,8,2961,4.556390977443609

3302686,5,B0011UKORM,"When I first read about the creation of The Warner Archive Collection back in March of 2009, I read that Warner was going to use their new mod service to highlight and release both vintage movies AND tv shows that may not sell well in wide release but were still being heavily requested by devoted fans. Well, so far I've seen both the best (and worst) of their old movies from the 30's, 40's and 50's released, and most recently they've stepped up emptying the vaults of their 60's and early 70's movies, but...where in the world are the tv shows?!!! Yes, I've noticed the 2nd season of Cheyenne as well as the upcoming release of The F.B.I.-but where are the shows multitudes of fans have really been begging for the last few years? I'm talking Maverick-I'm talking 77 Sunset Strip and yes, I'm also talking 77's companion shows Hawaiian Eye and/or Surfside 6!!! If the intelligent people (And I use that term loosely) in Warner's sales and marketing department are so deftly afraid the shows won't sell, then instead of letting them languish and corrode in their vaults, why don't they just lease the rights (at least temporarily) to Shout Factory or Image Entertainment, 2 companies who have done fantastic jobs with vintage shows like That Girl, the original Bill Cosby Show, Thriller, The Dick Van Dyke Show and the Twilight Zone. Heck, even the smaller companies like VCI or the companies that have been releasing Banacek and Mcmillan and Wife would do justice to these classic western and crime thrillers. I swear, many of the mod vintage films Warner has been releasing, particularly over the last 6 or 7 months, neither me nor many of my friends who are also old movie and tv fanatics, have never even heard of them!

And since several of the show's stars are still thankfully with us they could be interviewed for a dvd set.

When I was in high school, I always took time out from my homework to watch it.  That show was an absolute must.  I might miss other shows, but not 77 Sunset Strip... never!
A little ""by-the-way"" fact... the ""77 Sunset Strip"" building was real.  Of course, that wasn't the actual address on Sunset but the building was there complete with the awning over the sidewalk.  It didn't have the ""77"" on it, but the rest was accurate.  I say, ""was"" because it's been many, many years since I've been back that way and I don't know if it's still there.
It was a wonderful series, and, for me, a ""must have"".

The good ones stood out. As kids we would discuss in depth the next day the programme we saw the night before. 77 SUNSET STRIP was one of the good ones along with Burkes Law. A general point, why are we subjected to paltry offerings in the form of best of Season  dvds in colour. I want to see the early episodes in black and white, as I remember and loved them. When some series eventually went to colour this was usually after the series had run for a few years, consequently the ideas/scripts were no longer fresh and were well past their best. So give us complete seasons from day one even if they were in black and white. What executive makes these decisions, are they actually from our era, because they certainly don't appreciate the nostalgia and high regard these series were held in not only now but when they were first shown. Do they not read comments from potential customers. we are also fed up of series being released and then the seasons split up into volume 1 and 2. We all know this is a rip off so most of us will not buy them when presented like this. The execs then wonder why they don't get bought. Get it together and provide the customer with what they want and value for money. When will one of the best detective series, 77 Sunset Strip be released. Certain series were hugely popular at the time and for good reason, stop releasing rubbish and give the customer what we want.",1269129600,6,1576,4.3938356164383565

*******

This is a show that I remembered enjoying as a kid, yet it was so long ago I couldn't remember the episodes or exactly why I liked it.

Then a few years ago American Life TV ran it for a while, and my wife and I viewed it religiously during the time it aired.

We enjoyed it every bit as much, actually more, than most current TV shows. The stories were crisp and made sense. The characters were personable, and the acting quite competent.

Effrim Zimbalist Jr. and Roger Smith star as the operators of a private detective agency at the address noted, in Los Angeles. Although the two actors had frequent interaction on the show, for the most part each episode involved only one or the other of them as the star for that week's show. This series introduced Ed ""Kookie"" Burns, who became a heartthrob for young girls (and women) all around the USA.

I like Roger Smith in the show so much that I began to wish he had not retired his own acting career to act as agent for his wife, Ann Margret. I'd have liked to see him in more after this series ended.

If you start watching 77 Sunset Strip, watch for the episode written and directed by Roger Smith that has no dialog for the entire hour. So often he is 'about' to finally speak, keeping you on the edge of your chair with anticipation, then something happens that distracts him.

You could fit at least 35 hour long episodes on just 2 blue ray discs instead of 6-7 dvds. I doubt the original film negatives still exist. Probably only tape masters. So they would be using blue ray discs for their capacity only. Most people  have a blue ray player. I doubt there are many with only a dvd player.

I recall everyone in my classes at school looked forward to this program because it was so damned cool. Forget Efren Zimbalist, Jr., on the FBI series, he was absolutely the epitome of cool on this program. He played Private Investigator Stu Baily, a believable World War II veteran that earned his living as the best P.I. on the West Coast. Together with his partner, Jeff Spencer (Roger Smith) who later married Ann-Margaret, formed the Bailey and Spencer Private Investigation agency. Then there was young Kooky, who parked cars at Dinos next door, and with his late '50s hip talk, and charm, wowed the chicks while he dreamed of one day becoming a private eye himself (which he eventually did on the show). Each week the program featured really great plots, guest stars, and tons of action. I think Bailey and Spencer killed more bad guys than the L.A. Police ever did! Nevertheless, the entertainment value was extremely high. Before the Baby Boomer audience dies off, Warner Brothers needs to get to work and release this wonderful program on DVD.
