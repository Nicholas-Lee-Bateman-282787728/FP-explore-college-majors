8307474,1,B001GZ6PUC,Who cares what politicians and movie actors think of soccer. I was hoping to see more soccer highlights with John Cleese commenting but it was mostly interviews.,1389398400,,161,5.0
8307475,3,B001GZ6PUC,"It's a pleasant DVD, mildly amusing, with some- usually grainy- footage that illustrates points being made. Occasionally the footage is beautifully illustrative of an observation, but not often enough. There is never a 'studied' review of something that's just been used as ""example"" footage, so if you're not already knowledgeable you might well miss what the example was supposed to show you. I 'froze' the playing a few times so's to indicate what the footage was supposed to be demonstrating, for a non-fan who watched it with me. Several things could have used some teaching, however lightly delivered, so the point wouldn't be so murky. Other parts stand all right without elaboration. I enjoyed it well enough but couldn't possibly give 4 stars. It's too lightweight for that- not funny or clever enough, not revealing or educational enough.. The idea of assigning a letter of the alphabet for each football topic to be covered is a good way to make structure. The humor is absolutely not at Python level, and the set-up of Cleese's character being abusive to the other bloke is rather tired out before it starts.",1381795200,,1120,4.962765957446808
8307476,5,B001GZ6PUC,"I will have to ask my friend after his birthday. But I would assume that if John Cleese is in this, it has to be a funny look at what we Americans call soccer.  Anything involving John Cleese has always made me laugh and enjoy the humor, so I'm just hoping it all proves to be a good gift. The service was excellent, it arrived safely and well packaged, and I know it will be a good gift.",1363478400,,388,3.9743589743589745
8307477,4,B001GZ6PUC,"Though it would be very funny, but it was not Monty-ish. Great soccer. I would recommend it. Still love Cleese!",1358035200,,111,4.6
8307478,5,B001GZ6PUC,"Deeply interesting to soccer fans and funny.  Loved the sidekick foil to cleese.  His facial expressions almost outdid Cleese, I thought.",1356220800,,137,5.476190476190476
8307479,5,B001GZ6PUC,"John Cleese and Tom Konkle are two generations of sketch comedians cut from the same cloth.  Cleese is legendary and Konkle is a rising star whose has drawn comparisons to Cleese along the way.  Interestingly Konkle falls comfortably into the Michael Palin mode offering support and comedy to compliment Cleese's style rather than be too similar to it.  The writing on the show is exceptional as are the interviews with a who's who of the football world. (soccer in America)  The A-Z format for the sketches creates a wonderfully, surreal and silly flow and weaves together some very dissimilar and high -minded concepts about the game.  Watch if you love football and watch if you want to see two funny, talented comedians working together with comic ease.",1252108800,18,757,4.929133858267717
