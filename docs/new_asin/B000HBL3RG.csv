8137992,5,B000HBL3RG,"This is a very nice DVD, although I'm interested only in the first part of it, which is the interview with Elijah, Viggo and Peter about the Lord of the Rings. Who wants to see the handsome and special men talking about special things - this is the way. Watching it on DVD is such a different experience from seeing the same piece as an internet download. I wish more interviewes could be bought like this, in a DVD quality. An absolute must for the Lord of the Rings fans!",1193616000,,473,4.266666666666667
