8747598,2,B01AKEGTR8,"The film takes place sometime in the near future. Technology has advanced and so has global warming, so much that it has devastated the city of Vancouver, now walled off into sectors. Aiden Magnusson  (Mark Petey) a contractor cop from sector 2 apprehends a criminal and is now a quiet hero being promoted to sector 1.

Crimes are solved using DNA. They can spray a home and find out who was there from DNA traces. Everyone has their DNA on file since birth. Aiden detects there is something wrong with the system and causes issues.

The film moved slow. Action scenes lacked action. Mark Petey has no stage presence. They needed a real ""hero"" for that role, someone who could really fight.  Eric Petey wrote and directed the film and by casting what I suspect is his brother into the lead, he killed his project.
