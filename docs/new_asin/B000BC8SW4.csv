2412306,3,B000BC8SW4,"5 STARS - are you KIDDING!?!? Once again, like ""Does Humor belong in Music"", this is nothing more than the 20 year old VHS ""dumped"" on DVD. I HATE when they do this - no re-mastering, no 5.1 (only stereo) and only a couple so-called bonuses!! I'm sure Frank wouldn't have put up with this were he still alive. Oh well, at least I don't have to fast-forward to get to my favorite tracks anymore!!

But...I do love it, how can you not since it contains footage of 2 of Frank's best bands in their prime!! Funny though, I have read in several places, including right here on Amazon, that the Zappa family trust had nothing to do with this, and yet, ""Executive produced by Gail Zappa"" is right there in the liner notes!! It also mentions that the entire original concerts will be released ""soon"" but, considering this is now a couple years old, I'm not holding my breath!!

But, think of the possibilities when/if they do!! Imagine, the complete ""A token of his extreme"" TV special AND the Halloween 1981 concerts being available in uninterrupted, complete formats, re-mastered on DVD with 5.1 or 6.1 audio!!

For those who know (or noticed the ""s""), that's right; there were actually TWO separate concerts, with different set lists, played that day in 1981!! A matinee and an evening show. And true fans also know that both are ""out there"", the matinee having been broadcast on Dutch TV and the evening show became the infamous live MTV show.

I have had both shows on separate VHS tapes for years but, from checking the complete set lists (which can be found on the internet and in several Zappa books) neither of my tapes contain either show in its entirety; both have some songs missing!! If the Zappa's REALLY wanted to make the fans ecstatic, they could/will release BOTH Halloween shows, re-mastered, on a single DVD. And the ""A token of his extreme"" TV special on another DVD, ideally as a double disc package with the long-awaited Roxy DVD (what the heck is the hold-up on that one?!?) Knowing Frank, I'm sure the trust owns the rights to do so!!

But, until then, I'll have to be happy with my VHSs and this, sub-par, DVD. I really want to give this 4 stars because of what it is - but compared to the possibilities - it's really only a 3!!

If you are a fan I'm not telling you anything and you probably already have this but....Another perfect case of ""what could have been""!!!",1128556800,,2385,4.534883720930233
2412307,4,B000BC8SW4,"""The Dub Room Special"" is a somewhat interesting, somewhat inconsistent, somewhat annoying, sometimes brilliant film comprised from the 1974 tour, the 1981 tour, some straggler footage from 1982, and some clips from 1968, all spliced together in a documentary(?) film I have never seen on TV, its intended medium, despite some not-so-TV-friendly content.

Of course, the music itself, is always tops in its field, but there are some issues with the editing. Some people complain about several intros missing from the final edit, but I understand this. It is meant to look in on the band while on stage, but why would the solo from ""Montana"" be taken out? Time constraints? Chronology and continuity are obviously not an issue here, as the skit number ""Room Service,"" which is a dialogue based only on inside jokes taken from lyrics from ""Roxy & Elsewhere,"" features an extremely sweat-soaked Napoleon Murphy Brock, and this is only a few minutes into the film, but the next time you see him, he is dry. This sequence is obviously from the later part of the show. No biggie, just a talking point.

One thing, the 1974 line-up of The Mothers apparently gave FZ a far more enjoyable time on stage than the 1981 band. In 1974, he is laughing and cracking jokes from the stage, and generally having fun. Jump to 1981: he is stone-faced throughout, almost like some field marshall, but with a gaudy jumpsuit. Both of the two bands featured play their material wonderfully, the chops of the players is never an issue. He always used the best musicians he could find at any time.

The animated segments are, in my opinion, incredible. Even though Zappa is briefly shown in a clip toying with the animation process, this is the forte of Bruce Bickford. Some people complain about the segments being too long, obstructing one's enjoyment of the band itself, but I just see it as a visual compliment to the music. But, in my humble opinion, the sound effects in the animations could have been erased, or at least, toned down. This DOES interfere with my enjoyment of the music. But watching these segments, I am astonished.

Some of the ""interviews"" are superfluous, specious even, but this is pretty much a film of Frank Zappa having fun in the ""Dub Room."" It is what is said to be. But, I do have to concur with many of this video's critics when it comes to Massimo, the nose-picking journalist. His ""song,"" as it were, is one of Frank's duds. And including it on the Mothers' LP ""Uncle Meat,"" WHY??? And I don't mind peurile humor, but listening to the bridge in ""Montana,"" while seeing him with his finger all the way up in his nose, giving the camera a 'fecal-matter-eating' grin, is simply juvenile. I showed this part to my 6-year old niece, and she just said ""...eww."" Sometimes the humor just falls flat.

But to sum it up, ""The Dub Room Special"" is a patchwork of what Frank Zappa was doing in 1981 and 1982, with some gems from 1974, for good measure.

He was definitely a better musician than he was a film maker.",1213228800,6,3014,4.656015037593985
2412308,5,B000BC8SW4,"OK, this is not your highly polished, heavily cut, fast pace modern day video. It is a compilation of performaces by two of the best Zappa periods. Napoleon Murphy Brock, George Duke, Ruth Underwood, et al, in one band, the other band is the later incarnation with Steve Vai, Chad Wackerman, Ray White and others. The tunes are cut together with additional, low budget (ala FZ) home video style scenes of FZ in the video dub house. IMO, an A+ archive.",1188000000,2,451,4.580246913580247
2412309,5,B000BC8SW4,A lot of Zappa performings. Highly recommended!!,1181606400,,48,6.0
2412310,5,B000BC8SW4,"The contrast between two of the musical periods of FZ's life is excellent.  As with every album he produced, the change from the 70's to the 80's also represented a definite shift in FZ's music.  Also well represented here is the contrast of his musical genius and irreverant humor.

Just as a side note, Ruth Underwood should recieve some sort of award for her work here as the hardest working woman in a Rock Show.",1179705600,,416,4.52
2412311,4,B000BC8SW4,"Before I get started a couple of words to all of the ""real Frank Zappa fans"" out there. This is the same Dub Room Special you had deteriorating on VHS (either an original or copy) with all of those drop outs and lines running through the solo on ""Inca Roads"", as a clean DVD. In this day and age of bonus features; extra footage, interviews, and easter egg( the single most annoying feature ever) it seems like too many people expect extras with the VHS to DVD transfers. Plus there is NO fan base with a bigger sense if entitlement than Zappa fans who for some reason feel Gail Zappa should personally consult each and every one of them on what, when, and how things should be released. It's thrilling that the stuff is being released at all considering what a niche market Zappa's catalog is in this day and age of american idol. If you didn't like Dub Room then don't, don't buy it now, but if you did or have always wanted it, this is your golden opportunity. The more product you buy the better chance you have of getting the Holy Grail on DVD (and we all know what I speak of)

And now for my review,  this is great stuff, reasonable price, nifty packaging, no episode of Simon and Simon in the runoff at the end. Who could ask for more?",1178150400,7,1243,4.285106382978723
2412312,2,B000BC8SW4,"...and that's a bad thing.  The strobe-like editing makes it impossible to actually see any of the performances, and the silly banter between tracks is dreadfully dull.  Then, when the music gets really good, they cut back and forth to the claymation, which would be cool if you could actually focus on it.  Not only that, but the claymation has its own sound effects which drown out the awesome music.  I wish someone would go back into the ""dub-room"" and unmix this thing so we can see actually see (and hear) the performances.  The best parts are the few nano seconds we get to see Ruth Underwood do her thing.",1172880000,3,613,4.536363636363636
2412313,5,B000BC8SW4,"This is one of my favorite concert dvd's. The reason for this is that it proves why Frank is such an incredible composer, performer and bandleader. The concert clips are outstanding. The line-ups of band members are outstanding. You can see how they follow Zappa's lead and play their hearts out for THE MAN. Zappa always hired the best and this footage proves it.

I shake my head in wonder why the Zappa trust does not release these legendary performances in their entirety.

The montages that intersperce the footage are not lengthy and not at all as bizarre as in BABY SNAKES.

All in all, this is concert footage from one of the true masters along with an astouding crew of musicians. This is what live music is all about and this is a snippet of what makes Zappa Zappa.",1169683200,,775,4.521428571428571
2412314,2,B000BC8SW4,"I bought this expecting some excellent concert footage from Frank Zappa.  And that's what I got! Yet, I also got footage of a random Italian guy picking his nose and swearing.  I know you should expect weirdness from zappa, but the weirdness in this DVD is way over the top.  Also, The Dub Room Special was made for laserdisc back in the 70's, so in order to fit in the material he wanted to fit, Zappa had to cut off entire sections of songs. In fact almost every song during the concert had missing footage.  For example, Zappa's awesome guitar solo during ""Montana"" was completely cut out, and to cover it up, Zappa put in a two second clip of the italian guy picking his nose.  Lastly, the specific songs from the specific concerts were poorly chosen.  There were so many good tunes being played during those concerts sampled in this DVD, and with the capacity of DVD's these days, the Zappa Family Trust should have just included the whole concerts. This DVD is a waste of money.",1168300800,5,984,4.5
2412315,5,B000BC8SW4,"This is a must-see for any Zappa fan.  This DVD runs about 1.5 hours and features performances from the Zappa bands of  August,1974 and Halloween of 1981, including Ruth Underwood, Napoleon Murphy Brock, Chester Thompson etc.  The '81 band features Rommy Mars, Chad Wackerman and Steve Vai.  There's a bunch of extras at the end and some amazing clay-mation too.  I bought it for a gift and it has been played extensively and brought to me to watch too.

I can't recommend it highly enough.",1168300800,,490,4.705882352941177
2412316,5,B000BC8SW4,"If you admire Frank Zappa, you will be very happy if you buy this DVD. As a longtime fan - bought the first album when it came out, as if you're interested - thought the first few albums were incredible, then drifted away, interest rearoused by Apostrophe. This is from that era, and presents the hardest, funkiest rock, mingled with Zappa jazz, sound effects, interjections of various kinds - with a true cast of characters, especially the great Napoleon Brock. This is a musical and visual work of wonder; check out the xylophonist! FZ is a guitarist practically on the level of Hendrix, and trhe other musicians are worthy of him. Trust me, if you appreciate FZ, you'll love this DVD.",1164931200,,687,4.68595041322314
2412317,5,B000BC8SW4,"Of all of my regrets in life (which are many), my one regret is that I never got to see a live Zappa show (though in all honesty I was born in 82 and so that severely limited my capabilities).

As a teenager I listened to Zappa's albums with fascination (spending hours trying to guess what time signature certain passages where in) and with absolute delight (it's hard to listen to Joe's Garage and not laugh at the reductio ad absurdum the he draws in relation to music censorship).

However, ""The Dub Room Special"" was my first introduction into witnessing FZ perform live, and I was absolutely blown away. I am still yet to find adequate words to describe it, but I want to world to know that the performances you see here defy all description.

I wish I could go into great detail (i.e. describing each song) about the disk, but I don't want to rant. My best advice to those who are familiar with Zappa's albums, but not his DVD's is to start here. And for those of you who have never gotten to hear him, take a chance and check out the Dub Room Special. You will not leave the same person.",1160006400,7,1095,4.331707317073171
2412318,2,B000BC8SW4,"Frank Zappa was a genius in many fields. Music composition, lyricist, satirist, guitarist. One thing he never excelled at was creating movies, even though he certainly tried hard.

This movie suffers from many bad decisions. For example, mixing footage of Frank's best band playing some of his best material with footage of his worst band playing his worst material was just stupid, at best. Granted, this band is still good; they're all excellent players. They just lack the type of personality his Roxy band did. When you say the names ""Ruth Underwood, Chester Thompson, Napoleon Murphy Brock, and George Duke"" I (and many zappa fans) instantly bring to mind the specific person. Scott Thunes? Chad Wackerman? Granted, Ray White and Steve Vai (!) are recognizeable, but Vai's role in the band is underplayed. He's hardly ever on screen and when he is, it's often when he's not playing guitar! A major annoyance was during his one guitar solo of the DVD, the the camera was never on him. Not even once. Was Frank a little jealous of Stevie Vai?

That's not the biggest problem with the 1981 portion of the DVD, though. It's the song selection. Did Zappa really think these were the songs that best represented this band? Nig Biz, an unreleased song, and rightfully so; pitfully mediocre both in melody and arrangment, it's only partially saved by biting lyrics, which are hurt by their own self pity. Jesus Frank, if it was that bad in the record business, quit the business! Nobody was forcing you to make music, bud. Cocaine Decisions wasn't a bad song to use here: it's a good little biting zappa pop song. The performance is weak though. E.Z. Meat was a bad choice because the lyrics are misogynist (not unusual for frank) but stupid (quite unusual for frank). It should have been an instrumental, as the music is fine, but the lyrics really let the song down. Flakes was good song to have on here, and the performance of the song is great, even if Ed Mann struggles with his Dylan innotations. The fact that this song predates this band is telling; the songs that orginated with this band are obviously weak. Frank also wears a hideous red shirt with short hair, and mostly walks around the stage with his mic, like a frigging Vegas singer.

The earlier footage is much better. Frank's Roxy band just blows away any of his other bands; the complexity of their playing and arrangments, and the humorousness and personalities helped push Frank to new levels at the time. They're obviously having a lot of fun on stage, and they play these great songs with lots of verve. A plus is seeing Approximate, mostly unreleased, played out in three different ways. Easily the best part of the DVD. Unfortunately, Frank screwed up here too; he over uses Bruce Bickford's admittedly stunning claymation much too often during this section. He also utilizes fast paced frame by frame editing, switching them fast enough to give the average viewer an epilitic fit. No doubt he thought this was cutting edge; yeah, maybe in 1945. This type of dumbness in his editing shows how far behind Frank was in making movies. The claymation was also irritating because often during the most interesting sections, Frank would play up to 5 to 6 mintues of claymation, all edited frame by frame. Ugh. In a 9 minute performance of Inca Roads (transcendent), over half of the footage is claymation. If that wasn't bad enough, he overdubs studio sounds (!) onto the claymation sequences louder than the musical performances!

The last nail in the coffin are the parts with the italian journalist. I refuse to say his name. What was this? Was this ""funny"" to Frank? A guy picking his nose? And singing some stupid ""dirty"" song in italian? Tengo Na blah blah is probably Frank's worst song, and this italian guy wrote the lyrics and sung it. Quite demenetedly, this song was released on the Uncle Meat remaster, an album Frank recorded over 20 years earlier! How stupid!

Any ways, besides the Roxy band stuff, I was mostly disappointed with this DVD. Frank didn't know how to make a good concert DVD, trying to be ""cutting edge"" and ""funny"" and failing. It's a shame, because his 1981 band is actually generally better than they seem on here. Avoid. Get Baby Snakes.",1150156800,5,4238,4.760544217687075
2412319,3,B000BC8SW4,"Ok after reading the other reviewers I can see that I am not alone when I say that this DVD is not very good- is it worth the $12? Yes, I would buy it again given the choice but it is still disappointing. Zappa himself was obviously enamoured of the claymation process and I also think that it is really neato but for God's sake put the claymation sequences at the very end of the DVD and not RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BLOODY GUITAR SOLO!

Anyway, I feel better now. Go ahead & get this if you have not yet purchased it- the live shots are worth putting up with the pap.",1147392000,2,571,4.008771929824562
2412320,2,B000BC8SW4,"I love Zappa. I've read nearly every book on him and seen almost all material available to the free world.

I have to tell you, this DVD stinks.

They've taken two awesome concerts, chopped them up with some scenes from ""Baby Snakes"", and called it a ""concert video"". Now, I know that Zappa ain't the kind to just put out something normal. That wouldn't be fitting. But come on! I'd rather have a DVD of the 1974 concert, the Halloween concert, and ""Baby Snakes"".

If you are a REAL Zappa fan, you will buy this and have a brief chuckle over the zany antics at Compact Video. Then, you will become extremely frustrated with the concert footage.

I suggest you buy it anyway, to complete your collection. Then go buy ""Does Humour Belong in Music?"" and ""Baby Snakes"". Hey, the price is right!",1144022400,3,790,4.503496503496503

2412322,5,B000BC8SW4,"The best part of this film is the concert footage. If you never got the chance to see Frank live (Like me) and you generally dig LIVE music, you'll totally dig this video.

The band with Ruth Underwood, Chester Thompson, George Duke, Tom Fowler and Napolean Murphy Brock was always my favorite Zappa band and this video is the ONLY video record of this line-up. For that reason alone, this video is nearly priceless.",1142294400,3,416,4.621621621621622
2412323,5,B000BC8SW4,"Just finished watching this DVD. I have been a Zappa fan for many years and have seen him in concerts may times at the Palladium in NY. I was really impressed with the footage from 1974, they had a great band. The band consisted of Ruth Underwood, George Duke, Chester Thompson, Tom Fowler, Napoleon Murphy Brock and Frank.

The other band was from the 1981 Halloween Show featuring Steve Vai, Bobby Martin, Scott Thunes, Chad Wakerman, Ray White, Ed Mann, Tommy Mars and Frank. I remember being at that show and the only negative thing that bothered me was Frank leading the band with a baton.

I think all of Frank's fans will appreciate this DVD, I know I do. Since Frank is no longer with us I am glad he left us a great library of works on CD and DVD.",1142121600,2,756,4.316901408450704
2412324,4,B000BC8SW4,I love the live footage from the '74 show. The band then was just fantastic. The '82 is amazing too but the 8os synth sound just bugs me. I guess you couldn't really get away from it back then though...ha. There is cool footage of claymation that happens during some of the live stuff. The only thing that is kind of a bummer is that the sound effects accompanying the claymation happens during the music...it really takes away from the music.,1141257600,,443,4.481481481481482

We fans were spoiled by Zappa's devotion to us, and now that he is gone it silly of us to think any one else is going put on the stash and imperial and do the same. Its not perfect but it is still F.Z. live!

This DVD is Frank's 1992 version of the film.  He cut several short bits in order to fit it onto Laserdisc (which had less space and subsequently a shorter running time than a DVD.)  You lose a little, but not too much.

While it's still Frank's cut, it's too bad that the original show wasn't used instead.  It would fit on DVD, so it's a shame that the Zappa Estate didn't see fit to release it instead.

It's still a delight for FZ fans who never saw it, but you Crazy Persons will be better served if you seek out the full-length version.",1140912000,,710,4.207407407407407

The 1974 lineup has to be one of the most talented ensembles ever assembled, but instead of being treated to a healthy dose of uninterrupted musicianship, we get bits and pieces of songs and waaaay too much claymation. Inca Roads in particular is pretty much ruined by the overdubbing of ""studio effects"" to match the utterly uninteresting claymation scenes that fade in just after George finishes the opening vocal section. The claymation/overdubbing continues through the balance of the song, thereby rendering it unlistenable. This band is FANTASTICALLY musical and ""tight"", but we miss most of their efforts due to the editing. For what we are allowed to see, Ruth and Napoleon put on a heck of a show.

Also, the nose picking guy is a complete waste of skin and adds NOTHING to this. Not funny, not the least bit interesting...what the heck is this drivel included for??

2412333,5,B000BC8SW4,"I grew up as FZ started his musical career.  I'm embarrassed to admit I bought Freak Out! because of the purple hair on the cover.  I quickly realized this guy was a unique composer.  I even sent for and own the libretto of Absolutely Free.  He lost me when, I think for budget reasons, his band became loaded with guitarists around ""Waka Jawaka"" time when I heard him at the Poughkeepsie Civic Center but when I heard ""The Best Band..."" I knew I had to follow his work again.  IMHO, Civilization Phaze is his masterpiece.  This is a neat reminder of how terrific his bands were, even at the very beginning.  I remember a NYC Town Hall concert where the band came out on the stage, one by one and added their part to what was already happening.  I also remember hearing/seeing a Mothers band w/ Jean Luc Ponty.  Oh, and how about that classic, original band that played at Queens College? That would be something to see/hear again!  Hey, Gail and Dweezel:  is there any footage of that band?  Anyway, at this point in my life I recognize that FZ is one of the 20th Century's greatest composers/musicians/philosophers and I miss him.

Now, if you don't mind the scatagorical themes that Frank does in all of his movies, you won't mind this release either.  I had this back when they first offered it and like mentioned in the other reviews, it came in a black VHS box with a white typed card DUB ROOM SPECIAL.. no frills... but this packaging is fantastic.  This one has an extra little bit added in, the Moon Unit VALLEY GIRL behind the scenes tid bit.. which was good fun to see..

But the film itself is a LOT of fun.  The two concert footings -one from 74 and the other from 81- are two very good bands for very different reasons, and to see them playing songs so fined tuned and worked so hard by FZ ... was just thrilling.  I really enjoyed the 81 band rendition of 'Stevies Spanking' and watching FZ and STEVE VAI trade licks.. FZ looked possessed playing his leads, and never once looked at his hands or glanced anywhere but straight ahead.. you could really see his intensity while watching STEVE VAI play his lead (they over dub'd the video where you could see FZ playing while STEVE was jamming.. good effect).

Fact is, if you like FZ and wanted to see more video of him in a studio and on stage.. then, you need to stop reading this and order it.

I love it.  And will watch it many times more.

I have seen it twice and I have to admit I'm quite dissappointed since there's no improvement on the vintage footage and the extra material it's absolutely useless (Moon Valley feature, discography,...).  This is the SAME VHS or Beta(max) we all ordered from Zappa's mail order service back in the 80's, but packaged under a DVD mask.

Most of the tracks from 1974 and 1981 are edited, cut and/or mixed with additional images.  Also there are lots of ""noises""  added to some tracks.  Bootleggers who used to offer the 1974 performance must be very happy with this edited video.

I wish they had included a CLEAN, FULL and CONTINOUS live performance at KCTTV Culver City Studios on 08/07/1974 with Zappa / Mothers and SEPARATELY the 10/31/1981 New York Halloween Party concert at the Palladium.  Also they could have put as a worth - having extra ""The Amazing Mr Brickford"" video (the man behind those great clay animation).

If you want an in deep review, here is:

- (1974) DOG BREATH (VARIATIONS) / UNCLE MEAT
Uncomplete: no intro. and there's fade at the end.  Original film is heavily distorted with additional images (mostly from Brickford), video  effects and external ""noises"".  Nevertheless you can see for brief moments Frank playing drums with Ruth Underwood (former Ruth Kammanoff)

- (circa 1974) PORTIONS OF MR BRICKFORD: Formerly shown on Baby Snake VHS / DVD
- DIALOGUE AT COMPACT VIDEO (the place where this video was made)
- (1974) ROOM SERVICE
Uncomplete: Maybe introduction is lost and there's CUT at the end.  This is a classic Zappa talking - number.  Just listen to that funky back up rhythm by Fowler, Duke, Underwood & Thompson.

- (1981) NIG BIZ  Uncomplete.
- DIALOGUE AT COMPACT VIDEO
- (1974) APPROXIMATE
Perfect.  Complete number. Zappa at his most DADA / Experimental phase.  Simply great.

- (1974) COSMIK DEBRIS
Right after Approximate comes this number which is sadly cut and glued to Cocaine Decision

- (1981) COCAINE DECISION
Uncomplete number.  It's mixed with video images of Massimo Bassoli a man supposed to be funny.  Not for me.

- (1982) MASSIMO BASSOLI IN PALERMO / DIALOGUE AT COMPACT VIDEO
- (1974) MONTANA: Introduction is lost. Seriously cut at the end.
- (1982) MASSIMO BASSOLI - SINGLE:  Useless.
- DIALOGUE AT COMPACT VIDEO
- (1974) FLORENTINE POGEN
Beginning of original broadcast is mixed with images at Compact Video. Cut before the number really ends. Edited Frank speech ""Thank you. Chester's Gorilla was played by Marty Perellis""

- STEVIE'S SPANKING: This is an edited number from a longer one.

- DIALOGUE AT COMPACT VIDEO
- (1974) STINK FOOT
Introduction is lost.  Heavily mixed with Mr Brickford clay animation and finally cut and glued to 1981's  Flakes.

- (1981) FLAKES: Uncomplete number.
- (1974) INCA ROADS
No introduction.  Mixed with Mr Brickford clay animation which at the same time is overdub with studio ""noises"".  The main part of this number was used for ""One Size Fits All"" album (except guitar solo). Parts of this number were broadcasted on The Midnight Special TV show back in the 70's.

- (1981) EASY MEAT: Uncomplete
- DIALOGUE AT COMPACT VIDEO",1132617600,61,3273,4.912408759124087
2412336,5,B000BC8SW4,"For comparison, this DVD has a feel somewhere in between Baby Snakes and Does Humor Belong in Music. Somehow, it turns out better than either of them.

The shows (concerts from '74 and '81) sound good, and there's plenty of fun interaction between Zappa and both bands. We finally get to see Ike Willis really play, which is a treat, and Ruth Underwood blazes at times. The concert footage is broken up with the usual goofiness, and Zappa, as always, seems amused by everything and everyone around him. And while the Bickford clay animations got tiresome to me in Baby Snakes, they don't go on forever here. I actually enjoyed them.

Apart from maybe the live Hotel Room sketch, the pacing is great, and unlike Does Humor Belong in Music, we don't get songs cutting away to an interview partway through.

Lastly, a warning: the liner notes indicate that both concerts will presumably be released on separate DVD's. Given the relatively low price of Dub Room Special, that's fine by me as I'd rather not wait. But...it's something to keep in mind.",1131840000,3,1046,4.736263736263736
2412337,4,B000BC8SW4,"""The Dub Room Special"" is the first FZ film I've ever seen, so I don't have the experience to bounce ideas off his other movies. The thing is, it probably doesn't matter. This is Frank Zappa concert footage!! This is another chance to take a glimpse into the world of Zappa! I'm not sure if too many people have seen the original VHS Dub Room...I'm guessing there's a good sized portion of people who haven't, so this is a neccessary DVD.

Bruce Bickford's claymation is very cool by the way, and there's also some interesting footage of Zappa and others locked up in a room during a street riot.

A short ""Valley Girl"" documentary can be found in the extras. It's a quick insight on Zappa ""the family man"".  :D",1131753600,,711,4.453846153846154
2412338,3,B000BC8SW4,"I bought the VHS of this same program way back in the day. It came in a black plastic box with a simple typed white card insert reading Frank Zappa - The Dub Room Special. Probably cost me $30 in the mid-eighties. Quite a bit more than the price of this DVD, especially considering the value of $30 20 years ago.

I'm rather disappointed with the editing job done at the end of Florentine Pogen on the DVD version. It cuts rather abruptly to the next segment featuring Frank in the Dub Room, introducing others around him. In the VHS version at the end of Pogen (one of the show's centerpiece performances), the audience is afforded time to applaud and Frank introduces ""Chester's Gorilla"" as (road manager) Marty Perellis. The DVD edit omits that important piece of band lore and is really shabby from an audio standpoint.

Featured in the next segment is the guy who creates custom stained-glass windows. Frank holds up a photo of the guy's work and the DVD is black and white in that entire segment. The VHS shows the photo of the beautiful glass work in great color detail. Why the bad edit and use of black and white in a most inappropriate place? As well, there appears to be smudges on the screen while Easy Meat is being performed. Nothing I recall from the old faithful VHS tape.

The sound quality is, in my humble opinion, not much better than the original stereo VHS. The musique concrete at the beginning menu section is really great synclavier music and beautifully mixed in 5.1 surround. The program itself is merely in stereo and, as a result of that juxtoposition, sounds muddy by comparison.

All that said, the show is worth seeing. The '74 band performances are really a treat. Ruth is all over her station, banging away at the various percussion instruments at a frantic pace, ever careful to look back in Frank's direction for any possible signals at any possible time. Fun to watch. Of course Nappy, Duke and Chester along with Ruth made up many Zappa faithful's favorite line-up. They're all here along with Tom and, of course, Uncle Meat himself!

If you can get a hold of the VHS - and preferably not a bad copy - you'd have just as good an audio experience with at least more complete video enjoyment, sans the special features.

The Valley Girl segment is a nice feature, though. Made for TV in '82, it features the young Zappa clan with Frank as a ""family man"" when he's not on the road. A nice portrait of Frank the musical genius and video pioneer, filmed at the time of the Dub Room Special in progress.

I'd probably give this DVD 4 solid stars, but I have a better version to compare it to.

Keep it Greasy and Don't Let Your Meat Loaf! (Heh Heh Heh)",1131494400,3,2684,4.496919917864476
2412339,4,B000BC8SW4,"About time they put this sumbeetch on DVD!

I love this special.  It's just Zappa having fun with the video concept.  He's taken great live footage from two concerts and spliced them together with Bruce Bickford claymation (which is always fun, if you can't enjoy watching this stuff, you've got no business trying to enjoy FZ's music), Zappa clowning around in the ""Dub Room"" where they mixed and mastered the concert footage, FZ and his strange Italian buddy Mossimo, and a few bits of interview footage.

The footage from the earlier show featuring Napoleon Murphy Brock, Ruth Underwood, Chester (later he got to play drums for Genesis, lucky bastard) Thompson, Tom Fowler, & George Duke.  They do the improved (and hilariously pointless) ""Room Service"" bit.  We get the ""played"", ""sung"", and ""danced"" rendtitions of the reall-freaking-difficult-to-play jazz instrumental ""Approximate"".  Napoleon steals a lot of this show (which is pretty hard to do when you're on stage with FZ).  It's all a lot of fun to watch and hear.

The Early 80's performance featuring Steve Vai on ""stunt guitar"" has slightly less engaging music in my opinion.  As usual all of FZ's crew (particularly Ray Price) are in fine form, but Zappa seems a little less connected with this band.  Still some good songs (""Nig Biz"", a hilarious indictment of the Warner music label; ""Stevie's Spanking"", a graphic recounting of Vai's experiences with an unorhtodox groupie)  It would have been great to have seen some of the better tracks from this line up, like maybe ""Charlie's Enormous Mouth"" or ""Why Does It Hurt When I Pee"".

The in between stuff is fun to a degree, depending on whether you get this for just the music (which if this is the case and you call yourself a true Zappa fan, shaaaaaame on you, tsk tsk), or if you dig watching Zappa have his dry, improvisational ways with all around him (and they all seem cooperative enough).

In short, good tunes, fun footage, Zappa with two of his best line-ups (although, unfortunately, no Terry Bozzio).  Makes you kinda wonder what sorta stuff he'd be doing if he were still around.",1131235200,3,2109,4.868347338935574

2412341,4,B000BC8SW4,"This Dub Room Special DVD seems quite controversial.  I purchased the DVD, and feel strongly that this is more enjoyable than watching the ""Baby Snakes"" or ""Does Humor Belong In Music?"" DVD's.

It's a little frustrating to find out both of these '74 and '81 concerts are planned to be released on DVD's in the future, as I was thinking I wouldn't have bought this DVD if I had known that.  However, just like Frank was the master at putting together the YCDTOSA CD series from various band era's.... I enjoy how he has this DVD going back and forth between the '74 and '81 bands with other stuff in between some songs to break things up.

The song selection from the '74 band is excellent, with ""Florentine Pogen"" being the highlight.  And I enjoyed the claymation during the ""Inca Roads"" guitar solo, even though I'm a guitarist myself.  I was laughing my ass off at the claymation.

There are a lot more songs I would have liked to have heard from the '81 band, but I must say that ""Easy Meat"" is excellent.... a good example of a vocal/rocker with beautiful instrumental parts too.  Steve Vai fans will also appreciate seeing/hearing ""Stevie's Spanking"".  Vai and drummer Chad Wackerman were both only 21 yrs old at the time (1981).

And finally, I must say that the AUDIO & VIDEO quality are excellent.  Better than either the ""Baby Snakes"" or ""Does Humor Belong In Music?"" DVD's.  I have Paradigm Signature series speakers with a Rotel receiver.  You must have a hearing problem if you think the audio quality is poor on this DVD.",1130284800,3,1535,4.599264705882353
2412342,3,B000BC8SW4,"I have to wonder why they went to all the trouble to put together this rather nice DVD and not totally re-furbish the sound, which is pretty bad.

I had to turn the volume on my TV up quite a bit to get the ""show"" parts of the DVD up to a listenable level. Yet, I had to turn the volume back down at the menu screens, which have been spiffed up with digital-quality sound from apparently the same source performances.

And you KNOW Zappa recorded all this stuff for himself; the 1974 performance is most of the basic tracks for a good portion of the Mothers' last LP, ""One Size Fits All.""

All this said about the audio, visually, this is a fun piece of work. The bands both look to be having a pretty good time, especially the '74 group. And the quality of the video is quite good.

I could watch Ruth Underwood forever.

The liner notes imply that CD versions of both shows featured here are on their way; god I hope so but I hope they sound a lot better than this.

Still, if you're a Zappa fan you're going to buy this and I think you'll be pretty pleased -- just expecting a little more.

2412344,3,B000BC8SW4,"All these reviews from people who have never seen the DVD of The Dub Room are utterly useless. I actually bought the disc (what a concept) so I can actually review it. Wow.

The disc includes selcection of performances from 1974 and 1982 tied together with bits by Zappa and Massimo Bassoli,  though I have no idea why Zappa thought this guy is funny by picking his nose. Lets face it, Zappa is about music. The 1974 selections include a rather ordinary Montana and Cosmic Debris as well as a bit with Napoleon Murphy Brock called Room Service which goes nowhere. As they rip into Inca Road, just as we're trying to enjoy Zappa's great solo guitar work, we're subjected to Bruce Bickford's clay surreal animation which gets annoying really fast. A highlight from the '74 group is Approximate where the band plays the incredibly syncopated melody, then attempts to sing it, then dance it.

The '82 section fairs slightly better from a band perspective as they generally seem more alert and enjoying themselves but the selections are weaker. Florentine Pagen and Steve's Spanking come off as decent. The perk here is Flakes since it has so rarely recorded.

Also included in the disc is a six minute documentary recorded after Valley Girl became Zappa's biggest hit. It's a nice addition but really doesn't any additional insight to who Zappa was. On the plus side, the makers of the disc obviuosly put a lot of time into the audio remixing it in crisp and clear surround sound.

I can only moderately recommend this disc for the die-hard Zappaphite. For everyone else, I would suggest the DVD of ""Does Humor Belong In Music?"" where the band and track selections are much better and you really get the feel of a full Zappa show.",1129766400,52,1726,4.701986754966887

This one was one of the tamer videos out, although it's still funny and entertaining. It gives you an inside look at his creative process, along with some straight forward performances with the group of muzishnins that he created some of his finest compositions. It seems that the times that he was touring with Ruth Underwood, George Duke, Napoleon Murphy Brock, Tom Fowler, and Chester Thompson, (and Marty Perellis as the gorilla), he had the most fun. I have a recording of FZ with that band in Harrisburg, PA circa '74, and he always seemed to be enjoying himself.
There are other more recent performances from NYC in '81, that are amazing as well, plus some claymation from Bruce Bickford.

8084939,3,B000BC8SW4,"With the ""Dub Room Special"" we see another example of Frank Zappa's limitations as a director of visual material. His music is brilliant but the videos refuse to present the music as is. I am very sad about this.

In the first section Zappa shows claymation of Bruce Bickford over ""Dog Breath Variations/Uncle Meat."" I'd rather see the band play the music than the animation (which entertains for one or two viewings at most) but the bigger problem is that mediocre sound effects for the animation are played over the music.

Later, video of Massimo Bassili picking his nose is shown over ""Cocaine Decisions"" with silly sound effects thrown in. Again, sound effects ruin the audio from the band's performance.

For me, a fan of the music, these additions make the video unwatchable.

It's interesting (and maybe even ground-breaking for the time) that Zappa used an editing facility as a studio to construct this video but he wastes time interviewing Compact Video employees, having them say how unprecedented his process is.

Just show the music.

There was more than one Frank Zappa (composer, guitarist, band leader, social commentator, vaudevillian clown, adolescent humorist, etc.) and the one to whom I am devoted is the composer and musician. With his videos he consistently shows the adolescent humorist to the detriment of the music.

(Dweezil is assembling a video of footage from the original Roxy Theater performances. I trust he has the sense to show the performances in a straightforward way that his father would not.)",1231286400,,1533,5.0355731225296445
