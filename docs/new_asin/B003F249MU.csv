8532072,4,B003F249MU,"This is a very good workout DVD. For the beginner it is very good, but also a good starting point for the almost in shape getting back into it. I used it for the first 5 weeks of the 9 week process, can use it longer of course, and I lost 10 lbs along with a more balance diet. Now in my six week I am using a lot of the exercise learned from this DVD into my own superset workout. The CORE workout in here is really good. I recommend this DVD to anyone looking to get back into exercising/weight training or for the beginner or busy person who only has about 15 - 20 minutes to work out. You can stack, do more than one of the exercises back to back, and get a really good workout. About week 3 or 4 you start to stack some of them, but could do it earlier on.",1297123200,,761,3.8535031847133756
