1823735,5,B000083C6V,"When Family guy was cancelled I was mad. Very mad. It was the funniest show i had ever seen, its humor may not appeal to everyone but it was crude while still managing to be clever. When I found out about this DVD I was very happy. It is possible to watch an episode 100 times and it would be funny every time. This has 29. Now Thats a lot of fun. This will be the best thing ive ever owned. And i own a pet cheetah.",1041811200,2,416,3.793103448275862
1823736,5,B000083C6V,"Although I don't think the show was better than the older episodes of the Simpsons, I do think that during the time it was on the air it was better than the Simpsons. The show is really fond to pop-culture junkies or just people in need of a good laugh. Unfortunatly, FOX cancelled it and it's not coming back. To all of you angry fans that hate FOX for cancelling it, don't. It wasn't FOX's fault. The show stopped because the cast and crew split up. Luckily (in my opinion) South Park has been getting funnier. But still I'm thankful that the FOX production companies are immortalizing this classic series on DVD.
The thing I like most about Family Guy is the range of inteligence that it appeals to. Whether your a know-it-all super genious with high standards or a complete moron the show is sure to please because it's funny on so many levels.
For fans of the show this is a must buy. For newbies, find a friend who is a fan of the show. Unless your in the category of the pretensiously snobby, Family Guy is sure to please.",1041465600,52,1029,4.364583333333333
1823737,5,B000083C6V,I was so upset when the family guy was cancelled because it was by far the funniest show on television at the time.  If you watched any episodes you know that it is more mature than the simpsons and in my opinion a lot funnier.  They cancel family guy but keep futurama?  Sure the show wasn't getting the great ratings it had from the past seasons but that was because they kept moving the timeslot.  I wish for the family guy to come out with new episodes but i'll take the dvd box set as a consolation prize.  I have all the episodes on my cpu but i must own them on dvd.  Great show for anybody who likes to laugh.,1041465600,14,617,4.0578512396694215
1823738,5,B000083C6V,"(Meg)- ""Your hogging up all the fan! (Chris) ""Oh yah....well your hogging up all the ugly!"", this series is better than a lot of other animated shows running. The writing is pure genius, a non stop laughfest!

1823739,5,B000083C6V,"I have to start off by saying that the ""Family Guy"" is not a better show than the ""Simpsons"". It's still one of the greatest shows that Fox has put out. To some audiences the ""Family Guy"" could seem really offending, but as long as you can take a joke you'll love it.",1041465600,,267,4.056603773584905
1823740,5,B000083C6V,"THIS CARTOON TV SHOW WAS ON FOX. IT WAS ONE OF THE FUNNIEST SHOWS I HAD EVER SEEN. IT WAS ON AND OFF THE AIR NEVER GETTING A GOOD TIME SLOT,IT WAS TAKEN OFF BECAUSE IT DID NOT RECEIVE ENOUGH VIEWERS. THE SHOW WAS MADE BY THE GUYS WHO MADE THE NAKED GUN MOVIES. SO IF YOU LIKE THOSE MOVIES YOU WILL LOVE THIS SHOW IT. IT IS ONE OF THOSE SHOWS WHERE EVERYTHING IS FUNNY AND YOU ARE ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT WAITING (FOR NOT A LONG TIME) FOR THE NEXT JOKE!

1823743,5,B000083C6V,"I love Family Guy.  On my computer I have every single family guy episode ever to air on fox.  Still, I plan to buy this DVD when it comes out.  Family Guy is by far more witty and raw than the Simpsons (although also more crude and distasteful.)  I cannot wait for this to come out, and I hope they release all Family Guy episodes on DVD (as well as produce more episodes on Fox)",1040947200,4,380,4.026666666666666

I named my cat, ""Stewie"".  If you get as much out of this show as I have, whatever your circumstance is, I empathize with you. Of all the animated shows, this one stands out if only for the live orchestra; the animation is only good enough for the writer to scrape by. That might be to protect the health of the viewer when the story stretches credulity. The characters and setting of this show remind me somehow of, ""Golden Girls"", and I mean that in the kindest sense; the voice-talent is the best, and they had terrific writing. How can you animate an ad-lib?

I'm happy i gave family guy a chance and i enjoy watching it and it's been on the air for quite awhile but the episodes are still as good as the first seasons episodes.

However, some of the humor is so original and so clever, it sorta won me over.  Not completely.  But I tune out the most offensive material.  I watch just to see what original ideas they will come up with in jokes.

Each of the characters has a distinct personality.  There is an alcoholic dog.  A buffoon of a father.  A narcissistic and perhaps sociopathic genius infant - too soon to tell. A neighbor in a wheel chair.  It's just an amusing escape from sober reality.  Don't watch it when the kids are around.

1824242,5,B000083C6V,"I absolutely love Family Guy and I am a huge fan of the show since I was in high school. This is the first and season seasons. This is the debut of the entire cast like the entire Griffin family. Peter (my favorite): a lovable and dim witted oaf father, Lois: the attractive wife of the family. Chris: like father, like son, but a talented artist. Meg: the unattractive and unpopular daughter of the family. Stewie (my favorite): the youngest member of the family and he is obsessed with world domination and wants to kill Lois. Brain: the dog of the family also an atheist and a drunk. Here is the complete episode guide.

Disc One:

Death Has a Shadow: The debut of the entire Griffin family. After getting fired from his job by sleeping in the job after drinking all night with his friends, Peter applies for warfare and he spends the money for his family, but he gets arrested for warfare fraud.

I Never Met the Dead Man: Peter is addicted to television until he crashes the satellite dish and Meg takes the blame for a car. Stewie hates vegetables and he is planning to destroy them.

Chitty Chitty Death Bang: It is Stewie's first birthday, so Peter cancels the reservation at a pizza restaurant due to his foolishness and he is a failure to set up a birthday party for his son. Meg gets a new friend, but her friend had a secret that she is a member of a cult.

Mind Over Murder: (my favorite) After being put under house arrest for punching a pregnant woman, Peter sets up a bar in his basement so he can party with his male neighbor friends and Lois is a hit for his male friends after singing for them until their jealous wives show up. Stewie starts to teething and he wants the pain to go away.

A Hero Sits Next Door: Debut of the Swansons. After accidently injuring a fellow baseball player, Peter had two choices either find a replacement for the player or else. Peter found out that his new neighbor, Joe is a baseball player, but one tiny problem: he is a paraplegic. Joe is a hit with his family and it makes Peter jealous, so he does whatever it takes for his family to think that he is a hero to them like foolishly attempting to stop a bank robbery.

The Son Also Draws: After Chris gets kicked out of the scouts when Peter ran over the head scoutmaster, Peter takes his family to New York to meet the scout headmaster until Lois became addicted to gambling and she loses the family car, so it is up to Peter to get it back. Chris is skilled with drawing and he is too nervous to show his work to Peter.

Brian: Portrait of a Dog: Due to a heat wave and having no air conditioning, Brain was persuaded to join the dog show until he starts a heated argument with Peter and he is fed up with the leash laws in Quahog.

Disc Two:

Peter, Peter, Caviar Eater: After one of the Griffin's family members dies, the Griffins inherited a hundred million dollars. Peter foolishly gives away the entire money in a charity auction and he attempts to get it back.

Holy Crap: Peter's religious zealot father is retired, he was persuaded by Peter to visit his family and his religious rules and traditions are driving his entire family crazy until Peter foolishly kidnaps the Pope to help him reconcile with his father.

DaBoom: Ernie the Giant Chicken's debut. After getting a bad coupon, Peter starts a fight with a giant chicken. He becomes so paranoid about Y2K after a man in a chicken suit warned him. He locks his entire family in the basement, Y2K came true, and he became so controlling in a new city that he set up with his friends.

Brian in Love: After peeing all over in the house and in the supermarket, Brain starts to have a mid-life crisis and he finds out that he is in love with Lois.

Love Thy Trophy: After getting embarrassed at school, Meg wants a prada bag, she gets a job at a pancake restaurant and she schemes to get bigger tips, but she loses Stewie to the Child Protective Services. Peter and his friends start a feud over a trophy that they won together in a float contest at a parade.

Death is a Bitch: After weaseling his way to get out of a hospital bill by lying that he is deceased, Peter has to take Death's job after Death gets injured.

The King is Dead: After a director dies, Lois was appointed to the theater as the director of a famous and popular musical play. Peter is made as the producer, but he takes it too far and Lois quits in anger.

Disc Three:

An entire remake of the original Star Wars trilogy in an animated format using the Family Guy characters and sense of humor?  Brilliant! Yeah, there were parts that felt like they were reaching a little bit, but overall a lot of fun.

1824631,4,B000083C6V,"Okay. I loved the first three installments of the Star Wars film saga. The ""first three"" would be ""Episodes IV, V and VI"" in the convoluted reckoning of George Lucas. Those films really were something special back in their time, but popularity and familiarity does take a toll. Hence the spoofs. ""Family Guy"" fans will appreciate these - wait a minute. ""Family Guy"" fans will have already seen these and everyone else won't care one bit. Thus my review is superfluous except for the important and cranky things I have just said about George Lucas. Though to be honest, crankier and more important things have already been said about that, too. The box was nice.

But for fans, you will definitely appreciate the attention to detail in recreating key scenes from the original while enjoying the twisted dialog from the Family Guy characters. My only regret was that they ran out of the more memorable characters when they got to Yoda. But that is a minor problem and one that was somewhat out of their control since the second two installments were an afterthought based on the success of the first show. Yoda does have one of the best lines in the Trilogy when he describes the tree that is strong with the dark side of the force as basically a strange element from the original story that ""stops the show dead.""",1388707200,,758,4.460431654676259

Yes, the 3rd installment (""It's a Trap"") is in the widescreen format. It was the last episode in Season 9, a season in which all new Family Guy episodes were converted and made in the widescreen format. Previous seasons were in full screen. They're just keeping up with the times, and if people are really going to complain about ""not knowing"" or that ""the description never said that blah, blah, blah..."" maybe people should look at the customer reviews. Because a good majority of them have complaints about the widescreen format.

Definitely worth checking out on DVD where it hasn't been edited for TV... looking forward to the Final Chapter when they do Jedi, should be as entertaining as the last two, Family Guy is a great show,prob be another 2 years before I get chance to watch the next one Ha!",1337644800,,862,4.294478527607362

Anyways I checked the special features and they include some deleted scenes, and some table reads (if you don't know, watch them). Overall, Robot Chicken does it better, but Family Guy isn't too bad, so it was worth the purchase.

I selected this on Amazon over buying it locally (I've bought Something Something Someting Dark Side by itself locally when I found it in widescreen but the other two in stock were full frame) solely because it is listed as 1.77:1, which is 16:9 widescreen.

When I received it, there was nothing indicating aspect ratio on the outside of the packaging, so I was skeptical. I opened it and sure enough it is 1.33:1, FULL FRAME aspect ratio. So, tried the return option and it was eligible for exact replacement only. Really? You're going to engage in fraud and ignore consumer protection laws and not make good on a bad description?

I called customer service and explained the situation to a rep and they assured me they would replace it with the correct item. She put me on hold and made a couple of calls. She informed  me they would open up the replacement and make SURE it is the advertised aspect ratio.

Well, today I received it, opened it (it was still shrink wrapped, which tells me they did NOT inspect it!) and of course, it's 1.33:1 FULL FRAME. The product listing very clearly states the following:

# Format: AC-3, Animated, Box set, Color, Dolby, DVD, Subtitled, Widescreen, NTSC
# Language: English
# Subtitles: English, French, Spanish
# Region: Region 1 (U.S. and Canada only. Read more about DVD formats.)
# Aspect Ratio: 1.77:1

Just never got around to getting into it, y'know?  I am, however, a lifelong, diehard (insert more hyperbole here) fan of Star Wars.  I'm hoping that anyone who's a fan of both has already purchased this or has seen it, so this review is geared sort of toward my fellow ""noobs to Family Guy"".

So, for 20-something bucks, this seemed like a good buy.  Some cheap entertainment on Blu-Ray, no less!  Well, the picture quality, as many others have said, was not something that justifies a blu-ray treatment.  I mean, we're not talking Pixar here, guys.  It's a cartoon.  I got the regular DVD of Archer and it was frankly kinda gorgeous.  I was more impressed by the quality of the Archer DVD than I was by the Family Guy Blu-Ray.

As far as the box set's treatment of Star Wars, I honestly can't remember a Star Wars scene that was left out of this!  It literally tells the whole story of the original Star Wars trilogy in like an hour and a half.  With lots of parody, of course.  A lot of it is funny.  A couple parts made me LOL Out Loud (tip of the hat to Monk... miss ya, man).  But a few of the jokes were taken too far (by that, I mean they went on too long).

I'm told this is kind of common with Family Guy, and maybe it's Seth MacFarlane's sense of humor, but some of the jokes went on WAY too long.  Like the Obi-Wan character singing the majority of ""I've Had the Time of my Life"" with dancing stormtroopers in the background (gobbling up precious minutes).  Without wanting to get into spoilers, there are a few other gags that just drag on and on.  If you're a fan of this, then you've got it made.  I just found it irksome.  One of them was actually really funny, but my smile fell after the gag passed the 45 second mark, or what seemed like it.

All in all, though, I WAS entertained by this.  The opening crawls were hilarious.  I may have peed a little.  There is strong language, but my 7 year old (DON'T JUDGE ME!!  I'VE NEVER SEEN THE FAMILY GUY!) barely noticed and enjoyed watching the shows (though I feel so dirty).  Thankfully the sexual innuendoes flew RIGHT over her head.  But there are those, too.  So that's something.  :)

I also think I would have gotten MORE out of this set if I had any familiarity with the Family Guy characters.  Never having seen the show, and seeing as how the Star Wars characters are portrayed by these characters, I think I missed a very important (and presumed) aspect that may have really entertained or charmed someone else.  I'm emotionally and socially hobbled by my lack of Family Guy familiarity.  So there's the disclaimer in long form.  :)

Bottom line is, hey, it's like 20 bucks.  If you're a Star Wars fan, it'll be very nostalgic and probably asks some of the questions you've been asking for 30 years.  Often I said to myself ""Yeah..  why IS that??"" when a character pointed out a glaring inconsistency or error in George Lucas' writing/science/sense of reality. It was fun.  And it was 20 bucksish.  Do consider the DVD version, though.  I don't know the price difference, but if its significant, know that the quality difference is not.  May the Schwartz be with you all.  And no, the Schwartz is not involved in the plot of this film.",1297209600,9,3357,4.369529983792544

-  The  second makes a big leap in picture quality, but the actual content is not as entertaining as the first.
-  The third has a slight visual improvement over the second which makes it's picture the best, but i couldn't even finish it after I went 30 minutes without so much as a chuckle.  The third film was certainly an afterthought; its only purpose is to complete the trilogy.

-  As many people have said, all three movies come with a second disc for installing a digital copy.  The first film even comes with a DVD version. This inconsistency again makes me think these discs weren't manufactured for the purpose of selling together.

1825143,3,B000083C6V,"Watched all three episodes last night and felt pretty disappointed by this set. The first 2 episodes, Blue Harvest & Something Something Dark Side were hilarious, but Its A Trap was pretty lame.

Many of the other reviews cover this too as right at the very beginning on the scrolling text it states that they didn't want to do Return of the Jedi, but Fox made them and much of the episode was written by the assistants or interns. Many of the jokes are rehashed and unfunny.

Its A Trap is the only episode presented in widescreen. Very disappointing especially on a Blu-ray release. Also, Blue Harvest is not even in HD quality. It looks like its just plain dvd version slapped onto the blu-ray disc. you see many jaggies and unsmooth lines. Something Something Dark Side is in HD, but not widescreen.

At $22 for a blu-ray set, even with all its downfalls, its still not a bad deal. Plus, like I said, the first 2 are great and made me laugh the whole time. But, I do feel very let down by the laziness in this release.",1294444800,7,1022,4.396825396825397

This The Empire Strikes Back parody has some great features, some of the graphics were fabulous and even looked like copies of the original - it took me back very nicely. As for the new take, a lot of it went OK but it was by no means consistent. As is Family Guys want, there were several `out there' moments where a scene diverted into something completely different. Some worked well, others less so, or they went on too long. This is part of Family Guys thing, taking things too far and then taking them further again. I like the way the show makes fun of itself like this but too much and you begin getting bored - in Darkside this happens a bit much. One of the main problems is that a lot of the focus is on Chris/Luke Skywalker. He's just one of the less funny characters and it's hard to make scenes he's in hilarious. Conversely, by sticking so close to the original story, Brian, regrettably, gets very little to do. There are still some great laugh out loud moments (the Imperial Walker with the leg injury!), most of which occur in a rush near the end, so it's a worthwhile watch but not one that I think will bear repeat viewings.",1294272000,,1296,4.188

Putting in the other two movies will make you realize the vast improvement in the quality compared to the first. The extras were for the most part entertaining and interesting. The commentary was very similar to the commentary on the DVDs of the show except with more information on production, ideas about S.W., etc. I've very satisfied with my purchase, especially for the price of $23 for the set.

But I will say I thought it was just as good as the first two. Really enjoyable. Family Guy fans will not be disappointed with this set. It is a little sad to see it end, since from what i understand there are no plans for making Episode I, II, and III parodies. Hopefully they do something similar, maybe with Back to the Future or Indian Jones, two franchises they are constantly referencing.

1825163,4,B000083C6V,"First, the bad news... if you are buying this whole TRILOGY package instead of just the newest parody titled ""It's a Trap"" so you can include the first Star Wars parody in Blu-Ray format, SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!

I really wanted to see SOME KIND OF picture quality improvement like the 2 newer parodies on Blu-Ray.  After viewing disc 1, I just have to assume it was a primitive ""upconvert"" to the Blu-Ray format.  There was NO improvement in the sharpness of the drawn lines, colors are standard-def bland, and stair-stepping is evident in the resolution.  Of course, disc 1 is still full screen as expected, so ""Family Guy: Blue Harvest"" gains absolutely nothing on Blu-Ray over the previous DVD version.

Now, the other two discs are very good on Blu-Ray with sharp lines and colors that really pop!  Nice transfer, and the Blu-Ray difference in quality is striking even for animated content without complex textures.

All 3 discs are entertaining parodies of the original Star Wars trilogy, but like the TV show I'm sure they will offend some people some of the time.  You probably knew that already ; )

In summary, if you already own the first two, go ahead and buy ""It's a Trap"" on Blu-Ray or DVD to complete your library.  New good laughs, even if not as fresh as the first two.

BOXED SET:
This box set comes with the first two seasons of Family Guy. The front cover shows the Griffin Family together having a fun time. The back cover shows and alternate Stewie photo and a description of the Volume One boxed set with bonus material and such. Inside there three thin plasitc cases for the discs. The front of each case has the main cover photo of the griffins on a different colored background. The backside of the cases have Episode Descriptions and what features are on the disc. Each disc has different artowork with different characters on them.

SLIM SET (you get this if ordered from Amazon now):
This slim set comes with the first two seasons of Family Guy, just like the original. The front and back cover's artwork is unchanged. However, the inside is much different. The inside has no episode descriptions. Just the disc number and episode title. There is little to no artwork inside. The discs artwork is the exact same, though.

FINAL THOUGHTS:
If you would prefer to get the boxed set with artwork and such go for it. But order it from another site. Amazon only ships the slim sets now. If you don't mind. Go for the slim set. The outer appearence is still nice overall.

1825178,4,B000083C6V,"Movie - 3.5

Having been merely an off/on viewer of Family Guy throughout the last few years, I find it a bit surprising that for as few episodes as I've seen that I still like the show a lot, yet won't go out of my way to catch up on the ones I've missed. I only discovered Blue Harvest two years ago (a year after it actually came out) and finally got around to watching both it and Something (x3) Dark Side a few weeks ago. With that said, I'm also a big Star Wars fan (grew up watching the original trilogy many, many times as a kid). Combine the raunchy, vulgar, witty, humor and repetitious mannerisms of Peter and company with the ageless classic and you've got quite the satirical homage. Essentially, you get the mixed bag of potty-mouth dialogue, wordplay, and slapstick shenanigans any Family Guy fan would expect, only it's all been re-adapted. Characters from the show play themselves under the guises of their supposed Star Wars counterparts, and do so pretty well. It's not so much a retelling of George Lucas' epic sci-fi tale, so much as it is a long episode of Family Guy using those elements to entertain us. It's not a flat-out parody like Spaceballs either, but it's fun to watch for both its quirkiness to the new and respect to the old. Some of the jokes and one-liners are hit or miss leading to laugh-out-loud moments or complete and utter silence, while some of the characters' actions are just blatantly vulgar for no reason (perhaps to surprise the audience since this is normally edited for TV), though I'd offer to wage MacFarlane just wanted to get the unrated jitters out of his system. I'm also a bit disappointed that both this and Blue Harvest were only limited to 2 acts instead of 3. Not that I want them to make full-length features or anything, but for something as contextually rich as Star Wars I think a longer run time could've benefited for a much more entertaining event. But alas, this is all there is, and we'll just have to wait for the Return of the Jedi parody.

Video - 4.5

While it's only 2D animation and at an aspect ratio of 1.33:1, Dark Side looks remarkably good. Colors are especially vibrant in recreating the Family Guy color palette, while at the same time showing a great amount of line detail in the backgrounds and Star Wars designs of the feature itself. I especially thought some of the more action-packed animation sequences had a very fluid presentation to them and made for an overall pleasant picture. There are very few instances of any real problems like blocking, aliasing, or other artifacts, though there may be some slight banding in the sky of Cloud City, but it's not too noticeable unless you're actually looking for imperfections. If anything, the only real downside to the video is the 4:3 format. The presentation itself looks fantastic, but the black bars on the side kind of make you wish they had utilized that extra space to make a more spacious and fulfilling image. Other than that, great job by Fox.

Audio - 4.5

For the Star Wars fan in me, I was stoked to hear John William's score in lossless audio. The main theme, Imperial March, and other classic pieces are recreated to sonic perfection and sound absolutely stunning as a substitute for the real thing until Lucas decides to get off his butt and start remastering a Star Wars' BD release. Sound effects have a good deal of depth and dimensionality as well, with separation coming off mostly from the front, and a little bit on the sides. Dialogue is clear, though a smidgen too loud from the center, sometimes overpowering the rest of the sound field and even causing me to turn down the volume at points. LFEs aren't too frequent, but given this was a TV show the overall sound design still possesses excellent fidelity, while at the same time giving you a sample of what Star Wars will hopefully sound like when it comes to BD.

Extras - 3.0

The special features are pretty limited. Topping it is a very entertaining commentary with a big chunk of the crew responsible for making this and Seth Green. It's informative, fun to listen to, and a good supplement for the product itself. Other specials include a table read of the unfinished script, the surprisingly detailed making-of for the poster art, a Pop-up Video-esque factoid feature for the film, an animatic comparison, and a very short preview for the upcoming Return of the Jedi spoof. All of the video stuff is in HD, and while somewhat lacking overall, is still a good deal for such a short movie.

Overall - 4.0

If you like Family Guy and Star Wars equally, this is definitely worth checking out. If you're not quite either, then some of the mixed elements from each might be a turn off. I personally Dark Side to be pretty funny, albeit a little misfiring at some points and way too short overall. But it makes for some good laughs if you're feeling the mood for that sort of humor. Presented by Fox with excellent A/V quality and a decent set of extras, Family Guy Presents: Something Something Something Dark Side comes recommended for fans.",1277337600,,5057,4.61

I've watched it over and over again, its hilarious.  Something, Something, Something, Darkside was very disappointing, not nearly as funny as Blue Harvest.  The jokes were flat, and rushed through.  I get the use of all of Quohog's residents playing their various parts, but the Yoda character was really bad. Could the dialoge have been any lamer? There was nothing funny whatsoever in that entire sequence.  It pains me to say this because I'm that big of a fan of Family Guy, but this was a total waste of money and a huge disappointment.",1277251200,6,692,4.585365853658536

You really have to know ESB to get all the humor in this movie.  Even though I didn't get all of the jokes, this was still hilarious.  Way funnier than Blue Harvest, which to me was not bad but not great.  We were all rolling, and when my Star Wars ""fanboy"" loved ones explained the really inside jokes it was even funnier (for example, when Leia/Lois tells Han/Peter she loves him, and his response (won't spoil it), my friend was like, ""oh my god that's what it always seemed like he was saying in the movie!"").  Genius and insightful.  Some of MacFarlane's work really misses the mark (I beg you not to ever watch ""Cavalcade"" because it is horrible beyond words), but this is the best work he's ever done, in our three humble opinions.",1276473600,,1012,4.583333333333333

1825197,5,B000083C6V,"After the success of Family Guy's retelling of STAR WARS in the animated special BLUE HARVEST, it was only a matter of time before they told their own version of THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK.  Time's up and the Family Guy's version is here with SOMETHING SOMETHING SOMETHING DARK SIDE.  Currently, this hour-long episode hasn't aired yet and at the moment is only available on DVD and Blu-ray (but we all know Seth MacFarlane is just as big a money machine as George Lucas and the episode will play either on tv or cable at some point).

The story begins the same as BLUE HARVEST did with the power going out and Peter Griffin entertaining the family by continuing the story of Star Wars, but with some particular Family Guy twists.  Darth Vader (Stewie) is using the full control of the Empire to find the Rebel Alliance and wipe them out once and for all.  Luke (Chris) wants to be a Jedi, while Han (Peter) and Leia (Lois), Chewie (Brian), and C-3PO (Quagmire) try to evade the Empire, eventually escaping to Cloud City to visit with Han's old friend Lando (Mort Goldman).

SOMETHING SOMETHING SOMETHING DARK SIDE does a good job at staying true to the Star Wars saga and continuing the story began in BLUE HARVEST, while interjecting various pop culture allusions and typical Family Guy humor.  Just as THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is a better movie than STAR WARS, so is SOMETHING SOMETHING SOMETHING DARK SIDE a better episode than BLUE HARVEST.  BLUE HARVEST is about 8 minutes shorter in length than SOMETHING SOMETHING SOMETHING DARK SIDE, but there are times in BLUE HARVEST where the plot drags a bit. That doesn't happen in SOMETHING SOMETHING SOMETHING DARK SIDE; scenes move quickly from one to the next, the gags don't stop, and the story moves along at a brisk pace.

My favorite scene in the episode is when Yoda is training Luke.  The scene is done as a montage and is intersected with the actual music and footage of the Russian Boxer Drago training in ROCKY IV. The juxtaposition is hilarious.

The extras on the DVD include a commentary, an option of playing the episode with pop-up facts (and unlike most DVDs with this feature, you can actually fast forward through the episode and still read the pop-ups), a table reading sneak peak of WE HAVE A BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS (the Family Guy take on RETURN OF THE JEDI), and a featurette with the creators of the SOMETHING SOMETHING SOMETHING DARK SIDE poster.

Overall, this DVD is something that appeals to both Family Guy and Star Wars fans.  It does have some foul language, so parents beware.",1268092800,,2554,4.661469933184855

Still I recommend it to anyone who enjoys Family Guy and is a fan on the show.  While it is not as good as Blue Sky and you're not as likely to see as many celebrity cameos it is still worth your time to watch!  Enjoy!",1266969600,,595,3.9747899159663866

The first time I saw Blue Harvest, it was hilarious.  All the inside jokes with Star Wars, and the characters.  I loved it all.  It wasn't the case with this one.  There were times I felt it dragged and not too funny.  There were some jokes I felt were forced.  Again, this might be becuase it wasn't doing anything new.  Blue Harvest broke the ground, and this one is just following it.

I'm not saying this was bad, hence my 4 star rating.  There were plenty of hilarious parts, but the first one was 5 stars.  It also made me a little more patient for the third one, and not as excited.

The only thing I hate about this is that they release it on blu ray, but it's dvd quality.  I was expecting ""Simpsons HD"" quality.  But no...just same ol' Family Guy quality.  They didn't even make it widescreen (except the blu ray menu...whoopie).

Judging by that philosophy, the best parts of Blue Thunder must have been profanity, gay jokes, and Consuela the maid.

There is a mode where you can watch the movie again but with some notes around the movie explaining facts or other anecdotes, but that's pretty much about it. There's not any bigger special features or ""making of"". One thing that also let me down big time, is that there's only 1 english audio track. I mean for a blu-ray title worth as many great blu-rays out there (star trek) they could at least include more audio tracks (spanish, french...)But nooooooo. I liked the Spain spanish dub on a PAL version of blue harvest but this one only has english track so that was a big let down for me.

Maybe it's just sequel jitters, and the third will be better, but frankly, I'm now far less excited about the third instalment, ""We Have a Bad Feeling About This""... in fact, after watching ""Something Something Something Dark Side"", I really do have a bad feeling about the third instalment.

I was disappointed in no wide-screen (I know, I know, it's just a cartoon, but....) and the extras were pretty weak (but when aren't they usually?).

For some reason, 'Something' didn't grab my attention the way 'Blue Harvest' did.  The first one was so dead-on with scene by scene and the follow-up, while hitting many of its marks, just didn't.  It threw in way too many stupid things (the guy w/the ice on Hoth) and a Rodney Dangerfield bit.

If it is possible to feel bad for a cartoon character, while I laughed and laughed and laughed at Meg in both episodes for her brief appearances, you gotta feel bad she is once again slighted.

I see reviewers here who are shocked at language and content of 'Family Guy'.  While some of the non-bleeped stuff threw me for a second, never once did I think it was out of the realm of possibility.  The same can be said for each Sunday night episode.

2.  No uncompressed audio.

For those who know, Blu-ray's have plenty of room to spare and this was only an hour long video, so nothing should be spared. Instead, it seems like movie companies only wish for our hard earned money and dole out these movies because we are too eager to wonder what the faults are.

As stated in the commentary by MacFarlane and his team, spoofing Empire Strikes Back is much challenging than A New Hope. With numerous storylines and a number of new characters, the Family Guy universe has only a limited amount it can add. While Blue Harvest felt like a spoof of Star Wars, Darkside feels more like a typical Family Guy episode with typical cutaways and reflexivity.

The jokes were simply not there--this time around they simply did a half-hearted rendition of ESB with a few dumb jokes thrown in there.  There was no real effort to actually make this funny in any way.

Now is it worth buying is the real question, especially given that it'll probably end up on tv at some point.  Well, the answer really depends on your love of the subject matter.  As with the other reviews, there's been criticism for this one being less funny than the other, but that's not surprising given that Empire Strikes Back, the movie parodied, is such a strongly made movie.  In some ways, it leads the movie to being more of a retelling of the film, rather than an actual parody, and so its not as funny as blu harvest, which is so easy to parody. Its not bad, just not as funny as before.

So, you're desire to own this depends on your level of devotion to the source material.  Its funny, but not as funny as before.  Also, please note: the DVD version does NOT contain a digital copy, like blue harvest did.  That is only available for the blu ray version apparently.

I know what to expect from Family Guy, but I really wish that they would have toned down the profanity and sexual references in the Star Wars episodes.  My son is 12 and likes to watch family guy.  I let him watch it only when supervised and there were a few times when I felt uncomfortable watching this with him.  I'm really shocked that George Lucas allowed it.  I found the profanity and sexual references, for the most part, to be unnecessary and unfunny and felt like they were thrown in just to shock.  Other than that, it was a decent show.

The first half was great, and I laughed constantly.  However, it felt like the writers either lost the will to keep that level of humor going, OR rushed to meet a deadline that they had to finish work on it, because the second half of the show honestly just wasn't that great.  I thought both the Yoda and Lando characters were terrible and added very little comedy to the overall effort.  I was disappointed that the golden four-letter ""F"" word made it into the DVD at least twice (I'm sure other reviewers will criticize me for this, but I had hoped I could watch this with kids around).  The lightsaber battle was less than stellar, and in my view Stewie just didn't fit as Darth Vader once that began.  And I could really do without the completely useless banter at the end between Family Guy and Robot Chicken, no matter how funny the two Seths think it is.

Like Blue Harvest, you really have to hand it to these guys for the animation.  The ships, the space combat, and even the imperial walkers are really well done and - if you took some of these scenes and interspersed them into the actual movie - I truly don't think anybody would notice the difference.  Great job, animators.

I enjoyed this movie more than any Family Guy episode I've seen in a few years. I may be biased because I've seen The Empire Strikes Back more times than most anyone besides another Star Wars fanatic.

I saw people turn on The Simpsons after South Park came out and it was no longer the new hip thing. Maybe that's all that's going on with other negative reviews. Maybe it's the cool thing now to trash Family Guy. Or maybe it's just people upset because they feel the quality of the tv show went downhill like me. But it's not fair to trash this movie because of the tv show.

The jokes are aimed at the Star Wars crowd so if you're not familiar with lines from the movies you're going to miss what the joke is about. It would be like watching them make fun of Paris Hilton if you've never seen her before. Having a skinny blonde ditz stand around and say ""That's hot!"" at every little detail doesn't make any sense at all if you don't know who she is and how she behaves. I think it's the same with these Family Guy jokes, but Family Guy has always been this way. How many jokes about 1980s tv shows and events are in every episode of the show? Maybe the movie is a bit more of an inside joke for Star Wars fans than the show is with its 80s jokes.

In fact, I know they did because some of the info in the pop-up video was well over a year old.
It really felt longer than an hour, even the second and third times when I watched the pop-up and commentary versions.  I loved the feature about recreating the original movie poster, that showed a lot of class on Seth and the Producers' parts.

Check out the level of detail in the ships, it's crazy.  I laughed out loud many times, got all the jokes and loved the profanity.  A+ Seth!

But, if you get it, just get it on DVD.  The Blu-ray is more expensive and just not worth it since upscalers in BD players will do more than enough to make this work on your HD TV, especially since it's not wide screen but the usual 4:3 SD ratio and the graphics don't have high levels of detail.

I did enjoy some of the jokes, especially when it's pointed out that the Rebels fleeing Hoth could go in any direction, but charge straight at the enemy fleet anyhow, but other jokes (like one about robot camels), went on a little long and just didn't work. Fortunately one of the great thing about ""Family Guy"" is that if you don't like one joke, just wait a few seconds and another will be along.

I'm not sure why they even bothered putting this on bluray when it doesn't even fit your HDTV.  Anyway onto the actual movie itself (hard to even call it that at around 55 minutes), in short its the stupidest thing Ive ever seen.  I actually used to enjoy this show but the content is almost all filler.  Most of the ""jokes"" are simply random allusions to other movies and TV shows that have no relevance whatsoever.  The writers still seem to think that its funny to rehash their old classic jokes, and make them take up long periods of time.  The ""its funny because the joke lasts way longer than it needs to"" isn't funny at all and is only put there to fill up the time.  Its hard to even consider this a Star Wars parody when almost every single joke has nothing to do with Star Wars.  Seriously they just branch off of the story and have their characters rant, and apparently they think thats brilliant.  Anyone can write like that, 5 minutes of plot with 50 minutes of random scenes featuring cultural references.  What happened to Subtlety?  Cultural references are meant to be subtle, to the point where you can easily miss it because it works with the plot so well.  Every reference on Family Guy is blatantly obvious because they almost always just copy a scene directly, and usually tell you what it is as well.  I guess that just tells you how stupid the writers think their viewers are.  There isn't anything clever or funny about this show anymore.  I'd say it was good for a couple chuckles, 55 minutes of a comedy and I hardly laughed.  My friends and I agreed that Family Guy needs to end soon, its just embarrassing.",1261958400,11,2056,4.493261455525606

If anything they only prove what is so wonderful about this franchise. Look if you are a family guy fan you will enjoy this movie. It has a good blend of the new family guy humor and the old. There was a reason that George Lucas gave the rights to seth for these movies. It's a great parody and it is very entertaining. If you don't want to sink your money into the dvd then just rent it but I am very happy that I have this dvd in my collection.,1261958400,2,583,3.907563025210084

  The last Star Wars parody made fun of the plot holes, it didn't have to rely on cheap comedy like the Juicy Fruit gum commercial, Don Knott's head on the Taun-Taun, intestinal worms for the AT-AT's, breaking the rule of three - the rule of three states that any comedy bit repeated more than 3 times shows a lack of comedy writing skills and is just filling in time such as (Peter's heavy breathing when cutting open the don-don, shooting the space worm in the asteroid field). The song and dance routine Chris did with his head ranks up there with Herbert's ""Dirty Dancing"" from the first one. Mort as Lando, thats seriously reaching for comedy. The Rocky montage inter-cut with Dolph Lundgrens training scenes is another example of filling in time.
  I could go on with the misses but it would be like writing a review of one of their TV shows. The hits were very few - Consuala the cleaning lady was hilarious, the Wompa-cookie monster was good (better if he didn't have the dialog), Han being frozen with his butt facing out was good.  All in all very few laugh-out loud moments and a lot of groans and misses. It doesn't have the replay value as ""Blue Harvest"" and this DVD would most likely just sit on my shelf and gather dust. I'm sure the other reviews will fill in the stuff I missed.",1261872000,,1571,4.348122866894198

I watched the table read in the bonus section, and there were a lot of hilarious moments that could have been added to the story. Some parts on the DVD weren't all that necessary, they could have removed those and added parts from the table read, and it would have been better. I know it would have been longer, but a lot funnier, too. A lot of the extra dialogue was laugh-out-loud funny. And, there was one segment at the end of the table read that went with the first movie. Listen to it, you'll know what I mean. So I think they should go back and redo this (even though they won't, but I think it's a good idea), and add some of those segments instead. This could have been a much better movie than it was. It was still funny, but lacking a lot. I mean, it's DVD, for heaven's sake! Even a full animatic of the original concept would have been a plus. They do it for full seasons, why not a special? If you're going to put something like this out, do it right, or not at all! Don't rush it just because of the holidays.

(On a side note, Another thing I'm also tired of is the stupid eco-cases. That's what this special came in, as well as a lot of other dvds. These can get your movies wrecked if you're not careful. They're not made good. I keep switching them out for regular ones that I bought. If they're going to put these in less quality cases, then charge less.

1825290,4,B000083C6V,"""Something Something Dark Side"" is a delightfully uncouth parody of ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" a strong followup to ""Blue Harvest"" (though I wish they'd have gone with a better title this time around).  The episode (I won't call it a movie; at under an hour, it's not a movie) is more or less flawlessly executed; there are a few too many insider references, showing how aware of themselves ""Family Guy"" and Seth MacFarlane have become, but overall it's hilarious and non-stop laughter, the kind we have come to expect from these guys.

True, the marketing campaign is horrible (or wonderful; depends which side of the cash register you're looking at).  If I were to include the marketing campaign in my rating, I would give this DVD two stars, simply because we have to fork out another $15 for a fifty-minute episode.  However, I didn't sink that low; I'm reviewing the DVD and the DVD only.  I will acknowledge that, to some viewers, it may not be worth it.  ""Something Something Dark Side"" is not a must-have addition to your ""Family Guy"" collection, but it's certainly an enjoyable one.",1261699200,,1091,4.776595744680851

I did not like how the cast ""HAD"" to say ""The F Bomb"" 4 times and the ""SH [ONCE BULL] Word"" 2 Times.

  I Know Seth MacFarlane [Creator Of Family Guy]is jewish and all but I personally feel that this movie did not need cursing to make funny. As a matter of fact,The uncensored words were the only times that i did not laugh at. This was the first ever Family Guy DVD that did not let you click CENSORED in Extras or Settings/Audio. Other than this censorship disturbinse this thing was pretty darn good!

1825294,4,B000083C6V,"Well it has arrived, the second instalment in the Family Guy Star Wars project. Now that I have finally seen it after months of anticiaption I have to say it was good, but it was definitely not what Empire was to New Hope.

First and foremost, this second installment was not going to be a surprise like the first one was. 'Something 3X Darkside' was based on the exact same map as 'Blue Harvest' Macfarlane and company stuck true to the origional film using their infamous humor and pop culture references. I will say there were some moments that caused me to laugh a lot so that was a plus. Another plus was the new characters introduced to play the rolls of the new Star Wars characters...yes even Meg makes her triumphant return. Still, there are some flaws here. I think that this new installment could have been a little different. An example would be how Peter tells the story, it didn't have to be another blackout. Also, the end of the episode ends up in another battle between Chris and Peter about Robot Chicken which makes no sense what so ever because Seth MacFarlane has plenty of Roles on Robot Chicken so Ihave no idea why he takes shots at it. Most importantly as a Family Guy fan I am not a fan of the fact that Stewie is an ambiguously gay character. If you want to use that comedy in the show its one thing, but don't bring that persona to Darth Vader. This is a movie that is suppose to be dark and it is really hard to lighten up a chapter such as this.

Though all in all I think it was a well done piece of work and I am looking forward to 'Family Guy: We Have A Bad Feeling About This', I sure hope that thre will be a total of six episode, because I think they will rip Episode 1 to know end which will be pee in your pants hillarious!",1261612800,,1761,4.207100591715976

I knew it was 54 minutes going into it, that didn't bother me. It just lacked the comedy of Blue Harvest. It was almost boring to watch. The table read on the bonus features was hastily shot and you cant even see all the cast members. This disc was not worth the 20 bux I paid for it on sale. Wait for it on TV unless you are a die hard Family Guy or Star Wars fan. Too many strikes against it, bad menus, full screen presentation (WTF?!), lack of content and lack of COMEDY.",1261612800,5,751,3.915032679738562
1825296,3,B000083C6V,"I love ""Family Guy"" and really enjoyed ""Blue Harvest.""  ""Something... Dark Side"" is another solid, well done spoof of a classic film.  However, the writers missed a lot of comic opportunities.  The jokes are either quite clever or pretty lame.  I got the feeling that ""Robot Chicken"" used a lot of the best bits in their SW: Episode 2 parody.  The good news is ""Dark Side"" looks fantastic.  Particularly the Hoth battle & asteroid field sequence.  Unfortunately, as with ""Blue Harvest"" the editors let the special effects & John Williams music do much of the work and too much of the dialogue is a word for word copy of the ""Empire"" script.  Simply, this comic parody needed more jokes!  As for the characters:  Peter Griffin is pretty annoying the whole film as Han Solo.  Lois doesn't have much to do as Princess Leia.  Seth Green is excellent as Chris aka Luke Skywalker.  Stewie is hysterical in everything.  Can't wait until the ""Jedi"" parody when they include Vader & The Emperor in more scenes.

Best bits:  The Cookie Snow Monster, Dack taking on the entire Empire himself, Wildest Police Chase through the Asteroid field, Stewie & the Emperor on ""Richard Marx,"" the Meg Cave monster, Dog the Bounty Hunter, Han tortured by a Paula Cole song, the Stewie/Chris duel, ""C'mon, join the darkside dude.""  the Storm Troopers misfire ""Have we ever hit anything with these?"" ""Tom Selleck!"" and some more I can't remember.  I get the feeling ""Jedi"" aka ""We've Got A Bad Feeling"" should be even better.  Since that movie was the weakest of the original trilogy and had the Ewoks, which are a comic goldmine.  Seth and co. should just limit their reliance on special effects and put the comedy first.  We don't need to see a shot for shot re-enacment of the asteroid field chase.  Everyone's seen the original a thousand times.  Copying the effects & music that closely just makes you wish you were watching the actual ""Empire Strikes Back"" instead.",1261526400,2,1946,4.7604790419161676

1825298,3,B000083C6V,"Family Guy is back with a second Star Wars Episode.  Honestly, it shouldn't matter if you are a fan of The Empire Strikes Back or not (I don't care much for A New Hope but loved the FG episode).  Here is what you need to know:  Is it funny?  Sure, there are some laughs.  Could it be better?  I think so.  Was it as funny as the last one?  In my opinion, no.

Is it funny?-The fact that the episode had me laughing in the first few minutes was a good sign (the probe droid scene was probably my favorite scene in the episode).  They do well to incorporate characters into funny yet familiar roles in the most random of times.  You will laugh at this episode, so that should be worth something.

Could it be better?-Well...that is kind of my whole point here.  There are so many missed opportunities in this episode to poke fun at Star Wars or other actors/actresses that are not taken advantage of.  No Luke kissing Leia jokes...no Lando crossing his friends...no jokes about the Ugnaughts (pig people)...come on!  Is it too predictable?  Maybe...but it still deserves a shot.  Besides the missed jokes, some parts were just not too funny, like the AT-AT jokes on Hoth.

Was it as funny as the last one?-I have my criticisms about Blue Harvest and they transfer over to this one too, but Blue Harvest just seemed to have the classic Family Guy humor to it whereas this one didn't.

In the end, I am glad they made this one, hopefully learned some lessons for when they make Return of the Jedi.  If you are a Family Guy Fan, definitely buy it as it is worth seeing.  Rewatch value is not as good as Blue Harvest, but still a worthwhile investment.

Thanks again for the laughs, Family Guy!!!",1261526400,21,1690,4.401294498381877

I won't go into specifics/spoilers but i will say this: the Blu-ray looks and sounds AMAZING. The special itself was surprisingly funny with a lot of laugh-out-loud moments. Bottom line is this: if you're a fan and you're on the fence about this, don't be. You will enjoy this. It's better than the entirety of the previous season's episodes, save for ""Not all dogs go to heaven"" (the ep. with the entire cast of TNG).

One final note: this is NOT for children. This is completely uncensored and there several f-bombs and just as many scenes with adult-content. Definitely intended for 18+.",1261526400,,843,4.5394736842105265
1825301,4,B000083C6V,"I'm old enough to have seen the original Star Wars trilogy as a first run in the theaters, and these things bring back memories.  Family Guy is unique in that it riffs on a lot of pop culture references, but they aren't all recent pop culture.  Somehow, these meld together in an enjoyable parody of what most consider the best of the Star Wars movies.

Without going into a lot of detail, they nail what needs to be nailed.  The filler parts are a little hit and miss, and you can tell how drawn out this process is by watching the table reads.  The famously ad-libbed scene from the original where Leia tells Han she loves him (after being so stand-offish the entire movie) is incredibly funny for pretty much anyone, while show-specific references (Stewie's confused sexuality, Cleveland falling off of something saying, ""No, no, NO NO!"", and so on) are geared toward Family Guy fans.

There are a few dry spells that seem rushed.  I get that Yoda is Chris's boss from the show and he has memorized every naked person scene from every movie, but why didn't he reference those with Yoda's unique sentence structure?  The Juicy Fruit ad seemed more suited to a regular episode rather than a movie parody.  The exact same ""electricity is out"" seemed to exist just to give them another 20 second spoof of something on TV.

As a whole, though, the package delivers.  For those not familiar with Family Guy, it may seem bizarrely tasteless at times.  For those that don't know the original Star Wars trilogy, the story references and the plot in general will probably be a little confusing as it's part two of a trilogy.  For fans of both, it's well worth the price of admission.",1261526400,7,1676,4.602693602693603

I have so been looking forward to this since the ""Blue Harvest"" episode aired in 2007 & the DVD release said they were going to do the Empire edition.  Since Empire is the best of the 6 films.

VERY DISAPPOINTED this did NOT air on TV 1st.  Should have.  Just because it was straight to DVD being able to cuss did NOT mean they should have & did when not necessary.

Empire edition is well done but not quite as good as Blue Harvest.  Yoda fell flat.  They could have done so much with Yoda.  They did NOTHING on how the character speaks.  They could have done all sorts of things with that.

WE DID NOT NEED JAMES WOODS.

You will never look at the Cookie Monster the same way again.

I was VERY DISAPPOINTED that they waited until Christmas week to release.  Yes, I know for Christmas presents but I did NOT appreciate having to go out to VERY BUSY stores to purchase.

We know, from the extras, they will be doing a Jedi edition.  I think we know what character choices they have for Meg.  Jabba or the Rancor?

I did enjoy this Empire edition course getting Back to the Future at the end & Brian was right  End of Empire Lando is wearing Han's clothes.

I don't know if it's because it's based off The Empire Strikes Back which I feel like is the worst of the trilogy, or is it because it feels like every joke has been done before. This felt like a Seth MacFarlane's version of Star Wars rather then a spoof. Unlike Blue Harvest, This one sticks closely to the plot of the Empire Strikes Back only throwing in a few already seen Family Guy jokes. Blue Harvest kept to the plot but also ventured outside the Star Wars theme to make some jokes(steeling couch from the trash, Robots getting high, etc.) This one tried, but didn't strike any home runs in my opinion. I'm not saying skip this movie, because I'm glad I watched it, but just don't expect too much. This movie was pretty predictable. I'm sure I could predict the next Family Guy movie mocking Return of the Jedi. If I had to guess, Meg would portray Jabba the Hutt. The sand trap that they try to throw Luke Skywalker into would have the voice of the ""hey ya'll"" gay guy saying something like ""Hey ya'll, I'm going to eat your hairy little leg.""

1825310,4,B000083C6V,"I can't think of a higher compliment, than paying for something you can get for free on TV. I don't mind telling you, I was more than willing to buy the ""Something Something Something"" DVD.

 The last Family Guy Star Wars spoof special Blue Harvest was a great retelling of the classic, this time the DVD heralds the special's first (legal) appearance. The power is out in the Griffin household and Peter shares the story of Star Wars the Empire Strikes Back. Familiar characters from Lucas' movies are portrayed by Family Guy regulars...Peter is Han, or Carlos Spicywiener as he likes to be known, Brian as Chewy, Lois as Leia, Chris as Luke. Also returning Quagmire and Cleveland as C3PO &  R2, and Stewie is a natural as Vader. New recasting include Chris' Boss Carl as Yoda, Lois' Dad Carter P. as the Emperor and as the only black guy in the galaxy,  Mort as Lando (disappointingly replacing Magic Johnson), Consuela as herself, James Woods, James Cann, and more.

The Empire Training video is good, the Dagoba Rocky IV training sequence is better, and worth the price of the DVD, actual moments of the Rocky montage are included, AWESOME and hilarious. Strange true facts about TEEN WOLF are revealed, Raggedy Andy and Tom Selleck, less revealing. I only wish Adam West could have been squeezed into this one.

Lotsa callbacks to the series for Family Guy fans to enjoy, Star Wars fan will recognize to shot blocking from the originals as well, many of the ship scenes look as good or better than the original.  Lotsa, well a few ""F bombs"" because this is a DVD. The usually shots at pop culture Ryan Seacrest & Idol, shots a ""link films"" like Back to the Future II.

Most of the bits work without fail, maybe not the pregnant walker.

Without being a spoiler, here are a few of my favs:

Han remarks in the asteroid field, ""We have 4 of the 5 main characters on this ship, I think we'll be fine.""

Stormtrooper remarks to their blasters, ""Have we ever hit anything with these things?""

Leia says at Bespin below Cloud City, ""Luke if that's you wave your right hand.""

Good news, the next spoof is on the way for Return of the Jedi. Extras include a bit of the table read also the poster painting process for the DVD cover.",1261440000,3,2229,4.5425

1825318,2,B000083C6V,"Not as funny as Blue Harvest. In the opening you'll read how Fox is dumb for canceling Family Guy for 2 seasons, yeah we heard that all before and it wasn't funny then either. BTW House and Fringe are the best shows on TV, oh and Family Guy is pretty good too. There are a couple of laughs but for the most part this was mailed in. What's up with Yoda? Wasn't anybody available to write him a joke or two?",1261440000,4,405,4.012345679012346
1825319,4,B000083C6V,"I have just finished watching the dvd. Let's get some things out of the way. First, this is not on Fox, but on an unrated dvd. What that means is that this is not for kids. There is a lot, and I mean a lot, of sexual innuendo, and the F word pops up more than once. I'd recommend this for kids at least 13-14 and up, but not suitable for young children. Second, this is not even close to as good as the first Star Wars parody, Blue Harvest. I bought this for $10, and seeing as how Blockbuster charges $5 for a rental, you're best off renting, not buying, unless you plan on watching this multiple times. On to the review of the plot. Seth has done his homework again. The menus closely resemble the actual Star Wars dvd menus, and obviously, the storyline closely follows the plot of Empire. However, condensing the 2 hour Empire, down into 54 minutes, some things get cut. Nothing too important, such as some of Luke/Chris's training on Dagobah, stuff like that. It begins just like the first, w/a powerfailure, and Peter telling the story. Seth makes sure to point out various plot holes, like all the electrical cables running thru the ice planet of Hoth, and how the rebels, with the vastness of space to chose from, flee Hoth right towards the Empire's blockade. The jokes come fast, and random, just like the episodes on tv. Some are hilarious, and others just stupid, such as the ""banged shin gag"" familiar to fans, befalling an Imperial Walker, or that a Walker is pregnant. There is a stupid musical number that did not work. There are great cameos tho, such as James Woods, and James Caan. Meg pops up briefly again, and has something to say about that. Nothing beats Chevy Chase's cameo from the first film tho. True to Star Wars tradition, Seth throws in a Wilhelm scream(Google it if you don't know). Consuela, the maid who recently gave the Griffins a hard time, shows up to give Stewie/Darth Vader the what-for. I enjoyed the Dagobah training montage, which incorporated actual footage from Rocky IV, although I did not like Yoda. He was dry, and boring, and didn't attempt to imitate the actual Yoda at all. The Evil Monkey is there as a Minok, and look for a great appearance by Joe early on as an Imperial Probe Droid. The Bounty Hunter scene aboard Vader's ship had me rolling on the floor, and look for the Giant Chicken as Boba Fett. Unfortunately, TGC was just sort of there, he didn't actually do anything. Of course, neither did Boba Fett in Empire, but this is a parody right? The ending was pretty good, incorporating the messenger from Back to the Future II. Then, cut back to Spooner St. so that Peter can take another dig at Robot Chicken, just like in Harvest. So, that's it. It's not as good as the first, but worth watching at least once, especially if you're a fan. As for the extras, you have the ability to watch the entire thing w/a commentary from Seth Mcfarlane, Seth Green, and a few others. I usu don't bother as you can't hear the dialogue. They disclosed a few interesting facts, but for the most part, they were just talking randomly. There's also a ""pop-up video"" version, ala VH1. That was pretty funny. There's a 10minute Poster Art short that was both informative, explaining how the artwork for the parody came to be, and disturbing, featuring the artists frequently removing their shirts, and trying to parody Blair Witch. Umm, right. Either way, 10 minutes is too long for this. There is a 50minute ""table read"" of the parody, where you watch all the voice actors sitting at a table, and reading the script. I watched a bit. It's interesting to see the actual people as they do the various voices, but beyond that, I can't see why you'd want to spend 50minutes watching that. There is also a 2 minute read from the upcoming parody, We have a Bad Feeling About This. It takes place in Jabba's palace when Han gets freed from the carbonite(in Darkside, it's not his face that shows. Let's just say the full moon is gonna be out at Jabba's palace. Nice.) Mostly, these table reads exposed the actors finding their lines a lot funnier than I did, and laughing constantly at stuff that just didn't seem that funny. Oh well, bring on the next parody!",1261440000,4,4195,4.52832674571805
1825320,5,B000083C6V,"I've been a Star Wars fan most my life, and have enjoyed watching Family Guy for some years now. I thought Blue Harvest was awesome and was a perfect parody in the Family Guy manner, so naturally I've been waiting for this to come out for some time now. It was all that I expected it to be, except for a few things.

It's great being such a big fan of Star Wars and to see my favorite scenes but with a twist. It is what makes these features so enjoyable to me. This one however, seemed to shy away from a few scenes, and I really believe it was because of the Robot Chicken Star Wars Specials (which I also recommend to anyone who enjoys Star Wars). The scenes which were left out which could have been great with the Family Guy characters are the discussion of Lando with Darth Vader right after Han Solo is being tortured (""Pray I don't alter it any further"" etc etc) and also any scene using Boba Fett. I also feel like they could have put a better character as Yoda, considering his popularity in the Star Wars mythos.

But other than those few flaws, I loved this Family Guy feature. A cookie monster wampa?! Han's classic ""i know"" response reimagined into a classic Peter response. So many great parts. If you enjoy Family Guy or Star Wars, this is a must have.",1261440000,,1268,4.279166666666667
1825321,4,B000083C6V,"The episode starts with - you guessed it - another power outage. Peter and the rest of the Griffins are once again left sitting in their living room, with nothing to do. Chris then suggests the retelling of another Star Wars story; and thus the 2nd spoof begins. I felt the writers could have mixed things up this time around. Did the exact same series of events have to lead to the story being retold? It just seemed lazy not to change things, even a little here. We see a similar occurance at the very end of the episode, when Peter once again insults Robot Chicken. However, on the upside, this time he takes a dig at Seth Green's Without a Paddle too.

The story essentially picks up where the first one left off; the death star has been destroyed; Darth Vader (Stewie) chases Luke Skywalker (Chris) on the planet Hoth; Luke has a vision of his dead mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi (Herbert), who tells him to go to the planet Dagobah and learn the ways of the Force from Jedi Master Yoda (Carl). Luke then has a vision of the Empire capturing his friends. Believing this to be true, Luke forgoes his Jedi training in order to save his friends and confront Vader. Meanwhile, Princess Leia (Lois) somehow manages to fall for Falcon pilot Han Solo (Peter). Basically, the galaxy is at war and we're along for the ride.

The writers seem to utilise the Family Guy characters extremely well in these specials, and here is no different. The casting of Mort Goldman in the role of Lando was inspired; he adds something special to the character, and I'm not just talking about the fact that here, he's a black jew. What you'll actually notice is that this time around, the writers have been forced to re-cast some characters into different roles; in the opening scenes, Joe is seen as one of Darth Vader's probe droids, while further into the episode, Meg plays the role of a space-slug, which is perhaps even uglier a creature than what we saw her play in ""Blue Harvest"". She does however get to speak this time around, which is an improvement of sorts. Still, I can't complain about these changes, as they certainly do ""work"". Consuela's scenes in the episode will remind viewers of her recent appearance in the season 8 episode ""Dog Gone""; she is just as stubborn and ignorant as ever, and not even Darth Vadar can get her to do what he wants. My only gripe I have with her however is that her scenes would have felt far fresher if we hadn't seen it all already so recently.

As for actual guest star appearances, we also see the first appearance of James Woods since ""Back to the Woods"" in season 6; but those looking forward to his cameo may be disappointed to learn that he features in just a single ""blink-and-you'll-miss-it"" scene. While James Woods is the only visible guest star to appear, we do see Ryan Seacrest (albeit with a different voice-artist) during a short American Idol gag involving Darth Vader cutting him to pieces, among others.

While all of this is going on, Peter also puts his own unique spin on Han Solo's relationship with Princess Leia. His constant attempts at winning her over are presented in true Family Guy fashion, but while some of the jokes surrounding this work, others simply fall flat on the ground. These scenes are probably some of the episode's weakest.

Like ""Blue Harvest"", this episode is packed to the brim with Star Wars references, which fans are sure to love. For me, these gags always seem to work. However, probably out-weighing these are references to gags from previously aired episodes of the show. All of these call-backs to old episodes, while they do utilise the Star Wars universe well (Peter's injured knee scene is redone using an AT-AT, for example), make the episode seem less fresh; perhaps the inclusion of more original jokes would have made more sense.

Fans will either be intrigued or irritated to discover that Stewie's homosexuality is in full reincarnation in this episode; Darth shows questionable interest in a revealingly-dressed Storm Trooper; even (and quite disturbingly) showing interest in being more than friends with Luke Skywalker, his son. I personally loved these scenes. While Stewie's sexual confusions are a common annoyance for many, many fans, here, we're given the best of both worlds. In this episode, ""old Stewie"" and ""new Stewie"" co-exist perfectly. The evil Stewie from earlier seasons of the show is reformed under the guise of Darth Vader, while the sexually confused Stewie that is the Stewie of today is still fully represented underneath.

The epic closing battle between Luke and Darth is handled brilliantly, especially Luke's line ""I would give my right hand for this day to just end"". The episode closes with a Back to the Future reference, which, if I'm honest, feels quite unnecessary, and out of place.

All in all, this episode achieves what it sets out to do - parody a Star Wars movie, and poke fun at it at every possible opportunity in the process. While a lot of the non-Star Wars related gags are recycled from previous episodes, the episode will once again please most avid Star Wars fans; the fact that it manages to stick to the original movie's plot so well means that even non-fans of the original movie series shouldn't become too lost along the way. Still, as aforementioned, the gags make this episode seem less fresh than ""Blue Harvest"" did, and with that, of lower quality. While the novelty has definitely worn off, the episode is still entertaining, and the vast majority will be pleased with this adaptation of a classic science fiction movie.

1825322,4,B000083C6V,"Let me start off by saying Family Guy's take on Episode IV was hilarious - one the best Star Wars parodies out there. So how does Seth MacFarlane fare with ESB... not as good IMO. Expectations were high as many fans consider Empire to be the best film of the saga - but this spoof suffers from too many Family Guyisms, and not enough Star Wars. The lack of familiar Family Guy cut-aways is one aspect of why Blue Harvest's story kept moving along. (Only the one scene with Watto was out of place) Many modern product endorsement spoofs kept taking you out of the movie - as well as the drawn out AT-AT injury and Tauntaun scenes.

Another thing that bothered me is the adult language. The original debuted on Fox, then later came to DVD. This time around, its the uncensored version we get to see first, and some of the cursing just seemed over the top. Not that Family Guy is a kid's show by any means, but Star Wars is for all ages to enjoy.

One last gripe, is the Region 1 availability of the Deluxe set with Boba Fett t-shirt. I certainly was ready to throw Fox a few extra dollars via Amazon by getting the best version, but am unsure if it was released in the US.

Overall, the show was very good, by spoofing many aspects of a film saga that our household has seen time and time again. While the negatives in this review keep me from giving it 5 stars, I will be watching this again, and eagerly awaiting a ROTJ spoof in the future.",1261267200,2,1440,4.248175182481752

It's not that I hate the ones that are chosen but there couldn've been a better choice for a couple, besides that I enjoyed Blue Harvest and I'll probably enjoy this. One thing that is kinda getting old is when people come on and write negative views on the show itself or a bad opinion just because they don't like it, if you don't like it, quite wasting your time talking about something that you can't change and change the channel, nobody is forcing you to watch it. If you think you can do better than get up and start your own cartoon. Obviously this show relates to people that enjoy not only the show but the movie that inspired this special homage. It's even more pathetic when people write a review on something they haven't even seen and if even if they did, they'd still think it wasn't that good because they already have the mindset that it's not as good as another cartoon that others say it's a rip off from which is total bs, grow up already and keep your negative opinions to yourself.

I just hope one day that people will stop judging things and enjoy things that can actually put a smile on lots of faces.

1. I loved Stewi with his funny thinking and his British accent, I think he's the best character in the whole show.  I also like the dog and Lois.  Peter Griffin was not the best character (dumb, has a stupid laugh) and his son has the same problem.
2.  The show has some good jokes now and then.

Cons:
1.  I agree that the show was insensible in discussing many issues, like people with special needs or other religions.
2.  There are many scenes with nudity and violence in this show, which I do not appreciate, especially for this ""family"" cartoon.  I also did not notice that this show brings many of the values for our society, despite what the song says (It seems today, that all you see, is violence in movies and sex on TV) !!  There is that pervert guy who's the Griffin's neighbor, that needs to be removed from the show !
3.  Season 1 has 1 CD but without any special features.  Season 2 has Behind the Scenes feature which lasted probably for few minutes.

Hope the next seasons are better.",1251072000,,1205,4.274336283185841

It doesn't have anything censored (but there is an option to) so parents don't need to fret too much.

No wait, one would have to have a mind, and the knowledge and/or the experience of pop culture, and pop world history to get most of the jokes in the show. The title alludes that it is a show for the family but it is certainly not. And guys, your chick, your wife or any female around when you turn this thing on will not like it. They will find something better to do while you watch it alone or with your guy friends. Now is that what you want? Oh. You say you're a collector and know the value of such things in the future market? Perhaps Fox saw the writing on the wall when the Family Guy writers took the path they took. It's Peter, Peter, Peter. The Simpsons is a slightly better show because it sometimes has stories focused on Marge, Lisa, Maggie and not only Homer or Bart. Maybe the Family Guy guys should consider writing more for Meg and Lois--the poor things always lose. (I don't think The Simpsons draw a big female audience either--gals don't care for animated shows as much as guys do.)

The rolling commentary given by whoever worked on the show was disappointing because they go silent when some of the show's grossly odd scenes show up, begging to be explained. It made me cry ""What were they thinking of here?""

A final thing: we've all gotten used to the way this show puts its humor across: the out of control cut-to vignette that has nothing to do with the main story line and usually summoned when one of the characters says ""just like the time when Peter, celebrity's name, historical figure, or pop culture name did 'something.' You'd think it would get tired after the run of this show but we've have gotten used to it to our detriment. On a recent viewing of the current broadcast run Stewie summons up a vignette and pauses. After a good 10 seconds he looks up at the ceiling, rolls his eyes and says, ""Oh, I thought we had something to come in here.""

1825402,4,B000083C6V,"This show is one of the funniest on Adult Swim. It now shows on Fox, and another channel, The CW, formerly known as the WB, which hosted some of my favorite tv shows: From Animaniacs and What I Like About You to 8 Simple Rules For Dating My Teenage Daughter and Jerry Springer (Yes, as embarrassing as it is to admit, I was once a fan for a few months or so. But don't remind me!).

The main characters are Peter Griffin, Chris Griffin, Lois Griffin, Brian  (the white pup), Stewie Griffin and last but not least, Meg Griffin who is tortured and put down by nearly everyone, especially her main family! Oh, joy!

This cartoon comedy takes place in a fictitious place in Quahog, Rhode Island and the script was finished in 1999, by the uberly awesome, Seth Green, and originally produced for Fox.

Peter is very funny, but he holds a somewhat considerate and compromising character, especially when it comes to his dear wife, Lois. Chris Griffin is a douche bag, to be put lightly. He's pretty clueless, likes to play with his pathetic little ""paddle ball"" thing, and thinks about how sad his non-existent sex life is! LOL He also has hinted at being confused at best with his sexuality. I think this has been made clear in 1 or 2 episodes. Once in a while though, when he's not being threatened by the Evil Monkey that scarily points to him from his closet, he manages to spew some thought-provoking knowledge to his parents, and sometimes to Meg.

Meg is the unlucky sister of Chris, and the daughter to the hilariously heavy-weight, Peter and the level-headed and overworked mother, Lois. She spends her days trying to fit in and be ""one of the guys"", but seldom does it work! As far as we know, she has had one boyfriend, and it probably lasted a short, short time. He was a loser anyway! She's relatively smart, but is highly ignored and unaccepted. Next is Stewie, the baby. He is pretty evil when it comes to the way that his brain works. If he's not plotting plans to dominate the majority of the world, he's conjuring a plan to kill his mother, Lois. Stewie talks, but for the most part, it seems that no one really understands him. Lastly, Brian is the intelligent white dog, who also happens to be a smart-mouthed drunkard. It's sad how he falls out of chairs, and falls onto the floor half of the time, but strangely, any human, especially Stewie, understands every word he manages to mumble.

This show is number 2 in comical relief to very few Adult Swim shows. The only one that I favor over said show is probably The Oblongs.

But when I saw the results of this idea, I completely realized that Family Guy is not a show to make a feature film out of. Aqua Teen Hunger Force even worked better as a movie than Family Guy did. The whole thing is just 3 modern episodes tied together. And if you read my other Family Guy review, you'd know that I'm not a fan of alot of recent Family guy episodes. And many of the great flaws and negativities of recent episodes are all present in this movie. And even worse, I did not laugh even once throughout the whole movie.

1825411,4,B000083C6V,"A little off-beat and funny without being very deep. It has become quite popular since its original failure as a primetime cartoon on Fox. Family Guy is one of the few shows to be dropped and then picked back up by the same network after a hiatus. It has been successful in the past few years on Fox's Sunday night lineup and nightly on the Cartoon Network. Futurama looks to be following suit by returning to tv next year.

I bought this because show is entertaining, but I am becoming more cautious about purchasing DVDs like these because I don't necessarily like supporting blatant liberalism in my entertainment. Family Guy has exhibited more political bias as it has gone along. I love political humour in small doses, but I'm sick of all the anti-conservative stuff that has not been very original or funny.

The best word to describe the show is ""irreverent."" You do not want to watch this with your grandmother or even your parents - they may not approve.

I've yet to figure out why anyone likes the show for any reason, least of all the humor. The show does have one redeeming quality, the voice acting. Seth MacFarlane, Seth Green and others do excellent work that I normally find funny, but the talent is wasted on this nonsense.

I love comedy and animation and am a fan of many animated comedy shows: The Simpsons, South Park, Futurama, Venture Bros., Robot Chicken, Bullwinkle and others, and I have yet to see anything in Family Guy that makes it worth watching once, let alone repeatedly on DVD. The jokes are strained and have nothing to say, unlike the dark, incisive humor one finds in early The Simpsons, or on Futurama or South Park. As for being funny without making any particular social commentary, there are still plenty of animated comedy shows that are better at this too, like Harvey Birdman or the now defunct but once great Sealab 2021.

Every joke in this show comes from something else; Family Guy can't come up with any jokes of its own. This show is just terrible. Like I said, no originality, horrible story writing, and pathetic episodes are what a show needs to suck. That's what Family Guy is. A real show is a show like The Simpsons, where their jokes ARE relevant to the plot, the stories ARE interesting and creative, and the originality is GREAT. Sure, the show may have gotten a little less awesome, but the show is still great. Family Guy just needs to stop. This is a Simpsons rip-off with a few more dirty jokes. Who cares? Anybody at any age can easily make up a joke like that and make anybody laugh. The Simpsons on the other hand has sticked to its roots since episode one and still does well; proving that a show doesn't have to be funny by swearing or using sex jokes. Family Guy is a pathetic show. A show that sucks beyond all belief. A show that in no way at all should be used in the same sentence as the phrase ""The Simpsons"" and ""Great"". Family Guy is a terrible show. A terrible show. The Simpsons is an amazing show. An amazing show.

The fact that the same guy does so many voices is also very brilliant.  But what differentiates this guy from other shows like The Simpsons, and Eddie Murphy, etc, is it is virtually impossible to tell the difference between his characters voices.

1825456,5,B000083C6V,"""Family Guy"" is like a breath of fresh air in the world of modern television.  It's quirky, idiosyncratic and, best of all, funny.  Television is all the richer for the experiences of the dysfunctional Griffin family from Quahog, Rhode Island.

It is inevitable that the Griffin family will be compared to the similarly dysfunctional Simpson family of Springfield.  Yet while there are similarities, the ""Family Guy"" product is simply edgier, more irreverent and better focussed to the adult viewer.

The characters of ""Family Guy"" are wonderful.  Brian the talking dog sounds simply stupid when explained to someone unfamiliar with the series.  But Brian is clever, witty and possessing of a very dry sense of humour.  His repartee with Stewie, the one year old evil genius is magic.  In fact, all the characters interact in a thoroughly manic but enjoyable way.

""Family Guy"" is American humour at its best.  For too long we have been subjected to such dross as ""Friends"" or ""Seinfeld"" as cutting edge.  Let me assure you that these programmes are pygmies when compared to the clever wit that is ""Family Guy"".

The same humour is used, but cleverly avoids falling into the trap of being the same joke repeated over and over again. As with any Family Guy show, the humour is a little risque, sometimes offensive, but always very funny. Many of the small bit-part characters (some of whom only make one appearance in the TV show,) are also given small bit parts in the film.

As with the TV show, there are often little random scenes to explain jokes, and in this film, they are more frequent, and much more random, but still work all the same.

Family Guy is a funny show. It is great in its own respects. The characters are wonderful. My favourites are Brian and Stewie. I like that dead-pan voice Seth McFarlane uses on Brian. He's an alcoholic dog who's in love with his best friend's wife. You don't get better than that!

I've been turning to Family Guy over the last few years. South Park used to be one of my most-watched, but now I feel all the heart has left that show.

1825463,5,B000083C6V,"Although The Family Guy is pretty much unknown in Holland, I've been introduced to this great show quite a while ago. After seeing quite a couple episodes of the previous seasons I came to Canada again and got the DVD from a friend. The movie was just HILARIOUS!!!!  The Griffins were funny as usual and I was entertained throughout the entire movie. Lots of jokes in this show relate to North American subjects and people (makes sense since it's an American show) but this does make it quite important to know a bit of the culture and the language of course. Having subtitles on the Dutch DVD would also help of course but most of the time that still doesn't translate everything with the same humour.

I read that the movie was quite similar to the last episodes of the third season but to be honest...I couldn't really care less cause I haven't seen those episodes!!!!!!!!! I guess that's the only good thing about the show not being on Dutch television....

But nothing bad about this movie and I would recommend it to everybody that has or hasn't seen it yet!!!",1149552000,,1066,4.570680628272251

Don't announce that you're going to tell a joke, just tell it. The tangential movie references are completely uninspired and forced.

The ""original"" components like the baby with the British accent and the dog who talks aren't funny.

What makes me give it three stars is that this was released (and sold to people) earlier this year as a movie - not as an early release of their season finale!  I actually saw the finale on TV before seeing the DVD and, while there are a few extra bits at the begining and end, it is essentially the same as what I saw for free on TV (albeit with comcercials - but isn't that what Tivo is for?).

This to me seems very lazy on the part of the Family Guy crew, and smacks of false advertising - nowhere on the DVD packaging does it say anything about this being broadcast on TV, and at no time during the TV broadcast was it mentioned that this was the censored version of the DVD.

1825474,5,B000083C6V,"Family Guy is a raucous irreverent animated comedy propelled back into production due to fans (like me) who appreciated its incredible daring satire of, well - everything and everyone!  This DVD is a no-holds-barred masterpiece of iconoclastic humor, not for the faint of heart.  The censors have had a field day with Family Guy episodes since its first broadcast, and that is a recommendation in its own right!  All our favorite characters have their moments - Brian the alcoholic intellectual dog, Stewie the evil mastermind infant, Meg the homely teen girl, Chris the overweight underachiever, Peter the buffoon who enjoys the guilty pleasures in life, Lois the former party girl from a wealthy family turned Mom, and Mayor Adam West (played by the 70's classic Batman, Adam West) as a paranoid Mayor of Quahaug RI.  In the very beginning, you see Lois tumble ass over teakettle on the red carpet from the limo to the ""opening night"" of this film, tanked from the champagne in the limo and wanting to do Peter then and there - and it sets the stage for the rest of the film, which is a bawdy fun tale of Stewie seeking the ""mysterious man"" whom he believes must be his biological father.  Stewie is inspired by the concept that Peter, a simpleton, could not have produced the DNA which created such a brilliant sinister genious, and decides to find the mysterious man he glimpsed who resonated with him so strongly.  The revelation of the mysterious man's identity drives the plot, as pop culture references, quips, and the never-ending insult duels between Brian and Stewie keep the laughs going.  We all know a Quagmire (clich? ladies' man ridiculous to all but himself and the conquests he ensnares with his lifelong experience of chasing tail), a Cleveland (sweet stable guy-next-door who is the calm in the storm and the voice of ethics and helping our fellow man), a Joe (while he is in a wheelchair, his personality as an overly macho jock is abundantly clear) and all our favorites.  We know people like these, and this is an unabashed portrayal of them that is only a slight exaggeration!  If you are easily offended, Family Guy isn't for you, but it should be.  If you can't laugh at your own beliefs, they are dogma not truth - truth is strong enough to handle the challenge of humor.  The pop culture references and laughs are sharp social commentary and the humor is edgy to say the least.  I agree with another reviewer - this was more like a few episodes put together, rather than feeling like a feature length film, but who cares when it is as good as this?  Enjoy a few good laughs, get this!",1146009600,,2612,4.676855895196507

1825489,3,B000083C6V,"When I first saw this one in the store I got ecstatic! A whole movie about the best character in Family Guy! But after watching it I somehow felt a bit cheated. The reason is simple; what do we love about Stewie? His ""evilness"", his british accent, and his use of big words. Well, how many of these are present in this movie? One! The british accent! The two others are close to gone! And you even get a sort of hint that something's wrong early on when Stewie (after an accident) says; ""from this day forward Stewart Gilligan Griffin will be a good boy"". We don't want to see Stewie be a good boy, we want to see him unveil his evil in all its glory!

Ok, that being said, the film still poses some really funny situations, usually with Peter. Also the writers have managed to keep - maybe even improve - the wierd and somewhat twisted humor that Family Guy is known for.

This all leads to a cross-country journey with bitter sidekick Brian to discover that his father is really a future version of himself (a particuarly pathetic version) that is in the present on vacation. The feature feels disjointed simply because it is ... it's actually 3 episodes melded into a feature. However, the commentary (audio) is fantastic and even more enjoyable than the film.

The characters are hilarious (this part's for those out there who have never seen Family Guy before [if you fall into that category, beware; you should be shot]); from Brian, the talking dog with an incessant craving for martinis, to Stewie, the verbose young'un bent on world domination and assassinating his meddling mother (who has only found his giant weapons stash once), and from Quagmire, the kid who has worse problems than me trying to pick up girls, to Peter, the fat-ass drunken father who provides many a laugh in the show, Family Guy and voice-actor Seth MacFarlane (who provides the voices for Peter, Chris, AND Brian, among others) really show us what life shouldn't be like -- and do it in good fashion, making us both wonder what'll happen next and laugh our asses off at every turn.

The character Stewie is a figure that can give you hours of belly laughs as well as ""sleeping with the lights on"" night terrors all in one package.

Instead, i would wait until it goes around $10. Then, it will be worth it.

It seemed to me that this movie had 2/3 funny parts, and 1/3 filler to make it longer. This movie could have been 60-75 minutes, still have been a feature film, and would have been a solid ""5-Star"", but unfortunately, it was not made like that.

This show is for people who love to have fun,  people that actually have humor in them, people who don't get offended easily, and those who don't mind parody. Some people may say it's wrong to make fun of celebrities, but that's stuff that all celebrities are prepared for when welcoming themselves to that world, so unless it's something very serious, you shouldn't feel sorry for them.

There was a joke about Mark Wahlberg or ""Marky Mark"" when he stared in the movie Boogie Nights on the episode ""If I'm Dyin', I'm Lyin'"" and I am a huge fan of Mark Wahlberg, but I was just like, ""Hey, they mentioned Mark!"" and I laughed. You just can't be uptight when watching this show, and even though the thought of a cartoon series rated 14+ (18 in some stores) with a talking baby bent on world domination and killing his mother, and a talking dog who loves martinis, an unpopular complaining daughter, a smart, beautiful wife and a stupid drinking father, might sound stupid to you, you got to open your mind to it, and when you do things will seem funnier.

I wouldn't reccomend this show to anyone under 14/13 because it can be very sexual and just have that humor that only older people would get, and when you don't get the joke it kinda ruins the show because it makes you think it sucks.

What kinda throws me off though is because Seth MacFarlane doesn't seem to write any of the shows, even in the Stewie Griffin movie he doesn't write any parts, so why would he have his name plastered everywhere? Sure, he's the one who created and draws them, and does alot of the voices (sounds like a self-operated business to me), he still doesn't write them, so I think they need to make the writers known a little bit more instead of just seeing his name everywhere.

I bought this DVD the day it hit the racks, and that night my sister and I watched it. I had pretty big laughs, but it was just never as great as I thought it would be.

Seth MacFarlane still keeps us laughing though in this DVD. I listened to the commentary also, and learned this is just three episodes thrown together. That didn't really throw me off, but I was expecting it to be an actual movie of Family Guy, I mean, they could have just took out some ""bad"" parts and made it a continuing three-part episode like they did those ones where Brian goes away.

If you would like the DVD to be uncensored then go to set up, or special features, either one (sorry my mind is going blank). But they didn't lie on the cover when they said uncensored because you CAN make it uncensored, some people would prefer the F words to be blocked out and I think that was nice of them.

So when I heard the movie was coming out, I was excited, figuring that it would go beyond everything the series ever achieved.

I was disappointed. Not only is this movie mild compared to the series today, but it's edited. You don't expect curse words to be edited in an unrated DVD. To add to that, it's not a true movie but actually a three part series connected only the by fact that they're about Stewie and his future. Before and after these three parts is a mostly pointless frame story. They didn't take advantage of the freedom of DVD releases. It was a disappointing effort. They should have taken the cue from the Southpark movie, and just have at it.

I can recommend this to people who are true fans of the series, and only then if you're willing to accept this as an extra episode of Family Guy and not an actual movie.

The DVD is basically an extended ""Family Guy"" episode, but the DVD extras make it worth the price of admission. The best ""Extra"" is the step by step look at how each episode is painstakingly created by the writers and animators.

1825522,4,B000083C6V,"I've been a big Family Guy fan for a while, so a movie version, even on DVD and basically three strung-together episodes, is a dream come true. It has everything you love about FG: random references to media from the past & present, lowbrow humor that makes the Simpsons look tame (which it sort of is), and creator Seth MacFarlane doing half the voices.

 The story, folks, is simply this: Stewie is crushed under a lifeguard tower and nearly dies. He discovers life is precious and turns ""nice"" for a while, until he sees a man on TV in San Francisco that looks just like him. Thinking it could be his real father, he and Brian head out in Quagmire's Winnebago, tackling obstacles until he reaches the man and discovers it's really a future version of Stewie, a pathetic virgin who works at a Circuit City-like place and lives by himself. After helping Stu, as he goes by now, get his life together (sort of) and seeing a future version of the family (Peter and Lois are just older versions of themselves, Chris is a henpecked cop, and Meg is a man named Ron), Stewie races back to prevent his near-death experience so he won't grow up to be a mess.

 Thrown in here are jabs at Ray Charles, Casper the Friendly Ghost, Johnny Quest, Lethal Weapon, Indiana Jones (Temple of Doom AND The Last Crusade!), Ferris Bueller's Day Off, The Shield, and more. It's no worse than the show in terms of content (Officer Scrotes, maybe, but that's awesome), unless you listen to the uncensored track with full-on F-bombs that are usually bleeped (most provided by Chris's wife).

Not since the Simpons has a show, a cartoon nonetheless, captured the hearts of Americans everywhere ... then thrown it in their faces.

This DVD features some of Seth MacFarlane's greatest work on the show, including takes that were too, ahem, outrageous, for FOX. All the characters are there, including the tough and manly Peter, his comical wife Louise, their two sons, an alcoholic, talking dog (shall I repeat that?), and a baby, with an English accent, who wants to take over the world.

1825528,5,B000083C6V,"First of all, you can NOT say that Family Guy isn't original. Yes, it resembles the Simpsons because it is a cartoon, but there's a lot more to being animated that lets Family Guy have its own type of humor much different than that of the Simpsons.

The writing is completely different from the Simpsons. Being a fan of both shows and having watched more than 90% of the Simpsons and 100% of Family Guy, you can clearly differentiate between the styles of writing and the jokes that are thrown at the audience.

Simpsons has their own way of approaching humor wheras Family Guy is almost all slapstick. Simpsons has in depth writing that make you dissect a joke to actually get it (sometimes having more than one or two meanings) whereas in Family Guy, it just happens on screen for you to watch and laugh.

You can't say that the plotlines are the same when they are completely divergent. Yes, I'm sure you can make many connections about the two, but you can also make many connections to any other show about a family on television. Married with Children resembles both shows. They're both shows about families that make you laugh. Oh, they're also all FOX shows.

You have to give Family Guy the credit that it rightfully deserves. For a show that came on, captured audiences (while constantly being moved around during the week), getting taken off the air AND coming back on because of their unbelievable DVD sales does in fact mean something.

It means that it's grabbed and audience that watches it for a reason; because it's just funny. from Peter's stupidity and laughter at poty humor, to Quagmire's unrepressed sexual urges, to Joe's serious moral and violent tendencies, to Mayor Adam West's shouting matches, this show is downright hilarious.

If you want to laugh when you were a kid (you know that squirting milk out your nose, pee your pants, laugh till you can't breathe and passout from lack of oxygen... almost) well this is the show for you. I'm a fan of both simpsons and family guy and they both have a place in my heart, but all in all, I think Family Guy's risque approach to humor will win over more fans from the Simpsons and from South Park if you actually sit down, have an open mind and enjoy slapstick humor. It's a mix between The 3 stooges, Simpsons, South Park, Married with Children. It has numerous flashbacks to the 60's 70's 80's (whenever) and talks about anything from music, to race relations, to world domination. Give it a shot. Oh, Gumble 2 Gumble was awesome. Mmmhmmm mhhhmmmm mmmhmmmm mmmhmmm mmmmhmmm mmmmmh mhmmm mmmhmmmm mmmhmmm mmmmhmmm mmmmmh mhmmm mmmhmmmm mmmhmmm mmmmhmmm mmmmmh mhmmm mmmhmmmm mmmhmmm mmmmhmmm mmmmmh mhmmm mmmhmmmm mmmhmmm mmmmhmmm mmmmmh mhmmm mmmhmmmm mmmhmmm mmmmhmmm mmmmmh mhmmm",1135036800,,2754,4.775210084033613

1825530,5,B000083C6V,"Family Guy is one of the greatest shows on television. It's random, funny and original (but somehow makes no sense to BHogg). It's funny in two ways. 1.)It's random and comes out of nowhere and 2.)Alot of it actually comes from somewhere. Take that chicken fight for instance. Every place they end up fighting is taken from somewhere. I honestly can't remember everything 'cause I haven't seen everything that they were refferencing, but the ending scene where they're fighting near the propelled airplane was from Indiana Jones. Another episode, in the scene where they invited the actress who played Lois Lane in Super Man II to dinner, the actress flips out when they mention that movie and goes into a tantrum and flips out the window. They were referrencing to the fact that she actually did go crazy during the making of that film. As for the crude and offensive language, they did this specifically for dvd.

Now, why does anyone compare this to the simpsons? Peter is irresponsible and fat just like homer, but he is by no stretch of the imagination lazy like Homer and can also run without running out of breath. Homer's out of shape but Peter isn't. Meg is smart but unpopular? Since when did they ever hint her being smart? Also Meg strives to be popular her so called counterpart Lisa does not. A talkin dog, Brian who went to Brown, how does that at all compare to Santa's little helper or Snowball? The intelligent einstein, Stewie, whom always tries to make Lois' life miserable is not at all like Maggie whom loves her family and is not close to developing her motor skills. Then there's Chris, a complete moron who is unpopular and a good boy who tries hard to do what's right. This is like Bart? Um, no! Lois is 40 yetstunning and every man who meets her, wants her. She's sensible but is not at all afraid to take risks and get her hands dirty. How exactly is she like Marge?

The point is is that it's funny but even funnier when you know what they're refferencing to.",1134518400,,1988,4.565826330532213
1825531,5,B000083C6V,"Everything I expected Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story to be, it wasn't. I figured there'd be a lot of cussing due to the box screaming 'Uncensored', but no. I expected it to be funny every single second, but no. But what it all boils down to is whether you came in a Family Guy fan or not. If you'd never seen it then yes, you'll most likely love it. But if you're already a big fan then you'll probably see this as simply mediocre. I however, came in being a huge fan and came out liking Family Guy even more. I think if you go into watching this with no expectations you'll be pleasantly surprised. Afterall, The Untold Story merely plays as a three part episode. The first part revolves around Stewie's trials and tribulations with swimming and a near-death experience. The second follows Peter when he gets his own segment on the local news called 'What Grinds My Gears.' And the third part follows Stewie as he tries to find his long-lost father, with an added twist. But don't think that it stops with those ideas, no, we get to see Meg as a guy named Ron, Chris as a cop, Peter in all his idiotic glory, Lois as a drunken sex kitten, Stewie get drunk, and Brian, well, be himself. This movie should be everything a Family Guy fan would love. The jokes are more raunchy and you get to hear your favorite characters cussing, what more can you ask for?

I for one loved every second Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story had to offer. I thought every joke was right on with what would've been in a regular episode and even at times surpassed what would've been. It was even refreshing to see the characters you know from the show make fun of the movie once it ended. So basically, if you can laugh at dumb comedy and aren't easily offended, you will most likely cherish this movie.",1134172800,6,1781,4.380664652567976
1825532,4,B000083C6V,"Every semester in my Introduction to Popular Culture class the students make nominations and vote on what they think are the best shows on television today.  This semester the vote for the top spot is a battle between ""Lost"" and ""Family Guy,"" which is, of course pretty freakin' sweet.  The same can be said for ""Family Guy Presents Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story,"" which is a theatrical film version of the television series to the extent that three yet to be aired episodes linked together by a continuing story and bookended by an uncensored prologue and epilogue can be said to constitute such a thing.  Ironically, the biggest complaint is that the freedom of being a ""movie"" rather than a ""television show"" does not translate into the same sort of freedom that we say with ""South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut.""  I wanted to say that this is because eventually ""Family Guy"" would be able to run the three parts of this one as episodes on television whereas that was never going to happen with the ""South Park"" movie, except that Comedy Central shows it uncensored all the time now.

The prologue has the ""Family Guy"" gang showing up for the premier of this film as they return to television after the hiatus forced upon them (Lois had the worst time of it, far and away, which explains why she shows up totally sloshed).  The continuing thread here is Stewie's search for his real father, an idea that begins by simply looking at Peter and trying to figure out a genetic connection, but which goes into high gear when Stewie sees a man on television who looks and talks exactly like what we would expect if Stewie was all grown up.  But before Stewie and Brian go on their cross-country journey, the littlest Griffin has a near-death experience that motivates him to try and change his evil ways.  Of course the main narrative thread is just an excuse to toss in as many jokes as possible, and there is certainly something to be said for not really being concerned with coming up with logical segues to throw references to Sacco & Vanzetti, ""Star Trek V,"" and Ziggy Stardust.  If I were going to point to a sequence that is emblematic of this movie I would pick Peter's ""What Grinds My Gears"" segment on television in which he attacks Lindsay Lohen (""What do you want, Lindsay? Tell me what you want?"").  I totally appreciate the sentiment, but if this is an ""uncensored"" movie then I expect there to be a lot more blood on the floor from start to finish (and more cartoon nudity).  So I was certainly entertained, but I really was expecting this to be really special and not just a collection of above average (future) television episodes.

I can make an argument that the three funniest shows on television today are ""Family Guy,"" ""South Park"" and ""The Simpsons"" (who would have ever thought that ""The Simpsons"" would be considered a ""conservative"" cartoon show?).  What they have in common is what is being called ""flexible reality,"" which is simply the ability to go anywhere and do anything.  Obviously an animated series has an advantage over more realistic television in that regard.  Of those three series I think ""Family Guy"" clearly makes the best use of the practice, not only in terms of Peter's constant channeling of unseen lives, but also in the basic roster of characters.  Having either Stewie or Brian around is pretty good; having both, and constantly teaming them up as happens in this film, is pure genius, evil or otherwise.  Plus, the vocal talents of Seth MacFarlane, who does Stewie, Peter and Brian in the Griffin household plus Glen Quagmire and Tom Tucker, is as good as it gets for making diverse sounds out of one man's voice.  It also does not hurt that Lois Griffin (voiced by Alex Borstein), is the sexiest cartoon mom of all time, which is another reason to bemoan the fact that ""uncensored"" in this film did not mean everything we were hoping it might mean...",1134172800,5,3904,4.6744525547445255

Everyone's favorite evil baby genius, Stewie Griffin, takes off with Brian, America's greatest Brown University-educated, alcoholic, talking dog to San Francisco after Stewie sees a man on television who looks just like him. Stewie assumes this man must be his real father.

The story initially looked like it was going to be another ""road to"" send-up with Stewie and Brian, but for the most part, Stewie goes it alone.

Stewie finds the man, but discovers he's not Stewie's father, but another, even stranger, relation. (No spoiler here.)

For the most part, the humor is on par for the usual Family Guy stuff, but many angles really seem to drag on after awhile and go nowhere. The only runway red carpet party ultimately made no sense at all. Drew Barrymore was involved, and that explains much of it.",1134000000,4,977,4.695906432748538

When I heard about the movie I couldn't wait to watch it. However, I was very disappointed. Perhaps as a FG fan I had expected the movie to be at par or better than the TV shows. It isn't. The animation is slightly different and the plot is weak and fragmented. I had the impression that the charecters were trying to hard to be funny, which I have never felt in an episode.

1825540,1,B000083C6V,"Ok, not gonna lie, Family Guy is one of the worst shows on television.  Why?  Well, to start things off, its unoriginal.  Let's think of the concept: a dumb, drunk, and irresponsible father, an insightful wife, a dumb son, a smart but unpopular daughter, a dog, and a baby, and a bunch of wild neighbors.  Doesn't sound anything like the Simpsons, now does it?

Also, it's not funny.  I recently watched an episode cause my friend made me, and half the episode was taken up by Peter randomly fighting a chicken.  Why?  Because it's funny?  No, because it takes up half the episode, and the writers are not clever enough to fill up a 30 min. time slot w/ commercials with jokes that are relevant.  Which brings me to my next point: have you noticed how none of the jokes have anything to do with the plot?  Thats because they're stolen!

Another thing is that the show is so intent on being offensive that it loses any humor it does have.  I'm not someone who is offended easily; the only thing that does is when something is vulgar for the sake of being vulgar, and Family Guy is indeed.  By the way, American Beauty is my favorite movie.

1825554,5,B000083C6V,"""You know what really grinds my gears?"" When those words come out of Peter Griffin's mouth, you know you're gonna laugh. This Family Guy movie is funny, downright funny. Family Guy is a breath of fresh air compared to the very very stale Simpsons.

OK, so the plot of the movie is that Stewie has a near death experience (while trying to kill another child) and briefly goes to hell, there he thinks he'll spend an eternity being molested by Steve Allan. Instead he's really doomed to a TV that plays nothing but ""Who's the Boss"". Stewie is so terrified, that he decides to be a 'good' boy. Yeah right, guess how long that lasts.

Stewie then travels to San Francisco to find who he thinks is his real father. He ends up meeting himself who has visited from the future. Stewie is disappointed that he turned out to be a one testicled, 35 year old virgin in a dead end job. So he decides to warn himself in the past not to blow up the life guard tower because that's where his life went awry. So future Stewie warns present Stewie who in a very Stewie fashion disintegrates his future self with a ray gun.

But the comedy of the Family Guy is not the story itself, it's all the inserts. You know they usually start off with ""Boy, this was worse than the time I...."" and then you get something so outrageous that you're balling over with laughter. This movie has those inserts everywhere. We see Jesus as a mere street magician doing simple finger tricks, Walt Disney freezing himself again when he discovers 'Jews are still here', and Peter playing ball with his pet T-Rex.

Of course my favorite part is the very beginning. To see Lois drunk and puking on the sidewalk is sexy enough, but when she gets on all fours and tells Peter to ride her, I can't take it anymore. Lois Griffin is by far the hottest cartoon mom of all time, she is second only to Leela of Futurama in my fantasies.",1131926400,2,1886,4.38
1825555,5,B000083C6V,"Family Guy, a great television series, why not make it a movie? This movie defenitly earned 5 stars, and I'll tell you why. There were some character returns, of ones we haven't seen for awhile now, like greased up deaf guy, the evil monkey (who we see only potrays an evil monkey on the show), and of course the kool-aid guy. I was cracking up with Trisha Tawkanua's line at the permire: ""The dierect to DVD movie that will soon be found in the $3.99 bin at your local car wash."" Hilarious! But my friends and I were seriously laughing at the point with ""wacky inflatable flying inter tube man"" or something like that, and the part with jesus going like ""na na da na da na da da na"" with all those lame tricks. Too funny! It gets 5 stars.

P.S.: The part with Lois when she was drunk arriving to the party, I was in stitches. Pricless! ""When I heard....when I heard...we were gonna be in a movie, I was like %&^%&^ YAEAH!!!"" Gold. Real, pure gold.",1131840000,4,948,4.29608938547486
1825556,4,B000083C6V,"Nobody's going to like this one bit, but I have to admit it. I'm one of those evil people who carps and moans about how Family Guy is nowhere near as good as it was before it went off the air. Sorry. It's decline reminds me somewhat of the Simpsons' decline but much faster.

I loved the old Family Guy episodes. Episodes like ""And The Weiner Is...,"" ""Love Thy Trophy,"" ""Thin White Line/Brian Does Hollywood,"" ""I Am Peter Hear Me Roar,"" and ""Peter Peter, Caviar Eater,"" among a ton of others, are among the funniest things I have seen on TV. So when I started watching it after it came back from cancellation, I was amazed at how the quality had sloughed off. When watching episodes like ""Blind Ambition,"" ""Breaking Out Is Hard To Do,"" ""Don't Make Me Over,"" and especially the painfully unfunny ""8 Simple Rules For Buying My Teenage Daughter,"" it's almost difficult to believe you're watching the same show.

However, this movie is a respite from that disappointment. It's probably closer in quality to the old episodes than the new ones. As Martha Stewart says, ""That's a good thing.""

So rejoice! This is something of a return to the good 'ol Family Guy in my opinion. Not the best of the best, but I'd rank it on the same level as older episodes like ""He's Too Sexy For His Fat"" and ""I Never Met The Dead Man.""

The movie starts out with everyone in Quahog attending the premiere of the Family Guy movie. For anyone who says Family Guy can't be hilarious anymore, look at the joke about Stewie's ""failed political career."" Just as a visual gag alone it's hilarious. The joke with Lois and Peter ""get on!"" is more of the crassness they've been using lately that I usually don't like, but I actually found this funny. One guy I do with seeing a little less of is The Greased Up Deaf Guy. Losing his funny. However, the Evil Monkey gag (posing for the cameras) was great. So far, so good. Then we get into the actual movie.

At the local community pool Stewie has a very funny near-death experience (Tom Allen channel-surfing - 'nuff said) that causes him to re-evaulate his behavior and become annoyingly nice. In the meantime, Peter gets angry because the local video chain has been taken over by Lackluster Video and has removed all the porn movies from the back room (which in itself is funny satire, I think; everywhere in the U.S. I've lived the local video chains have pornographic back rooms, but of course Blockbuster does not) and Tom Tucker hears him ranting about it, so he gives him a spot on the news where he can tell the public what ""grinds his gears.""

From here of course, hilarity ensues and Stewie sets off on a cross-country trip when he sees a man who looks exactly like him (his real father?) being interviewed in San Francisco.

Without giving away any more plot details, I have to say, to me, the beginning of the movie all the way until Stewie meets the man who looks like him is pretty good. The trip to San Francisco is quite amusing. And there's a very funny B story in which Peter and Lois teach Meg and Chris about dating and love (the funniest moment comes when Lois teaches Chris about dining out at a fine restaurant. You'll see, oh, you'll see). But the plot and the jokes when Stewie ""goes on his journey"" with the man kind of falls flat for me. The, ahem ""place where they go"" (trying not to spoil anything here) is not anywhere near as comedically fleshed out or full of the depth you'd hope. The twist with Meg really seems like pointless pandering for the legions of Meg haters. In short, when Stewie and the ""man who looks like him"" go to the ""other place"" I think the movie stalls badly. Brian's conversation with a few famous figures at this point is the high point.

When Stewie returns the movie picks up again, and has it's most hilarious moment easily, the Ferris Bueller parody. Having been a child in the 80s, that really resonates with me. That's the funniest thing I've seen from Family Guy since they went off the air, hands down. Interestingly enough, in the commentary they note it was written for the episode ""Peter Griffin, Husband, Father, Brother?""

After the movie, there's the after-premiere party, which isn't as funny as the beginning. It feels like they're trying to stretch the movie out to fit the minimum time for a movie.

So, overall, I enjoyed the movie. Like with other Family Guy DVDs, the extras are nothing to write home about, at all. The commentary is fine, and I like the chaotic feel as commentators arrive and leave during the recording, and you get several interesting insights about the process of making the movie and what was going on when Family Guy was on hiatus, but it's a fairly standard Family Guy commentary.

Overall, unless you're a die-hard Family Guy fan, I would recommend this for a video rental. After you've watched the movie, twice, with and without the commentary, and perused the few extras, in my opinion, you've gotten everything there is to be gotten out of this DVD - which is a good, enjoyable experience. But, unless you're a FG fanatic, I don't think this movie lends itself well to repeated viewing like the old Family Guy episodes you can watch 10 times or more.",1131840000,2,5171,4.543501611170784

This 'Untold Story' did not have me laughing.  Maybe one or two snickers - but that is it.  'Lame' would be the word I would use to describe the 'movie'.

1825563,3,B000083C6V,"Let me start off by saying that I was and still am a fan of this show. For all of the naysayers who have all of the same criticisms, your not all wrong. I can see where the show is weak when it tries too hard with the pop culture *wink wink, nudge nudge* thing. It does misfire a lot, but there are just as many jokes and gags that hit that even everything out. That being said, a little Family Guy goes a long way. It's well suited for a half hour show every week, but sitting through an hour and a half movie got to be a bit much when the film trolled out pop culture references and scenes one after the other. It was too jam packed and it always takes away from the proceedings. But there is still enough here to make this a decent viewing experience. It is definitley not what it could of been, and was somewhat disappointing. I think any normal half hour episode is better and funnier than this movie. The story goes that Fox asked Seth McFarlane and company to create some episodes(when they were picked back up on the network)that would lend itself to some kind of ongoing story arc so that they could put it together and release it as a film. And look how quick it turned out!. ""The Simpsons"" movie has been in the stages for over a decade!. Anywho, the plot is pretty simple. Evil baby Stewie is still on the 'world domination' thing and continues going about his plans. One day, Stewie has a near death experience and his outlook changes. He then sees an older adult on TV that looks and sounds exactly like him. It must be his real dad!. He sets out to San Francisco with Brian in tow to find the man he thinks is his real father. For those of you who have not yet seen it, I won't spoil the outcome of Stewie and Brian's great adventure. There is no denying Seth McFarlane's talent, although I found it quite weird that he did not write any of the three individual episodes that makes up this movie or directed any of it. But he is extremely talented in the vocal department. He has a great voice. But the quick cuts to something pop culture-y really take too much out of the film. The movie is never as funny as a normal episode either. There were some laughs here and there, and some were quite big too, but not as many as you would of thought. The uncensored version of the film is something. You will be able to find it in the language section of the menu. Hearing your favorite characters cursing and saying the ""F"" word is something to hear indefinitley. Other than that, the special features here were pathetically weak. But the movie felt quite choppy, and things weren't always coherent and consistent with the main narrative. It veered here and there, and never stayed on the same path. It would of been nice to see more of Cleveland and Joe, and Quagmire's part was pretty amusing. In the end, this was a valiant try, and die hard fans will probably treasure it, but I thought it could of been so, so much better.",1130976000,3,2936,4.282374100719425

That said, ""Stewie Griffin- The Untold Story"" is one of the least funny attempts at comedy I've ever seen. It makes ""American Dad"" seem funny.  I don't know what happened. My guess is a contractual obligation forced MacFarlane into banging out a script over a weekend. I'd bet a good fifty percent of the material was pulled from the bag of jokes that didn't make it into previous episodes. And the storyline about Stewie and his dad/older self/brother was entirely horrendous. Sloppy, boring, and amateur.

1825569,4,B000083C6V,"While I did watch Family Guy occasionally when it was first on TV, I was never a fan until after it got cancelled.  In the interim period between the third and fourth (uncancelled) seasons, I discovered Seth MacFarlane's hilarious work.  It really pushed the envelope in terms of what the censors would allow as well as coming up with some of the most out-there plots imaginable (one of my favorites involves Peter seceeding from the Union).  When FOX decided to bring the show back, due to enormous DVD sales, I along with fans everywhere rejoiced at the news.

However, when the first new episode aired, I was somewhat underwhelmed, and as the new season progressed, I found myself losing interest in the show.  So when the movie came out, I found that, while I did genuinely want to see it, I never rushed out to get it.  Finally, one of my neighbors held a small screening of it, and I found my faith in Family Guy renewed.

One of my biggest problems with the new episodes is that they take jokes and concepts that worked in the original run and use them ad nauseum.  There are cutaways every minute now and jokes are drawn out for minutes at a time.  In the movie, there aren't any jokes that go on for too long (don't get me wrong, I do love it when they draw something out, but lately, they've gone on for too long), and while there are a lot of cutaways, they are all very funny (though there is one with Ray Charles that is a little distasteful, but then again, what isn't in good taste on this show?).

Basically, the movie is three episodes that was going to be a three-parter in the series, but I guess that when FOX asked for a movie, they decided to slightly redo them and make them into a movie.  Also, they are bracketed by the characters attending a premiere of the movie.  The story begins with Stewie having a near-death experience in a swimming pool, and, thinking he ended up in Hell, decides to change his ways and be good.  When that doesn't work out, he wishes that he could find someone else out there who is like him.  All of the sudden, this guy appears in San Francisco who looks exactly like Stewie.  After being interviewed on television, Stewie and Brian set out to find the man Stewie believes to be his true father (after all, how could the dim-witted Peter share the same genes with maniacal Stewie?).  Of course, wackiness ensues as the pair hitch a ride with Quagmire and his (and I can't spell this the way it is in the movie) Cross-Country Tour.  However, when Stewie finally meets up with the man he is seeking, he is amazed to learn his true identity.

While there are a few things about the movie I didn't like, overall it is great.  All of our favorite characters are here, but MacFarlane also introduces a few new people, including the Waving Arms Inflatible Tube Man in one of the funniest scenes of the movie.  This movie is sure to please Family Guy fans everywhere.  If you have never seen the show before, I reccomend this, but I want to issue a warning as well; the humor is extremely raunchy, so be expected to be caught off guard by a few things.  If you can get past that, be prepared to laugh long and hard.",1130544000,3,3161,4.385934819897084

1825574,4,B000083C6V,"I admit that as a fanatic of Family Guy that this review may have a biased angle to it. I came to this movie expecting a lot and yet I was skeptical as to how the show would fit in the movie format. Although it is in fact an hour and a half, it feels more like watching three episodes in a row (in fact the film is written in three parts).

One thing that I was really impressed by is the quanity of profanity in the movie. Although they had the oppurtunity for lots of cursing, it was not overdone, and the choice moments were usually well placed. This was one thing I was worried about because this could of turned the movie into a nightmare.

Although this movie had its fair share of funny moments. Some of the gags seemed forced. It would be hard not to feel forced when there is 3 jokes every 30 seconds, such as it is in this movie, but when the jokes are on, you will be rolling on the floor.

All in all I was impressed by the first Family Guy outing into the film world, but then again, I wouldnt expect any less.",1129852800,3,1023,4.029556650246305

And so what if it is a cartoon:  the episode in which Stewie DOES search for his father left us with more questions than answers!  Now THAT'S a comment/observation from a total Family Guy fanatic who is probably reading waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too much into this otherwise FAB creation.

What's even worse is that Seth MacFarlane sunk even lower with his American Dad show which is even more redundant than The Family Guy.  Even worse is this movie is even less funny than most actual Family Guy episodes.  Spend your money elsewhere.  Go get Skinny Puppy's new Greater Wrong of the Right live DVD.

Stewie's acid tongue has been nuetralized and Brian's wit and charm have evaporated.  Much of the movie is focused on the Brian-Stewie relationship and the two even take a road trip together, but nothing here compares to the TV episode where Brian and Stewie find Brian's mother.

It appeared as if it was a different show with The Family Guy characters.  It seemed as if it was written and thrown together over a weekend.  I honestly think I laughed once.....maybe.  I can't even remember at this point.

1825587,5,B000083C6V,"Obviously by now if you haven't heard about Family Guy you have been living in a cave. And like it or not, the briefly underground cult hit has risen from its ashes like the mighty phoenix to find its popularity surging.

Like most modern animated shows of its type (The Simpsons, Futurama, etc...), you either love it, hate it, or are a devoted fan of a select few seasons. I would very easily fall into the first category (chalk that up to living in New England, or growing up wathcing most of the shows FG references) ever since watching the first episode way back in 1999 after the Super Bowl.

The show relies more on a string of very random jokes and obscure refrences than it does profound, moving, or even compelling stories. But, then again if you really are looking for politically correct, high-brow comedy with complex characters or intellectual stories and situations you can relate to why would you look to an animated show with a talking dog or a 1-year-old who is trying to take over the world. When I sit down to watch Family Guy, I know what I am going to experience; a lot of random flashbacks and randomly cutting to things not even remotely related to the show and over-the-top wacky characters and their wacky adventures. And if you didn't catch my emphasis there, the show is WACKY and RANDOM.

(The family visiting Peter in the hospital after experiencing a horrible trauma caused by his own vanity and selfishness):

Lois - Well Peter, I guess you learned a pretty valuable lesson

Peter - Nope!

If you want something to throw in the DVD player and not expend too much mental energy, if you just want to sit back and laugh until your sides hurt, buy this. Most people I know (and by the looks of most of the reviews here, others that have purchased this) have not regretted the investment in Family Guy on DVD.",1129334400,3,1836,4.531722054380665
1825588,3,B000083C6V,"The premise of the movie is that Stewie goes in search of who he believes is his true father, a man he sees on TV, but in fact is actually himself, from the future. He follows his future self to see how his life turns out and it is a very pathetic life, no world domination, he's a virgin at 35 and works in an appliance store, all due to one near death experience that scared him so much he decided to become mild-mannered.

I am a huge Family Guy fan since I saw the very first episode. The humor is usually non-stop, some might consider it offensive at first but that's really its charm, as it is offensive to everyone and every stereotype. I was so excited at the thought of a totally Stewie video (as he is my favorite) but I must say it was quite a letdown. Yes there were a lot of jokes, but honestly in the first 5 minutes I didn't laugh at all- which I've never had happen before while watching Family Guy.

It just seems like there was so much more they could do with this movie.  There are a few good jokes but most likely you've already seen them on the previews, who didn't love the sex scene- Stewie saying ""That's never happened to me before"" girl saying ""What the 8 seconds of sex or the 40 minutes of crying?"" And PLEASE, just come out and say it, Stewie is gay! We get it, so stop beating around the bush already. At any rate, while that was indeed funny the rest was just not that great.

You spend more time watching Stewie run from scene to scene instead of hearing jokes. If I didn't know any better I'd say they just made a normal episode of Family Guy and stretched it out into a movie by adding a bunch of scenes where Stewie runs or drives.

It is still Family Guy so you'll have a few laughs but I'm sorry to say: rent don't buy.",1129334400,,1756,4.107871720116618
1825589,3,B000083C6V,"I have found, in general, that the reincarnation of Family Guy this year is somewhat less funny than the pre-cancellation shows from a few years ago.  While the new shows certainly have some unbelievably funny moments (Peter in a ""Dueling Banjos"" farting contest with Michael Moore comes to mind), I feel that they lack much of the subtlety and smartness of the earlier episodes.  And I also have found that the violence portrayed against women is significantly higher in these new shows, often uncomfortably so.

This direct-to-DVD release continues that pattern.  The first time through, I wasn't too impressed.  The second time through was a little better.  But none of the newer material comes close to the brilliance of ""When You Wish Upon a Weinstein,"" or ""To Love and Die in Dixie"" (the owl knocking over the outhouse with Peter inside is the single funniest Family Guy moment, in my estimation).

While I was waiting for the movie to hit stores, I did a little bit of research on the movie. Turns out, this dvd is uncensored! Then I found out that its about another one of stewies adventures. It starts out on the red carpet during the premiere of the movie. Then it ends up with Stewie having a near death experience at the pool. So, he decides to be a good boy (like that could ever happen) After getting drunk and relizing that he still needs to ""find himself,"" he sees a man on the television who looks just like him. Convinced that Peter cant be his real father, he and Brain set out on their greatest 3 episode adventure yet. I won't ruin the plot twist, but i can say it was definitely worth the money.

For all of those who couldn't figure out why the movie was censored when you first played it, you have to go into the language selection, and switch it from censored to uncensored. I bought the dvd at walmart and it was uncensored, so don't think that its censored if you buy it there.

My overall favorite part, well, actually parts, of this movie was as follows: when stewie broke the neck of the Entertainment Weekly editor, when Elmer Fudd finnaly got Bugs Bunny, when Stewie dropped an f-bomb on that chick Vanessa, and my all time favorite part (for some reason) when Peter buys that catapult and flies through the air laughing. I watched that part like 8 times before i went on with the movie.

--Peter and Lois's dating tips

--""What really grinds my gears.""

1825600,4,B000083C6V,"A Family Guy uncensored is just like an Alien or Predator movie with gore: they just have to go together. Since Family Guy is so edgy and controversial anyways, an unrated movie would really tear the roof off by its fingertips. Only for some reason, the film(not really, it's more like 3 episodes bunched together) is funny at times but not on a massive consistent level. In other words, there's certain jokes in the show that I literally had to pause the DVD cause I was laughing so hard. Here? Just a good little laugh.

The episode starts out average enough with Stewie going swimming only encountering a rival. Wanting to get even, his plan instead backfires causing him to go to hell with a disturbing encounter with Steve Allen. Back on Earth, he vows to be more nicer which doesn't last long until he sees someone on TV which looks remarkably similar to himself so it's another Brian and Stewie road trip to find his father, or is it?

Many of the jokes fall incredibly flat or you just get a good chuckle or 2. The biggest one for me was actually this spoof on overzealous salesmen on TV with a really long product name. Very well done. Others don't fare so well such as Elmer finally getting Bugs in the most un-Warner Bros. way possible.

Extras are a bit disappointing. You get an animatic comparison and a full length commentary with writers and actors. I would've liked to see something similar to one of the season sets featurettes where the actors detail inspiration for voices and characters.

For Family Guy fans this is a must-have although I think Fox is planning to air these episodes in typical weekly fashion but at least we get it uncensored. Speaking of uncensored, parents with Family Guy fans for kids will be relieved that there's a censored version and a uncensored version in the Set Up menu.",1128643200,,1821,4.593846153846154

Think back years ago to the South park movie and you'll understand my meaning because what could have been a completely disarming, hilarious and downright memorable experience, one where you question yourself for what you've just watched and laughed at, this particular product only makes par due to the fact then aside from the profanity (check under the language section it IS THERE) nothing all that different is brought to the table.  Yeah theres swearing, but couldn't we have gone to late night FX for that?  Wheres the epic feel that we should be getting from a product like this?

There are a few solid laughs to be found don't get me wrong.  One in particular at the begining with Stewie cracking the neck of the Entertainment Weekly reporter, who much like EW staff kisses the ass of Futurama and the Simpsons but dismissed Family Guy.  Anotehr good joke with Indiana Jones appears later on regarding Kate Capshaw in Temple of Doom movie.  Thundercats and Deep Space Nine get pluses since talent from those shows got used for the jokes, and the fact that it was Deep Space Nine and not Original or Next Generation Trek, something you don't see often.  What could have punched up the show more were some more memorable ""Remember the time I..."" jokes and non sequitors.  Even something as lame as Peter finding Judd Hirsh in an epsiode in the tepid fourth season I can remember but much here just ran flat.

I'm a little torn on what to really say about this show.  It did have moments but it was a squandered oppertunity to really show off what they could have done with the show away from the censors of network television.  I mean just imagine how much farther they could have gone with this project.  I tell you what, get a hold of the South Park movie, and then try watching some of the TV episodes.

A bootlegged copy of the movie is shown during the local newscast...  Stewie's Untold Story!  In it, Stewie and family go through the usual set of adventures, including some incidents at a pool while learning to swim, and then suddenly Stewie sees a man with the likeness of himself on television...  and now he's preoccupied with the thought that Peter is way too stupid to be his father, and he must find this man who is obviously his real father.

Since it isn't a televised show but a straight-to-DVD movie, this thing should have been done a little differently methinks.  The creators now had an opportunity to go in and make the gags and stuff go way beyond the reserve they needed for the television censors.  Thus I was disappointed to see mostly that really nothing changed except maybe a few more curse-words.  Later I learned that it IS, in fact, intended for television.

The idea is that they went and released this DVD before the televised special, which is how it should be seen.  This doesn't make sense to me, so it's either stupid or brilliant, marketing-wise.  All I know is that I have no reason to watch it when it comes on television... I already own it.

Still, it had some very neat laughs and the usual allusions to other works--my favorite part--plus we get to see the Scary Monkey outside of the house for once.  As I said above, if you're a fan of Family Guy...

1825604,5,B000083C6V,"Stewie Griffen ( everyone's favorite demented intelligent infant) who always wants to do world domination as he notices a man who looks much him if he was older as it gives him a idea that it could be his real father and not the man that loathes so much known as Peter. He sets out on a quest to San Francisco with the help of Brian and Quagmire while Peter and Lois are helping their son and daughter try to date other people, but soon Stewie discovers something shocking about the man that looks like him.

Everyone's family toon favorite (besides The Simpsons or Flintstones) in their first direct-to-DVD animated feature that actually works quite well. There are plenty of nasty jokes and references to other movies and shows like ""Star Wars"", a hilarious ""Thundercats"" bit with the actual voice artists who did Cheetara and Lion-O, Michael Clarke Duncan doing a cameo voice with Drew Barrymore and Phil LaMarr ( who did Omar in the American version of ""Rock and Rule"") and there's plenty of suprises just waiting for the family guy fan out there.

The DVD includes both a censored and Uncensored language track but take my advice as to watch it with the uncensored language track and there's of course a couple of extras such as a audio commentary and animatric's storyboard stuff.

Highest recommendation for the family guy fan!",1128470400,3,1334,4.741379310344827

It relies far too much on beer drinking, farting and burping - and doesn't have the heart of The Simpons or the wit of King of the Hill.  It tries to be witty by splicing in several references to 70's and 80's pop culture but these always feel forced and trivial.  Many of the characters are plain annoying (Peter and Chris) while others are under-developed (Meg).  Stewie is fairly funny but he's kind of a one note song (does the same things over and over and uses the same lines in every episode like 'what the deuce!'..funny the first time but repetitive very quickly).  Brian the Dog can be VERY funny and simply needs more screentime as the Griffin Family's alcoholic pooch.  2 stars for some moments of levity.",1128384000,4,801,4.4520547945205475

1825609,4,B000083C6V,"Just kidding. It will be a long while before that happens. I didn't care much for Family Guy when it first came out. I thought it was a wanna-be Simpsons. Well I, like many other people, have become a fanatic of this daring show. Since I've played the deuce out of volume 1 and 2, anything new is very welcomed. The creators really pulled out all the stops in making this DVD. It is treated like a feature film. It has a red carpet premiere with guests like the greased-up deaf guy, Kool-Aid Man, and, straight out of Chris' closet, the Evil monkey (who strikes a pose for the cameras), previews, an intermission, and a ""rap-up"" party at the Drunken Clam where the Griffin family discuss what they did during the show's cancellation (Meg did a Cher take-off for the troops and the troops took off, Lois' life really went in the sewer as one would expect. She does remind me of One Day at a Time's Bonnie Franklin). The movie is like a triple episode with all the side references one would expect from any Family Guy show. My favorites: Peter as Richard Dawson on Family Feud, what blinded Ray Charles, Stewie and Brian playing a Pac-Man game ""I'm not going to get the fruit there's a ghost right there!,"" a twisted Sam Adams commercial and Bugs Bunny finally getting what's coming to him; even the National Diabetes Assoc gets it. The wacky, waving, inflatable, arm-flailing tube man is one of the worst and most annoying. Oh, yeah, and the movie...

Stewie takes swimming lessons and, in an attempt to eliminate a rival, has a near-death experience. This scare is seen as a sign for Stewie to change his ways. First, he becomes nice to the point of inducing vomit. Then he takes to the bottle (not the baby bottle) which really induces vomit. Brian takes him to a bar to make him so sick he will never drink again. Horrace the bartender asks of the baby ""Hey, is he 18?"" Brian responds, ""Horrace, the drinking age is 21."" Horrace then say ""Oh"" and leaves. After a hangover and automobile mishap, Stewie decides he needs to find himself and hopes to find someone just like him who understands him well enough to guide him. While watching the news, he spots a man in San Francisco (where else?) who looks just like him. Just a coincidence? His real father? An even closer relation? Stewie and Brian take Quagmire's ""Cross C*ntry"" RV to find out. In his quest to find himself, Stewie learns things about the future that are not at all pleasant. The DVD runs about an hour and a half and includes uncensored audio track, commentary from Seth MacFarlane, the cast and writers, and ""animatic comparison.""",1128297600,,2599,4.565310492505353

1825626,5,B000083C6V,"While the new Family Guy release wasn't what I thought it'd be, it was a clever endeavor right in line with the show. Often when a TV series makes a movie it tries to encompass the whole run of a series, or provide some over-arcing storyline. Not true with the Family Guy movie. It was basically just a really long episode (3 to be exact- and all from different writers), but it flowed together just like a regular half hour show- which means random stories regularly interrupted by irrelevant montages and asides- you know, what makes it so great.

Its also no worse than what they show on regular network TV- I'm not sure what the big UNCENSORED deal is.

My favorite part was the opener- the news leading up to a red carpet opener. Very fun.

The Special Features are lame previews and of course, the now standard commentary. But they did include a neat trick where you can watch the whole thing as a sketched cartoon side by side with the fully animated version. That was cool for about... 5 minutes.

I definitely recommend watching this, but if you're debating between buying this and buying a season of shows on DVD- buy the season. However, if you can buy both- you'd better pick this one up... and its cheaper here on Amazon than in the store.",1128124800,2,1252,4.478070175438597

But the movie, which is essentially three episodes of Family Guy, will probably be shown on TV and subsequently released on a season DVD set.  In other words, you can pay $20 to get three episodes now, or pay $30 to get a whole season later.

The only ""extras"" on this DVD are commentary, a uncensored version (no bleeping), and about a ten minute filler before and after the movie (which is good, but not $20 good).

I'll save my $20 now and buy the whole season later.  I love the Family Guy, but I hate it when companies repackage DVDs with slightly different content to make more money.",1128124800,8,772,4.326388888888889

1825651,5,B000083C6V,"This is one of those shows that your friends tell you is great and you have to watch it.  And then you never bother to do it.  But when I finally started watching it, I was floored by how funny it was.  Funnier then the Simpsons, and although some things are ""extremely edgy"" they will make you laugh.  Unlike some of the newer South Park's which just make you cringe.

Having said that, if you were to purchase only one of the DVD's in the Family Guy series, I would recommend any other set except this one.  I think the third season, when they were about to get cancelled was the funniest.  The show got funnier as it went along, and even though this DVD has 28 episodes, only a few of them rate as a top 20 episode in this series' short run.

If you've never seen the show, but think you'd enjoy it, I'd get the ""Freakin' Sweet Collection"" which is an inexpensive five episode sampler, make sure you like it, and then go ahead and buy Volume 2 instead of this DVD.

Don't get me wrong, this DVD still ranks 5 stars.  It's gut-busting funny, just not as good as the later episodes.",1128038400,,1083,4.213592233009709
1825652,5,B000083C6V,"It's difficult to ride the kind of success that a show like Family Guy is enjoying right now. This is a show that was cancelled because it was too provocative, which subsequently earned it a cult status that grew to such infamy that Fox had little recourse but to bring it back. Now it's back and everyone is paying very close attention to when Family Guy is going to fail. Sadly for you haters that is not going to happen a) because Seth Macfarlane created the crappy American Dad to divert our attention from any of Family Guy's shortcomings and b) because Family Guy is just too good. Even a mediocre episode is going to guarantee at least one laugh-out-loud scene that will leave you on a good note before out-of-ideas Simpsons comes on.

This movie embodies all that Family Guy has achieved in its comeback. Yes, some of the jokes and characters are getting a little tired (the novelty of greased-up deaf guy has worn off) and yes, some of the creators' humor is slightly too left of center for everyone to get in on the joke; but for every belly-aching laugh-out-loud-till-you-start-crying scene that there is in this film (and there are plenty) you will not be dissapointed.

I know it's unfair to compare Family Guy and The Simpsons because any show that runs for more than a decade is going to run short of ideas but this must be said: when I heard the Simpsons were going to the big screen I though ""yawn""... whereas when I heard about this straight-to-DVD Family Guy movie I was foaming at the mouth. The story is quite ludicrous (Stewie thinks he saw his real father on TV so he goes off looking for him with Brian) but allows for endless possibilities of hilarious scenes and quotables. Despite having used this idea twice before Brian and Stewie on another road trip is actually not a tired formula - the two make a great comic pair.

If you are a huge fan of Family Guy then I highly recommend this. Think of it as owning three additional episodes in your pre-existing collection. The humour doesn't deviate from classic Family Guy gags, complete with political subtleties (Tom Tucker: ""Actually Peter we've been looking for something to replace our 'Focus On The Middle East' segment""), blatant sexual inuendo (Lois: ""Ok Chris, so we've talked about kissing and cuddling, now we're going to learn how to eat out... at a fancy restaurant"") and hilarious slapstick. Unlike in most other series or cartoons where at least one character is always unbearable and unfunny (Lisa Simpson) every character in this feature is priceless, even Meg. You're guaranteed Seth MacFarlane's quirky pop culture references (including a hilarious scene involving the classic Thundercats cartoon) that may either catch you off guard or not even catch you at all but that, in my opinion, is another beauty about this program: it forces you to pay attention.",1128038400,7,2850,4.753535353535353

For this movie, one of the reviewers said that they cussed a lot in this movie instead of doing any funny jokes and Lois said the f bomb. Um, actually, ALL OF THE F WORDS WERE BEEPED OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHAT MOVIE WERE YOU WATCHING?
For all of you people saying the first 3 seasons were great and then it went sour, WHAT SHOW ARE YOU WATCHING? HOW ISN'T IT FUNNY? It's only not funny for way over sensitive weirdos who don't like to laugh! Family Guy uses over the top humor to make people laugh and I swear that I am not on the same planet as some of you people. I have no idea how this isn't funny..
Now for the movie. This movie was by far the best Family Guy thing ever created. It's a movie better than all of the episodes combined! This movie seriously had a really cool plot and nonstop hilarious moments. I was dying on the floor of laughter every second. I was out of breath I laughed so hard.
The movie is about good old Stewie seeing a man who looks just like him. His real father? who is this man? Well, I won't give it away but what you're in for is some great humor. This movie includes a trip to San Fransisco as well as one into the future.
It has nonstop outrageous moments including a scene with gigitty gigitty Quagmeyer doing something that had me laughing so hard, I almost died. It really does have everything, focussing on the best characters of the show, Brian and Stewie but of course including all of the rest and once again hilariously screwing Meg over!
There is one regret for me though. No Adam West! No perverted ol geezerd! That's too bad because I really love Adam West and he adds so much to the show. If they would have added him, well, I don't even know if I'd be here writing this review. I'd probably be dead of laughter. Anyway, it still ends out being the funniest Family Guy thing ever!

The story here for me is ideal, because it focuses on Stewie. I am a huge fan of stories that do not revolve around Peter, because he needs to be able to be on screen sporadically and be funny every time.  And this is Peter at his friggin best!  I won't give away plot details, because the premise given on the box only scratches the surface about what the movie is.

The bonus features are lacking, but the ability to take off the bleeping is nice.  It feels like this was definetely created before the show was to return to the air, because many of the jokes before and after the movie revolve around what the cast did while they were gone.

That being said, I'm very disappointed by this garbage.  Most of it is just plain not funny.  The parts that are supposed to be funny are so forced it turns my stomach.  At best, it's three of the worst Family Guy episodes they've made, available on one DVD.

It is however Family Guy.  And if you're as big a fan as me you'll have to check it out.  Please rent it though.  It's not worth the money.

I'll say this though, I'm shocked and amazed by the number of actual guest stars they got for this.  I'm guessing a lot of it has to do with Fox's influence, but still, it was cool to see... not that the guest stars were very amusing, just interesting to see.

I'm also begining to think that the unaired Family Guys are unaired because they're sucky.  First that terrible Jewish episode they released with Season 2/3, now this.

It has so many funny moments that it is one of rarest DVDs that you have to watch over and over to fully understand the humor. The pacing is little too fast because you'll be laughing and will miss the second joke because of the sound of your own laugh.  I loved most of the gags which was very aggressive, I mean you see and hear it and you feel like you got hit by a hammer because the jokes are harsh and funny at the same time. You wish you can work for Family Guy and have a lot of good time creating this type of humor.

1825686,4,B000083C6V,"Family guy, what else can you say about it. Its a hilarious show, and this movie is really funny, but ****Spoilers ensue

I thought this movie was about stewie finding his real father, and it turned into a time travel story with his future self. WTF? Reminded me of a past south park episode. Although its a hilarious movie, and its almost as good as the old episodes(the britney spears comeback was hilarious)they marketed it as something completely different, but the story is good, and its well worth the price. You're gonna buy it eventually, so just buy it now, while its on sale.",1127865600,,585,4.625
1825687,5,B000083C6V,"Let me just start by saying that I thought this DVD, upon hearing about it as rumors way back last year, was going to be a piece of garbage. Allow me to explain. I assumed that the producers of Family Guy were going to slap together three episodes and call it a movie, with no flow, and use it to make cash. I also thought that this movie wouldn't be funny, as it would have been slapped together while the show was being brought back into production, therefore diminishing its quality.

Gladly, I was proved very wrong.

In fact, I believe this DVD is actually better than most of the episodes from the brand new season of Family Guy. The three episodes are linked together quite nicely, with ""commercial"" skips used to separate the individual parts instead. Book-ending the parts are two little segments: The Red Carpet, where we see the Griffins go to the premier of the movie, and The Party, where the Griffins go to a wrap-party after the premier, and enjoy some Pawtucket Patriot Ale, as well as talking about what they have done in the time between Seasons 3 & 4. Truly amusing.

On to the movie itself: the movie attacks pop culture, per usual, and does it in themost tasteless way possible....yay! The complaint I have had about Season 4 was the WAY too many asides, where they say ""this is like the time where..."" and go off on a dead end. Thankfully, the movie has some of that, but isn't packed to the brim with it like in Season 4- in other words, its more in the style of old-school Family Guy, and, as fans know, thats a good thing. The movie isn't totally dedicated to Stewie and Brian either, something I feared as I think Peter is the best character and that Brian and Stewie are overrated, and would therefore get an unfair share of screen time. Fortunately, the screen time is evenly distributed, and makes for double the fun as you see two separate stories unwinding, with Stewie's naturally being at the forefront.

SPOILERS FROM HERE ON:

The thing I especially dug about this movie, aside from the usual goodies of Family Guy, was the way they talked about really dark subject matter. We get a look at Stewie's dull future, talk about Brian dying, and see Chris abused by his cursing-wife, and Peter and Lois moving into an old-folks home. Meg has a sex change, but that is actually not as much dark as it is funny and disturbingly expected. I especially liked the twist ending, and was not expecting what happened. A+ for movie content.

Now, for the special features. The commentary, unlike the TV-DVDs ones, is actually informing. Sure, we get the clever banter we all know and love, but we actually get some hardcore information in this commentary, and have our questions answered. A+ for that, its a great time.

As for the sneak peeks, they really aren't sneak peaks as much as they are clips from the show interspersed with an announcer talking about how silly the characters are. I was disappointed here, as I had hoped to see maybe a look at the DVDs, or maybe a look at episodes that were coming up. Alas, you can't win em all.

The animatics are like those on Volume 2, and are interesting as always.

The things to watch: UNCENSORED audio track, then play it with commentary to enjoy fully.

5/5, quite a great DVD. Can't wait for Season 4 to be released.",1127865600,4,3291,4.515966386554622

Personally, I felt a little cheated after the movie finished. The reviews for it were so good that I expected more. I expected and wished for the movie to keep the pace it started with.

I have such good memories of Family Guy before it was taken off the air, and although I have missed the new episodes, it is always good to get a laugh, especially when a show does not assume that the audience is ignorant.  If you KNOW that you don't like ""offensive"" material in your comedies, and I think every adult has already made this choice long ago, then why the heck would you bother to even watch it?  Anyway, the only complaint I had was the price.  To me, it could have gone for less than 20 bucks!

1825702,4,B000083C6V,"With a show like Family Guy, it often carries the type of devout fans that are never satisfied by hype.  If this DVD would have discreetly crawled to the shelf and sat down next to the new rerererelease of ""Cinderella"", they would have crapped their pants, taken it home, and laughed until they crapped again.

However there was a lot of hype surrounding this one, and I'm not sure if people were expecting some kind of religious, life-changing experience, but I feel that it definately delivered.  Granted, the ""uncensored"" propaganda was a bit much, considering all they did was drop a few BLEEPED f-bombs and portray Lois as being a little sexier than usual.

It's everything we (the fans) have come to know and love about Family Guy.  Considering its usually hypersonic speed of storytelling, it IS a bit strange at first getting used to a single story that drags out for 88 minutes, but once I was settled in I actually found myself laughing out loud more often than not.

FINAL VERDICT:

This one is definately a BUY if you're already a fan.  If not, it's still a RENTER.",1127779200,,1077,4.631578947368421
1825703,3,B000083C6V,"Don't let my subject line fool you. Yes, the DVD art was right, that this ""movie"" has never actually been ""seen"" before, but damn, a lot of jokes sure seem familiar, eh?

""Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story"" revolves around who else, but Stewie, the youngest member of the Griffin family, and arguably, the most popular. So it would make sense that if they were to do an hour and a half ""Family Guy"" movie (or just a really long episode) it should star Stewie! Remember the epsiode ""Road To Rhode Island?"" Deja Vu! After about a half an hour of going almost nowhere, with only one funny joke (""Ew! A band-aid!""), Stewie spots a man on television who looks remarkably like himself. Assuming this man must be his father, as someone like Peter couldn't be the father of such a genius, he takes Brian out on the road with him, on a cross country trip in Quagmire's RV, to find who he thinks is his long lost father. When he finally tracks this man down, however, he discovers it is his future self. Realizing what a loser he will become, Stewie rushes to try and fix up his future life, so he won't end up a 35 year old virgin with only one testicle.

Now, aside from the fact that the movie moves at a snail's pace and takes forever to get to it's point, it just isn't half as funny as the show. Not quite sure why that is. Even the new, fourth season is still funny (although not quite as good as the ""Family Guy"" we knew in the past), but this ""movie"" just doesn't live up to the show. The best thing about ""Family Guy"" is that, if you don't like a joke, it doesn't matter, because there's another one coming around the corner. Here, they are few and far between, and often, quite unfunny. There is a lot of recycling used in this movie, a lot of jokes that have been done long ago, it makes me think that this movie is meant to appeal to people who have yet to pick up on the show. I honestly don't think this movie was a bad concept, but they easily could have compacted it into a normal 22 minute episode (afterall, nothing really happens in the first 22 minutes of this movie). Of all the jokes, sight-gags and whatnot, I'd say there are half a dozen funny ones (love that Stork gag).

1825738,1,B000083C6V,"Family Guy didn't always suck. The original run of three seasons resulted in a crude, yet sharp and very funny animated TV show. It wasn't a classic, but it was funny, and its not-so-lofty goals were achieved with energy to spare.

But when it popped back on television a few years after cancellation, it was never going to work, and doesn't. The new Family Guy is a weak rip-off of the original, forcing the ""obscure-but-cool"" pop culture references down the audience's throat and then drawing each unfunny joke or reference (mainly to itself) out to excruciating length. It's not enough to be rude and outrageous just for the sake of it, the new Family Guy has to rub it in our faces, leaving a bad taste in the viewer's mouth.

Of anything that's been produced during the New Family Guy reign, this movie is by far the worst. The episodes range from the rare B+'s to the all-too-common D's, but this movie is an easy D-, representing the worst newly-released feature-length comedy I've seen in five years. I know I'm going to get scathed by hordes of 15 and 16-year-olds who revere the show as some sort of comedic Holy Grail, but despite the promise of ""unhelpful"" tagging, I'll say it again for the cheap seats: this movie sucks.

The movie wallows in a string of unfunny movie premiere jokes before finally gearing into a subpar plot that strings three seemingly rejected episodes of the show together into something about as unimpressive as that sounds. Everything feels like it got sent to the animation house during the script's first draft, much like any given episode of the new show. Yes, there are a handful of amusing jokes -- but I laughed about as much as I would watching any one episode of original Family Guy. Considering the film is three times as long and crammed wall-to-wall with gags, this is not a particularly flattering ratio. The movie also throws in some truly gratuitous musical numbers as well, which the show itself would go on to do with alarming frequency.

I know it's not a popular opinion, but it's true -- it just ain't the same. When it comes to comedy, while hilarity is subjective, laziness is not, and this movie is lazy. Whether or not you laugh (and, I reiterate, I didn't), the effort put forth by the filmmakers is very weak, and I fully expect that within a few years, once the hype over the show's return has died down and people are actually trying to rewatch and love the new episodes they thought were great in the way they rewatched and loved the old episodes, they'll find there's a lot less meat on the bones than meets the eye.",1127347200,48,2582,4.594360086767896

1825751,3,B000083C6V,"Well, I was literally dying to see this, as were the friends I watched it with. Most people know that Family Guy is one of the most consistently funny TV shows ever, and the prospect of an entire movie was exciting to say the least.

And it isn't a movie. It's three seperate yet linked episodes from season 4, with filler at the front and end (neither of which is that funny, although Bowie gets a killer line) and a relatively amusing 'intermission' section in the middle.

The first 'episode' is hilarious. Really, really funny. It gets proressively more tiresome as the movie goes along, although there are standout gems throughout. The one that got me is the scene where Stewie jumps out of the window whilst chasing his 'father', and the next shot is of a moustacioed fat stunt guy in a Stewie costume falling down the outside of the building. It's times like this, when Family Guy takes the piss out of conventions, cliches and itself that it is at it's most amusing and incisive. The elementary shock value of the characters finally being able to say f*ck isn't that fantastic, it's something the majority of people moved on from after the first couple of series of South Park, a show which has itself moved away from its only tactic being shock value and has become better for it.

Other highlights of the film include the Walt Disney and Barbara Streisland sketches, and the Jesus bit (actually pant wettingly funny). Stewies put down of Vanessa is amazing, as is the segment where Stewie is up on pep pills.

I wouldn't watch this film if you are uncomfortable with the TV series' ""When you wish upon a Weinstein"" episode however, as the film could be interpreted as even more anti-semetic (I don't see it that way, but can understand why some would).

Asides from the nuggets however, much of the comedy is formulaic and predictable. I also didn't like the way that they brought back or referenced so many one off characters from the series, it seemed to me like they are only thrown in there to convince the fans that something funny is happening, when all they are doing is going through the motions. I also thought the lack of consistent sub plots was annoying, and think that the writers have overdone the 'Stewie and Brian take a road trip' storyline.

Overall, this is a funny movie. But I think that hard core fans of the show expected (and deserved) so much more. Rent, don't buy.",1127088000,16,2400,4.595794392523365

1825767,4,B000083C6V,"The classic animated series ""Family Guy"", follows up the success of its return to the Prime Time lineup, with a DVD movie, ""Stewie Griffin, the Untold Story"". The film is a three part story wrapped around and intro and wrap up that parodies a Hollywood premiere and party.

  The jokes fly fast and bawdy and pull no punches. Every pop culture reference no matter how obscure and some of the more controversial issues of the day are tossed in, and for the most part, work.

  The story follows the evil genius Stewie, who after a near death experience decides to change his ways as Hell does not hold much appeal for him. After the family gets Tivo, Stewie spots a person on television that is a spitting image of him. Convinced that the man is his real father, Stewie and the family dog Brian, join the hormonally driven Quagmire on a cross country trek.

  When Stewie reaches the coast he is shocked to discover the true identity of the man which will propel the remained of the story.

  While the show has a few misfires, it is mostly filled with one effective joke after another. The laughs were constant and I found myself enjoying every moment of the film. The laughs are very good, and if you are a fan of the show and do not mind some biting, and crude humor, this is a great escape.

  Fans of the show will love the usual interplay of the characters and the familiar style and pacing as the film plays out like a regular episode of the show, as it was initiated as a three part episode. The inclusion of segments that would not have likely made it past the networks Standards and Practices department only ads to the enjoyment of the show as it is nice to see a shown known for pushing the envelope taking steps that it would not otherwise be able to take.

  4 stars out of 5.

What I have seen has been funny, in an offensive sort of way. It's definitely not sitcom for the Brady Bunch crowd -- and takes the Simpsons to another level. The Stewie Griffin movie tops the television show, being more offensive, and probably funnier than the television episodes -- which I would know if I had seen more of the TV show. The movie happens to be three episodes strung together to make a movie -- the episodes having never been aired -- with some new material added at the beginning and the end. If you're a fan of the show, and would like some new material to hold you over until the new shows are aired, Stewie's advertures will certainly fit the bill.",1125878400,4,820,4.401315789473684

1825773,2,B000083C6V,"I wanted this to be released in theaters, since I strongly support Family Guy and I consider the new season to be pretty darn good, but this 'movie', which streets at the end of September, is pretty lackluster.

I say 'movie' because they decided to make the three acts of the movie divisible so that they can air each one on television, minus a few not-so-TV-friendly moments, mostly an unrelated intro and outro, which are actually funnier than the movie itself.

The problem with the movie is that it just isn't very funny, or at least not Family Guy funny. The cut scenes that have become the trademark of Family Guy seem more unfinished. This is not to say none of the cut scenes are funny, but I'd say only one in four will have you laughing out loud.

The plot is loosely based on Stewie trying to find his real father after having a near-death experience, but its not that simple at all. It seems that he has the near death experience in the first third of the movie, and since its a 3-part movie, they can't have the plot progress at all for the next twenty minutes, instead Stewie just goes off on a pointless drinking binge of a plot that seems more like a typical subplot rather than a movie's plot.

This is where the film dead ends. I can appreciate 22 minutes of stupidity every week, but once you extend that to 90, you need more than just idiocy to get you by, you need something to keep you wanting to watch, even after you've take in a bit more of the Family Guy formula than you like to in one sitting. I could imagine it would actually be more enjoyable as three separate episodes, so if you purchase the DVD, watch the first 'episode' in the movie and stop. Then pick up the second the next day, and don't worry, it's not difficult to figure out where each episode ends. The reason it is so easy is because the rest of the family's sub plots conveniently change every 22 minutes, which entirely makes the film seem less like a movie, which is what I thought they were trying to make.

It is not a coincidence that the last act (or episode) is the best in terms of plot and being a movie, but the least funny, while the first third is the funniest, but seems the most like an episode. Perhaps Family Guy can't be a movie. Perhaps Family Guy is episodic, and it is pointless to even attempt a full length movie. I, personally, don't think so. I think it is possible, but the two are independent and you have to choose: Do you want this Family Guy story to be episodic or in a movie-style? You can't have both. This is what MacFarlane and gang didn't realize, they went for both, and got nothing. Perhaps if they tried for only one, they would have succeeded.",1124928000,15,2678,4.326693227091633

As with any Family Guy episode there are the occassional groaner, but for the most part it stays true to the TV series.

After a near death experience, Stewie tries to be a better person as to not end up in hell (his glimpse into his possible eternity of damnation left him frightened for his soul) After giving up on being nice, Stewie happens to catch a glimpse of a man on Television who has an uncanny resemblence to him- so he sets out, with Brian, to find the man who he believes is his REAL father.

The movie gives a glimpse into a possible future for the Griffin family, and, as in the TV series, Meg's future is the most interesting, and as it always is in the show, the meanest (what do they have against Meg anyway?)

For the Hardcore Family Guy fan (those that felt that it's first cancellation was a crime to TV, and rushed out to grab a copy of the the first season when they heard it was being released and missed many nights of sleep waiting for the day- yep - like me)- this is a must see, for casual fans of the show- eh- maybe- if you hate the show- just avoid it.

DAMMIT JANET (Stewie goes to daycare, Lois gets a job as flight attendent, one of my most favorite scenes- ""I'm Winston Churchill!"")

HE'S TOO SEXY FOR HIS FAT (Peter gets liposuction, Chris feels fat, more good lines: ""Um, sir, you can't park your van on the diving board"", Peter: ""I see you.."")

ROAD TO RHODE ISLAND (Stewie and Brian go on a trip to find Brian's mother)

PETORIA (Peter suceeds from the U.S. and makes his own country, hilarious cameos from Saddam Hussein, Fidel Castro, and Latoya Jackson)

I AM PETER, HEAR ME ROAR (Peter tells a sexist joke and goes to a woman's camp and becomes too feminine, tries to breastfeed Stewie, funny lines: ""Why do women have boobs?  So you've got something to look at while you're talking to them!"", ""Oh god, Lois, I'm late!  Where's that pregnancy test?"")

1825793,5,B000083C6V,"From the time Seth MacFarlane's Family Guy debuted on Fox on Super Bowl Sunday in 1999, it was destined for cult success.  With many comparisons to the Simpsons, Family Guy revolves around a Rhoade Island family: oafish father Peter, sexy mother Lois (voiced by MAD TV alum Alex Borstein), dimwitted son Chris (voiced by Seth Green), un-popular daughter Meg (later voiced by That 70's Show's Mila Kunis), talking family dog Brian, and last, but certainly not least, the show's main attraction, evil baby genius Stewie (voiced by MacFarlane, who does many other voices as well).  Hilariously irreverent and gleefully toungue-in-cheek, Family Guy ventured into places that other prime time animated comedies feared to tread.  In this collection of the first two seasons, Meg finds a death cult, Brian realizes he's in love with Lois, the family meets the Grim Reaper, and Peter learns he's a great piano player; as long as he's drunk.  Sadly though, because of Fox shuffling the show's timeslot around, eventually Family Guy was canceled, but only to be reborn in 2005 thanks to high rated re-runs on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim, and to the DVD sales.  Yes, Family Guy is one of those rare gems where you'll be laughing at nearly everything going on, and if you've never watched the show, now has never been a better time to check it out.",1123545600,4,1337,4.898230088495575

The writing is directly in line with most of the shows that we have all seen.  There are limits crossed, fun in store, and Quagmire does the USA.

The main plots as you've heard so far, Stewie thinks he's seen what must be his ""real"" father and goes to seek him out, and Peter gets to sound off on TV as to what ""Grinds my gears"".

Some of the extremes are Peter's ""...always wanted to get back into showbiz after they let him go from the Family Feud"".  Stewie's brief political stint, Stewie in hell, Stewie on alcohol and later 'pep' pills, Brian feeling uncomfortable because of ""stewie"", Meg making a change in her life ;).

I don't want to give too much away, but really the show is hard core in some spots, and standard family guy in others.  That's the same as saying Extremely Excellent in some spots and only Excellent in others... If you like family guy, you WILL like this movie and at 15 dollars its a steal!

I can't wait to see what the extras will be like, what I have seen is the Divx encoded rip that's traveling the net.

Get it on the net, but buy the DVD to support the show!",1123459200,7,1153,4.204545454545454
1825805,3,B000083C6V,"First of all, I'd like to say that I love this show.

Having said that, there are a few things that come to mind, one being the comparisons between Family Guy and The Simpsons, which others have elected to point out.

Some of which include:

1)Both fathers are morons who like to hang out with their friends at the local bar or sit in front of the TV.

2)Both feature evil sons, though Stewie is more of an evil genious while Bart is just evil.

3)Both feature mothers with annoying voices...though Lois will use her sex appeal...and both wear green.

4)Both have outcast daughters...at least Lisa is smart...Meg is just a drag with her whining and her ""woe is me I'm unpopular"" attitude.

5)Both feature a mix of regular and semi-regular supporting characters.

6)Both families have dogs...and this is where Family Guy scores, as Brian is vastly superior in intellect and everything else to Santa's Little Helper.

Without Brian and Stewie, this show would probably go nowhere and would certainly not have been resurrected as a series through its DVD sales. Do I see the show lasting sixteen years as The Simpsons has done? No, and this is the main reason... with The Simpsons, it took several viewings of episodes for me to become bored with certain ones...with Family Guy there were a few I would skip after viewing a couple of times.

It'd be nice to say that these episodes stand up to the test of time, but certain ones don't hold up.

Among these are:

Chitty Chitty Death Bang - not that funny to begin with (with the exception of Brian's line ""I SAID runt."")the whole cult, let's drink some poisoned punch thing.

DA BOOM - Too much like The Simpsons Treehouse Of Horror episodes and not consistant with the remaining episodes.

THE KING IS DEAD - Just not much to offer in this one at all in the way of humor.

I AM PETER, HEAR ME ROAR - Not that this is a bad episode, but that nipple sucking scene with Peter and Stewie gives me the creeps.

RUNNING MATES - Just shows what a jerk Peter can be towards his wife...much like THE KING IS DEAD.

A PICTURE IS WORTH A THOUSAND BUCKS - I guess I just find most episodes revolving around Chris or Meg boring and this one is right at the top.

E PETERBUS UNUM - Just the title alone makes it worth skipping.

Having said that, I would recommend the following as episodes worth repeated viewing:

DEATH HAS A SHADOW - The first and one of the better episodes of the first season.

MIND OVER MURDER - Lois becomes a stage attraction after Peter opens a bar in his basement after being placed under house arrest.

BRIAN: PORTRAIT OF A DOG - Brian faces the death penalty after running out on the family after misbehaving at a dog show.

BRIAN IN LOVE - Could Brian's carpet wetting problems have anything to do with his love for Lois?

DEATH IS A BITCH - Death is injured, so Peter has to take over his duties (this is one The Simpsons blatently ripped off in one of their Treehouse episodes when Homer kills death, then becomes him)

IF I'M DYIN', I'M LYIN' - Peter says Chris is dying so they can get their favorite show back on the air, then becomes known as a healer when Chris is ""cured"".

ROAD TO RHODE ISLAND - Probably the one I watch the most. I like the song Brian and Stewie sing and the interaction between the two on the road. Brian shows once again how he is at once the most adult and the most flawed character on the show.

LET'S GO TO THE HOP - Peter goes under cover to infiltrate the toad lickers at Meg's high school. Great musical number here, too.

DAMMIT, JANET! - The first of the ""Stewie In Love"" themed shows.

WASTED TALENT - Who knew Peter could play the piano...as long as he was wasted?

If nothing else, it proves the whole Family Guy pattern that some shows hit the mark while others just splat against the wall and slide to the ground. I would still recommend this box set, for it has some very entertaining episodes, but don't be surprised if you cross some off the list along the way.",1123286400,4,3970,4.398630136986301

up to its franchise (not Crow series),
but Family Guy series.

This movie was so funny that I died laughing!!!!
Really, so many laughs, so many highlights,
Fox finally has churned out a good one for the
loyal  fans of the tv shows.

The basic plot, is that is Stewie Griffin,
is doing his usual devious deeds as an infant, while
Peter Griffin lands a job with those wisecracking
politically incorrect reporters Tommy Tucker and Diane
Simmons. Tucker is a lot like Ferrel's character of
""Anchorman"", hes a male chauvonist pig. Of course
these character provide insight and jokes into the
corrupt mass media world where people will do
anything for a story. Continuing on, Stewie, finds
his life unfilled despite his evil history until
he sees someone that looks like his father, or
someone just like him. He then becomes obsessed
with finding him.

One of the highlights and there are plenty are a
couple of steroid jokes, more jokes poked at the
mass media, Tom, Peter's reporter rival, Stewie and
Brian (The Talking Dog) getting drunk and arrested
and much more Seen Stewie do his usual gags and getting
drunk was a riot.

Of course, there are thousand more jokes, which I cant
list  them all but what I can say with an honest face
is that this film really does justice to us Family Guy fans.

Any fans of the series need to watch this, and you will
probably watch this several times  because it is that damn good.

Shows like Family Guy don't dummy anything down, they
expose the  problems of America, abuse of power,
conservative corrupt media all through the magical power
of comedy and satire. Family Guy the series has now
become a great big following and its well deserved
for the crew and Seth McFarlane.

1825810,2,B000083C6V,"When I heard about this movie I was a little concerned because I didn't feel Family Guy was due for a movie. The show can barely carry itself for 22 minutes without using one or two tactics(the famous skinned knee) to fill that time.

While they did manage to toss in a few not-safe-for-TV moments, it was probably due to the weak content that this one was tossed straight to DVD. The movie's plot is no deeper than one of the episodes, and the gags seem a bit recycled. It's a stream of obscure pop culture references, visual gags and a bit of gross out humour. This will appeal to anyone between the ages of 13 to 25, and anyone else with a sense of humour.

My low score is because I'm rating this as a movie, and as such it fails. The pacing is wrong, the plot is boring and the movie brings nothing new to the series. This 90 minute let-down would of been better suited as trimmed 1 hour special, and if it were in that format my rating would be higher.

Trisha Takanowa sends her people back 1000 years.  Stewie finds himself.  Quagmire byes a Winebago, and puts the ""o"" in country.  Meg becomes the man she's always wanted to be.

And since everybody I know likes at least one of these shows, it saddens me that there are fans of one show who insist on rebuking the other. Instead, people need to realize that it is these similarities that make both of these shows so great. Family Guy's humor may be a bit more abrasive, but it's just as successful at striking the right chords to make you laugh. Another comparison I can make with Family Guy is with the movie Airplane! Both feature quick pacing jokes which allow room for the hits and misses, and many many spoofs of different movies and tv shows (like my oh so favorite show, the Simpsons).

1825836,2,B000083C6V,"This is a blantant rip-off of the Simpsons. First off, yes this is a funny show, but it is only funny rarely and really only because of Seth Green and Alex Borstein.

First off all, animated primetime shows were a dyind arts for 30 years before The simpsons came along, saved animated shows, became the 2nd greatest show ever (2nd to Monty Python) and unfortunatley inspired other people to make there other, most of them unfunny. The only really funny ones were Futurama and The Critic which wee Simpson spinoffs really anyway. Family Guy is one of those unfunny rip offs like American Dad which was on for about 3 weeks.)

The Simpsons in seasons 3-6 did ""cutaways"", which were short bits that were unrelated. They were funny. This show copied it and did it for a few times for some laughs, but now the show is half cut aways and hardly any story. Mostly uneccisary nudity is what this show is now.

Peter Griffin is fat, stupid, drinks at the local bar with his two friends one black one white, and loves his family in his white shirt and blue pants. So does Homer Simpson.

Lowes Griffin is struggling to keep up with her three kids. So is Marge Simpson.

Meg Griffin is a misfit, can't get a boyfriend, is unpopular and is the most ignored family member. So is Lisa Simpson. Do you see the patern now?

What made me do this review was an outrage I had while watching the new one today. The fourth season episode ""Marge in Chains"" is an episode in which Marge goes to jail for shoplifting, meets friends in prison, and at home everything falls apart including the people. The one on a few hours was exacty the same. Are the low-brow devoted fans ever gonna wake up? Many of them are Simpson fans, so you'd think they'de have noticed by now, but are most likely denying it.

This show has only gotten worse over time. I liked it when it first came out. The show has been less funny by now, like the Simpsons did, but that took over a decade, this show has only been on 5 years. When the season premire came out this year, it was the most unfunny thing. It was worse than friends for crying out loud. Jokes about cripples, Jesus on a cross (which is funny only if it goes so far, but this is just blashemous) and kids dying of cancer. That's not dark humor, just disgusting. It seems that to get attention, this show feels the need to try to shock it's audience for publicity or to possibly get more blockheads to buy the DVDs who enjoy constant fart jokes.

The next day i mentiond to my friend about how bad that season opener was, and he a devoted fan claimed it was the worst episode they'd ever done.

Besides a small amount of these early episodes being funny, it gets two stars for it's ""Monty Python's Meaning of Life"" parody I saw on adult swim.

So this show will now go into the category of 7-10pm sunday night shows, that have long been burned out, that's now being called ""Animation Domination. FOX has been trying to fill that 9pm spot after Malcolm in the Middle which if anybody noticed is live action. You should go on the internet and dicover how many shows have gone in that spot and been cancelled before there first season ended. Make a drinking game of it.

So in conclusion, please don't purchase this DVD if you want smart, satirical humor that never ages wit constant topical jokes. Check out The Simpsons, Monty Python, MR. Show, Seinfeld, even the Honeymooners. If you enjoy low brow fart jokes, cripple jokes and lavatrial omur an average 1st grader would love, then click the ""NO"" button below and buy this DVD.

1825841,5,B000083C6V,"Throughout most of the 90s, ""The Simpsons"" pretty much was the only show of its kind.  An edgy cartoon that was actually geared toward adults instead of kids, it surprised many with its cultural, political, and religious satire all done with an eclectic and sometimes bizarre cast of characters.  The show obtained a large, devoted cult following, with many hardcore fans (myself included) who have watched nearly every episode and know dozens of ""Simpsonisms"" by heart.  As good as they are, the Simpsons' glory days have long passed, and as the show heads into its 14th season (it's the third longest running comedy series after ""Ozzy and Harriet"" and ""My Three Sons), it's starting to get stale.

Enter ""Family Guy"" in 1999.  Created by Seth MacFarlane (who also does most of the show's voices) (Family Guy took the basic Simpsons formula of satire and dysfunctional family humor and spiced it up with even more innuendo, lewdness, and hideously un-PC jokes.  Despite its excellence and extensive praise from critics, the show had a largely unremarkable run, with FOX juggling the show's scheduling until it was finally cancelled.  Then, FOX released the family's exploits on two DVD sets, one of which this review is about.  The DVDs sold like hotcakes, and the sales were so strong that FOX recently bought it back for another season.

A show is only as good as its characters, and Family Guy excels in this regard.  The basic family upon which the show centers is remarkably reminiscent of the Simpsons - Peter Griffin (voiced by creator Seth MacFarlane), middle-class, dim-witted, overweight, arrogant, yet charming father of two teenage kids and a very unusual baby (more on him later), and his more intelligent wife Lois, who keeps him in check while providing much needed support for the kids as a stay at home mom.  While comparisons between Peter and Lois and their counterparts Homer and Marge are unavoidable, Family Guy's leading couple have a style that is very distinct from their Springfield cousins (not literal cousins, of course, although that would be an interesting family reunion...)

Perhaps the one (and only) area where Family Guy fails - especially in comparison to the Simpsons - is in the family's kids.  Chris and Meg Griffin are, for the most part, stereotypical teenagers, and their place in the show sometimes feels a bit forced.  Granted, they have their moments, and once in a while the plot will take advantage of their characters, but the Griffin kids are nowhere near as multi-layered and animated (no pun intended) as Bart and Lisa Simpson.  If Chris and Meg were as good as the other characters, this show would top the Simpsons easily.

Strangely, the show's best characters are the ones that make no sense whatsoever.  Specifically, Brian and Stewie Griffin.  Brian (also voiced by MacFarlane) is the Griffin's talking dog who is, in fact, the smartest member of the family.  Despite the fact that he's a dog, Brian's character is intelligent, witty, and very multi-layered.  Brian more so than anybody on the show has to deal with difficulties.  He has to deal with being the only intelligent member of an unintelligent family, along with the fact that he seems to be the world's only talking dog.  He's a smoker and borderline alcoholic, binging on dry martinis whenever he gets a chance (his drunken scenes can be quite hilarious, in a perverse sort of way).  He has psychological problems, thanks to his difficult past and repressed sexual urges (which is why he has a therapist who is a semi-regular guest on the show).  Many audience members can sympathize with Brian's frustrations, ironically making him one of the most human characters in the show.  The episodes that take full advantage of his character, like ""Brian in Love"" and ""Road to Rhode Island"", are often the funniest and most interesting episodes in the series.  While part of the humor comes from the fact that he is a dog, it's obvious to any viewer that there's a lot more to Brian than that.  Despite all these layers, his main role is the same as all the other characters - a punch line for the show's outrageous, offensive humor.

But the real star of the show for many is Stewie Griffin.  Even though he's only one year old, Stewie is the most maniacal and sadistic character on the show.  Voiced once again by MacFarlane (albeit with a British accent), Stewie is bent on taking over the world and destroying anybody who gets in his path - including his own family!  If Stewie were a few years older, he'd probably be a twisted serial killer on CSI or Law and Order - that's how evil he is.  Stewie is one of those characters where either you get him, or you don't get him.  Those who don't understand his appeal will be a bit confused as to why he's so popular, but the few people like myself who recognize the sheer brilliance of Stewie will start laughing whenever he speaks.  Once again, it sounds confusing, but you have to see the show to understand.

This is probably Family Guy's biggest strength and its biggest weakness: the show is very situational.  In the Simpsons, most moments have a witty quote or two that sums up the event, like the famous Homerism ""just because I don't care, doesn't mean I don't understand"".  In Family Guy, the writers take full advantage of the situation, making for moments that, while hilarious, can't be done justice with words.  For example, in one scene, Brian is driving a car through the countryside after deciding to get away for a while.  He hits a man walking on the road, gets out and says to him, ""Oh my God!  Are you Stephen King?!"" The man says, ""I'm Dean Koontz!""  Brian says ""oh"", obviously extremely disappointed.  He proceeds to get back in his car and purposely back over Dean Koontz again, then runs over his body once more and drives away.  It doesn't sound funny here, but when you see it, it's hilarious.  Every moment in Family Guy is like that.  It's what makes the show so funny, but on the flip side it makes it hard to explain the appeal to your friends who haven't seen the show.

This particular DVD set, Volume 1, contains 28 episodes from seasons one and two.  The second volume is season three, which is also excellent, although I recommend you get this first simply because there are more episodes. I haven't watched the special features yet, but I was never one to care about special features on DVDs in general.

If you're still not sure if you'll like or not, watch Family Guy on FOX Sunday nights or on Cartoon Network's ""Adult Swim"" on Thursday nights.  It's not for everybody, but if you've ever shown even a remote interest in the Simpsons, Family Guy will be an instant new favorite.",1120953600,2,6684,4.73552290406223

I had to endure FOX moving it's time schedule and not showing it for weeks at a time.  The exploits of Peter Griffth and his dysfunctional family are a real hoot.  A show filled with pop culture references and very odd movie, music and historical name dropping and information as well.  T.V. has become boring and stagnant.  Family Guy strecthes the limits of taste and sanity. What makes this show even funnier is the fact that this family is all too real.

Seth MacFarlane must be commended for creating such a constantly funny show.  His political views and ideals are refreshing as well.  After having to tape the show constantly due to it's ever changing schedule (1999  to 2002) I am so glad this show was released on D.V.D.

I guess that little kids are too young to comprehend most of the jokes on Family Guy. I'm going on 15 but I understand all of them and this show is by far the funniest ever. Family guy was most definitely influenced by the simpsons but it's now WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY better than the simpson. Peter ressembles Homer, and Lois ressembles Marge. But Chris is a lot more awesome than Bart with the evil monkey in his closet and his jokes. ""THEY GIVE YOU 4 QUARTERS FOR 1 DOLLAR!!!!"" Meg is hilarious with her weird hat and she beats lisa barely. But, then who's better, Stewie or Maggie? I menan come on, Maggie doesn't even talk! Stewie is absolutely hilarious with his catch phrases (Dam*!)and no one even realizes that he is a genius. He wants to kill Lois and has picture books of him trying to kill her (a la psycho shower scene, poison drink, etc..) and Brian is a billion times better than santa's little helper. He goes to a psychiatrist, no one seems to realize that he can talk, he smokes and is always drunk! You just got to love him. And even though the simpsons has a lot more characters, Family guy has better ones like the sex pervert Quagmeyer, Cleveland, Joe, Tom Tucker, Trisha Tackinawa, etc..

While the Simpsons just seems to the most of time just tell an interesting story, Family Guy tells an interesting but hilarious story. Family Guy makes me laugh, and that's something that I like doing. But, I have to admit that sometimes it does go over the top, and when it does, I feel that it's innapropriate. Nevertheless, it's usually hilarious with only certain parts that are over the top. But, if parents are worried for their young children about watching this show, I do admit that it's probably better for 13 year olds and so forth due to some unnecessary over the top stuff that comes along every once in a while. It still is my favorite TV show because I'm a guy that prefers watching a show that makes me laugh every week and not be nervous that there might be a robber in my house. But that's just me.

This is not a case of one show being better than the other, but it's a part of the cycle of television shows. The Simpsons is sadly, slowly drying out and dying and Family Guy is full of life, strong political undertones, and juicy storylines which have yet to have been exposed.

And personally, The Simpsons has become too streamlined to the public and Family Guy has more of a ""cult"" following, if you will. The dry wit and humor of FG creator Seth McFarlane have put him and his show head and shoulders above the rest.",1116201600,3,887,4.156976744186046

It's fun watching Peter being an idiot and watching the matricidal baby's plans get foiled once again. If your a fan of raunchy and far-out humor I would highly reccomend this. There are so many great gags you'll have to watch the episodes over because you will be laughing so hard you might miss one. Pick it up as soon as you can.",1114387200,,628,4.3760683760683765
1825867,5,B000083C6V,"Having first aired after the 1999 Super Bowl, Family Guy really hit its stride via cable re-runs and DVD sales (prompting Fox to announce the launch of Season 4 in May 2005, following the show's original cancellation following Season 3).

I was ecstatic when I heard it was coming back to TV. Till then, though, I'll just enjoy playing these over and over. Classics!

If you crave more irreverent humor, try a book called ""No One's Even Bleeding"". It should be a TV show, too!",1112140800,,401,4.569444444444445
1825870,5,B000083C6V,"First off, Seasons 1 & 2 of FAMILY GUY is great! I've had this for quite a while! You'll laugh long and hard!

To set the record straight... for those who think this is a ripoff of THE SIMPSONS...

1)If it wasn't for that show, it (and any other recent cartoons) would not be around.

2)THE SIMPSONS (then and now) has a similar, but somewhat restrained style. When FG came along, it took that style and raunched it up a few notches. I believe when THE SIMPSONS later followed suit, the results were (and are) mixed at best. If anything, FG also owes a lot to the short-lived show THE CRITIC* (also on DVD).

Anyways, enjoy... and chew on that gristle for a while. BTW, if you must resort to using wrong phrases in your review (""Who cares?"", etc.), think rationally before reviewing. Thank you.

A few things to note about this series is that season 4 is in the works and will begin to air in May 2005!  This marks the first time in history that a cancelled TV series has been ressurected by phenominal DVD sales.  This is a testiment to how great this show really is.

Any fan of Family Guy should get all 3 Seasons on DVD.  I've seen every episode about 5 times each but they are still hilarious! (I even notice some new jokes every time I watch an episode again)!  This show NEVER gets boring and will keep anyone laughing for a long time.  Probably even people who haven't seen a single episode will fall in love with Family Guy (I did and now I'm a big fan).,1109980800,3,564,4.045045045045045
1825874,5,B000083C6V,"My theory about Family Guy is that Seth MacFarlane (creator, animator, producer and most of the voices) ought to continue making Family Guy episodes EXCLUSIVELY to be released on DVD. That way he does not have to worry about the monkeys at the FCC or any other censorship board crawling down his throat. Family Guy is the torch bearer of adult cartoon comedy: it picks up where the sixth or seventh season of The Simpsons left off (anything after season seven is garbage, or at least inconsistent) and carries us into the 21st Century with an evolved sense of humor - infinitely more political and subversive than anything you have ever seen.

The show is roughly based on the Simpsons format, or rather on the post-Reagan sitcom format consisting of a dysfunctional blue collar family, circa Rosanne and Married with Children. The father is an oaf, the kids need therapy and the mom is a classic product of the repressive 1980s model of the nuclear housewife. Add one acholohic dog and a closetted homosexual baby bent on conquering the world and you have a cast made in comic heaven. Unlike the Simpsons this series is far less realistic, with talking dogs and babies and slapstick that is totally outrageous; but similar to the Simpsons, Family Guy takes real-life scenarios such as welfare fraud, racism or sexual harassment and places them within a totally ludicrous context. Take Peter, for example, who with a 100,000$ welfare cheque purchases Michaelangelos David. I cannot get into the details of each episode, but for what this series is worth you will not be dissapointed investing in this series. Each and EVERY character is priceless and manages to make you laugh until your stomach hurts. Unlike the Simpsons, where Lisa is rarely funny and extremely irritating, Family Guy is virtually amoral (void of morals) and therefore does not rely on any characters to act as a moral anchor to compensate for the rest of the casts antics. If you like watching or listening to George Carlin, whose comedy can make your stomach turn as much as it can make you cry laughing, you will love the confrontational-meets-hysterical comedy stylings of Family Guy.

1825876,5,B000083C6V,"This DVD set of the first two seasons is absolutely hilarious. Every episode is a ten with the exception of a few, which are 8 and 9s (on a scale of 10).

This show is for people who enjoy random and edgy comedy that makes fun pop culture. All the characters are funny in their own way, Chris the son is probably the least likable, but he has occasional one liners. You can't really compare the show to The Simpson's, they're just different shows. The ambiance of each is so different that they're incomparable. I mean they have a talking dog in this show, common!

Usually, babies talking as grownups don't work, but in this show, Stewie is hilarious. The writers have done a wonderful job of showing the world through baby's eyes and made him multidimensional by making him a matricidal anarchist. He has some classic lines in the show that are absolutely memorable. He is the most articulate person/baby on TV (I'm aware of Frasier).

""It seems with death incapacitated my matricidal efforts are futile.""

""Well, I'd love to stay and chat, but you're a total bitch.""

Lois: ""Oh, I haven't been on a college campus in years. Everything seems so different.""

Stewie: ""Really? Perhaps if you laid on your back with your ankles behind your ears that would ring a few bells.""

Seth McFarland, who does most of the voices on the show is a true genius. You can hear him on the commentary on some of the episodes, he is probably one of the funniest people you'll ever hear commenting.

It is just a refreshing break from normal TV, and I think that is why it is so successful, because it's one of a kind. There aren't any moral messages or political opinions, it's just plain fun.

Highly recommended.

1825882,5,B000083C6V,"This animated comedy show debuted in early 1999, definitely pushed the buttons on values and taste with great laughs. It's about this dysfunctional family who are called "" The Griffens"", Peter Griffen is the lovable dummy of a father whom loves his family very much & never enjoys too much fun even if it's on his mind. Chris is the 13 year son whom is also dumb like his dad, Meg is the teenage daughter that seems shy around her friends when she's with her family, Brian is the talking walking human-like dog, Lois is the gorgeous woman of the house and Stewie is the highly intelligent talking infant who has a plot for taking over the world.

This show is most definitely one of the funniest and most outrageous animated shows on TV! it did got canned in 2002, but luckily Adult Swim on ""Cartoon Network"" has gotten big time ratings with some new episodes coming out this year and has gained a huge cult following for it's wackiness, deadpan humor and satire.

This Boxset contains the first two seasons with three of my personal favorite episodes ""Death is a B*&^%&"", ""Road to Rhode Island"" and ""Waste Talent"" on this 3 Disc set that contains original Internet spots to promote the show, audio commentaries by the show's makers and a featurette behind the scenes on the show.

Peter (the father) is a complete idiot, but funny. Does not really care about anyone but himself.

Lois (the mother) is a typical house wife. Nothing really interesting or particularly funny about that character.

Chris (oldest son) is a bigger idiot then his father, but is not funny. This show without him would have been just as good.

Megan (the daughter) is an unpopular kid at school, who is always ashamed of her family. Typical daughter who is sometimes funny.

STEWART (YOUNGEST SUN) IS THE REASON #1 WHY I LOVE THIS SHOW AND THINK IT IS FUNNY. 1 YEAR OLD WHO TALKS WITH A BRITISH ACCENT AND SPENDS HIS DAYS FORMULATING THE PLAN TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD AND WHEN HE FINDS TIME AWAY FROM THAT, IS PREOCUPIED WITH MURDERRING LOIS.

If you love ""Family Guy"" as much as I do, then this DVD is a must. I will tell you why:

Season 1 (seven episodes)

1.- ""Death has a Shadow""

 Peter get fired from his job: ""Happy Go Lucky"" and recives a walfare check for $150,000. Later his wife, Lois, gets mad at him for lying and Peter decides to return the money to taxpayers on a ""Superbowl"". Hilarious episode and a great debut for this show. - 9/10.

2.- ""I Never Met the Dead Man""

 After Peter knocks out the local cable T.V. satellite by crashing his car into it, he starts apreciating life and drives his family crazy on spending more time with them with them with no television. Great episode, I loved it. - 9/10.

3.- ""Chitty Chitty Death Bang""

 Lois throws Stewie's first birthday party in ""Cheesie Charlie's and Peter accidentaly cancels the reservation so he will have to throw a party by himselfe. Meanwhile, Meg meets a new friend and is invited to a party the same day as Stewie's birthday, to make it worse the it was no party, it was a cult meeting. Great episode I liked it. - 9/10.

4.- ""Mind Over Murder""

 When Peter punches a woman he thought she was a man, he gets house arrested and to spend more time with his friends he builts a bar in his basement but turns out his friends come, not see Peter, but Lois singing. Not much of a fan of this episode but it was great overall. - 7/10.

5.- ""A Hero Sits Next Door""

 This episode is when Peter meets his next door neighbor wheelchaired cop, Joe, who one-ups him in a baseball game and Peter get extremeley annoyed by him, he tries to prove his is a hero too. It is a hilarious episode which I love. - 10/10.

PETER (THE DAD): THE FATHER, NOT REALLY LOVING OF HIS WIFE, SOMEWHAT OF A IDIOT. THE MAIN CHARACTER. VERY FUNNY.

LOIS (THE MOM): LOIS IS SOMEWHAT THE TYPICAL MOM. SHE STAYS HOME, SHE COOKS, CLEANS, LEARNS MARTIAL ARTS AND GOES INSANE OF A BAR FULL OF PEOPLE.

CHRIS (THE 1ST SON): HE PRETTY MUCH TAKES AFTER HIS FATHER'S BRAINS, BUT INNOCENT AT THE SAME TIME. DOESN'T REALLY KNOW MUCH BUT IS STILL LEARNING MAIN THINGS ABOUT LIFE.

MEGAN (THE DAUGHTER): THE OUTCAST, THE REJECT AND UNPOPULAR KID AT SCHOOL. YOU KINDA FEEL FOR HER SOMETIMES DEALING WITH HER SITUATIONS CONCERNING THE FAMILY MOSTLY.

STEWART (THE 2ND SON): THE 3 YEAR OLD WITH THE INTELLEGENCE OF BILL GATES. HE'S ALWAYS TRYING TO KILL LOIS BUT HIS HEIGHT AND AGE SOMEWHAT KEEP HIM FROM HIS EVIL PLANS.

BRIAN (THE DOG): HE'S THE RATIONAL ONE OF THE FAMILY. HE DOESN'T TAKE TOO MUCH FROM THE FAMILY, ESPECIALLY STEWIE AND PETER. IT WOULD BE SLICK TO HAVE A TALKING DOG.

Peter Griffin is the father and the husband.. he's loud, fat, stupid, and in-your-face. He's not afraid to be 100% honest and he gets drunk daily. ""Whoah is this really the blood of christ? Geeze he must've been wasted 24 hours a day eh?""

Lois griffin is the level-headed ""stick in the mud"" house wife and mom. When she's not taking care of the kids and chastising Peter she's teaching Piano to children on the side. ""But Mrs. Griffin, I practiced just like you said!"" ""Oh far be it for me to call you a liar"" ""What?"" Nothing See ya next week!""

Meg is the dumpy teenage daughter who tries so very hard to fit in and be liked. But no matter how hard she tries, she's still completely unpopular. ""Oh my god... I'm going to die! I'll never have that one last change to be some drunk college guy's last resort!""

Chris is the brother of Meg and he's a little on the retarded side. He's fat just like his dad and he has a henfty appetite too. ""I didn't do it.. it was the evil monkey that lives in my closet!""

Brain is the intellectual dog of the family. He loves to drink martinis and he's probably the most level-headed one in the family. ""Who's leg do you have to hump to get a dry martini around here.""

Stewie is the diabolical baby genius who plans for world domination. He's very intellectual sometimes, and incredibly juvenile at others. ""Actually the first bad thing I've ever done was plant a ticking time bomb inside your uterus. Happy 50th birthday, lois""

Finally add the randomness of Monty Python, not to mention some original characters, and you have Family Guy. By far the best comedy I've ever seen from America, Family Guy has tons of laugh out loud moments and some genuine comments and wit hidden amongst the ridiculous situations and sometime basic jokes. Whether you're laughing at the sometimes witty but often stupid one-liners or the wondorful use of visual and situational humour, Family Guy simply won't fail to provide you with a good show.

I normally review music so this is going to have to be short and sweet, but I'll end with this: if you havn't seen Family Guy then you're missing out on one of the funniest shows of the last decade.",1103587200,4,820,4.694444444444445

To tell you the truth I think Season One is the best out of the three. It's a shame they stopped making these, I don't know why though, they're great! Peter's comments and facial expressions at the end of 'The Son Also Draws' is priceless. Oh yeah, and Stewie is the best character! No question...just so you know.",1103587200,,441,4.594936708860759
1825904,4,B000083C6V,"In reading the several negative reviews that this show has gotten on amazon.com - and it got a lot more from professional critics when it was first released - I can't escape the feeling that its detractors misuderstand its intentions. It's quite valid to point out that the animation is not particularly interesting, that the voice acting lacks emotional subtlety, or that the jokes are usually not deeply witty reflections on the nature of modern family life. These things are all true. But they're simply not the point.

If you'll forgive a sexual analogy, Family Guy is masturbation, while what its critics want is sex. Family Guy exists to make you laugh as much as possible, period. To criticize it for not having deeper significance - social, artistic, other - is like criticizing masturbation because it doesn't bring you closer to your wife. Well no it doesn't, but that's not the point.

This is, of course, why it's a cult classic and not a wildly successful TV show. It will either make you laugh or not. If you're one of the people who finds it funny, you're likely to become slavishly devoted to it. If, however, its particular brand of humor doesn't appeal to you, it will look like an utter waste of time. That doesn't mean it's bad - contrary to popular belief, something needn't be universally loved by the intelligentsia to be worthwhile. (Trends come and go among critics as much as among laymen; Christianity was silliness to educated Romans, right up until it conquered the Western world.) The lesson is clear, though: Watch a few episodes on Cartoon Network. You'll either find an immense new source of joy in your life, or be out nothing more than an hour.",1103587200,5,1679,4.7465753424657535

I bought both box sets the day they came out and I bought the Freakin Sweet Collection the day it came out.  I had downloaded all the episodes and the American Dad pilot before they were available to purchase. I have watched every episode over 100 times. I love this show it is the greatest thing EVER written!!! (in my humble opinion)  I am on all the mailing lists for news of the show from FOX, FamilyGuyFiles, and PlanetFamilyGuy.  I own all the series of collectibles that came out from Metco and those bendy ones also.  What I am trying to say is I am powerless to resist the awesomeness of this show. [...] So if you have never watched this show you should. You should buy every box set that comes out and encourage all your friends to do so too.  Or better yet buy your friends copies like I did.  But BEWARE!!!! Once you start you can't stop.  And don't ever, ever, ever fall asleep watching it because you will have really really WIERD dreams.  I did it and told my friends about it and now they too suffer from Family Guy induced wierdness when they sleep. If you don't believe me go try it.

It is so funny, with so many different jokes in every single episode. The Simpsons is the best cartoon ever, no doubt. But Family Guy is funnier! The Simpsons just have better storylines (after 16 seasons, you should). Family Guy's cast of hilarious and idiotic Rohde Island residents will keep you laughing until you can't breathe. From Quagmire, a sexy beast, to Stewey, a brialliant young mind, determined to murder his mother, you'll never be without a laugh. It also has the most one liners from any show ever (except for the Simpsons, of course).

 Still, this show serves as a good bridge between those other,superior shows, and it is sometimes funny, even blatantly so.

In order to enjoy this kind of humor,you have to leave PC at the door,and just go with it. There are far more un-PC-shows on the tube today. This show makes fun of all of them,and does it so well.

I was hooked after the first episode, and after watching three more, I knew that I wanted to buy the DVD set for myself. FAMILY GUY: VOLUME ONE is awesome, and totally worth the 35-40 bucks.

Funniest episodes:
Chitty Chitty Death Bang - Meg decides to skip Stewie's first birthday party, because she's been invited to a party thrown by some kids at school (something that hasn't happened before). When she gets there, it turns out to be a cult meeting.
Love Thy Trophy - This is my absolute favorite episode of Family Guy. Meg gets a job at a diner, and when she realizes that she can make extra money in tips by telling people that her little brother (Stewie) is addicted to crack, he gets sent to a foster home.
Death is a [...] - Peter goes to the hospital when he thinks he may have cancer, and when he doesn't, he doesn't feel like paying the outrageous hospital bills. So he pretends to be dead. But what he doesn't know is that Death has to come and get him now, and in a freak accident, the rules of death no longer apply.

All the episodes on FAMILY GUY: VOLUME ONE are hilarious, and I just wish I had seen the show earlier. Highly recommended to fans of Friends, The Simpsons, etc.

First of all, I think this show can't even be compared to the Simpsons because they are both two totally differant shows with differant senses of humor. I respect everything Groening has done with the Simpsons, I mean any show that can stay on the air for 15+ years obviously has a formula that works. I don't think that the Family Guy didn't have that formula, on the contrary, I thought it had many things working for it. I don't beleive The Simpsons pushed the boundries the way FG did, which may explain FG's short-lived airing on FOX. I think right-wing-conservative America just wasn't ready for this kind of humor on national television. I highly recommend this DVD.",1099958400,5,849,4.51948051948052

Peter, the clueless patriarch, is married to a knockout redhead named Lois (""It not the great rack or the caboose - it's that big sexy brain of yours."" -Peter), whom their neighbor Quagmire is always after. Their kids Meg and Chris are both losers, which makes them all the more relatable. Brian, the talking dog, is more of a father figure than Peter, even with the dog's love of booze.

Stewie, the baby of the family, is by far the funniest character. Farther into the series, he really develops and isn't just the baby trying to kill Lois. If you're looking for more Stewie action, Season Three is definitely Stewie's heyday.

Where The Simpsons can be somewhat edgy without treading on thin ice, Family Guy takes those extra steps and dances all over the ice with glee.

Family Guy is the birthchild of Seth MacFarlane and focuses on the daily trials and tribulations of the Griffin family.  The patriarch of the family is Peter Griffin (voiced by MacFarlane), a Homer Simpson-type dad who is a little dim-witted but can sometimes find a bright spot in any situation (as noted constantly by the flashbacks he and the other members of the family get in each episode).  Along for the ride are Peter's long-suffering wife Lois, their pet dog Brian who through some strang ability is able to talk with the family, and their three children: Meg, who is going through all the teenage angst that most girls her age go through; Chris, the seemingly dumb son who has some hidden talents, and last but certainly not least Stewie, a little cutie with the mind and motives of a megalomaniacal tyrant in the making.

Family Guy was initally a hit, but Fox was afraid that censors would pounce all over the show and did virtually everything to make the show unwatchable by viewers.  Finally succeeding, the show was cancelled in 2000 and didn't gain success until Cartoon Network made the show part of it's Adult Swim lineup a little over a year ago.  When ratings for the airings on CN went through the roof and the sales of the DVD sets (this one and Volume 2)skyrocketed, Fox realized it made a terrible error in judgement (no surprise!) and decided to bring the show for a new series run sometime next year.

For those of us who can't wait until then, the first DVD box set contains the first 28 episodes of Family Guy over its first 2 seasons (the first season only ran 7 episodes, the other 21 comprise season two)and are some of the most hilarious of the series.  Needless to say that they also spawned some of the most classic lines in Family Guy history, especially Stewie's response to Lois' advice that he go outside and play: ""Why don't you burn in HELL?!?"".  In addition, if you don't find yourself dying of laughter from the scene in ""I Am Peter, Hear Me Roar"" where Peter tries to breast-feed Stewie (yes, you read that right), you need a serious humor transfusion.

If you consider yourself a fan of the series or you've just heard from word of mouth that this series is hilarious, get this set to see what all the fuss is about.",1099440000,3,2568,4.512931034482759

I never thought that I would see a show rival that of the Simpsons in my lifetime, but here we have Seth MacFarlane's exceptional series, The Family Guy.  The epitome of the American family, Peter helms the show with the goofball humor that you normally finding yourself laughing at in your own film.  The rest of the characters truly give 100% for each episode, with young Stewie emerging as an ultimate favorite.  It is impressive when a television program can take social issues and realistic moments and twist them into humorous antidotes about life and family.  I think that is what is most important about this program is the ""wholesome"" family values that it promotes.  While it may not demonstrate at the beginning of each program, by the end it really drives home the power of the American family.  For those that may not see this, I loved this show.  I couldn't get enough of it when it was on television, so I went ahead and bought the series, and it is the best purchase I have ever made.  I just finished watching this first compilation for the tenth time and cannot wait to rewatch again.

I had previously watched one or two episodes on fox, but because of the edgy material fox put the show on at crazy times, and never stuck to a schedual.  But since the show has been released on dvd a huge fan following has appeared over night and rightfully so!

Family Guy has the normal cartoon (simpsons) make-up the oaft of a dad, loveable as always is Peter Griffen.  Peter is one of my favorite characters.  Lois Griffen is the glue that holds the family together.  Chris Griffen is the troublesome son.  Meg Griffen is the self-conscious daughter.  But family guy has some unique characters as well Brian, the talking dog, is absolutely hilarious and is Peter's complete opposite.  Funnily enough, Brian is the intellectual character and always has some profound comment on any subject!  And of course Stewie.  How can you forget Stewie.... the bond villian like baby who is obsessed with killing his own mother!!  All of these core characters and of course the numerous other hilarious ones Joe, Loretta, Clevland, and Quagmire--giggidy giggidy make for one hilarious, edgy, and just flat out funny television program

No review would be complete without mentioning the one element that makes family guy what it is.  The cut scenes.. that time when a character says remember when... or I've been there... and then the viewer is swooped to different scene often with an hilarious outcome!!  Every episode is great... there is no way to pick a favorite... there is a moment in every episode where I was laughing so hard it hurt!!

1825928,4,B000083C6V,"All hail Seth Mcfarlane, for having the balls to sell his brilliant, edgy, and endlessly hilarious animated comedy Family Guy to Fox. Too bad the boring masses were too busy watching primetime tripe like Friends (next to Ally McBeal and Seinfeld, the single most overrated and overwatched show on the face of the planet) to appreciate this gem. After being dropped by Fox twice, it's since been consigned to Cartoon Network's Adult Swim (late night programming), where it fares far better being paired up with Sealab 2021 and reruns of Futurama. Supposedly a new season is due out soon, and I can't wait.

Anyway, a lot of folks pan this show as being derivative of that other pillar of edgy animated family comedy, The Simpsons. Some also believe that Trey Parker and Matt Stone's excellent (if slightly overrated) South Park is more creative and edgy. Allow me to insert my ""hurumph.""

Now, while I have all the respect for Matt Groening and his now-classic show, let's be honest: The past few seasons of The Simpsons have been lacking, being full of retreaded plots and missed opportunities for humor, not to mention the fact that it's far less subversive and clever than it used to be. After over a decade of success, there's no shame in hanging up the proverbial hat.

While Family Guy DOES borrow a couple of elements from The Simpsons, it is infinitely more funny, clever, and racy. Imagine The Simpsons with EVERY dysfunctional personality trait cranked to the max (and add some more psychosis, an alcoholic/socially sophisticated talking dog and a megalomaniacal/matricidal/sexually ambigious evil genius infant, to boot), a nonstop parade of pop culture references (some so damn obscure only a completely obsessive dweeb like me will get them), hiliarious guest voice appearances (ADAM WEST!!!!), ludicrous plot twists galore, and a sense of absurdity and gleefully offensive humor not seen since the heyday of Monty Python.

As for South Park--make no mistake, it's often a very funny, zany experience. But the truly edgy, intelligent humor of that show is too often slathered in mounds of excessive bathroom humor that while occasionally good at netting some guilty-pleasure laughs, comes off too frequently as juvenile. I mean sure, lowbrow humor can be great, but I prefer genuine WIT, and Family Guy abounds with it. It's unrelentingly smart and never panders to its audience (maybe that's one of the reasons it got canceled). Very irreverent, razor-sharp, and often black humor is what characterizes Family Guy and separates it from the majority of lame programming out there. EVERYTHING gets a proper send-up, from The Pope to Bill Clinton to Christmas specials to the Kool Aid Guy.

As far as the family itself is concerned, you know you're in for a riot when Brian, the aforementioned talking dog, is more often than not THE ONLY SANE BEING IN THE WHOLE HOUSEHOLD. And he's drunk half the time. Then you have Peter, who is like Homer with the insensitivity, cluelessness, and stupidity multiplied threefold. Chris, the equally dumb older son, with an artistic and sensitive side hidden under his inherited appreciation for bathroom jokes. Meg, the hopeless and whiny teenage outcast. Lois, the incredibly devoted wife who is equal parts oblivious and insane. And my absolute fave, Stewie...the single most quotable character in the entire show (""Damn broccoli, damn you, and DAMN THE WRIGHT BROTHERS!!""). Add some more supporting characters who are equally hiliarious (the macho wheelchair-bound police officer Joe and the total pervert sleazeball Quagmire just to name two) and you've got a show for the ages.

Also notable is the fact that Mcfarlane actually voiced a good percentage of these characters. The fact that he could provide the voice for both Stewie and Brian (two extremely different voices) is pretty remarkable in of itself. I also never knew that was Seth Green voicing Chris until I looked at the credits.

Anyway, I can't give Seasons 1 & 2 a perfect five, due to some episodes that aren't quite up to par and the fact that the satire would be honed to an even sharper edge on the show's third (and as of right now, final) season. Oh yeah, and I don't dig the packaging (extras are good though, especially the uncensored commentaries). But rest assured, it is a VERY high 4-star score. Like a 4.8, or something. Which means you should watch this. NOW.

Did I mention that Adam West is in it?",1098316800,7,4430,4.960916442048518

1825940,5,B000083C6V,"I haven't owned a television since I left home for the military back in '85.  When I got out, I just never got into the habit of watching again, as I decided that I had better things to do.  Besides, most of the TV shows that I saw at other peoples houses pretty much sucked.  Every once in a while I'd see something that tempted me, but those were few and far between.

Along came computers with DVD drives.  I do love the internet, and I now watch movies on my computer.  One of my friends loaned me this set and for the first time in years felt like I'd missed out on something.  Intelligent, biting humor with cutting edge satire, no sacred cows, obscure cultural references and a cast of characters that puts all other animated sitcoms to shame.  That's about as high a recommendation I can possibly muster.  I'm buying it and season 3 as well.",1095897600,5,849,4.322784810126582
1825941,5,B000083C6V,"Family Guy is definately the best show on TV. It shouldn't have been cancellled but I'm glad that it's coming back. This boxset is a must-have for fans of the show. I have watched all of the episodes multiple times and they are still funny. My personal favorites are:

""Death Has A shadow,""

""E. Peterbus Unim,""

and ""Love Thy Trophy.""",1095724800,3,335,4.55
1825942,4,B000083C6V,"""It seems today that all you see is violence in movies and sex on t.v.,"" especially on Family Guy.  It was one of the most extreme television shows in sexual perversion, overt racism, and sacrilege to be allowed to air on prime time.  Only an animated series on Fox could get away with its irreverence.  It took me a while to muster the courage to buy this DVD set.  Occasionally stumbling upon the program in syndication whetted my appetite for its twisted humor.  The Rhode Island-based Griffin family is the Simpsons from Hell (or, at least, gone insane) with a talking alcoholic dog, a Machiavellian baby whose ambition is to kill his own doting mother, and an oversexed neighbor who's professed greatest achievement is the number of healthy women to whom he's given VD (no Ned Flanders here).  Peter Griffin makes Homer Simpson seem almost stable.  The one constant between the two shows is the devoted wife and mother whose unconditional love for her family is baffling.  Lois loves her fat, obnoxious, male chauvinistic, perverted oaf and, no matter how mad he often makes her, she ends each episode very happy to be his wife (go figure).

If you liked this show during its original broadcasts or are intrigued by the syndicated reruns, this DVD set is really worth the money.  It includes all 28 episodes from the first two seasons on 4 discs and has a handful of commentaries, a behind-the-scenes featurette, and Internet promo spots as bonus features.  The packaging is also nice with a summary and scene shot for each episode on the back of each case.  It is nice to see these episodes released on DVD so quickly (unlike the Simpsons).  The menu pages are also very easy to navigate.  Commentaries and captions are easy to turn on and off unlike other DVDs I have where they seem to turn on out of nowhere (i.e. King of the Hill).  I've knocked off a star because, like late seasons of the Simpsons, many of the jokes are over-the-top and drag on way past the point where the viewer yells at the t.v., ""I get it already!""  The Broadway musical element sometimes added to the shows can be distracting although the lyrics, like the rest of the show, are deliciously warped.  And that wicked baby Stewie makes the show.  He has some of the best lines ever (""this is so good it just has to be fattening"").  I recommend Family Guy to any fans of animated series like The Simpsons, King of the Hill, South Park, or Futurama who are open-minded and do not mind humor that is not quite so wholesome.",1095724800,6,2502,4.594594594594595
1825943,5,B000083C6V,In 1999 creater Seth Mcfarlane created one of the funniest animation shows ever. Family Guy is about loving family that lives in Rhode Island. The father named Peter is a loving dad who is always jolly and always does something hilarious and over the top everytime he is on the screen. The mother's name is Lois and works at home raising her 3 children while also being a great wife to Peter. Their son Chris is a 13 year old who is not that smart but brings laughs everytime he is on the show. Their daughter Meg is the odd one out in the family. She doesn't have many friends and just wants to fit in with he crowd. Their other son Stewie is a 1 year older toddler who is bent on world domination and highly inteligent and is also always trying to kill his mother. Their pet's name is Brian. Brian is a talking dog that is very sacastic and  is always drinking martinis. This show is very funny. You will be laughing for hours. Peter is very entertaining to watch. He is way funnier than Homer Simpson. If you love comedy and just want to laugh then this is the DVD to buy. You will love every second of this show.,1095379200,3,1116,4.214953271028038
1825944,5,B000083C6V,"The Griffins, what can I say.  They are all freakin demented.  Peter, Lois, Meg, Chris, Stewie, and Brian are all escapees from a mental asylum, and are all hilarious.  The first season was good, and rife with plenty of jokes and wrong humor-( ex Scooby Doo meets CSI, Sesame Street meets NYPD Blue, and other other sick homages from Seth McFarlane).  Peter is the stupidist, but the funniest character.  Lois is good as the housewife with a wild streak.  But the best is Stewie, the maniacal 1 year old who considers himself free of his mom- Ovarian Bastille.  The Griffins are at their best being chased by Death, PEter going to sensitivity training/trying to breast feed Stewie himself, and of course dealing with Chris and Meg's issues.  Brian is good as the alcoholic but sharp tongued and strangely intellectual family pet.  The Family Guy is well worth the price.  Watch the old unedited versions as long as you can. Since Fox is returning them to TV, they may water down the Griffins.  I have to give McFarlane kudos for being warped and twisted enough to place Adam West (TV's Batman, as Mayor Adam West of the Griffins' hometown of Quahog, RI.)  Although one unsettling thing is this- why the crap is Peter naked every other episode?  Or in a thong?  Ugh, what's next Michael Moore nude photos?  Jeeeez.

His adoring wife Lois is incredibly tolerant of Peter's stupidity and controlling way of life. Peter and Lois' children, Meg, Chris and Stewie are incredibly entertaining. My personal favorite is the World Domination bent Stewie. He is hilarious and is always trying to come up with new tactics to kill Lois. This show ROCKS.

1825947,5,B000083C6V,"As you can probably tell, I'm not too good at coming up with titles for my reviews. Anyway, Family Guy ranks among the greatest television shows ever produced. I have loved the show for a very long time, and used to watch it when it was on Fox (and will again once it comes back) which was when I was in 4th and 5th grade (I'm an 8th grader now). Even though I didn't get almost all of the show's references (the few I got were ones aimed at things any 4/5th grader should know as well as the All in the Family and Jeffersons references), but I still loved the show. I guess I must've understood half of the jokes. Not most of the references, and not ones involving stuff I shouldn't have known back then. Anyway, I loved the show, and it was horrible to see it leave. I can't even describe the rush of excitement and joy I felt when I heard that opening song for the first time in almost two years (on Adult Swim). Two years that had gone by with no way for me to see the show. Oh, it was great. The episode I saw is one of the best episodes of the show, ""I Am Peter, Hear Me Roar."" I can't wait for the new season, which MacFarlain describes as ""Bigger than Jesus.""
Anyway, Family Guy accomplishes what most shows cannot. Multiple laughs per a minute. I guarantee that in only fifty episodes you'll laugh almost as many times as you will watching every episode of South Park (slight Exaggeration there). Most of Family Guy's jokes are when a character references something that happened to them in the past, and then we see a short flashback that ends up being hilarious. The bad thing about this, though, is when you're watching other shows and they reference something that happened to them in the past, you expect them to jump to a flashback and they disappointingly do not.
Anyway, Family Guy is a hilarious, brilliant show and this set contains the first 2 seasons (28 episodes: Season 1-7 episodes-Season 2-21 episodes), hitting its stride during the second season. Please enjoy this 4-disc set. I know I did.",1093478400,2,2017,4.39572192513369

1825951,5,B000083C6V,"Family Guy must be the single greatest animated comedy show ever made. There is not one episode that is not funny.

  The creator, Seth McFarlane, is a genius. His humor is witty and he makes use of every scene to bring out laughs. He has a unique style in his writing that incorporates flash back sequences. This tactic gives him the opportunity to put in hilarious (and often ridiculous) scenes into the show without disturbing the flow.

  The characters follow the basic formula for a sitcom family. Peter is the fat, stupid father. Lois is the smart, sexy wife. Chris is basically his father with an adolescent twist. Meg is the daughter that is desperate for attention. These characters alone are enough for a hit show, but McFarlane adds a few twists. He includes a cultured and facetious dog and a one year-old boy that is bent upon world domination; that is after he kills his mother, Lois, first. Each character is guaranteed to make you laugh and those are only the primary characters. The secondary characters (for example, the sex obsessed friend of Peter's, Quagmire) are pure gold.

  One thing that is found in the Family Guy series that is not found in many other comedy cartoons is the quality of animation. Don't get me wrong, the animation does not look anywhere close to realistic, and I am not advocating that it is. I am saying that the animation plays a role in the comedy. It is entertaining watching the look on Lois's face when Peter tells her something crazy.

  It is a shame that the show was cancelled, but there is news that every Family Guy fan should hear. Since Family Guy started to air on Cartoon Network, it has gotten better ratings than Jay Lenno and David Letterman for the 11:30 time slot in the 18 to 35 demographic, which is the most valuable demographic by the way; and the DVD sales have grossed more than they could have ever hoped for. As a result, Fox is bringing it back on the air sometime in the beginning of 2005. The will also be sporting an unheard of 15 writers to be on their team. Not only that, but Seth McFarlane is also creating a new show that will be on Fox later this year. Spread the news. Not all TV shows have gone to the dumps. Salvation is on its way.",1092009600,9,2220,4.467821782178218

Not so much for the language remarks, but other hidden symbols that you may not pick-up the first time you see an episode, that is why you must buy the set.

  I would have loved to see Family Guy go for at least five seasons so Seth could show his true span of genius.  Aside from that, many people say, ""Oh, I don't want to watch that show because it is just stupid toliet humor and dirty jokes.""  Well, partly yes, but when isn't a dirty joke funny?  I find this show funnier that the Simpsons, for instance, because it uses more references towards others incuding celebrities, politicians, and actions that many of us do day by day.

There are currently two volumes out, but this is the best to start off with.  Whereas the 3rd season set has 21 episodes, this first set gives you the 7 extra episodes from their short first season.  So- same price, more episodes.
That being said, this set is hilarious in every aspect.  I could spend pages of text describing individual bits of hilarity from each scene of each episode, but that would just be mundane and unneeded.  The humor ranges all over the spectrum, and some of it isn't quite suitable for younger children (if they see it, just hope they don't understand the sexual innuendo).  The commentary is funny as well, although it is only for occasional episodes in the set.  They also did an interesting thing with the commentary- it is actually rated R.  There is a warning saying that the commentary is not suitable for people under the age of 18, since they made the decision to allow profanity for the commentary.
This does not bother me, but some people may be more sensitive to those kinds of things.  But if that offends you, I doubt that you'd appreciate Family Guy's humor.  The show is like a combination of The Simpsons' family based wry humor with South Park's outrageous lack of inhibitions.  All in all, it equates into hours of laughter.
This DVD set is simply hilarious, as has been stated repeatedly.  If you've ever seen an episode of the show, you'd realize that.  If you like to laugh (and don't mind the occasional ""did they just say that!?"" moment), buy this DVD.",1089504000,2,1621,4.567474048442906

There ARE a few jokes that are completely taken from the simpsons, best example:
The Simpsons:
When homer tells Chief Wigem about the aliens (I think) and he just says ""Suuuure, ill just type it up on my invisible typewriter"" then another guy comes and says ""I just torched a building and im afraid to do it again!"" and the Chief once again says ""Suuuure, ill just type it up on my invisible typewriter!""

When South Park and the Simpsons became subjects of controversy, patrons of the shows theorized that it was unfair to criticize because the shows were ""equal opportunity offenders."" Well, I beg to differ. Family Guy is the ONLY series I have ever watched that was made in America that was equal opportunity: FG made fun of all the taboo subjects - Protestantism, liberals, pop-culture tv, the whole nine yards. Highly recommended. And this from a white, heterosexual, Catholic male.
P.S. - I know Stewie was genius, but I'm sorry to say that Brian remains my favorite character... his lines were hilarious.

Obviously these people have never heard of a parody. Although somewhat similar family guy is nuch different. How can people connect stewy and maggie?!?!? One of my favorite aspects of the show are the hilarious flashbacks. One of my favorites is the one where peter does a flashback to a free tibet rally and calls china to inform them that he has taken their ""free tibet"" and he wants all the tea too give it back. Although i consider the simpsons one of the best shows ever and the earlier seasons are absolute classics, in recent years it has gone downhill and the humor is  somewhat cheesy. I hope that the rumors are true and that family guy will be back for a new season in January 2005. Although i find the Simpsons a great show, especially seasons 9 and below and i think it has very funny social commentary it is not nearly as funny as family guy. Family guy is the kind of show that if you are eating something while watching it you're either going to choke or have it coming out of your nose. This is a great show and i think that if south park has been able to gain acceptance this show should be given a chance too. If fox would only give family guy a chance and present it to a wider audience than its cult following it has a chance to become a very successful show.

The jokes come fast and furious, and the guest stars are as hilarious as they are surprising (Ed McMahon?!?!?).
Now the bad news: Some cowardly poopyheads have deleted at least one scene from the original broadcast (the airport security/Osama Bin Laden one) and possibly another: does anyone remember a scene (possibly a dream sequence) where Peter suddenly finds himself on a plane full of useless celebrities and runs into the cockpit to try to crash the plane?  This scene does not appear to be on either set.
The commentaries (about one every three or four episodes) are also pretty worthless.  Though they have their moments, such as pointing out instances where there are continuity errors, the commentaries usually A) lapse into silence as the creators watch the episode and occasionally laugh at a particularly funny joke, B) veer off into subjects totally unrelated to the episode, or C) provide uninspired info like ""This part used to be something different"" or ""This was less offensive than what we had originally wrote.""

Stewie- my personal favorite. he always tries to take over the world, but fails. he also hates his mother and talks about killing her constantly. The best things he says are Blast! and Damn You!
Chris- Chris is the retard of the family, which makes him very, very funny. My favorite line from him is when he sticks a an army man up his nose to tickle his brain and says ""Now I don't know math.""
Peter- Peter is alot like Homer in that he has no common sense and does whatever he likes. my favorite line is when he wets himself (in the third season, last episode) and don't forget he is grown man and says ""Uh Oh!""
Brian- Brian is a talking, alcoholic dog. Now where else would you find that? My favorite line is ""How about a little less questions, and a little more shut the hell up?!""
Lois- Peter's wife, and see really is just like marge. No favorite lines.
Meg- Meg is really nothing special, she is definitly the Lisa of the family. No favorite lines, but it is funny when the rest of the family makes fun of her uglyness.

Brian, the talking dog, seems to provide balance, despite being an alcoholic and recovering cocaine addict. Then of course there is Peter, the dad, who is your stereotypical stupid father and would be strongly compared to Homer Simpson on his worst days.
This is perhaps the funniest two and a half seasons of a show that has ever been. However, with this collection you only get the first and second seasons. Adam West as the mayor is a great touch too.

The extras are not great. The commentary is terrible and a waste of time to listen to, because they don't say anything particularly funny. The promos are okay, but I saw them back in 98-99. The behind the scenes featurette is pretty good, even if it is rather short.

First of all, the cast and premise are shamelessly lifted from the Simpsons. Its almost pathetic, a fat dopey dad, a nagging wife, a brother sister and a baby...where have I seen that in cartoon form before? The majority of the plots are just pretext for Peter's stupid mugging and most of the jokes either fall flat, make no sense, or get a couple of cheap laughs. The show tries to ""push the envelope"" but it just comes out boring. The episodes usually contain some totally inane cut scene that has nothing to do with anything other than trying to get a few more laughs out of the morons who thing MTV is substantive. People who watch this show and think it's coherent need to turn off the TV and read an actual book with an actual plot. That being said, Stewie is the shows only saving grace, since he is the only character who is not either a total retread of something we have already seen 100 times or a cardboard cutout. His espisodes are actually clever since they don't focus on Peter falling down, getting drunk or farting. If you want a show with clever jokes, watch The Simpsons. If you want a show that has a semblence of a plot or an attempt at an actual message, watch South Park.

I do take issue, however, with the smug, uninformed comments of those few  morons who referred to the show as a ""cheap Simpsons ripoff"".  In its never ending quest for laughs Family Guy has in several episodes boldly rushed in where The Simpsons feared to tread.  Cartoons, much like sitcoms, have borrowed comedic premises quite liberally over the years.  The Simpsons, in fact, borrowed a few things from The Flintstones.  So as far as I'm concerned calling any program a cheap ripoff of some other show shows shallowness and lack of intelligence.  That said, I have two major problems with the Volume 1 DVD collection of Family Guy.  First, the picture quality is downright awful on some episodes.  In certain scenes some of the characters are completely devoid of fleshtones and the outline definitions are fuzzy.  At least one other reviewer commented on this being the result of some sort of encoding issue.  While not enough to keep me from purchasing the collection this oversight is unforgiveable given the technology.  The other problem I have is the audio commentary by creator Seth McFarlane and certain members of the cast and production staff, which is only featured on selected episodes.  I would like to have had more commentary regarding the development of certain characters, particularly Brian and Stewie.  I can live with what's there, but in terms of giving the viewer a glimpse into the creative process this DVD set unfortunately didn't live up to its potential.

1825993,5,B000083C6V,"Above all else, FAMILY GUY is a funny, funny show.  I almost always watch TV, DVDs, or video when I eat my meals, but I have discovered that it isn't entirely safe to do so while watching this show.  It is funny to a degree that simply isn't compatible with eating food.  What is amazing about the show is that while on one level it will strike just about any viewer as a semi-ripoff of THE SIMPSONS (just check all the SIMPSONS references in other reviews--it is almost impossible not to compare the two), it nonetheless manages to come across as remarkably fresh and--paradoxically--underivative.
Although the show uses a number of voiceover artists, the majority of the voices are supplied by only two actors:  Seth MacFarlane and Alex Borstein (who will be familiar to fans of MADTV).  It isn't fair to say that MacFarlane is the Matt Groening of FAMILY GUY, since Groening does so much less in the SIMPSONS.  MacFarlane is the creator of the show, voices most of the male characters, and is one of the main writers.  Alex Borstein voices most of the female characters and is also a writer.
FAMILY GUY is THE SIMPSONS on speed and with a bawdy streak.  Like the Simpsons, the show recreates a small town and introduces a host of characters.  Like most people, my two favorites are Stewie, the one-year old evil super genius who also doubles as the youngest Griffin, and Brian, the talking family dog, who is also exceptionally literate and an alcoholic.  Unlike THE SIMPSONS, where Lisa and (usually) Marge are voices of reason, absolutely no one on FAMILY GUY really has their stuff together.  Brian, Meg, and Lois are relatively sane, but all can exhibit bizarre behavior at key times.  Brian can serve as the voice of reason, but his drinking problem can get out of control at inopportune times.
This show is absolutely NOT for the children.  There is a huge amount of sexual humor, frequent references to genitalia, and the next-door neighbor is a sexual predator.  The show was designed with a late nighttime slot in mind, and it shows.  Much of the humor is scatological, and there really are no sacred subjects.  To be honest, when the show goes off color, I generally find it to be less funny than in the more primetime moments.  Much of the humor becomes ritualistic (a detractor might say formulaic).  For instance, whenever any character uses the phrase ""like the time"" you know you about about to get a flashback.  Transitions can be rapid, unexpected, and exceedingly weird.  And unlike THE SIMPSONS, when they introduce a song, it is almost always exceedingly funny.

  1) It's true: the DVDs are poorly packaged (however decently boxed) and don't look like they even have a disc in them.
  2) These episodes contain many unnecessary and continuous flashbacks, that, although they're still funny (o.k., hilarious), they get old really really quick and they soon start to become obnoxious.

  2) THE MOCKS, RIP-OFFS AND SARCASM! (BILL CLINTON, NEWS, ASIANS, MEXICANS, EUROPEANS, FRENCH, JAPANESE, CHINESE, AMERICANS, BLACKS, WHITES, REDNECKS, AND COUPON-SELLING CHICKENS)
  3) THE JOKES
  4) THE VOICES- EACH CHRACTERS VOICE GOES PERFECTLY WITH ITS OWNER.
  5) The SHOW- EVEN IF YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN AN EPISODE, YOU'RE SURE TO LOVE IT- UNLESS IF YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO JUDGE A SHOW BY HOW RUDE IT IS AND HATE IT BECAUSE OF THAT.
  I watched these 4 discs over 2 nights (2 discs per night) and was absolutely breathless and hurting from laughing so hard (BELIEVE ME!) and this is one of those DVD's that will be absolutely timeless for decades to come.

When I watched the show, I discovered it's not good - it's GREAT! And Stewie? Well, he & Brian are my two favorites. I love the way they play off each other. Which may be why ""Road to Rhode Island"" is my favorite episode. (Like a masochist in Newport, we're Rhode Island bound! Classic!)
 Two quibbles. I am so bummed that they cut out the scene where Stewie smuggles weapons past airport security and says ""Let's hope Osama bin Laden doesn't know show tunes."" What a gyp! I haven't made it to the very end yet, so maybe it's in the deleted scenes. I hope! That bit was hilarious! If not, well, I have my memories.
 The other quibble is with people that do write ups with no apparent sense of what they are talking about. In the description of ""Mind Over Murder"" it says that Meg becomes an acclaimed lounge singer. Hello? On the planet Reality it's LOIS that becomes the lounge singer.
 Gentle griping aside, the Family Guy is the best thing to hit television since, well, since nothing. It is THE best thing - bar none.
 My husband and I look forward to many, many hours of side-splitting hilarity with our Family Guy dvd set. If you have a decent sense of humor & are not easily offended, it's worth a peek! Try it, you'll like it!

Family Guy's humor is very random and off-the-wall, so I don't expect everyone to like it, but saying that you hate this show because it's a ""Simpsons rip-off"" is completely stupid. First off, Family Guy is funnier than Simpsons could ever be. And secondly, Family Guy only has one or two similarities to The Simpsons, so I'd hardly call it a ripoff.

They are a wonderful take on Family life.  They are hilarious and even on replays I still find them equally funny if not more so.  Each character has their own way of making me laugh, but I must admit Peter's spouting off at the mouth without thinking is the funniest.

Bart, Homer and the gang - who preceded 'Family Guy' by, what...an entire decade? - relish their angst and humor, and the daily family beatings, and that is what has made them a special, welcome sight on our TVs. But this 'Family Guy'...now, here's something that will actually make you laugh!
Banished to late nights, and ultimately, to Adult Swim on Cartoon Network and released onto their own DVD, 'Family Guy' is a step bolder, a step farther, a step into 'Simpson'-free laughter, where the dog drinks but never chases a cat, there is no 'sideshow' to rely on for an occasional laugh, and the flashes to alternate realities are actually funny. Peter Griffan really loves his kids (except for the daughter, whose name he seldom remembers), and there is a bond through them, through all the troubles and problems they face, that makes this defiant, daring show a real treat to watch.
Compare it to the 'Simpsons?' *Please!* Itchy and Scratchy are the only funny things on that show, who, despite this, will never hold their own with a spin-off. 'Family Guy' may be forgotten before the Simpsons, but that is their punishment for taking their humor to this new, daring, truly amusing level.",1071532800,,1321,4.954954954954955
1826016,5,B000083C6V,"Back when I was in high school a cartoon show starring a fat man and a baby shaped like a football debuted after the Super Bowl (I believe it was Rams vs Falcons).
I didn't find it all that funny at the time and watched a few episodes here and there for the next couple of years.  Then it was canceled.  I didn't miss it all that much because I wasn't really hooked on it.
But then my roommate got the whole DVD set.  Then when I started watching the episodes I couldn't stop laughing.  It was so good that we breezed through all the episodes in about 2 weeks and wanted more.  Unfortunately, thanks to Peter Chernin and FOX-TV it was cancelled.  I don't believe it was due to ratings (because King of the Hill gets horrible ratings and it's still on) but more because of its crude humor that offended the conservative television viewers.
Anyways, after the Simpsons I believe Family Guy was the best animated cartoon series ever made.  It is funny, and not in the way you would expect.

I believe Family Guy has the potential to surpass The Simpsons, both in popularity and funny-ness. I mean, if people stop being so touchy about racial jokes and all that stuff that got some episodes banned, and give it a real chance for several seasons, they will see the true value of this show.
First of all, just the fact that it has so many references to pop culture is a good enough reason to play it over and over. You don't get all the jokes the first time you watch it, either because you miss the joke while laughing at the previous one, or that you don't know the commercial, movie, event, etc. that the joke is referring to and you don't get it.
Second of all, the jokes are beyond hilarious. I can't find the right word for it. I get belly cramps after every show from laughing so hard. Even though the USA is so touchy about racial, religious, and ethnic jokes, it's impossible to laugh at these! For instance, here's a dialogue (the way I remember it).
Reporter: Now we turn to Ali for the blackie weather forecast. What can you tell us, Ali?
Ali: It's gonna rain!
Reporter: Thank you Ali.
Or that one episode where Peter converts to Jewism so that his son is more successful in school (the episode got banned).

Peter, Meg, Chris, Lois, Stewie & Brian are without a doubt the most dysfunctional family since the Bundys.  Sure the Simpsons might have more notoriety, but Family Guy blows that away.
What makes it so funny?  The funniest part of the show without a doubt are the flashbacks...for example, Brian and Peter discussing the hardest time they had together when Peter started his own country...they flashback to the 2 of them on a ferris wheel with Peter lit completely on fire.  Did it make much sense?  No.  Was it comic gold?  Absolutely!
Stewie steals several shows as the maniac baby who wants to kill his mother.  Brian, the extremely intelligent alcoholic dog, is a new breed altogether for family pets.  And Lois is probably the only TV Mom in recent history to produce nearly as many laughs as the other family members (Meg and Chris have their moments, but are just background more or less).

The show is a witty and darkly hilarious look at our society, and fans of the show (which really should be anyone with a couple of brain cells or more) should definitely pick up this terrific set.
I'll pitch in a word about the DVD itself.
The show is presented in its original 1.33:1 full-frame aspect ratio. The picture quality is good, although there's the occasional issue with jagged lines that occasionally appear on the earlier episodes (an issue with the animation itself?) The picture does offer the show's bright color palette though, vivid and well-saturated throughout. No instances of edge enhancement or pixelation appeared, as do on some of The Simpsons DVDs.
The sountrack is Dolby 2.0 and my copy has subtitles in English, French and Spanish. The show's dialogue remains crisp and forward throughout, with the surround sound providing some reinforcement for music and occasional sound effects. Audio quality is superb, as sound effects remained clear (and occasionally punchy) throughout.
Plus, the extras are great. Creator Seth McFarlane and various members of the cast and crew provide commentaries, there are over 20 deleted ""scenes"" provided in animatic (moving storyboards) form, the original pilot pitch (a rough, shortened version of the pilot episode), a 7-minute featurette on how the show pushed the envelope across its three seasons and a 17-minute documentary that takes a look at the overall series, from development to characters the voice talent.
If you want to own a fab show, get these couple of seasons. The DVD is worth every penny and probably a little better than the 3rd season.",1065916800,3,1727,5.106007067137809

I immediately got ahold of the first season of ""Family Guy,"" and ran across a rather sad realization about the show: people, it's funny at times, but it's not all it's cracked up to be. ""Family Guy"" is often brilliant in the way that it comments on political and popular issues, and occasionally hilarious when it's REALLY irreverent (a foul-mouthed Big Bird that berates Chris Griffin comes to mind). The big problem with ""Family Guy"" - it can't survive on its own momentum and finish an episode. I find that most of the ""Family Guy"" episodes 'last' with me for about 10 or 12 minutes AT MOST, and then the episode falls stale and none of the gags work anymore. ""Family Guy"" is an obvious spawn of the ultimate of all animated shows, ""The Simpsons."" Thank God, ""The Simpsons"" doesn't have anything to worry about. ""Family Guy"" lets most of its show coast on Simpsons-esque flashbacks, and YES, they're usually funny and often a riot. Sadly, ""Family Guy,"" despite its occasional spot-on irreverence, can only rely on those flashbacks and outrageous humor and can't actually carry a plot to the end. Some people find ""Family Guy"" to be one of the most brilliant and hilarious shows of all time. Some moments attest to that, I'll admit. There have been times I've been in stitches over certain moments on the show. Then again, most of those can't really save the fact that the humor of ""Family Guy"" can only carry it so far. After a while, it becomes obvious that shock-humor and flashbacks are just about the only things going for it. Sorry, but I'll take ""The Simpsons"" over that.",1065398400,7,1918,4.677514792899408
1826058,5,B000083C6V,"I wonder if getting cancelled was the best thing that could have happened to the Family Guy, Fox's brilliant animated series. The fact is that the Family Guy wasn't cancelled for lack of interest or ratings problems - it was cancelled for being too edgy and the humor maybe too (gulp) sophisticated for the average television viewer tuning in to watch two strangers get married or to see a person eat a bug.
You will find esoteric references to popular 70's and 80's television commercials and sitcoms (the Kool Aid guy busting through the wall is my personal favorite) as well as irreverent digs on everyone from the Make a Wish Foundation to the Pope.
If you've seen the show or even just heard about it, buy both volumes. You'll get addicted and annoy your friends and family by trying to reenact the plotlines while doing a poor New Englander dialect. If you're an ardent fan, then definitely buy it. Several episodes have commentaries by Seth Macfarlane, Seth Green, and various writers giving insight into the show on every level.

They live in Quahog, Rhode Island, and seem to often know they are a sitcom family, even if the situations they get into are usually more outrageous than most.

1826062,5,B000083C6V,"Let me start my review off wih some good news:  Seth MacFarlane revealed in an interview with Cinescape.com that he is hashing out a budget with FOX to create more Family Guy episodes (on tv or dvd, I don't know) and a feature length movie (direct-to-dvd).  The projects should take bewteen a year and a year and a half.  Now before I decided to write my review on this great show I decided to read the 1 and 2 star reviews (at this time a combined 12) and the 4 and 5 star reviews (at this time a combined 311, mine not included) and alot of the 1 and 2's had kept saying that this show is just a blatant rip off of The Simpsons.  Well I'm sorry to tell you this 1 and 2's but it's not.  Family Guy is better.  Now don't get me wrong, I love the Simpsons, I remember watching their first episodes when they were airing on Thursdays I believe.  But after about 13 years the show can get a little stale.  This will eventually happen to King of the Hill, Futurama and of course Family Guy.  But since Family Guy is the new baby in the house maybe it's about time for the Simpsons to bow out gracfully and pass down the torch.  Now alot of the 1 and 2's said that the members of both families were exactly the same but this is not true.  And I'll prove it to you by playing Simpsons vs. Griffins.  I will take the same member of each family (mom vs. mom, dad vs. dad) and I will compare them.  We start off with Homer vs. Peter: Same height, same colored hair (if Homer still had his) but Peter is fatter.  Now one worked at a toy company making sure they were safe to play with.  The other works as a safty inspector at a power plant.  Different jobs, same responibility.  But while Homer learns from his mistakes, alot of the time Peter learns nothing, like in the episode ""He's too sexy for his fat"".  But in the end: Homer and Peter might have been long lost brothers.  Marge vs. Lois: Lois is around 5'2"", Marge is around 7'5""-8' (with hair).  Both are house wives.  One became a flight attendent for a while and ones father was a flight attendent.  Lois was born rich, Marge was born just below middle class.  Marge and Homer like to do it in public.  Lois and Peter do it with whips, chains, leather, and Peter dressing up like the Gimp in Pulp Fiction.  In the end: Both are kinky and at times can be as bad as there husbands.  Now when it comes to the parents it's almost identical but the kids aren't alright.  Take Bart vs. Chris:  Both have blond hair, but that's all.  Bart is a little chunky, Chris is just fat.  Bart is a smooth talker that can get himself out of almost any problem.  Chris is kind of an idiot and might be ""special"".  Bart rides a skateboard. Chris can barely walk staight.  Bart fears almost nothing.  Chris is afraid of the evil monkey in his closest.  Sorry but in the end:  They maybe two Jacks but their of a differnt suit.  NO MATCH.  Lisa vs. Meg:  Lisa and Meg are both whiners but Lisa whines about social issues, Meg whines about her social life and not having the things her friends have.  Lisa is basicly an intellectual loner that doesn't really care what others think about her, all Meg ever cares about is what poeple think about her.  In the end:  One is a political and environmental activist, the other is just a brat (of course to some people that's two of the same thing).  NO MATCH.  Maggie vs. Stewie:  You can't get more opposite then this.  Both are the same age but most of the time Maggie acts her age.  Stewie acts like a gay, british Lex Luther hell-bent on taking over the world and getting rid of his mother once and for all.  Maggie loves her mommy and her bo-bo (pacifier).  Stewie talks eloquently and creates weapons and devices for world domination.  Maggie creates drool and the only word I ever heard her say was daddy.  In the end: they may be a pair quarters, but ones facing heads and the others facing tails.  NO MATCH.  When I said you couldn't get more opposite then Maggie vs. Stewie I was wrong beacuse I forgot about Santas Little Helper vs. Brian:  S.L.H. eats dog food, drinks water out of his bowl, barks when he wants too and is basicly a stupid dog (stupid as in not smart not stupid as in he sucks).  Brian eats whatever the Griffins are having for dinner while sitting at the dinner table.  He drinks martinis, gin and tonics, jack and cokes, and other forms of alcohol.  He speaks, not like when you ask a dog to speak but he talks like a person (english and bad spanish).  He is almost always out-smarting Stewie so he is very intelligent.  In the end:  Sorry but S.L.H. isn't fit to be near Brians martini glass.  NO MATCH.  The neighbors are different as well.  The Simpsons have Flanders (extremely religous guy), Reverend Lovejoy (not as religous as Flanders) and an old couple.  The Griffins have Cleavland (smart black guy), Joe (suped-up cop in a wheelchair) and Quagmire (sex-crazed weirdo).  On the political side you have Mayor Quimby and Mayor Adam West (yes, Batman).  One is an embezzler (never proven of course) and the other is insane (proven everytime you see him).  Some people say that Family Guy is sexist, racist, misogynistic and a little bit anti-semitic but that's what makes it funny.  Its political incorrectness is what gives it its edge. Take away the edge and then your ripping off The Simpsons.",1063929600,12,5308,4.353421859039837

In the world of Family Guy it all makes perfect sense, as does Brain,  a talking alchoholic dog with many existential issues and a wicked sarcasm.  This show had a ton of talent behind it, both in the writing and the voice-overs.  Unfortunately, they got a little to bawdy and un-PC for network TV and we must be satisfied with three short seasons of brilliance that will never be duplicated.  This show is totally unique and so chock full of gags and one-liners that you will watch it over and over.  The animation is hilarious too.",1063670400,,660,4.745614035087719
1826084,5,B000083C6V,"Family Guy is the funniest show ever made. Period. This is a show that while maybe infantile and crude was firing on all cylinders at all times and never ceased to be hilarious. Every character from any sitcom ever made from Ralph Kramdan to George Jefferson to Jack Tripper to Homer Simpson to Eric Cartman is represented here in some way, shape or form...only with the volume turned up way past ten.
Everyone and their grandmother was ready to jump all over Family Guy from the moment the first commercial aired with the inevitable ""Simpsons-rip off"" comments in tow. However, NO ONE expected the barnburner of a show that they received when Tom Tucker stated upon Quohog's TV tower on the fritz ""I'm gonna go get drunk and beat up some midgets."" followed by his co-anchor Diane stating ""And I just plain don't like black people."". Where the Simpsons took its time and built it's momentum, Family Guy jumped out from the start with racy humor that was offensive, brutal, outlandishly strange and most of all, absolutely hysterical. Family Guy pulled no punches, left no stone unturned and left you in tears with it's uncanny pop culture references that seemingly came out of nowhere and left me with trouble breathing and a bright red face from uncontrollable laughter.
Despite Fox's idiotic cancellation of Family Guy, the DVD's are a welcome addition to planet Earth. I can only guess that Fox is kicking themselves daily for letting this show go out the window the way that they did, only to replace such an amazing show with idiotic dramas like the OC and brain-numbing reality TV. No thank you, I'll take Family Guy on DVD and continue laughing.",1063670400,,1652,4.77972027972028
1826085,5,B000083C6V,"I have not yet bought this DVD, but I have seen a whole bunch of the episodes.  Just like The Simpsons and South Park, two of the funniest shows ever, it has funny characters and hillarious plots. Seth McFaine can make any situation seem funny, and unlike The Simpsons and South Park, every scene in the episode has something hillarious.  I think this is one of the best shows Fox has aired and since they took it off Fox, I am now watching it every night on Adult Swim on Cartoon Network.
  The characters are just one reason that this cartoon is one of the best out there.  There is Peter Griffin, the beefy, borderline alchoholic, dumb father and husband,  Meg Griffin, the drama queen daughter of Peter, who seems like Peter's least favorite of them all, Chris, the second image of Peter,  Stewie, the talking, evil, baby genious who wants to enslave the human race and kill Peter's wife, Lois, who is the most normal of the Griffin family.  And we can not forget Brian, the articulate talking dog.
  This show is one of my favorites, and one of the most random comedy shows of them all. (That's what makes it so funny)  Let me just tell you one thing, if you know how to laugh, you'll love this show.",1063152000,7,1205,4.407239819004525
1826086,2,B000083C6V,"The Family Guy has to be one of the most blatant TV shows to come down the line that rips off The Simpson. Aside from the Dog, it almost a character-for-character rip off of that classic series. The ""hook"" for this series was supposed to be that ""The Family Guy"" would push buttons that ""The Simpsons"" could only dream about, and they succeded at it. However, while ""The Simpsons'"" wit and great writing have prevented the characters (for the most part) from devolving into stereotypes; ""The Family Guy"" desperately tried to be more shocking with each episode and eventually collapsed under the weight of its own hype. In addition, simply because a show ""pushes buttons"" doesn't automatically make it funny. The true redeeming value of the Simpsons (and more recently South Park) is that the shows make you think and have dynamic characters that the viewer actually cares about while either dancing (or sometimes trampling) on ""the line"" of what's socially acceptable. ""The Family Guy,"" while containing some genuinely funny moments, simply could not compete with either the Simpsons or South Park. The deathblow to the show came with Fox's juggling of the time schedule (which ironically hurt the Simpsons ratings when they put it up against The Cosby Show in the 2nd season). However, the cult that surrounds this show still continues to be resilient online, thus resulting in the DVD's that have been recently released. My guess is that while ""The Simpsons"" will continue to age like a fine wine, ""The Family Guy"" will age like a can of Natural Light that goes flat when you open it and finally be tossed on the ash heap of history with the several other shows that were either good or ok and that were in some way or another Simpsons knock-offs (such as ""Duckman"" and ""Dinosaurs!"").",1063065600,10,1786,4.839869281045751
1826087,5,B000083C6V,"This is possibly the funniest adult cartoon series ever written. And of course, it was misunderstood, so Fox deep-sixed the show, which subsequently became a cult hit. There are only three short seasons, sadly, and Mr. Macfarlane, the evil genius behind ""Family Guy"" needs some serious wooing --come back, Seth, we want more!
The story looks oh-so-wholesomely-innocent. The opening features a song about Family Values in a Broadway vein, and the family is a classic, lives in Quahog, Rhode Island, dad, mom, son, baby and dog. But wait, isn't Rhode Island the butt of comedic jokes these days? (viz. ""Me, Myself, and Irene"" with Jim Carrey.) And as you watch this, you realize the kids REALLY should be in bed and never EVER have access to this DVD until they are well on their way to, say, graduate school. Like ""South Park"", this is not for tender ears.
The jokes come thick and fast, and the timing is exquisite. The baby with the football-shaped head, Stewie, is a cross between Bill Buckley, Cole Porter and Saddam Hussein. Stewie hates his mom, so much so, he tries all kinds of nefarious methods to kill her. The real joke is that classical psychologists theorized that babies were a kind of monomaniacal creature that feared and resented Mother, an all-powerful, utterly controlling being in their lives, able to dispense or withhold food and love. Macfarlane had apparently read some of these texts to create a really funny situation.
The neighbors and other minor characters are equally amusing and the plots are fun, with great little songs from time to time. If you liked the earlier Simpsons and the earlier ""King of the Hill"" and ""South Park"", this is all that and a lot more.",1062979200,3,1690,4.810996563573883

Comparisons to The Simpsons are inevitable, but where The Simpsons takes sharp jabs at a variety of cultural icons Family Guy beheads them with a guillotine. Many of the jokes are truly unique and no doubt horribly offensive to the sacred cows they are aimed at, but unlike many over-the-top animated series that seek laughs strictly from their ability to annoy, the satire, non-sequiturs and  insane plot-twists of Family Guy are spot-on and brilliant. Owning the DVD is especially handy for catching many of the more subtle jokes that often fly by so quickly and mixed with so many subtexts at the same time that a single viewing won't come close to mining all the gems this show has to offer. In fact, the release of this series was my own primary motivation for buying a DVD player in the first place! I'm serious, it's that good.",1062979200,2,966,4.715976331360947

The naysayers will automatically draw comparos to the Simpsons and say that its quality of comedy is no where near that of Matt Groening's long running hit animated series. Well IMO the only real similarity they have is that they're both animated and have a similar family structure. Jokes, comedy, and story wise, the two are very different. Family Guy gives you noticeably more laughs per minute than Simpsons, especially if you enjoy witty politically incorrect comedy. It relies a lot more on real pop culture whereas the Simpsons jokes are usually a little more PC and revolve around general observations about society rather than specific occurences such as Family Guy. With that having been said, I guess you COULD dislike this if you really hated vulgarity and toilet bowl humor and absolutely NOTHING could make up for it. But who can't laugh when Peter asks Lois when they ever had trouble communicating and it flashes to the two of them standing in front of a beautiful sunset hugging each other and Lois telling Peter she loves him and Peter saying ""About a quarter past 5""?

The show is hilarious and is just about as good as the Simpsons.  Peter is like Hank Hill, Homer Simpson, and Cartman combined. It has its own sense of humor and is different than the rest of the crap that is found on TV anymore.
All the characters have their unique personalities (especially Stewie) and each are funny in their own ways.  There are also a lot of cliches that show up which can't help but be laughed at.
It is truly a shame (if not a travesty) that FOX Networks took this show off the air due to the fact that so many people were offended by it.  They ought to put it back on.
Please...There is so much offensive things on TV anymore, they are hard to count.  Interesting how a reality program that has 10 people living together having sex and getting drunk finds a way to stay on the air while a great and funny show like Family Guy (in which there are two married parents and two kids with a dog-the nuclear family) is thrown off.  Amazing how the shows that set the poorest examples stay on the air.  Some sensitive people are upset about a few comments on Family Guy when all of these reality shows are so trashy and risque.
The writers of Family Guy are very clever and deserve a lot of credit for this excellent program.

1826114,4,B000083C6V,"Let me get one thing straight right off the bat: ""The Family Guy"" was one of the best animated comedies on the telly. It takes more risks at upseting the mainstream than ""The Simpsons"" but isn't so blatant in shock value as ""Southpark."" In fact, I seriously loved this series when it was on the air and I'm thrilled that now that it's available on DVD, I can watch my favorite episodes whenever I want. If you're a fan of the show, you need these DVD box sets.
However, if you want really cool added features, keep looking. Unlike the commentary for DVDs like ""The Simpsons"" it's almost as though Seth and gang have no idea what DVD commentary is for. In fact, for many of the episodes that actually DO have commentary, they sit in silence instead of actually commenting -- which kinda begs the question -- why is this called an audio commentary track when you barely comment?
Also, many of the comments really aren't that entertaining at all. Occasionally Seth M. or Seth Green will speak in their characters' voices to comment (which would have been sooo much more interesting if they continued to do so) but for the most part they just don't say much.
Highlights of the commentary do include the actress who does Lois' voice (she is damn funny).... but some of the other voice actors/actresses that are on the commentary seem to have been brought in at last minute. One of supporting voice actors even asks in geniune astonishment: ""Brian the dog has a martini?""  Which makes you kind of wonder if some of the actors even bothered watching the series they were in while it aired.
There's only one documentary (if you want to call it that) which is simply a long commercial for the show.

Now the Simpsons has gotten to be pretty bland humor. Family Guy had fresh jokes even though much of it was directly copied from the Simpsons. But Family Guy took things to the next level. Many people might be offended by jokes about Stewie egging on OJ Simpson to kill Nichole but it's not meant to be taken seriously. The star of the show really is Stewie even though most of the time the stories are about Peter. One of my favorite lines is when Peter says ""Was that supposed to be a joke? Geess..you must write for Leno."" HAHA! Very smart writing. Nothing is dumbed down unlike the Simpsons is these days.

Yes, they are both about families but no one compares every live-action sitcom about families.

The show is written brilliantly and few comedies have been written on the same level as this show. It is a must buy, I've never talked to anyone who hasn't  like the show and that's including my mother and grandmother. The show definately steps over the politcially correct liine, but the way they do it is hilarious.

1826175,5,B000083C6V,"I used to think that ""South Park"" was the funniest, most original, most offensive show on television. And then, I saw ""Family Guy"". I remember watching it when it was still on the air and thinking how refreshing it was. You'd laugh for a full 22 minutes, and most of the time you'd feel guilty about it. Why? Because it pushed the envelope, most often just a little too far, and you couldn't help but think to yourself, ""I am going to hell for laughing at this."" But that's why it was so great.
Unlike ""South Park"", ""Family Guy"" was a lot more mature. It didn't rely so much on potty humor and potty mouth, because it didn't have to. Just take, for instance, the family that we have here, the Griffins. There's Peter, the father and husband, who is a lot like Homer Simpson, only less yellow and with a bigger love for beer. He is lazy and not that bright. Then again, neither was Homer. Then there's Lois, the mother and wife who seems so normal and nice, you wonder why she's married to Peter. Then, there are the children: Chris, who is a bit chubby but kind-hearted and loves to draw; Meg who is a typical teenaged girl who wants to drive and get plastic surgery; and Stewie - the most complex character of all. He's just a little itty bitty baby, yet he speaks in an English accent, using big words, has a huge football-shaped head (probably to fit his large brain), likes to build complex machines such as time travelling ones, and - oh yeah - he wants to kill his mother. The biggest mystery about Stewie (one that's even been addressed in a couple of episodes, but never answered) is, can anyone hear him when he talks, other than the audience? The question goes unanswered, but we at least know that the family dog, Brian, hears him. Brian is another interesting character. He looks a bit like Snoopy, but that's where the similarities end. He likes to drink martinis, and he talks (he often is giving Peter sound advice - which Peter never takes). Every episode seems to find Peter trying to undo something bad that he did, but it never gets old. In fact, each of the 28 episodes are brilliant - there isn't a dud in the whole set.
I remember the feeling I had when I found out that Fox had pulled ""Family Guy"" from their line-up. It really truly was the funniest show on television at the time, and it angered me that people were claiming it was offensive. But it doesn't matter now, because all of the episodes are coming out on DVD. Even if we aren't getting any new ones, the ones on the DVD can be viewed multiple times before they even start to get boring. You don't get much for special features here - pretty much just two commentaries each on each of the four discs. But you really don't need special features with a show this good. If you ever saw at least one episode and found yourself laughing, I strongly urge you to buy this DVD. The price is great for all that you get, which is hours of pure enjoyment. I guarentee you will not be disappointed.",1058572800,3,2971,4.364620938628159
1826176,5,B000083C6V,"I don't think Fox had banked on Family Guy being the success it did when it came out in 1999. They had banked on Futurama being the hit show and Family Guy just being filler material until they decided to pull the plug and put another show with an awful concept in it's place.
Even in the beginning, Family Guy got a bad wrap of being told it was nothing but a rip off of the Simpsons. And the Simpsons, who were obviously threatened by Family Guy's success took a shot at the show placing Peter Griffin in with Homer's reject clones.
Fox obviously thought Family Guy had no chance of being a success.
But they were absolutely wrong. Family Guy was a hit and Futurama was not the success they had hoped for. But they couldn't be wrong, so they did their best to sabotage Family Guy by placing the show in various timeslots where people would not watch it because of more popular shows on other channels. Until they decided to pull the plug on Family Guy and keep Futurama, despite the fact Futurama really was not that funny.
I felt it was the Critic all over again.
But Fox's loss has proven to be Cartoon Network's gain as they are now showing all the old episodes of Family Guy. And at it's 11:30pm timeslot (incidentally right after Futurama), it's beating out both Letterman and Leno in the ratings.
And now I am very pleased to see that all of the first and second season have been released on video. With the last season to be released very soon.
If you think the first two seasons were good, Family Guy only gets better by the last season. Funnier than the Simpon's have been for the longest time.

I would highly recommend this DVD set. If you haven't seen this series as of yet, you really must watch was has to be the funniest and smartest primetime cartoon ever to be on television.",1058572800,,1884,4.37037037037037

1826178,5,B000083C6V,"Upon Family Guy's debut after the 1999 Superbowl, Fox had a hit that had sparked a major public interest. Combining elements of The Simpsons and The Critic, Family Guy is the perfect hybrid of comedic genius. While such racy shows as South Park may have hogged the spotlight, Family Guy was able to hold its own on and off for 3 seasons.
What makes this show so interesting is the style of animated comedy used. Often in the show, the characters will say something along the lines of ""you remember what happened when...,"" and a ridiculously funny flashback will show some whacky situation.  For instance, in one episode Peter, the father, recalls his Mexican relative training as a cockfighter (Peter's relative is about 8 inches tall, wearing boxing gloves, and beating up a chicken)

Family Guy was just so great words can't describe it. In watching any episode you are entitled to laugh every 20-40 seconds, seriously. In my own opinion (and I know many of you will disagree) Family Guy is greater than Simpsons and South Park. I would not recommend this to any person who is the typical family guy/girl though, or to anyone who doesnt take too kindly to racial comments or anything of that sort. Though its not as near as profane as South Park, but its still just as hilarious.
 Seth Macfarlane, the creator, is just unbelievable. If you have seen the show and know how Peter Griffen, Brain (the dog), and Stewie (the supergenius one-year-old baby) AND Quagmire (the horny next door neighbor) speak, you will be surprised to hear they are all the voice of Seth Macfarlane. It's aslo a nice neat little fact to know that Seth Green (The Italian Job, Austin Powers) is the voice of Chris Griffen, my favorite character. I love the voice that Seth Green uses for him.
All in all, this is a great collection and I recommend it to any fan of the Simpsons or South Park. The extras are weak, but opposed to what others say, I love the commentary on the few episodes its on, you will catch stuff you won't notice otherwise and they are just hilarious.

1826187,5,B000083C6V,"It's so very rare that we find a ""comedy"" on TV that sets out to make us laugh and actually acomplishes that.  It's even more difficult for a cartoon, due to the absence of a laugh track.  Of the five major and semi-major cartoon comedies (The Simpsons, Futurama, King of the Hill, South Park, Family Guy), I find Family Guy to be by and large the best.  Peter Griffin is essentially a synthesis of Hank Hill, Homer Simpson, Eric Carman, and Bender, and is funnier than any of them.
Here, in all of their glory, are the first two seasons.  From the very first joke the show ever did (which was a Brady Bunch parody followed by a pun involving Aunt Jemimah) to ""Brian: Portrait of a Dog"", every episode is priceless.
Family Guy is funny because it's so brazenly irreverent.  The show tosses political correctness out the window (which Fox was upset about regarding ""When you Wish upon a Weinstein"", which can be seen in the second DVD set later this year), taking jabs at pretty much everyone and everything.  The cutaways and quick flashbacks are the show's trademark, and they are usually funnier than the main action.  The show is also a brilliant mix of universally funny jokes to pop culture jokes of yesteryear.  Seth MacFarlane said that the show uses older culture references because if the jokes are funny now when the subjects are dated, they'll be funny twenty years from now.  This is why Family Guy never did a Titanic or Matrix parody.  You can judge a persons relative cultural awareness by how many Family Guy jokes he or she gets.  I have two favorite examples of this.  The first (I forget which episode, it may even be in the third season) is when Peter says ""While I may not agree with what you say, I will defend to the death your right to say it.""  This is a quote from Voltaire, an eighteenth century French satirist and writer.  Very few people got that joke, but for those who did, it was very funny indeed.  My other favorite culture joke is in the episode ""Brian in Love"".  Brian is driving down a country road when he hits a man.  He stops the car, runs back to the man, and goes ""Oh my God, are you Stephen King?""  ""No,"" the man replies.  ""I'm Dean Koontz.""  ""Oh,"" says Brian.  Brian then proceeds back to his car and backs it over Dean Koontz.  It has to be seen to be appreciated, but I thought I would die laughing when that happened.  In order to get that joke, a person has to be familiar with the writings of both Stephen King and Dean Koontz, which is, again, appealing to a limited audience.
Every single character from Peter and his family to the neighbors to Tom and Diane, the newscasters, to Mr. Weed to Death (who has made three appearances on the show at various times), every character is well defined and funny in their own special way.  Peter has his stupidity, Stewey has his evil genius coupled with his age, Lois has her standard housewife attitude coupled with her rarely seen sensual side, Meg has her insecurity, Chris has his immaturity and childishness, Brian has his intellect coupled with his alchohol problem, Joe has his wheelchair and macho personality, Cleveland has his race and droll speech patterns, Quagmire has his perversions, and Tom and Diane have the irony of their typically outrageous reporting coupled with their droll and deadpan delivery.
Is it as influential as the Simpsons?  Deffinetly not.  Is it funnier?  Deffinetly so, especially when compared to the last few seasons (The Simpsons really is running out of steam).  By the way, don't listen to the nay-sayers who claim it was taken off the air because no one liked it.  Just look at these reviews for proof that that isn't true.  It was taken off the air because it kept switching schedules, and even the hardcore fans had difficulty keeping up with the various changes.  Remember, the show was cancelled after two seasons, but enough people wrote to Fox that they signed MacFarlane on for another season.  The outcry for a third season was unprecedented.  There is a place for this show in television history, and I hope that it lives on in these DVDs that others may hear that wonderful title theme: ""It seems today that all you see is violence in movies and sex on TV, but where are those good old fashioned values on which we used to rely?  Lucky there's a Family Guy.  Lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us laugh and cry.  He's a Family Guy.""",1057622400,5,4409,4.5437262357414445
1826188,5,B000083C6V,"The Simpsons undisputedly cleared the ground for cartoons to make waves on television, especially in prime time. The Family Guy steps into that mold and redefines it. When the Family Guy came on the air, The Simpsons had been doing so-so work leading to its now fairly ""blah"" stuff. Meanwhile The Family Guy has taken over the innovative and funny role, but to a higher level. The Family Guy includes racier jokes, more over-the-top references and hilarious satire of current events or hot shows. The writers always hit the mark, leaving you wondering how they got some of these shows on the air. I don't know where the show has gone, except to the Cartoon Network late nite. There is talk of new shows to come, which will be a welcome addition to some of the poor TV out there right now. This set has the first two seasons, both of which are essential to anyone who enjoys humor.",1057622400,,880,4.540880503144654
1826189,5,B000083C6V,"Many  of my friends began watching Family Guy back when it was on Fox, but I didn't get into it until it became somewhat of a scavanger hunt to find when it was on.  It is a true injustice that this show was taken off the air.  Although we won't be seeing any new episodes, this dvd set let's us have a huge selection of old episodes to watch for years and years to come.
Allow me to speak more about the show itself, rather than it's history, for those who need a little extra insentive to order this wonderful collection.  Family Guy is the greatest cartoon ever.  It's jokes are very random, yet very very funny.  The jokes barely ever get stale and the ""running jokes"" the creators decided to use are used with enough moderation that they stay funny too.  This show is a cult classic.  It's one of those shows that was surpressed by the powers that be at fox, but still has a strong following.  It's one of those things that you just want to forever tatoo onto your mind, so you can quote it and remember the good times.  I would say Family Guy, is perfect for the college guy.  The best going away present you could get, I'd say.
The only reason I would not suggest this dvd set for, is for the fact that some jokes in the cartoon (especially in the first couple episodes) can be taken as offensive.  Now for those who do not get offended that is just one more reason to purchase this set.
I really can't stress this ehough so I'll just say, BUY IT, buy it now, buy it RIGHT NOW, it is such a great value.  I doubt that I did this product much service writing this review, read the other ones too their good, then make your decision.  Trust me, it's awesome.

1826197,5,B000083C6V,"This DVD is awesome. Family Guy is quite possibly the only show I love more than The Simpsons. A word of caution though, some of the jokes are very crude and in some cases racy, but its all done in good fun. However, if your not easily offended, you'll be laughing from the very first episode to the last one on this set. An example of the crazy humor in you'll find in Fmaily Guy is a scene where Peter (the father) fights a giant chicken for 5 while minutes. The fights takes them from the sidewalk, to a truck, to a helicopter, then on top of a skyscraper. In the same episode, Peter is informed of Y2K by a man in a chicken costume. After the apocalipse that is Y2K, Peter's family then goes off in search of the Twinky factory because as everyone knows, only roaches and twinkies can survive a nuclear blast. Crazy enough for ya?
Guest voices include, Adams West and Norm MaDonald (as Death). About the only thing I didn't like about this DVD set is that there weren't more commentaries on the episodes. They were hilarious and I felt that the commentaries really added to the whole experience, however, Seth MacFalane (the creator) should really have provided commentary for a few more episodes.",1056672000,,1201,4.488584474885845

1826215,5,B000083C6V,"I remember during the 1999 NFL Playoffs, FOX had heavily hyped Family Guy just as much as it promoted the Super Bowl XXXIII, which of course, was a laugher.  Much like the clash between the Denver Broncos and Atlanta Falcons was nothing but hype, I was assured that Family Guy was nothing but just a Simpsons-looking ripoff.  Instead of deriding it further, I just fell in love with Family Guy, although various highly acclaimed critics and a major proportion of FOX viewers, a lot of them, Simpsons fans thought otherwise.  Furthermore, it was a darn shame that FOX did not have a whole lot of faith in the show, as it was shuffled in and out of lineups, like a baseball utility player. Sadly, instead of emerging as one of the marquee shows of the network, it was just thrown aside as an eccentric experimental show gone awry (i.e. Culture Clash, Andy Richter).  Aside from all the bad press it received, Family Guy is fresh, offensive, and just downright hysterical.  By far, it was edgier than the acceptable PG-rated norm, The Simpsons, pushing the ante for witty, satirical potty humor.
Family Guy follows the Simpsonic mold of characters.  The series revolves around the Griffin family of Quahog, Rhode Island.  The patriarch is Peter, your overly healthy average joe who works at a toy company and is basically your Homer Simpson-type.  His wife is Lois, a redhead New England-accented average TV housewife.  Meg is Peter and Lois' angst-filled teenage daughter, who like most teenagers, fights the uphill battle to fit in at school.  Chris is the older son, who is a lunkhead like his old man.  Then, we have everyone's favorite cartoon infant, Stewie, a wide-headed baby who speaks eloquently with an over-the-top British accent, obsessed with killing his mother for bringing him into this world and like your typical James Bond megalomaniac, he is after world domination.  The Griffins' dog is Brian, a pooch that can walk, talk, and can become a drunken, sarcastic bum.
As far as the episodes go on this DVD set, there are 28 episodes in all, Seasons 1 and 2 in their entirety.  Each episode is a guilty treat guaranteed to laugh yourself silly.  Here are my personal favorites from the first two seasons:
Death Has a Shadow: The pilot episode.  Peter is fired when he shows up to work extremely hung over and he receives a $150,000 welfare check by accident.  When Lois reveals this ugly tidbit, Peter tries to save face by dumping money back to the taxpayers off a blimp over the Super Bowl.
I Never Met the Dead Man: When Peter teaches Meg to drive, Peter accidentally knocks out the city's cable by colliding into a satellite dish and he makes Meg the culprit, to avoid cruel and unusual punishment.  Stewie attempts to destroy all vegetables by building a weather control device, when Lois forced him to eat his broccoli.
A Hero Sits Next Door: Peter becomes annoyed of his new next-door neighbor, Joe, a handicapped man who Peter was forced to invite to play on his company's baseball team.  Because Joe emerges the sentimental favorite from his baseball-playing stint, Peter tries to become a hero by attempting to foil a bank robbery.
Death is a B!tch: Peter visits the doctor, worried that he has a lump in his breast.  So that he does not have to pay a cent, Peter proclaims himself dead.  Much hilarity ensues when Death attempts to claim Peter afterward.
The King Is Dead: Lois is the new artistic director of the Quahog Players theatre group and she plans to direct The King and I as her first production.  For Peter to stop annoying her, Lois makes him the producer and he converts The King and I into a raunchy cyborg fighting extravaganza.
Road to Rhode Island: If I had to pick my very favorite episode, it's this one.  Brian goes to pick up Stewie from visiting his grandparents in Palm Springs, and they miss their flight home due to Brian's drunkenness.  The two set off back home on a heck of an adventure.  Meanwhile, Lois forces Peter to watch relationship communication tapes, which turn out to be porn.
You can make a viable case for each episode to be a favorite because each one is laugh-out-loud funny, of course, some more than others. In summation, Family Guy is a very well-developed, well-executed comedy, which should be taken with light-hearted humor through its peak moments of rudeness.  It is a hysterical riot worthy of a second crack on the airwaves, but since the likeliness of that happening looks bleak, there is more incentive into buying this extremely enjoyable DVD set.",1055548800,,4527,4.75095785440613

Each episode contains random points of hilarity and enough hidden jokes to justify rewatching each episode many many times. The way Baby Stewie always seems to have the right thing to say is unbelivable. As a brief example, In one of the episodes, Brian and Stewie are holed up in a motel trying to get to sleep. In the next room, all you can hear is a drug deal stammering along. So, frustrated Stewie says: There's only one way to end this...""He's WEARING A WIRE!!"".

1826250,5,B000083C6V,"Some people just don't know a good thing. This is why this hilarious cartoon never got much attention. It was horribly reviewed by critics, and shuffled around on the schedule by FOX, who didn't seem to know exactly what to do with it. I have never seen a show, much less a cartoon, that pushed the envelope that much and that far. It's amazing with some of the things they got away with. The show comes from creator Seth McFarland, and it's a doozy of a program. The show centers around the wacky Griffin clan, who hail from Quahog, Rhode Island. Dad Peter is a round man who works for a toy company. The wife is Lois, and she is voiced by Alex Borstein, who folks may remember from her five seasons on ""Mad TV"", where she had characters like Ms. Swan. Son Chris is rather rotund like his father. He isn't the sharpest kid either. He is voiced by Seth Green. Daughter Meg is short and wears glasses. The smart one of the family. She was originally voiced by ""Party Of Five"" star Lacey Chabert, but was then replaced by Mila Kunis, from ""That 70's Show"". The family dog is Brian. He talks, behaves like a human, and is the most intellectual one of the  bunch. Finally, there is baby Stewie. Never has there been a character such has him. He is a maniacal little tot plotting world domination. I am constantly amazed by this character. There are a number of recurring characters in this zany cartoon world. Their neighbor, Quagmire, is one for the books. A real ladies man. There are a few more. Seth McFarland also contributes the voices for Peter, Brian, Stewie, Quagmire, and a few others. The show is knee slapping, fall down funny. This is something very rare in television comedy these days. It can be quite offensive at times, and you feel guilty and ashamed for even smiling at it. This 4 disc collection contains 28 episodes from the show's first first 2 seasons. Some of the gems you will find are - ""A Hero Sits Next Door"", which has Peter planning a bank robbery for him to foil so he can be a hero like his wheelchair bound police officer neighbor. ""Brian In Love"" is another hysterical episode where Brian starts having accidents in the house. He goes to see a therapist and finds out he is in love with Lois. ""The King Is Dead"" is another riot as Lois takes over the local community theater and plans to do a production of ""The King And I"", but then disaster strikes when Peter takes the show over. ""Road To Rhode Island"" is another classic. Brian goes to pick up Stewie from visiting his grandparents in Palm Springs, and the two have an adventure trying to get back home. There are a lot more great episodes here, but those are some of the best. Every one is funny. What is also cool about the show, is how it really stays spot on with pop culture. Either recent or in the past. Some of their references or visual gags dealing with this are brilliant. The characters are also incredibly well developed. Each one has their very own personality, tick, and demeanor. McFarland is incredibly talented in this area. He does the voices for so many of the main characters. Each one is different and there are no traces of familiarity in any of them. Very well done. The show can be rude and crude, but it is always consistently funny and entertaining. It's too bad it never got a fair chance. Check it out.",1053993600,2,3315,4.434426229508197

The only thing that some fans may be upset about is that in the episode ""Road to Rhode Island"" A joke featuring Osama Bin Laden in an airport, was taken out of all reruns and even this dvd, after 9/11. Other than that all the episodes are intacted.
This is a great buy for any fans of ""King of the Hill"", ""Futurama"", ""The Simpsons"", or even ""South Park""",1053820800,5,1732,4.170149253731343
1826273,5,B000083C6V,"What I am about to say, may get me a stoning.
Family Guy is better than the simpsons.
Why you ask? Well, while the simpsons is grounded in (close) reality, Family Guy is surreal, and isn't afraid to do things that would never happen. an example: In one episode, a man dressed as a chicken gives peter a coupon, and Peter refuses saying he learned his lesson from last time. He then has a flashback with a five minute segment featuring him battiling a chicken on top of trucks, holding onto a helecopter, and crashing into an office building, where he slams the top of a copier machine into the chicken's head, and walks out of the hole they created saying only ""Chicken...Gave me a bad coupon""
The show was apparently too controversial and was canceled, which is a shame because the show had huge potential. Everyone should see at least one episode of Family Guy before they die.

It's always throwing something odd at you, it's totally irreverent, and it's a little dark. I'm sure my neighbors heard me cackling while I was watching this. Stewie and Brian are a real treat to watch. I also never realized before that Adam West actually does the voice for Adam West, mayor of Quahog.
As others have said, the quality seems a bit, um, ""rushed"". There are encoding artifacts in the image, though it is less common as one goes through the DVD's. By the fourth, artifacts are uncommon and minor.",1053475200,,599,4.504587155963303

Seth MacFarlane has some of the best vocal talents in the entire industry, and has broken at least a few records with his young age. Amazing what he can do to bring so many different characters to life in such a profound way. The DVD set could have been a little more dressed up in the way of extras and quality, but just having this piece of cinematic history to be enjoyed forever is something to make us all smile about.

 I love how the show will just pan to some hysterical situation

Seth MacFarlane did a great job to present a new comedy in 1999 that kept a traditional family formula, made popular by the Simpsons, but he took it somewhere new and funny.  The show doesn't waste time explaining situations or providing background information for certain jokes.  It dives right in to provide instant, sometimes brilliant, comedy.

1826282,3,B000083C6V,"This collection of Family Guy, containing two of the three seasons of the show, is an excellent compilation of the show.  However, the show leaves something to be desired in its humor at times.
It appears that nothing is too sacred to the writers of Family Guy.  While some of their spoofs are truly funny in themselves, many jokes take advantage of situations, instututions, and individuals.  In addition to these kinds of gags, Family Guy also utilizes much ""potty"" humor.  The comedy of the show, while sometimes extremely funny, can leave the watcher thinking, ""Did they just make fun of that?"" and, ""That was a stupid joke.""
If you are a fan of the series, this is an excellent compilation of the show.  For that, I give it 5 out of 5 stars.

1826304,4,B000083C6V,"First of all, I have been waiting for this series to be released since it was off the air.  The title of my review is no mistake: this really was the funniest show ever put on television.  It may not have been the most intelligent from time to time, but intelligence does not always dictate funny.
The set is worth owning if only for the commentary tracks alone.  Seth Macfarlane and various other cast/crew members comment on making the series and the past of the series and even if you aren't a die hard Family Guy Fan they make episodes you may have already seen 6 times fresh and even funnier than before.
The only reason this set doesn't get the full 5 stars is because I noticed they've changed some of the jokes, which apparently were too offensive for even the DVD.  I say they should have gone all out on the DVD, I mean they can even swear in the commentary tracks so why censor what was already on the air anyways?
Despite that disappointment (and I'm sure if you don't remember the original series as vividly as I do, it won't be as big of a deal) this show remains a rare gem in the manure pile of modern television.  Always edgy, *most* of the time extremely intelligent (I'm thinking of the cameo of Benjamin Disrailli) and contantly reminding you of things you didn't know you remembered, The Family Guy can now serve as inspiration to the next generation and for those who weren't lucky enough to catch it when it was on the air.",1052352000,,1446,4.380597014925373

It's a shame that a number of people have something stuck up their behinds, and put such a great show off the air.  Whatever happened to freedom of speech?  On the bright side, I heard that if enough people buy the Family Guy episodes, they might make a movie.  So if you want to laugh hysterically, I highly recommend buying these DVDs.

For every huge belly laugh gag (the Kool Aid Man, the Dukes of Hazard Fight, Brian chasing the chuck wagon, Stewie's dialogue, etc...) there are huge spans and even entire episodes which honestly have no real laughs, they just give you a small smile, and occaisionally a big groan when the joke simply misses (most of Peter's jokes).
Peter is an idiot, but unlike Homer Simpson, he is dificult to even care about. Meg, Chris and Lois are exceedingly average and hence uninteresting.  Stewie the baby and Brian the dog are easily the funniest, most interesting characters on the show, but tragically they are underused most of the time.
At it's worst, Family Guy is still miles above the worthless King of the Hill, and at it's best (the occaisional big laughs) it's even better than the Simpsons.  But most of the time, Family Guy is stuck somewhere in the middle.",1052265600,6,1016,4.576923076923077
1826308,5,B000083C6V,"Often one will hear the phrase tossed about that a show was ""too edgy"" for TV.  Usually, this is just apologia for a poorly conceived product, but in the case of ""Family Guy"" it is absolutely true.  This is a show that was every bit as radical as ""South Park"" but in a much more sophisticated, droll manner.  The odd thing is that at the same time it's skewering every sacred cow imaginable (more on that latter) with brilliantly satirical writing, it was also producing some of the most hysterical physical (for lack of a better phrase for a cartoon) comedy I have ever seen on any show.

Much like ""The Simpsons"", ""Family Guy"" revolves around one family, in this case the Griffins.  That's pretty much where the similarities end though.  Whereas the Simpsons interact with a huge cast of characters, and will frequently tackle an overarching theme, ""Family Guy"" involves a cast that is largely replaced from episode to episode (other than a few neighbors) and manages to turn utterly inane pop-culture references and mundane household events into major plot points.  A particularly good example of this would be when Peter (the father) has his choice for the town parade theme selected; the fact that his theme revolves around an obscure reference to the `80's TV show ""Who's the Boss?"" barely even registers as odd within the context of the show.

Also, whereas ""The Simpsons"" operate within the context of a `world' that is relatively similar to our own, the Griffins have a talking, booze-swilling dog and a psychotic, super-genius baby bent on killing his mother.  Furthermore, there are constant flashbacks, pop-culture references and super-natural visitors (Death appears in several episodes).

All those details aside, what makes this show so brilliant is that it's willing to tackle any subject.  Bathroom humor?  Done.  Abortion?  Done.  Politics, the handicapped and sex?  Done, done and done.  There is absolutely nothing ""Family Guy"" won't tackle, and it does so in such a pragmatic way that one can't help but laugh.  I suppose if you're really sensitive, this isn't a series for you, but since everyone and everything is a target, it's hard to get too upset (especially since you'll be too busy laughing yourself sick).

In the end, ""Family Guy"" is the perfect blend of satire, physical comedy, pop-culture send-ups and excellent animation.  It is a genuinely raw show that on more than one occasion left me thinking, ""Can they say that?"" and that's probably why it's not on the air anymore.  But it's also hysterically funny, and well packaged on the DVD's in this set.  While the extra's are nothing to get worked up about, the episodes alone are more than funny enough to justify the purchase.

Enjoy!

The witty approach that Matt Groening uses to weave his characters while making you feel attached yet amused by the characters, where as McFarlane suceeds in making characters only suitable for those with the comedic tastes of a two-year olds, such as my self.

Parts of it border on the absurd, such as the evil monkey that lives in Chris' room.  Other parts leave you going ""I can't believe they did that!"", such as the Hitler jokes in a few episodes.
This set includes all 28 episodes from the first two seasons, some of which have commentary, which really doesn't add much, since those doing the commentary are busy watching the show.

1826335,5,B000083C6V,"What's TV's best Cartoon? The Simpsons? Of course not. Beavis and Butthead? No. South Park? Close but no. It's Family Guy, a show that FOX first aired in 1999, Family Guy has been cancelled twice, last in 2002. Thankfully though the genuises at Cartoon Network cancelled that horrible show, ''Home Movies'' to make room for Family Guy reruns (it currently airs Sun-Thur as part of Adult Swim). When Family Guy was on FOX it was constantly being compared to the Simpsons, and in many cases called a Simpsons [imitation], but I don't think so. Since about 1998 (coincidentally the year before Family Guy aired) The Simpsons were running out of plot ideas, episodes started to get [weak] and relied on, ''The Simpsons go to (insert city) with special celebrity guest (inser name)!'' Family Guy took what The Simpsons started and brought it up a notch, for instance, the baby in the Simpsons has no personality and just sucks on a pacifer. The baby in Family Guy is an ... Genius bent on taking over the world. Another thing that makes Family Guy better than the Simpsons is all those hillarious flashbacks (you'll know what I mean after you see an episode). Also Family Guy has a funny New England flavor to it that makes it great to watch. The only complaint that I have is that not every episode has audio commentary, but at least this is better than South Park's season one dvd. In conclusion buy this DVD.

As for the missing scenes, I don't know the reasons for the ""JFK"" scene being edited, but the ""Bin Laden"" edit MAY (and I emphasise ""MAY"") be due to the fact that series creator Seth MacFarlane was supposed to be on one of the planes that left Boston on 9/11 but missed the flight.

Despite the funny situations they get themselves into, Peter, Lois, Meg and Chris are overly dry and sterile.  Yes, Brian's fun, and Stewey could very well be the most brilliant character ever created for a prime-time cartoon.

1826376,5,B000083C6V,"This was something I had been waiting for ever since they started putting TV shows on DVD.  One of my favorite and short-lived comedies is now available to own on DVD.  That series being Family Guy, in a very nice package, ""Family Guy: Volume 1.""  All I can say is it's about freakin' time!!
Yep, it's the family that was too rude and offensive for Fox to handle.  This very witty and extremely hilarious cartoon series takes comedy and satire to a whole different level.  I actually think this is much more offensive and outrageous than South Park.  With South Park, the offensive and crude humor is in your face and ""straight-to-the-point.""  With Family Guy, the offensive and sick twisted humor is very subtle in a shocking way.  The results: one of the funniest TV series to pollute your television set since Married with Children and The Simpsons.
With this DVD collection, you get all 28 episodes from seasons 1 and 2.  (Not a bad deal, if you ask me!)  Relive your favorite moments with the Griffin Family as they get into the most chaotic and unbelievable situations that will have you laughing in tears.
Here are the episodes:
Death has a Shadow, I Never Met the Dead Man, Chitty Chitty Death Bang, Mind Over Murder, A Hero Sits Next Store, The Son Also Draws, Brian: Portrait of a Dog, Peter Peter Caviar Eater, Holy ***, Da Boom, Brian in Love, Love Thy Trophy, Death is a ***, The King is Dead, I Am Peter: Hear Me Roar, If I'm Dyin' I'm Lyin', Running Mates, A Picture's Worth a Thousand Bucks, Fifteen Minutes of Shame, Road to Rhode Island, Let's go to the Hop, *** Janet!, There's Something about Paulie, He's Too Sexy for His Fat, E Peterbus Unum, The Story on Page One, Wasted Talent, and Fore Father.
The 4 DVDs also include commentaries, Internet promo spots, and a behind-the-scenes featurette.  It would've been nice to see some more extras, but I'm still pretty satisfied.
The only major drawback is the picture tends to be shaky at times (you really notice it on the first episode).  Now, this isn't a major distraction and it doesn't happen non-stop, but it does happen every once and awhile.  (At least it does for me.  It's possible that it's the set that I bought or my DVD player that's causing the problem, but I'm pretty sure I read that someone else was having the same problems as well.)
All in all, I am so happy that Family Guy is finally out there for everyone to own and enjoy once more.  It might've been a short-lived series, but  it's one that almost everybody has heard of and loves.  If you are down and feeling like you are having the worst day ever, pop in these babies and I assure you that you will forget all your troubles.  A very worthy purchase, indeed!

1826377,5,B000083C6V,"This show was so funny, I had always wondered what happened to it. It would be on, then on at a different time. Then it would skip a few weeks, be back on the air at another time. You never knew when it would be on.
Now I don't have to worry about it. The Griffins are at my fingertips for all time. What a deal this is too, 28 episodes for under forty bucks is a steal.
If you are not familiar with the show, be warned. It makes the Simpsons look like the Teletubbies. It is crude, rude, and outrageously funny. You will have an offensive joke thrown at you no mater who you are. White, Black, Southern, European, Jewish, Mexican, American Indian, etc. It doesn't matter, this was a no holds barred show that even FOX couldn't handle. Peter Griffin makes Homer Simpson look like Hugh Beaumont from Leave it to Beaver.
This show will shock and offend as it laughs at the rules of political correctness. When you have a talking alcoholic dog, a murderous one year old, a sexist man, a retarded teenage boy, an insecure girl, and a sexy woman all in the same family, what the heck would you expect?
This cartoon series blows away Kng of the Hill, The Simpsons, and Futurama. This was by far the best animated series FOX ever had. Bravo!",1051142400,,1234,4.323275862068965

The show skewers politics, religion, entertainment, and television with a ruthless brutality unheard of on network tv.  The question is, will we hear from them again?

1826380,5,B000083C6V,"You can chalk FAMILY GUY up with The Job, The Young Ones and Greg The Bunny among others as a great show that were cancelled for no good reason or ended way before their time.  Not to mention that they were all some of the funniest shows to grace TV.
On the surface, FAMILY GUY isn't the greatest show due to the mold it was in which was a wannabe Simpsons mode; Peter the dad, Lois the Mom and Meg the daughter could be modeled after Homer, Marge and Lisa from the SIMPSONS.  Homer and Peter are both fat, insensitive dumb fathers, Lois and Marge are both suffering wives who stay with their husbands for no good reason.  Meg and Lisa suffer through unpopularity through school.  Chris is the only original character of the mainstream family, and by himself is annoying.  Too bad he wasn't modeled after Bart.  Only the shows two standout characters were of any sort of new ground; Brian the Dog who imbibes cocktails, smokes cigerettes and dispenses advice to his dolt owner and baby Stewie who at the age of one builds laser weapons, blow guns and other weapons to destroy the oblivious Lois and later on became a mean prankster.  At the end, lessons would usually be learned that would only make the SIMPSONS creators roll their eyes and think ""You know we used to do that too, remember when Bart cut off the statues head?""  One episode even has a character have a hallucinitory dream the way some Simpsons characters did early on.
With all of that negativity out of the way, the shows brisk writing is what saved it and made it hilarious and broke it out of the mold.  Plots could start out on one topic and end on a completely different story (one episode has Peter planning on spending his tax money, after he is audited plans to build his own pool, to get a permit though he discovers his house isn't part of the US and forms his own country.)  Jokes sparkled with glorius lines (Peter tries potty training Stewie by offering him beer, since it makes you pee.  Stewie responds by saying while they were at it they could ""light up a doobie and watch porn"".  Peter considers it.)  The show was sprinkled with nonsequitors throughout that would be right out of the blue and hilarious.  (Peter sneaks out to go to a school function but falls off the roof, he is saved by Spiderman, who promptly leaves.)  The shows best part though came from the surreal flashbacks that characters would have for the purpose of telling a joke and I can't even start on those.
The show also had the same kind of cutting, harsh, shock humor that the Simpsons used to have and South Park still achieves at times.  It was sadly the shows downfall.  One show (not on this DVD set but has been reported to be on the next release) was banned by Fox due to such content.  Religon and Race would be the butt of some jokes and other times the humor would get too blue (Lois and Peter dress up in Bondage gear during a casual conversation).  The show took chances, was funny and sadly was ended but it's place as a cult show has been cemented and will live on in the fans.
If I may coment on the commentary of the show on the DVDs, even though only a few discs get commentary, they are all hilarious and the shows creator who provided the voice for Peter, Stewie and Brian does voices and it's great to hear (especially with swearing, and the voice of Lois during the first episode commentary is a standout).
The only demerrits are not enough special features and that my favorite episode (Road to Rhode Island) has a scene cut out which featured Stewie sining showtunes to distract a airport guard so that he can smuggle weapons on the plane and even mentions Osama Bin Laden.  However the pilot episode did gain a scene, so it kind of evens out.
Bottom line is that if you love South Park and the Simpsons, FAMILY GUY is a must own.  There is no excuse for not owning it if you like either of those shows.  If you decide not to get it, then as Stewie would say, BURN IN HELL!!!! (remember, he's one years old and wants to kill the mom.)",1051056000,,4014,4.381401617250674
1826381,5,B000083C6V,"Family Guy is quite possibly the best new show of the last ten years.  No offense to such award winners as The Sopranos, The West Wing and Six Feet Under to name a few, but this show had everything.  It was comical and satirical, sardonic and irreverent.  It made fun of everyone and I mean everyone.  It used sight gags The Simpsons and Futurama are afraid to use and goes beyond.  Quite simply it is under appreciated.
Season one was short but sweet.  Peter cheats the government, feigns Homer Simpson with TV withdrawal, Stewie thwarts a cult leader, Peter punches a woman, builds a bar in his basement and turns Lois into a famous lounge singer, Peter exploits the handicapped, Lois pulls a Marge Simpson and becomes a gambling junkie and finally Brian steals the show.  It sound a lot like The Simpsons, but it had more guts.  It wasn't afraid to make you laugh by offending anyone and it did it so well.
Season two only got better.  Peter's piano talent is accesbiel only through imbibing alcohol, he turn the King And I into a cyborg kill fest, breast feeds Stewie in the shows funniest sight gag to date, leads his family in rebellion and it thorws in plenty of other song and dance numbers, the signs of a great cartoon.
The dialogue is superb, just the right amount of plot advancing script as making fun of someone script.  The characters are hilarious. Quagmire is easily one of the best supporting cartoon characters since Moe, Brian is the smartest of the lot and he's a dog, martini sipping, chuck wagon chasing, golden voiced Brian.  Better than Astro, Dino and Santa's Little Helper combined.  Stewie is hilarious.  He easily eclipses Maggie as the best baby from a cartoon series.  Move over Pebbles and BamBam.
The Griffins as a whole are like the Bunkers on steroids.  They're like The Simpsons on crack.  They're the King Of The Hill meets South Park.  They were a perfect hybrid of everything that makes a cartoon successful.  It had great writing, great voice talents, perfect matches for the characters, simple story lines made complex by the dynamics of the characters in them.  Stewie can turn even a simple love story at a day care center into a mature story line with witty dialogue delivered with adult emotion, but then expose the cold hearted Janet for just wanting his cookies.  Great symbolism!
In the end, this show got the short of the stick.  It got a raw deal when television needed a show like this.  It is wildly popular, thank God for this boxed set and it's revival on Cartoon Networks Adult Swim.  I know many people that want to see this show back on Sunday night amid The Simpsons, Futurama and King Of The Hill, where it belongs.  But now it can live on forever and thank the Fox Corporation for giving us this treat.  Buy it and watch it as often as you can!  I give it my highest recommendation possible.",1051056000,10,2851,4.57396449704142
1826437,5,B000083C6V,"Fox's cancellation of The Family Guy can only be described as idiocy.  I'm a long time Simpsons fan, but when comparing the first two seasons of the Simpsons with the Family Guy, I would have to note that the Family Guy was consistently hilarious right out of the gate, whereas the Simpsons took time to grow.  Good thing, too, since Fox went out of its way with scheduling snafus to doom the show into oblivion.  I watch a few episodes each night and am consistenly reduced to tears.  It is nothing short of genius.  Buy this DVD set.  It is better than a petition for letting the Fox Network know what they have.

1826438,5,B000083C6V,"First off, this DVD set is incredible.  I've been a huge fan of ""Family Guy"" since the post-Superbowl debut episode back in '99.  I was hesitant about buying the set however, because after reading a number of reviews, I had learned that the un-aired episode ""When You Wish Upon A Weinstein"" was not included.  Nonetheless, I made the purchase, and I'm glad I did!
I just read an exclusive interview with Seth McFarlane on TVSHOWSONDVD.com and the ""Weinstein"" episode will DEFINITELY be on the upcoming Volume 2 set which will be released September 9th.  I suggest you check it out if you require confirmation.
Now, back to this set.  I guess there's only one beef I have with this, and that would be that the Bin Laden joke was removed from the episode, ""Road To Rhode Island"".  I guess the execs at Fox deemed it inappropriate.  Aside from that, I couldn't ask for a better set.  2 episodes on each of the disks have been laced with optional commentary by McFarlane et al which provides insight into the making of the show which I found to be very insightful.
It's a shame the show was so short-lived, but for those of you who want to re-live the episodes again and again, this is the perfect set to buy.  Highly recommended.",1050969600,6,1226,4.536363636363636

Though it went of with a bang...I have longed for these episodes with it's jabbing humor, unrelenting and ballsy steroetypes and just plain ole' slapstick comedy.  It was not for your faint of heart viewer.  Like all cartoons, the first few epsiodes were finding it niche and cummulated with The Millenium Episode (DaBoom!) where, by and act fo god, and a huge chicken, many people who did not watch the show, began to recognize it's humor.  Kudos to the producers of Fox to fill the Fans base's hearts with the release of this set and the rest coming this September, hopfully with, 'Wish upon a Weinstein'  the unaired episode due to it's strong stereotyping of of the Hebrew faith (Optimus Prime makes a cameo).

For sheer volume and intensity of laughs, this is the funniest show ever. Funnier than the Simpsons. Funnier than Seinfeld. It constantly exceeds your expectations, skipping over the obvious joke, past the not-so-obvious joke, beyond the extremely subtle joke to hit a joke more surreal and offensive than you ever imagined. And it does so over and over.
The DVD itself has a few shortcomings. There are some fairly obvious compression artifacts, and there aren't a great deal of bonus features. However the packaging is quite slick, and really, when you have this much great comedy in one package (28 episodes!), what's a few glitches?

It's not, which was a little disappointing.

Alright back to the DVD. It has a few random episode commentaries complete with long ""pauses"" or moments of silence during the episode, I guess they ran out of things to say.

1826520,4,B000083C6V,"I never truly understood the brillance of this show until I bought this DVD. This set contains 28 episodes, which is quite a bit for $$$. ""Family Guy"" features mostly low-brow humor, but it is usually pretty funny. But the thing is, it constantly throws gags at your face with dream sequences and other bizarre stuff. This sheer over-the-topness is what makes watching all these episodes great.
Technically, thsi disc is up to par with the other fine FOX TV cartoon DVD releases. The color is sharp and their are no problems with framing or ""jiggling"" with the picture. The animation is a bit crude but that relates to the source material. Audio range is above-average as well using both speakers solidly but nothing too overpowering.
However, the extra features are not exactly what you would expect. First up is several promos running 15-30 seconds long that were used on Fox. Com to promote the pilot of Family Guy after the Super Bowl. They are in excellent condition. Next is commentaries. Fox has put two commentaries on each disc, but they shouldn't have even bothered doing that. I found, like a previouis reviewer also found, large gaps in-between comments and not much meat on them. Even with 3-4 people, it is very boring and no one has really much to say. It is very disappointing. Finally, there is a four minute featurette on the fourth disc. This was another promo tool used by Fox to promote the pilot, and while there is a bit more information on this extra than on all the others, it still is limited to a quick four minutes. While there was some effort put into these extras, they are a far cry from the quanity (or quality) of other FOX TV DVD's, mostly notably ""Futurama"" and ""The Simpsons"".
I recommend this ""Family Guy"" DVD not because of its extras, but its episodes. While I was never a big fan of this show when it aired on FOX, I am a fan now. All episodes are clean-up for the DVD and this is a must-buy for fans and some non-fans alike. But if you don't care for this show or don't have the cash available, you should strongly consider not buying this DVD since it has weak supplements.",1050624000,,2115,4.539267015706806
1826521,5,B000083C6V,"Here's irony for you: a show that constantly lampooned the stupidity of TV turned out to be too hip to last on TV.  Oh well, we now have this four-disc set to remind just what we've been missing since ""Family Guy"" was finally taken off the air.  While ""Family Guy"" certainly bears more than a token resemblance to ""The Simpsons,"" it distinguished itself by being even more random and outrageous than its animated predecessor.  Peter Griffin, the title character, basically IS Homer Simpson, except fatter, stupider, and more irresponsible.  Fortunately, ""Family Guy"" also shares ""The Simpsons""' subtle, irreverent brilliance.  Every few seconds brought another unpredictable gag, bizarre flashback, pop-culture parody, or social-historical reference.  While the episodes had plots, they basically unfolded in free-flowing stream-of-consciousness format, making it virtually impossible to tell what was coming next.  ""Family Guy"" spits out jokes so rapid-fire that you can barely even process it all.  Sometimes I've missed one crack because I was still laughing at the previous one.  Of course, the solution is to watch over and over again, which I'm sure I'm going to wind up doing.  Although it makes a great family comedy, ""Family Guy"" is successful mainly as a grand satire of American culture.  The show is constantly casting light on just how shallow, excessive, and flat-out stupid our society can be.  While its merciless parody may not appeal to shallow minds, ""Family Guy"" is a great alternative to the fluff that occupies way too much airtime these days.

The way the episodes were produced, there were 37 episodes according to the network's episode classification.  However, they aired them in different sequences, and only ended up with 28 episodes.  The remaining 9 episodes were attributed to season three.  So, depending on which source you check, you will see either 28 or 37 episodes for seasons one + two.
I suspect the second volume will have all the rest of the episodes.  Aside from the technicalities, this show is absolutely brilliant.  It is, by far, the best written cartoon, and possibly TV show, period.  I used to be a simpsons fan, but after starting to watch Family Guy, the simpsons seemed much less entertaining.

I imagine this was to save space to include more actual episodes on each DVD by not commentary'ing everything.  There are numerous spots in the commentaries where no one says anything at all, but most don't last more than 3-4 minutes each.  I wondered if they had stopped entirely at one point.  The voice actor who plays Lois is in most (if not all) of the commentaries, and she's very funny (as is Seth, of course).  They do pick on the show (""See that? It means Peter is REALLY STUPID"") and on each other (""No, really, just give me a Yes or a No, Seth, and don't explain, so we can sit here for 20 minutes in silence."") but occasionally Seth or Lois's voice actor will do a character voice cursing or saying something funny (that's quite a laugh).  And, of course, there's mention of which scenes were considered riske at the time and which they had trouble getting past the censors.  I wish the commentary was on all the episodes, though.

There are more offending movies on DVD out there, FOX. You can't see the offensive material if you don't buy it!! Maybe they're saving it for the Season 3 DVD.
Anyways, my first episode of Family Guy that I watched is a vauge, yet known memory. It was that of ""Dammit Janet!"" (which is on this set, great ep), in which Stevie, at a new daycare, falls for one of the other kiddies. Meanwhile, Lois gets a job as a flight attendent, allowing Peter to fly for free. While I didn't care for the Stevie story much, Lois and Peter's caught my eye (and my humor). Really caught my eye. I laughed so hard that I thought I was going to vomit. This started my love for the show. Now that it is on DVD, I can appreciate it greater.

My big worry is the 9 second season episodes that are missing. There is a review on here that says they got moved to the 3rd season. I really hope this is the case and they show up on the next box, because they are among the funniest: a 2 parter where Brian goes to Hollywood and winds up being a porn director; Peter tries to prevent some Brits form taking over his favorite bar; Peter goes to Washington to testify that his company's new smoking doll is safe.
The stuff on the current box is hilarious, but someone messed up the synopsis of ""Mind Over Murder""... Lois is the lounge singing sensation, not Meg.
Anyway, this is the rudest, crudest, funniest cartoon ever, and it's too bad Fox didn't stick with it. It should've always been after the Simpsons on Sundays... Buy it and laugh your fool head off!",1050364800,,1006,4.328042328042328

The fact the show was taken off the air is a further reminder of the semi-democracy and paralytic freedom we are forced to endure. (Apologies, didn't expect to get political).
Anyway, as a deranged paranoid city mayor did once say, 'How do you know my language?'. (5 points to name the episode).
PS - I have all 50 episodes on CD as a gift from a friend on my 29th birthday. I have (sadly/heroically/unashamedly) watched each episode 5 times. It just keeps getting funnier.",1050364800,8,729,4.703125

I don't know why the bin laden joke and the Once upon a Weinstein were dropped. If you find those offensive, I think you  would find the whole show offensive. I imagine fans of this show are not going to be easily offensed by crude jokes and bodily function humor and jokes about a baby wanting to off his own mother. So why should fans be denied these things? Why does the UK get them? It's not like Americans aren't used to crude humor(Goodnes knows we invented it), so this deletion is just plain unecessary and silly.

Ever since this aired there has not been an episode to go by that didn't leave me laughing histerically and grasping for more. From its inuendo's to the blunt truth of everyday life, family guy is a winning show for the stressed out college person. Can't wait for the 3 season to come out. I just wish it was still shown on air. However I am upset that the other work Seth Macfarlane has done is not on this set.

1826641,5,B000083C6V,"Family Guy only had a three season run (I think after a year of silence it's safe to say there won't be anymore).  These two DVDs make up over half of the 50 episodes in the series.  Despite what you may have heard, these 28 episodes entail every episode that aired in the first two seasons.  Because of Season 1's late start, a lot of season 1 episodes were pushed into season 2, which in turn pushed some season 2 episodes into season 3.
The series starts of very strong for a first-time viewer.  The episodes are packed tight with jokes and often go off on wild tangents.  The early stories are a little weak, but they pick up in the second season where the series gets even more creative.  Definately something that keeps getting better through the second season.  The third season was a little weaker, so if you were only getting one of the two sets, I'd recommend this one.
If you've never seen Family Guy, then be warned: it's not for everyone.  It's got crude humour, and isn't afraid to poke fun at just about anything, despite what popular opinion might be.
The DVD set also comes at a relatively cheap price, considering you're getting 28 episodes of Family Guy goodness.  The third season set would most likely entail the other 21 episodes (22 if they include the unaired ""When You Wish Upon a Weinstein"") and thus in two purchases you can have all of Family Guy.",1049846400,45,1375,4.468

1826643,1,B000083C6V,"I'm wanting and awaiting a release of the third season of ""The Simpsons"", and yet, here is ""Family Guy"" in all of its humorless glory, still (trying to) ride Homer's coattails. Yes, if you buy the Simpsons, you can get a discount on this second- (or third-) rate knockoff.
I tried to give this show a chance, despite its already horrible premise. You have a fat, overweight, lackadaisical Everyman, his semi-reasonable wife, a smart daughter, a dumb son, a super-intelligent baby (with a disgusting 40-year-old voice) and a talking dog. The family would get into, and out of, ludicrous capers (which isn't necessarily bad - the Simpsons is often at its best in these moments; I mean, Homer becomes an astronaut?).
However, where the family guy really runs afoul is in its horrible writing. Whereas the Simpsons often times tweaks popular culture and current events, the Family Guy runs over them with a sledgehammer. In fact, this show seems to want to be more South Park than the Simpsons, but is afraid to jump over the cliff in the profanity aspect. So instead, we are treated to mean-spirited jokes about Oprah Winfrey or the NBC network, which fail to amuse.
I am surprised by the reviewer who claims this show is just ""too witty, shocking and satirical"" for American tastes. In fact, the Family didn't fail because of its shock content; in fact, most of America hardly batted an eye during its two (or maybe three, but who's counting?) season run. I remember reading a TV critic who lamented the Fox network's choice of ignoring a gold mine in Futurama, while continuing to run episodes of the sad-sack Family Guy.

1826701,5,B000083C6V,"Here's the honest truth, America: ""Family Guy"" is the one show that tops ""The Simpsons"". Honestly, can you IMAGINE what this show could have been if it had been allowed to continue? Unfortunately, it was just too witty, satirical and shocking for the American palate.
Now, here is why I think ""Family Guy"" deserves to be ranked among the best shows ever. What ""Family Guy"" really is is a facade of outrageous humor that masks a secret agenda: to show our American life for what it really is. The absurd situations in which Peter consistently finds himself are indicative not of a crazy made-up world, but our America and our way of life. You'll notice that while the adventures of the Simpsons unfold in the Springfield of a state that is never revealed, the very first episode of ""Family Guy"" informs us that the Griffins make their home in Rhode Island, though the name of the town itself is fictional. I believe that this points to an undeniable ""realness"" of the show as a whole: the characters do human things, and more importantly they exhibit characteristics (and problems) of the real modern world. Peter is dense and absorbed by TV, Meg is run-down by the pressures of being a girl (she has a friend who encourages her to throw up to get thin), Lois is underappreciated by her family, Brian is a recurrent problem drinker, and Chris is a typically overweight adolescent who leaves the house every day ""to go get wasted"". Those are just the main characters! However, to really appreciate this show and its VERY well-written storylines, you'll just have to watch it. I guarantee you you'll be shocked, surprised and, if you have even the slightest predisposition towards laughter, on the floor before the end of the first episode. All hail ""Family Guy"", the best show of all time!",1048896000,31,1787,4.730769230769231

Let's not even try to understand why he thought that 2(episodes per disc)x4(discs)=6. And furthermore, the show had a total of 49 episodes, plus one unaired episode.
Anyway, it is a terrific, cutting edge, amazingly original show, but if you're here you either already believe that with your whole heart, or hate the show so much that anything I say won't convince you otherwise.

Other characters such as Quagmire, Cleveland, Joe and especially Tom and Diane provide the unpredictability and enrichment that makes each Family Guy moment a unique experience.

I'm one of those people who loves a sick joke or a tasteless stab at society, and so I naturally laughed myself silly watching this show. It's a lot like ""The Simpsons"" in that it parodies a lot of things about American culture (and other cultures too) and isn't afraid to make a tasteless joke at someone else's expense.
But where ""The Simpsons"" stops, ""Family Guy"" begins. Peter, one of the main characters, is even larger and dumber than Homeralmost aggravatingly sobut his stupidity contrasts well with the unexpected intelligence of Baby Stuey. Stuey is probably a year old, but he talks like a college grad and curses like a sailor. That and he's constantly plotting to kill his mom.
Add to this a talking dog (who is always one to make the snide remark) and a refreshing disregard for being ""appropriate,"" and you have the greatest show that never should have been cancelled.

I Just prayed and hoped that ""The Family Guy"" would come back on or a DVD would come out. So im thankful that the DVD is coming out, I already pre-ordered it because I can't wait any longer. So..

I remember the Simpsons at the time before Family guy, and I have to say it was not up to par with it's former quality. Once Family Guy hit the air, Matt Groening, not to mention T. Parker & M. Stone, realized they had to get off their assees and write some funny. So, to anyone who likes the Simpsons or South Park I hope you thank Seth Macfarlane every Wednesday and Sunday night that Homer and gang are still around making you laugh.

Chris and Meg are struggeling and weird teenagers.
Stewie is a baby trying to kill Lois, his mother who is quite borinmg at times.
And Brian is the most sarcastic character since Dogbert.
The flashes are hilarious and the great thing about the show is that they can do whatever they want with cartoons and se it!
BTW the show was only cancelled because after the 2nd season stopped they thought the show was stopping and got other jobs which made the writing for season three a little [worse] and awkward letting many viewers to stop liking the (I think) still admirable show.

This is BY FAR one of the funniest animation shows ever put on tv - with so many pop culture references, sight gags, plays on words, and spoofs, it appeals to every level or humor from slapstick to brainiac.
Peter and Lois Griffin head a family (unhygienic son Chris, social-misfit daughter Meg, plotting-to-take-over-the-world-after-he-kills-his-mother baby boy Stewie, and their pet -- a talking dog named Brian who's also an intellectual alcoholic) that is as dysfunctional as it comes.  They live in Quahog, Rhode Island, and seem to often know they are a sitcom family, even if the situations they get into are usually more outrageous than most.
This show is for adults, make no mistake - the humor often borders on raunchy - but in watching this show there were times I would laugh so hard I thought I was going to lose bladder control; it is THAT funny.
Fox may have been stupid in not giving ""Family Guy"" what it deserved while on the air - but my VHS tapes of it that I recorded while the show was on are so worn out with overuse, GOD BLESS FOX for releasing this on DVD -- and not soon enough!!

Family Guy is, by far, the funniest animated television series since the Simpsons were in their prime.  We're weighing in alot of shows here...Ren and Stimpy, Futurama...but there's something about Family Guy that just warrants gut-busting laughs.  Maybe it's Quagmire's ridiculous attempts at picking up women, Peter's wealth of ignorance, little Stewie's attempts at world domination, or just the random silliness thrown in to all of the episodes, such as appearences by the Kool Aid man, the 'Two Scoops' sun from the old Raisin Bran commercials, references to the old Incredible Hulk television series...and alot more.
Family Guy is definitely not for the kids...all of the situations are adult and sometimes are borderline risque (which got the series cancelled, unfortunately).  The network censors and committees have no idea what they've done...they threw away a gold mine.
While it could never truly replace the Simpsons, Family Guy was well on its way to becoming the new dominant animated series on Fox.  The Simpsons have been stale the last few years...Family Guy breathed new life into prime time animation that you just don't see anymore.  It's too bad, really.  In any case, don't pass up the opportunity to own every episode on DVD!!
Fans will love to have all episodes on dvd, I know i'm looking forward to it.  And even if you've never seen it, then take my advice: Pick it up anyway!  You will not regret it!  The extra features are a little bare bones, but it doesn't matter.

Despite no pages having this information yet, if you check the front cover you can clearly see it states 'Seasons 1 & 2'. These are the seasons according to air dates.
Eight episodes total will have commentaries, and word has it there are other features. These features don't count towards the running time of the set.
All in all an excellent series. Family Guy packed as much humor as it could in every episode without ever overdoing it. It's comedic style is very different from the Simpsons and South Park (more pop-culture oriented), but i personally find it superior and more clever. The production quality is excellent and constant from the very first season (unlike the Simpsons). Probably best of all is Seth Macfarlane's outstanding job giving the voices of Peter, Brian and Stewie. Excellent story lines with a remarkable and memorable cast of characters. Definitely my favorite animated TV show of all time.
