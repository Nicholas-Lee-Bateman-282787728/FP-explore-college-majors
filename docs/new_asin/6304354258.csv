849096,3,6304354258,"I've been a huge fan of the Benny Hill show for 16 years or so. He is without a doubt one of the greatest gifts to comedy there ever was. Unfortunately, this DVD set does not include much in the way of the ""classic"" Benny material that I was hoping for. The shows from the '70's and early '80's featuring Benny, Jack Wright, Bob Todd, Henry MacGee etc., were in my opinion the best years. I didn't enjoy the addition of ""Hill's Little Angels"" to the show in the late '80's, and unfortunately, the majority of the 6 episodes in this DVD set were from that time period. They could have made much better choices on the content included in these DVDs.
The included documentary ""Benny Hill: The World's Favourite Clown"" is very interesting, and fans will enjoy the glimpse into his real life.",999216000,5,787,4.472222222222222

849224,1,6304354258,Some of Benny Hills stuff is ok. I thought this would have some of his funny scenes in it. I didn't think any of it was funny. Of course Benny Hill isn't one of my favorite actors. Somebody who really likes his show may enjoy it. I didnt. Sold this dvd.,1349827200,,253,3.980392156862745
849225,1,6304354258,Have followed Benny Hill since he befriended 2 British Paras on their first trip to London Soho. A great man who has the ability to make sex humerous and funny without lots of vulgarity. His inuendos are much better than lots of 4 letter words. Any time Benny.

849227,5,6304354258,"Benny Hill holds a special place in my heart. I used to watch it on channel 9-WOR TV here in NYC (about 20 years prior to the UPN age)..boy oh boy! that  channel and tv in general has really changed But then at time I could always look forward to watching Benny Hill at about 730...I used to get all happy when the Big Ben-Thames logo would pop up and then the do-doo-do-doo theme would play. Then it was on...I'd look at Grampa and then Benny would hit that baldguy on his head and then i'd pat my grampas head...that chase was always the best i used to drive my grandmother nuts running all around the house like a little lunatic...jumping on the bed and all that good stuff...yep i used to make believe I was getting chased around by Benny and crew too. Benny Hill was a happy childhood memory. May you Rest in Peace Mr. Hill, thankyou for keeping me laughing all these years.",1092787200,7,879,4.295180722891566
849228,5,6304354258,"I don't think I*ve ever seen a Benny Hill video that didn't make me laugh. Obviously there are some sketches that have varying appeal to different viewers, but, imho, this is one funny dude. He is a master of expression and body language and completes many of his skits without uttering a word. I'm not sure is he is totally responsible for writing the shows, but many of the skits are very nicely produced with a bevy of singers, dancers and musicans. Of course the ""Hill's Angel's"" are knockouts.  This is English humor at it's best. I've watched several Hill's videos many times over and still find myself laughing. I guess it's just classic humor. Sometimes he reminds me of other great comedians in the way he handles a particular piece and he's also enough of actor to easily slip into other roles.  Benny Hill gave a lot of himself to the world of comedy and, again in my humble opinion, he deserves a 5 star rating for any one of his films.  I wish I had been able to see him in person.",1091059200,,994,4.391304347826087
849229,4,6304354258,"It is Benny Hill so it will always be funny. However, I prefer the stuff I used to watch when I was a kid.
This is almost like the clean version of Benny Hill.
My question is: Where is the good stuff?
Anyway, the sound is mono and the picture quality is decent. These limitations are due to the original source. I particularly don't care much about those limitations and only care about the content.
Where are the racy stuffs?",1044057600,11,426,4.3375
849230,3,6304354258,"I want to start off this review by stating that I still laughed out loud during some moments during this 2 disc compilation and will probably revisit this set again.
There were many classic sketches from Benny's 70's episodes which I thought should have been included, but it appears the sketches included on the set are from the mid to late 80's tv series.  A compilation of sketches produced some years ago had more variety of Benny at his ""classic"" best.
The documentary was most enjoyable but more from an american perspective.  It gave an insight to the comic genius and was of a reasonable length showing clips from his early tv series.
I am happy to announce the video transfer is of broadcast standard and that the mono soundtrack would not have benefited too much from a stereo soundtrack except for some musical sketches.
Whatever reason earlier 70s sketches could not be included should not deter customers too much. Benny Hill is still a unique performer who deserves to have a place in your comedy library.",1031961600,17,1019,4.751412429378531
849231,5,6304354258,"I guess you could divide the world into those who love Benny Hill and those who can't stand him.  There doesn't seem to be anybody who is neutral about the lad and his show.  Well, I'm one of his fans and this 2-disc DVD is my idea of fun.
Benny's TV show is represented here in 6 programs, 3 on each of the discs, each nearly an hour long.  These programs are packed full of all the things that made The Benny Hill Show the classic comedy series: silly songs, quick joke sketches and cheeky gags, gorgeous gals in swimsuits and lingerie (aka Hills Angels), long wordless comedy routines with Benny and company, madcap chases to that geat saxophone, and the wonderfully uninhibited Benny Hill.

Benny is joined here by all his usual gang: Henry McGee, Jackie Clayton, Bob Todd and the beautiful and talented Hills Angels, particualarly Sue Upton, Erica Lynley and the delightful Louise English.  Several of the programs also contain sketches featuring Benny teamed up with some adorable children.  I think Benny does some of his best work with the kids.  Look for the great sketch with Benny taking the kids along as he tries to do some fishing.

If you like Benny Hill and his TV show then I know you'll like this DVD.",999388800,53,1219,4.559633027522936
849232,4,6304354258,"This set brings back the great comic genius of Benny Hill to America. Though many feminists found offense at his use of scantilly clad women, the comedy of Benny Hill has much more to it than that. Hill was a throwback to a more slapstick style of comedy made famous in the 20's and 30's cinema. His shows contained a great mix of visual comedy, verbal jokes, and lots of charming song and dance routinues. Watching the Benny Hill show is almost like a vaudeville show from the turn of the century. His comedy was definitely more than just women in their underwear.
This DVD set presents six one hour episodes of his show. While there is a good mix of famous skits, this set barely scratches the surface of his 50 year comedy career. The set also seems to focus on the 80's shows and I would have liked to have also had something from the 70's in the set.
However, the episodes look picture perfect and the mono sound is good and true to the original broadcasts. There is also a nice documentary about Hill that shows him in the early 90's and tells about his history. Stars like Burt Reynolds and Mickey Rooney also share their thoughts of Hill. The discs also contain a pretty nice verbal bio of Benny Hill and a still gallery from the shows.
Not the ultimate set, but well worth the price. I just hope for more releases in the future. Highly Recommended.",999388800,4,1357,4.410358565737051

stuff after the 'seventies... i was in the military late-'sixties-early 'nineties. I bought this to catch up. I'm looking for a
bit of the old stuff... which seems to be QUITE expensive, even used.
This looked like a nice place to start. Haven't seen everything yet... cannot watch it all in ONE day!",1496966400,,414,4.608108108108108
