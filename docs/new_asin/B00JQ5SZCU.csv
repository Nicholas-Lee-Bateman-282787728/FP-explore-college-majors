Great plot, and it had a few funny moments but I think a few more would've been great; but not too many to where it would be a completely ridiculous movie. Junior High Spy is also really great but this one didn't seem as cheaply made (of course there's nothing wrong with that as long as it turns out OK).",1450396800,2,344,4.073529411764706

6388979,3,B00JQ5SZCU,"I admit it, I bought this because it has Kevin Sorbo and I wanted free shipping with a $35 order. That said, the story was tolerable and the acting (especially the kids) was just okay. Mr, Sorbo  was not on screen enough to give this movie an ""I like it"" rating. Although, he and the dogs were probably the best parts of the movie.",1418083200,,331,4.171875
6388980,5,B00JQ5SZCU,"This family movie was very enjoyable to me! It centers around a missing artifact-The Crystal Chalice,a treasure from Russia. Sam Steele and his Junior Spy Agency are put on the case as a result of his school assignment. Also looking for this treasure is a thief named Cash(played by Kevin Sorbo)and his three bumbling cohorts as well as the city's fire chief,who is actually Russian and working to get it back for his home country. It is a really funny movie that the whole family will enjoy! I recommend it wholeheartedly!",1408147200,,523,4.758241758241758

8653198,5,B00JQ5SZCU,"What can I say about this film? A lot actually, but that would take too long to read. I will boil it down for you though. First, I really liked this film's dual themes of believing in yourself and never underestimating others because this is how one will eventually succeed in life. Second, I did think the acting by the cast was rather cheesy though since it's a family film it makes sense. Third, I could see this film series continuing on into the future with the Junior Spy Agency becoming an actual government supported spy agency though this would be fictional of course and is contingent on the two main cast members coming back. In general, I think Hollywood should produce more of these type of films because I don't see how horror films are great for our society.",1496361600,,773,4.5285714285714285
