This is not for kids as there is a lot of sexual innuendo and the activation of the duos powers require that they bump crotches. Having put the warning out there you may ask are these 2 characters gay? It is very ambiguous at many different times, so your guess is as good as mine. neither has a girlfriend until later on in the second season and Vav seems to be rather jealous but again......not the point. it is very fun and I really did laugh quite a bit. if you love cartoons, love snarky humor and if you love craziness, here is something for you.",1462752000,,620,4.3076923076923075
