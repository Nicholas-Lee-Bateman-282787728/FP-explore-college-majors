8168289,4,B000MEYKB4,"This is an over 4 hr. dvd of basic stretching, Hip Hop dance routine, aerobics, yoga, pilates, toning/weights, & lifestyle info of nutrition, motivation & posture. This dvd also uses a simple questionnaire to make routines tailored for you like a personal trainer.
This was filmed in the UK I believe & everyone has different UK accents which are lovely to hear. The set is always a stark white which is fine, voice is very clear over the mics, same for the music & camera clarity are all high quality. The ""music"" is very bland, but the tempos do go with the workouts for most of them. The instructors are very lively, happy, enthusiastic & motivating, except Simon  & Sally in my opinion who were just no nonsense, let's just do it so we can lose weight, but does make sure you do it properly. Also, whether or not they have assistants to show different levels of beginner, intermediate & advanced exertion, they always show it, even if they are alone & show the difference themselves.
Cons -
Editing - they way the stop, they sometimes even cut off the instructors as they are saying goodbye. It usually pauses suddendly before fading to black. They also don't have the instructors give their name sometimes.
Camera Angles - really annoyed me. On the men, or women wearing baggy/normal pants/shirts that are considered prim/boring/modest by today's standards, it was fine, they'd sometimes go close-up, but never when demonstrating something. They try to make it look exciting, but the zooming in, changes were fine. But on the Hip Hop dance, it was horrible always zooming in on the instructor's tight half shirt  & exposed abs & made it nearly impossible to follow the dance steps! It was very frustrating. On basic stretch, when the woman who is an attractive, petite, slim blond in fitted sports bra & tight yoga pants was doing a simple arm across chest stretch, the camera went to her hips/butt. Yeah, explain that one. I apologize I had to add about the shallow looks, but obviously the director & cameraman ... well, we won't go there, suffice to say I hope they got fired or learn to be more professional, or maybe work in a more adult industry. Yes, of all the hundreds of fitness dvds, this really was the most gratuitous about that.

List of workouts & approximate time lengths. All choices are in the exercise portion of the main menu. Anything more then 1 choice has it's own sub menu.

Warm-up w/Fitzroy Gaynes
5 min - basic fast cardio w/only a hint of some stretches.

Cool Down w/Fitzroy Gaynes
6 min - nice slow, stretching, mostly stuff that's taught sicne middle school, but he has great body awareness & it really flows.

Aerobics w/Fitzroy Gaynes
Beginner - 18 min
w/2 women showing the beginner & advanced. He was really friendly, lively & fun, kind of like Shaun T from Hip Hop abs. There was a hint of some dance, but otherwise just plain aerobics/cardio, no equipment. He introduces everything in 1/2 time so you can follow easily.
Intermediate - 20 min
w/same 2 women. This time there is much more watered-down dance elements. Part of a mambo, cha-cha, chasseee (2 quick steps together, very simple), a turn, leg lifts, etc. It's still more aerobics then it is dance, but you really see Fitzroy has a natural dance ability, would love to see him teach dance moves.

Yoga w/Kahti Goupil (she has taught Madonna)
Movement & Strength - 21 min
w/1 female assistant to show the moves for true beginners. Khati is a true yogi, she explains everything in detail, where to place feet, wher to feel the stretch, where to make sure you turn the waist, etc.  Basic beginner moves only of triangle, side angle, wide legged standing fwd bend, down dog, standing fwd bend, mountain, chair, butterfly stretch, modified seated twist & good guided savasana. She sometimes has the assistant do the pose while she explains.
Suppleness & Well-being - 20 min
Kahti alone doing several fast ashtanga sun salutations & then  the basic poses from the above session.
She has great energy, really explains things in detail, would love to see more from her.

Pilates w/Sally Carmichael
Basic - 18 min
She is w/a female assistant who demonstrates the mat poses while she instructs on breathing, where to feel it & proper posture. Very slow, almost sleep inducing music.
Swiss Ball - 25 min
Again w/same assistant using the big balance ball w/same music.

Basic Stretch w/Kayleigh Pearson
8 min - oh my ... She comes on frowning, never smiles, slow sleep-inducing music & she never speaks. She just does basic standing, seated & reclined stretching we've all been doing since at least middle school. The cameraman & director obviously liked her though *roll eyes* See above why.

Hip hop Dance w/Lisa Brockwell
She's with a male & female backup dancing well with her. She's friendly, great cuing, has talent/flow to her dancing & the routine/moves aren't lame. She only goes full speed, but most are not too complicated, nothing too physically demanding, only a lot of hops in it, no floor. Love to see more from her with also 1/2 speed teaching. Hard to follow becasue of cameraman staying zoomed in on her for most of the workouts.
Beginner - 15 min
Intermediate - 23 min

Strength/Toning -
all standing or mat work, hand weights are used often, only some use balance ball or jump rope. They tell/show you the intensity diff of between beginner & advance. Mostly all the same work everyone knows, push-ups for arms/back, bicycle/sit ups for abs, etc. Not an interest of mine, so only skimmed.
W/Simon Waterson & different female assistants for diff sessions
** Target Toning - 6 min
** Arms - 5 min
** Back/shoulders - 13 min
** Mid body/abs - 4 min

Chris Webb alone
** Total Body - 11 min
** Cool Down - 5 min
** Skipping/Jump Rope - 8 min

Lifestyle Info
Nutrition - 12 min
Dr. Ali in a kitchen speaking about how bad acid food, stress, alcohol, caffinee & sugar can make one fatigued, depressed & lower the immune system. That penicillin does kill bacteria, but this allows fungus to proliferate. Candida bad bacteria that we all have, but with antibiotics & also grows with too much undigested food that is hard for the liver to deal with, so it comes out in the skin in rashes, acne, excema, dandruff. Great info, again, wish there was more.
Posture -
Dominic Cheetham discusses right posture for sitting, sleeping & standing, though barely an intro in my opinion.
Motivation -
Bob Muir goes over goals, charts, adding family to help, etc., usual stuff.

Overall a lot of content for such a low price. The ability to customize your workout depending on how you want is great. The instructors are top notch, great cuing & can see many love teaching what they love. I wish they had longer content for several of the instructors. The yoga & hip hop really feels too short & sure many would feel the same about the other workouts.",1259625600,3,7415,4.784988272087569
