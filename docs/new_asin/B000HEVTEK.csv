8139189,5,B000HEVTEK,"Great set! I'dd probably actually give this set 4 and a half stars - 5 stars for the movies themselves and 4 stars for the quality.

This set is jam-packed with some of the greatest classics of English Post-War cinema. Some of Obi-Wan Kenobi's greatest triumphs prior training with Yoda are here - Kind Hearts & Coronets (where he not only plays a murderous Duke-pretender to the throne, but all 8 of his relatives/victims), the man in the White Flannel Suit (presaging Disco attire by 20 years), the Ladykillers (goofy and not a hint of misogyny) , and the charming Lavender Hill Gang (who despite the title, aren't gay, although they do like all things Parisian)..Many other classics featuring the some best twisted Limey faces in cinema history.

The down side is that while the picture quality is quite good - very crisp, and in most cases quite clean, the films are not restored and in places show  artifacts, and fading. Some of these films have subsequently restored, but carry a much higher price tag.

Given that this set can be had for around $50 for 16 top notch movies, one shouldn't quibble. Dive in and enjoy!",1432684800,,1123,4.685279187817259
