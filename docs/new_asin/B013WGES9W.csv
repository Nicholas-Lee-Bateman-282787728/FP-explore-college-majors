7374331,4,B013WGES9W,I haven't paid attention to the whole story but my kids have already watched 3 times (once a day) and they love it. Another hit!,1447372800,,128,4.16
7374332,4,B013WGES9W,"I like the DVD but I hate the quality of the footage that is provided and this happened to the previous releases this year. The footage is in low-grade interlacing quality and they're being distrubited by Universal, the same company that release well-known films such as 'Back to the Future'. You think that they would provide some good clean footage. When it comes to crystal clear quality, I prefer buying iTunes in 1080p HD. The quality of the footage really stands out. Universal, if you're reading this, please fix the quality of your footage.",1447200000,,548,4.840425531914893

7374347,3,B013WGES9W,"I was excited to get this new Thomas movie for my train obsessed 3 year old son.  He adores Thomas.

7374353,5,B013WGES9W,"Our 2 1/2 year old loves Thomas, and since its just about that time of year, we decided to get this for him to watch on a family iPad (so the adults can still watch their shows too!)

He absolutely loves it, and we always make it a habit to watch new Thomas shows/vidoes/movies with him the first few times to relate to the story and follow along with him.

He couldn't be happier!",1448236800,,381,4.135135135135135
