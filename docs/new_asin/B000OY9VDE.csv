2803906,5,B000OY9VDE,"My daughter loves Horseland... wish there were more videos! We have both videos and she even pretends to ""jump"" with her stick horse just like they do on the video. She is probably a bit too young for them at two and a half but she is pretty much obsessed with horses so one morning when we ran across the cartoon she was hooked!",1197763200,,329,4.15625
2803907,5,B000OY9VDE,"I bought both of the Horseland DVDs, and my daughters LOVE them.  They are 5 and 7, and they LOVE this show.  I highly recommend it for anyone with girls!",1186963200,6,154,4.1
8187452,5,B000OY9VDE,"Great stories revolving around kids at a stable. Good morals, fun lessons. My girls loved them! Perfect for horse lovers - probably good for ages 3-9 years - or around those ages.",1497744000,,179,4.625
8187453,2,B000OY9VDE,This never was in our order though the order said complete and it never came later. Luckily we got the complete dvd wit 49 episodes and it was included in that,1376784000,,159,4.161290322580645
8187454,5,B000OY9VDE,This was the hit of the gifts for my Grandbaby. She is only three but loves Horseland. It was shipped promptly and was a great value for the price,1357603200,,146,4.068965517241379
8187455,1,B000OY9VDE,I bought these as a christmas gift thinking they were different  then the series. I did not read well. My daughters love this series so if you like them also buy the horseland complete series and you will have them all. These other discs are very misleading.,1325376000,,258,4.48936170212766
8187456,2,B000OY9VDE,"The first thing you realize about this DVD is that it only includes TWO episodes of the show. That's about forty minutes of watching! Usually when a DVD has that few episodes, it comes packaged with a toy or a book. But no, this is all you get for a standalone DVD. So what can I say about the actual show. Well, I am curious as to why there are only like six kids at this big horse camp, but I guess that's not important. I like the dog, pig, and cat A LOT more than the humans and their talking horses. I can't really say much about this show from two episodes, but it looks pretty formulaic.",1312848000,,594,4.0423728813559325
8187457,5,B000OY9VDE,i was expecting a used DVD but when I got it it was brand new in the shrink wrap with the seal still on it.  I was very very pleased.,1269129600,,133,3.433333333333333
8187458,4,B000OY9VDE,I bought this dvd for my granddaughter and she loves it.  It's great to be able to purchase a movie for a child and know it's safe to watch.,1247011200,,140,3.8275862068965516
8187459,4,B000OY9VDE,"My 3 yr old is obsessed with horses & she loves all the Horseland DVDs. They are cute stories and also usually have moral lessons included. My 5 yr old, who doesnt' have a horse obsession, likes these shows as well.",1229126400,,215,4.2682926829268295

8187461,3,B000OY9VDE,"My daughter was very well pleased in the DVD, but disappointed that it only had 2 episodes.  Other made for TV shows have put out season DVDs that contain multiple episodes for a similar cost.  The show is lots of fun, though!",1199836800,,226,4.357142857142857
