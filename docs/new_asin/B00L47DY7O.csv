6464389,5,B00L47DY7O,"I love to hear Dennis Jernigan sing worship songs.  They are so full of His love for God.  This movie is an encourager for me. Although I've not struggled in the same ways Mr. Jernigan has, I have battled insecurity and a sense of hopelessness throughout my life.  The honesty and the triumph this movie portrays helps me to see God for more of the loving Father He is rather than a God who desires to punish me and remind me of my failures.  This would be an excellent resource for someone struggling with God's unconditional love for us.",1416009600,12,539,4.414141414141414

I am glad I found it, and it is very uplifting to watch. His story really shows how God offers healing and change to everyone, no matter what they may be struggling with. I have dealt with some similar struggles (same-sex attraction) throughout my life, and this movie really provided further encouragement and hope for me in Christ Jesus.

6464398,5,B00L47DY7O,"This is a very inspirational story of a man who struggles with a private part of himself that his public lifestyle clashes violently with. Each failure to control his urges to live up to his own moral code while further damaging his self esteem, also makes him question his ability to live up to even the basic tenants of his faith. I was impressed with his willingness to do battle with these urges as many people often take the road more traveled saying, ""I can't help myself"" or This is just who I am"". Dennis was was willing to fight his demons without giving excuses for what he felt was reprehensible in view of his faith. He was quick to give all credit God for any success he did achieve inspiring us all to fight the good fight and not give up knowing that we do have a caring Father who knows our pain and aids us in our struggles if we are tenacious in our efforts to overcome.",1491955200,4,888,4.260355029585799

6464456,5,B00L47DY7O,"Speaking from the heart Jernigan narrates his journey as he struggled with homosexuality and found peace in His relationship with God and his marriage to a wonderful woman. His story is very thought provoking and highlights the intense isolation Christians with homosexual feelings have experienced in the church. While churches have developed support groups for so many who struggle with various issues,  Christians have shied away from making the church a safe place for homosexuals to ask for help, healing, forgiveness and support. Jernigan has made it his personal mission to help those who struggle with this issue. I found his story compelling and convicting.",1471132800,2,666,5.3428571428571425

I have to admit that I had only considered what I had seen on the surface.  But Mr. Jernagan shared his personal struggle in such a way that I can see how mistaken a lot of us are about this issue.  These people are struggling with their own personal cross to bear.  It may not be my cross or your cross, but it is theirs.  I am thankful that through this movie, I can be much more compassionate and Christ-like in my attitude and experience with homosexuals.  They, as with all sinners including myself, need support, love, prayer and compassion.  Thank you.",1467763200,3,668,4.516666666666667
6464469,4,B00L47DY7O,"This is Grace unspeakable for a generation celebrating the thing that became the origin of our fall from that Grace in the beginning - PRIDE. (...Thinking of the rainbow-defamed parades that go down the streets of our cities). Think of those words and understand what that banner is saying. Satan fell from Heaven because of Pride. It doesnt matter which adjective we use to define that Pride, but that it is the sin-nature of the flesh that these are celebrating in the face of an Almighty, Gracious, and Loving God. His love endureth forever, if only you should believe on the Name above all names, the Lord Jesus Christ, the One and Only Son of the Living God whom became sin so that we might become righteousness in the eyes of our Father!!! Hallelujah, bless His Holy Name!
Saying the sinners prayer, even with fullness of sincerity in your heart, will not free you from you alone. Repentance is forsaking your sins and turning away from them by cutting them off at the source, that source being you. You must be crucified with Christ, so that you may therefore live. I didn't comprehend Repentance for so long.
Though I did not struggle with this particular sin, I struggled with fornication, drugs, profane behavior, plus any and everything that was unrighteous and unholy in the eyes of the Father. But He is the Father of Lights. He gave it all for our salvation! He became flesh and dwelt among us, even experiencing the struggles of our flesh, and yet sinned not!
And yet HE therefore laid down That Perfect, Blameless Life WILLINGLY and took a scourging torture such as no man could bear yet that we deserved, carried the immense burden of the Cross, all the while being beaten with whips that ripped out chunks of flesh and blood as He was spat on and jeered on the path to Calvary. From there, the worse awaited Him and yet He finished the worse even unto death! Praise His Holy Name!
Heres the good news, HES ALIVE! Die to yourself and give to Him what He rightly purchased, your life with no conditions set upon it. Trust Him fully, and allow His Holy Spirit to control your walk every nanosecond you are living in this World, and you shall  receive Life more abundantly than your mind can even fathom. For it is Christ in us, the Hope of Glory, that will heal you from you. And in glorifying Him in that, Ye shall be glorified beyond any measure in which you are capable by carnal means. Faith like a child is the greatest gift anyone can receive. Jump in the river of His Holy Spirit, and Joy unspeakable will be established in you. Then you will become Him. Faith, Hope, Joy, Peace, and Love, the greatest of these being Love.by GRACE.
Understanding these things is the beginning of wisdom. And the beginning of Life Eternal. Praise His Holy Name, Jesus Christ. Grace and Peace to you all. If you need Hope for deliverance from a lifestyle completely devoid of these things, watch and listen to this story of Dennis Jernigan. This is a story for the age. Deliverance is at hand. Reach out and grab it!
In the Name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, Amen!",1467590400,8,3082,4.533213644524237

Has since been married 30 years with 9 children. He is honest, sincere and completely open regarding his mis-identity as gay. The world should not define our identity. Our identity is formed and found in Jesus Christ. His message needs to be shared with the world and all of those struggling with this dark and painful lifestyle. Jesus is the only answer for deliverance, transformation, forgiveness and grace. Loved this movie and love his music!  Thank you Dennis for sharing your incredible journey to find who you REALLY are.

Because of the world we live in, the sinful nature of the world at the highest peak, and because Jesus gave us free will it is most important for his prayer warriors to stay in tune with him.

6464569,1,B00L47DY7O,"Though I'm not much into Christian music, I found Mr. Jernigan's to be quite beautiful and calming.  I enjoyed it from the start.  His honesty and deep vulnerability I also found quite moving.  And in general, from the persona that comes across on the screen, I believe him to be a genuinely kind and loving human being.  However, the betrayal I felt near the end of this movie was palpable and overwhelming - a deeply visceral response I've never before felt in a documentary.  Not specifically a betrayal from Jernigan's thoughts and comments themselves, but more so how they were handed to us.  Much of the movie deals with this battle against his homosexual feelings.  Yes, I am gay, I have no problem with it, and never have.  I also believe in [a non-judgmental] God.  I do not identify myself as ""Christian""; I merely try to live my life in a loving a compassionate way (do unto others, etc.).  This is not a Christian film.  I don't know if it were an idea of the producers, director, or Jernigan himself, but this is a film that is calculating and grossly misleading.  The immense good (or so I thought) of almost the entirety of the film was devastatingly destroyed by the utter betrayal that I, and I'm sure many people, felt during the last 15 minutes.  It turns what a viewer may have thought was being hinted at by Jernigan 180 degrees, and suddenly you realize you've been duped, and duped from the start.  And it wasn't necessary.  It could have easily been explained at the beginning of the film or anywhere throughout, but someone made a conscious decision to go for the surprise ending.  (Life gone Hollywood.)  The film basically focuses on Jernigan's intimate truths, hardships and trials throughout his life.  This is a personal story.  It could have, and should have, finished that way.  However, the ending is filled with biting and hateful opinions... mere opinions... that not only were totally unnecessary to the movie, but also negated all the good you thought you had just experienced.  It was an epilogue that someone should have been smart enough to leave on the cutting room floor.  It turned a 5-star human-interest story into a deceitful and calculating attack on the same group of people Jernigan fought (still fighting?) all of his life.  I could have admired the man.  Now I question his motives.",1448928000,13,2333,4.732009925558312

I first watched the Sing Over Me documentary during my darkest hours, suffering the consequences of my own sexual sins.  Hearing Dennis's story let me know that I was not alone in the struggle and that there was hope.  I have found freedom in Jesus and have been set free from the control Satan once had over my life.

At them same time, this movie does not advocate homosexual behavior but rather advocates for a God who totally understands our great need to be loved and wants to heal our broken hearts, emotions, and sexuality through an intimate relationship with him as our dear Heavenly Father. So many Christians who have same-sex attraction are musically gifted and involved in music and worship at their churches. Jernigan shows why this is and also shows how God used his music to showcase the love of the Father - which is the healing answer for all of us.",1423008000,3,831,4.859154929577465
