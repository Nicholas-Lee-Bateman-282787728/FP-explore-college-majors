8100341,1,B000CQCTGU,"and says very little. Here's another Richard Walter DVD wherein he expounds and rattles on with very little information that is helpful or informative. With a title like, ""Strategies for Securing an Agent,"" you would think he might address how to write query letters, or who to address them to, other opportunities of meeting agents or getting your work seen. Once again another mistitled ripoff by Creative Screenwriting. It's like looking at a DVD cover that has lots of action and hot girls but upon viewing, it's paint drying.
Let me give you a run down of the great insights the ""Head of the UCLA Screenwriting Department"" provides.
Two Principles to Succeed.
1. A story must be Personal (he then goes on for 10 minutes or so about how Star Wars was personal to Lucas and how a book on healthcare by a friend of his was personal as well).
2. A Screenplay must be Integrated, meaning, recognize that a screenplay is a very elaborate list of only two kinds of information; sight and sound and that you can't have a character ""realize"" or ""feel"" or ""remember,"" it has to be shown. He actually uses a good example from the opening of ""About Schmidtt"" in which there is little action, a ticking clock, Jack Nicholson waiting till 5:00, empty shelves etc. all telling you about this man and where he is in his life.
Woo Hoo! Such insights.
Three overarching principles taught at UCLA
1.$ - there's no sin in making a lot of money and you reach more than your immediate family. Again he goes on for ten minutes going back to the Great Train Robbery, Trip to the Moon, and that Shakespeare's plays were great commercial ventures, etc.
2. Sex and Violence - get as much in as you can in. Ancient Greek Plays & Shakespeare were filled with them. Oedipus Rex is about a man who kills his father and loves his mother. Hamlet has nine corpses by the end, Macbeth is about greed and ambition, and Walters doesn't know anything more violent than two parents fighting over their child inKramer vs. Kramer.
3. Truth vs. Lie through your teeth, meaning, if you were to catalog your day it would be filled with a lot of mundane and boring truth and the way people really speak is boring, and the elements of personal stories (""but that's what happened"") are not very engaging.
Other ""powerful"" and ""helpful"" things that you haven't heard a thousand times already is
- writer's write too much (too much dialogue, too much description)
- theme comes last, if it comes too early, you will sound intellectual.
This guy LOVES to hear himself talk (I realized this more fully when he mentioned he's a trained speaker) and gives a lttle of WHAT to do but doesn't provide a clue as to HOW to do it. It's like saying, ""if you're going to cook a meal, it should taste good,"" without any suggestions on how to do so along with the obvious suggestion of, ""don't burn it.""
So what does he do to fill up the time on this DVD? Beat every single topic to death by expounding on topics from Einstein, speaking of his personal experiences, anecdotes and stories, and any analogy he can grab to drive the most obvious of points home.
If you just enjoy hearing someone ramble on and on, or you're in junior high and this is your very first step into the world of story, this ""might"" be of some help, with the caveat that just about anything else you buy on screenwriting, even the most basic of books, would be more informative and helpful. Otherwise, skip it.",1205798400,2,3426,4.536348949919224
