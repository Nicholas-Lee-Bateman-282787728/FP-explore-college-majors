8305323,5,B001GGM0LE,"The Goons are timeless! The genius of Spike Milligan is truly outstanding. It is easy to see why the Goons became such a cult in Britain in the 50's and 60's. However, be cautioned! The humour is infectious and before long the listener will soon be walking along muttering ""He's fallen in the water"" or ""you've gotta say Ouw""! Highly recommended for all Goon types and non-sensible people!",1326844800,,389,4.735294117647059
8305324,4,B001GGM0LE,"I did think this was a cd not a dvd.  My fault and when I called they were very nice in explaining.  I will definately pay more attention next time to what I am ordering as this is my first order through Amazon.  Otherwise, everything went fine.",1243296000,,245,4.170212765957447
8305325,4,B001GGM0LE,"This all went out into the ether many years ago and we are very lucky to have access to many if any of these truly brilliantly madcap radio cartoon shows. This diverse collection of shows (mostly from 1956-59) is a consortium from various sources, some home recordings made off the radio(with understandably inconsistant quality), but mostly BBC or CBC, and is a great introduction to the cream of imaginative audio comedy, not equaled since. Solid purchase.",1227052800,,458,5.0394736842105265
