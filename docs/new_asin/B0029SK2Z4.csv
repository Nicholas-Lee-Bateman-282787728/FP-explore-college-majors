3880898,5,B0029SK2Z4,"This DVD Lecture on disc is something good for everyone in the USA to see.  It explains very simply what's happened in our government since WWII, in a great summary of all that's gone on to put our economy in such a terrible way.  If this as it did hold's my undivided attention and the way I enjoyed the interesting description of the times...If I like something like this, I think anyone on the topic would find it interesting and enlightening.",1294704000,20,446,4.493827160493828
3880899,5,B0029SK2Z4,"No Tea Party Member will like this film for they believe all is well with unbridled capitalism but those of us educated folk will get some good arguments from this film for those that do not believe the end of capitalism has finally arrived!  I saw this movie at a church and it was sponsored by a Peace Action group.  Of course it will be labled ""left wing"" the true death knell by all good flag waving Americans who may be mired in credit card debt and behind on the mortgage but still would send their kids to war to save democracy and capitalism.  I would buy this film but I have enough already and he did not tell me anything I did not know already.  All I can say is that he was concise in summarizing the end of capitalism world wide.  It cannot sustain itself anymore.  You can deny that statement but I will be proved right and so will this film.",1284508800,24,856,4.189024390243903
3880900,5,B0029SK2Z4,"Prof. Wolff's excellent lecture is eye-opening and enlightening, easy to understand and fun to listen to.",1273622400,16,105,5.625
3880901,5,B0029SK2Z4,"Whether one is a free market worshiper or a democratic socialist, you will be amused, enlightened and informed about what global market capitalism has brought to the world, who has benefited and who has gotten hurt. Most important you will see why the game of growth and debt is over and will not be cured by a stimulus to create one more bubble that will get us back to the same economy that produced the meltdown. It ends with a remarkably engaging suggestion of what does work in some economic activities. I showed my copy to a group of colleagues and students and got more rave responses than I would have imagined. When I authored ""Who Benefits from Global Violence and War: Uncovering a Destructive System"" I never imagined that the underlying economy that fuels the system could be so clearly and persuasively described as in the DVD, Capitalism Hits the Fan. But Richard Wolff has really hit the button and his humor just adds spice to the message.",1266451200,66,956,4.662721893491124
3880902,4,B0029SK2Z4,This was a very well thought out prospective as what has gone so terribly wrong with so much of our economy. Dr. Wolf makes some very compelling arguments that have changed some of my opinions.  Although I must say I strongly disagree with his final conclusion at the end of it all.,1257897600,6,282,4.423076923076923
3880903,2,B0029SK2Z4,"If you're reasonably well versed in economics Dr. Wolf's somewhat biased recitation of economic history is worth listening to, considering that it's only 90 minutes long and what other information/entertainment is available. But his opinion is controversial and not universally held. Unfortunately Wolf's portrayal of business is more than a little disingenuous. He portrays capitalistic businesses as the villain of his narrative and capitalism as the cause of our current economic woes.  He doesn't acknowledge that business people are only after profits and profits are the pony the pulls the economic cart.

According to Wolf, consumers are the victims of a conspiracy by businesses in which businesses maximized their profits by paying inadequate wages, then loaned those profits back to their employees at usurious interest rates. Wolf doesn't mention the responsibility consumers have for their own economic well being. One might consider that if consumers for any reason choose to live beyond their means, that is an opportunity for profit from banking and money lending businesses to loan them money, and consumers need to act responsibly in the presence of money they can't afford to borrow. It's too much of a stretch to imagine businesses as a whole conspired to keep wages low so they could lend their surplus profits to their workers.

At the end of the lecture Wolf told a story about a group of entrepreneurs from Silicon Valley, where I live, that merrily pooled their resources and started a happy Marxist company where they are all in the process of living happily ever after. The story would be nice except 1) those start-up companies are usually after profit, and are an entrepreneurial throw of the dice with potentially large financial returns, 2) there is not an instance of communism succeeding anywhere at anytime under any circumstances as a long-term viable economic model.

Economics, like many other subjects, is highly subjective. Wolf's is just one opinion. Other opinions worth listening to include Alan Greenspan in the second half of his book, The Age of Turbulence, and Walter Russell Mead in God and Gold, Britain, America and the Making of the Modern World. Both Greenspan and Mead require more than the 90 minutes Wolf's lecture took, but are well worth the time spent on them.",1256947200,12,2316,5.151595744680851
3880904,1,B0029SK2Z4,"Another leftist sociology professor claiming to know economics and, naturally, blaming a supposed free market--one which in reality, is so regulated that it's half socialist. This guy has no idea what caused the crisis. He just says stuff to say it, but his arguments could not hold up under even light scrutiny. Why not argue that an evil being has put a voodoo curse on the world economy? It's just as plausible as Wolff's arguments.",1255305600,8,435,4.8133333333333335
3880905,2,B0029SK2Z4,"Professor Wolff certainly appears like a fascinating speaker and talks like a fire-and-brimstone Baptist preacher at first. He gives lots of interesting facts and thoughts on the current economic mess. However, he speaks with too much assurance that he KNOWS exactly why the economy is messed up. I don't trust ANYONE who speaks like they have all the facts. He has some good points but no final point. After telling us how wages stalled in the 1970s (which I can believe) and how business' took advantage of that to make higher profits (again I find his statements here plausable), he then tells us how business used the profits to make loans back to the workers (well, maybe). When I thought he was going to make a final concluding profound remark I was all ears but he just peters out and walks away. He came to the end saying some Silicon Valley groups are either Marxist and/or examples of the free market at work. There is no way to tell the difference he states. I disagree because these Silicon Valley business' are not in a bubble. They are working in the US society and can get things our economy provides that Marxist groups would have little or no access to. Then he practically shuffles away muttering that basic changes in our system must occur. Well, duh! Even teabaggers, Glenn Beck, Republicans and Democrats would agree on that. So we are left with an interesting hypothesis how we got to where we are but no suggestions on what to do about it. Therefore, the speech is pointless. All we can take from this speech is the thought it was a fairly good Economics 101 class but the bell rang before he finished. In other words, he speaks like every economist: He can tell us what happened in the past, period, the rest is just guessing. In this case, he didn't even give us a good guess what would work to fix our economy, just vague soapbox infomercial-type proclamations. Prozac is recommended to the viewer and the speaker.",1254182400,16,1940,4.626086956521739
3880906,5,B0029SK2Z4,"This is a perfectly presented description in layman's terms of the REAL reasons that recent American culture has led us into the economic situation that we currently find ourselves. This is a rare opportunity for any one who is interested in doing so, to follow a logical explanation by an extrememly educated person, despite his or her own level of familiarity with the topic. Take advantage of this opportunity to quickly get up to speed on what you and every one you know probably don't know. I heard this once through on the radio, and am now able to intelligenlty articulate to friends the reasons behind where we now find ourselves.",1243900800,41,638,4.756756756756757

3880908,4,B0029SK2Z4,"In his thought provoking lecture, Prof. Richard Wolff histotrically reviews and clearly demonstrates how, in our current capiialistic system,  the the economic plight of  American working man has steadily declined in recent decades as compared to that of the nation's industrial CEOs,senior management of our mega-banks and financial institurions, and very wealthiest Americans.  Capitalism's failure to lessen this imbalanced trend could evenually result in both radical changes in our economic system and even undermine our national security.",1373068800,,544,6.038961038961039
3880909,4,B0029SK2Z4,"Did not cover the industrial/military/congress complex enough.

Pointed  to how capitalism as socially visualized skips social interest of right livelihood,
how ""labor"" can own and operate business,
how regulation is defeated by business and congress,
how workers in the ""middle class"" have stagnant wages,
how we allow advertisements and social stereotypes to suck us into leaving beyond our means, and
how the costs of ill health and poor use of debit are passed along from  business to individuals.

When will be take change of our lives more?",1372636800,,546,5.241379310344827
3880910,4,B0029SK2Z4,"This video does a good job of setting out the problem, with our current undemocratic style of capitalism. Too few people at the top (boards & CEOs) make decisions that impact on all the workers, and their communities. It ends too abruptly, however.
It mentions coops as an alternative, but leaves out developing the example of Mondragon, which is an excellent option to greedy, undemocratic capitalism. Adding this would have made it a much better DVD; setting the problem though was done well. Hence, 4 vs 5 stars.",1370390400,,515,4.863636363636363
3880911,2,B0029SK2Z4,"Richard Wolff was much more interesting and concise when being interviewed by Bill Moyer.  His demeaner and presentation on that program is what attracted us.  The DVD we purchased was repetitive and, most disappointing, did not point to practical ideas for solutions either for our legislators or for the general public.",1367020800,3,321,5.2745098039215685

3880913,3,B0029SK2Z4,My husband wanted this book. He read it . The author could point out problems but no solutions. Always easy to find fault.,1365984000,,122,4.3478260869565215
3880914,5,B0029SK2Z4,"Richard Wolff has an ultimate understanding of the subject, and puts it in very easy to understand format. To me, every citizen should view this a few times.",1365724800,3,157,4.642857142857143
3880915,5,B0029SK2Z4,"This is the most intelligent and thoughtful assessment of the current economic malaise -- and of capitalism itself. As a student of the situation with firsthand experience with Hitlerism and Stalinism thrown in for good measure, I have seen no better. Highly recommended.",1365465600,2,271,5.325581395348837
3880916,3,B0029SK2Z4,"Professor Wolff makes a good argument. His points about how we've reached the current sorry economic state are believable. The gradual creep related to ""trickle-down"" tax policy (and why it's so popular) is one of those forehead slappers. He ties the tax policies and other changes (e.g. an increase in the labor force) to flat wages and decreased buying power suffered by the middle and lower economic classes. That part is full of interesting perspectives. His solution for fixing the current problem is less convincing.

Still, for anyone except those who have drunk the Ayn Randian Objectivist Kool-Aid, there's interesting information in this presentation.",1365292800,6,661,5.355769230769231
3880917,5,B0029SK2Z4,"I have noticed many of the negative reviews of Wolff's presentation were not intelligent and rational critical arguments with the points he made, but, instead, they were exercises in name-calling, faux outrage and derision.

One does not make a case for an argument by ranting and raving charging that the speaker is a socialist or communist.  Anyway, none of the ranters-and-ravers know what those terms actually mean.

Historically, socialists fought to expand political democracy into economic democracy.  Why?  They figured since the wealth of society is produced by the formal and informal labor of workers, the working class should have democratic control over the wealth THEY produced.

In turn, because the wealthy gain their wealth through ownership (businesses, banks, property, assets, etc.), they should not have dictatorial control over the wealth generated by those whose work actually produced that wealth.

What is today labeled communism has more to do with impoverished nations attempting to gain independent control over their economies which previously had been underdeveloped because their economies had been dominated by Western banks and corporations (allied with the local national economic and political oligarchies).

In other words, the social wealth of these nations had been externally exported to wherever these corporations and banks were headquartered.  Again, the workers who actually produced this wealth were left with very little after most of it was exported.

Unfortunately, the communist party elites of most of these nations eventually wished to gain more wealth and power and thus eventually sloughed off the national command economy for the easy pickings offered by Western banks and corporations.

Manytimes, these ex-communist elites would exploit their strategic positions within the command economy to either sell off state assets to Western banks and corporations for firesale prices or they, themselves, would simply steal these state assets for themselves.

Of course, the rest of the population found that their standard of living sank into the lower regions of hell.",1364083200,2,2117,5.58125
3880918,5,B0029SK2Z4,"This is a great lecture that reminds us that Karl Marx would not be at all surprised at how deregulated capitalism is so good at imploding in only a few decades.  So ok ok Marx's utopian solution fantasies don't work, we get it, enough already, but you cannot deny that the self destructive nature of capitalism was not analysed by Marx in excruciating detail and that Sept 18 2008 proved him right in his analysis.  Professor Wolff argues persuasively that we always will need a New Deal type of structure to regulate capitalism to keep it from destroying itself by decoupling labor's productivity from wages to increase profits.",1347321600,9,630,4.824074074074074

3880920,1,B0029SK2Z4,"All he does is run down capitalism and promotes socialism. Socialism does not work. Go back thru history, it has never worked. Capitalism is what made this country great. No system is perfect but, capitalism is the best.",1334966400,6,220,4.815789473684211
3880921,5,B0029SK2Z4,"One of the best lecturers I've ever heard, he uses humor and everyday situations to illustrate some complex economic ideas.  He makes it easy to understand the causes of the market crash in 2009, why it's defferent from the Great Depression, and how we can choose, as consumers, to avoid another recession.  A few charts, easy to understand. He ends with a thought-provoking idea about using Marxian economics to build a stronger economy. Everyone I shared this with enjoyed it and had new revelations about why things happen in the labor market.",1334620800,8,546,4.923913043478261
3880922,1,B0029SK2Z4,"I believe much of what went wrong with the economy might just as well be assigned our education system.  Why in the world would a college hire a communist to teach economics?  A well educated fool remains a fool.  Don't waste your money on his misguided concepts, buy a book by Hayek instead, or Henry Hazlitt's ""Economics In One Lesson"" which accurately foretold the current inevitable outcome of government sponsored mortgage lending - in 1946!  This entire ""crisis"" was completely unnecessary, sadly, and the ""cause"" had little to do with the structual deficit of Capitalism, as Wolff suggests.",1325548800,9,597,5.061224489795919

I thought the DVD would have more information than what I could find online, but there is not that much other information available.  It could be there is more information in the book.  I was looking for some ideas in terms of a solution.  There is really not much there.  I thought the lecture was spot on historically and valuble to listen to.",1323388800,8,407,4.36

3880925,5,B0029SK2Z4,"I was born into a world of corrupt politicians, during the Kennedy assassination & the big Nixon Watergate scandal, so all I've ever known is how screwed up our own government is. I stopped watching mainstream television in the late 80's - and recently only watch documentary films, since they seem to be more of the real news that we are not getting in the media. This DVD ended up in my hands this past weekend and I am very thankful. It is an eye opener, big time. It is very informative and explains a lot of what I didn't understand. I highly recommend this film.",1318809600,10,568,4.367924528301887
3880926,5,B0029SK2Z4,"""Capitalism Hits The Fan"" is a captivating lecture on our economic meltdown, where it began, how we got to where we are. He makes a few suggestions at the end, but he needs to put out another video detailing all the possible solutions!  Watching this video is a revelation!  He explains it to where the problem is crystal clear and easily understandable by anyone. Our corporate capitalism, as it is currently structured, can not continue much longer. If it does, we will all suffer the lingering depression that Japan has undergone for the last 14 years. There is no way out other than to restructure! You can't buy your way out; you can't borrow your way out; you cannot stimulate your way out. The problem is unsolvable in its current structure. The only way to solve it is to change the structure. Corporate capitalism has done this to itself. We benefited as a nation from fortunate events where for three decades, we were the world's producer. No more. The rest of the world has caught up after a devestating WW-II that destroyed their economies and means of production. The entire world is now in for a lingering depression if we do not change the structure. And if certain unpredictable events happen, it could be catastropic!

Every intelligent person in the world should see this video. It will definitely open eyes wide.",1298937600,17,1331,4.753246753246753
