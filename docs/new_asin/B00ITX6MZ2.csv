6297251,5,B00ITX6MZ2,"Beautiful film about a man of God, and rarer still, a man who was not afraid to stand up to tyranny. Cardinal Joseph Mendszenty from Hungary was another priest who had the courage to stand up to bullies. Two films for you to see. To Kill A Priest-1984 about Father Jerzy Popieluszko from Poland.  Guilty Of Treason about Cardinal Joseph Mendszenty.",1421366400,,348,4.704918032786885

6297254,5,B00ITX6MZ2,"So very pleased with this purchase and the seller. Excellent quality DVD and received it in less than 4 days ! Now for the dvd content---- not only a moving story of a 20th century martyr, but a great documentary of Poland's struggles post WWII ! Makes you wonder what Churchill and Roosevelt were thinking when they handed Poland over to Stalin at Yalta! That aside, one wonders why Fr. Jerzy has not been canonized and a Pope was fast tracked to sainthood ahead of him. The church has some 'splaining to do about that.",1402876800,8,520,4.484210526315789
6297255,5,B00ITX6MZ2,"This is an amazing documentary that not only shines a light on the life of this brave messenger of the truth but on the birth and growth of the Solidarity movement.  The live footage of Bl. Jerzy, his sermons, and the events surrounding him were stunning - and something I've never seen before.  Very well done.",1398211200,8,311,4.535714285714286
6297256,5,B00ITX6MZ2,"I caught this program about a third of the way in when it aired in my area.  I was glued to the television.

In 1984 I was 19 years old and entirely absorbed in my own life.  I don't recall this happening in what would have seemed to me to be on another planet.  Shame on me.  I crumbled in tears at the images of this amazing holy priest, beaten and tortured to death.

Buy this - you can get it on the PBS website until Amazon has it available.  Watch it with your family, and truly understand what Fr Jerzy was all about - not only politically, but spiritually as well.  Really *get it* when he talks about freedom, and how we should react to tyranny.

I can't wait to own this so I can watch it start to finish - I can't recommend it enough.

Pray for us, Blessed Father Jerzy - pray for this broken world.",1397520000,31,810,4.037735849056604
6297257,5,B00ITX6MZ2,"This is an excellent documentary about Fr. Jerzy Popieluszlo, who was born in Poland in 1947 and died a martyr's death in 1984.

He was a great spiritual leader for the members and families of Solidarity.  His work with the people drew every increasing crowds to Mass and drew strong criticism from the government.  Watching this DVD I was reminded of how we take our freedom of speech and freedom of religion for granted.

Fr. Popieluszlo was declared Blessed in 2010 and hopefully his canonization will soon follow.  This is a great DVD and I highly recommend it.",1396224000,17,565,4.724489795918367
6297258,5,B00ITX6MZ2,"One man changes the entire face of his nation, instills hope in his fellow country men, strikes terror in the hearts of their oppressors and brings about the demise of an entire regime. An ordinary man, of no physical prowess or exceptional looks. His weapon? Truth.

This documentary based on the book ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Priest-and-the-Policeman-The-Courageous-Life-and-Cruel-Murder-of-Father-Jerzy-Popieluszko/dp/0671618962/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Priest and the Policeman: The Courageous Life and Cruel Murder of Father Jerzy Popieluszko</a>&nbsp;focuses on the life of Blessed Jerzy and his mission. It does not so much focus on his early life as most biopics do,though it has a brief mention on his boyhood days and his stint in the Soviet Polish army which was mandatory, where we see him unbending in compromising his principles; but mostly concentrates on his activity in the 'Solidarnoszc' movement and how he galvanizes his fellow men to fight the injustices of the communist regime that tries to deprive them of their rights of liberty, conscience and religion.

The viewer gets a feel for the tumultuous times in the 1980's when Poland was at the brink and the desire of the Polish people to be free of tyranny, There is an ominous feel about this documentary that can at times weigh heavily on the viewer. But just imagine, what would it have been really like to live in such conditions? This DVD takes us step by step into those troubled times, with pertinent interviews of Roger Boyes and John Moody who co-authored the aforementioned book, Cardinal Jozef Glemp, former Primate of Poland, Cardinal Stanislaw Dziwisz, the personal secretary of Pope John Paul II and Lech Walesa, the first democratically elected President of Poland and leader of 'Solidarnosz', as well as a host of others who associated and collaborated with Fr. Jerzy. Also Fr. Popieluszko's brother, sister and nephew make an appearence.

It is replete with archival footage from those times. And we get to see and hear Fr. Jerzy himself.

This DVD itself does not have any scene selections however there are chapters entitled as follows:
Fr. Jerzy Popieluszko; Warsaw, Poland September 1984
Pope John Paul II June 2nd, 1979
Fr. Jerzy's first Mass at the Huta Warsaw Steel Mill August 31st, 1980
Solidarity August 31st, 1980
Martial Law December 13th, 1981
Masses for the Fatherland February 28th, 1982
Murder of Grzegorz Prezemyk May 12th, 1983
On the road to Warsaw, October 19th, 1984 leading to the discovery of his body on October 30th 1984.
Beatification June 6th, 2010

This documentary has a foreword by Cardinal Dolan of New York and is narrated by Martin Sheen.

I take exception to one thing though. There is a part when the narrator stated that an article appeared in the Soviet newspaper 'Izvestia' condemning Fr. Popieluszko, and that the '....the Russians were taking notice'. I would like to comment the Russians were a nation equally oppressed as the Poles were under this regime, and that the Soviet government of the USSR did not reflect the views or aspirations of the Russian people. I think this is an insult and an affront to the ordinary Russian people. A difference HAS to be made with regard to 'SOVIET' and 'RUSSIAN' : two VERY DIFFERENT ENTITIES. This would probably explain the antipathy the West has for Russia due to its inability to differentiate the two.

I would like to add a caveat though. This documentary has actual footage of brutality by the Polish Soviet militia and the photos of Blessed Jerzy's tortured body is particularly disturbing.

To conclude  I would like to use Blessed Popieluszko's own words: ""The role of the priest is to proclaim the truth, suffer for the truth and if necessary even die for the truth.....Thank you!""

For a movie on this Blessed I recommend a wonderful, tastefully done film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Popieluszko-Freedom-is-Within-Us/dp/B00BYCOIU6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Popieluszko: Freedom is Within Us</a>

This film is approximately 90 minutes long in English, with portions in Polish, where English subtitles are used. No special features are on this DVD.
