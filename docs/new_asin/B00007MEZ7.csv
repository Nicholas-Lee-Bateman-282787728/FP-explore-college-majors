7978707,4,B00007MEZ7,"Ok, let's be honest, Hook N Shoot looks like they conduct their fights down at the local high school gym.  It ain't no Vegas venue with the flashy lights and the kickin' music.  But what you do get is a glimpse into the up and coming stars on their way to the UFC and other larger fight series.  This DVD starts with a great, action packed, technical fight won by a great American by the name of John ""the Saint"" Renken. His opponent was good ,too, but John's experience won the day.  This opening bout set the stage for the follow-on fights, which all proved to be well-fought, entertaining matches.  One criticism for Hook N Shoot comes from the gloves the fighters wear.  The ref was good, the square ring is fine, but I really think the glove selection reduces the potential devastation being unleashed by these warriors.  Maybe they're too padded.  I don't know.  There were a couple knockouts on the DVD, but I didn't see the fighters wince in pain when a solid body blow was administered.  I think that's because of the gloves.

  As far as the production values...well, it looked like it was video taped by a couple of guys with Handycams they picked up from WalMart.  The post production work was OK, but the music was cheesy and poorly dubbed.  The DVD could also stand to have some extras like pre- and post-fight interviews.  Also, much like what Pride does, include a brief bit about the history of the Hook N Shoot francise and a little about the area in which the fight was held.  Town information, fighter profiles, compelling stories leading up to the fights would all be nice to have.  When you start the DVD you get...ding,ding...round one, FIGHT!

  Overall, I enjoyed the DVD and will probably purchase another one in the future.",1152144000,,1750,4.580645161290323
