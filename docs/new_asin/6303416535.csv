7846027,3,6303416535,"Good info but presented in a dry and boring way. There are many scenes and exact dialogue lines that are repeated throughout, and slightly elaborated on each time, but not exactly in a logical way. Sometimes I found myself checking my dvd drive to make sure my computer wasn't skipping back to previous points in the film, because the scenes and lines were seriously being exactly repeated.
So... I like it but... not thrilled about it.",1371600000,,436,4.75
7846028,5,6303416535,"We used this for a unit study on the Middle Ages. I was pleasantly surprised by the variety presented. Some topics covered: armor utility and fashion, socio-economic status of knights, heraldry past and present, Bayeux Tapestry in context of the general history of knights in the feudal system, tournaments. My daughters are 6 & 9 and enjoyed watching this. I did stop the video and explain some parts because sometimes the inferences or references were unclear or unknown to my children. There were two parts that contained violent images that they preferred not to watch, but these were short. My husband and I also enjoyed the video.",1358726400,2,636,4.953271028037383
7846029,5,6303416535,"A & E did this wonderful introduction to Knights, Armour and all that jazz, presenting it in a very straight forward, non-sensational manner.  It gives you a ""knight-eye"" view of the armour from inside out, focusing on the rise of William Marshall.

Absolute must for anyone interested in the topic or for people looking real feel for the period such as writers of historical fiction or SCA en-actors.

Knights dress through the periods, and an excellent visit to the Graz Collection in Austria.

These needs re-issuing on DVD.",1126051200,10,527,4.954545454545454
7846030,5,6303416535,"This is an excellent overview of Knights, Armour, Castles, Chivalry and I believe would be an excellent present for anyone interested in these subjects, for example, young boys (who all love these things) or historians.

Although a documentary necessarily lacks the depth of books, it is a great overview and has many interesting bits of information. Even for someone who has studied all of these topics in depth, and who can find a few errors here and there, the presentation and material is interesting and well done.",1123632000,15,519,4.9655172413793105
7846031,5,6303416535,"This is not the normal glorified account of knights put together by people who know little about the subject, but a well researched video done in the manner that would be expected by a better English production company. It reaveals a lot that most people do not know about knights. The only issue that I would have with it is that there is little on what was happening outside of England. Still one of the better historical videos I have seen.",1080950400,14,443,4.481481481481482
