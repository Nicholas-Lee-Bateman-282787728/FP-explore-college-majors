8372661,4,B002LFPAMK,"This is not really a horror film; it's more like a Roy Rogers adventure with horror trappings.  Nicely made, easy to follow, certainly suitable for children.  CasaNegra did a great job putting this out.  English dubbed soundtrack is optional, and I think it's got English subtitles too.",1488067200,,286,5.042553191489362
8372662,2,B002LFPAMK,"Not much to recommend here: this one has a few elements reminiscent of ""El vampiro"" (the ghostly woman walking through dark corridors, the evil surrounding the dark hacienda in contrast to the sunny exteriors, humor combined with terror) but director Fernando M&eacute;ndez and screenwriter Ram&oacute;n Ob&oacute;n had collaborated in better efforts before. Ob&oacute;n would still write a few good horror scripts, but M&eacute;ndez stopped directing movies two years later, after making a routine western diptych and a formulaic melodrama. The leading man (swinger Gast&oacute;n Santos, rich son of the big se&ntilde;or of his hometown, in real life) is prettier than the whole cast, but everybody acts better than him. He plays some kind of lone ranger and detective who arrives at a gloomy hacienda where an old woman (Hortensia Santove&ntilde;a) lives afraid of her dead sister's spell, objecting all intents by her young niece (Mar&iacute;a Duval) to make life happier in the country side.  The few persons remaining in a once prosperous town now live in fright of the vengeful Llorona (Crying Woman), who is somehow connected to the town doctor, two statues sculptured on a strange stone, a deadly swamp and killer cowboys. Santos is a good rider though and his horse Rayo de Plata also plays a key role in the plot, while Pedro de Aguill&oacute;n as a sidekick in the lines of a Sancho Panza, adds lines and slapstick here and there, intended to be funny. But the action lacks the right spirit, be it comedy or horror, in spite of Gustavo C&eacute;sar Carri&oacute;n's funny effort to add galloping beats to his score. Nothing said if you care for terror westerns with intelligent horses and haunted swamps. Then this is for you.",1473724800,,1737,5.094736842105263
8372663,4,B002LFPAMK,"This is a movie where an obvious, effeminate Spaniard pretends to be a Mexican cowboy out to save a town from a ghost. It gets more fun from there like the 60s flash lights in a western or his never dirty clothes. Actually, they got a ton of electricity in this version of the wild west complete with alarm systems. It's fun. Not deep but very fast paced. I can't say much more without giving away stuff but honestly the surprises in store will give almost anyone more than a few giggles.",1466380800,2,488,4.315217391304348
8372664,1,B002LFPAMK,"A man on a white horse rides into town looking for the woman that carved a statue. She is dead. The doctor has one too. Dead woman is said to be haunting the swamp, yet at the same time she is kept dead by jamming a knife into a perfectly good clock.

Yes, we do get to see the dead woman. Boring film.

8372665,5,B002LFPAMK,"Pretty good Mexican made horror film.  A cowboy and his sidekick stop off at a hacienda to ask about a carving of a crying woman he received that came from there.  1. The occupants don't give him much info about the figurine. 2. The folks there act all freaked out and walk on eggs.  3. The rancho is as creepy, gloomy, and doomy as any haunted house hunter would wish for.  That would be more of a tip-off anyone would need to make tracks away from there.  The cowboy sticks around to help the young heiress solve all her haunted, cursed house problems.  Very entertaining and only 71 minutes long so it doesn't wear out its welcome.  The Casa Negra DVD has both the Spanish-language and the English-dubbed versions included.  The picture and color is fine and as good as one can get.  Any Casa Negra DVD release is worth getting.  Only a few of these Mexican-made horror films were released by them.  I hope they release more someday.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1406419200,3,957,4.5321637426900585
8372666,3,B002LFPAMK,"What's not to love?  A  Mexican 'ranchera' horror movie western, with the hero dressed in immaculate near-white (even after pulling himself from a filthy swamp), a Mantan Morland-type sidekick (who quivers and goes bug-eyed at each 'ghostly' apparition, hiding from danger and moaning and groaning about how he just wants to go to sleep),  a special appearance by the uniquely Mexican horror movie villainess, 'La 'Llorona,' (the ghost of a woman searching for her missing children...  'Ayyyy, mis hijos!!!') and a white palomino stallion (Caballo de Plata) who comes to the aid of his master time and again, saving him from all sorts of perilous situations.  The list goes on and on.  50s horror flick fans will also spot sets left over from the made-in-Mexico classic 'Beast of Hollow Mountain,' also shot on the Churubusco Studios backlot in 1956.  Unfortunately, there are no abrupt cuts to wrestling matches and or lengthy 'ranchera' musical interludes.",1376006400,4,958,5.181818181818182
8372667,1,B002LFPAMK,"Disappointing film in the Casanegra series. The mixture of cowboys, walking corpses, bandits and weak attempts at comedy makes for a boring mismatch. The attempt to weave this story into a mystery falls way short and predictable. In addition, the colors in this print are dull and reminiscent of the B/W films that were ""colorized.""  There are much better films in this series; this one should have stayed buried.",1209772800,2,413,4.9855072463768115
8372668,4,B002LFPAMK,"During the 1950s, producer Alfredo Ripstein lensed a series of films around successful horseback matador Gaston Santos. Generally rurales entries, three in particular (EL GRITO DE LA HUERTE, EL PANTANO DE LAS ANIMAS and LA FLECHA ENVENENNADA, emerged as quirky ""PERIOD"" mysteries. the LIVING COFFIN (EL GRITO DE LA MUERTE) reteams Gaston with comic relief Pedro de Aguilln in the mystery surrounding an isolated hacienda and a corpse which vanishes from its tomb.

Nicely atmospheric in places.

Santos, never overly impressed with film work, admits to never having seen any of his handful of films in its entirety through.",1177459200,6,623,5.282828282828283
