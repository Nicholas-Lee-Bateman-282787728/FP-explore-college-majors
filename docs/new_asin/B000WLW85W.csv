8223666,3,B000WLW85W,"When I ordered this DVD with the picture of the twisted conical helix on the cover, I thought there would be instructions for the model.  Apparently in order to get instructions to make the more elaborate models shown, I should have ordered the book ""Folding circle Tetrahedra"" .  I will update again when I receive this book and see if there are instructions in the book for the models.
