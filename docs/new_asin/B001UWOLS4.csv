3813518,1,B001UWOLS4,"Not sure if this is a hoax perpetrated on the unsuspecting viewer?  If so, just who is laughing?  If you take a video camera and just shoot your friends or even strangers in their random conversations and do no editing whatsoever my guess is that your finished film (you must stop at 94 minutes) will be better than ""LYING.""

This film would make a great double feature with ""GERRY.""  The one about the two guys named Gerry who get lost in the desert.  And then one Gerry kills the other Gerry.  Ooops, hope I didn't spoil it for anyone.

This is a double loss.  The time wasted watching this is lost forever and you probably can't return it to get your money back.  Life can be so unfair but why waste it on really, really, really, really, really bad movies?",1242086400,8,759,4.364285714285714
3813519,1,B001UWOLS4,"I have only been burned twice in the last six years in how I research ordering for my store. Welcome to the 2nd. The same reviews shown here got planted/pasted at numerous sites on the Internet, supplemented by a couple others from crew members to make this sound like a masterpiece.

At approximately 22 minutes into the film I decided to do the research to see what went wrong on me even paying for this mess. We have a story about four women uniting at a country home for unknown reasons and with unknown motives. Throw in some horrible hand-held camera work, bad film quality, characters you learn nothing about or why they are even talking to each other, senseless dialogue, boring performances and voila: 94 non-returnable minutes.

I even tried to get this from the point of view of my customers having a ladies night or wanting to see something edgy or fascinating. Nothing I listed could qualify for that. Yes, I am pissed I wasted money for a movie most customers will find boring, meaningless and poorly written - but even as into minimalist films as I am - this is a definite skipper.

DVD: Todd Haynes' interview of M and the commentary are a double dose of furtherance into this film, so if you enjoyed this, it makes it a purchase item, otherwise be careful on this one.

Edit: The reviews have been removed (at least at the moment) - so in case one is wondering what the heck I am babbling about, I swear there were two other reviews here...",1242000000,19,1457,4.507575757575758
3813600,2,B001UWOLS4,"Overall, an incredibly boring and uninspiring film.
The story follows a group of young attractive women who spend a weekend together in the country, to relax and unwind, possibly bond (on some level I couldn't figure out as I watched).
You have a beautiful setting, and great talent in the movie.  So what went wrong?
Well, I'm glad you asked.  Weak story and and poor characters would be my answer.  Frankly, a waste of money and good talent.
If you're going to bring a bunch of characters together, then there needs to be a point, for growth for revelations for something to happen that drives the drama and action of the story forward. You could have even made Chloe's character a serial killer, and turned the movie in a totally new direction. And no, it's not that aliens needed to make an appearance, just that there was no drama.  Something needed to happen and nothing did.
A sad unfortunate let down.
I would not, repeat not, buy this for my collection.",1330041600,,962,4.608187134502924
3813601,1,B001UWOLS4,This movie was completely pointless. The costumes were terrible.  The continuity was absent. Definitely do not recommend spending any time watching this at all.,1328227200,,160,5.666666666666667
3813602,3,B001UWOLS4,"Although several of the reviewers were disappointed with the film, I found it at least interesting from a film-making perspective.  The scenery of rural New York (near the Berkshires) is beautiful, as is the house they used during filming.  Everything, including the weather, is sort of gauzy and quiet (very little music in the film).  It's true that the plot (if it can be called that), is loose at best, so do not watch this film expecting a significant story. The gist, as I understood it: a woman invites a friend from yoga and two interns (?? they're college students ""working"" for the hostess) to her country home. Over the course of the movie, the hostess tells her guests that her parents died, left her money with which, it is implied, she built the house.  None of the women seem to know each other very well; a point that is underscored by the seemingly pointless but repeated lies/untruths told by the hostess. (The story is not revealed entirely in chronological order.)

If you enjoy cinma vrit and the opportunity to observe, there are worse ways to spend ninety minutes than letting this quiet little film wash over you.",1314489600,6,1137,4.722222222222222
3813603,5,B001UWOLS4,"Hi, so you guys have heard that this movie is boring and you are checking out the reviews for any signs of this, well they're wrong this film is great but I will say you need to watch it maybe twice to get the full effect because it has non-linear scenes and you need to watch it in full to get the full story and once you do that watch it again and you will have a better idea what's going on....and for me, I love this film and the soundtrack, so rent or buy it cause it deserves to be seen and talked about.",1309651200,5,510,3.8666666666666667
3813604,1,B001UWOLS4,"I love independent films, and I love Chloe Sevigny, Leelee Sobieski, and Jena Malone, so I was super excited when I discovered this movie with all 3 of them (!) while poking around on Netflix.  I streamed it so I could watch it right away.  Now I wish I could get back the last 2 hours of my life (and it takes a LOT for me to say that about a movie).  The problem is NOTHING HAPPENED!  Seriously.  For 2 hours.  And I'm not saying this in an our-country-is-so-ADD-that-we-need-constant-action-for-something-to-be-even-remotely-interesting kind of way.  I mean NOTHING HAPPENED at all in this movie.  I'm not sure why I didn't just turn it off 30 minutes into the movie, but I guess I just kept thinking something would happen and kept waiting for that moment.  Plus, I only get to stream one movie/month on my Netflix plan, and I didn't want to feel like I wasted that.  But I did anyway, it seems.  I seriously can't figure out how 3 such relatively big stars all agreed to do this movie.",1294963200,2,990,4.536723163841808
3813605,2,B001UWOLS4,"I agree with much of what has been said by the other reviewers. I am, however, in a more relaxed place because I spent $1 for this movie at a video store going out of business. So, I am not angered by the outlay of cash, as others were. The movie was OK and made sense only after I watched the interview of the director in the Special Features. I believe there is some substance to this tale, and not an altogether waste. I was struck by how sexless the movie is. The actresses are neither sensual nor interested in sex. Why would a group of women, alone, not talk about sex or men(or women)? Lee Lee Sobieski's talents were wasted in this movie. I could see Jena Malone trying to make things happen. I will probably watch it again to see if I agree with my own remarks. If Lying is accepted by Criterion Collection, I will seriously doubt my own judgment.",1277164800,3,856,4.257668711656442
3813606,4,B001UWOLS4,"I fell in love with the trailer from M. Blash's Lying the first time I saw it, but after reading the reviews on here I expected the worst. It really is a delicate little film, but yes, with some underwritten parts that can feel a tad awkward. That said, it's just a nice little escape to a country farmhouse. I probably wouldn't have given it much of a chance if I didn't really love the actresses in it but it really does have its moments. There's one scene in particular, that really is one of the most memorable scenes I can remember seeing in a film in quite awhile and is almost worth any dullness that one might feel they'd have to endure.
If you're the type who really can get wrapped up in a setting, this movie feels every bit the place you experience in the photos or trailer. For me that was enough to enjoy it.",1254700800,4,822,4.208860759493671
3813607,2,B001UWOLS4,"I really wanted to like Lying. I like Chloe Sevigny. I like Jenna Malone. I like artsy movies. I like women. However, I quickly felt perplexed, confused and bored by the movie. And no, I'm not a Hollywood film junkie--about 90% of the films I love are independent and foreign films. Lying was pretentious and pointless. It was filmed with a hand-held camera and contained a minimal soundtrack, which gave it an unsettling air of reality and, along with the contrived and forced behavior of the characters, added to a sense of tension. But the story was at times surreal and precious, which didn't match the film's style and just added to the muddled confusion--was this a symbolic tale? Was I supposed to see the characters' actions and (few) words as allegory for something? If so, what? The dress-up scene felt painfully artificial, something an adolescent boy might imagine for a girls' sleepover. The dialogue was vapid and unrealistic. The way the film's ""secret"" was revealed was vague and unemotional and left me wondering if I really ""got"" it, but worse, left me realizing I didn't care whether I got it or not.",1249171200,3,1119,4.803108808290156
3813608,1,B001UWOLS4,"The talented cast is what caught my attention.  Unfortunately the film didn't do anything for me.  It's too darn boring.  I don't mind student or art films, but this film had nothing to keep me interested in watching it a second time.",1247184000,3,234,4.523809523809524
3813609,5,B001UWOLS4,"Sometimes the best sign of really affecting art is a response of strong opinions. LYING seems to be a deeply rewarding exploration for some, and a polarizing experience for others. I urge people to see this as an attraction and not a deterrent... because what it means is that LYING has somehow bypassed the filter of the ""system"" that tries to condition films to fit the mold of what studios think the vague, broad audience wants. It is a rare example of creative liberation on the part of the filmmaker. So what you are getting is a film that does not treat you (the viewer) as a child, with easy plot points, melodrama or on the button literal ""meanings"" to things. On the contrary, M Blash treats us with a great deal of respect for our intelligence, and seems to be confident in us as viewers to cull our own experiences to find poignancy in his characters and images.

LYING is a fantastic mystery film, of the rarest kind. The type that explores the unsolvable mysteries of human behavior, relationships and interactions. The clues are all in the gestures, the tone of voice, the phrasings, in eyes and on the faces of these four women, and it is exciting to watch because of strong and etherial performances from Jena Malone, Chloe Sevigny, Halley Wegryn Gross, Maya Goldsmith and Leelee Sobieski. Not to mention beautiful, hazy cinematography that is imperfect, yes, but rich with texture and a fitting rawness.

Lying is of course, the central theme. The different ways that people lie to each other, particularly in adulthood, that makes us question how well we really know our friends and acquaintances around us. But while LYING does provoke you to contemplate why people lie, it's focus is on HOW people lie. Blash's film does not try to force a moral stance or a definitive statement about lying down your throat. It's up to you to figure out the ""why"", and decide what levels of falsehood you are willing to live with and what has gone too far.

The search for the singing voice is an amazing scene. It is the centerpiece of LYING, by far the most memorable sequence, and so powerful when we see Sevigny's character sitting back and marveling over the hysterics her lies have created.

A double feature with Van Sant's GERRY? I literally can not think of a greater compliment for this film.",1242777600,9,2306,4.672413793103448
8345256,5,B001UWOLS4,"This is a wonderfully escapist film in that it totally captures what it is like to be at a large country house, inn, bed and breakfast, for the weekend, with some other people you may not know or like very well. if you have ever been a guest in a country house in Connecticut, or Mendocino, or the Vineyard, or if you have ever been a host, the film recreates many of these experiences, strong deja vu.

I watched the dvd in total silence up close to the screen, and kept hearing people sitting next to me in an imaginary audience, asking, ""Who's that?"" or""Is that the same woman?"" And I kept wanting to say, ""Sssssssshhhhhhh! Just watch the film!"" because it is that kind of film. It is like life, into which we are dropped or walk in on a scene and have to work it out, as opposed to someone telling you a well-laid-out story, though by the end, this story is pretty well laid out, and concluded, all questions answered.

Some suggest that Chloe Sevigny's character is a sociopath, perhaps, but a closer reading might be that she is a film director of sorts, and that the weekend in this house is just an experiment, as to what will happen, and how people will react to what she is putting on, as they become actors in her pre-arranged scenario. A sort of cinema verite theater of the absurd.

And in so creating this game/drama, Chloe's character precipitates a host of behaviors on the part of the other guests/participants, which we are shown, revealing how the other characters, who would proclaim their innocence, are all involved in some degree of dishonesty, manipulation, cheating, or outright lying; which makes the conclusion seem ironic indeed, or highly predictable, as consistent with hypocritical human nature (""We are always innocent, the others are always at fault."")

In fact, Chloe's character is the only one who caught in a lie, readily confesses, as if that were part of the drama all along, though it doesn't seem to be appreciated by the, therefore, demonstrably less honest, guests.

If you want thrillers or romantic comedy, or funny jokes and laughs, this is not your film. If you want to watch a somewhat controlling woman, Chloe Sevigny, manipulate some of her acquaintances, and test the limits of manipulation, you might find this interesting, and I also found the setting enticing.",1514246400,,2314,4.717821782178218

8345258,3,B001UWOLS4,"Movie seems to have no point however it keeps you interested b/c you want to see what's going to happen. Bought it b/c it has Chloe Sevigny in it, she's beautiful and a good actress, especially in If These Walls Could Talk 2!!!",1462320000,,227,4.3023255813953485

Yes there are female characters like the one played by Chloe Sevigny.  Women who lie just for the sake of lying building up their image a bit but the movie went no further to develop the plot or character.",1451865600,,508,4.361702127659575

8345262,2,B001UWOLS4,"OK. I'm watching this film right now and it is nearly over. I couldn't stand it any more and HAD to look and see what others thought of the film, because I just wasn't getting it.

But it turns out there is NOTHING to get! I would love to talk to someone who loved this film. What did you love? Specifically, what about this film made you rate it high? My suspicion is that a good percentage of lovers of this film could NOT tell you why. I suspect they liked the film because they were ""supposed"" to like it. You know?

The movie is called Lying. We the audience don't know what the lie is for a long time. I'm still not sure and the film is almost over. One woman is apparently deceiving the other three she's invited to her ""country home"" for the weekend. But we don't know why, and the clues are sparsely few and far between. We catch the occasional sideways glance the hostess gives her guests. We know she's up to something, but what? Does she want to make love to her guests? That is what's suggested, as they are young, lovely and nymph like, showing a lot of skin as they move lightly around the property. No, that's not it. Well then she must want to murder them in their bedrooms overnight? A bloody, torturous round robin death scene. Nope. This movie should be shown in film school as an example of weak exposition. The writer/director does not ""expose"" the story. That's what's missing. That, and a plot. It's OK if the film does not want to do sex and violence. But it has to do something. You can't just run laps, even in an art house film. You gotta go *somewhere*.

Plus, it's one thing for the audience to be in the position of the three house guests; not knowing. But even when the girls figure out the lie it's STILL not clear what it is.

And if it's what I think it is.... well, so what?

The movie is beautifully shot. The house it takes place in is marvelous. I want to build a house just like it. The acting is good. And, it's got the enigmatic and always intriguing Chloe Sevigny (Chloe, if you're reading this I fell in  love with you in Broken Flowers. Wow. Only kidding. Kind of. :>). Wait! As a matter of fact, if you haven't seen Broken Flowers (Bill Murray stars), then that is a film for you! It doesn't really go anywhere either, but it at least makes a point, and the exposition is beautifully done. (Chloe only has a cameo but it is unforgettable)

But don't pretend to like this movie just because you don't get it but think you should. Let all the bad reviews give you permission to be honest. And honestly, this movie is a waste of time.

UPDATE: OK. I watched the ending. Completely stupid. But wouldn't you know... there's a commentary track! Have you even noticed the weaker a film is, the greater the chance it will have a director's commentary? I think I'll pass on this one though. Gonna cut my losses.",1407024000,,2848,4.310280373831776
8345263,1,B001UWOLS4,"Ok, this is just a terrible movie. I knew that going into this. But what, or who rather, I expected to see in this movie was Leelee Sobieski. The cover and trailer to this movie is just very misleading. She is just a neighbor of Sevingy's character who waves flags around to get her attention, and seeing she can't, stops by for a short time maybe twice. That's it. She is not a main character whatsoever or even important. They are very awkward scenes and I couldn't even make sense of them. But that pretty much sums up the whole movie.

The main reason I rented this though, wasn't mainly for Sobieski but for Anthony Roth Costanzo's role, who is now a distinguished and famous counter tenor. And one of my most favorite opera singers. I loved his role as Francis (which he won an award for) in ""A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries"" (also with Leelee Sobieski.) So I wanted to see him in this movie, ""Lying,"" as well. After watching this very very boring movie for some time anxiously waiting for him, I suddenly heard him singing out of nowhere at a random part. He sounded to be coming from outside the house, and with Sevingy's character not letting them go outside, all 4 girls end up running around the house trying to find out him and where this voice is coming from. Sometimes it sounds like he is in the house, in different places. So the whole scene just shows them frantically running around, while Sevingy's character ends up just standing at the fireplace with her glass of wine just watching and laughing at them. After a whole 5 minutes of this, she finally tells them that ""he's in the fireplace"" and they rush to see. He sings one last time. And that was that. He is never seen or heard again. His voice was beautiful and it was a fun scene at first but then it just became quite spooky and weird like he was a ghost. When asked if she knew who or what it was, she tells the girls ""no."" Of course, she has a lot of secrets. They have a hard time believing this at first, but they all finally relax. One of the girls decides he should have a name, and picked out ""Timothy."" So that's the story of the character ""Timothy."" I was prepared that he just only might be a ""voice"" in the movie, and that if he was, that it would still be worth paying the money to see this. Was it? Ummmm......

Other than that, it is just a really weird movie with actors who don't know what to do most of the time and so much randomness that doesn't make much sense. I don't know why this ""M"" decided to make this movie, and in only 15 days with NO actual script. Perhaps it was an experiment? Well, epic fail. Congratulations. I don't understand at all how or why this movie is still around but not a great one such as ""A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries."" I had to buy it on ebay.",1394323200,4,2773,4.28
8345264,4,B001UWOLS4,"Provocative.  It's a slow and steady pace.  The performances were strong yet perfectly balanced with subtlety.  Chloe seemed to be in her element, immersed in the character, powerful deliveries disguised in nuance.

Extremely well directed, a well-told story overall.  Two sections that might have dragged on a big longer than seemed necessary but not enough to discourage potential viewers.

It's a very ""small"" film.  I feel the scathing reviews in here are unfair.  There was nothing I read in the film's description that lead me to believe it would be anything other than what it was, a small low-budget character-deep drama.  It's hard to tell what people bashing it might have been expecting.  It is more than I expected based on the film's description and I'm looking forward to seeing it again.",1345852800,2,802,5.007575757575758

Just 4 women who have a very complicated relationship.  The thing I found most intriguing is that the main character played by Chloe Sevigny is obviously a sociopath.  I've also known people like her so I thought this film was very genuine and true to that type of personality.  I'm not a film student or a critic and I don't know anything about independent films like EVERYONE who's posted comments here seems to.  I just liked it as a regular person.  Maybe you will too.",1342483200,9,643,4.435897435897436
