7897016,3,6305871167,"While not as fun as Surf Crazy or either of the Endless Summers, Surfing Hollow Days is still entertaining to those surfing enthusiasts who love Bruce Brown flicks.  Surfing Hollow Days takes the viewer on an  around-the-world surfing adventure with some of surfing's most legendary  riders when they were young men, including August and Yater themselves. The  background music isn't much to brag about, and Brown's commentary (usually  sharp witted and colorful) seems to fall a little flatter than usual.  From  California to Australia, during the birth of the foam boards, but still  before the oh-so-important leash, we follow several groups of young men  surfing their hearts out; including a 12 year old boy surfing Waimea Bay,  and the Pipeline's virgin run by the courageous Phil Edwards.  And when  they can't find a wave it seems as if surfing behind a boat will do. Brown  still throws in several gimmicks for comic relief, but for some reason,  Surfing Hollow Days just doesn't have the mass appeal as his other works.  But, if you love to watch vintage surfing footage, and love anything Bruce  Brown, Surfing Hollow Days is still fun to watch - but only recommended for  the most die-hard of fans.",963273600,31,1211,4.915841584158416
