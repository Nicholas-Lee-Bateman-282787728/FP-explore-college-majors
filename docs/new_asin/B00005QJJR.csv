7951112,2,B00005QJJR,"""L.A. Streetfighters"" is a Korean film shot in America and designed to appeal to western audiences, but the fact that it appealed enough to a production company to even be released was about all the movie could hope for. Highlighted only by an interesting martial arts cast and a degree of unintentional camp humor, it's a junker of a film that's hard to follow, both visually and where the storyline is concerned. What a disappointment.

The story: basically, the first forty minutes highlight generic gang violence and animosity between the high school cliques headed by Jun Chong (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bruce-Lee-Fights-Back-From-the-Grave/dp/B00005MKJY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bruce Lee Fights Back From the Grave</a>) and James Lew (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Balance-of-Power/dp/6304371128/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Balance of Power</a>) following the arrival of a new student and addition to Chong's gang (Phillip Rhee,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Best-of-the-Best/dp/B0002O7XUE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Best of the Best</a>&nbsp;quadrilogy). Then the movie gets an actual storyline going in the form of Jun putting his gang in danger following theft from a drug lord.

This film is seriously low-budget. The grainy picture quality indicates this, but the bigger flag is that at least 80% of it is shot at night and in the near-dark - hinting that the filmmakers might not have had permits to do their filming in broad daylight. This gives the movie a perpetually depressed look and really hurts most of the fight scenes, but more on that in a second. It doesn't help that clearly none of the performers qualify as actors: either they're uncomfortable speaking English or just can't act, but almost everyone in the movie speaks in a monotone voice, following a script written by a non-native English speaker (Ji-Woon Hong,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shaolin-The-Blood-Mission/dp/B0000TQS98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shaolin: The Blood Mission</a>). The plot doesn't so much unfold as it does unroll like a ream of toilet paper: not until the drug dealer subplot comes around is there any real clear-cut reason for things to occur, as the gang activity happens without clearly-defined motives. It's boring.

The fact that most of the main performers are playing high-schoolers is insane; I might have bought college students, but the 40-year-old Jun Chong, the 24-year-old Phillip Rhee, and the 32-year-old James Lew make the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers seem aptly-cast. With that said, there's no denying the soundness of their physical prowess. Along with Ken Nagayama and Bill Wallace (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Force-of-One/dp/B00031V23U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Force of One</a>), they constitute a minor supergroup of legitimate practitioners bringing authentic tae kwon do and karate forms to the screen. The choreography of the fight scenes has its low points, but overall, what you see is pretty good - I particularly liked the Chong vs. Lew stickfight early in the film. With that said, the problem of the fight scenes lies in actually being able to see them: with the exception of two, the nine fights all feature the same shadowy lighting as the rest of the movie. It's not completely debilitating, but it takes away a lot of the enjoyment you could get out of these.

I had been hoping to see this film for a while, based on its cast, but unless you're a die-hard fan of anybody involved, you might as well do better than me and save your time and money. Steer clear.",1334016000,,3731,5.955223880597015
7951113,1,B00005QJJR,"This DVD is unwatchable. The transfer is so awful and so dark, you'd be better off renting this on VHS, if you even know what that means.

I actually recorded this via TiVo off cable television, and my recording is 1000x better than this crappy DVD!

CAVEAT EMPTOR!

P.S. Why won't Amazon allow 0 star ratings?",1287964800,4,310,4.5
7951114,5,B00005QJJR,"Late last night, while on the brink of falling asleep, Sid was doing one last flip through the channels in hopes of catching something good on tv. Moments before the old boy gave up he stumbled across something that looked very promising called L.A Street Fighters on one of the movie channels. What made Sid stop was by witnessing a small gang led by a David Crosby look-a-like with a half shirt on (Oh yeah Oh yeah). In similar fashion to the 1994 decision to keep Death Ring on it was decided to do the same with this one, and we couldn't be happier with that choice. This one easily sits up in the realm of b action perfection with classics like the immortal&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Ring/dp/B00069QD74/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Ring</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ninja-Vengeance-VHS/dp/6302765137/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ninja Vengeance [VHS</a>], and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Money-to-Burn-1996-VHS/dp/6303945457/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Money to Burn (1996) [VHS</a>].

Other then the initial David Crosby impersonator Sid was captivated by so so many things starting with with awful dubbed voice overs. More times then you could possible count you will witness actors lips not moving while the voice overs roll on. That is always a sign you've found yourself the perfect B. Besides the horrific dubbing and confusing dialogue you will be in sheer delight as you witness one of the most hilarious turf wars between two rival gangs filled with Chinese martial artists, white dudes, 70's looking black guys, and plenty of vatos/bandidos.  It's quite the melting pot filled with sleeveless plaids, denim vests, sunglasses, and plenty of leather. Sid swears he was expecting the gangs to break out into a dance battle at any moment West Side Story style. The only way to paint the image is to ask you to picture the Beat It video only much much worse. As far as the plot goes there's no way possible to figure what was going on, you'll be too busy cracking up.

When it comes to horribly excellent B action L.A Street Fighters is absolutely the way to go. Now be clear that it is very difficult to get Sid to place a film in the same region as Death Ring, so when you hear us say that you know it's got to be fantastic. It is one of those instant classics that has everything you need to have a good time watching. It even had one of those wang chung practice things we discovered Dutch made in his current photos (minus all the black masking tape). We're even convinced we found Moose's long lost father as one of the fat shirtless banditos who urinates on the hood of a car. Honestly if all these bullet points haven't pulled you in by now then you're no fan of the b arts. By all means we fully recommend this film for anyone in need of a great laugh.",1265846400,4,2919,5.193205944798302
