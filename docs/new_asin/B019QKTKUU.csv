7580728,5,B019QKTKUU,"Thank you, Shout! Factory, for making this available as a single DVD, as I
had no interest in the other two films in the box set.
In the late '70s I was very interested in the New York and London punk rock scenes,
buying albums by The Ramones and The Sex Pistols, so when this film about the Los
Angeles punk scene was released in 1981,I had to get the soundtrack album and see
the movie when it arrived in town at the beginning of 1982.
I wound up loving X (Exene Cervenka and John Doe do the Beat poetry stance much
better than Patti Smith had at CBGBs, and had a great lead guitarist in Billy Zoom and
 drummer in D.J. Bonebrake to boot), and Black Flag, whose marriage of punk and heavy
 metal was ahead of it's time. I was fortunate enough to see these two bands in nightclub
 gigs shortly after seeing the movie.
The rest of the bands in the film are highly energetic, but for the most part come off as
early - eighties sit - com parodies of punk. I still find The Germs' incoherent set
annoying (if you want clearer interpretations of their songs in the film, get their Joan
Jett - produced album ""G.I.""), and have come to believe that the unfortunate house
painter that Darby Crash mocks during his interview contributed more to the world than
Darby did before they both left it.
That said, seeing this film again for the first time in 35 years left me feeling invigorated,
not bummed, and I hope that it has the same effect on others who purchase it.",1461628800,10,1459,4.298181818181818

8745823,5,B019QKTKUU,"California punk from the late-70's and early-80's, this ain't Green Day pop-music. If you enjoy this era of punk, I would highly recommend picking up Penelope Spheeris fictional movie: Suburbia (1983), sadly it is only available on DVD so far, but is still worth owning.",1500249600,,270,5.022222222222222

8745828,5,B019QKTKUU,"Great restoration of the classic hardcore punkrock movie. Definitely a piece of music history in the West Coast hardcorepunk movement. Iggy, The Ramones, The Sex Pistols and Clash started the punk rock scene. California started the ""hardcore punk"" scene. Black Flag, Fear, Circle Jerks and more, great stuff!",1463961600,2,308,5.4375
