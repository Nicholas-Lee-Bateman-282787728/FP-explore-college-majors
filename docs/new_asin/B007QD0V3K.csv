5104972,5,B007QD0V3K,I actually met her years ago at a nurse aide convention. She is such a wonderful person! She had all of us crying and laughing while telling us her life story.,1382400000,4,159,4.161290322580645

5104974,2,B007QD0V3K,I thought it was going to be different. It was fair I gave itto my vbrother and he loves it.,1371340800,,92,3.65
5104975,5,B007QD0V3K,It is great to hear her tell her story--the story that Hollywood wouldn't touch. She has a good message for the world.,1364083200,8,118,4.409090909090909

5104978,4,B007QD0V3K,A very interesting movie. She has gone through a lot of challenges in her short life. She has followed her conscience and what God has asked her to do. Thanks,1478131200,,158,4.3
5104979,5,B007QD0V3K,Very interesting.  I,1476230400,,20,5.666666666666667
5104980,5,B007QD0V3K,If you have ever watch Sue Thomas F.B.EYE this is a must because it is the root and so real to life.,1474243200,,100,3.590909090909091
5104981,1,B007QD0V3K,"She shared her story candidly from her perspective. If you want to be preached at, and believe the Christian God is responsible for all goodness and a devil creates all bad, yet also believe that everything is predetermined by God's plan then watch this. My 4 year old suffered terribly for 2 1/2 years of her short life, and finally died an agonizing death from cancer. I prayed every day, ALL day as I watched my precious baby wither away and so did the 36,000+ people on her Facebook page and everyone in our church - but if you believe God killed her anyway and let other children survive the same cancer b/c it was all part of a master plan then watch this. It will appeal to you. But don't you dare pass judgement as I constantly see of those who call themselves Christians; that's not what Christianity was created to do! Sue shares from her own personal interpretations of the Bible, but lest you forget to read and understand ALL of God's words which include Isaiah 45:7 ""I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these things.""
What you believe depends ENTIRELY on where you were born. Had you been born into the indigenous families of those in Papua New Guinea, you'd have no idea who her God is. There are over 4,500 different Gods presently worshipped. She shared the story of her life and her God. This not a film of facts, it's a film of one woman's belief and experiences and she will preach that to you.",1473897600,,1466,4.413284132841328
5104982,5,B007QD0V3K,"An incredible speech. I can't wait to read to read her book, and watch the TV series. Please Amazon, sell the series streaming.",1472774400,,127,4.565217391304348
5104983,4,B007QD0V3K,"It was both interesting and depressing at the same time. It was depressing to think of the hardships she endured as a child and it was interesting up to a point to see how she overcame those adversities; but, I would have liked to have heard more about her work with the FBI and the TV show.",1471910400,,291,4.12280701754386

5104991,5,B007QD0V3K,"Wow, I  can so relate to her story. I'm not deaf but I totally understand what she went through in her life. Her life seemed to reflect the loneliness and despair that I felt for most of my life. I was adopted from Korea, raised in in an all american white society that didn't know how to accept people that were different.  I have felt lonely most of my life. If it wasn't my faith in God and his abundance of grace, mercy, and forgiveness,  I would have been dead a long time ago. I still struggle with loneliness but I  also know God is, has, and will always be there for me. He is my rock!",1464566400,7,593,4.042735042735043
5104992,5,B007QD0V3K,"We watched this as a family and although there is never great excitement among the young adults about watching a documentary-type film, we all appreciated what she shared. I think there is something there everyone can identify with and learn from.  Although she has a serious message to communicate, she does so with a great sense of humor! All of us laughed with her. I love to see how God uses situations in each of our lives to teach us and bring Him glory! I plan to watch it a second time to let the message sink in a bit more:)",1464566400,2,533,4.2772277227722775

5104995,5,B007QD0V3K,"What an intensely powerful message that I aim to hear again and share! A testimony that is shared in such raw honesty that it is breath taking at moments. There are many including myself years ago that proclaim they are a Christian yet, has each genuinely layed his/her earthly life down in humbleness at the foot of the cross? Has each totally surrendered their life to Jesus? Acknowledging the definition of ""Lord"" first, is Christ Jesus truly their Lord? This degree of comprehension grows, oftentimes at an excruciating crossroad of choice...in the darkest night of the soul. How often is it truly the darkest before the dawn? Such a moment of choice...To ""sacrifice' one's fleshly pride in broken humbleness before our Lord, choosing His will above ours in obedience. 'Then Jesus said to the Jews who believed in Him, "" If you abide in My word, you are My disciples indeed. And you shall know the truth, and the truth will set you free."" John 8:31-32 Seeking genuine heartfelt inspiration for raw honesty to improve your relationship with Christ? Look no further!",1453852800,2,1068,4.873626373626373
