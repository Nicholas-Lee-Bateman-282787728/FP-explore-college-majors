5776578,5,B00D7AM2PQ,"My wife and I stumbled into this BBC series at a local Mom and Pop video rental store.  We loved it so much, we had to add it to our BBC collection.  Well written, great plots, the cast does a wonderful performance.  It beats any US TV series.",1389052800,,243,4.020833333333333
5776579,5,B00D7AM2PQ,"I love this series.  It's got drama, humor, and action.
The characters are fantastic. Each episode makes you want to watch the next one.",1388707200,,136,4.666666666666667
5776580,5,B00D7AM2PQ,"Recommended as a fun sophisticated crime series balanced with fast wit.
Set 1-5 series is a value. Top show-low price. 39 episodes! Do the math.
5-year set is PERFECT for those who already purchased many of the annual series later. 1-5 lets collectors/fans catch upon the early years without a lot of repeat buying.

As strong a cop/humor show as ever. Since 2003, this fast-pace old-guy investigation team is led by buxom blonde DS Pullman (Amanda Redman- `Little Dorrit'). They are handed cases from the past, unsolvable, but now new evidence suggests this UCOS,  Unsolved Crimes & Open Case team can get the job done right. Not without few mess-ups along the way, plus plenty of humor mingled with suspense. The episodes are now filled with many guest stars; a few are noted in the episode synopsis below. No end in sight for this great BBC small screen hit. Seasons continue.

One-liners and humorous expressions roll faster than finding clues in this fast-paced but retirement age police team. This team's personalities & relationships make this award-winning fun. Pullman tough, realistically slightly overweight, but yet sexy. Brian (Alun Armstrong-Garrow's Law: Series One) is an old alcoholic, tech nerd with a photographic memory. Jack (James Bolam-The Beiderbecke Tapes) a widower of a murdered spouse, & Gerry (Dennis Waterman-`Sweeney') aging playboy. DAC Strickland (Anthony Calf-`Upstairs Downstairs') is their often antagonistic boss. And we must mention Brian's wife Esther (Susan Jameson-`The Queen' and voice for Catherine Cookson audios). Expect first name familiarity in New Tricks, like in a family series. They are a cop family. Episodes always have a difficult past crime, plus personal issues of the UCOS team. You will laugh through the sleuthing efforts.",1388275200,15,1781,5.308510638297872
5776581,5,B00D7AM2PQ,"While television is filled with sappy, repetitive Christmas programs and reruns, I've been enjoying this quirky British series.  Unlike most TV today, it has a humorous, yet respectful, approach to old, unsolved murder cases. The characters are wonderfully flawed and believable.  Actors are not your usual Barbie and Ken lookalikes and there's very little in the way of car and foot chases...just great acting.  I recommend to anyone who loves mysteries and British humor.",1387756800,,473,5.364864864864865
5776582,5,B00D7AM2PQ,"The best 'cop' show ever!  While I get a bit tired of Brian's mental antics, the show as a whole is marvelous.  Great cast, wonderful directing and really good plots without gore, over-done sex scenes or the 'f' word.  Refreshing!",1387065600,3,230,4.7

5776584,5,B00D7AM2PQ,The cast is excellent.  Great premise.  I am up to season 3 and really enjoy the show.  I can see why it has been on as many seasons as it has.,1383177600,,143,3.5483870967741935
5776605,5,B00D7AM2PQ,"My husband caught a couple the shows on the WETA UK channel and got hooked. He was recovering from a serious surgery so I found the series - season ps 1-5 here on Amazon as well as seasons 6-10. I gave them to him as Christmas presents and they were the hit of the day for him. This is about a trio of retired officers brought back to clear up unsolved cases from the past. The female lead (I'm so sorry, but can't remember her name at the moment) is put in charge after she commits a huge faux pas! I won't say what and ruin the surprise. Jack was an excellent detective who has never recovered from his wife's murder and often ""speaks"" to her. Brian is quite the odd ball but is brilliant and lastly, but certainly not least is Jerry. He's quite the womanizer and has ex wives, who all get along and he has to put up with them on many occasions. They really play beautifully off each other and cannot recommend this high enough. Now I need to buy the 11th and 12th seasons before hubby finishes what I got him for Christmas!!",1486166400,,1027,4.191919191919192

5776611,5,B00D7AM2PQ,"I hadn't heard of this British detective show until I saw it here on Amazon.  I am almost through the series in this box set, and am finding that this is one of the shows that, like Last of the Summer Wine, grows on me the more I watch it.

In fact, it's almost the police detective version of Last of the Summer Wine, in that three of the four characters have been brought out of retirement to form a special police unit to solve cold murder cases.

The series is inventive, with well drawn characters, and plenty of levity to lighten the serious subject matter.  I found myself really concerned when the characters are in danger, or have major health/accident scares.

All in all, a very pleasant way to spend an evening!",1478908800,,723,4.406015037593985

We are enjoying each episode and are almost at the end of the collections we purchased (1-5 and 6-10).

5776658,5,B00D7AM2PQ,"Series Premise:
In 2003, The Metropolitan Police decide to create an ""Unsolved Crimes and Open Cases Squad"" (UCOS), tasked with re-opening unsolved cases from the past.
Problem: There is not enough money in the budget to fully staff the new unit
Solution: Three old-age pensioners are brought out of retirement.
Though retired policemen, they are technically civilian contractors, which saves the Department a lot of money.
Also, as civilians they feel free to flexibly interpret the rules (search warrant?)

Glamorous Detective Superintendent Sandra Pullman is put in charge of UCOS.
A three person team does not need it's own Superintendent, but Superintendent Pullman is on the outs with her superiors.
This experiment could be a plan to ease her out of the department

Technically the acronym for ""Unsolved Crimes and Open Cases Squad"" is not UCOS (pronounced ""You-Cose"").
It's UCOCS (pronounced ""You-Cocks""), but its pretty clear why that could be a problem.

107 hour-long episodes spread over twelve years.
""New Tricks"" is a wonderful show, but it's hard to maintain consistent quality for such a long stretch.
There was a total cast change between the first and the final (12th) seasons, but it was a gradual process.
The original cast held together for eight seasons.
Followed by four additional permutations.
None of the replacements really lived up to their predecessors' achievement.
This is a tribute to the remarkable quality of the original cast, not a knock against the replacements.
The loss of retired Inspector Brian Lane midway through Season Ten was especially devastating.
I won't say it began with a bang, and ended with a whimper.
More like a smaller bang.

The show was always stronger on character development than plotting.
Too many cases are solved by a witness suddenly remembering an important piece of information he forgot to mention twenty years earlier.
A lot of suspension of disbelief is required, but it's worth the effort.

BUYERS GUIDE

[hint: for ease of navigation, read the review through to the end, then come back and click on the links.]

One drawback: ""New Tricks"" has always been a rather expensive proposition.
At present, the least expensive way is to purchase:

-- New Tricks Collection, Seasons 1-5, listed on this page = $75
--&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/New-Tricks-Collection-Seasons-6-10/dp/B00PKPGMKC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">New Tricks Collection: Seasons 6-10</a>&nbsp;$65
--&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/New-Tricks-Season-11/dp/B00QG6IDJC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">New Tricks, Season 11</a>&nbsp;$17

If you buy the Season 1-5 and Season 6-10 boxes, you will get all the episodes featuring Teams 1-3, plus the first two episodes of Team 4.
All episodes have English SDH subtitles.

There is some hope for the future.
""Foyle's War"" and ""New Tricks"" both ended long runs in 2015.
In Great Britain, this was a signal to Acorn Media to bring out two absolutely complete new mega-boxes at substantial savings.
The ""Foyle's War"" mega-box appeared in the UK in August, and in the US in October, 2015.
The ""New Tricks"" mega-box appeared in the UK in October 2015.
If the pattern holds, we should expect the ""New Tricks"" mega-box over here sometime in 2016.
Savings should be substantial (at least after the first few months).

5776664,2,B00D7AM2PQ,"The series was reasonably amusing, well-scripted (as near as I could tell) and probably decently filmed.  Unfortunately, almost every single disk of the set had some flaw that caused it to jitter, freeze and then to skip substantial segments -- if not most -- of each episode, from first to last.  I would have suspected a problem with my player, but it behaves flawlessly with other DVDs, and at least 3 or four out of the set did not have this problem, so it is obviously a production issue, not one with my equipment. Cleaning the disks did not help, replaying or fast-forwarding through the damaged areas did not change the playing issues. Unfortunately, all these disk-play problems were discovered much too late to return the collection since I only started to play them well past the 30 day return period.

The series regulars play retired police detectives who are hired as consultants to solve cold cases. Their boss is a lady superintendent of police. Despite their quirky behavior, this group turns into an ""A Team"" of detectives who have no quit in them. They gather facts. Then hash them out till they get a working theory of what happened. They take that theory as far as it goes, and usually hit a wall. Where they go over it again. And again. Till they get the perp. All of this investigation is laced with dry British humor. Speaking of which, no body makes mystery shows better than the Brits. They own the mystery & spy genres. This series is fun, funny, very intelligent, and fast paced. The writing & acting are top notch. I hope that you enjoy this show as much as I do.",1433376000,5,860,4.449367088607595

The characters soon felt like old and dear friends who showed me that getting older may present challenges, but it isn't anything to dread. I agree with Amanda Redman (CSI Sandra Pullman, in the show)'s assessment that as seasons 9-present have come along, the show has gotten blander and blander.

5776716,1,B00D7AM2PQ,"This series appears to have developed as a parody on bad Teevee. Could have been titled Over-the-Hill Gang + 1. The female lead is pudgy and bland. The three old guys are 1. Straight arrow that seems to spend most of his non-working hours talking to  his wife (who is long dead); 2. bug-eyed, quirky old guy with near photographic memory plated by a terrible actor; and, 3. Old guy that still thinks you and only thinks of sex. Of course, throw in the bad boss and social agenda themes. This series is not worth watching, I could not finish the first 5 seasons. Its the kind of series that is so dumb it makes you wonder why you are watching and hope it will put you to sleep so you do not have to get up and stop the DVD. George Gently, Foyle's War, etc., are leaps and bounds better than this series. I watched for hours and can honestly say I do not care about of the characters.",1428796800,2,882,4.188235294117647

Amanda Redman, Dennis Waterman, Alan Armstrong and James Bolam are all international comedy treasures, but this series is also touches on some surprisingly deep themes despite its overall light touch.  Whether you love more hard-bitten cop drama or are burnt out on it, ""New Tricks"" is just what the doctor ordered for some zany procedural fun with a heart.",1418688000,8,654,4.7105263157894735

I'm tending to watch the 3 episodes on 1 or 2 dvds then replaying to catch any of the little puns/plot intracacies I've missed. After the first 3 episodes I ordered all the rest available individually. Sort of sorry I've read updates on the internet about Amanda Redman and Alum Armstrong leaving after the 10th season. Since a large part of the appeal for me is how everyone interacts it will take some super writing and chemistry to mesh another team.",1410652800,,614,4.54054054054054

The only British series that I have not enjoyed is Cumberbatch as Sherlock Holmes. _New Tricks_ is well written, clever, intriguing, has some humor, and the four main actors are terrific. One disappointing aspect of the show is that after the first season a terrific actor, Chike' Okonkwo was dropped from the cast. I am only through the second season and there is hope he will return.",1402704000,,502,4.651685393258427

5776779,5,B00D7AM2PQ,New tricks collection contains the first program and the first five seasons.  Normal price from Amazon and Acorn is $125+- so at the current price you can't go wrong.  I haven't found anyplace you can stream the early programs so if you are interested in what the cast looks like ten years younger buy this.  Stories and cast are still developing their characters so it is interesting to watch from ten years in the future.,1401667200,,423,4.613333333333333

The only problem was that the mechanism for holding the DVDs arrived broken.  It is pins fitting into grooves and one pin snapped.  So now all the DVDs shift around when I close the box.,1401408000,,352,4.523809523809524

However, some of the Doc Martin and especially the seasons 1 through 7 of New Tricks, although the picture quality is good, the sound quality is atrocious. This, to me, is not acceptable and I am disappointed in Amazon as I would like to think I am a valued customer and should certainly not be pawned off with poor quality DVDs. I will be watching, carefully, future purchases because this is unacceptable. If you have any credibility you will, at least, offer me the remaining seasons for free or at a reduced cost.

Two authors both talked about this series independently and most everyone in the room nodded their heads in agreement.

8590304,5,B00D7AM2PQ,"At first I thought it would be similar to the US Cold Case TV show, but the similarities end in the premise. The show pits a rising star who shot a dog in a raid with retired cops that use old school police tactics (when they can) to solve Unsolved Crime and Open Cases. British humor plays a big role here. As the team has its success we learn more about each of it's members including Detective Superintendent Sandra. That's the part about the show that I like the best is that by seeing each of their characters as everyday people with problems the show is more real.

At first I thought it was odd that a season is just 8 1-hour episodes but apparently many British shows are that way, Being able to purchase Seasons 1-5 as a box set gives you about 39.5 hours of TV (about 2 or 3 seasons of a typical US show). The show is nice because it also doesn't rely on special effects. I like the show a lot. I purchased Seasons 6-10 as well and am now watching those.",1496275200,,964,4.1550802139037435
