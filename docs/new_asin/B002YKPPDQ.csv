8384289,5,B002YKPPDQ,"Although at first viewing this film appears unusual, the viewer has to remember it is nearly 100 years old. The original was made of 3-6 reels, therefore, this product could be made from reels not intended to be shown together. However, many silent films of this vintage suffer from the same predicament. The running time is equal to the original release length minus one minute. The only real criticism I have of this release is the poor choice of music. Other than that, the DVD is very watchable. This film is of equal interest to cinema enthusiasts/students and fans of Dickens.

The delivery service was very good. R. W. Breen",1310860800,,631,4.736363636363636
8384290,4,B002YKPPDQ,"First I must say my four-star rating is strictly based on the film's curiosity value, not exactly its ""artistic merit"" alone, (which I believe is considerable, though). The 1913 silent ""David Copperfield"" looks undeniably old to us - and it IS old, as this is reportedly ""one of the first British films of feature length,"" according to the Grapevine DVD jacket.

Though some details are changed, the 1913 version (mere 66 minutes) is surprisingly faithful to the Charles Dickens original book, covering many major episodes of the story. It is said that Thomas Bentley, vaudeville performer-turned-film director who was to make many films based on Dickens, actually traveled to the places described in the author's book to shoot scenes (see the stone arch of Canterbury). I am not sure his efforts were really necessary as it seems about half of the film was shot in soundstage.

Still, it is notable that most characters of the film (including Wilkins Micawber, Uriah Heep and Rosa Dartle) look convincing. David's first marriage lasts only for five minutes. Most of the memorable quotes from the beloved Dickensian characters are not to be found. Still, considering that the time when the cinematic narrative was being established, the film is still well worth watching,

Grapevine Video DVD is ""transferred from a tinted and toned print,"" which means the image is not really black-and-white. The film looks more like orange (or red, blue)-and-white. Compared with the crisp (and truly ""black-and-white"") 8-minute excerpt of the film included in ""Dickens Before Sound"" from British Film Institute, this is slightly disappointing, but considering the time it has lapsed since the original release, it is acceptable.

Grapevine Video's DVD includes an amusing 12-minute short ""Matrimony's Speed Limit"" (1913) starring Fraunie Fraunholz and Marian Swayne, in which a man has to marry by noon or he will lose his inheritance. And he has only 12 minutes to find a bride! There is a little surprise waiting for him.",1294617600,,2010,5.156441717791411
