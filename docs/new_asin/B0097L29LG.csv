8537466,4,B0097L29LG,"Director Quentin Tarantino's latest film 'DJANGO UNCHAINED' is hitting cinemas this holiday season and Director Sergio Corbucci's classic 'DJANGO'-1966 starring Franco Nero is being shown in selected theatres in a brand new restored print due to Tarantino's reboot of the character.  In celebration of this , Timeless Media Group has released two volumes of double features featuring the Django character in name only at excellent prices and in their original aspect ratios.  The two films in this volume do not represent the best of the Euro Western genre but are entertaining none the less. First up is Director Max Hunter aka Massimo Pupillo's 'DJANGO KILLS SILENTLY' aka 'BILL IL TACITURNO...DJANGO UCCIDE'- 1968 starring George Eastman aka Luigi Montifiori in his second turn as a gunman named Django.  Having witnessed two seperate slaughters by a gang of bandits led by El Santo , he meets up with the sister of one of the outlaws played by sexy Liana Orfei who's husband discovered a valley of gold and was killed in an ambush.  The sheriff of the town convinces Django to stay and clean up the riffraff but he has other plans.  Boasting an incredibly rousing music score by Berto Pisano, the film is just OK at best.  Pupillo is known for his genre outings including the over the top  'BLOODY PIT OF HORROR' aka 'IL BOIA SCARLATTO'-1966 with a great performance by Mickey Hargitay. Next is the worst film of the bunch Director Luigi Batzella aka Paolo Solvay's 'DJANGO'S CUT PRICE CORPSES' aka 'EVEN DJANGO HAS HIS PRICE' aka 'ANCHE PER DJANGO HANNO UN PREZZO'-1971 made at the decline of the Euro Western.  The fault lies with its main actor Jeff Cameron aka Geoffredo Scarciofolo with a very lack lustre performance.  He plays a gunman following the Cortez brothers who is told by a Wells Fargo sheriff to hold off on the capture till they find the location of a gold mine owned by the brothers.  The film includes cross dressing and other weird characters and why not, Batzella is notorious for these type of films including the notorious Nazi exploitation film 'SS HELL CAMP' aka 'THE BEAST IN HEAT'-1977 and the wonderful 'NUDE FOR SATAN'-1974.  The release however has both films in their 1.85 ratios and are gorgeous. There are poster galleries and original trailers for each film. Recommended for Euro Western fans, Timeless Media has released two great packages and hopefully will continue to release more of them in the future but purchase them quickly because they may be limited editions.",1356048000,11,2509,4.921800947867299
