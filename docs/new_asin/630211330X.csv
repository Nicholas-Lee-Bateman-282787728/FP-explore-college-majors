7821122,5,630211330X,"There is only one problem with Hollywood's Children, the companion video to Hollywood's Children by Diana Serra Cary. There is not enough time to show the stories of the people included. I sensed that this should have been a series of narrated video's by the late and much loved Roddy Mcdowall. So many of the people on the video have passed on. For instance, Peggy Ann Garner who is most remembered for A Tree Grows In Brooklyn. Her story alone would fill one video. Another person who has had a fascinating life is Diana Serra Cary, the author of Hollywood's children. Mrs. Cary is also known as Baby Peggy,a major child star in the 1920's. The opportunity is still there to make a series of video's on child actor's. I hope some one will do so before we lose any more of Hollywood's Children.",1005091200,2,795,4.527777777777778
