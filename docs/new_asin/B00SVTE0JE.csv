6993191,3,B00SVTE0JE,"A person of interest in a serial killer case involving multiple young women buried alive is released because the police detective in charge of the case tampered with evidence.  The detective goes home, sits down in his study as the bad news plays on television and blows his brains out while his young son plays video games in his bedroom.

Jump forward in time and a young man named John (Chris Coy) has breezed into a small nowhere town and tells the local barber Eugene (Scott Glenn) that he knows who the man really is--the accused serial killer from Chicago with a new name but the same black soul.  John claims to be Eugene's biggest fan and that all he wants is to learn from the older man.  Eugene at first insists John has the wrong guy, then admits who he really is but claims he was never guilty in the first place which is why the police let him go.  But it isn't long before Eugene seemingly lets down his guard and offers a chilling memory of how he felt before one of his kills--the woman was young and pretty and everything was easy for her which filled Eugene with rage and lust--ending the perfect life she never deserved was justice.

There's a problem with the irritatingly dumb screenplay for The Barber almost immediately--we should believe that John is the real deal there to learn from Eugene but the movie telegraphs the fact that John is the grown-up police detective's son so obviously you would have to be an idiot not to make the connection.  First the movie includes an ill-advised onscreen quote about digging deep to bury your father, then the film cuts from the boy in his bedroom hearing the gunshot to a close-up of grown up John driving a black muscle car with the words 20 years later on screen.  For a movie that aspires to being twisty The Barber gets off to a very bad start.

Eugene may believe John's story about being a serial killer fan or he might be playing with the young man--unfortunately the script never manages to get anything resembling an effective cat and mouse game between the two characters going.  Even worse the movie chooses to not show what Eugene is actually up to, wasting precious screen time trying to create doubt as to whether Eugene is actually a serial killer or not which never works.  Since the filmmakers chose to play the is he/isn't he game with Eugene they end up not showing a number of things that would have made The Barber a far more effective thriller.

If the script fails miserably in terms of storytelling it does at least offer Scott Glenn his meatiest role in ages and he gives a performance that is superb--charming and amusingly fastidious in his barber shop, easily offended by obscene language, filled with folksy old-fashioned wisdom on what it means to be a man, proper and polite to everyone in town but switching to ice cold menace in the blink of an eye, calmly recalling his crimes in Chicago or teaching John how to stalk victims to learn their routines while remaining invisible or what trick to use to get a girl standing in the rain to accept a ride from you even though she knows she shouldn't.  Scott Glenn is fantastic but the crummy plotting drains the film of any suspense.  Rather than show what Eugene's character is actually up to The Barber withholds everything until the end then spits it all out in awkward expositionary dialogue that really makes you wish the filmmakers had shown much more and told less.

While the weak script is a problem The Barber is worth a look for Scott Glenn who makes things interesting whenever he is onscreen.  Director Basil Owies also smartly keeps things moving quickly so The Barber is pretty easy to sit through in spite of its glaring faults--just make sure to keep your expectations low.",1427673600,2,3735,4.585585585585585
6993192,5,B00SVTE0JE,"The Barber is a mystery/thriller  about a serial killer named (Francis Visser) living in a small town in the guise of a meek barber named ""Eugene"" played flawlessly by Scott Glen.

 Chris Coy's subtle performance as ""John McCormick"" son of the detective who was obsessed with the Francis Visser case, until he blew his own brains out due to his frustration with Visser never being convicted or punished for his crimes of torturing and burying women alive.

John comes to the small town looking for Eugene/Francis,but what are John's true intentions? This is something that comes to light when the plot allows.

This is a slow burn thriller that keeps you own your toes and enthralled .There are enough twists and turns to make one Dizzy. The cat and mouse between Eugene and John is quite entertaining to watch but plays out evenly, without seeming too far fetched because everything ties together quite brilliantly.

The ending gave me great satisfaction and closure.",1427414400,6,968,4.944444444444445

6993207,2,B00SVTE0JE,"I gave this movie 1 star  for the slow pace  3 Stars for the plot and 4 Stars for Scott Glenn's Excellent Acting abilities .2.67 avg for the movie
That being said Its a slow paced interesting  Psycho Drama Movie .
No Spoiler But I figured out the entire movie  in the first  12 minuets
This could have been a very good movie but the directors left out a ton of things that would have made this so much better,
It's a shame because Scott Glenn caries the whole movie.",1433289600,,466,4.133333333333334
6993208,5,B00SVTE0JE,"Good Movie.  I had never heard of this movie, but love Scott Glenn, great actor.  I waited until some used copies became available and bought it.  Really good and interesting movie.  Scott Glenn can play good or bad, and a lot of the times he plays bad, but he is a really good actor.  I will not spoil the movie, but this is based on a true story and although the main character was questioned in some murders, you are really not sure if he did it or not.  But again, he was just questioned and then released due to lack of evidence.  The movie comes together nicely and well done.",1433289600,,582,4.1891891891891895

6993213,5,B00SVTE0JE,Watch it!,1431907200,,9,4.0
6993214,4,B00SVTE0JE,I liked it. It was nice to see the bad guy get the same treatment as his victims. It was fantastic to hear and see him kicking and screaming the way his victims did. The good guy wins in the end. It's also nice that it showing up in other movies. The movies are showing  that sometimes turning bad guys over to authority is not the answer. It would have been sad  if  the Barber got away again.,1431648000,,394,4.0256410256410255
6993215,4,B00SVTE0JE,"Scott Glenn has been around since 1972 when he starred with Barbara Hershey in ""The Baby Maker"". He has had a great career. He usually is a co star in A pictures and the lead in B pictures. Whatever the case is he always turns in great performances. One of his best movies, which, for some unknown reason, is not available on DVD is ""The Challenge"".Any Scott Glenn movie is worth watching.",1431129600,,389,4.416666666666667
6993216,3,B00SVTE0JE,Scott Glenn's storytelling made this movie watchable for me. The story of a mass murderer in a small town who was arrested but never charged and those who still believed that he was guilty. This lacked the  action that I had hoped for when I purchased this dvd. Don't get me wrong there are several killings and fights but not to level that I expected. The script and the story telling was good. The actors were decent and the pacing was good. So the story should hold your attention from start to finish.,1431043200,,505,4.43010752688172

8699481,4,B00SVTE0JE,"By the time Mr. Handsome realizes his potential, I will be a sagging old lady who won't get so much as a glance from passersby... I have to be realistic, but Chris Coy (in my opinion) is just wasting his time and his looks and his talent right now.  By the time he wakes up to his potential, I  will probably not be here -  think about THAT. He likes' Banshee' - well guess what: Part of my punishment as a child in the nineteen seventies  was watching action movies with my dad. Chuck Norris, Bruce Lee and I guess Mr. Dreamboat likes 'Banshee'. I just like HIM, you see, but I may not live to see him blossom to his full potential. DON'T LET THIS HAPPEN, CHRIS - COME ON. Just because I don't follow everything he says or does doesn't mean I don't think about him, or wish the best for him. He will be 30 soon, he was born when I was almost 17 and I want to be around to see his big break out film..,",1461801600,,902,3.9944444444444445
8699482,2,B00SVTE0JE,"Scott Glen is a great actor, however he can't lift this clich&eacute;d movie up. Its not unbearable - its worth watching if you need to kill about 1.5 hours, but ultimately forgettable.",1456963200,,185,4.8125

8699484,1,B00SVTE0JE,Disappointed,1454112000,,12,12.0
8699485,2,B00SVTE0JE,"They say that serial killers are driven to kill and are unable to stop, but Eugene Van Wingerdt (Scott Glenn) did stop. He stopped nearly thirty years ago and moved away to a small town, where he became the local barber and beloved member of the local community. One day, out of the blue, the son of the cop who originally investigated his crimes, tracks him down. The cop, posing as a budding serial killer, wants advice from Eugene, who continuing to claim he's not who the boy thinks he is. Eugene feels sorry for him and forms a bond with the young man, trying to lead him away from a life of crime, but as he does, will those old feelings come back to the surface, or is Eugene really just a misunderstood old man? The premise of the new independent film, The Barber, is certainly unique and to me it seemed as though there were many different directions this film could have gone in, but the path chosen, was the road less traveled, and the result was just a really boring and predictable story. This is one of those film where nothing really happens until the end, and by that point, the viewer is just so bored and sick of the whole thing that they just want it to be over. Scott Glenn stars and is far too old to be believable. I can understand wanting to be active and not simply take on the role of grandpa, but a mentor for a serial killer, it just doesn't fit. Glenn is paired with newcomer Chris Coy, who honestly couldn't act his way into a high school play, much less play a character with duel personalities. By the end of this film, I literally cringed every time the guy opened his mouth. The story here is solid, but the way producers go about telling it and the people they cast to star in it leave a lot to be desired.",1448668800,2,1740,4.259818731117825
