8668775,1,B00LXDQ8KO,"I wish I had read the reviews on this before purchasing.  The audio was horrible, in fact the whole presentation lacked in just about everything except street noise from the open windows.  I have some knowledge of the Masons and other societies going back in time and the description on the package was misleading to the point of false advertising.  This was just a tour of the Masonic Temple in England and a very poor one at that.  I wish I could return it...I would not even give this away.",1457308800,,493,4.444444444444445
8668776,2,B00LXDQ8KO,Not really about Freemasons.  Short part in beginning then a bunch of other stuff.,1416787200,,82,4.857142857142857
8668777,1,B00LXDQ8KO,"This is reallly a piece of crap : Image is 4:3, Low Resolution, Sound is awful, Content is not interesting.
0 star ... Do not buy this DVD, it is a real rip off.",1415145600,,161,3.764705882352941
8668778,1,B00LXDQ8KO,The audio was really bad.  I could hardly make sense of it.  I was hoping to better understand the Freemasons that were depicted in Nicholas Cage's National Treasure.  No luck.  I guess I'll try wikipedia?,1414627200,,205,4.771428571428571
