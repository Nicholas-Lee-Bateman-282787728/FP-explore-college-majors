Save the gecko / what?

3449256,5,B001AI775W,I purchased this tape for a handicapped boy of 16 and he loved it and watches it every night before bedtime. It keeps his attention while at the same time comforts him with the many songs. The moral of the story is good but may be lost on him; which doesn't matter. All in all I would recommend to everyone it's wonderful.,1265587200,,322,4.209677419354839
3449257,5,B001AI775W,"The Wonderpet creators have got it figured out. Once again, another winner with my 2 year old daughter, and myself. Each episode is filled with music, singing, and cute animals in need. My personal favorite is save the ladybug.",1235520000,,227,4.846153846153846
3449258,5,B001AI775W,"My 2 year old will watch this over and over again. She loves to talk about the Bengal Tiger and sings ""Ooochie, oochie"". Wonder Pets are always great entertainment and fun for children. I've found that my daughter loves to watch the shows with me and it encourages her verbal interaction and observation.

Highly reccommend any Wonder Pets, but I think the music in this one is delightful.",1234742400,,389,4.720588235294118
3449259,5,B001AI775W,"The Wonderpets give such great lessons on sharing, friendship and teamwork!  They are always nice to eachother, so you never have to ""monitor"" when your kids are watching.  I have a 3 year old and 5 year old, and they both love the wonderpets!  The humor is even amusing for adults, but not in a bad way (like shreck or other ""potty humor"" movies).  Very age appropriate for little ones.",1234051200,,387,4.485714285714286
3449260,5,B001AI775W,"My daughter fell in love with the Wonder Pets about 6 months ago (she just turned 3). After you get past the crazy graphics (Winnie the gerbil looks like a cut/paste photo of a real gerbil with the paws and everything), the Wonder Pets teach some very important lessons. The Bengal tiger episode focuses on the fact that everyone is important whether you're big or small. The songs have got a nice Indian kick (sitar and other instruments) and the songs are infectious in a good way. There are other episodes on this dvd that are just as good. I highly recommend this video: the music, the songs and the lessons (team work, helping others, not being mean) are good ones that any child or adult can learn from. I'm about to order another Wonder Pets dvd.",1230249600,,753,4.5036496350364965
3449261,4,B001AI775W,"This DVD contains one longer episode of Wonder Pets (Save the Bengal Tiger) and four short episodes.  Each episode has a message about getting along with other people that is brought out in the story. For instance, the Bengal Tiger story is about how we should respect creatures smaller than us. Another episode is about how there is a time for playing and a time for being responsible.

All the episodes are done to song, kind of like a cartoon opera, and they all end with the Wonder Pets eating celery.

I gave this four stars because I felt that ""Save the Unicorn"" was a little better as far as entertainment value goes. My four year old son enjoys both DVDs though.",1228694400,4,670,4.475409836065574
3449262,5,B001AI775W,My son who is 15 months old loves this show. I bought him the DVD for Christmas. He loves all the music and singing.,1226793600,,116,3.875
3449263,5,B001AI775W,"My Grandson is 20 months old and LOVES the Wonder Pets.
He really enjoys this video- I would definately recommend
this for kids.  The Wonder Pets teach how to work together to help
someone in trouble.  This is also good for longer trips in the car
to occupy the time.",1226275200,,267,4.32
3449264,5,B001AI775W,I'm thrilled everytime they come out with a new dvd for the Wonder Pets. My 2 year old son loves them. It's just about the only thing he will sit still for. Thanks!,1223683200,,164,4.0

Save the Bengal Tiger
Save the gecko & Save the what?
Save the ladybug & Save the sea turtle
Save the goslings & Ollie to the rescue

There is also a cute music video titled ""I like being small"" in the special features. My kiddos (ages from 1-5) really like that too. The video is 97 minutes long, so there is a lot to see on the DVD. I really liked how there was more than 1 or 2 episodes on one DVD. I, and my kids, are happy to have this DVD. We would definately recommend it!!",1292457600,,524,3.980952380952381

8277576,5,B001AI775W,"Arrived in perfect condition and on time.  Cute DVD that my 3 year old son enjoys and that I do not mind watching either.  The DVD is about the Wonder Pets helping other animals that are in trouble and teamwork.  I like that it sends a positive message and has catchy songs.

 My only dislike is that one of the Wonder pets does not pronounce his words corectly, he speaks more in ""baby talk"" and I do not want my child to replicate that.",1389052800,,438,4.166666666666667
8277577,1,B001AI775W,"The case plastic was cloudy to see through,and wrinkly,as if chewed by a dog.  The paper book cover had several library category stickers on it-some I could remove, others not without tearing the thin paper cover.  Some of the picture on the cover sheered off, especially at the corners. The binder of the cover torn half the vertical length. It looked so junky that I slid the paper cover out, repaired it, slid it into a spare DVD similar case.  The movie froze up near the end just after the Japanese episode several times, played in jerky timing, on and off for a good 15 minutes.  Smudges and scratches to the playing surface.  I cleaned the smudges out , but it still freezes and stalls.  It was rated as 'Used-Acceptable'.  I would have said 'poor'.  I won't be ordering from Motor City again.  This DVD is not in acceptable condition.",1388534400,,842,4.56
