8232694,3,B00008L3XY,"My expectations have been lowered by almost every post-80's Franco film I've seen. ""Blind Target"" was an exception. I expected the worst from this Franco/One Shot collaboration, but this actually has a decent plot and you can tell that some heart went into the making of this movie. It does suffer from bad sound quality and poor DVD transfer but it doesn't have the awful and pointless visual effects of ""Lust for Frankenstein"" and ""Vampire Junction"" and best of all, with an actual story, the pace of the film is much better.

Rachel Sheppard is not exactly charismatic but does a decent job in the lead role. Lina Romay, who's been miscast way too often recelntly, does a great job as a villain and Linnea Quigley has a small part as a journalist.

This is not a great masterpiece, but for Franco fans like myself it's definately a step in the right direction and should be checked out. The DVD has some behind the scenes material but not very much.",1151193600,5,952,4.594117647058823
8232695,4,B00008L3XY,"Sure, the quality of the English is not all that great but this is one of Jesus Franco's best in recent years.  It's an action drama with a decent degree of intrigue and some nice comic moments.  Rachel Sheppard is a cutie who could be the next darling of the Franco set.  Lina Romay looks and acts vicious as the chief female baddie.  Even Linnea Quigley is in this.  She's looks great and does a fine job in an remarkably straight dramatic role.  One Shot Productions delivers a few nice extras on the DVD too with some rough but interesting behind the scenes bits.  Even if you hate Franco, and plenty of us do, you could do worse that this interesting potboiler about an ex-patriate writer (Sheppard) returning to her native country on a book tour only to be kidnapped and swept up in a plot of political assassination.  Heady stuff for Franco!",1069977600,5,848,4.496732026143791
