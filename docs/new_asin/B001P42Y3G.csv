3737784,4,B001P42Y3G,"A short review of this double-feature release.

This is a single disc release. Two features on one disc. Not two discs, as the product details suggest. When you pop the disc in, you pick which film you want to watch, and that takes you to the menu for that title.

Being on one disc, don't expect a crazy high bitrate on the encode, like some release get. It is not substandard though, and my quick scan through did not identify any glaring quality problems. No film grain was apparent, so I assume it was shot on digital cameras, or at least the image has that ""non-film"" look to it, with some (re-)compression artefacts apparent in places.

The movies are in the original Portuguese with English subtitles. However, the subtitles are burned in; not cool, in my opinion. -1 star.",1383004800,21,780,4.597122302158273
3737785,1,B001P42Y3G,"Okay ..... I am waiting with Baited Breath ......the City of God is a 5 Star Flick but I  only gave it 3 Stars because I bought it on Amazon  as a 9/24/13 release only because it was advertised ( as was City of Men ) as being an ENLGLISH LANGUAGE version and IF it is......I will edit this review to 5 Stars
If it is NOT in English.....I will return it to Amazon for a refund
I'm not against foreign language films but there is too much happening  in City of God that I don't want to be distracted by reading sub-titles when I'm viewing this movie
BTW - I am puzzled as to why Amazon lists  this 130 minute movie as being only  97 minutes long for both ( not just one )  of these movies ?
EDIT - I reduced this review to  1 star because the item is NOT English Language as advertised on Amazon & I DID  return it for a refund",1379808000,,825,3.8982035928143715

3737809,4,B001P42Y3G,My only complaint is no English dubbing. My Portuguese is very poor but if you can get past the subtitles it's an excellent film. Wasn't as big on city of men but the price justifies it.,1453334400,,186,4.194444444444445

3737813,3,B001P42Y3G,"Let me start by saying I am a long time fan of the entire City of God & City of Men spin-off series. I was mesmerized by the first film, City of God,  which I saw in the early 00s and was looking forward to replacing my stolen Dvd with the blu ray version. Initially I was only looking for City of God (which is the superior film of the two) but decided on this double feature since its two for the price of one. I should've done my homework because this version has NO special features for either film. The hard hitting documentary ' News from a personal war ' that was on my dvd version is no where to be found.  I am so disappointed because I wanted the doc as much as the movie. Boo on Miramax because they're the same company that released the original dvd, why cut out the extras? As for City of Men I haven't seen that movie in years and can't remember what its special features were though I do remember some behind the scenes interviews. This version seems like a quick flip into the market since there are no setup menus or subtitle options. The English subtitles are burned into the film which others have complained about but doesn't bother me since I don't speak Portuguese and the subtitles would always be on anyway. However if you need French or Spanish subtitles you're out of luck. So sad I wanted to give City of God a five star rating and even though City of Men is more three stars I still would've rated it higher were this not such a lacking version.",1425513600,3,1473,4.238434163701068

3737843,3,B001P42Y3G,"Not much to say about the movies that you cannot see in IMDB by yourself. City of God is great, City of men is, well, ok

Regarding this blu-ray edition, only burned-in english subtitles are available, which is bad. I really so not like editions that do not have other subtitle options, nor the option to simply hide them.

Three starts only due to this",1400976000,2,353,4.415384615384616
3737844,4,B001P42Y3G,For A film like these its a great story and when you watch the first one its great to see the second one. You have to ready to read the subtitles to understand.,1390867200,,160,3.878787878787879
3737845,5,B001P42Y3G,"City of God as a slightly low bitrate that stays in the low twenties but remains a solid encode, though it does look a touch soft. City of Men looks dazzling and has quite a high bitrate. Both films are pretty good but not quite classics in my book. I would think that the 9.99 pricepoint is very suited for this double feature. I really wish they could have been put on two discs but it seems they both made it out okay. Everything else seems fine to me. If you like these films or are interested in the problems presented here then it is a must buy. Stunning cinematography at times. The direction and scripts are mostly good to excellent.",1389225600,2,641,4.305785123966942

8332015,5,B001P42Y3G,"2 Amazing movies in one package!! City of God is in my opinion one of the greatest films of all time. Be aware,City of Men is actually a finale to a series of the same name. So it might be a good idea to pick of the ""City of Men DVD Series"" the same time as this package. I won't go into a review, because there are plenty. Just know City of God's main focus is the violence in the favela, and how people/children are wrapped up in it. City of Men is the polar opposite. It's about kids living in the favela who try and avoid the violence and drugs. Both movies are amazing in their own different ways. If you enjoy movies about drugs, or just well made foreign and independent film type movies, then these 2 movies are a real gem.",1520985600,,731,4.083333333333333
