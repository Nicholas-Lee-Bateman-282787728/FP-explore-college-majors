1715681,4,B000067FPE,This Box set of the Key to Time is fantasic. I would have givin it 5 stars however it was a little slim on the special features. I was delighted to find out that we got it as an exclusive from the UK. To any Dr Who fan who is lucky enough to have a DVD player i would definatly recommend thisDvd set. Its better in this package if you want to own all six stories in one shot like I did. I had all of these on tape however My Copy of the Pirate Planet was poor and unwatchable. These Dvds in The Key To Time a true Gem. I highly recommend this.,1038009600,,543,3.7719298245614037
1715682,4,B000067FPE,"The Key To Time season of Doctor Who is one of the high points of Tom Baker's later years, and possibly even the best slate of episodes laid out for Baker and company since his debut season.  It's lovely to have them on shiny round things now instead of slowly-deteriorating tapes.  But those of you who have gotten used to the feature-rich Doctor Who DVD releases like ""Ark In Space,"" ""Caves Of Androzani,"" ""Remembrance Of The Daleks"" or the region 2 ""Doctor Who: The Movie"" release may feel a bit betrayed by these discs.  At most, there's a commentary, a trivia text subtitle, and a ""Who's Who"" on most of the discs, with some surviving raw location film footage on the ""Pirate Planet"" DVD.  When so much has been written in Doctor Who Magazine or the Howe-Stammers-Walker books about this season's creation and execution, one feels like perhaps these episodes were rushed to DVD.  Still, I can't fault them too much - producing special features for one disc takes long enough, but six?  So a solid four out of five stars for this box set.",1035331200,14,1042,4.605405405405405
1715683,4,B000067FPE,"they should have put it on fewer disks since dvd can hold more than the video tape and can store on both sides of a disk.
Hopefully they will do that on the E-space trillogy it saves storage space.
I only give it a 4 because they didn't take advantage of the abillity to store more of the stories in a smaller amount of space.",1035244800,,326,4.030769230769231
1715684,3,B000067FPE,"It's great to see Doctor Who coming to DVD, but as with all DVDs being made, those who master them should put in the best effort possible to make them look and sound great.  We should expect no less.  Compared to the other Dr Who DVDs on the market, ""The Key to Time"" series is of lower quality because they weren't given the same amount of attention during the remastering.
The video, while sharp and vibrant, suffers from occasional black horizontal 'video lines' that blip on once in a while.  These could easily have been cleaned up and are annoying to watch when they do appear.  Fortunately, they don't happen often (2-5 times an episode are they really noticable and bothersome.)
Second, there's audible hiss in the background.  With modern clean-up procedures, this could have been reduced or completely eliminated.  The hiss bothers me much more than the video lines because the sound is constant.  And other BBC Video releases in America such as ""Are You Being Served?"" do come across rather well in terms of the audio.
Okay, negative points aside let's now dwell on the positives.
The audio commentaries and informational text are probably the most informative they've ever been and are alone worth the price of the set.
The video itself is vibrant with color not being overly saturated and is quite sharp.  Video lines aside, the sharpness and saturation match that of other released Dr Who stories.  And, again, the video lines are not frequent.  Just annoying for when they do crop up.  It could be worse...
But this is the Key to Time on DVD.  It's been released, and that's how it is.  We have to accept it, warts and all.  I still say it's worth the purchase.  The good does outweigh the bad.  I just wish those doing the mastering would be more conscientious as they had done with previous Dr Who releases on DVD.",1033689600,16,1831,4.657320872274143
1715685,4,B000067FPE,"The Key to Time season, season 16, of Doctor Who is a mixed bag. As fans know, this was the first Doctor Who season to have a true ongoing storyline throughout the entire season. Yes, it's true, Season 8 does have the Master in each story, for a link of sorts. Each Season 8 story can be enjoyed on its own without confusion, while the average viewer watching in the 1970's who had started watching in the middle of the season might wonder what this ""Key To Time"" is. This experiment works, for the most part, although some of the stories are uneven. If I could, I would probably give the stories alone 3 stars, but the DVD commentaries and pop-up production text bump my rating up to 4 stars.
The Ribos Operation, The Stones of Blood, and The Androids of Tara work quite well, in my opinion. The Pirate Planet, Power of Kroll, and Armageddon Factor don't work quite as well.
The season is full of great double acts. Garron and Unstoffe in 'Ribos', The Pirate Captain and Mr. Fibuli in 'Pirate', Emilia Rumford & Vivien Fay in 'Stones' and Major Shapp and the Marshall in 'Armagedon'.
Tom Baker gets rather silly in some of the stories and, in my opinion, was allowed too much control with the character. A little flippancy is fine, but Tom's mugging to the camera and doing silly things like throwing coins in the air that take forever to fall would have never been allowed under Baker's first producer, Phillip Hinchliffe. Graham Williams needed to keep better control of his star. Tom's little eye rolling mad speech at the end of 'Armageddon Factor' is amusing but far too jokey.
Still, Tom Baker gives mostly marvellous performances and Mary Tamm shines as Romana.
The set is well packaged, with the 6 individually plastic cased stories in a nice presentation box. The artwork on the packages isn't all that pretty, but it's what's on the inside that counts.
Each story has terrific audio commentary and pop up production text. Tom Baker and Mary Tamm work well in their commentaries and don't have any of the tension that supposedly existed during the production of the stories. The other commetaries are nice, too, but the 3 with Tom are the most entertaining. Bios and Photo Galleries are on each disc, too. The only other extra is about 10 minutes of location filming from 'The Pirate Planet' which includes footage that wasn't in the story when broadcast. I wish there were more extras, but Warner Video and BBC Worldwide Americas gave the BBC in the UK very little time to prepare these 6 stories for release...
The picture quality and sound are terrific for programs that are over 20 years old.
I do hope that there aren't more season releases like this one. The only other season with an 'umbrella' theme is the 'Trial of a Time Lord' which was 14 episodes. The majority of Doctor Who doesn't have an ongoing storyline like programs such as The Sopranos, Buffy, or Babylon 5, which are more suited to the season set approach. I would rather have the stories that come out in the UK first, which are painstakingly restored and are packed with extras.
Still, I do recommend this set. It is a fun way to spend 9 hours. Acually 18 hours, if you watch the stories without the commentary and then with!",1033603200,41,3209,4.602094240837697

Having already filled my DVD and Blu-ray collection with the reboot series 1 to 9, I started looking for the classic episodes.  When I saw that the Key to Time episodes were available, I jumped on them as soon as I was able.  I remembered the Key to Time vividly, most especially because Douglas Adams wrote the Pirate Planet episode and, at the time, I was still soaking in the Hitchhiker books.

The Key to Time thread was wonderful then and it was wonderful all over again because of this DVD set.

This is some of the best Tom Baker, and Time Lady Romana joins him at the very beginning of the set. Watching it now brings back memories of just how fond of her I was as a boy/young teen. Sadly, actress Mary Tamm died of cancer in 2012.
By this point in the Tom Baker years, Tom was such a national institution that he could change lines of dialogue at his whim during shooting. Usually this worked out, and some of the most humorous episodes are in this set; not surprising when you also consider that Douglas Adams was one of the writers (""The Pirate Planet"").
Warning for K9 haters: he is in this set. Regardless of whether you like or dislike K9, you will have no regrets about making this purchase, which features remastered video and widescreen extra features.

1715839,4,B000067FPE,"Overall, the Doctor's quest for the Key to Time has good stories and great stories. I shall review each one starting with the best.

1. The Armageddon Factor: This six part story, which concludes the Key to Time series, is the best in the entire set. The Doctor and Romana land in the near end of a nuclear war between the planets, Atrios and Zeos. A third party, controlled by the Shadow, prompts both sides to war. The first three parts show the Doctor investigating Atrios and looking for the sixth segment while the last three show the appearance of the Shadow's lair and the Doctor confronting him. Here, K9 is more of an independent character since he has his own side of the story and the Shadow does have some moments as a villain. The last couple parts I fell were a bit rushed and random with a new character and idea entering in the fifth part of the story. That and the Doctor's idea for the Key to Time is justifiable.

2. The Pirate Planet: This four part story takes the Doctor to the planet, Zanak, where wealth flows freely and diamonds are considered cheap thanks to the Captain, for the second segment. This story is packed with fun ideas and good defining moments. There are good twists throughout the story and a cliffhanger on part 3. The ending seemed a bit anticlimatic though. The Doctor is swashbuckling in this and the parrot's kinda cute.

3. The Ribos Operation: This four part story begins the series and gives the Doctor a new companion, Romana. The first segment takes to the planet Ribos, a snowy planet. There, the Doctor encounters primitive natives, some conmen which join him against the prince, and a prince whose having a mature tantrum about losing his kingdom. This is an overall good story with the Doctor trying to out con the characters of the story. A couple touching moments amd that's it. Romana is a bit pissed about the Doctor not letting him help and the story feels like its a long conman plan being dragged out. Some good moments, but it can be slow.

4. The Power of Kroll: To me personally, The Power of Kroll and the Androids of Tara should both be in fourth place. But the Power of Kroll edges out the Androids of Tara because of several factors. This four part story brings the Doctor to Delta Magna, a swamp planet, for the fifth segment to the Key to Time. Due to the swamps, K9 is not seen in the story and stays in the Tardis. There is a methane refinery which the Doctor meets up with while Romana is taken by the natives, the Swampies. A battle happens in between them due to racism and competition for nature. Meanwhile, the Doctor and Romana investigate each side looking for the segment. Oh yeah, there's a mile wide squid called Kroll. This is in fourth place due the giant monster being cool and a little scary, the idea against racism, and the Doctor coming an inch to death three times in this story. This is better than the Androids of Tara due to good ideas but not story wise. In terms of story, while it's a bit exciting, it can be a bit bland.

5. The Androids of Tara: This four part search for the fourth segment has a better story overall than The Power of Kroll because while there is no deep morals or coll monsters, it shows a political showdown which is always a good watch. The Doctor lands on Tara and goes fishing while Romana finds the segment in the first part. However, she is taken by the enemy of the to-be-crowned-king prince of Tara and the segment is taken away. The Doctor meets with the prince and helps him develop an android to replace him at the coronation so the real him does not get killed by the enemy. This is a good story with androids being doubles of some characters and on different sides along with a sword fight to end it. The only problem is that its mainly two parties clashing, not three like the Armageddon Factor which makes a story better. In other words, it's a bit simplified.

6. The Stones of Blood: This is the worst story in the set, even though it's ok by itself. This four parter takes the Doctor and Romana to a rural part of Earth in the 70's and hyperspace for the third segment to the Key to Time. This is the worst because it feels like two stories stitched together by only one alien criminal. The stones, or the Ogri, are a little menacing, but nothing much to talk about. However, K9 is his own character again helping the researcher on Earth while the Doctor and Romana are in hyperspace. The Doctor's trial is a bit amusing but the comedy in the story just depletes any menace it had.

So overall, the Doctor's quest for the Key to Time is pretty good and I would still watch all of the stories to see what you would think. I resaerched this and a resource said The Power of Kroll was the worst and I made that fourth place. Definitely worth its money when you want to see some old Doctor Who stories and this is about as big as they come.",1437436800,2,4872,4.382743362831858

The only reason this is not 4 stars is because of all of the insipid BBC nonsense you have to get through to get to the actual Doctor Who stories. You will be smashing the 'skip forward' button repeatedly...",1417996800,,386,4.594202898550725

The Key to Time (which took up all of season 16 ) is among his best work.  The introduction of a fellow Time Lord (Romana) as side-kick/equal works well and the writing is as good as it has ever been, including a complete Douglas Adams episode (Pirate Planet).  The supplemental content is entertaining and informative.  The price ended up less than the sum of each episodes individual purchase so.

go that low...
I bought this new for $67.00 and though that was a pretty good deal since full retail is something like $99.00, wish I had paid the current price of $60.00 though.
There are a total of 7 DVD's in this set and 6 adventures so for $60.00 you are getting each Doctor Who story for $10.00 each or each DVD in the set for actually under that if you are counting the special feature 7th disc.
These are NOT my all time favorite episodes but for a good price I'll buy anything that's classic Doctor Who and if you are collecting
the whole series while they are still in print then The Key to Time is a must own, also because its a good price for a whole season of Classic Doctor Who and where else are you going to find 6 stories for $60.00 in of any Classic Doctor Who seriously?
For my part The Stones of Blood and the Armageddon Factor are the best of the bunch here, certainly not the best of the Tom Baker years by any stretch but if you are a completest and fan then these are the only episodes with Mary Tamm as Romana and introduce her character. These are not the worst of the Tom Baker era nor the best, these are the middle stories...
My personal fav Tom Baker stories are: Robot, Genesis of the Daleks, Terror of the Zygons, The Brain of Morbius, Pyramids of Mars, The Hand of Fear, The Face of Evil, The Robots of Death, The Talons of Weng-Chiang, The Horror of Fang Rock, The Sun Makers, Destiny of the Daleks, The City of Death, Meglos and Legopolis ... but they ain't cheap!
So if you love Tom Baker as the Doc and want as many Tom Baker stories as possible for the most affordable price get this set NOW!!!!",1393977600,2,1763,4.142857142857143

That said I really enjoyed the ideas and concepts that were presented in the season and thus this particular offering is in my top twenty Tom Baker, as the Doctor, episodes list.",1385424000,2,457,4.264367816091954

1715964,5,B000067FPE,"The Key to Time boxset includes all 6 serials of the entire 26 episode season 16. Each story stands on its own and is tied to the subplot of The Doctor searching out the all-powerful key to time.

Whether you are already a fan of classic Doctor Who or are looking for a good place to jump in, this is an amazing boxset. Every story is good, if not great, and for the most part they are all excellently paced.

-The Ribos Operation -- Where it may be a bit off in the pacing, the acting and characterization throughout the story is wonderful.
-The Pirate Planet -- The most scifi of the season, Pirate Planet centers around an astounding concept and being written by Douglas Adams you can expect some wild dialogue.
-The Stones of Blood -- Starts off in one direction, heads in another by the end, all of it a lot of fun.
-The Androids of Tara -- Takes a literary source and twists it into a bit of scifi. Quick paced political intrigue.
--The Power of Kroll -- This one and the following one about tie for wonkiest story of the season, but the cast keeps it enjoyable. Philip Madoc pops up again in the show, although with far less menace than he had last time in Brain of Morbius.
--The Armageddon Factor -- What would be a pretty excellent season ending showdown is tempered by the fact that it would have been better as a 4-part serial. Still enough going on so as to not be boring as 6 parts, but the story suffers.

Not only do you get 6 enjoyable stories, the boxset is packed with extras. Every story includes a Making Of doc, you get some actor and characters featurettes, a look back at some of the locations, and interviews and tv spots from the time of airing.

The highlight for me of all the extras was the banter on the commentaries featuring Tom Baker and Mary Tamm. They are together for all 26 episodes (and a few of the stories include a 2nd commentary option, most featuring the directors of the serials) and are very insightful and with Baker, frequently strange and hilarious.

So, for old fans or fans looking for an excellent place to start a classic Doctor Who collection, The Key To Time is a wonderful addition and at a perfect price as well considering how much individual stories typically cost.",1379462400,5,2223,4.412195121951219

Anyway,this series or season as we say in the USA has a central theme that exposes a little bit information about the Doctor. The ""higher powers"" that Guard the"" Who-verse"" are in conflict and it's up to the Doctor to save what he can. His new companion,Romana,is a beauty and smart as the Doctor but naive about how people act. Please enjoy this as much as I do! And of course,there's K-9!!!",1376784000,,523,4.634408602150538

1716006,5,B000067FPE,"Way back when, the Nebraska Public Television Network played this series, which, in the days before VCRs, meant rearranging my life around the one time it came on each week.

After all but one episode, I managed to see the whole series. The last episode? The play time coincided with the first hour of pledge week.

If you lived in the Central Time Zone end of Nebraska, that final episode played before the first hour of pledge week. If you lived in the Mountain Time Zone part of Nebraska, you never (""NEVER"") saw the final episode because they played the first hour of the pledge drive instead!

I wrote an angry letter to the management of NPTV, noting what it is like to watch all but one episode of a serial, only to have the final one, where all things come together, denied you so you could watch two NPTV celebrities harp on about how wonderful PTV is and how you should...blah, blah, blah.

I got a nice letter back, explaining why it was done that way. A synopsis of the final episode was enclosed. I was donating at the $60 a year rate at that point, I think, perhaps more. I was so disgusted with the answer to why the western end of the state didn't get to the final episode that I didn't send a penny in to NPTV for over ten years after that: Don't mess with Dr. Who fans, eh?!

NPTV and I eventually came back together, I make my contribution each year. But, best of all, I found this Dr. Who set with all episodes! Was it worth waiting 33-34 years to see that final episode? Oh, yeah! Tom Baker rules!",1353369600,2,1518,4.293706293706293
1716007,5,B000067FPE,"I am also partial to Tom Baker in believing that he was the best incarnation of the Doctor. I can't stand the new series for various reasons, one of which being that it's becoming so popular that it's no longer an exclusive thing, and then the quality takes a nose dive. The Key to Time series is fairly short. Most of the episodes are often shown on some PBS stations (or used to be) fairly often. It would be nice if there were more box sets available. Unfortunately Mary Tamm passed away recently. Seeing her in these old episodes, one is reminded of how stunningly beautiful she was as Romana.",1349222400,,597,4.4363636363636365

I have all of the Tom Baker episodes on VHS.  I would like to buy them on DVD.  I also enjoy the New Seasons of Doctor Who.  The BBC is now making the monsters more believe-able.  With the old series you just had to over look the low budget and get into the characters. Tom Baker and his companions did a good job of acting out their parts.",1317427200,,594,3.983050847457627
1716011,5,B000067FPE,"Tom Baker is a phenomenal actor. I have seen him in Sinbad, a horror movie, a made for television mini series,and of course Doctor Who. In fact he was the first Doctor I was introduced to. As a matter of fact, this series, The Key to Time, was among the first episodes I saw. By todays standards of course the special effects and the storyline are passe to say the least. But to a true Doctor Who fan (known best as a Whovian), these are among some of thr best episodes in a story arc. Others include the E-space trilogy, Trial of a Time Lord, and Bakers final episodes and Davisons first. Set out to find the six segments to the key to time, the Doctor and his newest companion Romana, must travel across time and space meeting villain after villain. Several books were written that tell tales of the adventures in between the segments. From the Ribos Operartion to the Armageddon Factor, each episode is rich with lush scenery (except the Power of Kroll of course LOL), classic villains and classic characters that want to be good or bad in their own right. If you're a true Whovian, you have this box set in your collection.",1316304000,2,1127,4.449275362318841
1716012,5,B000067FPE,"This six disc box set features the entire season of Doctor who enetilted ""The Key to Time"" Series. The Doctor having left Gallefry and Leela and K-9 mark 1 behind has been summoned by the White guardian. A being of pure goodness and the right that he knows nothing of evil and hatred. He has charged the Doctor with locating and rebuilding the key to time a perfect cube that when in place would allow its user the power to control everything. The White Guardian needs it for a monumental moment in the cosmos and the Doctor is the only one who can find the compents and bring it to him. He also give him a warning the Black Guardian is also after the key. The Black Guardian is the polar opisite of the White Guardian and also wants the key and will have his agents in place to get the key as well. With that the Doctor returns to the TARDIS and meets his newest compaion Romanadvoratrelundar or Romana for short and K-9 mark 2. Romana gives the Doctor the deviced needed to locate and retrive the segemtns of the key which can be anything or anyone throughout all of time and space. They go to thier first planet in the episodes entitled ""The Ribos Operation"". On the feral and primative planet Ribos two con men have just made contact with the notorious and feared prince The Graff Vindakay exciled ruler and general. Along with his Second in command Shelack and what is left of his troops he begins to make a deal with them for the planet. What the Prince doesn't know is that the con men have planeted a ruse in the form of a very useful stone called Jethrik a mineral that can power space ships for centuires and the market for them is very high. The Prince wants the planet and the stone as does the Doctor and the con men. Soon enough the Doctor has gotten tangled up in the con and has to stop the prince and save the entire planet from a tyrant that may just want to rule the universe.
In the next episode entitled ""The Pirate Planet"" The Doctor and Romana a have the first segment and locating the second one has been easy. What the Doctor notes is that its the ice planet Calufrax and that its rather boring and should be easy. So easy in fact that the Doctor allows Romana to land the TARDIS. Once outside they discover that they have not landed on Calufrax but landed in a strange city filled with people and that it along with the rest of the world called Zanak. The Doctor has encountered the ruler a crazed half man half robot calling himself Captain. There he has managed to hollow out the planet and make it into a giant craft taking smaller planets inside of it and destroying them for the needed materials to go on. What the Doctor doesn't know is why and what's the purpse of the Captain's journey. The Doctor also stumbles upon a small group of psychic rebels called the Mentiads who discover with every destroyed planet they grow in power and want to stop the Captain at all costs. Can the Doctor fogure out who the Captain reports to and find out what happen to the second segemtn to the key to time before its too late? OR has the Doctor finally meet his match? Just watch the next episode entitled ""The Pirate Planet"" to find out.
In episode three entitled ""The Stones of Blood"" the Doctor and Romana have landed on Earth in the late 20th century outside Cormwall near the fabled area called the Nine Travelers of standing stones. The Doctor is convinced the segment is here but can't get a proper read on it.  While around the stones the Doctor and Romana meet archaeologist, Professor Amelia Rumford and her freind Vivian Fey. The professor talks speaks of the fact that the stones have been used by the druids for the last few centuires in worship of Caillech goddess of magic and war. The Doctor goes to investigate and see if he can find any clues to the segment. Meanwhile Romana contiunes to search the countryside to see if the segement can be there with the faint signal. What the Doctor and Romana peice togeather is that Vivian Fey is an immortal alien and has been trapped on Earth for all this time. But she didn't come alone. Three living stones have come with her and they must live on human blood. The Doctor and Romana are up against ancient druid myths or aliens possing as gods. Either way it has something to do with segement and they need to find it or become another sacrifice to the druids gods of old.
Episode four entitled ""The Andriods of Tara"" The Doctor has gotten a bit tired or locating the segemtns and decides to go on fishing trip while he lets Romana go and find the fourth segment. She's a bit angry that the Doctor would just go and fish while she goes and look for the segement. Romana sets off and finds the segement rather easily. However after a wild beast nearly killed her she is saved by Count Grendel. There he notices the simlairtes to a guest of his named Princess Strella and is convinced that she is a robotic duplicate.  What Romana doesn't know is she has become a pawn in the Count's plan to take the throne for himself. His cousin the Prince has been threaten with the life of his beloved the Princess if he takes the throne. The only thing for it is to confuse the Count with an andriod but with no one to fix his. His swordmaster has found just the person to fix it the Doctor.  The Doctor has to find Romana save the kingdom and take back the segment before its all to late.
In the fifth episode entitled ""The Power of Kroll"" the Doctor and Romana land on the planet called Delta Three. There they have encountered two groups the native inhabitants who were placed there years ago called ""swampies"" by the other group of refinery workmen who are harvesting methaine gas. The swampies have blamed them for the awakening of thier god a giant squid called Kroll and he is angry that humans have come and taken what is not there.  Both sides confuse the Doctor and Romana for someone else. The workmen think he's a gun runner supplying weapons to the swampies. While the swampies think they are working for the comany and want them off the planet. What the Doctor can't figure out is where the segment is and what it has to do with the god Kroll. Will he figure out this mystery before its too late?
In the final epside entitled ""The Armageddon Factor"" The Doctor and Romana have located the final segement on the war torn planet of Atrios. Atrios has been in a stalemate with the planet Zeos for ages with no end in sight. The Marshall supreme commander of the Atrios fleet has thrown everything against them and seems to be going mad. Even worse he fears the sole remaining member of the royal family Princess Astra may try and take his command.  The Doctor has stumbled upon a great plot and fears he may have finally found that while finding the first five segements were easy the last and most needed is going to be hard. With strange beings and the Black Guardian agent called the Shadow working against him will the Doctor be able to save the universe and keep the balance?",1311638400,,6958,4.394879751745539
1716013,4,B000067FPE,There are a couple of stories in this collection that are pretty bad. But the rest are absolutely fabulous. The Androids of Tara is a wonderful take on The Prisoner of Zenda. Mary Tamm as Romana 1 is bloody awful. She's stunning to look at but is pretty darn bad. She gets better though. Tom Baker is Tom Baker. Simply the best. It's a great fun collection.,1310774400,,357,4.343283582089552
1716014,5,B000067FPE,"I believe there are people intent on getting every Doctor Who story created in the 20th century, and these people will buy this no matter what I say, and there are those would not care to see a television space opera from the 1970s, and these people will not buy this.  I can think of three kinds of people who might be interested in my comments: someone wondering if this collection is good way to get a sense of what Dr. Who was in its golden age of the late 1970s, a casual Who won't buy everything, but is looking for a good buy, and finally someone curious about the early career of novelist Douglas Adams.  I believe that some people from all three categories would be very happy with this boxed set.

Doctor Who in the 1970s was quite a phenomenon. Viewers had a strong empathy with shows star played by Tom Baker and the show getting the highest ratings it would every see despite a pitiful special effects budget.  the show featured a space hero called The Doctor who travelled through space and time in a police box.  The doctor came from a race beings called Time Lords, and was usually accompanied by woman who served as a portable damsel in distress, and sometimes and additional companion.  In the late 1970's the extra companion was a robot dog named K-9. The show was presented in a serial format in which a story was spread out over a number of episodes, and different stories were quite different.  If you are not familiar with the show, then I imagine you would say, ""That's weird"".  Indeed, it is weird, and there has never been anything quite like it, but it is a very popular weird show, and you might enjoy it for the same reason that many other people enjoy it.  So, if you want a sense of what the show was like then you would want to watch a number of stories in order.  In general, buying multiple stories costs a fair amount, and this is the only collection of 6 20th century Doctor Who stories that I am aware of, and on the whole it costs a lot less than individual episodes.  They let us buy season 16 as a single set because put together the season was an epic quest, to find the six segments of the keys to time, and in many ways the over all story is better than any of the six parts.  The version is special edition.  Every episode has at least one commentary by cast and crew (14 of 26 episodes have two commentaries), and every episode has subtitled production notes.  I thought some of the commentary was quite interesting.  There is a documentary about the producer Graham Williams who was the main creative force behind the whole idea of making a season of Doctor Who a quest, and the context of how he got put in charge of that show.  There are special documentaries about the making of 5 out of six of the stories in the collection--that does mean that there was story that they really did not want to discuss the production of.  Beyond that the additions are a bit thrown in but a couple of the throw ins are very entertaining.  There are old videos of Tom Baker reading scary stories, and he is very good at it.  Tom Baker is usually very funny when playing Doctor Who, but he seems very good at doing a serious reading of a scary story.  The best story in the set was written by Saki.  Another interesting snippet is an old comedy piece called ""Weird Science"" which pokes fun at the science in season 16 of Doctor Who. On the whole, the extras are very good.

If you have seen a fair amount of 20th century Doctor Who and are wondering if this video collection is your thing, then you would want to know more about each story.  It seems that for many of these stories feelings about the quality differ wildly, and there are five stories than many people feel might be the best in collection, and one story that most people seem not to like because of the really bad special effects.  So, my personal feelings on any of the episodes are not the point, and I will try to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each story.

The first story--the Ribos Operation-- begins was a being claiming to be ""The White Guardian"" telling the doctor to find the six segments of key to time which have the power to ""restore the balance of the universe.""  He also tells the doctor that there is a ""Black Guardian"" who would like to use key to time for evil.  The Doctor is shown to be familiar with the concept of guardians so the Manichean mythology that underlies the story is to be taken at face value.  The Guardian claiming to be white uses threat of death to get the Doctor to fulfill the quest, and he uses deception to get Romona--another Time Lord--to act as the doctor's assistant.  This means that the claiming to be embodiment of good has no qualms about using force and lies to get his way. In any event, in the first story, the Doctor, Romona and K-9 go to a backward medieval looking planet to find the first segment of the key to time, but encounter a strange scuffle involving a pair of criminal who want to sell the backward planet to a deposed monarch.  The medieval setting works well with the quest for a segment concept, and the story is humerus, well timed and fun. Romona--played by Mary Tam--has been thrown in with the doctor and there is a lot friction between the two, but this works well.

The next story occupies an unusual place in the history of television because it is the first television script written by Douglas Adams who would go on to become best selling novelist.  It came out at about the same time as the radio script version ""Hitchhikers Guide to Galaxy.""  The basic story involves a pirate who is able to make the outer shell of his planet materialize around another planet The captain in this story called ""Pirate Planet"" has a robot parrot that is adept at killing for its captain. The Doctor Romona and K-9 must not only find the second segment of the key, but stop the captain before he materialize his planet around the earth and kills the whole of the human race.  The pirate idea fits into the quest idea well, and it is filled Adam's sense of humor.

The third story is called ""Stones of Blood"" which puts the doctor in conflict with a group of witches in 20th century England.  Of course, as usual in Doctor Who stories, what gives these witches their power is an alien intelligence.  I found the way the story resolved a bit anticlimactic, but I have learned that a number of people found it satisfying.

The fourth story is ""The Androids of Tara"" which is a well mannered and elegant version of the ""Prisoner of Zenda."" The story is complicated by technology that permits androids to impersonate people, and by special electronics in the crossbow bolts and swords that the characters fight with.  The story plays very little emphasis on main theme of the book, namely that a person forced to impersonate a king because necessity might actually make better king than the king.  So, the story becomes a drama centered on action and sword fights.

The fifth story called ""The Power of Kroll"", is the one that might really be a bad idea, but had some positive points.  According to the write up that accompanies the DVD collection, the writer Robert Holmes was told to create the largest monster that had ever been in a Doctor Who story, and part of the difficulty with the story is that with special effects budget you could not create a building sized monster that was believable.  Another problem is that the natives who worship Kroll are green skinned people who wear nothing but loin clothes and capes. I know exactly why the writer chose to have them wear loin clothes and capes, that was what Aztecs wore before the Spanish came, and these natives think Romona should be honored by their plans to sacrifice her to Kroll. In effect, these are alien Aztecs.  The humans are intent on driving these natives off their land so that they can produce more methane fuel, so there is fairly interesting political situation because while the natives are portrayed as far from noble savages the civilized humans are in many ways more savage than the natives. The author of this script was Robert Holmes who created a number of good scripts for doctor who, including the ""Ribos Operation"" and his scripts are usually interesting even when they do not really work.  As a story, this one really does not work because people wearing green make up all over their bodies worshiping something that looks like a cheap model of a plastic squid does not work, but it does make a fifth part of the great mythic quest, so it can be enjoyed in the context of the larger story.

""The Armageddon Factory"" is the last story so it has a great deal to do: it must be centered on large enough stakes to qualify as a dramatic climax, and it has to create an adequate resolution to underlying plot of the whole season.  To fulfill the first requirement, it makes the final story about preventing the ""Black Guardian"" from turning the whole universe into a great war.  Obviously, in the climax a great quest the hero would do things like rescue a princess from near certain doom.  Resolving the conflict of the entire season is a bit trickery because it is implicit in the whole season that the Doctor will have to decide what he does when he has the key to time which grants its holder god like powers.  I am not giving away the answer because people who want a spoiler can find the answer on many web-cites, and some people do not want the answer.  Lets just say that I was happy with the way that things were resolved, but some people found the whole thing anti-climactic.

Interestingly Douglas Adams who wrote the second story was given the job or writing the conclusion where the Doctor faces the big decision, even though other people were the writers of ""the Armageddon Factor."" Adams was in fact about to be promoted to script writer.  For this reason, I think that the collection might be interesting to Douglas Adams fans, even though I doubt that Adams fans are usually who fans.

Taking into account all of the extras, I think the collection is pretty good.",1308528000,2,10024,4.475562877539813

1716031,5,B000067FPE,"The Key to Time season features, without a doubt, some of the best of the various aspects of ""Doctor Who"" that have made the series so beloved:

1. Strong, competent companions: in this case, we get two.  There's Romanadvoratrelundar (the Doctor gives her the choice of shortening her name to Romana or Fred), played by the beautiful Mary Tamm; and K-9 Mk. II, voiced by John Leeson.  Though she starts out somewhat irritating, Romana soon becomes one of the Doctor's most capable and helpful companions (sometimes even managing to upstage the Doctor in brilliance), while K-9 is as helpful and adorable as ever.

2. The plots, while not always making sense, go along at a nice clip, with little to no padding.  My particular favorites are ""The Pirate Planet,"" ""The Stones of Blood,"" and ""The Androids of Tara.""

3. The hammy performances.  Oh God, the hammy performances.  In ""The Pirate Planet"" alone (written, appropriately enough, by Douglas Adams) we get the Captain, who gives us such wonderfully bombastic lines as ""NO!  BY THE WINGS OF THE SKY DEMON, I SAY NOOOOOO!!!""  This is the kind of ham that is a joy to watch, rather than a chore to sit through.

4. The humor.  In particular there's ""The Stones of Blood,"" in which every other scene after the first episode has some sort of funny moment, whether it's the Doctor insisting that K-9 has always wanted to be a bloodhound, despite the robot dog's insistence to the contrary; or the Doctor's wily maneuvers during his trial by the Megara.

For those of you who have never seen classic ""Doctor Who,"" or have never seen ""Doctor Who"" at all, this is a perfectly good way to begin.",1252713600,14,1639,4.708771929824562

A similar set was released (at a lower price) in 2002, but this one is jam-packed with all the extras of that one plus many more, including making-of documentaries.

Out of them all the The Ribos operation and the Stones of Blood are my favorites. The Power of Kroll is the weakest of the stories, but Tom in is usual way makes up for it.

First of all, it's been nearly seven years since the original set came out.  Second, the original ""Key to Time"" set was a rushed North American release (a highly unusual situation described in other reviews) which included none of the fine extras the Doctor Who DVDs are known for. Further, the episodes were only minimally remastered.  This ""Special Edition"" is meticulously remastered with, I believe, over 7 hours of new extras.  Third, and perhaps least important, this set is very nicely packaged in a multifold case very similar to the Series  1-4 sets of the new Doctor Who series. As a result, it takes up far less shelf space!

With regard to the episodes themselves, they are, admittedly, not the series' best.  However, I have a great deal of nostalgia for all of them and find them highly enjoyable.  You have some of the finest scriptwriters the show ever had here, including Robert Holmes (The Armageddon Factor) and Douglas Adams (The Pirate Planet).

In short, if you never bought the first ""Key to Time"" set, you still have to buy this.  If you did, you have to buy this!",1236384000,7,1272,4.608888888888889
1716066,5,B000067FPE,"I have been reading the reveiews for the new ""Key To Time Set"", and I find it funny that they only get the story only half right on why they have re-released this set.

So I checked on [...] (Steve Manfred's website) who is the man to talk too about all Doctor Who DVD (and hell, even VHS) releases in the US. FROM STEVE MANFRED's WEB SITE:

A very Frequently Asked Question I've been getting lately is ""Why are they re-releasing The Key to Time (especially when half the rest of the series isn't out yet?)""

The answer has to do with how and why we got the 2002 edition of this set. In their first DVD releases in North America in 2001 and early 2002, BBC Worldwide Americas included a questionnaire that pointed to a website poll where their customers could choose from amongst a list of titles which Doctor Who title they would most like to see released next.  On that list was The Key to Time, and it won the poll.  They went back to their partners in the UK and requested that it be released.  They met with some resistance as the UK BBC people didn't feel the time was right for their market for a box set of this many episodes to be released, however the BBC WA people emphasized how important box sets had already become in the North American market and how having one was in fact now essential to get stores to stock Doctor Who titles at all.  They'd had a wave of some individual titles in 2002 that many chains chose not to stock because all they were was individual stories.  A box set was now seen as a requirement to save the range's future in North America.  And so an agreement was reached whereby The Key to Time could be released in late 2002 in North America without there having been a UK release first.  This is the only time that this has happened, and it probably will never happen again.  Due to there being no UK release, the volume of episodes in the set, and the quick turnaround time needed, the titles in the 2002 set came out with only minimal extras.  Although they did all have commentaries and production notes, they had no featurettes, only a few deleted scenes, and the restoration work was very minimal.

 Nowadays, with the revival of the series' fortunes that began with the coming of the new series, the market for classic Doctor Who in the UK has become much healthier, and box sets have become much more attractive, and you'll have noticed there have been more of them in recent years, and that when they come out they get the same full treatment extras-wise that the individual titles get.  And so in 2007, they decided to bring The Key to Time to the UK, with that full press of extras.  The release pattern in North America is for them to bring out the UK's recent titles in largely the same order that they come out in the UK, but they decided to hold off for a while on this particular title as they already had the old edition on the market, and also they'd fallen behind the increased pace of releases coming from the UK and wanted to catch us up on the titles we had never seen before first.  Now in 2009, that catching-up has been largely completed, and they feel they can spend a release slot on bringing us the UK's edition of The Key to Time, and will begin selling it in North America on March 3 with the ""Special Edition"" moniker attached to all the titles to distinguish it from the original edition.

  The only things that were on the 2002 edition that are not in the Special Edition are the original photo galleries(which were very minimal and have been replaced by much better ones on the special edition) and the Who's Who text file biographies of the principal cast members, which were discontinued from all releases some time ago.

1716068,5,B000067FPE,"It's already been covered what extras are going to be on these discs, and they're pretty awesome for a Doctor Who fan.

So, why is this being re-released here in the States?  Back in the earliest part of the decade, BBC Video here in North America rushed out a set of ""The Key to Time"", due to the high popularity of Baker's Fourth Doctor compared to others in this country.

This version never saw the light of day in the United Kingdom, Australia, Europe, etc.

In late 2007, the Key to Time finally saw release in the rest of the world.  And this time, the Restoration Team and 2 entertain did the full restoration and documentary job they normally do on releases.  (The first set of Key to Time was the only one ever released first in the U.S.)

So, enter March 2009.  North America is caught up with all but the very latest releases from Britain.  Given the, quite frankly, haphazard method and quality of the first North American release, it was decided to bring the set that Britain/Rest of the World got to the States.

If you don't want to buy it, that's fine.  May sees two new releases that are only 4 and 5 months behind Britain's release schedule, respectively.  And that's the pace we'll likely stay at.

As for me, I'd glad we're getting this in the States.  Since it was already made, and we're so close behind Britain now, why not?",1233014400,8,1348,4.426829268292683

1716070,5,B000067FPE,"For me, Tom Baker is the quintessential Doctor. Probably, I like him  because he was the first one I saw. He is funny: the hair, the eyes, and of course, the scarf. This story with the six sub-plots is a nice story arc. Romana or Fred (Mary Tamm) is elegant, beautiful and witty. She makes for a good companion, not the most fun of the companions, but definitely perfect for this story arc. My favorite story of the episodes is the Douglas Adam story ""The Pirate Planet."" It has a interesting mystery and some good dialog. The cheesiest is ""The Power of Kroll,"" but it has a good soliloquoy by Baker as he tries to encourage himself to approach the giant squid. The Ribos operation had some good characters. All the stories are fun.

The conclusion is perfect. The Doctor smiling from ear to ear because the Tardis is taking him and Romana to random locations throughout the universe. The kicker is that they never know where they'll be until they get there. He is grinning because that is his perfect idea of fun.

About the DVDs, I haven't watched the interviews yet. I am sure they are interesting with Tamm, Baker and some of the directors. The picture and the sound qualites are excellent. The quality is better than when I watched them in reruns for the first time in the 1980s.",1230422400,,1284,4.502145922746781

As well, there are new making-of documentaries regarding each of the shows per each segment of the Key that are, again, totally new.

I am biased towards loving this season of Tom Baker's run. Thus, if you aren't that crazy about these then, yes, the purchase is totally unnecessary. However, if you are 'avid', then this set should be rewarding to succumb to the 'double-dip'... with the new special features in plenty...

WHY, when avid Dr. Who fans are waiting for the next NEW releases, which are coming two at a time every two or three months, is the BBC releasing (albeit a 'Special Collection') 'THE KEYS TO TIME' again???

This series has been available for about three years, and is STILL available. Are we to believe that what can possibly be added to this 'SPECIAL COLLECTION' was not available three years ago???

1716073,4,B000067FPE,"The first attempt at doing a season-long story arc with ""Doctor Who,"" the entirety of the show's sixteenth season was devoted to the Doctor's quest for the Key to Time, an object that has the power to stop time or hold it in place. For all six adventures, the Doctor and his companion, the first version of Romana, hunt down one segment to the key, always wary of the Black Guardian, who seeks it for his own power.
The series begins with the four-part adventure ""The Ribos Operation,"" a rather dull beginning. The cast and crew do what they can, but the story is rather uninteresting. The follow-up adventure, ""The Pirate Planet,"" is more interesting, but also does little to keep the viewers interest for the entire four episodes. This is followed by ""The Stones of Blood,"" the 100th ""Doctor Who"" serial produced. This is a good entry to the series, with chills, thrills, and humor.
""The Androids of Tara"" is also a worthy adventure, mixing dark age and computer technology to create a fine serial. The fifth serial, the four-part serial ""The Power of Kroll,"" is the weakest link in the series. Writer Robert Holmes, who wrote some fantastic work for the series, has a brief stumble with this one, which is overall very silly.
The final serial, the six-part adventure ""The Armageddon Factor,"" is the best of the adventures, tying up loose ends, and the Black Guardian finally makes an appearance in the finale. Chills, thrills and great humor make this a great end to the season.
Overall, ""The Key to Time"" is an interesting idea that was overall worthwhile. While a couple of the serials didn't match up to classic ""Who,"" the series ended with a bang, and proved that there was still life in the show.

Here Graham Williams and Douglas Adams bring the humor to the fore front and while witty especially with Adams' own ""The Pirate Planet"" it often leaves Dr. Who fans cold.  Mary Tamm is a knockout and the jokes come fast and furious.  For newcomers to Dr. Who via the new season this is a fine introduction to the real show.",1208736000,,436,4.636363636363637
1716086,4,B000067FPE,"This is late 70's Who. Personally, I prefer mid 70's which has more dramatic action, with greater stories. However, I do enjoy some of the silliness of the late 70's, particularly the Doctor's humor. I saw some good comical scenes in the first story of this set, and also the second story. The ""Stones of Blood"" wasn't too comical, but good, cause it reminded me of the mid-70's horror era. The 4th story wasn't my favorate of the set, but OK, and I havn't watched the last 2 stories yet. If you like cheap scifi with not a bunch of action, but has a little humor thrown in here and there, this is a good set. Let me also mention that this season is 6 stories which come together as 1 story, which I think is neat. I wish there were more special features though. And for pic and sound quality, they could have done a better job restoring this set, but I'm not picky so it didn't bother me. Beware that the UK just released this season in a better restored set with more special features. It may one day hit the states, so you may want to wait, but beware that the price for that may be much higher (I don't know). This set here though is a great deal considering how much it cost to buy these stories separate",1208476800,,1209,4.2155172413793105

Solid writing and acting save the day on this DVD set.  I enjoyed every disc and am glad it is part of my collection now.  I was suprised to see that Douglas Adams wrote one of the stories for this set.  Also, where most of the discs give a four part story, the fianl disc is a six part story.  Loved it!",1184371200,,482,3.78
1716090,5,B000067FPE,"This fantastic ""Doctor Who"" box set is unprecedented in at least two ways. Firstly, the very idea of linking all six storylines of the show's sixteenth season into one epic meta-story was and remains ambitiously inventive, something not really attempted before and rarely repeated on such a grand scale since. Each story is quite different and episodic in the usual ""Doctor Who"" fashion, and yet in all of them the Doctor and his assigned assistant Romana are searching for the six segments of the Key to Time hidden scattered throughout time and space--a mission hoisted on the reluctant Doctor by the White Guardian, an immensely powerful cosmic being concerned with maintaining the balance of the universe. In this quest, the Doctor, Romana, and K9 will come across all manner of challenges: clever con-men and tenacious tyrants, peregrinating planets and apoplectic pirates, daft Druids and strolling stones, antique androids and crafty counts, cornered colonialists and colossal calamari, and finally missile-happy militarists and sadistic shadows. All in a day's work if you're a Time Lord, I guess.

Secondly, as of this date this is the only fully complete season of classic ""Doctor Who"" available on DVD, and so it gives the viewer a much more realistic and authentic sense of what watching this show from week to week would've been like. That is, in other DVD releases the BBC has concentrated on classics, fan favorites, turning points--storylines that really stand out for some reason, in other words. But no show can maintain such a high strung level of intensity constantly, even a great show like ""Doctor Who""--no, mixed in among the rare landmarks will of course be unremarkably good or just okay stories and, yes, even a few clunkers. And that's exactly what we find here in ""The Key to Time Set"" in fact: all six stories are very enjoyable, creative, and fun, but the quality is indeed noticeably variable. More representative of the show's overall stellar strengths and endearing weaknesses, really.

Besides, with Tom Baker as the Doctor, what have you got to lose? Yeah, it's a box set, but go ahead and splurge a little. After all, you only live once--unless you're a Time Lord, of course.

P.S. The six storylines in this DVD set all make up one overarching story arc, as mentioned, and they're probably best watched in that manner. For that reason, and in terms of economics and convenience, this box set is probably the way to go, especially if you're a fervent Doctor Who fan. However, if you are exclusively interested only in a single DVD from this set, they are sold individually as well:

Wish someday the next season will come out, when Douglas Adams where script editor, but in the meanwhile, this box is providing me as much fun as I could expect. though I think that the best Doctor Who period is still the one of the Hinchcliff's production, this season shows still enough care and professionality by the actors, the writers, the producers and all the television workers.

1716113,5,B000067FPE,"This DVD collection is a classic series from the Tom Baker era, and a must-have for any Doctor Who fan (Whovian).

About the Doctor:

Doctor Who is a science fiction television show that was filmed in the UK and was picked up and broadcast by American public television stations for a long number of years.  The show is about a Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey who travels through space and time in a vessel known as the TARDIS, which stands for Time And Relative Dimension In Space.  The TARDIS can go anywhere in the Universe, though the Doctor tends to favor Earth's own solar system a great deal.  The TARDIS is not just a space ship, but also a time-machine, meaning the Doctor and his companions can also go forward or backward in time.

Quirks about the show:

The television show was so long running that there was no one actor who could have remained as ""the Doctor"" for such a long period of time.  When the show first started off it was in black and white.  Tom Baker was actually the fourth version of the Doctor by the time his 1970s era came around.  Whenever a new actor assumed the role, the Doctor was said to have ""re-generated"", meaning the old form/body passed away, being replaced by a new body.  Time Lords could regenerate a dozen times, which basically meant that they had 12 lives to live.  Tom Baker was a refreshing, younger person than previous versions of the Doctor; though the Doctor often said he was 700+ years old.  Another quirky feature of the show is that the TARDIS was a ""police call box.""  This was a blue box-shaped thing that basically resembled a large phone booth in appearance and size, and it was larger on the INSIDE than it was on the OUTSIDE.  (I told you it was quirky.)

The Key to Time Series:

This is the series that features Mary Tamm's version of Romana (another Time Lord who assists the Doctor).  While I always prefered Lala Ward's version of Romana, Mary Tamm is great too.  The Key to Time is about segments of the Key that are scattered throughout the Universe.  Due to dire circumstances, the Doctor and Romana are on a mission to recover the Key so that order can be restored, and to prevent Evil from dominating Good throughout the Cosmos.  The good thing about this series, and Baker's era in general, was that it explored remote and exotic corners of the Universe, stretching our imaginations for what could possibly lie out there in the dark depths of space.  So the Doctor and Romana encounter many strange and interesting new creatures and civilizations along their journey.  And part of the fun is allowing your own imagination to get swept up in the story.  You cannot depend on the special effects to do it for you, because if you watch the show with such a critical eye then you'll just never get it.  The special effects are ""bad"" because there was hardly any money funding this show.  But that is also what makes this show and this series amazing.

If you can tell me who the Master and K9 are, and what a sonic screw driver or a Dalek is, then you are a true Who fan!

Cheers,

Adam Platts",1163203200,2,3069,4.469424460431655
1716114,5,B000067FPE,"This is one of the BBC's best Doctor Who releases and gives us a whole season of lively adventures.  In many ways these stories represent the Tom Baker era at its peak: there are great comedic moments but they don't interfere with the drama; the plotting is first rate and there's a real sense of good writing and dialogue here.  What's even more interesting is that all but one of the stories is set on earth - and even this, The Stones of Blood, hops off into hyperspace.  So, get this set and you'll be immersing yourself in the wonderful universe of Tom Baker's Doctor Who - and you can't get better than that!",1158883200,3,614,4.368421052631579
1716115,5,B000067FPE,"Fans of the 4th Doctor will appreciate watching all these episodes right after each other. New fans will get a great look at Tom Baker at his best in his most famous series of episodes. If you have never seen Dr. Who before Chris Eccleston, you should be warned that these episodes were made in the late 70's and are therefore lacking the fast moving computer generated special effects that modern viewers are used to. However, the characters and stories are most prominent in these older versions of the Doctor. Tom Baker is the best loved Doctor of most Americans, mostly because of his witty British humor. These episodes are from the time when scifi was less action/adventure and special effects but had an undercurrent of social commentary. Expect a more subtle humor than the typical American sitcom, plenty of campy special effects and silly looking aliens, and an underlying theme of sophisticated and philosophical exposition of human nature and society.",1155859200,5,963,4.987577639751553

1716144,5,B000067FPE,"I have seen all of the Dr Who episodes (well, at least 99.44%), except for the new series. ""The Key of Time"" is one of my favorite sets, because of Romana, the theme, and the unique touches by Douglas Adams. (I need to verify this, but I understand he wrote all of the episodes. I know he wrote at least one.)

""The Ribos Project"" has my all-time favorite bit characters - Binro the heretic. He is the ultimate scientist for his era: he thinks for himself, takes his lumps, and gets vindication. What more could you ask for? The scam at the core of the plot is wonderful .. the guy can think BIG. You want a killer - it has a great killer. Lots of great bits in the background. The Doctor survives by his wits - of course.

Other reviews detail the rest of the episodes - I will not do that here. ""The Pirate Planet"", though, has one of the best pirates, and a mechanical parrot to boot (one of the better inventions for the fasionable pirate).

Yes, some of the episodes are more the ""usual fair"", but the interesting thing is tying them together with the single thread, in all the variations, and the characters that show up. The English lady in ""Stones of Blood"" is very delightful, and you would *love* to have her over for tea.

The interplay of Romana and the Doctor is priceless. She has a lot to learn about the universe, but manages to get in  few good zingers on the Doctor. Romana, Lela, and Ace were the top three companions, IMNSHO, and we get to see her start out.",1119916800,,1478,4.2831541218638

In between the Doctor deals with criminals, thwarts parasitical space pirates, defeats an evil count and saves some swamp people from evil earthlings and a gienormous squid krakeny thing.  Same as usual really, and apart from the first two stories (The Ribos Operation and the Douglas Adams penned The Pirate Planet), without much chop.

1716147,3,B000067FPE,"When an actor such as Tom Baker stays with a show like Dr. Who for seven years, it's inevitable that the show will undergo a few changes and the biggest changes were the different producers. Phillip Hinchcliffe produced Bakers first three seasons, the best of the entire history of the show, in my opinion, which focused on the gothic horror elements of sci-fi and was top notch. John Nathan Turner produced Baker's last year, featuring a slightly more sedate and possibly more tired Doctor as he neared his regeneration into Peter Davison's version (also, Baker was in ill health for a stretch during the final season which accounted for his changed physical appearance). But Baker's 4th thru 6th seasons were helmed by Graham Williams, who had the unenviable task of veering away from the popular, scary and brilliant Hinchcliffe stories and had to go in a more slapstick, dumbed-down direction for the kids. Well, he succeeded. There are some nice elements in some of the different Key to time adventures and it was a bold move to do an entire season under the umbrella of one idea---the quest for the six segments to the key to time. I think I may have liked it even more if I hadn't been so used to the magnificent Hinchcliffe era shows. Williams era had a lot of silliness and of course, K9. It also featured some of the very lamest Who such as ""Horns of Nimon"". All in all, the Key to time is a good addition to the DVDs although I would have voted for many more early Hinchcliffe/Baker episodes to come ouot before these.",1086739200,15,1529,4.604395604395604

1716181,5,B000067FPE,"Watching the Key to Time series in one piece really fills in alot of blanks for those of us not fortunate to have seen enough Doctor Who episodes to get a sense of the whole.  Not that you'll get much of a history of the Time Lords or understand from this series alone why Doctor Who is on the adventure he is on, but it's still a great place to start, not to mention that this series contains two of my all-time favorite Who episodes, The Pirate Planet and The Androids of Tara.  The search for the Key is really just a convenient excuse to send the Doctor off on a series-long adventure.  Some of the episodes barely make mention of the Key, while others focus on it more intently.
This series comes from the Tom Baker years, and shows both the scarcastic wit and the caring that made these years so popular with viewers, especially in America, where Baker has been by far the favorite of the doctors.  These years also featured K-9, the robotic dog who has more personality than alot of the humans in the Doctor Who worlds and whose near demise in the final episode is surprisingly moving.  It also features the beautiful Mary Tamm as Romana, the youngish time lord who is foisted on Doctor Who against his will but becomes his treasured companion.  Tamm is fabulous, holding her own wonderfully against Baker and managing to convey intelligence, beauty, humor and compassion consistently.  Although you can read about each episode in more detail on the reviews for the individual episodes, here is my quick rundown of each:
The Ribos Operation: 3 stars, not the most interesting Who episode, not the worst either.  Introduces the White Guardian and Romana and sets up the search for the key, but is otherwise pretty run of the mill.  Nice hammy turns by the co-leads, one a tyrant out to buy a planet to use as a staging post for reconquering his world, the other a con man trying to hustle him on the sale of the planet, a backwards world with religious symbols that look awfully Catholic.
The Pirate Planet: 5 stars - very cheesy, very funny, very intelligent episode about one of the greatest crimes against humanity ever committed.  One of the best Who episodes, written by the late, great Douglas Adams of ""The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"" fame.
The Stones of Blood: 2 1/2 stars -- Worst episode of the bunch, a silly, slow-moving take on Stonehenge and goddess-worshipping cults.
The Androids of Tara: 5 stars - Fabulous episode that plays on ""The Prisoner of Zenda.""  The Doctor and Romana get caught on opposite sides in a battle for the throne of Tara.  Another one of those stories in which one of the leads (Romana) is a dead ringer for a principal on the other world (right down to the little scar in the middle of her forehead).  Overlook that small detail, though, and this one's a winner from the beautiful scenery and costumes to some of the best acting in a Who episode.
The Power of Kroll:  3 1/2 stars - not a great episode, but still entertaining.  Anthropology stars here as one race risks exterminating another out of corporate greed, only to be foiled by a giant squid.
The Armageggdon Factor: 4 stars -- the longest episode (at six mini-episodes instead of the usual 4), and the wrapping up of the Key saga, takes place on a planet on the brink of annihilation following a nuclear war.  Also introduces us to the princess whose shape Romana will assume when she undergoes her first transformation.
This series is both a must for serious collectors and a great intro for the first-time Who viewer.  It's not necessary to view these in order (for years I'd only seen two of them), but it's a nice treat if you can afford it.",1066003200,60,3655,4.564220183486238
1716182,5,B000067FPE,"What a great way to own the entire season in one complete boxed set! The audio commentaries are very informative and at times hilarious, wait for Tom's classic line 'Who's That???'. The prints are perfect and the episodes themselves are very entertaining. Tom Baker and John Leeson make a great team with their contibutions likewise Mary Tamm and the other key personnel. Actor Bruce Purchase has some interesting comments as well.
A must for Who and Baker fans alike.",1064966400,2,468,4.936708860759493
1716183,2,B000067FPE,"I just bought this set based upon fond memories of 20 years ago. Technically it is GREAT. Great color & sound. I love those cute young Brit women who are 50 now! Stories are good too. BUT I forgot how boring these stories can be. If the Doc is onscreen, the action & dialog is good. If he isn't there, forget it! It just drags on & on. Wish I were a Time Lord to leap to the next scene. A typical 99 minute segment could easily be cut down to 60 minutes or less with no loss in content.
I would not buy this again.",1055376000,2,514,3.858490566037736
1716184,5,B000067FPE,"Now at last I can see this wonderful collection, now I have hacked my DVD player!
And was it worth it- Yes. The key to Time collection is a complete season of Doctor Who Starring one of the best Doctors Tom Baker. This series was a first (and a last!) departure for the series in having the whole series as a inter linked story, each disc describing the good Doctors search for the key to time. Starring also the beautiful Mary Tamm as Romana and plenty of K9.
This is an essential addition to any collection and if you live in UK wel worth the trouble of hacking your player. The boxed set represents good value as it will save pounds (dollars) over buying them seperately. Extras are a little sparse on US versions compared with other who discs on region 2, with just talk overs and picture galleries, but still the restoration of the episodes as ever is very well done!",1055289600,10,872,4.388888888888889
1716185,4,B000067FPE,"Like I have said probably a million times on reviews of these shows(season 16,17,18)  I was brought up on this period of Dr. Who and it is what I think of when I think of ""Doctor Who"", some of you think of Patric Troughton and the hot tempored Jamie in 1967, or Jon Pertwee with cute'n brainless Katy Manning in 1972, I think of The wise and odd, curley haired floppy coated guy with the scarf, Romana(both of them), and K9 1978-81(though he started in 1974 I started watching the 16th season on PBS as a child)
The acting is excellent in these Key To Time stories, and it is important to have guest stars.  Pirate Planet is very underrated and actually very interesting to watch(not to mention funny).  Stones of Blood is kind of bland, but gets interesting on the ship in Hyperspace.  I have already got a recording of Androids of Tara that I recorded on PBS in 1988, I have watched it so many times that I'm sick of it(I can't give you an accurate reveiw on it.)  Ribos Operation is the best because of Paul Seed's excellent performance and a few others Like Iain Kulbertson as Garrion, and Benro the Heritic(I am too lazy to go find his name).  Power of Kroll is ok, not as bad as people keep saying, it at least is filmed on location and better than the overrated Sly McCoy or Colin Baker.  Armegeddon Factor is my second choice, for it's many different locations, humor, and The Shadow.  Lalla Ward makes her first appearence in Dr. Who.
What I don't like is the commentary.  I don't usually listen to commentary from DVD's except once.  I liked Bruce Purchase and Pennant Roberts in Pirate planet and found it interesting, but the others were merely Mary Tamm(stuck on herself like most actresses) and the every flakey Tom Baker, who I would hold a high opinion for except for that fatal flaw he has of his dislike of americans, I can't abide by those comments, Tom!  Others included John Woodvine(the Marshal) and Micheal Hays who could've been interesting if Mary Tamm would've stopped talking about how pretty she was compaired to Lalla and let the Director speak. The actors are good at acting, but nothing else.
These shows are good and you couldn't ask for more, but turn off the commentary(and those pop ups are only good once.)
I buy DVD's for the quality of the video/sound(which these have dispite some people's opinion), and more importantly becasue they last(unlike tapes)  everything else is fluff.",1052870400,2,2418,4.597674418604651

Looking forward to all the episoded to come out on dvd.",1043020800,3,306,3.903225806451613
1716187,4,B000067FPE,"The Key To Time season - a season of highs and lows.  Supposedly the Doctor's quest to find and recover all six segments of the powerful Key To Time, the hunt was really just an excuse for the Doctor to go on his usual adventures, albeit this time with a fellow Time Lord and a mission.  This season (and indeed the time that Graham Williams spent in the producer's chair) isn't exactly my favorite, yet I still find quite a lot here to appreciate.  The sense of fun and adventure never left the series, and both can be seen here in spades.
The season itself is not one of the greatest that Doctor Who ever did, but it is certainly worth anyone's time.  Doctor Who definitely exhibited a lot of variety during its 26 year run, and the stories showcased here display that diversity.  We go from a medieval-Russian styled story of swindlers and con-artists to a high-concept science-fiction story from the pen of Douglas ""Hitchhiker's Guide"" Adams to an Earth-based horror tale to a homage to THE PRISONER OF ZENDA to an old-fashioned monster story before wrapping everything up in a tale of galactic warfare.  And not only are all those stories part of the same TV series, but they're all part of the giant umbrella arc.  Quite impressive that a show could manage to combine all those dissimilar elements yet still retain a unique flavor of its own.
If you already own this set on VHS, then I can only state that purchasing this on DVD is definitely worth it.  Fans who have been following the Doctor Who DVD releases will already know that the discs have been vastly cleaned up in terms of clearer picture quality and crisper sound.  The Key To Time set is no exception.  The audio commentaries are also a great idea, and even the more uneventful are never less than entertaining (THE ARMAGEDDON FACTOR being the exception).  Actors Tom Baker, Mary Tamm, Bruce Purchase, John Leeson and John Woodvine and directors Pennant Roberts, Darrol Blake, and Michael Hayes all share their remembrances and experiences.  To be honest though, not all of the anecdotes have weathered the decades intact, and Tom Baker seems to only be dimly aware that he once played a character known as ""The Doctor"".  But again, entertainment counts for something, and listening to Baker tell various anecdotes about old ladies attacking him with shopping trolleys is very enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours.
While there are a few rough spots in this collection, this DVD set is really more than the sum of its parts.  It's easy for Doctor Who fans to take Tom Baker for granted after seeing his episodes rerun into infinity, but a release like this can really make one stop and take notice of how enjoyable Doctor Who can be.  Fans have probably watched many of these stories multiple times, yet I see this set as a reminder to sit myself down again and watch them as if it were the first time.  I noticed things here that I had never caught before, and I remembered a lot of characters and clever bits of dialog that I thought I had forgotten.  And if you've somehow never seen the adventures of Tom Baker, wacky Time Lord, then this DVD set is an excellent introduction to the fun, magic and variety that is Doctor Who.  Enjoy!",1041811200,11,3209,4.6
