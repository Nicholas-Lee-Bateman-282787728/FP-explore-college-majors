8080276,5,B000AXXBQ2, really don't understand why Discovery Channel has not been able to release those interesting and educational t.v. series in DVD FORMAT. It was a very hard work to create those amazing documentaries only to leave them into oblivion. Who has a VHS  player right now? It's a pity shame!!!!!!,1329436800,6,289,4.877551020408164
8080277,3,B000AXXBQ2,"The subject matter is as I expected & I don't regret the purchase.  However, I found the 'soft focus' a bit trying & was disappointed in the relatively small number of castles featured.  The delivery of the item was quite prompt, & the condition of the tapes very good.",1313539200,,269,4.469387755102041
8080278,5,B000AXXBQ2,"These are some of the best historical lessons that I've ever seen on television...I was mainly interested in the castles, but the series recreates historical scenes in a way that you really get a sense of what it was like to have lived back in the days of whatever castle they are profiling.  The music, camera work, narration and everything else is top notch...I was surprised that this wasn't available on DVD or that the Discovery Channel still doesn't play this series occasionally.  But they don't, so this is the only way to view them that I know of...enjoy...",1277596800,5,566,4.707070707070707
8080279,5,B000AXXBQ2,"I grew up within spitting distance of one of these castles, the Marksburg on the Rhine. The series is fascinating because it fills the places with life, something you don't get to see when you visit. But it's not over the top and sappy. Many local areas experience a medieval revival these days and markets and plays are held at many of these locations throughout the year. So if you plan a visit, check out the schedules online and you might catch more than just the ruins and vistas but a lively show that sets you back a few hundred years. Even if you can't go there yourself, this is the next best thing. I am surprised that this series was never offered on DVD. The commentary is very good, you have to pay attention and you can learn a lot. I just wished there were more castles included in this series.",1192406400,5,809,4.328947368421052
