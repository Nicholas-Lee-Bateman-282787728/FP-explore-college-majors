2998167,5,B000X35Q94,"My son is in LOVE with this show. He'll be 2 soon. He started watching this less than a month ago. He asks to watch it Every. Single. Day. All 3 videos are on Netflix.

FYI - - I hate this show. The music is so obnoxious- I'm not even that picky. Every adult I know that's seen this thinks the same. If you don't let your kids watch or play with certain things for the sake of your sanity, you're going to want to skip these. The songs stick in your head so you will be singing them in your sleep and the characters are nauseating. I didn't review based on adult appeal though.",1352419200,,577,4.017391304347826

2998169,4,B000X35Q94,"Our son calls this ""puppy bus.""  He's now 22 months old and is a big fan of these DVDs, though his interest has waned a bit.  Similar to the first movie (we have opted not to get the second one, thus far).  Highly recommend this as a way to keep your toddler busy for a half hour, but, as I said, he seems now to not be able to stay interested in this one as much, probably because he's seen it dozens of times.

PS: He loves the part toward the end with the little boy dressed as an elf playing the violin.  Makes him smile and go ""ha ha"" every time, which in turn does the same for us.",1278374400,2,587,3.8583333333333334

2998171,5,B000X35Q94,This is a movie for the littles.  It really is popular for about the second year of life and maybe the third.  The songs are cute and there are lots of puppets and movement to keep the interest of this age group.,1235088000,2,212,4.023809523809524

As soon as we saw it we bought this new one. We LOVE it!  Great messages about taking turns and getting along. My personal favorite is the song about ""procrastinating."" SO cute. My son loves the dogs in the dog parade and my daughter sings like the fairies. Another great episode.

8226837,5,B000X35Q94,"The Wheels on the Bus series is by far her favorite show. I think if I would let her, she would watch this show all day long. It is the only show that keeps her glued to the television. She loves ELMO too, but if she had a choice she would choose this show every time. I just wish they had made more episodes. She loves music and this show includes lots of songs and music. A great choice for young toddlers!",1393459200,,408,3.9878048780487805
