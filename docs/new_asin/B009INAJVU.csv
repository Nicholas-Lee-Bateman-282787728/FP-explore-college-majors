8541993,5,B009INAJVU,"I can only find 3 Monsuno dvds for North American and they are NOT continuous.
Monsuno Destiny-Season 1, episodes 1-5: Clash, Courage, Underground,Wicked,Knowledge
Monsuno Power-Season 1 episodes 6-10: Breakthrough,RSVP,Appleseeds,Eye,Deceit
third release are the first 5 episodes of SEASON TWO, go figure!
Monsuno Combat Chaos-Season 2, episodes 1-5: Flash, Bang,Mysterious,Antithesis,Kidnapped
each is 110 minutes, 5 episodes. The first and third I found for $1 each at Dollar Tree. The second, I came looking for on Amazon, but couldn't find out what episodes it included, due to the listing of Monsuno Power having two front views and NO back image. I requested amazon show a back image. They declined, which was annoying, so I went and bought Monsuno Power at another site.
Info was limited when I researched this series, but, near as I can find, Season one had 26 episodes and season two lists 18 episodes with 8 more TBD (to be developed)-don't know if they ever were.
Will post this on all three volumes , for people who are trying to figure out how they fit together.",1434758400,3,1076,5.084745762711864
