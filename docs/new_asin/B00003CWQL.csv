1262658,5,B00003CWQL,"I waited for years to see the director's cut of this magnificent movie. In the early 80's, after Visconti's heirs regained possession of the rights to it, they ordered it to be edited according to the master's wishes. I had  then the privilege of watching ""Il Gattopardo"" in a movie theater  in all its splendor, exactly as Visconti wanted it to be. Forget the ugly  and stupid English-dubbed version that was released before. The true  meaning of this movie can only be completely grasped when you see the  Italian-spoken version, in spite of a central character, the one played by  Burt Lancaster, having to be dubbed in Italian. I hope that when this is  released on DVD we get the real thing, with its full lenght and the  delightful cinematography by the great Giuseppe Rotunno. Please don't be  insensitive to those who love true cinema: give us the real ""Il  Gattopardo"" in its original widescreen format, its entire lenght and  the melodious sounds of the original Italian dialogue. And, last but not  least, the stunning beauty of the young Claudia Cardinale...",952300800,77,1070,4.850828729281768

1262702,5,B00003CWQL,"I first saw this film when it was first released in the US. That version (which is also offered here) purposely washed all the colors out (supposedly to resemble a faded color photo, a cute idea no doubt but unfortunate in this case). The later, Italian version (also available here) restores the original colors which are simply dazzling, particularly the blues of the sky and the oranges and reds. This is no accident; Visconti drafted some of the most talented production designers and art directors in Italy, and some of them are still around in the bonus feature to discuss how the film was made. I would regard the novel as the best I have ever read, and this film -- along with Citizen Kane -- the finest ever made.

Women will love the fact Alain Delon was peak of perfection when this film was made, his Gaelic charm and beauty rival the Sicilian country side, the same is ture of his co stars. I'm lucky to have one of the original release poster on my wall. This film does the Lampedusa novel justice, it should be noted that Lampedusa's nephew was an assistant on the set. The Nino Rota soundtrack is superb.

1262779,5,B00003CWQL,"This powerful historic epic will appeal to lovers of films like Gone With the Wind and Doctor Zhivago. Director Visconti was a member of the Italian Communist Party and his interpretation reflects Marxist dialectics, but his politics don't get in the way of the movie. Once you get past Burt Lancaster sporting a handlebar mustache and bushy eyebrows, he gives a sensitive and commanding performance as a proud Italian nobleman coping with a changing world while simultaneously experiencing a mid-life crisis. He realizes that the days of feudal privilege are over and swallows his pride, opening his house to the public and cultivating ties with the very bourgeoisie he once scorned. He encourages his opportunistic nephew (Alain Delon)'s marriage to the town's mayor's ambitious daughter (Claudia Cardinale), even though it breaks his daughter's heart since he knows they will make a formidable power couple. The films' style and ambition influenced such later classics as Once Upon a Time in the West and The Godfather.",1464048000,,1022,5.237804878048781

1262785,5,B00003CWQL,"I finally saw The Leopard Uncut 185 minutes Hd remastered version last night. It was good as other people said. But for me, I didn't cried or didn't touched to the core. But I had to admit that it was a masterpiece.
 The story was centered to the Prince of Salina and through out the film I felt how graceful and dedicated to his country he is.
 There are a lot of unforgettable moments in this movie.
 The scenes that I do remember right now is the ballroom scene. When Prince's nephew brought his fiance and the fiance asks the price to have the pleasure having a dance with him. The dance was a beautiful moment. Graceful, beauty it was. It is not a surprise that all the people there couldn't even clap their hands. They were just astonished by the prince.
 Right after the scene the prince goes out and he walks a little, then he bands his knees as if to pray to god, or as if him talking to the stars. Thas is a beautiful conversation. He was a graceful man. A true prince, a novel deed.
 The movie is 185 minutes of you are watching the uncut version. But it was never too heavy or too long.
 Each scenes are beautiful and nicely shot. There are not much camera movement or technique or anything but the mis-en-scene itself was just perfect itself. No one can touch at all.
 There are a lot of great movies out there but this movie is, I think, the only one that is fulfilled by one actor only. There are of course other actors involeved like the nephew and the nephew's fiance and others but it is the Prince and the Price only who was the true one that was the beauty in this film who shined like a diamond. So shined that made my eyes blind.
 I have to watch this film at least 10 times to really make it mine so I won't write much this time.
 But it is definately worth watching the unrated director's cut which is 185 minutes.
 Can you believe that Alain Delon and Claudia Cardinale (Once upon a time in the west) were all in this movie as a supporting roll?",1456012800,3,1970,4.201591511936339

1262881,4,B00003CWQL,"A mesmerizing, epic motion picture released in 1963. It brings to life the turmoil of the long process of Italian unification during the 1860s. (The unification effort was essentially a socialist revolution with ""red shirts"" led by Garibaldi. (Despite being an Italian hero, Garibaldi was considered by many of the French, the Catholic Church, and the upper classes of Europe to be a freebooter and a pillager, that based on his years of fighting in South America and before he returned to Italy.)  The battles for one Italy started in 1815 and continued to the 1880s, so ""The Leopard"" is but a snippet of this long, often violent political struggle. This Criterion Collection edition is unsurpassed. My only complaint is the that the shorter USA version, in dubbed English, does not have subtitles for hearing impaired viewers ( a rather reckless oversight). No matter, it's a feast for the eyes and ears (the Rota score captures the changing times and the underlying sadness of the power struggle). The book, which inspired Visconti's film, is often considered one of the best historical novels of the 20th century; I have a tattered paperback edition and have read it twice. Ah, and then there's actor Burt Lancaster; he is superb as the doomed Prince caught between two worlds. This film displays, perhaps, one of his best silver-screen performances.",1436572800,,1354,5.017777777777778

1262886,5,B00003CWQL,"This classic needs no recommendations. Director Visconti's lingering takes in every scene make this film very long for current audiences. That said, it's beautifully filmed and a moving, intimate story of a noble family caught up in the social change and Garibaldi's invasion of Sicily. It's too bad the film isn't more faithful to Lampedusa's book (in three plus hours there was time!) because the end of the story would have made more sense, but movies are rarely better than the dance sequence with Burt Lancaster and the young Claudia Cardinale near the end.

1262917,5,B00003CWQL,"Certainly one of the most lyrical and elegant films to depict Italy during the years of Garibaldi's revolution, ""The Leopard"" is not to be missed. I find it most appealing because it is not an action film in the American sense. There are no bloody battle scenes, no murders, no senseless violence. There is only one aristocratic family's story, a family with a patriarch who realises his time is almost over and that his kind will soon become extinct.
  Burt Lancaster plays his part so well that you accept him as the prince, the patriarch of an old Sicilian family whose history goes back in time. The other characters revolve around this one dynamic man, each one playing a part in the unfolding of Italy's destiny. The sets and costuming are excellent and you feel as if you are witnessing a real time period from afar.

films. What is really impressive, though, is Criterion's packaging. Because
the film exists in two different versions: one is the complete original
release, dubbed as always in Italian cinema by voice ghosts. The other is
the American release, which is the only way to hear Burt Lancaster himself,
though the other actors are, again, dubbed by others. Also, the American
release is cut.

Rather than choose between them, Criterion gives you both in this three-disc
box, along with very interesting background docs on the making of the film
and even on the historical background that informs the narrative, familiar
to Italians but not to Americans.

As for the film itself, it is long and cerebral, though it does have action scenes
and the famous forty-minute (or however long it is) ball sequence. I feel sorry
for that poor band of orchestra players, working nonstop from evening to dawn, because
there are still some couples waltzing away after the sun has come up.",1417564800,3,1045,4.931818181818182

1263122,5,B00003CWQL,"Il gattopardo (Luchino Visconti, 1963, 187')

Luchino Visconti (1906-1976), Italian aristocrat, Communist Party member, film  and opera (La Scala of ""La Callas"", and others) director and noted homosexual,  remains an extraordinary figure. Starting with some of the earliest neorealist productions after the war (Ossessione, 1943, La terrra trema, 1948), he scored a great success with his Rocco e suoi fratelli (an Italian South-North migration  drama, 1960) and the Italian Risorgimento  epos Il gattopardo (1963, where the main figures are Sicilian Prince Salinas (Burt Lancaster) and his revolutionary/liberal nephew Tancredi.

Il gattopardo is one of the most beautifully reflective, nostalgic films about therevolution, ie regimes and people changing, partly against the backdrop of the  hot plains around the family castle in Sicily, else in the Naples of the mid- 1800's. The film never hits kitsch or melodrama, and old Prince Salinas very well anticipates what is ahead, seeing it as a result of the immobility of his caste. Tancredi confirms the change by marrying the beautiful daughter of the (new, plebeian) mayor, played by Claudia Cardinale, co-promoting her to a full international star: CC, as she was known as in analogy to BB (Brigitte Bardot).

Two more anecdotal incidents relate to CC and the film. Visconti, for the first  time, let her dub her own voice in Italian (""Cinecitt is such a basar that voices  can not be recorded directly"" says Valentina Cortese in La nuit Amricaine) - a privilege he established for her, who so far was never allowed to dub her own voice because she had such a Tunesian (with which she had grown up) accent in her Italian. Which was the equivalent of the professional film staff saying she  may have a good body, but be else not be very much, especially intellectually.

They have a point: The interview with la Cardinale, which is among the extra  features, is directly recorded and a straightforward catastrophe. She giggles  hysterically and flirtatiously babbles incoherent devotions to Luchino, whom  she obviously adores, like an Elvis fan. Not so unjustified, after all, because he was actually her promoter (he got her to play as he wanted it), and wasn't the  film, after all, also about social mobility? A poor girl would remember that, and  that's what, quite inadvertedly happened. Luchino would certainly have put his foot down for it.

The film's mise-en-scene is quite simply ravishing: every social detail both in the foreground and background of each shot is carefully assembled and stunningly photographed. Visconti's camera never misses a chance to show how constricting this seemingly opulent world can be. Nino Rota's florid music complements the visual effects.

Every scene with Burt is solid GOLD! He is very concentrated and focused in his performance.

1263202,5,B00003CWQL,"First, on the quality of the blu-ray release, this is without a doubt the finest film transfer I have ever seen. When you first insert the disk what you see is breathtaking: images so sharp and clear that they seem like HD video shot just yesterday, assuming you have a high resolution monitor.  It is almost too sharp, in the sense that it can seem like a live video of a film being shot. Although a bit pricey, it is worth purchasing just for the transfer quality alone, to demo your equipment.

As for the film itself, be forewarned that not a lot happens. I would advise brushing up a bit on Italian 19th century history first, if not reading the novel. The plot, such as it is, has been summarized by others so I'll pass over that. In any case this a film you watch for atmosphere and details. The best films are generally those that remain faithful to their source material. This film, like Gone With the Wind, does not disappoint in that respect. It is largely faithful to Lampedusa's Il Gattopardo, except for two short chapters at the end of the book that deal with the death of the prince and the fate of his offspring, and a battle scene that did not appear in the book. Curiously it is a somewhat long film based upon a relatively short novel. At first you may giggle at the Italian coming from Burt Lancaster's character (and you should view the Italian version with subtitles, which is far superior to the dubbed American version), but you quickly get used to it due to his powerful performance. Despite being made by a  professed Marxist (although an aristocrat), this film is a relative rarity in portraying conservatives in a favorable light.

I've seen both versions.  This is one of those movies that are so delicious that the more footage the better.  But here's my problem:  The uncut Italian version is superior as a movie, but Burt Lancaster's voice is dubbed.  Now I know, having everyone else speaking Italian and him speaking subtitled English would have been ridiculous, but a big part of Lancaster's presence is his wonderful voice.  And Lancaster's character is The Leopard.  So I think the movie has lost something by losing Lancaster's voice.  Now, we can get Lancaster's voice in the included American version, but this is the cut, lesser version.

The movie was presumably cut to suit the American audience's squirm factor, and of course dubbing after the cut was cheaper than dubbing before the cut.  Would that it had been dubbed before the cut, with the foresight that one day the full-length version would find receptive Anglophone audiences.  And what a magnificent restoration it would be, with both the movie and Lancaster's voice in their full glory!  As it is, we must accept the trade-off.",1297987200,10,1233,4.893719806763285

Going into watching it for the first time i was preparing myself for a long and slow hog, but that never happend.  Despite the 3 hour running time you never feel that this is going on for too long.  I never looked at a clock to see how much longer the movie had to go.

The production was beautiful.  With Burt Lancaster in the film, the producers had Americal money.  You see where every cent went.  The costumes looked real, if a dress looked like it was made of leather, than it was.  Silk was silk and not some cheap imitation.  Being filmed in Italy, there was plenty of real life mensions to shoot in, no need to once again with cheap imitations.  This film looks beautiful because everything that was shot was beautiful. (sorry about the pretensiousness)

Italy is renouned for great directiors, but when it comes to actors, that's a different story.  However, for this film we are assured that the actors included are more than excellent, and so is their performances.  The only thing that lets it down is the dubbing.  Any fans of Italian cinema knows what a mean.  An example is Lancesters dubbing.  He speaks in English but his voiced is dubbed in Italian (I'm talking about he unedited version) so all the mouth flaps feels fake.  But after a while you get over it.

If you have an opportunity please check out the film.  If you decide to purchse the movie do not go past The Criterion Collection version, especially the Blu-ray, if you have the hardware.

Am I the type of person who prefers films like: ""Il Bidone"" (The Swindle) or ""Nights of Cabiria"" to ""La Dolce Vita""? So is my problem with ""The Leopard"" analogous to my problem with ""La Dolce Vita""? Do I prefer the eroticism of ""Senso"" to the plodding of ""The Leopard""? Although, this is funny because I enjoy reading long books, and enjoy other long films. Furthermore, to address some concrete issues. I felt Burt Lancaster looked too old at times. And I also had a problem with the ending. Prince Salina literally is becoming ill at the end? So he is not only the emblem of a dying era, he is dying himself? And Cowie's commentary does not help here. So get back to me. Share your thoughts. Thank You",1276560000,6,1364,4.481927710843373
1263279,5,B00003CWQL,"I was a bit nervous about watching this acclaimed ""arty"" film because, so often, such films end up being totally boring and you wonder what is going on in the minds of the critics.

Well, not to worry.  My husband - an action film lover - and I both were mesmerized by this.  It really is art - like a living painting.

The plot, as such, is more or less a meta-plot that exists outside the drama taking place onscreen, so don't be looking for any clearly defined good vs evil thing.  Just watch and breathe in the atmosphere.

In a way, it is kind of like being a fly on the wall in the house of a noble Italian family.  Their way of life, what they accepted as normal and what they thought was amusing, gauche and/or intolerable are curiosities.  One ordinarily thinks that such families lived as they pleased, but it becomes clear that they understood at some level a certain obligation to their subjects which they accepted as the price they paid for their position.  You see the family making a long, miserable, dusty journey, at the end of which they were expected to parade through the village, attend a long and boring church service still in their dusty travel clothes, after which they were expected to entertain the local notables.  So, despite their exhaustion, they perform their expected duties, even the children.

The Prince comes across as an extremely decent guy, and the Princess as an over-coddled, repressed and consequently, neurotic woman who, nonetheless, knows her duties and performs them without complaint.

You won't be sorry for adding this film to your library.",1275091200,4,1591,4.703971119133574
1263280,5,B00003CWQL,"The Leopard was thought the greatest novel of the century by William Golding. The part of Don Fabrizio ,the Prince of Salinas, was originally ear-marked for Olivier or even Brando by Visconti. The Fox studio only agreed to make it if Burt Lancaster was given the role. Reportedly, Visconti called him a 'gangster' and treated him harshly, but they were to become lifelong friends. Now nobody else could have done justice to the role. Lampedusa was recalling a world of lost content, his aristocratic childhood. The Palermo palace he lived in as a child had been destroyed by American bombing in the second world war and the family's country villa was reduced to rubble by an earthquake. Feelings of nostalgia produced the novel based on his great-grandfather's world,a world that is depicted aspassing with the rise of the movement of unification and democracy under Garibaldi, and the constitutional monarchy of Victor Emmanuelle in the 1860s. The Leopard of the title, is depicted on the prince's coat of arms but also refers to aristocrats living in their lost paradises as lions and leopards who in their passing are to be replaced by jackals and hyenas. Sicily is depicted as a land of perfection suffering successive waves of invasion, the invaders all being absorbed(Greeks,Spanish, Arabs and Normans).Don Fabrizio himself, is based on Lampedusa,who Lancaster captured in his portrayal.

The film starts magnificently with the storming of Palermo by Garibaldi's army. The injection of action vigorously displays the period of the Risorgimento with an epic sweep setting up the extravagant and grandiose style to come. We see the Prince(Lancaster),shaving, and looming up in his mirror, his nephew, Tancredi(Delon) saying he is going to join the rebellion with his uncle's blessing. We observe how Tancredi's allegiances shift like the wind, as he always wants to come out on top. His credo like his uncle's is: ""Things will have to change in order that they remain the same"". This becomes like a coat of arms prefiguring a survival plan. The middle section shows the trip to their hilltop estate in the village of Donnafugata. The family are seen being made welcome by the mayor, Don Calogero,one of the noveau-riche, and with the dust of their journey on them, they go straight into Mass. The scene where they are in their pews-cubicles, and the camera traverses the whole family's dusty faces,revealing them as the relics of an outworn system. Calogero, the nouveau-riche mayor,is a self-made entrepreneur of peasant stock. He comes to the Prince's residence awkwardly in top and tails, but he produces the jewel of his daughter, Angelica(Cardinale), who arrives in the main room like a vision of the future. Her and Tancredi immediately bond and are soon engaged through the manipulations of the Prince. Don Fabrizio knows he must sacrifice his own shy daughter,Conchetta, to engender the continuation of his lineage. Tancredi is an image of his youth,but without the loveless marriage he has known. Asked by an ambassador to become a senator,he puts forward the name of DonCalogero instead. He knows his time has passed. They need someone who can unite private wishes with vague public ideals.

In the last part of the film there is the magnificent ballroom sequence where we truly get the changing of the guard. The Prince is a pale shadow of his former self, shown to be a marginal figure. He rises to his former majesty one last time, in a waltz with Angelica, a concession of defeat. He then walks home alone instead of getting a carriage. What is noticeable in a film in which nothing much seems to happen is revised with further viewings knowing the historical background and political changes. Lancaster,is the fulcrum of power and dignity that controls and unites the film, suggesting physical presence and animal grace; also a sense of melancholy, mortality and resigned nobility with the passing of his feudal class. There is an opulent splendour in the sets and locations, an eye for painstaking detail. The cinematography is a vivid mixture of bright, dusty exteriors and chiaroscuro interiors, combined with Rota's lush music and Visconti's painterly compositions and theatrical framing. The film,preferably the Italian version with subtitles, is a masterclass in turning great novels into great films.",1272153600,4,4326,5.117397454031117

1263283,5,B00003CWQL,"One of the most beautifully shot films I think I may have ever seen; `Il Gattopardo' is a stunning cinematic achievement to say the least.

Some have made reference to `The Godfather' or `Gone with the Wind' but the comparisons, while understandable in parts, really shouldn't be drawn as an exact.  `Il Gattopardo' is much subtler film; a hushed film if you will.  It approaches a very weighty subject with such an intimate stance that you feel the calm of the surroundings as apposed to the rush of the situation.

Coppola's direction of `The Godfather', while flawless, has layers of panic that make the film much tenser and much more visually and mentally stimulating.  Luchino Visconti takes a different approach here, allowing for a more personal flow.  We are given the film moment for moment, which delivers a much different feeling to the viewer.  Instead of pondering the films actions in entirety we take it step for step and thus are drawn in close to the films protagonist.  Both directorial efforts are stunning, but both are also very different.  In fact, the only true comparison comes from the cinematic scope (these are both epics of a more close-compact nature).

`Il Gattopardo', adapted from Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa's novel, takes place in 1860's Sicily.  The main focal point of the film is the Prince of Salina, Don Fabrizio, as he tries to hold himself together, preserve his family and class and hold fast his integrity as Italy works toward a unified self.  Times are changing and this weighs heavy on the Prince as he watches what he has built for himself begin to wane in the sight of a new generation and a new way of life.

The film is propelled by a stunning performance given by Burt Lancaster; a true genius here.  He captures the very subtle and very intimate emotions of this man and demonstrates them with power and commanding strength.  It is impossible to take your eyes off of him.  There is a moment towards the films end (although not end of the film since the films end sequence is like half the movie) where Lancaster is staring at himself in a mirror, reflecting on his on conflict, and I just felt this knot in my stomach the whole time.

Flawless.

He's aided by a large and impressive supporting cast; most notable is the stunning Claudia Cardinale who just steals every scene she is with her smoldering and passionate performance.  Without a word she can evoke utter jealousy.  I just love it.

Like I mentioned on the outset; this is truly one of the most gorgeously shot films in the history of cinema.  It does at moments appear too long; albeit never boring (you don't have to be boring to feel a little over-stretched).  It is a complete package; and while I won't say that it is better than the films it has been likened to (there are very few films that can top `The Godfather'; sorry) I will say that it is genuinely crafted and expertly executed and delivers top notch on its own right.  No need to compare; for this is a different film all together.  Just sit back and enjoy.",1235692800,5,3038,4.633644859813084
1263284,5,B00003CWQL,"While FF Coppola undoubtedly learned a thing or two about telling a dynastic story with a historical backdrop from The Leopard, and while Fox undoubtedly marketed the film as an Italian Gone With the Wind (and confused and alienated the US audience in the process), this film has nothing else to do with those oft-thrown around comparisons, and may have much to do with why some reviewers come away bored.

The Leopard, despite its sumptuous period design and glamorously cast triumvurate of Burt Lancaster, Alain Delon, and Claudia Cardinale, is better compared to Chekhov or the mid-to-late '30's films of Jean Renoir (under whom director Luchino Visconti apprenticed in that era), a gentle, contemplative, anti-dramatic and uncoercive specimen of story-telling that unfolds slowly as a means of conveying not merely the fates of its characters, but an unusually nuanced piece of historical analysis, quite alien to narrative cinema.

The film is set against the backdrop of the liberation of Italy from centuries of Austrian rule and its unification into a nation from a handful of feudal states.  Set in Sicily, the most remote, impoverished, and backward of those states, the protagonist is Prince Fabrizio Salina, master of a vast estate and the end-point of an ancient lineage; Salina is an aristocrat, but as an amateur astronomer, and as embodied by Lancaster with his characteristic mix of physicality and intelligence, he is a man of vision as well. When Garibaldi's revolutionary army lands practically in his backyard, the Prince gives his dashing, beloved, Byronic nephew-and-prospective-son-in-law Tancredi (Delon) his blessings to join them, when Tancredi explains that if there is to be a new order, the family may as well be on the winning side. What follows is basically The Prince's somewhat passive witnessing of his nephew's startling series of transformations from rebel war hero to glittering officer in the new army of Italian monarchy, in comic opera uniform, to member of the new nation's senate; the further Tancredi moves from his donning of the revolutionary red shirt of the Garibaldians and up the ladder of power, the more the energies of a people's revolution have been betrayed -- the new Italian constitutional monarchy is there to make sure an orderly transition occurs to preserve the perogatives of those who have always ruled.  If the shifting sands of labyrinthine Italian politics sound arcane and confusing to you, really all you need to know is Pete Townshend's summary of most revolutions: ""Meet the new boss/Same as the old boss.""

If this sounds dry and academic, it is not; because there is another thematic strand which over-arches and overwhelms the political story. The Prince further decides that to preserve his lineage, which he observes is threatened by decadence through in-breeding anyway, he will permit Tancredi to break off his engagement with his daughter and marry instead the daughter of a rising member of the new Italian bourgeoisie, a further survival tactic for the preservation of the old order; luckily, said daughter-in-law is the heart-stoppingly beautiful Claudia Cardinale (and watch her interviews in the special features -- without evident cosmetic enhancement, in her 60's she's still pretty staggering). The last half of the movie involves the Prince engineering this marriage; a three-fold circumstance, subtly conveyed by the film, arises: the ageing prince and the young woman strike immediate sparks; he, a vital, physical man, would likely have taken her to bed not long ago. There is a powerful sense of desire smothered not by propriety but by a sense that the time for this has passed, which bleeds into the epic ballroom scene that takes up 1/3 of the film, wherein the woman is introduced into society and her class invades the Prince's house. As the ball continues, the Prince visibly diminishes, a historical process is occurring where his machinations have rendered him obsolete, as he foresees not just his own ageing and death but the end of an ancient way of life.

The third thematic strand is the most powerful: Visconti's unbelievably sumptuous evocation of the vanished world of the House of Salina is marked by elegy and nostalgia. This nostalgia is deeply personal, because Visconti was telling his own story and the story of his family, albeit he was a Northerner. Visconti was quite likely the only titled noblemen, scion of ancient Lombard dukes, ever to be a movie director; born in 1906, and heir to a vast fortune (these weren't typical bankrupt Euro nobles), Visconti remembered from childhood the pre-World War One luxe of an Imperial Europe; his father had similarly married beneath him into an industrialists family to maintain the cash flow.  Lancaster said later that all he needed to do to prepare for what he felt was his finest performance was watch how the Viscount behaved on set and imitate him.  But Visconti was not merely the sympathetic member of a dead order; he was also a fervent communist.  His double-vision allows the film thus to be a Marxist analysis of a failed revolution and an elegy for a vanished and luxurious way of life.

Visconti accomplishes this through what I referred to earlier as his Chekovian story telling; the camera observes from a middle distance, (with gentle movement and a minimum of cutting) the social rituals of the Prince and his family; during these meals, masses, picnics, balls, history invades through the backdoor of conversation, changes in costume, new previously univited houseguests in attendance. With the exception of a single epic recreation of the Battle of Palermo, the tone is low-key, observational, lyrical.

The film thus nicely summarizes the famous quote of French diplomat and professional survivor (of the Revolution, the Terror, Napoleon, and the Restoration) Talleyrand, who said ""Only those who lived before the revolution knew how sweet life could be."" (shortly after the Leopard was made, this apercu became the title and epigraph of the young Visconti disciple Bernardo Bertolucci's second film, Prima della Revoluzione.)

This is a nuanced, analytic film, bolstered by the star power of its leads, but gentle and quiet for all of its formal elaboration.  Visconti, with his fascination for historical recreation, operatic hysteria (he was one of the foremost opera directors of the era, collaborating frequently with Callas), and fascination with decadence and deviant sexuality, would never again make a film with such balance and poise. His aspiration was always to create both ""a novelistic cinema,"" with the richness of detail of 19th century fiction, and ""an anthropomorphic cinema,"" which situates its protagonists in history by means of meticulous observation of externals.  While he had hitherto pursued the latter goal via neorealism, documentary-style observation of the contemporary working poor (see his earlier La Terra Trema), oddly enough he succeeded best with this monomaniacally detailed recreation of an Imperial past.",1235347200,16,7022,5.219165927240462

But the director presented the charm and manners of a bygone era so masterfully...

Nor will I indulge in a bout of political or philosophic pontification which does little justice to the viewer's independent judgement or the film itself.  In response to some of the fiery commentaries posted earlier, I'd only say - Visconti was far too subtle a film-maker to wear his politics on his sleeve, and the film was a complex work of art and not a piece of ideological agit-prop.  No fiery rhetoric to stir one's heart, no panning shots of peasant misery to rouse one's indignation here.  In fact, I was impressed - given the director's self-professed Communist associations - how true the film stayed to the novel's decaying (some would say decadent) aristocratic vision.

The Criterion edition of the DVD comes with English audio commentary by film critic Peter Cowie.  Cowie's commentary provides an interesting comparison between the film and the novel on which it is based, and at the same time is chockful of subtle period historical and social details which the viewer might have otherwise missed.

1263330,5,B00003CWQL,"The Leopard, the novel, portrays a pensive Don Fabrizio reflecting on his position in a changing world. The film, on the other hand, portrays the changing world in which Don Fabrizio is thinking. This is not wrong. A film overwhelms the senses and excites where a book naturally leads to thought and examination. The medium is the message, as Marshall McLuan said, and a different medium often delivers a different message.

So, is the novel better than the film? No! This film is the best kind of adaptation, one that interprets the book, complements and stands alongside it. Burt Lancaster as Don Fabrizio is an inspired choice, as is Alain Delon as Tancredi. Claudia Cardinale is lovely, but she fails to command Angelica's fullness; she's not nearly as seductive as she is in, for instance, Once Upon A Time In The West. But Angelica shines, radiates, glows! next to Don Fabrizio's wife and daughters, so the actress does her job, and well.

The Leopard has been called Italy's Gone With The Wind and it is indeed contemporaneous with Margaret Mitchell's story. But they shouldn't be compared. Don Fabrizio is no Rhett Butler nor is Angelica a Scarlett O'Hara; conversely though, Georgia and Tara are no match for Sicily and Palermo. The antebellum American South looked enviously on Europe while Europe never cared much for the colonies; the New World was nouveau-riche while the Old World's new revolutionaries cared for, but respected, Europe's inherited treasures.

All in all, a marvelous movie.

The Leopard may have bankrupted its producers and helped bring about a crisis for Italian cinema (sadly not dealt with in the generally impressive documentary on Criterion's three-disc NTSC DVD), but it's the kind of magnificent commercial failure that has managed to long outlive many a contemporary success. The lavish and hugely expensive adaptation of Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa's revered novel was never going to be an easy sell: an epic drama about the gradual decline of the aristocracy set against the mid-19th Century unification of Italy that was supposed to bring prosperity and progress to Sicily but only made things worse - all that is really happening is that the middle class will quietly take the place of the aristocracy - was never going to be an easy sell in Peoria. The politics of the Risorgimento can even confuse Italian and Sicilian audiences, and it has to be said that the film plays better if you've done a little homework on the period beforehand and can appreciate the constantly shifting political landscape (the Criterion DVD handily provides a brief historical primer). It should also be emphasised that this is a very Sicilian drama rather than an Italian one, with a bleak Sicilian outlook on events. As Burt Lancaster's Prince Salina explains, ""Sleep... eternal sleep, that is what Sicilians want. And they will always resent anyone who tries to awaken them, even to bring them the most wonderful of gifts. And, between ourselves, I doubt very strongly whether this new Kingdom has very many gifts for us in its luggage. All Sicilian expression, even the most violent, is really a wish for death. Our sensuality, a wish for oblivion. Our knifings and shootings, a hankering after extinction. Our laziness, our spiced and drugged sherbets, a desire for voluptuous immobility, that is... for death again.""

Yet rather than a purely political essay, the film assumes a more universal resonance through Burt Lancaster's increasingly weary Prince, a man in danger of outliving his time and facing the mortality of himself and all that his life has stood for, trying to manage events to secure some kind of legacy of continuity and stem the tide of social progress, reasoning that ""If we want things to stay as they are, everything must change."" The vehicle for his hopes and aspirations is not one of his own children but his nephew. Alain Delon's Tancredi at first appears as a (literal) mirror image of the Prince, but he's a more ruthless political animal than even he is aware of, able to adapt his passions to the changing political circumstances and rewrite his past until he has become the polar opposite of everything he once professed to stand for. While it is the Prince who consciously manipulates events, he remains a strangely sympathetic, even tragic figure: for him, it's to late to change. Instead, it's the charismatic Tancredi who becomes increasingly unlikeable as he throws away his early enthusiasm and promise in favor of the easier path of conformity. The film becomes an elegiac tragedy not just for a time and a class but for human nature itself: change for the better is impossible because these people will not let themselves change.

One of the very best discs Criterion ever produced, the transfer does full justice to Giuseppe Rotunno's cinematography, Mario Garbuglia's sumptuous production design and Nino Rota's magnificent score, far exceeding any of the European releases of the film, but it does lose points for not including any of the deleted scenes from the 205-minute version that originally opened before Visconti cut it to his preferred 185-minute version presented here. It's especially frustrating since the stills gallery includes a few images from deleted scenes without any explanation of where they originally fitted in the narrative, while there are brief glimpses of some in the Italian theatrical trailer also included. It seems an especially curious oversight since the set does include the shorter US version of The Leopard, which, notwithstanding its poor reputation, is far from negligible. Despite losing a further 24 minutes, it surprisingly isn't a bowdlerization and it's good to hear Burt Lancaster using his own voice, taking a softer voiced, more underplayed approach than the actor who dubbed him in the Italian version (something Sydney Pollack, who supervised the US dubbing, feels was a misjudgment on Lancaster's part). In many ways, the tightening of the film seems to actually make it more focussed on the turbulent politics that would fail Sicily but protect the immediate interests of the old order. The Italian version is still superior, of course, but it's not at all bad.

As well as boasting not only the best transfer I've ever seen of the film (especially compared to the Italian DVD) but possibly the best DVD transfer of any film I've seen to date, Criterion's 3-disc edition boasts an excellent extras package. Only the interview with producer Goffredo Lombardo is carried over from the Italian disc, with pride of place going to an excellent 61-minute documentary on the making of the film, a useful 13-minute primer on the historical background of the film, two Italian newsreels - including an incredibly bitchy and gossipy one from the Italian Nastri Awards - the original Italian trailer and the woefully misjudged US trailers selling it as another Longest Day or Cleopatra!",1194912000,12,5599,5.036677454153183
1263333,5,B00003CWQL,"If this edition of ""The Leopard"" has done nothing else, it certainly has displaced Kubrick from the top spot of my personal list of best directors  and put Visconti in his place instead. Why is that? Well, I had seen the movie previously, but in a version with strangely oversaturated, incredibly ugly colors (and that version is included here as an extra on one of the three discs, perhaps to serve as a bad example -- so if you have a masochistic bent...). I still felt, based on the writing and acting, that this was a very good movie, but visually it was not exactly a treat on TV.

Enter Criterion, and while they always do a good job with transfers, this time they have truly outdone themselves! The film looks simply amazing, with subtle lighting, a nice golden ""glow"" in the interior scenes in the palace and very naturalistic colors in the outdoor scenes. Watching this transfer is a bit like marveling at one of the first DVDs about a decade ago and wondering how you could ever have tolerated the bad picture quality of VHS. The difference is really that striking. And yes, the story is interesting, the acting is very good, but even if that were not the case this film would be mandatory viewing simply for how it looks.

Where Kubrick comes into play is of course when one compares this film to his very similar offering,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barry-Lyndon/dp/B000UJ48SQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barry Lyndon</a>, which I previously regarded as the most-striking looking period piece. Soft lighting, glowing fabrics, careful composition, these things are present in both films. But what makes ""The Leopard"" better is its unerring sense of good taste -- where Kubrick shows off his zoom lens, overdone lighting in night scenes, or Ryan O'Neal's complete lack of acting talent, Visconti is all subtlety and elegance and there is nothing here which seems overdone. Well, maybe except Lancaster's makeup, but then again he is supposed to look lion-like. (And the Italian-dubbed voice definitely helps a lot for making his look seem fitting -- it projects far more authority than his real voice ever could.)

One of the gripes I have with IMdB is that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Godfather-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B0001NBNB6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Godfather (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;is rated so highly, when it is little more than an inferior, morally questionable knockoff of this movie. Hopefully more people will watch the real thing and realize that ""The Godfather"" is polyester next to ""The Leopard""'s pure silk. And of course Bertolucci's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1900-Special-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000IHYXGM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1900 (Special Collector's Edition)</a>, again with Lancaster in a relatively similar role, seems to be heavily influenced by this film. So the number of copycats for this work is quite significant.

Now the only question is why, until now, there have always been such great transfers of Kubrick's films and such excessively bad ones of films by Visconti. If Visconti's other films received a similarly careful treatment as this one, I am sure the balance between him and Kubrick would be tilted even more in his favor.

Burt Lancaster brilliantly portrays the no longer young 19th Century nobleman who is something of a benevolent dictator to those within his cultural milieu.  Yes, he is open to change---but is primarily motivated by self-preservation.  The Prince of Salina seriously doubts if anything good will come out of it. Lower class Sicilians presumably enjoy their destitution and believe it is the will of God.  The Catholic Church is to do its part to preserve the status quo and offer them their reward in the hereafter.  At most, the priests might entice the royal families of Italy to throw the poor a few scraps off their tables.

1263336,5,B00003CWQL,"""The Leopard"" is the story of the fall of the Bourbon Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, based upon the novel by Giuseppe di Lampedusa. In 1963 the haunting and subtle masterpiece premiered as a film, starring Burt Lancaster. Directed by Milanese aristocrat (and Communist) Luchino Visconti, it is perhaps, in the opinion of some film critics, one of the most skillfully crafted and films of all time. Lancaster regarded it as his finest performance, although initially he drew back from the role of Prince Fabrizio, feeling himself to be too American. Lancaster, however, emanates a calm and collected nobility as well as animal magnetism; no one else could have played so well the Sicilian prince who was known as ""the leopard.""

I watched ""The Leopard"" frequently while I was writing the novel ""Madame Royale,"" about the decline of another branch of Bourbons. While no Bourbons make an appearance in the film, the passing of the old order is epitomized by the Lancaster character, Prince Fabrizio, who must make compromises in order to save his family. While Fabrizio and his once powerful clan incarnate the decadence, frivolity and inbreeding of the old aristocracy, they also exemplify the courtesy, noblesse-oblige and Catholic culture which were about to fade into oblivion. From the opening scene when the prince and his family are saying the rosary to the final shot of Fabrizio kneeling in the street as the Blessed Sacrament is carried to a dying man, the film shows how faith was woven into all aspects of life. There is a sense of the presence of God, to whom Fabrizio, and everyone else, must render an account. Death seems to haunt the dusty corners of the great palace, even while a new era is being born.

The plot revolves around the betrothal of Fabrizio's nephew Tancredi (Alain Delon) to the beautiful and wealthy daughter of the mayor, Angelica. Angelica (Claudia Cardinale) is a young girl who in former times would never have been considered eligible to marry into a princely house, but in the trying times of the Italian unification her money and political connections confer eligibility upon her. Her forward and slightly vulgar manner are softened by her earthy charm; Tancredi is completely in love with her. He has forgotten his cousin, Fabrizio's daughter, who had hoped to marry him; the scorned maiden's heartbreak permeates the movie.

Fabrizio is smitten with Angelica as well, although he gives no indication of any attachment except when he waltzes with her at the ball. Roger Ebert describes the dance thus:

""Finally the prince dances with Angelica. Watch them as they dance, each aware of the other in a way simultaneously sexual and political. Watch how they hold their heads. How they look without seeing. How they are seen, and know they are seen. And sense that, for the prince, his dance is an acknowledgment of mortality. He could have had this woman, would have known what to do with her, would have made her his wife and the mother of his children and heard her cries of passion, if not for the accident of 25 years or so that slipped in between them. But he knows that, and she knows that. And yet of course if they were the same age, he would not have married her, because he is Prince Don Fabrizio and she is the mayor's daughter. That Visconti is able to convey all of that in a ballroom scene is miraculous and emotionally devastating, and it is what his movie is about.""",1188259200,6,3418,4.797962648556876

At 3 hours in length it will certainly test your patience. The cinematography is magnificent with wonderful depth to many shots with both foreground and background in sharp focus. Replete with a lush musical score by Nino Rota this is indeed an Italian ""Gone with the Wind"".

Prince Fabricio Salina (Burt Lancaster, magnificent in this performance which almost did not happen) is the great man full of energy and power who knows that his world of noble aristocrats is doomed to disappear in new Italy united as republic. He is a Leopard of the title, and these are his words, ""The leopards and lions are being replaced by jackals and hyenas ... and they all think they're the salt of the earth."" Lancaster is one of reasons I loved the film so much.

The film also features two of my favorite actors, young Alain Delon who played Salina's favorite nephew, Tancredi, and heavenly beautiful Claudia Cardinale as Angelica, Tancredi's beloved.

Each moment and each frame of the film are breathtaking, and the final act, an hour-long ballroom extravaganza, ranks among the grandest cinematic set pieces of all time.",1177027200,2,1052,4.706521739130435
1263399,4,B00003CWQL,"Il Gattopardo (Luchini Visconti, 1963)

Luchino Visconti's three-hour epic of the fall of the Italian aristocracy still rings as powerfully today as it did in the sixties. Burt Lancaster stars as Prince Salina, aging patriarch of a clan of the rich and powerful. His nephew, Tancredi (Alain Delon), is attempting to turn his back on his heritage and embrace the new power-to-the-people mindset sweeping the nation. His position is complicated when Prince Salina attempts to subvert Tancredi's romance with Concetta (Lucilla Morlcchi) by arranging a marriage to Angelica (Claudia Cardinale), an eligible daughter from a rival family.

It pretty much goes without saying that an epic of this scope is going to be beautifully shot, and this one is. Visconti's large and talented stable of actors perform, almost to a one, to the finest of their ability; Demon, especially, was never better than he was here; the brash, bold Tancredi, at odds with both his upbringing and his own nature, constantly testing the limits of both in order to prove-- or, perhaps, only to understand-- himself, seems the role Delon was born to play. Lancaster also shines here. The Prince is old and set in his ways, and the change in his character as the film progresses is utterly illusory. Lancaster chose to play the role in elegantly cynical manner, representing this supposed change of heart to the other characters in the film, but always winking behind his hand at the audience. (After all, when does he soften? After he gets what he wants.)

What's truly amazing about the film is its mastery of pace. In a world where certain studios are well-known for their reluctance to put out movies that stretch longer than ninety minutes, one might expect a movie of this length wouldn't hold the interest of the average moviegoer. Twentieth Century Fox, its American distributor, did in fact think just that; as with a depressing number of truly excellent foreign films in the sixties and seventies, it was released in America only after extensive cuts had been made. While the effect of these cuts was not as devastating as it was with, for example, Profondo Rosso or The Wicker Man, you have to see the full movie to get the full effect. (The Criterion Collection 2DVD set thoughtfully includes both cuts so you can judge the effect for yourself.) The fact of the matter is that Visconti's original three-hour cut (three hours and five minutes, to be exact) is a masterpiece of pacing. It does tend to come off as episodic at times because of the length of certain scenes (the movie's sole weakness), but each of those scenes is paced such that it's thoroughly absorbing. You might wonder how a dinner party with people sitting around and talking can be riveting. (You've never seen My Dinner with Andre if you do, I'm guessing.) It is, easily as much as the cast-of-thousands battle scene.

If you've never seen Il Gattopardo-- and you probably haven't, especially in its original cut, which wasn't available on DVD in America until a few years ago-- you should, if you're at all a film buff. It's a perennial entry on hundred-best lists for very good reason. **** ",1173744000,3,3143,4.867289719626168

Claudia Cardinale, who must have been all of 21 years old, was breathtaking.  The slow, deliberate pace of the film was not a flaw; indeed, it was an asset.  It permitted me to grasp the flow of life of the place and time.

Classic movie and it nails the Sicilian psyche perfectly - the one line says it all about Sicilians: ""Their misery is exceeded only by their vanity!""  I'm Sicilian and I can vouch for that.  The other line which is right on is: ""They don't feel a need to change because they think they are perfect.""  Wow!  Watch it people, over and over.

1263403,5,B00003CWQL,"""The Leopard"" (1963), based on the novel of the same name written by Giuseppe Tomasi Di Lampedusa, is the best film I have seen this year. Directed by Luchino Visconti, this splendid Italian movie takes the spectator straight into late 19th century Italy, a time of social and political change, something ""The Leopard"" shows clearly and in a masterful way.

One of the main characters is Prince Don Fabrizio of Salina (Burt Lancaster), who realizes that he must do something, if he wants the House of Salina to remain powerful in a new world that is going to be dominated by the middle class, not the aristocracy. The answer comes to him in the form of his nephew Tancredi (Alain Delon), an ally of the new forces that says that ""If we want things to stay as they are, things will have to change"".

Prince Salina is bitter regarding the need for compromise (""We were the leopards, the lions, those who take our place will be jackals and sheep, and the whole lot of us - leopards, lions, jackals and sheep - will continue to think ourselves the salt of the earth""), but he recognizes the wisdom of the path Tancredi suggests, and supports him. What is more, Prince Salina also gives his blessing to Tancredi's decision to marry Angelica (Claudia Cardinali), an extremely beautiful and well-connected woman from the middle class. Of course, that doesn't sit well with Concetta (Lucilla Morlacchi), Tancredi's counsin, who has fallen thoroughly in love with him.

I would like to point out that there is a lot more to ""The Leopard"" than the plot I just outlined, for example the beautiful Sicilian scenery, the wonderful music, and the political connotations of several scenes. From my point of view, this is the kind of film you can enjoy, but also learn from. On the whole, highly recommended!

1263404,4,B00003CWQL,"I have enjoyed reading the reviews of The Leopard: Let us now bow our heads and praise Luchino...  I first saw The Leopard in a big movie theater, in Paris in 1971, in Italian with French subtitles.  My French, she is not so good, and my Italian, well, it is nonexistent!  But I got the point!  As the many reviewers of The Leopard point out, the film is beautiful, sweeping and grand, (a masterpiece!) the story of a nobleman faced with challenges brought on by changing times.  And with every new problem, the old cat deftly avoids catastrophe and steers his family into the future.  ... and the film is soooo boring!!!  Its beautiful, but the story goes nowhere.

 Some review writers of The Damned were shocked, some seemed to be amused, and others were disgusted.  In my opinion, all these views reflect the writer's circumstances as much, if not more, than the merits or flaws of the actual film.

The Damned is simply the flip side of The Leopard.  Same basic situation, but this time the old man is killed off right at the start, and the family then slides into degradation, perversion, etc. etc. until the most immoral member is left in charge, offering his mother poison as a wedding present.  Nice?  No. But not at all boring.

Perhaps I overstate the case, and maybe conflict and plot are less important in Visconti's films than character, music, sets, dialogue and costumes.  I'll let others argue those points.  What I do suggest is that neither The Damned or The Leopard should be praised or condemned too much without seeing, comparing and contrasting both of these remarkable films with each other.  Only then can Luchino Visconti's films be evaluated as expressions of a cinematic genius and/or a regional chauvinist.",1153008000,4,1735,4.745819397993311
1263405,5,B00003CWQL,"""The Leopard"" is not only one of the most accomplished films of the twentieth century, but one of the most successful adaptations of a novel to the screen. Rarely has a scenarist so effectively translated the essence of a novel without compromising the source material.

This is not to say that anyone should approach the film before the Lambedusa novel. Indeed, this film might well be considered as a companion to the book--the two being almost interdependent.

Still, the depth, richness, and complexity that Mr. Visconti achieves here justifies a lengthy treatise in and of itself. Equally important is a familiarity with the social background of the story, a piece of history destined to be lost on not a few Americans. Nonetheless, the viewer is encouraged to familiarize himself with the life, writings and allocutions of Pope Pius IX, (particularly his ""Syllabus of Errors""), the campaigns of Garibaldi and Mazzini, and the criminal theft of the temporal dominion of the Papacy, effected by a variety of Socialist and Masonic cabals.

But back to Mr. Visconti's film: enough good things cannot be said of it. Often, great visual films are compared to paintings and certainly the comparison is most apt here. Each frame seems to breathe a life of its own.

One is simply staggered by the beauty of the compositions--each scenic tableaux not only intelligently employs the width of the Cinemascope screen to artistic advantage, but even manages, (as in the case, again, of a great painting) to visually probe the novel's subtext.

The casting could not be improved upon. If on paper, Burt Lancaster, seems an odd choice, (what with his Curriculum Vitae brimming with gangsters, cowboys, athletes, and acrobats) he, nonetheless fully realizes both Lambedusa and Visconti's vision, creating a man with the intelligence to see not only his own life ebbing away, but recognizing that the order he embodies, and represents is also simultaneously collapsing.

In short, Mr. Lancaster's character personifies nothing short of a tragic loss--the collapse of the noble/aristocratic and chivalric European world order, and, with it, the complex value system, and interdependent mode of decorous deportment that the value system supported, (welcome to the Welfare State, ""progressivist"" social engineering, and the enshrinement of the declasse.)

Though her character is tainted with arriviste origins, Claudia Cardinalle enchants in her interpretation of Angelica. Note the way Mr. Visconti stages her entrance in one of the film's most memorable sequences. As the family gathers in the salon prior to a small dinner party, an anticipatory rustle signals Angelica's arrival. Framed over and through an oil lamp and spray of daisies, and underscored by a recapitulation of Nino Rota's main theme, she glides through the salon, a vision in cream taffeta, elaborate chignon, and a rose at her bosom, plainly enrapturing and even intimidating the entire party. The pitch and sincerity of her voice and diction as she greets the Prince is a marvel of growing self possession.

Miss Cardinale's beauty is of a rare order, and Alain Delon is nearly her match, with a gallantry and swagger that perfectly encapsulate Tancredi. Supporting roles from the Jesuit to Angelica's father are flawless both in type and execution.

The ball sequence defies comment. It is truly one of those things, for which the phrase, ""must be seen to be believed"" may be applied. The viewer can almost touch the watered silk swagged drapes, feel the swish of embroidered gowns, taste the flavored ices and blanc manges, and smell the liquored air, a waft with the heady mixture of verbena and attar of roses.

When, at the scene's near close, we behold an depleted elderly woman in green silk fanning herself in the far right side of the frame whilst some brave young things continue their exhausted dance, we seem to be viewing a Tissot come to life.

And Nino Rota must be complimented on his majestic score, the main theme of which is of heart breaking beauty and tenderness.

Ironically, ""The Leopard"" will scarcely find populist appeal in a country for whom MacDonalds, Wallmart, and Oprah appear to provide all that is needed or wished for. No, this film is not intended to be accessible to every Tom, Dick or Harry. This would surprise neither Prince Lambedusa or Mr. Visconti.

But for those who know better--savor it! ""The Leopard"" seeps into one's pores like a drug, after which it demands to be seen again and again.",1151107200,14,4493,5.080054274084125

1263458,5,B00003CWQL,"I've known and loved the Prince of Lampedusa's novel of Sicily during the Risorgimento since it appeared in English translation in 1960. I was dubious when I heard that Luchino Visconti was making a film, staring the American actor, Burt Lancaster, as the ageing aristocrat of the title, and I gave it a pass when was released to the theatres. It wasn't until the late 1970s that I caught up with the film, on television, in the truncated form of the original North American release, and I was bowled over. To have it now, in a lovingly presented DVD, in the full original version is a rare treat.

What's so impressive about the film? In a word, everything, starting with the cast. Visconti, who insisted on Lancaster's participation, knew what he was doing.  After you've seen the film it is impossible to conceive of anyone else playing the  Prince, a man wedded to the near-feudal world in which he grew up, trying to come to terms honourably with the bourgeois reality of the newly united Italy of the 1860s. He's a real actor, not just a movie star. Alain Delon, as the Prince's young nephew out for the main chance, and Claudia Cardinale as the beautiful daughter of one of the ""new men"" in the Prince's village whom the nephew marries, probably never did better work (and Cardinale, like the film itself, is gorgeous!) There's a wonderful supporting cast as well.

Visually, this must be one of the most beautiful movies ever made, a series of set-pieces of family gatherings, battles and balls. It moves at the novel's pace, which is to say, slowly. It's a long film, and one to be savoured. Those whose standards for historical drama come from the Merchant-Ivory films should see how a master does it. Merchant and Ivory, eat your hearts out!

What emerges is visually gorgeous: the Sicilian countryside and interiors; the epic battle scenes of the Risorgimento; the opulent ballroom sequence that fills the last hour of the film. It is not Burt Lancaster's voice in the Italian-language version, but he is definitely speaking Italian, judging by his lip movements, and this is one of his most brilliant roles. His sensitivity, his regal bearing, his world-weariness and sense of outliving his time is very real even through another language (and another voice). Makes me wonder how he might have played Don Vito Corleone, given the gravitas he brings to this role. Questo e magnifico qui.

And a lot of Lampedusa's nuances have gotten into the film: we see in the Prince's bleak marriage what the young lovers will go through after their wedding night is over and the long years pass. We also have a suggestion that some things have not changed: the bourgeoisie has replaced the Leopard's nobility, but will occupy the same gorgeous, empty rooms and go through the same motions and little will change in the end. The Leopard's passing will be a relief for him.

In Criterion's defense, it may be that their 2.21:1 image was extracted from an original Technirama frame having an aspect ratio of 2.35:1 (the European standard), rather than the expected and more common 2.25:1 frame (the standard used by Technirama in the U.S.).  This may explain why there's a rather noticeable amount of picture info missing from the frame of Criterion's 2.21:1 transfer when comparing it to other editions of the film transferred at 2.35:1.

While Technirama's American films were photographed at an aspect ratio of 2.25:1, their European productions were more often shot at a ratio of 2.35:1. (Don't ask me why, it's a long story.) When it came to striking Super Technirama 70 prints (at 2.21:1) of these Euro productions, it was, therefore, necessary to crop a fairly wide and rather noticeable amount of visual info from both ends of the original (2.35:1) frame.

Of course, care in framing and camera movement was taken by the cinematographer when shooting to insure that no essential action was staged at the far ends of either side of the frame. [The variable framing component was an important feature of the Technirama process, allowing cinema prints to be made in various gauges and aspect ratios.]

Ultimately, there's never anything especially ""important"" or ""essential"" missing from Criterion's crop, though, let's face it, a 2.35:1 presentation might have been preferable to some people wondering why the picture on their dvd was ""cut off"". And besides, for many viewers, when it comes to a Visconti film, especially one as visually rich and detailed as ""The Leopard"", any missing picture info (no matter how ""inessential"") can be disappointing and rather regrettable.

As for a claim that there appears to be a greater amount of picture missing from the left, as opposed to the right, side of Criterion's frame, from what I understand the older Italian dvd (mastered at 2.35:1) was not centered properly and Criterion's transfer has wisely corrected that mistake.  (The only anomaly in Criterion's framing may be some slight, barely noticeable panning and scanning to compensate for the usual TV set overscan, a common practice in dvd mastering.)

In any case, the Criterion disc, framing and all, has been approved by the film's esteemed cinematographer Giuseppe Rotunno, and Criterion (while remaining essentially mum on the whole situation) claims to be completely happy with their transfer.  Now, that's not a 100% guarantee of perfection, of course, but it's probably as close as we're ever going to get.",1122422400,11,2794,5.191111111111111
1263465,5,B00003CWQL,"When making films, director Luchino Visconti was most interested in the visual; dialogue and characterization were really secondary. The Leopard is probably his visual masterpiece, and one of the most beautiful movies ever made.

But for me, a lover of the novel by Giuseppe de Lampedusa upon which the film was based, it is ultimately unsatisfying. The Fabrizio of the movie is not nearly as complex a character as the Fabrizio of the novel. The humor of the novel is barely even present in the film. There IS, however, an over-long battle scene - not part of the novel - from Garibaldi's Revolution, which is really unnecessary to the story.

Despite what the notes in the dvd version of the movie say, Lampedusa was not a reactionary pining the loss of his posh upper-class lifestyle, and Visconti's film is not a radicalization of his story by a ""liberal"" member of that same Italian aristocracy. The politics in Lampedusa's novel are much more complicated, and leftist, than those of Visconti's film.",1112227200,9,1005,4.905882352941177
1263466,5,B00003CWQL,"It's a cliche, but it happens to be true: They just don't make movies like this anymore, and it's our loss entirely.  Thank goodness The Leopard is available on DVD, and in such a beautiful version.  From the very first frame, I knew I was in the presence of an Artist who understands human beings and all their emotions.  For three hours director Visconti, his peerless cinematographer Giuseppe Rotunno, and the cast, led by the astonishing Burt Lancaster and the painfully gorgeous Claudia Cardinale, cast a spell that you don't want to be lifted.  I think I would have to experience this film at least three more times to truly appreciate it, so it is well worth the financial investment to own this three-disc feast.  The extras are strong, with a fine documentary on the making of the movie and the U.S. version, edited and dubbed, of course.  I enjoyed hearing about the relationship between Lancaster and Visconti; at first, the director opposed Lancaster's casting, but they became great friends and Lancaster even patterned his performance after Visconti.  Once Visconti found out what a powerful presence his star was, there was no turning back.  I can't think of an actor today, with the exception of Peter O'Toole or Paul Newman, who commands the screen like Lancaster and others of his breed.  Once upon a time, movies were magic, and if you believe in magic this is where to find it.",1110844800,19,1397,4.7875
1263467,2,B00003CWQL,"I really, REALLY wanted to like Luchino Visconti's THE LEOPARD. No less a film authority than Pauline Kael wrote a glowing review of it in 1983, when it was released in Visconti's original Italian-language cut. ""Magnificent"" was one of the adjectives she used, and nearly everyone who has written a review for this Criterion DVD release has agreed.

I really wish I could agree, too. Believe me, I love foreign films as much as any film enthusiast out there. But I'll just come right out and say it: I found this movie BORING. I don't often say that about a lot of movies (not even about LOST IN TRANSLATION, which I hear a LOT of other people are calling boring, an assessment with which I passionately disagree), but there is no other adjective to describe my reaction to this film. Its 185 minutes move at a torpid pace, nothing of any great consequence happens (historically, of course, revolutionary changes were occurring in Italy, but Visconti can hardly be bothered to show much of it onscreen). But, most damagingly, none of the characters---not even the main character, Prince Don Fabrizio (Burt Lancaster)---are all that interesting, nor do they do or feel anything all that interesting either. By the time Don Fabrizio is kneeling down and looking at a star in the film's last moments, I wasn't moved (as beautiful as the imagery undoubtedly was); I was just glad that the picture was finally approaching its end.

Maybe I just missed those little subtleties that would have helped draw me into the characters and situations of this film. Or maybe this is the kind of movie that plays infinitely better on a big screen than on my much-smaller TV set. Perhaps one of these days, in the future, I will watch this movie again and appreciate it a lot more. For now, though, I am willing to give THE LEOPARD two stars for its visual beauty (Giuseppe Rotunno's cinematography, with bright colors that truly pop out at you, is often breathtaking) and beautifully lush score (by Nino Rota). Otherwise, THE LEOPARD just didn't dazzle me like I was hoping it would. It did worse; it bored me like almost no other movie I've yet seen (the lone exceptions being, maybe, one or two really bad slasher movies).

So here's my advice: unless you are a huge film buff and simply can't wait to see what the hype is about regarding this film, I would suggest either waiting for it to pop up on a big screen somewhere or just skipping it altogether. Personally, I'm glad I was finally able to see it, but I won't be singing high praises for it anytime soon.",1103328000,33,2549,4.647450110864745
1263507,3,B00003CWQL,"Hmmm...Criterion has done a wonderful job bringing both the original Italian theatrical release and the original cut U.S. release together, along with numerous bonus features, on three discs.

  Unfortunately, it doesn't take a genius to realize that the longer, original, Italian version is cropped on the left side of the film.  It should be 2.35:1 like the U.S. version is, but it is closer to 2.20:1.  Apparently the left side of the Italian version has been cropped, resulting in a small loss of content on the left side of the film.  No one is really sure why Criterion did this, but they did, and it's unfortunate to say the least, especially for such an expensive DVD.

  Fans waiting for this FIRST U.S. home release of The Leopard on any format, won't mind too much I guess.

  Criterion has been pretty good when it comes to 'double dipping.'  After re-releasing Lang's ""M"" I know more than a few Criterion customers were upset( both releases say original aspect ratio, one is 1.33:1 the newer is 1.19:1, hmm...), and now this cropped version of The Leopard.

1263508,4,B00003CWQL,"During a time of social upheaval in 19th century Sicily, aristocratic patriarch Don Fabrizio (Burt Lancaster) contemplates the impending changes in the social order.  A proud and honorable man, he is, as he says, ""utterly without illusions""; he knows that men such as himself, who are accustomed to being the center of their universe, have no place in the world that is to come.  Director Luchino Visconti presents the Don's dilemma in a very subtle, intimate, closely observed film.

Perhaps too subtle for me.  This is clearly a film of great mastery with a magnificent performance by Lancaster at its center.  Although his voice is dubbed by an Italian-speaking actor, he uses his eyes, face, and posture to communicate tremendous dignity and melancholy.  I simply found the film to be too slow and, early on, I was confused about the nature of the political crisis.  I blame myself for being inattentive, perhaps not in the right frame of mind for this film.  I find myself still thinking about Don Fabrizio several days after viewing the film.  I need to see it again someday.",1101513600,10,1081,4.863387978142076
1263509,5,B00003CWQL,"The Leopard is one of the most sublime films ever made and it is to Criterion's credit that they have given it a treatment that it deserves.

The film is in many ways a happy accident. The surprising choice of Burt Lancaster for the role of the Prince seems to be perfect now, yet he was chosen after Laurence Olivier by director Visconti. It was very much an international production designed to appeal to audiences across the world hence it also stars Alain Delon from France.

In either version - the extended or the edited ones are both in this set - the film is a swirl of brilliant performances and directorial finesse. To my mind, the extended version does not add a great deal to the overall impact of the film, but it interesting to see it.

The only lapse in the translation from Lampedusa's novel, is that you cannot grasp the internal monologues of the Prince as he ruminates on death and the changing situation of the times. Occasionally, Visconti allows the Prince to state these thoughts, but he never delivers the full weight of them. This probably says more about the limits of cinema as an artform. On the other hand, the book does not convey the beauty of the palaces or the visual splendor of Sicily.

In some scenes such as the arrival of Claudia Cardinale, the battle of Palermo, and the final ball, Visconti seems to reach a different level in film making. While some find Visconti slow, I find the detail of each scene so interesting that I actually want more time.

The disc set also has an outstanding commentary by film historian Peter Cowie who completes an excellent presentation of the film. The attached documentary is of minor interest.

1263513,5,B00003CWQL,"Several years ago I read this book and then discovered that it was made into a movie in 1963.  I searched for the video or DVD and was not able to find it at that time.  Therefore, I was really delighted when I found out that the film had recently been released on DVD.

This is the story of the decline of aristocratic power in the late 19th century in Italy, and the effects of this on one particular family.  The film was made in Italy and stars Burt Lancaster as the Prince of Salina and Claudia Cardinale as young lady from the emerging middle class who wins the heart of the prince's nephew.  The film is a full 185 minutes long.  But it held my interest throughout and I was even sorry there wasn't more because I remember the book covered a larger span of time.

There certainly is pageantry here.  We see the palatial estates in all their glory.  We get an understanding of the family dynamics as well as the influence of the Church. There are wars and glory and disappointment in love.  There is pomp and pageantry and a glimpse into the privileged life of the privileged few.  Mostly, the wars take place off screen but we do feel their impact.  We see the first elections and the competition for power.  And, most of all, we watch Burt Lancaster, in a role that calls for a wide variety of subtle emotions, as he watches his structured world fall apart and is forced to make compromises.

I learned a lot about the history of Italy as the film transported me to Italy for a very personal glimpse of an era I knew little about.  And, it spite of it being made more than 40 years ago, the cinematography is excellent, even by today's standards.  Definitely recommended.",1095465600,50,1679,4.385113268608414
1263514,3,B00003CWQL,"For so long, The Leopard has only been available here in its cut, American dubbed version. Now, Critierion has released the full length Italian version, with Burt Lancaster's voice nicely dubbed into Italian. The result is a drama that's deeply perceptive and, often, moving.

Like much of Luchino Visconti's work, this relies on character -- so film fans who enjoy high-concept, plot-driven vehicles might not find this completely to their lliking. For everybody else, Burt Lancaster delivers his greatest role as a wealthy landowner who supports, then rejects revolution as it sweeps over Sicily. Alain Delon plays his protoge, a handsome, low-born firebrand who comes to be like a son.

The Leopard is unusually effective in its handling of theme. As one generation succeeds another, it's a metaphor for the social change that would soon overtake the island. And the final sequence, set in a ball, is classic cinema -- as Lancaster roams through the corridors of his life, only to see how the change of generations ignites his melancholy.

True, this nearly three-hour work may have a couple stretches that tax the attention, but I think Visconti deliberately aims for a pace that complements his material. This is a 19th century world with horse-drawn carriages, where conversation was a prime amusement. Enjoy the film on its own terms -- and certainly do so more than once.",1095292800,25,1379,5.066079295154185

1263558,5,B00003CWQL,"The legendary 205 minute version of Luchino Visconti's ""The Leopard"", which won the Palme d'Or at the 1963 Cannes Film Festival, probably doesn't exist any longer.  Shortly after it premiered, this epic movie was (like other roadshows of the day) trimmed by about 20 minutes.  This was due in large part to the strong opposition the film received from Italy's powerful Roman Catholic Church. (Among other things, the Church perceived ""The Leopard"" to be anti-clerical and objected to the way it had been portrayed in the film, as well as in the 1958 novel on which the film was based.)

Chief among the cuts made to the original version of ""The Leopard"" was a scene removed from the ""Battle of Palermo"" sequence.  At the very end of this section, just after Alain Delon is wounded in battle, there had been a scene inside a Catholic convent.  It depicted the convent's nuns willingly aiding Garibaldi's soldiers, and tending to the injured, including Delon. (In the recut version, soldiers are seen banging on the convent door, a nun opens the door, and the men rush inside, nothing more.  Guess the church didn't mind the soldiers going into the convent, but they sure didn't like whatever may have gone on in there.)

Reportedly, the church was also displeased with the hypocritical nature of Burt Lancaster's character, especially his adulterous activities.  At one point, there had been an encounter between Lancaster and a prostitute in the confines of the lady's bedroom.  Eventually, that rather racy scene ended up on the cutting room floor.  And it wouldn't be a surprise if that was due to the church's disapproval of the lady and what went on in that bedroom. (In the edited version, the Prince arrives at the prostitute's door and she lets him in, but that's it. I guess visiting a prostitute was okay, but actually getting into bed with her was another thing. Sort of like that convent scene. But then again, maybe not.)  In the end, it's more than likely that a few other swell scenes (possibly another bedroom encounter for that randy Prince) met an early end thanks to the hyper-critical (lack of) taste of some supremely snippy church censors.

Well, producer Goffredo Lombardo, already worried about making his money back on Signor Visconti's overblown production, certainly didn't need the church ordering Catholic filmgoers to stay away from any theater showing it.  So, it's been said, he decided to cooperate with those pesky censors and made those (now regrettable) requested cuts.  Lombardo may have gone and made a few cuts of his own, too, simply to bring down the film's rather unwieldy, often complained about, length. (""Variety"" whined, ""... at nearly 3 and 1/2 hours, the film is way overlong. Several sequences fail to trenchantly move forward the story."")  In the end, trimming 20 minutes probably allowed a lot of theater owners to add an extra showing of the picture.  And anything that could help out at the box office was okay with Signor Lombardo.

Now, the reason I say that the missing 20 minutes of ""The Leopard"" will probably never be found is simply because it was so often the practice of the time to make these type of cuts to a film's original negative, and eventually just toss the deleted footage away. (Back in 1963, filmmakers weren't into preserving each and every excised scene the way they are now.  Nobody was even thinking about videos, much less DVDs.)  Besides if the missing footage had survived, I would think it would have been found by now, wouldn't you?  Especially after Criterion's painstaking DVD restoration (not painstaking enough, as they've chopped off a good portion of the lefthand side of the image in an apparent effort to create a faux Super Technirama aspect ratio).  Add in the fact that Titanus, the studio that made ""The Leopard"", went bankrupt soon after releasing the film.  And that the rights to the movie were transferred to 20th Century Fox in Hollywood.  And you end up wondering just where that excised footage would be now anyway.

But still you never know.  Maybe, just maybe, someday someone will find those long lost 20 minutes.  Perhaps in an old original print from the film's opening run, a print that has long survived, as the Leopard yearned to, the ravages of time and decay.  But until then, we won't have it so bad.  We've finally got ""The Leopard"", at 185 grand and glorious minutes, (plus the 163 minute English-language version), on DVD at long last.  Plus we've got a few nice stills of some of those deleted scenes on Criterion's supplemental section DVD.  You really can't help but figure that this Leopard, as old as he may be, ain't too shabby. Just the way he is.",1092873600,43,4669,4.821831869510665
1263559,5,B00003CWQL,"The Leopard is an expertly crafted recreation of Sicilian history in the early 1860s.  Giuseppe Garibaldi's red shirts take over the island in the first hour or so of the film.  All the action in the movie takes place early in this story.  The rest of the film dramatizes the impact of this turning point in Italian history on the Leopard, Prince Fabrizio.

Prince Fabrizio compares himself to a leopard and the simile is apt.  Burt Lancaster plays the Prince as a single-minded and powerful predator.  He is the law and everyone treats him with respect and even awe.  Prince Fabrizio sees clearly that his time and that of all the nobles in Sicily is coming to an end.  He has a large family, much land, and huge palaces.  he wants to maintain his wealth and privilege and will do what needs to be done to remain in power.  Prince Fabrizio is a contradiction in terms.  He is The Leopard, ruthless with everyone and a friend to no one.  Yet this Leopard regularly goes to confession and has a code of honor that prevents him from taking part in a new government that will require him to be more like Machiavelli's manipulative Prince, something completely against the Leopard's nature.  Lancaster is perfect in this role.  His physical presence, his stern demeanor, and his powerful movements show us a man who watches carefully the scene around him.  He understands that he will lose in the end to forces over which he has no control.

The Leopard has an enormous cast of characters.  This is particularly true as we move to the last hour of the film, a fancy dress ball that may be the most sumptuous extravaganza ever put on film.  All the key characters in the film and a cast of hundreds, perhaps thousands, put on period finery and dance through rooms of a spactacular palace.  The colors, music, and sets are all done on a grand scale and deserve to be seen on the largest screen possible.

Prince Fabrizio moves through the ball interacting with all the principle players and becomes increasingly robbed of his life force.  The Leopard finds it difficult to play-act at a fancy dress ball.  Lancaster is perfect in this final long scene.  We watch him noticeably deteriorate and become smaller and weaker.  At last he is alone on the street outside the palace with most of his life force spent.

The version I describe is the full length film Visconti wanted audiences to see and it has been beautifully restored by the Criterion Collection.  Viewers looking for action must look elsewhere.  The Leopard is the story of a society slowly coming apart as Italy struggles to become a united nation.  As this review suggest, Visconti's art allows us to experience this end of an era.

1263561,5,B00003CWQL,"Criterion has brought us back the splendor of Visconti's LEOPARD.  Burt Lancaster is super macho and courtly, a great actor at the top of his game.  Claudia Cardinale is nearly as beautiful here as she is playing Jill McBain in ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST.  Alain Delon has a big part, not showing much acting ability, but still showing why he became one of the big international stars of the early 1960s.  In his big eyes and expressive mouth we see youth and impetuous passion reflected back at us as though in a hall of mirrors, precisely the effect required for the part.  Visconti could use Delon as no other director.  Funny also to see Terence Hill from all the spaghetti westerns show up as a Siclian nobleman, Delon's best friend!

If you look closely at the big ball scene, you might spot the Colombian actor Lou Castel as one of the guests.  Visconti discovered him and cast him in this, his first European movie; it was his habit to discover these insanely beautiful young men and give them a ""break.""  Of course Castel later went on to take the title role in Liliana Cavani's FRANCIS of ASSISI and to star in many other movies in a career that continues right up into the present day.

None of the locations or characters have a ""lived in"" sense about them, the actors are like exquisite porcelain dolls arranged artfully in the mise-en-scene, delivering dialogue, looking ravishing for the crane/ dolly, tracking shot (when not being rendered insignificant by the cluttered ostentation of the production design). As for the proverbial ""meat"" of the story, it simply isn't there: about as interesting, as uselful and relevant as a high-school history lesson. Maybe historical epics just aren't my thing.

1263563,5,B00003CWQL,"The Leopard is perhaps the most beautiful films in Italian Cinema and one of the best from this country of great filmmakers. Directed by the master of period films Luchino Visconti it is sweeping, grand and magnificent in the telling of the story of the unification of Italy from the point of view of Sicilian Prince Don Fabrizio Salina. It encompasses the fall of the old ways of the aristocracy of a divided Italy and the rise of a new country with a healthy vibrant middleclass that would change Italy forever.
  The film is dominated by the best work captured on film of the great American actor, Burt Lancaster. He inhabits the role of the Italian Prince Salina with the dignity, power and grace of a true prince of cinema. It is reported in the extras on this Criterion DVD that he based his character on that of the equally aristocratic Visconti. Shrewd man that Lancaster was, for he presents us with two portraits, that of Visconti vision of the prince and that of his own interpretation embodiment of the director. Throughout the film there is in Lancaster a touch of the wounded or fallen hero. As the film progresses he fades in power and seems the verge of some terrible loss. His world is dying and he is on the edge of death itself. He seems, and is in fact in the end very near death though we are not shown anything more than a mere indication of his doom. In his final moments on screen he is heartbreaking.
  There are so many other wonderful performances in the film. Rina Morelli is proud, haughty, silly and touching as the wife of the Prince. Terrance Hill is wonderful in his small role of Count Cavriaghi, friend and wartime companion to the prince's nephew Tancredi Falconeri. Alain Delon creates in Tancredi a magnificent spoiled and ultimately self-destructive young man who at first embraces the changes in the new Italy even to the point of wooing a woman from the middle class who a few years earlier would never have even been considered suitable. He gives in this film one of his best performances.
  And among the most luscious women of the Italian cinema of the 1960's is Claudia Cardinale. A star of so many memorable films in both Italy and the U.S. she is here so stunningly beautiful and perfect as the fiance of Tancredi that she seems almost unreal. Her Angelica Sedara is both ethereal and earthy. The scene where she reacts at a formal dinner to a ribald story told by Delon is perfection. Her presence at the ball at the end of the film is truly memorable.
  The sets, costumes and locals of the film are resplendent in scope and detail from the magnificent villa of the prince with it's real silk walls to the ballroom at the end of the film set in the center of a palatial villa of unequaled splendor. The film is so magnificent that it is almost impossible to take it all in at one time. It bears repeated viewings and on the largest screen possible.
  This Criterion presentation is magnificent and loaded with wonderful extras that shed light on the making of and restoration of this masterpiece. The DVD is full of insights, included are interview with the screenwriters, set and costume designers, and the producer as well as the charming Miss Cardinale. You are also given the chance of viewing the Italian version or the re-cut (by a young Sydney Pollack) American version.
  Visconti was an incredibly gifted and fascinating filmmaker who should not be overlooked by any true lover of cinema. The Leopard is his masterwork.",1090800000,15,3477,4.626623376623376
1263564,5,B00003CWQL,"""The Leopard"" by Luchino Visconti is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. I can't say enough what a brilliant film this is. There are few in the entire history of cinema to match it.

 The recent DVD release by the Criterion Collection is every bit a worthy masterpiece as the original film. There are fewer DVDs more complete and more plush. The image quality is outstanding and the sound is a beautiful 5.1 clarity. The restoration of frame-by-frame picture-quality is gorgeous and flawless. This DVD looks like a movie made last year, not from 1963.

 You get the original Italian language version of the movie on one disk and the shortened English language version on a seperate disk and a third disk of extras and interviews and trailers. Three full DVD disks containing just about everything you'd ever want to know about this rich and brilliant film; it can't be beat!

 The film is wide, spacious, epic, grandiose, and geuinely historical to a 'T'. If you're looking for a film to take you away to another world to another time, then the Leopard is for you. This is quite the next best thing to actually inventing a time machine and traveling back in time to film.

 I loved, loved, loved this DVD and this wonderful, wonderful movie! I have not one complaint and nothing but praise for what is undoubtedly one of the most treasured DVDs in my growing collection.",1090281600,25,1376,4.6570247933884295
1263565,5,B00003CWQL,"This is a film about the end of an age -- the age of the aristocrat.  It also happens to be a film made by a member of the aristocracy.  Luchino Visconti, the director, comes from a long line of Italian aristocrats. Visconti's films are all in one way or another about men who are incompatible with the age in which they live. In The Leopard Lancaster plays a refined Prince who has outlived his time.  In his prime the Prince was the very model of health and vitality and he was the uncontested authority to all who lived in his province but now he is starting to show his age and his own decline coincides with the decline of his class and an entire way of life.  Being such a refined figure the Prince records his decline in minute detail -- he seems to age right before our very eyes.  It is obvious to the filmgoer that Visconti has no real love for democracy nor the way of life that comes with it. Elections are seen as crass popularity contests and the parvenus who seek office are seen as dim and uncultivated and lacking in that fineness of spirit that was the defining trait of the aristocracy.  It is the Princes misfortune to live to see all that he values vanishing minute by minute before his very eyes and that is what happens in the famous hour-long ballroom scene.  The new class rising to power has no time to cultivate that fineness of spirit and range of interest required to understand men and their needs and so govern them well.  Instead the class now rising to power is largely self-serving and small-minded. Though they call themselves democrats they are preoccupied with material gain and status and the kind of civilization they are making is no longer capable of producing a man like the Prince.  However Visconti himself is proof that the aristocratic spirit lives  on even though the aristocracy does not.
It is more than a bit likely that this portrait of an ideal aristocat is just that, an ideal.  I've heard this film described as Proustian. That is true only in so much as the film is obsessed with the passage of time. Proust, unlike Visconti, is interested in a multi-faceted psychological expose of the leisurely class.  Proust loves his aristocrats but he shows them for the vain creatures that they are. Proust may have had something of the romantic in him but that was balanced by a keen social awareness (ie Dreyfus affair)  that is nowhere to be found in Visconti's single-minded meditation on one man's point of view.  Proust can speak of highly subjective states of mind and points of view but each point of view is balanced by other points of view. This pluralism and balance is simply not to be found in the Leopard nor in any of Visconti's other works.  The Leopard is Visconti's best film but it is a myopic world view we are getting - we feel trapped in the Princes(and by extension the aristocratic) point of view.  This is at times a strength and at times a weakness of the film.",1088208000,21,2932,4.493408662900189
1263566,5,B00003CWQL,"Leopard is a grandiose epic film based on the Sicilian aristocrat Giuseppe Tomasi Di Lampedusa's novel that he wrote in respect to his grandfather.  The director Luchino Visconti, who was born as count, knew what kind of character was needed for the main part as Prince Don Fabrizio Salina as the film displays strong aristocratic conduct and value.  Burt Lancaster was chosen to perform as the Prince of Salina, which initially was met with much reluctance.  However, the initial resistance to cast Lancaster was swept away as he performed with convincing brilliance, which together with Visconti's direction left cinema history with a masterpiece.
The story circulates Don Fabrizio, a dominant aristocrat with a mere presence that demands respect, as it depicts an emerging new nation and a past where inherited power was slowly slipping away.  Don Fabrizio recognizes the ruling class's ignorance for the current political changes as the nation is unified under the new flag.  The aristocrats continue their silly games and diversions in their immense mansions that are slowly falling apart as an emerging middle class is seeking wealth and power.  This leads Don Fabrizio to form a bond between the nobility and the common by permitting a wedding between Tancredi Falconeri (Alain Delon) and Angelica (Claudia Cardinale), whose father, Don Calogero, is a middle class politician that is raising in the ranks.  This leads to a subtly political loaded film as it depicts the scheming middle class's quest for power and wealth as the nobility might only keep their fancy names if they are not following the new changes within the nation.
Leopard is a marvelous film with colossal shots of the Sicilian scenery that evokes a sense of freedom for the people while underlying currents bring notions of ownership.  The story deals with ownership in a most delicate manner as it deals with love, marriage, friendships, war, and social events.  However, Leopard also reminds the audience about the imminent change of possession as love can change, which is brought to the audience's attention when Don Fabrizio goes to see his lover amidst a bloody revolution.  In addition, the tale of Don Fabrizio displays the manner in which one must control or protect ownership.  This is brilliantly depicted in the opening scene where the Salina family is having a private mass in their home that is continued under the strong influence of Don Fabrizio as an emerging revolution is underway outside their windows.  Under the cooperation between Visconti and Lancaster the audience experiences the transformation of Don Fabrizio from old to new.  This transformation is what helps provide for a brilliant cinematic experience as it offers eye candy, profound insights, and a tale that will not be forgotten.",1088035200,4,2791,5.1618625277161865
1263567,5,B00003CWQL,"Adapted from a novella by Giuseppe Tomasi di Lampedusa, The Leopard paints a vivid picture of the Italian aristocracy falling from grace and the middle class revolting to form a more democratic Italy on an epic canvas. Caught up in this class revolution is an affluent family led by the Prince of Salina, Don Fabrizio Corbera (Burt Lancaster). He recognizes that he is part of an obsolete generation and that his young nephew, Tancredi Falconeri (Alain Delon), and his beautiful fiance, Angelica Sedara (Claudia Cardinale), represent the new order.
The first DVD features an audio commentary by film scholar Peter Cowie. He provides the backstory to Visconti's career leading up to The Leopard. Cowie talks at length about the film in relation to its source material. This is a strong, informative track that is an excellent introduction to the cinema of Visconti.
The second DVD starts off with a fantastic, hour-long documentary, entitled ""A Dying Breed: The Making of the Leopard,"" that was created especially for the DVD. There are interviews with most of the surviving cast and crew, including Claudia Cardinale and the film's screenwriters.
This is an excellent look at The Leopard from the origins of the novel to the film's botched U.S. version that truncated Visconti's vision and was re-dubbed with English-speaking actors.
There is also a ""Goffredo Lombardo Interview"" with the producer of The Leopard.
""The History of Risorgimento"" examines the real historical figures and the times they lived in with the professor of Italian Studies at the University of Pennsylvania, Millicent Marcus. This is a really good primer for anyone who is unfamiliar with this particular period of Italian history.
Finally, there is a ""Promotional Materials"" section with an extensive stills gallery, a vintage Italian newsreel of the film's premiere and its success at that year's Cannes Film Festival, and three trailers-one Italian and two American.
The third and final DVD features a remastered copy of the truncated U.S. version that was dubbed in English and included Lancaster's actual voice.
Criterion has pulled off quite a coup with this DVD set. This is the first time that The Leopard has ever appeared on DVD. Criterion has painstakingly restored the film to its original glory, with a flawless transfer and included both the Italian and U.S. versions. It is a fitting package for this cinematic masterpiece.",1087430400,13,2412,5.187179487179487

1263609,5,B00003CWQL,"This story is set in mid-nineteenth century Sicily at the time of Giuseppe Garibaldi's insurrection, when he got Vittorio Emanuelle installed as king and gave the people the plebiscite that established a republican form of government.

Lancaster plays a prince (the leopard) who lost power, but maintained his position of respect among the people because he played his part judiciously, accepting change graciously.

Not a bloody or violent film, but full of human faults and frailty.  The part played by Lancaster holds it all together.  He plays his part flawlessly, always in character, and it turns out to be a great movie, well played and interesting.

See it if you get the chance.  It covers a little known episode in history, and is very entertaining to boot.

Fortunately, it arrived in the summer, as I and my friends went to the afternoon performance each of the six days it spent in our little, provincial town. One of those friends was studying cinematography, another later became a concert pianist, one was intent upon becoming a writer, and we were all considered ourselves critics of Italian film as only an 18-year-old could be in those dear, dead days when Visconti set the standard for the globe in beauty and creativity. Our unalterable opinion then, as now, is that The Leopard was, and remains, the most beautiful film ever made. Sadly, that conclusion is based predominately on memory.
It has been enormously frustrating to try to view the film during the past 40 years, as it, unlike Visconti's other magnificent efforts, has been singularly unavailable. I have been chiding everyone who would listen to create a DVD of this film, and now it has been done. I profoundly hope mine is one of the earliest orders in, as I have an incredible desire not only to see this wonderful film again, but to own a copy which I can enjoy at my leisure.

Thankfully, the Criterion Collection is going to release the movie in its 187-minute, which is still shorter than the intended 205-minutes but still better than the American version, which butchered 40-minutes of this great masterpiece. ""The Leopard"" is the definition of an epic film with great lavish sets and an extraordinary ensemble. And thank god it is the Criterion Collection who are going to distribute it. Even though their DVDs are heavily priced, it is worth it because they clean and put touch-ups on every single frame one at a time. No company puts that much emphasis and dedication on their films. That is why they release only a handful of DVDs each year. Their extra materials are also insightful and this time they have it put into three DVDs.

1263616,5,B00003CWQL,"First of all we must separate Visconti's Il Gattopardo, all the 225 minutes of it, from the mess recut, recolored, re-dubbed by 20th Century Fox and distributed as a sort of Burt Lancaster vehicle.
I speak of the original.
Under Count Lucchino Visconti di Modrone's direction and with the aid of 263 technicians, 4300 candles, 500 pairs of white gloves, 5113 costumes, real food, wine, 6 tailors with 56 seamsters, a laundry service, 4 bootmakers and 644 meters of track on which three cameras rolled, Burt Lancaster, Rina Morelli, Alain Delon, Claudia Cardinale and other magnificent actors transport us to a time of revolutonary change, destruction and renewal in Sicily, 1860.
Neither opulence nor poverty become so obtrusive that we forget what is going on with the Prince of Salina. The sets are magnificent: the villa at San Lorenzo is in real life Villa Boscogrande and the palazzo of the Princes Ponteleone where the great 44 1/2 minute ballroom scene takes place is none other than Palazzo Gangi in Palermo.
Amid all this splendor Prince Salina, the Leopard, senses the end of his world, of his own class. Actually he contributes to it by encouraging his penniless but charming nephew Tancredi (Delon) to marry the vulgar but extremely rich and beautiful Angelica, daughter of Calogero Sedara, one of the ""up and coming"" men of the post revolutionary world, a resident of the Prince's fief of Donnafugatta.
The Prince tries to make sense of this new world but the events leave a bitter taste in his mouth. He even repeats Tancredi's maxim, "" things have got to change if we want them to stay as they are,"" but he does so without much conviction and he thinks of the family tomb at the Capuchins when the rest of Parlemitan society dances the evening away through the magnificent Baroque and Rococco rooms of the great Palazzzo Gangi.
It took 48 nights to film the ball scene and the results are apparent. It and the rest of the film are sheer perfection.

It seems amazing, however, its relative obscurity, compared for example to the somewhat overhyped Death in Venice, which I consider to be much inferior to Il Gatopardo. It is also one of my favourite films of all time. Lancaster's performance is unforgetable, the ambience, the music, the story and the painful ending, all amount to a masterpiece difficult to match. The Sicilian landscape is captured in all its magic and grandiosity and dominates my memories of the film.  Comparing it to Gone with the Wind is, I think, a bit frivolous, as, with due respect, the estethics of both films - one Italian-European, the other American - are light years apart, without at all questioning the merits of the American film. Sadly, the pervasive notoriety of GWTW is also light years apart from the obscurity of Il Gatopardo.

I also remember the ballroom scene which lasted forever, but  I was fascinated with how real it was.  The ball was being thrown in Sicily  in the summer.  It would have been hot, so Visconti -- with his exacting  eye for detail -- had the actors constantly sweating profusely.  I do not  remember much of the story, but I'll never forget the feel.  It was like a  time capsule.  The details that were captured seemed so authentic that it  felt like really going back in time -- not some Hollywood produced  caricature of the past.  This really was what it was like back then.  I  have not seen this movie for sixteen years, but every time I get on a movie  database, I look for it.  It has never been released on video or DVD, but  after reading the other reviews, it apparently has had the same impact on  other viewers.",963360000,11,1200,4.469767441860465
1263798,5,B00003CWQL,"I only saw this film once, in a theatre in N.W. Washington, in1983.  The fact that I can remember where I saw this film illustrateshow memorable it is.... to my taste, ""Il Gatopardo"" (""The Leopard"") is more compelling and engrossing, as it operates on more levels than does ""Gone with the Wind."" During the film, I felt like I was living another life, in another time and place, such was the story telling quality of the film.  I also came away from it with the images fresh in my memory from the great cinematography, and my mind stimulated by the many ideas treated in the film.  Seeing the movie prompted me to read the Book ""The Leopard"" by Giuseppi Tomasi di Lampedusa, and I thought the movie had come as close as a movie can to doing justice to this great book. I also went on to read ""The Siren and Selected Writings"" by the same author, and ""The Last Leopard,"" a biography of di Lampedusa by David Gilmour.  Suffice it to say that I have never read ""Gone with the Wind,"" or ""Dr. Zhivago."" Anyway, I have been searching for a video of this film ever since, and the best I have been able to do until now was get a copy recorded of French T.V., (dubbed in French).... if it does come out on DVD, I will be standing in line.  This movie is both memorable and enjoyable, a feast for the eyes, mind, and imagination.  If you get a chance to see the film, don't let it pass.  In the meantime, I can recommend the books I mentioned.",957657600,15,1433,4.265682656826568
1263799,5,B00003CWQL,"Giuseppe Di Lampedusa (who wrote the title novel, only published after his death), Luchino Visconti and Burt Lancaster create together an operatic epic with a personal focus on the title character played magnificently by  Lancaster.  One of the few films to capture a sense of historical time and  individuals living through that time.  With many subtle and substantial  supporting characters.  Acted by, among many others, the youthful Alain  Delon and Claudia Cardinale.  Moving cinematography and an integral and  expressive score by the maestro Nino Rota (with the exception of a waltz by  Verdi.)  Tired of Tuscany?  Spend a few hours in Sicily with The Leopard  aka Burt Lancaster.",956275200,10,687,5.25

7917188,1,B00003CWQL,I wanted to like it. It's got Burt Lancaster and Claudia Cardinale. The scenery is nice. But I would rather count numbers at the DMV.  It's got 3 discs so you can foray into advanced levels of boredom.,1522886400,,201,4.2894736842105265

Sequences will embed themselves in you memory - a family journey, a picnic, a wedding - and some images will never go away - a dust-covered family in church - a Great Dane tugging a sleeve - games of hide-and-seek - a beautiful man toweling off.....
I recall when the full and restored version was released in the late 80's (I saw it in Santa Monica), and the masterpiece revealed at last. Rang my head like a chinese gong - I walked out dazed and exhilirated, and now I want to see it again",1516838400,,537,4.223300970873787
