This is not found in God's Word- No examples of ever anyone saying a sinner's prayer for Salvation! Plus, kids are already in fellowship with God! Check the Bible out and see for yourself!",1419552000,2,369,4.522388059701493
8340433,5,B001T46TA6,Excellent quality!  This show gives God the Glory for His creation in a fun way that any age will enjoy.  This is not a cartoon - it is real video footage of various wild and domesticated animals with biblically based information.  Great learning tool!,1391299200,,252,4.681818181818182

Thank you",1388880000,,124,4.681818181818182

8340436,1,B001T46TA6,This was disappointing.  It was purchased to use for a children's program as we begin a unit on creation.  The quality of the video is amateurish by today's standards.  Hopefully it will hold the interest of of the younger classes but we will need to find something else for the older kids.,1282521600,3,290,4.538461538461538
