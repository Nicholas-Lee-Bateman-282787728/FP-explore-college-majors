2529904,3,B000EQHXIC,"Well, the shipping was very quick, and the product was definitely what was ordered, but the inside plastic was broken, and that scratched a few of the disks. Not badly, they were still playable, but we had to get little paper cases so that the disks would be save and we could still keep them in the box.

Kind of disappointing, but altogether it wasn't awful.",1203292800,2,360,4.454545454545454
2529905,4,B000EQHXIC,"You probably wouldn't start buying 3rd Rock from the Sun with Season 4.  If you liked the other seasons, most likely you would like this one too.  The quality of the show doesn't change very much over time.  The show does start being a little more over the top, probably as they exhaust the more conventional situations and need to find new material.  Also, it was my family's observation that the language and situations get a bit cruder as the seasons go by.  Season 4 is in the middle of that process.  If you think  that is a problem, you might not want this one, and you probably don't want the final two seasons either.",1184371200,3,625,4.3826086956521735

2529907,3,B000EQHXIC,"3rd Rock From the Sun remained a great comedy throughout it's entire run, and the humor has aged very well. In my opinion, this is the funniest show ever on American television. Unfortunately, the ""extra"" features on the DVD this season add up to about 6 minutes of fluff. At least season 3 gave us a few commentaries, but even then some of the commentary was terrible - I'd have expected more from French Stewart. Even so, this is an easy purchase to recommend, but Anchor Bay would do better releasing these season sets bare bones rather than giving us ""extras"" that just get worse with each season set.

Funniest moment from this season:

William Shatner: I saw something on the wing!

John Lithgow: I saw something on the wing too!

(It's an inside joke referring to the twilight zone series and movie, so everybody may not ""get it"".",1156896000,3,837,4.597315436241611
2529908,5,B000EQHXIC,"I enjoyed 3rd Rock when it was on tv and I enjoy it even more on cd. I have no doubt there are other life forms in existence and this series carried that supposition to a very amusing level.  In reality I think there are probably ""DANGER/STAY OUT"" signs posted way out in space around earth, such as you would see around a tiger's cage at a zoo, and when the first atomic bomb went off they moved the signs evern further out.  We as humans are strange, and deadly, creatures and the humor in this series brings home many of our quirks in an amusing fashion.  To really understand another intelligent life form we first have to be able to understand ourselves.  The episode about dreaming is a classic, as is the one about the common cold.  This is one of the tv series that would be a natural for a follow up mission to earth by the high commander and his crew.",1154736000,,861,4.225609756097561

2529911,5,B000EQHXIC,"At last we get uncut versions for the fourth season episodes, Dick, Sally, Harry and Tommy are back in all of their glory.

For those who remember, in the last episode of season three Harry was kidnapped by Vicki's boyfriend.  He is working as a sideshow freak at a carnival and doesn't want to return to the group.  Mary is promoted to Dean and Dick assumes that he has some power as her boyfriend.  Laurie Metcalf co-stars as Dick's new love interest for several episodes.  The crew is still having problems with holidays and taxes then they attend a family reunion.  It isn't thier family, but who cares.  The season ends with a two parter that presages the arrival of the Big Giant Head.

Laughs abound in this season and I can highly recommend this DVD set.  Don't forget to watch the bloopers.",1146700800,25,799,4.531468531468532

Disclaimer:
I live in Germany.
I never got to see this show in its ""original length"" (I read that [before 2005]it's the syndicated versions).
None of my discs were faulty, and on my 55"" screen, and through my Bose 5.1 surround system, the
audio and video was just FINE.
What a remarkable price!

THAT said, I enjoyed all 6 seasons. Some of the episodes are wet-your-pants funny!
The video quality is excellent; and the stereo soundtrack r-o-c-k-s !
There is an episode---in Season ONE---that is in 3D. Someone smarter than me will have to explain how
it's done: The episode presents dreams that looks absolutely NORMAL [on TV], and, yet, when you put on
some of those blue/red cardboard glasses (which are NOT supplied), the 3D is ab-so-lute-ly AMAZING.

1.) Individual seasons are available @ $6, per, (6x6=36).
2.) My recommendation: The entire series is even cheaper.
3.) Either way, the discs are spindled/or put in paper sleeves... to keep costs to a minimum.
4.) I recommend you ""re-package them, yourself, as follows:
....a. Put them in three different 6-DVD cases (or, as I did...)
....b. Put seasons 1&2 in a clear six-DVD flapper case; and all of the DVDs, in seasons three through six,
in a 12-DVD flapper case.",1423785600,,1573,5.899122807017544

That's something I haven't done with a TV show in a LONG time! It was such a pleasure to watch these guys again! To see Joseph Gordon-Levitt hone the skills that make him such an awesome actor today...and to watch John Lithgow act the perfect fool. In light of his performance as a serial killer in DEXTER, it's amazing to see his work in this comedy. And the ensemble work of all the actors is just a delight.",1400716800,,580,4.429906542056075

2530014,5,B000EQHXIC,"Brilliant writing and incredible actors.  I think a large part of the success is also due to the casting for this series.  This is one of my all time favorite TV shows.  A ""family"" of universe wise aliens comes to earth (Rutherford, Ohio, USA).  The comedy generated by the these aliens who are so naive about humans and their interactions with humans is hysterical.

And no, i don't have a cheap dvd player, its a brand new Sony blu-ray/dvd player that i have zero trouble with.

Viewing and trying to understand human emotions and cultures has never been portrayed in a funnier manner.

2530079,5,B000EQHXIC,"I bought all six seasons. I watch a few episodes most every night at bed time. When I've gone through the entire six seasons I start over again. If I've had a bad day it puts me in a better mood and I don't go to sleep brooding. If I've had a good day then it's the perfect ending.  The writing and the acting is so Par Excellent I just never get tired of watching a episode or two most every night.

Never in my experience have I bought so much entertainment for so little money
