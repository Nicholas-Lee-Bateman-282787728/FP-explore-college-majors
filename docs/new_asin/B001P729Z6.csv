8332210,3,B001P729Z6,"Warning!  If you are thinking this is a DVD of fairy tales from Hans Christian Andersen be aware that some of these stories are NOT the traditional versions.  That does not mean they aren't good, but they may not be what you were dreaming of when you saw the title of this DVD.  I'm a children's librarian, and we have this DVD and most of these books in our library.  Here is what is on the DVD.
1.  The Ugly Duckling - mostly static pictures with only tiny bits of animation.  Over long for small children.  My librarian experience is that children don't like the videos like there where a camera pans a still image.
2.  Emperor's New Clothes - This is the traditional fairy tale told in a humorous way.  The emperor's bare bottom is shown several times, which may bother conservative parents.  I've never had a library parent complain about this, but thought I should mention it.
3. The Nightingale - A Chinese emperor loves the singing of a captured bird, but the bird wants freedom.
4.  Red Shoes - Not the traditional Hans Christian Andersen tale.  They have turned this into a story about two urban, little girls who love to dance.  Narrated by Ossie Davis.  This is a good book/video, but is not traditional.
5.  The Little Match Girl - Not the classic story.  This is a modern version about a homeless family who lives in the NYC subway.  I don't like the way they change the ending of this story.
6.  The Swineherd - A classic version about a poor Prince who wants to marry the emperor's daughter.  Personally, don't like the style of the illustrations, but that's probably just me.
This is not a bad DVD, but Scholastic also offers one that has 20 fairy tales, including some of the videos on this DVD, for a much cheaper price.  It's called 20 Fairy Tales - Scholastic Storybook Treasures, and it costs $4.49.  As a children's librarian who has watched both of these DVD multiple times, I recommend that one over this one.",1463443200,,1934,4.5
