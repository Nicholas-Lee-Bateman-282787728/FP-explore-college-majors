7958038,5,B000062VX6,"I took yoga classes from this gentle and quiet-spoken yoga teacher many years ago. I have not yet received this video in the mail, but I am sure anything Kathy Lee has produced will be useful. Just wish she were still alive and that there were discs available to purchase.",1395014400,,272,4.46
7958039,5,B000062VX6,I would rather do this video in my own home than go to a studio and do a yoga session with a less qualified and less thorough teacher--and most yoga teachers are far less helpful than Kathy Lee.  She is a gentle and quiet instructor who will lead you through an excellent and well balanced workout that leaves you feeling so glad you took the time for yourself!,1168473600,,361,4.3088235294117645
