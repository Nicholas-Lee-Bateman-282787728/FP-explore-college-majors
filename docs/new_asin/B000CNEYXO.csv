2467215,5,B000CNEYXO,"lightSOURCE with Hemi-Synch is an award-winning product offering great art at a great price.  Sacred geometry has been known for centuries to be an uplifting topic for meditation and study.  This product combines ever changing sacred geometries that are pleasing for your eyes, with the patented Hemi-Synch sounds that both relax and expand your mind.  Equally good as a  provocatively interesting background at a party or a focus for serious meditation.  A best buy.",1136937600,10,467,5.256756756756757

8099744,5,B000CNEYXO,This CD clears your mind and relaxes your body. It puts you in a trance state of being. The images are beautiful.,1333929600,,113,4.181818181818182
8099745,4,B000CNEYXO,"I very much enjoyed the sacred geometry visuals and soundtrack (Higher), but for some reason the audio and visual tracks do not sync up on my copy when viewed in wide screen mode with the first few minutes of visuals having a silent audio track.  It's not really a big deal, but I would have been able to give five stars if this was corrected.  I contacted the Monroe Inst. and they said that the problem does not occur on the new DVD.",1229299200,,435,4.228915662650603
8099746,5,B000CNEYXO,"If you know anyone who has trouble falling asleep-get them this DVD! It's so mezmorizing. You can feel something happening in your head. I got somewhat foggy and had trouble snapping out of my altered state even after I left the room. My eldest child who is a light sleeper and has never been a fan of taking naps, completely konked out after 10 minutes of this movie and I had trouble waking him up! No one is really watching this DVD anymore in my house because of the powerful effects, but it's worth a purchase since the visuals are super. And if you need help falling asleep this will probably do the trick.",1214956800,2,612,4.37719298245614
8099747,5,B000CNEYXO,Slow is good! I really enjoy kaleidoscopes and this is almost 2 hours of delightful colors and images. It's very relaxing and I can't get through the whole thing without falling deeply asleep. I find it not only relaxing but  also beautiful. Especially the snowflake design.,1204588800,2,274,4.956521739130435
8099748,2,B000CNEYXO,"These are traditional Sacred Geometry patterns animated to colorful death to a so-so soundrack. Monroe Institute's Metamusic has never been a favorite of mine. Jeffrey Thompson would have been so much better.

The images would be great if they intermixed, morphed from one to another, varied their sizes, multiplied, and generally evolved much faster. Instead what you get is image one changing colors, disappearing, and getting redone, all by the numbers (color 1, color 2...), slowly and for a looooooooong time. Then you get image two..... same thing. Then you either fall asleep; or decide to get up to make sure the grass is growing properly on your neighbor's front lawn.",1195689600,10,677,5.099099099099099
8099749,5,B000CNEYXO,"The reviewer above is off base. Sure, the sound track from Monroe is their best selling soundtrack, but this DVD is the only product where Hemi-Sync sound is available in ""5.1 Surround Sound""...a true first...for the first time you can get the amazing full impact of Hemi-Sync without having to wear headphones.

The graphics are not 'just some famous symbols."" They are ""classic,"" authentic, and very powerful ""true"" Sacred Geometries (not computer generated fractals or made-up mandalas). And they are animated and brought to life in ways I've never seen before. The colors are incredible.

In December 2006 Nexus Magazine said, ""The Lightsource DVD is absolutely stunning, especially if you like to watch the most inspirational of sacred geometrical shapes and listen to Monroe's Hemi-Sync music/tones at the same time.  Put this on the big screen, sit back and prepare to blast off.  I rate this as 'truly awesome'!""

I listened to them. They are right. I love this DVD.",1169510400,15,974,5.0625
8099750,1,B000CNEYXO,"I bought this one because I like those visual ambient mindenhancing dvd's usually very much and over the years have seen quite a few really good ones.

But this one doesn't do it at all. It sucks. Sorry folks,but for this kind of money you feel ripped off.

The soundtrack was already available before from the Monroe Institute,so nothing new there. The graphics-man-check out some REAL stuff!

I strongly recommend Dvd's like ""Merkabah""by J.J.Hurtak and the Academy for future Sciences,or ""Luminous Dimensions""(with the music of Jeff Pearce! Very good!),or ""Illuminated Manuscripts"" with an incredible soundtrack by Fritz Heede. THESE are good movies in that genre.

The graphics here are just some famous symbols,mostly geometrical ones that change colour a bit but otherwise don't move much at all. Not much vision and creativity in this project.

I don't know what's with the Monroe people these days. There used to be some really good stuff from them,well,years ago.

Jeffrey Thompson does much better stuff in a similar way.

Don't buy this one and don't get fooled by people trying to convince you otherwise because they are probably the ones that want to sell their copy.

Cheers!",1168473600,16,1188,5.087628865979381
8099751,5,B000CNEYXO,"This DVD provides gorgeous, ever-changing visuals, good ambient music, and a great meditative state. We even found that listening and watching prior to going to bed resulted in longer, more satisfying sleep.",1146528000,16,207,5.5
8099752,5,B000CNEYXO,"I have neer been able to meditate without getting a headache or going to sleep...until now.  I was watching this product on my TV this week and suddenly realized I was in a meditative space with my eyes open!  It was amazing.  I felt so relaxed, comfortable, safe and in control.  Of course once my mind caught on to what was happening I was no longer in the meditative space, but I now know what it feels like and will use this fantastic product as my tool to relaxation and who knows what terrific insights await me.

Thank you so much for making this possible for me.",1136937600,20,570,4.289719626168225
