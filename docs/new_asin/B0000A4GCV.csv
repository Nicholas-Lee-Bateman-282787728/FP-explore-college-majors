1901806,4,B0000A4GCV,"Although this was a gift to a little league player, I did view the video. Play Ball!: Basic Pitching. Authentic Little League baseball guide was informative, accurate, inspiring, creative and helpfull to the youngster I gave this to. He has remarked that he learned some things from the video. His coach, who also viewed the video, said he was ammused but not impressed. NOTE: The coach lead his team to a 3win 9 loss season (so much for his opinion).",1321056000,,451,4.65
1901807,4,B0000A4GCV,"This is a good training video, I recommend it for kids and parents. The pitching mechanics section is good, but he skips a couple key items(i.e. both the position of the stride foot, and tucking the elbow on the glove hand, during delivery). However, it gives simple straight forward instructions that are easy to follow. I liked the section on types of pitches and grips, very good. I also appreciated the message that Little Leaguers should not throw curve balls. To paraphrase he states, ""kids are going to try to throw curve balls anyway, so lets not put our heads in the sand and pretend it doesn't exist, lets show them how to do it properly so they don't hurt their arms."" I agree. He strictly talks about the overhand curve, he doesn't teach a slider for good reason. Kids shouldn't try to throw it at all.
The tips from the pros were a little lame, but they're pros and I'm not.
A great book to go with this is ""The Little League Guide to Correcting the 25 Most Common Mistakes"" by John Montelelone.",1109376000,26,1008,4.483695652173913

7995816,4,B0000A4GCV,"Excellent video. I love Ray Ramone, but his intro is painful. Kids don't care about him playing stickball, and neither do I - get to the point. Some of the athletes are pretty dull too, but overall good advice in this video - best to a novice coach to watch and figure out how to help young (~8-10yrs old) kids improve their mechanics a bit.",1394064000,,341,4.2615384615384615

7995820,5,B0000A4GCV,This was great for my grandsons. All 3 are pitchers and the Play Ball Pitching shows them how to keep from screwing up their arms by throwing the wrong way. I liked how it was described to them and then shows how to actually throw properly. Bud Black is my hero..,1366156800,,263,4.176470588235294
7995821,4,B0000A4GCV,"While teaching the children how to pitch presenters also provided cautions and exercises to keep arms conditioned and prevent injury.  This was very nicely done and very informative.  Three basic pitches are taught while cautioning that only two of them are allowed in little league as the third, if carried out incorrectly, could cause injury.",1361232000,,344,5.236363636363636
