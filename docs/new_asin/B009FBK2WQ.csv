8551522,5,B009FBK2WQ,It tells me everything I wanted to know and explained even more cuts than I wanted to learn about.  Made cutting up these two steers go MUCH faster. It has a real home made quality BUT the show and tell makes it easy to follow. We also purchansed 'The Art of Beef Cutting: A meat Professional's Guide to Butchering' to help as we were cutting.,1354406400,,343,4.276923076923077
