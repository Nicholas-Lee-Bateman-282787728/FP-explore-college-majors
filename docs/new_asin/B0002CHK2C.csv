2076177,4,B0002CHK2C,Sweating in the Spirit has brought new meaning to what an inspirational exercise routine is. It is spiritually uplifting and motivating and you do sweat in the spirit!,1099958400,8,167,5.0
2076178,4,B0002CHK2C,"I had so much fun doing this workout that I forgot I was working out! Sweating in the Spirit includes 3 workouts - 30 min Gospel Aerobics, 10 min Strengthing the Spirit, and 10 min Spirit Stretch - which you can do separately or together. The class is made up of exercisers of all different shapes and sizes. You work out to gospel music, including live performances by Kirk Franklin, Shirley Murdock, and Yolanda Adams. The class is very vocal and enthusiastic, but NOT so much that it gets annoying.

As an instructor, Donna Richardson is very encouraging. She reminds you how important it is to ""take care of your temple."" She tells you to just have fun and not worry how you look. She makes you feel like you're just dancing with friends, not working out.

The aerobics section is dance-based but the moves aren't too complicated - I didn't get them all at first but I eventually picked them up. The strength section is pilates-based and does not use weights, although you may want to use a mat if you don't have a carpeted floor. In the stretch section, Yolanda Adams sings live and Donna doesn't want to talk over her to cue the moves. She kind of whispers the cues but you basically just have to follow along.

Overall this workout is lots of fun! It's great for beginners and not at all intimidating. I consider myself to be an intermediate exerciser and it still got my heart pumping. For advanced exercisers this would be better for when you want a ""light"" day.",1097712000,113,1471,4.522556390977444

2076204,3,B0002CHK2C,"I love Donna Richardson, her personality is so upbeat and her cue-ing has always been easy to follow.  On this DVD, though, she is trying to yell her cues over her musical guests, who are singing loudly as Donna is giving instructions. Even when her guests leave, the background music has vocals that are competing with Donna's instruction. As if that wasn't distracting enough, there are some backup singers on a stage behind her that sometimes do the moves with the exercisers, sometimes do their own thing. If that sort of thing doesn't bother you, you'll enjoy the music, and Donna is her usual perky, happy, friendly self.  The workout is beginner to intermediate.",1401321600,2,669,4.859649122807017

 We should worship the God Almighty, the three in One- God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. And we worship Him in Truth. We should not claim to be Christians and mislead people.",1378857600,2,452,4.317647058823529

in my old VCR. I ordered this one with the same name. It is the newer version with new dance steps, new singers...
everything to update it to the current music. It includes praise music, which makes the workout not only healthy but

2076226,2,B0002CHK2C,"I am not a dancer.  This is definitely not for beginners.  Just finished my first workout with it....very frustrated!  It is highly frustrating to learn because she doesn't teach the move more than once or twice.  Plus she teaches it quickly so it's very difficult to follow.  Also, the camera work doesn't focus on the feet enough, so before you even figure out what your feet are supposed to be doing, it's focusing solely on the arms.  I had to rewind certain moves a whole bunch of times to try to figure out what she was doing.  I turned it off I was so frustrated.  I'm sure it will be a good cardio workout ...IF I can stick with it long enough to learn the moves.  Love the music, though.

It would have been really nice if she had a slow instruction section to learn the moves, and then another section where you can do the workout full speed like it's supposed to be done.",1374278400,3,882,4.290909090909091

2076245,3,B0002CHK2C,"This workout video was ok. I like the fact that she has the routines to gospel music. One thing that I did not much care for was when Yolanda Adams was singing live (don't get me wrong, I just love Yolanda Adams). The problem was; I could not hear the instructions on how to follow along with the workout. They were drowned out by Yolanda's beautiful voice. So I had to watch that part several times to understand the steps. But overall it is a good workout video. Some parts were funny too, especially when Kirk Franklin came out.",1354060800,,531,4.373737373737374

2076248,2,B0002CHK2C,This workout dvd is ok I guess. I really didn't like it. She's too chipper and it's kind of boring.,1334188800,,99,4.0
2076249,2,B0002CHK2C,"I must begin by saying I am an avid ""winter"" workout DVD ""junkie.""  I have worked out on DVD with Jillian Michaels, Leslie Sansone, Billy Blanks, Jane Fonda, Denise Austin, and many other lesser known fitness ""experts.""  I consider myself fairly coordinated & in shape.

 I purchased this workout DVD in hopes of finding a ""Christian"" workout DVD that didn't focus on how our bodies look but on exercising for health.  I was excited about workouting out to Christian music as well.  As far as these two facts, I was pleased.

HOWEVER!  I am very unhappy with the workout overall for these reasons:

1.  The aerobic part of the workout was tailored more like dance moves as opposed to traditional workout moves.  I do not have coordination to dance and, although I have little to no problem keeping up with a variety of other traditional workout videos, I had a very difficult time keeping up with her moves.

2.  She transitioned from move to move (even sequencing them together) with very little instruction and very quickly, so by the time I began to ""figure it out,"" she was moving on to something new.  This was very frustrating.

3.  I had assumed that the attire of the workout crew would be at least partially modest.  I can understand seeing some stomach, but bouncing breasts and very low cut tops showing deep clevage was not a welcomed sight to watch as I was supposed to be ""working out in worship.""

4.  The strength/pilates training section was not very challenging at all.  She has you do a few moves (lunges, leg lifts) but not enough to make you feel as if you did any lasting good.  I do give her credit for the extended portion of bicycle crunches - in this section alone did any of my muscles begin to burn.

5.  The stretch section begins with Yolanda Adams singing a praise song.  Donna Richardson begins the stretch, but there is no instruction - unless you can read her lips.  So you just have to follow along as you watch her.  Once again, I like instruction so I did not appreciate this part.  After the song, Donna give more time for stretching and does give instruction.

So, if you like to dance, if you like gospel music, and if you are looking for a workout video that isn't too challenging as far as physical difficulty (doesn't work you too hard), this is the video for you.  Otherwise, you might look elsewhere.",1326499200,3,2345,4.543062200956938
2076250,5,B0002CHK2C,The gospel music is upbeat and gets you moving.  Before you know it the workout is over.  I totally recommend this workout!,1311292800,,123,4.545454545454546
2076251,5,B0002CHK2C,i love the tape. having the artist perform there songs was extra special. Donna really give you a great workout. It is a great pace and you get to work all body parts.,1307923200,2,167,4.090909090909091
2076252,5,B0002CHK2C,"I ALMOST DIDN'T BUY THIS BECAUSE OF THE FEW REVIEWS THAT SAID THIS WORKOUT IS FOR BEGINERS; OR SOMEONE WHO HAS NOT EXERCISED IN A WHILE.

SO GLAD I DECIDED TO TAKE A CHANCE. I LOVE IT!! IT IS A DANCE WORKOUT, FOR ANY LEVEL OF FITNESS; WITH INSPIRATIONAL MUSIC, THAT MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD ON THE INSIDE.

ACTUALLY I DID SHED A FEW TEARS TWICE, WHILE WORKING OUT; NOT BECAUSE I WAS SAD, BUT, BECAUSE IT FEELS GREAT TO BE ABLE TO EXERCISE AGAIN. I ALMOST BECAME PARALIZED IN A RUNNING INCIDENT IN 2004. FOUR YEARS LATER, I HAD TO HAVE SPINAL SURGERY. I COULDN'T JOG FOR AT LEAST A YEAR AFTER SURGERY; MAYBE 5 MIN, WITH VERY LITTLE EXTENSION IN MY STRIDE. SO NOW I AM BACK JOGGING, BUT STILL BEING CAREFUL. WHICH I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD RUN AGAIN. SO THEREFORE I AM EXTREMELY GREATFUL FOR MY PAINFREE ABILITY TO NOT JUST WALK AGAIN, BUT I CAN RUN, AND JUMP TO MY HEARTS CONTENT.

BACK TO THE DVD... EVERYONE WILL ENJOY IT. IT IS NOT STRENUOUS ON YOUR JOINTS, AND IT IS FUN, AND FULL OF LIFE; FROM TOP TO BOTTOM..& YES YOU WILL DEFINITELY SWEAT

UPDATE: When purchasing this video I was not focused on shedding pounds, nor inches; but instead, I was just wanting to get moving again; but doing something different. Glad to say I have definitely lost quite a few inches on my upper body especially, my shoulders, my wrists, I have to get my watch links put back in. Triceps, biceps, collar bone area, rear shoulder area, where my bra holds a lot of the fat at bay? you know what I am referring too. Any how, I can now wear jackets that were extremely tight.

 This is a very inspiring dvd which makes working out fun. It is more of an upper body workout, without realizing it; lots of clapping, and arm movement. After 2 months I still love it.

I also liked the music, I did have alot of fun and I did sweat. If you are new to excercise, this is a great work out. The moves will get your sweating, but they are not too difficult. Also you're not sweating so much that you mess up your hair or anything. So it's really great and alot of fun!",1283558400,,610,4.049586776859504

Intermediate level follow the Donna and the group dancers and you advanced folks go wild with the holy ghost.  Dance, clap, just have fun!  When you feel like you're out of breath the spirt of faith leaps into you to jump a little bit more.  You're taking care of your temple for the Lord.

I do wish there were more stretches for the lower back.  There's another video that I purchased from Amazon called Gospel Aerobics that has wonderful stretches for the lower back.  The only thing is that it's only sold in VHS format.  I do wish they would put it in DVD format. I'm 56 years old, and I try to stay in shape.

When I used to workout, I would always look at the clock hoping it would be over soon, and it would take forever! With Donna's workout I have so much fun and the time just flies by. The moves were different, not like the typical, boring workout moves, and the whole workout was fun! Boy did I work up a good sweat, and before I knew it, the hour was up. Donna did an excellent job with this one. It is so encouraging to see people who look like me, shape and skin wise! Not to mention the Gospel music! Another attribute that makes this DVD great is that you can pick and choose if you want to do the whole workout, or any one of the 3 workouts(Aerobics, Pilates, Stretch) separate. With this DVD, I know it'll make losing these 40lbs a lot easier. If anyone is like me who hates working out, but knows it's necessary, but feels like its long and boring?

I just wanted to do the routine since I knew it.  There is no part on the tape where I can just go through the routine with the music and no explanation.  This is the reason why I am rating it 2 stars and also I am bored with it so it's sitting on the shelf.,1211846400,2,414,3.6704545454545454

I love how they have people of every different size on here; it is encouraging to those who aren't in top physical condition.  Donna is very encouraging and the way she introduces new moves, makes it easy to pick up on them.  Also, the camera guys do a really great job of really zooming in on her when she's showing a new move rather than just scanning around the room like some other videos do.  It's a great buy!

8026038,5,B0002CHK2C,"This is the PERFECT workout for beginners!

Pros:
-This is made for beginners to workout videos!  Its not hard or intimidating.  For sure consult with your doctor before any workout regimen, but I would even recommend some of these workout to people with chronic health issues that would benefit from loosing weight and getting in shape.
-A nice cross section of folks represented in the workout team with all so of shapes, sizes, ages, genders, ethnicities and levels of fitness represented. (I always like to see this in workout videos.)
-Three easy to follow workouts that are self contained and have everything you need for a good workout.
-GREAT music with songs that I knew by artists I enjoy. (Shirley Murdock KILLS IT during the ""Spirit Stretch"" workout!  You'll wanna shout in the middle of the segment!)  Love Fred Hammond, Shirley Ceasar and others!!
-Felt more like praise dancing than working out, which definitely helps with maintaining a good attitude while working out.
-Donna's instructions are really clear throughout and since the moves are simple, this wins ""best in my book"" for a workout where you can just go with the flow and focus on the movements rather than scrambling to make sure you're keeping up.

Cons:
-Not much in this section!  The ""Choir"" in the back was a little distracting and felt kind pointless, but beyond that, I have no complaints.

Overall:  I've used this workout to get back in shape after the birth of both my kids.  And since its so easy and enjoyable, I don't have to amp myself up to get back into it.  It is my favorite workout video and its the one I return to  every time I need to get back on the workout wagon and it doesn't feel intimidating or irritating to do so!
