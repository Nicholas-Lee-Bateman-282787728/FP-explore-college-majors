8134281,5,B000F5Z6UO,If you ever seen a Kanye Performance then you know what to expect. Late Orchestration presents many of Kanye's greatest hits (at the time) at one of the most famous Musical Venues in the world. The DVD also comes in a velvet case which is sure to stand out within your DVD collection.,1233014400,,284,4.377358490566038
8134282,4,B000F5Z6UO,"Jay-Z might have performed with Paul McCartney, but with Late Orchestration Kanye West goes one step beyond by recording a live show at The Beatles' old studio stomping ground, London's Abbey Road. Another golden brick in the wall of Kanye West's self-proclaimed genius, Late Orchestration finds the self-assured hip hop star performing songs from his albums The College Dropout and Late Registration backed by a gorgeous all-female orchestra and guests including John Legend and Lupe Fiasco. From the opener splendour of Diamonds From Sierra Leone through to the Happy Gilmore-lyrical check in the Jesus Walks finale, Kanye proves himself to be a masterful showman as he interacts with the tiny audience of 300. Although containing less than an hour of live performance, it's the extras that kick this presentation into overdrive, with music videos, backstage footage and an interview with Kanye (where he states he ""could probably be a professional plastic surgeon"", professes a love for Lindsay Lohan's film Mean Girls and suggests with his regular bravado that he's accomplished in two years what most artists need two decades to achieve) equally impressive. Surreal film director Michel Gondry breathes a childlike wonder into the video of Heard `Em Say, while Pamela Anderson adds a saucy B-movie edge to Touch The Sky. The credits of Late Orchestration are visually akin to a James Bond film, which is hardly surprising - suave Mr West has produced as much energy, intrigue and lovely ladies on Late Orchestration as any Roger Moore adventure.",1146873600,8,1550,5.228915662650603
