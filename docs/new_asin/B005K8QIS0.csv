4716451,2,B005K8QIS0,"After viewing the first of three two-hour episodes of ""Case Histories"" on PBS tonight, I am left feeling incredibly frustrated, angry and disappointed.  Tonight's episode was adapted from Kate Atkinson's first novel featuring private detective Jackson Brodie, entitled ""Case Histories"". I had looked forward to it for months, believing that book to be the best of the three being televised by PBS.

As an avid reader, I've grown used to my favorite books being carelessly retold and poorly cast in order to fit a budget, employ a popular actor, or conform to a time frame.  I expect plots to be abbreviated and characters to be excised.  But why on earth was it necessary to change such essentials of plot and character motivation so that one murder is actually committed by someone completely different?  Was it deliberate that terribly important facts were left so murky that if you hadn't read the book before viewing the program, you'd have no bloody inkling as to what had just happened?

And was it just carelessness to have the actors speak their lines with their mouths full of food?  Their lines are tricky enough to catch when spoken with a Scottish accent, under and through ambient noises such as traffic and cutlery clattering.  But please-- have some pity on viewers, painfully straining to catch plot points while Mr. Isaacs chews and spews his pizza!

Beautiful shots of Edinburgh abound, but can't make up for the confused story-telling here.  Such a waste!  Needless to say, I plan to skip the rest of this series and reread the novels instead.

I would be interested in knowing how much Ms. Atkinson was consulted in the making of this sorry program.  It's obvious that showcasing her ability to create an affecting and satisfying narrative was a low priority.",1318723200,28,1779,4.909698996655519
4716452,5,B005K8QIS0,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching this series.  The acting is quite good, and the cast consists of many veteran UK actors who are recognizable from other dramas. The series is well written.  It weaves together multiple investigations within each story line.  For example, the first drama consists of three investigations, as well as developments in the private life of the main protagonist, Jason Isaacs. I watched the UK episodes without captions and the PBS episodes with captions, and the use of captions greatly helped me understand the dialogue. I strongly urge using the subtitles.

The structure used by the BBC in broadcasting this series was to air twin one-hour episodes on consecutive nights; resulting in a single drama consisting of approximately one-hour and 55 minutes.  The only problem that I have with this structure is that you have a climax in the middle of the drama, which seems unnecessary when the two episodes are viewed back to back (as opposed to on consecutive nights.)

Beginning next week, PBS will start to show these dramas in two-hour blocks (the twin UK episodes joined together).  When watching the series, keep in mind that PBS has redacted approximately 5 minutes or so in order to fit the episode into the allocated time slot. The DVD, which is not produced by PBS, contains the full UK episodes.  The 5 minutes or so cut are substantive (e.g., (i)in the first drama - scene where father abuses daughter is drastically cut, and (ii) in the third drama, the kidnapped victim's escape is drastically cut), and don't include the additional non-substantive cuts (e.g., one set of credits and titles, as well as the scene at the start of the second hour of the drama that remind the audience of what transpired on the previous night).

My only complaint regarding the DVD is the price.  $36 is a bit steep for less than six hours of TV.  I will wait until the price comes down.  For example, I purchased Downton Abbey for under $20 when it first came out, and it is cheaper now.  I expect a series like this to sell for $25 or so.  Considering the limited content (under six hours), I don't think that a higher price is justified. (NOTE TO AMAZON: $40-$50 FOR A SEASON OF NEW TRICKS IS OUTRAGEOUS.)",1318377600,152,2227,4.750649350649351
4716453,5,B005K8QIS0,"We all know that film adaptations of books are rarely up to the mark. There are exceptions.
Kate Atkinson has written some superior crime novels around English private investigator Jackson Brody, a former police man. The novel called Case Histories has him involved in 3 diverse cases at the same time, all related to mysteries about missing or dead girls.
A little girl has disappeared 30 years ago. Now her father has died and the girl's sisters find her Blue Mouse toy in father's desk.
A young girl starts an internship in her father's law firm. On her first day in office, a man shows up with a knife, kills her, and disappears.
While a woman is in jail for murdering her husband, her little girl disappears from foster care.
Lots of problems for Brody.
This is the only book of hers that I read myself. My daughter tells me that her others are also good.
A BBC series with 6 episodes based on 3 of Atkinson's Brody novels has been produced and shown on TV in summer 2011. This is brand-new stuff. I watched it with my wife and I was very impressed. If you like the genre, you will appreciate this as top of the class. The production added some local charisma  by transferring the location from somewhere in England to more remarkable Edinburgh, with all the available options on the language side.",1317340800,80,1303,4.54468085106383

Well, it's not as dark as some Scandinoire.  But it has that northern atmosphere, full force.

""That's about right.""

And while Isaacs' character presents the Leitmotif that, in our own individual ways and lives we can all relate to,  Abbington's portrayal rings like a bell.  Both have found professional high points in these roles.",1525737600,,509,5.461538461538462

I hadn't heard of Jason Issacs previously but now I love him.  His character is quiet and intense but is also a loving father (and who can resist those blue eyes!).  Amanda Abbingdon of Sherlock?

4716474,1,B005K8QIS0,"What could have been an interesting series was ruined for me by graphic sex scenes and the much too specific sexual abuse of a young girl by her father.

4716475,5,B005K8QIS0,"Case Histories really works. Jason Isaacs is credible as a former military former cop, PI, who is a ""super hero"" with a tormented soul

4716477,5,B005K8QIS0,Ok so Im only half way through the first season but heres my opinion. Jason Isaacs is great in this show! As he usually is in all he does. I love how this show is a drama with a bit of comedy that comes across totally natural. Very good flow to the show. The characters are odd but very real at the same time.  Im always looking for good mystery shows and this is the best one I've watch in a very long time. Hoping they develop more of a character for Amanda Abbington. Shes lovely to watch but so far hasn't had a lot of time on screen.,1522972800,,538,3.9357798165137616

4716484,1,B005K8QIS0,"Agree with other reviews. I wish I would have seen the other reviews prior to watching. What's worse is the women are looking at the main character like he's nothing more than a piece of meat. Would have been so much better without the inappropriate scenes.

4716488,5,B005K8QIS0,"Really good the way the characters and stories weave and connect. I really like all his odd relationships are great. That sense of aloneness after his daughter moves away is super powerful.

To find a series that both my Wife and I agree upon is quite rare but this one we both thoroughly enjoyed.  Jason Isaacs is the perfect actor to play the part of Jackson Brodie.

What we enjoyed the most about the series was how Jackson is able to solve the various crimes that are presented to him by an often very entertaining set of characters and do so by solving at least one per episode instead of dragging them out to the conclusion of the season.

At my age (late 60's), if a series can keep me awake and engaged throughout it's duration, it is definitely recommended to others - we are very much looking forward to the 2nd Season being added to Prime Video.",1522195200,,752,4.35

Cases do not necessarily end/get solved at the end of each episode and several stories are woven together seamlessly. The writing is so believable and the acting is top-notch. The characters draw us in and we want to learn all about them. The music that accompanies each episode is unique and spot-on, too.",1521936000,,463,4.948717948717949

The little girl who plays his daughter is extraordinary, and they have great chemistry. I've liked Amanda Abbington since I first saw here in Selfridges.
The 'bad guys' were really bad too, terribly, cruelly so. I have to agree with another reviewer who said the flashbacks of him as a boy and the terrible incidents with his siblings tended to be distracting, rather than helpful.

The result was much more satisfying. The entire series is well written and well acted but the last section of episodes really hit the ball out of the park.

Got tedious finding segment after segment concluded with him guzzling booze and then began with him waking up with a terrible hangover.

The twists and turns, how everything fit together was great writing. Very intense at times and funny in others. The acting was so good!

I don't dislike it but it's hard to get comfortable with the values and morals, the ethical landscape of the place. I'm used to American cop shows where, as much as we try, we're so obviously black-and-white/good-and-bad/right-and-wrong obsessed.

It's also a little hard to pick up all of what's being said because of the accents but they do all sound charming.",1520467200,,427,4.77027027027027

I love Jason Isaacs, and the background story was great.  I also love Amanda Abbington--any time an over 40 actress gets serious consideration as a heroine, I'm thrilled, and she is fantastic!  My only other complaint is that there wasn't a second (and third, etc.) season.  It ends on a cliff hanger, because there should have been more episodes of this!",1520035200,,514,4.795454545454546
4716535,3,B005K8QIS0,"This show has the potential to be something, but unfortunately doesn't seem to have the ability to get there.

One of the most notable failures upon watching is the whoever is responsible for the music. They've clearly lost their entire mind. You'll find yourself listening to music so inappropriate for each scene you'll be looking for a murder during a cheerful scene and waiting for a clown to pop up during a dramatic one. If it's not completely wrong, it's so over-the-top dramatic you feel manipulated and gross. (Think Chaplin-esk wah-wahs meets B movie horror film.)
What you should really prepare yourself for, however, is the flashback scenes that you will see a good hundred times for literally no reason at all. Is the character walking down the street? Flashback. Is he drinking coffee? Flashback to the same scene. Out for a drive? You've guessed it, same flashback. By the end of episode three, you've seen the same thing so many times you start to lose all interest in whatever so-called mystery/drama has happened in his past. You literally CAN'T care anymore, and that's a terrible thing to do to your characters.",1520035200,2,1131,4.890625

4716538,5,B005K8QIS0,"A tough guy and a man of mystery.

Detective Brodie has a past and you get snippets of it through his flashbacks and memories. IT helps explain who he is as those memories become more clear. Additionally, he's been divorced and has a daughter whom he adores. He has a soft spot for people who are hurting, and you can only imagine that is from his own painful past. He has morals that come out in a variety of ways. A man of mystery and kindness.
BUT
He's also a tough guy. He runs out to the street barefoot to chase down someone following him. He gets stitches and is up and running the next day. He isn't afraid to have those awkward conversations.

The music really added to the show. I really liked the soundtrack that came with this show. More than once I was impressed with how the music helped set the mood. The setting is lovely. Although, like many mysteries it seems to be dark a lot.

The mysteries are interesting and often blend one into another and cover one or two shows. They are well organized and the flow of the show is excellent.",1519862400,,1050,4.292929292929293
4716539,5,B005K8QIS0,"Jason Isaacs is one terrific actor.  As a Brit living in the Uk for a long time, I'm rather embarrassed to admit that I first saw him as the odious Lucius Malfoy in Harry Potter.  Then I saw him in ""The OA"" and realized what a chameleon he is.  Now with this series he's confirmed his status in my book as up there with Gary Oldman.  He's doing a Yorkshire accent while everyone else is doing Edinburgh Scots.... quite an achievement in itself and he's brilliant as Jackson Brodie, the emotionally scarred from childhood ex cop turned Private Eye.  Sounds similar to other series but not really.  As another reviewer says, the inclusion of (to me a much more realistic portrayal) of at least 3 cases going on at the same time makes the series compelling and the flashbacks serve to underline his driven need to find whoever is lost on behalf of his clients.

Amanda Abbingdon is always excellent and Zawe Ashton is spot on as the Assistant.  The rest of the cast is the usual high calibre acting found in most UK series.  Looking forward to Series 2  Why is that not here by the way since it was made back in 2013?  What's up with that Amazon?",1519776000,,1143,4.395238095238096

I've devoured the first season and although the thick Scottish accent of some of the characters is a bit hard to follow, and character development is a tad on the thin side, I did enjoy Season 1.  Jason Isaacs compensates for flaws in direction and weaknesses of some of the other actors.

4716604,4,B005K8QIS0,"Edinburgh, Scotland . Two sisters are cleaning out their Dad's house after his death. Amelia asks, ""What are we going to do with Daddy? Burial or cremation?""
Julia tosses a coin and smiles, ""Burn the bugger.""
But the jokes end when they open his desk drawer and find a stuffed animal that no one has seen since 1981, when it was supposed to have disappeared with their little sister Olivia.
In the first case of the series, they hire Jackson Brodie, P.I., to find out what happened to Olivia 30 years before.

Brodie is an ex-cop with a weather-beaten face that gets bruised up a lot. The most common comment made to him is, ""You look like crap."" He is persona-non-grata at the police precinct, except for DI Louise Munroe. Now that is complicated. Not only that, he has a young daughter, Marlee, who is the love of his life, and an ex-wife, Josie, who isn't.

""Case Histories"" is character-driven rather than forensics-driven.  Because a lot of time is spent on Brodie's personal interactions and stories, the feel is more that of a drama than a mystery series. There is occasional humor, but not the one-liner laugh-out-loud kind. The case states it ""contains violence, nudity, sexual situations, graphic images and coarse language."" It is definitely more R-rated than a ""Midsomer Murders"" or ""Miss Fisher"", but not as R-rated as ""Harry"".

The six episodes in this Complete Collection comprise two series. Series One originally aired in June 2011 and Series Two aired in May 2013. Altogether, they total 620 minutes, or over 10 hours of entertainment. The DVD set presents the show in 16:9 widescreen. English subtitles are available on the episodes and on the one Bonus Extra.

Bonus ""Behind the Scenes"" (15 minutes) Commentators include Jason Isaacs (plays Brodie), Kate Atkinson (author), Helen Gregory (producer), Amanda Abbington (plays DCI Louise Munroe) and Kristy Mitchell (plays Josie Brodie, ex-wife).

Kate Atkinson wrote a total of 4 books starring Jackson Brodie. Three of those books were adapted for these 6 episodes.  Isaacs says: ""At the heart of it is a man sorting other people's problems out and kind of ignoring his own.""

Brodie to Marlee: ""Basic interrogation fact people, when they're remembering, look up to the left. And when they're inventing, look up to the right.""

4716609,4,B005K8QIS0,"John Isaacs is excellent as Jackson Brodie an Edinburgh copper tossed off his patch and now works as a successful private detective if not a financial competent one. If money followed him as does trouble; he'd own the Bank of Scotland. He has an ex-wife who is angry with him, a twelve year old daughter who loves him, an ex colleague DC Louise Munroe (Amanda Abbinington) who both loves him and hates him, and a somewhat shady clientele. There are three two hour and three 90 minute episodes that follow in chronological order; but even so you might feel that you missed something along the way. The stories are good but convoluted at times. Generally two stories run concurrently in each episode along with some subplots. This is not an uplifting series and while some clients survive, none survive unscathed,

In season one he deals with a distraught father trying to discover why he daughter was murdered; a dead Russian hooker; and a nanny who suspects her employer might have been killed by her husband. In season two he is haunted by an assignment that went wrong and might turn out to be a kidnapping; a woman who suspects her fianc is having an affair; and an old flame who is pregnant. In his own way, Brodie either loses or leaves all the women in his life.

4716613,5,B005K8QIS0,"This combines two incredible plusses. The first is the writing of Kate Atkinson who is growing as an author book by book. This is her Jackson Brodie series of books brought to UK tv. They were excellent books and were made into excellent television. The second stellar attribute was UK actor Jason Isaacs. He is a wonderful actor plus is enormously attractive to women viewers in everything he does. If you have never seen him before, you are in for a rare treat.

It is hard to do anything innovative with detectives and investigators since it is one of the most overdone genres in every media. Kate Atkinson, however, fully explored the character of Jackson Brodie and everyone with whom he becomes involved. Thus, you cannot help but be drawn in. Brodie becomes fully engaged with everyone he comes across in his life as do you the viewer. I highly recommend this.",1441584000,,867,4.703947368421052

His assistant as well as his longtime friend and former colleague on the force find him frustrating, even irritating at times, but his single-minded pursuit of justice cuts across the complaints and yields satisfying results. Jason Isaacs infuses the character with a flawed but likable vibe, and the inviting Edinburgh locales will have you longing to visit your Scottish cousin (or wishing you had a Scottish cousin to visit). The series aired on PBS several years ago, a stingy three episodes each season that left viewers hungry for more.

One of the episodes, where a mother and child seem to have run away, is amongst the best I have ever seen in a TV genre and also outclasses almost anything on the big screen.  There is a lot of ""mood"" to these, a lot of backstory filtering into -- and coloring -- the current action, which adds complexity but it is elegantly done...... but Isaccs shows complete mastery of his sometimes contradictory character.

4716646,5,B005K8QIS0,"CASE HISTORIES COMPLETE COLLECTION.  This BBC-produced British mystery television series received its debut in 2011, was seen in the United States on PBSs Masterpiece Mystery. The second series  aired on BBC in 2013. It concerns Edinburgh-based private investigator Jackson Brodie, an emotionally-damaged former soldier and Edinburgh cop, who finds himself tracking lost cats, wayward spouses, and killers on the run.  And  does a lot of running himself, partly to unwind from the stresses of his work, but mostly to escape the memories of his traumatic past.  The police procedurals are based on the bestselling, award-winning novels by Kate Atkinson, (LIFE AFTER LIFE); the series was created for TV by Ashley Pharoah, (LIFE ON MARS), who moved  it to Edinburgh, rather than Yorkshire, where Atkinson set it. The box series consists of four discs containing nine episodes for approximately 620 minutes. Also, as extras, behind the scenes featurettes, (33 minutes), cast and crew interviews, (27 minutes). The crime drama contains nudity, violence and coarse language and is intended for mature audiences only.  And, thank goodness and RLJ Entertainment, it has subtitles, else viewers on my side of the Atlantic would be well and truly lost with the witty Scots dialog.

The former cop (Golden Globe and International Emmy nominee Jason Isaacs, HARRY POTTER, THE PATRIOT) is just trying to make a living. He has a hard time collecting his debts and paying his bills, but no shortage of clients, since he can't overlook a wrong or say no to a person in need. This character-driven  drama also stars Amanda Abbington, (AGATHA CHRISTIES POIROT, SHERLOCK), as DC Louise Munroe, seemingly the last Edinburgh cop still talking to her former colleaguewho has a bit of a soft spot for him; Zawe Ashton, (FRESH MEAT), as Deborah Arnold, his longsuffering assistant. Millie Innes plays his daughter Marlee; Kirsty Mitchell, ex-wife Josie, Natasha Little, (KIDNAP AND RANSOM), his lover and ex-lover, with whom he has a very fraught relationship, actress Julia Land.  Further guest stars include Phil Davis, (VERA DRAKE) and Sylvia Simms, (ALICES RESTAURANT). Some of Brodies clients are parents looking for children; some children, looking for parents.  Some are concerned with the past; some, with the future. The women in the investigators life don't offer him much peace, either. Isaacs, who seemingly was born to play brooding, handsome heroes, ably plays this one as a moody, damaged but still tough guy with a soft heart.  He carries the series with empathy, a realization of the terrible cost of violence to its survivors as well as its victims, and biting Scottish humor.

The episodes are:
Series 1

Episode 1: CASE HISTORIES.
Boasts three subplots. The investigator  searches for one of the cats of his crotchety client Binky Rain (Sylvia Simms); he stumbles across the 30-year old mystery of a little girl who disappeared from the house next door. The girl's sisters, Julia( Natasha Little) and Amelia Land have found their little sister's stuffed toy, Blue Mouse, where it ought not to be, while going through their late fathers things.  A distraught Theo Wyre (Phil Davis) barges into Brodie's office to beg him to look into the murder of his daughter Laura, as he doesn't have confidence in the police investigation. And a manipulative nurse, Shirley Manning, wants him to find the niece whom she put into foster care years ago.

Episode 2: ONE GOOD TURN: A JOLLY MURDER MYSTERY.
Finds Brodie, while out for one of his jogs, discovering the body of a young woman floating in the ocean. As he tries to establish her identity, he traces her to a Russian-owned and staffed maid service where the staff are afraid to speak to him. Meanwhile, the former cop witnesses a man brutally beaten in a multi-story car park, apparently in an episode of road rage that has morphed into a mugging. Fortunately, a bystander, mystery writer Martin Canning tosses his laptop at the assailant, probably saving the victim's life. But the cowardly mystery writer fears retaliation and insists that Brodie must protect him. And the captain of industry husband of Gloria Hatter has just had a heart attack while enjoying in the company of his Russian immigrant dominatrix Tatiana. As the master of the universe lies dying unconscious in a hospital bed, his wife finds that their company Hatter Homes is under investigation, as are her husband's other holdings, and an employee of his, Terence Smith might well be up to no good. Just by coincidence, the three cases turn out to be one.

Episode 3: WHEN WILL THERE BE GOOD NEWS?
Begins as Brodie works an adultery case. Gary Moore, nervous and possessive husband,  hires the detective to follow his wife Michelle. Just by coincidence, again, as Brodie walks home from the job, he sees an elderly woman whose car has stalled on the tracks of an oncoming speeding train. Brodie tries to pull her out of the car, but is struck himself. He is saved and revived by a young woman, Reggie Teague, who had been studying with the retired schoolteacher who was driving the imperiled car. When Brodie limps out of the hospital, he finds that Moore won't stop pestering his secretary for news of the infidelity case;  and that the young woman Reggie, who saved his life, thinks Brodie now owes her a favor: her employer Dr. Joanna Hunter has gone missing with her baby girl. Husband Neil claims that Dr. Hunter is visiting relatives, but Reggie, who works as her nanny, knows that she has none.

Series 2

Episode 1: STARTED EARLY, TOOK MY DOG
The investigator agrees to help a handsome young Australian woman.  She had been given up for adoption, returns to Edinburgh to find her real parents. His investigation leads him to a 35-year-old secret; carrying it has troubled everyone involved. Brodie must decide whether to let the law take its course or do what he thinks best for a child.

Episode 2: NOBODYS DARLING
A pretty young nanny hires Brodie to see if her employer/fianc&eacute; is cheating on her. During his inquiries he is also hired by the man's ex-mother-in-law, who suspects the fianc&eacute; of having murdered her daughter. A straightforward investigation turns into a cold case.  Marlee, Brodies pubescent daughter, moves in with him; his home life gets difficult.

Episode 3: JACKSON AND THE WOMEN
The women in Brodies life give him a tough time as he takes on two new cases. A teenage boy asks him to investigate the murder of his mother killed, when the boy was only three, on Christmas Eve. Another  family hires the former cop to locate their missing 19-year-old daughter. What he discovers in both cases is painful for all parties, but particularly painful for Brodie. He makes  decisions that are costly for him but give the two young people a chance to move forward.

Direction is sharp, ambiance is enviable, no visible stinting on extras, cars, interiors. Dialog is sharp, the interplay among the characters is consistently amusing.  The characterizations are deep and complex in these police procedurals, as are their plots, although they often seem to be dependent upon an almost Victorian amount of coincidence. Yet they are suspenseful.  The Scottish settings are occasionally tourist-beautiful, as Brodie seems to do most of his running around Arthurs Seat or on the beach; but they are usually in gritty, little-seen corners of the countrys capital. However, if the question is, is this entertainment influenced by that Scottish school of mystery  writing  known as tartan noir, characterized by tougher, more violent contents than is usual, my answer would have to be no: I see no signs of it. But I found the series powerful, satisfying, surprising and gripping; involving in its emphasis on family relations, particularly those with/of daughters. And, as I recall the Atkinson book on which the TV treatments are based, CASE HISTORIES, which I was given as a birthday present upon its publication, I didn't like it. Though, oddly enough, I don't remember why not.  Nevertheless, this fine production is highly recommended.",1426550400,24,8078,5.017202692595363

These stories are complicated,beautifully acted and produced, gripping, charming and irresistible. Jason Isaacs is a perfect Jackson Brodie. Everyone else in the cast is great, too. Filmed in Scotland, damp, green and stony, American references where you least expect them, it is at once contemporary and timeless, jaded and romantic, tough and sensitive in the best sense and very human. Kate Atkinson is a great writer and her stories come full circle without a touch of contrivance.",1426464000,20,609,5.354166666666667
4716648,5,B005K8QIS0,"Not conventional PI crime series. 2 seasons, 2011 & 2013, now reissued as a complete collection. Edinburgh city and surroundings in all its beauty & magic. It is action, a touch of humor, and lots of drama surrounding the characters. Focus is both individual's lives and solving complicated cases. It is multiple cases, family issues, and Brodie's bed-life, ending intertwined. Some threads carry over episodes. Fast pace. I'd call it PG-13 by today's standards.

Jason Isaacs is Brodie, ex-cop now PI, domestically a train wreck. Regulars: DC Louise Munroe (Amanda Abbington -`Mr Salfridge) is bubbly and smart; Zawe Ashton as Deborah, gorgeous, witty, capable office everything for Brodie. Millie Innes is Brodie's wee daughter and steals many scenes. ex-wife Josie by Kirsty Mitchell ('Monarch of the Glen')

SDH SUBTITLES provided for features and bonus stuff.
Season 1 has 2-hour episodes; season 2 episodes are 90 min. Episode titles are adapted titles by novelist Kate Atkinson.
S1-1/2--- Case Histories, Part 1&2 ---Divorced ex-cop accepts 2 PI jobs. Amelia and Julia (Natasha Little) Land want to find a young sister lost 30 years past. Theo Wynne (Philip Davis -`Bleak House') has him investigate his teen girl's (Rose Leslie -`Downton Abbey') death, assisted by real cop Louise. Also see Mark Prendergast (`Outlander'). Brodie solves a case as a bar liaison, Shirley, wants him to find her sister's daughter Tanya.

S1-3/4---One Good Turn, Part 1&2 ---Brodie investigates the body he failed to save that floated to the sea. Cops were bogged in red tape. Novelist Martin Canning (Adam Godley) accompanies a hospital discharged victim home after a road rage attack during which Canning saved his life. A surprise is found. Mrs Hatter learns of husband Graham's heart attack caused by a dominatrix session. The road rager (Brian McCardie -`Lillies') rages on with attacks on Brodie and the novelist. Is Hatter's cleaning business trafficking? Little Marlee runs away. See Richard Mote, formerly Sheriff of Nottingham in `Robin Hood.'

S1-5/6---When Will There Be Good News? Part 1&2 ---Brodie tries to locate Dr Joann Hunter & baby for Reggie, child nanny and the kid who saved Brodie after a train wreck. The Dr's husband (Tom Goodman-Hill -`Mr Selfridge') is clueless. Individual histories play a big part. Reggie's life unravels. The train wreck walkaway and ex-con, Andrew Jones, may have answers to a case. Marlee Skypes her dad from across the world. My favorite episode.

S2-1---Started Early, Took My Dog ---Adopted Aussie lady (Emma Hamilton -`Tudors') gets Brodie's help finding her Edinburgh parent roots. A 1/3 century old secret hinders progress as does Brodie's tag-along dog. Answers found but decisions to be made. Tracy Waterhouse (Victoria Wood) is a mall security guard with a child issue.

S2-2---Nobody's Darling ---Brodie looks into a cheating finance at the bride-to-be's (Michelle Duncan) request simultaneously as another person has him checking about possible murder. Same man? Daughter Marlee moves in with Brodie. Domestic complexity, since he sleeps with Charlotte (Dawn Steele -`Lexie of Monarch of the Glen'.) She appears in the next episode too.

S2-3---Jackson and the Women ---This episode, like the previous, isn't from Atkinson books but based on characters of the books. A teen's mother murdered on a past Christmas Eve is investigated at the same time as the case of a family's missing teenager. The latter is tied to Brodie's past. Deborah quits. Brodie bumps into ex-girlfriend Julia, a client from the 1st story, who's displaying a bump, BUT Brodie's still sharing sheets with Charlotte. Agh, Brodie's women!

Fast suspense, and a bargain since it is like buying 6 full-length movies in one box set.",1425600000,29,3748,5.276845637583893

I'm not well-versed in the mystery genre in general, so I'm not quite sure who I would recommend it to--everyone, I guess.  It felt mainstream enough to me.

While the attraction for me (not unlike the Inspector Rebus DVDs) was the fact it is filmed in beautiful Edinburgh, Scotland, so I get to see tantalising shots of the city I love, this is one of the very best detective-type shows out there. With his office on Victoria Street in Edinburgh's Old Town (an architecturally alluring area), detective Brodie proves to be a quiet tough guy. And because this is a British show, there are no guns, so the story, the acting and the filming take on a greater role. And they do not disappoint, with Isaacs and his supporting staff (his PA is great) reminding us yet again that British actors really are among the best. Indeed, the quality of these shows is more of movie calibre.
The only thing that bothers me with this package is the title: The Complete Collection. (I have the two separate series releases.) What does 'complete' constitute? Series One and Two? More than that? I know of (and have) only the two series, so that is my assumption. Both series now together on NTSC format for the folks in No. America. The failure to indicate this in the descriptive notes on this page is also disappointing. Still, those following the show on TV might have a better sense of what constitutes 'complete'.
All in all, 'Case Histories' is a very worthwhile viewing. We were totally unaware of it being on TV. And showing it to friends in Canada, they loved it. And like me, those bits of Edinburgh they see make this show that much more enjoyable.",1421712000,109,1513,4.586715867158672
4716658,5,B005K8QIS0,"No way--only two seasons? You are killing me. I really love this series and there style. j. Isaacs is perfect in this role as a PI, as a father, as someone  trying to survive life and cope with his past. Funny and elegant show. As an added benefit, I get to learn across the pond English. BTW: I am a Sipowitz, McNutty, and Swigen fan and this show works for me. One more thing I like is that he is a busy PI. He has to juggle several cases at once giving it a more authentic feel. Superb side characters from his assistant to his daughter or the tough police chief--nice to see strong female roles as well.",1421625600,3,607,4.1440677966101696
4716659,3,B005K8QIS0,"I had high expectations for this series but was disappointed. If you haven't already read the novels by Kate Atkinson, the plots are hard to follow. And if you are Kate Atkinson fan, you'll miss the character development that makes her books so intriguing. Jason Isaacs is a wonderful actor, but I recommend watching the Showtime series, Brotherhood, to see him at his best. If you are a fan of BBC and ITV crime and mystery series set in beautiful locations with well-developed stories, try Single-Handed, Vera, or Foyle's War.",1421452800,11,528,4.877777777777778

4716669,5,B005K8QIS0,"This is a great series which I really enjoyed seeing!  I've read the books and the videos are very close to the ""vibe"" in the books even though they understandably differ somewhat due to the change from the novels to television.  Jason Isaac is perfectly cast as Jackson and the child playing Marlee is totally enchanting.
  The 15 minute ""behind the scenes"" program is outstanding.  It really gives you a good insight into the the way the actors approached their roles, how Atkinson approaches her writing, a bit about Edinburgh itself, etc.  Quite excellent.  You might even want to watch it before seeing the films.
  Sometimes I find it difficult to understand the actors' accents in films from the UK.  The videos are sub-titled and this was a really good way to catch every word.  The subtitles are excellent; as near as I could tell, word for word to what was being spoken. We're used to watching films from Scandinavia so are used to subtitles and don't even notice them after a short while.  Speaking of mysteries from Scandinavia, if you like good crime shows, try ""Unit One"" a fantastic Danish series (available here on Amazon).

The stories are primarily focused on his self destructive behavior and so are just plain depressing.  The opportunity to have a very good series of programs was tossed aside to create a program wholly focused and the main characters inability to interact with others and sustain a relationship.  There is no shortage of dysfunctional folks around if I want to look at people who are working full time to fail.  Probably will not order another series if one is released.,1407888000,4,627,4.980769230769231

4716690,2,B005K8QIS0,"Yikes!  First we get beautiful Scotland, and a good James Bond look alike male lead, then we get some music that doesn't reinforce the idea of the series.  Then it's ladies night in old Edinburgh. We get: a female superintendent, a female police captain, an eccentric old woman, a murdered sister, two murdered daughters, a set of three screwed-up surviving daughters, and two more screwed-up sisters, two surviving daughters, an ex-wife. and a secretary (sane), plus cats and babies. There may have been more, but it doesn't come to me. Oh yes, the sane secretary is black; the screwed-up women and the evil men are all white. The plots come magically together, despite the threads being being relatively unconnected.

So, summing it all up, this is a chick flick -up set in beautiful surroundings, from the works of a  woman, as well as directed and produced by women. If you like Scotland, women-in-charge gender reversal, and more emotional overdrive than you get in Tosca, then this is for you.  It's must see if you like all three.  For myself, I'll buy a second episode because my lady is out of town.

Jason Isaacs is amazing in this series about a former police officer (and soldier but they don't talk much about that) and his over complicated mine.  He does seem to have more angst then most strong silent type heros.  And the amount of punishment he takes over and over again is certainly going to lead down the same path as a pro footballer.

4716698,5,B005K8QIS0,"When I received a review copy of the second season of this well-done crime/mystery series that was produced in 2011 by BBC Scotland (and affiliate of Englands BBC, but separate) I realized I had not seen the first season and its always best to start at the beginning, so I got this set of Season One. (Actually the package does not actually say first season as maybe the series hadnt been renewed at that time. It has been though.).  Ive not yet started watching the second volume but I can tell you that you really need to start at the beginning. There are continuing relationships that form in this set that will be essential to understand later volumes.

So Im a bit behind others in posting this review. As I post this there are already 92 reviews. But I want to make you aware that Amazon has a policy of grouping ALL reviews of ALL formats of a film or TV series together, whether it was in theaters, on TV, Streaming or on DVD or Bluray. So I always recommend that folks sort by Newest First and then look at both the date and the format that the customer is reviewing. This is of the physical two-disc DVD package.

It took a while for me to get into the stories but once I did, I was hooked. The Season consists of 3 stories based on a series of books by Kate Atkinson, with each story divided into two 59-minute episodes, with a cliffhanger at the end of the first part.  Each crime is solved within the two parts though there is a running mystery the central character (former cop  now a private detective  Jackson Brodie played by Jason Isaacs) and it will obviously continue into Series Two.

Ill let you read other reviews (but be aware of spoilers) for more on the content but will offer some suggestions for those in the US ordering this series:
1) There is an English Subtitles option on the DVD (added by Acorn Media). I recommend that you enable this feature  at least for episode one). There are quite a few Scottish words which will confuse you. Near the beginning Brodie is speaking French and shortly there after he is yelling the word Niamh!. As youll find out (not really a spoiler) that is the name of his younger sister. If you don't need the subtitles after that, just turn them off.
2) The series aired in the US on Masterpiece Mystery but in an EDITED version. Probably about 7 minutes or so. In addition to allowing for funding messages Im sure it was for some pretty graphic violence and sex (each of the three stories has a sex act in it  though no nudity) as well as language (the S-word).

Of the three stories  each of which has two crime stories running together  I really liked the third because of the character named Reggie, and actress playing her.

The DVD has one Bonus Feature  a behind the scenes featurette (15 minutes) with the cast as well as author Atkinson and the series Producer.  Its here that we learn that actor Issacs was familiar with the Brodie books because he recorded the audiobook versions of them years ago.

Now Im ready to move on to Season Two and will post my review there when I finish it.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

4716699,4,B005K8QIS0,"I'm a big fan of Kate Atkinson's Jackson Brodie mysteries and these shows do a good job of bringing them to life.  Of course the shows leave out some of Atkinson's complexity, but a lot of the emotional impact (part of what makes her work so special) remains.",1402358400,,259,4.395833333333333
4716700,4,B005K8QIS0,"In the Bruce Willis tradition of super hero average guys this dude gets beat up a lot. Then he just slaps a band-aid on it and rolls on along. He is a combination of low key tough guy and lost puppy dog that I often hate, but this one works. This series is just confusing enough to be a good watch once and to warrant another viewing if you care about what you missed the first time. There are always three stories woven in together in ways you don't realize until the end, which keeps the series from being formulaic.

The hero is the stereotypical failed family man, but the series spends just enough time on it to let you know without dragging you into it. I was surprised here and there when good and bad guys turned out to be bad and good guys and this series has strong male and female characters . It's violent, which I like. I love the settings they are as urban rugged as our hero and I don't really dig political murder plots, who cares, I like the smaller stories, the people like you and me at risk stories and thus far this series is all about that.",1401494400,11,1062,4.180487804878049

4716702,4,B005K8QIS0,"I am no fan of detective series since most in my opinion are just way to formulaic and dull. But this series is nothing like that! It's all about Jason Isaacs and his portrayal of the main character. Wounded, strong, isolated, funny, big-hearted, immature...he is such a master at sharing all these emotions. This character seems so driven by his past, and so determined to keep from repeating it; at the same time he's ill-equipped to deal with his own emotional meltdown. It's a seriously challenging role, but Jason Isaacs, one of the most underrated actors in many years, does it as easily as taking his next breath. Amazing. The other characters are also wonderful, and are equally arresting in their scenes. The craziness of some of the cases is still made so believable by the fine acting of everyone in the cast. I can't wait to see the next season.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the occasional but gratuitous sex scenes. I'm no prude, but nothing irritates me more than graphic sex (however brief) that does nothing to further the story line. Oh, I get it, Jason Isaacs is one of the sexiest men EVER, but I don't need a throwaway sex scene to confirm that. If you're watching this guy and don't feel some heat, please check yourself for a pulse.

Outstanding series, heartfelt relationships, (particularly with his daughter) Case Histories really has it all. I really could not stop watching it.",1395360000,9,1424,4.692

He is working as a private investigator who always seems to end up at the police station... usually asking for information from the one friend he has left there.

The stories are dark but the show is kept lighter by a wise-cracking secretary and an inquisitive daughter who likes to share with her mother the time spent with her father.  Lots of characters keep the story interesting.

I hope they make many more seasons of this show.",1394582400,,655,4.6521739130434785

The only reason I did not give 5 stars to this release is that the music that Brodie plays for himself has been replaced with songs in a similar vein. I was rather surprised by this, you'd think that in this day and age the producers would have nailed down the rights to the music as a matter of course.

4716726,5,B005K8QIS0,"This DVD contains six one-hour episodes that cover the first three books in Kate Atkinson's popular Jackson Brodie series. Jason Isaacs is perfectly cast as Jackson Brodie, Millie Innes is delightful as his daughter, Marlee, Amanda Abbington does a great DC Louise Munroe, Phillip Davis departs from his usual bad guy casting to play a lovely Theo Wyre, Sylvia Syms is marvellous as Binky Rain and Natasha Little plays an excellent Julia Land. The episodes based on Case Histories depart from that by being set in Edinburgh and introducing DC Munroe early, but apart from that, follows the book quite well and is very enjoyable. The next two episodes, based on One Good Turn, follow the general plot of the book but with some significant changes that involve Jackson more in events than in the book. Despite these departures, they are still very enjoyable. Brian McCardie plays the perfect villain, Terence Smith, in these two episodes, and Orla O'Rourke does a great Tatiana. The last two episodes are based on When Will There Be Good News. Gwyneth Keyworth plays a delightful Reggie Chase. Once again, there are significant departures from the book, but the bones of the plot are adhered to. There is more interaction between Munroe and Brodie, and it will be interesting to see how this plays out in series two, as Munroe is largely absent in the next book.

4716729,3,B005K8QIS0,"I am uncertain as to why this is rated as highly as it is, unless those that gave it five stars have not read Kate Atkinson's books, the source material.  Having recently discovered this author, I thoroughly enjoyed the first Jackson Brodie book, ""Case Histories"", and am about 2/3 through the second, ""One Good Turn"".

This had such great reviews, I almost bought it sight unseen, but was glad to have been able to borrow it from the local library for free.  What a good decision!  As the stories are so well written (four basic lines that are artfully interwoven), I was skeptical about it taking 6 hours to tell, but gave it a try.  First, there are six episodes, an hour +/- each.  The first episode had covered so much of the book, I wondered how it was going to take another five hours to finish.  It didn't.  The second episode was the completion of the first book, and the synopsis for Episode 3 revealed it was the beginning of the second book.  I turned it off and returned the DVD well before the due date.  I did not want to ruin a good book with the ""Cliff Notes"" show.

What a disappointment.  While all the major characters were in there, and all the story lines were touched upon, this two hour condensation of such a well crafted book was a shame.  I am 'old school' here, if a movie is based on a book, I will always read the book(s) first.  If the author is talented enough to create characters that I can get my head around, and envision, I don't want/need the distraction of the filmakers telling me what they should look or sound like for me.

No slur on Jason Isaacs, he is great in everything he does (alas, ""Awake"" lasted only one season), and he could have easily carried the role had it been written more closely to the book. I had not envisioned him as Jackson Brodie as I read, but casting him was acceptable--it wasn't as if he was so different than the JB of the page. Having read it first, I honestly cannot say whether folks would be able to follow the storylines, but I found myself mentally filling in a lot of gaps--I knew what was meant because I knew the whole back story.

One other comment on read vs. watch.  Atkinson is funny.  You have to pay attention as you  read, and have a passing knowledge of pop culture both of today and JB's youth, but there are times when I will laugh out loud as I read--and it takes a lot to make me do that!  I had no such moments as I watched the DVD.

So, if you are interested in this story because of the reviews, do yourself a HUGE favor--read the books first!",1376697600,,2538,4.278825995807128

In fact, I thought the intertwining of themes of lost girls--some who died far too young, and of family betrayals and secrets, and haunting memories to be beautifully done. Jason Issacs is a most attractive actor, a sort of the thinking person's action hero--intelligent, intense and here, a softie with a heart of gold.  The supporting actors were wonderful, particularly the young girl who plays his daughter so believably, as a real kid- so rare among child characters scripted by adults. Additionally, the Scottish locations were lovely and made for a nice change from gritty urban English or American sets.

In so many shows of this genre the lead character is irrationally despised and disrespected by the other characters--always misunderstood, always needing to fight all the harder. And that seems to be the case in this show as well, which is a tad irritating because I don't see that there is any reason that he would be so disliked by his former coworkers or anyone else. All that aside, by the time I got to the final show of the season I was searching for the next season--which does not seem to be available as of yet.

4716760,4,B005K8QIS0,"I was surprised by this fast paced drama. It drops you right in the middle of the story, takes off and keeps on moving. The action isn't wrapped up in a tidy bundle by the end of each episode. Some mysteries go for several episodes while others don't take long at all. In that respect it's more like real life. However, there is a bit of a McGyver tone to this. Nobody in real life could ever have this much drama, coincidence, knowledge or luck. The fun depends on that being the case though, so just suspend reality and hold on for the ride!

The story lines are touching. The viewer gets to see what motivates the main character and how he got where he is today. There are family and love elements that go along with the investigations that give it a bit of depth. The cast was well chosen. They did a good job- I especially loved the darling little girl/daughter! The scenery also captivated me as it is so different from what I am used to seeing.

Case Histories is a different kind of detective series that is worth a look... but do leave the subtitles on if you are watching from the USA. Some of the characters are completely unintelligible.",1340582400,,1149,4.364485981308412

The scenery in Scotland is visually stunning. Inspired casting choices, original and intriguing plots, upbeat music, charming cinematography with great shots, and fun and fanciful dialogue make this a treat to watch. Based on books by Kate Atkinson who often has a streak of magical realism in her stories, this series has a bit of that, too. I found it added to the charm, and didn't detract, if you're not looking for a lot of realism in the the mystery.

Plot lines intertwine and keep you interested, but beware, Brodie jumps around in his sleuthing. I enjoy the variety and eccentric characters and situations that keep coming at you.

Because of the humor, it keeps the stories from being too grim. It's fairly light-hearted although deals with serious crimes. Somehow the interest is finding out how Brodie, the underdog, is going to help the down and out with his limited and overtaxed resources. That's the challenge.

You may want to read the books by Atkinson after seeing this series. I found it captured the flavor of the book. Hope more shows are produced for it.",1335830400,,1212,4.87378640776699

Jason Isaacs as Jackson is a wonderful choice.
An understated reluctant hero, kept in check by his secretary and his ex wife and young daughter (excellently portrayed by Millie Innes), Private Investigator Jackson stumbles from one crime scene to another. It never seems his intention to get involved, and indeed he often tells potential clients there is nothing to be done, but always the clients persist, and Jackson, soft hearted and vulnerable to others heartache, is drawn in.
I think the series works so well because the stories are good and once we have been introduced to the characters, we have a real desire to learn more about them, and to see where the screenwriters will take them next.
Obviously (as with all adaptations) there are some changes from the books, but overall the differences work well and I can see why they were made.

4716766,4,B005K8QIS0,"""Case Histories,"" a television series of British mysteries/police procedurals, is based on the popular novels by Kate Atkinson.  It was made by BBC Scotland, which intelligently moved the action from Yorkshire, where Atkinson had set it, to Edinburgh, Scotland; a more beautiful and interesting place.  In the U.K., this series was aired in twin one hour episodes on consecutive nights. This resulted in two episodes each of three single dramas, each crime drama based upon one particular Atkinson book that run approximately one hour 55 minutes each. Each drama has a mini-climax at the end of the first part, as well as at the end of the story arc.  And, thank goodness, for most of us not so conversant with Scottish dialog and usage, Acorn Media, the American releasing company, has kindly given us subtitles.

Our detective here is Jackson Brodie (Golden Globe nominee Jason Isaacs,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-State-Within/dp/B000KF0DVQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The State Within</a>, who was a soldier in the British army, then an officer in the Lothian and Borders Police, an entity that will ring bells to any enthusiasts of Ian Rankin's Rebus novels, and TV series, as indeed, will Edinburgh itself.  However, the indefatigable detective has left the police for various reasons unspecified in the TV treatment, and turned private investigator.  His tough exterior hides the famous heart of gold, and he finds himself compelled to try to help all comers, looking into everything from lost cats and lost girls - many lost girls --to wayward spouses and killers on the run. He also does a lot of running himself, partly to unwind from the stresses of his work, but seemingly mostly to brood upon his own traumatic past.

In the U.S., this series was recently seen on Masterpiece Mystery.  This ""more than successful adaptation"" (The Guardian, U.K.) of Atkinson's award-winning novels also stars Amanda Abbington, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/After-You-ve-Gone-Series-One/dp/B002PNU13G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">After You've Gone - Series One</a>); Natasha Little,(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Another-Life/dp/B001FBPSWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Another Life</a>); Phil Davis, (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vera-Drake/dp/B0007P0YKY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vera Drake</a>); Sylvia Simms,(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alice-s-Restaurant/dp/B000053VAR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alice's Restaurant</a>), and Keith Allen (ROBIN HOOD).

It is a character-driven drama boasting an outstanding lead performance by Isaacs, who apparently was born to play brooding, handsome heroes.  And it's all set against the ruggedly beautiful Scottish scenery.

Episode 1 is based upon&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Case-Histories-A-Novel/dp/0316033480/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Case Histories: A Novel</a>&nbsp;and boasts three subplots.  As Brodie searches for one of the cats of his crotchety client Binky Rain (Sylvia Simms), he stumbles across the 30-year old mystery of a little girl who disappeared from the house next door. The girl's sisters, Julia (Natasha Little) and Amelia Land have found their little sister's stuffed toy, Blue Mouse, while going through their deceased father's things, where it ought not to be. A distraught Theo Wyre (Phil Davis) barges into Brodie's office to beg him to look into the murder of his daughter Laura, as he doesn't have confidence in the police investigation. And a manipulative nurse, Shirley Manning, wants him to find the niece who was put into foster care years ago.

Episode 2, based upon<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/One-Good-Turn-A-Novel/dp/0316012823/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">One Good Turn: A Novel</a>, finds Brodie, while out for one of his jogs, discovering the body of a young woman floating in the ocean.  As he tries to establish her identity, he traces her to a Russian-owned and staffed maid service where the staff are afraid to speak to him. Meanwhile, Brodie witnesses a man brutally beaten in a multi-story  parking lot, in an apparent episode of road rage that has morphed into a mugging. Fortunately, a bystander, mystery writer Martin Canning tosses his laptop at the assailant, probably saving the victim's life. But the cowardly mystery writer fears retaliation and insists that Brodie must protect him. And Gloria Hatter's captain of industry husband has just had a heart attack while glorying in the company of his Russian immigrant dominatrix Tatiana. As the master of the universe lays dying unconscious in a hospital bed, his wife finds  that their company Hatter Homes is under investigation, as are her husband's other holdings, and an employee of his, Terence Smith might well be up to no good. Just by coincidence, the three cases turn out to be one.

Gary Moore, nervous and possessive husband, has hired the detective to follow his wife Michelle. Just by coincidence, again, as Brodie walks home from the job, he sees an elderly woman whose car has stalled on the tracks of a speeding train.  Brodie tries to pull her out of the car, but is struck himself.  He is saved and revived by a young woman, Reggie Teague, who had been studying with the retired schoolteacher.  When Brodie limps out of the hospital, he finds that Moore won't stop pestering his secretary for news of the infidelity case; also that his wallet and phone have been stolen and replaced with somebody else's, and that the young woman Reggie, who saved his life,  thinks Brodie now owes her a favor.  Dr. Joanna Hunter, for whom Reggie works as a nanny, has gone missing with her baby girl. Husband Neil claims that Dr. Hunter is visiting relatives, but Reggie knows that she has none to visit.

It's an enjoyable and involving entertainment whose star is definitely easy on the eyes.  The acting is quite good, and, as indicated above, features many veteran, well-known British supporting players.  Dialog is fine and the interplay among the characters is consistently amusing.  Thanks to the subtitles, all is accessible to the viewer.  Direction is sharp, the ambiance is enviable, and there's been no visible stinting on extras, cars, interiors.  However, if the question is, is this series influenced by that Scottish school of mystery writers writing what's known as tartan noir, with tougher,more violent contents than is usual, my answer would have to be no.  I see no signs of it.  In the U.K., this series was aired in twin one hour episodes on consecutive nights. This resulted in two episodes each of three single dramas, each Direction is sharp, the ambiance is One major quibble: the plots are all almost Victorian in their reliance on coincidence: think those Thomas Hardy novels we were required to read in school. Odd, recently I received a hardcover copy of CASE HISTORIES as a gift, and wasn't that crazy about it.  Seems I prefer the TV series.

The main guy, Jackson Brodie, is played by Jason Isaacs, the actor who also did the smarmy, hideously good-looking and house-elf kicking Lucius Malfoy in the Harry Potter series. Isaacs' acting is so good in ""Case HIstories"" that at first I had trouble identifying him. (It wasn't just that he wasn't wearing Malfoy's Prince Valiant blonde wig. He is one of the finest actors of the 21st century; he is the roles he plays.)

Could ""Case Histories"" improve in any way? Yes, very occasionally the script meanders a bit. I would shorten it. But, even with this criticism, It's a superb series, and I'm glad I bought it.

4716771,4,B005K8QIS0,"I originally saw this on Masterpiece Mystery and really enjoyed it.  I particularly liked the converging plot lines and the inspired casting.  After ordering the DVD set and watching the six episodes (the original Brit series was shot as a six part 1 hour TV series, but shown on PBS as two edited 2 hour episodes) my opinion was reinforced with the observation that the major ingredients of a successful series had been met.  If it was intended just to be a one off cinema production I would have given it 5 stars.  However, if viewed as a longer term series it has some problems.

I can't think of one Brit crime series that has gone on to achieve broad popularity that doesn't have the lead protagonist ensconced in a structured environment or ""family"".  Morse, Lewis, Barnaby, Foyle, Rebus and Frost all had a support system where they could play against their ""intellectually inferior"" co-workers or rail against the constraints of their organization.  Sherlock had the same in his Watson and Poirot had his ""posse"" of hanger-ons.  American crime shows are even more locked into this formulae; just witness NYPD Blue, Law & Order, The Closer, etc.  If you go back in time to where televised ""Private Eye"" fiction was more the norm that it is today even the self employed P.I. had his stable screen family to keep him grounded or, at the very least, dealing with conflict issues that added to the character and subplot of these serialized scripts (Rockford/Magnum).  However, those PI feature length films that starred the lone wolf rarely made the grade. Witness the great literary detectives of the 50's and 60's, Lew Harper and Travis McGee.  While the books were serial best sellers for the authors (Ross MacDonald & John D. MacDonald) the movies were mediocre at best.  What's good on the written page doesn't always successfully transcend to television or the movie theatre.

That said, the Brodie character is hanging out there pretty much by himself and I'm not sure that a long distance daughter and ex wife, plus a love hate relationship with his former boss is going to cut it.  They need to come up with a buddy, a stable but competing love interest, or some other friction inducing device and then establish a more fixed narrative as to how he has landed where he has in order to sustain this as a series in the future.  A Tony Horowitz penned prequel that goes beyond the constraints of the Kate Atkinson novels might be just the ticket.  If this is to be an ongoing series I hope year 2  will tell us more about Jackson's past and thereby insure his future.  If they can bridge that divide the series has the makings of a first class production.

And just an aside regarding Jason Isaacs portrayal as Jackson Brodie; how inept does the James Bond franchise look for not wrapping this guy up as the next 007?  He's the first actor since Sean Connery that could wear the role like Savile Row suit and add another decade to a flagging series.",1325203200,27,2958,4.66281310211946

The series ""Case Histories"" is splendid.  With wonderful writing, direction and fabulous acting, I love this series.  Jason Isaacs is really tremendous as the ""super jock""(but still puffs away on his cigarettes), tough guy ""with a heart""  and very randy, private investigator, Jackson Brodie that cases seem to find him or he seems always to ""find"" really horrendous cases while investigating some rather mundane things (i.e., a lost cat, wife cheating on husband, etc. ) or he himself having terrible experiences such as being run over by a train. I enjoyed all of the characters in this series--the acting by all is tremendous (I especially adored Brodie's sassy and insubordinate secretary/receptionist)

4716777,5,B005K8QIS0,"These mysteries explore survival, how we hold ourselves together despite terrible circumstances. The lead character is haunted by the death of his sister, many years ago. Jason Isaacs, of Lord Malfoy fame in Harry Potter, is superb as Jackson Brodie. Edinburgh, Scotland, is another rich character in this collection of three mysteries, based on Kay Atkinson's books. Isaacs is pitch-perfect, every nuance evoked with subtley. You totally believe his character. The young Millie Innes, who plays Jason Brodie's daughter, is a rare talent. Much is explored about the depth of love between Brodie and his daughter. The last mystery is excellent, with Gwyneth Keyworth as an articulate, remarkable teenage girl with secrets of her own. Keyworth deserves a long career in British film and TV. All three mysteries delve into how past and present merge, how one copes with traumatic memories. The stories have rich narrative landscape and first-class acting. The stormy acting of Brian McCardie (the only bright spot in the last ""Murphy's Law"") is another treat. The short interviews with the actors (especially Isaacs), the writer, and producer are worth watching as well, for their articulate intelligence.

Thanks to a kind comment on another of my reviews, I tracked down this mysterious offering, as it didn't arise under a search for ""Scottish mystery"" in DVDs.

4716779,4,B005K8QIS0,"""Blue mouse"" won me over right away - what a visually captivating show with so many strong, consistently interesting characters.
From the sisters to the man who cannot accept no for an answer in the death of his precious daughter, to the writer suddenly confronted with reality around him and his own secret.
There is no Agatha Christie here or complex plots and yes, they are a bit convenient but so much can be in the telling of a tale, as in it's outcome and this is where Jackson Brody glows. Unusually for these shows, the victims are far more captivating, compelling and in focus than are the ""villans.""

I will say they are wearing out Mary Gauthier a bit - I enjoy her music but in every episode over and over? It's getting a bit weird and tiresome.
And Mr. Brody finds more reasons to remove his shirt during a day than I do in a week but maybe I would too were I so fit. Even so...
Otherwise this is a beautifully filmed series you can relax watching and just enjoy where it takes you.

4716780,5,B005K8QIS0,"Case Histories, a British mini-series, just wrapped up on ""Masterpiece Mystery"" on television.  This new adaptation of Kate Atkinson's work, starring Jason Isaacs as private detective Jackson Brodie, is excellent.  I've read all four of Atkinson's Brodie novels and really enjoyed them, so I was fairly excited to see this program and wondered if they'd do a good job.  Didn't have to worry.

As one reviewer noted, any TV show that has the smarts to cast the underrated and underused Isaacs is worth checking out; this one also has good writing and great casting of all the other actors going for it too.  I thought the writers did an excellent job of paring down Atkinson's novels for television - cutting out unnecessary plot lines and characters to streamline the story and make it work quite well, at least for me.  I watched the show with my husband, who hasn't read the books, and he felt everything made sense and really enjoyed the program.  I remember while I read the books that there were parts I felt were unneeded, which are the same parts the writers took out.

The main thrust of the story is that Brodie, ex-military and police officer, now private detective, gets involved in various investigations, some of which are connected.  Each episode has 3 cases in it.  As some reviewers have commented, there is a certain amount of coincidence in the cases being connected, but this may not bother some people (it doesn't bother me that much).  And some of the changes in the plot lines from book to TV show were necessary for clarity and time concerns, so an incident that seems more random in the book is a bit manipulated on TV.  There are also a couple of major plot lines that are completely missing from the TV version, but their exclusion is necessary to create a simpler and clearer story.

What's great about the series is the acting - from the main characters to the minor ones.  Brodie's assistant Deborah and his daughter Marlee are especially memorable, as is Reggie from the third installment.  Isaacs is perfect as Brodie, capturing both the hard-boiled detective and the loving father with equal ease.  It's nice to see him playing a real person, rather than a plot-catalyst bad guy or bad-guy sidekick.

Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys quality drama for grownups; be aware there's some cussing and a little sex here and there.",1320624000,12,2363,4.766584766584766
4716781,5,B005K8QIS0,"I am an avid watcher of Masterpiece Mystery! as are many of the other reviewers.  I won't recap the story, as it's already been told here in the reviews--but for someone who hasn't been anywhere, I loved (what I think is) the authentic sort of brogue, and I wouldn't have wanted this story Americanized and slick and edited and remastered to death;  I liked that characters LOOKED cold while they were outside, and had hair that LOOKED like they'd been rained on!

I can't stress enough how much Jason Isaacs really blew me away, and the casting really was superb.  When an actor can convey so much without a lick of dialogue or narration, well, it's a good thing indeed.  This program enthralled me and I'm looking forward to reading the book now.  I can't agree with the idea that this DVD is lacking in some way.  Any time I can watch a program and forget that I'm watching actors altogether, well I can't think it gets better than that.  I'm sorry that some folks didn't fully embrace this DVD.  I would very much like to give this to several people I know.  And to the person who thought the assistant was the only one who was funny:  there are many amusing instances in Case Histories, so you definitely missed out.",1320451200,6,1221,4.479638009049774
4716782,5,B005K8QIS0,"Apparently Jason Isaacs (&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-Potter-The-Complete-Collection-Years-1-7/dp/B005OCFGTO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry Potter: The Complete Collection Years 1-7</a>) had already recorded the audio books of Kate Atkinson's mystery novels ""Case Histories"",""One Good Turn"", and ""When Will There Be Good News?"" when he was tapped to star in the BBC series. Obviously portraying all the characters in the book gave him an intimate knowledge of his character and it shows in his delicately nuanced portrayal of tough former soldier and policeman turned private investigator Jackson Brodie.  Although he is catnip to the ladies, nonetheless Jackson is haunted by a past family tragedy, and struggles with varied degrees of success to balance his personal and professional life.

The three episodes deal with variations of the same theme of him coming to the rescue of the bereaved, the lost and the dysfunctional residents of Edinburgh, Scotland.  Thie series is shot on location, and has a great supporting cast of both veterans and new faces. The haunting soundtrack features Iris Dement, Robert Plant & Allison Kraus, Mary Gauthier, Lucinda Williams and Nanci Guthier among others. This series has subject matter that is rather explicit in nature and several scenes which require the very fit Isaacs to be bare chested so if you have young ones it may require parental guidance.

4716783,4,B005K8QIS0,"""Case Histories"" is based on the novels of Kate Atkinson featuring Scottish private detective Jackson Brodie (Jason Isaacs), former soldier, formerly of the Edinburgh police force. Jackson Brodie is a brooding fellow, haunted by the death of his sister Eve when they were children, divorced, but close to his 8-year-old daughter Marlee (Millie Innes). Marlee is the bright light in this series in contrast to the cloudy Scottish skies and neurotic characters. She's bright and forthright, played by one of the most appealing child actors I've seen. Jackson is served and harassed by his critical, blunt-talking secretary Deborah (Zawe Ashton). He often turns to his former partner on the police force, DC Louise Munroe (Amanda Abbington), for help with his cases. She begrudgingly complies, as she genuinely respects Jackson but has a limited tolerance for his emotional baggage.

This series is entertaining, and it's nice for American audiences to see a detective show based in Scotland rather than England. Each episode is two hours long and contains multiple mysteries, though the author tends to strain credibility by often having the disparate mysteries turn out to be somehow intertwined. My one criticism in the character writing is that Jackson Brodie is so neurotic that he's goofy. He is always tying himself up in knots about the distant past or some emotional upheaval. Good grief. The flashbacks to the death of Jackson's sister are repetitive and annoying. Really, people get past these things. It's no surprise that the less neurotic characters -daughter Marlee, DC Munroe, secretary Deborah- beg to be seen more. Jackson does have a biting, sardonic sense of humor when he dares show it, though.

The three films are based on the novels ""Case Histories"", ""One Good Turn"", and ""When Will There Be Good News?"", in that order. They are simply called episodes 1, 2, and 3, however. The weakest and least plausible is episode 2. These are the films:

Episode 1 introduces us to ex-police officer, now private investigator Jackson Brodie, who became a crime fighter on account of the death of his sister when he was a boy. While searching for the cat of his crotchety client Binky Rain (Sylvia Simms), he stumbles across the mystery of a little girl who disappeared from the house next door 30 years ago. The girl's sisters, Julia (Natasha Little) and Amelia Land (Fenella Woolgar) have found their sister's stuffed animal when going through their deceased father's things. They think Brodie is the man to find out what happened. A distraught Mr. Theo Wyre (Phil Davis) barges into Brodie's office to beg him to look into the murder of his daughter Laura (Rose Leslie), as he doesn't have confidence in the police investigation. And a manipulative Shirley Manning (Shauna MacDonald) wants him to find her niece who was put into foster care years ago.

Episode 2 finds Brodie out for a jog, when he discovers the body of a young woman floating in the water. Looking for clues to her identity, he traces her to a maid service where the staff are afraid to speak to him. In the meantime, he has witnessed a man viciously beaten in an apparent mugging. A bystander, mystery writer Martin Canning (Adam Godley), saves the day by tossing his laptop at the assailant. But he fears retaliation and insists on hiring Brodie to protect him. Gloria Hatter's (Marion Bailey) husband has just had a heart attack while in the company of his dominatrix Tatiana (Orla O'Rourke). As he lay unconscious in a hospital bed, Marion discovers that their company Hatter Homes is under investigation, and an employee, Terence Smith (Brian McCardie) might be up to no good. Coincidentally, the three storylines turn out to be one.

Episode 3 begins while Brodie is working on an adultery case. Gary Moore (Neil McInven), a nervous and possessive husband, has hired the detective to follow his wife Michelle (Morven Christie). Walking home from the job, Brodie tries to pull an elderly woman out of a car that is in the path of a speeding train, but he is struck himself. Revived by a young woman named Reggie Teague (Gwyneth Keyworh), Brodie limps out of the hospital to find that Moore won't stop pestering his secretary for news of the case, his wallet and phone have been stolen and replaced with Andrew Jones' ID, and Reggie thinks Brodie owes her a favor: Dr. Joanna Hunter (Neve McIntosh), for whom Reggie worked as a nanny, has gone missing with her baby.
