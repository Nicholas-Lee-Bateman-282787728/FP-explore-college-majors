Having visited Kilauea several times within the last decade or two; having personally seen places that the lava has covered over to a quite substantial depth, that I had once walked on, makes an impression.  Seeing the on going flows of lava, the amount of area covered by the lava, is quite impressive.
Now seeing that the small crater within the main crater of Kilauea active, makes me want to return, just to see that event happening.
O.K.  Volcanoes impress me. I think they're awesome!
The night and aerial images of the lava flows, and their entry into the sea is always one of my favorite things.",1373846400,,623,4.654545454545454
