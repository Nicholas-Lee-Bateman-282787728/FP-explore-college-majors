There are various interviews from well known Rabbis; but they discussed the meaning of life and do you believe in God? I don't believe the word Kabbalah was ever mentioned though they did mention the Zohar. I got nothing from this video and was very disappointed.,",1313884800,10,431,4.538461538461538
