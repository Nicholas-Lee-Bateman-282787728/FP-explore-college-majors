1200540,5,B00000F0HQ,"The ""Light at the Edge of the World"" is a haunting film which plums the darker and heroic sides of human nature. Set on a desolate island, which has a lighthouse, the lonely serenity of those who work there is shattered when a pirate ship arrives.
The movie presents evil personified in the character of the pirate captain, marvelously performed by Yul Brynner. ""Little chattering man "" - a line delivered by Brynner  - sends chills each time I watch the movie. What a remarkable moment of acting.
Counter posing the pirates is Kirk Douglas, the assistant lighthouse keeper, who struggles with staying alive while dealing with the haunted past which has brought him to this lonely confrontation, literally at the edge of the world.
The movie works on many emotional and ethical levels: evil, honor, friendship, love, betrayal, and isolation are all played out beneath the beams of the lighthouse, which casts its weak light into the symbolic darkness that permeates this well-crafted film.
If you want a movie that will challenge you to think and force you to feel, this hauntingly beautiful, and yet terrifying film, is a must. I think it is a remarkable film, and I recommend it for adults. You won't forget it, and you will watch it again. Oh, the music score is marvelous and sets the many moods of the film perfectly.",1188259200,5,1322,4.77292576419214

But i think a lot of adults who like an adventure with a great setting and excellent acting by the likes of Yul Brynner, Kirk Douglas,and Samantha Eggar will love this DVD.Its A little pricy but it does contain a fairly decent transfer to DVD with no apparent age defects,blemishes etc. And has quite a clear crisp picture on DVD.However there are no sepcial features. But highly entertaining and colourful nonetheless. With great performances. A worthwhile view, and for fans of Yul and Kirk. A gem for your DVD collection.

1200556,3,B00000F0HQ,"Most Jules Verne books are rather innocent, but this film adaptation of his Le Phare du Bout du Monde (1905) is dark and vicious, with a man being flayed alive on a hook. Thus it ventures from an extraordinary voyage to a horror film. And a horror film is what I would call it, on the survivalist sub-genre aspect. I found it disconcerting to watch, and would not recommend for those looking for something like In Search of the Castaways. I must admit I have not read the novel, but I do know that Verne's later fiction was darker and more cynical than his earlier, more famous books. This is evidently one of his last books and based on the film, a horror tale of survival.",1393200000,,674,4.357142857142857

The NTSC version released by Image entertainment is out of print and only sold by 3rd party Amazon sellers for ridiculous prices (New condition from $60 plus dollars and used from $46 dollars on up.)

1200562,3,B00000F0HQ,"This little known film very certainly surprised me, freaked me out a lot - and I also found it rather depressing. Before reading further, please be advised that this review contains limited SPOILERS.

""The light at the edge of the world"", made in 1971, is an adaptation of the novel ""Le phare du bout du monde"" written by Jules Verne. This eminent French author wrote it in 1901, but the book was published only in 1905, a couple of months after Verne died. Being amongst the last Verne's works, it is somehow different, darker and more violent than his earlier, more famous novels like ""Around the world in 80 days"", ""20.000 leagues under the seas"" or ""Mysterious island"".

The story happens in 1865 and its center is a lighthouse situated on a small desolate island somewhere in the southern end of South America (Argentina or Chili). A band of pirates under the command of a mysterious Jonathan Kongre takes the control of the lighthouse and murders two of the keepers. The pirates want to lure passing ships towards the rocks with a false light, when keeping the lighthouse out of service. But the third keeper, Denton, is still alive and hiding on the island - and he will try his best to stop the pirates.

In the film Jonathan Kongre, pirate leader, is played by Yul Brynner, when the character of Vasquez is played by Kirk Douglas. The famous Spanish actor Fernando Rey appears briefly as the head keeper of the lighthouse, Captain Moriz - but his screen time is very limited... Belgian actor Jean-Claude Drouot, who much earlier became famous in continental Europe by playing ""Thierry La Fronde"" (a kind of French Robin Hood) in very popular French TV series plays here the character of Virgilio, who is Kongre's right hand. Finally, Samantha Eggar plays the role of Arabella, a young woman kept prisoner by the pirates.

The novel itself was quite violent and dark, but this adapation is very, very different from Verne's initial text as it was deliberately ""hardened"". Murders are very graphic and there were new elements added by the director: a gang rape, a scene in which a man is being skinned alive and a moment of very graphic animal cruelty. They all made this film really hard to watch by moments.

But the most peculiar is the presentation of the pirates themselves - and they are very different from what Jules Verne described. Captain Jonathan Kongre, a former slave merchant is not only a twisted, sadistic megalomaniac, but he is also a bisexual pedophile, keeping a young black boy as his slave/lover. And he is also insane. First mate Virgilio is a cross-dresser and it is suggested that he is also homosexual, popular amongst the rest of the crew... He paradoxally seems also to have something against the women in general, because he certainly viscerally HATES the only girl present in the story! He almost never talks and he seems to be barking mad (even worse than his captain)! Both he and captain Kongre also seem to enjoy wearing woman's jewelry...

The rest of pirates are a bizarre bunch, with many being South American Indians but dressed like Apache warriors and the rest being mostly Latinos and one guy very Scandinavian looking. They have very few firearms - in fact, if some have cutlasses, most of them have medieval looking halberds, spears, and also axes and swords which seem to come straight from ""Lord of the Rings""... Virgilio himself wears a samurai sword (in 1865!). They have cannons on their ship, but other than that only the captain and a couple of others seem to have revolvers or pistols. Also their clothes seem to be deliberately a mixture of all kind of styles and fashions - some (furs and skins) seem coming more from Iron Age Europe, than anything worn in XIX century... Last but not least, they seem to belong to a kind of weird cult, wearing on solemn occasions some occultist black mantles, chanting weird prayers - and burning their fallen comrades on pyres, like heathens in Ancient Times.

The character of Arabella didn't exist in the book and it seems she was added to the film just to allow the director to put some sexual sadistic accents to the film. The whole story is rather nihilistic as it seems to have no point - it shows a lot of weirdness and violence just to show weirdness and violence. And this film, at least for my personal taste, was really, but really depressing!

But I still give it three stars, because of the excellent actors (Douglas, Brynner, Eggar, Drouot), of the unique atmosphere (a desolate island which seems really to be at the end of the world) and the great effort made by the director to create a kind of disturbing surrealistic painting on screen. I am not certain that you can enjoy this film, but it certainly is something you do not see every day. Weird, freaky, creepy, violent, perverted, depressing - but certainly quite unique...",1339977600,3,4841,4.720710059171598

1200564,5,B00000F0HQ,"I saw this once years ago on TV and I never forgot it. I'm looking for the DVD now and it's hard to find. This is one of those movies that divides people--you love it or you hate it. Those who hate it often mention how boring it is. Yep, no car chases or sex scenes to speak of. No lasers zapping anybody. And mention Jules Verne and people think ""kids movie."" But what kind of action do you expect on a deserted island off the coast of South America? And this is anything but a kids movie. There is some physical action, but most of the action is spiritual and psychological and boy, is there plenty of that. It really made me think, and feel, back then. The Kirk Douglas character could not forget his lost love. I had a girlfriend who swore she loved me and that she was mine forever who dumped me without a word of explanation. I felt like him, and I've got to see this again. As one reviewer said, it is ""haunting.""",1268524800,5,920,4.145251396648045

In this role he portrays a truly evil character, and it is not amusing.  This is a movie for people who are willing to sit through a mediocre plot with dull dialogue to see a woman degraded and raped by a brutal horde of animal-like men.

Sorry, still didn't like it.  A very dark film (attitude) violent, sadistic, gang rape, flaying alive and way too long.  It had the look and feel of a B movie.  Plot is simple and did not need to be so long.  Plenty of vicious murdering of innocent people and animals.  Douglas plays one of three lighthouse keepers on a small island off the point of South America.  The other two are killed quickly and viciously at the hands of a ship load of wreckers who put the light out so they can get ships to crash on the rocks.
