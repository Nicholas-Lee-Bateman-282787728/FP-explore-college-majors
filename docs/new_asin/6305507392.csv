I got most of the series on dvd from tvdvdconfidential.com!
The pilot is almost perfect quality. The other episodes are
good quality taped from tv reruns. If you are like me and
like vhs quality then you should order from tvdvd. I think
$20 or more for vhs with 2 episodes is too much.",1313280000,,344,4.2272727272727275
