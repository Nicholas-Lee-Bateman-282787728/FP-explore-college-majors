8545381,4,B009YQJ2ZU,"I am a big fan of horror movies, and this one was good enough to buy it, after watching it through an online service.

It is subtle in some areas, where horror fans KNOW something is about to happen, because everything seems ""normal."" and it has some nice twists in the story line.

There are plot holes, of course, and the usual ""take ME. leave my daughter alone!"" stuff.

Probably my favorite part of this movie is the male lead actor, since I learned of Jettrey Dean Morgan first through the Supernatural television series.  I keep thinging, ""John Winchester would know what to do!""  (LOL)

Maybe I'm biased, but this DVD has earned a spot in my 4200+ titles DVD library.",1383868800,,674,4.528925619834711
