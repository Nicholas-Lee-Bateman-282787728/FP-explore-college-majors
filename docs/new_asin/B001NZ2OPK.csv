8328430,5,B001NZ2OPK,Like all The Civil War DVDs and history books.  A good one for the collector's out there,1494892800,,88,4.176470588235294
8328431,5,B001NZ2OPK,".. it may not be in high definition, but it is highly definitive! .. gives life to who were only names before; memorized to get through school. What a struggle! What a turning point; I watch it over and over. Somehow, Lee's retreat is more fascinating than any advance I've every learned about; I'd give it 7 stars!",1477872000,,315,4.448275862068965
8328432,5,B001NZ2OPK,"I just want to let you know that the packaging states Special Edition DVD Widescreen Produced in HD.The disc  itself is imprinted DVD and makes no reference to High Def on the label. So in essence, I think it was produced in High Def, but perhaps not recorded in high def and should play in any player.",1334707200,2,302,4.298245614035087
8328433,3,B001NZ2OPK,"WARNING. This is not an HD DVD or Blu Ray. It is a standard definition DVD. I ordered it and it has a regular DVD logo on the label and it plays on my standard DVD player. It says on the back ""Produced in stunning high definition"", which I'm sure it was, as are many films and documentaries. But it wasn't released in high definition.",1236384000,7,334,4.153846153846154
