3914327,4,B002DYKPHO,I just purchased all of the Halloween movies on DVD.  I got a great price on this 3 pack and all of the movies were good.  The only one I didn't like (that didn't have anything to do with Michael) was Part III and it wasn't in this set.,1256860800,,236,3.795918367346939
3914328,4,B002DYKPHO,"""Halloween The Curse of Michael Myers"" is set six years after the last movie, it seems that Jamie Lloyd (JC Brandy) has grown up yet been impregnated by a secret cult of druids as she gives birth to a child and Michael destroys her leaving the baby to be orphaned. The Strode family has moved into Michael's house as they believe it's safe until the Shape has returned yet again to Haddonfield and Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance) is still after him to find out what is his next secret intention of killing is. ""Halloween H2O: 20 Years Later"" is definitely what the title means as it's set 20 years after Halloweens 1 and 2 meaning it forgets that Halloweens 3 to 6 ever happened, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) faked her own death in Haddonfield as she moved on to California where she is raising a 17 year old son (Josh Harnett) and is now a head-mistress of a private school as she wants to live her life on after witnessing her brother Michael Myers burned in the hospital. However it seems the Shape just won't stay dead as he has been searching for her for many years yet he has as it's up to Laurie to put a stop to him once and for all. ""Halloween Resurrection"" is set 4 years after the last one, Myers is back alive as he goes back to his beloved hometown of Haddonfield. A producer (Busta Rhymes) hires some local college students to become part of a program that explores into the house of Myers for a WebTV reality show as it seems the William Shatner faced killer is out for blood.

Each of the films co-star Paul Rudd, LL Cool J, Marianne Hagen, Tyra Banks, Michelle Williams, Joseph Gordon Levitt, Janet Leigh and Adam Arkin. Now ""Curse of Michael Myers"" is definitely a weak as hell sequel that got butchered due to studio budget and there is a copy of the Producer's cut that can be found on the internet. ""H2O"" is the best of the Myers sequels since part 2 and 4 as it continues off the Laurie Strode and Myers story as i thought it would have been the end of the series but ""Resurrection"" was definitely the worst movie of the series. I mean come on, Busta Rhymes kicking Michael's butt saying some stupid lines? it's just plain wrong.

Curse of Michael Myers is bareboned, H2O has a featurette with trivia game and music video and finally Resurrection has commentary, storyboard comparisons, tour of set, deleted and alternate scenes with optional commentary, and featurettes.",1256688000,,2399,4.5
3914329,5,B002DYKPHO,"HALLOWEEN: The Curse of Michael Myers- I really don't like the Thorn curse idea. Just because it's a HALLOWEEN film, I tolerate it. Dr. Loomis is awesome but he doesn't really do much in this one. Jamie Lloyd had a baby and now, Michael wants it, so it's up to Tommy Doyle (of the original) Dr. Loomis, Kara Strode and Danny Strode to stop Michael and protect the baby! Michael's evil should NOT be explained. It should be a mystery, a mystery hidden behind a mask. If you love the series, you might like HALLOWEEN: THE CURSE OF MICHAEL MYERS!!!

HALLOWEEN H20: Twenty Years Later- This is a pretty cool sequel! I remember being 8 years old and seeing it at the theatre. 20 years after Michael tried to kill Laurie Strode, he decides to try again. She lives under the name of Keri Tate. She has a son named John. She works as a head mistress at a private boarding school in Northern California. She has a boyfriend. Soon, Michael tears her life up again. She soon decides to fight back and finish her brother off once and for all...until the sequel. If you love the HALLOWEEN series, you'll love HALLOWEEN H20: TWENTY YEARS LATER!!!

HALLOWEEN RESURRECTION- As a hard-core HALLOWEEN fan, I feel like I'm the only one who truly loves this awesome sequel! I love the plot, the setting, and the mood in the film! Michael finally finishes off his sister, Laurie Strode, which kinda sucked. One year has passed and Freddie Harris starts a new website called DangerTainment and six lucky people win a chance to be in it, and the location is Michael Myers' childhood home. I love that the house looks just like the original house. Sara, Rudy, Jen, Bill, Donna, and Jim are the winners, and they meet Freddie and Nora for their interviews. Meanwhile, across town, Myles 'Deckard' Barton is watching Sara do her interview, because he is interested in her and has been helping her with internet stuff. on HALLOWEEN, they all go to the Myers house, and broadcast live on the Internet for millions of people to watch. No one can leave until the show is over, so they are all locked in. Little do they know, Michael is back and doesn't like uninvited guests. At a college HALLOWEEN party, Myles 'Deckard' is watching the show, and when Michael shows up, Myles believes that the people are actually being killed, but no one else at the party does until Sara is the last one alive and calls Myles for help to tell her where Michael is at. Freddie finds Sara and realizes what is happening. Most people hate that Busta Rhymes karate-chops Michael, but I have no problem at all with it! Later, in the garage, Sara has been knocked on the ground with some heavy equipment on her, and Michael is coming to kill her, then Freddie knocks the door down, and says ""Trick or treat, motherfu#*er!"" to Michael because he thought he killed Freddie. If you love sequels, horror, the internet, and the HALLOWEEN series, you'll love HALLOWEEN RESURRECTION!!!",1252195200,5,2928,4.618042226487524
3914330,4,B002DYKPHO,"Quick review to the movies in the set

Halloween 6 The Curse of Michael Myers- A good film, at least to me. This is not the uncut version with 45 minutes of deleted scenes just the regular old movie. I still enjoyed the movie, although i'm still waiting for them to release it in an uncut version. Myer's is vicious in this movie and we get to see him rip a guys head off within the first fifteen minutes. The kills in this movie are the only real reason to watch this, better then what Zombie retold for his two Halloween movies. Overall, I enjoyed it and i'm a big Halloween fan.

Halloween H20: Myer sifts through Dr. Loomis's office to find out where his sister is now. He goes cross country to find her and the two sqaure off once again. This was at the height of teen horror mania which meant it hired young, flavor of the month actors and actresses to be killed off. They also seemed to add a washed up rapper (LL Cool J) to everyone of these teen horror films. Anyway, hated the teen cast and LL Cool J but the film is enjoyable when it's just Myers and Laurie facing one anther.

Halloween Resurrection: The worst of the original Halloween franchise. I will admit the first twenty minutes with the final battle of Laurie and Myers is good but then the film goes way off track. A typical flavor of the month teen cast, a rapper played this time by Busta Rhymes who fights Myers with karate, and a trend of the moment which was webcams. There is one good kill but I hated this movie overall. If you watch the first twenty minutes it's fine, after that it's nothing but crap.

Overall, two good films that every Halloween fan should own and one that started good that ended up going south. If you do not own these films it's a good chance to pick up some good films for a cheap price. I'm sure that as a bonus feature every dvd comes with a trailer. I hope Myer's dons the blue coveralls and white mask again, the way he was meant to be seen.",1251763200,3,1948,4.228494623655914

3914345,3,B002DYKPHO,"In the ""Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers"" Triple Pack, the final three (pre-Rob Zombie version) Michael Myers films are collected in one set. This is basically just the individual DVD releases packed together in a not too impressive paper keep case. There's not much else to say about it as a collection, except that packing part 6 with H20 and Resurrection is an odd concept since the later two create their own post-Halloween 2 continuity, so here is the low-down  on the individual DVD releases you'll find inside.

Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers DVD

""Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers"" might also be known to you as Halloween 6, being that it is the 6th film in the franchise and the 5th in the line of stories about the unstoppable killing force named Michael Myers, AKA The Shape, AKA The Boogeyman.  Taking place six years after the events of Halloween 5, we quickly discover from this film that little Jamie and Michael both disappeared after the last one. We also find out that the mysterious stranger in Halloween 5 was part of a very strange, Celtic cult that actually has held Jamie (and Michael) all these years and forced her to give birth to a baby that I assume is supposed to be Michael's, though I don't think the film ever flat out states this. After giving birth, Jamie attempts to escape from the cult with her baby, Michael in hot, angry pursuit. But this film isn't really about Jamie, which is a good thing, since the lovely Danielle Harris was tragically not brought back to enhance this installment. No, this one is about a member of the Strode family, single mother Kara Strode, who is staying with her dysfunctional family in the old Myers house while being spied on by a grown-up Tommy Doyle (a young and less humorous than these days Paul Rudd), who was the little boy Laurie Strode was babysitting in the first film (even though Rudd looks a lot more like the little boy from Halloween 5, which adds some unnecessary confusion). When Tommy, who has been obsessed with unraveling the mysteries of Michael Myers for years, finds himself the sole caretaker of Jamie's newborn baby and the only one who can warn Kara of the dangers of living in Michael's old house, he enlists the help of Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence), who makes his last stand against Michael here.

And that's the basically pretty weird sixth installment of the Halloween series. Granted, there's a lot of the old Michael stalking and killing shtick, but it's still quite an odd tale in my opinion, because of the weird cult conspiracy reminiscent of Halloween 3 in some ways, because it's hard to take Paul Rudd seriously these days, though he is a delight in his comedic roles, because what happened to the character of Jamie is so weird (and the recasting so disappointing), and  I also STILL don't like it that Michael's mask is not the Shatner mask in most of the sequels. Oh, and instead of seeing Michael go around stalking naughty teenage babysitters, here he stalks and kills a lot of older people, which is just not as interesting. So, this one is weird and lacks a lot of the good stuff of previous films. Still, I like films with dark conspiracy plots (I actually love Halloween 3 for that), and this was a really interesting one and a really interesting explanation for Michael's evil power and drive. Sadly, the film is just very forgettable for some reason, and it's hard not to be put off by the way the great character of Jamie is treated here. Basically, this is probably the most forgettable Halloween film. That's not to say it's not interesting though with some good points, but while I like that it introduced some new elements to the story, it still could have done that while keeping more of the spirit of the previous films than it did, I believe. The DVD is a widescreen presentation with no bonus features, so, nothing great about that. You do have the option of getting it as part of a three pack with H2O and Halloween Resurrection though, which at the moment are the final three films in the franchise, not counting the reboot films by Rob Zombie. Incidentally, word is out that there is a better version of this film, the Producer's Cut, but it is not available on DVD at the moment. Some folks really seem to praise that version, but I've not yet seen it.

Halloween H2O DVD

""Halloween H20"" is the 7th film in the Halloween franchise, and the sixth to tell a story of the relentless killer, Michael Myers. The H20 in the title makes reference to the 20th anniversary of the original film, and this also means the film is set 20 years after the original. However, this film ignores all the previous Halloween sequels, creating its own new continuity. That's actually a pet-peeve of mine, but it's hard to complain about it when they finally get back the original star, Jamie Lee Curtis, to continue the story of Laurie Strode. In fact, the bonus features on this DVD imply that this was a pet project of Jamie's.

So, 20 years after Laurie Strode was traumatically stalked by her brother, Michael, in the first two Halloween films, we pick up with her life as a private school headmistress using the false name of ""Keri Tate"" to prevent her brother from finding her once again. Laurie has seriously been disturbed by her past though, and she is now an alcoholic with a dependency on medications as well, struggling to go on and raise her teenage son who feels she is overbearing and overprotective. Laurie is also trying to have a romantic relationship with a school counselor who seems quite perfect for her, but ultimately, things are going to fall apart, because you know Michael Myers has finally picked up her trail, and Laurie is finally going to have to face off with her monster once and for all.

""Halloween H20"", should have been the dream sequel for hardcore fans of the original two films. Unfortunately, I often only hear negatives about it. Personally, I feel people are determined to judge these nostalgia sequels extra harshly. This isn't a bad film, it's just got some issues that are instant turn-offs for many. Probably the biggest problem is that it screams 90's horror. Watching this, you could easily be convinced you were watching a Scream, Urban Legend, or I Know What You Did Last Summer sequel. Now, I like those movies myself. Most are not as good as seventies and early eighties horror, and they're more dated too, but the best of them, like the original Scream, are very good. Much better than later ones, like the Black Christmas or Prom Night remakes. However, it admittedly is a little weird to see a Halloween film that looks so much like a Scream film. I think a lot of people just have a real problem with that, as a lot of horror fans just hate 90's horror stylings. Frankly, probably the biggest problem for me was the poor comic relief in the form of LL Cool J's phone conversations with his cartoonish-sounding wife (yeah, LL Cool J is in this as a school security officer). That and the fact that you never warm up all that much to the teen characters, who are late 90's uber cool and don't really grow on you, not even Laurie's son, played by Josh Hartnett (who is always kinda hard to like). But, overall, this Halloween installment/reboot (which I remember feeling very short when I saw it in the theater) is actually pretty good, I feel, if you can get past all the 90's stuff. The point of this story is Laurie Strode dealing with her demons, and I think the ending would have been a better ending for this run of Myers all together before the later reboot. What a shame they felt they had to make one more. Anyway, I can understand how there are many reasons to not love this film, but it still is pretty enjoyable and it's great to catch up with Laurie Strode again. Definitely a must have for fans of the original two films. Well, a must-see at least. The DVD holds a behind the scenes featurette, a trivia game, and a music video. Kind of light for a ""Collector's Series Deluxe Edition"". Oh well.

Halloween: Resurrection DVD

Yes, Michael Myers returns once again in the 8th and so far final film of the original ""Halloween"" storyline, ""Halloween: Resurrection"". Resurrection continues from the new, alternate storyline created by ""H20"", the previous Michael Myers film, which had ignored Halloweens 4-6, and the unrelated Halloween 3 in order to go back to the roots of the first two films and continue the story of Laurie Strode. Laurie returns again for this final installment, played once again by Jamie Lee Curtis, but don't let her prominence on the cover art fool you. Her role in this installment is very brief and apparently meant to be her and her character's bowing out of the series for good. Once that is out of the way, this 8th film tries to create a new motivation for Michael to continue as an unstoppable killing force, probably in the hopes of 8 more films. But alas, the only motivation they could come up with was Michael going back to his old house and killing anyone who invaded it. Well, I guess that makes sense, but it's also a little too bland and uninspired. For the first time, a Michael film truly seems like nothing more than walking around killing people in the dark. That's not to say this pretty much panned film doesn't have its own creativity. The invaders of Michael's home here happen to be a bunch of college kids taking part in a horror themed reality show, sent in to wander the Myers home in search of clues to what drove Michael to kill. The ""show"" they are doing is streaming live on the internet on Halloween night, and we get to follow the events from both perspectives, as another main character (who is luckily not in any physical danger himself; they should have given him more to do I think, like in his alternate ending) watches via a laptop at a Halloween party and eventually sends text warnings to guide one of the show participants, a pretty young girl he's become internet pals with, to safety. It actually plays out pretty interesting to watch, it's just also suffers from all the superficialities of modern horror. We don't really get too attached to any of the characters, not even the female lead they are trying to make into a modern Laurie Strode, and they are all just a little too self-obsessed, as good-looking folks often are.

So, basically, ""Halloween: Resurrection"" is worth watching for popcorn entertainment value and moderately successful as such, but it's a failed attempt at breathing new life into Myers' killing spree franchise. It just doesn't add anything to Michael lore beyond taking Jamie Lee Curtis out of the picture in the very beginning. And sorry if you think that's a spoiler, but it's important to share that this movie is not a Laurie Strode picture. The characters that make up the bulk of the film aren't very likeable, though I wish the hot redhead had been in more of it. The one character we get to like is the guy who isn't even in danger at all, because he shows the most genuine personality. He's actually played by a former Disney Channel star, Ryan Merriman, whom I always thought was going to be the breakout male star from his D.C. era. Turned out it was instead Shia LaBeouf, understandably, since his acting is insanely, phenomenally impressive. Oh, and there's also two other ""actors"" that must be noted. One is Tyra Banks, whom I have never liked since seeing bits of her talk show and other films where her acting was... unsatisfying. She must not be very memorable in this one though. I swear, I can't remember a single one of her scenes well enough to comment on how well she acted in this film. The other entertainer of note is Busta Rhymes, because he plays the most obnoxious character in the film and also one who faces off against Michael a few times and fairs perhaps a little too well each time. I don't think he would have lasted long gainst the Michael of the first few films. Frankly, here we are expected to laugh at Michael a bit too much, I think, when he has his encounters with Busta Rhymes. They ARE funny, but is it good to have moments in a ""Halloween"" film where we are laughing at Michael's expense? Anyway, I can never decide whether or not I like Busta Rhymes in this movie. I don't think the humor with Michael is appropriate, and at times Busta certainly is irritating. I'm sure most Halloween fans hate him in this. Still, at times I find him very entertaining in this too. But, this just enforces my point. This film is not a great Halloween franchise film. It fails in that respect. But it is an entertaining ""horror"" film to waste a night on.

Surprisingly after the previous films' DVD releases, this one is LOADED with bonus features. Director and editor commentary (by the way, this was surprisingly directed by the director of Halloween 2), deleted and alternate scenes, behind the scenes futurities, storyboard comparisons, and even a cut of the Headcam footage into an alternate look at the film(oh, yeah, the show participants all wear head-mounted cameras). So, if you're a fan of this one, the DVD doesn't short change you. Considering the fact that H20 was supposed to be such a big deal, you'd think that one would have gotten this sort of DVD treatment. Anyway, recommended only to the hardcore Michael Myers fan or as a pure popcorn movie. It IS entertaining to say the least, but they should have left things with H20 (or Halloween 2, ha).

Again, if you buy this three pack release as opposed to the individual releases, the only extra is the keep case, which is not the heavy duty kind. But, if you really want all these Halloween films and don't have any of them yet, go for it.",1290384000,6,13626,4.603952243721696
