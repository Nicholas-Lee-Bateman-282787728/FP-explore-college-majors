I'm planning on getting some of the other Henry the Lizard videos too.  Henry is an animated lizard, but the animals are real.  There are some parts that are cartoon-ish.  I highly recommend this video when you want to watch something is that soothing.  And there are NO COMMERCIALS!!!  Yeah!",1110844800,2,461,4.416666666666667
