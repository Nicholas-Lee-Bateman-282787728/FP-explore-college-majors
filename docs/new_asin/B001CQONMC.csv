3516117,5,B001CQONMC,"I love this series.  I never saw it when it was on TV, but it is awesome.  I enjoy being able to watch without commercials and watching more than one episode at a time when I can.",1227657600,,179,3.810810810810811
3516118,5,B001CQONMC,"This is a GREAT Series if you like Sci-Fi...but it is disapponting to see ""Write-Ups"" that there's no Ending.  Is there any way to get Hollywood to at least make a Movie with it's Finale?",1226707200,2,187,4.3428571428571425
3516119,5,B001CQONMC,"I rarely watch television.  The shows that I do watch are usually on DVD.  That said, The 4400 is a show unlike ANY that you have ever seen. It is a series that is one of my favorite shows of all time. It appeals to both non-sci fi fans and science fiction fans alike.

The premise of this television show, of course, centers around the human elements involving 4400 people who have disappeared over the last 60 years. Suddenly in ""a ball of light,"" these individuals return. They haven't aged; they remember nothing; and they each possess usually only one particularly unique and amazing ability.

The 4400 explores how disconnected and unraveled the lives are of those who have been returned.  In many cases, their parents or loved ones have already died; in almost all cases - their significant others have moved on with their own lives.  They are met with suspicion and fear wherever they go.

The acting is brilliant; the writing is superb; and the ""powers that be"" at USA should resign for canceling this show.  After watching this DVD, I never wanted it to end.  I think the ONLY thing that could redeem USA is if they start a new story line where 5 years of ""Promise City"" has endured and attempt to get as many of the actors back as possible.

And yes. I like Heroes. But frankly?  It absolutely doesn't hold a candle to The 4400.",1226361600,4,1339,4.514522821576763
3516120,5,B001CQONMC,"The 4400 was, in my opinion, one of the best shows ever on television. It had a fantastic cast and wonderful plot lines and plot twists. If you don't know anything about the series, it's basically about 4400 who went missing and returned (all at once) with new and interesting abilities. From there, the story changes SO much. Each season always ends with a huge reveal and a big game changer for the next season and overall scope of the series.

In my opinion, the second and fourth seasons were the strongest, followed by the first season (which was only a mini-series) and then the third season, which was my least favorite. With this set, every season is included and I suggest you watch them all in order because each episode builds on the last.

Although some of the plot lines in the third season were not my favorite, it was still much stronger than many other shows out there. The 4400 may be rooted in science-fiction, but it's so much deeper and more character oriented.

If you haven't seen this series, or are just hearing about it, please give it a try and buy this set. I promise you it will not disappoint. Some of the reviews say that the finale is a let down because it ends with a cliff-hanger. While that may be true in part, the series finale was actually one of the most exciting and interesting episodes of the whole series and really summed things up nicely, while still leaving questions open to the imagination.

If you already have the seasons on DVD and are wondering about getting this for the extras, it's really up to you. The only disappointment is that the discs are exactly the same as the ones from the previous sets. There is nothing altered about them- the menus, and even disc graphics have not changed at all. It's in a nice box and the bonus disc has some nice extras, but it comes down to if the extras are worth the price of the whole series. While different disc graphics and menus would have been nice, I cannot take off a 1/2 a star because the series itself is far too good. Give it a try!",1225152000,50,2035,4.404255319148936
3516121,3,B001CQONMC,"This was a great show that got cut short and again they cancel it without giving us an ending. I think from now on they should shoot the last episode at the same time as the first so they have it ready when they get canceled. I don't see any point in owning the set since the story just cuts off and according to the below from USA channel it will just have a documentary about where the show MAY have gone, not a conclusion to the stories.

THE 4400 COMPLETE DVD BOX SET ARRIVES OCT. 28
The entire critically-acclaimed and addictive fan-favorite series The 4400 is available for the first time in one complete box set! This comprehensive 15-disc set includes every episode from all 4 riveting seasons PLUS a brand-new bonus disc containing a never-before-seen look at where the series may have gone, an audio commentary, deleted scenes and more.

3516122,5,B001CQONMC,"I have to say, I also can't believe how this show slipped though the cracks, amazing.  It was definitely one of the best shows created over the last 10 years.  MUCH better than Heroes.  I've seen every episode.

There have been rumors that this DVD set contains some sort of conclusion to the series (which was left completely hanging after its broadcast final season).  Is this rumor true?  I've also heard there will be books based on the series but I doubt they will do very well.",1223510400,3,483,4.494252873563219
3516123,4,B001CQONMC,"Being one of those (unfortunately) rare viewers of ""The 4400"", I was struck with a sense of deja vu when watching this series - I had seen something very similar before. But the odd thing was, as I had caught the series on DVD, that I had seen it before on something that had come after - ""Heroes"". While that show was a huge hit, ""The 4400"" lingered in somewhat obscurity. Both dealt with ordinary humans with extraordinary abilities. But where genetics came into play with ""Heroes"", it was abduction that gave ""The 4400"" their powers. This was a great series with fun ideas - some, unfortunately never truly realized - whether the ""ripples"" of season one, or the series cliffhanger where the powers go further than ever before. This is one of those shows that, if you're a fan, it's kind of like you're in on a secret, because it never got the attention it deserved.",1222732800,43,868,4.535031847133758
3516124,5,B001CQONMC,"this series just oozes cool,cant get enough of the plot twist,the conspiracy angle,the writers of this sci fi drama my hats off to you !if youve purchased this item you definitely have good taste.  ANUBIS",1221609600,3,204,4.828571428571428
3516145,5,B001CQONMC,"When THE 4400 THE COMPLETE SERIES arrived for me to watch I was intrigued. Here was a series I remembered hearing about but never watched an episode of that ran for 4 seasons. The premise sounded interesting. Realizing early on that this series had a storyline that carried on from episode to episode I wanted to watch the entire thing before writing about it and with so many other items to watch that meant the binge watching took a while. Im glad I did but unhappy that I missed this series when it aired.

The show opens with a little girl named Maia on a picnic with her family in the 1930s who runs off to gather flowers. Suddenly a light appears in the sky and shines down on her and she disappears. Several other characters are seen disappearing as well. We are then brought to the current time (in this case 2004 when the series aired). A huge asteroid is heading towards Earth and nothing can stop it. Fearing the end is near people are stunned when the asteroid slows, shrinks in size and appears near Mount Rainier, Washington. Agents from NTAC (National Threat Assessment Command) are on hand watching and waiting as a burst of light emanates from the sphere.

When the dust clears the asteroid is gone. But on the beach are the 4,400 people who have been missing for years, including Maia. None of them can recall where they have been or what happened to them. NTAC takes them to their local command post in Seattle and begins trying to figure out just where they have been. Was it an alien abduction? Or was it something else? The rights of the 4400 are called into question and soon they are released into the world.

The story is told mainly through the eyes and actions of agent Tom Baldwin (Joel Gretsch), an agent whose son was not taken but was affected by one of these abductions and who has been in a coma for several years. He is partnered with Diana Skouris (Jacqueline McKenzie), on loan to NTAC from the CDC. Included among the 4400 is Toms nephew Shawn (Patrick Flueger) who was with Toms son the night he was abducted.

It doesnt take long for things to happen. As the days progress it appears that members of the 4400 begin to develop powers. Maia has visions of the future. Shawn can heal. Rather than see this as something wonderful the government fears what the potential effects are and want to quarantine the 4400. Theyre saved when billionaire Jordan Collier (Billy Campbell), a 4400 member himself, constructs a community just for them. Legal maneuverings keep the government at bay. Or do they?

The series develops over time and changes as the story progresses from discovery of the 4400 to government paranoia to us versus them to covert conspiracy to savior story. It flows effortlessly and takes its time to unravel the mystery of the 4400, revealing to us just what happened to them and why they were returned to this point and location in time. Who took them, their mission, who each of them are, are all explained before the end of the series. Fortunately this was not left open ended.

The characters are well developed and played exceptionally well by all involved. It is their story and the actors portraying them that draw you in and make you care about what happens. Each of them not only has a role here but they do so to the point you find yourself believing they are who they portray and thats the mark of solid acting.

The guest stars on this series are top notch as well beginning with Peter Coyote who plays Dennis Ryland, the head of NTAC in Seattle as the series opens and later seen working for a private firm with nefarious intent. Summer Glau is featured in several episodes as a schizophrenic young 4400 member who has the ability to influence people with her mind. My favorite though is Jeffrey Combs, known for his role as Herbert West in THE RE-ANIMATOR, who is seen here as a genetic genius and 4400 member trying to help them all. Fans of that past work will delight in seeing him here holding a syringe filled with a glowing green liquid, what had to have been a homage to his earlier work.

Once you start this series and get into what is taking place youll find yourself binge watching with pleasure. It draws you in, involves you and makes you think about so many different topics. Well made, well thought out and conceptualized to present a bigger picture, it is one series that as I said I wish Id have found sooner. Now that its been released as a complete series of discs in a compact case it should be easy for those of us who enjoy shows like this to have access to on our shelf whenever we want to revisit it.",1500163200,2,4588,4.48622754491018

3516189,2,B001CQONMC,"The 4400 was a science fiction show, that featured time travel, strange powers, government agents, conspiracies, and a whole lot more. After a very solid, yet writers strike shortened first season, The 4400 looked like it was going to be Heroes meets the X-Files, easily the next big thing in science fiction television. If that wasn't enough to interest fans, the show also had a head start, as its creators weren't newcomers. The 4400 was the brainchild of Rene Echevarria (Star Trek: The Next Generation) and Scott Peters (V, The Outer Limits). The show looked like a can't miss, then came Season 2...

Seattle Washington, 2004 - It's a seemingly normal night, when a space satellite picks up something unusual. Government agencies are in a panic, as this weird object descends over a mountain lake and emits a bright white light before vanishing. Once it's gone, 4400 people stand on the banks of the lake, 4400, who as it would turn out, have at one time or another been missing since as far back at the 1940s and as recently as six months ago. There's a big to do about what to do with these people, but they are soon released and a new agency is tasked with tracking and monitoring them. A seemingly easy job, until it's discovered that many of them have developed super human abilities.

The premise of the show is fantastic, on top of that it was created by one of the guys who is behind Star Trek: The Next Generation, basically a God in my eyes, and if that weren't enough it features Joel Gretsch, who is one of the most believable, realistic actors to ever play a federal agent in the history of television. This show had everything going for it, even the ratings were good, so why did they have to go and change things so much!

Despite good ratings and reviews, people thought the show was too much like the X-files, so they turned the 4400 into this kind of religious cult. Instead of being a mostly episonic show with underling storylines, the show went continuous, spending all of it's time following just a handful of characters. The line between good and bad, blurred, and most times you really couldn't follow who was doing what for whom and why anyone was doing what they were doing. After the first season, there were a couple of good episodes here and there but by season 3, the whole thing had just completely fallen apart.

I readily admit that I watch far more television than most people and far more than television than any normal person should, so trust me when I tell you, that in all my years of doing this, I have never seen a show go so quickly from as good as the 4400 was, to as bad as it became. It defied all logic, honestly did the actors and network involved in producing the shows not realize that after a while the whole thing just didn't make any sense anymore?

The bottom line is that the 4400 should have been the next Heroes, X-Files, Lost, Fringe, what have you. It should have been that next big sci-fi show, that had everyone talking. Instead too many chefs ruined the pie and the show literally became unwatchable.",1472256000,,3066,4.527075812274369

3516191,1,B001CQONMC,"This review is for the discs in this set. I ordered the 4400 complete series in June 2016. It is now August 2016. I've been watching a couple of episodes every week. I just got to Season 3, disc 2, and the disc does not work at all! I have tried it in multiple DVD players and even my laptop. I just went to my order page to see about replacing this broken disc or getting a refund, only to find out that it has been too long and I am stuck with this broken garbage disc. The series has been good so far, but I am not about to pay again to be able to finish it. This is the kind of series where every episode builds on the last, and you will be lost if you miss any episodes. I am very disappointed that Amazon as the distributor of this set does not stand behind their product. It is clear that these are cheaply produced discs with no quality control. From now on, if I do risk ordering another multiple disc set, doubtful at this point, I will need to be sure to test every single disc immediately. Buyer beware!",1471564800,3,1015,4.02970297029703

3516228,3,B001CQONMC,"Good enough to keep a sci-fi addict watching, but just barely. It had a good premise and a fitfully cool X-Files vibe, but it also had a lot of problems. The writing veered from okay to really, really dumbed-down. The main story arc kept some suspense going, but like so much TV sci-fi it was too often derailed by pointless soap opera digressions. The acting was very uneven. There were some good people in it, especially some of the guest stars like Jeffrey Coombs, but unfortunately Peter Coyote was in just-hand-me-my-paycheck mode and the two leads were dreadfully weak generic TV actors. They might be able to convince you to buy their brand of toothpaste, but they were fantastically ill-equipped to convince you they were federal law enforcement agents, even in a TV show. By season 3 I was zoning out pretty often, but as I said there was just enough suspense to keep me hanging in to the end.",1455235200,,902,4.64375

3516271,2,B001CQONMC,"I recently found ""The 4400"" on Netflix and started watching as I'd heard it was good some time ago. While the premise is interesting and the first season was good, as the show progressed it just couldn't hold up the same steam. The characters are bland and, overall, uninteresting. A huge problem that I have with series like these is that the characters get themselves into such huge amounts of trouble knowing what they should not do but then do it anyway. The whole relationship between Shaun and Isabelle is a prime example of this. They go into the whole situation saying that they should not have sex but end up going ahead and doing it anyway, with disasterous consequences. There's also a few of the characters that are just plain annoying or creepy to no end. Honestly, when they killed off Matthew Ross (Garret Dillahunt), I was so glad. That character was a total creep.

As the show dragged (and I do mean dragged) onward the show just became more and more boring. Eventually the character of Jordan Collier comes back after a long absense from the show but now starts proclaiming that he's some sort of Messiah or God. At that point, I was pretty much done with the show. Seriously, it just got to a point where the characters just became tedious to listen to and watch them slog their way through this mire of a plot.

Finally the series caps itself off with a rush-job ending, a lot of unanswered questions, and the death of a main line character. So, yeah, it pretty much died with a whimper rather than a bang.

I gave the show two stars for a good first season, but after that it was a long downhill road into the dumpster. Save yourself some time and just skip this show. It's long, boring, and very easily forgettable.",1428278400,,1738,4.511111111111111

3516295,2,B001CQONMC,"MISSED OPPORTUNITY...

This show had serious promise in that it posed depth and reflection on good vs. evil, right vs. wrong. I watched all episodes, though admittedly I had to fast forward through many scenes because they were just cheesy fillers, and just plain silly. ""4400"" should not have made it past two, possibly three seasons. The episodes became increasingly insulting to anyone with half an intellect. The main characters -- the so-called NTAC agents, cared about justice until one of their own relatives were involved on the wrong side of the law, in which case they broke every rule possible to protect their own relative or friend.

The last season was very intriguing until they put a young, inexperienced blond bimbo in charge as the NTAC Director. Her first act was to jump in bed with a subordinate agent. Even as law enforcement professional myself, I found myself rooting for the 4400 abductees.

This show could have been so much more. But then, I guess anything that's not silly or sleazy doesn't stand much of a chance of making it past the first season these days. That's an unfortunate commentary on our society.",1422748800,,1137,4.850515463917525

3516327,5,B001CQONMC,"With series like 'Les Revenants' and 'In the Flesh' getiing well-deserved attention, I decided to go back to a show that was ahead of its' time and consistently overlooked during its' original run several years ago, 'The 4400'. The premise is now familiar, but was quite original at the time -- people long since given up as lost return home, oblivious to the passage of time. It begins as an object that is assumed to be a meteor suddenly changes trajectory, something meteors don't do, and ends up on a collision course with Earth. Given its apparent size and velocity, the kinetic impact would be utterly cataclysmic. The various nuclear powers fire their most powerful warheads at the 'meteor' when it enters the atmosphere, to no effect. The object then slows down to a near stop (another meteor(ite) no-go, obviously) and makes landfall on the shore of a lake by Mt. Rainier. Police, news teams and onlookers from nearby Seattle are there to greet what reveals itself as a shimmering ball of liquid and light, which promptly disappears in a blinding, almost explosive flash. As a mysterious mist dissipates, the world is witness to the inexplicable return of 4400 people, all of whom went missing months, years, and even decades earlier. They are just as shocked and clueless about the situation as everyone else is, with no memory of what happened to them after their supernatural abduction. Even stranger, they haven't aged since being taken. The American government quarantines the entire group, but releases them after it is determined they pose no obvious threat, and are victims of whatever bizarre agency was responsible for their circumstances. As the 'returnees' try to find a place in a world that has become completely alien to them during an absence that feels no longer than the space between heartbeats, some of the 4400 begin to manifest inexplicable abilities: telepathy, telekinesis, even the power to heal incurable diseases and mortal wounds. As the truth leaks out, fear and prejudice spread, and the government agency NTAC struggles to keep the situation from erupting into a war, even as the agents involved find their loyalties divided. By season 2, part of the mystery behind the 4400 is uncovered, even as new mysteries are born.

This series works both as entertaining SF and melodrama, with excellent writing and plotting throughout the 4-season run, as well as a huge cast of semi-familiar Canadian and American faces who provide mostly superb performances. Although it was limited to 4 short seasons (season 1 only has 6 episodes), 'The 4400' accomplishes a lot, balancing the over-arching storyline with semi-episodic tales that serve to introduce a multitude of characters and dilemmas. For anyone missing 'Les Revenants', 'The 4400' is definitely a series worth watching, with a similar intelligence and poignancy. It falters, at times, but is far superior to shows like 'Under the Dome', to which it is a thematic blood relative. Where 'Under the Dome' fails on almost every level, however, 'The 4400' succeeds.",1410998400,,3050,5.063618290258449

In this story, 4400 people just appear on a lake, shortly after a large ball of light finds its way there.
These people, turn out to be some of the world's missing. People who had just vanished. Thing is, they all come back exactly as they were the day they disappeared. No one had aged.

Government officials swoop in and take every into quarantine. No one remembers what happened while they were gone or how they were taken. They have no idea why they haven't grown older. And the Feds are pretty nervous since no one knows a thing.

The 4400 was picked up by a cable network and I have hardly ever had cable television. This show deals with the future of humanity. The 4400 puts the argument of who should be in the front of humanity before us. Should the most advanced people lead us or should they be tossed back into the mass of humanity. The show asks, can those who are advanced even associate with the ordinary? Maybe those who know better have to separate from those who are not interested in any kind of growth. I also enjoyed the side story in the 4400 about the African man and his daughter. Dark men and women are tearing themselves apart. We can come together by transcending our differences with the mind. The 4400 also offers this as an option.

3516477,4,B001CQONMC,"Bottom line: If you like stories dealing with alien abduction, time travel, or multi season story arcs, then this series might be for you.

I watched this in part when it was originally on the air (USA Network) and partly over Netflix. Therefore, I have no comment on the quality of the DVD's only on the story itself.

The basic plot is that all of the folks who have been kidnapped by aliens over the last fifty years are all returned at once. They have not aged nor do they remember what happened to them while they were gone. As the story develops, it becomes clear that these folks were not abducted by aliens and were returned to create a very specific outcome.

The show itself mostly takes a ""...freak of the week..."" approach where one of the 4400 has issues or creates problems because of a special ability that they have developed. The series is pretty enjoyable if you simply watch it at that level. Additionally, one can enjoy the multi-season story arc, and if you are so inclined, you can read deep into the nature of class, society, and genetics. There is even a bit about the nature of police states as well.

I was surprised to see Summer Glau in this series. I didn't recognize her from when it was on the air. She is rapidly becoming, to me anyway, the modern day version of Jimmy Stuart. Not that attractive or really that strong of an actor, but very watchable.",1379808000,,1383,4.454545454545454

Some powers prove beneficial, others not so good.  We watched the whole show through over a period of several weeks.  I was quite thankful for the fast forward button so I could by-pass all the recaps of previous episodes.  The ending of the last season seemed truncated... but perhaps that was because they knew the show wouldn't be renewed?",1358121600,2,477,5.076923076923077

Because I and my late husband had a UFO experience I can't even begin to describe 4400 because it has so much going on but it is not one of those shows where you get lost in all the people. My husband and I were going  to a Rabbi for a Jewish divorce; driving up a hill when we got to the top we saw 'something' hovering over us.  It was no helicopter, plane or any other form of transportation in America and beyond.  The 'thing' hoovered for quite awhile-noises iminated from it - sort  of whirring sounds and two rows of lights. My husband was a UFO nut-he read everything he could get his hands on and truly believed they were and maybe are 'here.' When he was in Patton's army at some point there were a couple UFO sightings somewhere in the area.  My husband tried to get out of the car-he was not afraid one bit (of anything -EVER) and he was ready to go out and yell up to them or to look around the huge 'thing.' I held him by his belt for all I was worth screaming like crazy for him not to open the door.  After several minutes the 'thing' whirled away up into the sky. So this movie hit home somewhat. We've never been taken away (except by Calgon) (that's for the oldsters) but on that day I know damn well my hubby would have been perfectly willing.  4400 brought back all these memories and the 'thing -ship' that is spotted in the first show of the series was very much like what we saw/ Great movie-great memories of something that happened about 40 years ago.",1356393600,3,1538,4.140939597315437

I would not call myself a sci-fi fan- there's a lot of bad stuff out there. I AM a fan of good drama & characters, and frequently the vehicle for good drama is a science fictional situation. I like to see how believable characters deal with fantastic events. If you like Heroes, X-men, Jericho, Lost, etc., I think you'll enjoy this show.

The overall theme is that individuals over time have been abducted into the future, somehow altered (individually), and then sent back in time as one large group.  The early episodes tend to focus on one person at a time, as they discover their individual ""gift"" and try to adapt, but then the story seems to get bogged down in trying to figure out who in the future was doing what and why, and what these 4400 people are supposed to be accomplishing, and who in the future would be the ""good"" guys vs. the ""bad"" guys... whether the ""gifts"" are to save mankind or sabotage us.  Also, who can be trusted, and the meaning of a child born as a result of impregnation in the future.  My interest petered out as the series went along.",1338076800,9,788,4.451388888888889

However be assured that you do not have to go through the whole series to find the purpose.

The box of four seasons is the only way to watch. If you like extra goodies like voice over commentary it is here. Personally I just like to go straight through. Big warning the fourth season ends expecting a fifth that never happens. There have been movements on the internet to revive a fifth series.

3516558,5,B001CQONMC,"The 4400 is one of the best science fiction series to ever be on television. The acting was top-notch, the story and plot lines were believable, and captured your attention, leaving you awaiting its continuation with next week's installment. I purchased all 4 seasons separately, as they became available, and they are some of my favorites in my DVD collection.

Imagine if 4400 people, abducted by aliens, were suddenly returned to Earth. They haven't aged, and each of them have had a unique ability unlocked before their return. You can imagine the possibilities.

The cancellation of The 4400 is what happens when some short-sighted bean counter makes programming decisions based merely on dollars and cents, and this is why nothing of any value can ever be seen on the major networks. I count the USA Network in here, since the primary owner is NBC. Instead, we get strapped with mindless drivel like ""Survivor"" and the new ""Knight Rider."" I can't tell you the last time I watched a programming offering from NBC or CBS, beyond a sporting event. I tried to watch ABC's reinvention of ""V"", but they keep preempting the show and moving the freaking date so that I never know when it is on. The only network left that has the kahoonas to stick with a good show is FOX, and sometimes those decisions are questionable.

It was a season finale and not a series finale, you can definitely tell that they weren't aware the show wasn't going to be back for a 5th season.

3516563,4,B001CQONMC,"I had the highest expectations for this series; unfortunately the story became lost in the writers emotionally milking the audience for all they were worth.  Instead of developing a good idea, it seemed to morf into an effort to be:  social commentary, Si-fi, drama, mystery &  crime.  It just didn't work after the first 2 seasons.  The acting and ideas were good; and the characters were compelling.  I would give the first season 5 stars, second 4.5, third 3.5 and the last 3.  Nevertheless, it was better than most of what's out there.

It can be unsatisifying for the viewer to have the series end with a cliff-hanger (it was cancilled abruptly after season 4).  So one needs to be prepared.  Here's my take on how it would have eventually ended- The occupants of the controlling ""walled city"" of the future were actually the decedents of this 4400 (in the future).  It fits and would seem a perfect plot twist.",1253836800,15,916,4.6625

3516591,5,B001CQONMC,"Unfortnately, season three was the killer.  While it had its decent spots, it was seriously lacking as far as advancing the plot and was an obvious attempt at a season 4.  They got the season 4 and started out just like season 3, but then I guess they found out they were being canceled and got back on track.  I wish they had just been a bit smarter, because this was honestly one of my all time favorite television shows.  A season five with an actual story wrap-up would have been awesome, or even make a full feature film (or mini-series) to close it up.
When season four ends, you might shed a tear because you will never know what happens.  It's ""ending"" was not satisfactory to me because I had so many things I wanted to see a resolution to.  But all complaints aside, this is worth watching.

On a side note, if you like this, you might want to check out ""Taken"" which is an alien abduction show (mini series) that was just fantastic  (Also stars Joel Gretsch)!",1238284800,7,970,4.35

3516594,5,B001CQONMC,"A/N: I will not critique ""Heroes"", nor try to compare that show with this one!

That said, ""The 4400."" is one of those rare sci-fi shows that not only grabs you with it's cool mythology, but also keeps you interested by investing in the charaters and how they are adapting to the near impossible experience of 4400 people being abducted over the eriod of 60 years and all of the sudden reappearing on a beach one fateful night.

In a brief overvew, the shows focuses on two government agents (Tom and Diana) and how they must handle the above mentioned event, from ""freak of the week"" events to harboring 4400's themselves. The show, like many other reviewers have noted, flew too low under the radar and never got the audience it deserved.

With that sid, here's an oveview of the seasons:
Season 1: a little short b/c the show was supposed to be a mini-series. It sets up the basic mythology of the show, and gets the audience ready for the task of living with these 4400 abductees/returnees. 4/5 (becuase its short)

Season 2: The show really takes off with this season. The storyline is et up nicely, with some significant plot development (ripple effects, government conspiracies, and future predictions, too wet your curiosity). The cast is amazing, and you really get to see each main character's lives fleshed out. 5/5

Season 3: This season falls a little short from the awesome dynamics of S2. The main stroyline is drawn on, and the progression of the overall story is slowed. The big issue: promicin! But, still the season is worth a watch. 3/5

Season 4: This season goes back to the characterization and plot development of S2, and really begins to discuss the effects of promicin and how it will affect the lives of 4400's and on-4400s. The cast is exceptional this season, and all the development we've seen from some characters for the last 3 seasons really reaches it peak. 5/5

The show was unfortunately cancelled, and for those who watch the show i couldn't have come at a worse time, as the S4 cliffhanger will leave you wondering ""what next?""

The show is definately worth your while if you ahve not seen the show previously, or wrote it off as another ""sci-fi show""

p.s.--no comment on the extras, as they are the same from the individual dvd seasons, except for the ""ghost"" season disc, which is a nice present to loyal fans!",1232409600,73,2351,4.659420289855072

One day I just decided to rent season one from our video store.  I was totally hooked.  I went back and rented season two and at the time I could not wait for season three to come on tv.  This was like right before Battlestar came on - so when the series ended I was comforted by BSG taking over that huge sci-fi gap that was missing since Enterprise ended. If 4400's was renewed for another season, I would totally watch it.  I also love the fact that the female detective cop lady was in Romper Stomper [Australian film with Russell Crowe].  It was good to see her make a come back.  My favorite female character in the show was Isabella, I wish we could find out what happens with her.  I also really liked Tom's son in the show, the one that was in a coma in the begining.  It would have been cool to see what they writers would have done with his character too.  SPOILER ALERT -- Also what happened to Tom's lady - would he ever see her again.  What about the people who took the 4400's in the first place.
