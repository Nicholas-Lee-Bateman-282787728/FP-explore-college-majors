2670478,5,B000JFY160,"I remember purchasing this video and just stoked about watching popular surfers such as Kelly Slater to legend Gerry Lopez and also to see singer/surfer Jack Kohnson and many others together in a surfing film.  Oh, and my favorite surfer Tom Curren also stars in this film and many others who are not mentioned on the back cover.

Granted, you see many surfers from different surfing companies in various films but this one, rarely are you going to see a surfing film with Kelly Slater, Gerry Lopez, Jack Johnson, Rob Machado and a few others together like this.

But what I enjoyed this film is just the incredible videography that I've watched it so many times over the years because it's not so much about watching these legendary surfers surf, it's about the environment, the life and embracing the location and the people in the area.

Watching the surf team from Jamaica to these kids using broken boards to surf to the Jamaican Surf Team, that was just so cool to see.  Overall, this film was truly a cool surfing experience with one of the coolest visual experiences of a surf film that I've seen (and I've watched many surfing films).

I don't know if I would call it a classic but I really enjoyed the film, it wasn't so much in your face but it was about substance and surfing as a way of life and the people who live in South America, Polynesia and Jamaica.  So, all in all, I truly digged ""A BROKEDOWN MELODY"".

VIDEO:

For a surfing film, I felt the video on 16mm was just a fantastic way to document this film.  The colors looked vibrant and just overall, it had a look that wasn't to crispy clear, had that edge and noise with some of the dust that you would expect to see.  Visually, the colors and overall look were very cool!

AUDIO:

Although this film is more of a surfing/documentary style and a lot of dialogue, the focus on audio is primarily the cool music by Jack Johnson, Eddie Vedder and many other talents.  Music definitely gave a great ambience throughout the film.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

This DVD comes with several special features.  Extra surf segments is pretty much nearly 27-minutes worth of extra footage.  This extra footage are just in par with the actual film, I'm guessing was cut out for pacing reasons but still watching the cut footage is actually better than a lot of stand-alone DVD's that are twice as long.

For ""Moonshine Videos"", you get the music videos for Ben Harper's ""With My Own Two Hands"" and ""Diamonds on the Inside"" and you get the ""Taylor"" outtakes which is a short segment featuring actor Ben Stiller pretending to talk surf lingo with two guys.

For ""Surf Aid International"", pretty much a five minute segment about what the organization is about and how it helps people in other countries that are less fortunate and how they bring doctors to help people affected by malaria.  Pretty much focusing on a guy named Dave who is a doctor who was surfing in another country and went to a nearby village to see how he can help people in the village and learned that they really needed his help.  He quit his high paying job, sold his house to help the villagers and use low-cost vaccines and education to help the villages.

""A BROKEDOWN MELODY"" is just a fantastic film.  Not too long and not boring at all.  It's just visually appealing and the various cuts and editing featuring the beautiful waves, the landscapes and the people from that live near the area just enjoying the surf along with the surfers was just incredible to see.

So, pretty much, I felt that I got more for my money with this surfing DVD.

Surfers looking for aerials or big wave surfing, this is not the video you are looking for.  For surfers that just want to enjoy surfers like Kelly Slater, Tom Curren, Gerry Lopez, Jack Johnson and others surfing in South America, Polynesia and Jamaica and just enjoy the overall scenery and to hear not just from the surfers about the experience but also the villagers, you don't really see that in a surfing film.

Definitely worth owning!",1232323200,14,4010,4.57703081232493

2670480,5,B000JFY160,"as a surfer, i have seen quite a few surfing DVD's.  this is one of the better ones because of the music and the amount of good surfing that it expands upon.  nice to see surfers having fun no matter the size of the wave and nice to see surfers from all over the world, of all ages.  anything with jack johnson involved is going to be super laid-back and this does not dissapoint.",1223251200,3,380,4.108108108108108
2670481,1,B000JFY160,I heard a song on this and thought I was buying a music cd but this is a long dvd of surfer dudes -not what i was expecting - it maybe good but Iam not the kind of guy who sits around watching tv surfing i would rather actively surf on the tv.,1216857600,,243,3.6037735849056602
2670482,3,B000JFY160,"Lots of great footage of great surfers, like Slater, Machado and the Malloys. I enjoyed the Jamaican segment as well. Where the movie falls short is in the writing. A surfer would probably give this 4 or 5 stars. However, if you do not surf, it's frustrating to have lots of great waves and action but not knowing who you're watching. The movie rarely tells you who the surfer on the screen is at any given moment. Slater is easier to identify because he's bald, and Machado does have a very distinguishing hairdo, but for the rest, again, it's hard to tell who you're watching, unless maybe you're so familiar with the surfing of all the guys to recognize them from their style or appearance. I guess that most surfers would rather watch without any commentary, and I can understand that but for the rest of us, it'd be nice to have a little more info. I did notice while watching the credits that there's no writing credit, so that's not surprising. Still, it's fun to watch. I also liked the short part where Slater and Curren are talking and reminiscing. It would have been nice to have a bit more of that sort of thing. A voiceover by the director would have been great too as a special feature.",1192406400,7,1200,4.459090909090909
2670483,5,B000JFY160,"I feel that it is becoming more and more the case today that surf movies are just a way for companies like Billabong, Rip Curl, Globe, etc. to get their team out in the lime-light.  They smear their logos all over the film and back it up with raging, lame, typical SoCal crappy whiteboy music, but A Brokedown Melody, like its predecessors creates a fantastical and complete surfing experience.  There are no subtitles telling you who is surfing or who the song is by because it doesn't matter; the movie is too good for those details to make a difference.  The movie is one whole journey that has calming and seductive overtones.  This is BY FAR the best surf movie I have ever seen.  It is an authentic documentation of what surfing truly is and what it should continue to be.",1182729600,2,778,4.48936170212766

The length is perfect, the soundtrack and extra segments are perfect, and I want ""The Road"" segment played at my funeral. It's a perfect summation of surfing and life in general.  If you enjoy surfing DVDs and have not seen this, it's a no-brainer - order it!!",1347926400,2,361,4.373134328358209
8150203,5,B000JFY160,"I highly recommend this film for the surfer and non-surfer alike. I appreciate that there's not so much talk: In general the athletes should be left to do what they do best- ride and not talk. In addition to top-rate surfing from pros, there are segments that show the spirit of just going surfing with your friends, of being at peace just because you're in the water. This film evokes that feeling as much if not more so than any ""sports flick"" I've watched. I've re-watched this enough times to say that it's worth it to own this one.",1250467200,2,536,4.424242424242424
