8065792,3,B0009S2KE2,"This is a 'general' review of the film: ""The Rites of Frankenstein""  - independent of the specific 'Impulse"" DVD version currently being advertised,

The version I watched purported to be 'un-cut' but I have no means of comparison to verify how 'intact' the print was or what might have been 'cut' from the film in other 'editions' (sex or violence or irrelevant footage?).  Regardless - I found this Franco effort to be particularly bizarre and sort of annoying - in that way that Franco films CAN be.  The fairly complex story line and characters are introduced in a fragmented fashion  that makes it difficult to follow the action or care about the participants.  There ARE some brilliantly eerie scenes and quirky performances, but Franco's clunky editing doesn't manage to blend them all into an effective whole in this one. Lots of dark, virtually indecipherable, scenes and many instances of inexplicably poor focus also detracted from the enjoyment level.

I have noted that this film is sometimes packaged under the title: ""The Erotic Rites of Frankenstein"" - which might lead one to expect some 'erotic' action. Surprisingly (especially for Franco)  there is little that could be considered 'erotic' (nor any nudity) in this film - the only flesh on display is the chest of the silver colored 'monster'. Usually in Franco's films there is a little skin to entice one to keep watching... but no such respite this time.  This film can possibly stand up to multiple viewings - in fact it may NEED them in order to understand it - but personally I didn't find it very satisfying on its' first watch. This movie felt like Franco was flailing about - injecting multiple concepts - but he couldn't keep it together and the end result is ultimately pretty un-engaging.  More of a renter than a keeper from my perspective - but potentially worth a look if you are a Franco complete-ist.",1388102400,,1887,4.850467289719626
8065793,3,B0009S2KE2,"There's good Franco, bad Franco, trippy Franco, sleazy Franco, and downright unwatchable Franco. It is often best to let someone else test the waters on the bulk of his sizable cannon, before you take the plunge either with your time or money. I'd heard plenty of both good and bad things about Rites of Frankenstein, so predictably I suppose it landed somewhere in the middle.

On the eve of bringing life to his creation Frankenstein is murdered, and his monster is stolen by the mythical Cagliostro. Seeking vengeance for her fathers murder Frankenstein's daughter (also a scientist) finds Cagliostro's castle, but enslaved by Cagliostro's will, is forced to create a female to mate with her father's creation. That's the bare-bones of it, but being a Franco film there is plenty of ""stream-of-consciousness"" plotting that involves variations of characters that populate many other Franco films.

Like most of Franco's watchable efforts, the rewards are in his audacious moments of  surreal and delirious invention, and the film does have it's share of the otherworldly.  Cagliostro's henchmen carting a coffin across the beach, and a mist-shrouded forest of the walking-dead are just such moments. Like many Franco films of this period, it also has a fun improvisational jazz score that plays effectively against it's period settings.

However, at a mere 85 minutes it seems long, and there is also a lot of repetition. For example, at one point Cagliostro's ""bird-woman"" assistant makes the same speech about the monsters pending copulation three times in a row, as if she were on a stage stalling for someone who missed their cue. There is also a lot of slapdash day-for-night photography were it becomes really hard to see who is doing what to whom. The Frankenstein monster is of the classic Universal square-head style, but he is painted with silver greasepaint which amusingly, is always rubbing off on his clothes and other actors. Still, if your a Franco fan your used to letting such details go.

Probably the biggest disappointment with this specific DVD is that it contains the sexually tame Spanish cut. The disk has few blurry clips from the spicier English Language version as extras, which only serve to tease you, that it would have been a bit more fun than the version you do get. Also the English dubbing sounded better realized  than the Spanish to me. Other than that, is a pretty decent anamorphic widescreen presentation.",1143936000,7,2447,5.042079207920792
8065794,4,B0009S2KE2,"For the uninitiated, Franco is very definitely an acquired taste, and his work is wildly uneven. At their worst, his films are wretched and virtually unwatchable. At their best, they're quite effective in evoking a claustrophobic, hallucinatory mood of menace and horror. This is probably my favorite of his numerous cinematic ""atrocities"" (although I like ""Vampyros Lesbos"" almost as well). Absurd, nonsensical, senseless, full of beautiful women and mindless violence and horny monsters...it's all these things and more. Some of its more hauntingly exotic imagery includes Anne Libert as Melissa, a blind bird woman with long talons, feathers, and a taste for human blood. It may sound silly to some, but I found it quite disturbing listening to her shrill bird sounds as she slowly and torturously drained the blood of a bound human victim. Dennis Price is alternately idiotic and terrifying as the constantly-revived Dr. Frankenstein. The whole experience is sort of a low-budget combination of cheesy horror film and LSD-trip. As I've said, this will not be everybody's cup of tea. But for those willing to try something different, even a little twisted and cracked, it may be exactly what the doctor (Dr. Frankenstein, that is) ordered.",1128384000,10,1242,5.2462311557788945
8065795,4,B0009S2KE2,"Jesus Franco's """"""La Maldicion de Frankenstein"""""" is now on dvd in the US. I am very excited about this and other future releases. Image Entertainment's release of this marks the first time I have seen this. I was aware of muddy bootleg copies for years, but somehow always avoided them. Franco seems to be a love it or hate it affair with over 180+ titles in his oeurve, it's sure there is some crap amongst the good. This was actually much better than I expected. Widescreen print and the use of great cinematography really stands out. The castle is the same one featured in A VIRGIN AMONG THE LIVING DEAD. Beautiful landscapes and Anne Libert's menacing bird sounds. The quality of the alternate footage is a bit rough but it's still nice to see it.

 For Franco enthusiasts, get this!",1124150400,9,788,4.621428571428571
