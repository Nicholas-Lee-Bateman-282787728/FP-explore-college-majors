8089632,4,B000BO0FKK,"Classic Shakesperian melodrama with some great acting, and timeless sociopolitical conflict.  Such a sad affair that a person can end up with such a sense of self-loathing. I could see being really put off by Turturro if this was the first time you saw him, but he was as committed as ever.",1515283200,,290,4.576923076923077

8089634,2,B000BO0FKK,"I wish one of the reviewers had warned me about that before I watched the movie. People are cruel to each other all the time. I pretty much expect that. But a scene with a man beating an innocent penguin to death, even though it only shows the blows, it doesn't show them landing - it turned my stomach. I would not have watched the movie if I'd been aware of that scene. Later on they do show the dead penguin. I'm sure it's fake, but still, I don't watch movies that show cruelty to animals, or movies where animals die - at least, not if I know that is what happens. In this movie, it took me by surprise, so I want to make sure that anyone else who feels the same way is forewarned.

That scene aside, this is a disjointed, jerky, almost nonsensical story. Few of the characters are completely sympathetic. There are two different story lines that finally come together at the end, but the key element (the use of a bow and arrow) is never explained, nor is the reason why the two characters who use the bow and arrow are where they are at the end of the movie. I only watched this because I have been a Jodie Foster fan for years, but her character in this movie is not particularly likeable.

This is one of those ""I wish I had that 90 minutes of my life back"" movies. I really wouldn't recommend it to anyone except a movie snob who will find all kinds of hidden meanings and blah blah blah.",1511481600,13,1398,4.193308550185874

8089637,5,B000BO0FKK,"This really only merits four stars even though the players are absolutely sublime.  I gave it five stars for it's plausibility.  People like these really do exist.  Madness like this does exist.  I've known some of them.  Kudos to the writers, the director and the actors for showing us that insanity is as common as your neighbors.",1509148800,,332,4.754385964912281
8089638,3,B000BO0FKK,Not that great; too many disjointed scenes/side stories. I only watched it because I like Jodie and Turturro.,1508457600,4,109,5.111111111111111
8089639,4,B000BO0FKK,"A quirky independent film with a strong cast, Five Corners mixes light touches and the very serious in unpredictable ways.  The main action takes place over a couple days in the Bronx in 1964.  John Turturro returns to his neighborhood with pent-up anger, particularly against Jodie Foster, the timid victim of the attempted rape that sent him to prison.  Tim Robbins was her savior then, now only interested in preparing to become a civil rights freedom rider.  Todd Graff is her willing but ineffectual boyfriend, crippled trying to stop the attempted rape.  As Turturro tries to reestablish contact with Foster, she seeks Robbins' protection while trying to keep her boyfriend from getting hurt again.  A subplot involves a couple out-of-control women and a couple mischief-making men who provide some comic relief and more.  And there are penguins and mysterious bow and arrow shootings.  There is a slightly surreal edge, and a peculiar usage of the famous duet from Delibes' Lakme.

Though very much its own thing, the nostalgia and offbeat mood reminded me of American Graffiti and Diner at times.  The acting and rich dramatic texture drew me in so that I was willing to follow the odd turns without complaint.  Turturro is particularly impressive.  Unlike some, I didn't think the film fell apart at the end, which made as much sense as the rest and had some strong dramatic content.  Very much worth seeing.

I have a Disc Plaza/Cascadia DVD release, part of a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/double-bill/dp/B000B6TLXU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">double bill</a>.  It's somewhat dark, soft, pixelly at times, not very good color, pan-and-scan.  Sound is OK mono.  Because of the poor quality I had to use the stop-action function to see who did what at a crucial point at the end.  There are other editions out on DVD (search DVDs for the title), but the transfers may not be any better than this one.  See&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/here/dp/6304609434/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">here</a>&nbsp;for some more reviews.  (Keep in mind that unless a review says which DVD release it's commenting on, it might not be the one for which the review is posted, so most of the remarks about video quality, including the ones from Amazon itself, aren't very useful.)

My copy is a bit under 90 minutes.
