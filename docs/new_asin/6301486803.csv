330639,4,6301486803,"While it may be difficult for parents to rate this video high, children LOVE it!  I have three grandchildren and I'm buying a second copy for them to have at home because that's all they want to watch when they come over.  They'll watch it over and over singing and dancing.  They are ages 1, 2, and 4.",1008460800,,302,4.172413793103448
330640,4,6301486803,"My toddler sits transfixed through this video where Clifford and Emily Elizabeth participate in a scavenger hunt to find different shaped things. The only reason I gave it 4 stars vs 5 stars is the ending where the winner gets tickets to the rodeo --not a politically correct event to promote I think (animals are not treated well in rodeos, although I don't think there was awareness of this in 1988 when the video was made) Nevertheless, the video is entertaining and actually thought provoking! For instance, one of the items on the find list is something that represents ""a circle within a square"" ...  Although Clifford and Emily have different voices than the current series on tv and Emily looks like she does in the books rather than in the current PBS TV series, they are are still close enough and cute enough to pass.  All in all I very much recommend this video for its educational and entertainment value --that is, if you can still find it!!! (Still thinking about that item to be found? It's a pizza in a box.)",990748800,,1025,4.595628415300546
330641,4,6301486803,"This is definitely not the PBS cartoon.  In my (adult) opinion, it is, as many have stated, a lame production BUT!...(this is a critical qualifier) my kids (ages 2 & 4) LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this tape, as do their friends!  I don't understand why, but I don't really have to. I just need to know that it is appropriate entertainment for young children and that my kids like to watch it -- and this meets both qualifications, without a doubt.
The songs are decently sung.  They are the traditional, classic songs from our childhood -- ""I've been working on the railroad,"" ""Old MacDonald,"" ""Shoo fly, don't bother me,"" ""Them bones,"" etc.  The viewers are encouraged to get up and do the activities with each of the songs too, which helps avoid the mesmerized couch-potato look that my kids get while watching some videos.  My children especially love it if their parents come in and get involved too.  It just strikes them as incredibly silly and fun.
So look past the 80's style haircuts/clothes and the fact that it feels like you're watching bad community theater, and instead focus on the fact that this will probably become one of your children's favorites, and that they'll learn lots of fun, old songs that you can sing anywhere, anytime.  You don't want them learning to value style over substance anyway, do you?",985132800,,1314,4.711790393013101
330642,5,6301486803,"I got this video from our local library because it was a sing-along.  My 2 year old daughter loves to sing and dance and also loves Clifford the big red dog!  This video, although it is not the cartoon Clifford, is wonderful.  It's interactive, inviting you and your child to get up and dance as well as sing along with the everyone else.  The parents in the other reviews aren't looking at it right.  It's for the kids enjoyment, not the adult.  Since when do we as parents TRUELY enjoy any show, movie or song that our kids end up loving?  It's great fun for kids who love to sing and dance.  I would highly recommend this video.",983404800,,631,4.288135593220339
330643,1,6301486803,"I purchased this video because my 20 month old son loves Clifford.  Well, the Clifford in this video is really just a person in a Clifford costume and looks nothing like the character.  It is also clear that this video was made a very long time ago (15 years), with poor production & props and terrible acting.  The only reason I gave it a score of ""1"" is because for some reason my son likes it  :)  I should have read the other reviews!",982540800,,438,4.166666666666667
330644,2,6301486803,"We were very disappointed with this video~ althoug it appeared to be a good ole' clifford video, it was in fact, something quite diffent.  there is very little of clifford and a lot of rather annoying singing by some dippy guy in a tie...what's going on?",979257600,,254,4.521739130434782
330645,1,6301486803,"...especially when most childrens videos are well made and clever. But Clifford, a favorite in books, doesn't translate to the screen very well. Especially when the huge dog adopts human porportions. His head looks ok, but his body is long and skinny, just like the actor playing him. He sings a variety of childrens songs, circa 1950, like ""Old MacDonald Had a Farm"", and ""Bingo"". The happy family is retro 70's, complete with bad hair and clothes. Considering the price, the makers of this video could at least upgrade the looks of Clifford and the people around him. My granddaughter was so excited about this video, but has only watched it once. Wonder why?",978134400,,661,4.807017543859649

7811840,3,6301486803,"Anthropomorphic dog, check; awkward adults whom I wouldn't trust my kids with, check; group of racially mixed children, check; musical blend of children's old staples, some rockin' new songs and a nod to African music, check.  Standard kid's sing along.

Only disturbing part is when Clifford was upset when the children took his collection of human bones for a round of ""Dry Bones.""  But Kujo got his bones back and all was good.",1440806400,,430,4.863013698630137
7811841,5,6301486803,I really enjoy this video it reminds me of my childhood. Clifford was my favorite cartoon dog and it is fun.,1403136000,,108,4.190476190476191
7811842,1,6301486803,"We found this video at our local library, and my twins wanted to check it out because it was the only Clifford title on the shelf that day.  The first time we put it in, they looked at me askance when the cartoon Clifford suddenly became a guy in a dog suit.  Not what they were expecting.  (I had read the back of the case, however, & knew what I was in for.)

I could set aside the poor production and even the false feel of the acting if they would at least get the words to the songs right, but that seems to be asking too much.  I've never before heard Wheels on the Bus without any wheels!  Shoo Fly does not include the traditional second stanza (""I feel like a morning star""), but a few odd replacement stanzas, instead.  Skip to My Lou is also not the traditional version.  Worst of all, I think, is the version of She'll be Coming Round the Mountain with no horses, no pajamas, no greeting . . . .

Say what you will about the Wiggles -- at least 3 of the 4 men have degrees in early childhood education, don't talk down to the children in their productions, and actually get my kids up and moving.  This Clifford production is false and insipid -- and even my 3-year olds understand that on their own.  The only songs they like to see are This Old Man and Shoo Fly -- they ignore the rest of the video, and ask me to fast-forward through it to the songs they like.",1142726400,,1375,4.112359550561798
7811843,4,6301486803,My sons greatly enjoy the adventures of Clifford! I give this video 4 stars instead of 5 only because it is beginning to show it's age but it is still quite entertaining and educational.,1053043200,,186,4.5
7811844,5,6301486803,I am a child care provider and the children in my care have requested this participatory tape over many years as a first choice.  It has been bumped off the top of the chart recently by the Wiggles which is equally or more obnoxious from an adult view point.  The children aged 1-5 years dance and sing to the many traditional tunes in this tape.  I was actually dissappointed in the animated PBS tape and am searching for another Clifford tape which is participatory before the Wiggles drive me mad!  A new Wee Sing purchase may have to come to the rescue instead.,1045440000,,565,4.456310679611651
7811845,5,6301486803,"I think this video is absolutely wonderful, and I also think it's absolutely ridiculous to cut it down for mentioning ""the rodeo."" I thought being ""PC"" was being phased out. :) This is one of the best children's series I know.",1034640000,,226,4.536585365853658
7811846,3,6301486803,"I can't agree more with reviewer AKT.  This is such a hokey production.  It's embarrassing.  But my 3 year old daughter has LOVED this video for a year.  She sings.  She dances.  Even trying to breakdance like the boys in the video!  Definitely ""interactive"".
I'm glad we finally found this video to purchase.",1008720000,,309,4.716981132075472
