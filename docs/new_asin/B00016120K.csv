1974284,3,B00016120K,"If I wasn't such a GF fan I would have given it 2 stars. If all I wanted were clips of before/after shots I would have bought books. The pleasure of this show was the interaction of everyone and the change of the space. It was watching the process not 2 second soundbites.

Why can't we have complete episodes!!??",1283817600,7,313,4.305084745762712
1974285,5,B00016120K,"This is a must for anyone who loved the Ground Force team of characters. As a Brit now living in the US I craved the famous Britsh humor that the Ground Force team delivers in spades (excuse the pun!).

This DVD is a comprehensive compilation of the team funny moments including many clips that never made it to final cuts of the shows. Interspersed with the best moments clips is the last episode that Titchmarsh hosted. Attention is also given to each of the team members with equal fondness. Including each members favorite gardens.

This is a perfect DVD if you want to reminisce. However if you are looking for episodes of gardening before and afters this is not the DVD for you. Saying that it gave me just what I wanted, a trip down memory lane! This DVD is just a hair under two hours of great entertainment!

Enjoy",1245888000,13,823,4.473333333333334
1974286,5,B00016120K,"I miss this show.  Though the DVD is a brief run through the shows it is so nice to visit with these three (really four) again.  You'll remember all the locations, all the shows and their unique brand of shenanigans.",1243814400,3,216,4.375
1974287,3,B00016120K,I love Ground Force... but I really want to buy the series... This DVD is just a collection of the cast fooling around with bits here and there of them doing several different lawns. It's better than nothing.... but doesn't really give a good overall view of what this show is all about.,1224547200,17,287,4.433962264150943
1974288,2,B00016120K,"I loved Ground Force when it came on BBC America, so I wanted some episodes, but this is just the highlights-no gardening going on!!!
Not what I wanted.",1205107200,10,152,4.464285714285714
1974289,5,B00016120K,"This is the very best series I have ever seen on television before it was put on CD on gardening and landscaping, they make landscaping look so simple and yet they come out with a masterpiece in landscaping.

Excellent.",1171584000,,219,4.615384615384615
1974290,5,B00016120K,"I am from India and can watch this DVD again and again .. it leaves you wanting more.  Alan, Charlie and Tommy are amazing.  I definitely need some one like them!!  I hope more DVDs are released by season or by terrain.",1162512000,4,219,4.166666666666667
1974291,4,B00016120K,"...a ""Best Of"" DVD is not enough!!!  The Ground Force team is amazing -- and especially so during the Titchmarsh years.  I would love to sit and watch these episodes over and over again.  Alan, Charlie, and Tommy are not only garden makeover geniuses, but they've winkled their way into the hearts of BBC America fans.  Please, please, please release Ground Force in season by season compilations!",1141430400,25,397,4.880597014925373
1974292,4,B00016120K,"The BBC television series Ground Force is a whole lot more than a gardening show. Like Trading Spaces, the team has 48 hours to complete their transformation, usually turning a weedy back garden into a thing of beauty in the space of 48 hours. In between this miraculous accomplishment, there is much banter, the occasional argument, and even a rare, full-blown snit. The team is marvelous, the projects imaginative, and the results always spectacular. It's a wonderful show, much more interesting than the subject implies. Great views of Britain abound as well. However, this DVD just whets the appetite for more. DVD releases by season would be much appreciated!",1079913600,42,664,5.10091743119266
8007102,5,B00016120K,"So good it's watchable over and over year to year. If there was more to buy in the USA I'd already have them. SO entertaining, Alan, Tommy, and Charlie feel like your friends who you are happy to see bicker but ultimately fulfill the dreams of regular folks.",1513382400,,258,4.395833333333333
8007103,5,B00016120K,"I love this programme and have been trying to get the full programmes which sadly aren't available.  This is the US version of what was marketed in the UK as ""Ground Force - The Titchmarsh Years"" - so anyone visiting here from the UK (like me) be aware that you may already have it under its Region 2 name.  Its an entertaining ""behind the scenes"" look,  with clips from some of the gardens, but it does not contain full episodes.

Its still nice to visit with Alan, Charlie and Tommy (phwoar), but Dear BBC - please give us the full shows on DVD!",1493942400,,547,4.281553398058253
