3960011,1,B002NTDXQY,"To call this film God-awful is an understatement.  The story was terrible.  The ""acting"" was amateurish.  The special effects (if you want to call them that), were very, very low budget.

I downloaded this mess to my Tivo for 99 cents, and it was still overpriced.  I gave up watching it after about fifteen minutes.",1261180800,,316,4.672727272727273
3960012,1,B002NTDXQY,"About as low-budget as it gets. Two important life lessons, though: 1) Never, NEVER trust a B*tch. &2) If something is pulsing, glow in the dark green? Just leave it where you found it.",1261180800,4,185,4.470588235294118
3960013,1,B002NTDXQY,"Is Steve Railsback forced to remake ""Lifeforce"" again and again like it is some sort of celluloid Flying Dutchman?

This is bad. The script is bad. The acting is bad. The gorey effects are bad.

And no one in this mess takes the Mathilda May part from ""Lifeforce"" - if you know what I mean and I think you do.

I've seen more tension in an overcooked noodle than that on show in this apology for a film.",1261180800,2,403,4.141025641025641
3960014,1,B002NTDXQY,"""Plaguers"" is an awful movie, from start to finish! Stop here, say a silent ""thanks"" that you read this review before you wasted time and money, and find a different movie to watch.

For those that need more, you should know that I really like Grade ""B"" SciFi and Horror movies. So a movie that is basically a zombie movie on a spaceship should be almost perfect, but every element is just so bad that there is literally nothing to recommend it.  Here it is, broken down by element:

* Plot: So many holes you could fly a spaceship through the script. No spoilers from me, a spaceship with a mysterious alien cargo picks up survivors (all female in short skirts) from a damaged ship. Everything is not as it seems, as the body count starts to rise, along with the dead (bwwwaaaahhhhaaahhhaaa).

* Acting: Casting went for attractive women, and there are plenty of attractive women that can act... just not in this movie. The action scenes were just bad and not very suspenseful

* Sets & Wardrobe: I have literally seen better in a high school play

* Makeup: Downright laughable, seriously I literally laughed when I saw the first ""zombie""

* Special Effects: Weak, but would have been acceptable if there were any supporting elements

I usually ignore reviews that say, ""I watched this so you don't have to"", but please heed this warning - I watched this so you don't have to.",1261094400,12,1378,4.573170731707317
3960015,5,B002NTDXQY,"I just finished watching my copy of 'PLAGUERS'!  It's one of the best B-Horror flicks involving alien mutant zombies that actually look good enough to be seen in a big budget film!  I'm glad I took a chance on buying this even though I had read so many bad reviews on other websites haha.  I could definitely see myself watching this again and again.  Sure this flick isn't perfect compared to other sci-fi horrors like 'ALIEN' for example haha..but come on what do you expect?  Plus, I've always liked Steve Railsback's acting.  Other actors/actresses did a fine job as well.

The glowing alien-energy orb in this flick kind of reminded me of the one in 'Heavy Metal', so once I got that stuck in my head, I had a smile on my face while enjoying the movie haha.  Another thing, I give praise to any low-budget flick like this one that doesn't use nudity to ""improve"" itself/sales.  It's not that I'm against nudity in horror films, it's just good to be able to comfortably watch this in front of my parents and in-laws!  This is an ok horror to let your 10-year-old kid watch with you on a Friday night!  Again, awesome make-up effects and good clean fun!  Some gore but not over-the-top if you know what I mean!  Grab the popcorn!",1260576000,6,1232,4.495495495495495

8375376,2,B002NTDXQY,"The Pandora, a spaceship carrying an alien power source diverts from its course back to Earth to answer a distress call from the Diana, filled with four beautiful women who are in reality killer pirates. Their plan to take over the Pandora gets side tracked when they accidentally hit the power source which causes a zombie-like mutation.

The film opens with a teaser that comes very late into the film. The acting and dialogue are in the ""need improvement"" category. The action mostly takes place on the space craft set. The monster acting was also bad.

Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity. Lame cat fight.",1479254400,,605,4.752380952380952

8375379,1,B002NTDXQY,"Ok my fellow flick viewers, there are only 2 things you need to know regarding this movie:

1) Bad zombies in outer space

2) Crew of sexy space pirates and no one gets naked.

There you go,  still wanna see it??",1320019200,,212,4.097560975609756
8375380,1,B002NTDXQY,"Railsback must have had an empty typecasting ""horror/weird"" portrayal week to fit this movie into. Interesting that the remainder of the cast, besides being limited to the usual TV series and video shorts, seem to be living off of cheap horror film gigs for the remainder of their filmography bios.

A list of a few obvious deficiencies:
Too cheap for subtitles.
Two cheap plastic toy models for space ships.
Stars that twinkle/blink on and off and roaring space engine sounds both when viewed from the vacuum of space which as every elementary school student knows is flat out wrong which tells us something about the writer/director.
Space ships made of hardware store air duct tubing and vast quantities of salvage yard heavy steel fabricated to look like a 1940s factory. Seems as if the director failed to learn anything about mass in space.
Script writer who seems enamored with military jargon and swearing to portray toughness and to compensate for something called acting.
Storyline of fluorescent green day-glo thingy turning crew into zombies was dumb. Doesn't even qualify as spoofing anything if that was an intention.",1318636800,,1131,5.080645161290323
8375381,1,B002NTDXQY,"I am not going to say this is a bad movie.(it is).I am not going to say the production values are bad(they are). I am not going to say the acting was bad(it is).

A spacecraft twice the size of Yankee Stadium with an impressive crew of 7-rescues the only survivors of a ship that was attacked by space pirates. the rescued are 4 beautiful women and are soon revealed to be the pirates and they take over the rescue craft.  The balance of this atrocity involves an egg-shaped, green glowing orb which turns the cast into flesh eating space zombies. Since the entire cast is 11-the zombies will be hungry pretty soon.

There is one scene worthy of MST3K.  The only survivir boards an escape pod as the ship blows up.  The escape pod looks and is the size of a coffin. All the escapee needs is a pair of pants, a low cut tee shirt and a portable oxygen tank and mask. There is a surprise and I could issue a spoiler but the movie is so ridiculous no one would care.",1293235200,2,962,4.206521739130435
8375382,2,B002NTDXQY,Futuristic bomb focuses on sexy space pirates and a glowing green ball that turns people into zombies.  Hon hum.  The production values are low low budget.  The acting atrocious and everything about this film reeks.  I felt sorry for Steve Railsback whose once promising career has finally hit rock-bottom.,1273795200,,306,5.183673469387755
8375383,2,B002NTDXQY,Got this one for free so do not mind the movie being so trashy - definitely only for a wet Sunday afternoon when you're in the mood for a bad movie.,1268697600,,148,3.806451612903226
8375384,2,B002NTDXQY,"There's hardly any plot to this SciFi movie.  A spaceship with a small crew has some sort of energy transmitter on board that is needed on earth.  Without any real explanation the crew is then attacked by zombie like creatures, that boarded the ship claiming to be in need of being rescued.  At first those rescued people seem normal but then they suddenly turn into zombies.  And that's it .... really that's all there is to it, except of course the inevitable shootouts and fights between the crew and the zombies.  Really, a bad flick if you ask me.  The plot just stinks, cause besides the shooting nothing ever else happens, for some 80 minutes or so.  Avoid, this turkey, because its not even worth renting it.",1263772800,,716,4.590551181102362
