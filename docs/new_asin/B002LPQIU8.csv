If you're looking for something like that's got great production value like Creepshow 1 & 2 or Trick 'r Treat then you probably won't care much for this but if you love campy, 80's B-movies that are a bit cheesy but fun then you'll probably really enjoy this!",1479168000,2,353,4.2835820895522385
8373224,5,B002LPQIU8,"night train to terror is a cool movie. if you like b-movies this is a good one. lots of nudity, gore and stop motion animation.
the thirsty dead is ok. it was cool to see once.
this dvd is made on demand so its a dv-r. they don't tell you that in the listing.",1468713600,,259,3.814814814814815

SYNOPSES--

NIGHT TRAIN TO TERROR
One word: Feh! Glum Jehovah and amused Beelzebub sit opposite each other in a train's dining booth. Three repulsive stories are presented in-between performances from an early-Madonna influenced pop band, complete with breakdancing vocalist. Ancient spectral black conductor and porter inexplicaby shuffle between cars. Visuals in the first segment alone include lobotomy, amputation, heads preserved in jars of formaldehyde and hanging body parts. Lots of booby shots for ogling snuff perves. (grabs some filth-removing eyewash)

THE THIRSTY DEAD
Dreadful Philippino quickie that's not from some skanky Manila cathouse. Hot babes are captured by crazed cult who will drink their blood so they can stay young. One of the girls looks like a woman in a painting the creepos own, so they instead try to convince her to join them by guzzling a flagon moist and sweet of warm sanguinary fluid. (burp!)

ALPHA VIDEO offers bargain priced, often hard-to-find vintage movies that are ideal for those willing to skip DVD extras. Their transfers show no evidence of restoration, so quality varies from one title to the next, with ""fair to good"" being the average.
