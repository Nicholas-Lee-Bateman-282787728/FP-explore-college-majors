8490018,1,B005ZVE21M,Oh. This took cheesy beyond my expectations. I'm pretty sure I threw up a little.,1448236800,,81,4.466666666666667
8490019,3,B005ZVE21M,"The last few minutes were great, and the out-takes at the credits were good too. The lead into the good parts really sucked. I can't really recommend the movie, even if it might be one of the more brilliant movies I have seen in some time.",1416700800,,239,4.217391304347826

8490022,1,B005ZVE21M,Usually we like Spoof movies but this was the worst of the worst.  I watched the whole thing because I paid for it but never again!!  Not worth the money!!,1337644800,2,155,4.133333333333334
8490023,3,B005ZVE21M,"Randy (David Leo Schultz) is a production assistant who is also narcoleptic. When he passes out he dreams about bad movie spoofs. The film company he works for creates ""B"" grade movie rip offs and is going broke. They decide to make a spoof movie, something that Randy hates. Ellie Gerber shines as Wendy, the adorable girl next door.

I admit I had several LOL moments. For instance in one scene, Chevy Chase asks, ""What makes a great movie?"" Jennifer Sciole replies, ""Paris Hilton."" There were however more scenes that didn't work than those that did. Many of the spoofs were simply not funny.

No sex, no nudity, I don't recall any f-bombs. Some minor sex talk, but this is not a sex comedy. Burt Reynolds and Michael Madsen are in limited roles.",1332547200,,749,4.62406015037594
