7821276,3,6301523067,"This video contains no first-hand veterans accounts, and instead is composed entirely of commentary and WWII era government newsreels. The commentary is by Eric Sevareid and Edwin Newman, two largely acclaimed reporters, so that gives a feeling of importance to the video subject, but its scope is too broad and limits the information to that which has been historically documented, rather than direct veteran stories and recollection.  This gives the video a rather cold, dated interpretation, but is a good view of attitudes and perceptions of the era. It attempts to

cover all aspects of women during the war, including homefront and ""Rosie the Riveter"", but fails to mention much specifically for each branch, and only gives a brief nod to the WAF/WASP and includes no newsreels about them whatsoever. Still, it's a good resource for period material on many of the women's services, and includes newsreels that I had never seen before. It is available new from Amazon and used by other sellers through Amazon, so while it's worth purchasing, I would do so only as used at a discounted price.
