7933809,3,B000059MQ8,"Meifon Li is the 16-year-old head of a private security company. She protects transport ships from pirates. Her ship, the Angel Links, and her crew do not charge for their services. They protect mainly merchants that can't afford the outrageous fee that the other security forces charge. This makes her very unpopular. She becomes the target for greedy merchants, politicians, pirates, and Tao Masters. A series of events causes her past to come back to haunt her. She questions the meaning of her existence and whether she truly makes a difference in the universe.

I bought this anime b/c it's related to the Outlaw Star World. It does have some similarities, including some characters (Duuz & Valeria). Otherwise, this anime is pretty much an unrelated one. The selling points are the connection to Outlaw Star and Meifon Li's chest. Both of which are very enticing propositions. The animation is pretty good. I don't think that it's on par with Outlaw Star animation though. The voice cast is ok. The plot isn't bad either. There isn't really anything great about it though, aside from Meifon Li being nice to look at. Everything about it is pretty average. I did enjoy it, and I'm glad that I have it now; but it's definitely not one of the better anime series out there. I expected much more. Perhaps it'll grow on me more after another watch.",1359244800,,1349,4.789699570815451
7933810,3,B000059MQ8,"If you were like me you loved Outlaw star and needed more. You saw that this was ""from the Outlaw Star universe"" and thought it had to be good. It ended up being just ok though. It follows Meifon Li a sixteen year old girl whose grandfather left her a private security organization named Angel Links (the same one from outlaw star) and adventures ensue. I didn't finish the whole series but only got to volume 3.

The Good: It was cool to be back in the Outlaw star universe. The animation was pretty good.

The Bad: I would have trouble taking orders from a 16 year old girl. I though her pet/sword was a little cheesy. I kept hoping the outlaw star would show up but it never did.

Like I said it was ok but not great. If possible to rent I recommend instead of buying.",1118966400,,771,4.195945945945946
7933811,3,B000059MQ8,"This review is from a guy who has seen every last episode of Angel Links. I'm just reviewing the 1st DVD to give people a head's up about this series.
This is a good show, but it's clear that they did not put as much creative work into this as they did Outlaw Star. I guess we're supposed to be so distracted by Meifon Lee's rack that it shouldn't matter, but there is a severe lack of creativity in this anime. I can appreciate that two of the supporting characters appeared in Outlaw Star, but a talking Dinosaur? I mean c'mon people can't we make Aliens anymore or are we going to settle with walking talking animals that can be found right here on Earth, or at least in the fossil record?
And what's with this cute little pet called ""Taffei"" that transforms into her sword? Can anyone say Ryo-Ohki?
You could tell that they just threw this together and placed it in the Outlaw Star universe. I'm not upset that this show was not like Outlaw Star but Angel Links really had the potential to be different if they stuck to the more unique elements, which they failed to do. Angel Links bounces back and forth from one point to another. Sometimes they'll be focusing on the mystery of Meifon's past, yet in others the main thrust would be on their job of protecting people. This approach makes Angel Links seem like just another typical space show and therefore nothing special.
While Angel Links doesn't break any new ground in the plot department, the visuals definitely rock the house. The art of Angel Links is incredible! Every aspect is beautifully and uniquely done -- from the characters to the ships! There's nothing generic in Angel Links, unlike in some anime where characters and things look more or less the same.
Overall, I'd recommend this to basically anyone who enjoys space-type anime, but don't expect another Outlaw Star, for it doesn't come close.",1015891200,2,1868,4.612612612612613
7933812,3,B000059MQ8,"Call me crazy but I liked Outlaw Star and got sucked into this serries from the same universe. Something about repetative images and way too much of a made for the fan boy nature. Seeing the ship lanch once, okay. In the second episode can we get past the big boat? By the sixth episode I had seen enough of the ship taking off. The story is okay but nothing so exciting that I'd say would make up for the repetive nature.",998956800,2,422,4.158536585365853
7933813,5,B000059MQ8,"First of all im giving it a 5 star rating out of respect for Outlaw Star which was a fantastic series but anyway lets get back to the subject. If your getting this because you absolutly loved Outlaw Star like me, well you can't compare the two because Angel Links isn't even in its league. But, if your getting it because it looks good then let me tell you what it's about.
First off it's about a 16 year old girl named Meifon Li, who's parents died when she was little and was raised by her grandfather who was a wealthy buisness man. But, he eventually died too and his dieing wish was that his grand daughter (Meifon)would make a corporation that is a free space pirate-fighting service.
This DVD contains 4 episodes each 30 min. long, 1. Guardian Angel, 2. A Wasted Fairy Tale, 3. The Proud Dragon, 4. Lief-Living Ether Flier.
Well if you get it I hope you like it, and I hope this review helped you!!!",998006400,4,906,4.3352941176470585
7933814,2,B000059MQ8,"I picked up this title expecting that any product associated with the Outlaw Star universe (which I loved) could not go wrong. I was mistaken.
As an anime, Angel Links is extremely ""girly,"" complete with a bright pink logo, a small, Pokemon-like bat-mouse that lives in the main character's ... and magically turns into a sword (I'm not making this up), and a deputy commander so effeminate he makes Tuxedo Mask look like Ted Nugent. Add to this the main character's romantic interest -- a willowy, sensitive businessman who builds orphanages and saves children -- and a guest character who spends all his time looking wistfully at pictures of his baby, and you have the Harper's Romance of anime.
These elements are not necessarily bad things, by themselves -- if you happen to be a twelve year old girl, you may very well love the show to pieces -- but the series doesn't really offer much beyond that. The Angel Links is more or less invulnerable during space combat, and the only time the main characters are in any danger is when they leave the ship. The Angel Links also features the ""Links Cannon,"" which is the Rouroni Kenshin of space weapons -- one shot and the enemies are all out of commission. The first three episodes generally feature the Angel Links effortlessly trouncing enemies one after another, all without breaking a sweat. Not very dramatic. It doesn't help that the ""launch sequence"" and ""Link Cannon blow-em-up sequence"" are recycled once or twice an episode, giving it a cheap, stock-footage feel.
Even though the first disc features only four episodes, characterization is next to nil. Lei Meifong runs around being cute and playing with the little creature who lives between her ... -- the rest of the crew mostly bark orders or stand around looking confident as the Links Cannon sends off another wave of explosions. To top it off, the best character from the Angel Links cameo of Outlaw Star, Duuz, does nothing but stand around polishing his sword -- there is an amusing bit featuring Duuz scaring some small children, but that's not really worth the price of admission.
I gave this show the best shot I could, knowing that many series have a slow start and take a while to get going -- but Angel Links is so dismal that I doubt I'll ever watch it again, much less pick up the second disc in a faint hope that it will get better.
By itself, Angel Links is a mediocre title with little to offer. It's not poorly made or badly executed, it's just dull and uninteresting. In comparison to Outlaw Star, it comes out looking much worse.",993513600,13,2562,4.682926829268292
7933815,2,B000059MQ8,"Angel Links is a rather ordinary space adventure show about a 16-year old girl with a profoundly out-of-the-ordinary bustline.  That's the first of many bad choices in this show: Meifon, the heroine, is simply absurd looking (and it doesn't help that she has a pet living in her cleavage).  Meifon is the head of Angel Links, a private space security firm located on a frontier world set in the same universe as the previously released (and much superior) Outlaw Star.  In this first disc (containing 4 episodes out of 13 total), she takes her crew from one job to the next, though she works for free in fighting pirates.  There doesn't appear to be much of a continuing storyline, although there's a fairly obvious ""What's Meifon's secret past?"" mystery being set up.  Those who look for quality animation should be aware that Angel Links relies heavily on computer graphics.  This CGI work is poorly integrated with the traditional animation, and the results are far from spectacular.  The traditional animation itself ranges from mediocre to good.
Beyond its objective faults, Angel Links suffers by comparison with Outlaw Star.  Outlaw Star had the advantage of a plot arc running from episode to episode; here, we have only individual episodes.  Second, as far as the English dub goes, there are differences in translation between Outlaw Star and Angel Links as to basic terminology--it's understandable due to different studios being used for dubbing of the two shows, but it's sloppy.  Finally, the characters are far from compelling; there is no one with the personality found in the Outlaw Star cast.  There is only a bouncy girl and some rather non-descript subordinates.",987552000,5,1681,5.0324909747292415
7933816,4,B000059MQ8,"The Angel Links animation is based from its novel Vol. 1 and Vol. 2. The story does not end here and it continues on novel Vol. 3 and Vol. 4. Since the story in Angel Links is based on a unique settings (mostly about technologies and explained in novel, not animation) some of the scenes in animation may seem stupid and unreasonable.
So, if you don't get the chance to read the nevels, most likely the animation will not impress you. However, the music is wonderful and it's pretty worthwhile to but if you can find its soundtrack.
One more word, I regard its ""spaceship melee combat"" idea as a rebel to the Gundam-fans. Since you can make MS's (robots) to do melee thing in the space, and MS's are actually spaceships - why not make them look like ships exactly? You can see how stupid(?) the space melee idea is in the Angel Links / Outlaw Star world.",987292800,2,854,4.377358490566038
