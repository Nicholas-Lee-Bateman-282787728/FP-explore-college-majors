8234613,1,B000Z34FDK,"this was such a piece of crap wanna be art film documentary. I had been wanting to see this for years, finally bought it and what a disappointment! there's barely any tattooing in it, it's really just a bunch of shortly cut clips of paul with rockstars, paul getting his newer shop ready for business and crazy fans spliced together with incoherent nonsense and annoying sound effects. if you're looking to see some tattooing this is not the film for you. most of the scenes with tattooing can be seen on youtube anyway.",1312502400,6,520,4.602150537634409
8234614,5,B000Z34FDK,My son still has not received book after 2 tries. e-mails say it got delivered but mail room says not delivered either time. Who do i beleive.

8234616,1,B000Z34FDK,"This is an awful DVD, they tried to make it too conceptual and it failed! it's boring you just see paul booth being ass kissed and there is no actual work ever done. There is nothing interesting about seeing him having a good time with a all these rick bands.",1269820800,4,259,4.2
8234617,4,B000Z34FDK,"i like tattoo artist and the work they do/lifestyles as i am a tattoo artist myself. theirs a lot of fooling around and hanging out with band members(slayer) and friends, some tattooing, moving from the old location of the shop to the new location as well as a bunch of strange imagery in between all that. i give it 3 1/2 stars out of 5 because it would only let me choose 3 or 4. but 3 1/2 seems proper. thanks.",1265328000,,413,4.111111111111111
