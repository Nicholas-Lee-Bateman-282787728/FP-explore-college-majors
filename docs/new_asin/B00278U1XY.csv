8354263,4,B00278U1XY,It was okay for my Living On Your Own class related to finances for teens.,1497312000,,74,4.0
8354264,5,B00278U1XY,"I purchased this video to use for teaching money management in an emergency shelter for adults.  I would explain the DVD was made for college age, but still was very relevant to what they needed to learn.  Its upbeat modern theme kept the residents engaged in the conversation.  I added my own short fill in the blank answer sheet that went along with the DVD, turned out to be the best class ever for homeless persons.",1408233600,,419,4.4868421052631575
8354265,5,B00278U1XY,"Very informative for the young adult just starting out. Donald Faison narrates and introduces various stories, addressing the issue of college age students going deep into debt as well as how young adults just starting their careers can make a plan for their finances to manage their money. It shows how a single mom (who is more middle-aged) was able to take control of her situation and turn things around to make a better life for herself and her kids. The program also has an upbeat feel to it which may be more appealing than the average financial seminar and it is multicultural. I've purchase a few for gifts for my daughter, niece and nephew. Their ages range from 19 - 22 yrs old.",1384992000,,689,4.564516129032258
8354266,5,B00278U1XY,"This is a great overview of budgeting and saving. Donald Faison talks about his own experiences with money and makes it personal. Also, financial experts chime in with ideas. I recommend.",1363392000,,187,5.064516129032258
8354267,4,B00278U1XY,Well done !  Bought it for my 22.5 daughter.  Education by entertainment - is good. Clearly this video is focused on young people of color.  Now I am researching to find one that is focused on caucasians as that is what she is.  Would be refreshing to see one that is inclusive - all could learn a great deal from this.,1265587200,3,319,4.180327868852459
