8148673,5,B000J0KQXW,"One of the better, more important films on Dr. King, for being ""minor"". Let me explain. There have already been a number
of first rate documentaries that focused on the amazing sweep of King's life and work. And those films (e.g. ""King A Filmed
Record... From Montgomery to Memphis"") are probably better places to start for those who aren't familiar with the amazing
accomplishments of this great, once in a century human being - the rare person who actually visibly changes the tide of history
for the good.

But what this film does that is so valuable, different and moving is, through a combination of interviews with those close to King, home
movies, and footage I've certainly never seen before, along with focusing on some of the speeches and political moments that haven't
been played so many times, is create a portrait of King as a man, not a saint. Vulnerable, human, able to make mistakes (his affairs are
acknowledged, though not dwelt upon or over dramatized), exhausted, pulled in different directions politically.

But in the very act of showing his imperfections, it makes his accomplishments all the more breathtaking, his endless dedication,
and willingness to face danger and death first for his own people, and then for all oppressed and needy people everywhere all the
more amazing and inspirational. If this film shows King was 'just a man', it also implies that what he accomplished is something
available to all of us if we have the courage and fortitude to take up the mantle of what he fought for.

It's important to see King didn't always win, that sometimes he faced situations with no good choices (as when a peaceful march he was
leading started to turn violent and he 'abandoned' the march, because it would have been a betrayal of everything he stood for to be seen as
being a part of the violence, even though his leaving lead to charges of being cowardly). It somehow makes the odds he really fought all his
life even more clear. He wasn't a magician, he wasn't God, he was just a person who put the good of others, and his beliefs in non- violent
change ahead of his own life.

It's wonderful to see him laugh, to see him with his family, to hear about his personal reactions to winning the Nobel Prize for peace, his
struggling with how to extend his movement from small city south to big city north, from a movement for black civil rights, to a movement
to raise the lot of all the poor and ill used - costing him tremendous political capitol and some popularity at the time.

This film manages to make one of our great heroes human, without diminishing one bit his heroism. And that's a lofty and worthwhile
accomplishment.",1485648000,,2661,4.677350427350428
8148674,4,B000J0KQXW,"""Citizen King"" does not pick up the story of MLK from the beginning.  Instead, it is assumed the viewer already knows a thing or two about Martin Luther King.  We are transported back to 1963 and taken through the last five years of King's life.  It is an interesting and fascinating journey.

Included are King's struggles and triumphs with the civil rights movement, the Civil Rights Act, and the Voting Rights Act.  But lesser-known (at least by me) were King's attempts to broaden his reach and his impact.  He is also shown fighting poverty and coming out strongly against the Vietnam War (something which crippled the good relationship he enjoyed with LBJ).  But that very act showed that he was mostly a man of principle - King would not let his friendship with the US president interfere with his feelings about situations he felt were wrong and unjust, including that war.  He spoke against it knowing that president Johnson would not be pleased.

King is not deified here, however.  We are shown that he was not universally loved by the African-American community, some disagreeing with his non-violent ways.  And King's extramarital affairs are discussed here, although somewhat briefly.  But mostly he is rightly celebrated for being a visionary and an engine of change, change that was sorely needed, and long overdue, in America.

Four stars.",1169164800,,1356,4.973333333333334
