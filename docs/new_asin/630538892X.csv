7888730,5,630538892X,This movie was fantastic. Despite the brutual way Michael Pare's character ended. This has to be one of my fave movies of his. Any Michael fan would throughly enjoy this one. He has such a different look about him and he doesn't play the hero type. In fact he plays a bit of  a mean character.but you couldn't help but love him anyhow. A must see for Pare fans..,1193097600,,362,4.246376811594203

But there's something nifty and gritty without trendy slickness that makes this particular Michael Pare action film so much better than most. Pare is at his best here, playing Ricco Burke as a low end thug trying to overcome his life and make something out it. The great thing about the picture is it avoids the cliches you'd expect from this set up -I won't say more.
Inventive and controlled direction credited to George Medeluck may also become a trademark of the producing team behind it. More on that in a moment:
The cinematography reminds me of an early seveties style- something deliberate, and that feels appropriate, the whole film has a seventies-ish ""Mean Streets"" feel. Austin Pendleton is powerful as the victim, and hockey star Tie Domi puts in a small, but truly fun cameo. This is a cool little picture.
For you fans of isn't is a small world - some related trivia I gleaned from the credits. I noticed the names Daniel Dor and G Phillip Jackson on the producing credits -those are the guys who previously did low low budget but inventive mainly sci-fi flicks like Replikator, (Ned Beatty) Carvers Gate (Michael Pare) Falling Fire, (Michael Pare again!) 2103 The Deadly Wake (Malcolm McDowel and guess what, Micheal Pare!). There's a connection between all these films, ""Men of Means"" may be the best (but I'm not a big sci-fi guy so who's to say). This, I think is the same team doing that whispered about series ""Starhunter"". If ""Men of Means"" is a sign of their progress I'm looking forward to the series, even if Sci-fi isn't my strong point.",976492800,2,1682,4.705084745762712
