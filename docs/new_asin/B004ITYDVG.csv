4388209,3,B004ITYDVG,"As an American with an appreciation of French cinema, I enjoyed ""Mesrine: Public Enemy #1"" (MPE1), but wouldn't rank it alongside the best gangster or crime movies from the U.S. or the U.K.  The filmmakers do an excellent job of recreating the scenery, clothing and hairstyles of the 1970s, and the movie has its moments of suspense.  However, American audiences are likely to compare it to the many thrillers that fill our cineplexes, and MPE1 doesn't quite measure up.  The gunfights and car chase scenes are just not as powerful; in fact, when a cheap Renault getaway car gets spun around and dented in MPE1, I chuckled a bit at the thought of such an underpowered car being used by criminal masterminds in a life-or-death situation.  I guess it's better than a Vespa...

The primary reason why ""Mesrine: Public Enemy #1"" can't compare to over-the-top thrilling crime movies such as ""The Dark Knight"" is that MPE1 is actually based on factual people and events.  There really was a Jacques Mesrine in France who robbed banks, murdered several people, and escaped from prison multiple times.  MPE1 does adhere to the basic facts of Mesrine's actual life story, at least as it is captured on Wikipedia.

Vincent Cassel gives a decent performance as Mesrine.  At times Mesrine's viciousness comes through, but much of the rest of the time Mesrine is clowning around or strutting about with his chest puffed out.  I wondered if Cassel was perhaps playing the role a bit too much for laughs, but maybe this is the way that Mesrine really was.  The chief question posed by the film is: why did Mesrine do it?  At times he claims to be a revolutionary, at times he wants revenge for the suffering he and others endured in prison, at times he lusts after the money, and at other times he just appears to be doing it for the thrills. It is up to the viewer to draw a conclusion.

Ludivine Sagnier achieves absolute perfection as Syliva, Mesrine's favorite ""objet d'affection"".  She doesn't make her appearance until halfway through the film, but oh what an entrance it is.  Sylvia instantly captivates Mesrine, and Sagnier does the same with every viewer who appreciates female beauty.  In all her scenes she is absolutely gorgeous, and one can see why Mesrine wanted to shower Sylvia with jewels.  Sylvia herself is an interesting character, and her priorities and feelings towards Mesrine are debatable until the very last scene of the movie.  Certainly Mesrine is the more famous character, but I think an interesting movie could also have been made of Sylvia's life leading up to and beyond her relationship with Mesrine.

The supporting cast is mostly excellent, especially Mathieu Amalric, who gives a haunting portrayal as a criminal associate of Mesrine's, and Georges Wilson, who gives a wonderfully understated performance as an elderly kidnap victim.  The version of the film I saw was dubbed in English, which was slightly distracting, but probably less so than subtitles would have been, especially in the action sequences.  All in all I would recommend MPE1 if you are interested in the Jacques Mesrine story or if you would enjoy a trip back to France in the 1970s.  But if you are purely in the market for an escapist thriller, there are more thrilling options out there.",1352419200,,3281,4.85278276481149
4388210,5,B004ITYDVG,"This is a great gangster film, in league with Scarface and Goodfellas. Mesrine was quite a character in real life, and this movie based on his autobiography is exciting and fascinating. Vincent Cassel burns up the screen as Mesrine, a hotheaded, violent, but at the same time, tender and emotional man. He became somewhat of a folk hero in France for thumbing his nose at the judicial and penal systems. He beat both systems numerous times, and this movie shows how he did it. Highly recommended!",1351814400,,496,4.77906976744186
4388211,3,B004ITYDVG,"MESRINE: PUBLIC ENEMY #1 is a sequel, or actually Part II of MESRINE: KILLER INSTINCT. It is important to note this fact because for the casual viewer who picks up this DVD first there will be a lot of background story missing.  Apparently there is somewhat of a cult of Mesrine devotees, so powerful was his image as the most devious criminal of the 1960s -1970s in France.  Or perhaps it is the media that makes criminals like Charles Manson, Bonnie and Clyde, John Gotti, Al Capone,  John Dillinger etc etc 'heros' to the public.  But if examining the lives of such beings entertains you then this film may register.

Apparently the first film in this biopic showed the development of Jacques Mesrine (Vincent Cassel) as he becomes a bank robber, kidnapper, jail breaker, etc, but this film starts with Mesrine in court form which he escapes and then proceeds to rob banks and kill people and eventually end up believing in his own grandeur as Public Enemy #1.  The film was written by Abdel Raouf Dafri and director Jean-Franois Richet who obviously are more concerned with setting up ambushes and escapes and robberies than with character development.  The is one well-written  scene in the film - Mesrine sneaking into a hospital where his father (Michel Duchaussoy) is dying that is true drama, but the rest is rather uncontrolled raucous crime. Vincent Cassel is such a fine actor that he is able to bring to life this atrocious character (having not seen Part 1 leaves any advantage that film may have given to his character development and why this actor suddenly has a beer gut, etc).  He is abetted by Ludivine Sagnier as his pickup girlfriend Sylvia, Mathieu Almaric (another very fine French actor) as his accomplice Franois Besse, Samuel Le Bihan, G&eacute;rard Lanvin, Olivier Gourmet, and Georges Wilson.

The film is overly long (133 minutes) to tolerate all action/no story, but one factor remains: Vincent Cassel's performance is intriguing, right up to his grisly death scene.  Not for the faint of heart or for viewers who appreciate a script with a story. Grady Harp, April 11",1303862400,6,2099,4.851540616246498

8431195,5,B004ITYDVG,"Based on a true story.  This is a story gangland french style J.Mesrine was a fellow from a decent middle class family that went to war for his country to Algeria the then French colony,  of course being battle hardened, he returns back to France & meets up with an old friend who basically takes him to a goodfella... if you get my drift... & the amazing true story of this guy begins.  It's in 2 parts, excellent Acting all around, VINCENT CASSELL,  J. DE .P. AS He used to say often only when I say kill me they will. Gritty,  loved it can compete with many a top Gangster flicks.  Have a gander, who knows if you like it, add this definitely to your collection!!!. French- English- sub's. It was a fine purchase",1423526400,,715,4.298507462686567

8431200,5,B004ITYDVG,"Ah...the French just have a way about them.  Example:  the gifted actress Catherine Deneuve - so breathtaking/so French.  Vincent Cassel 's a ""can't take your eyes off him"" actor & intriguingly attractive.  As Mesrine he's unbelievably sure of himself/egotistic/charming/irresponsible/sentimental & indiscriminate killer w/a sense of humor.

Reviewer K. Harris tells it all elegantly.

Saw the 1st part of ""Mesrine"" & not all that impressed, but the 2nd was spellbinding.  Had no idea it has a cult following.  Thought ""Grey Garden's"" a gleaming gem & learned later it has a cult following too.  A fan of big time criminals considered heroes?  Imagine  ""Bonnie & Clyde"" on massive amounts of steroids...",1412294400,,703,5.3577981651376145

8431203,4,B004ITYDVG,This is the second part. It was very violent and bloody. It was an interesting look at the development of this criminal and how he got to his end. Subtitled and definitely not for children.,1385683200,,189,4.428571428571429
