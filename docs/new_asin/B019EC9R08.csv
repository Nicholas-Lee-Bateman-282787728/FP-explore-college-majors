7571167,5,B019EC9R08,Had no idea where the story was going till the end.  Couldn't quite figure it out.  Satisfying movie but edgy for me compared to Richard Gere's early movies.  I like his films and all think Dakota Fanning is super beautiful,1452902400,,223,4.525

7571236,3,B019EC9R08,"At least Gere finally got help after he made such a fool of himself in this movie. It's a story of many families nowadays, most don't change though. The whole movie was about him, not a very nice person.",1526428800,,203,4.230769230769231
7571237,5,B019EC9R08,Good movie. Gere rarely disappoints. Heart tugger.,1526342400,,50,6.285714285714286
7571238,5,B019EC9R08,"I don't quite understand why this movie isn't more popular.  The topic of opioid addiction is high on everyone's list, yet watchers rate this as a yawner.  The scene with the doctor was an incredible performance by Richard Gere.  His angst and pleading with the doctor was full of emotion.  The lead up to that scene made me feel like I needed drugs too.  When his character was reaching out to the doctor, I shouted, yes!  Wake up people, realize that the real villains are the doctors and this movie brought it to light!  Great story and terrific acting.  Fantastic film  correctly depicts how addiction ruins lives.",1526256000,,618,4.700934579439252

7571270,2,B019EC9R08,"Giving it a two only because I love Richard Gere and his acting ability!  However its one of those movies you keep watching, waiting for the good part to start but unfortunately it never does.  This is the second movie I've seen recently with Fanning and I can't seem to get past her ''always looking like a starved drug addict' appearance.  Would love to see a 'great movie' with Gere as was his past movies.",1525651200,,409,4.426666666666667
7571271,2,B019EC9R08,"The film never takes off because it wanders between genres--namely, drama, thriller, and psychological examination. Gere looks like an aging caveman in this movie, complete with long gray locks and white beard, closely resembling the way Steve McQueen looked in An Enemy of the People, a sure sign that his own career was in a downward spiral. The same thing appears to be happening to Gere here, as he attempts to mug and smirk his way through this less than enthralling material, hoping his good guy charm will carry the day. Alas, it all falls flat, as the haunted, guilt-ridden character out to make amends storyline reaches an abrupt and forced conclusion. The director deserves blame for that, of course, but films like this do not do anything to advance the once promising career of Richard Gere, which appears to be in a tailspin at this point.",1523491200,,852,4.802721088435374

7571274,2,B019EC9R08,"The story line was OK. The film could have had so much depth, but it just turned out to be a cheap, cartoon like viewing experience, totally devoid of what could have realistically happened given these circumstances. It's winter here. I was bored one night, so I watched it free on Amazon Prime. If you have something better to do, don't waste your time watching this shallow film.",1520380800,3,381,4.617647058823529

7571276,4,B019EC9R08,"Richard Gere is wonderful in this movie.  He is a man who gets what ever he wants, at any cost, until he meets up with his best friend's adult daughter.  Now he has to learn how to play fair in order to be accepted.  I would definitely recommend watching this.  I have never seen Richard Gere in a movie where he is not in total control.",1515456000,3,337,4.0606060606060606
7571277,4,B019EC9R08,"Brilliant portrayal of powerful narcissist and the destruction he can wreak.
The story line got a bit confused and Dakota Fannings portrayal of a pregnant woman has her constantly holding her belly (every scene she is in, but 1), but definitely a worthwhile film.
Not sure I agree with the ending but its an attempt to tie it up.",1512000000,2,329,4.593220338983051

7571279,1,B019EC9R08,"I am a fan of both Richard Gere and Dakota Fanning.  It's too bad they had to team up for this strange snoozer.  It flops on the ground like a fish out of water and you don't know where it is going most of the time.  I hate being critical of a movie as I am no actor or director, but I do know what I like and I like to be entertained and made to think where movies are concerned.  The only thing I kept thinking throughout this dud was, ""What's for dinner"".  Don't buy this movie or even check it out from the library.  Not worth your time in the least.",1508630400,,554,3.8584070796460175
7571310,4,B019EC9R08,"This was a good movie and kept me interested (not an easy thing).  I have always been a fan of Richard Gere and was happy to see him playing a totally different character than what he is usually type casted,  The acting was good in this movie.  Richard did a good job as an addict,  I just think that now a days, enough time is not spent on developing characters.  There should have been more time spent on what happened after the accident and what Molly had experienced and done for the last 5 years.  It really wasn't clear if Molly really knew what had caused the accident.  I think expanding those parts of the movie would have made it a much better movie.  I also want to mention that the blending of the past with the present was done well.",1503792000,2,746,4.24113475177305
7571311,1,B019EC9R08,"This was a bad movie. The plot was horrible and the acting by Richard Gere was stifling, forced, and over the top. It was hard to watch because of Richard Gere's overbearing and annoying character. He seemed to be overacting. Interspersing drugs and alcohol into the story made the movie a depressing spectacle. The guy definitely has issues as will be seen as the movie unfolds. The other actors were okay and believable. But you feel sorry for them because of the behavior of the character of Gere. I also did not like the 60's soundtrack of music for this film. It seemed out of place. I do not recommend this movie at all.",1502409600,,626,4.5

7571313,4,B019EC9R08,"Amazing performance by Gere...one of his best in recent years. He definitely still has it. I love Dakota Fanning...she's amazing.  The guy who played her husband I'm not as familiar with but he gave a really solid performance. That's this movie's strong suit, the performances of the principals. It's a shame Cheryl Hines' part wasn't bigger.. she's an excellent actress and I love to see her at play. I recommend this for those who like character driven films. While the movies as a whole isn't bad the script isn't the shinning star.",1500076800,,535,4.815217391304348

  I loved this movie. I think Richard Gere did a magnificent performance here as well, and the entire pace of the movie, the main character's escalation especially, was spot on. Excellent work, really.",1496707200,4,404,4.52054794520548

7571354,3,B019EC9R08,"What a mess! Richard Gere is so tremendously talented, and he had the absolute misfortune of playing against two millennial robots. Fanning and James were lifeless, entitled, thoroughly unlikeable and dispassionate -- ennui personified. Gere carried what there was of a plot; the other two dragged along stupefied. Thus, a mediocre script; bad casting, bad acting. Couldn't stand it, and it did hold promise with a pinch of script tweaking; just not with these two blobs. Some inert humans may find this 'ok'; hence the stars.",1493424000,2,526,5.127906976744186
7571355,3,B019EC9R08,"A wealthy philanthropist (Gere) wrestling with the guilt of an accident ingratiates himself into the lives of a young couple as a form of penance. The Benefactor is a misguided film, unsteady on its feet. It positions itself as a thriller but instead delivers a character study of addiction mashed up with half baked melodrama. The pieces simply don't fit. The tone is uneven but Gere delivers some very strong moments. If the film stayed with his addiction story, its strongest element, this could have been an AARP production of The Lost Weekend. Instead, the parallel story of the young couple emerges, both dull and ill conceived and which offers little to no interest for the audience. Gere fans may find enough to enjoy but the movie gets stuck in the mud and refuses to ask its writer/director for help.",1491177600,,810,4.792857142857143
7571356,4,B019EC9R08,I was  kinda hopping for him to try and do something at the end like take the baby but the movie is pretty good all things considered. This is quite on target when it comes to withdraw... not so much with the medicine aspect. Overall is still a good movie.,1490400000,,256,4.12

7571359,5,B019EC9R08,Richard Gere & hot guy from Divergent + spiritual premise = excellent movie.,1488412800,,76,4.923076923076923
7571400,3,B019EC9R08,"The Benefactor has Richard Gere playing a guy called Franny, who someone not only got over the burden of having a weird old lady name growing up, but became a billionaire too.  We viewers have no idea how he made his billions as we're never told, but basically he owns a hospital and is obviously quite powerful in the medical world and you would imagine greater business one.  But Franny doesn't have great social skills, he's basically a third wheel to a doctor and his wife.  Again why they put up with him jumping into their bed at night and things like this is never explained, but you assume it's because he's a billionaire and these two know their careers could benefit and more importantly come to an end, if they don't play along.  But it isn't long before a car crash allows them to finally escape him and results in him being the only one still alive of the trio.  He became a recluse with many in his hospital having never actually seen him in person over the decades since.  That is until the daughter (Dakota Fanning) of his deceased couple friends, now grown up  contacts him and asks for a favour.  Her boyfriend likes wearing scrubs around their house, but has no job, can he get him an interview in his hospital. Franny can do more than that! He just gives him a job, and throws himself back into the hospital board scene, he even gets a haircut after he catches on his staff whispering about him.  But a job for his friends' daughter's boyfriend isn't enough, he's got to buy her back her old house and whatever else his money can do to make her life better.  He obviously wants to pick up as a third wheel where he left off with her parents, but the boyfriend isn't as keen, in fact he's not real keen at all.

The Benefactor could have been a creepy thriller, or scary thriller, with a guy obsessed with being their best friend, maybe who even gets angry and decides to destroy their lives when they reject him.  But it's not.  Instead Franny is a pathetic guy, he's addicted to drugs and a ridiculous part of the movie is him self imploding because his local chemist and his doctor won't give them to him.  Now this makes no sense, he's a powerful owner of a hospital, surely someone is afraid enough for their job to give these to him, even if was just, you know, I'm going to go to the bathroom and I'm really busting so I don't have time to lock this door to the tablet shelves, I really hope no one goes to the third row from the middle aisle and takes any of the green bottle with the blue stripe pills.

Richard Gere does a fairly decent acting performance.  But ultimately the Benefactor was pretty slow and boring.  It would have benefited from more interesting stuff that was left out being in, such as how he became rich, maybe more of his creepy third wheel with the parents footage, as they left the film too early.",1487289600,,2849,4.365530303030303
7571401,5,B019EC9R08,"Wow.  Richard, the best I believe I have ever seen you do...much is due to the writer, but I, as your contemporary say you nailed it...thank you for an absolutely superb performance.  You could have walked away from this script, but you did not, you embraced it and I want to thank you for that...anyone reading this review, if you want to see what is most certainly the quietest finesse of acting, watch this film. Are you familiar with pain and guilt and addiction and the need to be loved?  Watch this film.  I am in awe.

7571508,3,B019EC9R08,"I had more fun imagining backstory for Mr. Gere's character than I had watching the film. I felt the writer often stepped right up to the line and was afraid to jump into the abyss. Fanny is, in my story, a man much like Matt Damon's character in The Talented Mr. Ripley. How Did he get rich? We don't know; this unanswered question leaves a lot to an active imagination. I also rewrote the ending. Much darker in my story. Too bad they went with the Hollywood ending. I don't want to spoil it.
All in all, this movie had such potential and the writing just choked the life out of it. No fault of the actors. Stellar performances. Mr. Gere has the potential to bring fire, as he proved in Mr. Jones, yet again, the writing. I enjoyed the film simply for the actors. The three stars are for them and I deducted two for the writing.",1474502400,4,830,4.2594936708860756

7571753,4,B019EC9R08,"I had to give my opinion after reading the ""Boring"", 1 Star reviews here. The title may be the problem. This is a film about the life of an addict and a great depiction of how addition is not judgmental and nobody is safe from its destruction of anyone's life and character, no matter how rich or powerful.  This is a fantastic view into the life of an addict. Richard Gere is outstanding and believable. While it is implausible that Franny couldn't get a script of Morphine, while owing a hospital, and having many resources for an addict to continue his downward spiral, the journey of one addict is genuinely seen and well done by Gere. Gere deserves more accolades than he has received. I emphatically disagree with those who claim he has always gotten by on his looks. Yes, like most actors that had a huge part of his early films, but unlike many of the handsome actors Gere has never pretended to be younger. He has never hidden his grey hair or tired to get by on his looks alone since he's aged. His recent films show he relies on his acting ability and not a facelift or dye job. I have been a fan since my early teens and to be frank, I was disappointed to see he has aged, and is no longer ""Looks"" like the young sexy man of his earlier career films. However, he has shown his sexiness in his keen ability to portray many characters and make them real. I may be one of the few, but George Clooney's recent decision to quit acting because he is aging is a true example of Narcissism. Is his looks that important as an actor he has to quit and hide? That is an example of one who feels he used his looks. I love George Clooney as an actor and it hasn't been for his looks. Just a thought to support my opinion. This movie may not be the best or an award winner as best picture. However, it is well worth the time and for those who do not understand why I am saying this after watching The Benefactor, is because I don't believe they understand addiction or the destruction of the soul that drug addition causes. Or perhaps they have and it's too hard to accept. Gere is outstanding in his portrayal of an addict.",1465516800,7,2122,4.278606965174129
7571754,1,B019EC9R08,"Brilliant scenery and architecture cannot save this incredibly disappointing waste of time.
As a friend of mine says, ""I should have saved the electricity used to watch this movie and donated it to some unfortunate family who needs the power"".
I think that sums it up.
Major plot incongruities and untimely(or totally non-existent) expositions made it impossible to suspend disbelief and brought me out of the narrative on numerous occasions.
 If you can't enjoy the story or identify with any of these very superficial characters,  either to loathe or love them, there's little point to spending time you can never replace on any film.

7571792,4,B019EC9R08,"It's hard to watch a narcissist in full bloom but Gere had it down, not entirely different from his work in Mr. Jones. the writing lacked some maturity.  For example,  I didn't find his addiction behavior very believable because the character was smart, rich, certainly worldly and quite familiar with hospitals etc. and the addict behavior was very stupid. Certainly he knew the basics of medical ethics  and the pigeonholed behavior that would make his attempts at manipulation for drugs ridiculous. Drug addicts are much more manipulative and would not want to trigger red flags with his every move as he did. At least we didn't see him stealing RX pads from his doctor.  I was disappointed that the script was focused on Gere's RX problem , rather than looking at how he creepily emasculated the husband, calling him a child's name constantly, trying to buy everyone in an to  attempt to take over the little family. They don't fix narcissism in rehab.  It can't be fixed. So now, he will get out and soberly try to take over the family. The other actors did well, especially the husband who saw exactly what the old man was doing and trying to manipulate the couple by giving them extravagant gifts and a job to create obligation to him.

I saw some reviews that said it was boring, must not have been paying attention because each character had several different issues they were dealing with.  Most interesting was Richard Gere's portrayal not only of a meddling ""rich uncle"" but also as an opiate addict.  There is such a huge stigma right now concerning opiates and their usage for pain patients that I took notice of this facet of the story.  In fact I think it actually had a lot to do with Richard Gere's character and his personality.  In my opinion this movie had a lot more to do with Richard Gere's character and his addiction to pain meds than it really did his ""meddling"".

Now, addicted to pain killers and trying to hide it Franny begins to spend more and more time with his old friend's newly married daughter and her husband (James). The more Franny tries to help the more they want him to leave them alone. In my review for Time Out Of Mind I stated that I never thought Richard Gere was all that good of an actor until that movie. This movie he takes another step forward and he is even better in this one. He plays the character on the edge of likable and creepy, moving flawlessly between both and really making you feel sorry for him and concerned about the others at the same time. That is a hard thing to portray. Overall, the movie itself isn't bad I I did like it, but the reason to watch is for Richard Gere's performance (I never thought I would say that).

7572317,4,B019EC9R08,"The one sentence synopsis at the top of the page is somewhat misleading. ""A newly married couple are forced to navigate the all-consuming interest of a powerful, mysterious, and possessive philanthropist""; although not untrue, this sounds more ominous than it turns out to be. From that description I was half expecting Richard Gere to pull a Jack Nicholson, caving in Dakota Fanning's bathroom door with an axe and yelling, Here's Johnny! Nope. The craziest behavior in The Benefactor is Richard Gere dropping MDMA with stud muffin Theo James.

What I learned from The Benefactor:
 Don't slice your finger in an attempt to get opiates from the ER
 Don't distract your friends while they're driving, you might get them killed
 Don't cause a scene in a children's hospital unit, you'll wake up a bunch of kids
 Don't pressure your employee to take ecstasy with you
 You can dress however you want when you are rich (I had forgotten this to be a truism)

What I already knew:
Dakota Fanning is the real deal. She's been in several blockbusters yet is not above doing lower profile films when it strikes her fancy. And unlike a number of her peers who started very young, Dakota remains an actress of the highest caliber. Somewhat strange to see her as an adult if you watched her as a little kid in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Man-On-Fire/dp/B00B99SIVE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Man On Fire</a>&nbsp;(with Denzel Washington) and then in her astounding, controversial, heartbreaking role a few years later (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hounddog/dp/B00TUC388U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hounddog</a>), and then as a rebellious young teen in the 2009 supernatural action spy thriller&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Push/dp/B001OQCVII/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Push</a>&nbsp;alongside Chris Evans (Captain America).

Other stuff:
 The Benefactor was filmed in Philly: a rough town, but one with character. More movies should be shot there!
 At it's core, substance abuse is a main theme (if you don't like that idea, The Benefactor may not be for you).
 If you become severely agitated about abrupt and ambiguous movie endings, The Benefactor probably won't upset you much.",1452902400,14,2301,5.921450151057402
7572318,4,B019EC9R08,"As ""The Benefactor"" begins we immediately see a glimpse of a tragedy, one so severe that it is entirely life changing for Franny (Richard Gere). The film then jumps ahead five years as Olivia (Dakota Fanning) gets in touch with him to say that she is marrying and wishes that he would be back in her life. Franny is ecstatic at the news of her wedding to Luke (Theo James), a Medical Doctor, and that Olivia is soon to be a mother. Her connection to Franny is seen throughout the film as the trauma at the outset sets the stage for him to thoroughly ingratiate himself into their lives. Being that he is a wealthy philanthropist, there is no monetary cost too high for him to pay or personal boundary of the couple too important for him to cross. He is their self-appointed benefactor and is now going to make their world wonderful because he can and definitely will not take no for an answer. It is their world according to Franny and what shows is desperate in the first degree.

Franny is a study in contradiction. He is a man on the verge of imploding while being exuberant, hedonistic, manic and grandiose on the outside but emotionally scarred, traumatized and in great physical pain inside. Franny is deeply in denial, especially while he's alone and self-medicating with substances he is thoroughly addicted to. He then takes his 'goodtime Charlie' personality out to live his life through intruding on the lives of the new couple while granting no regard to Luke or even Olivia's protests. He now feels that he has something to live for again and an actual shot at redemption through this couple whom he loves and the hospital of which he sits on the board of directors. Actually, the way Franny puts it, I am the board. He lives large, he gives large and he consumes large being unable and unwilling to stop. Everyone around Franny, from his family in Olivia and Luke, colleagues, and doctor are beginning to know that there is an upcoming crash unfolding which he continually denies.

Writer and director Andrew Renzi put together a dichotomous character study in the life of his subject and Richard Gere wears it well. On the one hand, Franny is loving and caring when it comes to the couple or each of them individually. His sincerity quite easily shows through, but at what cost on the other hand? Frannys days would lead to an obvious conclusion without an action put in place and Renzi adds the obvious stumbling blocks for this to progress to a speedier conclusion. At times, it is difficult to find sympathy for Franny while he remains so intrusive as he digs in his heals concerning the couples happiness, and how it should go according to him. The necessary empathy did come through for me the more the film reaches back to the beginning and the suffering he has endured. What drives Franny is that obvious sense of urgent desperation, but for what reason? Many fans of Richard Gere will probably appreciate this character of Franny who is more than painfully overboard and the psychosomatic issues he is still facing due to the overwhelming traumatic event.",1452902400,19,3078,4.677121771217712
