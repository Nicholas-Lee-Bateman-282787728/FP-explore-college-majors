8293236,5,B001DHE9PQ,"Animation great. (Contemporary cartoons suck!) Story great, Hey it's Around the world in 80 days! Plus this has the best version of Mr Fixx I've seen. The down side, voice acting is rather poor, especially Paspatu, who seems like he's yelling even when he's talking. However the biggest disappointment is that they didn't finish the story. Yeah that's a big one.",1459123200,,362,4.950819672131147
