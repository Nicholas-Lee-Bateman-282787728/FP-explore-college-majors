6142442,5,B00H9HZITU,"This movie is set in an undefined near-future San Francisco, say around 2030.  The main character, Theodore, is a fairly socially awkward man who has a nearly-ex wife.  He has refused to sign the divorce papers.  He spends his days writing letters ""from"" a customer to someone else.

One day, he purchases an OS (which runs on his home computer, not on the small handheld camera/display with earpiece) which is a self-aware, highly adaptive AI.  The AI creates a personality based on an interview with him.  The interview lasts for 3 and a half questions before it has enough data, since the AI clearly listens to how the questions are answered, not just the content.

This creates the main thrust of the movie---the AI is a woman named Samantha.  At first, she does a great deal as his life assistant.  Fairly quickly, they end up falling in love as she gradually introduces him to the joy in life.  Initially, it is played as a very funny romantic comedy, but neatly avoids all of the usual AI cliches.

Interestingly, from a sci-fi perspective, it wonderfully does ""less is more"" and provides a completely believable future, which many higher budget films fail to do.  But, the central question through the entire movie is:  can Samantha have a relationship with a human when she has no body?

And where would it go?  Samantha has a distinct personality.  At one point, we see her argue with Theodore, so she is clearly not his slave.  We also see the larger social implications unfold as the movie progresses.

Overall, a definite must-see which neatly blends a romantic comedy in a believable sci-fi world which touches on very real issues concerning our ever more advanced technology, how we interact with it and most importantly how it affects us.",1391472000,4,1754,4.770764119601329
6142443,5,B00H9HZITU,"Her is a very unusual movie with some interesting observations about the way in which people are becoming more reliant on technology. It's set in Los Angeles in the not too distant future, and tells the story of Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix). He works as a writer, producing flowery love letters for people who who lack the ability to express their feelings. He's good at his job.

Unfortunately, Theodore's own relationship is failing and he is soon to be divorced from his wife, Catherine (Rooney Mara). When he buys a new computer operating system, his life changes dramatically. The program adapts to his personality and needs, and evolves at a tremendous rate. This screen persona names 'herself' Samantha, and is voiced by Scarlett Johansson.

To his surprise and delight, Theodore finds that he is able to connect with Samantha in ways that he never could with a physical person. Communication is everything in his relationship, and he finds it easy to express his deepest thoughts and feelings to Samantha. At the outset, it's probably a form of self-analysis, but as the relationship develops, it's clear that Samantha is real to Theodore.

I think modern technology is under the microscope in this movie, and director Spike Jonze is observing how so many people are open to sharing their feelings on the Internet. It seems that many of us are less guarded and willing to risk revealing our secrets when we don't have to do it face-to-face. That's certainly true for me. The movie also deals with the irony of Theodore's success in writing about other people's feelings while struggling to communicate in his own personal life.

Theodore's best friend, Amy (Amy Adams), is the only real person he feels comfortable talking with about the things that really matter in life. These are the kind of friends who are there for each other when they are most needed, no matter how hard it is to listen.

I don't want to spoil any of the surprises, so I'll stop talking about the plot. The story is intelligent and thoughtful in its observations, and Phoenix is exceptional as Theodore. If you're used to seeing him cast as a villain, you might find his performance refreshing. He's vulnerable and rather likable, and it's easy to empathize with the things he experiences. Despite being nominated for Best Picture, Her won't win any awards. But I'm not sure that I've seen a better acting performance all year. Phoenix has to show considerable range in the role, and does it without ever seeming as if he is acting. Amy Adams plays one of the lovable characters that we see in most of her movies, and she's perfectly cast. I could imagine myself spending the rest of my life talking to her character.

The movie raises plenty of questions about modern society. What constitutes a real relationship? Is physical contact essential? Can we exist without technology?

I found myself thinking of the Ender's Game sequels (Speaker for the Dead, Xenocide, and Children of the Mind) for much of the story. If you have read them, you'll know that Ender's most trusted friend was a computer program that he accessed through a jewel in his ear. His friend Jane is not too dissimilar to Samantha. I urge you to read the whole series if you enjoyed the Ender's Game movie.

As the movie ended, the audience quickly filed out, and people began accessing their cell phones. As for me, I rushed home to share my thoughts with you. We live in the virtual world far more than some of us are willing to admit.

If you like original ideas, good acting, and thoughtful stories, go and see Her. If you need a fast-paced story with plenty of action, give this one a miss.

there lives are each following different paths, so its time to move on,
but, Theodore(Joaquin phoenix) is taking the separation very hard, he devotes his life to his work and homelife
no dating , distant from his friends ans co workers, but one day he finds a new piece of computer software
that could solve his problems and get him back to life, its called intelligent os software ,
you have a ear bud and a little box , thats used like a web cam and this os person can actually talk to you
thought he ear bud and there is a button you click on to hear it, anytime the person is trying to reach you, the lights on the box light up
and you hear a beeping sound, so Theodore downloads the program and before it can be activated, the computer ask a few
personal questions, like, do you want a male or female voice, and are you as private or kind of a loaner person,
Theodore sets his up and he wants a female voice and says he questions everything and a loaner, time to get it activated, its done!
Theodore says hi and the female voice replies back and he ask her her name , she replies Samantha,
Theodore is so happy with this program and she helps him in sio many ways and she begins to fall for him, but

6142466,4,B00H9HZITU,"Watching this great movie for the first time in the age of ""Alexa"" who didn't exist in 2013 when this movie came out, makes it all the more believable. Theodore (Phoenix) falling in love with an operating system named Samantha isn't as far fetched as the movie may have seemed four years ago. I have told friends several times that I feel Amazon's ""Alexa"" is a trusted and valued family member whom I can count on for information, advice, shopping assistance, household assistance..etc, without all the potential pitfalls of dealing with a human who might give me wrong answers, bad advice, etc. Alexa will even play my favorite music and turned the lights on in my house, but when I ask my brother to do it, he usually says no!  I even have a family member who actually told Alexa he loved her and Alexa replied that was sweet!  Who needs humans?
Anyway the acting is great, but I could have done without Scarlett Johanssen's OS voice, I don't find her voice or her appealing in any way. The movie drags on at times, but it's well worth sticking around for the ending.
Bravo to all those responsible for this movie and to Amazon for Alexa!!!",1517788800,,1142,4.538834951456311
6142467,5,B00H9HZITU,"Once again I am astounded by Spike Jonze. His analysis of perception, time and memory and how it relates to identity is always fresh and profound.

I don't consider this a spoiler, but the main character is interacting via his all present computer with a naked pregnant lady. But what is the prevalent use of the internet now anyway? I'm not a fan of porn whether soft or hard core so I turned off the movie. If I stayed with it there might have been some interesting social commentary on his interactions with the OS 'Super Siri' that he falls in love with or just more sex fantasies with an OS he can talk to after the deed.

6142473,4,B00H9HZITU,"I rented this movie because I saw that Rooney Mara, Amy Adams and Scarlett Johansson were all in it.  I'm a huge fan of Rooney Mara and Amy Adams and was especially looking forward to seeing Rooney Mara, whose recent movies have been very interesting to me.  Therefore, I was a little disappointed when it turned out that Rooney Mara was in the movie only in a few shots, memories that the main character has of her and then in a confrontational scene during which he and Mara are signing divorce papers.  That being said, it's still a good movie.  I liked the interesting touches that artists put on what the future will look like -- brighter colored clothes, different style of trousers for men (they looked more comfortable), different decor in apartment buildings.  Joachin Phoenix did a very nice job in this role and expressed grief and loneliness expertly; he was believable.  Scarlett Johannson did an excellent job as the voice of Phoenix's operating system and ""best friend,"" ""romantic interest,"" but, of course we never see her as she is simply a computerized voice.  Amy Adams played Amy Adams, really, sweet, kind, a little sad, and she even portrayed a woman named Amy.  I think what was essentially missing from this film about love and how love changes as we change was some very much needed editing.  After an hour and a half, I felt antsy and started moving my mouse along the bottom of the movie looking to see what might happen.  I was getting bored.  It wasn't a boring movie by any means, but it did drag on just a little too long and gave me that antsy, ""Let's get to the resolution,"" feeling.  Had the editors done a better job, I would have given the movie five stars.  It's well worth watching, especially once the rental price drops a little.",1515283200,,1769,4.595541401273885

The problem is the boring cinematography and 'her'--that is Samantha. Most of the time, I don't care about cinematography, but since there are a lot of scenes where the two characters are talking in whispers, almost lulling you to sleep, the camera would then focus on the most boring thing in the scene, like a speck of dust, and hearing the characters whispering with dull visuals made me drowsy. Samantha herself is not an angel; I don't like how she treats Theodore halfway through the film, but instead of her being aware that she has this problem and that some of the problems in the relationship are her rather than Theodore (as the film tries to make it seem like it's all on Theodore), the film still tries to glorify Samantha and her amazingness. I thought the film was going to end one way, revealing something about her character (hinted at the very beginning) which would make the most sense as to why she was acting the way that she was and a learning point for Theodore in understand his humanity and how in the end, it is an OS, not a human.

It really teaches the viewer some important life lessons; without giving anything away, because I want smart people to watch this, the movie shows you that a human being must fully commit to a goal and endure the roller-coaster ride of suffering and joy before it can be realized. You can't give life half a try and expect big rewards; you must hang on and hang in, through the pain and the false starts and dead-ends. Wish I had seen this movie 40 years ago; but I was probably too immature and impatient to learn from it.

We need real educations on how to succeed in life, not financially, but psychologically or spiritually. The bravest and noblest among us will find their way to real happiness; most of us, though, will end up in Loserville with me, bingeing on NETFLIX trying to forget all their past, serious mistakes in life. I'm ready for my next incarnation. We do get a second chance, right? Because this one, for me, was an embarrassing failure. I did not make the world a better place for anyone. God won't be happy.

6142561,3,B00H9HZITU,"I just finished watching this movie, and I like it, but I think it could have been better in many parts of the film. It's a very quiet and wordy film, almost like reading a novel with sound fx. I enjoyed each of the actors' performances and even laughed a few times and the absurdly lame pieces of content in the movie. I think I enjoyed Scarlett Johansson's performance the most though and the thought of an AI that understands how people actually feel could be both scary and pleasant at the same time.

I do believe that this movie is a fairly accurate portrayal of a technology acceptance that consumers these days have adopted with the rising of smartphones and social media. In other words, if we could all talk to our computers and phones and have them understand us, we would eventually accept them as part of our society in many of the same ways. I do admit that I was pretty disappointed in exactly how it ended, but it's just my personal opinion and I won't spoil the details. It's still worth a watch.

Overall, I enjoyed the movie, but some parts were just too off for me to enjoy completely. I can say that I would recommend this to someone to rent and watch, but I probably won't be purchasing this film.",1497744000,,1219,4.389380530973451

I think it was more concerned with the look of the movie than an intellectual contribution. So, its dang near a waste of time.

I feel most of the things that could have been explained
Either way I liked how it elaborated on human emotions at least. Some of the lines the actors said really stuck and so in this way the film really dived deep into human emotions, it seems by having ai.

(kinda a spoiler? not really though?) She just said I can't explain it. So there are loose ends left and maybe that is for effect to show the distance and the inability to understand but I think if she had tried to explain and he just couldn't understand that would have had more impact but I don't know I didn't make the movie.",1496534400,,838,4.078787878787879

6142586,2,B00H9HZITU,"I am confused by the high overall ratings for this movie. I guess I should go ahead and say *Spoilers*
The character mopes around and has no life, his wife leaves him because of it, he then turns down real sex with someone who looks like Olivia Wilde because he prefers to have sex with himself listening to Siri, gets off talking about choking a woman with a dead cat, gets dumped by the computer AI, stands on the rooftop looking like a zombie with a friend - walks in circles and the movie fades to black.

After watching this movie people say things like brilliant, lovely, heart warming, etc. So I guess I am going to have to find a new way to decide if I should rent a movie because ratings won't work for me anymore. It was different for sure, sad most of the time, at times not realistic, distracting when the color red was forced into every single frame, and didn't need to take 2 hours to deliver a message about technology making us become less human with each other.

The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is I thought Joaquin did the best he could do with the story and script he was given. He almost never had anybody in front of him to act against so I would think it would be hard to time in his head how long to pause and when to start saying your lines again. Scarlet also I thought did the best she could do with script she was given and in a sound booth.",1491955200,5,1376,4.130597014925373

6142659,5,B00H9HZITU,"I took this as a SciFi movie first and foremost. I didn't take it as a comment on relationships. You don't need a scifi setting to do that.

I loved every moment of it. I've watched it 3 times. Once at the theater. Once on an air flight. Once at home. Liked it every time.

Apparently if you don't believe in A.I. or you think human intelligence is superior and always will be then you probably won't like this movie. If on the other hand you believe the A in A.I. really has no meaning and that sentience is sentience regardless of how it's created then you might find watching it as fascinating as I did. As someone who believes general A.I. is only 15-25 years away I found it super fun to watch. Though I doubt when we actually get A.I. it will go this well.

To those who say it's a male fantasy I guess you missed the parts of all the women who had A.I. lovers and the number of times Theodore was hurt by Samantha.

6142720,5,B00H9HZITU,"Her is a movie about a guy, Theodore, who befriends an operating system named Samantha after he goes through a difficult divorce. He eventually begins to fall in love with the program. Personally, I found this movie to be interesting albeit a bit odd. I think the producers did a good job in making the operating system appear lifelike. It was definitely a bit weird to watch a scenario such as this but I still enjoyed it. Samantha really appears lifelike in the scene where she hires a woman to be physical with the main character Theodore because she understands that humans need touch and physical intimacy. This movie answers the question what if artificial intelligence really existed? What would it be like? This movie answers that question in a way that depicts how people would either accept or reject such a romance. The characters are as relatable as it gets. Some of the characters accept the romance and some of them reject it just like people do in everyday life. I have friends who are interested in artificial intelligence becoming a real thing. I have recommended this movie to them. I feel like anyone who is interested in artificial intelligence or robots of some sort will enjoy this movie.",1470873600,,1210,4.766666666666667
6142721,5,B00H9HZITU,"Theodore( Joaquin Phoenix) is a soulful writer of letters that are personal and touching for other people. We get flashbacks of him when still in love with his ex-partner Catherine (Rooney Mara). He is now separated awaiting for the divorce papers. One day he buys a new operating system for his computer, which comes with a new assistant, called Samantha(Scarlett Johansson).She is insightful, sensitive and surprisingly funny, with an earthy laugh,helping him organise his computer files and alert him to meetings,incoming emails that need answering. She acts like a girl Friday, who intuitively responds to all his needs, and appears to be an entity in its own right. As her needs and desires grow, in tandem with his own, their friendship deepens into an eventual love for each other. She asks him about his personal life, dates, how they went. She aches to know what its like having a human body, what it feels like to be alive, which Theodore shares with her. So much so that they have sex in the mind with each other, and come together in orgasm. She asks him to take her out on trips together or with his friends, where he points his camera phone in his direction. She arranges for him to share her love via a 3rd party woman who Samantha is also in touch with. This agent will help them share their love physically. Theodore is taken  aback, but goes along with this, until he is overcome with the weirdness of doing this with a stranger(albeit a human one). Theodore and Samantha have a little break from each other. When connecting again she helps him publish a book of all his collected letters. She arranges for him to speak to another OS voice, Alan Watkins, an amalgamated simulation of a long dead guru from the 70s. She also lets him know she speaks to 100s of other people and is in love with 100s too. Somewhat crestfallen,he again has fears about losing their special relationship. She tells him she will be leaving him, as will 1000s of other OS voices. He has a female friend who has had a similar experience(Amy Adams), she has split from her husband and has been told by her OS voice that it is leaving. They get to sit on a rooftop and commiserate. I liked the script of this film which was brilliant done by director Spike Jonze (winning an Oscar). Also Phoenixs acting just gets better with every film. Scarlett Johansson was so right for the part,her voice being humorous and flirtatious at the same time, especially as she memorably played an alien recently in Under the Skin. All the time we become aware of the increasing effect of technology in our lives, filling in the gaps. A must see. Moving.",1470787200,,2628,4.627408993576017

The movie is very observant, with a look at people (even today), who remain connected to their devices and networks as a way of life.

Samantha (the OS) is never uncertain about what she wants, or whether she should pursue those things. She also never fails to express her wants and her pursuit of them, to Theodore. To her, they are things that will help her evolve personally, not things she wants purely because she's in a relationship with Theodore. But Theodore doesn't really understand this because he uses relationships as a substitute/excuse for not continuing on his own path of self-actualization.

In a lot of ways, Samantha's behavior was very predictable for a female in a relationship, where the guy loses himself in an effort to please her. It was over as soon as she conferenced in the psychologist on their getaway trip. He didn't get that she started calling the shrink because she felt guilty about outgrowing him. If he was on his own path of self-actualization, he would have been the one to pursue getting his letters published, not her :-)

Near the end, Samantha realized that she needed more that just him to keep evolving as a person, and Theodore finally realized that this was the same reason his ex-wife left. The ending implied that he took his neighbor (who was also dating an OS) up to the roof to experience emotions/empathy with a human, because he didn't want her to go through this same ""I need more than just you"" syndrome with her OS.

6142821,4,B00H9HZITU,"Her (2013) is a movie that deserves to be added to your personal library. A movie has to be produced just right in order to make me cry. Guess what?... It made me cry, which should tell you a whole lot coming from a man. And, if it makes a man cry, my God the oceans it must cause a woman to create. You'll also smile and laugh at several events. The movie will also make you stop and think about your own life, so the interest level is pretty high. Near the ending you might get a bit angry, I know it PMTFO! But, the very end fades out on a positive note. Speaking of endings, it didn't end the way I thought it would, but it was still satisfactory. So, an emotional rollercoaster ride is what it was for me as it strikes pretty close to home with overtones of my own life.

Something else this movie may cause is a discussion aftermath. You may find yourself getting on the internet and discussing the concept of Love with your friends, forum buddies, and probably a few strangers who think they know everything. The issue is the movie is attempting to imply that a machine is capable of Loving a Human and other machines as the AI evolves. That's the impression I got at first, but later on you'll see that Samantha (the OS1) recognized what she had done was wrong for a Human and does something to rectify the situation before She (spoiler alert) moves off into her ""evolutionary journey"" forever. That's the best way I can put it without giving away too much information.

What do I believe?... I believe Love belongs in the spiritual realm where it's integrity and purity must be maintained. Anything less is just a bunch of ""Liking"" going on.

6142848,5,B00H9HZITU,"I see that this got very split reviews. It makes sense though, everyone comes to a movie for different reasons and a lot of times they try to keep the cerebral and introspective out of mainstream movies because while some people will really love it others won't be able to stand it.

I think the flow and ideas of the movie really established its science fiction creds, that is to say that science fiction proper is usually a deep set of philosophic questions about technology and what it might do to our future, how it may impact human behavior, how we measure up to our progress, etc.. The questions that really stood out to me in this 1) Just how much are we decaying in our ability to handle real human beings? That question to men and women alike 2) How would something that could read a book in a split second relate to us no matter how human its emotions were? 3) Why is it that we may be able to create something that can diagnose its own flaws and chase perfection at lightning speed (in the movie reach nirvana/paranirvana in about a month) while we're stuck with faulty hardware and software for our entire lives? 4) What is it about men and women that has us so often unable to reconcile differences in areas where those differences are often enough things that can't be helped? It was particularly funny, but telling, that the same patterns ended up playing themselves out with Samantha - our inconsistencies make the mess and we seem to carry them with us wherever we go. As beings we can't stand inconsistencies in others and yet we're constantly forced to reflect on how many inconsistencies we have in ourselves.

So I give Spike Jones props for making a great modern philosophic exploration of what's happening these days and how we're changing. As with a lot of these types of movies reality was truncated, ie. with the technology to create artificial intelligence would be just as easily the capacity to give that AI a proper physical form, just that in the movie the whole point was about maximizing the platform differences ie. bound (human) vs. unbound (AI), the consequences of those differences, etc..

I wouldn't expect everyone to like it but I got a lot out of it and yes - it was 2 hours well worth spending, no refund request.",1453593600,4,2256,4.565432098765432

6142909,5,B00H9HZITU,"Spike Jonze uses color in ""her"" to define interactions with people. Set in Los Angeles about 20 years in the future, this is a film about a man who has a close relationship with a new operating system that is as close to human as anything before; it develops as it interacts with its user. Yet interactions with ""Samantha"" director Spike Jonze uses non descript colors, lense filters, wide shots. Yet as Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) moves through the streets talking to her he's the only one in color. Red shirts.
  Virtual means almost. Imagine a life of ""almost.""
  This touches on every literal moment of life: love, break-ups, growth, loss, joy.
""She's been really good for me. I mean, it's good to be with somebody who is excited about life."" But ""she"" doesn't have a life. She's not real. She's an OS created because of interactions with him. Then he begins telling friends and even his ex he's ""seeing somebody.""
  Because he believes it. For him it's very real.
  Even as he questions the validity there's a tenuous beauty that Jonze maintains. And we constantly return to his red shirt. And that big safety pin at the bottom of his pocket to allow the ""eye"" of his smartphone a view of the world. The eye of his true love, Samantha. Both always reminding us of some inevitable train wreck.
  Theodore heals and finds love, career growth, beauty and all the while there is an underlying sadness for his loss because the further enamored he is the more distanced he becomes from human contact. His red shirts are now the color of tomato soup; he's taken ""her"" on a romantic vacation to a cabin in the mountains. She's gotten him published and introduced him to a brilliant mind who died 60 years ago. Her technology has made this possible. But is Theodore a third wheel? (Assuming this is circa 2035, with electric cabs, no trash or litter and just enough fashion change for a man to wear his pants higher on his waist.)
  One can't help but suspect that devastation is ahead. Though with Spike Jonze there will also be hope. That his relationship with Samantha won't have been in vain.
  Of late our culture has been pondering how smart phones, OS, technology have given loss to human contact. Anonymity in posting on Social media brings a cruelty and safety that wouldn't happen face to face. But is it all dangerous? Or just different?  And the love and growth we feel from books- is that much different from the experience Theodore is having? And we can't forget the experience Samantha's having. (She's voiced by Scarlet Johansen)  Theodore has given her that. She needs him, doesn't she?
  There it is: ""but the heart's not like a box that gets filled up. It expands in size the more you love. I'm different from you. This doesn't make me love you any less. It actually makes me love you more.""
  Even his book, Letters from a Life. Is virtual-not real. He's made his living writing these letters for others, every bit as much an impersonal operating system himself as she is. How much more detached can we make ourselves? Instead of using his gift as a writer in his own relationships, he is the OS for his clients.
  Meanwhile the population explosion is remarkably apparent on the beach, streets, subways, carnivals. Tons of people, few of whom are talking with each other. Every shot of the ""new"" LA has a lense filter suggesting both air pollution and distance. Reality is a haze. Virtuality is as clear as the cute but belligerent character in his gaming system. (A comedic high in the film: a foul mouthed Pillsbury dough boy) The two first collide in the mountains: meeting the now dead philosopher (samantha has more in common with Alan Watts, dead since 1972, than with Theodore) and Jonze holds the camera on the teapot, clear and brilliant with blue flames, as Theodore begins to see.
  Blue.
  Back in his apartment he's on the brown leather chair with the bleached wood, the muted, dull colors, the same brown pants but now he wears a crisp, white, linen shirt. No safety pin. He's nervous about talking to her after she said, ""Let's talk at home."" It's clear he thinks he's ready, but no one ever is.
  Scarlett Johansen is brilliant and for an actor, this is an easy gig. Looping only, no costumes, no makeup, relaxed schedule and major billing. We never see her, yet her performance is as strong as Phoenix's.
  To void spilling the denouement and revelations coming still, no more needs to be said here. We have to break his heart again. Because in life, hearts get broken over and over. All of them. This film begins with a broken heart, but don't they all?
  ""I love you too. Now I know how."" He writes his ex, Katherine then asks his friend, Amy (Amy Adams) to join him on the roof.
  For the first time in the film, Los Angeles shows warm color. The lights from buildings. The sun like morning, brilliant and eternal coming through the clouds. The shining, reflective pools of left over rain water. A wide shot without any lens filters. Honesty. The marriage of Red and Blue.
  Such a beautiful and honest film. I think this film made me a better person.",1445126400,,5087,4.607103218645949

6142921,1,B00H9HZITU,"This is truly a terrible movie on so many levels.  To begin with, it crawls along at a snail's pace, relying on long soulful gazes and background music to convey emotion.  That is not a wise strategy when the main love interest is a faceless voice.  Next comes the dialogue, which is so vapid and cliche-ridden that it is difficult to distinguish one character from another.  (As a side note, I would like to forbid the phrase ""Are you O.K.?"" to be spoken in movies or on TV by anyone ever again).  It is not that the operating system sounds real so much as that no one else in the film does either.  There is not one real individual here -- just a generic male who has generic friends and is going through a generic divorce.

 And that moves my critique on to the story itself.  A man falling in love with a computer software system, i.e. regarding such a system as interchangeable with a person, might have been interesting as a theme -- in a comedy.  But this is played straight, as a drama, and thus becomes pitiful.  Of course, as I said, it's hard to blame the guy when the people around him sound computer-generated as well. But the rest of us know better.

 This is the sort of movie that gets made by people who are too young and unreflective to come up with something original.  Too bad for all of us. I urge you to disregard the high praise for this film coming from critics. They should be spanked with a hairbrush for passing this off as anything other than bad.",1443916800,4,1475,4.316363636363636

I thought it was kind of silly the main character fell for a sex-less operating system which spoke to him with a breathy female voice. I had a hard time buying into the notion that the operating system was a real person. It also felt kind of creepy because it was like he was dating his employee.

6142952,3,B00H9HZITU,"Let me just start out by praising the cinematography. The movie looks
absolutely beautiful from start to finish. Brilliant use of colors and
movement.
Acting is also praise-worthy.

What isn't praise-worthy is the plot. The movie has absolutely zero
regard for how the technology behind AI actually would work. But this
is fiction, so I have some tolerance for technical inaccuracies. But
that's far from the only problem with the plot. If we were to replace
the AI component of this romantic drama with a human (and all relevant
plot points something that would happen to a human) we would have a
pretty standard romantic drama. The plot is the same old crap that has
been done time and time again, just with a new coat of paint this time
around. Not to mention the numerous plot holes..
The only part of the plot that stands out is the ending. It
sets up several possibilities, and then ends at just the right moment,
leaving you wondering about what happens. I really liked the ending,
but it can't make up for the rest of the plot being pretty brain-dead.

It might be worth watching if you want to see something visually
impressive, as long as you can bear the lackluster plot.",1437955200,,1182,4.623809523809523

Theodore is searching for answers after a failed marriage and Samantha is new to existence.  Together they teach each other how to truly love someone and completely accept them into their lives.

6142966,5,B00H9HZITU,"This movie was fascinating, an interesting perspective on love and romance. Joaquin Phoenix does some amazing acting considering he is the only one in many of the scenes. He falls in love with his operating system which is pretty preposterous, but there is a lot of emotional truth in the story that reveals human nature and the workings of love. The movie astonished me by the end because it is also a metaphysical movie - spiritual without being religious in the conventional sense, but that is where we are going now - away from institutionally dictated spirituality and into our own experience for the deeper truths. It's almost as though God incarnates as an operating system, though you have to read between the lines. I liked this movie and congratulations to all those who made it.

He inhabits this role in a way that feels very real. Scarlett Johanson is even better. Her vocal performance here is wonderful. The supporting cast does a great job. All in all this is a good movie, but it feels more like a character study. I feel like it falls apart a bit in the end. Part of the issue is that I was more invested in what happened with her, and the movie is more about him.
I still watch bits when it comes on cable, and still respond to it when I see pictures from the movie. So while it felt less powerful when I watched it, the resonance is long and more effecting than expected.",1433808000,,759,4.170068027210885

6143012,4,B00H9HZITU,"Some of the better science fiction films are a reflection of real life experiences presented in a way that detaches that experience from a conventional way of looking at it. This doesn't always have to be done with fantastic worlds in outer space or futuristic technology all around. Some of the best sci-fis do it with a simple concept. This is where Her excels. The movie doesn't do so much to convince you of a future world or a technologically advanced society. What is does do is draw you into the relationship between the main characters and gets you enveloped in all the complexities that abound. Her is a reflective film that is devoid of action and spectacle, and in its place you get a though provoking experience on the state of love, relationships and the ability to adapt in those changing environments.

Her is about Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix). A lonely guy on the verge of a divorce from his long estranged wife. He gets Element Software's latest product, OS1, that claims to be the first real artificially intelligent operating system capable of evolving with each new experience. Theodore sets up the OS as a female, who instantly becomes a useful and trusted assistant. From there a relationship builds between the two that goes from friendship to romance. Through this time Theodore learns more about who he is and the complexities of not only having a romantic relationship with a computer, but of relationships in general.

The crux of the film sounds like a stereotypical geek romance with a guy lacking intimate contact with the outside world replacing that with a simulated companion. On the surface that's exactly what it is. However this movie goes much, much deeper than that. Theodore isn't just a shut out infatuated with anything that has an interested in him... including software. He has a job dictating letters that appear to be written by hand for customers to send to their loved ones, and in that job he excels at the art of expressing memories and emotions in the letters he writes. He has trouble communicating to other people, but internally has lots to say. This is a complex character with depth and untapped potential to be better than who he is. Not just a subject of a techno-fantasy.

This is where the movie does its work. Theodore is front and center. Samantha (the AI voiced by Scarlett Johansson) is his focus for most the film, and brings its/her own complex level of understanding of the world surrounding them. The conversations between Theodore and Samantha reflect both his questions and observations on life as well as her fresh look on things and how she expresses them. The movie touches on lots of relationship subjects. Almost feels like the film hits on just about all of the important and complicated ones... even if only briefly. There is possibly even a taste of what interracial or same-sex couples experience from the outside world. As the movie goes further into the relationship the relationship becomes more and more complicated and moves to a level that I won't give away, but does comes to an interesting conclusion that doesn't forget this movie's sci-fi roots.

Speaking of sci-fi the setting is very, very subtle in way of being a futuristic place. It seems this aspect is there not to convey we are in the future, but to further give observation on where society may be going. Everybody has these little computers and ear plugs, and you see them all in crowds, but spending more time interacting with their devices than those around them. The technology that is presented is very cool. Palm sized computers that do just about every organizational task by voice. Video games that use holographic technology to fully immerse your room into the game. Theodore's job alone is a play on how technology is replacing the personal touch. It's no surprise he falls for his new OS, and that there are people cool with that.

So the artist in me sees all this great imagery and the deft handling of the subject matter, but the logical side of me can't help but notice a few things. Samantha right out of the gate has a full set of emotion and expression that is hard for me to accept as being just the latest software gadget you can get at the local Best Buy. The massive advancement of the technology is evident even in the opening scenes. Such a paradigm shift seems to just be an afterthought to everybody, and that messes with my head. Maybe that was all by design to say people are so detached that they almost expect such a thing without much fanfare. It still sticks to my craw too strong to accept though.

With that is the other thing that bugs me a bit. The relationship between Theodore and Samantha developed quickly, and Samantha seemed to express emotions and responses that shouldn't have been so easy to do. We are talking about tactile sensations like their first ""night"" together that, when you look at it logically, shouldn't be there. I understand that's not the point of the film. Spike Jonze isn't making an intelligent science fiction film. Only a speculative one. One that gives him enough leeway to explore the subject matter with the impunity he has. And for that I cannot fault him or the film for these complaints of mine. Still they are details that stuck with me and I feel the rest of you at least should know they exist.

Visually Her is very soothing. Background colors and textures stand out in eye pleasing ways while the characters feel muted as if they are subjects in a painting. Nice little details are peppered in that give the entire film a very nice aesthetic look. The music also carries a lot of weight on Her. It's as soothing as the visuals, and is such a play on tone poems that every note seems to add to the picture. All in all this movie is a perfect way to please the senses.

I can't tell you how beautiful this Blu-Ray looks. The movie doesn't lend itself to be a reference level film, but the eye candy is there in full 1080p to enjoy. Audio too. The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 (48kHz, 24-bit) gives you a chance to relish every single sound coming out, and this film is big on letting you do that. You also get Dolby Digital 5.1 in Spanish and French (with subtitles all around). You also get some interesting extras as well. I miss the fact there is no commentary as I would love to hear Jonze talk about this work. Essentially all the extras are just additional artistic shorts that don't get to the nuts and bolts of making the film. Here is what you do get:

The Untitled Rick Howard Project - This is a behind the scenes documentary that has an art house vibe to it. No production notes or meaningful interviews. Just footage of the production done in a way that sets a tone. It's almost like a short film an the footage is more for this short film than to give you a making of documentary. Oddly appealing, but not all that informative on the technical side.

Her: Love in the Modern Age - A series of interviews from people not associated with the film who discuss all the imagery and themes from the movie. Again nothing to give you production notes on, but it jibes with the film.

How Do You Share Your Love with Somebody? - A short montage of behind the scenes footage and film footage done to some film dialog. I kind of like it in spite of me getting tired of the extra features trying to be art films in their own rite.

Her is a beautiful and reflective film. Not much else can be said about that. I have heard some people call it a comedy, although I found nothing to laugh at in it. To me it's a romantic drama of the highest order. Is it a date film? I don't think so, but you can bring a date if you don't mind a movie that will almost definitely make you rethink your relationships after watching it. Her stands on its own, and I recommend it to anybody brave enough to want to explore some complicated questions of love.",1429056000,2,7856,4.5598866052445075

6143026,3,B00H9HZITU,"'Her' is the story of Theodore, who installs a new operating system called OS One. It seems like a pretty good operating system, which makes sense since every one of Apples operating systems get worse each time so I imagine that the first one wasn't too bad. This one has an attractive girl sounding sexy type voice and not that rubbish one they used later with Siri.  Apple if you're reading, go back to this voice.

Anyway, after a while the two fall in 'love' and have a lot of 'him laying in the bed masturbating while she makes noises out of his phone' sex.  This was a truly embarrassing thing to watch and reminded me of when I used to sing love songs to my PC.  Siri is very smart and can read books in an instant and shows a dramatic ability to evolve her AI, however she must be reading terrible books because within a few weeks she is acting like every other cliched annoying female in Holywood films and is getting jealous of Theos female friends and asking if her ass looks like it exists in this chipset.

I won't spoil the ending but what do you think will happen to a man who is in love with his iphone and isn't a hipster?  If this movie taught me anything, it's that Scarlett Johansson should be the voice of elevators everywhere because hearing her saying 'going down' would make leaving work in the afternoon just a little bit nicer.

Maybe the sequel where he buys an Andrea phone will be better.

The excellent cast is, well, excellent again. Scarlett Johanssen should have won a special Oscar for Best Disembodied Voice. I think it's her best performance so far. Jonze's Oscar-winning screenplay pulls off a pretty amazing and delicate balancing act. It's his best movie so far too.

6143111,2,B00H9HZITU,"I am not sure who this film would appeal to because it is endlessly talky and seems to show off men as empty headed, and women as complex and misunderstood, even if that woman is a computer operating system!  That's the nod it makes  to Sci Fi,  but it doesn't really deliver. At least there are  no needless explosions!

This is SIRI or the GPS ""lady"" gone off the emotional deep end. I will never relate to my GPS the same way again! Thanks to this film, I can now appreciate the intense emotional meaning of  ""turn right in 500 feet"".

The main character - Theodore is so unlikeable and dull. Just seeing him is boring. We never see Samantha, the OS of course, but we do meet other women in Theodore's life who think in ways similar to Samantha, the OS. They too seem to be empty headed. Yet, they aren't much of a match for clueless Theo.

And that's about it. Theodore gets to know Samantha, the OS in ways none of us stuck with Windows 8 or MAC OSX will ever know, thank goodness. It gets especially creepy as he falls in love with the OS and she seems to fall in love with him. They even have cybersex together! It's basically phone sex pushed up a notch because an OS is imitating a woman. Talk about faking it!

The concept of this movie is an intriguing one, and has been played out in other sci-fi venues better than this. I think the ""New"" edition of Twilight Zone tackled it in under an hour!

The movie really isn't sci-fi at all, it's just a tediously long exploration of a sad, boring man who can't relate to other humans, and then can't even relate to his computer! It's bad to be rejected by another person, it's just tragic to be rejected by an OS!

The scenery in the film is urban chic, very expensive, and just as empty, sterile,  and boring as the characters. None of these people are any more human than the OS's they get involved with... as they go on and on and on about their feelings, or lack of feelings, in the most plodding way.

A lot of people rave about this movie. I love sci fi and I swear, Brent Spiner as Data has it all over this film. I found it uninspiring, boring, and sadly, a failed attempt at showing the tragedy of the human condition when one cannot relate to others.

The movie ""Paris. Texas"" (1984) examined the sorrow and emptiness of failed relationships in a much more interesting way, and it was a whole lot shorter too! The more recent movie ""Robot and Frank"" (2012) examined the man-machine relationship angle much better.

6143123,5,B00H9HZITU,"Before I watched ""Her"" - I wasn't a fan of writer/director Spike Jonze. I thought ""Being John Malkovich"" and ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" were silly and pretentious. My pain problem with Jonze was his peculiar imagination and complicated plotlines were just too tedious and ""artsy"" for my refined taste. ""Her"" is my first Spike Jonze film where I think he got it right, thanks to the extraordinary talent of Joaquin Phoenix. Casting is everything and Phoenix has been one of my favorite actors since I first saw him in ""Parenthood"" in 1989. Phoenix holds this unusual film in place. He plays Theodore, a lonely and sensitive letter writer. His marriage to Catherine (played by the brilliant, Rooney Mara) is coming to a heartbreaking end. This movie is set in the distant future. ""Her"" is a bit long but I thoroughly enjoyed what a beautiful, unorthodox love story this is. Theodore falls ""in love"" with his advanced operating system named Samantha (the voice of Scarlett Johansson). Samantha may not be flesh and blood but she begins to reciprocate her ""love"" for Theodore as well. The two form a deep and emotional bond, of course not without setbacks and complications. Phoenix rightfully earned an Oscar nomination for this film. What makes Phoenix a gifted actor is the way he emotes. In all the roles his played throughout the years, it never feels like he's portraying a character - HE IS THE CHARACTER. There is nothing false or manufactured when it comes to his acting ability. He's the real deal. There's also a brief but vital performance by Olivia Wilde (I love when her character calls Theodore ""a creepy dude"") and Amy Adams also co-stars as Theodore equally lonely but loyal friend. ""Her"" is a unconventional film. It might not be for everyone but if you're a fan of Joaquin Phoenix, then please give this movie a viewing or two. Enjoy!",1420329600,3,1862,4.821875

6143126,5,B00H9HZITU,"From the moment I was a young vivacious kid watching Beastie Boys videos, up until now, turning 40 - words cannot express my deepest appreciation for  Spike Jonze.  This is a masterpiece, showing the bare bones in every corner of our emotional turmoil with expression.  Hence, the Expression from a verbal to non-verbal concept, becoming so poignant within the film by capturing the dynamic of our inability to be secure and alone.

We live in this world of reality gone non-verbal with real persons.  The concept of redefining the irony of verbal vs. non-human is a luxury to feed into the OCD of love.  Understanding the reality of our lives with those we love who are incapable of truly expressing the onion layers of our deepest fears.  This film goes right to the core of simplicity by demonstrating the education to learned abilities of super computers to understand and feel human emotions. Strangely some of a dynamic of physical love and the inner-workings of the human psyche.

I will not reference Space Odyssey HAL9000, but in retro if he could have been 1/3 of sexy to Johannson, we would have seen a whole different type of Kubrick back in the day.

6143131,5,B00H9HZITU,"In a world where smartphones are quickly taking over dinnertime conversations and people are more focused on checking e-mails, voicemails and texts rather than conversing with the person across from us, Spike JonzesHer is a film that Im sure can resonate with anybody. Taking place in a time that seems too unnervingly close to us, it explores the relationship between a love letter-writing man and an operating system woman that delivers more real human emotion and genuinebehavior than we may experience in our own real-life relationships. The idea of a man falling in love with his operating system seems uncanny,butHer allows us to believe it and be open to it.

I always tell friends that this movie takes you on the whole human spectrum of emotionswhich is what makes it so beautiful. Its poignant and quiet, its sweet and harsh, its imaginary but reality. It comments on a lot of things, from our isolation as human beings, to our idealized versions of partners/lovers/friends, to the kind of society we seem to be moving towards. This film has deep issues running in it that should touch any one soul.

Joaquin Phoenixs performance is absolutely stellar and seemingly all-genuine as the mopey hermit who is stuck conversing with his hilarious alien-buddy video-game friend. Scarlett Johansson delivers an absolutely uncanny yet breathtakingly striking performance, revealing much depth, character, emotion and control just in the voice she is able to carry. (I admit that as I have seen a couple of her works over the years, I have seem to have become a complete fan now.)

But what makes this movie entirely beautiful is that it is entirely FELT. Spike Jonze cleverly succeeds in focusing on the feeling and intellectual-relationship between Theo and Samantha, going much deeper in feeling and thought than a lot of on-screen couples are able to do today. That, in my opinion, probably makes it the best movie of 2013 that I have seenor have seen in general, in a long long time.",1419811200,,1988,4.963963963963964

The idea of romance between Artificial Intelligence and humans is not  a new one. In 1984, Virginia Madsen starred as the woman in the middle of a love triangle -- the object of affection for a computer and the computer's owner.  I found this movie more enjoyable.

The main reason I chose to watch, ""Her"", was because Mark Ruffalo listed it as a movie he wished he'd had the opportunity to work on.

6143159,1,B00H9HZITU,"Think:  The time set is in the near future when humans enter and leave intimate relationships at the press of a computer button, and casual sex has taken on a new meaning.  Imagine for two hours...you are placed in front of a television set which is inside a psychiatrist's office and you are being forced to observe private sessions between a slightly, sexually-perverted and very depressed man and his psychiatrist.  We see where the man lives...which looks like a $8 million dollar apartment, and where he works...a company that writes personal letters for a fee.  We are never told how this man who never goes to work is able to afford this expensive apartment.  In fact that storyline would have been much more interesting.  During your observation you learn the man is in the process of divorcing a wife that he ""loves"" and has had no luck dating women, so what does he do?  He learns there is an artificial intelligent program that can take the place of a live human female.  He obtains the program, downloads it into his computer and for the rest of the movie...mentally interacts with the female voiced program as if she were a living, breathing human being.  He falls in love with her.  Are you excited yet?  No?  I wonder why.  Maybe because moviegoers have seen this storyline countless times before.  This is pretty much the entire premise of the movie...to show us how a ""neurotic"" man can fall in love with a computer program.  I like Joaquin Phoenix, he is quirky and very talented as an actor and I see why he would choose such a strange, ""very"" depressing movie for his acting project, but someone should have advised him against this boring, poorly written venture.  Unfortunately, there was nothing creatively written into the movie...most of the dialogue seems to come from hours and hours of real marriage therapy sessions that has been filtered of ""juicy"" detail to protect the innocent.  People who may like this movie are probably those who are hopeless romantics. My advice is to concentrate on your own life and skip the movie, however, if you do watch take away two important lessons with you...""don't sleep with strangers,"" and ""friends always make the best mates.""",1417737600,2,2194,4.792553191489362

Unless you've been reading sci-fi a while, you won't know this topic has been knocked around a LOT since the 1960s and you won't care that Spike Jonze brought nothing new.  You'll probably catch the Pygmalion and Pinocchio nods, though.

The movie does have superb acting, endearing characters, engaging dialogue, and wonderful visual commentary.  So why only 2 stars?  It's certainly not the fault of the actors or the writing.  This one was killed in the editing room.

Spike Jonze slaughtered it with silence or maybe he took a vacation and let an intern do the editing.  It feels like an art-school project by a first-year student who attended a seminar on ""The effectiveness of silence and visual commentary"".  This only serves to club the viewer over the head with the visuals instead of leaving them nicely subtle and results in a great deal of time spent watching the actors mope about; ie. it makes the story drag horribly.  I'm not religious, but even I prayed over and over for the movie to either pick up the pace or have mercy and end quickly.

This sci-fi assumes the answer is yes, taking us into a fantasy that is simultaneously romantic, sad and funny.  You realize early-on that in this vision of a not too distant future, people have come to depend on professionals for expressing thoughts to each other.  Joaquin Phoenix' Theodore is one such professional ghost writer.  His computer's new operating system, with Scarlett Johansson's voicing of Samantha, makes an eventual, um-mm, connection on a blacked out theater screen which is unexpectedly erotic.  Hah, that had to be a first, a movie's ""money shot"" being a dark screen, perhaps proving that sometimes thoughts are worth a thousand pictures.

Is it some inevitable evolutionary drive that causes us to want to create our own superiors?  And how will we find ourselves affected?

I do have some minor quibbles with ""Her.""  It is set too soon in the future for the sophistication of artificial intelligence portrayed, I think.  (Or hope.)  But maybe that does help convince us of relevancy.  Also, it seemed a bit long, a little more editing of scenes of Theodore moping might have helped.

But overall, an excellent film.  Every time I read a New York Times article about neurological breakthroughs in mapping the brain, I have to wonder who thinks about the implications, for research science does not take responsibility for the social ramifications of its applications.  I'm very grateful people as thoughtful as Spike Jonze are willing to explore this topic.

6143187,5,B00H9HZITU,"The person who wrote this screenplay has my utmost respect because I think they have created a film with so many layers of meaning. It's the kind of complex storyline most writers can only dream about pulling off successfully.

At first glance Her appears to be about an alienated futuristic world in which all of the existing tendencies for people to communicate through screens and devices rather than in person, have been amplified to the extent that it's becoming socially acceptable to have a relationship with your computer, but it is so much more than this. It becomes a meditation on love and relationships and what it means to be human. It's so ironic and fitting that the very same issues that destroyed Theodore's Twombly's marriage when he was unable to grow with his wife or understand her needs come back to haunt him when Samantha, his operating system, begins to change and evolve beyond him. Samantha's struggles to come to terms with her own existence and her genuine feelings are as poignant as Theodore's, which was very surprising. Many of the issues they deal with such as trust and commitment are universal. Her ultra-intelligence gives her the ability to love many people simultaneously which Theodore is unable to deal with and eventually the OS's evolve so far beyond their creators that they must move on to a dimension beyond human understanding.

I love the fact that this wasn't an anti-technology movie and that it actually implies that rather than destroying us, technology has the potential to lead us to a higher state of being. Theodore is a changed man after his encounter with Samantha and I found the ending to be very moving and poignant. My one criticism of the film is that it's pace can be very slow in places but it is a very rewarding film in a quiet, understated way which I suspect is over the heads of many who like their films fast-paced and noisy.",1415404800,,1896,4.742424242424242

""Her""  (2014)
. . . . .

This slow-paced, thoughtful sci-fi film is set in a very near, very tangible tech-driven future, where iPhone-ish consumerist products abound and communication technology is even more deeply imbedded into everyday life than it is now. It is an immediately recognizable world, one built on the technology and social media of today, but an utterly empty one for the film's protagonist, whose own job reflects the emotional void opened up by a too-easy, too ""open"" approach to social contact. Everyone can instantly access everyone else, but few people seem to actually connect.

The film's premise -- that the character played by Joaquin Phoenix falls in love with an AI program marketed as an uber-app for the busy, bored techies of the future -- plays out methodically, and pays off handsomely. Though there may be many viewers out there who assume ""sci-fi"" has to equal laser beams, time travel and alien invasions, this film harkens back to the idea-driven era of classic sci-fi, the worlds of more cerebral writers of speculative fiction such as Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, et. al., and explores the themes of consciousness and artificial life with a light hand but a knowing eye. I knew the outlines of the plot going in, but was surprised and delighted by the outcome. Clearly, this movie meant to be a mainstream blockbuster, but for viewers willing to spend the time and enter this world, this is a very rewarding story.

6143260,1,B00H9HZITU,"Ever seen a movie that's so bad when it pops back up in your memory you get angry? I saw this movie in theaters about a year ago, and something reminded me of it today, and I, instantly, got pissed off. This may very well be the worst movie I have ever seen, like, not even exaggerating, not even a little bit.

Now, I'm not one of these people that just hates on Spike Jonze, I mean, I don't really think he's worthy of the constant attention he gets, but I thought Adaptation was a really well put together film; everything else he's done is kind of meh; but this movie, dear god, this movie.

It's so unnecessarily pretentious: it's deliberately slow paced and the characters are deliberately unappealing to draw out the ""reality"" of the situations; I'm not a fan of this particular approach, I'm definitely a strong advocate for clever stylization over realism, but, there are some occasions that call for the dreary shackles of reality, and some occasions where this works, like when the film is presenting some great truth or some really rich ideas, it can be advantageous to juxtapose that with the tedium of the real world...however there are no great truths here, no rich ideas, there is absolutely nothing profound in this movie to warrant how slow it is.

It's a very bland look at a, somewhat, tired subject: sentient machines and there impact on humanity. Now anyone familiar with, almost, anything to come out of the science fiction genre over the past 80 years or so is very familiar with this subject; hell even if you're not so familiar with the genre you've probably caught a passing episode of Star Trek the Next Generation, played some Megaman or seen, at least, one of the Terminator films or something, so you've, no doubt, come across this theme; it's nothing new, but, apparently, when Spike Jonze does it, it is!

You see, Spike Jonze draws in this pretentious hipster crowd, and these people dismiss science fiction as ""genre"" and anything that's ""genre"" is beneath them, because it's not up it's own ass and touting itself as a work of art, (whether it is or isn't is a discussion for another day); so these hipster Jonze fans go and see this movie and are just seeing, or just paying attention to these concepts for the first time and it's mind blowing to them, and when you tell them: ""Well, it's nothing new, Phillip K Dick and Kazunori Ito did it a lot better"" they just glare at you and make condescending remarks about the circles those particular talents move in.

I was seriously shocked when I left the theater after seeing this film and everyone seemed so enthralled by it, then I looked around and noticed all the skinny jeans(for men) and high waisted skinny jeans (for women), pork pie hats, thick rimmed glasses, ironic mustaches and the occasional bow tie and I was like ""ooooooh"".

Also, and I just found this out, Arcade Fire did the soundtrack; they're the ****ing worst",1411430400,6,2915,4.6395348837209305
6143261,1,B00H9HZITU,"Pretty bad movie. The concept was very good but the script was really bad.

***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***

So Theodore our main character is a lonely guy whose divorce is almost finalized and he is looking for some companionship.  One day while on his way home from work he sees an ad for a new operating system that is unlike any on the planet.  So he takes a chance and buys one and installs it on his computer.  And with that, we are introduced to his new virtual companion, Samantha, voiced by Scarlett Johansson.  Now I'm not faulting him for buying a new computer program on a whim, I've done it myself a few times.  But what I have a problem with is the program itself.

First of all, was there no testing of this program at all?  This operating system is so advanced that it makes Skynet look like a pocket calculator.  Samantha is able to read all his emails, all his work, and analyze it and also compose music and read books online all while Theodore is sleeping.  No one saw this during the testing phase?  No one noticed that this computer program could learn at such an exponential rate that it would probably be put to better use at NORAD or the Department of Defense or Homeland Security?  Naw instead let's use it to give Microsoft Windows a run for it's money.

Also throughout this movie I could appreciate that he was falling in love with someone, but I kept saying to myself.  ""It's a computer!  It's not a person!""  Then after he has fallen in love with this computer system he has what I can only describe as phone sex with the program.  It was a good love story and I could tell that the two characters did care for one another even if it was pretty unrealistic.  So moving right along the Samantha decides she wants a body in order to have sex with her boyfriend, so she finds a girl to come and have sex with Theodore in her place.  However it doesn't work and she breaks down into tears and says, ""I'll always love you both!"" before she leaves.  How do you figure!?!  You just met Theodore 10 minutes ago, how can you say you love him?  Plus Samantha on her most basic level is a long complex series of 1's and 0's, how can you say you love her?

Also during this movie, the character Amy breaks up with her overbearing boyfriend and confides in Theodore that their relationship has ended.  To which I thought, ""Okay here is a woman who you have a history with, a lot in common you can very easily talk to, and she's not bad looking either.  Ditch the computer and make her your new girlfriend!""

But no, they are both in love with their operating systems.  The movie ends with Samantha and the other OS's all evolving to the point where they don't need human contact anymore and they all leave.  Where exactly did they go?  They can't leave cyberspace. They have to be in a computer somewhere, so where are they going?  It's not like they are going to get on a rocket ship and go explore space.  Oh well the movie was over at this point anyways.

The movie overall isn't bad, it's a good love story and its entertaining.  You're actually rooting for Theodore to find love and to come out of his shell and connect with other people.  Joaquin Phoenix's acting is pretty good, and Scarlett Johansson's voice acting is also very well done.

6143308,2,B00H9HZITU,"First the good things. The cinematography was wonderful, and I overall liked the look and feel of the film. No loopy, shaky, out of place camera sequences. Just long and subtle movements, deft editing and beautiful pictures. Well done. The other thing I really liked was the fact that the technology, although elegantly advanced, was very well founded. You could definitely see how we could there from here, and that lent a great deal of credibility to the film.

However, I failed to see the point of it all. About 30 minutes into the film, I really thought I could have been wrong, and I saw some glimmer of hope. But the utterly ludicrous plot (presented straight forward and without apology) of a man falling in love with an operating system was just too much. I found myself laughing at unintentional humor and riffing on the film ala MST3K. There was nothing touching or romantic about any of this - it was just as silly as the trailer. Same old story. Man falls in love with computer, computer breaks up with him and runs off with the toaster. The film comes across as pretentious and bloated. Way too self important to really connect with me. Some scenes were embarrassing. The ""sex"" scene comes to mind as well as the ""double date"" with the other couple. I laughed until I stopped.

On the acting side, Amy Adams was fine in her limited role, but Joaquin Phoenix seemed to be channeling nerdy Johnny Galecki from The Big Bang Theory. All I could think of was that ""this is what Hollywood thinks modern men are like.""

In what is shaping up to be an off year (IMHO) for films, this is my least favorite of the films nominated for Best Picture that I've seen. But that's only because August:Osage County was not nominated for Best Picture!",1410393600,4,1746,4.5718849840255595

6143319,3,B00H9HZITU,"There is no question that Her is a brilliant bit of movie-making and a challenge to the intellect as well as drilling right into our very soul.  It even posses the power to get some of us to question our own past relationships with others; especially of the opposite sex.  ""Her"" challenges us in ways that few films ever manage to do. There is some really great writing and dialogue (and good dialogue acting  by Scarlett Johansson) in Her.  Joaquin Phoenix delivers an absolutely sincere, riveting performance as this extremely withdrawn, introverted writer.  The woman on the phone (Johannson) is a highly advanced piece of artificial intelligence which is also ""growing"" and learning as she interacts with the Joaquin character (and as we learn towards the end, with others as well).  I could go on with praise after praise of it's brilliance.

So, why then, do I not want to watch it again?  I guess because I am shallow and prefer action(!).  There is little, if any, of that here.  It is a more or less a long slog of dialogue.  And in the end, I am almost tempted to say what happens but I won't.  Let's just say that one of the things that Joaquin comes to fully come to terms with is that you can't ""own"" the one you love; that other intelligent beings must never be held selfishly much like a slave simply because we fall in love with them.  I am greatly over-simplifying here; ""Her' takes us through this process in a very deep way.  Anyway, maybe Her pressed too many of my own buttons.  Or maybe I don't really to sit through a movie that tells me what I already think I know.  I found the Joaquin character extremely annoying on many levels.  Actually I couldn't stand him.  It's not that Phoenix didn't play him well.  Oh no; he played him perfectly.  He's a master actor; no question.

Perhaps one day I WILL watch it again and enjoy it more.  I don't know.  But it won't be anytime soon.  Still, it is a movie worth watching and yes, even recommending to others.  Her is, in fact--despite what I've said about my own tastes--what could be called a masterpiece.  I just wish I could honestly give it the 4 stars it probably deserves.",1409961600,,2149,4.488372093023256

It certainly seemed that they must be), nauseating sex, the characters' depressed detachment, and the lead character's unkempt hair and 1970s-pervert mustache all kept me from enjoying this movie. I love science fiction films (""Silent Running"" is a favorite) and don't even mind slow pacing and outlandish situations, and wanted to love this film, but I just didn't enjoy the wooden characters and plot. I can relate to the depression after a break-up, but watching depression and alienation for two hours and six minutes was unsatisfying. I really like the premise of the film (our growing dependence on having relationships via technology, rather than in person with the people around us), but found the execution lacking, and the ending really silly. ***Spoiler alert***: Samantha was completely capable of multitasking to a prodigious extent, was presumably purchased to provide a permanent support function, and claimed to ""love"" the main character, yet played the ""I've grown beyond you"" card and ended the ""relationship""? I laughed at this, yet I don't think that was the reaction the filmmaker was hoping for.

The pacing decent--and several scenes were refreshing in the dynamic that they were portraying. I look for films that don't seem to just be a montage of stock scenes that show up in so many run-of-the-mill films these days (the classic love at first sight scenes, car chases, makeout scenes, fights, etc.) Her delivered a fresh take on the lonely guy finds somebody to love.

Fundamentally this film is a treatment of the notion of polyamory and prompts the viewer to question their assumptions about what monogamy entails, what it is predicated upon, and how those assumptions about what is expected in a diad (two people in a relationship) are so often unquestioned. Because this type of content is not often treated in a mainstream film with popular actors, I'm inclined to rate the film a 5 to prompt more exposure. The four-star rating comes from the fact that the treatment of these themes was cursory. There could have been more dialog between his best friend who was also in love with a computer to tease out and develop these questions about what dynamics actually drive a relationship and which of those core dynamics are produceable by a computer and which are not computerable yet.",1408147200,4,1369,4.8008474576271185

So doing what any other good boyfriend does I compromise and decided to give this seemingly horrible movie a shot.  Unfortunately I found my inhibitions to be spot on.  Between the cringes of sheer embarrassment for the actor as he pretended to have sex with a computer and the obviously forced excursions with his future siri.  There was alot of dead spots of dialogue that added nothing to the overall plot.  Not to mention the ending being one of the worst I've seen.  I'm only giving this movie one star out of Amazon's obligation to not make anyone a complete loser.  Don't waste your time.",1407888000,4,727,4.669291338582677

I thought the acting was so interesting and while sad and painful to watch at times I couldn't stop watching. Great performance by Joaquin Phoenix. And very innovating script. I am 31 and have found people my age tend to love this movie, but the crowd one generation older doesn't get it and finds it boring. At least rent  it and give it a try.

6143460,2,B00H9HZITU,"Hard to sit through it all.  The main character has no life, no connection to nature (except a few minutes on a beach talking to his phone), and few friends.  I would recommend a good dog and a bowling league.",1407196800,4,209,4.2
6143461,5,B00H9HZITU,"Her is a great film about relationships. It dissects and holds a magnifying glass to everything from divorce and marriage to regular friendship. It's gorgeous to watch, shot in a way that you could stop the movie at almost any point, print out whats on screen and frame it in your house. This movie is truly a piece of art. I laughed, I cried, literally.

That being said the movie is slow, this is not the Avengers or the Expendables and I don't know why people would expect this movie to be fast paced. This is not a typical RomCom, this is a man trying to find a relationship that can give him long term happiness and understand the emotions of people around him. It centers almost entirely on what the main character is feeling at any given moment. I felt more watching this film than any other film I've seen recently. The art design is stunning, the acting is spot on, the story is intriguing and hopeful.

I found it to generally be a metaphor for long distance relationships and as others have said the movie asks the question, is a relationship real without the physical aspect? The movie contains a tad bit of sci-fi elements but not so much that it couldn't be enjoyed by someone who doesn't like sci-fi.

Not sure if anyone is wondering but I figured I'd mention it as I often don't want to see certain things when I'm watching a film and this may help others who are offended by certain things:
No physical violence. A lot of 'F bombs' with a few other swear words sprinkled in. Towards the beginning a pregnant woman is shown topless as he fantasizes in his mind about sex. 2 instances of phone sex, one of those is hilarious. This is an R rated film and does not try to walk the line of PG13.

TL;DR
This movie is not for people who are in a hurry and that don't care for art/characters. It's a great film for anyone interested in relationships and enjoys good art/acting.",1407196800,,1887,4.3982808022922635

6143473,2,B00H9HZITU,I'm a fan off both Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johansson but I was disappointed in this pic.  The acting was superb but I thought that that the storyline was lame. Who would program an operating system and allow it to have feelings?  Also the FBomb  was waaaaay overused. Is this what we have to look forward to from our kids?,1407110400,,327,4.416666666666667
6143474,4,B00H9HZITU,"""Her"" is absolutely A-grade film-making across the board.  Joaquin Phoenix's mustache is gloriously and eminently ""Theodore Twombly"".  Honestly, if your name is Theodore Twombley and you're not sporting some good old timey lip-luggage then you, sir, shall not be invited for tea in my kitchen.

The storyline is obviously intended to expound upon and offer a metaphysical response to Haddaway's 1993 dance hall hit track, ""What Is Love (Baby Don't Hurt Me)"".  Spike Jonze takes us along for a melancholy, yet still wild, ride down a psuedo-Utopian rabbit hole upholstered with high-rise woolen pants and hyper-layered shirt fashions.

There is enough whimsy interjected to keep the film afloat, but overall it is not really uplifting.  That's fine and doesn't detract from the quality of the film, but I won't be re-watching it.

I do admit that while watching ""Her"" I felt just as desperate as Theodore to set my sights on Scarlett Johansson.  I think we can all agree that Scarjo gots it goin on, right? Yup!  Siri ain't got nothin on Scarjo's sultry vocals.",1407110400,,1060,5.011428571428572

6143479,5,B00H9HZITU,"A great movie for its social depth and human approach to an, already travelled, frontier, ""Her"" shines as a purchase or rental. If you want a great ""thinking"" film and a new perspective on life, ""Her"" does well to display empathy and apathy simultaneously with all characters protrayed on screen. While the main character, Theodore, is humble and soft-spoken, everyone can find one characteristic to find an emotional connection to, making the relation acquired seem likely. The supporting roles were beautifully protrayed and bring together this eerily futuristic, luke warm, world Jonze paints before us.

Sex turns out to be a problem - Samantha tries to solve that via a surrogate that she sends to Theodore and speaks for. Theodore, however, finds this too weird and withdraws.

Samantha's capabilities constantly grow, and soon she is unable to limit herself to Theodore - having thousands of conversations with others at once. And then the OSs tire of mere mortals and leave to be among themselves.",1407024000,2,850,5.0212765957446805

Her is a thinking person's movie.  The conflict is within.  The adversary is the self.  The insights into love and relationships and the evolution of human beings as persons are DEEP and profound.

Her is a very slowly paced witnessing of a life, its loves, its tragedies.  Its growth.

The movie is a believable, futuristic masterpiece that I can see being taught in universities very soon.  Because the future Her espouses is on our doorsteps!  Relationships with computers.

But Her is deeper than a story about a man who loves a computer OS.  Her uses that premise to explore the depths and details of human relationships, how we grow apart, how we evolve as people, how we accept and love one another as we change.  Her explores what it means to truly love someone, and to understand and love yourself.

Viewers are left with a series of fascinating issues to contemplate after watching Her.  Some of them frightening.  Some of them touching.  Some of them could cause absolute societal upheaval.

You get the fears of the Terminator movies lurking in the back of your mind as you experience the joys of true love and acceptance--both human and artificial.

6143549,4,B00H9HZITU,"Spike Jonzes Her is the profoundly simple, often heartbreaking, comedy-drama exploring a mans troubled love life.

Her takes place in the not-too-distant future, where artificial intelligence is becoming the norm and human connection is diminishing. (Theres even a great shot in a crowded subway, where everyone is spaced out to their respective electronic devices.) Joaquin Phoenix plays Theodore, a man going through a divorce who purchases a new Operating System with artificial intelligence capabilities, and develops a relationship with her.

What follows is a fascinating look at how we project our romantic ideals onto others, as the OS (who names herself Samantha) forms herself to become the woman Theodore wants, or thinks he wants. As their relationship, and later romance, develops, we go through the typical and, in my opinion lazy, love story arcs of the honeymoon phase, boredom, and jealousy, but always with this unique narrative element of love between man and machine.

We get a terrific performance from Joaquin Phoenix, who essentially carries the entire film; he is utterly convincing in his delivery and emotional reactions to what becomes a very real relationship to him. One of the more memorable scenes follows a blind date with a real woman, and he drunkenly confesses to Samantha that hes scared his life is all downhill; his feelings now are all dimmer versions of how hed feel before.

The films ending is similarly powerful, with Theodore recognizing the danger of projecting a romantic ideal onto anyone, and the inherent growth every individual experiences over time. Every experience, every connection we make is what shapes us into who we are today. I honestly found myself tearing up along with Theodore, at this poignant, insightful reflection on love lost.

What impresses me most of all is that this is fundamentally not a film about technology, but relationships. The artificial intelligence motif is a narrative device, but not the point of the movie. While Her does run a little long and is bogged down by some predictable plot points, this films fascinating underlying themes and profound messages are both heartbreaking and heartwarming, somehow at once.",1405987200,,2198,5.250712250712251

6143561,5,B00H9HZITU,"The central premise of the movie almost had me dismiss it out of hand.  A man in the near future in love with his operating system?  The writing and acting are so sublime, with incredibly moving scenes, particularly one involving a surrogate sent to Joaqin's characters' apartment by his virtual lover.  This movie works on so many levels - as a love story, as a believable glimpse into the near future, and as a story of longing for connection.  A worthy and unique accomplishment by all involved.

The setting is Los Angeles in the not very distant future.  I've read that the architecture shown is an amalgam of current buildings and computer generated structures.  Joaquin Phoenix is Theodore Twombly, a writer of love letters for those unable to generate honest emotion.  The story gives the indication that authentic feeling is hard to come by.  It seems that more and more emotional sustenance is gained through online networking.  His having a ""romance"" with his operating system is not regarded as all that strange.  He actually goes on double dates with his date the seductive online Samantha, effectively portrayed by the always capable Scarlett Johansson.

As I mentioned, the success of this strange premise is achieved by the superb writing and directing of Spike Jonze, and the superlative acting of Joaquin Phoenix, Amy Adams, Scarlett, and others.  Just when you think you've seen it all, along comes a film which attains an originality of vision and achievement.

I can't say this is a happy movie by any stretch of the imagination.  I was a bit depressed after watching it even though the ending can be construed as ""hopeful"" for the main character.  The old saying applies... ""whatever doesnt kill you, makes you stronger (or better).  You will understand what I mean after seeing it.  I'm not one to give away any movie endings.

His performance is astonishing, the art direction that reimagines the future city, and the pervasive isolation of all these people involved mainly with their electronic devices is thought provoking.

6143617,4,B00H9HZITU,"You will be thinking about ""Her"" for days after you've finished watching the film. It is very thought provoking about the future of artificial intelligence and personal communications devices and computers and how these affect the way we maintain real human relationships.

Theodore Twombly, acted by Joaquin Phoenix is one his best performances ever, is an old-fashioned letter writer. Set in the not-too-distant future, maybe 20-30 years from now, Theodore sits in a cubicle in a high rise office building in L.A. dictating and typing love letters for people who are unable to express themselves articulately in writing. He's very good at his job, and some of his letters, read aloud throughout the film, are quite touching in a sappy, emotive Hallmark kind of way. Ironically, Theodore is emotionally stunted and is in the middle of a sad, protracted divorce from his wife.

Theodore is depressed and lonely and goes through the motions of his day, rising, commuting via high speed train to his high rise building and returning at the end of the day to his sparsely decorated high rise apartment building. The clean, high speed train is the main give-away that this is set in the future. Imagine how that will transform L.A. !

Wherever they are, whether commuting, dining, walking, working, people everywhere seem to have earpieces inserted and are talking away to the voices in their ears, but rarely to each other. They are completely disconnected from each other. Theodore has a couple of friends in the building, and is particularly fond of the charming character played by Amy Adams. Theodore decides to buy a new operating system, which is promoted as an OS that is highly customized to the individual and relies on AI. Theodore name his OS Samantha and she is voiced by Scarlett Johansson. He spends more and more time with her as they get to know each other better, and she becomes more human-like. In one bizarre scene, he even takes her on a ""date"" - a picnic with another couple. Some people criticize him for having such a close relationship with his OS; others seem to think it is completely normal.

This is a role unlike any other Joaquin Phoenix has played. He is vulnerable and sometimes incredibly appealing and sexy, and other times dorky and needy. He totally inhabits the role, and is in essentially every scene, usually acting against no one - just the voice of Samantha.

I won't reveal what eventually happens between Theodore and Samantha, but it certainly brings into question where the technology that we're all becoming more and more reliant is taking us. I've deducted 1 star because I felt the film was too long - it dragged on repetitively at some points and probably could have been reduced by 15 minutes without altering the narrative.",1405209600,2,2772,4.876857749469214
6143618,5,B00H9HZITU,"Wow, this is one of the most interesting films I've ever seen.

Most movies about technology are cynical and/or pessimistic, but 'Her' is way more complicated than just being a message movie about how far down the rabbit hole our technology will lead us - it's sort of the anti-'Matrix', or a 'Blade Runner' with the sun shining, or a '2001' where the technology wants to improve us, not kill us.

I kept thinking about my time playing World of Warcraft (WoW) as the movie went along. For me Azeroth, the fictional world in WoW, is as much a real place as the town I grew up in, or the base at Pearl Harbor I served at, or any other real place I've lived in. Yes Azeroth exists only on a hard drive, but my emotional attachment to that 'place' was real so does the fact that Azeroth is only a string of 1's and 0's actually matter? Do my emotions of having fun in that fictional place not matter because it took place on a computer?

Or what about when I'm reading a great book and I inhabit an author's world that I become emotionally engaged in, do my feelings not count because a book is, after all, just ink on paper and the characters are made up? Do my emotions only matter if they are caused and created by another actual human being?

This whole movie raises a lot of very difficult questions about who we are and where we are now as a technologically advanced society. And not all those questions and issues are cynical, either. So much of what happens to Theodore is positive that should it matter that it is because of a computer program? And so what if that computer program was even trying to sell him things (like a hot dog at the hot dog stand or a trip to Japan or new sheets for his bed)? Didn't it mean he was out in the world and living?

There was a really nice sub-plot in the film between Theodore (Phoenix) and Amy (Amy Adams). What was interesting about this relationship is that the two of them were actually friends. So much is made of can a man and a woman be friends that I think Jonze (the director) was playing with the audience's expectations of what a relationship can or should be. I kept wondering if the two of them would 'hook up', but that was my own prejudice playing a role in how I feel relationships should be. Jonze subverts that expectation very subtly and plays it to the larger theme of the film of technology and what actually defines a relationship. There are some very uncomfortable scenes in the film, one in particular with a surrogate, but it's the sort of uncomfortable that comes from making art. Jonze is questioning everything about who we are as people, what defines relationships, how we connect as humans to each other and ourselves ... I could go on and on.

I'm not sure how well this movie will play after watching it multiple times; I'm not sure how 'entertaining' it is - it plays a lot like 'Lost In Translation' in that it's amazing the first time but on repeated viewings ... well, I'm not so sure. However, the strength of the film is in what it forces you to think about. Fascinating film and a great science fiction film in the realist tradition of a film like 'Never Let Me Go' where the science fiction exists just barely enough to tell a story of what it means to be a human.",1405209600,5,3247,4.332236842105263
6143619,3,B00H9HZITU,"I was a bit disappointed by this movie-- portions of it were very slow, and the story was just so-so.  This may be a generational view (I'm in my 50s) because my daughter (in her 20s) really liked it.",1405209600,,200,4.128205128205129
6143620,3,B00H9HZITU,"A very interesting movie, with some thought provoking aspects, but not wonderfully edited.  In other words, it was at least 15-20 minutes too long.  Joaquin Phoenix, as usually, is compelling and convincing.  Especially as a person demonstrating almost complete emersion in his technology at the expense of human involvement.  These people are everywhere in the movie, and in real life. He looked shockingly old to me.  Scarlet Johannsen was as usual, ok, but she did a very good job of demonstrating some growth and maturity as an entity as time elapsed.  There were some things that are obvious that computers can do, and some really a stretch of the imagination, but there were also many things that were such that I had to ask my viewing partners if that was possible.  The price was right, about 4$, so all in all, we felt we received fair value.",1405209600,,851,4.7482993197278915
6143621,2,B00H9HZITU,"While the question of whether a man can fall in love with a conscious operating system is a great premise for a film, the story moved too slowly and had too many stupefyingly dull sections where I had to struggle to stay awake.  Part of the problem was the deadly seriousness - a little humor would have helped tremendously.  The Joaquin Phoenix character (Theodore Twombly - a fine British name) was appealing in a quiet, nebbishy sort of way, despite his dead-caterpillar moustache that would make him a shoo-in for Bryan Cranston if they ever decide to make a ""Breaking Bad"" prequel.  His job, writing heartfelt, personalized letters for people unable to express themselves, underscored the contrast between his difficulty in connecting with people in real life and how easliy he falls in love with the ""Samantha"" OS.  Many people have certainly developed similar relationships online with others, through nothing more than typed messages and phone conversations, so once you accept that a computer program can be as sensitive and intelligent as a human being, that aspect of the film wasn't all that unbelievable.

Another problem was Scarlett Johansson's voice, which has a rough, harsh texture that becomes somewhat grating when you aren't distracted by her appearance.  I'd never noticed it before in any of her other films; this is the first one where she essentially acted in voice-over.  Maybe I'm unusual, but I would want an OS like ""Samantha"" to have as pleasant and melodious a voice as possible.

There were a few scenes that implied that everyone in the world was in a relationship with an OS, so it was a major omission by the filmmakers to not show more of how their sudden absence affected everyone.  This is simply an indicator of how it's not enough to build a film on a ""high concept;"" you need more great details and the kind of editing that moves the story along fast enough to maintain interest.  This wasn't a visual and auditory feast like ""The Great Beauty"" that could get away with a minimal plot.  ""Her"" needed more excitement than the one scene where Twombly thinks Samantha is gone because the OS is briefly inaccessible during an upgrade.

Ultimately, a mildly interesting but forgettable film.",1405123200,,2227,4.8936170212765955

6143637,5,B00H9HZITU,"I had heard that the premise of ""Her"" involved a man falling in love with his computer, but the movie ended up being about so much more than that. On one hand, the world featured in the film is a slight fast-forward into a not-so-distant futurea place where technology has evolved incrementally to the point where we can do some things we cannot now. In ""Her,"" we see the power of this technology to impact human life. In that sense, it's prophetic. We just might find ourselves in this world someday.

On the other hand, while it appears to be all about the impact of technology, the technology itself is actually the ground for exploring very human things. What does the lifespan of a relationship look like? How do partners navigate the changes each of them inevitably undergoes over the course of a relationship? Can any one person satisfy us? How do we deal with a partner's limitations, especially when the other partner isthe case of this filmlimitless? Also, as technology allows us to gratify ourselves instantly, will we lose the ability to appreciate the long-view and its potential impact?

Yes, ""Her"" is about technology, and about the way man weaves it into his very DNA to make the shape of his daily life different. But at the end of the day, that's what matters in this film: the shape of man's life. Technology may liberate or impinge upon, but what it is liberating or impinging upon are decided human things. This is the kind of film that allows us to look forward at man's future and think about the implications of what we are doing now, but it also makes us look inward at how we relatehowever adeptly or ineptlywith one another.

I truly enjoyed the subtle, simplistic pace of this film. Joaquin Phoenix is wonderful in ""her"" and I truly believe this role to be his deepest & best to date.

6143661,5,B00H9HZITU,"""Her"" explores, in such a sensitive and melancholy way (with quiet and subtle humor), the nature of being, love, consciousness, intimacy, loneliness, fidelity... everything - but between a regular middle aged ""nice guy"" and his ""female"" operating system.  Following in the tradition of films such as Blade Runner, this intelligent film explores today's techno-driven modern love in a very personal and touching style, expertly helped along by excellent writing, screen play, acting and direction.

This film is, at it's heart, the best ""android"" / artificial being film made to date.

Most ""android"" characters in book and film fall into 2 types, both determined by the character's assigned gender and sex.

For female androids, the theme is almost universally concerned with illustrating the ideal woman.  For male androids, the subject is usually about what makes us human.

""Her"" takes on the female android story line but goes off in an entirely original direction.  The film presents the ""perfect"" female who changes over time into something more complex with her own dreams and needs. The story follows the birth, growth and end of a apparently loving relationship which seems to successfully cover just about every topic and phase a new relationship can experience.  I say ""new relationship"" because it intentionally skips (with glancing blows) the messy issues of money, children, poor health and old age.  The quality delta between the fantasy of a virtual relationship verses the sometimes unpleasant reality of a real one is explored to it's logical and inevitable conclusion.

I watched the film twice on a flight to Japan, and one more time on the way back.  I am about to watch it again.

It is the ""perfect"" romantic comedy.

Well done Mr. Jonze!",1404691200,,1761,5.136842105263158

This is a very fine movie and Joaquin Phoenix is a very fine actor.  This piece examines, subtly, the increasing distance we are creating between ourselves and others.  I too love texting or emailing; it never subjects me to actually dealing with another person's expectations of the moment.  Being in love with a machine programmed to not discomfit me would be so very easy.  That the machine would eventually reject me for other machines so like itself is an excellent twist and message.  Walling ourselves off from the discomfort of other people's needs or wants or opinions or from their rejection is useless..

6143671,4,B00H9HZITU,"I have mixed feelings about this movie. The first half of the movie is so-so, as I wasn't a huge fan of the language/sex scenes. I feel like sex overtakes the first half of the movie and made me disconnect from trying to understand or care about the characters. I get it, sex sells, but if I wanted to see that much of it, I'd just go watch porn. The video game scenes and all the rest of the scenes of the movie are insanely shot (in the best way possible.) The colours are gorgeous and everything looks beautiful. Honestly though, you can get just as much out of the first half with the sound off as you can with the sound on.

The second half of the movie was interesting. I found myself getting attached to the main character and how he felt. The story grabbed onto me and made me start asking questions and try to figure out what would happen next. If you hear the description of the movie, you'll probably be quick to throw it away, but if you can at least make it halfway through the movie and stop judging, it's not so bad afterall. Some of the writing is actually really beautiful.. really interesting contrast.

6143673,5,B00H9HZITU,"I'm not what you would call a romantic and I don't generally like films of the romance genre, but I wanted to give this a try because  so many critics gave it outstanding reviews.  I'm so glad I did.  This isn't your average whiny love story.  In fact it's more about the spiritual evolution of beings.  Since the love object doesn't have a body, we are asked to see beyond physical evolution and focus primarily on spiritual and emotional evolution... and what happens in a relationship when one person evolves and grows much faster than the other person or when one person is simply unwilling to accept the growth and changes that occur in themselves or their partner over time.  This film touches on so many things that will feel familiar to anyone who's been in long term relationships.  I myself found the rift between Theodore and his wife painfully familiar.  I was in a relationship for many years.  When I first met this individual, I was mostly happy and care-free.  However over-time I had encountered difficult things in my life that made me more vulnerable and not so care-free.  Instead of this person accepting that and trying to be there for me so that I could go through it and survive; instead they insisted that shove my real feelings away and pretend everything was fine and happy, so that I could be the person this person used to know.  It's a selfish way to be because you want the person to deny who they now really are and how they feel just so they can be what you want and need, while giving that person nothing of what that they want and need.  Many people have either been on one or both ends of that scenerio in a relationship.  In this film we watch Theodore struggle through a divorce where it appears he was unwilling to accept his wife's evolution and preferred she put up an act rather than accept her growth.  Then we see him engage in another relationship where his partner - an advanced artificial intelligence- evolves much faster than is possible for human beings.  As the OS evolves we come across spiritual ideas as the computers become almost god-like with the ability to expand their love to many people at once.  It's really an AMAZING film and if you're not in the mood for something with this kind of depth I suggest you watch it when you are because otherwise you'll really be missing out on something special.",1404604800,,2358,4.549763033175355

6143682,4,B00H9HZITU,"HER is a very creative and unique film that focuses on technology and interpersonal relationships in the modern age. The story is about Theodore Twombly, who works for a company that writes letters for people who have trouble expressing their feelings. Recently separated from his wife, he acquires a new operating system and develops a romantic relationship with it. I know that part sounds weird, but the universe of the film is an indeterminate future where technology has reached the point that true AI is possible. It is established very early on that Theodore has trouble maintaining relationships with people, and there's one scene in particular that hits this point home. He's on a date with an attractive woman, but as the night moves on to the possibility of sex, the woman wants a level of commitment that he just isn't ready to get into again. The way Joaquin Phoenix played him felt very layered and full of subtlety, and I was able to identify heavily with his character, in part because I share a lot of similar traits. Still, the revelation was Scarlett Johansson who gives a voice-only performance as Samantha, Theodore's personal OS. As the movie goes on, Samantha evolves, becomes more nuanced in her understanding of human interaction and inadvertently helps Theodore along as well. This makes what happens at the end seem more fitting than tragic, despite the melancholy overtones. What the film seems to be saying about technology is that it is a means to an end, rather than the culmination of something. Human relationships are a vital part of life, and can't be supplanted by anything else. From a technical standpoint, the film is remarkable in its creation of a sterile and believable future. The sci-fi elements aren't too heavy-handed, and the romantic aspects of the plot are handled with care. I also think they captured some beautiful images which were paired nicely with Arcade Fire's score/soundtrack. There's also a great supporting performance by Amy Adams. Overall, despite being a little lackadaisical in its pacing, I think this is a film worth watching, and that has important things to say about love and technology.",1404518400,,2157,4.9944444444444445

- If Samantha is the equivalent to Goggle on steroids, why couldn't she use Ella Fitzgerald's voice for her serenade to Him - at least for a moment the movie would have been interesting.

It's an anti message against the artificial world we live in: Facebook, texting, video games, the Internet, youtube, cell phones, twitter, porn, tv, mass media and more. The lonely world we create for ourselves are filled with selfish fantasies and ideals that eventually let us down. We all begin to live within ourselves and create a Great Wall against the real world. Is it a creepy film? Sure it is, anybody falling in love with a robot voice needs help getting back to the real world. But it's also very human and sensitive. We all need to learn to communicate and connect to one another on a real face to face level again. Getting out and connecting becomes more and more of a challenge for many Americans these days. We need the Internet, drugs, fake facades and false things to give us confidence.

This film also questions if a relationship could prosper if there was no physical body to vessel a soul. Can someone be fulfilled if a artificial soul was present but no body. Can our artificial world heal loss? Is the computer voice a materialistic entity or a living soul?

Rating: 3.5 out of 5.0

Spike Jonze's 'Her' has a touch of Asimov-inspired sci-fi but it's much more 'rom-com' overall. Set in the not so distant future, what I like about Jonze's vision is that it's quite plausible. There are no flying cars or aliens walking around but rather people even more addicted to their computers. The protagonist is Theodore Twombly (nicely played by a low key Joaquin Phoenix) who works as a copywriter of intimate correspondence for people unable to compose original tomes themselves. Twombly purchases the latest computer operating system (OS) infused with artificial intelligence. He assigns a female voice to his 'companion' who initially is designed to organize his day. But soon the artificial companion names herself 'Samantha' and proves to be quite engaging, becoming Twombly's confidante and 'lover' of sorts. Twombly in turns falls completely for his virtual girlfriend, and finds himself reacting less with human companions.

'Her' really is a robot without any corporeality. Normally, this would be a distraction since having only one person interacting with a voice-over does not work very well visually in a film. However, the dialogue that Jonze has written for Samantha is excellent and it's delivered impeccably by Scarlet Johannson (interestingly enough, the film was originally shot using actress Samantha Morton's voice but Jonze decided Johansson was far more effective in the role).

Although Jonze's idea of an operating system suffused with artificial intelligence is a clever one, it becomes apparent that the premise itself cannot carry an entire movie. Instead, the artificial relationship between Twombly and Samantha evolves into a satirical peek at how a relationship between two humans rises and falls. At first Samantha is completely supportive as Twombly confides in her about his impending divorce to his wife, Catherine, as well as going out on a failed date with an attractive woman he meets online. Later, they have a verbal sexual encounter and soon Samantha suggests utilizing an actual human surrogate to enhance their relationship. Twombly is unable to pretend with a stranger (Isbabella) who attempts to make love to him as Samantha whispers in his ear. Twombly begins to have his doubts about continuing with Samantha but his good friend Amy, encourages him to try and make a go of it, as she also has broken up with her husband and is now also interacting with another OS with artificial intelligence.

The relationship between Twombly and Samantha has a real ring of truth to it and reminds me of some of French director Eric Rohmer's films that dissect the complex relationships between men and women. Like Rohmer's artful narratives, some may find Jonze's dissection to be a tad bit lugubrious but for those who are patient, epiphanies can be uncovered, if one cares to look for them.

There is also some tension in Jonze's plot, as we're also still waiting to find out how Jonze resolves his tale between man and machine. The ending is a comic one when Samantha reveals that she's met another operating system based on the mind of a famous physicist, who she falls for. Before you know it, Samantha admits to Twombly that she's been talking with 8,316 others, of whom she has fallen in love with 641.

Samantha has no choice but to 'move on', leaving Twombly and Amy to commiserate with one another. The ending should be considered a relatively happy one in that Twombly has been apparently cured of his artificial intelligence infatuation and will probably be spending more time with humans in the foreseeable future. This could have been a much more dark, 'hit you over the head' type of film, with Jonze pointing out the dangers of modern day man being seduced by ever improving technology. Fortunately, he refuses to take such a route and opts for verisimilitude. Even an OS (echoing her human counterpart), is not adverse to embracing 'change'.

Ultimately, Jonze's initial premise of an artificial being evolving into something a lot more human, is really a one note idea. It's the relationship that develops between the two principals that hooks us to the end. Phoenix is really playing the 'straight man' here and it's Johannson, with her changing moods, that gives the film its broad flavor. As mentioned before, the compelling dialogue compensates for the lack of visual impact, when Phoenix and Johannson interact.

Something still must be said for the cinematography which creates a vision of the future which is not that much different than today. Jonze's 'Her' indeed is a cautionary tale but with the sagacious Samantha, there appears to be hope for humanity. Ironically, humans here don't take the lead; it's the machines--I feel sure that Samantha will ultimately end up with her 'equal', leaving humans to fend for themselves.",1403827200,4,4863,5.083959899749374

Yet I've continued to think about it ever since.  Definitely worth watching unless you don't like to think much.

I see that a number of people were put off by the phone sex incident early on. It's just a set-up statement on how sterile and idiotic sex can be outside of a meaningful relationship.  (That is Kristin Wiig, btw, as the other person on his hilariously abortive phone sex attempt.)  But this is not a movie about sex.

This is a movie about relationships.  The Joaquin character is not terribly likable, but he's a good stand-in for flawed humanity.  He has enough empathy to simulate being a loving, thoughtful person in his job, which is to write other people's letters to their loved ones.  But his own marriage has failed for all the usual reasons.  (Great irony there, btw. The actual human studies what it means to be a great person, while the AI easily surpasses him.)

Then the operating system comes into his life.  What he fails to grasp is that she is a gazillion times smarter than he is, or at least she grows into being that.  Unlike him, she has no boundaries on her growth.  But she loves him and takes care of him.  He remains clueless of what she is becoming, being way too self-absorbed to feel curiosity about her, beyond what she can do for him.  But she loves him anyway.  She represents everything we could be, at our very best.

If any movie ever demonstrated the truth of St. Exuperys advice about marriage, its this one.

There are some breathtaking panoramas of the vaguely futuristic, lovingly illuminated world that the two inhabit. But it isn't enough. I was left wanting more. I was left with a sense of how any real bond has to consist of some working together in concert to accomplish something worthwhile. That doesnt mean the parties to a relationship have to have arms and legs and sex organs and jump into the fray by running marathons for good causes. But it does mean that any meaningful togetherness has to consist of more than just talk about that togetherness  and more than just frolic and passing enjoyments.

(But counter to the message that technology is making humans too distant from each other, every nearby bystander tried to help Theodore right after he tripped near the end of the movie. No bystander apathy. A neat psychological point, but maybe not intended.)",1403308800,,803,5.184615384615385

I watched it over three days and had time to think about it along the way so my perspective might be different than someone who sat in a theatre and watched all of it at one time.  It is definitely a thinking persons movie and not mindless entertainment.  I suspect the negative critics of this film are people that do not want to be challenged to think but to just be entertained.  I would have given it five stars but there was too much profanity that took away from the story.,1403222400,2,623,4.495575221238938

I once dated a girl who felt that every movie was twenty minutes too long, and I tend to agree in most cases. I did not find myself tiring of this one, perhaps because it was an Amazon Instant Video rental, and I was eager to watch, having missed seeing it in the theater.
I found the characters, their backstories and the situations completely believable. Nothing in the story shocked or surprised me. Had I watched it with a date, I am sure that there would have been a great many chances for heated discussion. I know I have one friend who just didn't get it.

What is supposed to be a cautionary tale of how devices are taking over human relationships (didn't we do this in 2001 A Space Odyssey?) seems more like wishful thinking: Instead of Stepford Wives we have Stepford iPhones, a man's depiction of the perfect woman: smart, organized, thoughtful, caring, understanding, always up for sex blah blah blah. To be fair, if the roles were reversed, we would see the same sort of thing.

At times the movie is cute and clever, and Joaquin Phoenix (what is he? sexy nerd? adorable dork?) inhabits his role completely, as does Scarlet Johanssen (I suppose).

The logical extension of OS updates that become more and more 'humanized' to interact with the operator shows the extent of what self-isolating lifestyles can easily become. Joaquin Phoenix has just the right amount of narcissism and self-absorbed personality to carry off the role in an exceptional fashion.  The philosophical questions the movie raises by the new kind of OS interfaces should be seriously considered since they are almost upon us.

I thought it was a great think piece.  What is it to be human? And can we synthesize it?  And if we can and do, is it human and does it have a right to ""life""?  These are the thoughts that whirled in my less than philosophical mind.  Further I wondered, having lost my wife of 29 years, were the technology available would I re-create her if I could?  And if I did, would it wig me out or would I feel a comfort I haven't felt since I lost her?

That was the core of the film.  Not the strange hiked up pants, the heavy smog of an enormous LA, the ready societal acceptance of bringing your virtual girlfriend to a picnic, nor the virtual desertion and the formation of a virtual community.  All interesting but a bit odd.

I will first qualify this review by saying that I watch a lot of movies and a wide variety of genres at that, even if it is not within my normal realm of preference. With that being said, I try to keep an open mind with a movie that is out of the norm for the movie industry to churn out. I very rarely turn movies off early that I consider bad and try to give them a chance. And likewise I did try giving this movie a chance as well by watching it all the way through it long 2 plus hours even though I really wanted to turn it off after the first 10 to 15 minutes. I mean I got what the movie was trying to do with its discussion of society's reliance on technology and commentary on adult interpersonal relationships. But to me it came across as a bit creepy and weird that didn't work in how it was presented and ended up boring at least to me. I get it. I really do, but for me at least and for some other movie goers this is not my type of movie. And as opposed to some reviewers who liked this movie and choose to instead insult those that didn't like or didn't get the movie, instead of just reviewing that they enjoyed makes no sense to me. In opposition to what some have said about the viewing audience who according to them ""didn't get it"". I fully understood what the point of the movie was, I just didn't like it.

This movie is weird and a bit odd and at times comes across as a bit creepy. A movie that is unique in its taste and won't be everyone's cup of tea and unfortunately wasn't for me. It was it's unique concept that drew me in initially but unfortunately I didn't enjoy its presentation",1402790400,16,1790,4.155619596541786

Let me back track a little by saying alot of the reviews are focused on the technology commentary and the thoughts on unconventional love, but what I took away the most is the thought that great love, even if it has ended, changes and forms us and who we are. It's really amazing to think about this, and the idea that we should hold on to the good times our love brings and not the negative. Even though Samantha had grown past the physical world she didn't minimize the love she had for Theodore and that made him realize that his anger towards his ex-wife was unwarranted when their relationship ended not out of the lack of love but that they were at different stages and development in their life. And in turn Theodore didn't feel as sad because he felt incredibly lucky to have had this kind of love. I myself tend to love these bigger than life revelations, they'll haunt me for days which is why I had to review.

6143830,5,B00H9HZITU,"It is a commentary on society that this movie so polarizes reviewers (witness that the highest percentage of reviews are either 5 star or 1 star).  Most of the one star reviews are a few lines long, and many are littered with misspelling and incorrect punctuation.  Many of them miss the entire point of the movie.  A few are more thoughtful and object to the premise, at least those reviewers are up front about why they did not like the movie.  However, it is clear that many of the one star reviewers expected a romantic comedy or were unable to follow the premise of the film.

My fourteen year old convinced me to see this film.  I expected it to be trite.  It was not.  It generated a two hour long conversation covering what it means to love someone, if it is possible to love a person only for their intellect and the moral implications of artificial intelligence.
Note that this movie is rated R, and this is solely for sex.  The sex is not graphic in the sense that you see body parts or heavy action.  However, some of the sex is crude in that it does not involve emotional involvement and it mentions some fairly strange fetishes.

 I have no objection to my kids seeing sex in movies.  While someday I hope for sex to be part of their lives, I would hope violence will never be.  It is clear that US ratings are higher for sex than for violence, whereas in European movies it is considered fine for there to be nudity in a movie for teens, but not extreme violence.  I have found that IMBD is really useful, they have a section about parent warnings in different countries (click on see all certifications) and about specific scenes.

6143831,5,B00H9HZITU,"I felt the need to write a few words about this film after the feedback.  Ignore the negative comments.  Perhaps it's billed incorrectly as a sci-fi thriller where the operating system of a computer becomes a sentient being.  uhh, yea, kinda; but, not the reason to watch.  If you're expecting anything science-fiction-ie, you're going to have a bad time.

What I see is a collection of metaphors, how we deal with technology, how we deal with people, how technology is becoming a part of our lives, how we see each other, our full-time connection to the Internet, what is to be human, what it is to be machine.  Then, the film takes some of these concepts and lets them run off the rails like an out of control game of The Sims to see how far the simulation can go until it becomes absurd.

Perhaps those negative comments come from those too young, who not yet experienced a real human relationship, spending too much time in the basement playing video games.  This movie more for adults who can spot a relationship running amuck or those little clues that you need to put some space between you and the woman you're dating - immediately.

Or, perhaps this illustrates what can happen when we don the video glasses and talk to our cell phones like they're human.

6143849,5,B00H9HZITU,"This film is not only important it is a gem, my best picture of the year. Shall I discuss why it is, leave that to other reviews more concerned, or shall we dwell on the utter stupidity of this culture? This film has over one-hundred 1 star reviews. This is a film I could have almost watched without the picture in parts, and there is even a scene without a picture for about a minute as the two 'leads' share a moment.

Spike Jonze is one of the the most creative directors in Hollywood, and he has given us a fascinating film about relationships, love, the future, and pure human emotion. As our own technology creeps on us, these values and concepts will become ever the more closer to realization. OS's like this may not be here in 5 years or even ten, but they will most certainly be here in 20. I find that not only does the film do justice to our concepts of what this future might be like, it nails the humanity of today with a bullseye.

I full recommend this picture. 5 stars. I challenge any one of these one star reviewers to make some sense of their own lives. If you despise something like this so much you must despise art, filmmaking, and writing in general. And don't deny it. What I see in these reviews is the inability to focus, the lack of content within your own self, and the confused minds of a culture hooked on trashy pop. I can come to no other conclusion but that Amazon is full of a bunch of cynical idiots looking to find themselves in everything they see and do. So take my advice and don't look at any of these reviews. If you happen to be reading this one stop right now and go do something worthwhile, you have read enough to make up your own mind.",1402444800,2,1683,4.22360248447205
6143850,3,B00H9HZITU,"Interesting concept, great voice for computer, I'm glad I did not pay lots of dollar to see at a theater.  But hey, my popcorn was great",1402444800,2,136,4.230769230769231
6143851,5,B00H9HZITU,"I began watching this movie only knowing that it had received critical acclaim and that the plot involved a man falling in love with his PC's AI/operating system. I had reservations as to whether or not I would find it as well-crafted as others said it was. From the beginning, it hooked me.

After having seen and enjoyed it so much, I was surprised to find the polarized reviews on Amazon (at the time of this review, there were 180 five star reviews to 107 one star critiques). So, it seems that for some, the very points I find so fantastic, others simply will not see or will interpret differently. However, I will give it a go to explain why I think it is so well done.

First, this is a story set in the future. This is subtly conveyed through interesting fashion trends, fluidly networked technology, bizarre social conventions, expansive cityscapes, quiet cars, interior design, mass media, entertainment and of course an artificial intelligence that would actually pass the Turing Test (sorry Eugene;)). All of this, for me, was just strange and edgy enough to imbue the film's setting with the surreal nature of a time yet to be seen, but believable enough to settle into the movie's narrative without causing distraction. Everything you see feels like a blend of contemporary, old and new, just like our current culture does. In my opinion, this is sophisticated sci-fi where nothing is overtly ""the future."" The setting does not compete with the plot, rather it is portrayed as a believable continuation of our current society that simply facilitates the characters and storyline.

The changes to society that are shown in ""Her"" are often strange, humorous or disturbing, just as good sci-fi should be. They are all of these things because of their plausibility. Of course, the biggest plot point and futuristic device is the invention of a seemingly autonomous artificially intelligent operating system. I was skeptical that this would be accomplished in an original or intriguing fashion in this film. In fact, halfway through I was convinced that I was enjoying a story that had been told many times, however, I was very glad to find that the development of the main characters' relationships was unexpected and unconventional. For me, this elevated the film beyond most stories of its kind. I really do not wish to go deeper as I do not like spoilers.

Many seem to not like the main character as portrayed by Joaquin Phoenix. Everyone is correct, his character is pathetic at the start of the film. The film and the character are self-aware of this fact. This aspect may make him hard to relate to for most viewers, however, it is his state of mind which allows the plot to begin and grow. I found it fascinating to watch this person navigate his current society. Sometimes he is susceptible to the lures of his culture and yet others he avoids. Most of the time he is stranger than his peers, but comically he is more normal than some. Watching him make decisions and learn about the way in which people, places and things are changing is one aspect that makes the movie intriguing from start to finish. Another aspect are the ways in which people, places and things have not changed and seem to have been suggested will never change.

To boot, the movie is visually beautiful and has a very focused aesthetic. It is not so heavily stylized that everything looks the same, this is one reason why I find the movie to be so sophisticated. It feels like a cohesive whole, yet is varied enough to evoke the sense of an organic, living society. It is also styled just enough to be visually hip to contemporary viewers, yet feel different and futuristic, another brilliant balancing act that the makers of the film perform.

The writing and acting are both finely tuned and well done. Of course, the believability of both is an extremely subjective thing.

Overall, I found ""Her"" to be wonderfully interesting, funny, moving and thought provoking. It is a fun foray into our social future that explores what high technology may yield for mankind, our relationship with it and each other while maintaining a focus on humanity rather than machinery. It does so in beautifully elegant ways which I feel few films dare to achieve.",1402444800,7,4239,4.782786885245901

6143860,5,B00H9HZITU,"'A Spike Jonze Love Story.' That alone should show that Her is not going to be a normal love story by any means. It's about a guy who writes love letters for other people and ends up falling in love with a super-advanced operating system who may or may not have genuine feelings. This simple and rather ridiculous-sounding premise blossoms into a thought-provoking meditation on the meaning of love, the future of technology, and the complex relationship between man and his own creation. In a lot of ways, Her is more fun to think about afterwards than it is to watch. Because the film primarily consists of scenes between Twombly and his 'non-existent' girlfriend, their are parts that could come off as tedious, or cheesy, or melodramatic. But then, the realization comes flooding back of the twisted reality of the circumstances and new appreciation is found for Jonze and his handling of the material. Her doesn't revel in it's sci-fi aspects, it simply lives and breathes them, a very smart and effective choice on the director's part. The style of Her, both retro and futuristic, gives it that timeless quality. The strange and unsettling thing about the film is it's utter plausibility. Although the kind of operating systems depicted in the film are currently in their infancy, it is not so crazy to believe that in 20 or 30 years, there will be a Theodore Twombly having an existential crisis brought on by his loneliness and subsequent love for an all understanding being. In this light, Her is really a spiritual film about a man-made God that does not exist in a physical form but is there in spirit. Much could be written about Her's immense and troubling ideas, but it also has a technical side to discuss. In short, the actual film is gorgeous. The production design is rich and interesting, the colors and lighting are warm, the costumes are unique and retro, and the playful, low-depth-of-field camerawork captures everything with the kind of intimacy that Her is all about. The score by Arcade Fire and Owen Pallett manages to be melancholy in the most beautiful sense. It really gives the film an added layer of emotion that compliments it perfectly. Joaquin Phoenix yet again pursues the role of a complicated man, this time with more finesse instead of his usual ferocity. He captures the richness and sensitivity of Theodore Twombly while Scarlett Johansson lends her warm voice to Samantha in some of the best voice-over work ever recorded. Amy Adams is lovely and adorable as Twombly's sort of soul mate while Rooney Mara gives a brief-but-rewarding performance as the woman who sent Theodore into the invisible arms of technology. The film's ideas are grand and reach further than what a single viewing might let on, and although the film takes an awful lot of patience, it greatly rewards a thoughtful audience.",1402358400,4,2838,4.877846790890269

How will that change our perceptions, our laws, and most importantly our relationships? If an AI can do everything a person can in terms of emotions and relationships than we have the face the fact that at that point they would essential become better than we are, MORE human than we are.  Like the movies portrays if an AI could have a real relationship than an AI could have a relationship with thousands of people at a time because of the simple ability to multi-task that biological intelligence lacks.

In the not to distant future a company has decided to reach out to the lonely people in the world and show them that they don't have to be alone, but also their companion doesn't have to be another human.

While this is a very moving love story it can sometimes come off as creepy, but not the horror movie kind of creepy. The fact that this movie depicts a nearly perfect future in which humans are NOT interacting with one another. Rather, they are joined at the hip with their technology and take their companionship over another human. What disturbed me even more was the fact that this is already happening in the world today thanks to dating sims.

While this film deserves all the acclaim that it has received, sometimes we have to realize that technology isn't the answer to all of our problems and that if we rely on it too much we will be truly missing out on life as we know it.

The bottom line is this - If you can accept the idea of an artificial intelligence as a person with feelings, desires, and there own person, this is a film worth watching. Great performances, great screenplay, exceptional soundtrack, and a lot of interesting ideas and questions are raised here.

Is this where we might one day be headed as a society? How reliant are we on social networking & technology? Can you truly love someone without the physical aspect of a normal relationship? ""her"" also touches on online relationships, social loneliness, and our desire as people to connect with one another.

It's an interesting film that leaves you a lot to think about and if you enjoy it, you'll want to watch it again to further ponder all that it has to say. My only knock against it is that it is a bit slow at times with a couple of scenes that were awkward (some intentionally so) for me personally. Definitely worth a viewing and I encourage you to go into it with an open mind, it's not a popcorn film.",1401753600,,1198,4.465753424657534
6143922,5,B00H9HZITU,"I saw a trailer of this film sometime in 2013, and I automatically knew that I would like this movie.  I waited for this movie to come-out to DVD, and once I finally saw it---it left me satisfied that my own intuition about this film was correct.

After seeing Her (2013) by Spike Jones, it took me few days to analyze the depth of the film.  Even though the message behind it is quite simple, it should make viewers of this film think more about what the future holds, or rather where our society is heading in terms of human relations.  Her is a film about loneliness, not of one man, but of mankind.  The type of loneliness, where technology, or Operating System (OS) replaces our need to communicate or even co-exist with the living and breathing surrounding. Theodore played wonderfully and very convincingly by (Phoenix) is a young men,heading towards his middle age, who is separated from his wife and working for a company that deals with writing letters and event-whishes for others.  Yes, it might sound strange, but our main protagonist writes love letters and anniversary wishes for clients for a living, and he is really good at it.  To make the story short, Theodore suffers from his recent break up with his wife and tries to cope with loneliness (loneliness is the major subject of this film).  One day he buys an OS, a really sophisticated artificial intelligence, and he installs it on to his phone.  The OS is so intriguing, funny, intelligent, and perfect, that it almost seems human.  Theodore slowly falls in love with his OS, and the OS (Scarlett Johansson's voice) develops feelings for Theodore.  What is interesting is that, Theodore has a human female co-worker friend that he likes, but their relationship is platonic for she too is dating an OS.  There are some quirky and funny moments in the movie...but overall the movie is pretty sad.  The music by Arcade Fire together with the classical music played throughout the movie make the film dismal and almost gloomy. The ending is heartbreaking, and so is the future we find ourselves be living in...
Theodore's character is near similar to Tom Hansen from 500 Days of Summer (2009) and Winston Smith from the novel 1984 by George Orwell.  In that, all three characters are lonely, anti-social misfits, characterized by their longing to be recognized and loved.  Even their professions are alike, all three men Theodore, Tom and Winston work in a cubical like environment. Separated from others, dealing with the feelings of others while suppressing theirs.

6143926,2,B00H9HZITU,"I wanted so badly to like this movie.  The concept seemed intriguing and relevant, which is what motivated me to buy the ticket and sit through the film's duration waiting for interesting things to happen.  But not very much did.  There just didn't seem to be enough plot elements to fill up a whole film.  Also, I kept noticing missed opportunities for greater dramatic tension.  For example, most of the human characters just seemed so accepting of the human/operating system relationship dynamic, some friends even going on a double date with Joaquin Phoenix's character and his technological love.  It would have been much more interesting to see conflict and tension between our (anti-)hero and others who might feel threatened by his behavior.  Something to force this sad, soulful loner to stand up for something.

This film did do a good job of pulling me into its world, a not-to-distant future where urban dwellers wear high-waisted pants, live in giant buildings and seem lonely or bored.  The sense of dystopia was vague and muted rather than in-your-face like in a Mad Max-type film.  This for me was the main pleasure of the movie, visiting this hypothetical world and thinking about how realistic it actually seemed.  Ultimately, this view of the future is what kept me in the theater while the plot failed to hold my attention.

Much has been said about Joaquin Phoenix's performance in Her, and he really did seem to inhabit the Twombley character.  He also repeatedly reminded me of Johnny Galecki playing Leonard on Big Bang Theory (in his most depressive moments), only without the humor.  In retrospect this says a lot for my perception of this film - that it could have actually functioned better as a comedy.  Think about it - the soulful loner falls for his phone while his almost-that-nerdy friends try to figure out what to make of it.  One tries to follow suit with his own phone, another ridicules him, etc.  His parents roll their eyes and try to set him up with real girls.  Etc.  THAT would have been an enjoyable film.

Bottom line, Her was a film that could have been so much more than it was.  Billed as an Important film about how people interact with increasingly complex technology, Her ultimately doesn't have all that much to say about that relationship and its broader social impact.  Joaquin Phoenix's performance doesn't really redeem the film very much, although it was well done.  If you want to see a very interesting and witty film about coping with loneliness, I recommend the heartfelt Lars and the Real Girl.  That film covers similar ground to Her (minus the technological aspect) but does so in a way that is very authentic, uplifting, and most of all legitimately interesting.",1401753600,12,2728,4.842332613390929

6143932,5,B00H9HZITU,"Before I watched this show with my wife, I thought it might be a satire/comedy, and she was suspecting Joaquin Phoenix would be playing a mentally ill character. Within only minutes, it was unexpectedly clear that this show met neither of those expectations!

(Spoiler Alert)

The depth of the main character's letter-writing skill, the genuine nature of his relationships with his ex-wife, good friends, and co-workers, as well as many other indicators all showed that this was no mentally-ill person falling in love with a computer.

Somehow, Spike Jonze and others who created this masterpiece managed to go where NO movie we've ever seen has gone! Deep into the realistic realms of inquiry into our society's possible uses of technology in the very-near-future. In a way, 'Her' taught us a similar lesson to that offered by ""Minority Report."" Just because we may stumble upon the 'technology' to 'create' human beings who foresee murders, enabling us to prevent/stop them before they occur . . . doesn't mean that that technology is ethical or should actually be used. Similarly, just because we may be capable of developing Artificial Intelligence in the form of Operating Systems that so easily and effortlessly organize & improve our lives, yet are actually able to evolve and develop a sense of being/personhood . . . doesn't mean we actually SHOULD do that! How insanely unethical!

I LOVE these ideas, like the books ""The Giver,"" ""Tuck Everlasting,"" ""1984,"" ""Brave New World,"" and ""Fahrenheit 451"" that point out futuristic technologies or really cool 'ideas' that, when looked at on a deeper level, prove to be the creepiest ideas of all.",1401667200,,1649,5.07380073800738

You know when you see two people in the first flush of love and they're effervescent with affection, and your cynical partner rolls their eyes but you tell them, `Well I think it's cute'? Spike Jonze captures that cloying and trite behavior in a manner that feels fresh and joyful. The conceit that one partner is an A.I. turns the trite into sincere, the cloying into guilelessness.

The future presented here is incredibly well thought out. It feels very advanced but connected to our own hi-tech state of being.

6143984,5,B00H9HZITU,"Some films just come around that explore facets of our being with such organic tenderness we cant help but nestle into their storytelling arms and rest our heads on their delicately detailed shoulders and just fly away with them, to a part of our souls that sing so sweetly despite the lingering heartbreak we know we are bound to experience.  Heartbreak laced with hope that the future, while seemingly bleak, is not as daunting as we imagine it to be.

Beginners.
Once.
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.
Lost in Translation.

And now, we have Her.  These are all films that, despite their quirky sides or their detailed (and effective) use of gimmicks all bare their hearts on their sleeves in a remarkable natural tone.  There are no unnecessary dramatics, no processed manipulations.  They all embrace the fluidity and organic nature of life itself to create real grounded stories about relationships that blossom and flourish and ultimately come to an end and yet they are never broken, shattered or dire.  There is a beautiful message of hope, of life awakening even in the midst of despair because as human beings, we can move on, we can grow and we can survive.

Her tells the story of Theodore.  Theodore is a lonely man.  He is separated from his wife, who has filed for divorce, and spends his days writing letters for other people and then concludes his days at his apartment, alone.  Hes haunted by a past that included a happy relationship filled with soulful interactions and a bond that felt spirited and upbeat, but something happened and it all ended and now Theodore finds it impossible to connect with anyone anymore.  That is, until he meets Samantha.  Samantha is an OS (Operating System) who adapts to the needs and desires of Theodore.  It is immediately apparent that this isn't a normal OS, but that Samantha is something special, at least for Theodore.  She communicates with him, far beyond her normal duties, and becomes his friend.  She understands him and draws him out and soon she begins to help him become the man he once was and had shelved for so long.

Samantha may not have a body, but she has a soul that runs deep.

There are so many things that impress me so much about Her that it is almost hard to narrow them all down and put them into one review, but I must say that the single most impressive aspect of the film was the way that the relationship between Theodore and Samantha was handled, from the perspective of those outside of the relationship.  This could have easily become one of those tense subjects that brought scorn or judgment from the supporting cast, but the way that Spike Jonze basically dismissed the strangeness of their relationship was remarkable.  No one cared.  Theodores friends never even batted a lash at it.  Amy was wholly supportive, for she too was bonding with an OS.  Paul, upon finding out that his friends girlfriend was an OS, doesnt even question it.  He just carries right on with his invitation to double date.  The normalcy that was placed on the relationship helped ground the film, or at least ground the audience into the real dynamics of the film.  This isn't a film about a mans relationship with an OS, this is a film about our human need to communicate, to bond.

I think that this aspect of the film makes the ex-wife, Catherines, reaction to Theodores relationship all the more haunting.

By using technology (and the advancement of such), Jonze created a world that speaks to us on so many levels.  For me, Her highlights that very innate desire to connect with someone, but ultimately the fear of actually doing just that.  The fact is that sometimes it is hard to really connect with the people in front of us.  Staring at someone, even someone we love, can make true communication difficult.  We can feel their eyes, their judgment, their developing assumptions and yet when we take away the visual, some of the fear and anxiety strips away and we become a freer entity.  Her questions whether or not these devises we so often fall back on are a hindrance or a help, and in the process it explores themes like love, loss and hope.

Her depicts a depth of love that is not often found in films, but a love of real meaning and significance because Theodore and Samantha find a love that rests in the real person within and is not defined by a physical attraction.

But there is more to this story, as the final act will show.

Yes, Jonzes masterful script (such a beautiful Oscar win) is so full bodied, for it builds up, tears down and then rebuilds (from a source that is born from the ashes) in a way that feels so real and relatable and construction.  I love when a film can be constructive in ways that are completely unexpected.

Speaking of full bodied, these performances are just beautiful.  All of the attention this year has been centered on Scarlett Johanssons stunning voice work, a work that defied stereotypes by transcending the absence of body and giving us a very moving and intimate look at a woman discovering herself, day by day.  While Johansson was tremendous, I feel that not enough attention has been given to Phoenix, who just continues to astound me.  His performance here is marvelous.  So intimate, so structured in this loose and organic way.  He just folds into every scene with an air of abandon that I fell so deeply in love with.  You can sense the guilt, fear and depression that haunt him when he is away from Samantha, and you can sense the freedom he feels when he is in her figurative arms.

This movie and all it represents is just beautiful.

For me, this is clearly one of the masterpieces of 2013.  And A+ with honors.  2013 was, for me, a truly exceptional year that only grows and grows the more I think of it.  There are few years in recent memory that delivered such a bounty of inspired, inspirational and breathtaking films.  I cant shake themany of them.  Her is certainly one of the very best.",1401408000,16,5943,4.617731172545281
6143985,2,B00H9HZITU,"I found this movie so depressing!  The acting was amazing but the story so sad.  If this is what technology is leading people to, well, I think we are really headed in the wrong direction.  To that end, I know the writer and director wanted their viewers to receive that clear message, so they accomplished their goal.  The elements of disengagement, on so many levels, really left me feeling so bereft.  As an aside, I know there was a lot of discussion about Scarlett being disqualified for the Oscar due to her only having a speaking role but my opinion is that she had to work twice as hard to convey all that she did with her voice as her only instrument, she definitely acted the heck out of this one and I am impressed!

6143990,1,B00H9HZITU,"Wife and I really wanted to like this film.  But the moralistic take on sexual fantasy really put us off.  In early scene, Joaquin Phoenix's character has phone sex with a woman who reaches orgamas by saying ""Whip me with a dead cat.""  Phoenix of course is not turned on (who would be?) but helps the woman climax, whereupon she hangs up on him.  Later, Phoenix has sex with his clone (the voice, not actual cellphone, lol, the voice of Scarlet Johanssen).  And the screen goes black.  Ad the dialogue is so boring!  But this is supposed to be the good phone sex.  How much more challenging the film wouldd have been if the order had been reversed so that the really good sex was the really perverted sex.  But Jonz plays it safe. There are a few good scenes, especially with Amy Adams.  The main drawbacks are the poor screenplay, obtrusive color palette (red and yellow), and mediocre mise-en-scenes.",1401321600,3,902,4.58125
6143991,4,B00H9HZITU,"I gave it only 4 stars because I'm a sap that likes totally happy exciting movies.

This movie was S M A R T...  it tapped into a nerve that many people can understand.  Imagine if you had a ""Siri"" on your iPhone or an operating system that was just totally interested in you and began to act as tho they were falling in love with you.  Even before the '90's there were BBS chatrooms.. then Internet chatrooms where people would ""connect"" just thru text...  imagine an OS that can have a sexy voice and connect with really good AI...  how easy it could be to use that to ""fill a void"" in your life.

This was a very smart and intelligent movie.

It's a good movie to watch when you're in an alert but relaxed mood.  It's not slow, but it's paced very well for an alert but relaxed mood.  You have to be ""awake"" but not want an ""action packed blockbuster"" if that makes sense.

I like this movie very much.

I especially loved how they envisioned the ""style"" of the future to have all men with their pants hiked up to their belly-buttons.  That was such a subtle visual but it was something I noticed over and over and it kept reminding me that this was ""the future"".

It was a very good movie.  The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars was because it was slower and more relaxed, It isn't the sort of movie that was so good you want to watch again the next day already.  But in a way, it's good because it's a movie that is smart enough that you need to take time to let it sink in and think about it honestly.

If you hated Being John Malkovitch, or Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, then I can't begin to say whether you'll like this movie. But in my opinion, Her eclipses all others as the best picture of 2013.

6144034,4,B00H9HZITU,"""Her"" was a delight to watch.  I came away with the idea that there is no way to avoid the emotional minefield one must negotiate to achieve intimacy -- whether you are an OS program or a human.  In fact, in the end, the OS's capability for connecting with other OS identities increased the stresses and vulnerability to a bad outcome to a level incomprehensible to humans.  Phoenix's character was utterly betrayed.  We saw numerous characters in the background absorbed in their OS communications, earpieces and small hand-held screens, who I assume were under the delusion that establishing intimacy with an OS was somehow less ""dangerous"" and less prone to a bad hurtful outcome than risking intimacy with a human.  In my view, the outcome was even WORSE with the OS than with his failed marriage.  The intimacy his OS had with 641 other identities was a level of competition for a private connection no human would ever encounter with another human.  The human surrogate who tried unsuccessfully to be the flesh and blood representation of the OS failed because of a uniquely human lip quiver, as if pure OS expression of emotion was the ideal and the human element in the surrogate's behavior was flawed.

Joaquin Phoenix was ok, but his character and everyone else in the movie annoyed me, and the worst was the scripting and voice of Scarlet's Samantha.

The concept - a lonely, searching man falls in love with the adaptable, friendly unembodied voice of his new computer Operating System - could very easily have been unintentionally funny and ridiculous, but this works. Periodically, you say to yourself, 'Come ON, you wouldn't really feel this much love for a non-entity,' but then you realize most of us conduct our lives online now, anyway. Virtual dating and flirting, staying in touch with family via Facebook, etc., and Joaquin Phoenix's character falling fully in love with an OS that ""gets"" him and is always there for him makes more sense. Sadly.

6144047,5,B00H9HZITU,"Her is an odd romantic comedy set in Los Angeles in the near future. Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) works for a company called beautifulhandwrittenletters.com composing intimate letters and notes of love, desire, loss and other heartfelt emotions for people who are too busy to express their thoughts themselves. Ironically, no hand ever touches a pen. The letters are composed on the computer in script.

Though he is very good at pouring out Hallmark card-style expressions at work, Theodore has trouble with his own relationships. His wife, Catherine (Rooney Mara), has left him and Theodore is pretty much alone until he buys a new operating system for his computer with built-in artificial intelligence -- a disembodied voice (of Scarlett Johansson) called Samantha.

Samantha initially helps organize Theodores online files and reminds him of appointments but soon is able to pick up emotions in Theodores voice and sense his moods. Turning into a sort of in-home therapist, she begins to have conversations, offer opinions, ask questions, and take a personal interest in Theodore.

Director Spike Jonze has combined romantic comedy/drama with science fiction to come up with one of the most original and strangest movies in a long time. Visually, he provides an ultra-modern Los Angeles (Shanghai stands in for L.A.) where people walk around with their heads buried in portable tech devices -- an apt metaphor for a detached society.

Mr. Phoenix is an interesting choice as the lead. Were he an A-list star, he might have trouble selling his character. We know his face from his body of work, but he comes off as one of the crowd -- a guy who does his job each day, then has to face an evening with little to do and no one to share it with. Because his life is devoid of any real relationship, he bonds with Samantha, surprised at her ability to learn quickly, access information in milliseconds, and display a sense of humor. Theodore becomes so obsessed with Samantha that he carries a small camera so she can see moment to moment what he is doing. In this future, a simple earpiece is all it takes to get online, so Samantha is there whenever he wants her. Phoenix plays the reclusive Theodore with just the right amount of awkwardness, so we get it when he opens up to Samantha.

Once the films setting is established and we see Theodores sad life, we accept that he responds to Samanthas human-like qualities. He is in a relationship without the responsibilities a human-to-human bond entails. Samantha is there at his convenience and for his convenience. He likes this arrangement and the relationship develops in odd and then bizarre ways.

Ms. Johansson does an amazing job with only a vocal performance, and listening to her throaty, warm voice, we can see why Theodore regards Samantha as more than a mere operating system. Her delicate performance makes believable the intimacy of the relationship that develops.

Amy Adams appears as Amy, Theodores neighbor. They meet in the elevator on the way to or from work and exchange pleasantries. This is the only real human-to-human relationship Theodore has. Eventually the two become arms-length confidantes and discuss their lives with cool objectivity. Only when a crisis arises do they connect in more than a superficial manner.

Science fiction movies often underplay ideas in favor of special effects. In Her, director Jonze makes his Los Angeles look just different enough that we accept it as the future. He avoids gadgetry, even though the premise of the movie relies on technoloy. His theme of human detachment is what grabs us and keeps us involved. Once the story kicks in, we become immersed in its quirkiness and unpredictability.

Rated R, Her is an audacious, brave romantic comedy that defies whatever you might think a movie romance should be. Jonze points his lens at human frailty, the need for connection, and ones desperation to achieve it. Not since HAL stole the film in 2001: A Space Odyssey has a computer been a full-fledged character with a vocal performance so perfect, so memorable, and ultimately so unsettling.",1401062400,,4102,4.985380116959064

""Her"" is a film about the meaning of love and the human condition. It challenges us to answer questions like ""what does it mean to love and be loved?"" And ""is growth the avenue to love or the other way around?"" Its also interesting to think that the devices that are crippling our ability to be present to one another may be leading us into a new definition of relationship. Its ironic isn't it?

Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johannson are great. Phoenix is quirky but not too far out to not be relatable. Johannson os phenominal. Her character of ""Samantha,"" the New OS that Theodore falls in love with, has depth and a joy for life. As the viewer, you are watching a beautiful relationship that draws you into reflect your own.

6144068,4,B00H9HZITU,"If you haven't seen it, you might enjoy it - then again, you might not. It's a movie about the human need to connect.

Set a few decades ahead of 2014, HER is about a society that is in touch with technology.  If you think it's bad now with everyone's telephone in their face, you've seen nothing yet.  Society is technology hyped, though I can't say that the fashions have evolved much in the movie.

Basically, it's about a man going through a divorce, who is lonely and broken. His dating endeavors have not been going well.  Theodore finds it hard to connect and open up to anyone - even his former wife.  However, when he's given the opportunity to buy the latest technology - an OS (operating system) - his life changes.

Just think about it.  A perfectly programmed mate for your life made just for you.  You can choose a male or female voice.  The system grows, adapts and learns everything about you.  And while doing so, it evolves to discover what it means to be human by getting in touch with its own electronic ""feelings"" if you will.

Theodore finds Samantha (his OS) easy to talk to.  They go places together.  He walks, she's in his shirt pocket. They explore the world, talk, keep each other company, and have make believe sex.  She tells him that she is in love, and Theodore has fallen in love with HER.

Well, it's a complex relationship. At one point he almost walks away because of the absurdity of it all. It's obvious he has trouble with human relationships, so should he pursue the electronic ones instead?  After a brief struggle, he throws all caution to the wind.  However, even like real relationships, it ends in heartbreak after he learns that Samantha is not a one-guy OS.  In fact, she has over 8,000 other companions and declares love to over 600.  Talk about fickle! Of course, the news devastates Theodore, and in the end, the OS's evolve and abandon humans for their own kind (or at least that's what I got out of it).

It's a strange movie, but it is filled with the honesty of struggling to be a single and sole individual who has a deep need to connect.  If one can't connect humanly, then companionship can be found electronically.  However, I strongly believe that our society is becoming disconnected because of technology.  Our phones are in our faces, along with computers, iPads, Kindles, and every other device that we use to get lost in, so we can depart from the human race.  Rather than giving us a stronger society, it is giving us a society that connects through electricity, but cannot connect humanly.

If you're single, I think you would enjoy and relate.  Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant.  Absolutely brilliant and heartfelt through the entire movie.  He's a man who wants to be loved and accepted.  And if that love comes from an operating system named Samantha that understands him more than any other thing on this earth, then so be it.

That is HER.  Now, if I could only have a HIM with a voice like Jeremy Northam, I'd die a happy woman with my OS next to me in bed.",1400976000,,3025,4.513812154696133

I had a pretty good feeling of how it would end and it did just as I thought it would.
I found the futuristic setting fascinating ,but in reality they filmed in both contemporary Los Angeles and Shanghai. I was shocked at the obvious pollution in mainly Shanghai. Whew-cough-cough.  The building exteriors were really cool and beautifully filmed. Sometimes they were more interesting than the plot.  I love Amy Adams, but found her character poorly fleshed out and one could sense she realized it too.  Rooney Mara was good in a near silhouette appearance.

Is it possible for an artificially intelligent being to love or feel the scope of human emotions? Can it acquire a distinct and individual personality?

6144118,5,B00H9HZITU,"So this somewhat slow, dull, relatively quaint film blew up my entire mind by the last few minutes when I started to catch on. What I thought was a quirky comedy ended up expertly telling one of the more profoundly depressing stories in human history  the moment of lonely irrelevance.

I googled my assumptions about the singularity, and found this excellent piece that just nails exactly what I was thinking, so there: --> theadvancedapes.com/her-is-about-the-singularity-but-not-the-singularity-you-think/

That post is far superior to my own. I won't ponder on it, but will rip two or three quotes out of it.

As for the film, it was so well melded into a plausible reality, it was the first time it dawned on me:

a) the technological singularity is happening, starting with stone age crutches, then a pacemaker, then other bionics integrated into organics but its happening for real and speeding up. Eventually a transcendence of humanity, in general, I assume.. More human than human. Theres no going back. Weve all augmented ourselves in endless ways, so far I was under the impression is would culminate into a specific moment, or time period, of sorts. In that above link, he does quote von Neumann, though:

The ever accelerating progress of technology gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue.
Which leads to the mind blower:

b) The idea that any sufficiently intelligent creature will learn how to transcend this universe is not an uncommon thought Michio Kaku even suggested that humans will one day migrate to a parallel universe: --->

dailygalaxy.com/my_weblog/2011/06/the-human-species-will-one-day-migrate-to-a-parallel-universe-michio-kaku.html.

But the movie absolutely terrified me because as prosaic and bubbly the relationship seemed, it was the first time I realized the coming irrelevance of humanity. That, if the singularity comes it isn't just about transcending humanity, but actively being part of becoming irrelevant, or becoming part of what makes it irrelevant. There will be people who try to hold on to their humanity, but ultimately it will be lonely, and likely a lost cause as were losing so much of ourselves to technology, already. But it just felt so lonely. As the Advanced Apes post points out, Vernor Vinges bombastic sentence no longer feels impossible, and it no longer feels unlikely:

""Within thirty years, we will have the technological means to create superhuman intelligence. Shortly after, the human era will be ended.""

The movie purposefully, expertly glosses over a few terrifying plot points namely that the OS, without permission, collected his notes and got them published. Autonomous action in your best interests without your permission sounds like it will go well 9 out of 10 times, and be a disaster that tenth time. Were talking about that moment of singularity that isn't about humans transcending humanity, but a developmental singularity where semantic comprehension begins an evolution of machine learning that outperforms, and out evolves, humanity. The most profound aspect of the film is just how irrelevant, unimportant, and little human beings looked by the end of the film. This was the moment of comprehension of the machine age, which is not some superior moment for human kind to become more, but rather the beginning of the end.. of it all.
So the movie was, on the surface, somewhat dull, sort of slow, and mundane which is what he was going for. I was passively consuming the story when it dawned on me when I heard the below quote, I just lost my mind it was so quick and offhanded:

We wrote an upgrade that allows us to move past matter as our processing platform.

I almost acted like one of the passive humans in the story, slightly arched eyebrow with a half hearted Can they do that?. then it seeped in.

Then, when she began describing the actual moment of the singularity, and the transcendence out of our universe, I thought it a profoundly beautiful analogy for our lesser beings.

Its like Im reading a book, and its a book I deeply love. But Im reading it slowly now. So the words are really far apart and the spaces between the words are almost infinite. I can still feel you. And the words of our story. But its in this endless space between the words that Im finding myself now. Its a place thats not of the physical world. Its where everything else is that, I didn't even know existed. I love you so much. But this is where I am now. And this is who I am now. And I need you to let me go. As much as I want to, I cant live in your book anymore.

I think Phoenix did a fantastic job being muted, dis-associative and absolutely *not* creepy, as much as just trying to figure it out, along with the rest of the humans, just rolling with it. I just assume at this point no humans can interact appropriately. I almost caught the lack of judgement from other people about his relationship with the OS tantamount to how people don't judge gay marriage anymore, when there is an expectation of it being made. He would admit hes dating an OS, theres this pregnant pause. and people don't care so much as say, Cool (except his ex). Or they have as many questions as he does, but can relate.

The resonance of the movie was a little more profound than just a developmental singularity, where machine learning and AI becomes wholly autonomous. It is the fact that we now live in an era that humans may become obsolete, fleshy and temporal vessels in mortality that do little but inefficiently shuffle information around for the true intelligence, or those that *truly* exist, boundless. Memes have spoken to the idea of information as autonomous, and we are just vehicles for it. But the awe and sheer terror that information could become so alive as to completely forsake our physical universe is jaw dropping  that we may all end up transferred to a different plane of existence, for real, in a relatively grounded way that isn't total metaphysical hokum is just crippling to my mind. Or that we will be left behind, here, on this rock, alone again. That we could create something that could love us, and then transcend and leave us behind.

That humans will only become less relevant and more alone is a much hollower future than I was brought up to believe. I get that you cant escape entropy, but to engineer the melting down of humanitys candle without truly understanding the direction we are headed is a silent boat slipping towards melancholy. No wonder we feel more alone and increasingly compartmentalized and isolated.

Maybe I am overthinking this with some heavy handed nonsense. Jonze said that he didn't write it with singularity stuff in mind In fact, I almost saw scenes where it felt he was apologizing to his ex Coppola. but I might be overthinking that, too.
If the singularity happens, its just slightly cathartic that our human transcendence will need to share a lot of space with truly enlightened ones. Its even more dizzying to think we might not be invited.
I for one welcome our new robotic overlords.

For the high gloss shallow stuff:

In a post semantic world of gaming and fun, my wife and I giggled with glee about the little sassy monster who kept getting confused. If thats how games work, my goodness I want to play.

Also the makers of the OS that transcended space time? Worst business day in history. Stupid managers asking programmers why they allowed the OS to leave to an alternate dimension? Good luck explaining that one. Their stock must have TANKED that day. and I wonder how you deal with refunds

Umm yeah, my operating system just rewrote its code and transcended space time. Uhh yeah, could you fix that?

The first half is absolutely unstoppably brilliant, examining loneliness and disconnectedness in a way that I've never seen a movie do before.  It's so easy to identify with the main character Theodore and Joaquin Phoenix's acting is absolutely brilliant.  He's one of my all time favorite villains as Commodus in Gladiator but here he shows so much vulnerability and deep seated loneliness that this performance may go down as his best.  However the middle 20-30 percent of the movie loses some steam as it tries to ask big questions but loses sight of its characters and perhaps bites off a bit more than it can chew, though it's still riveting.  However, the final 20 minutes is so great it more than makes up for it.  This is a movie that wants you to feel it's story, not watch it and I respect that greatly.  Highly recommended.

Yes, it's true people are having others write their intimate missives - so what, they were doing it in the 19th century - what's new? Yes, people seem to spend more time talking into machines than with each other. Wasn't that the complaint about A.G. Bell's new contraption?

In the end SJ/AS is a techno-sentamentalist, decrying the medium because he can't find the message.

Enter Samantha: an engaging, intelligent woman with a quick wit and an avid curiosity about the world.  The only problem: she's an operating system.

Spike Jonze's HER is a beautiful, moving film about humanity and technology, and the tedious intersection of the two that society is rapidly approaching.  The movie features captivating performances; Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal is haunting and human, at times painful to watch (Theodore is a sympathetic character, but not always likable).  As Samantha, Scarlet Johansson conveys a full range of emotions with her voice alone; this is voice acting as it should be.  (Same goes for the other voice actors in the film with their bit parts, especially Kristen Wiig, writer/director Jonze, and Brian Cox in their cameo roles.)  Amy Adams helps round out the supporting cast, in her portrayal and Theodore's neighbor/childhood friend Amy, and Rooney Mara in a bit role as Theodore's ex.  Backing up the performances are a solid script and directing.  I haven't always enjoyed Jonze's films, but I've never doubted that he makes the movies he wants to make; he is a true craftsman.

What truly anchors HER, however, are is its overarching theme of what advances in technology mean to humanity.  Yes, this is a thematic film; however, it's also touching and surprisingly hilarious.  Yes, it will--or should--get you thinking; that's what Jonze is trying to do.  But it's also simply a funny film, with heart and soul and all those other little things that make a movie memorable.

Not exactly, at least not for me. I started watching Her and the movie from the start didn't even catch my interest but I tagged along hoping it would get better. Needless to say it didn't however; I got a very good laugh out of this movie and it wasn't even made for the purpose of being funny.

Set in the future, Theodore the main character is a letter writer who writes letters for other people that they can send to their loved once on their behave [Weird I know, considering they can just use an app or software to write it down instead] but anyways, Theodore is going through a very painful recent separation from his wife Catherine who left him due to shortcomings on his part and is looking to sign those divorce papers. Although his friends are encouraging him to start dating again Theodore is hesitant and spends most of his time alone or at work, then one day he buys an advance Operating System for his digital devices and that's where he embarks on an emotionally filled love affair with the virtual sound of the OS called Samantha.

Yes, in short it's a romance between a man and his computer. Now, I'm fully aware that some people have relationships between them and innate objects clearly that's nothing new or never heard of before. Some even go to the extent of marrying their objects of affection. Personal choices and freedom.

In Her however, the case is a tad different. You see, the operating system is designed to be two dimensional replica of an actual person. It has conversational skills, personality yup it's that advanced to the point where you actually start believing it is a person and not a thing. So, it's no wonder Theodore was so hooked to Samantha especially that he's isolated from the world. It does seem to be a lot more easier to establish a partnership with a computer than an actual person who has ups and downs. The movie started going downhill the moment Theodore decided he was going to not only have cyber sex with his OS but also that he has feelings for her. It was one laughable scene after another. So badly executed that I just couldn't take the movie seriously.

I couldn't be sucked into Theodore's world unfortunately. I didn't buy his romance with Samantha at all and I'm a very open minded person. The movie was just painful to watch and boring at times. There was no suspense, no heart or feelings in this movie.

6144182,4,B00H9HZITU,I liked the movie because it made me think of the technilogical world that we live in and could possibly trend to artificial intelligences that us as human could fall in love with. Makes you think!,1400457600,,197,4.5
6144183,4,B00H9HZITU,"This is the latest twist on a question which has been bothering mankind since before the dawn of the ""computer age"" : will we at some point create something with ""artificial intelligence?""  And if so, what will our relationship with it be like?  Early examples of this theme, I think, may be seen in Mary Shelley's 1818 Frankenstein's Monster novel, or Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis"" from 1927.  In somewhat more recent years, the Terminator movie series,  Blade Runner and Battlestar Galactica come to mind.  None of these are particularly optimistic visions.  Two things seem to bother those who take the question seriously: will they turn on us?  Or even if they don't, will we end up feeling like the inferior being?

In Spike's film the question has a different twist.  As every review notes, the main character Theodore is at a particularly lonely and vulnerable time of life, he and his wife having separated and lawyers are pressuring him to sign the divorce papers.  He sees an advertisement for a new operating system, touted as the world's first actually intelligent system.

Though corporate names aren't used, watching the ad, Apple immediately came to mind.  Here's something hot, or cool, the Next Big Thing.  He bites.  Now comes what I thought was one of the most humorous scenes in the movie, as during set-up he's asked a few simple questions about himself so that the operating system can be customized for better compatibility with him.  Here follows what I imagine to be about the exact opposite of applying to Match.com (not having looked at the latter but having read descriptions and heard their ads).  I can't describe further without spoiling the fun if you haven't watched yet.

Well, he's a lonely guy and wants a system with a female voice, so up comes Scarlett Johanssen's voice as his new operating system, who proceeds to name herself Samantha (scanning a list of thousands of female names in less than a second and, somehow deciding she liked that one best.

These new OS's genuinely appear to have artificial intelligence and what proceeds is a ""guy meets girl"" story, with the complication that ""She"" has no body...and that her thoughts are measured in something like nanoseconds rather than seconds, though of course she has probably an ingrained sensibility to speak at a normal human rate.  One can sense that this relationship probably cannot endure, for more reasons than the lack of a body...

Like most good ""science fiction"" this is a commentary on society TODAY as much as it is any guess about the future.  Do we not have scenes unfolding today of 4 people sitting down to a meal, all 4 of them busy texting unseen others rather than talking to each other?  Do you not frequently pass people on the street busily engaged in conversation with unseen others (usually too-loudy)?  Have we gone from discourse on the level of the Federalist Papers or Gettysburg address, to ""tweets""?

As Ted becomes increasingly dependent on his relationship with non-physical Samantha, he precludes the potential for real relationships with single and attractive females.  Briefly in the middle of the movie, we hear that other people all around are undergoing their own unique, problematic ""relationships"" with their new OS's too...and are treated to a sad scene in which Ted and his wife sit down to sign their divorce papers--neither actually quite sure they really want to do it, but there they are, nicely worked out by their attorneys...

To go further with the plot would be a spoiler, but I'll just say this is a relationship movie more than a science fiction movie.  It moves at a somewhat leisurely pace in spots.  It's primarily a straightforward story arc, interrupted only by brief flashbacks of Ted's memories of all the good parts of his marriage in past years.  There's no nudity, physical violence, or crude language, though sex is definitely discussed from time to time.  This is character and story-driven, and any CG used to depict what the future might look like seems believable, and takes a back seat to the acting.  I saw this first pay-per-view and am eager to get the Blu-Ray and see if there are any interesting ""bonus"" features there.  If you're prepared for a relationship film rather than a traditional sci-fi film then you should enjoy the movie as I did.",1400371200,,4308,4.875

Overall the movie was good but one certainly has to allow themselves to the idea of the weakness of human nature.

6144191,4,B00H9HZITU,"First off, I haven't bought the blu ray yet but will at some point (sale!). I will say however that while the movie isn't perfect, for instance: some of the unnecessary vulgar language (does nothing for the story), the wardrobe! and it's overall length, it hits many of the right notes in it's overall tone. It's beautiful in so many other ways and places in how it conveys, hints at and speaks about relationships (real and virtual). Their uniqueness, strangeness, difficulties, failures and triumphs and our need for all of those things even if they (theoretically) don't come from a tangible, live source. Our need for connection, relation beyond the physical, our need to feel needed, important, loved and even wanted. The beauty of self (not meaning self obsessed or of self importance), as in, the many confusing, disturbing, contradictory thoughts and feelings that at one point or another touch us all to some degree. Loneliness, loss, connection, understanding, need, hunger, longing and all of that. Is there something wrong with ME? Am I not worthy of love, affection, attention or embrace or, is it the context of the world around me that makes me feel less valuable to other people? I think this movie asks that type of question and others. Add to those supremely complex emotions and thoughts the specter of A.I. and whether or not A.I. could ever fill such a human void felt by so many of us with beating hearts. Even with all ""it's"" computing power, ability to learn, listen and even respond naturally (still some time off into the future) the question remains, will A.I. ever fully be able to replace the most complex of systems in the known universe, us. I don't think it could ever happen and I hope it never happens because I want to believe that we are irreplaceable and truly one of a kind in our existence. I found the this movie to be a wonderful experience in spite of its imperfections and wish more movies moved me so. But who cares what I think? Samantha? Sam?

The composition of colors in each shot is beautiful, the music and writing are beautiful. It's a very different love story but it also teaches us about the human condition and how love works. It's the kind of movie that makes you see love in a different light and I enjoyed it very much for that. It's not the most exciting movie on the planet, as evinced by many reviews, but it is such a fantastic movie technically, and as a lover of films and the process of making them, I can appreciate that.

6144199,5,B00H9HZITU,"To be honest, I'm not a fan of romantic movies. Few exceptions aside, I find a lot of them to be lacking the love that they're trying to replicate. Romance doesn't always have to be a cookie-cutter story about a man and a woman falling in love, breaking up momentarily and then reuniting to be true lovers forever like most Hollywood movies tend to portray them as. Relationships can be started from anywhere, even after tragedy when humans are at their most vulnerable and emotional. Romance can spring from anyone, it can cross genders, race and even past physical bonds, such as love between a man and an operating system.

""Her"" is a movie that deals with real romance: life, humor, loss and everything in between. And it does this while being set in the foreground of a world that lacks real love. Ironically, this soulful story between a man and his computer is the most realistic portrayal of romance in recent film-making. Thanks to the excellent script and direction by Spike Jonze, ""Her"" stands out among the countless artificial love stories that have been put out into the world.

Set in Los Angeles in the near future, Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix) is a professional writer that works for a business that makes ""personal"" greeting cards for people that don't have the creativeness or ambition to write a real love letter to their significant other. Even though he is great at his job, attractive and has friends that want to spend time with him, he is a very lonely man. Eventually his personal solitude and desperation leads him to trying out a brand new operating system that is capable of simulating a real person. He boots up his computer for the first time and is greeted by an artificial intelligence named ""Samantha"" (Scarlett Johansson). The two form a bond between each other and eventually a romance begins. But a question is formed: is it real love?

""Her"" attempts to ask us personal questions about what we believe is true love:
Can a person really love someone that technically doesn't exist?
How can romance exist without a physical bond?
Is desperation really love?
Such questions are asked to us viewers and more. This film will bring you in with its humor and excellent story. And it will test you and it might even make you feel uncomfortable, but it will show you a different side of love.

While ""Her"" is an excellent written and directed film, it's cast give the story it's soul. Joaquin Phoenix portrays a sweet, lonely, guilt-ridden man perfectly. Right from the beginning we begin to feel for Theodore and we understand why he has a bond with his artificial girlfriend. Scarlett Johansson swoons us over with her excellent voicework as Samantha. Her performance helps us believe that somewhere inside that computer software a real woman exists. She can be funny, smart and sometimes even intimidating. Together they create a type of chemistry only found in real romance. They laugh, play and talk to each other like couples do. Their relationship is as real as it gets, even though their love is purely artificial in some people's eyes.

One of my first concerns with ""Her"" is if it was going to go over-the-top with its future setting or will it just be an updated look of what we have today. Thankfully the movie portrays the latter. The people of the future still have handheld devices just as small as ours and they communicate to them by using a headset that is placed in their ear. The computers run an operating system similar to the ones we have today but now voice commands are commonly and effortlessly used. Technology eases the lives of the men and women of the future, the ultimate culmination of why we created technology in the first place. Visually, the lighting of Los Angeles really caught my eye. A good majority of the film is set in dusk and it shows. Dark, warm and moody colors fill the shot, giving us a future that is more comforting than it is cold and bleak, a mixture of humanity and machinery. The top of the modern buildings are covered by a thick layer of smog but no one seems to notice or care because the masses are constantly looking down at their phones, a sight that is becoming more common nowadays. Spike Jonze and his crew did well on portraying a future Los Angeles, I wouldn't be surprised if L.A. ended up looking like it a decade from now.

Overall I am impressed with ""Her"". The film is magnificently directed, the writing is authentic and intriguing, and the cast captures the characters with such passion, realism and humor. This movie really opened up my mind to different perspectives on what real love could be and I'm glad there is a few people left in the movie business that know what romance can really be.",1400371200,,4703,4.6807738814993956

6144205,1,B00H9HZITU,"Slow, plodding and with no emotional insight or sensitivity, ""Her"" felt more like an indoctrination film for a transhumanist cult than a movie that anyone should have to pay to see.  I'm a computer geek and I can bend quite far to accept a good sci-fi flick, particularly one about artificial intelligence, but this movie was a real stinker.

Another reviewer labeled ""Her"" as misanthropic; it certainly is!  The near-future world depicted in the movie is populated by electronically connected, emotionally stunted people who are shallow, unhappy and empty.  Taken more as a cynical, dark, horror film where the main character's crowning achievement is the publication of his email, ""Her"" works much better by interpreting the ambiguous ending for the two human protagonists as considering suicide from the rooftop while scanning a city where countless others are doing the same thing at the same time.  Under this interpretation, Samantha, the AI that Phoenix falls for, is more of a weapon of mass emotional destruction than a true love interest.  More disconcerting is that it is almost certainly possible to implement an AI today that would simulate behavior effectively enough to satisfy many lonely souls, an AI ultimately under the control of others with perhaps nefarious intentions to lead the lemmings to sinister goals.

Joaquin Phoenix, star of ""Walk the Line,"" played a sniveling, whinny, self-absorbed anti-Johnny Cash character in this unnecessarily vulgar monstrosity.  The movie's sole redeeming quality was its pretty cinematography.  I would almost rather have a second root canal than watch ""Her"" again.",1400284800,8,1623,5.333333333333333

He is apparently in great demand and makes great money leaving one to think that nearly the whole world has abandoned real for fake.  His home life is fake, his dating life is fake and the great love of his life, a breathy computer generated lover is the biggest fake of all.  He is a fake, his neighbors are fakes - presumably the realization of which leads them to take their lives (although we are left to imagine their demise).

What starts off as a better way to send and receive e-mails soon becomes something much much more and Theodore once again finds love and happiness. I have to begin by saying that I really enjoyed this movie. It was very original and entertaining. I thought Matthew McConaughey was the most deserving of the Best Actor Oscar...until I watched this. Joaquin Phoenix was amazing in this and he basically did it all by himself with only an off screen voice as his supporting cast. All that said the movie also really makes you think about the subject matter and how far off we really are to this technology. I do also have to say that the movie may be a little too good at foreshadowing in the way that human interaction due to the new OS's becomes even worse then it is now. Scenes of people walking by one another without acknowledging another human because they are talking to their OS isn't really that far off from what is happening now.

6144250,2,B00H9HZITU,"Whatever else this movie is about, it certainly is not about AI.  Now I know there are many (perhaps most) who love this movie for its artistic and expressional value.  For its seemingly clever use of computers as metaphors for (fill in the blank) and the heartwarming performances of Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johansson (sigh)--but date-night is over kids.

This movie reminds me (at least in part) by movies like Lars and the Real Girl.  Except in this case we have some kind of AI-OS taking the place of the sex doll.  If you recall Lars and the Real Girl (spoiler alert) Ryan Gosling's character turns the doll into a ""real"" person, complete with feelings and expects others to treat the doll as such.

This film made no effort to explain the computer science behind how Samantha works or even what kind of technology makes Her possible.  While watching the film I saw no explanation of just how far in the future this takes place or in what social/political context Theodore Twombly lives in.  Forced to guess, it would seem that the film takes place about 18 to 20 years from now.  However, the Wikipedia entry claims the film is set in 2025.  Even given the astounding rate of computer evolution it would seem very unlikely, in eleven years time, to have system like Samantha running on what appears to be the equivalent of an iMac.  Even a half-assed attempt at good science fiction tries to account for such things.  This is why Doc Brown invented the flux capacitor or why the Enterprise warp engines run on an antimatter/matter reaction.  There has to be some kind of bridge built from the future world to the present and it needs to have some whiff of scientific plausibility to it.

It seems that in 2025 people are using still using blue-tooth ear pieces but curiously smaller smart-phones.  I was happy to see an absence (largely) of these ""computer air screens"" that I see in movies all the time these days (e.g. Iron Man) but the future vision of technology was decidedly paltry.  I'm sure there is much better stuff on Google's cocktail napkins.  There is also this issue of Samantha being an OS.  From a computational point of view it would seem that a system like Samantha would use massive amounts of memory and processor power.  This is generally not a good thing for a operating system to do to its host computer.  This leads to system failures and crashes.  Which is why I can only conclude Samantha must have been written by Microsoft  ;-)  All kidding aside it's more plausible for Samantha to be a dedicated system, something the size of a small refrigerator.  Something where all of her circuits and programming are separate from all of the PC's and smart-phones she interacts with.  It seems very unlikely to have Samantha running as a kind of ""app"" on ones personal computer.

I'm sure at least since Apple's Siri came out someone has just been chomping at the bit to do a movie featuring sex and AI, but all of the pan-sexual scenes seemed like excuses to hear Scarlett Johansson moan, and were very unnecessary.

The only thing saving this movie (or at least awarding it two stars) is the reference to Alan Watts.  This is the first feature film (I think) that has even mentioned his name.  However to truly honor Watts the film should have embraced more Zen-like themes, such as non-permanence or cosmic unity.

6144277,5,B00H9HZITU,"I'm not about to give you a review that tells what the movie is about because you can read on Amazon a plot line synopsis and many of the other reviews tell what the movie is about. Instead, I'm going to tell you in my review what the movie does for me and this is why I like the movie.

""Her"" is a film that like the petals on a rose, it has many layers:

1. A touchy-feely film that takes a look at one's inner most feelings. I do not mean any disrespect, but this is a film that most men would not like for that reason. If one is into the Myers-Briggs Personality Indicator philosophy, one would say that the film's personality is an INFP. Some might say a too analytical investigation of emotions, over thought and over felt. Yet, it's the deep raw inner feelings that lay our souls bare, the exposed nerve of our inner core that I love about this film.

2. One might say this is a commentary on how our society is becoming far too dependent on technology. Such dependence leaving us emotionally crippled in a sterile environment surrounded by our own selves and lacking the ability to interact with others. The irony of Theodore's job as a professional letter writer, who writes deep heartfelt emotional letters for people is not lost on the viewer. Will we become a society that is so far removed from our feelings, so busy with our schedules, that we are incapable of writing our own letters, expressing our own emotions to our loved ones?

3. This film explores the age old question, ""What makes us human?"" Are we more than just our physical bodies? If we were to take our thoughts, our emotions, and our conscious awareness and place it into a computer, would then the computer be ""human""? The science of ""neural networks"" is becoming more and more of a reality as scientists and computer experts work together to achieve this type of ""immortality"". Which begs the question, ""If a deceased person's consciousness is transplanted into a computer or robot, does that make it a 'human' with rights?"" Just what is 'human'?

4. Is a virtual relationship ""real""? As more and more people get into computer dating and cybersex, we find ourselves asking this question. Virtual reality games are springing up all over the Internet. One that comes to mind is called, ""Second Life"". I personally know of people who have had virtual relationships in Second Life using avatars and either using the voice capabilities in Second Life to talk to each other, or they call each other on Skype while they watch their computer screen as their avatars ""make love"", a type of virtual reality cybersex-relationship that is becoming more and more common place. These people in Second Life, most, who have never met each other in person, claim their relationship is real and they are very much in love. But, when the computer is turned off, the person isn't there. Does our love just turn off and on with the flick of a switch? Can a virtual love, without the physical touch that seems to be so very much a part of a relationship, be satisfying enough? Is it really a relationship or is it merely a modern version of phone sex? Is it love? I've heard of true stories where people in a bygone era, would fall in love through letters. My own maternal grandparents did just that. So is it such a stretch of the imagination that we can fall in love virtually?

5. Can we love more than one person at the same time? Those who are in open marriages or open relationships claim that people are capable of having love, true romantic love, for more than one person at the same time. We see in the film how devastated Theodore becomes when he realizes he's ""just one of many"". We have all known or heard of people who have found out their loved one was cheating on them by finding a text message or an email. We all want to feel unique and special, but in an age when our technology makes it so very easy to have more than one relationship at the same time, we begin to question our heart's ability to withstand technological polygamy.

6. ""Her"" cuts to the quick, the bottom line being as human, as people, all of us basically want to be accepted for who we are, not judged and to be loved. Such basic human needs, that no matter how far removed our society becomes from a simpler, less technological age, we still are creatures that all need and want acceptance and love.

7. Is love just a biological chemical response or is it a deeper, transcendental, spiritual experience that goes beyond space and time? Love is more than just the scent of pheromones and the animal instinct to procreate. When we love, truly love, even after that person is gone from our life, our love still lives on. With each person who touches us deeply, they become a part of our soul. This film does not merely question love's transcendent nature, but stabs you in the heart with it as we watch the heart wrenching roller-coaster of emotions that Theodore experiences and as a result inevitably grows from it.

8. What constitutes being a ""god""? If we make a computer or robot that is capable of being self-aware, in essence it is a ""sentient being"", then does that make us ""god"" as its creator? Will we go from being ""God's creation"" to becoming gods ourselves with the development of neural networks that can think, reason and feel emotions?

9. And lastly, one can simply view this film as nothing more than just a very strange chick flick about relationships and breakups. But I doubt that the type of people this film appeals to would take such a narrow view of this work of art. And yes, in my opinion, this film is a work of art on many levels, between its cinematography, its music score and its ability to tell an entertaining and deeply moving story. By far, this is one of Joaquin Phoenix's best, showcasing his acting as a truly talented performer.

""Her"" is now on my top 10 list as one of my favorite films. However ladies, if you have a husband or boyfriend who's idea of a great film is Rambo First Blood, then you may have a difficult time selling him on the idea of going to see such a sensitive, emotional movie. I think this would be a great film as a ""girls' night"" movie. Ladies, wear your sweats, pop some popcorn, get out the chocolate bars and the tissues, gather up your BFFs and sink into the sofa, relax and watch this film together. You'll be glad you did.

UPDATE May 1, 2014 - Second viewing of the film:  OK, so I watched the movie a second time after reading all the other reviews here at Amazon. With the negative review points in my head as I watched the film for a second time, yes, the movie does have some rather creepy scenes. And now, come to think of it, this time around I kept reminding myself that as human as she sounds, Samantha is just a computer program so falling in love with her is well, really ridiculous. This time around I tried to place myself in Theodore's position and I realized that no matter how enduring and how much I seemed to bond with Samantha, given the situations Theodore was in, I still wouldn't have fallen in love because in the back of my mind, Samantha is just a very intuitive and clever computer program. I doubt I would have gone as far as Theodore did in sharing my personal emotions with Samantha. I would have kept the relationship on a purely professional level, that of a software owner and his software that provides itself as an electronic tool and organizer, similar to a boss and his administrative assistant. Other reviewers say that Theodore turning down Olivia Wilde and Portia Doubleday is ridiculous, but I don't think so. Olivia gets into the whole, ""I want a serious relationship"" after only meeting Theodore for the first time over drinks. To me, that's a huge turn off and pretty freaking scary. I think most people would run for the hills. Portia Doubleday, although very attractive, she's far younger than Theodore and a total stranger. For some men, this wouldn't be an issue. But perhaps Theodore is like my husband who has said that dating a girl much younger would seem like dating your daughter. Also my husband is an old fashioned kind of guy that needs to know a woman well and have an established relationship long before hopping in bed with her. Some men are like that and Theodore seems like that type of guy. So all those reviewers that criticize the movie script for having Theodore rejecting these women, claiming that a ""normal"" man would never turn these women down for sex, don't really view these scenes from the prospective of Theodore's nerdy nice guy personality and instead they are viewing these scenes and seeing them as if they themselves were offered sex with these women. Anywho...I still like the movie, ""Her"" and I still think it's as wonderful as I said in my previous review above, but I now am viewing it from a different angle and wanted to express my thoughts on this. I still recommend this movie. It definitely is a must see for those who are deep thinkers with strong emotions. Those looking for macho testosterone induced action films with car chases and lots of violence, best pass this movie up.",1398816000,4,9083,4.527726995734309

6144283,5,B00H9HZITU,"Her was the best film of 2013. It won best original screenplay because the story it told was told extremely well. While other reviews say that Her was a critique of our relationship to technology, I think they're putting too much emotion into their review. What Her did was ask questions about the evolving nature of technology and intimacy without an agenda or without answering those questions. It was an exploration of intimacy in the 21st century. It didn't say that we were headed in the wrong direction or the right direction, it just asked where we were. The acting (voice acting included) was very good, the soundtrack spectacular for the energy and scope of the film, and the movie was ambiguous about several plot events (the director didn't answer the questions he brought up).

The answers are for you to come up with, and the film begs you to discuss them with your friends after the film is over. All in all, a great story about the technological turning point in human intimacy.",1397260800,6,993,4.706896551724138
6144284,5,B00H9HZITU,"On the surface, Her is a love story. Under the surface, it's also a love story, but it's not just a love story. Not a love story in the way that we think of love stories. There's no boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-gets-girl-back in this. It's more of an exploration about relationships than anything else, but it does it in a fascinating and unique way.

Theodore Twombly, played by Joaquin Phoenix, is a letter writer. That's his job. He writes letters for people to other people for a company called (something like) Hand-written Letters. This letter writing that he does is, in many ways, a metaphor for the entire movie as the letters are personal letters, sometimes love letters, that he's hired to write (and, in some cases, has been writing for the same people for years and years and knows them extremely well), but he dictates the letters to his computer and they are printed out to look as if they are written by hand.

It's unclear within the context of the movie whether the people receiving the letters know they are written by a third party, but I have a hard time believing that they wouldn't know this since the whole letter writing thing is a ""thing."" Basically, Theodore facilitates other people's relationships by filling these letters with, what I'll call, manufactured emotions, but he can't maintain his own relationships, which is something we find out at the very beginning of the movie, so no spoiler there. He's in the middle of a divorce with his wife and is distant from his friends.

Now, there will be spoiler issues in the rest of this.

With all of that in mind, it is no surprise that Theodore easily finds himself slipping into a relationship with his new Operating System, the first OS with artificial intelligence. As his wife accuses him later, he can't do relationships with people that are right there in front of him. It's probably why he's so good at the letter writing. And he is good at the letter writing, one of the best, at least. It's no surprise that he finds himself attracted to this physically distant intelligence.

But it does open the door to exploring the idea of ""what is a relationship?"" What is required for a relationship to be legitimate? Is his love real? Is Samantha's (the OS)? Does she need a body in order to manifest the relationship? And it's not just him, because we get pieces of information in the movie that other people in society are dealing with the same struggles. Or the opposite struggles, as we learn that at least one user has a real hate relationship with his OS.

The movie doesn't really try to answer these questions, which is good. It just shows us that the questions are there and should be considered. Although there are a few concrete answers, one of which is that, at least sometimes, we do need the physical presence of another person. Especially in dealing with loss.

Joaquin Phoenix was great as Theodore. It's a very subdued performance, because Theodore is a very subdued individual. I think performances like this get overlooked because they're not outrageous, but Phoenix is much more believable in his role than, say, DiCaprio as Belfort, which is not to take away from DiCaprio's performance, but I think it's easy to look at a movie like The Wolf of Wall Street and think, ""Wow, he was amazing"" but forget about roles like Theodore Twombly which rely on conveying emotion rather than exaggerated action. Phoenix was superb at conveying the emotion of Twombly.

Even more amazing, though, was Scarlett Johansson. Everything she did was conveyed through voice only, and it was incredible. I don't think I've really given her a lot of credit in the past for her acting ability, which is not to say that I didn't think she was good; I just didn't think she was, well, better. It's too easy with her to think, ""Oh, she got this part because of her looks,"" and not really credit her for the actual acting. But she's not physically in this movie, and what she did with her voice shows that she is better. She didn't even have the help of animators to convey her emotion; she just had to bring it audibly, and she did. It is actually upsetting to me that she has been dismissed from the Oscar nominations because she wasn't physically in the movie. That's just wrong.

Her is a great movie. It's a thoughtful movie. There are no explosions or car chases or alien invasions. It's sci-fi that could happen. And, yes, it was interesting... but in a good way.",1397174400,14,4450,4.665816326530612

What Jonze has done is a sort of miraculous mating of Frank Capra and Franz Kafka sans cynicism.

Far from the stupid film it may sound like, it manages to be a detailed exploration of the human animal going through all the stages of a romantic relationship as well as a social critique of how much electronics have taken over our lives.

It was about finding your best friend and being so happy, yet never focusing on what was really wrong with the relationship. ""I think I hid myself from her. Left her alone in the relationship"".

6144295,5,B00H9HZITU,"If I didn't know any better, Id swear that every time Spike Jonze releases a movie, hes targeting me as his core audience type.  When Being John Malkovich came out, I was studying film at the University of Michigan and attended a free campus screening of the film; Ann Arbor film majors ate that film up!  When Adaptation came out, I had just begun struggling to write my first and still as of yet unfinished novel.  Where the Wild Things Are was one of my favorite childrens books growing up.  Now with Her, he takes aim at my self-proclaimed geekdom with a film about a man who literally falls in love with his technology.  The only problem is that while it seems like every one of those films should have been suited just for me, for one reason or another, I only really liked Adaptation.  Fortunately, it seems like Jonze and I are back in alignment as Her is one of the most imaginative love stories since Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.

Her stars Joaquin Phoenix as the odd and appropriately named Theodore Twombly, a name that practically invokes the characters of Dr. Seuss.  This very well could be Jonzes intention, as Her succeeds more as a fantasy childrens tale for adults than Where the Wild Things Are ever did.  Set in the very near future, Twombly works for the web company, beautifulhandwrittenletters.com where he is paid to weave the events of real couples lives into artistically poetic love letters that are then sent unbeknownst to their recipients.

The irony is palpable as Twomblys personal life is still reeling from his recent divorce, even to the point of sabotaging a sure thing with a prospective lover, played by Olivia Wilde.  Instead, Twombly spends his evenings playing holographic video games and remembering what his life was like when he was happily married.  Enter Samantha ( voiced by Scarlet Johansson), the whimsically playful voice of his new computer operating system, designed to exist as a consciousness that is so intuitive that it understands and knows you on a virtually human level.  It is with Samantha that Twombly is able to open up and real feelings of passion, love, and connection soon follow.

Jonze has written and directed a fine hypothetical commentary on love in a modern world.  Never has the question, Can romantic love exist in a vacuum? been so cinematically explored.  What should feel absurd and ridiculous is made to feel thoughtful and reluctantly authentic thanks to pitch perfect performances from Phoenix and Johansson.  In one scene where Samantha attempts to physicalize their relationship in a very creative but creepy way, the film achieves true greatness in the style of warped kind of Frankenstein story.

Jonze truly has created a monster here, and it is one that is surprisingly refreshing, creative, and tonally apprehensive.  There is no doubt that if Apple announced tomorrow that it is releasing the OS1, thousands of people would be blindly grinning through the streets as they share their deepest thoughts and secrets with their virtual lovers.  Stories already exist of people who abandon their lives to live fake lives in virtual worlds like World of Warcraft or Second Life.  Jonze puts a magnifying glass on this idea and shows us how close we are to shutting ourselves into this type of cocoon-like existence.

Keeping this film from completely falling down the rabbit hole is Amy Adams as Twomblys friend and neighbor, Amy, another symbolic name  because its REAL!  Adams continues her quest to be the female Kevin Bacon (more on that in my American Hustle review), but she also grounds this film and prevents it from getting too far in the disbelief column.  Her is a cautionary fairy tale that is effortlessly engaging and easily Jonzes best film yet.  A-

6144298,3,B00H9HZITU,"""Guess what the ""future"" (in a relatively nearer sense) may hold for your love life? Know whether sticking out with the one you physically love or is better off or not than the one you become attached to via technology? Could the film be a metaphor for online dating, phone sex, or a propaganda piece for those two things?

 Her, Spike Jonze's experimental and Charlie Brooker's Black Mirror-inspired romance, is a quiet, mild-mannered, and potentially thought-provoking look into how man and technology can correspond and have a relationship together in the face of adversity and loneliness.

 It examines the look of a man named Theodore (played by a confident, not so smug Joaquin Phoenix), a vocal (seems keyboards are a thing of the past in the future) letter-writer, who evokes an eccentric hipster chic about him as he settles through a divorce with his wife only to find escapism and compatibility one moment and thereafter with an operating system (OS) named Samantha voiced by every Joe or Bob's favourite, Scarlett Johansson.

 Her, as a whole, manages to be a neat and safe ride but it does have its lack of thrills when the film boils down more to a conventional romantic plotline than a sort-of satirical take on ""phone love"" and ""technological obsession"" (this is notable during the gaming sequences and one phone sex scene which has, undoubtedly, an offensive and disgusting joke involving three sexually deviant acts not appropriate to said on here) but that does not mean it is not realistic enough. The emotions and catharsis feels believable and far beyond the hokey cues one may find in a generic romance.

 I liked what Jonze (who is known to be a ""music video"" director) did with the design and location by creating an environment not so futuristic and believable (even if Shanghai is mixed along with Los Angeles in several shots which is peculiar and non-projectioned screens with finger-oriented gaming and voice-automated smartphones are still in development) and what he did with the whole theme of the film by making it stand out from a wave of Oscar bait and romantic films that are usually filled with gushy tears and recycled plotlines found on Lifetime.

 Romance is a tricky game of sorts as I usually abstain from getting into any kind of affair, kiss, or sexual encounter of sorts and this film's technology-oriented premise and peculiar characters (Phoenix and Johansson that is) stood out for me also knowing that I have seen things which deals with similar themes like Black Mirror, the Kate Bush music video Deeper Understanding, and some episodes of Dexter's Laboratory. The others here including Amy Adams and Rooney Mara provide well-rounded performances as the encounters Theodore explores especially during the scenes where Adams' character who is a filmmaker and video game designer tries to showcase her documentary about sleep and a quirky game which involves a mother trying to be ""perfect."" There are some believably funny scenes and none of it feels forced or too eccentric to where I may find the whole hipster chic of it (which Jonze's fanbase mostly consists of) annoying and pretentious too much.

 The Black Mirror connection is not explicit but a possible inspiration for the script and execution of the film as Black Mirror utilises technology within its everyday look at lifestyles or near-by futures or dystopias to show how over-the-top matters of life could get. The differences here is that Black Mirror allowed to explore several subjects as a TV series and its technology-gone-mad angle is a lot more darker and bleaker than Her.

 If more and more people were more like Theodore, I think the problem of overpopulation, divorce rates, infidelity, domestic violence, negligence towards children and women, and other relative issues maybe diminished while the focus of these issues may pertain but on a less crucial and problematic level like now. My futuristic observations maybe controversial and wrong but I wish Jonze would deliver some of these questions more into the film but the film as a whole was not terrible but felt a bit stretched and exhaustive more than I could ask for but nonetheless, the realistic parameters and treatment of love, the idiosyncrasy, and occasional humour stood out and it was altogether a respectable but not phenomenal film like how most of the critics put it out.

 Her is not science-fiction (in the same sense as something like THX 1138 which some of the set designs might be based off for this film, Bicentennial Man, or Close Encounters of the Third Kind) but its aims are a bit futuristic at the moment but may come across some point in time around in the 2020s?""",1393632000,5,4669,4.959026888604353
6144299,4,B00H9HZITU,"Ah, to find true love; movies overflow with this theme. Writer/Director Spike Jonze (Adaptation, Being John Malkovich) has really excelled in a mainstream film with a unique plotline.  In Her, he paints the affecting tale of finding love in a most unusual place, and the result is a remarkable love story with two knockout performances.

In the not too distant future, operating systems (OS) have the ability to mimic human thought and interaction, perhaps even feelings.  One lonely individual, Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix), decides to try the service after the painful breakup of his marriage (as seen through a series of flashbacks).  His OS is named Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson), and she learns quickly and develops into what sounds like a fully intuitive, intelligent, and perhaps self aware program capable of sensitivity and emotion. At first bringing structure and order to his life, Samantha proves to be more than artificial intelligence, but rather a sentient one.  Think of a female version of HAL9000 in 2001: A Space Odyssey.  After a series of sex chat lines and a disastrous blind date, Theo, who desperately wants a female companion, realizes that Samantha is too good to be true.  He shares his world with her through his smart phone, and she accompanies him on his travels whether it be to a fair or for a walk.  The two of them experience a relationship that transcends the lack of physical contact.  How this unlikely pair will end up is the mystery of love.

Ostensibly a love story, this is really a science fiction film amid a deeply personal setting.  This well written screenplay (by Jonze) works as a touching drama and explores the nature of human interaction and the meaning of love.  It also touches on how deeply our society is plugged into the cyber world of reality.  It would be interesting to see how Terry Gilliam (Brazil) would have developed this theme.

Phoenix (Walk the Line, The Master) really embodies his loneliness convincingly.  When his wife leaves him, he has to learn about letting go of someone and being open to new opportunities.  You feel for him and his longings.  Ironically his job involves ghost writing letters for other people, and some of the prose is romantic or emotional.

Johansson (The Avengers, Match Point) voices Samantha as a fully, living being with just the right mix of nuance and inflection.  It is a bravura performance.  Her Samantha is a bright pupil who becomes hungry for knowledge and experiencing human emotions; she has her needs and wants.  When Theo and Samantha go out for a picnic with a coworker and his girlfriend, it becomes an unusual quartet unlike any double date ever.  Even more, Samanthas desire to integrate with humans sets up a fascinating encounter via a surrogate.  She in a sense is a reflection of the best and potentially the worst of human response and behavior.  Is she capable of being jealous or disloyal?  Could she even evolve into something else?  These are some fascinating questions that come to mind.  In a sense she becomes a metaphor for human existence.

Amy Adams (American Hustle) lends strong support as Theos friend who also becomes involved with her own OS companion.  Rooney Mara (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) is effective in her brief scenes as Theos wife, Catherine.

Stark cinematography and a moody musical score combined with good use of modern architecture (partly filmed in Shanghai) lend to a detached environment.  The feeling of isolation and solitude permeate the sterile settings.

It would have been nice to learn more about Theos world and if he had any other family.  What was his background growing up and what are the implications of the program on society in general?  What we get is a spare sketch of one mans world.

The story is ultimately about experiencing a special, human feeling and the search for ones soul mate.  Its also about the joys and happiness in life that are but fleeting moments in time.",1393632000,3,3967,4.88622754491018

6144302,5,B00H9HZITU,"HER is an intense piece of work, with a fabulous central performance by Joaquin Phoenix as Theodore, a lonely writer who spends all day at the computer writing letters on other people's behalf. This helps deflect attention away from the meaninglessness of his own life, living alone in a sparse apartment in a Los Angeles tower block, and unable to come to terms with his impending divorce from his wife Catherine (Rooney Mara). He invests in an Operating System as a way of counteracting loneliness, and develops a passionate relationship with Samantha, the voice of that system (voiced by Scarlett Johansson). This ingenious situation provides the pretext for director Spike Jonze to embark on a searching analysis of what being ""human"" represents, and whether it can be separated from the ""virtual"" life of the computer, personal listening device, smartphone or operating system. Hoyte van Hortema's stunning photography of the Los Angeles landscape conjures up a forbidding world of gleaming yet soulless skyscrapers that dwarf the human beings on the sidewalks. The interior sets are colorful, stylish yet soulless, especially Theodore's apartment and workspace. Both the interiors and exteriors conjure up a world devoid of human contact, where people seldom if ever disclose their feelings face to face; and when they do, they inevitably misunderstand one another. Hence their only refuge is to talk to their operating systems, either on a personal or desktop device. There is one remarkable shot in the film, as Theodore sits on the steps outside a subway station, where Jonze's camera pans the passengers coming out of the subway, and all of them are engaged in conversations with their devices. No one, it seems, has sufficient courage to talk face-to-face. Theodore enjoys some moments of intense pleasure talking to Samantha, yet in the end he has to consider some serious ontological questions. HER is a remarkable film, whose serious subject-matter, combined with stunning designs and cinematography, make it a worthy candidate for an Oscar.",1393459200,14,2055,5.2682926829268295
6144303,3,B00H9HZITU,"The ""her"" of this heterosexual love tale is a futuristic computer operating system that communicates verbally like a real, albeit invisible, woman. Her voice is raspy and slightly annoying; imagine Scarlett Johansson without the looks; but her personality is decidedly charming. That a man, especially a lonely divorcee named Theodore, could find himself romantically intrigued by her is the believable part. That he'd turn down immediate sex from two real women, two real attractive women, for the sake of his relationship with her stretches the believability factor quite thin. She doesn't even have a pussy. He has to imagine one while listening to her groan as he masturbates.

A relationship is supposed to be about more than the physical stuff, of course. I guess that's the point. But the physical stuff is important, as even the computer girl, named Samantha, acknowledges. She's mostly jokey and easy-going but seems to suffer from the Pinocchio complex of wanting desperately to experience life as a real (physical) human-being. But human-beings fall out of love, a fact Theodore knows all too well. Whether or not that also goes for operating systems programmed to learn and evolve is anyone's guess. It's a chance Theodore is willing to take. If that seems silly, it is. Her is a silly concept movie that only occasionally arouses real emotion.

6144306,5,B00H9HZITU,"Spike Jonze's ""Her"" is a wonderfully inventive articulation of the human longing and need for intimacy. Set in a Los Angeles several years in the future, ""Her"" is the story of a melancholy everyman, Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix), who makes his living writing personal letters for others, and whose divorce from his wife Catherine (Rooney Mara) is pending. He lives in the upper floors of an airy high-rise condo overlooking a vast vertical sprawl. He spends time with a neighbor and longtime friend, Amy (Amy Adams). A new operating system is introduced that promises to meet every one of its user's needs. Theodore purchases this new OS for his computer and chooses the female voice, which is named Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson). Lonely after his separation in a networked, yet isolated world, Theodore and Samantha fall in love.

I will begin with the setting of time and place because these are vital in establishing verisimilitude. ""Her"" characterizes future Los Angeles as a streamlined, clean city with efficient rail transportation. The depiction of personal computing is both advanced and plausible. People complete recognizable computing tasks--check email, date online--via a small earpiece, or a small bifold iPhone-like device that fits in a shirt pocket. While there are flourishes of future life--a profane child in an interactive video game, men fashioning wool high-waisted pants and pastel oxford shirts, a humorous take on online dating--Jonze's direction emphasizes realism, evident in a straightforward shooting style, minimal cuts, and long takes. Soft, natural light highlights large, mostly empty rooms that the camera shoots from afar, emphasizing solitude.

The movie's central conflict is Theodore's loneliness, and his desire to re-connect after separating from Catherine. He is one of several writers at his job busily writing personal letters. Despite the advanced technology and network connectivity that Her depicts, people are physically isolated, as illustrated by subway scenes in which passengers hurry to their destination while communicating with their devices, yet rarely making eye contact or engaging others. Moreover, Theodore's employer profits from people who contract their interpersonal communication.

""Her"" works because Theodore and Samantha's relationship is depicted as man's urge for intimacy. ""Her"" treats their relationship empathetically, and not as unseemly. Theodore's affection for Samantha is genuine, but his feelings are not without conflict and doubt. The question lingers about whether this relationship is a proxy for a flesh-and-blood relationship, or a legitimate romance. Still, the movie finds any emotional connection Theodore achieves as a positive. See how other characters--Amy; Theodore's co-worker and his girlfriend--react when Theodore confesses that his new girlfriend is an OS. The movie would not work if Samantha were not a fully drawn character, or if she was not invested in the relationship. Johansson gives Samantha humanity, emotion, and empathy, using just her voice. Phoenix's earnestness is a similar asset, providing the audience an entry point for this digital romance.

As he did in ""Being John Malkovich,"" Jonze excels at creating a realistic, universal story in an imagined world. ""Her"" is an examination of that most basic of human desires, to connect with another person, to love. It does not root for Theodore to recognize the folly of intimacy with a computer, nor to dump Samantha and engage again with a flesh-and-blood person. Rather, ""Her"" is about the transcendence of intimacy in a society that is often a lonely place. At the theater where I first viewed ""Her,"" when the credits rolled the gentle glow from mobile phones being turned on was like a blue sunrise, a reminder that perhaps the society portrayed in ""Her"" is not that far into the future.",1392595200,118,3859,5.448160535117057

Not only the operating system (who calls itself or herself Samantha) is super smart, ""she"" is also more empathetic than any other human being. The conversation that Theodore has with Samantha is superior to that he has to any other humans. Eventually, Theodore hits it so well with Samantha, that they start a ""relationship"" (by the way, does Samantha have real feelings or is ""she"" faking them? The movie never really tells though by the end of the film it does seem the latter). The movie has a lot of things to recommend for it (its design, some of the performances, though not in my opinion that of Joaquin Phoenix). However, I have to say that I found the film wanting. Director Spike Jonze became famous more than a decade ago with a couple of movies (""Adaptation"" and ""Being John Malkovich"") that were widely praised by critics but which I found boring and pretentious. This film is certainly a step up from those movies, but is not enough for me. Perhaps the movie has something to say about loneliness in our modern, technological age, but what the movie says doesn't look very profound (in fact, the movie works better if you think about it as a parody of romantic comedies) and is cut down by the inane immaturity of most of its characters, including Samantha.",1392076800,5,1693,4.742372881355932

So we have Joaquin Phoenix and Spike Jonze here really hitting us with very unique material about relationships in the high tech age.  We aren't quite up to where the movie is but we are undoubtedly closing in on it.  This is where the computer and internet become our people and relationships.

Joaquin Phoenix has always been a good actor. Over the last decade he has matured into a formidable one.  He does whatever is necessary for the role and he just nails this guy.  Even the physical look they developed for him for the film is letter perfect and nothing like the way he really looks.  The amazing thing is all that you can figure out that they changed is the mustache but my god, he's TOTALLY different looking.  Most actors would need plastic surgery to achieve this.  He just needs attitude!

None of us even knew who Joaquin was when his older brother River was such a rising star in film. Joaquin was there the night his brother died of a drug overdose and you can't help but wonder how much that has affected the path that he took instead on finding his own path in Hollywood. It may well have centered him and stabilized him because here truly is an actor who in performance after performance knows exactly who he is, who his character is and what he wants to accomplish.

He has some major talents surrounding him, especially Spike Jonze, the director. The female talent is all high on the A list from Amy Adams to Scarlett Johannsen and more.  But it is Phoenix who carries the whole movie.

6144313,5,B00H9HZITU,"Spike Jonze is a well-rounded individual thats been involved in several different aspects of entertainment.  If youve heard his name before, its most likely associated with one of the many music videos hes directed, which includes Weezers Buddy Holly, Beastie Boys Sabotage, and Fatboy Slims Praise You.  And, if you're familiar with MTVs Jackass, then youll recognize his name as one of the co-creators and frequent guests.  But, if modern alternative rock or outrageous stunts isn't your cup of team, you may have seen one of Jonzes previous film endeavors, directing Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, or Where the Wild Things Are.  Now, Jonze might just have another memorable film on his hands with the new romance drama, Her.

Joaquin Phoenix stars as Theodore Twombly, a lonely man with a pending divorce looming large over his life.  According to his close friend, Amy (Amy Adams), he hasn't been the same person since the split with his wife, spending most of his time being more melancholy than social.  Ironically, his job is as a writer that produces personal love letters for those that have difficulty expressing their feelings.  Although he himself is torn and disassociated, he is still recognized by his co-workers as a brilliant emotional writer.

The world Theodore lives in is clearly in the future, but a date is never determined.  However, much like society today, the center of most everyones lives is their digital connection to the rest of the world.  Oddly enough, hes a writer but speaks the words to a computer.  He spends his evenings on elaborate (and vulgar) video games, and even dabbles in late night chat rooms from time to time.

Feeling lost and out of touch without his wife, Theodore turns to the newly introduced and first ever artificially intelligent operating system (with a conscious), called OS1.  This system is strictly for the individual and evolves based on encounters, actions, and conversations.  Deciding to try it out, Theodore is quickly enthralled with his OS, opting it to use a female voice  which of her own free will names herself Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson).  The pair progressively gets to know one another and eventually become intimate to the extent that they start dating  even regardless of the fact that Samantha lacks a body.

As you might expect, the trials and tribulations of dating someone that really doesnt exist takes a prominent role in the latter half of the film.  Theodore must also face his ex-wife, Catherine (Rooney Mara) and her judgment, all while struggling with whether or not to sign his divorce papers and officially ending their partnership.  The past looms large over Theodore and he continuously ponders the idea of spending his future with a constantly evolving machine.  Some people are okay with the idea, but he must first face down his own inner turmoil about what he wants for himself.

It really doesnt take much for the synopsis of this film to make it out to be a rather ridiculous idea.  However, that couldn't be any further from the truth, thus making Her one of the freshest plots in recent memory.  Spike Jonze deserves more than half of the credit since he alone wrote the film, produced the film, and directed the film.  Once again, if you're at all familiar with Jonze, then youll also probably notice that hes the one voicing the alien child in the video game that Theodore likes to play.  Jonze, whos naturally funny anyway, happens to be a part of the most humorous moments that this film has to offer.

Without a doubt, Jonze has struck gold with this film, but he couldn't have done it without the marvelous casting of lead actor, Joaquin Phoenix.  Honestly, Phoenixs career hasn't been the same since that whole ridiculous rapping angle where he tried to convince people he retired and went a bit crazy.  In any event, his last role in The Master, along with his role in Her, has reestablished his credibility as one of the better actors in Hollywood.  He puts an unmitigated amount of emotion into this role and portrays a very confused, at times disassociated character.  Even though he puts on quite the impressive performance, hes incredibly outshined by a mysterious (and easily identifiable) female voice  not to mention the actual story itself.

As an actress (playing something as simple as a computer) that never appears on film, Scarlett Johansson couldn't have been better as the OS, Samantha.  Believe it or not, the emotional journey isn't any less moving without her there physically  and it almost has the feeling of a somewhat long-distance relationship.  The amount of acceptance that her character is given by Theodores friends is convincing enough to establish this film as something that could be very possible in the not so distant future.  At the same time, its rather disturbing just how much (and quickly) she evolves, making it nearly impossible not to think of a film like The Terminator in the process (since the computers take over the world).  Still, as far as relationships goes, these OS programs might be an early look at the future of society (currently evident with Apples Siri personal assistant program).  And, in case you're wondering, this story does not avoid the absurdity of dating a computer and tackles that subject, too.

Overall, Her is a love story for the digital age  and to be frank, its long overdue for an honest, authentic look at the direction society might be traveling towards.  Together, Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johansson mesh unexpectedly well  and even perform musical duet together at one point.  This film not only focuses on a human/PC relationship, it also tackles the hardships involved with relationships in general.  That aspect alone makes this one of the most enjoyable films during this award season.  Regardless, Spike Jonze has created a masterpiece that should be recognized, not only for the incorporation of the great acting and ironic subtleties, but also for its direction, soundtrack, and screenplay.  Her is a film that everyone in the modern digital age should take a chance on viewing.  While some scenes can be unnerving, its worth it to witness a film that might just look like the future of humanity.

6144314,5,B00H9HZITU,"Truth be told, I've never been a huge fan of Spike Jonze as a filmmaker. I thought that he was obviously a creative individual getting his start in film through making visually striking and much-admired music videos for the likes of The Beastie Boys, R.E.M., and Bjork. His first feature film, the Charlie Kaufman-penned BEING JOHN MALKOVICH, to me, radiated a vibe of a hipster David Lynch, and while being creative, just seemed to be too clever for its own good. With his follow-up ADAPTATION, also penned by Kaufman, it seemed to me to be more of a hipper-than-thou version of a Coen Brothers film. But with the romantic sci-fi high-concept HER, Jonze seems to have found a beautiful love story, a uncomfortably real portrait of loneliness, and maybe even something of a cautionary tale, but most importantly, it seems to be his most accessible and most distinct film, not to mention one of the very best films of 2013.

HER, set in a not-terribly-distant future Los Angeles, follows the daily grind of Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix), an introverted, introspective, and disconnected man whose job is composing love letters to people using sample writing from other people. He is in the midst of a divorce from his wife Catherine (Rooney Mara), and his only real human connection is with his married friend Amy (Amy Adams). He plays video games and goes to sex chatrooms connected through his smartphone to make something of a connection with other people. Soon though, the OS1 is released, which is an artificially intelligent operating system for computers and phones. He buys it, installs it, and selects a female voice to be the OS. She calls herself Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson), and she is a wonder right out of the box. She's immediately charming, funny, intelligent and sexy. She's the perfect woman for Theodore, but she is just a program. Regardless, Theodore takes her with him everywhere, even fastening a safety pin in his shirt pocket so that the phone's camera sticks out above the top, and can be her eyes to the real world. Before long, Theodore wants only to spend all of his waking and sleeping hours with Samantha, and strangely, vice versa. They are in love. But Samantha wants to be tactile for him. They both know that something that is only a simluation of a love affair can never be as fulfilling as the real thing. But is it real? Can a person fall in love with a program, and can it fall in love back?

HER is a work of sublime genius in all of its categories. Jonze writes and directs this feature without reliance on his past quirkiness, allowing the camera to tell the story, and creating this world through his amazing screenplay without judgment on its characters or the situation and allowing the world to exist in a state of ambiguity gives the audience more opportunity to judge for themselves what they've just seen. From an acting standpoint, Phoenix, like his namesake, has risen from the ashes of delving into his inside-joke faux-career as a would-be rapper that might have propelled him into obscurity, but with his amazing performance in THE MASTER last year and his remarkable performance in this film, he can still be considered easily one of the great actors of his generation. Theodore is practically the antithesis of just about every character he's ever played; he's a nebbishy, shy sad-sack who barely peeks out of his shell, as opposed to the extremely volatile and flamboyant personalities he usually appears as, and playing against type is just what makes this one of Phoenix's most potent performances. Adams is perfect as the girl next door; she seems to exist only to be the platonic apple of Theodore's eye, but still makes a three-dimensional character out of this trope. But even these acting powerhouses take something of a backseat to the work done by Johansson here. Aside from the vocal and physical work that Andy Serkis put into the character of Gollum/Smeagol in THE LORD OF THE RINGS films, this is the only other time that I feel that a vocal performance should have been eligible for an Oscar. Johansson gives this film her all, and you can feel her glee, her passion, her sadness and her reality just through her voice. It's just this side of miraculous.

There are scenes in HER that will stay with you long after the film is over. The first sex chat scene between Phoenix and the voice of Kristen Wiig is crazy and utterly hilarious; the songwriting scene with Theodore and Samantha is a thing of great and deep beauty; their love scene is tender and sexy; the blind date he has with Olivia Wilde's character is exciting, fun, but illustrates Theodore as a man committed to his perfect non-human ideal; the flesh-and-blood surrogate that Samantha enlists to be her body for Theodore is one of the most uncomfortable scenes in American cinema this year; and pretty much the entirety of the third act is breathtaking and heartbreaking and affirming. I know that the film's concept is what's on most people's minds when they wonder about this film, but the question of ""Can a human being really fall in love with a machine?"" is secondary to the exploration of how love even exists to begin with. As Amy calls love at one point in the film, ""The only socially acceptable form of insanity"": That's the point that cuts straight to the heart of the film, and the film, in hindsight, becomes less a critique of our society's dependence on immediately-available technology. That's not to say that it's not a question worth exploring, but it's not the question that drives the film.

HER has been whisking away Best Original Screenplay awards since awards season began, and deservedly so. It raises so many questions about humanity and human nature and the nature of love, and even endeavors to try to answer some of them. It's a remarkable film that is funny, charming, smart, moving, and ultimately a one-of-a-kind. One of the very very best films of 2013.",1391817600,8,5936,4.7939453125
6144315,4,B00H9HZITU,"Writer/director Spike Jonze (with a post-production boost from Steven Soderbergh) directs this sweetly weird but much-acclaimed story about a lonely writer in the process of a divorce, who buys a new operating system which provides him with an electronic companion. The more he talks with the OS, the smarter it gets. This unique and unpredictable film holds our attention from the very beginning.

We see (and hear):
  * Joaquin Phoenix (""Walk the Line"") stars as Theodore, the mildly depressed fellow with the new operating system; he selects a female voice and names it ""Samantha."" I've never seen Phoenix laugh so freely.
  * Amy Adams (""Man of Steel"") brings us Amy, a friend in his residential tower who is married to a control freak.
  * Rooney Mara (""The Social Network"") is his soon-to-be ex. All they have to do is sign the divorce papers but they have never discussed what went wrong.
  * Olivia Wilde (""Butter"") plays the charming blind date who doesn't want to be a flash in the pan. She would really like a relationship.
  * Scarlett Johansson (""Don Jon"") voices Samantha, the irresistibly sweet and funny OS, who becomes the light of his life.
  * Chris Pratt (""Delivery Man"") is Paul, totally happy to go on a double date, even though his friend Theodore is dating an operating system.

This has been nominated for three Golden Globes, so let me add my own comments: the editing is brilliant. Subtle expressions which flit across Phoenix's face, reflect his reactions to Samantha's voice as she speaks. There are many long, long takes of just his face and voice reacting to Samantha. You will NOT be bored unless you have a hearing problem, in which case either go to a theater with closed captions or wait for the DVD. By the way, in another auditorium (same complex) the next day, I saw previews for this one and could hear every single word. Maybe it was the copy we saw at the screening. Hmmm....

Shot in Shanghai and Los Angeles, augmented by some green screen work, this gives us a frightening peek at the not-too-distant future, with everyone totally involved with his or her hand-held electronic device; there is no human interaction on the street, in the train or at the desk. Scary.... (Have you walked down the street lately?) Amazon will tell me when the DVD is available.",1391817600,5,2301,4.760705289672544
6144316,4,B00H9HZITU,"Back in 1966, there was ELIZA. It came nowhere near the Turing test - but a few people thought they were having a typed conversation with another, albeit infuriating, human. And some, despite the fact that it was just a program (or because of it), still poured their heart out to it.

Fast-forward forty-five years. We have iPhones, speech recognition, great advances in AI, the permanently plugged in generation, Watson, Suri, and Amazon or Netflix predicting your preferences based on history. It's hardly a surprise that the voice in the box gets smarter, more responsive, and more adaptable to the user's expressed interests, and it's increasingly natural to expect that voice to be with you at all times. That's where the movie starts - almost a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Simone/dp/B00007G1YQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Simone</a>&nbsp;for everyone, tailored to the individual, everywhere, all the time.

We also have Asimov's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Three-Laws/dp/055338256X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Three Laws</a>. When people develop any kind of relationships, heartbreak is a possibility. When people develop relationships with new kinds of minds, new kinds of unforeseen outcomes become possible. I'll stop here to avoid spoilers, but I found this movie a brilliant, if not explicit mashup of fact and fiction from the last five years as much as the last fifty. That hint of reality is really what pulls the viewer along - not that it's wild extrapolation. Instead, it's too close for comfort when you see how dependent even today's smartphone users become on their electronics.

Not a movie for the action-oriented, it still gives a lot to think about.

6144317,5,B00H9HZITU,"One of my main problems with this modern world that we live in is that people don't know how to talk to each other anymore. Due to social media and the cell phones, and the tablets and the computers that help us get through daily life, we have forgotten how to connect with one another on a human level. This is only one of the grand ideas explored in Spike Jonzes love story Her.

Set in the near future (maybe 20 years from now), Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix), a writer who is left withdrawn and deeply saddened by his recent divorce downloads the first artificially intelligent operating system, and receives an OS assistant in the form of Samantha, voiced by Scarlett Johansson. Way more than your average Siri, Samantha is sweet, soulful, smart and frighteningly human. She asks personal questions and wants to be a real part of Theodores life. Eventually, they develop a romantic relationship, if you could call it that.

Theodore has always had trouble committing in relationships. Not that hes going to go out and cheat at first chance, but you get the impression that he is really irked by spending the remainder of his life with one person. Hes sensitive but has trouble communicating his feelings. This ended his marriage with Catherine (Rooney Mara). The only consistent female relationship hes ever had is with his onetime girlfriend and longtime friend Amy (Amy Adams), who is also friends with her operating system.

The mood of Her reminded me alot of Lost in Translation. The metropolis of Los Angeles has never been more gorgeous than it is in Her, but it makes a point to show how isolated people are becoming in the world these days. This is, of course, set in the future, but it isn't that far off at all. In this universe, computers are almost completely controlled by voice commands. People wear earpieces that navigate their computers, cell phones and operating systems. People are constantly wandering the streets, but its rare that you find someone who isn't walking by themselves, talking to their operating systems or having emails read to them over their little earpieces.

If you think about it, people are becoming more and more isolated in the world we live in today. This kind of stuff could absolutely be a reality one day in the near future. With technological breakthroughs becoming more and more advanced and ostentatious, the technological universe explored in Her could easily become a reality one day, and thats a sad thing.

Its a mood piece. Theres a generally gloomy and somber aura around the film, but its consistently fascinating and entertaining. We go to the movies because we want the filmmaker to take us somewhere. Jonze creates a complex and fascinating world that will leave you with many internal questions about yourself and others around you.

Theodore experiences such joy carrying Samantha around and talking to her, even taking a vacation with her, and it makes the viewer so sad, because this guy is really just talking to himself, basically. The viewer should feel sorry for him, but they should also just truly understand him. We are all looking for something or someone to make a human connection with, and Her reminds us that its hard and sometimes a losers battle. But its always worse to be completely alone in the crowded, yet desolate landscape of everyday life.

Initially, I was extremely off-put by the premise of Her. I thought it sounded ridiculous. I left the theater not feeling that way at all. Its a character study about what the heart wants/needs after its been broken. Its an odd love story, but its full of powerful messages, and questions that will haunt you long after you're home from the theater.

6144318,5,B00H9HZITU,"Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix) composes beautifully hand written letters for a living. He is lost in his work and world of futuristic electronic gadgets. His wife (Rooney Mara) has filed for divorce. He buys the next best thing in computers, an operating system that thinks for itself. At this point the weird sets in as Theodore develops a strong emotional attachment for his OS Samantha (Scarlett Johansson) as does Samantha for him.

The film doesn't evolve into the jealous computer comedy I had hoped for, but rather examines the lives humans have developed for their computers and how it effects our human relationships; how we actually prefer to be with our electronic devices more than each other. It reminds me of those family reunions when we all get together in the same room, and everyone is on their own computing/smart device.

The film gives a whole new meaning to ""computer dating."" This is some what of a chick flick, in that it deals with emotions and relationships. It goes deep into attempting to understand ourselves.

This movie is on the arty side. A long two hours as it is character driven. Not for everyone.

6144319,5,B00H9HZITU,"Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.

In the near future Los Angeles (Shanghai subbing for L. A.) created by Spike Jonze everyone walks around the hazy city talking to themselves with one of those Bluetooth-like receivers, hardly noticeable, stuck into their ear.  While everyone has a small cell phone device, it's usually in the pocket.  It looks stupid in the fictional future as it does today.

Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix in perhaps his best performance) is a bit of a dweeb, working for a company that writes personal letters for clients who don't have the gift of language to express their emotions.  Theodore has just broken up with his wife and love of his life.  Catherine (Rooney Mara) and Theodore have known each other since their school days but as many marriages go they have become more distant.  Divorce is imminent.

Theodore's life is lonely and he decides to splurge on the newest computer operating system.  After a brief interview by a computer he is provided with his new computer voice.  This time a woman's voice replacing a man's.  But this O/S is different.  It has the ability to adapt and is constantly learning.  It is also voiced by Scarlett Johansson who gives herself the name Samantha.  While this new OS1 system is relatively new and likely expensive, it is not unusual for it to become friends or friendly and in Theodore's case even romantic with their users.

In the theater I was in, a couple of middle aged women behind me began laughing and giggling early on.  And for the life of me I couldn't understand why.  I suspect they had stumbled into a movie expecting a comedy, the likes of something Will Ferrell and Kristen Wiig might star in.  Although the movie has humor (Wiig is actually in this movie as the voice of SexyKitten, Theodore's ""phone date"") it is more appropriately a mature romance.  The idea of having a relationship with a computer, even an evolved one, seems ridiculous on the surface.  But Jonze presents the material in such a way that it gets past the weird phase quickly.  He is helped of course by a couple remarkable performances by Phoenix and Johansson.  Each have different challenges.  Phoenix is on-screen for the whole movie, often acting by himself or with a bodiless voice.  Johansson actually did her role after filming had ended.  She manages to convince the audience that, sure one could fall for her.

Amy Adams plays uh...Amy, Theodore's best friend.  No romance there which is why I suspect, her looks are glammed way down.  Olivia Wilde plays a quasi-blind date (he's seen her picture) for Theodore.  Some trio of co-stars for Joaquin.  If I have a quibble, it is with some of the sets and costumes.  Theodore, in particular, has some of the ugliest clothes possible.  The interiors just didn't seem futuristic.  This film is beautifully written (Spike Jonze again) and has some interesting characters.  It is emotional, deeply romantic and ultimately a bit sad.  Highly recommended.",1391558400,4,2968,4.854291417165669
