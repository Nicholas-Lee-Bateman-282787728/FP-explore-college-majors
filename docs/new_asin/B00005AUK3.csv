1418840,4,B00005AUK3,"In the mood for something cheesy, I hit the local video rental place in search of an entertainingly-bad cult b-flick. 'The Thing With Two Heads' DVD had just recently hit the shelves, so I decided to take a gamble on it. I'd never seen it before, and until now it was almost impossible to find on video. Fortunately, I was in for a treat- it is indeed as silly and corny as I'd hoped it'd be!
A weird mix of horror, medical drama, blaxploitation, sci-fi, and chase/suspense, 'The Thing...' can't quite figure out exactly what it wants to be. Never the less, this little confusion is what adds to the movie's cheesy charm. Then of course there's the not-so-special effects: check out the scenes with the two-headed gorilla and our double-noggined marquee man as he (they?) outrun the cops on a dirt bike!
Grier & Ray Milland's on-screen chemistry worked about as well as oil & water, which would be an absolute disaster were this a good flick. But here, it's practically a necessity! Also, if you wanna experience the most incompetent police force since the Keystone Kops & the trashing of more fuzz cars than you'd see in an entire season of 'The Dukes of Hazzard', then the climactic chase scene through a grassy Southern California valley will surely make your day!

1418841,4,B00005AUK3,Kind of a cool movie I thought most of it was funny total camp movie from the 70's not what I remembered but a good overall movie.  Sound and video transfer was done good.,1005264000,,171,4.029411764705882
1418862,2,B00005AUK3,"This movie is a sequel of sorts...but not really....to the Incredible 2 Headed Transplant. It stars Ray Milland near the end of his long career and Rosey Grier. It's sort of a cross genre movie. It isn't just a science-fiction movie, it is also a blaxploitation movie.

I didn't exactly enjoy watching Ray Milland play a bigot but that is what he is in this movie. Later in life he played the bad guy in a bunch of movies.
Most people criticize former stars for taking on movies such as these after they are no longer big 'A' list stars and call it 'sad' that they are in these movies. I don't agree. They automatically assume they need the money. Sometimes this might be the case, but certainly not always. It's certainly possible that older actors who are no longer leading men just want to act because they are bored and sometimes even enjoy starring in these types of movies. Charlton Heston is a perfect example. He just didn't want to star in biblical epics and such and later in his career he chose to star in less serious science fiction movies because he wanted to. Other actors may choose to be in lesser movies just to get a chance to direct. There are millions of people in Hollywood who would give anything to have a starring role in a movie such as this one. So there is no need to call it 'sad'.

As far as the movie goes....it is better than The 2 Headed Transplant but that's not saying much.

Positives....the makeup is much better and they fake heads look much better than they did in the previous movie. The ;acting is pretty good with the exception of Rosey Grier, which is understandable since he was a football player looking to cash in on his star power and act. The plot is good in the first half of the movie.

Negatives...the second half of the movie, which I suspect had some rewrites. The police car chase was just ridiculous and way too long and way too over the top for me. A bunch of cops in different cars repainted to look like police cars chase a motorcycle around a field for twenty minutes. This gets quite boring after awhile and the movie turns into a joke after being serious for the first half. They then jump into a motorcycle race and then proceed to go as fast as everyone else despite the massive amount of weight. All the other racers crash upon seeing the two headed man. At this point, the movie might as well just be a comedy.

SPOILER ALERT
The movie raises some interesting legal questions. If Ray Milland's head was removed and died, would that be considered murder? What would happen if the only way to keep him alive would be to stay attached to Rosey Grier's body? Could they still execute hime?  I didn't like the way the movie ended because Rosey Grier's character just drives off happily even though he is still a convicted killer that is supposed to be put to death. The movie never satisfactorily absolves him of his crimes. All we get is Rosey's claim that he has been blackmailed...the same claim as every other killer on death row. The black doctor is essentially an accomplice at this point. In effect, they are all on the run even though the movie doesn't portray it that way. Also, Ray Milland's head is left alive even though earlier in the movie they clearly said that if the transplant wasn't done immediately he would die. The script was probably rewritten as Rosey Grier wants to donate his body to science and look for the real killer at the same time.

Recommended only for fans of 70's drive in movies, living head movies and blaxploitation films.",1458345600,,3521,4.475077881619938

1418870,4,B00005AUK3,"When AIP was at its peak they were releasing all sorts of movies headed for drive ins and grindhouse theaters across the country. As things began to slow down they reached out to other genres like the Blaxploitation films of the seventies as well. So when you take the mad scientist sci-fi film and combine it with that genre what do you get? Of course, this movie.

Actor Ray Milland, who had seen better days and seemed to be in several AIP movies to make money as he aged, is Dr. Maxwell Kirshner, a scientist who no longer operates due to a degenerative disease he has acquired. The institute he founded is the leading location in the country for transplant surgery. But behind the doors of his mansion he has other experiments progressing. Of course the main one involves transplanting the head of one animal onto the body of another so that two heads are found, the replacement head sharing the body until it takes over. At that time the original head is removed, in theory.

Kirshner has performed this surgery on a gorilla and so far so good. He brings in Dr. Desmond (Roger Perry) to assist, informing him at that time that he doesnt have long to live. With the surgery a success hes hoping to find a donor body so that when he dies he can have Desmond transfer his head to a new body.

At the same time Kirshner welcomes a new staff member to the institute he runs. Perhaps welcome isn't quite the word though. The new doctor, Dr. Fred Williams (Don Marshall), is black and Kirshner hem haws around at first but his prejudice against blacks is soon obvious. Williams takes the job for the time being with the intent of leaving as soon as possible.

Things escalate and Kirshner soon finds himself in dire need of a donor. Desmond reaches out to a few political friends and they set up offering the position to donate their bodies to science to the inmates on death row. One inmate, Jack Moss (Rosie Grier) takes the opportunity as he sits down in the electric chair. Transferred to the Kirshner mansion where Kirshner is already on life support, the surgery begins.

Needless to say this is where the humor kicks in. As Kirshner awakes while his other head is still sedated, he looks down to see his hand is black. With a disgusted look he asks Desmond if this is some kind of joke. Informed that this was the only donor available he learns to live with it for the moment with the hope of changing bodies once again at a later date.

But when Jack wakes up to discover what has happened his reaction is less favorable. His hope was to stay alive long enough to prove that he was framed. Now he finds that he may not only lose his life but his body as well. When the time is right, he sedates his nurse and escapes the mansion. From here it becomes a lengthy car chase that offers nearly as many car crashes and explosions as the hottest crash filled films of the time.

During his escape Jack took Dr. Williams hostage in the hope he could remedy the situation. Finding plenty to laugh at in Kirshners predicament, Williams agrees. What happens in the end offers a final commentary on race relations when it comes to exploitation films.

This is not Oscar material here folks but what it is is a funny movie that offers a great example of both genres that have been combined. It never goes too far into either and details be damned when it comes to surgery that can accomplish this feat in less than 30 minutes. Grier was never a thespian of the highest order but he handles himself well here. Milland had seen better days as an actor but his crotchety old man routine works well in this situation. The effects are actually quite good for a movie with this small of a budgeter. In the end all combine to make a movie that is actually better than could be expected and one that would make a great night of drive in style fun should you wish to schedule an evening of movies from that genre.

The Olive Films edition just released presents the movie in blu-ray format with a solid picture quality considering the source material. As with most Olive releases there are no extras involved, instead focusing on the blu-ray release itself.",1436313600,,4143,4.46957671957672

1418891,5,B00005AUK3,I originally saw this movie on one of those late night monster movie programs back in the early 80's. I always loved how rediculous it was. Glad I could add it to my dvd collection.,1378252800,,181,4.2
1418912,5,B00005AUK3,"I give this movie five stars because it is as funny if not funnier after the umpteenth viewing as it was the first time through.  I first saw it on late-night TV and from the scene of the gorilla emptying the tiny corner grocery of way too many customers to the scene of Rosie and his girlfriend driving away in a truck singing ""O Happy Day"" I was entranced.  One can imagine that Ray Milland and Rosie Grier must have had a good time making this movie.  If they did not, they should have.

The first thing to do is suspend all faculties of disbelief and critical thinking.  This movie is strictly for laughs despite the theme of a bigoted racist getting his just deserts.  The plot is perfectly absurd.  Other reviewers have given the details, and some have also noted their favorite lines.  Out of the many I rather like ""You'll get us both killed"" shouted out by the terrified Milland head as they race on a motorcycle ahead of the veritable army of cop cars (cleverly staged), and ""Maybe when I get used to it"" from Rosey's girlfriend when Rosey wants a little cuddling, despite the extra head on his shoulder.

Slapstick and absurdity--well-combined in this movie.  Not everyone's cup of tea to be sure, but for those who appreciate such endeavors, this movie is a keeper.",1349395200,,1277,4.537117903930131

1418917,3,B00005AUK3,"Have you ever wondered how cool it would be to have a second head grafted on your body, right next to yours?  I have, and so has Hollywood, the land of candy cane dreams and pennywhistle fantasies.  Now I know some will say, 'Why do we need another two headed freak type movie?  We've already got two entries in the `two-headed man' genre with The Manster (1962) and The Incredible 2-Headed Transplant (1971).'  And I might agree, if not for the fact that neither of those two films really deals with the social ramifications that the AIP release of The Thing with Two Heads (1972) touches on, specifically what happens when you graft the head of a white bigot's head on a soul brother's body, the consequences being pure cinematic gold (well, okay, maybe not, but it's sure fun to watch).
The Thing with Two Heads was directed by Lee Frost, who also gave us such lurid exploitation pictures as The House on Bare Mountain (1962), The Defilers (1965), and Policewomen (1974) and stars Oscar winning actor Ray Milland (no, he didn't win the award for this film, but for the 1945 film The Lost Weekend) and former L.A. Rams football player Roosevelt `Rosey' Grier.  With respect to Milland, it certainly is interesting, even a bit sad, to see a once great star wallow uncomfortably in number of trashy 70's B pics like this or Frogs (1972), just to name a few.
As the film starts, we are introduced to Dr. Maxwell Kirshner (Milland), a highly successful surgeon who runs a number of clinics specializing in human transplants.  We also learn that Maxwell is terminally ill, and is conducting a secret experiment in his basement, one designed specifically in mind with the possibility of saving his life.  If you guess it has something to do with transplanting his head onto another body, you'd be right.  The experiment involves grafting a second head onto a gorilla (played by Oscar winning special effects makeup artist Rick Baker), and then removing the original head, seeing if the newly grafted head survives.  The process takes about a month, allowing for the second head to grow strong enough assuming control of the host body.  There's a pretty funny scene when the gorilla escapes, and terrorizes a convenience store before being recaptured.
Anyway, the gorilla experiment is a success, opening the door for a human head transplant, but Maxwell's condition is deteriorating rapidly, and he soon goes into a coma, but not before instructing his subordinates to follow through with his plans.  Only problem is a compatible host/donor body is extremely difficult to come by...until inquires are made with the prison board, and a likely candidate is found in a supposedly wrongfully convicted black man on death row, Jack Moss (Grier), scheduled to be executed.  Jack, seeing a chance to prolong his existence for another month, allowing for him to try and find the only man, who went missing at the time of his trial, and could clear him by supplying a credible alibi, accepts the deal.  Thing is, Jack has no idea what's in store for him.  So what happens when both men realize what has happened?  And who gets to keep the body in the end?
The concept here is surely interesting, albeit deeply entrenched in the realm of fantasyland.  I know not if this film was meant to be a serious science fiction picture or not, but given the smattering of comedy throughout, I am assuming the latter.  Most of the truly funny scenes come from the situations arising after the surgical procedure, and Milland's character's expounding of bigoted statements.  Racism in and of itself certainly isn't funny, but the level stupidity within Milland's character and his lack of control over the situation sure is...okay, the scenes where Grier is running around with a plastic head attached to his should did look fake, but I didn't focus on that too much.  The scene that really sort of derailed the film from being better than it was, for me, was the extended chase scene on the motorbike.  It was funny for like a few minutes, but then, probably due to the skimpiness of the plot, runs for much longer than it should have, lasted well over 15 minutes.  My favorite scene was when Jack and Maxwell, on the lamb as Jack is still a convicted criminal, go to Jack's girlfriend's apartment (I love her absolute lack of shock at seeing this strange creature, and her utterance, `You get into more sh$t...'), and Jack tries to initiate intimacy with her, to which she expresses uneasiness with Maxwell's head right there.  Jack then turns to Maxwell and states, `Now you know you got to go...'
The print used on this release looks really good, and is in wide screen format.  The only special feature available is a theatrical trailer for the film, which is almost as funny as the film.  Sure, this cheese may stink, but at least it goes easy, not taking itself too seriously.  One thing I did learn from this film is that when one head of a two-headed man smokes a cigarette, the smoke will actually expel from the mouth of the head not smoking...seems logical to me...and pretty funny...

Although more has been written about the scenes involving `the thing with two heads' than about the rest of the film, the first half is clearly the strongest: scenes that involve Kirshner being dragged in his basement or meeting with various colleagues especially come to mind. After the operation has taken place, the film predictably shifts its attention to the Kirshner-Moss relationship. It is initially intriguing, and the final ten minutes are almost as effective as the first half, but repetitions are numerous until the film gets there (a far too long chase sequence is mainly at fault). The interaction between Kirshner, Moss and Williams, a black doctor played by Don Marshall, is quite interesting, though: the first two blackmail the latter, both for different reasons, and Williams finds himself in the middle of options which could all benefit him in one way or another.
