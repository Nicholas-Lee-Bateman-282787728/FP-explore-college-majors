8640102,1,B00I9H3VWU,"I started watching and within 5 minutes I realized this movie was going to be stupid... however, I tried to give it a chance and watched another 20 minutes before I tried commiting suicide... I cant believe they make this type of stupid movies.",1400025600,,244,4.568181818181818
8640103,2,B00I9H3VWU,"Most martial arts films no matter what the budget or how great the premise is should never suffer when it comes to the core material...MARTIAL ARTS ACTION.  This movie has slow, disorganized and terribly choreographed fight scenes that are laughable at best.  Examples of this is are rampant throughout one-on-one and gang fights where punches miss and do not connect yet the actor grunts in pain and falls to the ground.  Gang fights are even worse and look like something a child put together with his friends after they saw their favorite chop-socky film. I've seen better choreographed fights at a death metal concert mosh pit!!  The prop swords used seem like they could break at any second with how much they clearly bend during fight scenes and look like aluminum foil has been wrapped around a cardboard sword.  Then again, it could just be the handlers of said props or the overall camera and editing direction.  Finally, there is the plot which poses as a CROWS ZERO, THE WARRIORS and any other post-apocalyptic films where only the strong survive.  This theme has been rehashed many times but when done right can produce an entertaining popcorn type film worth viewing.  NOT THE CASE IN THIS FILM!!!!!  The only redeemable quality is the overall poor direction of the film which creates ridiculously comedic situations.  The acting is hilarious with over accentuated expressions, mannerisms and fight scenes that one just can't help but laugh.  Special effects are used that make no sense (transparent angel wings?) and they could have invested the money to create it into better choreography, props or well...anything!!!!  Folks, I've seen many martial arts flix and there is only one reason anyone watches them...THE ACTION!  There are many of these films that are made with a shoestring budget and revisited plots, but the action is solid, sharp and skillfully put together.  I cannot recommend this film to any self respecting action fan and the only reason I didn't give it a 1 star is because it kept me morbidly entertained with it's unintentional comedy.  So, if you're looking to laugh at a post apocalyptic martial arts film that takes itself seriously, this is for you!  Make sure you have absolutely nothing to do that day, an open mind, GOOD friends (they may question your friendship when you make them watch it!) and plenty of alcohol....'cause you're gonna need all these to get through it!",1399334400,2,2417,4.930864197530864
8640104,2,B00I9H3VWU,"After the world is destroyed by chemical warfare, a city in Malaysia is divided into clans. The city claimed there was 5 but named 6 and only 3 played major roles. Girls dress in clean and press school uniforms. Seems some things are eternal. The story gets more confusing as it goes on. There is a ""free zone"" where no fighting is allowed. In fact the elders or seniors came up with a peace treaty. The youth reject everything the elders did, and want to move on without the laws.

Meanwhile one man wants a girl but her ""brother"" won't allow it. The clans are controlled by perform men, with ""X"" and ""Y"" having the most power. ""X"" being the good guy and ""Y"" the antagonist. Sometimes they wear 1/2 face respirators because of the chemicals, but the air is normally clean enough to play death metal music.

Fighting is done by martial arts, but it is not a very good martial arts film. It is a Malaysian version of a grindhouse that feels like it was based on a video game with all the action.

The fighting factions represented a microcosm of the world which fought and destroyed themselves. The old laws seemed to work better than the fighting and anarchy desired by the youth, but by the metaphor the film was attempting to create, they had to cease so a new world no order could be established. It didn't work well in making a sensible plot.

A younger man might enjoy this more than me.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Some mild swearing. The words are different from the spoken English to the subtitles. Apparently d-head is the same as a-hole.  $9.96 Walmart.",1399161600,2,1580,4.487804878048781
