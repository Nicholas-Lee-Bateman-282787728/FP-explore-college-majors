8104676,5,B000E371J6,I got this for my grandson the logger. He was more enthusiastic about it than he has been over any gift for quite awhile! He said it had info he didn't know and presented it well. Coming from a family that has been in logging for a number of generations that is high praise indeed!,1407628800,,281,4.127272727272727
8104677,4,B000E371J6,"Many years ago I stocked and sold products used by loggers and sawmills and it was an interesting area. Many towns in the northwest had a sawmill and now there are only a few in a whole state. This is an interesting overview of that industry starting with the first settlements and progressing along through the times after the second world war and beyond. Building housing and the development of the railroads drove logging in the past. Clearing land for housing and farming was a great factor until a great percentage of the eastern half of the country was pretty much logged out. In the west the railroads were given many sections of forest land in order for them to expand all the way to the west coast. Until T. Roosevelt came along, it was just cutting and producing without limits. He was the first president to think about conservation in logging. Roosevelt appointed G. Pinchot to look after the forests and the conservation effort. That was the start of many acres being protected and managed. After his time the education effort began on reforestation. Of course F. Weyerhouser was the first big timber baron and then Weyerhouser and Georgia Pacific became the really large timber and sawmill companies. Each of the wars brought boomtime for the industry. Now the timber industry and growing trees is a much more scientific and controlled program that requires technology and education for continuous supply and a growing forest situation. I enjoyed this DVD just as I enjoy much of the real history and I recommend it. I only wish it could have even more detailed as I know that it just touched on the information concerning timber and logging and developments of that industry.",1384214400,,1690,4.810996563573883
