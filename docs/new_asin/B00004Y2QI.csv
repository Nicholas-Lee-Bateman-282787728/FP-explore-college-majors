7926412,3,B00004Y2QI,"Taken from a Douglas Kennedy novel and transplanted to France,The Bigger Picture seems to suggest that sometimes your life is transformed as a result of changing circumstances that evolve out of chance rather than character development. Romain Duris plays the lead,Paul Exben,a lawyer in a law firm headed by Anne(Deneuve)who is dying and wants to give him her shares. However due to the happenstaunce of his wife having a lover,who is a photographer,and the accident that results from his encounter with him, we get into another kind of film,a thriller on the run with the adoption of the other man's identity,recalling Antonioni's The Passenger. He has a lovely wife,home and family of 2 children,whom he loves and a great job and bourgeois existence,however he had given up on fulfilling his 1st love,becoming a photographer. His departure from home and his kids is heart-breaking. Where to?

There is much tension in the death scene and the disposing of the body and his taking on of the new identity. His cover is always threatening to be blown. He settles in a beautiful hilltop cottage in Montenegro and makes friends with a drunk,Bartholeme(Niels Arestrup),who happens to be a local editor,getting a job as a photographer. Despite the plot hole of assuming another well known man's identity, becoming famous again with an exhibition and being found out, Duris overrides the suspension of disbelief,with a frail,edgy presence. He finds new love. There is no Ripley-esque amorality. Although a little more character development of the supporting roles in the second half would have been beneficial making the narrative more deep.

Romain Duris comes up with a startling performance, his character transitions from one mode to another and the actor just goes freely along with it,Paul is pursued by shame and fear;also Niels Arestrup,recalling his role with Duris in The Beat that my Heart Skipped. Deneuve as usual is excellent. There is a great soundtrack,beautiful cinematography. The momentum of the film undergoes a new plot -twist which underlies the poor ending:we want to see where it will go,we realize he can never escape,fate scuppering best-laid plans. Paul departs into the crowd. To live one's dream one must change one's life. Director Eric Lartigau has done an excellent job of taking Kennedy's novel's complex themes and adapting them for the screen.",1354492800,,2372,5.190600522193211
7926413,4,B00004Y2QI,"After waiting for this movie to be released on DVD in the US, I finally ordered it used for 3 Euro from amazon.de and we watched it in French with German subtitles, I translated the subtitles for my husband.
Well, the actors were all great and it was lovely that Cath&eacute;rine Deneuve had a small part.
Romain Duris plays the husband who disappears (in the novel he disappears to Colorado, in the movie to the Dalmatian Montenegro coast in Yugoslavia) with lots of passion. There is no doubt about his acting skills.
Duris' wife in the movie was very annoying, just like in the novel I felt that she didn't deserve such an understanding and hard working husband. Why did she get married to him, had three children, a nanny, and did not even work to fulfill her dream of writing and then complained that she lived in a golden cage?
Some women don't know how lucky they are and they still keep complaining...oh well :(.

I disliked the ending though (that's why I gave it only 4 stars) and could not really understand why director Eric Lartigau had to change it. I thought the novel ends better, but from the imdb message board I know that there are some people who watched the movie and liked the end.

Very nice bonus features! What I enjoyed most was the interview with author Douglas Kennedy (he speaks French fluently which is rather unusual for an American) and director Eric Lartigau. Kennedy is full of praise for Lartigau's adaption of his novel.
There is also a discussion between Marina Fois, Romain Duris and Eric Lartigau.",1351468800,,1536,4.622710622710622
7926414,4,B00004Y2QI,"Paul Exben is a young Parisian man in his mid Thirties who seems to have it all - a beautiful writer wife - two lovely young children who adore him - a high-powered Solicitor's job that brings him prestige, a lavish inner city apartment and private rooms full of computers and expensive printers so he can indulge in his true passion - photography. He even has Catherine Deneuve as his Boss - who because of her failing health wants to make him even richer by handing over the lucrative reins of the law business to him - for free...

But his wife Sarah seems to be distant of late - and one night she lies about where she acquired an unusual bottle of wine. Genuinely hurt, suspicions stroked and tempers frayed - Paul has an accident in the apartment of another photographer who unwisely gloats on the subject of infidelity - and from here on in Paul's whole world is thrown into disarray. Exben then proceeds to go through a series of almost bizarre life changes that take him half way across Europe where a local drunk suspects something (dialogue above) and beyond into the open sea... To say more is to give away too much.

I liked ""The Big Picture"" a lot. For starters - it's not French navel-gazing pap (as they can be prone to). It's tense, dark and surprising. It's also that best of things - a 'story-film' that takes its sweet time to unfold (nearly two hours). The clever 'big canvas' script bustles along in a sort of trapped-in-a-Hitchcock-film kind-of-way and an intense performance by handsome lead actor Romain Duris keeps you hooked as the twists and turns multiply even to the last few shots.

The BLU RAY image is good at best, but never anymore than that. Mind you I didn't really notice because I was enjoying the movie so much - I suspect many others will also.

7926415,4,B00004Y2QI,"Paul Exben (Roman Duris) has it all, a lovely wife, great job, bags of cash, great home and yet he seems a bit insecure. Catherine Deneuve plays his boss Anne, she has a terminal illness and is about to leave her controlling share in the company to him. So he is about to gain even more albeit with the loss of a caring friend.

He loves his two children and put on acts of capriciousness to endear him to them, which seems to have the opposite effect on his wife. Then he starts to notice subtle changes in his wife's behaviour; Sarah (Maria Fois) seems to be on a short fuse when ever he is around and more relaxed around a certain other man. This man is a jobbing photographer Gregoire; Paul is a rich amateur who had once held ambitions of being a good photographer himself once upon a time.

Then her sudden new taste for New Zealand `Cloudy Bay' and long lunch engagement gets him more suspicious. Things come to a head at a dinner party where one sauvignon blanc too many leads him to act the oaf. The following day spur of the moment decision start a series of events that even `The A Team' would be hard pushed to put right.

This is a well crafted drama with an under lying current of tension that lends more to a thriller than a life tale. The ever presence of photography runs through out and acts like a thread tying all the disparate parts of the story together.

It is beautifully shot too, with some almost iconic shots and great use of scenery and space. The acting is all well above average and Roman Duris does a particularly good performance. Director Eric Lartigan has made a beautifully filmed, challengingly framed and original piece of cinema. Some may find the plot a bit of a stretch, but it is dealing with a situation that few people would ever find them selves in and I found it very entertaining.",1329696000,,1826,4.377581120943953
7926416,5,B00004Y2QI,"I found the product description accurate enough to know that it is programming from the old Army TV series, ""The Big Picture.""  While there are other places to see various editions, it is nice to have some on DVD as a history resource.",1319587200,,235,4.465116279069767

7926418,4,B00004Y2QI,"A film maker (Kevin Bacon) wins the grand prize for his student film, and then finds himself on the Hollywood ""fast track.""  Increasingly, he is asked to sublimate his creative integrity, and is forced to choose between commercial success and his independence.  This is a very amusing satire about the ""sharks"" of Hollywood versus an ""innocent"" struggling to maintain his autonomy.  The supporting cast includes Eliot Gould, Martin Short, Roddy McDowall, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Eddie Albert.  This film is a must see for people interested in the film industry.  If you liked ""The Player,"" you'll love this film.",970876800,,613,5.151515151515151
