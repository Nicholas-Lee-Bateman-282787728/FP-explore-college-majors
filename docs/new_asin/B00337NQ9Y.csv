Very intriguing to learn about all the government's secret technology, and how the human spies successfully operated in stealth (sometimes for decades), and how much we as a nation were(are) involved with espionage against other nations, and they against us. Also very sobering to learn how traitorous some of our own (double) agents in the trusted CIA/FBI were, and how they were responsible for the deaths of many other people, including our troops. You also learn that the only reason Russia and other countries had the capabilities and technology to race with us (closely behind) in nuclear warhead development, was because of the stolen information they were provided by the U.S.'s (double) agents that were privy to, or entrusted with the knowledge or documents.
 This is a set that will be watched many times as the presentations were so densely packed with boggling details that seems the mind cant comprehend it all in the 1st pass. Very well worth the price.",1264896000,3,1047,5.0520231213872835
