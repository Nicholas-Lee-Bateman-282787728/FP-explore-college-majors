8140765,4,B000HQTPB2,"Merle Oberon stars in LYDIA (aka ""Illusions""), a romantic drama directed by Julien Duvivier (""The Great Waltz"").  Oberon is surrounded by a strong cast including Joseph Cotten, Edna May Oliver and Alan Marshall.

Ageing heiress Lydia MacMillan (Merle Oberon) is unexpectedly reunited with several of her old male admirers; what follows is largely a flashback recalled by Lydia and her friends, where the audience discovers the numerous love affairs and family intrigues which shaped the destiny of Lydia's life.

This is one of the lesser-known movies with Merle Oberon, who specialised in roles like the one she plays in LYDIA.  Joseph Cotten is well-paired with her; whilst Edna May Oliver plays another of her trademark ""snooty society matron"" roles.  LYDIA will be a charming addition to your classic movie collection, especially for Merle Oberon fans.",1200441600,6,856,5.311111111111111
