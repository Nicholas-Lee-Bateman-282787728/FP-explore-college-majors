471728,2,6302491894,This is a review of the Desert Island version of Blood And Roses and not of the film itself. This movie is obviously filmed quite beautifully. But this DVD presents an old video version. And I've seen much cleaner VHS to DVD transfers. This one is second or third generation.

471775,5,6302491894,"Vadim's classic 'Et mourir de plaisir' (Blood and Roses) is finally on DVD and it's the original French language version with English subtitles. I agree with all the other comments on this page....a beautiful masterpiece which is sadly let down by a terrible cheap transfer from a degraded Video copy. The credits are strangely silent which they weren't originally and some scenes are cut altogether (like the dream sequence) but the rest of the movie has reasonably good sound and includes the background music.
The story is suppose to be loosely based on Sheridan Le Fanu's short story Carmilla but really it's worlds away from that original source and yet 'Et mourir de plaisir' always has stood up on it's own as one of the best and most beautiful vampire films ever made. Until we get a perfect original film transfer on DVD (or dare I dream Blu-ray) then this will do for now and I'm happy to at least own even a less-than copy rather than none.",1401753600,3,951,4.666666666666667
471776,4,6302491894,"I love Blood and Roses and ordered the original French version from Desert Island Classics. It does indeed have English subtitles, but NO MUSIC SCORE, which kills the film. To be fair to Desert Island, they offered me a credit for another movie, so they are honest. But they should have mentioned in the description of their DVD of the film that there is no music score.

471807,1,6302491894,"I saw this film many times on the BIG screen (presented in Technirama) back in the 60s, so I know what a beautiful, stylish film BLOOD & ROSES can be, but this ""Desert Island"" disk is a travisty!  Like most of the rip-off, this should be banned.  It should, at the very least, carry a warning like cigarettes: WARNING: this DVD is nothing like the original and can damage your senses.

First of all, the colors are faded & muted and the resolution is poor (it was probably transferred from a 15-year old LP VHS tape  -thank God, VHS is now just a memory!).  And, worst of all, it's in the full-frame format.  BLOOD & ROSES had a format of 2.35:1, compare to this disk's 4:3 ratio.  This means that you're seeing only a THIRD of the image that Claude Renoir lovingly captured!!  The original film was a treat to the eyes, this certainly isn't.

If you don't mind reading English subtitles, or can speak French or German (sans subtitles), do yourself a favor and buy the 2.35:1 DVD that is available in Germany from Amazon.de (and, perhaps, Amazon UK) TITLE: ""... und vor Lust zu Sterben"".  Still not as sharp as a studio release, but the quality is as close as we're likely ever to find (unless Paramount can find a print in decent condition, and decide to re-master a proper release).  This European version is about 10 minutes longer (complete with the 'dream' sequence), but, alas, lacks the voice-over which gives the film a certain eerie, disembodied atmosphere.

Unfortunately, this disk only comes in PAL (Region 2, NTSC is Region 1), so if you don't have a multi-region player, like I do, then, I'm afraid, you're out of luck.",1394841600,10,1633,4.573883161512027

Now, Carmilla sets out to bewitch / seduce not only Leopoldo, but Georgia as well! Leopoldo, in a moment of sheer brilliance, invites Carmilla to tag along on the honeymoon! In the meantime, she quenches her thirst w/ the blood of the family servants. BLOOD AND ROSES is a romantic, horror drama from 1960. As such, it is quite well-done. It is a color film w/ a very memorable black and white dream sequence toward the end. The finale is as poetic as it is creepy!

471813,5,6302491894,"ET MOURIR DE PLAISIR (And Die Of Pleasure) known in England and America as BLOOD AND ROSES is a remarkable little film from director Roger Vadim that was released in 1960. It is Vadim's take on the classic female vampire novella CARMILLA by Sheridan Le Fanu which has been filmed many times most notably as VAMPYR in 1932 and Hammer's THE VAMPIRE LOVERS in 1970. This is absolutely my favorite cinematic version of the story as it combines a number of elements that make it more memorable than the others. The cinematography is first rate, the music score is haunting, the color scheme of the settings and the clothing not to mention the lighting is very effective and the dream sequence at the end (which borrows heavily from Jean Cocteau) once seen is impossible to forget. If the performances aren't up to the level of everything else (especially in the dubbed version), it doesn't matter for this is not a performance driven film.

Set in what was then a contemporary setting (1960), the film opens aboard a jet in flight while a voiceover tells us that the narrator is over 200 years old and that spirits do exist. The film then plays out in flashback as we meet present day members of the Karnstein family, cousins Leopoldo (Mel Ferrer in a role intended for Christopher Lee) and Carmilla (Annette Stroyberg then Vadim). Leopoldo plans to marry Georgia Monteverdi (Elsa Martinelli) not wanting to recognize that Carmilla is in love with him. She then becomes possessed by the spirit of a dead ancestor, the vampire Millarca, who has her own plan for dealing with her cousin. The costume ball and the fireworks display along with the aforementioned dream sequence, raise BLOOD AND ROSES to the level of art.

The film is not for everyone and certainly not for today's horror crowd who want everything jacked up several notches including their romantic encounters. Most would find it incredibly slow and boring (just read some of the other reviews) but if you prefer a MASTERPIECE THEATRE approach to a classic work of supernatural fiction then BLOOD AND ROSES is hard to beat. Just be aware of that fact before you see it. And speaking of seeing it, WHERE IS THE DVD? The fact that the film looks and sounds beautiful on an old Paramount EP videocassette means that on disc or blu-ray in the proper aspect ratio and perhaps with the original French version as an extra (or vice versa), it would be a knockout! A prime candidate for the Criterion or even the Olive Films treatment. Paramount has worked with both of these high quality outfits in the recent past and, as the saying goes, there's no time like the present.",1364256000,4,2624,4.714596949891067
471814,5,6302491894,"Wow, I haven't seen Blood and Roses since my old VCR failed. It was a Great flic with lots of atmosphere!",1364169600,,105,4.0476190476190474
471815,2,6302491894,"The second offbeat Vampire film I watched today was `Blood and Roses'. It was a story about a blonde female vampire that returns to possess the body of a lookalike descendant. She is released from her tomb by an accidental explosion during the fireworks display at a party on an estate.  Yep, that's what I said...a fireworks explosion at a graveyard.  It seems the grave yard had hidden munitions from the last war in it and the fireworks set them off.  Usually I look for Italian and Spanish made horror films because...as I often repeat...they're different than the norm in USA films.  This was made in 1960 and contains the sort of scenes that only appeared in foreign films of that time.  There are scenes with strong lesbian under currents for instance.  The blood on a lower lip caused by a thorn is used as an excuse for the female Vampire to want to kiss a woman.  The thirst of blood is used as the only reason. The two are otherwise both attracted to and in love with the same man. There were scenes where they came close to nudity but the camera angles avoided it.  For instance a topless woman's chest was conveniently blocked by a bed post in exactly the right place or a blanket was pulled up at just the right time as the camera panned.  I figured this was because it was filmed in 1960. Yet strangely the same woman from those scenes, or a double, was later shown totally topless in a bizarre bondage dream sequence.  The film did contain some artist film work and unusual characters.  There were some strange surreal dream sequences like the one mentioned above and one where a victim is seen in a French doors window as if she is under water in a pool.  The new victim opens that door and jumps into the water to join her.  The water is vertically filling in the entire door opening.  Sort of a Stargate effect if you're familiar with that movie. Unfortunately this movie dragged out for me and ultimately bored me.  The attempt at a shock ending also fell flat.  Frankly I'm surprised at the rather high rating, 6.7 out of it 10, it currently has at the IMDB.  I would give it a 2 out of 5 (or 4 out of 10) tops and that's being very generous because the acting was okay.",1361750400,,2191,4.383663366336633
471816,5,6302491894,"This gorgeously shot, hypnotic vampire tale weaves a spell around you like Dracula himself. Based on the ""Carmilla"" story which was also the basis for Hammer Films' ""Vampire Lovers"". There is much more of ""roses"" in this one than ""blood"" - and its horror is psychological rather than in-your-face. Why is this not on DVD yet??",1329004800,5,326,4.839285714285714
471836,5,6302491894,"Roger Vadim's Blood and Roses is a leisurely-paced, atmospheric vampire film which has almost no violence in it (just a good dose of allusions). Mel Ferrer plays aristocrat Leopoldo de Karnstein who is engaged to lovely Georgia (Elsa Martinelli). They are planning a wedding at the Karnstein Estate, and are accompanied by Leopoldo's alluring cousin Carmilla (Annette Vadim) and a male family friend. It soon becomes apparent that Carmilla is deeply in love with Leopoldo, a fact that both Leopoldo and Georgia are aware of, but choose to ignore.

The legend of the Karnstein's vampiric history haunts the estate, and Carmilla, heartbroken at the thought of losing Leopoldo to Georgia, wanders off into the family crypt where she is possessed by the spirit of the vampire Mircalla, who was also her ancestor. Carmilla/Mircalla takes to wandering around at night, dressed in a white gown, and her thirst for blood soon puts the residents of the estate at risk.

Mel Ferrer is the perfunctory male prop here. The two female leads deliver credible performances. Annette Vadim mesmerizes as the lovestruck Mircalla/Carmilla Karnstein, while Elsa Martinelli is beguiling as the hapless, nave Georgia. The plot is rather predictable, and I wished there was more character development. Despite these flaws, I loved watching the beautiful cinematography, the costumes of the period, and the surreal dream sequence at the end. High on atmosphere, this reminded me of a well-executed arthouse horror movie. Recommended for fans of atmospheric horror films, though at present it is only available on VHS (I watched it on a movie rental site I subscribe to).",1307145600,2,1646,5.2075471698113205
471837,4,6302491894,"When viewing this video, I was reminded of how most living horror directors have forgotten the need to enchant and entrance us.
If you like schlock,rip,stake, burn and torture vampire fare, stay away.
Renoir's camerawork provides us with a stunning backdrop which 19th century viewers would recogniise as faithful to Le Fanu's story.
Add slick, edgy 60s French philosophical chic to this, and you begin to get an idea of how good this is. For discerning viewrs only.",1303171200,4,466,4.987179487179487
471838,2,6302491894,"At the end of this film I just decided, as will you, that this movie kind of stinks. The story is of a woman who becomes possessed by a vampire and then spends her time roaming around her castle looking for something to eat. It is seriously lacking something and I would say that it might be directorial talent as Roger Vadim seems to have had no interest in anything while he was making it. Being a vampire movie I found it odd that it was almost completely void of any blood, but it also proves that he wasn't here for cheap thrills. There is also no character development and no evolution of plot. It has no intentions of offending or entertaining or pandering, the acting and set design directly invoke 1960's sitcoms, which is to say they are simple and obvious. I would have to admit though that part of me was interested throughout and I think it was because there was just so much campy fun to be had here. It is also an unusual change of pace for vampire movies. Sure it is nothing like ""Interview With the Vampire"" but who wants to watch that movie until the end of time anyways? There is also no denying the charm of a film in which every line is delivered breathlessly and with a sense of fake seriousness. What are they taking so seriously? Certainly not the incompetent bloodsucker that is chasing them around, and certainly not this film that they are starring in.

""Blood and Roses"" opens with a blase gabfest as rich people sit around talking about vampires, blood, roses. . .that sort of thing. Next we move to a party where the guest of honor, Carmilla, refuses to show up, claiming a broken heart as the reason. Soon however she begins to hear voices. At first I thought they were her thoughts we were listening in to, and that she was lecturing some girl named Carmilla. Turns out she is Carmilla and we are hearing the beckoning of a vampire who will soon take control of her body. The rest of the movie is just an exercise in trying to figure out who she will attempt to eat next. I will admit that a lot of what was happening didn't really register with me and that very well may have been due to my boredom. The rest of the cast is given nothing to do other than look aristocratic, riding around on horses, dining in castles (like the rest of us). The brief run times make it so that it ends just when it feels like the story is starting to move forward. . .not that I am complaining because I was more than ready for the end credits to roll.

Any subtext about women scorned is never fleshed out and left up to the viewer. This is a yarn about a woman who didn't get the man she loved but the script is far too lazy to take it any deeper than that. The lips of the actors were also somewhat problematic as sometimes they lined up perfectly and sometimes they didn't. Was the film dubbed? Partially? There is also a scene which looks to explore (or exploit if you are of a more cynical nature) the endless connection between vampires and lesbians. We get an ever so slightly bloody kiss and the rest, intellectually/sexually, is left up to our imagination. Not that I'm calling for more of that sort of thing, rather that any sort of excitement would have been welcome here as the film moves forward as quickly as a zombie, and just as attractively. **",1173312000,,3277,4.3442088091354

471840,3,6302491894,"Vadim's take on Sheridan le Fanu's tale Carmilla is a somewhat languid chiller, updated to modern (1960) Italy and starring the lovely Annette Stroyberg as Carmilla and Elsa Martinelli as Georgia.  Pitched somewhere between the supernatural and the psychological Vadim draws us into a lushly coloured but oddly crepuscular landscape in which Carmilla may indeed be possessed by the spirit of her vampire ancestor Millarca or alternatively a depressive caught in the spell of an overwhelming romantic imagination.  Mel Ferrer is Leopoldo, the less-than-sympathetic, almost sexist object of her spurned affections. The film's reputation hinges on two scenes of intense dream-like claustrophobia; the first is a rain-soaked kiss in a hot-house replete with a heady lesbian suggestion and the second is a nightmare in monochrome and red inflicted upon Georgia toward the climax.  Beautiully filmed but terribly marred (in fact almost ruined) by the studio 'need' to engage the Exposition Fairy,  destroying Vadim's careful mood with Carmilla's constant voice-overs needlessly 'explaining' to the audience exactly what is happening. Deserving of a DVD Director's re-cut (removing all the awful exposition, ala Bladerunner) and presented in its original Technirama format, no doubt something not very likely to happen.",1150156800,2,1312,5.678571428571429

All progress was made by those of us who dared to be different. And Dare...Vadim did.

7826449,2,6302491894,"The movie, itself, is an incredibly sensual experience. I have a copy on a VCR tape, which is somewhat worn from the many times I have watched it.  The beautiful Irish harp music played throughout the movie added immensely to the sensuality and intrigue of the script.  The actors are first-rate.  The scene where Carmilla, the vampire, is chasing the housemaid down the beautiful Italian villa lane lined with cypress trees while the lilting music from the Irish harp is heard in the background, is absolutely chilling -- chilling because so much evil is trespassing among so much beauty.

Why I gave this DVD a poor rating is because I was very disappointed in the quality.  The sound is barely audible; an important voice-over explanation at the beginning of the movie has been left out, which would explain a great deal to the first time viewer; and the movie, itself, is grainy with several scenes appearing to be ""washed out"" from the transfer to DVD.  With all the technology available today, I was anticipating one of my favorite movies to be digitally remastered -- alas!! this was not the case.",1463875200,,1104,4.78421052631579

7826451,2,6302491894,"I first saw this movie shortly after it was released in the States and again a few days ago on a professionally recorded tape. I thought seeing it again after so many years, I might appreciate it more. My opinions from originally seeing it haven't changed, however. It's just as badly presented now as it was then.

A good portion of the film is voiceover and is so muffled, most of it is unintelligible.  Likewise the soundtrack and dialogue of the actors are muted to the point that I had to turn the volume on my player up as high as it would go to understand it. Through most of the story, the jangling of the harp, which should ordinarily make an eerie background accompaniment to the story, becomes so loud it takes over, drowning out whatevers being said on screen.

Though the story is one that should hold the viewers interest, with the possibility of many frightening moments, most of these opportunities are ignored. The acting is static, the players mostly stand around and talk, interspersed with scenes of a masquerade and the actress playing Carmella wandering the countryside in a white gown which is alternately ripped, torn, and doused with blood, only to miraculously be as good as new the following night.  None of the relationships between the characters is very well explored, except in the voiceover explanations though there are two short scene between Carmilla and her cousin Leopoldo which are telling, especially one in which she faints, he carried her to her bedroom, and then watches as his fiance undresses her and puts her to bed.

Though the cinematography is beautiful, the colors are either bright to the point of garishness or dull, making stark contrasts which I don't believe were intended. There's a fair amount of symbolism, and the ending is ironic, as is to be expected but the overall distortion of the soundtrack and the lack of emotion in this rendition of Sheridan LeFanus Carmella leaves a great deal to be desired, and is a disappointment. That's a pity, because, considering the success of Vadi's other films, such as Barbarella and And God Created Woman, if handled differently, this couldve been a very fine vampire film.

This movie was seen both as a theatrical film and later as a bought version and no remuneration was involved in the writing of this review.",1455062400,,2312,4.796482412060302
7826452,1,6302491894,"Stay clear from DESERT ISLAND CLASSIC version. .......1. DVD-R not TRUE DVD. 2. Language is in FRENCH not ENGLISH as in description. 3. Sub-Titled in English. 4. A rolling bar starts from the bottom and works it way up to the top. 5. Looks like a VHS to DVD-R transfer (grainy & not a sharp picture). This is the 3rd Desert Island Classic DVD title that I have returned due to inferior quality. Also stay away from their title GRAVE OF THE VAMPIRE. The audio does not sync up to the mouth movement, color so faded it looks black and white, GRAINY picture and glitches throughout the film. Sad to say I will NEVER purchase another DESERT ISLAND CLASSIC as all purchases have failed in quality immensely.",1448668800,,702,4.535433070866142
