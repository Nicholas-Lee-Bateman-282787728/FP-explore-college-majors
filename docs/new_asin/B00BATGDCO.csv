5566746,5,B00BATGDCO,"Cheech and Chong animated, I thought they all ready are. This is a great animation, with great voices. A first I hope of many. Cheech and Chong doing ninety nine point nine, percent of the voices, is a GREAT BONUS! A truely talented duet, that we, as United State Citizens, should be very proud and celebrated. These two can never be replaced by anyone, on earth, ever again. They make me Proud to be a U. S. citizen, and proud of the funniest two people on Earth. Thank you GOD, for Cheech and Chong. May they live long and healthy lives. We will never see Comedians, and Greatness,  like these two ever again. Sincerely, Jon Berry Linder, Photographic Artist.",1367625600,8,661,4.554621848739496
5566747,4,B00BATGDCO,"These guys really crack me up. I love this movie. It really doesn't matter if the animation isn't up to Pixar standards since it's really all about the comedy!

I love these guys so much that if either of them were to run for congress, I'd vote for them in a heartbeat over 98% of the people that are currently congressmen! When it comes to everyone's (well, the more intelligent portion of our population) favorite recreational herb, they make more sense than most of our nation's so-called leaders!

I recommend that everyone purchases this just to support the legendary comedy duo even if for no other reason. If you get a few laughs, and you will, then count them as the icing on the cake.",1367452800,5,693,4.536
5566748,5,B00BATGDCO,"If you're lighting up right now, then this one is for you.  If not, you won't get the jokes and anyway what are you doing watchin' a Cheech & Chong movie in the first place?",1367193600,9,173,3.942857142857143
5566749,5,B00BATGDCO,"This reminds me of what the boys were like in their prime. I'm not sure if the young folks will appreciate this as its been a generation since these guys were big. I grew up in the 80's and never liked the Three Stooges but that wasn't my generation either, so I understand. But Cheech & Chong were very popular in my time.

For those of us die hard fans: sit back, grab some smoke, and get ready to laugh.",1367193600,5,406,4.075
5566750,5,B00BATGDCO,"I love Cheech and Chong, they are the ultimate comedy duo :) I enjoyed this movie a lot! I think the animation was pretty cool, and the jokes are funny as always! Peace.",1367107200,,169,4.151515151515151
5566751,2,B00BATGDCO,"I was a fan of the old movies and albums, but the animation is terrible. No, I wasn't expecting Pixar, but why would they even put this out when everything here was done so much better before. Mabey I will try to sit through it again, as it tries to re-live their glory years. But an animated movie with their name on it deserved to be much better.",1366761600,4,348,4.132352941176471
5566752,3,B00BATGDCO,All I wish is that the animation had been better but the jokes and the laughs are still there a wonderful way to spend 85 minutes,1366761600,4,129,4.0
5566753,4,B00BATGDCO,"HEY WATCH THIS! was released 3 years ago and seemed to leave more than a few ""loyal"" cheech & chong fans with a case of cotton mouth so severe that the legacy the duo created, decades earlier, was considered to be tarnished to say the least. Ladies and Gentlemen, This must be the year of the bong because these crazy cats are BACK & BETTER THAN EVER! Many reviews complained the disaster with their last venture ""HWT"" was that the magic was gone, leaving cheech and chong going through the routine while a nostalgic crowd humored their attempts.

All such debates should cease because CHEECH & CHONG'S ANIMATED MOVIE fixes the problem of an aged physical appearance of C&C, that disillusioned some deeming C&C  old enough to break bones instead of smoking them. Classic jokes are brought back giving the viewer ""A+"" material  with some pleasant updates making this animated venture vintage and a MUST! for Cheech & Chong Fans. I'm glad a new generation can get hip and the original fans can enjoy a new addition to the collection. It's crude but that's the humor of course.

 IF YOU ""LOVE"" CHEECH & CHONG... HEY WATCH THIS!",1366675200,6,1124,4.685279187817259
5566754,4,B00BATGDCO,"Very funny mix of old and new jokes. Several skits make up this cartoon version of everything you know and love about Cheech & Chong. From the drugs, girls and celebrities, you will laugh at something and feel it fits well with the existing Cheech & Chong collection.

You expect stupidity from Cheech and Chong but this was just plain stupid. It did not have the funny skits you are used to and it had no logical flow. It was like it was written by a want to be comedian who is five. I did not like it at all. My teenage sons did get a kick out of it but they are not true fans of the duo. I wouldn't waste my money on this one.",1466640000,,536,3.8727272727272726

5566888,1,B00BATGDCO,"I love Cheech & Chong and think they're a great and original team.
Having said that, someone in their camp decided to make a quick buck .
All they did was take cuts from their original 1970s album(s) and put it to a 2013 animation
(doing a voiceover to a cartoon).
Unfortunately the animation was poorly done. Usually happens with a small budget.
I hate to slam anything of Cheech & Chong's, they are the greatest but don't waste your money on this dvd like I did.
Buy the albums instead.",1396051200,,488,4.373626373626373

5566909,5,B00BATGDCO,"Once you get beyond the usual boring animation style, you realize how good the old bits are when they are animated!! Thankfully the humor has aged well. I remember listening to some of these bits on ""Los Cochinos""  when it  was released in '73 and they are still funny. The commentaries are also great and help flesh out some of the history of Cheech and Chong. It's really nice to see that both Cheech and Tommy are still fun to listen to and that they are enjoying something of a resurgence. Stoner humor is still fun especially since many of us are now in our sixties and still enjoying the high life.  Add this to your cd collection, play it on a Friday night and roll up a fat one for the old times! Or plug in your vaporizer....whatever.",1386460800,,743,4.330935251798561

I can't believe what a disappointment this discs ended up. There was almost no continuity of the routines. It was a jumbled mess. I did give it 3 stars because it was nice to see the old routines converted to a visual media.

5566930,5,B00BATGDCO,Loved it funny as the originals....great deal as well. Laughed smoked and went to sleep awesomely fumny we'll that's it,1373846400,,119,5.0
5566931,5,B00BATGDCO,Theres nothing new here other than the animation but they do use a good mix of stuff from their albums,1372204800,,102,4.15
5566932,3,B00BATGDCO,This animated movie reminded me of the old bits on Cheech and Chongs  vinyl albums. Funny wick sick and crude and fruitful humor.,1372118400,,129,4.608695652173913
5566933,2,B00BATGDCO,"I, like many others, have waited years for this to finally get released. However, I was expecting it would be the classic sketches the duo did on the CD's, but surprisingly it seems like it was re-recorded old material, but they left the really good bits out, or used sketches that where not their best material. For god sakes, it's 2013, quit trying to make movies that won't offend or can be watched by small teens. Most of this almost seemed PG rated, if dope was a family thing to watch.

We already have had the best sketch by Cheech and Chong in their first movie Up In Smoke. We got a slightly re-worked version in Hey Watch This, and of coarse their has always been the album recorded version. Yet half of it has been cut out and watered down for the cartoon version. Why? If shows like South Park or Drawn Together can push every boundary of what is seen in cartoons on TV, then why not just go all the way for a straight to home video release? It really felt like so much of the material on this cartoon movie was holding back, and not reaching the potential it could have had.

It is good to HEAR Cheech & Chong after all these years, but this cartoon movie that has taken so long to get released just did not come anywhere near as funny as I expected it to be. Heck, it's probably only one step up on Corsican Brothers, so I'd rather watch just about any other C&C video over this.

It's not to say it's all bad, it had a few good moments. But some things like Ralph & Herby work much better as two dudes on stage, rather than actually being dog characters. Then their a few background things that just make you wonder why they bothered, and just about every sketch worked better on the albums or movies then it did as a visual cartoon.",1372118400,3,1748,4.243243243243243
5566934,3,B00BATGDCO,"it's classic bits from their albums back in the day, get backed, kick back, and enjoy...do not watch alone! its meant to be shared just like backing goods and chocolate, and munchies.....",1372032000,,187,4.875

5566951,3,B00BATGDCO,"Let me start by saying I'm a pretty big Cheech & Chong fan. Not the the kind to go out of my way to see them live, but as big as a non concertgoer can be. This film just left me a little cold. It was fun hearing the old skits again. There were a few that actually elicited a giggle (the drive-in & Alice Bowie, for example), but otherwise I found myself saying ""Wtf?!"" a  lot. Not their best effort, in my opinion.",1369180800,,414,3.9285714285714284
5566952,1,B00BATGDCO,This is a totally adolescent (or younger) endeavor. The comedy lines were stale or totally out of touch with any adult audience. I should have known that capturing the 'magic' from over 50 years ago was not going to happen.,1369094400,,223,4.6
5566953,4,B00BATGDCO,New Cheech & Chong - nuff said! Though the animations a but rough & it would REALLY be nice to hear some more new material from the dynamic duo it's a pretty amusing movie non the less!,1368921600,2,185,4.027027027027027
5566954,2,B00BATGDCO,"This is so sad and stale. They only thing new is the body lice. The animation was cheap and the bits were all old. They simply played bits off 40 year old records and added bad animation. Now if I had never listened to these bits until my 8-track wore out, I would certainly think they were funny. But when I know every word before they speak it...that simply makes it hard to enjoy.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs. Some animated nudity and sex. Plenty of innuendos.",1368403200,,463,4.383720930232558
