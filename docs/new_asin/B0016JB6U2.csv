3157093,3,B0016JB6U2,Amy Bento is a great instuctor but kickbox is not her strength. I really like her HiLo and her strength is pretty good but her KB does not flow well. Amy moes too fast and without control. Control is a big part of what makes kickbox tough and effective. Just wasn't wowed by this one.,1215993600,3,284,4.181818181818182
3157094,4,B0016JB6U2,"Good kickboxing workout.  This one falls into the advanced category, I'd say.  Amy makes a few mistakes (repeatedly calling upper cuts 'hook punches'), but other than that, I enjoyed it.  During the medicine ball segments (they do some odd exercises here), I just improvise and do my own set of strength training exercises (usually with a kettlebell).  I'd gladly buy more of Amy's workouts!!",1215129600,5,392,5.078125
3157095,3,B0016JB6U2,"I own almost all of Amy's workouts. I find her very cool and love her personality. But I'm not sure about this one yet. I wanted to like it, but some of the moves just don't flow where I found myself improvising with memorized Cathe stuff. The music is not too motivating either and when it was about half through I felt a bit bored wanting it to be over. I was looking forward to the med ball intervals, but didn't like them all that much either. I will give it another shot, but I'm rating it only 3 stars. Not that bad, but not great either.",1209945600,10,544,4.093457943925234

8262690,2,B0016JB6U2,"I do have one of Amy's other dvds-Kickbox Extreme, so I was aware of the learning curve as far as the choreography goes.  I'm pretty coordinated when it comes to that, plus it keeps me from getting bored, so I was up for the challenge, despite many negative reviews.  I did okay through the warm up and first routine.  Then came the second round:  What a Mess!  No instruction, no cues, Amy just started punching and did some turn and crescent kick.  I tried it a few times, but #1 her timing is off and #2 I don't have enough room to do these moves!  I turned it off and switched over to Susan Chungs' Rapid Fire Sweat.
I may try this again after watching it through when I have some time.  But I can totally see why this got some bad reviews.  Amy needs to work on choreography that makes some sense rather than these moves that she seems to make up on the fly.",1480636800,,863,4.150602409638554
8262691,1,B0016JB6U2,"What a waste of time!!  Amy Bento does absolutely no instruction in this video.  She gives a few verbal cues before a new routine, the jargon of which will mean nothing to most people, even to someone who is an advanced exerciser.  She does not teach the moves at all.  She doesn't even do them slowly the first or second time.  Plus, the choreography is way more complex than is needed to achieve good fitness goals and to keep from being bored.  I found myself rewinding the dvd over and over and over.  I think I spent more time rewinding than working out!!  Who has that kind of time to waste?  Really!  All Amy had to do was include a slow preview of her moves, and lessen the complexity a little in the coreography, to have a really terrific workout.  I totally regret buying this dvd and am going to trash it.  The frustration level is just too high and not worth it!!",1468108800,,875,4.300613496932515
8262692,4,B0016JB6U2,The DVD is great but the case was broken when it arrived. Otherwise I would have given it a 5 stars.,1442275200,,100,3.8095238095238093
8262693,5,B0016JB6U2,"This is going to be another one of my favorite dvds.  I really enjoy kickboxing and like Amy Bento as an instructor.  Some of the moves can be a bit complex, but I think Amy does a great job of gradually building on them, so even someone as clumsy as me manages to keep up (most of the time).",1435017600,,292,3.9322033898305087
8262694,3,B0016JB6U2,Good workout.  Helps with shrinking the waist but no long term results for me.,1419897600,,78,4.571428571428571
8262695,3,B0016JB6U2,"I wasn't that impressed with this kickboxing workout. The workout was just okay, and sometimes a little hard to follow. I don't really like Amy as an instructor; she's kind of annoying and doesn't explain things well, which might make you become lost in the routine.",1327795200,2,266,4.804347826086956
8262696,5,B0016JB6U2,Fun kickboxing workout.  The medicine ball intervals are a great challenge.  I really like the music to the workout also.  The workout is intermediate to advanced level.  It took me a few times to get the moves but once I got them the workout was a blast!,1298678400,,255,4.361702127659575
8262697,5,B0016JB6U2,"I love Amy Bento workouts.  This one does not disappoint.  In The Ring consists of 4 cardio kickboxing routines, with medicine ball intervals following each routine.

Amy's truly shines at choreography and music choice.  I own all of Amy's DVDs and have yet to see her use the same move or the same song in any of them.  Most other instructors, like Cathe Friedrich and Tracey Staehle, tend to have favorite moves that show up in a lot of their DVDs.

What I loved about this DVD:

**I get a great workout with low impact.  I don't know what it is about the moves that Amy puts together, but I always feel worked out after doing them.

**the music by BJ Howe.  Even though the songs aren't top 40 hits, they are catchy and have a good, driving beat.

**Amy's engaging personality.  She is genuinely enjoying herself and I feel like I'm in a live class with her.

**the interesting choreography.  I like complex choreography since it makes me think and saves me from boredom if I frequently do the DVD.

**several premixes for when you're want a good workout, but don't have time to do the full workout.

What was a little confusing about this DVD:

**the 4th routine was rather complex and long.  I found myself focusing so much on trying to get the moves down, that my heart rate wasn't very high.  I think if I did this DVD more often, I'd have the move down and could focus more on working hard.

Please note that this DVD is for advanced exercisers.  Amy doesn't talk too much about form, nor does she show a lot of modifications. You really need to know your body and your limitations.

Amy doesn't give a lot of breakdown of the moves and since her moves are pretty unique, it may take a while to pick them up.  She also tends to cue at the same time she starts a move, which can be confusing for some.

These characteristics are great for me since I'm an advanced exerciser and have no patience with modifications or long explanations of moves.",1277942400,3,1951,4.400560224089636
8262698,5,B0016JB6U2,"I love this workout and keep it in rotation at least once a week. However, Amy's routines are not for anyone who has little imagination or the time to take the effort to learn something different and take on a challenge. The payoff is exhilerating. I also like the ""Hi Lo Knockout"" workout, which is similar in length, but more aerobic. She is probably the most diverse instructor out there these days; her videos never looked rushed or prosaic. I look forward to all her new ideas.",1232928000,,482,4.551724137931035
8262699,5,B0016JB6U2,"I have all of Amy's cardio workouts, and this is one of my favorites!  It's definitely a more high-intermediate/advanced workout, but you can certainly modify many of the moves.

As with most of Amy's workouts, there is not a lot of breakdown of the moves, so it took me a few times to get each segment of the workout down pat.  Now that I know it, I appreciate the fact that the workout moves quickly, without a lot of stopping to break it down.  When you're learning it, you might have to be patient and use your rewind button a bit.

The music is great, the kick boxing moves are fun, and Amy's great personality shines through!",1227052800,2,631,4.358974358974359
