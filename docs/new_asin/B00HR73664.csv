8634733,5,B00HR73664,"We enjoyed this film as it's more than just kid humor/happily ever after.
Story line is creative.
It's not rated G for a reason and probably the reason why adults can sit through it and again, enjoy it.
Our friends kids 4,7,9 and 12 loved it and asked us to play it again for them.
Proof that it's a hit!",1413072000,,304,4.083333333333333
8634734,1,B00HR73664,"Awful, not fit for children. ""You're a piece of sh...eep."" ""Shut up"" ""stupid"" and even more.",1412640000,,92,4.8125
8634735,5,B00HR73664,I love this movie. My grand daughter just turned 3 years old and we watch it together. No magic which is nice. We even play characters in the movie and go to the make believe space ship in the backyard. I would recommend this movie,1411084800,,231,4.155555555555556
8634736,1,B00HR73664,"Quite possibly one of the worst animated movies we have seen. The ill-conceived plot reinforces racial stereotypes, sexism, and vulgarity. The animation and voice-overs are half-hearted, consistent with the movie itself.

If you can, put this 'Pup' in the doghouse.",1409270400,,265,5.625
8634737,4,B00HR73664,My 4 year old granddaughter loves this movie. It's her rating. Why not 5 stars? Who knows? She has different opinions on different days.,1402531200,,136,4.708333333333333
8634738,2,B00HR73664,cheesy plot and animation is ok- corny. I wouldn't rent it again and don't even think about wasting your money buying it. My 3 year old wasn't impressed either.,1400112000,,160,4.551724137931035
8634739,1,B00HR73664,"Watching with 4 year old and 9 year old.  It's PG for good reason.  Just hear ""the d word"" as it D@#^ IT"".  The animals are ""boyfriend/girlfriend"", kissing, obsessed with their appearances...  It's complete trash.",1393718400,4,213,5.0
