8556857,5,B0068MULM6,I must say I am impressed with this new version of the L-Word. I came across it on my mom's IPad that I gave her for christmas. The women are so gorgeous! I'm so glad there is another Lesbian T.v. drama series. I'm a lesbian so it's nice to watch a t.v. series that i can relate to. I hope that they keep making more series if not I will be very disappointed. Of course if they stop I could understand since Homosexuality is very controversial these days. I love the real emotions and stories I feel like I'm one of the characters in the series. I'm offically addicted!!,1361059200,,570,4.238532110091743
8556858,5,B0068MULM6,"I adore this show. Definitely worth viewing. Best to buy the box-set of both Series 1 & Series 2 together through Amazon. It's a much better bargain. Both Series for the price of one. Enjoy.
Since the DVD's are region 2 format. You will need a multi-region DVD player or if you have a Mac computer, set iDVD to region 2 format viewing. Hope this helps.",1345766400,3,352,4.348484848484849
