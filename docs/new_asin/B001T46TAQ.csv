3788009,3,B001T46TAQ,"With a Sci Fi Saturday night slant, this movie isn't that bad. Keep an open mind and just watch the movie without expecting much. The acting and effects are lacking but for what they were working with it was worth a look.

Again I ask why can't Asylum make movies like this???",1242086400,2,276,4.3076923076923075
3788010,1,B001T46TAQ,A not very convincing story line. Acting fair to good.  I rented this movie out of curiosity. A group of survivors trying to avoid Christian assassins armed with cross shaped daggers who were slaughtering everyone they can find to save them from the demons which are supposed to take over the world so the slaughtered  can go to heaven. Then just before midnight when demons were about to emerge the nut cases gave each other poison pills (they will go to hell if they commit suicide according to the Christian bible). Obviously these people trying to escape the murderers hadn't watched to many horror movies and split up instead of sticking together and got killed one at a time except... I don't want to spoil the ending so go watch it--Its definitely scary. Some scenes were confusing.,1241827200,,789,4.751824817518248
3788011,4,B001T46TAQ,"About an ""end of days"" cult of hundreds of religious zealots ordered by their Pastor (via a mass distribution cell phone message) to go out and kill as many innocent humans as possible so that their victims' souls can be saved and sent to God before a predicted on-slaught of demons take possession of the world. Mostly takes place on a sub-way and in an underground sub-way tunnel. It's very philosophical. The ending leaves it up to you to believe what you want.  The movie is kinda light on actual demon sightings.  But there's plenty of knife weilding everyday Christian's (including little kids, old ladies, etc.) for any horror fan.  Lot's of gruesome stabbings.",1236729600,11,668,4.842105263157895
3788012,4,B001T46TAQ,"Karen (Ilona Elkin) is a psychiatric nurse working at a what appears to be a Catholic run health care facility. She is troubled by bad dreams and weird patients. She takes a shower that shows off a large shoulder scar that has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the film (it had me guessing). While commuting late one night on the subway, Karen, and group of commuters encounter a doomsday religious cult that look more like Brownshirts. They kill with knives in the shape of a crucifix, and do not believe in guns. (How do they conquer the world again?) As our group runs, hides, and fight back, the film takes on the feel of a zombie movie with the religious followers in the role of the zombie. (I won't cross that metaphor line, I promise.)

The red eyed creatures on the cover don't show until late, I mean ""Quarantine"" cover late. Like the very end of the film when it starts to get interesting. Well produced and written film. 3 1/2 stars

F-bombs, no sex, no nudity, minor groping, another use for duct tape in case of terrorist attack.

The way we sequel this film is that we make the creatures into aliens and this is part of an alien invasion. Karen has a shoulder scar where the aliens had placed an implant in her...but was removed by humans when she had a lake/drowning accident. We then go into a mind control humans vs. the rest of us with an elite force which includes eye candy attempting to knock out the enemy control station located in the desert or somewhere else low budget to shoot a film. They have to battle humans carrying knives while attempting to locate and destroy the base...and we can add some low budget internal conflict, Casper Van Dien, and Sophia Monk.",1337558400,3,1697,4.485436893203883
3788013,4,B001T46TAQ,"Every review has it's origins & I really should give a shout out to the Queen of Bflix for this low budget goodness. Had it not been for her, I dunno how quickly I would've come across Devereaux's latest but am very grateful to her for introducing what may be my new favorite film (or at least hot cult item) this summer.  I would also like to extend a serious round of applause to Trashie and Woo for giving this film it's due praise as well as writing entertaining, thought-provoking reviews which commanded my undivided attention. Believe me when I say all three had a huge influence on my recent purchase & the review I'm about to unleash.

For some reason, I usually find films like this somewhat offensive or a tad too campy when they try to satirize religious zealots or cult members. Much like the commonly-known sub genre we call torture porn nowadays, there should be( if there isn't already) a separate genre for religious horror films. Although the category may a bit too broad & could probably use rightful clarification, there are a whole slew of films that come to mind when I think of frightening dramas which hold these elements. We should be so fortunate if we've all had the chance to explore some of the better titles however such as Bill Paxton's Frailty or Devereaux's End Of The Line.

Let it be known that I'm not a follower of any specific, organized religions at the present & nor do I subscribe to the hypocrisy that most of them cling to like prized possessions. However, I was raised in a Protestant household with adults who truly embraced this faith with all their hearts & proved that living a good life is the ultimate example of a great sermon. Rather than preaching from the pulpit to strangers, they lived a life of doing good & avoiding the trappings of harming their fellow man. It's an honest-to-God blessing if one can confidently state they are here to honor, worship, & live for the glory of a higher power while doing good for the sake of your fellow man.

Sadly, I'm riding the fence when it comes to the spiritual matters of the heart although I clearly identify how certain beliefs are inevitably associated with utter horror throughout the course of history. Perhaps no other religion has been associated with bloodshed more than the Christian faith which can be held responsible for some of the worst tragedies known to mankind & this tradition doesn't seem to ever completely cease unfortunately. It doesn't surprise nor completely shock me anymore to see films like this which capitalize on brutal murders committed by these frightening homicidal maniacs intend on doing the work of their God.

On the same token, I think I should also set the record straight here. These cult members or religious zealots are, in fact, homicidal murderers irregardless of their reasoning or unjustly suspicions. According to the Christian doctrine, man shall not kill. The lord sayeth vengeance is mine although I'm not going to give you the Samuel Jackson monologue here. In light of that, there is no passage in any version of the Christian Bible that I've ever read which elucidates that killing your fellow man will save their souls from eternal damnation. Thus, anyone who misinterprets the word of God & tries to use The Bible as a means to torture or kill is clearly a maniac in every sense of the word no matter what he/she calls themselves.

Devereaux's horror film angers me & shocks although I do think a lot of the film. It provokes me in a way that most horror films do not which I find most impressive. I do tip my hat to the man for his innovative concepts & the near flawless execution of a grounded story which unfolds within 90 some odd minutes. It's breath-taking, graphic, & suspenseful which are key elements that most  horror films these days seem to lack. Modern horror film directors could do themselves a huge favor & take notes as this is a prime example of horror done correct. That's not to say that Devereaux doesn't have a wicked sense of humor when dealing with such dark subject matter. He clearly does.

The film centers on a group of young people boarding a subway train late at nite who have to fend for their lives after the train suddenly stops. Throughout the film, they are attacked by a mob of religious cult members who are determined to save souls for God by killing off the innocents, the doubters, & the unclean. Each member of this cult is ordered by means of a pager device to kill as many people as possible before the predicted onslaught of demons manage to overtake the Earth. As anyone could easily guess, it's going to a long night indeed & there's a great chance that no one is getting out of this subway tunnel alive.

If I have one small complaint other than being a tad bit put-off by the storyline, I would have to say the the acting is uneven at best. I found myself shivering in between the laughs although I don't think some of his material was meant to be laugh-inducing necessary. Somehow, I can't see anyone being truly joyful after seeing innocent people being hacked or stabbed to death even in the modern horror films. Having said that, the performances range here from being campy to over-the-top with very little middle ground. Perhaps the most funny, yet deeply disturbing montage was none other than seeing the nut bag televangelist preach about saving souls while holding a bloodied crucifix dagger.

Perhaps even more unsettling in my honest opinion are the dream sequences in the opening montage which foretell of the dark events that will occur strikes me as most disturbing. Although many would simply overlook their dreams or nightmares as just envisions of paranoia, I have always been one to recognize them as oracles if you will. Whereas the suspicions of a near future Armageddon are obviously eerie for the most part, I can deal with that so much easier than a dark premonition. Unfortunately, some of the religious fundamentalism is a bit heavy handed at times although this doesn't hamper a great storyline.  I somehow get the impression that it's all played up for a major laugh in the grand scheme of things.

Without question, End Of The Line is a great film for any real horror fan & I can't possibly imagine anyone feeling the least cheated in the gore department.  As for fans of more polished horror flicks which are CG heavy, you may fair better by avoiding this one.  Unpleasant dreams, my friends.",1309132800,,6423,4.672566371681416
3788014,4,B001T46TAQ,"It's finally happened! The apocalypse has come, and the righteous few have only a short time to save the lost. Thankfully, they have their trusty crucifix-knives ready for stabbing their targets into eternal salvation! END OF THE LINE takes religious fanaticism / cultism to new heights (depths?) by playing out the ""end times"" in a subway system. We are there as a small group of sinners tries to stay one step ahead of those who wish to express their kindness through grisly murder (aka: God's love)! I enjoyed the idea of the TV preacher contacting his flock through pagers, turning them into lethal assassins for the Lord! Also, the ""demons' are well-done and not over-used. Worth owning...",1289347200,,694,4.94017094017094
3788015,4,B001T46TAQ,"WE have seen numerous cults and extremists lay waste to countless thousands of lives.  From the small cults that set them self afire, David koresh at waco, (the tapes prove this) to a large scale radicalized Death worshiping branch of Islam that led in one way or another to numerous wars and the persecution of other religions in countries like  Iran, or course we have the outright cultists like The moonies , scientologists and others.  This movie shows how a group of decent people can become violent and destructive in the name of religion.  It's message isn't anti religion at all in fact few mainstream religious people of any faith would follow the commands to slaughter people. Instead it uses the very real problem of cultists who are driven to try to bring about the end of the world.
This is not a slur on mainstream christianity at all.  The movie concerns a group of people trying to fight their way out of the subways while everywhere the cultists are killing people because they believe they are setting them free from a army of demons coming.  Are the demons real? Or is it in the minds of people who believe in this? Just because we see demons doesn't mean that they are there and no one else seems to notice that only people who have listened to the cultist churches message seems to see them! And that includes the main character of the Nurse who is having problems dealing with the death of a cultist.  In fact this leaves it open to the viewer , is this just these people seeing the demons or is the end of the world really happening? You must  decide for yourself and that's what the director wanted you to do when watching this movie.  Either way it's like this if you believe in something then you shouldn't have to pick up a weapon to make it happen.  Wether that's the return of the 13th iman (Iranian shiites believe they must destroy the world to make this happen and they want a nuclear bomb!) , or wether it's to cause the end of the world or make the rapture happen,  these things will happen without any help from man if they are intended to happen.  You see this director put alot of thought into this little horror flick.  However I do think that a movie on radical islam would also be a good topic for him to delve into.  And I can understand how some christians can be offended by this but few of them are members of a cult. If Pat Robertson; who says Haiti made a pact with Satan (this didn't happen); so that's why the earthquake killed 150,000 people,  told his followers to kill people few would do it.
It takes a real cult to do that.  Or those who embrace something like radicalized Islam for example.  So sit back and enjoy this disturbing movie and pray we don't lose more people  to the next cult or jihadist madman.

3788017,1,B001T46TAQ,"This movie has no redeeming quality about it. I'm not a religious person, but was offended at how they used a religion to write a plot... and a horrible one at that.

I can sum up how horribly offending this movie is with the scene that made me eject the disc. In the name of God, a pregnant woman volunteers to get stabbed to death in her stomach. The next scene is her and her husband dead and bloody with the unborn dead bloody fetus put on top.

Even if not offensive, the movie has some of the worst acting I've ever seen (and I've seen some bad movies) and a plot that goes nowhere.",1252972800,2,588,4.104347826086957
3788018,4,B001T46TAQ,"...considering it started out so badly for me.  Some cheap scares at the beginning, cheap/sparse looking sets(especially the train compartments), the over-sexed young couple cliche, religious nuts on the loose plot-line, etc.  All this conspired against the movie and made me want to shut it off early on, but i couldn't cause it was a rental and my gf wanted to see it through.

And i'm glad i did.  Cause somewhere along the way, as the survivors gathered together and united against the zealots, i actually began to care or like them.  This is very rare in horror films for me cause usually i find characters in horror films tend to be annoying to the point where i just end up rooting for the killer or monster to dispose of them in a gory fashion.  Or, i only see them as a means to further the plot or action.  Or, i usually care for only the lead performer(s).

Not so with this low-budget gem.  I actually wanted to see most, if not all of them, make it through.  I wanted that Asian chick to get here revenge on her attacker, the 'over-sexed' young couple mentioned earlier to escape their predicament, the two railway workers, the two leads, the tough guy trying to lead the group...i wanted, or wouldn't have mind, if most of the people survived this film and was glued to the screen to see who would and how.  Bad news, not all of them make it.  But i'll let you watch it to see who makes it and who doesn't.

I can't persuade you to watch this movie cause of the scenery, action, or effects(although it is rather bloody) since it's a low budget horror.  But it does have some nice atmosphere, chills, and creepiness-factor that some horror films today severely lack.  And it has something most horror films today don't have- a group of people you may actually like, care about, identify with, or root for.

Btw, the dvd had a few extras but i had to return the rental disc before i could access them.  I really would have liked to check out the commentary though to see what went through the director's mind when putting this film together.  Worth a watch and definitely recommended as a rental.",1250812800,5,2108,4.473821989528796
3788019,5,B001T46TAQ,"One of the biggest real fears that I am exposed to on a regular basis is a knock on the front door...

>>>""Hello sir, have you accepted Jesus Christ as your savior?""<<<

Not that I'm afraid to discuss my faith.  But there are so many self-righteous, hypocritical (not to mention creepy) religous zealots trying to push their opinions on other people that it becomes annoying and completely pointless to try to discuss anything with them.

Throw in a dimly lit subway, a deranged blood-thirsty cult, loads of gore, demons from hell, and a foreboding threat of the apocalypse and you have END OF THE LINE.  This really is one of the most unique and chilling low budget horror films EVER to grace the screen.

It's like a combo of these films:
-Dawn of the Dead
-The Wicker Man
-Midnight Meat Train
-Frailty
-Who Can Kill A Child
-Maniac
-High Tension

3788020,3,B001T46TAQ,"Remember that creepy subway scene in Cloverfield?  Well, imagine if someone took the essentials of that scene and extended it to an entire movie then added a dash of insane religious zealotry (amplified to a borderline ridiculous amount).  That's End of the Line.

Karen (Ilona Elkin) is a nurse in a psych ward who not only had a former patient just lose in a game of tag with a subway train, but she's also experiencing demonic hallucinations.  The question, ""Who polices the police?"" is a good one, but, ""Who psychoanalyzes the psychoanalysts?"" is just as scary.  Naturally, she takes the subway home the very same night as the death and her near breakdown.  Good call.  When several of the train's other occupants - nearly all dressed in stuffy, khaki outfits - receive a simultaneous text message, there is a sudden switch in their demeanor, and they begin to attack other passengers.

What follows is a group effort similar to Romero's Dawn of the Dead, and others in the zombie genre, as the good guys attempt run and fight against the khaki Christians who are wielding knives and broadswords.  Led by alpha male Neil (Neil Napier) and a feisty Asian chick named Julie (Emily Shelton), the group grows to six as they pick up young lovers Sarah (Nina Fillis) and John (Tim Rozon).

The clichs of the horror genre are all followed (i.e. the group splits up); the gore is great, with stabbings, slashings, and one beheading; and there are several worthwhile shock scenes.  On the horror production efforts alone, this movie is very good.  Conversely...

This could have been just as creepy without the religious fanatic angle.  When those few persuaded by their own insanity and a warped view of the actual purposes and messages of religion actually do something psychotic (in the scope of contemporary religion, not the Crusades), it's usually more of a cult, and it's in the tens, maybe hundreds, not the thousands necessary for the chaos purported by the events of this film.  And it's definitely not done by zealots spouting religious jingles that only the religiously uninformed would perpetually regurgitate. When the villains are dressed up as pseudo-Nazis, and the supposed attacks are mindless, incomplete, and world-wide, the comparisons appear more like a hackneyed religious attack than an attempt to create actual scares.  Stick to horror movies, and leave the perverse political perspectives elsewhere.

If you can get past the political brow-beating, the horror is done fairly well.  Recommended for the hard core horror fan and the fanatic atheist.",1247961600,3,2568,5.0165094339622645
3788021,4,B001T46TAQ,"We have all seen the news, about certain religious people who have suddenly exhibited violent behavior towards others and even towards themselves. Such news often give me the shivers when supposed decent people become driven to exhibit brutal behavior in what they believe is the way to their salvation. Writer/director Maurice Devereaux's ""End of the Line"" explores such behavior in a very efficient manner; all the while feeding our fears of the presence of evil. The film is a creepy, scary, thought-provoking look at what believers may say is eve of the end times. Just what do you do if and when your religious leader gives you an order?

Karen (Ilona Elkin) is a nurse in a hospital's psychiatric ward. One evening, Karen takes the subway train on her way home from work. Without warning, the train stops to a grinding halt and Karen with the rest of the other passengers become the trapped targets of an apocalyptic religious cult led by Reverend Hope (played by David McCallum) bent on killing them all in the name of their strange god. Karen and the other passengers fight back, but can their feeble resistance stand up to the demonic powers that have cast a shadow this evening? Things look very bleak and all hope is about to be extinguished as the entire world seemed to have been gripped by madness. Is this truly the end of the line for humanity?

Maurice Devereaux's very dark and bloody tale may have a very simple premise but he manages to call upon the screenplay's best assets to keep the viewer interested with an intense, taut and gripping script that is well thought out and executed. We see the passengers in the subway train; people from all walks of life on the way to retiring for the evening and this proves to be the film's minor characterization. Once Devereaux, manages to set things up, the direction goes into overdrive with a bloody, unrelenting experience that kept me enthralled for the film's entirety.

Now, don't' think that the film is just a simple bloodbath. The film addresses certain themes of blind faith and references certain themes from the Book of Revelation itself. The film's central focus are the followers of this religious cult who has been obviously misled, they use their blades fashioned from a cross to strike down any unbelievers so that they may know salvation. I said that the film references certain ideas from the Bible but I never said that this is a film based on Biblical apocalypse. Devereaux pitches an idea that a false prophet would rise first to pave the way for evil and I believe in this, since the devil would never come to greet you as himself but as a messiah. What is truly sad is when even children are driven to such extreme behavior. The cultists are also willing to kill others but they refuse to commit suicide. The screenplay calls upon an effective twist that involves this cult and the raising of hell's army. After all, what better soldiers can be than those so devout to a cause?

Amid all its darkness and chaos, the direction admirably remembers to show a sense of humanity to our protagonist and even to the some members of this cult. The cult members are shown as having a choice when it came to the execution of their ""duty""--Sarah (Nina Fillis) and Frankie (John Vamvas) had their orders but they chose not to follow. They are prime examples in believing on what feels right to their heart and never in the teachings of their so-called religion. One of Rev. Hope's lieutenants is torn between his needs of the flesh and the need to make certain that he is `saved'. Two aspects of human trait/behavior is nicely fleshed out; choice and a need to be assured. Mike (Nicolas Wright) and Karen embody the openness to compassion, with the little time they shared, they got to know each other a lot. Sarah and her boyfriend somehow embody the idea that love can be shared between two people with differing beliefs, so long as their hearts are in the right place at the time. Sex is seen as a sin by the cultists, while some believe that it is the expression of love.

The film is also a bloodbath and there are quite a good number of scenes that are very graphic. The brutality and violence in the film may not be too hardcore--stabs, hammer strikes, extreme realistic violence are practiced by both the cultists and our protagonists. The violence may be graphic but none so stomach-turning and over-the-top. They all have that realistic simple feel, when terrified people tangle with madmen. However, the film does have a scene that is very unsettling which occurs in the maintenance area when an unborn infant is ripped apart from his mother's womb. Blood and Gore is omnipresent in the proceedings, and director Devereaux cleverly utilizes old-school effects in the form of prosthetics and red ink. I do not like CGI in my horror movies and I commend the direction`s sense in this case. Even the demonic entities who appear in the film are a product of a lot of muddy make up and simple prosthetics with glowing red eyes. One flaw that I can say about the film is the fact that the acting felt a little too uneven. Some of the acting by the cult members feel a little too fake and some scenes a little bit heavy-handed. Another is that the dialogue felt a little too contrived and obligatory at times. Not that they were enough to ruin the film, but it was enough to be noticed.

""End of the Line"" is one very creepy and disquieting film. It portrays certain aspects of very real horror in the form of decent citizens driven to madness due to their own blind faith all the while using the occult and the supernatural as its driving force. It did somewhat remind me of ""Prince of Darkness"" but this film is much more. Maurice Devereaux knew exactly what he wanted to do with this film; the film managed to maintain its forward momentum that maintained its energy and outright creepiness--what also proves effective is the fact that he manages to put everything together with a large exclamation point that leads to the apocalypse.

When you feel a nudge on your shoulder to do something...do you follow because of what you know or what you believe? It's something to think about...

3788027,5,B001T46TAQ,"Say hello to your new folk hero, fellow horror fanatics.  Low budget Canadian writer, director, producer Maurice Devereaux has outdone himself.  His last film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Slashers/dp/B00140PKDC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Slashers</a>&nbsp;was among the most murderously entertaining horror films I'd seen in years and it' took him 5 years to finally get the backing to follow it up. How sad is that? Well, not only does ""End of the Line"" not disappoint, it blows away the competition.  Devereaux has positioned himself to be the next George Romero with his brutal and satirical horror chops and talent for working outside of the system.  There's a special feature where he explains why he refuses to answer questions about the film's budget due to distribution negotiations.  That is to say that it is so small for a film of this quality that it would leave the Hollywood types dumbfounded and (hopefully) embarrassed with themselves.  This is the best horror film to be released in America this year so far and the fact that it took 3 years to get released here and didn't even get a theatrical run makes we want to punch somebody.  This is not to be missed.

At first, ""End of the Line"" felt like it was going to be a bit like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Midnight-Meat-Train/dp/B001MFNB4O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Midnight Meat Train</a>, which was another great horror flick that got ridiculously ignored in favor of the same old Hollywood garbage.  But when the story takes it's big turn then I can say that this one is not only different, but superior.  If there's one theme that I find irresistable, it has to be the apocalypse.  I don't care if it's zombies, nuclear bombs, giant naked anime girls, or armies of demons battling angels I am obsessed with the end of the world.  Well, how about death by religious fanatics? Imagine if every Christian on the planet went homicidal in the name of their God at the exact same moment. Timely, stylish, socially relevant, and scary as all hell.  Apparently I'm not the only one who's noticed just how creepy the entire setup of organized religion is.  But you know what's even scarier: what if the maniacs are right?  Yes, this will do just fine.  Once again, Canadian horror shows us how it's done.

The cast in this does an amazing job top to bottom.  Whether it's the spot-on impression of the everpresent double-chinned pastor, the classic middle-aged fanatical woman, or the repressed misogynistic scumbag the villains of this piece are both recognizable as our neighbors and as freaky as they come.  The protagonists are a likable and imperfect bunch who behave very much the way most of us would under the circumstances.  It's pleasing to watch a film like this and not be yelling at the screen or rolling my eyes at the constant stupidity of the people I'm supposed to want to survive but end up only wishing for their prompt death.  Also, this film is BRUTAL!  Not only in it's commentary, but visually the gore is awesome.  You know a movie is working when you regret the deaths of some of the killers.  There's one shot that literally made me gasp it was so completely and horribly disturbing to me.  This is not PG-13 and it's not even R.  This is a film that is legitimately unrated for a reason.  They probably could have gotten a hard R with exactly one less shot in the film, but I heartily applaud the people behind this film for not compromising.  This is what I like to call ""the real deal"".

The DVD release features a very entertaining deleted scene, commentary, a very good 30-minute ""making-of"" feature, and a few more odds and ends for a complete package.  There is no reason not to buy this movie if you are looking for a great survival horror film.  Being hunted in the subway by ""normal"" people may not be the the way I want to experience the End of Days, but watching others live (and die) that way was a mighty good time. Let's do our duty and support this stuff.  This is the kind of film I personally want to watch and the fact is that these films almost never get made inside of the Hollywood system because the monkey-suited fatcats think the films won't make money and they can't be bothered to promote them.  I for one wish to prove them wrong.  More often the not, lower budget = higher creativity and I'd personally rather see a superior story crafted by somebody who cares about what he's doing then sit through another big-budget explosion-fest poorly directed by some Hollywood hack.  But that's just me.  I do have a question to ask of some of the better horror filmmakers of the last decade before I go.  What is it with Asian girls throwing themselves in front of trains?",1245974400,4,4784,4.868974042027194
3788028,5,B001T46TAQ,"Well... it is amazing how a great idea and a carefully developed screenplay makes all the difference. END OF THE LINE could have been just another boring imitation of a formula (the kind of thing we see in 90% of all the straight-to-DVD movies we see today).

But this film succeeds on being much more.

Mr. Devereaux is another example of someone who really knows what it takes in order to make a serious horror film. And his direction/screenplay/production do deliver the goods!

The story is very unusual: people everywhere start seeing demons and the world seems to have been taken over by a fanatic Christian sect. In that context, a group of people get stuck inside a subway train at the same moment the sect starts mass murdering. Between demons and fanatics, there seems to be no place in the world for normal people anymore...

The great thing about this film is that it is beautifully crafted. Music, cinematography, screenplay, makeup, everything is in place. Mr. Devereaux clearly knows the price of those things and their value. He uses everything intelligently.

That means the film actually looks much more expensive than what it cost and THAT fact alone is worth checking. I do not know how much this film cost... but whatever it did I'm sure it look it cost a lot more.

Being a low-budget, of course the film has some limitations... but the Director/Producer clearly knows how to avoid those budget traps that expose the such limitations. The tight story, situations, pace and makeup easily make up for any lesser element you may spot.

On a nutshell, this film pushes the limits of what you can do with a low budget EXACTLY BECAUSE of a careful development of the screenplay, shooting and post.

The critical/satirical take on religious fanaticism (in this case good old Christian fanaticism!) is both funny and disturbing. It looks like the fanatics are much more dangerous than the demons! (laughs)

I did not like the DVD cover and the art work, however. It looks too cheap. The film deserves better.

I give this film five stars because... I don't think you can ask for more here.
I recommend this film.",1245110400,2,2126,4.768392370572207
3788029,4,B001T46TAQ,"Maurice Devereaux strikes again! The writer/producer/director of the deliciously entertaining SLASHERS has finally found a distributor for his 2007 film END OF THE LINE and is this flick ever a doozy. It hits the ground running with a good and proper scare just to let us know that we're in for something special and believe me this flick is special. It has a completely original story that never takes you where you think you're going, an interesting assortment of characters who are more than just victims d'jour, a cast of very competent actors to inhabit those characters, plus a nice assortment of gory ways to kill them off. Oh yes, there will be blood.

I don't want to go into the story too much because its best to go into this movie cold. Our heroine is Karen,a psychiatric nurse at a hospital that has been receiving more than the usual number of loonies. Karen(Ilona Elkin) herself has been experiencing unnerving dreams and visions--centered around one of her patients who committed suicide by diving in front of a subway train. All of the film's action takes place in the subway, and it starts in earnest when Karen is accosted by a nasty looking trouble maker who clearly is up to no good. A good looking young man named Mike(Nicholas Wright) comes to her rescue and the die is cast. Within the next few hours these three characters along with a feisty hot Asian chick Emily Shelton), a pair of young lovers (Tim Rozon and and Nina Fillis), a couple of subway workers and a take charge guy named Neil (Neil Napier)will be fighting for their lives and maybe even their souls against--against what? Well, that would be telling and I want you to find out for yourself. There are all sorts of twists and turns and an ending that will either mystify you or tick you off. Watch it at least twice, but WATCH IT, its a roaring good time.

On second thought its really a 5 star flick but amazon won't let you change your ratings after the fact.",1243468800,2,1950,4.584527220630372
3788030,4,B001T46TAQ,"Just finished watching this little indie again, and I have to say that I enjoyed it more the 2nd time around.  I'll try to keep this short and sweet:

Synopsis

The film centers on a group of commuters that get stranded in an isolated subway network and are pursued by the members of a religious group trying to ""save"" them.  Unfortunately, this means taking a crucifix dagger to the back and/or chest as the members believe the end of the world has come and that the only way to protect the souls of the innocent is to send them straight to god themselves.

Thoughts

The atmosphere was dark and brooding
There were some really excellent gore sequences
The acting was believable
The demons were unique and creepy
I appreciated the commentary regarding the danger of religious fundamentalism and how blind faith and/or brainwashing can (and in the past have) lead to problems

My only major complaint was the limited appearances by the demons.  But after watching the film the 2nd time, I was glad that the on screen portrayal of the demons was limited as this would have undoubtedly reduced the impact of the ending

This movie would make a strong addition to any genre fans library

8/10

Enjoy

3788031,3,B001T46TAQ,"Religious zealots following the orders of a fanatical pastor to kill in order to save souls is not a new theme, but the presentation here is rather unique. While the city erupts in violence after the order to begin murdering the sinful citizenry, our story centers around a handful of passengers in the subway trying to outwit or outrun believers who have received the call (via cell phones) to carry out the murderous plot. There is plenty of blood, a bit of suspense, and the apperance of demons, who could have added to the film if they were written into more scenes. The characters have just enough depth for us to have more than a passing interest, and there are few moments of absolute stupidity that often burden horror films. There is an aura of dread and realism that does make the flick engrossing, though it suffers from a slow beginning and an ending that I did not find satisfying at all. However, the journey is an engrossing one as the pace picks up, and there is adequate balance between suspense, drama, and a supernatural element that keeps the viewer involved.",1243036800,3,1079,4.654450261780105
3788032,3,B001T46TAQ,"End of the Line (Maurice Devereaux, 2006)

Interesting, if flawed, little horror flick from Devereaux (Slashers). Psychiatric nurse Karen (Eternal's Ilona Andrews) is taking the subway home when it grinds to a halt in the middle of a tunnel. (This, I should note, is after the night has already gotten pretty ugly, in both the mundane and supernatural senses.) As if that's not bad enough, a local wingnut preacher has just decided that Armageddon is on the way, and has paged all his cult members (yes, paged!) to give them the good news... sending them all on a murderous rampage. Karen and a handful of others from the train who survived the initial onslaught, as well as a pair of lineworkers, have to try and make it through the night without getting killed by homicidal religious wackos. But in the back of their minds lurks the question... what if the preacher's right?

The film suffers from pacing problems at both ends (the setup tends to drag, while the end feels rushed, and the film's final frames are bound to leave the viewer unsatisfied), but once you're away from those, this is a very, very good flick that almost seems to be the spiritual father of a more recent horror movie that spends a lot of its time in subways. The characters are enjoyable, the direction is solid, the script never quite takes itself too seriously, and there are jumps aplenty. And that song the wingnuts keep singing, that's reprised in the end credits? That's just plain creepy. *** ",1242950400,2,1478,4.72093023255814
3788033,4,B001T46TAQ,"I was pleasantly surprised by End of the Line.  It's rather unheralded, but demonstrates professional production values and competancy greater than your typical low budget horror flick.  I'm somewhat surprised that this idea hasn't been used more in horror:  religious zealots killing folks.  Sounds familiar stated that way, but I haven't really seen it done on this scale before.  A few crazies here and there, sure, but this is a possibly global, well-oiled machine.  I was involved with the characters and plotting, and liked the varying levels of faith in certain characters.  The pacing bogs down somewhat in the middle, the demons are fairly cheesy, and personally, I could have done without the gratuitous fetus, but over all, I think End of the Line a solid, very watchable film.",1242604800,2,788,5.062015503875969

8340409,3,B001T46TAQ,"Religion and corporations are the cheap and lazy throw away plot drivers in far too much of the horror genre and this film is no exception. Truly disturbing at many levels but not in a good way.  There are creative ideas here and a lot was done with a clearly limited budget.  It's as if using harsh and potentially offensive themes could carry a film where 90% of the effects budget was saved for the last five minutes could work - it doesn't.  Ultimately this is not a film I want to see again but the broader ideas and acting carried a lot of it over the threshold from just offensive to at least a single view worthy product.  Some of the best acting was from the folks playing the armegeddonists and they were all puke characters. The whole ""Jim Jones brown shirt messianic angle"" was just a cheap dodge.  I'm not particularly religious just annoyed with people who have to stitch their own prejudices into a story line they can't fill with more original motivations.",1418601600,,972,4.5

8340412,4,B001T46TAQ,"Clunky in spots, but all the more charming for it, End of the Line is a creepy, smart, horror film that crept under my radar when it was first released. Will appeal to fans of The Church, and some of the more artful 80s-90s Italian / European efforts in horror cinema. The first third takes place aboard a subway train, making for a nice, claustrophobic vibe, and the story continues, though it never really leaves the underground, and this all makes for a cool, eerie sense of entrapment, as a band of energetic innocents are beseiged by a group of religious fanatics with a lust for blood salvation. Fits comfortably in the pantheon of classic, late 20th-century horror, and will be a fine addition to the collection of Argento and Soavi fans. One never knows whom to trust among the characters, there are plenty of jump-scares and arresting/disturbing images, and the ending is perfect, making End of the Line short and sweet, not at all belabored.

8340414,4,B001T46TAQ,"I must admit, I went into this film with low expectations and my mind was changed within the first 10 minutes of watching this film! What do you know? It has quite a bit of originality compared to what you would expect!

The story is about a nurse who receives word that a patient just committed suicide on the tracks. She is shaken by it, as she says she knew that patient was not ready to be discharged yet, and told the doctor so. But oh well, life must go on. On her way home via the subway, she is approached by a crazy guy and meets a new friend with another man. Once on the train, the train comes to a stop in the subway tunnels, and that;s when the nightmare begins. A religious cult begin trying to ""save"" people as they beleive Armageddon is now, and if you are not a part of their cult, you are a target. For the latter part of the movie from there, it's about a bunch of people running for their lives in the tunnels as the nutcases hunt them down.

It doesn't sound like much of a plot, but it does have some good twists and turns and also has one of those endings that makes you think, was that a bad ending? or ...oh, I get it!

Quite a lot of people did not understand the ending, I think most people will dismiss it as a movie with a rushed ending. But those people didn't get it, or figure things out and put the pieces together in the end.

Written, edited, produced and directed by Maurice Devereaux who only has 4 movies to his name, has done a great job on this horror/thriller. Even tho it does not have any real blood and gore, it does contain some decent jump moments, and a good ""WTF"" moment in this one. I can't say I have seen 1 of his other 3 movies, Slashers (2001), but not Lady of the Lake (1998) or Blood Symbol (1992) but after the effort he has put into this one, I'll be sure to go and check those out now. Maybe if you have already seen one of those, and they where OK to you, you might just find this one here is a must see.

It was pretty hard to track this movie down, in Australia anyway, and I do feel in the end the effort for looking for it was well worth it. It's one of those movies where if you didn't piece things together right away, you may need to watch it again to figure it out.",1386547200,,2232,4.018018018018018

The blood and violence was wonderful, but the plot made absolutely no sense to me in the ending part.  Of course, I wasn't paying too much attention, but still, I'm pretty good when it comes to movies and this was... confusing.  If you just want a movie for violence and stuff, this isn't a bad one; certainly not the best, but it's not bad.  If you want a movie that's easy to understand, look somewhere else.",1379462400,,495,4.223404255319149

The Good: There's a good idea lost somewhere in this mess. Religious kooks have been spooky in the past. Just look at Carrie's mom in Carrie. Or Bill Paxton's ""Pastor of Disaster"" in the mucho disturbing, and much more thought provoking, (if not light-years better) Frailty. If handled well it can add a layer of varnish to the old soul of the horror movie enthusiast. If handled poorly, it just makes you groan a lot... Much like it did here. There is however one pretty good jump scare that leads the film off. I hesitate to bring it up here, because though it worked on me, nothing much worked after that early entry point into this flick.

The Bad: ... Where do I start?

End of the Line pretty much feels like a late 80's Tales from the Crypt episode, but strained through the simple medium of the Canadian film machine.

Writer/Director/ Maurice Devereaux must have dragged the acting pool of the local Montreal YMCA. These aren't actors so much as they half-resemble what one might and could look like. Their performances suffer right at pace with the miserable screenplay they must all read their lines from. A screenplay that has the  ability to turn 90 minutes into what seems like 9,000...

The big shocking reveal in the film's climax is completely spoiled by the box art of the DVD cover.  But take heart film fans, you know how the movie ends now, there's no reason to see  it .",1363305600,,1638,4.5288135593220336
