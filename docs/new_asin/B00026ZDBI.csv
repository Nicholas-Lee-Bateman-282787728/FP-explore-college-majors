8023067,5,B00026ZDBI,WoW!! I had forgotten just how good this movie was. I hadn't seen it in years. How this got overlooked is anyone's guess. Quite intense and Bryan Brown's performance was 2nd to none. I don't know why he hasn't done more movies. What a cast as well. I highly recommend buying this before it becomes extinct and hard to find.,1478736000,,323,4.4

It just not to believe some of the junk they put out while leaving the good stuff in storage.  This is a perfect example.  Its got great actors, story and plot. Good crime movie. Try it, I liked it.",1275436800,3,286,3.75
