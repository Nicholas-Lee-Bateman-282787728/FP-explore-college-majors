I have been watching the series on STARS ENCORE WESTERNS for a while and go totally engrossed in the series, which I remember from when I was a kid.

7026378,5,B00TZF2NHO,"Purchased this today based on the review by Abbaselena,  I have been watching episodes offered by local cable network.  Will be wonderful to start from the very beginning!  Sure wish there was a way to get that list compiled by you Abbaselena so I could watch them in correct order.

 I actually have an autographed picture of Hugh O""Brien to me as well as one of me sitting on his lap at the age of 9.  Won a Rhode Island  beauty pageant and then went to National's in New Orleans where Mr. O'Brien rode with us in a parade and then took photos with every contestant!",1474934400,,568,4.30188679245283
7026379,5,B00TZF2NHO,We love Hugh O'Brien in the Life & Legend of Wyatt Earp. We got the Complete Series. Love the old West. RIP Hugh O'Brien.,1473379200,4,121,4.083333333333333

7026382,4,B00TZF2NHO,An otherwise good series is marred by two things:  First - The theme song got annoying after the first couple of episodes and the humming that pretends to be a soundtrack is just weird.  Secondly - the portrayal of Bat Masterson is just strange:  A bit like Dennis the Menace goes to the Old West.,1471651200,3,297,4.363636363636363

7026385,5,B00TZF2NHO,"This is truly a wonderful show!  If you love classic black and white westerns then you can't go wrong with this one.  To me what makes this show great is the fact that it follows the life of Wyatt Earp and his career in Law Enforcement in the correct chronological order starting in Ellsworth, Kansas and ending with the Gunfight At The OK Corral in Tombstone, Arizona.  I am a big fan of most classic westerns from the 1950's, but this is one of the few that was actually based on the life of a real man.  The DVD presentation is great and Douglas Fowley is excellent as Doc Holliday!.",1454457600,9,586,4.3

7026388,5,B00TZF2NHO,"Very satisfied with ""Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp"" Complete Series.
  The picture and audio quality are surprisingly good. Looks very sharp even on a 58 inch flatscreen TV.  No complaints here.
  All DVD's are DVD-R ... But I have played all 30 discs thru...and not a glitch. All play fine ... And that includes on my DVD burner in 2 laptops, as well as 2 portable DVD players, and 2 Blu-Ray Players.
  Only complaint is .... often the episodes are not in broadcast order. To remedy this, I created my own playlist off the internet in proper broadcast order with original dates, and indicated which disc they are on.
  Oddities you should know about:
  Season 6 seems at first to not include the 7th episode ""Woman From Tuscon."" However, it is there under the wrong name, ""The Wicked Widow,"" a Season 2 episode. I compared the 2 episodes and they are different. I even checked the story lines and guest stars. They are exactly correct. Again, only the title name on Season 6 is wrong.
  Season 5's first two episodes are on Disc 5 of Season 4.
  Season 1 Disc 5 includes 2 episodes from Season 2 that are also on the Season 2 DVD's.
  This Western was one of the early greats from my youth. Hugh O'Brian played the role very well.
Glad I purchased these DVD's! Thanks SFM for making them available for a good price when purchased as a complete set.",1441584000,28,1349,4.440816326530612

7026390,5,B00TZF2NHO,This is a wonderful series.  I love Hugh O'Brien and he does a wonderful job bringing Wyatt Earp to live.  I really enjoyed.,1434585600,2,124,4.3478260869565215
7026391,5,B00TZF2NHO,"Finally!  All six seasons of ""The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp"" on DVD.  I have one minor complaint.  Although I have only watched the season 6 DVD, I noticed that the episodes are not in order of broadcast.  I don't understand why SFM didn't put the episodes in order.  Hmmm.",1431129600,12,277,4.352941176470588
7026392,5,B00TZF2NHO,"I ordered this not knowing exactly how long it would take before I rec'd it. Much too my surprise it came within less than about a month. All 6 seasons. 30 DVD's. I am in heaven. This is my favorite Western of all time. And Hugh O'Brian ranks up there with John Wayne as one of my favorite all time American hero's. Purchasing these as individual seasons is much more expensive than buying this Complete Set, so this is a truly fantastic purchase at $119.00. Just a GREAT price. I've waited forever for this. I couldn't be happier with this, I feel 50 years younger just watching these episodes. What a shame we've drifted so far away from the values displayed in the simpler times characterized by this show, and the values Mr. O'Brien himself stood for. Aim only too wound and not kill. Drink milk, not whiskey. Semper Fi Mr. O'Brian. And for anyone out there that loves these old shows, this is a wonderful way to continue watching TV. Thanks AMAZON for making this available. Thanks Mr. O'Brian for everything you've done in your life. You've been a great role model.",1430870400,16,1071,4.55440414507772
7026393,5,B00TZF2NHO,"I remember when I was a little kid, seeing reruns of these on Saturdays.  But I never saw any after I was about 10.  I was just BLOWN AWAY by this series!  It is WONDERFUL!  It's really nice at this time seeing a show with someone who does not believe in violence, and goes WAY out of his way to avoid it.  I had thought the price was kind of high on this, but it is worth every penny and more.  I'm really glad I found this and got it, it has given me many happy hours watching it (and fortunately I'm not done yet).  And it doesn't hurt a THING how great looking Hugh O'Brian is either!",1430352000,8,588,3.9322033898305087
8703559,5,B00TZF2NHO,"Loosely based on Wyatt Earp's life. This series is action packed with everything you can think of in a western. From cattle rustling to barroom brawls, and the famous OK Coral seen. Very entertaining.",1530748800,,200,4.911764705882353
8703560,5,B00TZF2NHO,"Great series.  It's different in that there is no real music track, only a barbershop quartet humming where music  is usually used, but the series is a breath of fresh air.  Featuring a cast of recurring characters and following actual events of Wyatt Earp's life, the series culminates with the showdown at the O.K. Corral.  Along the way, Earp's historical life is filled in as we lead up to that fateful day.  It's an enjoyable journey.",1528416000,,439,4.723684210526316
8703561,3,B00TZF2NHO,"Why these companies continue to issue junky, made-on-demand DVD-R's is beyond me; in runs of more than, say, 200 copies, proper DVD's are actually cheaper to make.  And real DVD's will play in anything, unlike the ultra-finicky DVD-R's.",1524873600,,236,5.2105263157894735

8703563,5,B00TZF2NHO,"I love the fact that Wyatt Earp lived by his Christian principles, he never shoots to kill, only to stop, of he had to be a good shot to do that consistently, and the story line is always wonderful, so glad I have the whole series.",1517788800,,231,4.043478260869565
