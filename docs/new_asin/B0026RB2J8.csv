3856782,4,B0026RB2J8,"crescendo was the bottom half of a double bill with hammers ""taste the blood of dracula"".its one of those friday night horror movies that passes the time quite well,although not so much a horror film,more a thriller but none the worse for that.the film is on a par with hammers ""scream of fear""although not quite as good,it does hold its own and certainly holds your attention,its certainly one for the hammer collection.the print used by warners is there usual high standard and is part of the warner archive collection.",1348876800,,521,4.865168539325842
3856783,1,B0026RB2J8,"As with all hammer films, they are shot with a ""4x3"" negative soft matte.  I have seen many versions of this and all ""wide screen"" versions have the top and bottom cut off.  Yes you will miss parts of Stefanie.  The only good version of any hammer film would include an unmatted version on the disk.  (beware ""lust for a vampire"" since ""all"" of Yutte Stensgarrd's nudity is cut off)",1329523200,,382,4.414285714285715
3856784,3,B0026RB2J8,"Weird, slightly kinky Hammer horror yarn has a young grad student (Stefanie Powers) doing a thesis on a deceased composer while a guest of his widow (Margaretta Scott) and her wheelchair bound son (James Olson) in France. But everything is not as it seems. The widow insists Powers dress in a dead woman's clothes, the son has schizophrenic mood shifts, the maid (Jane Lapotaire) has blackmail plans and the butler (Joss Ackland) is there to protect the ugly family secret. With the exception of one genuinely shocking moment, there aren't many thrills to be had but the film moves along nicely.

The Warner Archives MOD DVD is a decent anamorphic wide screen (1.85) transfer.",1320364800,7,676,4.9298245614035086
3856785,3,B0026RB2J8,"This is one of the last examples of Hammer's psycho-thriller genre, similar in style and plotline to those the company made in the early sixties such as Maniac, Paranoiac, Nightmare and Scream of Fear/Taste of Fear: it even has a wheelchair and is set in the South of France. But this one is in colour and widescreen.
As with the others it centres around an attractive young girl - in this case Stephanie Powers who delivers a restrained and sensitive performance - who is invited into a bizarre household on an innocent pretext; but of course it's Hammer so something very dark lies just beneath the surface and inevitably relies on the heroine stumbling over several gory bodies and screaming a lot when she does. This one was also made in the late sixties by which time Hammer had discovered how useful sex and nudity was for drawing in the crowds.
As a Hammer completist I bought this without a second thought the moment I found it on Amazon, but do be aware of the warning that goes along with it: this dvd is unlikely to play on dvd recorders or pcs, and was decidely iffy on two out of three players I tried it on too. There are no extras whatsoever.
It isn't the best thing Hammer ever produced and really isn't the best of their psycho-thrillers either - the Crescendo of the title is a sort of in-joke inspired by the musical background element of the storyline, and is somewhat ironic in light of the slow-burning-fuse nature of the film. But if you're a big Hammer fan then have it, if only to fill that annoying little gap on your shelves.",1255996800,17,1552,4.487632508833922
3856786,4,B0026RB2J8,"This review is for the DVD video/audio quality.  It is widescreen and uncut, and the transfer is great, especially if you've seen the painful bootlegs of this movie prior to this DVD release.

As for plot, back in 1972 when I was 9 yrs old (yikes), it made a strong impression on me, very creepy movie (it was the second feature to ""Dracula AD 1972"" in the theaters).  Watching it now, I see nothing of that...go figure.  I can't say it was a very enjoyable movie.",1250812800,17,464,4.3604651162790695

3856788,5,B0026RB2J8,"I can hardly begin to explain what all I appreciate about this film.  I saw it for the first time last night, and I told my husband (who hasn't seen it yet) that I would like to watch it again at least ten or twelve more times.  To begin with, the film calls English speakers to pay special attention because the movie is in German, so you have to read captions--which makes it all the more powerful as with Mel Gibson's, The Passion.  Secondly, the whole production has too many layers of excellence for me to take time to describe them all here.  I will say, though, that one scene, in particular, gripped me.  It's a scene of two extremely vulnerable human beings both crying so hard.  As a viewer of the film, I didn't know which crying human I felt worse for.  My heart bled for them both.  They were so together and NOT together all at once.  It's perhaps the most tragic, human, beautiful, painful scene I've ever witnessed.  There's yet another scene in the film that encapsulates a moment of extraordinary temptation, and again, as a viewer, you FEEL that temptation with the protagonist.  You are THERE in the moment WITH her.  I just wanted her to GET OUT because the moment was an evil one; there was no good choice in that desperate horrible moment except to reject that moment altogether and GET OUT.  But the protagonist was IN the moment . . . No doubt, I could be clearer in my explanation of this, but I don't want to give any hint as to what happens next in the film because the story holds such suspense.  ""Crescendo"" is the perfect title for it.  Thirdly, I wish I could issue an Oscar to the protagonist--her eyes, her terrorized eyes, her look of longing, her hopelessness, her wistful insistence . . . it is all there to be experienced in her eyes.  Bravo to whoever did the casting.  Bravo to the director and producer alike.  Bravo, bravo, bravo.  I'm still standing on my feet, giving the film a standing O.  I can't stop clapping in my mind.  I intend to show this film to friends and students and groups of people, so I just bought it.  Fourthly and finally, I'll close by saying there's a message in this film that I believe can re-humanize people who are dissociating from their own humanity because being human means being vulnerable and in pain.  May all who view this film be re-humanized.",1411171200,4,2323,4.45260663507109
3856789,4,B0026RB2J8,"Fairly early on I was able to deduce a couple of scenarios that would explain the events happening in this increasingly implausible  but highly entertaining , retro viewership fun and very unusual film . By no means was I fully correct though and , as a Hammer enthusiast , the journey was the point and ownership was the outcome .
With fully 35 minutes to go while watching Crescendo (via Warner Archive) I found myself looking up yet again and hooking up with this now (7-20-14) very reasonably priced copy of a Hammer essential .
Joss Ackland (The House That Dripped Blood , Lethal Weapon 2 , Rasputin : The Mad Monk) part of the film's micro cast , Is an actor I've not seen often but always enjoyed greatly . He's grand here as seemingly always . A unique looking , sort of jowly fellow with a great countenance and real screen presence .
James Olson (Andromeda Strain) was an actor's actor to me . Increasingly , as I've grown older , I discover new Olsen performances that knock me out . This one included . He's outstanding here .
Stefanie Powers (Hart To Hart) is fetching and terrific as the film's female protagonist and does excellent work in a difficult role .
Both other players , Margaretta Scott (as Olson's character's mother) and Jane Lapotaire are superb as well .
You'll no doubt have noticed that I've elected to tell you virtually nothing of the film itself . Others do that better than I to be certain . Additionally , I favor discovery through desire . Seek it out for the thriller it is , if inclined . Enjoy the locations , sets , phonographs , reel to reel , namesake musical score(s) and all the early 70's trappings it will delight your senses with as part and parcel of discovery . See the Eccentric Cinema review for further insights .",1405814400,2,1766,4.46749226006192
3856790,5,B0026RB2J8,"The production and direction work of this very short film is some of the best I have seen. Very artistic, a very moving story.

3856793,5,B0026RB2J8,"This is a truly wonderful film. The ending is quite unexpected. It is based upon the diary entries of one intimately involved in the story. The story is told in an intriguing and exciting way rising, as it were, to a startling crescendo! All of us, young to old, enjoyed the film immensely.",1384646400,6,290,4.490566037735849
3856794,4,B0026RB2J8,"this is a prety decent thriller from the famous Hammer pictures.it has a creepy mood, and some interesting characters. the biggest weakness is this twist ending, it comes out of no where, and seems to be there just to have a twist. overall it is a tense thriller and worth it to see, but a bit flat at the end.",1381190400,2,310,4.183333333333334
3856795,4,B0026RB2J8,"This is another of Hammer's psychodramas that was originally released as the second half of a double bill. In 1969 it was featured with one of the company's late Dracula pictures (TASTE THE BLOOD OF DRACULA). It has been nearly impossible to see since then until this 2010 DVD-R release from Warner Archive. What you get to see in this film is something that every Hammer fan already knows but others don't. In addition to their celebrated horror films, they also made some really fine suspense thrillers and so-called psychodramas. After the success of PSYCHO, Hammer made TASTE/SCREAM OF FEAR, PARANOIAC, MANIAC, and HYSTERIA (the so-called GASLIGHT films because they involve trying to drive someone insane) in the early 1960s. Then came FANATIC/DIE! DIE! MY DARLING in 1965 which was in color and had American star power in Tallulah Bankhead. Also in the cast was an up and coming American actress named Stefanie Powers who had already made a few films like Blake Edwards' EXPERIMENT IN TERROR (1962). She would later star in a TV spinoff called THE GIRL FROM U.N.C.L.E. (1966), become involved with actor William Holden, and share his passion for wildlife preservation. She must have also liked her Hammer experience because she came back 4 years later to do CRESCENDO.

As often happened when Hammer worked within this genre, the storylines were nothing new. What made these films work and fun to watch were the committed performances and just how well put together the movies were. CRESCENDO is no exception and, in fact, it is so well crafted that it is a joy to behold. Director Alan Gibson, who would later make the execrable DRACULA A.D. 1972 and the much better SATANIC RITES OF DRACULA (1974), got everything right this time around. Although studio bound, the set is impressive and the camerawork extremely imaginative within the confines of that set. James Olson, a bland but effective actor, does quite well as the paralyzed male lead. Strong support comes from Jane Lapotaire, Joss Ackland, and Margaretta Scott as the mother with a secret. However the movie belongs to Stephanie Powers. Just a few years after being spanked with a coal shovel in McCLINTOCK (1963) and 10 years away from HART TO HART, she does a remarkable job as the principal lead. Her line delivery, her reactions, her thought processes all register in a believable way that keep us following her every step. I was surprised at how good she was and how much she made me enjoy this movie along with the other details I already mentioned. Although there are no extras, the picture quality on this DVD-R is superb.",1380326400,,2597,4.875565610859729
3856796,5,B0026RB2J8,"Hammer Studios went on producing horror pictures in the early seventies, having some of the best of the sixties.  In 1970 Michael Carreras produced this script by Jimmy Sangster and Alfred Shaughnessy, based on an original screenplay by Shaughnessy.  I understand that they had originally wanted Joan Crawford to star in the part now inhabited by Margaretta Scott, but Crawford was set to star in her ape picture, I can't remember the name of which, but remember Crawford saying ""Yes, I would play the part of an ape if they asked me to.  Maurice Evans did!""  But unfortunately, 1970's ""Crescendo"" which boasted the star power of Stephanie Powers and James Olson would have long been on the map instead of waiting for Warner Archive to recently release it again had Ms. Crawford come to her senses and made films for Hammer.  Yes, despite that Bette Davis had already had made a success with the company.  Powers did bring along previous success with Hammer (having starred in ""Die! Die! My Darling"" opposite Tallulah Bankhead) and Olson had prior made ""Moon Zero Two"" the year before.  Alan Gibson would later direct ""Dracula 1972 A.D."" for the company, but his work here is very effective.  Just when you thought you'd seen the best of Hammer, you see a picture like ""Crescendo"" that has a lot of promise, and they really deliver.  Without giving a synopsis of the plot at all, I can only say it is a Hammer Film and trust me, you'll like it.  I also understand Warner Archive here makes available an unedited international version for what is considered ""pricey"" as there is not even a trailer.  But it is quite an effective piece.  Bravo, Hammer!  Forever hallowed your walls!  Thank you for never letting us down.",1370995200,4,1718,4.760135135135135
