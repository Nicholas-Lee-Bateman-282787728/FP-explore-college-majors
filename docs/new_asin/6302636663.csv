487083,4,6302636663,"Looks like this will be the first review of Red Riding Hood on DVD.For those that have already seen this movie...you must get the DVD.It looks terrific. The picture is crisp and clear,the colors are vibrant and even the sound is pretty good,especially when compared to the VHS version. The sound is recorded in Dolby Surround 2.0,but the surround effect seems to be noticeable only during the musical numbers. Unfortunately,there's no special features except for the requisite theatrical trailer. For those that haven't seen this movie,It's a quirky adaption of the classic story of Red Riding Hood,Cannon Movie Tales style. The cast includes a couple of well-known actors...Craig T. Nelson(""Coach"",""Poltergeist""),Isabella Rosselini(""Blue Velvet""),and some lesser-known actors like Amelia Shankley('A Little Princess"",""Dreamchild"") and Rocco Sisto(""The Sopranos""..Sisto played the younger Uncle Junior in a couple of flashback episodes).The musical numbers are a mixed bag,but they manage to give the film a decent sense of pacing. From what I've gleaned from the internet,this was the last feature film that then-15-year-old Amelia Shankley ever made. She did have a recurring role in the ""Lovejoy"" television series a few years after Red Riding Hood but apparently hasn't done much since then. That's a shame,because she seemed to display a great deal of talent in this film and all of the others she appeared in. Anyways,this is a good family-type movie but younger children might be frightened by portions of it.",1081209600,,1516,5.482905982905983

All the kids in my drama class did not see it and did  not know that there is a sexual atraction between them in the movie. I said "" what! "" you haven't seen this movie obviously they haden't other wise they would have gotten the awnser. Anyway I just love these movies but I wonder when they will come out so everyone can see them.

Since I was 13 I have tried to collect all the Cannon Movie Tales (since all but three are out-of-print) and ""Red Riding Hood"" happens to be a favorite of mine!

487087,5,6302636663,"Craig T. Nelson plays a double role alongside Isabella Rossellini, Rocco Sisto, and the lovely Amelia Shankley in the title role as ""Red Riding Hood."" This, my favorite version of my favorite Grimm fairy tale, is the famous story of  the adolescent girl whose journey through the woods to her grandmother's house is fraught with danger from a vicious wolf that preys on  the helpless traveler. The wonderful folks behind the Cannon Movie Tales do an excellent job of beefing up the plot though, without losing the traditional story and basic lessons within. The bulk of this movie brilliantly sets up the story to make the famous walk to grandma's the climax of the whole tale! Before all that, we meet Red Riding Hood and discover the story of her long lost father, gone for seven years to war and long-believed dead by all but his family. Red Riding Hood, known here as Linet (until her grandmother gives her the magical red cloak of protection from harm), is a child without fear, but she is in great danger from her uncle, the lord of the land since her father went away. Uncle Godfrey is a cold man who gave up his heart to possess a werewolf as his servant. The werewolf, known simply as Dagger (Rocco Sisto) and torn between his human and animal natures, works as a spy and assassin for Godfrey, and when Godfrey decides that his niece is standing in the way of his attempts to woo his sister-in-law for his own, he sends Dagger to take care of her.

""Red Riding Hood"" is easily my favorite of the nine wonderful Cannon Movie Tales, which are among the best live-action fairy tale films available to date. Sticking more closely to the original stories than the usual fare, the Cannon Movie Tales mix in simple but fun-filled songs with fantastic casts and writing that blends realism and fantasy seamlessly. ""Red Riding Hood"" may not be the greatest Cannon Movie Tale over all, but it is still excellent, it's my personal fave, it's among the best four and easily the most original. Rocco Sisto and Craig T. Nelson perform two wonderful solos, and the duet between Rocco and Amelia Shankley during the walk to grandma's is just magnificent! Probably the best musical number in all the Cannon Movie Tales! Plus, I have a particular fondness for werewolf stories and this tale in particular. In fact, Amelia has been one of my dreamgirls since I saw this film on the Disney Channel as a kid. Hmm, she's my age I believe... I wonder what she's doing now...  Anyway, it's so terrific that these childhood favorites many of us remember from the Disney Channel's 1980's and early 90's glory are finally available on DVD (most of them at least). The DVDs include trailers (not sure if these films ran anywhere theatrically), and most (including Red Riding Hood) are presented in fullscreen format. The Cannon Movie Tales are mostly family fun, though be warned that some can have their scary moments (probably this one especially). The other Cannon Movie Tales, all of which I highly recommend, are: Rumpelstiltskin, The Emperor's New Clothes, Hansel and Gretel, Snow White, Puss In Boots (starring Christopher Walken!), Beauty and the Beast, The Frog Prince, and Sleeping Beauty. Those last two have not yet been released to DVD, and I have yet to see Rumpelstiltskin at any retail stores, though Amazon seems to carry it. I wish to get them all, but currently only own my favorites: Red Riding Hood, Snow White, Puss In Boots, and Hansel and Gretel. Fairy tale fanatics should own all these films, and I also highly recommend my top favorites, the Disney animated versions. Also, for a scarier version of Snow White, pick up the outstanding, ""Snow White: A Tale of Terror,"" starring the beautiful Monica Keena, and for a scarier version of Little Red Riding Hood, pick up ""The Company of Wolves."" Incidentally, a new ""Red Riding Hood"" movie is scheduled to come out on DVD very soon. We'll see how that one measures up later. More recommendations: Shelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre collection (also best known from the Disney Channel airings), Shrek and Shrek 2, The Slipper and the Rose (for a live-action Cinderella), Ever After (another live-action Cinderella), The Adventures of Pinocchio (1996), Peter Pan (2003), The Wizard of Oz, Return to Oz, and Rodger's and Hammerstein's Cinderella (1965) among others!",968803200,3,4318,4.815363881401617
487098,1,6302636663,I was quite disappointed with this rendition of Red Riding Hood.  This story was more about Red Riding Hoods mother and an evil king than poor little Red  The actual Rid Riding Hood portion of the story took place in the last 15 minutes of the movie which may be too grafic for small children.  The movie overall was quite boring and stale.  My 6 year old son fell asleep waiting for the Red Riding Hood portion to show.,1406073600,2,420,4.2784810126582276

487105,5,6302636663,"i know a lot of people love to rip into Cannon MovieTales, but i love 'em. these movies bring me back to the 80's when i would wait for the video store to open on the morning of each new MovieTale release so i could rent them before the kids would grab 'em off the shelves.
  the strong point here is the musical score by award winning composer and song writer Stephen Lawrence. his score is winning and charming. unfortunately the actors are not trained singers and don't do the score a lot of justice.
  don't get me wrong, i love Amelia Shankley and Isabella Rossilini, but i just don't think they have strong singing voices. they are still good here and interesting to watch.
 Cannon MovieTales are definitely on a par with Shelley Duvall's famous and wonderful 'Fairy Tale Theater' and should be given more respect than are generally given them.

487106,1,6302636663,"Imagine if Ed Wood made a musical, then this would be the result.

Painful to watch, let alone listen to (unless you're 5 or under).  The songs are weak, the recordings so 'canned', even the dialogue sounds like it was dubbed.  At the same time, it's so horrifically embarrassing and so poorly made, it's almost entertaining...in small bites.",1280016000,,342,4.862068965517241

I would highly recommend it to those who love fairy tales, musicals, and Little Red Riding Hood.

487110,3,6302636663,"Red Riding Hood is one of the many ""Cannon Movie Tales"" that I grew-up with and am happy to find released on DVD.  It was by no means my favorite of the series (which includes- Snow White, Rumpelstiltskin, Beauty and the Beast, Emperor's New Clothes, Puss in Boots, Hansel and Gretal, and not released on dvd in the U.S.- Frog Prince, Sleeping Beauty).  This series of movies looks like it was done all with shared sets (most of the sets from Red Riding Hood can be seen in Beauty and the Beast, Snow White, and Frog Prince) and sometimes the same actors.  Red Riding Hood includes Isabella Rossellini (Merlin, Death Becomes Her) and Craig T. Nelson (Coach, Poltergeist).  There's a few delightful songs, some overripe acting from the infamous ""wolf,"" and some general changes in the story to stretch it out for a full length movie.  All in all I like it mostly out of nostalgia more than anything else.",1209513600,2,903,4.61875
487111,3,6302636663,"Be prepared to watch the enhanced version of ""Little Red Riding Hood"".  Ever wondered what became of Red's father?  Want to know a little more about her mother and grandmother?  This version of the classic fairy tale is certainly full of surprises.  It was so surprising, I didn't even recognize the original story.  In fact, the real story doesn't even begin until about a half hour into the movie!

""Red Riding Hood"" features an oddball collection of characters in a disinteresting plot. Red's evil uncle attempts to romance Red's disinterested mother after Red's father becomes MIA. The only ""mildly interesting"" character is the wolf who spends much of the show disguised as a spy for Red's uncle.

This film includes a cute little ditty entitled ""Never Talk To Strangers"", which is the underlying moral of this tale.  Though I still wouldn't show this movie to any child younger than 10. I do not think younger children will be that interested in the plot.",1188864000,,961,4.852760736196319
487112,5,6302636663,"Although this movie departs greatly from the original fairy tale, it is still worth purchasing.  It is well made, the acting is superb, with Isabella Rosselini reminiscent of her wonderful mother Ingrid Bergman.  I taped this for my daughter on VHS many years ago and she watched it so much!  It is very well done and no one who buys it will be disappointed.  It would be intense for very young children, however.",1167177600,2,413,4.616438356164384
487113,5,6302636663,"I am 15 years old and I've only seen this movie 2...3...4...times? Something like that. We have a crumby tape recording of 4 songs of the movie. It doesn't matter to me how crumby the recording is; I've listened to it religiously for years. That's how good the songs are.

It has been noted here that ""Never Talk to Strangers"" is a favorite song of many. It's my favortie as well. It's absolutely incredible how the werewolf is developing his own personality. He is warning the girl, quite literally, of himself. He seems exasperated when she doesn't listen - of course the carefree Red Riding Hood doesn't take anything anyone says seriously. I have wondered whether he is honestly hoping in a hidden heart (unlike his truly heartless master) that the girl will be able to stay away from him, or only slyly winning her trust. That's only a tiny, twisted piece of how great the plot is.

All in all, it's very true what the other reviewers have said - this is nothing like the original story we all know. It's better. It's been expanded into a world of lifelike characters, the simple life of the harvest (Green in the Blue), Corrupt politics (Red's uncle, naturally), war (her father was fighting)... and everything else you could hope for in a fairy story. A wonderful tale to grow up on. I know that from experience.

One last thing I note, is that it does not portray the wild wolf, a natural animal quite as badly as the old tales because it is a summoned werewolf, not a natural wolf, who does the evil. This is a winning point in my book since I'm a majorly pro-wolf person. :)",1128297600,20,1584,4.493055555555555
487114,1,6302636663,"I bought this because it is made by Cannon Movie Tales and I love ""Puss in Boots"", which they also made.  Because ""Puss in Boots"" was so good, I thought this would be, too.  Alas, I was disappointed.  ""Red Riding Hood"" has almost no relation to the story we are all familiar with.  The plot in the actual fairytale is more of a parenthetical remark than the main story line in this movie.  Add to this that the acting was rather painful and the special effects were anything but special and you are left with 1 star.  The one thing it had going for it was that it was perfectly clean and not very scary for youngsters.  Since small children are easier to please in the cinematic area than adults, perhaps they would still enjoy this adaptation to ""Little Red Riding Hood"".",1104364800,8,772,4.394366197183099

Well, I am pleased to say that this film is  the best adaptation of Red Riding Hood on film but it also delivers lots of wonderful surprises.  The last film in the wonderful Cannon Movie Tale series is really one of the best in the collection.  Amelia Shankley, Isabella Rosselini and Craig T. Nelson give captivating performances and the film is also very well directed.  This film is not boring, it is actually very powerful.  However, this is not a film for the very young ones as I found myself flinching at parts and somewhat taken aback by some events that happen in the film.  The songs and dance sequences are wonderful. It's great that the original trailer is included with the DVD.  The picture is crystal clear and the sound is also on-par.  I highly recommend this film, as it delivers lots of surprises and although it is the story of Red Riding Hood that we all know and love, there is alot of original ideas that everyone will be delighted to see!!!

487117,5,6302636663,"This live-action musical version of the beloved ""Little Red Riding Hood"" story by The Brothers Grimm is a must see/have. The songs are fun and absolutely addicting.

The movie elaborates on the original story by adding a bit more plot to spice the things up. It goes as follows: A baroness, whose husband vanished in a war years ago, lives in a nice house in the woods with her daughter Ninet (a.k.a. Red Riding Hood). Ninet's evil uncle has taken the throne in her fathers absence and now resides in the castle while the baroness chooses to live a simple life. Unfortunately the (quite literally) heartless uncle wants the Baroness to be his wife and does everything within his power to make it so.

When all of his attempts fail miserably, he employs the help of a werewolf named Dagger to get rid of Ninet so that she does not poison his name to her mother. It's really a good movie, and the DVD has crystal clear picture (not to mention surround sound) so that you get the complete theatrical experience. The original Cannon Movie Tales trailer makes a nice bonuse feature as well. The only downside is that the movie is in full-screen and there is no widescreen version for the choosing. A widescreen version exist because the German DVDs contain that version as well as the more recent Australian disc. However, I find this is forgivable because of the high quality picture and sound. I give this DVD five stars! Now, if only they would release the other Movie Tales in the series...",1083110400,6,1489,4.615094339622641
