886358,4,6304475055,"As a movie that you might find yourself watching to gain some insight into the ways of the ancients and how they ""may have"" been influenced by Aliens, or some other sort of extra-terrestrial life-form, this one is probably a good bet to get a better laugh than gain knowledge. The group I watched it with thought it was hilarious, if you've seen it you can imagine the one-liners we came up with such as: ""Look... you see that rock over there? Erik Von Daaniken thinks it is shaped like a lazer gun because they used to see the aliens wielding them..."" Absolutely hilarious. In it's entirety this movie was a vast sea of rhetorical questions being sailed by the master himself. (daaniken). A good laugh, not much substantial info however.",996105600,3,738,4.641221374045801
886359,4,6304475055,This is a new follow up video done for TV and is worth having if you have the original Chariots.,987811200,,96,3.85

886361,3,6304475055,"Hi Ho from Melbourne (Aust)...Just a short note, I decided to buy this program on DVD mainly because of the Sound Track since I couldn't find it on CD. Well what can I say, the picture quality is acceptable but ""boy oh boy"" what happened to the sound!, the naration is ok, but I like to pay attention to the sound track in most films but the music in this DVD release was terrible to say the least, the Wow and Flutter is so horrible that my 15 year old video recording off TV is awhole lot better!! If any more copys are to be made, please replace your master copy. And one other thing, if you want to be enlightend by Science and facts then do yourselves a favour and get Carl Sagan's ""COSMOS"" you won't be sorry....Clint (VK3CSJ)",986515200,3,732,4.235714285714286
886362,5,6304475055,"Let me start by saying Darwin didn't have formal training, and the ones that do...lie. Daniken shows us that there is more out there than we know. He shows us guys with formal training can and are wrong at times. But  people with no formal training have to,of course be wrong, Only educated  people can form our collected minds. Most EXPERTS have been taught to think  2+2=5, and don't question it! Well sombody does and what do we do, all but  stone him to death in front of the city gates. Boy you can take what the  mostly under educated darwin wrote to heart, maybe even recite some  paragraphs strait from memory, but when it comes from a guy who has had  more experience with the material he writes about you mock him. The video is  an excellent source of material on the subject and fits nicley with my  video collection.",959990400,8,828,4.430463576158941
886363,5,6304475055,"Since noone seems to be explaining the actual theme of this movie, I'll try to do just that in as few words as I can:
It is the story of our spicies and life as we know it. It makes you really think about who we are  and if we're alone here. I strongly recommend that everyone who reads this  buy at least one copy or more and share it with all their friends.

886451,3,6304475055,I saw this as a kid in the theater and thought it would be an interesting movie to watch as an adult.  It was okay but not great.  The content is still amazing but the narration and music are so 1970s that it makes it difficult to watch.  Still an interesting way to burn 90 minutes though.,1479772800,,290,4.052631578947368

How about Superman or Samson or Hercules or witchcraft or God or--a smart engineer who knew how to move heavy objects? What you want is what you get.

A complete waste of time by paranoid panderers of conspiracy, the same guys who had us waste even more time over JFK and 9/11 and never got anyone to listen.",1469923200,,483,4.426966292134831

886697,3,6304475055,"Interesting documentary. The production is a little dated, especially the soundtrack. That is to be expected since this was made in 1970.

""Chariots of the Gods"" is certainly thought-provoking. It makes one wonder what it's like to be irrational enough to believe that the most reasonably explanation for an oddly-shaped detail in an old painting is that the artist was drawing aliens zipping around. It also makes one wonder what kind of aliens would travel vast interstellar distances in Apollo-style rockets, and force the natives to build gigantic stone launch pads for their ships. Perhaps an alien civilization with their own ""Society for Creative Anachronisms""?

This ""documentary"" is the most elaborate example I've ever seen of the wonderful (and always entertaining) fallacy:

1. They thought so-and-so was crazy, but he turned out to be right.
2. They think I'm crazy.
3. Therefore, I'm right.

Forget the content, you've seen most of this on Ancient Aliens and other modern documentaries.  Study the film.

I'm in my fifties now and have seen this film a few more times since, and I always enjoy it. I think most people are intrigued when they watch this film as its certainly thought provoking.  But I would assume most stop giving it anymore thought afterwards. On my most recent viewing I have decided to continue thinking about the theories presented, even watching other documentaries regarding this subject, including the mystery behind Easter Island.

Whether it's the pyramids in Egypt or the pyramids in Mexico, these blocks that weigh a couple of tons each that were stacked up on each other, were moved logically and not by ordinary means. They had to have had help from somewhere and somebody, and if so, why haven't they returned? Or have they?

888314,1,6304475055,"Erich Von Daniken's book ""Chariots of the Gods"" is a so-called documentary based on wild speculation and lack of imagination.  While piecing together the great mysteries of archaeology and ancient civilization, whenever the author doesn't know the answer, he assumes extra-terrestrials were responsible.  He often says, ""There can be no other explanation,"" effectively shutting down the debate.

The presentation is built on the assumption that ancient civilizations were knuckle-dragging morons, incapable of feats of engineering of any kind.  Any impressive work or monument is attributed to a gift from the ancient alien visitors.

Of course, the real motive of Chariots of the Gods is to convince people that their ""God"" was nothing more than an alien visitor with impressive technology.  The author cites supernatural events in the Holy Bible to further his E.T. drivel, but doesn't acknowledge that the same Bible states that ancient people were engineers brilliant enough to elicit a response from God (i.e. The Tower of Babel).

The ones who had read the book and were at least open to the concepts therein enjoyed it - the rest not so much - in fact most of them thought it was crap.

An interesting aside - the ones of us who liked and thought the concepts thought provoking are much better off (economically speaking) than those who thought the whole idea sucked.  I'm not sure what the means but it is true.

Anyway the music was intriguing as well. I almost wonder if this is not the whole and complete movie we saw (and yes - I know that this was a long time ago) as some of it seems missing, etc.

Honestly I don't know how much of his points are valid and how many are not but there is enough there to make it worth the time. I took off one star for the inaccuracies.

The other problem is that this movie does not do full justice to Von Daniken's book. So that cost another star. I hear there is another movie that is more true to the book.

889021,3,6304475055,"Any of you who think this film ""proves"" anything are in for a disappointment. But if you want a trip down memory lane because you saw the theatrical release as a kid, or you're just curious and don't mind a poor transfer of what was originally a beutifully-photographed big screen travelogue, overlaid with massively ethnocentric, culturally myopic, wildly speculative musings on the comic book ""theories"" of Erich Van Daniken, then you'll get a kick out of this. I know I did.

I own the Polydor DVD of the soundtrack, and I must say that, aside from a few "" cheesy,"" blatantly sci-fi spots, and a track of pseudo-ethnic ""travelogue"" music, I find it quite inventive, fun and beautiful. But having re-watched the movie recently, I was pained to hear that the actual soundtrack was mostly either stuff that isn't on the soundtrack album, or has been weirdly remixed so as to be unrecognizable compared to the composer's apparent intentions (which I take the LP to more faithfully represent).

So in part I agree that the music as mixed and used in the film is often intrusive, but it's more the fault of the filmmakers than the composer. Also, having never viewed the film in its original German release, perhaps it suffers from a poor US remix. In either case, the soundtrack album is a period, ""audio showcase"" tour-de-force that nothing about (what remains of) the film approaches in quality.

I recommend the soundtrack (LP if you can find it and play it) as a stand-alone product more highly than the film itself. It's sad to see how deteriorated the film appears today from when it was released. I don't blame the transfer so much as the poor archiving of what appears to be a copy many-generations removed from the original master film perhaps reformatted for TV, but not the visual splendor of the film I saw in 1971 (I think?).

Regarding the content: it's just as possible that primative civilizations were in contact with undocumented explorers from more advanced human cultures (perhaps some that are completely unknown to us due to natural disaster or other forms of obliteration) who they found difficult to comprehend in their artistic representations, most of which were in any case highly stylized in ways that were culturally significant and that we fail to understand. We see rocket ships and flames, while they may have seen symbolic ornamentations of spiritual or cultural significance that have been lost to time.

Again, I enjoy mysteries and intellectual what-if-ing as much as anybody, and this is a fun romp in that vein, but it's not science, but highly implausible ""perhaps-es"" (among the many speculative theories about the same artifacts), and a rational person would take this stuff with a HUGE gain of salt (like the ones they put out for cows to lick), and just use this as the film equivalent of popcorn and soda. It's fun, but it isn't serious stuff. There are simply things we know too little about to satisfy our curiosity, and Van Daniken saw an opportunity and seized it.

These artifacts are there because ancient men and women were not stupid as they are made out to be. Our ancestors were geniuses and they designed and created these interesting artifacts around the world.
Our intelligence is far below that of previous men and women. Look at a Beatrix Potter book, (The Tale of Peter Rabbit) written for children in the early 1900s. It  is far beyond the level of the average elementary student. The vocabulary within these books is difficult even for the vast majority of adults. Teachers can't use these books to teach reading. Television, video games, and other forms of entertainment are shutting down our children's brains.
Our ancestors built the pyramids. They didn't need anti-gravity technology. They could have cut huge stones at the quarry into the shape of spheres. Then they rolled the stones to where the pyramids were built. Next they cut the stones into the shapes that make up the pyramid. In the DVD, one of the ancient pyramids was not complete. It still had a path winding around the pyramid. The spherical shaped stones could have been pushed up the pyramid and cut to fit the top levels.

At that time, there was a genre in European publication usually translated as ""speculation,"" which is to say neither fact nor fiction, but something in between. Von Daniken cited a great many archeological anomalies and tried his best to fit them into a theory that the gods depicted by various ancient cultures were actually astronauts visiting earth from somewhere far away.

OK, it's possible. But so many other possibilities exist to explain each one of his ""startling findings"" that the best even this well-photographed movie can do is ask the question: did aliens visit earth long ago? It can't answer it.

My memory told me of this great flick, great visuals, great concepts (even if a little wild), and a flick I remember caused me to really think about this topic for a while.

What my memory failed to remind me of is just how aweful the music is, some of that horrible late 60's pseudo-Jazz that nearly ruins the best of movies. By todays docuimentary standards this would be rated -5 stars, it really is that bad, not in 1970, but time did not treat it well and in 2012, well this is one unless you need it for your collection then there are far better treatments of this concept.

Now if you want to see the origins of the material on all shows of this type that followed, then this is still a must see or must read. The one redeeeming quality is that all of the footage of the ruins and symbols, rock carvings/art, and such are all raw footage, no enhancements, no computer simulated look, no clean of up the images, it is like you were there and looking at the stuff and there is something to say for that, not a lot, but something.

I have been to about 20% of the places they highlight and will say that they give you a view you will never see unless you go and one no tourist brochure will ever show you, you know, the stuff that when you go makes you think, and this is all it is?

I must also credit this flick for mainstreaming, so to speak, the notion that the Earth was populated or at least visited by aliens.

If you want to see the flick that started the UFO visited the earth seed movie then this is still one to have in your collection.

One last note, no documentary review would be complete without at least a glancing review of the presentation of the material, their ""proof"" so to speak. This is old style, there are no opposing views in the flick for the most part, radical claims are made with no support in the film and you are asked just to accept it as fact.",1325635200,9,2017,4.158974358974359

I remember seeing this movie at a drive-in back in the 70s with a friend while toking on a couple of joints. I thought it was sort of facinating but my friend thought it was crap and just after the part about the runways he started up the car and we left. I've just recently rented it from Netflix and I'm viewing it for the second time now, great stuff. However I find it hard to believe that visitors from another planet used rocket technology, way too primative for that kind of distance. But aliens aiding in lifting multi-ton granite blocks or transporting them for miles sounds probable unless ancient humans had antigravity technology.

But I DO know that his book/movie has changed the way I look at the world, even the universe itself. I have been convinced from childhood that the gods of myth were not as varied as many thought. I noticed similarities in deities and stories from across the globe, between cultures that would never have had a chance of meeting each other; I feel that either the same groups of gods oversaw multiple cultures, or aliens visiting the planet did the same thing. It makes a lot of sense to me, and the people I have shown this DVD to agree with me. Like I said, even if some of his theories and evidence have been shot down, there are still far too many mysteries to explain any other way. I know without a doubt that we are not alone in this universe, and it would be arrogant to think otherwise. We have at least attempted to go to other planets--isn't it natural to think that other beings from elsewhere would try the same thing? Is it so outrageous to even entertain the notion that a couple of them might have succeeded in reaching our planet? How do you think ancient civilizations would react to strange creatures emerging from the sky?

You don't have to believe von Daniken. But please, don't be so elitist as to assume that humans are alone in the universe and that no other being could do the same things we have managed to accomplish. It is a huge universe out there, and we have no clue who else is sharing it with us or what they are capable of doing.

It's a shame more movies of this type don't follow this pattern, they are a lot of fun to immerse yourself in and it never gets boring.

My belief that this is true dates to my mythology classes, for one, the facts that he shows in the Sumerian culture where it was written in their language that if it was ""not for the gods from the skies""
that they would never have known how to cultivate their lands, build their cities, etc is evidence that only a person who believes we evolved from apes would deny.
  You also cannot take this one book, or dvd as your evidence that beings from other planets don't exist. Read on, read on don't be narrow minded.
  Some of the evidence Erich Von Daniken had made to prove his points I have to agree with. How difficult and how extremely frustrating it must be to have critics, the ones who won't think beyond their nose, to present his facts and theories only to have them laughed at. His frustration to try to make people see his interpretation of the facts that he read on the Sumerian artifacts was only to try to open peoples minds.
  Think for a moment and look at what is left of the ancient cities and the pyramids, the intricate construction of the Colosseum their is no explanation for how they were built. If in Sumeria, which is now Iraq, they had great buildings, water systems, big cities, how then after the gods, as it is written on their artifacts, left look at what it has become. The area fell back into shambles, not representative of what the cities in Sumeria were. How could they have not have gone forward and built bigger and better civilizations in that area, instead it is what it is today.  How is it in South America where their peoples were living in big cities, no explanation for their demise. Mexico who had great cities and there is no explanation for what happened to them, also believed in the gods, had a type of pyramid, yet look at Mexico now, all their buildings are in shambles, not the once proud nation it was centuries ago.
 So not to think that these teachers from another planet or planets, left this earth, shows how these once outstanding civilizations fell apart is evidence that man on earth did not create these civilizations because they were no more. Man on earth didn't know how to go forward, which is shown by how the future generations lived.",1198454400,11,2439,4.462921348314607

889570,5,6304475055,"Based on Erich Von Daniken's controversial text, this early 1970s documentary classic inspired a slew of similar drive-in movies throughout that decade, including the ever popular ""Outer Space Connection"". It is also responsible for heavily influencing the original ""Battlestar Galactica"", and its auspicuous elements can also be found in ""Stargate"" and ""Alien Versus Predator"".

Basically, the premise behind ""Chariots of the Gods"" is that each of our cultures has been influenced/shaped by extra-terrestrial visitors. These entities have helped advance various civilizations culturally and technologically, as well as theologically. Indeed, Erich Von Daniken theorizes that Earth's religions, including Christianity, were inspired by extra-terrestrial intervention, and ""evidence"" of such can be found in any number of anicent artworks.

The movie presents its case in an almost casual, but enticing way, ultimately proposing that many so-called Earthling-made ""wonders"" (like the pyrmaids) could not have manifested if not through high-tech, alien assistance. When all is said and done, some viewers may be convinced that, indeed, many of Earth's grandest accomplishments could not have occurred if not for the grace of these creatures.

Whether one subscribes to the notions presented in ""Chariots"" or not, the movie proves quite enthralling and does open the mind for any number of  intriguing possibilities. A sweeping, ethereal soundtrack also enchances the viewing, giving it a magical/mystical feel.

For fans of 1970s ""alien visitor"" and ""mythical monster"" documentaries (which includes the popular Sun Classics entries), ""Chariots"" will inevitably prove to be a sentimental favorite. It's no big budget extravaganza, but it sure is lots of fun.",1179273600,2,1755,5.83984375
889571,5,6304475055,"A film that makes you go 'Hmmmm'.

I first saw Chariots of the Gods in a theater as a kid when it was re-released back in the mid Seventies.  I remember having trouble going to sleep that night!  Since then I have attained a degree in science, and still think that it has much merit.

Sadly, this is a film that few people seem to be able to see anymore, at least I haven't noticed it making the rounds on mainstream television or cable in the last twenty five years or so.

The transfer was excellent and made from a well-preserved print.  I noticed few flaws in this thirty-five or so year old film.  There is an extra of pictures, but there are only like eight pictures?  Why bother?  That part was like a carnival sideshow ripoff.  Also, the bio on von Daniken is a short text of one page and was not informative at all.  There are scene selections and true to their word a movie trailer.

The film is an interesting whirlwind of exotic location shots that if nothing else shows the viewer some very interesting sites.  The musical score is hard to describe-in a sense it is eerie, but it also has an overall upbeat, 'hopeful' or optimistic tone.  I get the impression that this film was not made originally in English?  I do like the narrator's (male) voice and keeps your attention.  There are also a few places where the narration is handled in an interesting manner.  Also, the actual filming and editing was excellent and well thought out.  It's as if there is a new surprise awaiting you around every corner.

The documentary also includes some support from a couple of other individuals, one of whom was a Soviet scientist and I found this to be rather interesting given the times.  But I feel that von Daniken's arguments supported by the visual evidence were more than compelling on their own.

I can't help but to compare this film to a Nova episode that dealt specifically with von Daniken's book and thus many of the things in this film.  A few things, at least in the book, were shown to be out and out fabrications.  I seem to remember Nova trying to provide an alternative explanation for such things as (don't quote me...been many years) the 'Baghdad Batteries'.  Since then I have seen these batteries presented as being exactly as what they appear to be by science-ancient batteries.

In fact, it seemed that the makers of the Nova film were in an Okham's Razor competition with von Daniken in trying to provide rational, simple explanations for rather exceptional ancient works of art, stories and artifacts.  I think it was mostly a tie.  'We' still don't know how or why the Pyramids, nor Stonehenge, the Nazca Lines nor many many other things were built in ancient times.  Shame on von Daniken for not giving our ancient ancestors very much credit for coming up with these technologies themselves, but the same can be said for mainstream science which seems to be more and more in the position that ancient peoples were more advanced than we thought and much earlier in time than previously thought.

However, traces of nicotine in Egyptian mummies and a bronze (brass?) computer from an ancient shipwreck does not jive with what mainstream social and natural scientists traditionally present as 'fact' (dangerous word there at any rate).  My point is that mainstream science has had to (as science is supposed to) back down and rewrite its theories as new data and explanations come to light.  So mainstream science does not have an absolute corner on the truth market and what was poo-pooed in the past as nonsense and fantasy has many times gained acceptance (the existence of ball lightning comes to mind).

It would have made a very interesting DVD package if they had included the Nova episode for a few bucks more as this episode is largely forgotten and is collecting dust somewhere.

von Daniken did not say that every single headdress or ceremonial garb were based on ancient astronaut space suits, but what he does present are artworks of things that still look like space suits and advanced controls no matter how much these things are relegated to the mystical fantasies of ancient artists by mainstream scientists.  Interestingly, it is only in the context of modern technology and science as he points out that many of von Daniken's suppositions even begin to make sense! For instance, why does an ancient Mayan observatory look like a modern observatory?  What is the purpose of that if they indeed had no telescopes?

All in all, I think von Daniken's explanations are at least as good as any offered by conservative science.  A powerful, imaginative presentation that actually enriches one's view of our ancient ancestors and does not denigrate their capabilities at all.  These hypotheses actually add a new dimension of wonder and excitement to our collective past.

I definitely plan to watch this over and over again.  It is a superior documentary in that it is not inundated with talking head PhD s or self-styled experts and allows the viewer's mind/imagination to decide the validity of what he is seeing with only suggestions on the part of the writer.

It is refreshing to see a film that still makes you go 'hmmmm' even after all these years.",1176249600,46,5196,4.72253052164262

(Note that this review is for the movie-documentary version on DVD of Chariots of the Gods?)

This movie-documentary is based on the following books by Erich Von Daniken: ""Chariots of the Gods?"" and ""Return to the Stars.""

This movie visually shows the evidence that Erich Von Daniken has collected from around the world that supports the idea or hypothesis that the bulk of human achievement across the millennia can be attributed to extraterrestrial influence.

To get an idea of the scope of what this documentary covers and where the visual evidence was obtained, I will give the titles of its scenes:

1) Titles and credits  2) Could life exist out there?  3) Modern tribesmen reactions  4) Parables, myths, and religions  5) Italy  6) Turkey  7) Egypt  8) Greece and Rome  9) Africa  10) South American Aztecs  11) South America Legends  12) South American Mayans  13) Easter Island  14) South America revisited  15) Other mysteries  16) South American signal art  17) Dare we not question?

Note that Von Daniken does not narrate or even appear as a guest in this film.

Von Daniken's hypothesis of extraterrestrial intervention may be outrageous (I did find leaps in reasoning and logic) but even so, I think it's even more outrageous that we are asked to believe that the fantastic achievements that took place in ancient cultures were totally unassisted.  Scholars have given somewhat convoluted explanations for some of these achievements but, I for one, find many of these explanations lacking.

For example, we are asked to believe that thousands of years ago, before the invention of modern machinery, Egyptian workers transferred the massive stone blocks used to build just one of the Great Pyramids, across northern Africa by using wooden rollers, a process that would have taken more than 600 years, according to mathematical estimation.  I think any rational person would find this explanation unacceptable.  So how did the Egyptians do it?

Von Daniken says that ancient cultures must have had some kind of help.  He extends this idea to almost every major cultural, religious, and societal belief system, including biblical systems.

This movie is strongest with asking questions.  The movie sites extraterrestrial intervention when answering these questions but it does not force the viewer to accept these answers.

Personally, what I found especially fascinating besides the incredible structures that were built by primitive humans were:

(1) the 40,000 year old bison that was found with a bullet hole in its skull

(2) the 2500 year old battery found in Iraq

(3) a polished lens two thousand years old

(4) Maps found in the seventeenth century that outline the coast of Antarctica, a continent which within historical memory has never been free of its massive ice cap.

People who do not like their beliefs challenged or who accept what the ""experts"" tell them will not like this movie.  All others should find it most interesting.

Finally, the on-location photography is great.  We not only see ancient structures but get a glimpse of cultures from around the world.  However, the background music in this documentary is jarring in some spots and I found it to be sometimes distracting.  But other than this, picture and sound quality are more than acceptable.  There are three extras that are interesting but brief.

In conclusion, despite the age of the movie-documentary, this is still one of the best films on a controversial subject that I have seen and one that really makes you think!!

My parents saw this movie 30 years ago and have ALWAYS wanted to see it again.  In December when my dad was given 3 months to live, I tried Amazon again and low & behold...the DVD arrived.  Both my parents were so thrilled and really enjoyed watching it again.  Today I arrive home from his funeral...so no matter how good or bad the 30 year movie was...in my mind I have to give it a 5 star rating.",1140998400,3,507,4.142857142857143

Whether or not it is true,Scary if it is,I thought it was a magnificent attempt to illustrate one possible reason for the meaning of our human exisitance.

889648,4,6304475055,"I can remember watching this movie in my grammar school when I was 10 years old.  I was pretty enthralled back then, although I didn't care so much about the scientific part.  After watching it some 25+ years later, it still holds that special wonder for me.  Film enthusiasts will trash the quality of the DVD--the transfer is a joke (there is lint on the film throughout) and the sound quality goes from varying volumes of loud and soft to outright wobbly. But face it, if you're (like me) watching this movie, you aren't doing it for the THX experience!  Although his arguments aren't very convincing, and his leaps in logic are neck snapping to say the least, Von Daniken's film is still a wonderful travelogue.  Particularly catching are the shoots of the Mayan civilizations, especially the Temple of the Sun.  Whether or not you buy into his theory of ancient civilizations being visited by extra-terrestrials Von Daniken's arguements will still make you scratch your head and say 'gee' (especially his breakdowns of various pyramid constructions); it seems as though he took a page from the likes of Aquinas and other Christian philosophers--since the existence of ETI visitations to earth can't be proved to have not happened for sure, it would be and is equally valid to assume that they did.  Still, this is not a movie to be watched for it's intellectual stimulation so much as it is for it's exotic beauty.",1098403200,2,1419,4.814814814814815

In CHARIOTS Daniken transports the viewer on a global exploration visiting many exotic and ancient cultures; in particular, he focuses on their many beguiling and puzzling architectural constructions.  This speculative documentary is beautifully filmed and even if Daniken's thesis is dubious, that's missing the point.  It's infinitely watchable.",1094601600,2,577,5.845238095238095

889651,5,6304475055,"Since 16 years I'm interested in Erich von D&auml;nikens Ancient Astronaut Theory. Of course he is controversial, of course he is hated by many people. Everybody with new ideas is. von D&auml;nikens book was first published in the 60s and it is still controversial and talked about. That's an accomplishment in itself. This alone proofs that von D&auml;nikens Theory has more to it then his critics would like. 90% of von D&auml;nikens critics I talked to over the years never been to the places he has been to and they never even read his books properly.
A lot of the people claim von D&auml;niken made a lot of mistakes and drew a lot of wrong concludions. Of course he did. Every good researcher does. Only bad researchers never make a mistake! Why? Because they never draw their own conclusions. They write what the rest of the ""established"" researchers and their ""established readership"" wants to hear.
I read ""Chariots of the Gods"" when I was 14. I instantly learned more about history, myths, ancient places and cultures then I did in my whole time in school. Now I'm 30 and I'm still fascinated with von D&auml;nikens theory. But unlike so many of his critics who only try to dismiss or redicule him I try to see the places he writes about myself.
So I'm traveling around the world and take the freedom to look at history from a different angle. To all the guys who only get a laugh out of von D&auml;nikens book: Go ahead and laugh! I go out and do some research...
Tiwanacu, Nazca, Baalbek. Go ahead and see those places for yourself! Then read von D&auml;niken again. You will be surprised how right he is.

889652,2,6304475055,"One of the earliest examples of the pseudo-science documentary genre, this famous (or infamous, depending on your point of view), film poses many questions, and provides little else.
Although there are some fascinating sites around the world visited here, such as Easter Island and several sites in Bolivia, Egypt, and Peru, there are also some things strangely left out.  Stonehenge, for example, is completely missing, even though the focus of the film is on the mystery of moving massive stone blocks great distances. The flight over Plains of Nazca, which sport mysterious drawings that can only be seen from the air, and the Easter Island footage, are perhaps the most interesting parts of the film.
Part of the problem with this 1972 effort is that it was obviously shot for a German audience, and then translated for American audiences. Everything is done in voice-overs, so we do not really hear what the ""experts"" are trying to tell us.
The voice-overs add to the frustration of watching the film. Many questions are raised, but there seems to be no real case being made by the producers. The ""evidence"" being offered is simply a question with no answer. Basically, they're saying, ""Is it old and mysterious? Must have been aliens!""
Of course, no one watches this sort of film for any kind of real scientific education. The theories put forward here have been debunked quite thouroughly, and a zillion times over. The fun in watching this kind of film is in seeing how people only a few decades ago could buy into just about anything that could be labeled as ""Unknown"" or an ""Ancient Mystery"". Unfortunately, while this film is one of the earliest examples of the psuedo-science documentary genre, it is not one of the most entertaining.
One interesting facet of the film is that several Russian ""experts"" were interviewed, an odd inclusion for a US audience at the height of the Cold War. On the other hand, the Russians depicted here were hardly legit, so perhaps the government or whoever figured that that worked in our favor.
The promo for the film, included on the DVD, is classic early 70's advertising, and sadly, better than the film itself.",1032739200,22,2159,4.866847826086956
