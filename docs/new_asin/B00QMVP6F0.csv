8692081,3,B00QMVP6F0,"The problem with producing a walking workout without music is that it is difficult to find music at the correct Beats Per Minute (BPM) to match the rhythm of the trainer and the pace of the workout.  I have a playlist with workout music at 130 BPM and it roughly works with the pace of the workout, but it is not ideal.  There is plenty of free creative commons licence music around, that Nikki could use in her DVDs.  Also, the sound quality of the DVD is not the best because of the windy outdoors conditions she is in, although the scenery is quite beautiful..  If someone has knee problems, this workout is not for you.  Lots of lunges and squats!  There is variety in the workout, however I would not classify it as a walking workout.  I have all of Leslie Samson, Debbie Rocker and George Foreman walking DVDs and this one is not in that category.  It is more a low impact aerobics workout with lots of toning without using dumbbells. Would I buy it again?  Not at this price!. --  NOTE:  This is a DVD-R and if your player can't play DVD-Rs, then you won't be able to watch this workout.",1424822400,8,1094,4.313725490196078
