7914508,4,B00001O2G8,"I just ordered the DVD (used) after again watching my old VHS copy.  Filmed in Bulgaria (pretending to be Russia) most of the secondary actors are Bulgarian and make a heroic effort to handle the English.

But there are so many details that stand out: the super-fit hero jumps out a second story window and the Bulgarian stunt man is clearly 20 pounds heavier. The bouncing and bountiful co-star babe has a full frontal shower scene and remains wearing a thin top and tight skirt with no undies for much of the following ""captured by the bad guys"" scene...UNTIL she escapes and dashes all over ""Moscow"" being chased, now with pantyhose and gym shoes. (She does seem to do a lot of the running herself, not with a double, so I will give Kimberley Kates points for that!)

And, for some reason, at random times people are seen sweating profusely, almost as if the makeup person was on their coffee break. In the opening scene, Kimberley Kates even comments on how much her husband is sweating.  I thought it was part of the plot, as he was ill or something, but I now think it was just and ad-lib to mop his brow!

But lots of bravely enduring Bulgarian extras and some seemingly joyfully playing the parts of bumbling Russian military and bad guys make it fun to watch.
Lots of smashed Ladas as well.

All in all, a fun ""B"" movie, but you definitely don't want your kids to see the shower scene with Kimberley Kates and a few bits of other gratuitous flesh.",1360454400,,1456,4.475471698113208
7914509,1,B00001O2G8,"This movie is so bad that it does not deserve my time to even get into details but if some of you get a kick out of reading reviews of awful movies, you can enjoy some of the reviews by other unfortunate people who have seen this movie for one reason or another. All I can say is that the actors are a complete joke, the budget of the movie is not more than $1,000 and whoever directed this movie made a desperate attempt at creating a ""plot"" which after seeing 5 minutes of would make any decent director collapse from laughter. Bottom line is, unless you are on the verge of suicide and have nothing else better to do, avoid this movie at all costs.",1216425600,,651,4.174603174603175
7914510,4,B00001O2G8,"I was shocked by the paucity and the negativity of the reviews of this film. Granted, Frank Zagammo is no Sean Connery or Matt Damon, but his performance is no worse than a dozen others in this bang, bang, and run era. Moreover, the movie does have a plot: the theft of Russian Nuclear weapons circa 1999. Is that very far fetched? Kates has a thankless role, doing her best to survive alone in a foreign land after her man goes down unexpectedly early on. I'd certainly want her and Zagammo on my side in case of trouble, as the conclusion surely shows. This is not a 5 star apecial, but it does entertain for 100 minutes, unlike many 1 star stinkers.",1204070400,,652,4.352459016393443
7914511,1,B00001O2G8,"I just moved away from home after college but before I left my mom was convinced that I needed a ""guy movie"" for my collection (she wants a son-in-law pretty badly).  She bought this movie while she was at a Pep Boys, though I don't know why she thought that a movie that could be bought at an auto shop for $3 was worth watching.  Anyway, we watched it together and it is hands down the absolute worst movie I have ever seen....but it was one of those it's-so-bad-it's-good movies.  My mom and I had tears running down our faces we were laughing so hard.  The writing was atrocious, the directing was ridiculous, but best of all were the actors.  Frank Zagarino is a combination of stiff delivery, G.I. Joe looks, and the cheesiest grin ever.  Joe Lara = ponytail... 'nuf said.  I felt horrible for Kimberley Kates having to run for god knows how many takes in a sheer blouse without a bra (ouch!).  I honestly felt that the best actor in this whole trainwreck of a movie was the Captain.

In any case, don't waste your time unless incredibly bad movies tickle your funny bone.  I think I might give 'Warhead' to my mom for her birthday, but I'm pretty sure 'Armstrong' will remain our favorite.",1167177600,2,1196,4.444954128440367
