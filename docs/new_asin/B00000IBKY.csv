1219508,5,B00000IBKY,"This in an excellent true story taken from a short story piece by neurologist Oliver Sacks. I enjoy Sack's amazing true stories, so this was fascinating.

1219584,5,B00000IBKY,"Beautiful film. It takes a real life story and uses it to explore what it is that binds a lover to the beloved.  Kilmer does a fantastic job as Virgil who is blind from the time he was 3 years old and has his sight restored for a brief interval after he meets Amy, played by Mira Sorvino. The movie uses the things our culture values most, success and beauty (Amy's intense beauty and potency as a successful architect), and puts them into Virgil's world where touch and sound let him ""see"" what is real. Sorvino's acting is captivating, while the script takes us through the progression of feelings and conflicts of a developing love, it's Sorvino and Kilmer's ability to express emotion and internal conflict that makes it wonderful to watch.",1467849600,,744,4.636363636363637

Born with a cardiac eyes defects, loss sight at the age 5 and being blind without any improvement even after surgery. The title at first sight means only a few couple of months he could see. The exception is after being blind for so long, he can't read and write as a normal person could. Everything he had learned as a blind person is way different being able to function normal as a person who can see. The ending part has a happy ending, but sad. It's a must see and very interesting movie to watch with someone special.",1443571200,,621,4.408695652173913
1220488,2,B00000IBKY,Interesting plot in as much as it was based on a true story.  Mira Sorvino and Kelly McGillis turned in creditable performances.  Val Kilmer spent most of the movie grinning idiotically.  I'm just glad I didn't pay to rent this.  Overall it was a disappointing film.,1443139200,,266,4.717391304347826

While I enjoyed the premise of the movie itself, I did not enjoy seeing all the nakedness.  Since when is nakedness needed in a movie about a guy that's blind?  I don't need to see boobs.

Based on a true story, a couple learns what it is to just see and to really see what's around us.  How much do we really look?  Our eyes can lie and we can miss out on the wondrous around us if we rely only on what is right in front of us.

I was distracted by the lack of true emotion.  Actors can and should do better.",1442620800,,601,3.821138211382114

The wife (Mrs. Jennings) has a web site that she always mentions to all of us all the time that is Jenningsart.com. She always talks about making her eggs and how she paints them and stuff like that. She always reminds us that one is in the White House and another is in the Smithsonian museum. She is nice and her husband Virgil (who is blind) is nice too, but what is so funny is how neither her nor her husband look like Val Kilmer or Mira Sorvino. They could have never looked or acted like either one of the Actors.
  Mrs. Jennings is constantly making reprints of pictures of Val Kilmer and Mira Sorvino's visit to there house a couple of years ago. Everyone I know who has worked at the store I work at has at one time been in possession of one of the pictures because Mrs. Jennings loves to make copies of them and pass them out. I guess it was her 15 minutes, and she's gonna spread it out into 1500 more. :). They are both good people I guess, but my main point here is how I experienced first hand how ""hollywood"" and most of the entertainment business can't stop ruining good stories. They refuse to belive that real life can be interesting. Instead they have to cast two well know actors to play two people who are nothing like them. They just want to sell sell sell. Which I guess isn't such a bad thing except there comes a point in time where everything becomes diluted and worn out and that is when people start looking for something real, and I hope it's soon because if I see another weird Tom Cruise movie or another remake of an old classic like the Spider Man or Scooby Doo movie that has just come out, I think I will just stop watching television and stop going to the movies all together.
  Thats all.
  Thanks.

1220532,1,B00000IBKY,"Well I'd lie if I said other-wise.  I like almost all of the Val Kilmer movies except this one.  It sort of dragged, and  wern't very happy durring the whole thing.  It's a drama I know, but I guess I was dissapionted.  It was dark and gloomy, and always raining.  Of course that was a big part of the story but I hate drissles.  I won't go so far as to say it was disgustingly boring, but it was close.  Too close, so do what-ever, just don't say I didn't warn ya.",990489600,,465,3.9782608695652173
1220533,5,B00000IBKY,"Yes, this is a very emotional movie and I believe it was based on a true story. If you watch this movie on the surface, you may actually agree with some of the other reviews. If you look deeper into the story, this is about two people who awaken from a sleep. One from blindness and the other from unawareness.

Amy (Mira Sorvino) has a stressful job and seeks refuge at a spa. There she meets Virgil (Val Kilmer) who not only helps her relax, he helps her view the world differently. Amy becomes very attracted to Virgil. His blindness is not a barrier between them because they find that they relate to one another on a much deeper level.

Amy wants Virgil to try to regain his site and miraculously his site is restored. The only question is....how long will it last?

This movie deals with some deep issues which I rarely see brought to the screen. We rarely look up at the sky in our busy lives. We take so much for granted. What this movie succeeds in doing is making you realize how much there is in your life to truly be grateful for. Mira Sorvino is such a delightful actress and it was a treat to see Val Kilmer in a romantic movie. I think romance suits them both.

You will cry for most of the movie. It is really emotional. Sometimes you want to feel deeply and sometimes you want to laugh. This movie will make you feel as deeply as any movie can.

The next time it rains, close your eyes and listen. You will be amazed at how much you don't hear when you see the rain.

1220554,1,B00000IBKY,"this movie is not a good movie! Lifetime may, possibly, have less bathetic movies than this one! There is no genuine care displayed between the characters, it's a movie that comes off way too much as only that, just a  movie, and a sappy one at that! It's like, I continue to watch the movie  because you feel sympathy for Mira's and Val's characters but you  constantly wonder why you're feeling sympathy because there is no depth to  their characters, they're paper cut and far too Hollywoodish! I read one  review that was commenting on Val's weird grin that he displayed through  the whole movie, I concur, and it was very annoying! I thought to myself:  just because this guy is blind why then, therefore, does he have to have a  speech impediment?  Is that really necessary? Was his weird speaking  pattern and bizzare smirk really necessary? Indeed, both of these actors  have played in much better movies than this!

1220555,4,B00000IBKY,"Superbly acted by Kilmer (""Real Genius"" et al.), Sorvino, and McGillis, the principle detraction is the sometimes slow-moving drama which derives from the nature of the story itself.  Almost worth seeing just for  Virgil's observations at the end: ""It wasn't that seeing was so bad- I  saw a lot of things. Some were really beautiful; others were scary. Some  things I'm already forgetting- a particular look in a pair of eyes...  clouds... those images will stay with me long after the light fades. As a  blind man, I think that I see better than I did while I was sighted.  Because I don't really think we see with our eyes. I think we live in  darkness when we don't look at what's real about ourselves, about others,  or about life. I think no operation can do that. And when you see what's  real about yourself, you've seen alot, and you don't need eyes for  that.""",961718400,3,870,4.548387096774194

1220563,4,B00000IBKY,"First of all...I really liked it! Only in the late 90's can you create a movie about two stalkers who have such audience appeal that you are hoping they both succeed in the end. Matthew Broderick and Meg Ryan are excellent  as jilted lovers who through a strange twist of fate come together to  literally ""stalk"" their former partners.
Now this film is not a  ""how to"" movie, but if you wanted to be a funny stalker, then  check out some of the things that these two pulled off in an attempt to get  even. Now I didn't look too closely at the credits to see if the screenplay  was written by a former member of President Richard Nixon's 72' campaign,  but the ""dirty tricks"" they pull off would even impress him. I  won't give you any more details except to say that I loved the park  encounter scene with Tcheky Karyo and his follow-up explanation to Kelly  Preston...one of the funniest scenes you will ever see.
If you are  wondering how do you keep a movie like this going for two hours...well  don't worry, they do it and you are glad they did. It is definitely one of  the funnier films this year....and in a weird sort of way provides all  those persons who have ever been jilted unfairly...a fair way of getting  even.

I just started to watch it to kill the boring time. Then, I found myself got into  it so much and was really impressed by the acting of Val Kilmer.  It must  be very difficult to act as a blind person, but he did a very good job. My  one criticism is to the actress.  She was cute and tried hard, but I wanted  to feel from her something more substantial.  I felt she was not using her  energy completely yet.  As a result, this heroine looked for me a simple,  princess type of woman, who really did not have passion to make things work  out between them when they had problems.  Since I felt Val Kilmer's acting  was very strong and energetic, her, kind of prissy acting looked to have  made the entire atmospher of this movie a bit less substantial (or should I  say ""made it a fancy""?).
