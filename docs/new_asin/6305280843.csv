1009118,3,6305280843,"already a good case against this flick as it falls within the rash of knock-off ""don't answer/look/open""  movies which hit the scene in the late '70's - but this movie actually holds its own with some considerable sickness and a generally depraved attitude.  The lead character doesn't smile once through the whole flick and hardly winces as he torches poor girls in his custom-made incinerator.  Not much gore unfortunately other than some burnt bodies but this film is so humorless it makes up for the lack of grue in its mean-spiritedness.  A kid abused by his mom (over the range-top burners of course) grows up to obsess about her (a la Psycho) and then take his revenge out against the innocent.  A couple good jumps here and there - all in all a quality flick.  Probably would have given it 4 stars but the DVD has absolutely nothing in the way of extras: full-screen, 2 (!) chapters, and thats it.",1032393600,9,905,4.625

1009121,1,6305280843,"I bought this dvd & was very disapointed with the whole film in general. The films about a young man called Donny Kohler who as  a kid was  abused by his mother, who latter on in life takes his revenge out on a some  young ladies by leading them into his old house, then burning them to  death( it's there own fault for being stupid enough to go into this house  with a total stranger who ther've only known for about five minutes). I  nearly feel asleep half way through this film because it's to slow. Most  dvds come with some extras this doesn't come with any not even ""scene  select"".

1009122,1,6305280843,"This a low budget horror film with Dan Grimaldi starring as a guy who takes the women who he meets to his large old house and burns them in a metal room. Similar to Hitchcock's Psycho in ways with the house looking  similar, but it doesn't deserve to be mentioned at all in association with  that classic film. It is cheap and trashy,  but also unintentionally  amusing at times. If you like low budget slaher flicks check it out. I have  to say though the DVD transfer is terrible. Forget any extras, it doesn't  even have a menu, the film immediately begins when you insert the disc, and  there is only two chapters, which means you have to search through half the  film to find a particular scene. A very poor effort. The rating of one star  is for the DVD.",952646400,6,760,4.333333333333333

I have spent most of my life watching horror films and this one is perfectly brain dead just the way I like them.  I normally only watch them if they are one or two stars, and I was really skeptical about this movie being perfect with a whole three stars.  Instead of stars movies like this need to have a rating based upon the number of times a person says ""don't go in there, don't do that, and it's a bad idea to separate"".  The plot was average as horror films go which is what I was hoping for.  What I didn't expect is that the main actor was actually pretty good.

What really got to me while watching the film is the way women are treated throughout...women being kidnapped and set on fire....thats pretty extreme, I'm a women by the way so that really dug deep, and let alone knowing that there are men like that out there walking the streets.

A factory worker who keeps his dead mother in his house is haunted by voices and his abusive childhood and begins to make his young female victims experience his nightmares. The main antagonist isn't quite as fun or frightening as Norman Bates, but he is just as weird and crazy.

1009589,5,6305280843,"Why did it take this long for me to finally appreciate a Horror flick like this!?  I already know that answer.  I remember buying a copy of this on an old  ex-rental vhs some years back when I was a teenager.  At the time, I didn't have much patience for it and quickly fast forwarded through most of it because I thought it was boring not see non-stop carnage.  Boy, was I clueless or what about this kind of Horror. Haha.  Well, after several years later and having seen many Horror flicks, I ran across the Shriek Show edition (nice edition by the way), of 'Don't Go in the House' and thinking, ""I have to buy this!  I actually need to give this flick a chance now that I've enjoyed a lot of Horrors reaching from extreme to tame to serious to silliness.""  After watching 'Don't Go in the House', I was shocked at how creepy and sleazy this film is; I LOVE IT!!!

The story is simple.  A mean and evil mother tortures her son during his childhood years.  Now he's grown up, his mother, whom he still lives with, has just died and now the son, being somewhat disturbed, really goes of the deep end!  Starts hearing those pesky, evil, little voices in his head that tell him to seek revenge on his mother by killing other women.  The way he fixes up one of the rooms in his house for his mother's punishment, is sick and disturbing!  How he murders these women is truly brutal.  Images of those charred corpses stayed in my head for awhile.  Besides the one nasty, long scene that people like to point out, I found a couple more jaw dropping scenes!  I compare Joseph Ellison's 'Don't Go in the House', a lot to William Lustig's 'Maniac'.  I find it interesting that both films were put out in same year, 1980.  It's the same situation with 'The Burning' and 'Madman'.  Those two came out in the same year.  But I'm not sure if Mr. Ellison and Mr. Lustig had to rush their film to be made because of news being leaked as what happened with 'The Burning' and 'Madman'.  If you enjoy films such as: 'Maniac', 'PIECES', 'Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer' and even 'Psycho', than 'Don't Go in the House' should fit right in.",1266969600,9,2123,4.348600508905853

1009592,2,6305280843,"Quentin Tarantino is said to be a fan of this movie, but - apart from one infamous scene - I can't understand why.  Don't Go in the House is pretty much your typical, 1970s-era, cheap drive-in horror feature that promises little and doesn't over-deliver on those promises.  (Is it just me, or are all 70s horror films plagued with dark, dirty prints?  Can't someone do something to clean these things up a little bit?)  I did learn one thing from the film, though.  Apparently, back in 1979, you could go into a gun/camping shop and buy a flamethrower and flame-resistant suit - with no background check or anything.

This is the story of a lad named Donny (Dan Grimaldi).  Like most young men and women, Donny goes a little crazy the first time he gets out from under his mother's thumb: jumping on furniture, turning up the stereo, and bringing girls back to his place for some fun.  Unfortunately, Donny is about thirty years old and a total nutjob, leaves his dead mother sitting in the chair she died in upstairs, and he is not the least bit interested in the kind of games men and women normally play.  We learn early on that he has a sick fascination with flame because he just stands there and watches as one of his co-workers at the incinerator stupidly catches himself on fire.  Thanks to a childhood flashback, we soon learn the source of this fascination - and, frankly, it makes it pretty hard to disagree with the voices in Donny's head that tell him his dead mother was evil.  The next thing you know, old Donny manages to entrap a fairly attractive woman into getting into his truck and stopping by to meet his mother.  Bad mistake.  Remember the flamethrower and heat suit I mentioned earlier?  Yep, you guessed it.  Let us pause here and linger on this film's singular moment and only real claim to fame.  It's a fantastic scene that deserves a place in the cinematic annals of horror and gore; surprisingly graphic, especially for its time, it is Donny's demeanor and the silence of the act that makes it so effective and memorable.  If Don't Go in the House is worth watching at all, it is for this one scene.

The rest of the film is pretty predictable and ends just as you knew it would all along.  Of course, no one will be allowed to leave the theatre during the thrilling disco suit-buying scene and no one could possibly want to enter the theatre during the equally memorable disco dancing scene.  Throw a little unnecessary epilogue on the end in an effort to make a statement (or not), and you're done.  It should be obvious that only dedicated horror fans will wring the first drop of enjoyment out of the experience.",1223164800,2,2646,4.540084388185654
1009593,5,6305280843,"The 1970's was an optimum year for horror films in almost every country in the world. From a social stand-point you could blame A LOT of things on why there were so many violent and shocking films, but personally I'd have to say that directors back then just knew how to bring chills up your spine. Such is actually the case in Don't Go in the House, a bizarre little low budget psychological horror/character study film about a quiet, little guy who was tortured as a kid by his mother using fire and the night his mother dies he just... snaps.

One thing I find interesting about Don't Go in the House is that it's NOT a Slasher film; in fact there's little Slasher film about it. There isn't even any blood! Well okay, one nose bleed, but that's literally it. The movie isn't trying to scare you with bodily fluids, it goes a completely different angle and DAMN does it work... The killer isn't some goofy super man in a mask or wearing flamboyant colors, he's a normal, ordinary guy. If anything makes him stand out from the crowd it's the simple fact that he tends to be a pretty snappy dresser (nice disco duds). His methods of murder are closer to realism, too. He doesn't go on random kill-sprees in populated areas that just HAPPEN to be isolated, he doesn't hunt, he lures. He lures women into his house, knocks them out and then... guhhh, ick... he INCINERATES them... That may not sound creepy, but the way the bodies are made in the film they look pretty realistic.

Of course, the small budget on this title shows immensely. There aren't too many notable performances save for maybe the main character, the main character's friend and one cute drunk girl (""It's a bar, dummy!""). Oh, and the main character's boss, but he was only in three scenes. The rest of the acting is mediocre at best and some of the dialogue can be grating at times... did they really have to compare idiocy to homosexuality?

One particular issue with the movie is the film is down right misogynistic. There are few females who aren't antagonized in the film either they be shoppers or mothers... in fact the only really nice ones were the killer's victims, attempted or murdered! Also, the ending didn't have much of an impact, it felt like one of those 'yeah, right' moments in attempt to insert last minute social commentary.

Despite all this though, the movie has got a very creepy atmosphere. The soundtrack actually helps a lot in establishing the dormant fear and some of the notes even give the implementation of heat. One thing I admire about the film is that the movie seems to remember that the main character is a homicidal killer; despite his evident point of childhood trauma, we're not fed any further information beyond that point and it is all left to the imagination. If anything, I felt the tie in to his childhood punishment being religious to be a bit of a cop-out, but I know for a fact it could've been a lot more hammy than that (at least no stupid mystical cult is fueling it... I  hate it when serial killer based media does that). Even better is that you can hardly hear what the voices in his head are saying and they rarely make sense... it's almost like you're LITERALLY hearing what he hears.

So, if you have the room for it, get it because Don't Go in the House is one of those strange little gems of a horror film that has a lot going for it in atmosphere and originality.",1210550400,3,3395,4.4943273905996755
1009594,4,6305280843,"Back when I was a small child in the mid 70's, Horror movies expectedly frightened me. Big time. Even movie trailers on the TV would have me running into another room. But by the time I reached ten or eleven something happened, my Dad got us cable. There I was barraged by uncut Horror classics running 24 hours a day, on several channels, and I couldn't escape. Nor did I want to.

One of the first then-modern day Horror films I saw there was 1980's Don't Go In The House. While films like Halloween and Friday The 13th were already made by the time this movie came out, it was this movie with it's strange feel & it's one shocking scene that stuck in my head for years to come. Now after one completely botched earlier DVD release, Horror King Wannabe's Shriek Show has released the film in a special edition that may have you asking was it worth it in the first place?

Starring Dan Grimaldi, who eventually would go to play key-character Patsy Parisi in The Sopranos throughout it's entire run, this film is about Donald Kohler, a young man tortured throughout his life by his smothering & abusive mother. During a key moment in his youth, his mother punishes him for having ""impure thoughts"" by holding his arms above a burning flame. Eventually it's this flame that warps his mind and leads him down his insane murderous path. As a man, he has a job as a garbage man incinerator operator (surprised?). One day he sees a co-worker catch on fire and instead of helping him, he just stands there mesmerized by the flames and goes home. But at home he discovers that his mother has died in her sleep, and he's finally free of her...or is he? But in true ""Psycho"" fashion, he decides to not tell anyone, keep the body (not without a payback first), and live out his dark burning fantasies. After seeing a flamethrower with full uniform in a shop window (not the usual window shopping affair), he brings it home, sets up a steel wall plated room in he and his mother's huge creepy old-style house, and lets the revenge begin.....

DGITH is NOT a superb film. In fact at times it's slow, Grimaldi's acting is as stiff as his victims, and for a Horror film doesn't have many scenes that would qualify it, especially in this day and age. But it's it one redeeming yet deplorable scene involving Donny's first female victim in gruesome detail that in my opinion makes this film memorable. For 1980 I don't think a film ever went this far into what we now would now consider ""torture porn"", yet miles away in degree of what we'd see a just few years later. Without it, the movie would probably be pretty much a waste of time to all but the most dedicated Horror fanatic.

And I think that's why Shriek Show has given this film the ""golden"" treatment. Originally released back on DVD in 1999 with a terrible 4:3 picture and no menus to boot, this time it gets a new 1.85:1 presentation that looks miles ahead of it's original, yet not without it's flaws. While the color quality and high bitrate are excellent, the master still has print damage that was not corrected, but considering how it was made to begin with, it should be forgiven. Also are a new commentary by Grimaldi, an 11 minute video interview with him, trailers, and one interesting yet unadvertised feature called ""Hidden Behind The Matte"". Y'see, even though the cinematographer insisted that this DVD release be shown in it's ""original"" ratio, certain scenes seem more appropiate in the 4:3 format. So what Shriek has done is give you those two scenes in that format here as well. One being the most famous scene now being shown in it's full in-the-buff glory, the other the disco hall one that just shows now the discoballs on the ceiling. But these are from the 4:3 master and remind you just how bad this film once looked. So for extras, this movie's on fire!

Oh and by the way, this film has one Easter Egg, and I'll be happy to give it to you! Choose ""Extras"" from the main menu, then go all the way down until you highlight ""Main"", then press up to highlight a yellow button in the shape of the original movie poster's image in the upper right hand corner (be careful though, once you highlight it you can't get out of it without playing the Egg or pressing ""Top Menu"" on your remote.). There you will see the film's Ad Sheets, newspaper advertisements. Not the greatest Easter Egg, but yeah, this Disc has them too!

Overall, this film has stuck with me ever since that midnight showing over twenty years ago. It hasn't aged well, in fact it's disco scenes seems more dated than Xanadu! But to a fan of 80's early Horror, it's it's one shocking scene that puts it on the bloody map. As a whole not so much, but still worthy of a watch to see where films like Saw & Hostel may have received it's inspiration.",1208217600,20,4777,4.478760045924225
1009616,2,6305280843,"Don't Go in the House is a mixture of a psychological thriller and the basic premise of a slasher film, but don't go in expecting to see a slasher flick. By no means is this one, it just has the basic set up of one. If anything the best comparison would be a little bit of Psycho and a little bit of William Lustig's Maniac.

Don't Go in the House gets off to a fairly good start and was quite interesting in my opinion, but after the first murder scene things begin to slowly fall a apart and it goes from a good movie to an average movie that never is able to get off the ground. The biggest problem is the lack of on screen kill scenes. After the first one, which was an excellent scene, but due to the character being a total idiot some suspense is lost, but it's an excellent scene that's built up well and pays off with death by flamethrower.

But after that Don't Go in the House starts to get messy with some weak editing. The 2nd kill scene has a good set up. A woman whose car has broken down accepts a ride from Donny Kohler played by Dan Grimaldi, than in the very next scene its back at his house and we see him with her burnt body. That's pretty much the way the movie plays out with the murder scenes, which would have been ok had the movie been stronger.

The screenplay written by Joseph Ellison, Ellen Hammill and Joseph R. Masefield starts off well enough with some good insight into the mind of the villain, but there comes a point to where the story never moves forward and in a sense it feels like the same scene is playing out over and over again. The basic premise even at the time wasn't exactly original a guy with mother issues is hardly anything knew in film, but it is an interesting idea, but again there comes a point to where the story stops and we have the same scene played out over and over again.

Director Joseph Ellison works well with a limited budget and overall does deliver a mostly well made movie, but his scenes just seem to fall flat, which can be more placed on the script rather than his direction. There isn't much in the way of suspense since everything mostly happens off camera and it actually feels like there was something missing. The first murder though was mostly well done, but like I said the character was just so stupid not only does it lose suspense, but the sympathy is also lost. Overall Ellison does a pretty good job, but the shortcomings of the script are what do this one in.

Dan Grimaldi does an excellent job as the tormented Donny Kohler; while his line delivery can be a little weak in some spots, he does have the mannerisms down pat and that helps elevate his performance. Donny was an interesting character in the sense he was sympathetic, but also very pathetic. We learn a great deal about how his character was psychically and mentally abused by his mother so in that sense he is sympathetic, but he's just really sad and pathetic as well and Grimaldi works well in getting that across on screen.

Despite the 2-star rating Don't Go in the House isn't a terrible film, but it's just a bit lackluster, while it does have it's moments it just never reaches its full potential. This will probably appeal to some, but you're better skipping and watching William Lustig's Maniac instead.",1205712000,5,3261,4.364085667215815

The scenes of women getting stripped and torched up into flames, the whole abusive mother theme AND the scene in the disco where the protagonist's would be dance partner gets it upside the head with glass candle holder can't be argued as anything but misogynistic.  However, I also picked up on the underlying homoeroticism (for this I bump my rating up a star) that runs throughout the film involving the protagonist and his co-worker.

1009622,2,6305280843,"""Don't Go In The House"" is one of the cheaper than average offerings from that golden 1980's splatter movie era when every other horror film released was either about a notable diary date (Halloween, Friday the 13th , Mother's Day, April Fools Day etc), a summer camp or similar remote location full of teenagers (The Burning, Sleepaway Camp, Terror Train), or a warning (Don't Look In the Basement, Don't Answer The Phone, etc).

We're in the third category with this 1980 effort and its pretty low down in both quality and integrity. Dan Grimaldi plays Donny, a troubled loner whose outward social clumsiness masks a far more serious mental instability. After a painful childhood, spent being cruelly tortured by his mother, Donny suddenly finds himself rid of her when she expires due to old age and/or sickness in their lonely and remote home. His happiness at the new found freedom is shortlived however, because something is whispering in his head, and its telling him to kill...

Grimaldi handles the role of Donny fairly well, although there doesn't really seem to be a lot of depth to his performance, so you might be forgiven for expecting a pretty mundane movie as a result of watching his behaviour in the first 20 minutes of the film. Except for the first time that Donny manages to lure a young woman back to the isolated house, because what follows on from this initial set up one of the most repulsive murders I have ever seen in an 80's slasher movie. It involves a clearly terrified naked woman being hung from chains in a vertical position and then set alight with an industrial flame thrower...the effect is callous, shocking and hard to shake off for the rest of the film. Which is probably just as well because there isn't really a lot going on for the remaining hour. Donny remains among mainstream society and we have to follow him as he buys new outfits and goes to a happenin' disco with some work colleagues, which drags on a bit before Donny finally has another fire-related flip-out. After a bit more not very gripping amateur investigation, the climax of the film sees how Donny meets his final fate, and things end on a suitably grim note.

But as I said nothing really matches the deeply unpleasant first murder scene, so file this along with ""The Toolbox Murders"" as another low budget shocker that somehow managed to strike a nerve with one graphic murder but still remains forgettable for most of the rest of the time. It does however leave room for a (thankfully never-realised) sequel, plus it closes with a great disco number playing over the credits (""Boogie Lightning""!), and that's something you can't say about many 80's slashers!",1147132800,5,2672,4.766738660907127

A slasher film about a victim of child abuse (Dan Grimaldi) who grows up to become a maniacal construction worker. He stalks women at discos, takes them home, then hangs them upside-down in a special steel-walled room and sets them on fire in an attempt to forget about his abusive mother who seems to haunt him from beyond the grave.

[good things]

The things I liked in this film weren't really at all unique. The movie did have aspects of movies like Psycho (which seemed to be more than inspired by) and Deranged. The movie did serve a few really good kills and some really disturbing moments, all of which really fell flat because of the lack lustre' script. The most disturbing death had to be the kill where he strung the lady up and torched her, for some reason that's the one that really sticks in my mind.

[the bad]

The movie starts off really slow, and never really picks up. Even for the era of the movie, it still seems really tame. The acting, wasn't at all bad, and the script was well written. But, key moments in the film fell limp because of the director's inability to deliver the chair-jumping blow. The movie was just missing a alot of what I look for in a slasher movie, or even a haunted house movie-- which the movie was more a hybrid of both.

[final thoughts]

When I bought this movie for $3 used from Amazon.com, I didn't expect much at all. It took me almost a full year to actually get around to watching it and to tell you the truth it took me a few days to finish it. I just could not get into it. Some parts of the movie had me on the edge of my seat and five minutes later I was bored to sleep. The score does nothing for the film, and may as well not be there. So much better could have been done with it that could have made the movie easier to watch.

1009729,3,6305280843,"Prior to watching Don't Go into the House (1980) I was expecting a real cinematic bumcake, based on some of the reviews available, but in my efforts to see every film every made (it's slow going, to be sure), I continued forward into the celluloid morass of the unknown (and often idiotic)...co-written and directed by Joseph Ellison, the film features the debut of Dan Grimaldi (The Junkman), probably most known for his later role as Pasquale 'Patsy' Parisi on the popular cable show `The Sopranos', and looks a heck of a lot like the character of Mike Damone, played by actor Robert Romanus, from the film Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982).  As far as the rest of the cast, well, for most this was their one and only credited on-screen appearance as apparently Hollywood did not break down any doors in a mad recruiting drive after the film was released...

At the outset of the film we see burning trash, which might have some symbolic reference (or perhaps portentous warning) to the film about to be seen, but I girded my loins and settled in...anyway, it's around this time we meet Donald `Donny' Kohler, and he works at what appears to be some sort of municipal incinerator (hence the burning trash).  After a co-worker gets a lesson as to why fire and aerosol cans don't mix (Donny witnessed the accident, yet did nothing which caused him to suffer the ire of his supervisor), Donny leaves work and arrives to a large, slightly secluded, certainly decrepit house he shares with his mother, who, in fact, has taken ill with a slight case death sometime since Donny left for work.  Initially Donny seems distraught, but then his mood changes for the better because, as we learn later through flashbacks, Donny's mother was a real authoritarian type when Donny was younger, administering harsh punishment when she deemed necessary...and the punishment seemed to have left some very deep psychological issues (along with some large, physical scars), ones that fermented and eventually erupted into Donny covering the inside of one of the rooms in the house with metal plating (I think I saw Bob Villa do that once on `This Old House') and luring young, sometimes inebriated, ladies over as he hosts his own, private BBQ, wearing a fire retardant suit and brandishing a flamethrower (I'd be interested to know where he got one of these, as they're not a normally stocked item at the army-surplus stores) all the while having vocal arguments with his now decaying mother (dude, you'd best get into the ground before the flies come).  After awhile the socially inept and awkward Donny tries to stop his peculiar behavior of immolating others, but his attempt to fit into normal society ends badly as his date gets the business end of a lit candle in the kisser...ouch!  Given this dismal failure Donny arrives in Wacky Town, Population: Himself, and takes up the old, comfortable ways again...

My first thought after watching this film was that it was a pretty obvious dupe job of the Alfred Hitchcock classic Psycho (1960)...and it is, but it does have a few things going for it...and a lot going against it...the three worst aspects, in no particular order...the story, the script, and the acting...the simplistic story offers little in the way of originality, and suffers from a great deal of weakness, like a poorly built house of cards.  Yeah, okay, he's got the bad wiring in his head and it makes him do bad things...that's half the people I know...I wasn't expecting a masterpiece, but a little more meat on the bone would have been nice.  And then there's the script...it's passable, but not by much, and combined with the stilted delivery of the actors, created an uncomfortable sensation, one not meant to be inherent in the film...it was like watching a grade school production and the children would keep forgetting their lines...I haven't seen any of Grimaldi's recent work, but I'm assuming he got better at his craft.  His acting wasn't so bad, that is until he was tasked to try and emote a little, like when his character was suffering some sort of mental anguish...then the pain came through (for the viewer).  The direction was adequate, but it seemed like Ellison tried to get artsy by throwing in a number of angled shots, possibly meant to heighten tension, but more so causing one to realize it for what it was, someone trying to copy what they've probably seen in other, better films.  And what was the point of that lengthy scene with Donny and the effeminate clothing salesman while Donny was interested in purchasing new threads for his date?  Was that supposed to go anywhere?  The salesman was kind of funny in a stereotypical sort of way, but other than that...given this was the first film for many involved, I'm really not in the mood to overly trash this pic, especially since it did feel like there was some effort involved.  So what did I like about the film, you ask?  There were a couple of decent scares, like the one involving some cheap, but decent special effects with regards to the first girl Donny brings home and also on the make-up of the charred dead girls, which Donny kept in a separate room, dressed up in his mother's clothes.  The main setting for the film, the large, old house, was suitably creepy and used fairly well.  There are a few scenes to watch for including the one with the girl from the flower shop (who actually gets full on nekkid), the one in the disco where Donny abruptly ends the date, and the one with the nosey priest who gets a taste of the hot stuff.  The one thing that annoyed me the most was the lame ending...had they ended the film when they should have (if you've seen it you know what I mean), everything would have been alright...but no, they tack on this silly, unnecessary scene I've seen numerous times before...all in all, there was potential here for something a little better, but the end result is lacking.

The full screen picture quality on this Liberty International Entertainment release looks no so hot, but if you maintain a distance of three to four feet from the screen, it will do...there's white specks, graininess, artificing, etc. but no so bad the movie is unwatchable.  The audio comes through pretty well.  There are no special features, and there isn't even a menu, as the film begins when the DVD is placed in the player.  There are all of two chapter stops.  I'd give this release 2  stars.

I know a crappy film when I see it, and I don't hesitate to say so. This film, however, surprised me. I was expecting another cheapo chopped full of bad acting, lousy special affects, and crummy music. This has none of those things. It's actually quite interesting, though it does borrow some story elements from Psycho, and films like it.

Donny is a troubled young man whose mother used to punish him by holding his arms over the burners of the kitchen stove. As a result, he has grown up into a bit of a fire bug. We find this out right off the bat, when in the beginning of the film, we see him freeze at work when he sees a coworker burst into flames as the result of a boiler explosion. His sanity takes a turn for the worst when his mother dies. Now alone, and with no one to keep tabs on his actions, he begins the fun little task of inviting dumb women back to his house so that he can beat them over the head, hang them in the basement, and then barbecue them alive with a blowtorch. This method of doing away with victims was probably very unique at the time, and I don't know of any films that have used this idea since. Fairly gruesome!

The acting in this film is halfway decent, and the subtle music does a good job of complimenting the feeling of loneliness and paranoia that the protagonist feels throughout. Not a bad flick, even if it is a little bit unrealistic.",1095724800,,1543,4.317241379310345

1009732,3,6305280843,"""Don't Go In The House"" is one of those classic drive-in clunkers from the 1970s and early 1980s fondly remembered by fans of low budget horror/exploitation films. Why anyone would hide in the trunk of car in order to spend nearly two hours watching this cinematic drudge is beyond me. At the same time, watching in the privacy of my own home on DVD was a good experience, so maybe there is a reason or two for risking the inhalation of exhaust fumes in order to watch this horror movie. Apparently, filmmaker Quentin Tarentino had plenty of good things to say about this film, so that may provide another reason for movie buffs to rent or buy this 1980 Psycho rip off. ""Don't Go In The House"" continued the tradition established by other ""Don't..."" films, such as ""Don't Look In The Basement"" and the like. This movie stars people you have never heard of, and its directed, produced, and written by a few other people you've never heard of or from again. Sure, star Dan Grimaldi turned up on ""The Sopranos"" and in a bit part in the film ""Crooklyn,"" but the people who associated themselves with this film are not pulling down big buck salaries in Hollywood these days.
Dan Grimaldi stars as Donald ""Donny"" Kohler, a momma's boy who works at some sort of a heavy industrial plant when he isn't home tending to his mother's needs. We learn immediately that something isn't quite right with Donny when a guy at the plant catches on fire and Don does nothing to help him. Understandably, this odd behavior aggravates most of the other workers at the plant with the exception of Bobby, a rather friendly bloke who cheats on his wife and who calls Donny on the phone at weird times. These tentative maneuvers to establish camaraderie between the two never find an explanation in the film. In fact, the script gives us little clue as to what is going on in Donny's mind (at least initially). We do know that Mom was some sort of religious despot who burned Donny's arms when he was a child for some supposed transgression. But now Mom is dead, found moldering in a chair up in her room when Donny comes home from work. Whatever will Donald do now that his freedom from domineering old Mum is over? The first thing he does is smoke in the house and crank up the old stereo! Donald knows how to live, but very quickly after discovering Mom upstairs Donald starts to hear voices in his head instructing him to commit grisly crimes.
Kohler runs with these suggestions by turning one room of the sprawling house into a metallic death chamber complete with chains and hooks. Throw in a fire retardant suit and a flamethrower and you get the strong impression that Donald's interests run to indoor barbecues of a most peculiar character. It isn't long after completing this project that Kohler brings his first victim to the house, a foxy '70's gal who promptly finds herself tied up in the room. The following scene, when Donald douses this woman in gasoline and then lights her up, does possess a certain gruesome fascination and probably constitutes the bulk of this movie's notoriety. Our hero rapidly follows up with two further victims, then dresses up the three corpses in old clothes and sits them in chairs in another room of the house. During the rest of the film, Kohler occasionally revisits this room to learn that the corpses torment him with voices only he can hear. All the while, Mom remains upstairs in her chair and Bobby continues to place odd phone calls to his friend in an attempt to get Donny to go out for a night on the town. Throw in a priest, a tepid dream sequence, and some cheesy disco scenery, and a ""shock"" ending and you have the makings of a low budget classic destined to win over new legions of fans (!).
""Don't Go In The House"" would be a complete rip off of Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" if it possessed any of the wonderful attributes that made that Anthony Perkins/Janet Leigh vehicle such an enduring institution. Instead, we get bad acting, terrible dialogue, bad cinematography, cheesy special effects, and poky pacing. I think I counted at least five separate times where the director used the same footage of Donny driving his vehicle around town. About the only thing that truly works for this film is the gritty, grim atmosphere of Donny's house. The place is spacious on the inside, but at the same time the Kohler abode looks so incredibly seedy that I felt like taking a shower after watching the movie.
The DVD version of ""Don't Go In The House"" is atrocious; it looks as though they restored the film, if any restoration took place at all, with a piece of sandpaper. Again, this lousy transfer does lend the picture a certain grimly alluring atmosphere, but for a DVD release I would like to see a better quality film. Amazingly, there are no extras on the disc to speak of: no trailer, no commentary, and no production notes. This DVD doesn't even contain a menu screen. When you put the disc in your player, it immediately goes right into the movie. I'm reminded of a VCD when I think about seeing this movie on DVD, although even VCDs have menu screens on occasion. Overall, this film does have a few things going for it, but only hardcore horror fans should apply here. If you must see ""Don't Go In The House,"" consider renting it instead of buying.",1063670400,10,5284,4.586680761099366
1009733,5,6305280843,"i'll admit it: there are some bad actors in this film.  fortunately, the lead role is ont one of them.  no humor whatsoever, this film plays out in much the same manner and style as ""maniac"" does, going for the point of view of the killer over the boring, and often far too broken, victim narratives.  there are some very gruesome slayings, particularly one involving a young, naked woman being burnt to death.  this film actually keeps the gore quotient quite low, allowing for the violence that is shown to take more of an effect upon the viewer.  and yes, as already mentioned, this movie does borrow heavily from other slashers, but then again, every slasher does: none of them are truly original in fundumental design. none the less, still a good movie, relying more upon mood, atmosphere, and tension to frighten the viewer as opposed to a high kill count.",1063152000,3,862,4.682119205298013

1009735,1,6305280843,"I saw this piece of crap in a movie theatre back in 1980 and (unfortunately) can't forget it.  A little boy is tortured by his sadistic mother by holding his hand over a flame (by the way, this is shown).  He grows up disturbed.  He picks up women, brings them home, strips them, chains them up, throws gasoline on them and them burns them to death.  We only see one killing and it's just disgusting.  Seeing a nude, screaming, chained up woman burnt to death is not my idea of a fun time. The rest of the movie is boring talk, stupid ""scary"" dream sequences and a REAL dumb ending.  Sick, sadistic, boring with a lousy script and bad acting.  That should tell you everthing you need to know.  Oh yes...there's one scene where a priest is attacked with a flamethrower.",1056499200,6,768,4.397163120567376
1009736,3,6305280843,"Quite a good film obviously based a bit on psycho keeping his dead mother in her bedroom in a rocking chair by the window, and killing naive women who just seem to go with him no questions asked. The film is basicly about a man who was abused by his mother as a young boy hands held over a hot stove,who has a morbid fascination with fire developed from it. As I said he then picks up women and takes them back to his house where he then hangs them up in a steel room and then torches them you do not see any of this its all left to imagination. The only graphic burning scene is at the start and then after this you see nothing just chared remains, he keeps the victims clothes  and he dresses his mother in them but keeps his victims bodies in a bedroom. All in all okay if you like dated 80s horror films.",1039219200,2,808,4.0186335403726705
