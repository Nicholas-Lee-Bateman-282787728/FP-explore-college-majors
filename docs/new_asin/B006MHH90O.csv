5004753,4,B006MHH90O,"This is a great strength and endurance workout system. Steve Cotter is an excellent instructor and was easy to follow. Cotter performs all the lifts in a tutorial, supplies a warmup and cooldown. Unlike some instructors, he performs all the lifts along with you while you work out. He goes a long way in supplying you with everything you need in this system except the equipment for the different lifts. Over the last 5 years I have completed P90X, P90X+, and Rushfit several times. I also have used Shadow-Jitsu and Combat Kettlebells (My Mad Methods). These are all quality workouts supplying excellent systems that merit the dedicated in different ways. None of the previously mentioned systems pushed me to the brink the way this 12 week kettlebell system did. This program is designed to push the user beyond what they thought their abilities were and what they thought their bodies would bear. The end result is explosive power and endurance for perseverance.

I agree that this system lacks a targeted chest and abdominal workout, but there are many workouts that can supplement, since this is a 3 day system. This is the only thing this system lacks.

One word of warning: this workout is not for beginners, it is a very advanced system. I reccomend Kettleguards or sweatbands for the wrists, chalk for the hands, and in the case of high rep count, weightlifting gloves. The hands take a beating, and in the beginning, so do the wrists.",1341014400,9,1444,4.818548387096774
5004754,4,B006MHH90O,"Let me say this right off the bat: Steve Cotter's Extreme Strength is not--I repeat--is not for beginners.  If you are absolutely new to kettlebell training, this is not the system for you to begin with.  Mr. Cotter says as much in the introduction.  You'd be better served with a milder instructional series to acclimate yourself to kettlebell training such as Steve Cotter's Encyclopedia of Kettlebell Lifting series or even the Skogg program.

I say this not to ward off newbies entirely but, simply put, this DVD series is for those familiar with kettlebells who are looking to take their conditioning to world-class levels (""not good shape but excellent shape"").

However, I should add that, if you are new to kettlebells, Mr. Cotter has an entire section on the introductory DVD where he goes over the form of EVERY SINGLE EXERCISE ON THE PROGRAM.  That's over two dozen exercises.  He demonstrates the form and discusses the finer points of each exercise (which he also does regularly on the workouts themselves) before you even begin the program.  I cannot say this enough: Steve Cotter is a spectacular teacher in addition to being one of the best athletes on the planet.

So, if you do disregard my advice about familiarizing yourself with kettlebells, know that there is actual point-by-point instruction and demonstration of the exercises.  Additionally, if you work according to your conditioning level, anyone can do this program.  It will challenge kettlebell neophytes as well as more seasoned practitioners.  Just remember to get the requisite clearance from your physician and start off with a fairly conservative weight.  You'll see that it won't take much to leave you in a pool of your own sweat.

I've been training with kettlebells for about five years now and came into this thinking that I knew what hard training was (having worked up to 88lb kettlebells at 200 lbs in hard form lifting).  I was quickly humbled.  Pure strength will not take you far in this program. Anyone can be strong for brief periods but, to paraphrase Bruce Lee, only the truly strong endure over time.  Be prepared to push yourself to your limits.

What Cotter emphasizes in this program is all-around conditioning: strength endurance, aerobic conditioning, anaerobic conditioning, work capacity, pure strength training, explosiveness, and flexibility.  In short, real world fitness and athleticism.  To this end, he will take you through progressively more challenging routines (18 in total) for six weeks culminating in what I like to call Hell on Earth, a short but unrelentingly brutal test of conditioning that will push you to the brink.

And then you repeat the process...but with more weight!  This will push you beyond any plateaus into a new realm of fitness and you'll reach rep counts that you never imagined possible (eg. 200+ snatches!).

Now, just to be clear, there is quite a bit of equipment suggested: several pairs of kettlebells of varying weights, a pullup/dip station, a dipping belt, a roman chair, an Olympic barbell set, and a power rack.  You might ask why you would need anything beside kettlebells for a kettlebell training program.  The answer is that, while kettlebells are magnificent tools and pound for pound the most effective training tools, they do have limitations.  Maximal strength can be increased only so much as you progress.  The heaviest kettlebells I've encountered are 100 lbs and squats with this sort of weight can be dangerous initially due to leverage and ineffective later on as your body adapts to the weight.  With barbells, the sky is the limit and the power rack will ensure that you are protected as you venture into heavier weights.  Additionally, the barbells will overload your muscles and help to make the toughest kettlebell cycles (series of repetitions) more manageable.

As for the remaining equipment, I made economical and space efficient choices where possible.  In lieu of the pullup/dip station, I simply used an old doorframe pullup bar and a collapsible Ultimate Body Press Dip Stand sold on Amazon.  Instead of purchasing a roman chair that would only be used solely for one exercise, I substituted hyperextensions with good mornings with my heavy kettlebells.  Instead of a dipping belt, I used a weighted vest that I had lying around but dipping belts are hardly expensive.

Is it cheating?  Far from it.  In fact, Mr. Cotter encourages you to adapt and customize the program to what you have on hand and your current skill/conditioning level.  He gives several kettlebell substitutes for the barbell lifts so a lack of barbells should not thwart you from purchasing this program.  In fact, I did my first cycle without barbells and still found the workout to be exceedingly effective.  (I used the three month program as an opportunity to save up for solid barbell set sold on Amazon for $269--$3 a day.)

My results:
Pullups (Day 1: 12 / Day 90: 20)
Dips (Day 1: 10 / Day 90: 21)
Resting Heart Rate (Day 1: 72 / Day 90: 64)
Women Staring at My Butt (Day 1: 0 / Day 90: several)

I sincerely wish I had this program while I was in the police academy.  I would've have finished in the top of my class!

To wrap up, here are the pros and cons.

Pros:
-Effective, no-nonsense, hard work
-Customization: Can be used by anyone--from relative newbies (once they understand kettlebell fundamentals)to more seasoned practitioners
-Progressively structured to ensure optimal results
-Thorough instruction on every exercise in the program
-Includes flexibility/stretching
-Barbells, pullups, and dips strengthen your weak points
-Only three workouts a week!
-Most workouts clock in at 35 minutes or less--they'll just seem endless while you're doing them
-Will result in a leaner, more muscular body that performs as well as it looks
-Pushes you to the brink and tests your mental toughness

Cons:
-Pushes you to the brink and tests your mental toughness
-Can require a bit of equipment as you progress
-While this may be a vain quibble, there is not much focus on chest or abdominal development per se.  That is, there is not a focus on the aesthetics of these regions; performance is the name of the game.  I do wish that he had indulged in building up the vanity muscles but I'm appreciative of the focus and relatively short sessions.

In conclusion, if you would like to attain the kind of professional level of all around conditioning that you never thought possible, then I wholeheartedly encourage you to pick up this program.  It pays for itself with the increased energy levels, lean and muscular physique, and confidence that comes from knowing that you are in supreme condition.

8500772,5,B006MHH90O,"If you're a kettlebell enthusiast you probably already know Steve Cotter. A long-time martial artist and founder of the International Kettlebell and Fitness Federation, Steve has a lot of experience under his belt that he brings to his products. One such product is his Extreme Strength! 12 Week Kettlebell Program.

The program is comprised of four DVDs, designed to be followed along like a traditional fitness DVD. The first DVD covers an introduction to the workout, how to do the workout (for example, what to do if you cant keep up), technique instruction for each of the exercises, and warm up and cool down sequences. The remaining three DVDs cover the 12-week program.

Now, as I mentioned, Steve includes what to do if you cant keep up with the workouts - and its a good thing. At the age of 41 during taping, Steve is a beast and doesnt appear to have lost a step. So be prepared to have a hard time keeping up unless you choose your weights well, which is a process he helps you through. This is largely a metcon type workout, meaning the workout features a series of weight lifting sets done in rapid succession to keep the heart rate elevated. Keeping the heart going throughout the workout is one of the cornerstones of this type of training, and although Steve regularly takes his pulse along with you, Id recommend a heart rate monitor as well.

Speaking of equipment, you will need plenty of it to get the full experience of this DVD. Although Steve provides alternative exercises that make it possible to follow along with only kettlebells, the full workout includes a pull up and dip station, a Roman chair, some plyo boxes, a barbell with weights, and a squat rack (full or half). There is other equipment, like chalk and wristbands, that is recommended but not necessary.

That said, since the workout is directed at intermediate to advanced lifters, that basic equipment may well be in your set up already. And I need to emphasize that this isn't great for beginners. Although Steve does a great job of covering exercise form, my recommendation to use this DVD at intermediate level or above has more to do with Steves pace and form. Hes a machine, and maintains excellent form throughout a type of work out that is notorious for causing form to break down. It may be difficult for beginners to use this product safely unless they use weights less than recommended and focus more on form as they go than on keeping pace.

The workout itself focuses on the primary Olympic style kettlebell lifts. The supplemental exercises, although a major component of the workout, are accessory to the main lifts being focused on, in true weightlifting style. I loved seeing him point out that too much variation in a workout is not a good thing. Its awesome to see a legit coach doing away with this muscle confusion nonsense. You may also have noticed I said the workout requires a barbell and squat rack. Steve notes the limitations of kettlebells in the video and includes a few bar lifts for the development of strength and to ease transitions between kettlebells. In this way, the program is very well thought out.

As for Steve himself, I noticed a few more little things Id like to point out that stood out to me. He is an experienced presenter, but his video presenting skills could use some polish. Its a trivial matter on a workout DVD, and he is a very likable guy on video, but worth mentioning. That said, he gives the weights of the kettlebells in both pounds and kilos, which I liked. Sometimes its the details that make the difference between a good product and a great one.

Ultimately, I really liked this product, but it isn't for everyone. Like I mentioned before, its worth looking at and modifying for beginners, but something else might suit you better. Also, although Steve includes strength development into the program, since this is aimed at experienced lifters, you aren't likely to develop much in the way of top-end strength on a program like this.

Extreme Strength! is a great product for people interested in advancing their ability to move some kettlebells around, especially in the Olympic lifting exercises. Within that framework, the program will help maintain or slightly build your strength and work on your cardiovascular ability as well, so if you like a jack-of-all-trades style workout, then this one is a great one to check out.

8500773,5,B006MHH90O,"I'm just getting going on this program and it's exactly what I'm looking for.  I've been working out and getting bored with weight lifting, always trying to change up what I'm doing to get results.  This program is going to turn me I to a machine and focus on my weak points in legs, core and flexibility counteracting the fact that i sit down all day long at work.  I find that while it is intense it is in some way easier than the other weight lifting I've done.  It easier because there is no question how many reps you are doing and you move fast enough that you don't have time to think about things like stopping or doing an extra set.  The required kettlebells are expensive especially in competition style (3-5 pairs needed).  I had been doing a lot of kettlebell swings before starting this.  I realized my snatch technic is a little weak when I ripped my hands up on the first heavy snatch day (be careful).
