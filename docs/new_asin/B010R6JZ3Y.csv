7316170,4,B010R6JZ3Y,I take away a star because WB is being selfish and only releasing a single disc at a time ....what happened to two discs on season 1?,1448841600,,133,3.962962962962963
7316171,3,B010R6JZ3Y,pure 80's cartoon fun.,1448496000,,22,4.75
7316172,5,B010R6JZ3Y,Better opening music and lots of new characters along with the ones we know and love . The Snorks were just as good as the Smurfs but never got the same recognition.,1445385600,,165,4.1875

7316174,5,B010R6JZ3Y,"I'm so proud that the second season of the Snorks is finally on DVD! with such great episodes like ""The Shape Of Snorks To Come"" where Junior gets sucked into a seaquake where he is Governor of Snorkland  and bans everyone for saying the name of All Star, I hope season three will also be release soon on DVD!",1440806400,,309,4.237288135593221
7316175,5,B010R6JZ3Y,"I love the first season of Snorks the best, but this season is just as great in its own way! The new designs look good, and there are a lot of great episodes that have great lessons, like "" don't be prejudice towards different people, ""handicapped people have great talents too"", "" be fair to your friend"" and so forth. There are some episodes where I prefer one segment instead of the other, mainly the ugly yuck fish episode, but most episodes are still a ton of fun! There are more ocean puns with their businesses, like the elevated train, and so on. They are still the same delightful characters I fell in love with! I will watch this DVD more times in the future!",1438819200,4,669,4.36

8723004,1,B010R6JZ3Y,I just wish I had ordered the chassis did not get it the second time just a collection of one and it was not as it appears in photos,1474588800,,132,3.586206896551724
8723005,4,B010R6JZ3Y,"Bought season 2, because I got the first season and I like having complete collections. The reason season 2, only has 1 disc, is because it runs about 10 episodes. The reason for 4 stars is, because it was short.",1472083200,,212,4.325

8723008,4,B010R6JZ3Y,In re-watching this show I found that it was not as bad as I remember from the 80's. While it is just a knock off of the Smurfs the show has more action and more heart then I remember.,1454371200,,184,3.7435897435897436
