8094950,5,B000C0GVVK,Highly amusing German film with English subtitles. Very enjoyable.,1458172800,,66,6.444444444444445
8094951,5,B000C0GVVK,"This is a hilarious send-up of Snow White and the 7 Dwarfs, by way of Mel Brooks and Looney Toons.  Best seen in German with english subtitles, we first stumbled upon it on Netflix (thanks, Netflix!) and our family has seen it at least four times, with ever larger groups of people ...""Wait, you HAVE to see this..."" and now my kids insist on getting the DVD so they can show it to their friends whenever they like without waiting for discs or the sometimes iffy streaming version.  It has ""naughty"" bits, with bawdy jokes and double-entendres sprinkled throughout, but delivered so over-the-top and in such a ridiculous way - easy to forgive (my kids are 15 and 11).  Nina Hagen, a famous pop/opera singer from the 1980s, is a surprise treat as the outgrageous and wicked stepmother.  Unusual fare, and well worth the adventure.",1336003200,,829,4.696551724137931
8094952,5,B000C0GVVK,"If Mel Brooks had made a ""Snow White"" movie . . . it would be pretty close to this.

My teenage kids were up late one night and caught this film - and they could not shut up about it for weeks and weeks . . so we had to buy it.

Very slapstick - very bizare - very ""cartoon-ish"" in it's pranks - and very, VERY funny.

If you want to make a movie like this - you would need to ""blend"" some Bugs Bunny cartoons, ""Robin Hood Men in Tights"", ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", a touch of Monty Python and a good does of crazy . . . or just buy this movie.",1303689600,,544,3.7130434782608694
8094953,5,B000C0GVVK,"This movie is hilarious and it is almost inconceivable as to why Universal (who distributed the film in Europe) never released a U.S. version. The version I received from Netflix was a Chinese import. Yes, it is dubbed in English. No, that's not the best of all possible worlds, but it's still a great movie and doesn't deserve to be ripped because of something the filmmakers had NO control over. I've since found an original language version on the Internet with English subtitles. The film is a bizarre, surreal updating of the Snow White story with 6 foot 'dwarfs' who have abandoned the outside world to live women-free together in the woods. Without giving too much away, Snow White appears and the story takes some familiar, and not-so-familiar turns along the way. Featuring wonderful sight-gags and visuals, and silly, over-the-top comedy, the film is a delight, but is DECIDEDLY NOT for children. I just wish I could get a copy of the sequel ""The Woods is Not Enough""...",1260403200,2,980,4.839285714285714
8094954,5,B000C0GVVK,"After seeing the sequel, we just had to see the original. Fortunately, Netflix had the DVD. Unfortunately, the DVD didn't have the German (original) version on it--it was dubbed in English, and had Chinese subtitles available. The original (this one) isn't available on Region 1 DVDs, and we don't have a region-free player. Fortunately, the dubbing was done by the actual actors, so once we got over the mouth/sound disconnect--which wasn't all that bad--Germans are experts at dubbing--it was a heck of a lot of fun.

The movie loosely tells the story of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, from the inception of the group of seven dwarves--founded as a kind of ""no gurls allowed"" club. Like the sequel, it's one silly scene after another, with a multitude of take-offs on everything from Little Red Riding Hood to board games to Lord of the Rings.

I'm sure we missed a few of the puns because of the translation & dubbing, but we laughed ourselves silly and I'm really glad we found it at all.",1227571200,,995,4.712643678160919
8094955,5,B000C0GVVK,"I watched this movie in Germany on an exchange and watched it in German with English subtitles. It was easy to follow, translated well, and made me laugh so much. I wished we had it in either English or in a USA compatible format, but nonetheless it was a great movie and I highly recommend it.",1220745600,,294,4.267857142857143
8094956,4,B000C0GVVK,"This film made me giggle and repeatedly chant ""Hey Zwerge Hey Zwerge Hey Zwerge Ho!"" for months, however I'm not sure it would translate well to English.",1155686400,,153,4.703703703703703
