The 'director' has been overhyping the film every chance he gets and now he is doing this via the fake reviews above.
Aside from the pretty pictures, there is 'zero' emotional connection to the characters in this film and this is central to a decent story. Had the director actually connected with the subjects of this film rather than bowling them over with his grandiose stories of his lavish New York City lifestyle things could have been different. Sadly they are not.
Still in doubt? The films trailer is nothing more than images with disoriented music: [...] What does that tell you? There is no story here.
The film itself was shot way back in 2001 on a small handycam in standard definition so you can imagine the lo-fi quality.
If you want to see a fresh take from an exciting new and well regarded film (The Eagle Huntress) on Kazakh culture and eagle hunting there go here[...], [...] This is a beautiful film by a passionate director done with heart and good intentions.",1468281600,,1030,4.603260869565218

Koran Over Mongolia offers us a glimpse of a world westerners can never fully know, yet leaves us with the gift that is a greater understanding for our common humanity. This film is both exotic and universal at the same time. See this film.",1452211200,3,351,4.333333333333333
