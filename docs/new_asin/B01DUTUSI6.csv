7724774,5,B01DUTUSI6,"Fantastic performance by Whitney Able! A highly intense and unique film. Great direction, cinematography and soundtrack. Arthouse horror in the vein of ""Repulsion"". Refreshingly different spin on the single character going psycho in their apartment, thriller sub-genre.",1465689600,,269,6.297297297297297

7724776,2,B01DUTUSI6,"Kate Naylor (Whitney Able) lives with her loving girlfriend (Alex Breckenridge) in NYC. It is clear Kate has all kind of issues and may be unstable. When NYC goes dark during the 2003 blackout, our authors spring into action and use this as symbolism as emotionally and mentally, Kate is in a dark place. Get it. It would be soooo Indie clever if it hadn't been done a gazillon times before.

What we don't find out is Kate's real issues as she describes her life's problem in the abstract. We hear her say these clever Indie lines like, ""I tried to be different"" and my all time favorite, worth Indie extra bonus credit ""I'm the real me."" We have a long drawn out boring scene, not to be confused with the rest of the film outside of the opening lesbian sex scene, where our yoga instructor is smoking a cigarette while talking to a guy who may or may not be there. Here she is saying lines that don't match up with her lips, i.e. she has a cigarette in her mouth while we hear her speaking. That is fine, but I don't know is this by design, i.e. a clue that the guy is not there and she is crazy, or is this some bad over dubbing because they decided to write in some lines post production.

If you like watching people buy paper towels and crazy people talking to themselves but not really saying anything, then this film is for you. I couldn't get past someone creating another artsy film and just going through the motions they learned the first day of film school.

8756906,1,B01DUTUSI6,"If you like watching movies showing endless photos on the wall, people doing absolutely nothing for the first hour and 15 minutes, a blonde girl drinking orange juice, tiresome, meaningless dialog, then this movie is for you.

8756909,4,B01DUTUSI6,"Picked this up at Walmart a couple months ago. It's a moody, psychological thriller that follows the downward spiral of Kate (Whitney Able) against a backdrop of the largest blackout in North American history. There's not a lot of dialogue, but it never feels like it's missing and when there is dialogue it's very human, reminiscent more of the style of a Mike Leigh film than a traditional scripted narrative. This film has a lot of demons and the worst of them hides in plain sight behind Kate's moody facade. Give it a whirl... and don't turn off the lights!",1480377600,,562,4.63
8756910,3,B01DUTUSI6,"Pretty boring film. The lead role really can't keep you interested in the movie.

8756913,3,B01DUTUSI6,"Whitney able is just top notch in this.  The film is acted very well by everyone. It's just marketed as horror when it really is just a psychological drama. Nothing really happens and the ending is so ubrupt it feels lazy.  I'm all for ambiguity but this pushed it.  I don't regret seeing it,  but it could have pushed the envelope so much further.  It almost played it too safe.  I would wait for netflix or prime.  Again wonderful,  oscar performance by whitney able.  Just a flat boring film with no pay off.",1465776000,2,511,4.408602150537634
