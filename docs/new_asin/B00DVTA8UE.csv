8598439,5,B00DVTA8UE,"This video document is a rare treasure! For the aficionado and for the learned scholar. If you are interested in the historical development of the flute performed in a jazz context, this is the only project that tackles that subject in a comprehensive manner. This never before attempted effort to document the emergence of the flute as a viable jazz voice is entertaining and extremely informative.  As the great masters of this genre slowly depart from us, (Wess, Lateef, etc.) Westbrook and his collection of ultra-knowledgable artist / collaborators are music scholars of the highest order infusing the subject with vitality and historical context. This is a must-have for any one interested in this subject. A couple of the archival film clips are a little out-of-focus (Rahsaan, Yusef, etc.) but for the jazz flutist, this is the best and only video of its kind!",1389312000,4,868,5.027777777777778
