7829452,5,6302670241,"This video, part of the 'American Masters' documentary series broadcast on PBS, is a somewhat revealing look into the musical life of the very private Paul Simon.
Interviews with Art Garfunkel, with Paul's brother, Eddie, comics Steve Martin and Chevy Chase, Lorne Michaels, (producer of Saturday Night Live) and members of Paul's 'Graceland' tour band give a well rounded, if one-sided view of Simon.  Paul sits for an interview that makes up about 1/4 of the video to express his views on his music, his former partership with Garfunkel, and his hit album 'Graceland'.
The most interesting part of the video is the footage of the ""Born At The Right Time Tour"". This footage reveals some of the tension that Simon and his band experienced while in S. Africa, where members of a radical political group threatened to bomb the stadium they performed in.  Simon revealed he had to make a few concessions to the group, which evident in the film, he was not pleased about.
A complete overview of Simon's career, from his beginning with Garfunkel to his last trip to S. Africa is covered. The film includes quite a bit of Paul's music and some photos that the public has not seen.
Since this is the only documentary of Simon in existence, it is the only source of 'in depth' information on him. If you are a follower of Simon's music, you probably know most, if not all, of what is covered in this video. Newcomers to Simon's work would enjoy this video. Followers of Simon don't need it, but it is a good addition to your collection nonetheless.",973987200,14,1541,4.682656826568266
