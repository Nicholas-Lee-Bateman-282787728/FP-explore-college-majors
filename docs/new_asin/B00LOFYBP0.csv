6497511,4,B00LOFYBP0,"Thom Andersen's ""Los Angeles Plays Itself"" is one of the deepest films about Los Angeles (Andersen scorns the city's LA abbreviation), that I've seen. The film clips and the depth of research that he put into the documentary makes it a must see for any film lover or historian. There are some excellent lines about the city, including ""Los Angeles is the most photographed city, but the least photogenic,"" and Robert Altman's famous line ""Los Angeles is best seen by night and from a distance.""

The most effective parts of the movie were the patterns found in films about LA - modern houses in the Hollywood hills (the Lovell House and the Frank Lloyd Wright Ennis House) are almost always where movie villains live. Most films about Los Angeles, seem to chronicle the city's original sin or fall from grace - Chinatown, L.A. Confidential, and Double Indemnity. And particularly fascinating were how audiences' perception of the LAPD changed from Joe Friday's decisive and upstanding character to the corrupt cops in L.A. Confidential after the Watts and Rodney King riots.

If the documentary falters, it's only when Andersen speaks with disdain about the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and his bemusement with European's love of L.A.'s tacky side. Andersen is a high-brow local and the ending is effective by showing the neorealistic side of Los Angeles and the natives who have made films depicting areas where Hollywood dares not tread - South Central, Inglewood, and El Segundo. Perhaps a tad moralistic at times, but overall an excellent documentary for movie buffs everywhere.",1417132800,2,1577,5.061538461538461

6497513,5,B00LOFYBP0,"Wonderful DVD!  A must-have for someone like me, who delights in Los Angeles Noir.  It came out several years ago as
a sort of home-made version.  I think it was taped by someone from a TV program.  I had this, but it was unsatisfactory.
blurry and gray.  It was never released commercially at the time because of copyright problems.  Bits and pieces of dozens of
movies are shown.
Now, evidently, all of that has been cleared up.  This new commercial version is truly excellent.  Sharp images, and contrast.

6497514,5,B00LOFYBP0,Well worth the decade-long wait.,1414540800,,32,5.6
6497515,5,B00LOFYBP0,"I highly recommend this intelligent, insightful and tremendously entertaining documentary.  For years this has been on many ""100 best documentaries
ever made"" type lists, (e.g. it's #37 on Sight and Sound's 2012 ""50 Greatest Documentaries Ever Made"" critics Poll)  and yet it's very nature (it's made entirely
hundreds of clips from almost as many different feature films) made getting the rights to release this a gargantuan task.  I'm amazed they pulled it off.
(I hope the story of that part of the film's history is covered in commentary or extra features)

In the meantime, this terrific, unique film has been relegated to occasional museum and classroom screenings, and low quality bootleg copies.
Indeed often those classroom screenings were often still off VHS tapes.  The blu-ray, while far from perfect visually, is a huge step up in quality.
Obviously the quality of the clips themselves is very variable, depending on their age and source, they range from some that look they were taken
from VHS sources, to many that are quite gorgeous - probably sourced from blu-ray masters.  There also an occasional odd jumpiness in a few
of the clips that looks like there were issues in transfers and frame rates.  This occasional stutter is annoying, but rare enough that it's far from
a deal breaker.  This is probably still the best ""Los Angeles Plays Itself"" has ever looked.

The film is a remarkable documentary, charting the history of how Los Angeles is portrayed in the movies.  In the process it
reveals much about the L.A.'s real history, it's politics, its architecture, its culture.  It shows us how how movies distort and
even create reality, the cities sense of itself altered by its on screen persona.

Smart, and never boring despite it's 2:49 running time. Often funny, with a dead-pan, witty narration constantly helping us see both films and the city in new ways.

If you love films, or have an interest in how cinema intersects with real life -- each effecting the other, this is a can't miss experience.

Update: Cinema Guild, which put out this film now has announced it will also distribute Anderson's almost equally effective
""Red Hollywood"" (made in a similar way - full of clips - so never before available).  That too is a terrific, if slightly less heralded film,
and is now available for pre-order here on Amazon, or directly from the Cinema Guild web site.",1413244800,10,2389,4.922693266832917
6497516,5,B00LOFYBP0,"Dorothy Parker famously said that Los Angeles was seventy-two suburbs in search of a city. Los Angeles has also been one city in search of a documentary, and ""Los Angeles Plays Itself"" (not to be confused with ""L.A. Plays Itself"") is finally that. This literate, savvy, and skillful compilation documentary is not only stunning to simply sit back and watch, but its knowing, stylized narration reflects the changing moods of the clips it showcases. This is what ""fair use"" was created to encourage. See also Thom Andersen's similarly consummate ""Red Hollywood"" (1996) that explores, in a remarkably objective way, the era of Communist witch-hunts in the American movie industry.",1413158400,6,678,5.229357798165138
6497517,5,B00LOFYBP0,"Although the narration is a bit dry and there's a cynical look at filmmaking, I thought this was a spectacular documentary filled with hundreds of excellent movie clips that reinforced the author's POV.

Since I only know Los Angeles from movies, this documentary helped adapt my perception of the city... It's still not a place I would want to live, but it's nice to see how the city actually is vs. how it's portrayed in movies.

I would love to see a documentary like this for NYC, but I know it couldn't compare to this incredible documentary!",1412726400,7,547,4.628865979381444
6497518,5,B00LOFYBP0,"First of all -- I'm stunned this is finally being released. Complications with rights to clips vs. clear fair use has kept this an underground classic among those film fans and scholars lucky enough to catch the rare viewings. I am so happy this is going to be available to the general public.

If you love film, this is a must. Akin to Scorsese's ""A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies"" and Mark Cousins' ""The Story of Film: An Odyssey"" -- but where those are sorts of guides through chronological lists, Thom Andersen's LOS ANGELES PLAYS ITSELF is a brilliant piece of criticism about how Hollywood looks at itself -- geographically, socially, and psychologically.
It is one of the most thoughtful explorations of any subject I've ever experienced -- and not just on film. I rarely come across anything in print that looks so deeply at a subject. -- And it's FUNNY.

It's also an important record of Los Angeles neighborhoods that are long gone, like Bunker Hill and Chavez Ravine. Film turns out to be the best record of Los Angeles' past.

The DVD looks great and is considerably CHEAPER if you order from the distributor - Cinema Guild (dot com), listed in their ""store"" link:

6497520,5,B00LOFYBP0,"As a native of Los Angeles, I found *Los Angeles Plays Itself* an EXCELLENT anthology of movies in which the city has appeared in various guises, all spread throughout time. Contrary to what some reviewers of this movie have stated, there is atmosphere and culture peculiar to Los Angeles, and those facets of the atmosphere and culture are what make movies using the city as an uniquely identifiable place. Los Angeles has a multifaceted history unlike that of any other city and any given movie can capture only a small glimmer of it at any time. Here is where I see the great merit of this particular anthology; it brings a large number of the facets of Los Angeles' history and culture together in one place where the non-Angeleno and perhaps the younger native Angeleno can appreciate the mosaic of the city.
  May I suggest the importance of reading the 20+ page pamphlet included with the disk?",1467504000,,901,4.732484076433121
6497521,2,B00LOFYBP0,"Los Angeles is a dull, charmless, airless, place full of mouth-breathers buzzing around in their gleaming hunks of tin babbling to each other on the latest electronics that they go into hock to purchase each time they are resold to them. But there is a reason why this awful place and its residents constantly figure in so many movies and TV shows -- because L.A. is where the money is. That's why the same streets and buildings are used as backdrops over and over again and have been for decades. Why do people in movies and film -- who are smart enough to know better -- remain in L.A.? To be near their money. It really is as simple as that.",1463529600,,644,4.330578512396694
6497522,3,B00LOFYBP0,"A collection of movie clips of Los Angeles.  It seems Thom Anderson wants to have it both ways.  Los Angeles is not all it's cracked up to be...and to show that it isn't, let's watch 3 hours that prove fantasy Los Angeles is more interesting than real Los Angeles.  While the tone of the narration is as flat as a heart monitor in a hospital movie, one thing that stands out is that the narrator seems a little angry that Los Angeles has been made to look more attractive, more sinister, more exciting than it really is.

Another ambiguity is that although Los Angeles is a smoggy congested mess of bland suburbs with people who don't work in the movie business, it's home (his; not mine.)  So much so that calling it ""L.A."" is an insult.

Ok, so what about the movies shown?  They're wonderfully chosen but he relies pretty heavily on films you've most likely seen.  Blade Runner, Chinatown, Kiss Me Deadly.  Great choices and they all fit the mood.  The movie most people won't be familiar with, The Exiles, is a fascinating, if slow moving, documentary about displaced native Americans living on Bunker Hill.  Its a real work of art and the best record that exists of Los Angeles lost Bunker Hill neighborhood.

Los Angeles Plays Itself is in two parts.  The first focuses on buildings and places (again, likely to be familiar, like the Ennis House and of course the Bradbury building.)  Part two seems to pivot towards social justice and the lack thereof in the movies.

Its definitely worth a look and if you can get past the tone of needing to set the record straight, pretty entertaining as well.",1456531200,2,1603,4.595070422535211

6497524,3,B00LOFYBP0,"Good documentary as history of filmmaking in LA, but morose narration and cynical, sometimes completely wrongheaded look at certain movies make it a tough slog at times.  The narrator says right in opening that movies are more about the characters than the setting, and he's right, but then spends nearly three hours proposing that the setting of LA should have been treated with more respect.  Lighten up, man.  They're just movies.  If you want entertainment that's generally more intelligent than movies, read more books.",1455148800,3,524,5.2023809523809526

6497536,5,B00LOFYBP0,"If you are a movie buff, you must see Los Angeles Plays Itself. Directed by Thom Andersen and narrated by Encke King, who could probably be a voice double for Robert Wagner any day of the week, this documentary with a film noir style has finally been released. I say finally because it was actually created in 2003, but it took years for the ""fair use"" complications to be cleared up.

Los Angeles Plays Itself is made of clips from dozens of movies, still photographs, intellectual discussions of the symbolism used by movie makers in selecting the various buildings, streets, and neighborhoods to put across their own social, political, and psychological viewpoints in their movies.

From the golden age of cinema to today, these sites--like the Ennis House (Blade Runner, Rush Hour, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and many more)--are still being used, but many of the neighborhoods no longer exist. Many of the buildings--bet you recognize a lot of them--have been demolished so this documentary is also an important record of the Los Angeles that no longer exists.

The voice-over commentary connects all of those elements to create a portrait of a city known the world over as the ""home"" of Hollywood. This film will enchant film historians, critics, and movie buffs, but it's also a film that will interest and entertain the average movie-goer because it's an ""insider's look"" at the world of movies.",1426896000,,1401,4.953191489361702

I'm glad I believe in God - otherwise there is no hope. ""Los Angeles Plays Itself"" is not just about L.A.  - it is about the human condition there & everywhere. Well worth viewing whether you've lived in L.A., visited if or never even been to California.

6497543,3,B00LOFYBP0,"I love movies and I love to hear the back stories that go along with them. I'd always heard references to this documentary and how great it was but it was never out on DVD/Blu-ray until now.

The film shows famous LA locations/buildings that are used in several movies and also shows the clips from the movies themselves, it's a treasure trove of clips. And it's great to hear some of the history of the locations.

The individual who created the documentary also narrates it and he probably should have hired a voice actor. He has one of the most monotone speaking voices I've ever heard, it makes it hard to watch. Also, he seems to have a bit of an axe to grind. Throughout the movie he repeatedly points out that Los Angeles is much more than a movie town. In fact he hates people that use the term ""LA"". Also, he seems upset that movies portray one location when in actuality, it was filmed in a completely different part of town. Hey, that's movie making.

Pros: an insane amount of Los Angeles movie footage and the history of that location/neighborhood.

Cons: The narrator - he made me want to turn the sound of and read captions instead.

However, I have a very good idea of what films the filmmaker likes and doesn't like. Problem is, I didn't care about that before I sat down to watch the film, and I definitely don't care about it now.

8667415,1,B00LOFYBP0,"This film should be a slam dunk to be a fun watch as it is a documentary purportedly about films using Los Angeles locations and about those locations.  The only really good thing about this film is that it broadly covers a lot of films in a variety of genres, and some of these may pique your interest enough to want to watch them.  I am always on the lookout for a good film (especially film noir) I have not seen and I found a couple by watching this.  Moving on to the bad, the narration by Thorn Andersen is so laconic that he actually challenges the viewer to enjoy the film.  Hey, silly me, but I thought this was supposed to be a fun watch.  Moving on to the ugly, what makes this film unwatchable is the practically nonstop hard left wing diatribe.  Andersen gleefully tells us that Neutra's masterpiece The Lovell Health House (used in LA Confidential as Pierce Patchett's residence) was used in the 1930s for meetings of socialists, but does not seem to comprehend that socialist societies are incapable of producing such masterpieces as The Lovell Health House.  Andersen also ineptly revisits the well trodden field of McCarthyism and the blacklist without admitting that while McCarthy was an opportunistic slug, there really was a red scare, a cold war, and that many of the people blacklisted were in fact communists.  Near the conclusion of the film are several vignettes of an abandoned Goodyear tire factory.  The narration accompanying the scenes is centered around the concept that the factory was abandoned for the purpose of depriving workers of jobs.  Obviously this man has no concept of obsolescence.  That should not be surprising because by any reasonable standard of accomplishments, socialism is obsolete and has been for many years now.  The hard left wing bias is so overwhelming (and so overwhelmingly idiotic) that it left me thinking that the purported subject of the film is secondary to the propaganda aspect.  I would give it 0 stars if I could because of the incessant, stupid propaganda.  Now someone needs to make a GOOD film about movies shot using Los Angeles locations.
