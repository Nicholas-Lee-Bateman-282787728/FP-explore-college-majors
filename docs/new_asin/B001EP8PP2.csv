3556932,5,B001EP8PP2,"Off Broadway has been a favorite band of mine for twenty five years. So, when I saw this DVD, I had to grab it up immediately. And man, is it good. Recorded in West Chicago Il, in '96 (I think). It's not the original classic line-up, but it's close. It's recorded very well and SOUNDS great. Cliff Johnson on vocals, Rob Harding on guitar, Mimi Betinis on guitar and Keys, Mike Gorman on bass and Kenny Harck slammin' the drums...as always.

These guys were huge in Chicago in the late 70's and early 80's. Great to see that they are still out there tearing it up. So, if you have a love for Rockin' Pop music or want to know what all the fuss was about...Grab this thing and play it loud. Cool Daddio!!",1229040000,4,703,4.246268656716418

Thank you to the person who took the time to put this DVD together. Thoroughly enjoyed it and so did my husband.",1453852800,,230,3.9148936170212765

8299215,5,B001EP8PP2,Great to see this video. I was at Synergy in West Chicago when it was taken. Spent many years following Off Broadway.,1361318400,,117,4.363636363636363
8299216,5,B001EP8PP2,"Are you a serious Off Broadway fan ? Do the chords at the beginning of Full Moon still make your head want to explode 30 years later ? Do you remember them opening for for UFO at the Amphitheater in March of 1980 at the height of their popularity ?

If you are more than a casual fan, this is a must have.

This is the real thing, 16 years later in West Chicago, Synergy I believe.

It is AMAZING.

8299217,5,B001EP8PP2,"This is one of the best DVDs I own.  The photography, production, sound, etc., are brilliant.  I have been a fan of Cliff Johnson and all of the Off Broadway band for many, many years and this DVD has the feeling of being right at the concert.  This is a must-have for everyone.",1313539200,4,278,4.2075471698113205
8299218,5,B001EP8PP2,"First, I must be clear that I was privvy to Off Broadway back in the 70's when living in the Midwest. I have been on the West coast for many a year since. I started and still am a very huge fan of Cheap Trick, ELO, Roxy Music, Neil Finn, Oasis, GBV, and the like and always had a high regard for Off Broadway. When ""Falling In"" was released as their last studio album back in the later 90's, I was ecstatic and again in love with their sound. More recently, The Cliff Johnson Band was released and instantly the old sparks were ignited--maybe more than ever. When I was roaming around Amazon a couple of months back and just bringing up bands to search for, mostly to just make sure that I wasn't missing anything new, I was shocked to see this '96 DVD available. The reviews were great (albeit few available) but I took the plunge and am very happy to report that this show is incredible.
I am a happy camper, as right now this is one of my favorite DVDs. The band and sound are superb, and the camera workings are really great considering this is a bar show, not a concert. Cliff is classy and entertaining and the band, in every position, is just great! I had forgotten how cool Rob Harding was as a guitar player. Likewise Kenny Harck is way undervalued as a world class drummer, and Mimi Betinis on rhythm guitar (occasionally lead and vocals) given his long history with Cliff and Pezband is just heartwarming to see. It is fantastic that they include a couple of old Pezband tunes here as well as a few from the previousy mentioned ""Fallin' In"" on this set. Finally, I give props to Mike Gorman on bass who is really a key, along with Harck at driving the Off Broadway sound throughout. Cliff has got to be the best entertainer in rock history, no doubt, to not be known anywhere, sans the Chicago area. No point in critiquing the actual tunes as there is not a bad one in the set, and frankly, they are all equally great. Just try to decide to pause anywhere along the set! One note to the band in case anybody out there reads this: What in the world ever happened to ""Jealous Guy""? I was so happy to see Cliff's vocal 'medleys' of old tunes incorporated in 'Hang On For Love' and 'Full Moon', but to ignore this old live classic, (again talking ""Jealous Guy""), is insane. Bryan Ferry and Neil Young had their fun with it, but the public deserves to hear your undeniably awesome version live as well!!",1302048000,2,2409,4.343680709534368
8299219,5,B001EP8PP2,"Saw them last night (DEC 26th 2009)at Fitzgerald's in Berwyn, something of an annual Christmas show. Reported to be their last(supposedly a DVD is in the works for this show), who knows? By the way they were better than ever ! Buy this DVD, worth having. As mentioned in previous reviews here, sounds/looks great. I've also seen the band dozens of times since the 70s and Cliff is a way underrated singer as is the band itself with the catchiest songs ever written. Footnote: Cliff Johnson Band CD just out and I'm happy to say it's great!",1261180800,4,539,4.56701030927835
8299220,5,B001EP8PP2,Nice showcase of a great band and a high point in their career. Cliff and Mimi singing together is a perfect pairing. This is a must for any Off Broadway fan who has been waiting literally forever for a video of this band performing live. The band sounded tight. The song selection is complete. The performance is from a few years back. The production values while not up to year 2009 standard are professional and good enough to turn it up. Remember your speakers need exercise too.  Well worth the 16 bucks. Any fan of OB should get this while it is available.,1257379200,5,562,4.456310679611651
8299221,5,B001EP8PP2,"First off i've been a huge fan of both OFF BROADWAY and PEZBAND for many years.if you love one you gotta love the other. so when i saw this dvd listed on amazon i had to have it. a 1996 show from chicago usa. this freakin' rocks!!! 18 songs including a a ripping cover of the honeycombs ""have i the right""! the sound quality is superb as well as the visuals. all done very pro with a top menu. this was an awesome show and anyone that knows this band needs to have this. the band was smokin' hot and Cliff's vocals were top notch. man, i can't sit still and watch it. kinda wish the band did ""boys must be strong"" buy hey at the end of ""full moon"" cliff does a perfect cartwheel across the stage. you gotta love that! positively pure power pop punk. do yourself a favor and buy this now! many thanks to Bill S.and Mimi. come on back Cliff, we need you! rock on...",1252972800,2,863,4.08235294117647
