8664672,2,B00L9KN1QU,"Flight 7500 departs Los Angeles for Tokyo and as the overnight flight makes its course the passengers encounter some sort of evil supernatural force.  Given the director, my guess would be a ""Grudge ghost.""

Our lineup of victims are moderately humanized and somewhat likable, but perhaps mostly because we recognize them from other HBO and horror favorites.  There is a couple (Ryan Kwanten; True Blood, and Amy Smart; Mirrors) embarking on a non-refundable couples trip with their friends who do not yet know they're getting a divorce, a mellow young man (Jerry Ferrara; Entourage, Battleship) and his recently wed bridezilla (Scout Taylor-Compton; Halloween) who is not fond of their goth and fatalistic row-mate (Nicky Whelan; Halloween II), and a flirty scheister seated beside an unimpressed young lady (Christian Serratos; The Walking Dead).  Meanwhile the flight attendants (Leslie Bibb; Trick 'r Treat, and Jamie Chung; The Man with the Iron Fists) gossip about the passengers and their love lives, one of which is involved with the adulterous pilot (Johnathon Schaech).  Essentially, everyone is either lying about something, angry about something, or in denial suppressing something.

Among the passengers is a man with an old wooden box of which he's suspiciously protective.  I'd be a bit clingy to my carry-on, too, if it had an evil Japanese spirit in it (or so I'm assuming that of the contents).  Shortly after takeoff he dies from a most violently protracted seizure.  By the end of the movie you will find no link to this completely unnatural seizure and any of the other events that shall transpire.

With a dead body on board people are harrowed, some even curious, but most reflecting on their lives having recently faced death.  It disappoints me to say that as some strange things start happening on the plane, I found more satisfaction from the development of the characters' relationships and self-discovery (not that there's anything special going on) than I did the horror story itself.  The formula is simple: 1) someone thinks she sees something, and 2) two passengers find connections when first they saw adversity.  The dead body creepily moves, and a troubled couple reflect on their poor decisions.  There's a lot of this interplay between interpersonal moments and failed attempts at scary happenings.  Speaking of failed attempts, a woman encounters a ghost emerging from the mist of the tiny airplane bathroom floor while taking a pregnancy test. Needlessly weird!

As the story stumbles into some state of development we learn of evil spirits of Japanese mythology that ""won't let go"" and thus do not move on to the afterlife. Apparently that's what's happening here.  There's also a weird twitchy ""death doll"" that doesn't seem to fit into all this at all.  And don't worry, by the end of the movie you'll see the doll meant very little.

The special effects are minimal, not in a ""minimalist"" way but in a really disappointing way.  Some CGI mist, spectral reflections, and reaching hands.  That's it.  Our victims deaths go something like thisthey hear something, a door or lid or suitcase opens, an out-of-focus figure or a hand emerges, the victim screams or whimpers, aaaaand cut scene.  We see no monster or ghost nor do we see an attack or a gruesome outcome--not even a horrific body.  Of whatever budget there was to hire the cast and create a huge variety of poster art (of the course of 3-4 years of release delays), it seems that hardly a dollar was spared to bring our monster to the screen.  As such, I now see why it took years to finally get this movie released.

I don't know what went wrong.  The well-respected director Takashi Shimizu (The Grudge 1-2, Ju-On 1-2) and writer Craig Rosenberg (The Uninvited, The Quiet Ones) brought together a sizable ensemble cast rich with horror experience.  This should have worked.  It seemed to have all of the building blocks of success, but once you hit ""play"" you'll find no foundation was built.

Very sad.  I wanted so badly to like this--especially since I've been waiting for YEARS to see ths.  My recommendation is that you don't even watch this out of respect for Shimizu or any of the cast you may like.  It's not worth it.  Not even a little.",1460764800,,4249,4.921348314606742

8664674,2,B00L9KN1QU,"Good Movie, but not what I wanted.  I'm giving this movie 2 stars because it is an American movie and  I expected it to be in English, but it was DUBBED in German. Not only was it DUBBED in German, but it only offered subtitles in GERMAN.  I HATE DUBBED MOVIES.  Now I feel like I need to find another copy in English or French.",1444262400,,328,4.0
