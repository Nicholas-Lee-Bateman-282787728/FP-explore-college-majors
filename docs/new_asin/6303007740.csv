7834255,5,6303007740,"It's a fun and nostalgic look behind the scenes of All My Children in the 90's. It's like someone gave me a backstage pass. It shows how the show is made.  It has rehearsals, short interviews, casting, set design, wardrobe and props. It would be great for acting students to see the camera blocking and the real work behind daytime dramas. It doesn't spend much time on the characters themselves - just short scenes. If you love Erica there is a second show called ""All About Erica"" and it's great also.  I wish they had more tapes and CD's available for All My Children and One Life to Live.",1363046400,2,592,4.422018348623853
