8442102,4,B004URMA84,"lots of options for foot exercises on this dvd,  The instructor teaches in military boot camp style.  but it is worth it just to get suggestions of different exercises one can use the half balls with.  Highly recommend it as reference library of foot exercises to refer back to, but not follow her as a teacher on this.  For me her pace is too fast and covering too many moves.  I pick some and work with them.  I do not do all them at once, Maybe I will work up to that.",1446422400,2,471,4.065217391304348
8442103,5,B004URMA84,My kids loved the dvd,1429142400,,21,3.4
8442104,2,B004URMA84,"I tried to do some of the exercises and found them somewhat irritating to the foot and ankle muscles.  I had already been doing some trigger point work, foot massage, and exercises and stretching for better foot health. None of these had ever induced pain and irritation of my feet. I did not persist because of concern I could do more harm than good if I did continue. It may work for others.",1398124800,3,393,4.383561643835616
8442105,5,B004URMA84,"i purchased this item because i lead exercises at a senior center three times per week.

some good movement activity.",1361145600,,248,4.790697674418604
8442106,5,B004URMA84,"Love this DVD. It contains 4 videos that are ten minutes each. The instructor walks the kids through a dance routine and then at the end they ""Put it All Together"" and repeat it a few times. My students have a great time and they get a little exercise. They're breathing hard but they're not out of control. Sometimes we even do two in a row as a special treat. The videos are calm enough to play right in my classroom - I just move a few desks to the side to make a little extra room. You can tell that a teacher made them! The hip hop and latin fusion dances are class favorites.",1353974400,,581,4.060869565217391
8442107,5,B004URMA84,"The school my children attend does not have a gym. To compensate for the lack of physical activity the teachers use the Classroom Fitness DVD's to provide exercise breaks for the students, each ""lesson"" is 10m long (perfect for young kids) .. The kids came home raving about the dance breaks so I spoke to the teachers and then I went out and bought the Dance DVD so that we could do it together at home.",1353542400,,404,4.328947368421052
8442108,5,B004URMA84,I found this DVD to very useful. The instructor came across as knowledgeable. the moves are not difficult but are challenging. It is a no frills dvd that gets the point across. I own the the tai chi videos from the series and hope that they continue putting out more.,1320105600,,267,4.36
