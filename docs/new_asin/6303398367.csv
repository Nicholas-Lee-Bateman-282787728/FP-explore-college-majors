639645,4,6303398367,"Wow. Talk about a dream collection for Ray Harryhausen fans. This is the sort of set you pop into a three-disc DVD player and watch all afternoon on a lazy summer weekend. How can you go wrong with three Sinbad adventures where you get to see an assortment of creatures that includes the cyclops, the snake woman, the fire-breathing dragon, the two-headed roc, the skeleton swordsman, the wooden siren, the winged homunculus, the six-armed Kali, the one-eyed centaur, the griffin, the chess-playing baboon, the giant walrus, the troglodyte, and the sabre-tooth tiger? (Whew, what a list.) Harryhausen brings them all to life the way only Harryhausen could: with flawless realism and painstaking attention to detail that today's CGI animators would do well to emulate.
The only reason I give this four stars instead of five is the sudden decline in entertainment value when we get to Eye of the Tiger. Too long, poorly told story, and perhaps too much reliance on Jane Seymour's charms. (Do I see an attempt at commercialism? Shame on you, producers.)
But all that aside, I do in fact pop this set into my three-disc player. For me, watching these DVD's is 305 minutes well-spent (and that doesn't even include the special features).
Oh, by the way, Mr. Alan Olsen, Harryhausen did receive an Oscar Lifetime Achievement Award, back in 1992. A long-delayed acknowledgment, as far as I'm concerned, but we should all be happy that the man got the recognition he truly deserved.",1061078400,8,1474,4.94758064516129
639646,5,6303398367,"Will someone please tell me why Ray Harryhousen has not won an Oscar for lifetime achevement in special effects?
There are great films.  They are the kind of films that you used to go to see for the pure enjoyment of them.  They had heroes, villians and cool looking monsters.
They were creative.  They were not carbon copies of whatever was the ""current trend in movies"".  They were fun films that you remembered long after you saw them.
Unlike the ""family fare"" of today, they were not preachy. There were no morals rammed down your throat.  And they were never boring.
I won't spoil the plots.  If you are looking for good fantasy fare, these are the films you are looking for.
They should have made this a four pack with ""Jason and the Argonauts"".  (One of the other memorable Harryhausen fantasy films.)",1037750400,8,808,4.608391608391608
639647,5,6303398367,"The Sinbad movies are a tribute to the brilliant imagination of Charles Schneer, the producer, and Ray Harryhausen, the special effects creator.  These movies, although independent of each other in story and in continuity, tell the fabulously rich story of the legendary Sinbad's exploits.  The movies are not perfect and the computer effects of today are more real, but no CGI character has ever captured the amount of creativity, heart, or vibrancy that Harryhausen's creations possess.  From the Dragon to the Cyclops to the Centaur to the Gryphen to Harryhausen's signature creation, the Skeleton Warrior no movie series has given us such an amazing plethora of creatures and beasts of fancy for the audience to marvel at.  Sinbad is the penultimate hero of adventure and myth and these movies are prime examples of Ray Harryhausen's sheer genious at work.",1012521600,5,860,5.16546762589928

639650,5,6303398367,Just finished watching this box set. It has a very clear picture with good two channel sound.  Great to see these films looking so clean.  It did seem to display a greater contrast between the dynamation and the real actors on DVD as opposed to VHS but overall wothr the upgrade to DVD!!  It don't get any better than Harryhausen!!!,969753600,2,332,4.5
639651,4,6303398367,"A good trio of films which will take older audiences back to the days of Saturday afternoon matinees and the younger folks can have a taste of the  work of one of Hollywood's greats -- Ray Harryhausen.
 The stories are  the typical hack and slash, rogue magician, rescue the damsel or get the  jewel kind of fare which we're all very familiar with. The imaginative  effects of Mr. Harryhausen and Mr. Hermann's musical score are what make  these films stand out from others such as, say, Sons of Hercules.
 In my  own personal opinion, the best of the films is the second -- The Golden  Voyage. There is much mystisism and adventure which will delight even the  most jaded of fans -- and the plot is a bit more involved.
 As to the set  -- well, DVD is most always perferable over VHS if for no other reason than  it will outlast tape. Especially if you have kids who like watching this  sort of film again and again. The films are a bit 'pricey' considering  their age and all -- and the set doesn't offer you much in the way of a  savings. Still, These are classics and can be enjoyed by young and old  alike.
 By the way, if these three films capture your interest, check out  the '60s version of 'Jason and the Argonauts'. Same type of storey --  different main character.
 If you're not sure whether these are your type  of entertainment, rent one of them (again, I'm partial to 'The Golden  Voyage'). If you enjoy that, you'll enjoy the others.

639652,5,6303398367,"Ray Harryhausen's primal importance in the realm of science fiction and special effects goes without saying. These are marvelous adventure films, truly entertainment for the whole family.
As a musician, however, I must  point out that one of these films, The 7th Voyagoe of Sinbad, contains what  is without question the single most important piece of music every written  for a film- and that is, of course, Bernard Herrmann's score.
Herrmann,  who is by now well known to most people as one of the prime movers in the  realm of adventure and science fiction musical scores, wrote one of his  best for this film.
Back in 1958, as an eleven year old, I remember  seeing this film at the old Roxy Theater in NYC. I was entranced by it, but  most of all by the music. It had such an impact on me that it decided the  direction my life would take, that is, as a composer. If music could have  such a terrific and powerful effect on people, then I wanted to take my  fledgling efforts ""all the way."" This lead me to NYCs High School  of Music and Art and, eventually, to a Bachelor's, a  Master's and a  Doctoral degree in composition from Juilliard. I have never regretted that  decision, nor forgot the impact of that moment.
I've been able to share  this with my own children. There are few films so relatively pure in their  fantasy. Enjoy, but listen, too.",963878400,43,1357,4.518518518518518

639689,5,6303398367,"First off I do not own this box set. I have owned all 3 movies for years on DVD, each individually. If someone thinks the Blu Rays are better please let me know. I love this genre of history, mythology, fantasy and seafaring adventure type stuff.  I have read the other reviews and would like to comment:

1. 7th Voyage. Kerwin Mathews is the best Capt. Sinbad of the 3 actors in this series, but not by much because these type of movies are all about the monsters by Ray H. and that's the bottom line.  A+

2. Golden Voyage. Just as good if not better than 7th Voyage.  Great imagination of creatures in this one. A+

3. Eye of the Tiger. I'm going to defend this one. OK, I know many say this one is the weakest of the three but think about this:
Most of us Harryhausen fans rate each movie based on how good the stop motion animation of the creatures are right? Well look at the flick's title...it says TIGER...as in Saber (or Sabre) Toothed Tiger.  I admire Ray's bold confidence in trying to do stop motion animation on a big cat. However, I think this is the main reason why people rate this one in 3rd place...the tiger does not look as convincing or well done. Why? Felines have got to be the most difficult animals to animate in LIVE ACTION movies. (Cartoons like Lion King can adjust and get away with it). But in live movies with stop motion or even CGI (see the more recent Saber Tooth Tiger in 10,000 BC) it's really, really hard to do.  Cats are extremely athletic, fluid, physical and move in very mysterious ways.  We have not yet perfected the CGI cat as far as I know. Please let me know if I am wrong. In addition ""Eye"" has lovable R.H. creations like the prince (as the baboon) and the Trog who looks dangerous but has understanding and becomes friends to the heroes. Now that is imagination...a monster that is good and friendly to the cause? Love it!  A+

Bottom line summary: All three movies are awesome escapism that takes me back to my childhood. They are still great today for families and kids. And most important of all:  These types of movies will never be made again!  They way kick butt on any modern CGI, SyFy, Hallmark Channel or theatrical releases these days BY FAR!  Finally I ask you this : What is better: Jason and The Argonauts or the modern remake?  Clash of the Titans or the stupid 3D modern remake?  Judge for yourselves...CGI sucks now...all acting is gone and lame special effects take over for brainless ""entertainment.""  The great art form used in these three original films has been replaced by trash. Pure trash.

Long live the late, GREAT Ray Harryhausen in movies!",1406419200,,2617,4.439330543933054

639708,4,6303398367,"The Sinbad Collection features The 7th Voyage of Sinbad(released Dec/58),The Golden Voyage of Sinbad(April/74) and Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger(July/77),all in individual keep cases and ALL in widescreen;the Golden Voyage of Sinbad,for some reason unknown,features the movie in full and widescreen. All three feature some of Harryhausen's best works and ""his"" creatures often times steal the scenes right out from underneath the actors.
The 7th Voyage of Sinbad stars Kerwin Matthews as our intrepid hero. Here we find him betrothed to Princess Parisa(Kathryn Grant)and he is sailing to his home city of Baghdad,with her,to be married. Along the way they stop on an island called Collosa and have an encounter with a magician Sokurah (Colin Thatcher),who is being pursued by a giant Cyclops. The magician uses a lamp c/w genie,to create a barrier between Sinbad,his crew and himself and the Cyclops. As they all flee in a boat the Cyclops throws a rock which splashes very close to them,causing the lamp to fall into the water. As they sail away to Baghdad the magician begs,cajoles and even threatens if he cannot return to Collosa to retrieve the lamp. When they arrive in Baghdad the same thing happens but the Caliph there isn't as forgiving as Sinbad and banishes him. Before he leaves the magician shrinks Princess Parisa down to Tom Thumb size and when they order him to restore her he says the ingredients he needs are back on the island of Collosa.
Off Sinbad goes off to Collosa and he and his men do various battles with a Cyclops,a two headed bird called a Roc,a skeletal swordsman and a dragon. Along the way the Princess has actually climbed into the lamp Sinbad now possesses and is doing Sinbad's bidding without hesitation. The movie ends with Sinbad heading home with the Princess back to normal and his room on ship-board filled with the treasure of the Cyclops.
The best out of the three films,Matthews does a great job as Sinbad(the best ""actor"" out of the three) and the plot is fast moving with rarely a slow spot. I give it 3 1/2 - 4 stars.
The Golden Voyage of Sinbad stars John Phillip Law as our hero this voyage around. Out at sea a strange creature overflies Sinbads boat carrying a piece of a gold amulet(the creature resembles Harryhausen's creature from 20 Million miles to Earth).Because of a swift arrow fired by a crewman the creature and especially the amulet becomes Sinbads. A storm comes up and blows the ship off course as Sinbad dreams of a man in black and a woman with an eye on one hand. Next day they are off shore of Marabia and Sinbad swims ashore encountering a man in black who demands his amulet. He escapes to the nearest town and meets with the Grand Vizier of Marabia,who wears a mask of gold. Noticing Sinbads jewelry he shows him HIS piece which partially matches up with Sinbad's. The Vizier relates the tale of the Fountain of Destiny in Lemuria where the three pieces,if linked up,will provide the holder with a shield of darkness,youth and a crown of riches. The man in black Sinbad encountered was the evil magician Koura(Tom Baker-the future Dr. Who) who also wants the three pieces for himself. Koura will dog Sinbad and his crews footsteps all the way to Lemuria. Along the way Sinbad and his men will encounter their wooden ship prow figure coming to life,a six armed Indian like idol,a one eyed centaur and a griffin who actually helps the crew to battle the centaur. Every time Koura uses his magic he grows older. At the fountain a now youthful Koura,who arrived a little before Sinbad,battles him to the death. Sinbad comes out the victor but gives up his prize to the Vizier who is restored to his original appearance.
This film worked less well than its predecessor because of the more cumbersome plot and also the lackluster performance of its star. He wasn't nearly as good as Matthews but not nearly as bad as the next Sinbad;his brooding looks could only carry the picture so far. I give this one 3-3 1/2 stars.
The last film is of course Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger. It seems Prince Kassim(Damien Thomas) is about to be crowned the Caliph of Baghdad. Before he is,an evil sorceress Zenobia(Margaret Whiting)castes a spell on him turning him into a baboon. Sinbad arrives home at night but finds the town closed and quiet. The next day he learns from Princess Farah(his betrothed,played by Jane Seymour) that her father still rules the city by day but at night Zenobia does. Sinbad must set off to find an old alchemist by the name of Melanthius(Patrick Troughton-the second Dr Who) who can help break the spell. Sinbad finds him and his daughter,who must journey with them farther afield to Lemuria where an ancient civilization left behind the cure within a pyramid. Zenobia creates a golden Minotaur who singlehandedly rows Zenobias ship to Lemuria on its own. At one point she turns into a sea gull in order to spy on Sinbad and barely escapes when trying to return to her ship. When she does,and turns back, there isn't enough potion to restore her fully and one foot remains that of a gull. Sinbad and the crew do battles with a giant wasp,three ghouls,a giant walrus and in the end the giant saber tooth tiger(possessed by Zenobia)of the films title. As the pyramid crumbles away all flee its confines and return to Baghdad where Kassim,now restored,is finally crowned.
This is the weakest of the entries and in no small way because of its ""star"" David Wayne. Dave had to live in one heck of a big shadow all his life from his father John,and really never overcame that handicap. I wouldn't say he was wooden,I can just say he was neutral. We can establish little if any empathy towards him as he simply does not project and in turn he never establishes any connection with us. The plot is also a little weak and winding. Harryhausen's baboon here is just a spectacular creation and it is in a way a little throwback to his original career inspiration of King Kong. I give this film no more than a three star rating.
All films are in their widescreen a/r's and all discs contain some wonderful extras(too many to mention here),many having to do with Ray Harryhausen himself and his career in the business. All films have been transferred well but they do need work to clean them up. In fact the 7th Voyage of Sinbad WAS re-released recently in a 50th anniversary edition and I recommend it highly. It's picture is like night and day compared to this ones.
All in all a nice release of all the Sinbad Schneer/Harryhausen releases into one volume. A nice gift for all the fans of this genre or of the S/FX master of the old school,Ray Harryhausen.",1309737600,,6633,4.674935842600513

639712,5,6303398367,"This is a great box set of all three Ray Harryhausen Sinbad movies. There is no continuity between the three, however, and they can be watched in any order. I recommend chronologically in order of release (7th Voyage, Golden Voyage, and Eye of the Tiger). Curiously, the box lists them in the order Golden Voyage, Eye of the Tiger, and 7th Voyage. No idea why.

The best plot of the three and the best film of the three is Golden Voyage. It seemed to me to have the most imaginative elements, the best cast overall, and a few good subplots. The scenes with the Oracle and the fight with Kali are especially good. 7th Voyage is a close second. Eye of the Tiger has the weakest plot of the three with major lapses in logic at the end. On the other hand it did try to mix up the elements of the previous films somewhat by having a magician and a monster as allies instead of adversaries. Unfortunately, it also burdened the story with two women with no connection to the main plot, just eye candy.

The best Sinbad is Kerwin Matthews in 7th Voyage. He's not a great actor by any means but more than serviceable here. John Philip Law's performance lacks vigor and is really too laid back, like he is phoning it in. Patrick Wayne, the worst actor of the three, actually does a commendable job. He's animated and energetic and doesn't drag down the film.

The best villain is Tom Baker but Torin Thatcher and Margaret Whiting are also good. Baker's performance is truly fine and he really gets everything out of his scenes. The villains were the best actors in each film.

The best leading lady is Caroline Munro in Golden Voyage although Kathryn Grant in 7th Voyage is also good. The mysterious looking Munro seemed better cast for a film with dark overtones than girl next door Grant. Jane Seymour and Taryn Power, as I said above, add little but eye candy to the film. Attractive eye candy to be sure, but eye candy nonetheless.

Highly recommended to all film fantasy fans. The Harryhausen effects are marvelous. You won't think you might be watching CGI but they truly make the films. Just go with them.",1298160000,,2102,4.5065616797900265

Watching them again now at age 45 was a real hoot. On the cover, I think Kerwin Mathews looks pretty wimpy with that pose and expression but in the film he is actually as convining as any of the actors who played the Sinbad roll. Kathryn Grant is quite a doll in her roll as the princess. The extra features on this disk are really cool if you are a fan of Harryhausen's work or the methods used to create the special effects.

THE GOLDEN VOYAGE OF SINBAD; This another great movie of how Sinbad and his crew were able to help conquer the evil wizard Koura.

SINBAD AND THE EYE OF THE TIGER;is another great movie when Sinbad and his crew helped to crown Prince Kassim to his throne when his step mother Zenobia a witch transformed Kassim into A baboon. I can't help watching it again. Excellent movie.

Tom Baker plays the evil wizard in Golden Voyage, and Patrick Troughton is in Eye of the Tiger. The 7th Voyage is my favorite of the three and the other two are well worth seeing. Kerwin Matthews always amazed me how well he pretended to actually be fighting non-existent creatures. He makes you believe he actually saw them. Excellent special effects for 7th Voyage being made twenty plus years ago. Ray Harryhausen was the master of the Stop Motion Animation that is used for the creatures here. No CGI here, so it is incredible what he did all by hand moving the creatures and filming. Some would consider these B movies, but even if they are the stories, acting, music, and sets are all very well done and great family entertainment. Wonderful professional movie quality and the music of Bernard Herrmann in 7th Voyage make it a class above many childrens fantasy movies. Adults love it too. I recommend you buy these since the price is reasonable and they include some nice extras including a documentary with Ray Harryhausen.",1149033600,,1163,4.705882352941177
639790,4,6303398367,"Even with the current state of digital special effects the stop-motion miniatures of Dynamation, also called Dynarama, are incredible.  It is amazing to see the kind of magic that special effects wizard Ray Harryhausen was able to wrest from his miniatures.  When wires were required to support certain features I was unable to find them even when searching for them.

""The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad""

This 1958 movie was the first of three Sinbad movies for which Ray Harryhausen created special effects.  However, as has been said by many others, Harryhausen's special effects often did as much acting as the actors themselves, showing emotions and often intent, and the blend of special effects and live acting turns movies such as this into a viewing experience.

In this movie Sinbad (Kerwin Matthews) is on a quest to find the egg of a Roc to return his love Princess Parisa (Kathryn Grant, soon to be Mrs. Crosby at that time), who has been reduced to miniature size, back to her full height.  Sokurah the Magician (Torin Thatcher), who needs a piece of Roc egg in order to restore the Princess to her full height, sent Sinbad on this quest.  Only the audience knows that Sokurah reduced the Princess to force Sinbad to go on the quest.  Sokurah's ulterior motive is that a magic lamp containing a genie is on the same island as the Roc egg, and Sokurah plans to obtain the lamp during the quest.

During the quest to find the Roc egg we meet a cloven-hoofed Cyclops, a full grown two-headed Roc and a Roc chick, a marvelously animated dragon, and an incredible skeleton in a fight sequence with outstanding human actor interface.

While this movie is rated G, I recall when I was much younger that it was movies such as these that generated more than one nightmare, so you may want to consider whether younger members of the family should be permitted to watch this movie.

""The Golden Voyage of Sinbad""

Of the three Sinbad movies, this one is probably the best.  In this movie Sinbad (John Phillip Law) encounters a homunculus carrying a golden tablet.  Soon Sinbad is seeing all sorts of interesting visions, including a beautiful slave girl and a strange looking man who turns out to be an evil wizard.  The homunculus and the golden tablet are the property of the evil wizard, and he wants them back, so he creates a storm that drives Sinbad and his men ashore.  Once ashore, Sinbad encounters Koura (Tom Baker, who would be the fourth Dr. Who the same year this film was released), the evil wizard.  Sinbad escapes to a nearby city where he meets with a disfigured Vizier.  Soon Sinbad figures out that the golden tablet is part of a map leading to all sorts of riches, which causes Sinbad, the Vizier, and Sinbad's men to go seeking the goodies, ostensibly to keep evil Koura from getting them.

Before Sinbad and company head out, Sinbad encounters a beautiful slave girl that, surprise, looks just like his vision.  After an exciting series of adventures we reach the exciting conclusion, which involves more Harryhausen special effects; a gryphon fights a centaur as part of the eternal battle of good vs. evil that includes evil wizard Koura and Sinbad.

This movie is superior to ""The 7th Voyage of Sinbad.""  The acting is better, the story is better and the special effects are more numerous and better.  I think both movies are valuable for those looking for quality fantasy, movies with Ray Harryhausen special effects, or Sinbad movies.  Or you could just get these movies because they are fun to watch.

""Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger""

This movie is the weakest movie for which Harryhausen has done special effects, and is the weakest of the three Sinbad movies.

Sinbad (Patrick Wayne, a veteran of dozens of television appearances) is a questing man, and this time he meets hot babe Princess Farah (played by a young and gorgeous Jane Seymour) and her baboon brother Prince Kassim (played sometimes by a stop-action baboon and the rest of the time by Damien Thomas).  Of course, Prince Kassim is not supposed to be a baboon, but the only way to get him back to human form is to find Melanthius (played by Dr. Who veteran Patrick Troughton).  Melanthius determines that the only way to change Prince Kassim back is to head off to the arctic to some mysterious power, taking beautiful blonde daughter Dione (Taryn Power) with him.

Of course, quests like these are no fun unless there is someone chasing after you.  In this case the person is Zenobia (Margaret Whiting), who wants her son Rafi (Kurt Christian) to become the king.  Zenobia has power of her own, which we figure out quickly when we learn that she is the one who turned Prince Kassim into a baboon.  Zenobia decides to make Sinbad's trip more interesting by animating a Minoton, which looks a lot like a robot Minotaur.

Sinbad and gang head off to the frigid north, encountering a giant wasp, a really giant walrus, a one-horned giant troglodyte, assorted ghouls, and (what was missing from the list?) a saber-toothed tiger!  It's a tough journey, especially with Princess Farah and Dione exposing all sorts of flesh as they go skinny-dipping, but Sinbad will overcome all obstacles to save Prince Kassim!

The problem with this movie is that the acting is not all that great, and the plot seems too much like a re-tread of the previous two Sinbad movies.  A viewer who has watched the previous two Sinbad movies will find this one predictable.

While these three movies vary in quality, they are a great addition to a fantasy collection and a lot of fun to watch.  Enjoy!",1148947200,6,5565,4.714581178903826
639791,1,6303398367,"If you are buying this collection for your children, be forewarned that the '70s ""Eye of the Tiger"" contains a shot of the naked princess sitting on a rock combing her hair after a bath in the nearby pond (knowing that Sinbad's scruffy sailors are in the vicinity).  Had I known about this scene, I would have purchased the 7th Voyage and the Golden Voyage separately.  The Eye of the Tiger has no redeeming qualities.  As per the pacifist political correctness of its day, all of the film's conflict melts away before anyone has to use any force to defend themselves, so the plot plods along from one non-event to another.  Harryhausen's effects were wasted on this film that my kids enjoyed less than the Popeye cartoon version of Sinbad.",1134345600,5,740,4.6692307692307695

639793,4,6303398367,"This set collects all three of the Ray Harryhausen/Charles H. Schneer Sinbad films on DVD, for better or worse.  The cast and crew may have changed over the years, but one thing remained constant, that being a genuine sense of fun and excitement inherent within all three films, assisted by Ray Harryhausen's dedication to his craft of bringing to life fantastic, mythical and imaginative creatures through his process of Dynamation.  All in all a highly enjoyable set at a decent price.

The 7th Voyage of Sinbad (1958)

Co-written by Ken Kolb (""The Wild Wild West"") and Ray Harryhausen, and directed by Nathan Juran (The Brain from Planet Arous, 20 Million Miles to Earth, Attack of the 50 Foot Woman), the film stars Kerwin Mathews (The 3 Worlds of Gulliver, Octaman) and Kathryn Grant (The Night the World Exploded, Operation Mad Ball), who would later be known as Kathryn Crosby, after her marriage to Bing `Der Bingle' Crosby. Also appearing is Richard Eyer (The Invisible Boy), Torin Thatcher (The Crimson Pirate, Jack the Giant Killer), Alec Mango (The Strange World of Planet X), Harold Kasket (Moulin Rouge - the original, not the popular remake), and Alfred Brown (Crack in the World).

Sinbad (Mathews) must rescue the fair Princess Parisa (Grant) from the spell of an evil magician named Sokurah (Thatcher), who looks a lot like Albert Finney playing Daddy Oliver Warbucks in the 1982 film Annie.  Along the way he encounters a giant Cyclops (perhaps more than one), a snake woman, an overgrown, two-headed, eagle-like bird and her two-headed offspring, a sword fighting skeleton, a ginormous fire-breathing dragon, and a genie named Baronni (Eyer).

The anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1) looks sharp and clean, and the Dolby Digital 2.0 mono audio comes through clear and defined. There's a healthy assortment of extras including an image display of an original theatrical poster, two interview segments with special effects creator Ray Harryhausen titled `A Look Behind the Voyage' (11:45) and `Jason and the Argonauts' (11:47), two featurettes titled `This is Dynamation' (3:26) and `The Ray Harryhausen Chronicles' (57:53), talent files, and a whole mess of trailers, including one for this film, along with 20 Million Miles to Earth (1957), Earth vs. the Flying Saucers (1956), The 3 Worlds of Gulliver (1960), Jason and the Argonauts (1963), and It Came from Beneath the Sea (1955).  5 stars.

The Golden Voyage of Sinbad (1974)

Co-written by Brian Clemens (""The Avengers"") and Ray Harryhausen, and directed by Gordon Hessler (Scream and Scream Again, `KISS Meets the Phantom of the Park'), the film stars John Phillip Law (Danger: Diabolik), Caroline Munro (At the Earth's Core, Maniac), and Tom Baker, who would find his niche in his next role as the lead character (played by many over the years) in the long running BBC television series ""Doctor Who"". Also appearing is Douglas `Nayland Smith' Wilmer (The Brides of Fu Manchu), Kurt Christian (Horror Hospital, Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger), and Robert Shaw (From Russia with Love, Jaws) as the floating, larger than life, gangrenous, disembodied, riddle speaking, horned head of The Oracle of all knowledge...seriously, you have to see, fizzy bubbles and all, it to believe it...

Sinbad (Law) races against an evil wizard (Baker) to collect the most fabulous prize in the world and save the Kingdom of Marabia, encountering such fantastic creatures as a homunculus (a tiny, winged demon looking creature), a lively ship's masthead, a six-armed statue of Kali a sickly cycloptic Minotaur (half humanoid, half bull), and a griffon (wings and head of an eagle, body of a lion), with slave girl Caroline Munro and her heaving cleavage in tow.

 The film is presented in both widescreen anamorphic (1.85:1) and fullscreen format, both looking very clean and clear. The Dolby Digital 2.0 mono audio comes through well enough to satisfy most. There's a good amount of special features available, including three featurettes titled `Mysterious Island' (9:04), `The 3 Worlds of Gulliver' (5:21), and `Earth vs. the Flying Saucer"" (8:37), vintage advertising, an original theatrical trailer, and production notes in a insert booklet.  4 stars.

Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger (1977)

The third and final Sinbad outing co-produced by Ray Harryhausen and Charles H. Schneer, co-written by Beverley Cross (Clash of the Titans) and Ray Harryhausen, the film was directed by actor/sometimes director Sam Wanamaker (Irreconcilable Differences, Raw Deal). Starring is Patrick Wayne (Beyond Atlantis, The People That Time Forgot), son of The Duke, and Jane Seymour (""Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman""). Also appearing is Taryn Power (""The Count of Monte-Cristo""), Margaret Whiting (""Shroud for a Nightingale""), Patrick Troughton (Scars of Dracula, The Omen), and Kurt Christian (Horror Hospital, The Golden Voyage of Sinbad). An interesting note...the actor credited as playing the Minoton (the robotic Minotaur) is Peter Mayhew, who's probably most famous for his role as that big, hairy, lovable wookie Chewbacca in the Star Wars films.

Sinbad (Wayne) must rescue a prince from the evil spell of a scheming witch, encountering along the way some emaciated demons, a bronze colossus, a larger than average bee, a ginormous prehistoric walrus, a giant troglodyte, and a vicious sabretooth tiger.  The luscious Jane Seymour and Taryn Power tag along for the ride.

The DVD presents an excellent looking widescreen (1.85:1) anapmorphic print, and features a decent Dolby Digital 2.0 mono audio track. There are some special features available, including two featurettes titled `This is Dynamation' (3:26) and `The Ray Harryhausen Chronicles' (57:53), along with production notes within an included booklet, and a trailer for this film, along with ones for other Harryhausen works like The 7th Voyage of Sinbad (1958), 20 Million Miles to Earth (1957), Earth vs. the Flying Saucers (1956), The 3 Worlds of Gulliver (1960), and Jason and the Argonauts (1963). The special features here are nothing new, especially if you own other releases in the Ray Harryhausen collection.  3 stars.

By the way, if you really want to go hog wild on Harryhausen, there's a five DVD set entitled The Fantastic Films of Ray Harryhausen - Legendary Monster Series that contains not only these three films, but also includes Jason and the Argonauts (1963), one of his best films, and 3 Worlds of Gulliver (1960).",1124150400,16,6456,5.217391304347826

639795,5,6303398367,"Having seen this set at Future Shop in Canada for $99 than again on Amazon at a much lower price it made my decision to buy this set even easier. With limited budgets and no modern day CGI special effects, these movies are still a treat to watch and a journey into escapism. Ray Harryhausen gave life to his classic stop-motion film creatures and made these movies even more enjoyable to watch as a youngster.

Today these wonderful movies have brought me back to when I was a young boy and Saturday afternoon television was at its best! The picture and sound in this fantastic collection are great and fans of these movies will be glad they bought them in such an affordable set. If only the sound could have been somehow re-mastered in 5.1 Dolby Digital, then Ray Harryhausen's amazing creatures would have been even more awesome to watch.

Since buying this incredible set I have gone on to collect ""Jason and the Argonauts"" and ""Mysterious Island"" as well as other Saturday afternoon classics of days gone by and I have not been disappointed with any of them. Whether you're a Ray Harryhausen fan or just discovering these movies for the first time, you can't go wrong with any of these films. They don't make movies like this anymore and probably never will again. Let your imagination go for a few hours, treat yourself and your entire family to some great films at an affordable price today!
