I'm very happy that this documentary was recommended for me by Amazon while I was searching for a truth that is very obvious. Watch and listen to the claims that justified the war, compared to the results of the big lies that led to the deaths of American soldiers and innocent Iraqi people.

It's ok to be a loyal citizen and believe what you want to believe, but it's not ok to blindly follow without questioning. Watch and think, it's not that hard!",1262304000,5,654,4.581196581196581
8253656,5,B0013Z1EW4,"What's most shocking to watch here is the systematic shutting down of our media. Watch and see how that was done. Compare the questions from the press then with the mindless Liz Cheney moments we must endure today. Did you ""misremember?"" How did we let them get away with any of this? That's the real question.

Don't think for a minute that you remember everything from those years. You don't. Watch this film and Visit the Website: [...]",1243036800,6,439,4.628205128205129
8253657,5,B0013Z1EW4,"Regardless of where you stand politically, whether you are on the right, the left, or somewhere in between you must see this documentary. This is a most unusual film because there is no narration. There is some factual material presented in title form, but no commentary. The extraordinary part is how our government used the media, television in particular to ""sell"" us this war. The word ""sell"" is well-placed because it was very much like a professional sales job. Most of us accompanied this drama over a period of a year or so, but to see it all compressed in slightly more than an hour is chilling.

The filmmakers were actually very conservative in their inclusion of video clips. Most particularly was the very sparse use of Scott Ritter, the weapons inspector who makes a small cameo appearance in the film but who in reality was all over the TV networks begging anybody who would listen to stop the madness. Had I directed the film I would have added a bit more of Mr. Ritter's warnings because part of the drama was not just the government's relentless case, but that there was at least one lonely man willing to sacrifice himself to warn us. (Ritter was subsequently framed by the government to shut him up.)

But it is clear that the intention of the filmmakers is to show us how the Bush administration systematically presented its case, and perhaps Ritter's repeated warnings would be a distraction from that purpose.

It is a chilling document to watch, because we are observing the players themselves, in their own words, constructing a story that can only be characterized as an elaborate and deliberate hoax on the American people. The various techniques of telling truths, half-truths and downright lies in just the right proportions demonstrate a very sophisticated level of mass deception.

This is the kind of film that needs to be seen over and over again in order to fully grasp the enormity of the fraud. This is deception at a grand scale, boldfaced, and unashamed. It will serve as a lesson to us all for years to come.",1210550400,17,2047,4.741573033707865
8253658,5,B0013Z1EW4,This documentary does an excellent job of showing just how the Bush Administration manipulated Americans into supporting the invasion of Iraq.  It's a must watch for us now with Bush's interest in taking on Iran.  Let's not be deceived again.,1209168000,8,242,5.025
