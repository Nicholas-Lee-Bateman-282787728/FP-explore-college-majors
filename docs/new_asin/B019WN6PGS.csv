7584472,5,B019WN6PGS,"i just finished this , wow, i don't have the strength to do all the reps yet, and planks, i am not strong enough yet, but i when i am this workout will make you know you have worked your muscle's, its floor work and its not easy, if it is your in good shape already. i personally love floor work, even just to have a break from standing workouts. the core workout on the dvd is mostly planks, yikes those are really hard for me even just to modify them is hard for me, i look forward to being strong enough to do them eventually.",1471219200,2,529,4.0
7584473,5,B019WN6PGS,This is an awesome leg work out without having to do all lunges and squats,1469318400,4,74,4.0
7584474,5,B019WN6PGS,Floor work is so good! My wife and I love this DVD. We do a lot of plyo's and hi rep leg exercises with other DVDs but this gets a GREAT workout in targeting the glutes and thighs.,1461456000,3,180,3.763157894736842
7584475,3,B019WN6PGS,"While you feel some burn while working out, I didn't feel it later, which to me is the hallmark of whether or not I got a great workout.  If I'm sore later that day or the next day, I know I really worked.  Plus all the back and forth with the ball, not crazy about this one.",1458691200,4,275,3.807017543859649
7584476,5,B019WN6PGS,"Equipment: 5, 10 & 12 lb. dumbbells, mat loop, stretch band and stability ball
Outfits: Pink and purple tops with black bottoms.

I have been on a barre kick for the past year or so and I was happy to try this workout since it has a barre feel to it.

This workout reminded me of Tracey Effingers Squeeze Series, which I happen to love.

Some fun new moves include:  pivoting childs pose with plank.",1452988800,4,399,4.28
8746149,4,B019WN6PGS,"Like this tape, works areas I need most focus on. The only thing is I didn't realize you need a exercise ball.",1525305600,,110,4.045454545454546
8746150,4,B019WN6PGS,"It's a fairly easy workout. She has much harder ones like Great Glutes, Gym Style legs and so on. If you are not feeling up to an advanced workout this is for you.",1516924800,2,163,3.9696969696969697
8746151,5,B019WN6PGS,Perfect for those of us who need to go a bit easier on the knee joints. I love the result I get from squats and lunges but some days my joints are not happy with me days after and this workout helps keep me working on the glutes and hamstrings plus the core gets a workout as well. I'm a 6 day a week workout gal and wish to continue well into old age. Love this and most of Cathe's DVD's.,1498435200,,389,3.814814814814815
8746152,5,B019WN6PGS,"This is a deceptively painful workout but well worth it!  Cathe as usual doesn't disappoint and makes you long for basic exercises such as squats and lunges after she's through with you.  You do need a firewalker loop, medium tension resistance band and stability ball but Cathe puts them all to good use.  You begin with ball exercises - think hamstring roll-ins, inner thigh squeezes, front thigh raises, etc., before you progress to moves incorporating the resistance bands.  Outer thigh presses and hydrants using the loop along with glute raises and calf work with the longer resistance band.  After that you move on to glute/hamstring presses with your foot on a dumbbell, a series of planks that target both the abs and legs and finally a stretch that may seem short but Cathe inserts various stretches throughout the workout to compensate.  Again, mat work may seem on paper to be easy but I was sore for a few days after I first did this DVD and I actually find it more difficult than all the floor work in Cathe's ""Butts and Guts.""  Highly recommend!",1497916800,3,1060,4.728260869565218
8746153,5,B019WN6PGS,"I am an old Cathe fan.  Been doing her workouts for years.  I have done exercise for years, too many to count.  I feel that I have the will power needed to do this type of workout in my home.  If you do them, daily (and I have a big collection of DVDs), you do see results.  Cathe has been my ""go to"" number one instructor for a very long time.  She has not disappointed!  Her workouts make me sweat, they shape and tone, they do all they say they will.  IF you do them.  I would recommend them to anyone who prefers doing this at home rather than a gym.  Same results, and the comfort of home.",1494806400,4,594,3.957627118644068
8746154,5,B019WN6PGS,"I find this to be an excellent complementary video to other routines. All exercises, including warm-up and cool-down are performed on a mat/ on the floor. A stability ball is needed, as well as an exercise loop and a band. All are absolutely worth using with this program. I find this to be an excellent complement to other routines- if with Cathe Friedrich, then Great Glutes and/or Lean Legs and Abs, or any other program that will make the exerciser sweat and move,  when this one is not requiring said exerciser to do anything else but maintain a posture and repeat moves (not much sweat involved, here). So be aware: It may feel quite repetitive ( it is floor work after all!!), however Cathe does a very good job at varying the exercises, and right when I'm getting bored with one, we are moving on to another one. There is no question that you feel ""parts of your muscles you didn't know existed"", kind of like it may have felt the first times you've done barre (or Turbo Barre if with Cathe), for example. I completely felt the burn, and even though I could complete everything, that does not mean it was easy, nor does it mean it is for a lazy day. I thoroughly enjoy this not as an exercise routine on its own but as an added finisher to a lot of other routines. This program could also be used for traveling since  many exercises use a loop or a band; The numerous premixes also feature a ""no stability ball"" option.",1485820800,2,1427,4.422053231939164
8746155,4,B019WN6PGS,"I liked the video. It does not do lunges and squats - very very bad on the knees.  I own at least 15 C. Friedrich's  videos and have used them for over ten years.  I like that she stays with some tried and trued exercises instead of going for some eclectic things that just don't work.  My only problem with her videos is her sing-songy voice.  It is really irritating.  I really wish I could turn off the audio (I always turn off the awful music).  Maybe it is a generational thing.  I don't like ""up talk"" and I don't like being spoken to as if I am some grade school student who needs to be constantly prodded and ""encouraged"".  I mean how many times does she say ""I don't know if I will be able to use this weight, I may have to go lower"" - REALLY - you are a professional and you don't know if you have chosen too much weight to lift?  The ONLY time she talks through a video that is not offensive to me is the ""bonus"" part of this video.  Listen to it.  Do you understand what I mean?  Okay - enough of that.  I like her videos and use them 2-3 times a week - but PLEASE - speak to me like an adult!!!!!",1483142400,2,1109,3.936936936936937
8746156,5,B019WN6PGS,As usual Cathe Friedrich makes you work as she promises. Challenging video!,1482192000,2,75,5.333333333333333
