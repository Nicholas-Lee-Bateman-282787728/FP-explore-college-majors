8195605,5,B000QCU53Y,"I'm in agreement with David Champion's fine review.

New viewers, however, probably should be warned about the film's flaws.  The narrative being what it is, there's an excess of characters and settings.  Watching the movie, therefore, can sometimes feel spasmodic.  Moreover, with only a couple exceptions, the supporting cast deliver amateurish performances. Likewise, scenic design, lighting, editing and production values on the whole leave much to be desired. There's a ""flatness"" to the look of the movie.

My hunch is these shortcomings are related to a restricted budget.  In 1997 the movie received only  limited release and few press reviews. Am very glad to see this film has made it onto DVD.  Most likely that's due to the inclusion of now high-profile TV stars Sam Trammell (as its leading man)and Edie Falco (in a small role).  I hope the disc will find a whole new audience for ""Childhood's End.""

CE's script and star performers are extraordinarily strong. The plot centers on two relationships:  a May-September romance and coming-of-age lesbian bonding.  The complex situations and emotions are conveyed with great dexterity and a delicate touch.  Along with considerable ability demonstrated by the actors' involved, it's probable that the director also deserves much of the credit.

This movie is exceptional in at least two respects.  It successfully addresses both the adolescent and the mature adult markets.  And the ways in which it presents both male and female nakedness is also outstanding. Filmic nudity, especially in the cinema of mainstream U.S.A., is usually formulaic and stylized to the point of being clichd. But in this movie the uncovering of teen and middle-aged bodies is highly expressive of the character's relationships with each other and their shifting self-concepts.  Moreover, the nudity is equally intrinsic to the development of its story line. A rare accomplishment indeed.

Despite its many--though comparatively minor--imperfections, I did ""love it.""  So, from where I stand, ""Childhood's End"" deserves 5 stars and many more watchers.",1368662400,2,2087,5.385802469135802
8195606,4,B000QCU53Y,"We all have been there and said, ""Not another lame GLBT with the being TERRIBLE"". This movie does play on themes. It is a good movie in that it was done with a degree of believability and decent acting. THe older woman and lesbian relationship are developed without a hyped turbulent period of people coming to grips with themselves. I liked it.
It is worth watching if you have NetFlix or the other mailing rental companies. I don't expect that you would find this in your local video rental store.
I will be ordering it because I like it. I ,also, thing that it could be used as an icebreaker for family situations or family therapy. Well ,enough said, this is a good movie and worth being purchased.",1258502400,4,702,4.4921875
