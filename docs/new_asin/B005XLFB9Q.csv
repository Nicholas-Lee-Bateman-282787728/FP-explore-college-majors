8488674,4,B005XLFB9Q,these westerns reminds me of my grandmother she would watch these all the time,1417392000,,78,4.642857142857143
8488675,3,B005XLFB9Q,"These are little half-hour westerns with familiar names. Acting is perhaps best in these four shows. Among them are some who are not that common in westerns. The best is The traveling salesman with George Montogomery and Alan Hale. Others are watchable, but not much more. The stories are a bit different than usually in western shows. It would be interesting to see other similar collections of westerns. The dvd quality is not particularly good, but is passable.",1408320000,,464,4.961538461538462
8488676,5,B005XLFB9Q,"Having these in my collection of early TV westerns is like to save a treasure.

The presence of George Montgomery, Hugh O ""Brian, Dick Powell and Alan Hale Jr. is worth the price of the DVD.",1365811200,,190,4.277777777777778
