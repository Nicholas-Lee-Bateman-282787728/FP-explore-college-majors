7807634,3,6300261611,"A group of survivors from a plane crash find themselves stranded in the Mexican desert. They have very limited resources including food and water. Eventually they decide to chance the desert in search of help leaving behind the plane and their only shelter from the desert heat. With relations within the group already strained to begin with it becomes everybody for him or her self, dog eat dog (Or in this case, man eat man). Along the way, they drop off one by one until there are three left, two men and a woman. At this point, when the last of the food runs out, the leader of the group turns to cannibalism to survive by eating the corpses of the ones that didn't make it. He finds himself at odds with the other male survivor over the morality of his means of satisfying his hunger. Oh yeah, and they are both vying for the affection of the pretty blonde survivor who has made it with both of them. She makes her choice by basing her decision on which guy can keep her fed longer. (In other other words, the bigger guy lost. Get it?) Not a bad little movie.",1102809600,2,1064,4.325
