I just attended May and Millers Impovising Workshop and I learned a great amount of information on how to improvise, information I had never seen in any other book or DVD.  Not that is unique or secret information but they put it together in such a way that it seems all very simple and easy to learn.  It is up to you to practice it all and get it down so that it is automatic.  It would be very worthwhile for anyone to attend the workshop even if you have bought this CD.  This CD is exactly what they put in the workshop.

All you need to know beforehand are the chords to a song or how to find them and the theory of how a chord is constructed.  Nothing complicated just major I,IV, and V chords and how a chord is constructed from the 1,3, and 5 tones of the scale.  Everything you need to know to improvise a solo for the song is taught in a building fashion from simple to complex techniques.  Even if you only learn the simple ones you will be up with most of your fellow jam mates who you thought were pretty advanced.

Dont be fooled by the word Guitar in the title.  This is for any instrument.  You just have to adapt the theory to  your instrument.  I went as a dobro player  and there was a mandolin player in the group.

They have another guide,  Creating Solos, which is similar and also good but I think I would buy this one first since it delves into more detail on the techniques and methods of improvization.

Worth every penny and more.",1336348800,2,1524,4.125850340136054
