8750706,3,B01BMPJ3G8,"I have to take away two stars because of technical problems with sound and, in my opinion, editing. A superbly sung and staged version, but sound of principals voices is recorded so low it takes a tremendous amount of boost to get adequate volume.  Warning if your audio system is marginal in output.  Second issue which may be more a matter of personal taste is I don't like the cutting.  The editor feels a continual need to cut to close ups when I would have preferred just holding on medium or long shots.  Or, in so many cases, the cutting goes from something I wish  to watch to focus on something of lesser interest.  This is my personal taste so it may not be a problem for others!",1491264000,,689,4.34375
8750707,5,B01BMPJ3G8,"Do you like Baroque Opera?  I do but have oft been disappointed by the staging and productions that have appeared over the years.  Often they are peppered with distracting special effects or sexually explicit and politically irrelevant material.  I suppose that most audiences would not sit for a dramatic oratorio or opera without some sort of staging or acting.

The singing and acting was terrific.  The staging was minimalist and captures in a modern manner that which would have been in an ancient Greek play as best as we can imagine it.  The props are highly symbolic and unify the plot.  Early opera was an effort to recapture what was lost of Ancient Greek Theater.  Rightly, this effort should focus on quality acting, singing and performance and not on visual effects and provocative nonsense.

This permitted the singers to fully bring out the emotions of the tragedy and they did so.  The production has a summary and interpretation projected in French on the curtain between acts.  This helps those of us unfamiliar with the story and the deeper message to appreciate Handels art and what we are seeing.

What an outstanding production and this approach should be the standard for modern productions of Baroque opera.  Buy this one.",1466208000,6,1246,4.9326923076923075
8750708,5,B01BMPJ3G8,"This new Blu-ray disc reissue of the production of Handel's opera-oratorio Hercules filmed in the Palais Garnier in 2004 is very much welcome. The HD picture and DTS 5.1 sound are both outstanding, and there is an amazing feeling of presence when you sit down in front of your screen. Most important, of course, is the music and the acting and the production: I loved everything about all of it, nearly unreservedly.

The music Handel wrote for Hercules is amazing. Its beauty is obvious, and in the late Luc Bondy's production, with the modernizing translation/adaptation of playwright Martin Crimp, its psychological depth is apparent as well. Naturally, that only happens with great acting by the principals and chorus (who play a very important role), and fine singing as well. William Christie provides impeccable Historically-Informed Performance credentials for the music, and most importantly keeps the nearly unbroken intense mood on stage from swamping the musical sense Handel brings to this project.

But as good as everyone is in the pit and on the stage, this is Joyce DiDonato's show. A great, great performance!",1463788800,4,1127,5.186813186813187
