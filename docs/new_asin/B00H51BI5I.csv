8630088,5,B00H51BI5I,"I love movies from the 40's and 50's.  I remember this movie from years ago and had forgotten the name.  Thanks to Amazon, I put the names of 2 actors and found it.  Am so glad, so I ordered it and watched it that night I received.  Still love this movie as I remembered.  James Shigeta, who recently passed away and Glen Corbett (Route 66 fame), were wonderful.  The plot and story line could have been written as of today.",1408060800,8,424,4.2375
