5777066,4,B00D7AM2WE,"The idea of the Brainwave series reminds me of the film, ""My dinner with Andre"" only with a less global discussion. Rather than an evening spent between two endlessly entertaining long-lost acquaintances enjoying a fascinating ""meaning of life"" or ""perspective of life"" discussion while dining on a multi-course meal, this series involves two people that might not normally be paired together (usually one is a scientist and the other a notable person from another walk of life) meeting on a stage in front of an audience exploring a particular topic.

The success of the ten episodes is mixed. Sometimes the results are great, like with Chef Mario Batali and Paul Rozin PhD or my truly wonderful like the exchange between two brilliant minds - performance artist Laurie Anderson and Janna Levin, PhD.  And, sometimes the episode simply does not work, which was the case between comedian Lewis Black clinical psychologist Robert Allan. Sometimes one speaker has an agenda they are determined to get through even at the expense of the shared exchange rather than flow with the conversation. But, when the segments work they are illuminating.

The first DVD suffers from the most technical difficulties, and rather than use it to ease into the series I'd suggest starting with the second or third DVD first and then once engaged with the idea of the talks, wade into the least user friendly DVD - number one. And, for me, watching the discs on my PC worked better than on the television - perhaps because the computer was a more intimate viewing medium, better suited for the discussion.

From the first DVD, the audio quality of the Anderson/Levin episode was so poor I was forced to listen to it through headphones, although it was well worth the trouble.  Anderson's amazingly ""out-there"" questions and thoughts caused a wonderful reaction in scientist Levin. Without normal constraints or expected parameters in place, Levin was clearly enjoying the unusual exchange. It seemed she was being invited to think outside normal professional constraints and was delighted with the challenge. It was a treat to watch these two smart minds dance together.

Batali and Rozin share a bit of whimsy so the talk was well balanced because their sensibilities were in tune and they were willing to give and take and listen. So, even when expressing different viewpoints they also smoothly bounced ideas and anecdotes off each other, feeding each other's contribution to the discussion and entertaining the audience in the process.

This is in sharp contrast to comedian Lewis Black and clinical psychologist Robert Allan's segment on anger. I expected Black to be amusing, and he was, but Allan was so earnestly serious he managed to if not outright step on Black's amusing asides, muffled them. This pair was at cross purposes. I would have expected the failure to fall to Black - perhaps wanting to perform a stand-up routine instead of have a meaningful exchange with another person, but that was not the case. Black was game for the discussion but Allan seemed intent on running through points in a lecture. So, instead of relaxing and responding he had a clear agenda that prevented give and take, so the segment was disappointing.

Happiness is the subject matter of the first episode on the first disc and although it contains some good exchanges it is not entirely successful and offers another reason to watch the first DVD after the viewing the second and third. Both speakers, the author of The Geography of Bliss, Eric Weiner and current associate director at Stanford for the Center for Compassion and Altruistic Research and Education, Emma Seppala both warmed up a bit as the discussion progressed but initially the talk was stilted and a bit uncomfortable. Technical problems also plagued this segment with distractions of incorrect camera placement, etc.

The fear discussion between Goosebumps author R.L. Stine and NYU professor and author of The Emotional Brain Joseph LaDoux was initially awkward because as fascinating as the subject matter is, rather than a conversation between the two, the segment was largely Stine interviewing LaDoux. LaDoux seemed reluctant to speak unless prompted by Stine, but eventually a comfortable rhythm was reached. This is a good illustration of the differences between episodes. It isn't just the topic that varies, but the handling and interaction between the two speakers that changes from segment to segment.

Objective reactions from the viewers will also play a role in whether an episode is successful - whether something of value was understood or revealed, or even if the speakers are likeable. For example,  the topic of meditation - finding a peaceful state -  between Loch Kelly a teacher of Buddhist Meditation and  Zoran Josipovic, PhD in neuroscience and Asian philosophy was a bit dry -- more instructive than illuminating. While the segment on movement involving choreographer Mark Morris, and visual artist/neuroscientist Bevil Conway was well over an hour in length but time flew by. The two men had worked together previously and clearly shared a mutual respect. This added a level to the fascinating exchanges and I could have happily watched the banter between the two of them continue on.

There are three segments involving dreams, and all are valuable and enjoyable. Actress Debra Winger and psychiatrist Robert Stickgold have a lively exchange about whether dreams come true. Sometimes drifting from the subject to other aspects of dreaming and sleep the segment is memorable and entertaining. Likewise, Harry Rollins former lead singer with punk rock group Black Flag and neuroscientist David Eagleman discuss the Assassin of my Dreams a segment in which they discuss lucid dreaming and dream content. And, finally author Amy Tan and psychologist Deidre Barrett discuss creativity in the dreaming brain.

The idea to film this lecture series and preserve it is admirable, and the creators of the DVD set readily acknowledge that quality varies between segments. The problems are significant enough that sometimes they make it almost impossible to watch an episode. So, much as I enjoyed the series and the idea behind it, I am docking a star for the non-existent basic production values. But, I found much of the information made me think in ways I haven't for many years - and those neuropath ways were in dire need of a jump start. The series is well worth a watch.",1393632000,2,6438,5.077578051087984
5777067,3,B00D7AM2WE,"I watched all the episodes and was able to enjoy something about each interview. The longer I watched, the more I appreciated James Lipton on ""Inside the Actor's Studio""....or even the verbal choreography of ""My Dinner With Andre"". These Brainwave segments lacked someone to contain the focus and create a cogent whole out of the discussion. I found myself annoyed with the tangents and the often overlapping chat that didn't serve the episode. The fact that the participants are experts or entertainers does not mean the necessarily have the skills to function in a lecture/discussion format.

I also thought the production values were woefully amateurish. I've seen local high school AV productions that were more polished. It was detracting to the aims of this series to have such poor quality technical work.

I can't recommend this series however if you have a particular interest in one of the participants, it might be worth seeking out their episode.",1393459200,,958,5.095541401273885
5777068,2,B00D7AM2WE,"Brainwave is a series of topical lectures/discussions, each hosted by different intellectuals across various fields. Many of the personalities are well-known celebrities, like Chef Mario Batali, author Amy Tan, and comedian Lewis Black, which is the DVDs biggest draw.

Each topic covered, from rage and happiness to food, had the potential to be quite fascinating, especially given the pedigree of those discussing the topics, but each episode was overly long and dry. Even the segment with comedian Lewis Black, though funny at points, suffered from the dullness of Black's counterpart, Robert Allan. That's not to say the episodes are not worth exploring, but I found myself skipping chapters all-too-readily. (A booklet is included with the DVD, listing which speakers are on each episode, making for easy navigation.)

I think had each episode been limited to a 30-minute time, or been edited in creative ways to keep the content moving,Brainwave would have been a better series. As is, Brainwave is less a leisure viewing than one might hope, but valuable to those seeking more academic understanding of each of each topic covered.",1393200000,,1137,5.276243093922652
5777069,4,B00D7AM2WE,"Brainwave was conceived as a series of lectures/conversations between a scientist and a celebrity discussing how the mind works. It is not scripted in advance, so how well each episode works is in large part dependent on how well the two participants meshed with each other, and the ability of each to think and clearly articulate in real time. Nor was it originally planned (I believe) to be packaged and distributed to the wider public as a commercial product, so the production values (to include the number of cameras used) is not what youd get from a slickly packaged offering from, say, TLC. Think more along the lines of a college lecture being taped instead (although this product is better than that.) So, if you start watching with all of this in mind, tempering your expectations, you can more appreciate the program. My impressions are below.

As you might expect, how interesting each individual show is varies widely. The better ones are engaging and fun, and its really the give and take between the participants  an expert and a non-expert  that really validates the premise of the show. The poorer episodes are overly academic and dull. I don't think that this program is for just anyone. Ideally, you should have an interest in neuroscience, or at least a strong curiosity about how the human brain works to be able to enjoy the series.

It was hard for me to decide what rating to give this program. While the limitations of the format are understandable, they still impact your ability to enjoy and understand the material being discussed. On the other hand, I appreciate the effort here to produce something new, that educates while it entertains. So, Im giving this a four star rating, but with two provisos: first, that you're seriously interested in how the brain works, and second, you can buy this at a significant discount from the listed price. I don't always factor price into a rating decision, but in my opinion, the listed retail price is high when compared to what you're getting.",1393113600,,2013,4.809248554913295
5777070,3,B00D7AM2WE,"The details are great and I could see someone using this to help with a term paper etc. It was full of great information and I did learn something. However, many of the DVD's were far too dry for me. I tried to pay attention but found myself falling asleep. The commentaries with the actors, comedians, etc. were more interesting and helped spice things up a little. If you are used to sitting in a college lecture about pure science or a seminar where it covers similar subjects you probably won't mind the dry areas. For people who are used to being more entertained while they learn this probably isn't for them. O.K, but not great in my opinion. Something I might rent but not purchase.",1393027200,,690,4.484126984126984
5777071,3,B00D7AM2WE,"As others have said, the camera work is dodgy, the pacing is slow and ponderous, and the actual intellectual content is not worth the amount of time it takes to present it.

On the other hand, if you are looking for a soporific....",1393027200,,231,4.372093023255814
5777072,2,B00D7AM2WE,"I'm fascinated by brain science but was greatly disappointed with this collection of DVDs. Most of the speakers are dull, a few border on disinterested, and many come off as too self-involved for the give-and-take conversation necessary to make the talks work. The production and editing seems nonexistent. Overall, the quality came off as unprofessional.

To give a few examples, the very first segment opens with journalist and author Eric Weiner giving a reading from his book. This lasted about ten minutes. His reading was, to me, dull and uninspired. Then he turned things over to the neuropsychiatrist whose name I've forgotten. She did a PowerPoint presentation on the science of happiness that lasted approximately 20 minutes. The camera, however, remained fixed on her and Weiner sitting in the chairs, and we didn't see the screen she was referencing until maybe the last two minutes. This left me feeling completely detached. Finally we get back to the two of them discussing the science of happiness, but Weiner continually interrupted and referenced his book. The whole thing came off like an informercial for his book, rather than a conversation with professionals.

The scientist with R.L. Stine, whose name I've also forgotten, came off as detached and uninterested in the process. Occasionally he'd perk up, but Stine would bring things back to his children's books and children's fears. We spent about twenty minutes on the  reason we fear snakes, which could easily have been covered in about five minutes. None of the science there was new and it was not presented well.

I did find some of the segments interesting. For instance, choreographer Mark Morris spoke about dance movement in a discussion on mirror neurons. I know nothing about ballet, but I was fascinated by this man's stories. He remained fully engaged in the conversation and has a charismatic personality that held my attention.

Despite my interest in the subject matter, I had a difficult time getting through most of the discussions. I can sit and read a 600-page book on these topics without a problem, but it was a challenge for me to get through these DVDs. They feel like an amateur production, much more suited to a classroom teaching tool than to armchair scientists.",1392940800,,2264,5.042780748663102
5777073,3,B00D7AM2WE,"I thought this was going to be more of a documentary format, but it turned out to be more of conversations that wandered at times.  Some of it was good and some was way too much meaningless conversations.  At times, it felt like a late night talk show - especially in Episode 2 ""How Did the Universe Get Its Spots?"".  The filming and camera work was a bit amateur looking in some episodes.  Some were filmed before live audiences.

The first episode set my expectations low because it started with interviewer Eric Weiner reading from a book for 10 minutes.
Emma Seppala did a decent presentation on happiness, but the camera missed her PowerPoint through the first half of the presentation.

Episode 3: ""The Science of Rage"" was an entertaining episode, but Lewis Black was heavy on the F-Word and politics.

Episode 6: How Can I Feel Peace of Mind? was one of the better ones talking about achieving inner peace with meditation.

The last 3 episodes were my favorites, all talking about dreams.  They were all related is something we can all relate to. I especially liked David Eagleman talking about lucid dreaming.

Eagleman was also featured in the History Channel documentary video program ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Brain/dp/B001J863EO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Brain</a>"", which I thought was much more informative and a much better production.",1395273600,,1405,5.288288288288288
5777074,3,B00D7AM2WE,"Brainwave is an interesting and educational series of collaborations that pairs a scientist with an entertainer and makes you a fly on the wall while they discuss aspects of psychology. If you have a healthy interest or curiosity regarding the human mind, this show is highly recommended.

Some episodes are more entertaining than other with guests like Henry Rollins and Louis Black being particularly fun while others are less interesting. R.L Stine in particular seems a terrible fit considering they tapped him to talk about fear and he himself states that nothing scares him. Cool story; feel free to spend all of your time plugging your books instead, then.

Each episode is more or less and hour and there are ten episodes in all with the last three covering various aspects of dreaming. Aside from the random nature of the format, the show suffers from low production values with the picture being low grade and the set camera angles feeling amateurish. For instance, some shows feature presentation slides, but they appear off camera and the editor couldn't be bothered to help us out with a wider-angle shot so we don't get to see what's on the screen.

This three disc set contains some very interesting and knowledgeable discussions that make it worthwhile for anyone with an interest in psychology, but it's not for everyone and the low production values and inconsistency make the current price point seem excessive. Give it a shot if you're up for some learning, but don't expect to be blown away.",1395273600,,1512,4.921568627450981
5777075,3,B00D7AM2WE,"Glad to see D.W.back into in a movie. I found it a bit boring in the beginning. I did not know from the cover it was a documentary. It picked up in the middle.
The middle IT did get into err resting. I found it a good documentary but very slow. Good for kids wanting know more about the brain.",1395273600,,293,3.9
5777076,3,B00D7AM2WE,"I thought the Brainwave DVD was a mixed bag-some conversations were great, others were mundane and a struggle to get through.  Dream analysis with Henry Rollins was very fascinating and educational. Other discussions, such as the forum on rage, with Lewis Black (and his profanity-laced discourse) was not very enlightening.  Some topics were eye opening, and others (such as the science of bliss) was very boring, as writer Eric Weiner droned on about his studies and observations regarding happiness, which seemed to be rebuked every step of the way by his much more insightful Stanford neurologist counterpart.  In general, I thought the industry experts were more informative and interesting than their entertainer counterparts.  I think Brainwave's premise of pairing Ph. D intellectuals with entertainers is not as intellectually engaging as online TED talks, with industry-leading gurus who are surprisingly quite charming.

Brainwave has its' insightful moments, but I would view this 10 episode DVD more as a rental than keeping it part of my DVD collection.",1394496000,,1067,5.403614457831325
5777077,3,B00D7AM2WE,"I guess I had expected this to be more like either the TED talks, or my copy of TAM.  I love watching good lectures on scientific topics, an discussions on interesting subjects... I was sorely disappointed by this series.

What the videos are seem to be an onstage discussion between two people on different topics, in front of an audience.  These are filmed with pre-placed stationary cameras, and poor microphones.  The editing is choppy and at times, cuts the interviews into almost unintelligible snippets of conversation that have to be preceded by title screens for us to have any idea what they are talking about.  I believe it was the third interview where for the first several minutes we were watching the side of one person's head and the other person's head was cut completely out of the shot.  In the Lewis Black interview (one of the ones I was the most interested in watching) his microphone goes in and out.

So in the end, what could have been very interesting - ends up being a struggle to watch.  I don't know of many people who would really enjoy this when there are so many other documentaries, interviews and videos which are much more interesting and entertaining.",1394323200,,1187,4.700483091787439
5777078,4,B00D7AM2WE,"The answer to that question is demonstrated in the Rubin Museum of Art's series of ten podcast type sessions addressing the topic of 'how the brain works'.  They sprinkle in a stand up routine by one of my favorite comedians -  Lewis Black and other assorted entertainers (from chef Mario Batalli to Debra Winger) to keep you engaged.  The camera work is rough, but the sessions flow, although I had a tough time sitting through more than two sessions at a time.
If you enjoy watching in-depth discussions on PBS, you'll find this a bit elementary. It was tough to keep my kids interested for more than 30 minutes or so - and that is why I got the set - for our family movie night.  I did watch the entire series, but was the only one in my family to do so.",1394064000,,757,4.2727272727272725
5777079,3,B00D7AM2WE,"I was expecting some well produced scientific documentary, but these videos are just a live recording of a few mixed talk show held at Rubin Museum of Art, and the recording is less than professional.  There was no editing afford to even insert the slides being presented on the screen that is not within the view of the camera.

I think this video set is intended for the older people who have the luxury to attend long lectures and still use their DVD machine as their main machine for media consumption.  In this day and age, these content can be easily found in a highly entertaining and condensed form (free of fluff) on the internet, such as TED talk.",1393804800,,657,4.504201680672269
5777080,3,B00D7AM2WE,"I was fairly disappointed by ""Brainwaves"" having anticipated something along the lines of the TED talks. Perhaps the problem was my expectations.  Brainwaves doesn't present new ideas, nor do the interdisciplinary dialogs reveal anything particularly novel.  It is a series of interviews conducted  by scientists  (primarily psychologists and neuroscientists) in their specialty areas.

The entire series had the feeling of an afternoon talk show.  The talks were not very high level either with respect to science or the arts.  While the guests were interesting, accomplished people, the interviewers were seldom able to really engage them or create a natural dialog.  What was interesting about them, their ideas and accomplishments, their expertise was more often than not lost.  I am sure I would have enjoyed many of the speakers in another context. How can you interview people like Laurie Anderson and Henry Rollins without bringing up music, composition or creativity ?

I would describe it as science in the public interest, one of a number of current efforts to get people more engaged in and thinking about the sciences, which is a good thing.  The talks, however, were about the level of a Discovery network show.  Many felt like guest lectures in a psych 101 class.  As someone trained in the sciences I did not find them very interesting.  In fact, I had to stop watching it in the evening because I kept falling asleep.  There was quite a bit of variability both with respect to the content and the facility of the interviewer.  At points it felt like the 'conversation' would have gone better if the roles were reversed, as clearly the guests, or interviewees had more experience with and comfort in public speaking.  The talks might have been more engaging if the roles were reversed.

I do not want to be overly harsh. In fairness, some of the episodes were entertaining, all of them (a little) educational. I think the problem for me was one of expectation.  Cognitive science is a hot topic at the moment and everyone seems to want to talk about 'the mind'.  I think if I viewed this with a different level of expectation I would have enjoyed it more.  I believe a more apt description would have been something like ""special topics in sensation and perception"".  Never is the mind or consciousness explored per se, which is fine, as long as one is not expecting that kind of dialog.

In sum, this is a series of interviews on specific aspects of thought, feeling or perception.  The guests are all interesting, creative people. The scientists are quite variable with respect to their talents as an interviewer, their ability to engage or connect with the person they are interviewing.  Each of them provides some information about their area of study which could be thought- provoking depending on one's background or interest in the topic.  I imagine that all of them, celebrities and scientists, would be interesting when fully engaged. Unfortunately that did not happen often.",1393804800,,3000,4.961923847695391
5777081,4,B00D7AM2WE,"Wow. What a mixed bag. Poor production values -- like a student recorded lecture series. Several times the powerpoint slides being talked about are never in view. But some of the talks are riveting. Fascinating. Not a slick documentary, more a collection of great YouTube recordings. Not as slick as Ted talks, but often the unscripted discussions are deeper and more like a graduate psychology symposium. Great big varied 'cast' of interesting characters. Not for general audience, but recommended for people with a strong interest in psychology.",1393718400,,547,5.2988505747126435
5777082,4,B00D7AM2WE,"If you're considering watching Brainwave your first question might be, How in depth or intellectual, are these discussions?  Will they be over my head if Im not learned in the topic or are they celebrity puff pieces that will bore me to tears?  At least thats what was on my mind.  My answer would be that the talks are somewhere between a University survey course lecture and an Oprah celeb interview but skewed more towards the University lecture.  I found two thirds of these Brainwave talks electrifying.  After saying that I should also note that the productions are uneven.  Not all episodes are as scintillating as others.  Theres nothing new agey or airy faerie about this series of talks on the nature of consciousness.  Its grounded in science as well as spiritualityin fact the spiritual aspect, may be down played too much.  The first discs lectures were fascinating though they were about topics Id put little thought into such as the nature of happiness with Eric Weiner, a writer and Emma Seppala, researcher at Stanford University.  Next up is performance artist Laurie Anderson paired with Janna Levin, author and physics PhD as they discuss Levins book How the Universe got its Spots.  Disc one finishes with a segment about anger with Lewis Black, a comedian who bases his act in large part on rage.  Hes paired with a psychologist Robert Allan whos studied anger.  This talk ranges wildly between science and silliness and almost fails but Blacks humor rescues it.  Disc Two lectures were mostly a miss for me.  It starts with a discussion on fear between writer R. L. Stine and professor/author Joseph LeDoux.  Lecture two on disc two is about the nature of appetite with Chef Mario Batali and Harvard professor Paul Rozin.  Last on disc two is a discussion on meditation between Buddhist meditation expert Loch Kelly and Professor Zoran Josipovic.  I expected to love this talk because Ive meditated almost daily for about 30 years but I was disappointed.  The discussion felt unfocussed and barely skimmed the surface of the purpose and potential of meditating.  The Disc three lectures were my favorite.  Episode 7 is between dancer/choreographer Mark Morris and Bevil Conway, a neuroscience professor at Wellesley College.

The episodes that are good are riveting and even though the filming is flawed sometimes and can be distracting the technical difficulties are transcended by the content.  The interview with the dancer/choreographer Mark Morris and neuroscientist Bevil Conway is not to be missed glimpse into an almost secret world where music, dance, and thought coalesce.  It seems like it would be difficult to discuss in a coherent way yet the interplay between the two speakers gives you a secret handshake into their world and for an hour you feel like you're a dancer with a dancers mindset.  Too bad the experience is marred by the echoing soundtrack.  Other technical difficulties in various segments include not showing graphics as they are discussed and, apparently, displayed in the background, odd camera angles, the back of audience members heads intruding onto the stage, etc.  None of that matters when the content is good but it can be distracting and/or amusing when the commentary isn't as interesting.  I like that the talks don't seem pre-scripted and run for as long as it takes to discuss the topic.  Most episodes, however, run for about an hour.  Besides the talk with Mark Morris the best talks are the three on disc three considering the nature of dreaming.

There is a booklet included which provides a history of dream research as well as brief bios on all the series participants.",1393632000,,3642,4.9702479338842975

Many of the ideas presented were interesting but the presentation and quality of the audio/video were lacking. Unlike so many great shows out there that have similar topics like Cosmos, Through the Wormhole, The Universe (and more) there were no special effects to wow you; just conversation.

In the first session, you did not see the presentation or screen that they spoke to through most of it, you just heard the voices and saw the two speakers discussing the topic.  Although the information was good, the presentation was so bad I have been unable to force myself back to watch the rest.  I will eventually update this review with more info, but my 3 stars are based on the material.  If the presentation had been good, my review would be higher.

8590362,2,B00D7AM2WE,"This is a 'comprehensive' compilation covering a 2008- 2010 lecture series delivered at the Ruben Museum of Art in New York City.  The various authors expound very slightly on their recently published books pertaining to various brain science subjects.  Or to put another way, this is what is called a cross promotional tool, one of marketers favorite ploys (I have a minor in Marketing).  This is an explanation written on About dot com, ""Their cross-promotions include ""bundled"" offerings, joint media appearances and events, and unconventional cause-related marketing. It might also include collaboratively produced how-to's and other resource booklets and videos, co-branding, coop advertising, and shared space.""  In this instance, the DVD is used to promote books.  Unfortunately, the DVD leaves a lot to be desired.

There are ten segments on the DVD.  In each segment an author is interviewed but someone who is an ""expert"" in that area.  For example, Episode 3 featured Robert Allan, a clinical psychologist and faculty member, who was written articles and a book on Anger, which is the featured topic, ""Getting Control of Your Anger"".  He is interviewed by Lewis Black, a Grammy-winning comedian, author and actor, who's comedy focuses on topics that anger most people, politics and situations, etc.  The ""f"" word is used throughout and it quickly loses its power to impress, in my opinion, due to its redundancy.  Shortly thereafter, his use of the f bomb is even discussed in detail as Black equates it as a necessity to express his frustration.  His role is to bring out pieces of the Allan's book that relates to his own anger.  To be honest, I found this one the most interesting of the episodes, however that isn't a compliment considering how dull this series is.

In fact, most of the authors were pretty impressed with themselves.  Initially, I was very interested in the segment of Janna Levin, Astrophysicist, who was so selective (evasive) in what she shared that after an hour, I just stopped watching.  Either she didn't think we would understand her or that by sharing to much no one would buy her book, perhaps it was a combination of both.  Her interviewer was the effervescent, Laurie Anderson, who is an artist and musician and she has released 12 albums.  Laurie asked some good questions to which Janna would give vague, incomplete responses and I noticed Laurie was getting a tad frustrated that Janna failed to elaborate, even rewording a previous question to elicit a response.  The only thing Janna did talk about is how light can wrap around something and then continue to project forward, which was possibly the only thing I got from this.

After committing 3 hours to this 9 hr. and 20 min. series, I quit.  The first episode was on emotions and the Neuroscientist, who was to be the interviewer barely got in a word because the Journalist, Eric Weiner couldn't stand not being center stage.  Talk about an inflated ego, he would realize he was doing all the talking then ask her opinion and often cut her off before she had a second sentence completed.

I can honestly say, I didn't learn anything new in the first and third episode.  I love learning and I felt like I was just being teased, I am surprised they didn't keep flashing the title at the bottom of the screen, so you'd have the titles ingrained in your memory.  I am guessing that the audience probably paid to hear these people (what a waste of money) and now that at least some of these books are just sitting in warehouses collecting dust.  Thus some highly paid marketing executive convinced the publishers to take these presentations and place them on DVD to get more money out of you and sell at least a book or two!

These ""interviews"" weren't even well done.  Two of the three that I watched, used a power point presentation which wasn't fully viewable on my 27"" tv.  Perhaps, they are fully seen on bigger television screens.  Even so, I didn't feel they add to the presentations.  It was just something to distract you from the various shades of ORANGE throughout the room, carpet, and chairs.  Let's hope some one with taste uses some of the profits from the DVD to upgraded the decor of this Art Museum!

If these authors' topics interest you then skip this DVD and buy their books.

This premise initially reminded me of the DVD, ""What the Bleep Do We Know?"", which I enjoyed.  I can not recommend this to others.",1398211200,,4427,4.787878787878788
8590363,3,B00D7AM2WE,"I remember living in NYC and hearing about these talks and felt a bit sad that I didn't have an opportunity to attend any of them.  So, I thought, here's my chance!  But my feelings are a bit mixed, both with the production quality as well as the quality of the speakers.  I really enjoyed Laurie Anderson (wonderful speaker!) and I have a new respect for Mario Batalli (also very good to the point that I can think of his as more than the guy with the orange Crocs).  I've always been hit or miss with Lewis Black and it's a little more miss with this one as he seems even more pretentious and snarky than usual.  But overall it was good - maybe not 9.5 hours worth of good, but probably 4-5 hours of it is good quality that really makes you think.",1397692800,,749,4.173611111111111
8590364,1,B00D7AM2WE,"I was giving this high hopes, as it was about the brain.
A few of the episodes were okay (the ones with Debra Winger and Henry Rollins), but for the most this was a major snoozefest.
I recommend seeking out a better brain program or documentary, as this is not up to par imo.",1397692800,,275,4.111111111111111
8590365,5,B00D7AM2WE,"I really enjoyed the beautiful combination of neuroscience and creative culture in this outstanding collection of dialogues! The alternating viewpoints were often insightful, really thought-provoking, and sometimes outright hilarious! Very well done with an excellent group of participants; absolutely delightful!",1395964800,,313,6.85
8590366,3,B00D7AM2WE,"Long long ago, in a different space and time, actually in my lifetime, I used to enjoy engaging in intellectual endeavors where the conversation begins with a topic and then explodes into a multitude of side but related conversations weaving an intellectual labyrinth of ideas where even the theories of Einstein are contested. Did I loose you? Well that is exactly what happened when I tried to watch this highly intellectual and absurdly esoteric dialogue between a collection of artists, writers and assorted brainiacs. I got lost immediately. It is not that the conversations are not engaging but it just requires too much attention for my pea brain. I did enjoy a couple of segments and lasted the duration.......sigh......such as the conversation led by Laurie Anderson and also the segment where Mario Batali participates. The whole show reminds me of a bunch of pretentious professors sitting around and discussing the infinite universe, or is it the finite universe? Looking and listening to how these peoples minds work make me happy and glad to be able to sit around and talk about the latest sports trades or acquisitions with a tasteless joke thrown in for a little levity  . This isn't my cup of tea but don't let me discourage you if you like some of the featured artists and want to listen to their ideas go for it, I challenge you to watch all the discs beginning to end without taking a wink that turns into shut eye.",1395705600,,1435,4.786290322580645
8590367,4,B00D7AM2WE,"Loved the conversations with Laurie Anderson and Mario Batalli especially. Overall, a fascinating and interesting series of conversations on a huge variety of topics, offered in a very casual and non-academicese way in front of audiences that are allowed to ask questions.

Hard to judge the whole thing overall, as everyone's mileage will vary depending on how you like the people who are talking and the topics at hand.

My only complaint is that a few of them seemed to go on too long. And like any conversation, sometimes the participants wander off topic which many times takes them to interesting places, but sometimes doesn't.",1395360000,,633,5.019047619047619
8590368,3,B00D7AM2WE,"There's some really good information in these DVDs, but a few of the presentations feature speakers so pretentious that I couldn't watch their entire interview. I normally love this New Age-y, shoot for the stars optimism, but it was too much in some of these talks. If there's someone you admire included in the program, it's worth a look, but I can't say I'd buy this.",1395273600,,370,4.621212121212121
8590369,4,B00D7AM2WE,"For celebrity watchers, this is a great way to really get to know their feelings rather than just see someone's exterior.  I find their conversations compelling and recommend this series to everyone.",1395273600,,199,5.21875
