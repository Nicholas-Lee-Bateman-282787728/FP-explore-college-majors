5859067,3,B00DV3A82I,"On a positive note, the movie makes a statement about the state of dysfunction of relationships in the black community often caused by our men being unable to provide for their families, due to a large number of them who have been in the prison system. Several story lines portraying ways that black women, though they love their men, often are tired and beat them down and how those with good men will sometimes tear them down and cheat on them.
Also depicted is how murder for nonsensical reasons is a common occurrence. Some characters were a bit too over the top and the movie made no attempt to make the plot realistic. For example, a bank manager would not have been allowed to make a decision on her cousin's loan. A psychologist or psychiatrist would not have been treating his sister in law, nor would it be wise for him to counsel women about their sex lives one on one. There were several humorous moments,so not a bad way to spend 90 minutes of your life.",1469232000,,967,4.468926553672317

5859080,3,B00DV3A82I,I will give it a E for effort. I don't knock anyone who makes a film and gets it to the public. The script was confusing in the beginning. I thought Malcolm was a church minister and was doing counseling sessions. After the movie keep going I realized that he was just a counselor. The story line was not too bad to be honest the movie just needed help technically. Whoever was the DP needs some more skills the camera work was not solid. The shots were shaky and the use of lens with the focus was off. If this is there first time shooting then I understand but at the end of the day the entire movies falls back on the EP and the Director. The film had it's moments I would like to see more work from Elyse. I support film makers that have the gumption to make a film. Congrats getting your movie to Amazon Prime this is no small feet. The actors are close friend and family members I can tell but hey when you budget is tight you use who can work with and for you. The young man that played the drug dealer was highly believable. The bank manager was a little over the top. The boyfriend that was stressed about selling drugs to support his family was a good character actor as well. Keep making movies that's the only way to get better and let people other than your close friends critic the films that you are making and they will point out what's believable and what looks good technically and what does not. Hope this helps.,1468108800,6,1431,4.226277372262774

This did not elude to behind close doors. More like ""Practice what you preach"" OR another type of title eluding to giving and taking advice, talking to a mediator.. bad title 6.) Did I mention the storyline is terrible? Just bad..... 7.)
