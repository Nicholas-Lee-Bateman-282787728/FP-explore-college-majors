And this particular volume, chronicling villianous manager Jimmy Hart and his 'First Family' of heel wrestlers, is a wildly entertaining place to start.
  I was a fan back in these days, but unfortunately, i didn't have a chance to see pro wrestling from Memphis. I heard, and read, about the exploits of long time local hero Jerry 'The King' Lawler in the wrestling mags, and always had doubts from afar about being sold on one rather ordinary-sized guy protecting the city of Memphis for nearly 20 years from every size, shape, and color of monstrous bad guy sent to 'destroy' the King.
  Those doubts were erased in blinding speed once I delved into the collection. Let me tell you, it doesn't matter how hardened, or 'smarky', of a fan you may be, when brilliant TV host Lance Russell and Lawler himself are guiding you along, you'll happily soak it all in, and enjoy wrestling like you were 12 years old again. The quality of video is largely outstanding; the generous clips from the Saturday TV tapings hold up best, and these are the real meat n potatoes of Memphis wrestling.
  Don't listen to anyone else, please-give one of these a try, and just see if you don't find yourself believing just a little bit again.",1312416000,,1433,4.6892430278884465
8382014,1,B002VFN5BS,"A little confused after buying the entire series of these DVDs. I thought they were going to be from master tapes or really good quality. Turns out, these are just from all the usual tapes circulating in the wrestling trade community. Nothing new here. Really disappointed.  I already had most of it in much better quality from a site called 70s-tv.",1287273600,,349,4.721311475409836
