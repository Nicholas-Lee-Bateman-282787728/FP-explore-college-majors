When I received it and loaded one disc on my DVD reader, I was surprise to see that it is made in two languages : english and french. You just need to select the language you want, and you have it !. For this price, you can be sure to watch all the series either in French or English.",1307404800,4,381,3.8974358974358974

8444784,5,B004W88M0G,I gave this to my boyfriend for Christmas since he started watching reruns on the Western Channel but can't always catch them. This way he never misses an episode. He was surprised and well-pleased with the DVDs.,1357516800,,212,4.756756756756757
8444785,5,B004W88M0G,"When I first watched previews of this series on TV I wasn't in the least interested in watching....perhaps it was a bad choice for a title but for whatever reason I didn't watch an episode until one evening it became the top ""too-watch"" program in a long list of poor choices. One episode and I was hooked! Purchasing the DVD of the series made me wish for more, but sorry to say, there appear to be no more new shows planned. A shame, there is a well thought out, well written plot to each story unlike some of the ""cookie-cutter"" shows presently available to view. hen you've seen one, you have basically seen them all unlike this series which has a new, clever twist to each story.",1344211200,3,684,4.393700787401575

8444787,5,B004W88M0G,This is a good tv show. Some of my favorite episodes are The Gambler Next of Kin The Highwayman Snakefinger among others. Nine times out of ten the gun works its magic. You should get this show.,1337731200,2,194,4.27027027027027
