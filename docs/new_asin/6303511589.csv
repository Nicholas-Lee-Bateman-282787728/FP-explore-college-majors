666358,1,6303511589,"This movie was terrible, but It had Pamela Anderson in it, and I think it was her first movie, so that makes it worth it. But don't expect any Oscar Winning performances from any of the cast members. (You've been warned).",1395360000,,221,4.414634146341464

666361,3,6303511589,"Great Pam Anderson softcore scenes when she was at her prime.
Story is regular, but you definitely won't be buying this movie for other reason rather than watching P.A in softcore scenes.",1357603200,3,187,4.875
666362,2,6303511589,"Snapdragon was released almost a decade before CSI but it would have made a decent first season episode with juUUst a few trims. Pare down its 98 minutes by removing the priest and ""doctor buddy"" characters (though we'd mourn for Matt McCoy), the same impeding flower cart during a ""wait, was that..."" tail, slow-motion flying disc on the beach, a flashback and a sunset recapping, and any of the myriad ""I know or remember nothink!"" delay tactics and you just might have the beginnings of a good TV serial episode.

But that's not going to happen: Snapdragon is a movie that relies on the ignorance of its characters. We must simply wait for them to get a clue or to trust the main character's frantic suspicions enough to stop admonishing him to ""Leave it alone!"" Dramatic cues are trickled out through many of the scenes described above until we finally reach the one librarian who snootily gasps ""You've researched the glyph but not the tongue?!"" Dun-dun-duUUuwhatever.

The ""glyph"" is a snapdragon tattooed on the thighs of sold children to indicate they're still a virgin and, given that the tattoo is never actually removed, one might wonder how many dirty old men overpaid for the privilege. The ""tongue"" is a razor hidden in the mouth and used to slit the throats of the slave owner's enemies, a ""last rights"" of sorts to guys who ""probably ejaculated after they died, while [Pamela Anderson] was still on top of them.""

Yes, yes, Pamela Anderson is ""Felicity"", the amnesiac with the classic symptoms of watching her parents die and being sold into sex slavery by the lady who runs the Mahjong parlor, all nicely summed up as ""deep-seated childhood experiences"". She wanders around having sex and killing people, dreaming about it, and sharing fortune cookies that say ""true love is always much closer than you realize"" with the ever-so-helpful main character psychologist Dr. David Hoogstraten.

Hoogstraten is something else entirely. Within this yawning 98 minutes of a film, his character actually, but subtly, develops. We first see him attempting sex with the bra'd Peckham, the vice cop who is leading the investigations into the sex murders. She's put on a blonde wig for his enjoyment, then ruins everything by biting him and suggesting ""every fantasy has to have a little pain."" Later, they attempt sex again, this time with her in a tank top, and he can't even be bothered to get it up. His first encounter with Pamela Anderson, however, sees him staring dumbly at the power of the bared breast and following through with copious face hugging. When he encounters her again, he eagerly initiates the unveiling of the breast and, by the third time, our boy is feeding like a champ.

Even with Anderson, even with Hoogstraten's amazing self-centeredness, and even with not one, but two, super-sekrit-didn't-see-that-coming endings, Snapdragon is just too slow of a film to recommend. I might suggest fast-forwarding to the good parts but it's quite likely most you have already seen Anderson nude a dozen times. It's just more of the same.

Death by: 1, 2: knife; 3, 4: razor blade; 5: razor blade (offscreen). Sleaze by: 1: sex, breasts; 2: sex (unfulfilled); 3: sex, breasts; 4: sex (unfulfilled); 5: sex, breasts; 6: lingerie, thongs, breasts; 7: sex, breasts, thongs.",1312848000,,3288,4.936708860759493
666363,2,6303511589,"Not a good film. Classic 1980-1990's scriptwriting bogs this film down big-time. Hard to believe, especially the guys girlfriend who is alright with him sleeping with Pam. Trust me, NO woman would just let this go so easily. Let's face it, the film's a bore EXCEPT for the nudity of Ms. Pam Anderson. Yes, she IS able to save the day her less (clothes) is more act. A very rare feat indeed, but Ms. Pam is able to pull it off (and her clothes!). You'll never see this film on T.V. in it's full form, so if like Ms. Pam (o.k. I admit I do) then buy the DVD. The beauty from Vancouver Island will NOT disappoint you.",1290816000,4,614,4.211864406779661
666364,5,6303511589,"The movie had an excellent plot. I never thought about there being two of those ladies. The lovemaking was superb, although I did not prefer the cost.",1250380800,2,150,4.592592592592593
666365,5,6303511589,"Read Jeremiah Johnson's review of the movies storyline, he pretty much sums it up. Other than that, I love Pam Anderson, am a diehard fan, and of course had to have this movie as part of my Pam memorabilia collection. Good storyline in the movie, a lot of beautiful shots of Pam, although it is not one for the kids to watch since there is some nudity to it. All in all, I love Pam, I love this movie, and will continue watching it over and over again.",1229212800,8,452,4.1477272727272725

666367,5,6303511589,Any big fans of Pamela Anderson will like this film....  lots of good shots of her.....  storyline is okay....  a bit of a murder mystery twist at the end....  but again it's mostly an excuse for eye candy......,1162512000,17,211,4.473684210526316
7849038,3,6303511589,"this movie was well made back in the early 90's it was well told and they were some good acting as well
a young 9 year old girl was kidnapped and eventually sold to the Japanese under ground, than sold to another
and used in prostitution and as she grew up , she got out of the business and tried to make it on her own,
but with all the bad memories she had and the bad feelings, it all came back ans he was started killing
the people that got her in that situation.
so now she loves in the states and there has been a call that a young lady was found off the shores naked and beaten
so the police go get her and put her in the hospital to find out what happened and she has lost he memory and ]has no idea of her name, she is sent to spend time in a metal hospital and they name her (Pamela Anderson)""felicity""
the killings start happening and the police cannot figure it out, but a police physiologist (steven bauer)thinks he figures it out,
his girlfriend at the time (chelsea field) is assigned the case and she has some ideas, but none of them work out, but the killings are still happening
the boy friend is now having sex with felicity now that she lives alone and has her own job at the flower shop
he never tells his girlfriend what going even after he finds out who , what and why this is happening
watch the show, to find out really who is doing this  and did the right person go down for it? you are left with the who . but is it really?
 there us nudity in the show , but it fits the story and you will at times get upset with the boyfriend when he is caught and you might even shed a tear
for felicity when you see what happens to her!",1520640000,,1649,3.9788519637462234
