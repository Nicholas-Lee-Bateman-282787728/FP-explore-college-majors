8473323,3,B000Q6NHEE,"These EastWest double feature DVDs turn up in grocery stores and dollar stores, and they're tempting as impulse buys. God knows I've grabbed more than a few on the basis of the colorful cover art and interesting descriptions. Beware, however, that you get what you pay for, and you usually pay $1 for these, so you do the math on that! The actual DVDs are terrible! Full frame, full of compression artifacts, faded prints, and an occasional defective disc are par for the course for EastWest.

TATTOO CONNECTION stars Jim Kelly as a CIA contact in Hong Kong going after some big fish. He does his thing, there's a foxy mama, and some good location action. Fun way to waste an afternoon.

NINJA TURF has no ninjas in it that I can tell. It's a lurid story about a new student who doesn't want to join the local gang. You can guess what happens. But that's ok. These films are like comfort food for genre film watchers. NINJA TURF in particular is colorful and confusing, with frequent shifts in tone and some dirty street rumbles.

Grab a few of these and sit back. But caveat emptor.",1294444800,3,1083,4.51530612244898
