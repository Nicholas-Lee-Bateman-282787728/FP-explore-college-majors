2583122,1,B000FS9FD0,"I have to say Albert Brooks must be one of the most retarded comedians ever for simply the title of this movie in its setting alone. I have not seen this movie, but even if it is any good, because of its ignorance i think it can only be mediocre at best. I am ethnically Pakistani so i know what im talking about when i say Albert Brooks needs to get his facts straight. India in which he spends almost the entirety of his trip in this movie IS 13.4 PERCENT MUSLIM. ITS A HINDU COUNTRY FOR GOODNESS SAKE! As Chris Rock would say, ""HOW IGNORANT IS THAT?!"" Only ignorant enough for an ordinary American with an IQ of 90 or less.  Its not appropriate to say its a 'Muslim' world - it would be MORE accurate to say a 'Muslims get Lynched' world which itself isn't entirely accurate but just trying to convey how far out the ballpark Albert Brooks went. The muslim world is vast and widespread - almost 20 percent of the WORLD is Muslim yet he chooses to go to a country which is again 13.4 percent muslim, WELL BELOW THE WORLD AVERAGE! Look i know what you're thinking, judge the movie by its true merit - the comedy. But sometimes when the facts are so incredibly off it becomes stupid regardless of the quality of the movie. Its like saying looking for comedy in the Christian world and going to South Korea which is 26 percent Christian. The absurdity becomes so deep rooted that the whole movie falls apart to anyone who knows anything about anything. Albert Brook pulled off a real theatric is in this one.  As far as im concerned, he was either an ignorant moron during the entire writing and filming of this movie or knew how little ignorant Americans understand about the so-called muslim world so he took a movie which talked about LOOKING FOR COMEDY IN INDIA and changed it to looking for comedy in the muslim world since it creates a much more interesting title in light of the so-called war on terror.

2583123,2,B000FS9FD0,"Early in ""Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World"", Albert Brooks learns part of his assignment will involve writing a 500 page report. Brooks doubts if he will be able to come up with enough material for the report. Will he be able to come up with enough jokes to wrestle this 500 pound gorilla and win?

Albert Brooks finds himself between movies when he receives a letter from the State Department asking him to meet with a new commission in Washington, DC. He meets with the head of the commission, former Senator Fred Dalton Thompson, and learns the government wants him to travel to India and Pakistan, stay for a month, and learn what makes Muslim people laugh. After he learns the secret, he is to write a 500 page report. His payment for a job well done? The Medal of Freedom. Upon his arrival, he finds it hard to communicate and decides to put on a comedy concert, to help him learn first hand what Muslim people think is funny. Soon, he begins to attract the attention of both the Indian and Pakistani governments.

""Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World"", Albert Brooks' new film, is a better concept than finished film. Brooks is able to mine the material for laughs, but I think any average comedian would be able to achieve the same results. What Brooks brings to the film is his self-effacing persona, his ability to laugh at himself and Hollywood, which is only successful part of the time, leading to an uneven film.

A 500 page report? The longest thing he ever wrote was for high school and it didn't even begin to approach 500 pages? Can he even come up with that many jokes? Can he come up with enough jokes to fill a 90 minute film?

The set-up is good. Brooks is initially delighted and surprised to receive the invitation from the commission, leading to many amusing jokes about his career, the state of his career, and his life at home. His wife, Laura (Emma Lockhart), an e-Bay-aholic urges him to go to Washington, to find out what they would like him to do.

Upon his arrival, he learns his assignment is to travel to India and Pakistan, stay for a month, find out what makes the Muslim people laugh, and write a really long report. Naturally, this sequence delivers a few jokes aimed at the government and sets-up a recurring theme which is, initially, funny, but tires very fast. The fact that the government, in their effort to understand the Muslim population of the World, is attempting to figure out what makes them laugh, is funny, but also scary because it seems so real. Can we really assume this is fictional?

500 pages! Brooks has trouble getting his mind around that figure. What can he write to fill 500 pages? Does he even have that much material?

The government promises first class transportation and accommodations throughout. When Brooks finds himself wedged next to two escorts from the State Department (John Carroll Lynch and Jon Tenney) in coach, the situation is initially funny. But the more Brooks carries on; the joke loses its impact. When he finds his new office is very run down and ill-equipped (no computer, let alone Wi-Fi), Brooks becomes even more sarcastic. Initially, this is funny, but the more he complains, the more annoying he becomes. He doesn't seem to realize that large numbers of Americans can only make such a trip by traveling in economy next to the crying, coughing children. When he arrives in India, his eyes seem to miss the equally squalid conditions surrounding him. When he complains, he comes to resemble the classic stereotype of the Ugly American.

Upon his arrival in New Delhi, the comedian interviews many people interested in becoming his assistant, providing an amusing, yet uneven sequence. Ultimately, he decides upon Maya (Sheetal Sheth, the Indian equivalent of the Julie Haggerty character in most of Brooks' films), an enthusiastic woman who wants to be a journalist. She provides him with a running total of the number of pages completed throughout the film.

One page.

Soon, Brooks decides to hold a free comedy concert, using all of his material, to help him determine what makes Muslim people laugh. The State Department co-horts find a school auditorium for him to use and Maya prints flyers for them to hand out. On the night of the concert, the auditorium is packed and Brooks begins his routine. Bombing horribly, he decides to check to see how many people speak English. The majority of the attendees raise their hands. He's in trouble. The concert sequence is funny, but only because it goes terribly wrong. When we realize this, and the sequence continues, and continues, and continues, it becomes annoying. The material is bad and when Brooks continues with it, banging us over the head with the joke, it just becomes tedious.

Two pages.

There are running jokes throughout; the State Department's inability to provide Brooks with anything he needs to complete his assignment, the continuing inability to bridge the communication barrier, Brooks dealing with the Indian population's idea of who is and who isn't famous, etc. Some of these ideas work, briefly, but when Brooks returns to them again and again, they lose a lot of their impact and begin to resemble extended skits on ""Saturday Night Live"", you know, the type that are funny one-joke premises but continue for ten or more minutes?

Three pages.

The concept of the film is amusing, but I have to wonder if it might have been more successful as a real documentary. The idea of Albert Brooks, as a character, in a fiction film, being played by Albert Brooks, allows the actor to take some critical digs at his career and he does his same shtick, but that's about it. He doesn't get what people are saying to him, leading to his trademark deadpan expression (funny), but then it goes on and on, and on. When he arrives in India, he realizes more people know him as the voice of Nemo's father. Funny, but, again, the joke goes on, and on.

By making the film fiction, with Brooks and others playing themselves, yet actors playing his wife, State Department officials, his Indian assistant, etc., the film resembles an extended episode of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"". This isn't necessarily a bad thing, if it were as funny as an episode of the HBO hit, but it isn't. By a long shot.

Four pages.

At one point, Brooks travels to Pakistan to meet with a group of aspiring comics. This idea is rife with possibilities, but the filmmaker doesn't seem to have the skill to back it up. As he performs his routine, his audience laughs and laughs, but the set-up for this scene robs the laughter of any legitimacy.

Five pages.

Towards the end of the film, it becomes clear he will never be able to write the 500 hundred page report. Maya indicates he maybe has four or five pages when circumstances force him to leave and return home. A brief Coda indicates that the report was six pages. And he didn't receive the Medal of Freedom. The ending is handled in such an amateurish way, I find it hard to write about. At a certain point, Brooks clearly seems to run out of ideas and the film has to end, so he ends it very quickly, in a way that seems all too forced and rushed. It almost feels like he was embarrassed and wanted to end the film in a hurry. I know I was embarrassed when I watched it.

Six pages.

Brooks never finishes his report and is unable to wrestle his metaphorical 500 pound gorilla. Brooks' metaphorical gorilla is called ""Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World.""",1138233600,4,7447,4.6694656488549615

2583159,3,B000FS9FD0,"The movie started great, with a brilliant premise that made me want to keep watching.  An American comedian is sent to infiltrate India and Pakistan to find out what makes them laugh.  Then the movie actually got boring as Brooks meandered through India with some painful and un-comic moments.  Ironically, while it was meant to backfire on the Indian audience in the film, too much of Brooks's schtick also petered over to the real life audience - us.  Although keeping with Brooks' self-effacing style, there really is a fine line between understated and lame comedy.  The journey is underwhelming, and the promise of the film never arrives.

I literally struggled with some of this, which is a shame.  This movie had tremendous opportunities to be many things that no other movie would ever attempt.  But we leave India and Pakistan no wiser than when we found it, which I acknowledge may be the point of the film.  Still, the whole episode leaves an unsatisfying taste.  It's a little like bring offered a steak and getting a regular Mcdonald's burger.

There are moments of Lost in Translation reality in the film that really resonate.  Others just fall by the wayside.  I give Albert Brooks credit in the form of an extra star for effort, but can't help but feel that if he had a co-writer or someone to engage him, this film would really have hit the jackpot.",1319932800,,1366,4.713080168776371
2583160,3,B000FS9FD0,"The moment I saw the title of the DVD ""Looking for comedy in the Muslim world"", I was immediately interested. You see I Purchased ""Axis of evil"" and laughed so much I recommended it to my friends/family and they loved it. Honestly I have to say that I was hoping the film would get better. There was nothing funny about Albert Brooks making a corny joke to a passerby ,who probably laughed because cameras were around or because of the lack of English he understood. The part where Albert is in the auditorium with his ventriloquist dummy friend ""Danny"" was such a failure, not only did the audience not laugh but I could see that Albert was trying so hard to create a comfortable atmosphere and it just wasn't working. I found myself embarrassed for him, not connecting with my audience would be a nightmare for me. On the bright side, I enjoyed his improvisation scene.  I do agree that his assistant for this project Sheetal Sheth made this film interesting  and her boyfriend was really funny without trying  to be. I laughed when he asked Albert after the show ""Was this your first time doing comedy"" or when he asked Sheetal ""how can you think it was a good show when the audience did not laugh?""

2583162,5,B000FS9FD0,"I am a recent Albert Brooks fan, and have been watching his movies from the past and currently as well, and enjoy very much watching as his movies depict his life, always with his unexpected takes on everything, The last one I watched was MOTHER that was GREAT.

In it he finally comes to terms with Mother and therefore is now able to allow a woman to be with him who is supporting and caring, not critical and demeaning.

And now we see the result in ""Muslim"", a loving relationship between him and his child and wife, I love the way he portrayes them.

I think this movie is really about his being a COMEDIAN and his own ego etc more than anything else, but as he pokes fun at himself and others too, it seems very genuine, I always remember that whatever he has his characters saying he is really saying ....when Penny Marshall is scoffing ""Why did you choose HIM? Why did they remake the INLAWS, ours at least BEGS for it!"" and then the casting director mentions that he's a good actor, it's all him saying these things.

He obviously KNOWS what's wrong with his comedy routine and the ending of ""Lost in America"" because he WROTE it in the script , along with his characters stubborness to see it.

I love the character of Maya, although it will be noted that he has her have a crush on him etc......

Of course along the way he pokes fun at the also challenges stereotypes, from the ineptitude of the government, to outsourcing of jobs, the idea of the comedy ""That Darn Jew"" is TOO funny.....and pokes fun at his own reason for doing all of this, in order to get that MEDAL ""That's the NICE one"", and inevitably he accidentally almost causes a war.....

It is also about understsanding comedy....Liked how he taught Maya about ""Sarcasm"".....you can't GET a joke unless you understand basic things about it......""It's called the ""Freeway""...but if you don't know what a freeway is or that we have them in California, it won't make any sense.",1271548800,,1948,4.501416430594901

After the first four scenes,  I checked the reviews to see if I should continue, but I had to see where was all this humor that the other people loved.  There were a couple of scenes that made me smile, but I did not laugh at all.

If you watch this movie, watch it on a Monday night and not a Saturday night.  Or better yet, meditate instead.",1263600000,2,504,4.144329896907217
2583164,4,B000FS9FD0,"This is in many ways a thematic ""sequel"" of sorts to Brooks' first feature, 1978's REAL LIFE -- Brooks essentially plays a version of himself, using his own name, and is making a documentary/essay type film -- so it's best to get comparisons out of the way quickly. It's not as good. But since REAL LIFE is to my mind one of the funniest films ever made and along with Brooks' next three films, a masterpiece, this isn't exactly damning.

I hate using the phrase ""acquired taste"", but if those words do have any meaning then surely Albert Brooks' works as writer-director-star all qualify for the adjective; his reviews have always been divided, the box office always mediocre-to-poor; his fans, though, are as fiercely loyal as any. I count myself as one and am happy to report that after the largely disastrous MUSE (1999) Brooks is back on firmer, funnier, and generally more interesting ground. The satirical premise here is that the US State Department, in trying to find new ways to open dialogs with those angry Allah-worshiping folks, have commissioned a study on what makes people laugh in the Muslim world. Right away Brooks is in his element as the simultaneously arrogant and egotistical, yet self-deprecating and depressed paranoid entertainer -- he learns very quickly that he's hardly the country's first choice for this mission, something that gets repeated often throughout the film. It's all the more humorous and (coincidentally) fitting that the head of the project is played by none other than third-tier recent presidential candidate Fred Thompson, and that Brooks is first sent to predominantly Hindu India (I guess we'd like to know what makes the Hindus laugh too, they're important and they might hate us some day).

If you know Brooks, you'll know that much of the humor from here on out will be subtle, low-key, and most of it at the star's expense, but the larger issues of American and Hollywood arrogance in the face of a different culture are never more than a moment's thought away. The bulk of the film has Brooks and his comely multilingual Indian assistant Maya (Sheetal Sheth) interviewing people on the street (the vast majority of whom speak excellent English, but of course don't know Brooks' work at all, apart from FINDING NEMO), staging a pretty unsuccessful standup show, and illicitly visiting underground Pakistani comics. Some of the best scenes involve his assistant's boyfriend, a jealous and insecure lover with both a suspicion of and fascination with western culture that is mirrored in Brooks' complex fears of him - as a potential terrorist (for no reason at all) and just as a boyfriend with a potentially dangerous misunderstanding.

This all gets a just a bit stale towards the end and wraps up rather unconvincingly, alas, but Brooks fans shouldn't fear, the man still has it - he may need some new ideas or insights to bring him back to the level of MODERN ROMANCE or DEFENDING YOUR LIFE, but at least he's got me laughing again.",1263600000,,2988,4.889546351084813

Better to give up than to go another one hour and 38 minutes marveling at how terrible this movie is. As another reviewer noted, it's not even ""good-bad."" It's just really ... bad.

The plot about a famous comedian...alleged famous comedian since the running gag of the movie seems to be that nobody knows about him much less cares tells you right of the bat that this is far from a ""thinking man's"" comedy as somebody else said. Age didn't matter either in me disliking (I'am over the teenybopper age a long, long time ago).

First the film drags on and on with unfunny jokes. Why would the government trying to soften relations with Middle East send Albert Brooks why not Jay Leno or Conan O'Brien, oh well. Like somebody else the stereotypical jokes (like the Call Center well all the technical computer questions in American are received by Outsourced Pakistans) gets old quick.

Even this side story (which I guess was supposed to be romantic) with Albert and his assistant Maya I think her name is wasn't really explored though hinted at many times (like her boyfriend is really jealous at her spending so much time with Albert). The jokes Albert throws at this Muslim/Pakistan are lame, very lame. Besides the character he plays looks utterly desperate in just compiling an audience to begin with. I guess this was supposed to be funny how an alleged famous comedian can't even get enough seats to fill a gymnasium but it just wasn't funny. Deadpan humor/Dry humor whatever you want to call it isn't always funny and this movie is living proof of that.

It's just a sad, bad movie. I wouldn't even call it ""it's so bad it's good"" movie it just really had nothing special going for it and you'd have to pay me to watch this again.

I wasn't familiar with Brooks' work before watching this, and now that I have seen this film I think I will be avoiding this 'comic'.

The film lacks humor on every level, and tries to set up jokes that fizzle and fail relentlessly.

The story is starts off on an interesting premise, find out what makes Muslims laugh. It then goes off on tangents, tells us nothing about the Muslim sense of humor, nor what makes them (or us) laugh. The standup show scene in the New Delhi hall was beyond awful and magnifies Brooks' lack of comedic talent. I remember thinking that these people aren't laughing not because they're Muslim, or Hindu, but because the comic is atrocious.

Other plot structures go nowhere, the assistant's jealous boyfriend for instance. This film could have had so much potential with the right script and right talent, unfortunately with Brooks' annoying tone and flat attempts at comedy, it goes nowhere.",1210032000,,979,4.844311377245509

There are one-liners and gags sprinkled throughout the movie, but the comedy really exists in the concept itself, with Brooks acting as the bumbling, egotistical, uncomfortable metaphor for US foreign policy itself.

2583177,5,B000FS9FD0,"I really enjoyed this Albert Brooks film. I especially label it an ""Albert Brooks film"" because he's so different and his humor so different that if you don't know what you are in for, you can be very disappointed. He is somewhat unique in that his humor is low-key, deadpan-delivery and full of sarcasm.

I love his sarcasm, so the guy makes me laugh. Many others watch a film like this and say, ""What's funny? This is not a comedy; it stinks."" Since I am familiar with Brooks' style and laugh at his delivery and self-deprecating and insulting humor, I knew what I was in for with this film. However, I knew this could be a ""bomb,"" too, like a few other of his films....but it turned out to be a very pleasant surprise: it was far better than I anticipated.

Brooks plays himself in the film and pokes fun not only at himself and his non-famous career but also at government bureaucracy. Without giving anything away, I thought that what happened on this trip to India was very funny. It also was a pleasure to enjoy the supporting cast, led by a very likable, attractive Indian actress by the name of Sheetal Sheth.

Overall, highly recommended but know who Brooks is and what he's about, or you'll be disappointed.",1189555200,2,1218,4.527272727272727

2583179,1,B000FS9FD0,"Did Albert Brooks forget everything he ever knew about comedy? Or drama, for that matter? I think I got arthritis from watching this, that's how painful it was to watch. My joints started swelling and throbbing with each terrible awkward not-funny moment which was definitely meant to make us laugh. The title is misleading as there is only a very small part in it where he interacts with Muslims (happens to be the one funny scene), most of the film takes place in Hindu India, but that's the least of its problems. All in all it's one unfocused mess.

The direction, by Brooks, is terrible; scenes go on just that one second too long ending up with Brooks making Brooks look terrible, lost, gasping like a fish on a dock. Even when we are supposed to see that these jokes are awful, the rule remains: you *still* have to make it funny. Simply told bad jokes lay there and really stink up the place, and there is so much lame humor in this that I began to wonder if there was something physically wrong with Brooks himself.

His timing, always excellent, is execrable here, completely off. He's not an old man yet though he ambles anciently through this movie like someone who once had something and is now slowly realizing that he no longer knows where it is. What is going on with him? I began to fear that I was watching the end of a career. Clearly, you can't take this film for a laugh, but you certainly can't take it for serious commentary either. I've been a big Albert Brooks fan since Real Life which came out in 1979. That's 28 years ago (he didn't register with me in Taxi so I don't count that). In both drama and comedy he has always been brilliant. My First Mister, a terrific film, was only 6 years ago. I hope this was just a touch of talent indigestion, a bit of spoiled one-liners, an overdone setup, a joke left in the freezer too long, because there's more burps than belly laughs in this dud.",1186876800,6,1915,4.406779661016949

His exploration into this totally unexplored vein leads to a hilarious, yet thought provoking movie.  True to his self, he plays the Albert Brooks that he knows so well.

And for all the ""dry humor"" I heard critics speaking of, I found none.  It simply did not work, and we only continued watching because we had already wasted so much time on it, and thought it could only improve - we were mistaken.

The movie is also very much mis-titled.  It should be ""Looking for Comedy in India"".

Sadly, the national HQ (Humor Quotient) is so woefully low that his consistently brilliant work over almost four decades has consistently been underappreciated.  In a just world, Brooks would be recognized as the national comedy treasure he so obviously is, but this is not a just world, so he has to struggle to get his movies made, and then when they're done they go unsupported by the studios that made them.

This is one of those movies where it's not funny, and it's not funny - and you're waiting - and it's still not funny - and you're thinking - okay, this boring hour has been a very clever set-up to something hilarious and then - it's still not funny - and then you can't believe it's over.  That - THAT - was a comedy?

It doesn't help that Brooks is not - at least as far as I can tell - a very funny person.  No - let me rephrase that - he is definitely not a funny person.  Apparently, in real life he is supposed to actually BE a comedian - not just play one in the movie.  In the context of the movie plot you're thinking - no way this guy ever made a nickle being a comedian.  Even in the plot of the movie everyone is telling him how bad he is!

He didn't bring much of a character to the screen at all.  I don't think he had more than one facial expression the whole movie long.  Had the writing been clever, his deadpan persona might have been tweeked into something funny, but it never happened.  Or if they had surrounded him with characters that showed him in a funny light it might have worked, but that didn't happen either.  Perhaps the problem was that he was writing for himself.  Maybe he is completely different live, if he does live shows.

That's true, but Brooks makes it look effortless even when his schtick calls (intentionally) for mediocre responses.  The audience for Brooks in this movie is Indian (South Asian, that is).  They, for the most part, don't get him.  He of course, enthusiastically moves ahead, trying to unravel exactly what will (eventually) make them laugh.  It is a funny premise, perhaps impossible to pull off, if you are anyone but Albert Brooks.

He is earnest in his efforts to dutifully fulfill his 'assignment' for the U.S. government.  That is, write a 500 page report on comedy in the Muslim world.

To me the real humor is in his dismay...not only his unsuccessful attempt to write the report, but at his hit and, often miss, attempts to get laughs where no American has gotten them before.  The jokes falling flat (as per the script calling for that) is very funny when juxtaposed with Brooks' all out efforts to do his best.

I wonder if those moviegoers who did not find the movie funny got the premise of the movie to begin with.

2583197,3,B000FS9FD0,"I am still not sure what the exact point of this film was - even after giving myself a day to think about it - but I guess it was about the need to understand and appreciate people as they truly are. The only reason for my uncertainty here, is that I am not sure the film actually achieved this, if this really was the intention behind making this film.

I think the main reason why I struggled with this film is that by the end I felt the racial and cultural stereotypes I had been exposed to, were actually reinforced in this film. I just felt that watching the film did nothing really to change my perception of people in India and Pakistan... but then again, maybe that was the point of this film. Maybe it was about us (the audience) having to realise that people are different, see the world differently, have different cultural, social and religious values etc., and just - well - realising that we are all different to each other.

Despite this, I did feel it was good that we saw something of the changing nature of Indian society. India is a rapidly changing country, and many western businesses now have call-centres in major cities (this was a recurring joke through the film). I also thought that it was good to show that people in these counties are proud, and fiercely protective of honor and decency. If anything, it is not so much we learning about these people from what makes them laugh, as learning about the importance of cultural, familial and social values - something being eroded more and more in so-called advanced western societies.

Probably the best scenes in the film for communicating the message of understanding each other, was where Albert was attempting improvisational comedy. The first attempt in India was a disaster, simply because he changed all the suggestions his audience had made - the very things which would make them laugh - for things he could make work into his routine as he saw fit to. Compared to him doing the same routine in Pakistan - where he actually used the audience's suggestions - we began to appreciate the idea that in order to see things from other people's point-of-view, we first need to listen to them, then respect their ideas, and then use them where we can. At times like this one felt there was a message behind the film, but I wish more time had been spent reflecting on the matter in subsequent dialogues.

This was a mish-mash of a film - trying to be too many things for too many people. Part Albert Brooks comedic vehicle, part moral vehicle, and part political commentary, it skimmed the surface of a number of issues, where it could have dwelt on one or two of them with greater effect.",1179273600,,2664,4.555323590814196
2583198,2,B000FS9FD0,"I've liked almost everything that Brooks has done, and I still consider Modern Romance to be a masterpiece.  Real Life and Lost In America had moments that had me on the floor laughing.  Defending Your Life and Mom were both funny and touching and showed Brooks maturing as a filmmaker.  With The Muse, though there were moments, he took a giant step backwards, and The Muse seemed more like a one-note sitcom premise than a film.  With The Muse I feared that Brooks may now be surrounded with yes people who tell him how great he is, and how everything he does is funny no matter what.

With Looking For Comedy In The Muslim World, this fear is realized.  Brooks has now taken to re-hashing his old bits, and he doesn't do them as well today.  At the same time, today's Albert seems so tired and there is no energy whatsoever.  Maybe he's trying to be the new Bob Newhart, but that's not his strength.  I was dying for some character to show up that Albert could confront like his agent in The Muse, but alas, the best we get in this film is Albert acting really annoyed.  His brother ""Super Dave Osborne"" has shown more emotion lately, and that is not a good sign.

Many jokes in the first half of the film work, but by the time we get to the Pakistan part in the second half you have already given up because there aren't enough of them.  And what could have been brilliant (with Brooks accidentally starting a war) instead goes nowhere, and I guess the end moral of the story is people will find anything funny if they're on dope.  Gee, what insight Albert.  I think I already knew that.

Roger Ebert (who is in poor health and who we all hope gets better and returns to TV soon) actually took the time to see this disaster and gave it three out of four stars.  In his review, and in sticking up for Albert, he attempted to explain some of the jokes in the film. Unfortunately, as we all know, if you have to explain a joke, it just isn't funny, and that ultimately is the problem with this film.

There's even a part in the film (one of the characters in the film is supposedly a big fan of his) where one of his fans is trying to help Albert but Albert doesn't want to be bothered.  (Perhaps an homage to Stardust Memories by Woody Allen, or maybe Brooks doesn't want to discuss other comedians who are still alive as he mentions in the film.)

Plus, something that is never fully explored is, are we watching Albert, or Albert as he thinks the audience sees him, or Albert doing a caricature of himself?

Here's hoping that Albert returns to his brilliant self soon and is willing to listen to some criticism instead of his Hollywood ""yes"" friends.  There's a reason films are released in January as this one was, and it isn't a good one.

2583201,1,B000FS9FD0,"There are a certain number of films released each and every year that aim to be controversial. Some filmmakers such as Michael Moore achieve their goal of becoming rich and famous. Others try and fail to hit their target. And then there are others such as Albert Brooks in the recently released Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World whose arrows land well short of the target altogether.

Basically, this movie is about Albert Brooks's going on a government appointed mission to discover just what makes folks laugh in the Islamic world and finding very little. Accompanying Brooks are 2 idiotic State Department flunkies.

For a movie that has ""comedy"" in the title, there is certainly little comedy in Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World. There are some genuinely funny bits such as the Polish eye chart. Another fun moment was the spoof on Indian call centers taking calls for American insurance companies, department stores and even the White House.

The movie itself is largely boring and there is very little genuine comedy in it. There are several misfires such as a Jew-hating Indian trying to get the Jewish Brooks to hire him. The movie does attempt to show that the Islamic world is generally humorless and that U.S. State Department programs in the Islamic world are both stupid and poorly run. Brooks spends a lot of time worrying about what to write down in his 500 page report to the State Department. Brooks also conducts a number of interviews with everyday Indians to try to find out what makes Muslims laugh. In any event, since most of the characters in the movie are either Hindus or Sikhs and not Muslims, its pretty evident that Albert Brooks himself is an incompetent.

The flick makes very little sense in its implied contention that there is no sense of humor in the Muslim world. The Three Stooges have been well received everywhere. Basically, the film has a counterproductive plot in that someone like Albert Brooks who has no real sense of humor himself is sent on a mission to find out what makes folks in a certain region laugh.

Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World is a waste and time and effort, not to mention your time and money.",1175212800,8,2172,4.720316622691293
2583202,3,B000FS9FD0,"Albert Brooks plays himself in this movie about a comedian hired by a U.S. government agency to gain insights into the Muslim mind by investigating what makes Muslims laugh. Since the U.S. has trouble getting access to any of the more solidly Muslim countries, it ends up sending Brooks to India, where there are still many Muslims living.

This premise has all the makings of a hilarious film. Brooks sets himself up in the kind of specific, Seinfeld-like situations in India that ought to produce funny, slice-of-life improbability. He finds himself underfunded and forgotten in bare offices In India, without any guidelines on how to proceed, but with orders to turn in a huge report in just a few weeks. He ends up going out on the streets telling jokes to nonplussed passersby to see if they laugh. This should make us laugh. But instead it all falls flat.

Part of the problem is that Brooks adopts a sort of George Costanza/Larry David persona for this role. He makes needless complications for himself by stating definite preferences and insisting on definite accommodations. This sort of eccentric self-assertion works in Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm. But it doesn't work here, partly because Brooks' insistences are just too trumped up.

Then there is at least one completely embarrassing scene where Brooks assembles some Indians in an auditorium and sets out to entertain them with his stand-up monologue. When he gets virtually no response, he spirals down into an insulting tirade. This tirade isn't as bad as the one Michael Richards (Seinfeld's Kramer) delivered to some African-American hecklers in real life. But it's bad enough.

This whole movie strikes the wrong note. I give it 3 stars because Brooks did come up with a clever, promising idea for a movie here. And I think a lot of viewers will be like me and will fill in the blank spots with their own, funnier scenarios. So you will get a comic movie out of this, even if it's spun out of your own imagination.

There were a few parts of this movie where I thought, ""oh, hey, that's okay.""

I am not saying that this should have been ""Talladega Nights,"" but someone should have warned Brooks that repeating the same shtick for close to two hours gets tired. In fact, if you're going to be an ""Ugly American,"" at least inject some enthusiasm into the irony. The only actor in ""Muslim World"" who seemed to want to play anything beyond wooden was Sheetal Sheth, who plays the cheery assistant Maya, who unflappably supports Brooks even as he bombs comedic.

After that, situations fizzle, flop like fish or just shouldn't have been developed in the first place. Having Brooks' office near a call center was a clever joke...ONCE. After the third repetition if comes off as bad Saturday Night Live material. Same with the anti-Semitic snips. Yes, Albert, you're Jewish. Good for you. Bad for Al-Jezeera. Next?

Much of the humor is situational and very subtle; it goes well beyond one-liners.  There are scenes, mirroring Discovery, PBS, and Geographic travelogues of India.  There are tiny taxis, holy cows, bustling streets of people in very colorful dress some religiously prescribed,  These directly contrast with scenes of Washington DC, so trim, uncluttered, with its Doric temples of power and humorless men seeking to find humor in others.  How can these peoples possibly understand each other? The parallel temples of power in India and Pakistan prove equally grim and unimaginatively populated.  It is no wonder this part of the world and DC are at war.  Brooks' talent for getting beyond the comfortable travel pix gives a new much neeed perspective.

Snippets of information are picked up by spies, take on a life of their own in a miasma of suspicion and fear and grow into troop movement and military engagements.  Grim offices filled with telephone operators respond in accented English as Onstar, State Farm Insurance etc.  Who are these people, who are these companies?  Brooks most able and ""almost-understands"" satire assistant tries valiantly to ""get it"" but always misses for one reason or another.  Not unlike Borat, Brooks reveals multi-national cultural blind spots with laser like precision.  It is important to realize that this film is as much about American perspective as it is about the ""Muslim world"".

If you like a bit of vinegar with your comedy, an added dimension that might reveal your own cultural blind spots, this film is for you. Like Borat, this film makes people nervous.  They sense there is something beneath the surface, some run away, others dig, then laugh and learn.  If comedy for you is an experience of pleasure laughing at the antics of a clown whose foolishness could not possibly resemble your own, pick up another DVD.  Chaplin in ""Modern Times"" revealed early 20th century man trapped in a machine age.  We are imprisoned in one with no humor to offer new dimensions for understanding and a truly healthy perspective.",1165622400,5,2308,4.973890339425587
2583212,3,B000FS9FD0,"I exected this movie to be awful after reading some of the reviews here, but I must admit I rather enjoyed it.  The comedy is subtle, and you have to pay attention to know when its happening.

Also, it get off to a slow and less than interesting start.  It doesn't seem like any of the actors broke a sweat making this movie.  For a while I thought I could ""watch"" it while doing something else, but things pick up after the story moves to India.  It made me wonder what would happen if a real project like this was ever undertaken.",1165536000,7,532,4.176470588235294

I can see how some could expect one thing, especially if they took the the title too literally, but, the idea of a comedian looking for anything outside of thier own sphere, is, in itself, very funny. The show Brooks puts on is one of the funniest ""anti-comedy"" set pieces I have ever seen. This movie is funny, different and marches to its own drum. If you allow yourself to feel the rhythm, you will love it!",1165017600,5,520,4.262626262626263
2583214,2,B000FS9FD0,"I'm going to be completely honest here, just lay all my cards on the table. I think Albert Brooks is one very funny guy. I've seen all of his movies and I laugh and laugh at all of them, even the one's the public goes against such as ""The Muse"". So when I heard about this film, lets just say my hopes were pretty high.

 ""Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World"" has a pretty good idea behind it but the execution is a bit off. The U.S. government has decided that their ""war on terror"" isn't really working. A new approach is needed. The government has decided they really don't know anything about the muslim world. And you can't fight a war if you don't understand your enemy. So, in an attempt to get inside the muslim world's mind, they have decided the best way to do this is to understand what makes muslim's laughs. If the United States can understand that, then they will understand the muslim people.

 After trying out a few comedians, a letter is sent to Albert Brooks (who plays himself in the film) asking him if he would like to head this committee.

 The situation is ripe for satire. Brooks could poke fun at the U.S. government, at bureaucracy in general, the cultural differences between the West and the Muslim world and list is endless for the potential a film such as this could have. But, somehow, somewhere along the way the first loses its nerve and doesn't fully engaged itself in the material.

 What I mean by that is mostly, the film simply falls flat. The jokes aren't funny, the situation becomes boring.

 The government sends Brooks to India and Pakistan, and while in India Brooks goes around as a sort of ""man on the street"" reporter asking various people what makes them laugh. But his approaches to finding this out are repetetive at best because the street approach is his only approach.

 What if he watched Bollywood movies? Found out about muslim comics?

 Joining Brooks on his journey are two government officials; Stewart (John Carroll Lynch) a wanna comic whom learns the secret rule among comics from Brooks, and Mark (John Tenney) a so-called ladies man who is constantly on the phone.

 Also with Brooks is his secratary, Maya (played by Sheetal Sheth, who is a new face to me, but, what a face! I hope we see much, much more of her in the future).

 The tough thing about reviewing a comedy is, it's hard to be serious in a review because what you really want to do is tell everyone all the funny jokes. But, because there are so few good jokes in the film, I'd be spoiling the entire movie for you if I did that.

 This is not to make ""Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World"" a complete dud. Brooks has written a few choice moments. Some scenes are very cleverly written and have comical exchanges that remind us of Brooks' other films. Remember the famous exchange in ""Lost in America"" concerning the casino giving Brooks back his money? Nothing in this film really reaches that, but, Brooks is trying here and there.

 Albert Brooks will be back again, I'm sure, but how disaapointing the film couldn't reach its potential. One thing to consider is Brooks wrote and directed the film by himself. Brooks usually collaborates with Monica Johnson, they have written ""The Muse"", ""Defending Your Life"" and ""Lost in America"" together. So their track record is pretty good. Brooks seems to need to work with someone. He needs someone to feed ideas to and give him input. Perhaps instead of trying to find out what makes muslims laugh he should have found out what makes Americans laugh first.

 Bottom-line: A surprising disppointment from writer/director Albert Brooks. The film is ripe of cultural and political satire but misses the mark. The jokes and the situations fall flat.",1164844800,3,3726,4.61060606060606
2583215,4,B000FS9FD0,"Brooks plays himself as he goes to India, at the request of the United States government to see what is funny.  It's a clever, entertaining film that reveals a great deal about Brooks.  He's self-deprecating and has a dry sense of humor.  Case in point.  Penny Marshall, who plays herself in the film, wonders why he agreed to do the out-of-towners.  As a sidebar, you'll see what a comic, which Brooks truly is, has to go through to get a laugh.  And in doing this, Brooks shows why he's a comic genius.",1164672000,,504,4.423913043478261
2583216,2,B000FS9FD0,"This quirky comedy had the potential to be pretty funny and/or actually say something about Muslim culture, and I was quite disappointed to find it met the first goal only partially and failed abysmally at the second - especially since the film spent most of its time in India, a nation I find fascinating (while it is by and large a Hindu nation, India does have a very significant Muslim population).  Frankly, I don't know what this film actually wanted to accomplish.  Stereotypes abound in the representation of the two foreign cultures, Albert Brooks spends a lot of time being conspicuously unfunny, and all but one of the secondary characters are without any substance whatsoever.  Albert Brooks' sardonic wit can be funny when he's complaining, but that's about all this movie has going for it.

Why is Brooks Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World, anyway?  Well, a special committee headed by politician/actor Fred Thompson, working under the auspices of the State Department, has asked him to serve his country by helping the American government understand what makes your typical Muslim tick.  Find out what makes Muslims laugh, as the argument goes, and you'll go a long way toward understanding them.  That's why they're asking Brooks, a comedian, to travel to India and Pakistan, spend a month figuring out what makes the people laugh, and write a 500 page report on it.  You'll hear a lot about this 500 page report, as Brooks goes on and on about the challenge of it, especially as time goes on and he learns almost nothing remotely useful or relevant.  Thank goodness for Sheetal Sheth, who plays Maya, the assistant/secretary Brooks hires after arriving in India.  Sadly, however, the script wastes a golden opportunity to reveal something about the life of an independent woman in Indian society, relegating Maya all too often as the only person in the entire film who finds Albert Brooks remotely funny.

I'll admit that I'm not familiar with the comedic work of Albert Brooks, although I do appreciate the type of sarcastic dry humor he seems to specialize in - but I don't see how even his biggest fan can find his big ""comedy show"" in India funny.  He actually opens with a Gandhi joke, which is not the best way to win over his audience.  At least they didn't have any trouble finding a crowd who could sit there stone-faced throughout the routine, as this show would be a total bomb in any country, in any language.  Having counted on the big show to discover what Indians find funny, Brooks' mission is all but doomed by this point.  And forget about Pakistan - Brooks has to sneak across the border just to spend a few hours with a group of ""budding Pakistani comedians.""

If the film has any point at all - and I don't think it does - it might be this: even our best-intentioned attempts to understand foreign cultures are too misguided or just plain stupid to ever have a prayer of succeeding - and sometimes exacerbate problems that we are too insensitive to understand or even recognize.  Even though Looking for Comedy in the Muslim Word is mildly funny from time to time, it is never the least bit insightful, and that makes it a pretty disappointing failure in my eyes.",1163808000,2,3205,4.735611510791367
2583217,2,B000FS9FD0,"I just don't know where to start on this one.  I really, really expected something better.  I really wanted this to be a good film.  And the sad thing is I believe it has a fantastic concept and would have been a fantastic DOCUMENTARY.  If you took that title, made a documentary film and properly executed it, it would be an Oscar winner, I promise.

Instead, we got this.  I chuckled at parts, but I think that's more because my wife and I have lived in India.  I have been the white guy living in that world, been in that position.  We had our nostalgia kicks with the film, but I just see a complete lost opportunity.

As I said, I've been in India.  My wife and I worked in a boarding school in the Himalayas and supervised a dorm with 30 9th grade boys from all over the world, all different religions and economic backgrounds. I have personally made Muslims laugh many, many times.  I've made Hindus laugh.  I've made Jains laugh.  I've made Buddhists laugh.  I've made Zoroastrians laugh.  It's not impossible.  It's not even all that hard.  But it is DIFFERENT.

Yes, really, this could have been a spectacular doccumentary.  Get a bunch of current commedians, take them over to India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan if you can swing it ... see what happens.  Examine comedy from those countries too.  It would be fascinating ... as a documentary.  But as a fictional story, this movie DIED painfully.  A lot of the acting, I felt was lacking.  It LOOKED exactly like what it was:  ACTORS acting like they're ACTORS but in the real world in their off time when they're not acting ... except they were visibly acting.

I don't think it even came close to getting the real india either.  There were hints of it.  When the lighting in the auditorium doesn't work ... I chuckled a bit.  Things rarely work properly in India, I could relate to it.  Seeing all the auto-rikshaws zipping around, stuff like that, it was neat to see.  But it really didn't feel like the place.  The actual INDIANS in the film looked like they were following a script and doing what they were told to do at all times.  I'd rather see it perfectly unscripted.

Even seeing an American's frustrations with the country as portrayed in the film didn't feel real.  Don't get me wrong here, PLEASE.  India is a neat place, but if you spend a significant amount of time there, you will have moments where you feel like you're going out of your mind.  When the power goes out AGAIN ... when you get atomic dysentery AGAIN ... Brooks' bits of frustration all feels like it was scripted long before ever setting foot on Indian soil and it all feels very minor.  When a shoeshine boy has cleverly put a turd on your boot so you HAVE TO PAY HIM TO CLEAN IT OFF, that's when you know you're in New Delhi.  India even looked CLEANER than I remember it.  I don't know what airport they used but it sure didn't look like Indira Gandhi International.  I honestly believe before shooting scenes, they probably had people come through and meticulously sweep up trash.  That's not real.  Where's the poverty?  Didn't see it.  That's not very real either.

I nitpick about that stuff because I think if you're gonna sanitize and give us a facade of india in that aspect, you're probably not going to get the real thing storywise either.  All sorts of insanity happens in India, that's part of what makes it simultaneously a maddening and charming place.  This film virtually misses ALL OF THAT.  And it's maddening to me because I think this idea had the seeds of brilliance.

I want to make it clear that I take no joy in slagging this film.  But I just can't honestly recommend it to anyone.  It wasn't interesting.  It wasn't thought provoking.  It wasn't funny.  I'm frankly surprised that anyone enjoyed it at all (and if you did, great, I'm glad it brightened your day.)  But I felt the whole thing was excruciatingly dull.",1163289600,3,3894,4.531700288184438

Even my wife - who has no sense of humor and fully intended to hate the film since I chose it - laughed. In the film, Albert Brooks plays himself as an underemployed comic who is recruited by the State Department to go to India and Pakistan to find out what makes Muslims laugh. The geopolitical rationale being that, if we could get the Muslims to laugh, they would be less inclined to spend their energies trying to kill us. Brooks figures that the best plan would be for him to get an audience to attend a stand up performance. He plans to simply run through his repetoire and keep track of what the Muslims laugh at. Ultimately this almost results in the initiation of a full blown war between India and Pakistan.

I often buy a dvd if the title or the premise interests  me and sometimes it works out and sometimes it doesn't.  In this case it did.  I was familiar with Albert Brooks somewhat, having seen his movie Mother on HBO and seeing Lost in America a long time ago.  I can't really say I was a fan, I certainly liked what he did but I didn't run out to see this in the theater.  It turns out I LOVED it.  It is a style of humor that either grows on you or doesn't.  We found ourselves laughing more and more as the picture went on as his style of humor just got under our skin.  He doesn't beg you or even ask you to laugh nor does he point to obvious things and wait for you to get it.  His show in the middle of the movie, where he is bombing badly, just got funnier and funnier as it went on.  I think it takes a lot of guts to write a movie where the lead character is a comedian and then intentionally fail miserably at trying to be funny.  That is something I had never seen before and it must have made certain audiences groan as the one in the movie did.  We were hysterical at this.  I also found myself thinking about this film long after I had seen it.  Not just individual scenes but the whole idea of it and the style of comedy that was different than other comedies I have seen.  I admire originality, and this filmmaker certainly is that.  After I told a friend about this movie he told me to get a hold of ""Real Life"".  I haven't seen that yet but from what he said Albert Brooks basically started this whole ""Mocumentary"" style of filmmaking in the 1970's, making fun of a genre that had not even been born then.... reality T.V.

2583222,2,B000FS9FD0,"The French have a word -- ""platte"" (you'll recognize it in words like ""plateau"" and ""platter"") -- that means ""flat."" But when applied to people, the meaning goes further to indicate someone who is irritatingly flat. ""Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World"" -- Albert Brooks's film about a government-initiated plan to understand Muslims by studying their humor-- fits the French meaning of ""platte"" perfectly. The film shuttles between LA, Washington, New Delhi and Pakistan, but never achieves anything approaching humor or even that feeling of satisfaction at watching the travails of real people. Brooks's humor is deadpan to the point of being nonexistent. And like too many unsatisfying movies, its best lines are all in the trailer.

The centerpiece of the film is Brooks's arrangement of a comedy night in New Delhi. He wishes to test various bits of humor on an Indian audience to see what works. Unfortunately, not only are his jokes unfunny to the Indians, they are unfunny to American ears as well, making me wonder what the joke was. Throughout the film, people ask the Brooks character whether (given his utter failure as a comedian in India) he really was a successful standup comedian in America. It's almost cringe-worthy to see a comedian highlight his professional failure so starkly. The film makes it clear that whatever propelled his success in the past has left him. The film's comedic situations are not ludicrous. A supposed joke -- in which his New Delhi office is very ""small"" -- fails completely. The office, while sparse, is a rather spacious, sunlit  2-room suite, with a desk and a leather sofa. It's an office I wouldn't mind having.

We learn very little about Muslims in the movie, and less about what makes them laugh. ""Looking for Comedy"" is lazy, uninstructive, unfunny and uninteresting. Not even worth a DVD rental.",1160352000,,1853,4.990291262135922
2583223,4,B000FS9FD0,".... and I hate it for you if you don't.  Not every Albert Brooks film is a keeper -- ""Lost In America"", ""Real Life"", and ""Defending Your Life"" are wonderful but ""The Muse"" was lacking and ""The Scout"" was just plain awful.  But Brooks returns to his wonderfully dry form with this movie.

His ""improv"" sketch during his failed(?) stand-up routine in Delhi provided me with some of the biggest laughs I've had recently.  He parodies hack comics, hack premises, the nature of improv itself, and slyly pokes fun at audiences (ANY audience) who lack the comedic sophistication to get the joke.

In an age where film comedies try too hard to deliver one-liners and easy-to-digest-and-understand humor, Brooks' humor remains gleefully subversive.

""Looking for Comedy..."" is absolutely worth watching.  If you ""get it"", you'll be won over.  If you don't ""get it"", then you're probably not who Albert wants to have watch his films anyway.  He is truly a comedian's comedian and a comedy writer's comedy writer.

For some ""Greatest Hits"" moments from his films, check out his ""missing the point"" rant from the movie ""Real Life"" and pretty much any scene from ""Lost in America"".

Albert Brooks is a national treasure.  If you simply don't ""get"" him, then fine -- more for me to have for myself.",1159833600,2,1285,4.844036697247707

2583225,2,B000FS9FD0,"There is a great, timely idea at the heart of Albert Brooks' most recent comedy, but as it turns out, the idea is the most inspired aspect of this 2006 film. As a writer and director, he has been on a gradual artistic decline since his peak, 1985's ""Lost in America"", when he effectively skewered the vacuity of materialistic yuppie values in a road-movie format. In this movie, he addresses an interesting topic, whether there is universality to comedy that transcends cultural differences at a time when hostilities have been peaking against Americans in the Middle East. The film starts out well with Brooks, playing himself and struggling to find his next job in Hollywood, is requested by the U.S. government to find out what makes Muslims laugh in India and Pakistan and submit a 500-page report about it.

The problem is that the story loses much of its relevant punch by setting most of the action in Delhi instead of a more Muslim-dominated area. While there is some humor in the scene where Brooks interviews for an assistant and a running gag related to outsourcing, the film continues to deflate with his character's persistent efforts to ask various Indians what makes them laugh and prepares a stand-up concert to test his comic relevance to a local audience. This leads to an overlong performance scene that belabors the point that a comedian needs to develop a rapport with an audience before they will consider laughing.

The story meanders quite a bit with tiresome stops at the Pakistani border and the Al-Jazeera network offices, but Brooks is so timid and self-absorbed in his approach that the film starts to induce yawns for its increasingly enervating tone. One intriguing angle is introduced involving suspicions about Brooks from the Indian and Pakistani governments, but the pay-off is minimal. In fact, very little momentum is gained from a number of subplots, including one involving Brooks' perennially cheery assistant Maya and her jealous Iranian boyfriend. As Maya, Sheetal Sheth provides one of the few bright spots in the film, but her character has little to do other than boost Brooks' morale. John Carroll Lynch has a few funny moments as a State Department agent who turns out to be a longtime fan of the comedian.

The movie does little to enhance the filmmaking reputation of Brooks, who still shows a gift for self-deprecating humor, this time going all the way by playing a fictionalized version of himself. Recalling his video shorts from the first incarnation of ""Saturday Night Live"" back in the seventies, I keep thinking this could have been funnier and far more pertinent as a documentary with Brooks actually doing the research with real Muslims. Given the poor box office reception to the movie, I am not too surprised that the DVD is very skimpy on extras - no commentary track from Brooks or anything that has him explaining the genesis of the film, just four unlabeled deleted scenes (including a silly gag with a New York cabbie in Delhi) and the theatrical trailer.",1159401600,4,3021,4.908023483365949
2583226,4,B000FS9FD0,"First off, understand that this movie has nothing whatsoever to do with Islam or Muslims. It instead focuses on myopia, with Brooks himself taking on the role of ugly American. Pretty much off the wall from beginning to end, the film makes it clear that neither the main character nor his government have any idea what they're doing. And worse, they don't care. A Senator, armed with a budget, charges Brooks with a mission to India and Pakistan to find out what makes Muslims laugh. He also gets assigned a 500-page paper because they need to ""justify the expense"".

Along the way viewers will learn nothing about Islam or India. Of course that's the whole point. We experience the film and the cultures through the eyes of people who have no knowledge nor any desire to learn about Muslim culture. Brooks tries interviewing people on the street by stopping them and asking ""what makes you laugh?"" He offends and confuses most of them, and his assistant doesn't understand all of the languages (India has quite a few). The group visits some laughing yogis but they again make no effort to understand them. Instead, Brooks suggests putting on a comedy show. Since he has no idea what people in India find funny, he falls back on old tried and true material (at least, tried and true in the United States). Of course it falls flat, but once again Brooks makes no effort to find out why. He assumes the people are the problem. But he does at least visit a mosque. That sums up the Islamic part of the film.

The Indian parliament starts to suspect Brooks. They decide to watch him. Brooks' US government cronies then set him up to visit a group of aspiring Pakistani comedians. But they have to cross the border illegally since their visas didn't get processed. Brooks sneaks in alone, smokes a hookah, and reduces the Pakistanis to helpless laughter with the same jokes that didn't work in India. The hookah probably helped. Though a success, Brooks once again doesn't make any effort to understand why. Unfortunately, India and Pakistan both begin to suspect foul play and start hoarding troops at their borders. Soon after Brooks gets called home for his own safety.

In his comfortable California home, sipping wine with friends, Brooks gets hailed as the ambassador of peace. At the same time the television announces escalating tensions between India and Pakistan. Of course he has learned nothing nor accomplished anything apart from annoying people. He even brings his daughter home a Taj Mahal snow dome; blatant tourist bait.

A fairly obvious metaphor emerges. Maybe a bit too obvious. Unfortunately, Brooks sometimes seems more concerned with message than narrative. The movie nonetheless contains many hilarious moments (the group takes a ""day off"" to  see the Taj Mahal, but they somehow miss it as it scrolls by in the background; again, myopia). But the entire project leaves behind a feeling, perhaps an intentional one, of ""what just happened?"" Also, a very noticeable downturn in energy occurs halfway through. The film builds up to this moment with amazing anticipation, and then unfortunately stops. If Brooks could have sustained that original momentum throughout, he would have created a masterpiece. Instead, we get an entertaining but slightly muddled film. But likely Brooks wanted viewers to feel slightly confused to simulate getting lost in another culture. Does it work? Hard to say. Brooks' cerebral style will disorient many viewers. Not only that, the film's title creates expectations that don't really get delivered. Of course that is, again, the point. But that point, along with the central message of the movie, will get lost on many audiences. Regardless, Brooks deserves some credit for his effort. Not many movies like this one exist. Some will welcome that fact, while others will bemoan the paucity of intellectualism in Hollywood. In the end, ""Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World"" deserves at least a single viewing. Whether viewers like it or not, they probably won't stop talking or thinking about it for some time.",1158883200,2,4062,4.9588839941262846
2583227,1,B000FS9FD0,"Never have I seen a more polarized set of reviews.  It's either one or five stars for this movie.  The question is, how many friends and relatives can Albert Brooks press into service for those inexplicable five star ratings?

The one star reviews state their position quite clearly: ""It wasn't funny.""  Well, comedy has to be the penultimate subjective medium.  More so than beauty, comedy is in the eye of the beholder.  As a confessed ""Fawlty Towers"" fan, I'm the last person to say that everyone should find one thing funny and not another.  All we can do is count the reviews and figure our chances that we might also find it funny.  Applying math to comedy, now that's funny Amazon.

It's the five-star reviews to which I take exception.  There are plenty of ""you just didn't 'get' its"".  While potentially true, why post it as a review?  Did it make you feel any better to say ""I'm smarter than you because I know why it's supposed to be funny""?

No fewer that three of the dozen or so reviews I read claimed this was a ""thinking man's comedy"".  I was under the impression that people like Mark Russell or Dennis Miller produced ""thinking man's comedy"".  Albert Brooks?  What is this metaphorical man supposed to be thinking?

Is there even such a thing as a ""thinking man's comedy""?  Victor Hugo is credited with saying ""the greater the mind, the simpler the pleasures"".  (Well, the equivalent French, anyway.)  Einstein enjoyed raking leaves, for example.  By this measure, a ""thinking man's comedy"" would include Larry, Curly and Moe.  None of that here.

I do believe that there is such a thing as thoughtful comedy, and certainly thought-provoking comedy.  This movie is neither of these.

Perhaps it's a ""fish-out-of-water"" comedy of cultural errors?  Possibly.  Albert's character made me cringe as he complained and whined about everything from the coach air accommodations to the taxi to the elevator that frightened him with a noise he didn't like.  He whines every step of the way.  I've never seen a more accurate betrayal of the provincial, self-obsessed, winging, entitled and pretentious ugly American.

""We are such a great nation that it is impossible to remain humble when abroad.  The world relinquishes its respect for us accordingly.""  Albert Brooks, playing himself, has mastered the role.

This move has surpassed ""Ishtar"" as the worst comedy since the creation of the motion picture.  Honestly, it is only AS bad as Ishtar in terms of a near-absolute lack of humor, but it wins walking away because it's premise was so incredibly promising!  Sending an American Jew to figure out what makes a radical Muslim laugh?  Brilliant!

I smiled when I first read the title.  I laughed when I read the premise.  I chuckled when Albert did Leno.  Who knew I was done?

So, if you loved Ishtar, S*P*Y*S, or City Heat, then this movie might be for you.  If you like ""thinking men's comedy"" (the kind where you don't actually, you know, laugh) then this movie might be right for you.  If you're Albert Brooks' mother, you might say you liked this movie.

Everyone else?  Run!",1158624000,8,3093,4.7965779467680605
2583228,2,B000FS9FD0,"Albert Brooks, as he has shown in films like Lost In America and The Muse, has an intelligent, idiosyncratic style of comedy. That, along with the provocative title of Looking For Comedy In The Muslim World, gave me certain expectations about the movie. Even though I wasn't sure up front if it was a documentary or fictional (it is the latter), the notion of a Jewish-American comic going into Islamic countries with the intention of making people laugh seemed daunting, original and unpredictable. Unfortunately, what was unpredictable to me was how tame and slight the movie turned out to be. The premise, that Brooks (playing himself) is being sent to India and Pakistan by the U.S. government to find out what makes Muslims laugh, is, if not believable, a decent enough set-up. The first problem is that the whole movie (with the exception of a midnight border crossing) takes place in India, a country that is primarily Hindu. Brooks has two American assistants with him on the trip. They aren't especially funny; you can't say they are ""straight men"" either, as Brooks' style of comedy is droll and low-key, so he needed some livilier or wackier sidekicks. He also hires an attractive young Indian woman to be his assistant. She has a red dot on her forehead, identifying her as a Hindu. Brooks interacts with surprisingly few Muslims, despite the film's title.

  The running joke of the film is that the people of India don't get Brooks' style of humor. In one of the longest scenes, he does a stand-up routine in front of a packed auditorium. There is scarcely a chuckle throughout the performance as Brooks vainly tries various jokes, improvisations and even a ventriloquist routine. Watching this film, I felt like a member of this Indian audience, not getting it. It would be fine for the film not to be laugh-out-loud funny if it were insightful about cultural differences or about the psychology of a comic. But it doesn't come close to reaching these depths.  He makes a joke about Halloween, an American holiday. When no one laughs, it isn't funny to watch. It isn't even sad or moving; you just wonder how anyone could be so clueless as to not realize the mistake. There is not much tension in the movie, aside from the scene were Brooks illegally crosses into Pakistan and meets some aspiring comics who don't speak English. When the translator repeats the same jokes that flopped in front of the Indian audience, the Pakistanis think they are hilarious. There is no explanation for this. There is a mildly amusing subplot that has the Indian and Pakistani governments thinking Brooks is a spy, but this, by being the funniest thing in the film, actually calls attention to how weak the main story is.

Because of the international incident Brooks inadvertently causes, he is sent home early. He kisses his wife and daughter and the movie is over, the audience left to wonder what it was all supposed to mean. This movie vaguely reminded me of another film, Lost In Translation (which I know many people liked more than I did). In both of these films, I had the feeling you were supposed to find people from non-Western cultures amusing simply because they aren't Americans. I think writers of comedy need to give us a little more than that.",1157846400,6,3260,4.783303730017762
2583229,5,B000FS9FD0,"I really liked this movie. After seeing it in the theater, I'm purchasing it now.

Much of it is subtle, classic Brooks' humor from his early days -- playing himself & incorporating some of his early stand-up routines - which I happen to like.

If your favorite comedies are from people like Adam Sandler, you may not like this movie because Brooks does not go for the easy laughs - but you should give it a shot anyway.  There are people who don't ""get"" the movie because he's delivering bad American jokes to Indian audiences - but that's the humor of it -- viewers laughing at other viewers not laughing -- Brooks' comedy pokes fun at comedy in general - and himself.

It was very refreshing to see a comedy (or any film) made in another country/culture like India - I wish American comedies would cross cultural boundaries much more often.",1157760000,8,843,4.562913907284768
2583230,4,B000FS9FD0,"No one can self-depricate with such a perfect measure of bravado and arrogance as Albert Brooks. I mean this as a compliment since this is classic Brooks.  Actaully it is a signature style he has used in  his other (and better) films. I like how Brooks always treats himself to a beautiful leading lady. (Woody Allen has a rep for this in most of his films as well.)  High marks to Brooks for creating such an original storyline, basically playing himself. ""LFC..."" is not a laugh-a-minute comedy that one less familiar with Brooks might expect. There are more complex nuances at work here..actaully there are some powerful political statements being made if you look deep enough (ala the ""big show"" improve sketch and the border military build-up subplot.) The movie has its flaws..sometimes you may wonder if this isn't simply an advert for his other films as there titles are sprinkled throughout the film. This is easily forgiven as the sharp dialogue, original storyline, and superb cast make this a nice addition to Brooks' tenure. Those new to Brooks that enjoyed this film should also treat themselves to 'Defending Your Life'..easily his best.",1157241600,3,1152,4.958549222797927
2583231,5,B000FS9FD0,"Intelligent comedy for those who care about politics in the world in which we live.  Nice sarcasm, w/ a tone similar to the great ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" (except that Albert Brooks actually has much better social skills than Larry David on Curb Your Enthusiasm.

2583232,4,B000FS9FD0,"LOOKING FOR COMEDY IN THE MUSLIM WORLD is a thinking man's comedy. If you're of the 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN or DATE MOVIE crowd, please avoid this film and spare us your ""It just ...sucks"" review.

If you're an Albert Brooks fan, you most certainly will enjoy his deadpan delivery and hyper-worried state that we came to enjoy during DEFENDING YOUR LIFE (I suspect this is why he was also cast as the father's voice in FINDING NEMO). But enough about Brooks. Let's see what the movie's about.

Looking For Comedy opens with Brooks arriving for a casting call at Penny Marshall's office (It's noteworthy to mention that Albert Brooks plays Albert Brooks and Penny Marshall plays Penny Marshall). Everyone seems to only recognize Brooks as ""that guy who played that fish in Finding Nemo."" His career is grudgingly winding down.

But upon returning home a letter from the government appears in the mail. He is summoned to Washington by a panel of Senators to do a research project for them (""Our first choice, quite frankly, wasn't available"" they tell him when Brooks asks `Why me?') And his job? Travel to India and Pakistan and find out what makes Muslims laugh. Oh. ""And you have to write a 500-page report on it.""

""500 pages? I don't think I've ever written anything that long,"" Brooks protests. But he accepts the assignment and travels with two government men as his entourage and support crew. Once in India they bumble through getting an office and a secretary named Maya (the stunningly pretty Sheetal Sheth). Now the hard work begins. Either people won't talk to him or give him off the wall answers or give no answer at all. So Brooks decides to put on a comedy show at a local gymnasium only to have that fall flat, too.

To add insult to injury, war bells are ringing between Pakistan and India, bells that Brooks doesn't help with by sneaking across the border into Pakistan one night in order to meet up with some future comedian hopefuls.

The thing that makes this film so funny is that it doesn't try that hard. It just is. Brooks' normal paranoia fits perfectly with the script and makes us laugh time and again at his overzealous fears. Also is the fact that it shows the complete ineptness of government in trying to understand another culture by sending someone to another country who has no knowledge of such a job. And they send him to India! Although there are a lot of Muslims there, it is mainly a Hindu country. An Arab nation may have been a better choice but obviously the government higher-ups failed to do their own research before sending in an even-less-informed Brooks. Now THAT is subtle humor. If you ""don't get that"", you should avoid seeing this flick. But if you enjoy that kind of subtlety, give Looking For Comedy a try. It's a modern day and cerebral blast!",1157241600,30,2794,4.657200811359027
2583233,4,B000FS9FD0,"There's just something about him, about his entire sensibility, that ""gets"" me in every one of his movies, no less so in ""Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World""; even if not everything ""works"" comedically or whatever, I always find myself with a large, dippy smile on my face - and a slightly larger heart - afterward. It's his whole artistic ""thing"", his entire package, the style, the tone, the observations, everything in its interaction with everything else - even if, as I said, not every little thing works in and of itself - that coaxes me into this exotic Albert Brooks land, where everyone looks at everyone else just that extra little bit too long and you can't not laugh. I could just sit and watch his facial-expressions and laugh. His hair makes me laugh. Admittedly, he isn't for all tastes, but I just gel instinctively with what he always seems to be trying to get at: communication, understanding, breaking down barriers, going beyond fear, and in a funny, wry, self-deprecating way. ""That Darn Jew"", indeed! He's a genius, of a quiet, harmonious, and connective kind, and one of the few celebrity-types whom I'd really like to meet and actually have a conversation with and not just meet to say I've met. You go, Albert!",1156636800,4,1239,4.7407407407407405

Then I couldn't stop raving about it, but when I tried to get my boyfriend to see it it was already gone from theaters!!! Seriously, if you like smart, grown-up comedies like Sideways, then this is for you. All the actors are wonderful, to the point where I found myself wondering if the Indian cast weren't actors at all but real people caught in action documentary-style (and maybe they were). Albert Brooks plays himself (so does Fred Dalton Thompson) so there is lots of blurring of the lines. It is also a subtle morality play about the dangers in assuming that everyone in the world thinks and believes exactly as you do (we can use this message now more than ever) -- if you are a Republican, don't let that dissuade you from seeing it, it is only a very small part of what is a very, very funny movie. There are illegal Pakistani comedians, a TV meeting with Al Jazeera and Albert Brooks does his old stand-up routine. So, so much to recommend this movie.

2583235,5,B000FS9FD0,This was my kind of comedy.  It's funny and smart and out of the mainstream.  Some comedies pound you over the head and others ask you to discover them as you are watching.  I put this in the latter group.  Albert Brooks has such an individual approach that it's too bad that some people seem to miss the point.  But to me his movies get even better with repeated viewings and I think that is always a great sign.,1153699200,10,413,4.177215189873418
2583236,2,B000FS9FD0,"Albert Brooks is sent by the US government to India on a mission to find out what makes muslims laugh. Why India? Yes there's a lot of muslims there but most of the people Brooks meet seems to be Hindus. No matter what they are they don't think he's funny. And he isn't. Not in this movie.

Initially, most of the jokes are based on how badly planned his trip was. He gets to fly business class instead of first class. Nobody comes to pick him up at the airport so he has to take a cab. His office is small and has no computer, etc. Funny? After that, there is a slightly amusing scene where he has a conversation with his secretary, Maya, and they don't know when the other is joking or not. ""Was that a joke?"". According to his plans, he was supposed to go to Pakistan, but he doesn't get a visa, so he has to cross the border illegally in order to spend a couple of hours there with some would be comedians. This makes Indian and Pakistani intelligence agents suspicious, and there's almost a political conflict. Brooks realises he has failed and goes is sent back to the US. The End. His wife, unaware of his failure, thinks he's a big hero. The political subplot about the conflict Brooks almost caused, is tied up by means of on-screen text before the closing credits. The main plot also goes nowhere. I'm not sure what Brooks tried to do with this movie. It's not laugh-out-loud funny, and it doesn't work as a dark comedy nor as a satire. Unfortunately, with this movie, real-life Brooks ends up like on-screen Brooks: trying, but failing, to be funny. ""Is that the joke?"". I'll never know.

So what we have here is a movie with no real laughs and a premise that could be funny, but goes nowhere. Too bad, really, because I expected this movie to be much better. Not recommended to waste money on.",1153094400,6,1805,4.369047619047619
2583237,5,B000FS9FD0,"I saw this movie last weekend.  Although i've never written a review for a film, the fact that i cannot stop thinking about it days later compels me to do so.  I couldn't imagine what he was up to when i heard the title of this movie.  One of my favorite movies is Defending Your Life and of course Broadcast News, but I'm less familiar with some of the earlier works that critics allude to when citing accolades for Albert Brooks and this movie in particular.  It has such a delicious satirical touch and is so hilarious, i was alternating between belly laughs and choking  with laughter.  Some of the situations are so absurd, they bend the mind in the most hysterical ways, that i've found myself repeating at least ten phrases of the movie and laughing.  Things that stick out in my memory are the first scenes with Penny Marshall-- what a brilliant send up of Hollywood.. then Fred Thompson, then the interview sequence and the polish joke and the double talker at the Temple.  With regard to Al Jazeera starting an entertainment network and a sitcom called ""That Darn Jew"" (no doubt referring to the old Disney movie ""That Darn Cat"") about the Jewish man living in a Muslim Condominium Complex.  ... to the Pakistani Campfire scene and Albert singing songs from Irving Berlin.  And the show.......what an amazing scene.  To bomb to one audience, while making the audience watching the one not laughing, laugh their socks off, just brilliant.  And yes, when someone has the balls to do that, they face some people siding with the audience that is not getting it, that's what made it so hysterical in the theater I was in.  The difference between this film and, say, the countless anesthetizing formulaic comedies that Hollywood assaults us with these days is the difference between a twinkie and a homemade double chocolate brownie. I wish this guy made movies every year.  We'd be so much better off.  America is Albert Brooks.

Before posting my review, i read one below from some one who didn't see the movie (?!), ALERT--the movie itself deals with the very issues the person who didn't see it is concerned with!!.  The issue of why he goes to India and Pakistan is dealt with expertly.  Albert rides on a raft of the American Governments' making- why go to there? As Fred Thompson puts it ""There's a 150 Million Muslim's in India alone... that enough for ya?""  As I recall, Thompson also says, ""You make the Hindus laugh, we'll consider this whole thing a success"" (yuk yuk)  That the government, and Albert's quest is ineffectual is the greatest gag in the whole movie.  It's called a satire.  Although after the cartoon I have little faith in the muslim comedy spectrum.  I think the world would be a better place if more people saw this movie (esp. ones who have the nerve to review it!), and more movies like this were made and people learned to get in on a great joke!",1139788800,27,2883,4.620825147347741
2583238,2,B000FS9FD0,"For those of us who grew up appreciating the comic genius of Albert Brooks in such classics as ""Defending Your Life"" and ""Lost in America"", this film will be painful to watch.  Brooks has frequently used his personal neuroses in self-deprecating ways as material for funny stories (for example, his jealousy in ""Modern Romance"", his writers-block in ""The Muse""), but here, he has taken it too far, in portraying himself as a comic that can't get a laugh.

Brooks plays himself as a has-been comic star who no one seems to remember or respect.  He's humiliated in job interviews for parts and can't find work until a special U.S. government commission asks him to travel to India and Pakistan to discover what makes people laugh in the Muslim world, and to write a 500 page report about it.  Here, Brooks is taking a swipe at our government's ham-handed approach to dealing with the Muslim world, but he is also saying something dark and sad about what happens to aging comics: they wind up doing silly gigs where no one laughs anymore.  Which is essentially what this movie is, as well as what it is about.

As Brooks goes on his trip, there are running gags about how underfunded and unimportant everyone considers his mission to be: his cramped coach airline seat, his tiny office in India.  These are supposed to be funny, but I found myself wincing more often than laughing.  Likewise, when Brooks performs his comedy to a stone silent New Delhi audience, it's painful to watch.  Mostly because the audience in India is reflecting the truth that the audience in the theatre feels: that Brooks just isn't being that funny with his tacky jokes and his 30 year old schtick.

Given the title of the film, one might expect much of the humor to be at the expense of Islamic fundamentalists.  But the joke backfires.  The people of India and Pakistan are perfectly capable of laughing, it's just that Brooks isn't funny.  Toward the end of the movie, in a scene that is the ultimate humiliation for the comic, Al-Jazeera proposes that he star in a new sitcom, generously translated as ""That Darn Jew"".

Fortunately, there are enough clever lines and cute bits to provide a few smiles and chuckles, and prevent the movie from being a total bomb.  If you don't know Albert Brooks, you might find it somewhat amusing to watch this American comic struggle in a foreign culture.  But if you do know Albert Brooks as someone who was once one of the brightest comic talents of his generation,  you'll find it uncomfortable to watch him play a comic who can't get a laugh.  Hopefully, it was just an act, and Brooks will be back with something funnier next time.",1139788800,5,2651,4.664516129032258
