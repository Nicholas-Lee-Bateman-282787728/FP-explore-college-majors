2290873,5,B0009H97I0,Good old fashioned romantic adventure with a great cast set in a very interesting and seldom covered time in history.,1312243200,,117,4.9
2290874,1,B0009H97I0,"The subject of the international intrigue surrounding the Duke and Duchess of Windsor's stay in Portugal after the fall of France could make a great film.  This is not it.  The casting; the script; and the acting all are supremely bad.  Robert Wagner in white dinner jacket with cigarette in hand acting as some kind of displaced Rick from ""Cassablanca"" is just silly.  Terri Garr is terrible in this. There's not a moment of real tension; real drama or real humanity in this. In a word: horrible.",1287878400,6,497,4.67816091954023
2290875,3,B0009H97I0,"Another great not well known WW2 story. Good acting and script. I have read a lot about SD General Walther Schellenberg, who headed the Foreign Intelligence Service of the Nazi Security Service (SD), and he is well portrayed in the film. Wish that other exploits of him were portrayed in film as well as those of SS General Otto Skorzeny who was head of the German Commandos. Another personages well portrayed were the former King of Great Britain and his american wife.",1191715200,6,470,4.7439024390243905

8060997,2,B0009H97I0,I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS STINKER.  This is a bad movie and there is nothing fun about it.  Teri Garr would have been OK if this had been a comedy.  Why they didn't go that way I don't know.  As it is she is awful.  The story was a bit lame and the direction could have been better.  There were some unnecessarily long pauses with glances that should have meant something but didn't.  I'm sorry I wasted the money to rent this.,1515369600,,425,4.109756097560975
8060998,5,B0009H97I0,Loved this movie. Robert Wagner and Teri Garr worked very nicely together,1465516800,,73,5.166666666666667
8060999,4,B0009H97I0,"Yes, it's a really bad movie but it is fun to watch...that's the only reason for the 4 * I must say that I am a huge Teri Garr fan & bought this movie because she's in it. I lay the blame for the horribleness of the move on the director and on the script. Teri and Robert Wagner are good actors but the director just doesn't do anything with their talent. And I can't tell clearly if the director failed the script or vice versa. Can't say for sure about the script being the problem since I haven't read the novel it's based on. The director appears to ask Teri to only be a femme fatale and Wagner to channel Rick from Casablanca. Wagner tries to act so cool that its really funny. Teri doesn't seem the damsel-in-distress that rises to the challenge type. The movie would be a lot better without the Robert Wagner part...Teri could easily be the lovely but strong woman who does not need a man. It would also have eliminated the totally ridiculous romance between Teri's and Wagner's characters. In the end, its a fun movie to watch to see and hear (she sings) Teri Garr and have several big belly laughs along the way.",1455840000,,1122,4.322274881516588

8061004,3,B0009H97I0,"I thought the story of this movie was quite good, but the movie was brought down a star due to the lack-luster acting.",1357862400,,118,4.173913043478261
8061005,5,B0009H97I0,"I watched this movie several years ago, and enjoyed it very much. For some strange reason I thought about it again. Did some research and found it on Amazon.",1346630400,,157,4.448275862068965
