These releases are still very educational and extremely entertaining to watch, that is of course if your into this sort of thing. Take it from me, trying to get people who have little interest in the space program to watch these is nothing short of painful. They would assume just watch static on the TV but for those who have an interest in the space program, these releases are nothing short of magical.

First off the STS releases are only 1 disc so its basically impossible for these releases to be as detailed as the other major Spacecraft Film releases. These releases are basically highlight films with some post flight stuff thrown in for good measure. To be quite honest I think this is a good approach for these sets as lets face it, these missions are much longer in length than most of the Mercury or Apollo missions so if Spacecraft films were to include all of the footage like they usually do with those previous sets, well not only would these sets be expensive and massive in size, they would also be incredibly boring as a lot of the footage that is taken is tedious at best. Turning these into highlight films keep the cost down and it allows them to condense the more interesting footage into a entertaining release.

STS-26 was labeled the ""Return to Flight"" launch as it was the first Space Shuttle flight after the Challenger disaster. Shuttle Discovery launched on STS26 on September 29, 1988. The primary Payload of STS26 was the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS-C). The TDRS is a series of satellites that allow communication with spacecraft in low earth orbit. The first TDRS satellite was deployed on STS-6 in April 1983. TDRS-B was lost in the 51-L Challenger accident.

The secondary payload was the OASIS experiment (Orbiter Experiments Autonomous Supporting Instrumentation System) which recorded a variety of environmental measurements during various in-flight phases of the orbiter.

The 5 man crew of STS-26 consisted of Frederick Hauck (Commander), Richard Covey (Pilot), John Lounge (Mission Specialist), David Hilmers (Mission Specialist), and George Nelson (Mission Specialist).

STS26 landed on Oct. 3, 1988 at Edwards Air Force Base.

Overall this disc contains mission highlights, the post-flight crew report and the press conference. This disc is really on par with all of the other STS releases. Again if you generally enjoy this kind of content then you should thoroughly enjoy this release, and all of the other STS release for that matter. If however you tend to stay away from this sort of material then you should continue to do so and skip this release. I openly admit I am a NASA/Space junkie and just cant get enough of this stuff. I have the 100% complete Spacecraft Films collection and not only have I thoroughly enjoyed each and every release, I also look forward to all of their upcoming releases.

The Bottom line - While not as impressive as some of the other Spacecraft releases, the STS series is still well worth your time and money.
