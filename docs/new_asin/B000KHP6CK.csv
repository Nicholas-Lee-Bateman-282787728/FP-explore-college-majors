8156965,5,B000KHP6CK,"I actually ordered this DVD about 11 years ago when I was 37 years old. I used to be a professional Ballerina (albeit YEARS ago), so I do know my workouts. I actually got my abs and arms in the best shaped they had been in in years, just by doing this 20 minute workout 4 times a week religiously and exactly as Gunnar Peterson instructs during the video. I did supplement this workout with some speed walking 2-3 times per week as well. Within 3 months, my clothes were fitting GREAT, my confidence was through the roof and I was sold! I quit doing this workout the past few years and trust me it shows lol. I just ordered the DVD again (the other's in temporary storage), and have only been doing it for 2 weeks, but I already feel stronger in my abs and arms. Can you really go wrong with a workout by a guy who keeps top celebrities in shape for a living? No! Try it, it's a fun workout and if you do it at least 4 times a week, you'll see results. (p.s. I use 3 pound hand weights during the workout at first, then work my  way up to using 5 pound hand weights eventually).",1491091200,,1078,4.084905660377358
8156966,2,B000KHP6CK,"I used to do Core Fitness with no trouble and good enjoyment, but several years have passed since then.  Now I am taking a med that causes dizziness, and I have trouble with any exercise that involves being on the floor and then getting up.  I also have to learn again to balance the ball when I am on the floor.",1459296000,,312,4.098360655737705
8156967,5,B000KHP6CK,Love it.  Is helping my abs and have another of his videos that I also enjoy.  WTG,1406073600,,82,3.764705882352941
8156968,5,B000KHP6CK,Very easy to do and follow this work out and it only takes 20 minutes.  I love this DVD.  Great for beginners and a way for people to stay in shape with little time.,1350604800,,165,3.823529411764706
8156969,3,B000KHP6CK,"Good ""emergency workout.""  Solid routine for those days when we just don't have enough hours in the day but a workout is desired.  In 20 minutes all major body parts are hit.  Strong emphasis on the core muscle group.",1344556800,,217,4.512820512820513
8156970,5,B000KHP6CK,"Gunnar Peterson uses the fitness ball to strengthen core muscles and shape the body in this 20-minute workout.  This challenging routine works the arms, tightens the butt and abs, and trims the legs.",1214784000,,199,5.03030303030303
8156971,5,B000KHP6CK,"I recently got (via Amazon marketplace) the Core Secrets DVD with ""FUNdamentals"" and ""Give Me 20"" and just did both of them for the first time this morning (I did a separate review of ""FUNdamentals"")

 This ""Give Me 20"" program is a fast paced 20 minute workout which primarily focuses on the upper body and core with just a little bit of lower body work. It was created primarily as an ""add-on"" type workout. I can see using it when one is short on time or as something you can do in addition to doing some cardio work. I actually did ""FUNdamentals"" first, then after a short break came back and did this one.

 The workout has Gunnar and several background exercisers, one who functions as a modifier. Here's the breakdown of the workout:

WARM-UP 3min
ball roll-out
supported side lunge
crouch back stretch
overhead back stretch
kneeling roll-out
chest/shoulder/bicep/triceps stretch
ball drape

WORKOUT 16min
weighted crunch w/legs on ball
upper/lower weighted crunch roll-in
side crunch
wood chop
(repeat woodchops)
""elvis"" rear lunges
bent-over rear delt raise
bent-over row
chest flyes
bench press
side lateral raise
shoulder press
crunches
bicep curls
hammer curls
tricep kickbacks
tricep dips with feet on ball (these are HARD!)
crunches (the next three exercises are similar/repeats of first 3 exercises)
crunch roll-ins
side crunch

COOL-DOWN STRETCH 1min
hamstring stretch
ball roll-out stretch
overhead back stretch
crouch back stretch
curl up

 I have quickly become a big fan of Core Secrets and Gunnar Peterson as an instructor. I am an advanced exerciser  but relatively new to stability ball work. I have several other (non-Core Secrets) stability ball programs, and while they are good, the Core Secrets workouts are my favorites for sure (I also have ""Accelerated Core Training"" and ""Full Body Challenge"").

 I highly recommend these programs to folks new to exercise (definitely start with ""FUNdamentals"" if you're brand new to either exercise, stability ball work or just haven't worked out in a while). For me they have all been money and time well spent and I look forward to using them as a regular part of my exercise rotation.

 Gunnar is a world class Personal Trainer and has designed excellent programs which are enjoyable to do and very effective. He gives concise, clear instruction without over-instructing and I find him to be very enthusiastic in a way that comes across as very genuine.

 The programs are filmed in a bright and roomy studio setting and the camera work is done in a way that makes the programs easy to follow (some programs I have in my collection try to get too artistic which make the workouts very difficult to follow).",1197072000,8,2675,4.977528089887641
