8755558,2,B01DD4KC48,"I am really not sure what I just watched. It was either so deeply profound that my simple mind could not hope to grasp the meaning behind what was going on, or it was a disjointed drug trip of a film that made absolutely no sense whatsoever.  Don't bother watching to the end -- there's no payoff, no explanation, no resolution.  It just...ends.",1505865600,,345,4.4603174603174605

8755560,2,B01DD4KC48,"8-5-17 Will never watch again.  Ending without any tying of any knots.  Rape scene was gratuitously long. Deserves to be reviewed with spoilers more detailed than mine.  Save yourself the research...just don't watch this.  Two stars because the film has some redeeming features but, whoa, where was the little bit more money it would have taken to make this a four star film?",1501891200,,375,4.904761904761905
8755561,5,B01DD4KC48,"The first time I watched it I understand absolutely nothing, but I had a lot of fun! It's a very odd movie and almost impossible to describe, let alone place in a certain genre (though I've seen it described as a ""horror comedy""). The movie is full of metaphors of the  current issues in Hong Kong, specifically political ones, which is why a lot of American viewers won't fully ""get"" it. The second time I watched it I went in knowing what it was supposed to be representing after looking the film up. This time I was able to catch all the things that didn't really make sense the first time.

Basically this movie isn't for everyone, and what you get out of it depends on your mindset when you start watching. If you're thinking ""this looks ridiculous"", then ridiculous is exactly what you're going to see if it. If you go in knowing something about Hong Kong, you'll appreciate it a lot more. Though I think everyone should give it a try, at least for the scene with Airplane.",1473897600,2,979,4.433333333333334
8755562,3,B01DD4KC48,"This is a decent movie the first hour and a half or so.  It then falls apart leaving you thinking what the heck was that.  As far as I can tell a bunch of people on a bus slip 6 years into the future where the city they were in has been devastated by a plague.  There is no one there and you see how they cope.  For some reason there are a bunch of Japanese people running around in gas masks.

Good idea with an ok execution with a very painful unending.  I normally get movies like this. This time I didnt.",1472083200,,508,3.883495145631068
8755563,5,B01DD4KC48,"I thought I would give my opinion after actually watching the movie. Heard about this one through an online review. It's in Cantonese, with English subtitles. This is a lot cooler then I thought it would be. It's hard to thoroughly explain, but think of Night of the Comet with a little Langoliers mixed in with David Bowie and Julius Caesar. Cool cinematic/visuals as well. Does get graphic at some points with language/situations. Really fun overall though. Glad I bought it!",1469404800,2,477,4.901234567901234
