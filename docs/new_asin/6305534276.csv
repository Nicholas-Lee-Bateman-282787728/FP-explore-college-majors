7891267,3,6305534276,"The ""Girls Gone Wild"" franchise has done what it does very well.  They basically get drunk girls in party situations to take their clothes off in public.  If you've seen one of their videos, you've seen them all.  I highly endorse getting ONE if this is your thing, but that's where the warning comes in.
Once the company gets your credit card number, they put you on an automatic mailing list.  You start receiving more of their collection, and the box has no invoice, just the tape.  If this happens to you, look carefully at your next credit card bill.  You may have gotten the first one at a bargain price via those seductive TV ads, but they charge full price for each of those.
You also have to research the web site on the box to find return information.  If you don't do it within 30 days, you're sunk.  When you do call to cancel, you get a hard sell to buy more products, and you have to insist to get taken off the list.
It's too bad this business practice leaves such a bad taste in your mouth, as the product is pretty good.  So enjoy, but be careful.",1033689600,48,1064,4.253731343283582
7891268,5,6305534276,"I can't put into words how amazingly erotic this video actually is.  It  may seem like I'm exaggerating ... but you'll have to see for yourself.  All I can say is that these are the same girls you have been trying to  picture naked since your freshman year in high school.  You don't have to  fantasize anymore because here they are!  And they are all grown up now!  This tape is the apittamy of what college is all about (besides the  learning part).  It's every frat party you've ever been to-all rolled into  one video.  The only difference is the women are ALREADY drunk!  ""Welcome to the party!""",959817600,,600,4.444444444444445
