8608257,5,B00EPRIRF4,"This disc, recorded in 2013 and also available on CD, continues the short series devised by the pianist, Roman Zaslavsky who also gives his reasoning for the choice of music in the sleeve notes. Roman Zaslavsky is one of the new generation of rising pianist stars. Fortunately his talents extend beyond accurate note playing and include musicianship too.

The disc gives about equal playing time to both Rachmaninov and Prokofiev. These two are coupled together on this disc because of their shared dates, Russian backgrounds and musical interests but also because of their divergences in both of these regards. The two composers knew each other personally but did not naturally have a great deal of musical empathy in common.

The pieces chosen to represent Rachmaninov are all short and consist of three preludes, three Etude-Tableau and two Moments Musicaux. These are all well known pieces and Zaslavsky plays them very well indeed. These performances would stand comparison with most, if not all, of the alternative performers.

The two Prokofiev pieces are both longer and consist of the relatively short third sonata and the longer seventh 'war' sonata. In his notes, Zaslavsky refers to the third sonata as for him 'the most romantic of all of Prokofiev's pieced for the piano' and he describes the seventh as 'one of the most dissonant of the composer's masterpieces.' This is not how I personally have thought of these pieces and Zaslavsky's two performances do nothing to persuade me otherwise.

The third sonata seems to me to be essentially far more dissonant than the seventh and it comes from a period where Prokofiev was particularly interested in such structures - his industrial period as in his operas for example. Furthermore Zaslavsky plays the third in a way that does not lessen its discordant or motoric aspects. Conversely the seventh is played with obvious lyricism wherever possible and the more motoric sections of the outer movements are played with tight control as essential. This is a more lyrical performance than the famous Pollini recording and is slower than Pollini by a significant degree. This lessens the aggressive side and increases the lyrical side. As a further reference, Zaslavsky takes a slightly slower approach than Boris Berman's recording too. He is far better recorded than either and his performances are equally convincing and satisfying.

There are two ways of enjoying this Blu-ray disc. The best sound, and this is very easy to hear, is to choose the audio only version which will deliver excellent 4.0 surround sound at 24 bits and 96 kHz. The alternative way is to take the video option which will perform like any other video Blu-ray with crisp imaging and with sound delivered in surround 4.0 at 24 bits and 48 kHz. In effect the listener/viewer has to trade sound quality off against video availability. Both are very pleasurable but give completely different experiences. (The difference in kHz relates to the frequency range supplied). Presumably the quality of the playback equipment is also a consideration and this will be an individual situation. The test equipment on this occasion exceeds the information on any known disc so it may illuminate extreme sounds not normally heard.

Whatever the playback arrangements, this disc offers a thought provoking concept and fine performances in both state of the art sound/video. I would therefore suggest that this disc will give plenty of pleasure to both musicians or 'technophobes,' or both where those two interests coincide.",1385251200,,3541,5.1282495667244365
