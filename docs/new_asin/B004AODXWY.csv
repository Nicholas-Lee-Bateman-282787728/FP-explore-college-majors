8420609,4,B004AODXWY,"I enjoyed this B movie. I tracked it down because I love Taimak. Unfortunately, he is in the film for about twenty minutes. He does well in his scenes and I'd hoped that he'd be in the whole movie. No such luck. Taimak and Pak made a great team in the beginning of the film and they should work together again. The writing for some of the characters could' have been better. There is plenty of action. Action fans won't be disappointed. The acting of some of the players is wooden. However, the abundance of  exciting, fight scenes will keep your attention. This film has basically nonstop action. I'll definitely watch this film again. Recommended for action fans and fans of Taimak and Pak. This film would be rated PG-13. No nudity or graphic violence. Plenty of martial arts violence and bloodless swordplay. One mild curse word.",1464739200,,833,4.666666666666667
8420610,5,B004AODXWY,The fight scenes in this movie were great.  The story moved well and the characters kept you wanting to see more about them. Taimak does a great job. A must see if you love mixed martial arts.,1371686400,,192,4.1891891891891895

The answer is that when left to his own devices, Pak's output is boring, as best expressed by ""Book of Swords"" - a film so inherently lackluster that it collected dust for almost a decade after it was made before receiving distribution, and then only via overseas outlets. Trust me, there's a reason this one never saw a North American release.

The story: policeman Lang (Pak) attempts to avenge the murder of his brother at the hands of a vicious crime syndicate, unaware that he's about to become the key player in the reckoning days of an age-old prophecy...

God, what a good cast this movie squandered... Along with Pak, the film is practically a reunion of ""Mortal Kombat"" performers, including Richard ""Kano"" Divizio, Dan ""Johnny Cage"" Pesina, and Katalin ""Mileena"" Zamiar, along with Kevin Christie (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ultimate-Game/dp/B00005YAJX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ultimate Game</a>), good ol' Taimak (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Dragon/dp/B00005JD5H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Dragon</a>), and Pak's own brother and fellow&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WMAC-Masters/dp/6304067887/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WMAC Masters</a>&nbsp;alumnus Ho-Young as part of the ensemble. Needless to say, I expected a lot from this unique fighting cast, but was disappointed terribly by their collective misuse and underutilization. There's more hand-to-hand action in here than in Pak's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/future-starring-picture/dp/B001LXIDUE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">future starring picture</a>, but next to none of it is very good. The choreography is decent at best but the camerawork is awful - the fighters are rarely filmed below the waist - and a decisive lack of sound effects makes the fights feel like homemade efforts. Only two of the brawls are any good at all (i.e. the last two encounters: a sword randori and the Pak vs. Pak showdown) and none of them feature any recurring fighters other than Ho-Sung.

The beginning of the movie teases some intrigue about this ancient prophecy with some deep-voiced voiceovers and fantasy illustrations, but the ensuing storyline focuses so much on the basic revenge plot that when something supernatural does actually happen, it's both a shock and too little, too late. Long stretches without dialogue or action (Lang likes to walk around and investigate things) are just as tiresome as boring conversations about Lang's relationship woes or expositional monologues about the prophecy. Scenes that should have been filled with tension - like when officers Pak and Taimak engage an undercover drug deal - just don't pull off the suspense, mainly because none of the characters have been written well enough for you to care about what happens to them. Additionally, none of the performers can act worth beans, with Kevin Christie's performance as a crazy main henchman being the absolute worst.

The fact that the ""Mortal Kombat""-affiliated performers pay homage to their video game personas through appearance and fighting style is pretty neat. In a pinch, you could even consider this film an alternate universe to the MK world; it's just too bad that it's not a cooler one. I really can't recommend this movie to anyone, since it neither fulfills the obligations of a good martial arts movie nor is so bad that it's worth watching for comedic value. Condensed, ""Book of Swords"" is a slow, dark, humorless kung fu film that feels like it has no idea of the potential greatness its cast and independent nature affords it. Don't bother hunting it down like I did.",1309824000,3,4604,6.567434210526316
