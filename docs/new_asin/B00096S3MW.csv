2268908,5,B00096S3MW,"'Noir' was my introduction into Anime, and I have been hooked on genre it ever since.  The artwork is incredible, the music is mesmerizing, and the voice actors (both the original Japanese AND the English dub) are perfectly suited for the characters.  This collection transcends anime - it is a presentation that anyone can enjoy.

Which brings me to the story itself.  It is spread out over 26 episodes [each approximately 21-23 minutes long), and it plays like one 11+ hour long movie.  With that noted, it can feel 'slow' in some areas (especially early on) - stick with it during those 'slow' areas, because every line, every flashback, adds to the overall building of a story-line that crescendos into a magnificent finale.  By the closing episode, you'll not only be satisfied with the conclusion - you'll wish it had never ended.

Be advised, however - if you are one of those who lives only for anime that is chock-full of mecha and fan service, you will be disappointed.  You will find no giant robots or random panty-shots in this anime, which is one of the things that I find so appealing about it.

If you are a person like myself, someone who enjoys action-adventure presentations that are mature and character-driven, I highly recommend 'Noir' - whether you are an anime fan or not.",1117756800,103,1296,4.75

2268926,5,B00096S3MW,"Let me start off that this show was pretty much kick a**, not only that, but it gives off a great mysterious vibe that drives the plot. Definitely an anime classic that deserves more attention for it's originality and execution all together.

The entertainment value is fairly high for it's creative action scenes and it's engrossing plot regarding the two protagonist's unlocking their crucial past. Kirika Yuumura an enigma, who doesn't remember much of the past and Mireille Bouquet a skilled assassin with a haunting past.

The visuals and artwork are top notch with all the beautiful scenery that look like true water paintings themselves.
Animation is smooth and flows naturally with the action scenes.
And for the music (composed by Kajiura Yuki) is what really drives the show emotionally and makes it quite memorable.

This a mature show, not really in the sense of containing sexual content but in the sense that there is little to no comedy and no fan service or generic cliches. It focuses more on life and death and the theme of perpetual sin. Don't get me wrong, it's not a show that will depress the life out of you, but more like make you think.

2268941,5,B00096S3MW,"Noir is French for ""black"", and a moody and dark journey this is indeed, with music that brilliantly matches the mood of the series. To a certain extent this is inspired by the dark film noir crime films of the 40's and 50's with their moral ambiguity and lack of clear answers, combined with stylish French films of the 60's. The result is something that is stylish, dark, and satisfying.

Unlike some of the reviewers, I feel that the first part of the series was the best. We meet our two assassin protagonists -- stylish Parisian Mireille Bouquet and mystery girl Kirika Yumura (whose brutally effective style is called ""garish"" at least twice by Mireille) -- and their uneasy relationship as they perform assassinations and deal with attacks while learning about each other and, to a certain extent, themselves. There is a sense of brooding mystery, of plots within plots, darkness within darkness, and these episodes are often very dark indeed. Unfortunately the last third in particular foregoes much of the character development in favor of non-stop action, which makes it satisfying for some people, but I would have liked to have seen more about, for example, the Lady Altena's past and what made her the way she is. Though the little we are shown in flashbacks is chilling enough to let us know that it was bad, real bad. Which is one of the things that makes this series far far superior to the typical action series where the Big Bad is evil because, well, because. Moral ambiguity is a hallmark of this series, Altena does some evil things, but is her purpose good? In the final ending, is her programming good enough that the survivors will achieve her final goal? Is that final goal even worthy? Due to the way the series ends, we'll never find out.

My one complaint is that at certain points artistic license was stretched to the point of revocation. Main characters being wounded at certain points in ways that should have disabled or killed them, yet they survive to kill their enemies. Certain situations where even three super-assassins should have been overwhelmed, yes, the intent was to show that these are some bad-a** characters but the body count of mooks got ridiculous at times. Then there were the things that just grated on me. For example, professional killers having trouble killing? Maybe that is justified in one case, where one character has despite herself grown to love another of the characters and thus refuses to kill that other character, and it was the entire point of an episode where we find out that Kirika is kind to cats and has trouble killing one particular person because of that fact (among others) but there are certain points where simply pulling the trigger would have left time for some of that character development while not harming the integrity of the plot. Another annoyance -- one of the characters is supposedly one age, but that age is far too young to have performed an act she remembers performing many years before, an act that was also witnessed by another character and thus likely happened, meaning she actually must be several years older than she looks and that we're told. And finally, the ending does not resolve the mystery of Kirika Yumura, such as, what is her real name, and from where did she come? What happened to her memory? Does she ever get it back fully beyond that one pivotal scene that replays over and over? That failure to answer some vital questions points to the desire at the time to make a second season or OVA's, neither of which happened.

Still, despite its flaws, this is indeed a worthy journey. Just try to space things out a bit when you view it, because so much darkness in concentrated doses can be a disconcerting journey indeed.",1357603200,,3734,4.741538461538462

2268946,5,B00096S3MW,"This is more a review of multiple reviews I've read for all the different DVD versions available than it is for the series itself.

I'm finding the reviews as interesting as the show itself.  The reviews originally convinced me to purchase Noir.  I appreciate shows that make me think, and leave things open for interpretation.  This seems to be what makes some people love this show and some people hate it, and I see that people seem to interpret it completely different.  It seems to me that the director got exactly what he wanted.  The viewers are mostly saying the same things.  It just seems that some people like what has been done, and some people do not like it.  Now that I've watched the series, I can definitely understand both sides.  One person said that he hated the dubs.  Since I don't speak any Japanese, I always watch the English dubs.  I would guess that the original Japanese voice actors had their own take on the characters.  There are some English voice actors that I try to follow.  Monica Rial that plays Kirika is one of those actors.  I thought she did an excellent job.  Especially considering the lack of overall dialog for Kirika.  Some people said there was too much violence, and other people said that there was a large body count, but very little gore.  Again both true, it depends on what bothers you, and what you are watching in the show.

I do have to agree with one person that said the reviewer for Amazon seems to have seen a completely different version.  He really did get a lot wrong, and I think he generally didn't like this type of series.  One of the reasons I like reading all the reviews is to see what people liked and didn't like.  I found some people that agreed with me in really liking the series, and some people that disliked the series for the same reasons I liked it.

Overall, I would definitely recommend Noir.  I liked the conflicted characters, and conflicted plot.  I also found myself at times wondering if I should like them.  (After all, they are assassins).  There is definitely a theme of can bad people have good traits, and can good people have bad traits.  This runs throughout the series.  Sometimes low key, and sometimes blatant.  My best suggestion is to read a bunch of the reviews, and take the parts that resonate with you and then go with your gut.  Pretty much everything that would make you like, love, hate, or be indifferent about the series is in the reviews.  If you read the good and the bad reviews and want to buy it, I think you will love it.  If you don't want to buy it after that, then you will probably want to look elsewhere.",1353024000,,2623,4.468354430379747

2268948,5,B00096S3MW,"Bee Train's original Girls with Guns series. Noir follows Mireille and Kirika, two young women who are both searching for the mysteries behind their pasts.

Mirelle is a ""most trustworthy assassin for hire"" who is approached by Kirika, a Japanese schoolgirl who suffers from amnesia and is more deadly than even Mirelle. Kirika wants to understand how she knows how to do the things she can and why she doesn't feel sorrow when she kills. Mirelle on the other hand searches for the truth behind her parents deaths and who killed them. The two quests are seemingly bound together by a pocket watch and the melody it plays that Kirika found when she first awoke with no memories. While very different the two grow on each other over the course of the show and the camaraderie and friendship between them is as much a part of the story as the search for their pasts. The series boast very nice animation and an excellent soundtrack. The melody of the pocket watch which is a theme of sorts for the show is haunting and the action scenes are coupled with a faster paced beat that flows along with them.",1337385600,2,1098,4.573604060913706
2268949,5,B00096S3MW,"Noir is undoubtedly one of the best anime series of its kind to date. A straightforward action thriller with no giant robots, no magic, no fan service, no aliens, mutants, ninjas, vampires, talking animals, mad scientists or cyborgs whatsoever. Also, in keeping with the crime films of the 1940s and 50s, the visual depiction of bloodshed is kept to an absolute minimum. A welcome change from the buckets of blood motif prevalent in most current anime and hollyweed offerings.
  While the art and animation are well done, the main highlight of the series is the brilliant and beautiful music composed by Yuki Kajiura; it is simply breathtaking.
The excellent, dramatic opening theme ""Coppelia's Casket"", is composed by Mikiya Katakura with lyrics by Arika Takarano and performed by Ali Project. The title and lyrics make dark reference to the french ballet by Saint-Leon and Delibes.
 The ending theme ""Kireina Kanjo"" or ""Beautiful Emotions"", composed, written and sung by Akino Arai is quiet and elegant; one of my favorites.
This current release of Noir by Funimation combines the original 7 volumes of the series into 5 discs with the entire 26 episodes on the first four discs and the extra features on the fifth. It is a true classic in every way.",1328572800,5,1252,4.9523809523809526
2268950,4,B00096S3MW,Great Amine at it's best. When I first saw this movie I knew I had to have it.  It's like Mezzo but deadlier.,1321920000,,109,3.739130434782609
2268951,5,B00096S3MW,"Perhaps the most succinct way to describe Noir would be as the ultimate buddy picture. Although not readily apparent in the first few episodes, it is first and foremost concerned with the relationship of its two central protagonists, Mireille and Kirika. While there are assassinations aplenty, laced with a Gnostic-like plot to rule the world, Noir simply uses those things as a backdrop to explore fate, forgiveness and, most of all, friendship.

Like any work of art, Noir is not something that will appeal to all tastes. Every single frame of its 26 episodes is suffused with an almost majestic mournfulness and melancholy. As a result, it unfolds slowly, emphasizing character development over plot, not really kicking into high gear until it is almost two-thirds over. Although the backgrounds are beautiful, the low frame rate and frequent re-use of earlier scenes through flashbacks - while done cleverly - will drive many to distraction, betraying as it does what must have been a very low budget. There is, as has been pointed out, a flashback towards the end of the first episode to earlier in that same episode.

The music, while thrilling to many, and an organic part of the storytelling, is the kind of Enya-inspired synthesis that will drive some to leave the room.

Noir is a story of assassins where there is much killing but almost no blood. Where we have two central characters who are basic, standard issue film (and anime) clichs:  the young (Japanese) high school amnesiac and the also-young (French) girl with dead parents and a chip on her shoulder. Little wonder then, that such a set-up might alienate a fair number of viewers.

As well, the plot is driven forward by a where-have-we-heard-this-before device:  the so-called Soldats, a super-Mafia, little-known in the world at large, but apparently in control of just about everything that matters, everywhere. It comes as no surprise that they seem to want our heroines dead.

But those of us who love Noir realize that none of these things is really central to the true story the creators are trying to tell. We recognize Noir as a rich tapestry whose central figures are richly developed in the stories told in the first bunch of episodes, before exploding into a perfectly laid-out final narrative arc explaining everything we have seen since the beginning.

Noir isn't so much a story about kick-butt assassins or world-dominating crime syndicates as it is an extraordinary tale of friendship; a paean to forgiveness; and an admonition to never give in to what appears to be your fate.

Noir announces itself in its very first episode when Mireille, the French half of the duo, observes Kirika, the Japanese amnesiac, silently reflecting in an empty school classroom as they are about to set out on their adventure. She awkwardly quotes Ernest Hemingway, ""Even in a crowd, I was always alone.""

And this is what Noir is truly about. Two desperate and lonely young women, with strangely intersecting pasts, and every reason in the world to detest one another, who slowly learn to accept and trust the other in a bond of deep friendship.

If this sounds unappealing, I would advise you to leave this series on the shelf. No work of art appeals to everyone; indeed, many appeal to only a few. It's no mark of dishonor to dislike Noir.

If, however, you're not turned off by the idea of a deeply emotional series where there is little dialogue and often what is not said is as important as what is, then I would suggest at least sampling this truly astounding show, for if it turns out to grab you as it did me, just as finally happens with Mireille and Kirika, it will be a thrilling experience to discover that you are not alone.",1318723200,12,3709,4.823622047244094

2268967,4,B00096S3MW,"I just finished watching this series.  I found it to initially be slow moving, and the hidden parts of the tale started really becoming clear towards the later half episodes.  I disagree with the Amazon. Com review stating that the 'amnesiac' characters weren't all that interesting.  In fact, I very much came to like the protagonists, despite the somewhat played-out theme of killer without memory.  And I found them interesting, their tales gripping, and the dialogue well thought out (there is not a large amount of dialogue in this series, but what is spoken is not wasted).  Chemistry between them seemed real as the series played out.  If anything surprised me the most, it was the bloodless nature of the extreme violence from a graphic viewpoint.  The music, outstanding.  I've put all three soundtracks on my IPOD.

I plan on watching the entire series again very soon, at least one more time.",1289088000,,903,4.8881578947368425

The story isn't very compelling. The art isn't that great. There's no amazing movement that makes up for the so-so art in many anime series. The music is pretty good, and it certainly makes up for some the poor animation during the action sequences.

2268973,5,B00096S3MW,"The Good Things
*Good action scenes.  Every episode contains at least one good fight scene.
*Excellent animation quality; motions are mostly fluid and artwork is splendid.  Settings are very detailed and distinctive.
*The story is continuously intruiging.  It may not make sense at first, but once the mystery is unravelled, it's interesting.  Repeated viewings reveal more details, too.
*Aside from the main story arc, there are also a number of good stand-alone episodes with good stories.
*Characters are very well-developed.  They have a large number of subtleties, backgrounds, and issues that make them very memorable.
*Great emotional impact (although this could also be seen as sappy).
*Bloodless action and implied sexuality makes the show edgy without being too graphic (rated 15+).
*Excellent music.

The Bad Things
*Slow pacing may be too tedious for some people.
*Flashbacks are repeated throughout, and can be seen as annoying.

The Questionable Things
*Some parts are really silly when you think about it (like Chloe's fascination with a fork, or the fact that Kirika stands in the line of fire and never gets hit, or the part where she gets shot in the head and lives without a scratch...).
*Strange ending (still don't know why Mirielle didn't shoot Altena, but it all worked out in the end anyway).

It's a slow, emotional, character-driven European drama, but still has a lot of slick action.  Once I got into it, it was very immersive and fascinating, and has become one of my absolute favorite anime shows.  Highly reccomended to anybody who has the patience.

DVDs have good video and audio quality, and contain a number of interviews.  Episode 21 has a hilarious easter egg (push up, down, left, and right on the remote during the second eye-catch to see an 8-minute sock puppet video!).",1216339200,2,1810,5.057239057239057
2268974,4,B00096S3MW,"I wasn't really sure what to think of this Anime at first, the description was very intriguing and the reviews were great.  Then I started watching it and things moved pretty slowly, I figured that was to play up the intrigue factor since it was about secretive assassins.  Although they're more of the independent contractor type and not really working for anyone.  Anyway, I did get into this show pretty good eventually.  It really pulled me in around disc four when I really started to wonder what was going on and wanted more answers.  However, I still don't totally get that first episode, ah well, I should go back and watch it again now that I finished the series.

Noir takes place in France, primarily Paris, which is a breath of fresh air for me and all the Japan based Anime I've been watching lately.  I have nothing at all against that location and it makes obvious sense as to why most creators would set it in that location, but I really am impressed to see someone create something outside the box.  On that note, let me say how impressed I was with how they managed to capture that atmosphere.  It does have a very good French and, especially, Parisian atmosphere, you could say.  The whole premise of the show just worked perfectly in that location!  Anyway, I'm getting side tracked.  Noir is about two assassins that seemingly meet at random, but they could be connected.  The main character Mireille is a professional assassin that's being brought deeper into a world of intrigue where she will meet her destiny and find out who she truly is.  The strange enigma of Kirika Yumura seems to find her way into Mireille, but one can only wonder how ""accidental"" this meeting was.  Kirika shows very adept skills at killing people, even better than the professional Mireille can boast!  However, a major secret society and force in the world has taken notice of the two (or have they always been watching?) and the two seem to share a tragic, yet self realizing fate.

Noir is a story of essentially super assassin's and Kirika and Mireille will have to triumph over all the hardships thrown at them.  I loved the onset of the secret society quietly controlling the world and how the two main characters had to deal with this seemingly indomitable foe.  It has a very ""Templar"" styled concept you could say, but without it having a downfall on Friday the 13th via the Catholic Church.  Keeping with French style there are heavy religious overtones, but they speak in different and jaded terms.  They say words like ""Sin"" and ""Salvation"", but the meanings are inherently different and more akin to that of secret society concepts.

As you can see this is a very serious Anime, there really is no comedy in here and it's a very dark and tragic Anime as well.  I really liked that change of pace, even in some of the more serious Anime there will be at least a couple humorous situations, in this one there are basically none.  The characters are complex and sometimes far removed from reality and in their own world, so they can be hard to identify with, but that's the whole point.  You're not supposed to be able to identify with them, they don't really live in our world, they are physically here, but mentally they are elsewhere.  The one thing that really annoyed me about this show was the flashbacks and the over repetition of scenes.  The flashbacks were only half useful and they seriously had flashbacks that were way too long and the same thing too much.  It was just unnecessary, it's not like I forgot what happened in the flashback in episode 20 when I'm watching episode 21.  It really just got to the point where it was tedious and I would have rather they had 20 episodes and less flash backs.  Maybe the writers thought the story was too complex?  I don't know, all I know is that my memory is better than they apparently think most peoples are.

I was originally going to give this a 3, but the overall story line towards the end pushed this into a 3.5 (would be a solid 4 without the constant flashbacks) with rounding to a 4.  All this comes in a neat box set with seven slim pack DVD's, that feature interviews and sketches as bonus features.  The way they generated the mystery with the characters was quite admirable and I ended up really getting into them quite a bit.  The ending is very tragic, to me at least, because it didn't end the way I expected or really wanted it to.  However, I do see why they decided to end on that note and I think it's a good ending, especially since it wasn't predictable for me.  However, the build up to the mystery of Marielle's parents became pretty obvious after a while and when they're about to reveal the answer it got frustrating because they drew it out for a long time!  (That's not a bad note, just a humorous one on my part.)  Anyway, if you're looking for a good serious Anime with very dark themes, then this is definitely the way to go.  I think its funny how all the super assassin's are all female as well, I don't know why, it was just weird to not have them fight at least one highly trained male character.  Instead every single henchman was male and they were all slaughtered, so expect a lot of high gear action sequences.  Noir is more than just action and girls though; this is also a thinking person's Anime and has a lot of elements for people to get into.",1215907200,,5356,4.5020703933747415
2268975,4,B00096S3MW,"The female version of the Bourne Identity.

Noir does a lot of things bad.  There is a high body count in almost every episode.  It's really tedious and makes every episode basically the same story.  Sure there is some ebb and flow in the relationship between Mireille and Kirika, but the story is really predictable.  The connection between Noir and the Italian mafia mob is largely pointless.  Things really go downhill with the final confrontation.

2268977,5,B00096S3MW,"As other reviewers have indicated, ""Noir"" is the fascinating tale of two star-crossed female assassins linked by a tragic past and struggling to make sense of that history along with present-day surroundings.  What gives ""Noir"" its pungency is the core of feeling that develops between the two nihilists, who slowly discover that they are but pawns in a game controlled by a ruthless syndicate.  It is their shared sense of mistrust and loneliness that draws them together. ""Noir"" (a code-name for their professional partnership) is essentially a female-driven action drama, with the male characters largely relegated to the sidelines.

The only glaring lapses occur when a third female character attempts to--and nearly succeeds--in breaking their bond. Indeed, once the central mystery is revealed over the course of volumes 5-7, ""Noir"" loses some of its power and impact (i.e., the chases are far more interesting than the actual conquest).  Nevertheless, the series is helped along by crisp, vivid imagery, an assortment of memorable, even heartfelt, characters and, perhaps best of all, an imaginative soundtrack that is by turns pulsating, gorgeous and richly introspective (the music careens from Japanese-influenced pop to jazz piano to African-influenced percussion arrangements).  In fact, the music drives the suspense and deepens the story's multiple meanings.  I stumbled upon ""Noir"" while channel surfing and was immediately captivated.  ""Noir"" was my introduction to Anime and I don't think I am alone when I say that it will be very difficult to find a more impressive conception in this genre.",1193011200,2,1610,5.416
2268978,5,B00096S3MW,"Noir is one of the best animes every created with no exception.

Noir is an action/drama tale that is symbolic of our world with the themes of: ruling over others, personal identity, self-realization, etc. Its realist art style is perfectly done.

I do know Noir can become dry especially from episodes 10-18, which is when the story takes off, but the gun-slinging action is the so-called 'comic relief' after all the static dialog.

The characters are human-like, they all go through personal growth.

Yuki Kajiura does a master job at bringing such spellbinding music into this anime. If you like the songs, there are three cds already out.

Noir has been a good story that has helped me through a harsh period of my life.  I hope the story of Noir lives on in the anime world and that you take a chance to view it.",1190246400,4,818,4.568493150684931

The animation is also excellent and the series is a great (almost perfect) example of taking a premise that seems cliche (girls with guns) and turning it into so much more. Beyond the music and animation, the one other thing that really stands out is the level of character development. There are so many Anime out there where new aspects to a character just get written in. But for the main two characters in Noir (and even some of the supporting cast) the character development is woven in right before our eyes (though it can be very subtle). What is so great about this is the choices the characters make at the end actually feel ""right"". And it's this attention to detail and care that really sets this series apart.",1189728000,5,883,4.490683229813665
2268980,5,B00096S3MW,"Noir is a gripping and distinctive drama of assassins at war with deadly and powerful criminals, neither bloody nor brutal as a typical anime vigilante avenger shoot-em-up nor a rollicking over-the-top adventure of babes, cops, robbers, and car chases. In fact, Noir boasts not a single character with a sense of humor and nary a drop of blood, in spite of a fabulous body count. Like the traditional film noir adventures it most resembles, this series gets by on sheer intensity of emotion.

The pair of assassins who make up the hit-team called Noir are young and female, but otherwise nicely opposite in personalities. Mireille Bouquet, French, blond, beautiful, in her mid-twenties, became a professional hit-woman after she and her uncle escaped from a gang war in her native Corsica. She is a loner, but sophisticated, fashionable and charming at need, with a tight circle of friends and associates in the Paris underworld. A dead shot and icy cool under fire, Mireille considers herself at the top of her profession until she encounters her soon-to-be partner, Kirika Namura.

Kirika is an enigma even to herself. Her memories go back only a year, when someone established an identity for her at a Japanese high school and left her on her own, normal in appearance but so cold and alien inside she terrifies even herself. Self-conscious and self-enclosed to an extraordinary degree, Kirika seems in constant pain. She owns an ornate European watch that plays a haunting melody, one she associates with the name Mireille Bouquet. She also knows that, at need, she can kill any human being she chooses with any weapon.

When Kirika and Mireille arrange a meeting in Japan, a squad of hit men ambushes them. The two women annihilate their attackers with graceful, ruthless efficiency. Their common enemy, the Soldats, are immensely powerful, somehow connected to both women, and will likely come after them again. Mireille sees Kirika as a key to the secrets of her past and the deaths of her murdered family, as well as a threat to the well-kept secrets of her career as an assassin for hire. She agrees to take the younger woman in. Kirika, desperate for any chance to learn about her past and for any tenuous connection to a living human being, quietly agrees even when Mireille says she will have to kill her as soon as she learns what she needs to know. Thus, the elite and mysterious team of assassins known as Noir is born.

Noir tells its tale in a way so stylized and laconic you can sometimes scarcely believe you are buying into its story. The character's dialog and expressions often have to studied together to be understood. Every bit of furniture and scenery is a symbol. Yuki Kajiura's beautiful semi-classical soundtrack, much of it inspired by Catholic liturgical music, sets off each scene like the score of a ballet.

Mireille is a professional killer-for-hire who, in the course of the 26 episode series, only manages to take out contracts on bad guys, never the innocent. This framing conceit worked perfectly well in many John Wayne and Clint Eastwood movies and makes no less sense in this story. We are witnessing what Mireille will become, not what she was. Kirika as a haunted amnesic super-warrior is in territory worked by Robert Ludlum's Jason Bourne novels and many other fictional characters dating back to Oedipus. Her waif appearance and stark, tightly wound personality are wonderfully conveyed by the minimalist animation style. When the camera is on Kirika, you find yourself watching the narrowing of her eyes, the tight curling of her mouth or tilting of her head that signals a crack in her armor, a slight hint of surprise, pain, or tears.

Kirika's pain and Mireille's shifting reaction to that pain are the emotional heart of the series. They engage a number of despicable and dangerous criminals in the opening episodes, including Chinese triads, East German drug lords, American corporate mercenaries, and corrupt French judges, settling scores for some clients and just earning fees for others. However, the threat of the Soldats re-surfaces again and again. Why is this all-powerful organization trying to both kill them and recruit them to its cause? Is the reclusive and beautiful Lady Altena an angel or murderous religious zealot? Chloe, a vivid, smiling, cold-blooded teen-age knife-fighter who intervenes in several of Noir's battles, is cryptic about everything but her passionate schoolgirl crush on Kirika and equally passionate devotion to her patron, Lady Altena. Mireille and Kirika know, however, she could easily kill the both of them if the urge took her.

Dozens of thugs, revolutionaries, crooked cops, and fanatical cultists are gunned down as Mireille and Kirika fight to avoid the secret fate of Noir. If murder is a sin, as the Soldats insist, the assassin is damned by knowing that this is so and by bearing the burden and memory of all her crimes. Kirika must overcome the darkness crushing her soul and Mireille, despite her bloody past, may be only one living who can help Kirika. That is the paradox underlying the ancient fate of Noir. Their struggle to defeat that terrible destiny makes for a intense and entertaining story.",1189036800,5,5204,4.974712643678161
2268981,5,B00096S3MW,"I told a specialist in a videoclub, that carries only anime and japanese movies, that I was looking for a good serie with girls and guns. He looked at me and seeing my Stereolab t-shirt he said: ""If you like Stereolab that must mean that your a music lover, am I right ?"" He was right, i'm a jazz musician. So, he told me that I should try Noir, because it as a well crafted story and most of all, the music in this serie is very very good. But, he said if your looking for a serie with only action, you might have a deception because there's lots of drama too. Perfect, I love drama, music, well crafted story and characters.

Yes, the music was very good and the characters where interesting but, I didn't quite understand the basic plot of the story and where it was going.

It starts slow, you are not sure where the story goes, what are the relations between the main characters and so on...

2268983,5,B00096S3MW,"Watching Noir is an amazing experience. It's a great mixture of character, mystery, action, music and art direction. The anime has so much going for it:

Great characters:

Kirika--the amnesiac Japanese high school girl who knows nothing about herself except that she's an exceptionally-skilled killer who feels no remorse. She's searching for the answers to who she is and desperately hoping there's more to her than cold killing.

Mireille--a young but accomplished professional assassin living in Paris. She's the hard-edged strategist who prefers to work alone and only begrudgingly accepts Kirika as an assassin partner in hopes that unlocking the keys to Kirika's past will help them find the people who executed Mireille's family when she was a child. Mireille is angry, stubborn and bent on vengeance.

Chloe--A strange third young assassin who shows up half-way through the series claiming to be the ""True Noir."" She knows more than she's telling, pops up unexpectedly and is happy to drive a wedge between Kirika and Mireille.

Altena--The woman pulling strings behind the scenes. Is she good? Evil?

Like in the film noir genre, which this series obviously draws from, the lines between good and evil are blurry, the connections between people are mysterious and mistrustful, there's much more at work than meets the eye, and our heroes (or heroines, in this case), are trying to make their way through a dangerous underworld with little more than skill, instinct, guts and guns.

Beautiful designs:

Lush, colorful and well-rendered backgrounds. The European and Asian locations are almost impactful enough to be considered another ""character.""

The soundtrack is A+:

From the beautiful, haunting church choir sounds of ""Canta Per Me"" to the driving ""fight song"" ""Salva Nos"" to the incidental music...all of it is fully conceived. Not a shred of music is ""filler."" The music becomes so integral to the series that it takes on almost symbolic proportions.

No ""filler"" episodes:

There is a deliberate story arc at work here. In early episodes, Mireille and Kirika go into business as a team of assassins-for-hire...only to come to slowly realize that they're being played by a mysterious organization whose roots continue to extend deeper and deeper into their current lives and their pasts. Somewhere along the line they cease being assassins-for-hire and become prey. And then to find that they've been sucked into a much grander and darker scheme.

Space:

This is a show without a lot of dialogue, where every word, gesture and expression counts. The subtleties speak volumes about the characters and leave the viewer with plenty to chew on.

Excellent English dub:

Usually I watch anime in Japanese with subtitles because the English voice cast doesn't match the intensity of the original version, but this is one anime where the English cast is every bit as good as the Japanese. In fact, the English voice actress for Chloe adds a layer of sly humor to her line readings that isn't in the original Japanese. And the English voice actress for Mireille is great.

A high body count but minimal gore:

These girls are the best of the best, and they pile up the dead bodies like nobody's business.  There are some very memorable fight scenes in this series, and each character's fighting style is distinctive. But if you're looking for lots of blood and gore, look elsewhere. The scenes are stylishly staged and full of fun little surprises.",1181260800,16,3458,5.07773851590106

The first couple of episodes are much more action oriented, and it is a series about assassins, so there is violence, but do not expect excessive gore and blood in every episode.

After a few episodes, the plot begins with many episodes focusing almost entirely on the backgrounds of our two lead female characters.  Then there are pauses in the story for the series' highly stylized action scenes.

This is not the best anime I have ever seen because of some pacing and clarity issues, but after renting it a year or more ago, I finally bought it last month, and it is still very entertaining and worth having purchased.",1178928000,,739,4.841269841269841

2268997,5,B00096S3MW,"Noir is about two female assassins. One is a voluptuous blond searching for those who are responsible for killing her parents. The other it a normal looking brunette who possess perfect killing abilities but absolutely no memories prior to the series and is looking for her past. It fallows them along their various jobs slowly revealing the details of their sordid pasts.

Noir is honestly one of the best series I've come across. It is dark, gritty and philosophical. Starting from the first minutes the show exudes mystery and suspense. The plot moves along at good speed, not to fast not to slow though sometimes you will wish it to go faster simply because of the suspense factor. The art work is rather date but is fluid and clean. The voice acting is perfect in both Japanese and English tracks, though Kirka's voice is sometimes hard to hear and understand. The plot itself is interesting with so many twists and turns that by the time you reach the last episode you'll wonder mildly how you got there. The Music is top notch, I especially liked the opening theme, and fits perfectly. The character development is wonderful even for the bit characters. One thing I perticularly like about the series is that sometimes it goes out of the way to show that these are actually people that are getting killed. The character development is top notch slowly revealing details about the two main characters and the latter third main character. The only two flaws I can nit pick at. Is one that though its pretty clear the two surviving main characters love each other they really don't go into detail, are they lesbians or just close comrades? Never really made clear. Second is the near total lack of blood, with the exception of a few scenes there is none in the entire series. This isn't so much a problem except it make it rather difficult to tell when someone's dead, mean you hear the bang and someone falls over presumably dead. This gets annoying at points but not a major problem.",1164931200,6,1989,4.682857142857143
2268998,5,B00096S3MW,"I am relativly new to Anime and already a bit tired of robots.. Noir was great for refreshing the senses.

A true mystery drama story.. It could easily have used real actors and still been possible to create, would just need 1000 or so extras for shooting at, seems men in black suits are plentiful for quick dispatch by these two intrepid ladies.

Anyway, yes lots of guys get shot, just a few ladies die, and they are predictable you could say, as the story travels along.

Not a fan service Anime, lots of short skirts etc, no undies in sight!.. bit of a change. There is a nude scene with Kirika and Chloe, this is not explicit.

The story is covered in many reviews here, so best to say the music is very good, several friends visiting at different times actually commented on the music, and it does work very well throughout the story. The music director and composer get 5/5 in my book.

There is a lot of repitition of some scenes of Mireille's parents, these scenes however, are in the long run, intergral to expanding the story, as we are gradually shown more and more of this particular murder. In the end all becomes clear, and by then the story is moving pretty well also.

Some say the ending is ambiguous, well in effect, finding true friendship is the ending, and it is also left open ended, i.e. will the girls  return to their trade or not?

The story is left open, I feel, on purpose and there is now scope for additional stories, with or without the Soldats.

I watched it once and was a little hesitant about this story, I gave it a week and watched again, this time I had the Subtitles on and I could then understand what Kirika was saying, her voice part is quite low, and not clear at times, Subtitles filled in some gaps and I must say the story was much better and easier to follow overall. So if you have issues with this story, do try it again, it does come together much better the second time.

I rate this as my favorite anime so far, Chobits coming a close second, I have now watched about 15 Anime stories.

I don't regret buying it and I will watch it again, I guess that in itself is a good recomendation..

PS.. lots of people get shot etc, Some of these are very calus and premeditated killings. That is very cold blooded (NO blood though) and lots of fights, probably not for kids, else it needs adult supervision. If you let your kids watch James Bond movies, then this is probably acceptable also.",1152144000,7,2437,4.355408388520972
2268999,5,B00096S3MW,"Noir is truly a great and ""out of the ordinary"" type of anime worth watching.  It is interesting to mention that the story has a sexy touch and at times slight lesbian moments (oh yeah!!).

 The story starts with a young beautiful assassin for hire called Mireille Bouquet, who's mysteriously contacted by another beautiful and even younger girl called Kirika Yumura, who's skills as assassin surpasses by far those of Mireille.  Kirika needs Mireille's help to uncover her past because she is amnesic, as they try to work together; a mysterious organization is trying to kill them both.  Little they both Kirika and Merielle know that their dark past have a lot in common and that the organization trying to kill them (the Soldats) is also part of their past.

 As they try to survive and try to uncover the mystery of the Soldats, both girls start to see how entwined their past is and how their survival and future depends on uncovering the truth.  Its beauty relies on the fact that at times is rather slow paced (some hard core anime fans can not stand that).  Nothing wrong with the slow pace, this adds to the complexity of the 11+ hours, 7-volume story that develops and builds to a great climax and outcome.  The slow parts happen when they are off work, sometimes the seem to be contemplating the beautiful views of the French countryside, visiting cafes and fashion shops, or at times they stare at each other in a conspicuous manner for no other reason that to know what are they thinking.

The story also has its fast paced times with lots of action, as the girls do their assassinations in a cold and calculated manner.

 The music is superb; it is very rare to see an anime with such good music.  Not only the music is great, but it also fits the slow and the fast story parts to such extent that it brings the overall anime experience to unexpected heights.  This 7 DVD volume collection (as well as the 2CD soundtrack) is a keeper and I highly recommend it!!",1141862400,16,1975,4.555240793201133
2269000,3,B00096S3MW,"This is something of a strange anime. On the one hand it is a constant cold blooded murder theme and for that reason alone should not be allowed in the hands of young children or teenagers. There are more people killed per minute than in many video games.

Buried deeply in there somewhere was a philosophical question - Can evil beget good? That's hardly a question to pose to the ordinary anime crowd. What's more it smacks of a phoney plant to give the anime some ""production value"" while being marketable to impressionable young people.

The quality of the production is first rate. The animation is pretty good. But I'm growing weary of ""beautiful girl heros"" and this is likely to burn out anime if anything does.",1140912000,3,719,4.653543307086614
2269001,5,B00096S3MW,"This anime is an action driven one with little charactar progression and a weak yet intriging plot. However it is in fact a great show. The music is WONDERFUL i can not stress how great it is the women who composed the tracks is brilliant and it seems that

the anime was made to complement the music and not vice versa. The anime is very depressing and I even cried in I believe the third episode. It is one of my favorite animes but im not sure what attracts me to it. The biggest disapointment in the show is the ending. When the objective of the main evil organization became clear i realized it made no sense. I won't spoil it but it mainly made several references to sin and hatred and thats about it. Some of the murder scenes where awesome like in the first and fourth episode. Again the music is great. Noir is however very... original yes thats a good word original.",1139270400,,876,4.3090909090909095

The music is something youll notice thruought the show, and everything is in sync with one another( The footsteps sometimes seem to be going with the beat of the Music)

To those people who says ""adv flims does horrible"" you're wrong!

ADV is one of the best companies out there if you want an anime in english dub.  They also do the best job with voice overs/dubs.

Every ADV anime dvd I have contains completely different voices most of the time coming from about the same people; saying the voice actors have good skills.

The characters were both matched correctly there voices so mysterious that you probably could never forget. When an action seen came on this anime does get the coolest, in my vote, for the song. The anime was also drawn beautifully even the battle seens were not corny and left you wondering and kind of wishing that you could be that cool. It was an intense anime which I do recommend though it could be bit graphic.",1120176000,10,611,4.321739130434783

8057825,3,B00096S3MW,"Otaku John, the super-fan of anime / manga / and light novels, here to review another anime in the ""Girls With Guns"" genre:  Noir.  Let's talk about the positives first.  There's a lot of episodes, you get your money's worth that way.  But as far as everything else, it's lacking.  Animation is crude at best.  Sound is ""wonky"".  The music is loud, and the character's voices are recorded low, especially the mumbling amnesiac Yuumura Kirika.  You can barely even hear her.  As far as storyline goes, (although this was the first of the Girls with Guns trilogy), it still seems dated and clich&eacute;, with the whole ""I'm a deadly assassin with amnesia"" thing.  What really hurts the story is the lack of character development, poor voice acting and animation that looks like it was done 40 years ago.  Sure there's action, and a lot of shoot-outs, but without a good story, interesting characters, and good acting, pretty soon all that action gets boring like a robo-cop sequel, and random shootings with bodies falling over like bowling pins becomes mundane.  This is one of those series I really tried to give a chance, time and time again, but I still keep coming up disappointed.  If ""Girls With Guns"" is your thing, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND instead ""Canaan"" anime series.  [ASIN:B003XJDT0I Canaan Complete Collection [Blu-ray] Much better characters, great animation, and good voice acting.  Also, I can't recommend ""BLACK LAGOON"" enough.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Lagoon-Season-1-2-Blu-ray-DVD/dp/B008YRL7JE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Lagoon: Season 1 & 2 (Blu-ray + DVD)</a>&nbsp;(I know Black Lagoon is not traditional girls with guns), but still, the characters are great, storylines excellent, and Revy with her twin Berettas and Roberta with her shotgun are women enough to fill in the ""girls with guns"" with room to spare.  Also, ""Phantom: Requiem of the Phantom"" is a similar-themed action anime about assassins, (with amnesia yet!) that delivers the goods much better than Noir.",1503878400,,2049,5.457142857142857
8057826,3,B00096S3MW,"In terms of quality, this is an excellent remastering of Noir in 1080p using the original source material and not a shoddy upscale. However, as is the case with a lot of anime blu-ray releases these days, you cannot remove the subtitles if you are listening to the Japanese language track. This is a restriction created by the distributor and not an issue with my blu-ray player as I was easily able to remove the subtitles earlier when I was watching my blu-ray set of Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory.

The reason for this issue is because unlike DVDs, blu-rays are in the same region for North America and Japan. Thus, it's very tempting to Japanese fans to reverse import because their only other option is to pay literally ten times as much as we do here in North America for their own release. This is a stupid way of discouraging people from doing this though as anyone who's even the least bit computer-savy can rip the video from the discs and remove the subtitles that way. Obviously the number of non-Japanese individuals who would want to watch this in Japanese without subs is probably small, but a major annoyance nonetheless.",1496361600,3,1136,4.68
8057827,5,B00096S3MW,"I'd like to start out by saying it's not an anime for everyone and requires patience to fully enjoy. That being said, if you have the patience to sit through it, the payoff is definitely worth it if you take the time to let it soak in. Unlike a lot of other anime, where an easy enjoyment comes from the action or comedy, the most enjoyable aspect of this series is its ability to convey its beauty subtly through the senses. Director Kichi Mashimo does this masterfully by focusing on gorgeous scenery, a moving score, and character interaction. The story unfolds steadily, giving the viewer time to be invested in the characters. There is a lot of attention to background scenery (probably why the director chose France and Corsica primarily as the anime's setting.) Furthering the importance of it, the series focuses on it in one of the episodes when Kirika begins to paint it (one of my favorite episodes). This is honestly one of the most serious-in-tone anime I've ever watched. There's not a lot of humor or fan service. It was very clear the director didn't want the viewer to be distracted by such events. If I have a complaint about this series, it's that there's almost no blood/wounds at all, the only exceptions being a couple of cuts and scenes focusing on a certain murder. With all of the shooting and stabbing going on, sometimes you are left a little puzzled as to how someone died because no visible wounds are seen.",1486512000,,1436,4.635294117647059
8057828,4,B00096S3MW,"Swiftly, silently, single-mindedly, you pursue your target. He has a faint idea of why someone wants to kill him (it was most likely stealing that bag of cash from the Mafia) but he doesnt know who that someone is, or if anyones chasing him at all. All he knows is that he feels as if his life is in danger and so he runs in fear. Shrouded in the obscure, somber shadows, you steadily trail behind him and hear him breathing heavily. He senses someone behind him and shakily steers his body around. No ones there. You concealed yourself behind a Range Rover and carefully monitor him from there. He worriedly gazes into the darkness and, seeing nothing, faces forward to resume walking. You stealthily descend from your position and continue following the target from afar. You can see that the target is at ease. He walks with carefree looseness, his head bobbing to and fro as he whistles. He reaches a hole-ridden sidewalk with a flickering streetlamp overhead and this is where you make your move. With a thunderous stomp from your sneaker, you finally reveal yourself as you clutch one of his shoulders. Frightened, he whirls around and his fear heightens when you make eye contact with him. With an astonishing amount of speed, you pin the target against the side of a Wal-Mart and extract a Beretta from your pocket. You release a brief sigh before pulling the trigger. The target drops to the ground and, as you walk away from the crime scene, you think to yourself, Imma charge a bit more for this hit.

You of course are an assassin.

When people hear that word, something similar to that paragraph appears in their head. If asked what being an assassin is, theyll either tell you its as exciting as being an undercover spy (thats something Ill discuss in another review) or claim its like any other occupation, except that this involves murdering people. Whats common in TV shows and films is that an assassin meets with someone shady, demands a ridiculous price for their services, fulfills the objective, gets paid, and exits stage left, never to be seen again. There is no concern for their life. There is no internal conflict about how morally wrong this is. There is no inquiry about why this specific person has to die. All I ask is if you're making something involving an assassin please have the assassin consist of more than just I kill for money. This is one of the reasons why Im so in love with director Kouichi Mashimos Noir.

There is a difference between intense and edgy. There is a difference between taking your story seriously and wanting others to regard it as serious. Thankfully, Noir doesnt obsess over how mature and dark it is (*cough* Deadman Wonderland *cough*), preferring to venture beyond what constitutes something to be serious. With Noir, you won't come across buckets of blood or a hefty supply of, ahem, suggestive scenes (well, there are a few but they serve to add layers to the story). What youll find instead is a series with passionate gunfights that rarely result in blood (The few instances it does are purposefully jarring).

In Noirs early stages, the plot mostly leans towards the episodic (it contains a few two-part events) with the individual stories, consistently well-written and heavy-handed, carrying the show but what has earned Noir a sizable measure of fame is its environment. Centered in the city of Paris but not limited to it, Noirs beautiful backgrounds really help strengthen the relaxing trip in Europe feeling to it. Locations like the local marketplace, the private vineyards, and the majestic hilltops are wondrously brought to life while a late-night walk through Paris presents a mesmerizing, misty tint in the air. It doesnt hurt that Noir has a fascination with the art of cinematography but this shows character designs on the other hand? Yeesh.

To those of you that watched Erased, Madoka Magica, or anything in the Fate/Stay Night franchise, Yuki Kaijura is most likely a familiar name. Well, back in 2001, Kaijura and her musical talents decided to sprinkle some of their magic dust in Noirs soundtrack and the result is nothing short of phenomenal. Inspired by the sounds of multiple countries, the OST features a bagpipe, piano and violin compositions with an Italian vibe, English vocals, and an occasional Chinese presence. In particular, Noir has a strong interest in Latin/Italian melodies, which occurs in the ominous Les Soldats and in the light-hearted Canta per Me, but especially in Salva Nos. Salva Nos is excellent, no, beyond excellent. It is iconic. Salva Nos kicks off with a gloomy jazz intro and then the memorably haunting chorus soars into the song from out of nowhere, alongside a booming electric guitar. This song is the one that Kaijura reserves for Noirs most intense scenes and in the episode previews. When you hear Salva Nos begin playing, you better grab a bag of popcorn because thats when the episode approaches its climax. This shows opening Coppelias Casket isn't as memorable as Salva Nos (I mean, what is?) but still, this energetic track, with the look of an old-school spy film, has never failed to satisfy my theme song fetish.

Noirs opening accentuates two women in silhouette defeating an array of nameless men with grace and style. One of them is Mireille Bouquet. On the surface, shes a laid-back blondie with street smarts and book smarts, the antithesis of the dumb blonde stereotype. The essence of Mireilles being, however, is an ice-cold killer with the raging fury of the mythical spirit Lyssa. From the very beginning, her character development benefitted from a very detailed backstory. However, the one-shot characters that appear throughout Noir aren't as fortunate, hardly leaving much of an impact on the story though there are exceptions, like Lady Silvana Greone (the Mafia queen with ties to Mireille) and Claude Feyder (Mireilles uncle). Basically, the only supporting characters that are important are only so because of their connections to the protagonists, which obviously limits how important they can be. As a result, characters that couldve potentially been stars are reduced to two-bit roles, like Altena. Altenas the head priestess of Les Soldats; shes a depraved lunatic that hides her insanity in a cloak of faux-benevolence. Throughout the series, Altenas cameos are presented with just the right mix of mystique and underlying menace that it seemed as though she would steal the spotlight and find a spot among animes greatest villains or be a developed character at the very least. It was not to be. In the end, Altena is evicted from her chance at center stage, along with the rest of Noirs supporting cast, yet another second-string adversary defeated by Mireille and Kirika Yuumura.

This is a show that can place your mind at ease in one instant and rock your world in the next. It lulls you in with its mellow and slow-paced atmosphere, and then sledgehammers you with some of the most outrageous plot twists youll ever witness. Noir bombards you with pulse-pounding shootout scenes and then impresses you with how incredibly detailed its plot is. I think it is undisputable that there is no character than embodies the defining traits of this show quite like Kirika Yuumura. However, you might take one glance at her, observing her wafer-thin frame, her meek, submissive demeanor, her massive chibi eyes, and think, She doesnt belong in a show like Noir. Behind Kirikas eyes is a beautiful, desolate sadness, betraying a weary sense of experience well beyond her years. Those are eyes that have a life of their own as they project Kirikas thoughts in a manner that her words cannot manage. In the occasion that she does carry a conversation, its a beauty to listen to as Monica Rial uses a soothing gentleness to her voice that perfectly suits Kirikas character (I never, ever thought Id say that of Rial). Simply watching Kirika exist, doing everything with inquisitive wonder as if this show is one big slice- of- life, deceives you into forgetting that shes a world-class assassin. At her job, Kirika kills with stunning efficiency, her accuracy otherworldly, as she ponders, I can kill people so easily. Why then don't I feel sad? Thats the thing about Kirika. She completes her assignment through exploiting her unique creativity, executing targets in a fashion Mireille once dubbed garish, and yet the taking of lives triggers no emotional response in her. None. Thats because Kirika suffers from amnesia, a common condition among girls in anime. Its later revealed that the amnesia prevents her from recalling her past; it protects her from regressing to her former self, her dark self. Once Kirika remembers her past, her character completely morphs. Kirikas eyes, once pure and expansive, narrows and hardens, the tragic beauty of them replaced with utter stoniness. Monica Rial delivers her lines as Dark Kirika with a chilling harshness, the soothing quality appearing in spades. Dark Kirika capitalizes on ruthlessness and savagery to murder those she decides should die. Gone is the innovation. Gone is the wide-eyed innocence. All thats left is a monster. When Kirika destroys the darkness inside of her, when she confesses that killing people saddens her, the character arc is complete. She endured a fair share of heartwrenching mental breakdowns. She entered the very depths of nihilism. She was betrayed and emotionally destroyed by those she cherished. Fortunately, Kirika is able to conquer the obstacles she encountered, growing into a better person, a stronger person, along the way. Theres a multitude of reasons why I enjoyed watching Kirika throughout the series, from her fascination with the Wu Tang Clan (see her apron in episode 2) to how her ridiculous plot armor is used, which I would normally complain about (In one hilarious scene, a no-name henchman spots Kirika directly in front of him, pisses himself, and fires at her over and over and over. Every bullet misses her). I think the biggest reason is because Kirika Yuumura skyrockets far beyond the quiet girl stereotype assigned to her.

With this review, I hope I persuaded one person, just one, to journey with me to 2001, where anime didn't need edginess to attract fans, where shows were more substance than style, where assassins were more than just people pulling triggers. If this is what you desire in what you watch, then Noir is for you.",1477526400,,10399,4.9484831139095595
