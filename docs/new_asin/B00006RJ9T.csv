1790676,5,B00006RJ9T,"Caught this flick on its opening weekend, rather by accident, while on a tourist weekend in Montreal.  My traveling companion, being an indie movie junkie, recommended that we kill part of an afternoon watching it.  Great dining, drinking, Expos/Phillies game aside, this was the highlight of a kick-ass Memorial Day weekend.  Bought three copies of the DVD as Christmas gifts.  Don't miss it!!!",1067299200,5,395,5.222222222222222
1790677,5,B00006RJ9T,"FUBAR is by far the funniest movie I have seen in a long, long time.  The film chronicals the seemingly mundane expoits of Terry Cahill and Dean Murdoch, two idiotic headbangers whose existance apparently is based on shot-gunning Pilsner, swearing, and just given'er.  Documentary film director Farrel Mitchner follows our heros into the depths of a world most of us could never dream of.
I especially loved the scene where they party in High River, where you can't tell who's an actor and who isn't.  The locals certainly fit right in with Terry and Dean.
What is surprising to me is that it has taken this long for an authoritative film on Headbangers to be made.  Chances are you went to high school with guys like this and this movie shows you what they're probably up to post-graduation, if they made it that far.
This movie won't make you stop and think, nor will it make you question your place in the world.  It will however give you one of the best laughs you've had in a long time.  The DVD has some great extra features and I especially enjoyed the director's commentary and deleted scenes.  It's well worth owning as you will want to watch it over and over.
Best line: ""As it stands right now, plan B is just to keep on given'er.""",1042416000,13,1242,4.493333333333333
1790678,5,B00006RJ9T,"i saw this movie in the theater and i knew right after it ended that i couldn't wait for the dvd. well, that day is finally here and, by golly, this has got to be one of the greatest dvds ever printed. The commentary by Dean and Terry (in character) is so funny i had to rewind it a bunch of times cuz my laughter was causing me to miss even funnier stuff.
There are also some great deleted scenes. the ""burned face girl"" is quite funny. Some of the others are weird, but worth a watch.
My only complaint about this DVD is that the sound is only available in 2 channel Pro Logic. I guess it's hardly a complaint though... seeing as the movie has a documentary feel. I guess not a lot of documentaries come with a 5.1 dolby digital EX mix... so yeah, who cares?
Buy this DVD. The movie is fantastic and the special features are equally as fabulous.
The commentary is worth the price alone",1038787200,3,887,4.192982456140351
1790679,4,B00006RJ9T,"You are now in Terry and Dean's world. Follow them as they smash, crash, splash their way through life with the motto that ""You just have to give'er."" It is a documentary, mocumentary or is it real life? You never know. The website doesn't help you decide. Snort beverages through your nose as you laugh your way through this soon to be cult classic. ""Whether the doctor says pain or the forecast says rain....it's Friday night so I'm just gonna giv'er."" Definitely not for the yuppy crowd.",1038009600,3,490,4.64367816091954

1790706,3,B00006RJ9T,"This flick is presented in a documentary style.  This technique failed to work for me. Start with Fubar II instead and skip this one. My son said the opposite. He liked film one better than film two. My brother said skip film one and stick with film two. We all agreed that seeing a pair of Canadian hillbillies stumbling around for sex, drugs, and rock-n-roll confirmed to us feel that stupidity's limits are no longer confined to the United States. They extend beyond our borders into Canada. Why is it that most dopers envision themselves as rock stars? How many are? This pair of flicks should be shown to high schoolers on the disadvantages of smoking marijuana. Want to stunt one's maturity permanently on seventh grade?  Keep on smoking the stuff.",1412035200,,754,4.748091603053435
1790707,5,B00006RJ9T,One of the greatest movies of all time . I think that I've watched it at least a 100 times and it only gets better.,1410048000,,115,3.64

1790709,5,B00006RJ9T,Watch the second one before you watch this one. If you watch the first you probably wouldn't want to watch the second. The second is dope. EH,1405468800,,141,4.2592592592592595
1790728,5,B00006RJ9T,"The second one is actually much better (and you don't need to watch the first one before), although I do like this one a lot too. It has some really hilarious moments, but there's some lulls too so that's why I'd say the second one is better. But this one is definitely worth a watch.",1390608000,,284,4.181818181818182
1790729,1,B00006RJ9T,"The disc doesn't work in multiple DVD players I tried. When I finally got it to work, the disc skipped and ultimately stopped working later in the movie. I may or may not send it back.. The movie is fantastically hilarious, but I want to watch the whole thing not just pieces.",1389052800,,276,4.326923076923077

This story of a family-jewels-cancer-affected young singer was accidentally turned sour as a band's twenty five year old agent had drawn drunken.

1790744,5,B00006RJ9T,"I feel as though every Canadian University student should go through atleast one serious FUBAR stage, wherein they must:

1. duct tape all injuries

2. ""shotgun""

3. collect imported beers (such as Heineken and Corona)

4. nickname a friend ""TRON"", and

5. regularly yell: ""turn down the suck"" and/or ""______ funkin' blows""

It's a rite of passage. My phase lasted 3 months.

Seriously though, this movie is hilarious. If you haven't seen it, you should - especially if you're Canadian. I haven't seen a more quotable movie since the Big Lebowski!",1114041600,10,547,4.945054945054945
1790745,4,B00006RJ9T,"While the production value of the film is limited, the story (for anyone who's spent their childhood in Canada or the Midwest for that matter) is compelling. This is, in fact, a mockumentary but it keeps a fairly good tongue-in-cheek tone throughout.

The performances by the main leads (Spence and Lawrence) are solid, and the filmmaker does a great job of being unlikeable until his (spoiler) demise.

The most cherished scenes are certainly the description of the van (and its female ""protector"") and the late night partying around the campfire.

However, the best performance is by the doctor, who, as it turns out, really is the director's doctor.

Sounds and clips can be found at the director's website: [...] He's coming out with a new film that should follow gracefully in FUBAR'S footsteps: IT'S ALL GONE PETE TONG and stars the main FUBAR guys (and the Doctor!).

All in all, a good romp.",1109548800,9,899,4.849673202614379
1790746,5,B00006RJ9T,"I don't see how this couldn't be funny to anyone in the English speaking world. Spinal Tap has been called the best Mocumentry around, but in the opinion of someone born in the mid 1980's FUBAR is by far the funnier film. Don't even attempt to watch it with abunch of people who won't stop talking, as you would miss many of the great lines hidden in the movie.",1105833600,7,361,4.246376811594203
