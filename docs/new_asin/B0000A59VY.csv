1902932,5,B0000A59VY,"Is still my favorite!  I love the stretchie, I love the walkers, I love the music, I love Leslie! I never tire of the Express set.  All of Leslie's DVD's are great, but this one is something special.  Just get it, and just do it!",1104969600,24,229,4.044444444444444
1902933,4,B0000A59VY,The video is great for people that is starting out...but the downfall about this video is that once you do it over and over ..your body adjust and it becomes too easy and you will have a stand still in my opinion and you must move on too bigger and better things...but it is good for beginners...,1075507200,10,296,4.2105263157894735
1902934,5,B0000A59VY,"Walk Away the Pounds Express is Leslie's best.  It is so motivating.  The music, the walkers,the program for 1 mile, 2 miles and 3 miles are just great.  Leslie keeps you motivated as you walk with her and all her walkers.  I have many of Leslie's videos and I love them all but Express is my favorite.",1061596800,13,302,4.245614035087719
1902944,3,B0000A59VY,Excellent product for the price. The DVD provides an adequate workout and it comes with the stretchie. One thing I didn't like was the inability to pause the DVD as it stated this action is not allowed.,1324771200,,202,4.486486486486487
1902945,5,B0000A59VY,"I was afraid Leslie's popularity was just a hype but my fears were allayed after trying the whole walk workout once.
I did both the 1 mile Easy walk & the 2 mile brisk walk & I found it pretty easy & fun. The next day, I tried the 3 mile fat burning walk & found it a nice elevation from the 1 & 2 mile walks.
This being my first Leslie Sansone dvd, I didn't get the 4/5 mile walk workouts but now I wish I had, & I will!
Being a gung-ho type ""exerciser"", & mostly rollerblading or playing tennis for sports, I've been doing only Tae-bo home fitness videos, so this was a nice change of pace, yet provided enough of a workout to help me break up a sweat.
I use a polar hrm watch (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Polar-Heart-Rate-Monitor-FT60F-Purple-1-ea/dp/B0025VPMAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Polar Heart Rate Monitor FT60F, Purple 1 ea</a>&nbsp;along with my workouts & find that WATP does let one pick up speed gradually before sinking nicely into the optimal fat-burning zone, without putting much stress on your joints.
Something else I like is how Leslie keeps reminding you that you shouldn't let just one tough part of the workout keep you from completing the workout. It's so true!! So far so good; she's made a good impression on me!
If you need a softer, but still solid approach, Leslie Sansone is a good choice.
I love her workout on days I need a break from tougher alternatives.
I tend to dislike too much chatter especially when working out but I don't find her irritating at all. I think the friendly banter instead provides a nice distraction, especially when you are on the third mile & just need to push through to the end.
A manageable yet effective workout!",1288396800,2,1719,4.752508361204013
1902946,5,B0000A59VY,"This is a great workout for beginners or pros.  When time is tight, you can take 15 minutes out of the day or night and feel good that you got your walk in.",1255910400,,156,3.727272727272727
1902947,5,B0000A59VY,Allows you to safely progress workout that started mild.  Great cardio workout that incorporates spot exercises.,1245888000,,112,6.0
1902948,5,B0000A59VY,"Really like this a lot, intend to make good use of it.  Would say it's a good way to exercise without doing anything too drastic.",1243987200,,129,4.16
1902949,5,B0000A59VY,THIS IS A GREAT TAPE TO WALK OFF THE POUNDS BY YOU CAN START SLOW AND BUILD UP TO 3 MILES SHE IS A GREAT PERSON.,1240704000,,112,3.3461538461538463
1902950,4,B0000A59VY,"You'll outgrow the 1-mile pretty quickly, but this is still a great set.  Not that the 1-mile isn't worth anything - in fact, I also purchased the 1,2 & 3 for abs and frequently warm up with the Express 1 mile and finish with the 1 mile abs version.  I like the stretchy - helps you to customize the intensity a bit!  Nice addition to my fitness routine!",1235001600,,354,4.176470588235294
1902951,5,B0000A59VY,"No one does it quite like Leslie Sansone! I love these DVDs.  I usually walk out in the desert daily, about 3 miles or more.  But there are days when it's too hot or too wet or just too something and now I have these!  These are not difficult and I feel great after 3 or 4 miles of indoor walking.
The milage is pretty good too, at least to my pedometer!
I think these would be great for beginners all the way to advanced walkers.  You can make it as difficult or as easy as you need.  :)
I have recommended these to many folks already, great product!",1210291200,2,551,4.018348623853211
1902952,4,B0000A59VY,My 14 year old Autistic son loves working out with this system.  Keeping him active was a problem but no more!  Thank you!,1197849600,,122,4.260869565217392
1902953,4,B0000A59VY,"I HAVE HAD LESLIE SANSONE TAPES BEFORE AND FOUND THEM USEFUL WHEN I CANNOT GET TO A GYM OR WALK OUTSIDE. THO I DO BELIEVE THAT YOU GET A MORE COMPLETE WALK WITH HER WALK AWAY THE LBS.DOING IT EVERY DAY GETS A LITTLE BORING,BUT MY BODY SAYS KEEP GOING!!",1186531200,,252,4.06
1902954,5,B0000A59VY,This is one of the best in home workouts I've tried.  Who woul have thought that a simple walk would work your body so well?  I love the strechie band.  It works great for muscle tone without the stress of weights.  I love all three workouts!,1184889600,2,242,4.195652173913044
1902955,5,B0000A59VY,If you want a workout that doesn't get boring this is the one!  I love the positive attitude that Leslie brings to the workout.  It lets you know that she is a real person.  A lot of the other ladies in the workouts are people that have lost weight because of her tapes.  It is a lot of fun! It works for me.  And I always say if I can do it so can you.,1184544000,2,353,3.6533333333333333
1902956,5,B0000A59VY,"I started with the one mile easy walk.  It took me about two weeks to graduate to the 2 mile brisk walk.  I really like her DVDs and will continue doing them.  I hope to eventually get to the 3 mile advanced walk.  Until then, I know it's working and I don't even mind doing the walking. Highly recomend Leslie Sansone to anyone who needs to start exercising.",1179619200,2,359,4.235294117647059
1902957,4,B0000A59VY,"if you haven't exercised , this is the walk for you ..the 1 mile is a push for starters , once you get going .. you fly right thru it .. the 2 and 3 mile are a great push ... good price too!!!",1178496000,,192,3.3863636363636362
1902958,4,B0000A59VY,"Like many of the other reviewers, I really enjoy this set.  Easy to do, with maximum benefit given to the walker - you choose the intensity by lifting higher, etc.

Leslie is annoying at times... her laugh is really fake - but she IS trying to exercise while making light banter.  Can't fault her for a goofy laugh!  My dad and I have been doing the 1-miler in the morning and he mocks it every time!

I don't care for the initial Walk-Power Walk repeat ditty, but it's not a deal breaker.  My biggest complaint is the tall blond - she REALLY gets into it and has really exaggerated moves... very distracting!

I recommend this!",1166227200,6,628,4.408695652173913
1902959,5,B0000A59VY,"I bought this set of DVDs after enjoying some of Leslie Sansone's other workouts, and I wasn't disappointed.  There are 1, 2, and 3 mile workouts, all of which incorporate the (included) Stretchie resistance band.  The walks involve several simple moves - marching in place, knee lifts, side steps, kicks, and kickbacks - and light strength training during the second half.  The pace of the walking starts fairly slowly but becomes brisk in the middle segment.

I found the workouts fairly easy to pick up, although the Stretchie did give me a little trouble at first - mainly figuring out how to hold and pull it without making my wrists hurt!

Leslie walks with several other walkers, from ages 27 to 72, and there is some (slightly smarmy) dialogue between them.  The music is fairly standard workout music, nothing to write home about!  I find the Express walks an enjoyable way to get in a quick, complete workout at home.",1137024000,25,927,4.75625
1902960,5,B0000A59VY,"This is my first Leslie Sansone set, but it certainly won't be my last! This exercise series features walking in place, accented with different steps- a side step, a kick, knee lifts, etc.
This particular set comes with a Stretchie, a long band of rubber [?] that you use while walking to work out your arms as well as your legs.
Leslie is very motivational, and she talks to you through the whole program, which is something I enjoy but some other people may not. She has a group of backing walkers who walk in the background behind her, and they range vastly in age- there is a 70-plus year old man walking, a few women in their 60s and 50s as well as one in her 20s.
The exercises are fantastic- simple enough that anyone can do them, very low-impact and easy on the joints, and they require very little space.
The only complaint I have about this set is the background music- it seems kind of ""off"" to me and it gets boring after a while [it's not really music, just a keyboard beat and some guy saying ""walk, power walk"" over and over again]. That's a small concession for this fabulous exercise program, though.
Thanks Leslie!",1133481600,15,1132,4.421052631578948
1902961,5,B0000A59VY,"The videos are typical Leslie - very well done and easy to follow, even first thing in the morning.  The stretchie is a tricky thing, though - I have experienced mild soreness in my wrists after using it ... so be careful, but enjoy!",1127001600,15,233,4.295454545454546
1902962,5,B0000A59VY,"I've tried the gym, jane fonda, taebo, walking, running, biking, swimming, but this is the absolute best!  I don't think you can go wrong here!",1126569600,10,143,4.72
1902963,4,B0000A59VY,"I Like this workout, the music is very brisk, it made me break a good sweat during the whole thing. The warm-up section has very cheesy music, there is a guy singing over and over again ""Walk, Power Walk, Walk, Power Walk...Knees work, Legs Work, Calves Work, Brain Work"", etc. Come on I think when people buy her workouts they know that it's power walking they don't need to be reminded over and over again what they are doing! It is very lame but think goodness it's only during the warm-up otherwise I would not be able to stand it. Then during the last .5 mile they use the strechie band and march in place, this is very good for the arms. I also have her Walk and Kick and Walk and Jog videos this 2 Mile Brisk Walk is close to the same intensity as those other two videos. I think it's more intense than the Walk and Kick though. She does her 4 basic moves throughout the workout but the music is fast and makes you move quickly. I will be putting this video in my rotation, overall I give this video two thumbs up!!!",1125100800,9,1023,4.197969543147208

7995958,5,B0000A59VY,"I chose the Leslie Sansone - Walk Away the Pounds because it looked easy for a beginner as well for someone that was uncoordinated. I like a simple exercise regime that doesn't require me to learn complex dance moves to get fit and this doesn't have that. This allowed me to get in shape at home without a gym membership I couldn't afford. Over four months I lost 40 lbs using the 2 mile walk dvd every day and changing my diet.

There are four basic moves: walking in place, side to side, leg lift and forward and backward. The  latex stretchie band helps tone your upper arms as well. I was able to control the resistance by how far apart the band is stretched. A plus that I don't need to have bulky weights taking up space in my apartment. You may not see a significant difference in muscle tone like with weights but it's still effective. There are additional strengths of the stretchie bands available to buy at Amazon, if you're not challenged by the one included in the package. This walking program is also easy on the knees and it was fun. I looked forward to my routine and I dislike exercise.",1389225600,,1104,4.380487804878049
7995959,5,B0000A59VY,I love all of Leslie Sansone dvds.  The stretchy band offers a great alternative to her normal weight workouts.  I alternate the workouts now.,1387497600,,142,4.875
7995960,5,B0000A59VY,"I found this to be a great investment, especially that you can use
it at home at any time, whatever fits your schedule.  Another benefit
I found was on a cold or rainy day you can still get your daily exercise
in.  It is an easy to follow program and you start at a one mile walk, increase
to two miles, and then to three miles.  I lost 20 pounds in two months and am
maintaining my weight by combining outside and indoor walking.
I highly recommend this.",1379462400,,455,4.1477272727272725

7995962,3,B0000A59VY,"Leslie is clearly committed to helping us non-athletes get in some activity, and seems to be a very sweet person.  Here are my objections to her DVDs:
(1)  She does not shut up!  Please!  Re-do these after watching your more athletic colleagues.  Count-downs, good; giggly, mindless chatter, bad.  And she talks down to the viewer as if we kindergarteners - ""pull in your tummy,"" ""talk to your body parts,"" etc.

(2)  She should stop promulgating misinformation; there is NO ""high-calorie burn"" in any of her DVDs; mild exercise, yes; light sweat, yes, ""high-calorie burn"" - NO WAY.  And telling viewers that her froofy ""fingertips to opposite knees activates the obliques"" is just plain incorrect - watch her, and you'll see what I mean.

(3)  She should re-study proper stretching; what Leslie provides is essentially worthless for real stretching, at least to anyone who has ever done 1 yoga class, taken 1 page from Bob Anderson's ""Stretching,"" watched any one of her competitor's DVDs, or ever taken an aerobics class from any competent instructor.

(4)  Practice ""truth in advertising;"" give 30 minutes of an actual aerobic walk, not 5 minutes warm-up, 5 minutes of ""stretching,"" with 20 minutes of walking; go ahead - make the DVD 40 minutes - people will love it.

(5)  She has no script or planned routine; my wife has 4 of these things, and in every one, it's obvious she's just ""making it up as she goes along.""  A clear script, thoughtfully designed to equally target separate body areas would be welcomed.

I really wish a more athletically-oriented instructor or trainer would produce at least one, good indoor walking DVD.  I ONLY use Leslie's because it was the only way to get my previously-sedentary wife to ""exercise,"" and it's the only readily available, indoor guide.",1345507200,,1788,4.923076923076923

7995964,4,B0000A59VY,I love working out with Leslie Sansone. Always motivating and supportive. She encourages you to go only as fast or as long as you are able. Sometimes loses her train of thought and maybe goes a little too long on some parts of the walk but encourages you to make it your own walk and go at your own pace. Keep an eye on form and this exercise routine will burn some serious calories.,1336262400,,383,4.1891891891891895
