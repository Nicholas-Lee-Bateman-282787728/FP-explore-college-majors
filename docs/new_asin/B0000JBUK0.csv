1939525,3,B0000JBUK0,"Man this is some fun modern black exploitation and I must say I have never seen anything like it. I like this movie for a lot of resions, great dialog, great cast and for real looking settings. I only wish we would have had the token white hottie so the bad black girls could have picked on her skinny butt till she got her turn at the slasher's blade. The folks who are picken on this film must not like slasher film's.
I am telling you I have set threw way to many slasher flicks and this one is better then 50% of them any day of the week.
This is not Menace 2 Society people. This is trash talken thugs and one dude trying to make it out of the ghetto, oh that does sound familiar ..
any way good stuff, do not miss it.",1152489600,,723,3.958904109589041

1939527,1,B0000JBUK0,"I bought this movie then turned it in to a used dvd/cd exchange the following week...I was so dissapointed! In the film, the director, the actors, the script---Just dissapointed. I am a fan of indie films, and a film of urban films, however this is just a sad rip off of scream and I emphasize sad!!! And this trick that the studio plays on buyers placing Mack 10 and Bizzy Bone's names on the cover as leads when neither one of them have more than a few minutes of sceene time is unfair and missleading. If I were one of the true leading actors who starred in this film I would feel let down by this. Devoting much of your time to a project then getting pushed aside because you don't have a recognizable name?!?! Atleast they can say starring yadda yadda yadda with appearances by Mack 10 and Bizzy Bone. And the stars of the film from what I can remember gave dissmal performances. The main guy (corn rows, lightskin) was o.k. Nothing memorable. He's kinda pretty boyish but not a great performer nor believable. The leader of the opposing gang (tall, lrg frame, original suspect) was awful! Slured speach, needs acting lessons desperately. Bottom line- THIS FILM IS A JOKE! Not a funny one! I'm dissapointed in Tim Folsome! Maybe he was behind on his rent or something and needed money. Thats what it seemed like to me. That he threw anything into the market just to get paid! Shame on him!!!!",1087948800,3,1397,4.503937007874016
1939528,4,B0000JBUK0,"Cutthroat Alley is a decent film from one of the best independent directors of today (Timothy Wayne Forsome), I love his films, because of the realness and similar subjects of the ""Ghetto"", surrondings. Bizzy Bone is in a scene and so is the ""Crazy Thug"" Mack 10, but the lead actor in the film is awesome, If I was you I would get it if you are a true Timothy fan or just plain indies flim fan.",1074038400,,395,4.142857142857143
1939529,4,B0000JBUK0,"THIS FILM IS LIKE A CROSS BETWEEN ""SCREAM"" AND THE MOVIE ""BOYZ IN THA HOOD"".  I THOUGHT THE PLOT WAS WELL THOUGHT OUT AND THE CHARACTERS IN THE MOVIE WAS REALLY BELIEVABLE. I ENJOYED THE WRITER-DIRECTOR OF THE FILM (TIMOTHY WAYNE FOLSOM) PREVIOUS FILM ""UNINVITED GUEST"" WHICH STARED MEKI PHIFER AND NEEDLESS TO SAY I HAD HIGH EXPECTATIONS FOR ""CUTTHOAT ALLEY"". ALTHOUGH THE ACTORS WHO PROTRAYED THE CHARACTERS ""JACOBS"" AND ""BONES"" ARE VIRTUALLY UNKNOWNS, ALL THE ACTORS IN FILM HAD GREAT PERFORMANCE AND YOU WILL DEFINITELY SEE THEM ALL AGAIN!!! THE MOVIE WILL ACTUALLY HAVE YOU GUESSING TO THE VERY END AND YOU DEFINITELY WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED WITH THE FINALE.  THIS IS REALLY A CAN'T MISS MOVIE AND WHEN YOU RENT OR PURCHASE THE DVD  YOU WILL AT THE VERY LEAST BE ENTERTAINED!!!",1073174400,,783,4.8283582089552235
8002369,3,B0000JBUK0,Good urban horror tale that raises the issue of stereotypes.,1430956800,,60,5.1
8002370,4,B0000JBUK0,Not your typical slasher movie. This movie was surprisingly interesting. The special effects are totally cheap and the death scenes were terrible but the movie holds your interest until the end. There are so many suspects that you are still guessing at the end.,1428019200,,261,4.954545454545454
8002371,3,B0000JBUK0,it was ok..kinda generic horror,1428019200,,31,5.4
8002372,4,B0000JBUK0,"Bad on many, MANY levels and yet I found it very engaging. Cheaply produced and poorly acted yet still had enough of a plot to keep you guessing.  The killer will seem obvious but they threw in a red herring to throw you off track. It was fun seeing the nearly all black cast work their way through what is typically a white genre.",1421107200,,331,4.171875
8002373,4,B0000JBUK0,This is a movie about multiple murders of young people in a neighborhood. The plot is all about who's the murderer.  Kept me interested.,1420934400,,136,4.666666666666667
8002374,4,B0000JBUK0,I liked it.,1418860800,,11,3.0
8002375,3,B0000JBUK0,This is almost as good as Scream movie. I couldn't tell who was the killer! I could not take my eyes off this film.,1410480000,,115,3.8333333333333335
8002376,1,B0000JBUK0,"Bizzy dies in 1st 2 minutes, Mack 10's scenes were very minimal! enough said... the rest were no name actors and horrible, for some damn reason i watched the whole thing, a terrible wast of 2 hours! don't watch this movie or you'll be just as disappointed",1362528000,,255,4.446808510638298
8002377,3,B0000JBUK0,"This film is created by Timothy Wayne Folsome the same guy who made Jacked Up, so I wasn't expecting top quality material. But the film for being low budget was very good. Folsome can really make low budget films work. As for Bizzy Bone & Mack 10 is concerned, I don't wanna give anything away so I'll just say this, There names are just to sell film, they don't have major or big roles in the film.",1318550400,,399,4.194805194805195
8002378,4,B0000JBUK0,"This movie is O.K. Bizzy doesn't come out for to long but, it still has a good story line and will have you guessing to the very last moment!",1168300800,,141,3.896551724137931
