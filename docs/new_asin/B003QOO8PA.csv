4171051,4,B003QOO8PA,This is a B movie at best.  The plot is weak and so are the action scenes. Save your money and purchase a decent movie.,1374710400,,119,3.76
4171052,4,B003QOO8PA,"William Lustig, the director of Maniac and the Maniac Cop series, helms this nasty and sadly forgotten little exploitation gem from 1983.  Vigilante stars Robert Forester as Eddie, a New York factory worker making an honest living and living a happy life with his wife and young son.  All that doesn't last long however as his wife is brutally assaulted and son murdered by a street gang, who subsequently escape the charges thanks to a corrupt judge.  Eddie eventually takes the law into his own hands, with bloody results.  Featuring a solid cast (Forester, genre stalwart Fred Williamson, Woody Strode, and Maniac's own Joe Spinell) and some surprisingly well orchestrated action sequences, Vigilante is a gritty and dark treat.  It may come off as Death Wish-lite for some, but for what it is it works, and is a sadly overlooked and forgotten gem of the era.",1339804800,3,862,4.876712328767123
4171053,2,B003QOO8PA,low budget filmaking not at its best. kudos to the film makers however for finding ways to finance a the film anyhow but really just a Death Wish knockoff. non original.even the commentary was boring. nowhere worth the retail price.,1339545600,,232,4.825
4171054,5,B003QOO8PA,"Sorta like Deathwish , but with a less complex lead character who teams up with like-minded cohorts. Corruption is the main ingredient  to be dealt with. XLNT A/V.",1338681600,,163,4.821428571428571
4171055,4,B003QOO8PA,"This is a review of the Blue Underground Blu-Ray release of VIGILANTE.

Forster steals the show here.  I purchased this having already been a fan of William Lustig's 'Maniac Cop' series and also having been a fan of the original 'Death Wish'.  This movie is the perfect combination of Lustig's saavy B-movie direction and the shocking but gratifying Death Wish-style revenge thriller.  This is an unbelievable transfer that exploitation fans will love.  Blue Underground delivers the goods, I guess it's good to be the boss!",1295568000,3,524,5.117647058823529
4171056,4,B003QOO8PA,"I was suprised how much i liked it. I think it was good. I think Fred Williamson was very good and the best
character in the film. He got charisma. He had several lines in the film which i liked. When he said ""Save some
for me, Burke"", i couldn`t help but to smile. I must say i liked that dark Synthesizer music that was used to
great effect. This was a good purchase.

Picture Quality: 4.5/5

I was impressed with the picture quality, which i think was pretty sharp and detailed. The colours and such
looked clear and strong on my flat screen. I satisfied with it. I didn`t notice any use of noise reduction, which i
was glad i didn`t see.

Audio Quality: 4/5

I was less impressed by the DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1. I think the some of the gunshot effects could have had
more bass. Like for example when Fred used a shotgun. It didn`t have a lot of bass. Strange thing, when he
used a somekind of Revolver, it had more bass than that shotgun!. Hm. Also one other problem i had with this
audio track, was that i feel the music was mixed too loud and the dialog too low. I often had to turn the volume
down when i heard the music. When there was dialog scenes i had to turn the volume up.

I think people doing this remix should have corrected these problems. I did find it annoying. The music sounded
pretty good and clear in the Center speaker. I heard some good bass coming from my subwoofer when the
Synthesizer music was used. The Rear speakers was mostly used for good effect, like for example, i heard: of
course music there, gunshots, people in prison shouting and cars crashing. So, i think the people in charge of
making this audio track could have done a better job. Except for the problems i mentioned, i think it was good,
but not very good.

Film: 4/5

 transfer was good, so, this version will do, nonetheless.",1514592000,,203,5.151515151515151

8402397,5,B003QOO8PA,"Blu-Ray Review: Blue underground version. This Blu Ray comes with 2 audio commentaries, trailers, radio spots BLAH BLAH BLAH!! The picture quality is in 2:35 ratio and a tad better than the DVD but I highly doubt anyone will even notice.

Movie Review: This film is about vigilantism but more about a family man who seeks vengeance against some annoying retards for killing his kid and mutilating his wife's boobies. This is an excellent vigilante movie but it's nowhere near as good as Death Wish but still provides some great acting, blooding violence and a good story. Yippy.

Conclusion: 4 stars for the Blu Ray and 4 1/2 for Vigilante.",1437177600,2,640,4.8090909090909095
8402398,4,B003QOO8PA,"Great 80's exploitation flick.  Some pretty cool scenes and it doesn't disappoint.  Some unintentionally funny moments to be expected from a low budget action film, but that's part of the fun isn't it?  Some great character actors, a preposterous story, and some flat-out over the top moments.  For genre fans it's a must.",1436140800,,322,5.018867924528302

8402401,5,B003QOO8PA,This is a great gritty revenge film. Robert Forster and Fred Williamson are amazing in their roles as is the rest of the supporting cast. Woody Strode was a beast in this at seventy years old!!!! Joe Spinell's cameo was great too. Great direction by William Lustig and the score by Jay Chattaway was amazing!!!!! Do yourself a favor and pick up Blue Underground's blu-ray of this classic!!!! Highly recommended,1408924800,,410,4.871428571428571
8402402,5,B003QOO8PA,"Got this Blu on special below 10 Dollars.
At this price the disc brings high value for this indie film. Much in the vein of Death Wish for its gritty representation of urban violence, Williamson and Forster shine in their portrayals of every-day men.
Director Lustig also provides 2 audio commentaries that candidly look back at the making of the film.
The image in itself has been restored to a pristine state for a film of this age.
Round this presentation with trailers, promo-reel and multi-languages and you get this fantastic disc.

8402403,4,B003QOO8PA,This is a fun 70's film with some classic exploitation movie stars. Lots of good stuff going on along with another good actor Robert Forster. It's worth the time.,1384387200,,162,4.620689655172414
8402404,3,B003QOO8PA,"I think Robert Forster is a hugely underrated talent... and probably the best thing about this film. It's well plotted and really kinetic in the staging of action scenes. I probably need more time to truly digest the film, but it's certainly worth a look and stands up well against similar films of the same era - most notably, of course, Death Wish.",1380672000,,350,4.571428571428571
