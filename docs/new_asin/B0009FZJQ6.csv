8060110,5,B0009FZJQ6,"I just finished the story about Howard Hughes and the Flying Boat with great interest as my father was one of the original wood workers that built the HK1. I was born in Culver City at the time my dad was working for Hughes Aircraft. For years afterwards he would relate how he believed the time he spent at Hughes was the best job he ever had. He really admired Hughes for his knowledge and technical standards that were required to build the big plane. This book tells much of the trials and aspects of the planes construction, as well as some insight into the personal life of Mr Hughes. Dad would have loved to have been part of its move to McMinnville, Oregon where the ship is now proudly and appropriately displayed at the Evergreen Aviation Museum. I would highly recommend this book to anyone that is interested in studying this Icon of its time in aviation history. The HK1 was a truly remarkable accomplishment as you will learn from reading this book.",1327622400,,963,4.540229885057471
8060111,5,B0009FZJQ6,"Howard Hughes was an incredible person.  He was a brilliant innovator, a supremely brave risk-taker, and genuinely talented.
He was a pioneer in aviation, setting speed and endurance records as a pilot, and he owned Trans World Airlines.
Plus, he had all the money he could have ever wanted, to do exactly whatever he may have decided to do.
He took up the challenge to do what seemed impossible:  Somehow, transport goods to England during the height of WW II, when Hitler's U-Boats were blowing transport ships out of the water just about as fast as they could build and launch them.  He came up with the idea of creating huge cargo planes which could land on the water, and supplying the cargo to England by air.
Airplanes weren't new, nor were boats, or even flying boats.  But one had never been built on the scale that he envisioned, to fly huge cargo loads across the ocean.
But they threw a monkey wrench into his gears, saying that he couldn't use scarce materials such as steel, aluminum, or copper, because of the war.
Actually, that wasn't such a unique condition, because up until just about that time, virtually all airplanes had been constructed using wooden frames, with canvas fabric stretched over them.  All-metal planes were just barely coming into existence.
So he proposed to make it out of wood.  But not just any wood - he found a unique method of using a super waterproof glue to fuse thin sheets of hardwood together, like plywood, that were strong enough to support the weight of giant cargo loads, and build a flying boat on a scale that no one had ever envisioned before.
But wood is incredibly heavy, and hardwood even moreso.  And so he needed eight of the biggest airplane engines ever built, just to get this thing into the air.
Of course, starting from scratch took time, and he ran into one production headache after another, and the war was over before he could ever get it finished.  A competitor in the airline business in cahoots with a US Senator brought charges against him, saying he was ripping off the government for millions of dollars.
He stared down the US Government in the Senate hearings, and prevailed.  This, of course, took incredible courage, but he had it, in spades.
But the plane still had not flown, so he finally finished it with his own money and did fly it himself, even if just a few feet off of the water, many years after the war.
But it did fly, nevertheless, which silenced his critics and vindicated him of any blame, which was a red herring to begin with.
BTW - The editorial comments by Perry Seibert were not quite correct:  Hughes didn't invent the flying boat.  In fact, there were many of them already in use - even by the military, before Hughes ever built the Hercules.
The flying boat, or seaplane concept was first invented in 1876, which was, of course, a biplane, and several designs - even a few triplanes - were built back in the early 1930s.
A flying boat was especially useful in countries which didn't have airports already constructed, and was also very good at spotting submarines at sea.
And so, a plane made of wood was not particularly unique at that time; in fact, planes had only recently begun to be made of aluminum, at the beginning of WWII.  Several of the warplanes built during the war had at least partial wooden construction, which was very much the norm up until that time.
Prior to the development of light-weight aluminum for framing, and the strong aluminum-alloy sheeting that could be utilized for the shell of the plane, it was very common for the frame to be made of wood, with a canvas cloth fabric covering the ribs.",1320883200,,3625,4.611801242236025
8060112,5,B0009FZJQ6,"So far, this is the only Howard Hughes documentary that concentrates solely on the technical genius of Howard Hughes at his pinnacle before the jackals and all measure of men converged to aid in his self-destructon in 1976. What better narrator to have on this journey of discovery than ""Twenty Century's"" own Walter Cronkite. I had known how devoted his personal assistants and hired-hands could be, so the narrative to this exciting documentary gets wonderfully enlarged by surviving members of the engineering crew that built and flew aboard the ""Spruce Goose's"" single maiden voyage throughout. The details and background to this war-time built cargo plane have always been shrouded in mystery. Until now. Happily, the H K-1, now resides in Oregon in a fittingly aviation museum of the highest devotion. In about an hour, you get to see this aircraft go from pencil design to its monstrous proportions and then thrill in the first ride along with Howard Hughes. You will hear the original radio broadcast as the H K-1 glides to lift-off. What follows her subsequent period of hibernation (1948-1080) to re-discovery and new ownership is a moving delight to aviation buffs. And when you see this aircraft suspended with a new paint job in her final place of adoration and care is very moving. Learning of all the technical features this aircraft contributed to aviation progress you will realize what a denigration it was to label this technical wonder ""Spruce Goose"" alone. Of special significance is the time-lapse disassembly and reassembly that she underwent to reach her final residence. Some of the most devoted aviation experts and admirers of Howard Hughes made this re-discovery possible. Howard Hughes defies the playboy, reclusive Movie director mythology this time around.",1318118400,,1787,5.186851211072664
8060113,5,B0009FZJQ6,"Enjoyed the entire CD.  My father, who was part of that flight crew, says it is factually accurate.  He wasn't too impressed by previous CD's about Howard Hughes, as they weren't entirely true.",1305244800,,193,4.818181818181818
8060114,5,B0009FZJQ6,"The Hughes flying boat, popularly known as the Spruce Goose, has been shrouded in mystery for decades before finally going on public display.  This video has LOTS of information, including original footage of the only flight, from inside the cockpit and outside, construction details, and footage of Howard Hughes himself..  The story is very thoroughly presented, right up to the the most recent move to the museum in Oregon.  With all the video, and a very extensive gallery of stills, this DVD may well contain virtually everything that exists on this unique aircraft.  I'm well satisfied!",1187913600,,592,5.135416666666667
