8560073,5,B00B04NIU4,"Two awesome and funny movies for a great price. They are movies I was planning on buying on bluray separate and that would have easily been $20.00.

Holy Man is a really funny Eddie Murphy movie, not like his R-Rated movies, it is a movie the whole family can enjoy and there is a wonderful message this movie puts out.

Gone Fishin' If you love Slapstick humor and you love Joe Pesci and Danny Glover you will love this! They are both at their funniest in this movie, well My Cousin Vinny was funnier but this is a close second!",1399075200,2,529,4.28
