8052779,1,B0007WFUC4,The sound quit about half way through the DVD. I tried twice again and it quite each time at the same place. I could pause and then hit play and for just about 5 seconds I had sound. I tried this at different dead audio points with the same results. This is a bad recording. I hope you will replace it.,1471219200,,302,3.9672131147540983
8052780,5,B0007WFUC4,"Modern Marvels : The Telephone hits all the high notes and sound them out well.  If you have seen one Modern Marvels you have seen them all.  The handling of the basic facts behind the invention of the telephone are handled in usual competent History Channel Style.  The Modern Marvels Telephone presentation style is perfect for children from grades 4th to 9th.  Of course Modern Marvels : The Telephone only talks about POTS, Plain Old Telephone Systems.  Today's phones which are cell phones, smart phones or video phones and the like are not really covered at all.  Modern Marvels : The Telephone would work well if the subject matter were limited to the 20th century industrial revelation.  There were a few tidbits in the Modern Marvels : The Telephone DVD that were unknown to me so I learn a few things.  The subject matter on the phone and Alexander G. Bell was interesting.  The pacing of Modern Marvels : The Telephone was faster than plodding pace of many History Channel Modern Marvels.  The still and moving visuals were great.  My review is not long because; Modern Marvels : The Telephone was competently done and thus is of good value for its price.  Modern Marvels : The Telephone does what it is expected to do I can't give a better rating than that!",1357257600,,1269,4.666666666666667
8052781,5,B0007WFUC4,"Modern Marvels: The Telephone tells the fascinating story of the race to invent the telephone and how the telephone was used and evolved over time in both the United States and the world. The story moves along at a pretty brisk pace; there's a lot of information jammed into a fifty minute installment of Modern Marvels and I certainly didn't get bored. The archival footage is wonderful and we see many original drawing by Alexander Graham Bell and his chief rivals as they raced to invent and patent the telephone.

This installment of Modern Marvels is very thoughtfully presented in chronological format; there's no jumping back and forth in time. We learn about Alexander Graham Bell, his assistant Mr. Watson and his chief rivals including Gray and even Edison through narration, pictures and archival footage. Bell started out wanting to invent a device to help the deaf communicate; but, as fate would have it, he ultimately invented something else altogether instead--the telephone. It's equally interesting to see how Bell's company (with the help of his financial backer Gardner Hubbard) could compete and ultimately do business with Western Union in the quest to provide instant communication to as many people as possible as fast as possible using the right devices and the technology they had at the time.

While the original telephone operators were rather young men, Bell's company switched to using women instead--and wow, how they were tough on those women! They had strict dress codes and demanding, authoritarian supervisors to keep the young women ""in line."" I could tell you why Bell's company made the switch but I'm not going to spoil that for you.

Indeed, we also learn about many other developments after the very first telephones were used in people's homes; but I won't go into any of that here because I would hate to spoil that for you, either. This brief documentary is at its best with a good amount of new material for you to watch!

The telephone continues to have a huge impact on society--even in the computer age. I highly recommend this installment of Modern Marvels from The History Channel.",1246147200,3,2131,4.96078431372549
