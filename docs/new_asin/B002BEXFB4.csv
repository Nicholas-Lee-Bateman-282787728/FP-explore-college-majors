8361278,3,B002BEXFB4,"When calibrating softcore cinema, you've got to adjust the yardstick considerably, otherwise few stack up as cohesive, coherent movies. Italian sex comedies from the 70's are among some of the worst, yet there are many golden eggs to be found for those with patience. Unfortunately, this isn't one of them, and I have little patience, but it has its moments and does benefit immensely thanks to the talents of Edwige Fenech and Carlo Giuffre.

Carlo plays a womanizing shoe salesman and down-on-his-luck gambler who's 'servicing' two rich sisters to avoid financial ruin, and has now moved in with them to do additional chores. In for a visit comes their brother, a novelist, with his German, Wagner-loving vegetarian wife in tow, the ever-adorable Edwige Fenech. Carlo naturally falls in lust, but his advances fall flat with a resounding thud. That is until he finds out she gets turned on by water, in any form, and then watch out. Now Carlo has more 'chores' than he can possibly handle with one toolkit, until he gets a foolish idea... and the ensuing comedic disaster strikes.

This is a harmless, lightweight comedy with some slapstick, but not too much (I hate slapstick) and, thankfully, doesn't delve into the brutally stupid toilet humor that 'The Lady Medic', another Fenech flick, revels in. But I also hate watching dubbed foreign films, as the voiceovers are done by non-actors, and the movie always suffers as a result. This is a big fault here, as one of the sisters' voice is dubbed by someone doing a horrible Katherine Hepburn impersonation, and the other sister sounds like Audrey Meadows ('Alice Kramden' on 'The Honeymooners'), and this proved too much of a distraction for me. If you're a Fenech fan, it's a must-see, like most of her 'body' of work, otherwise, you might want to consider  `Lover Boy', `The Virgo, The Taurus And The Capricorn' or `Cattivi Pensieri' before this. 'Poker In Bed'? I'd poke her just about anywhere...",1279584000,10,1955,4.9361702127659575
