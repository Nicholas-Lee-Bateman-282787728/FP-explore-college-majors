It all works ok with my multiformat TV/VCR. The only problem I found was that they sent me THE WRONG BLOODY FILM. I wanted King Boxer AKA Five Fingers of Death; they sent me The King Boxer- trust me, it's an entirely different film! Ok, I can understand how the difficulty can arise, but I'm not happy in the slightest. All those looking to buy this- WATCH OUT! You may be in for a let-down...",1060646400,,546,4.20952380952381
8237350,5,B00001U0E5,"I picked this movie up on after seeing that it was a Shaw Bros. film and it was starring Lo Lieh. I didn't really know what to expect but what I discovered was one of the greatest martial arts films in history. This movie never lags and there's always a new fight scene around the corner, it's just totally action packed with some of the most innovative fight choreography I have ever witnessed. If you are a fan of kung fu movies, you owe it to yourself to purchase this film! This is classic stuff, right up there with The 5 Deadly Venoms. I actually enjoyed it more.",1004745600,,569,4.277777777777778
