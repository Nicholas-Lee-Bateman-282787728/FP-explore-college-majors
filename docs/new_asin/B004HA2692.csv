At least now,you,dear consumer,may benefit from my quite expensive errors....this DVD is,like many others,a filmic version of some popular novels. In this case,Norwegian. Now,At a guess not too many of us out here in viewer land speak Nordic languages. And DVD marketers worldwide have a habit of re-naming and re-packaging things...which can be a tad confusing,especially when ordering product over the web,from tiny images in languages other than English! So,as I really liked Trond whatsit Espens' portrayal of our hero Varg Veum it was with some excitement that I saw what seemed to be set 2 of the series! The title above is just one of the films,or episodes,by the way! Disappointing,in itself. But worse was to come,dear consumer! When the long awaited set 2,Varg Veum, arrived,it wasn't! Without actually ripping the package open I realized it was just the first series:just re-packaged and re-titled. But in all other respects the EXACT SAME CONTENT!Unfortunately ,",1360281600,,1109,5.235955056179775
