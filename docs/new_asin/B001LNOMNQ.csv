8319002,2,B001LNOMNQ,"This was a DVD of a movie I saw many years ago. Part of the movie has been cut in this release and the quality of the product is less than par. I was not pleased with the movie being edited and parts removed. The only positive I can think of is that I found it here, and can't find it anywhere else.",1467849600,,299,3.761904761904762
8319003,1,B001LNOMNQ,"The reason I bought this DVD is because I was friends with Jeri Jensen, billed as ""Karin March,"" who plays the cacklin' and scratchin' ""Ma Basham"" in this forgotten cinematic opus from 1964.  It was produced and directed by the infamous Herschell Gordon Lewis, and never has so overextended a name been bestowed on so little.  The so-called plot concerns a country singing star who journeys to the hinterlands of South Carolina to soak up some ""authentic"" hill country sounds for his next hit album.  A local hillbilly clobbers the star and steals his ""Fancy Jim"" jacket and money.  Then the star is invited to stay with the Carpenters, an inbred family of stereotyped rural idiots, who spend their time drinkin' ""white lightnin',"" eatin' ""ma's vittles,"" and holdin' raucous barn dances.  The local sheriff is a corrupt scum and serial rapist, and his deputy is a ""Lenny"" style hulk who clobbers federal A.T.F. agents from the back.  The ""exciting"" conclusion shows the Carpenters' still, holding some three bodies, being blown up.  And THEN the movie unwisely staggers on for about three more scenes which add up to nothing.  If you somehow are still watching by then.  My excuse was, I knew one of the actors, who I think got paid by the scratch.  Jeri Jensen went on one year later to appear in a good movie, ""Mickey One,"" with Warren Beatty, and directed by Arthur Penn.  Too bad she did not get more film roles, because she was an attractive and talented lady.

  As for the quality of this print, it could not be much worse.  Colors are all faded, the audio stinks, there are scratches and ""U.F.O."" looking artifacts hovering in place.  Also some reels end virtually with the old ""flap flap flap"" of the reel-end celluloid slapping the projector.  If you are a masochist with a bit of money to burn, you might get some fun out of ""Moonshine Mountain.""  For anybody else, it is the movie equivalent of the stuff that makes plants grow.",1418256000,,1940,4.706231454005935
8319004,1,B001LNOMNQ,sorry stupid and degrading to all southerners no plot no seance bad directing bad background info evidently  none of the actors or directors ever saw a still or knew the process  if I could I would ask for my money back and throw it away at least I would have the satisfaction of accomplishment  to say it sucked would be a understatement well you ask,1363737600,,351,4.369230769230769
8319005,2,B001LNOMNQ,"I'm not sure if a decent print of ""Moonshine Mountain"" exists somewhere out there, but this version isn't it.  It's watchable, but there are so many vertical lines and scratches & faded parts that it kind of detracts from the viewing experience.  I'm a HG Lewis fan, and this is one that I had never seen, so I'm glad to have now seen it, but if you're interested in this, I'm not sure I could give it a great recommendation, based on the quality of the transfer.

The story is that of a big folk-singing star, who goes to live in the boonies with the common folk for a while, and while at first he's not successful in ""blending in"", he does get their attention with his guitar-picking abilities.  He befriends a family of drunkards and simpletons, some of whom sing great harmony considering they're supposedly bombed out of their minds on pop skull most of the time.  One of the family members is good old Dr. Gore himself, J.G. ""Pat"" Patterson, Jr., who looks his part quite well.

Of course, with stills & moonshine come revenuers, but the revenuers keep disappearing, and the government agents that come looking for the revenuers disappear too...something to do with the sheriff and his goofy hulking deputy, Luther, who wears overalls tied up with a rope & a child's cowboy hat.  The fate of the revenuers makes you wonder what these here folks have been drinking, but it's quite appropriate for a HG Lewis film.

This is a kind of fun film, in a stupid way, but it's also fairly fascinating since it's not ""typical"" Lewis material.  Oh, for a decent print of it, though....
