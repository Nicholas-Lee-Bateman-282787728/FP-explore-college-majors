5162416,1,B008H6GHD8,"The Monster Truck portion was entertaining enough, but this is a religious program aimed at the pre-preschoolers rather than the normal developmental education expected.  That said, the religious education parts were not done very well: disembodied voice speaking over scripture printed on the screen is the wrong format for the target age group.

Please ensure the Judaeo/Christian faith is consistent with your families beliefs and choice of worship.",1444867200,,452,5.632352941176471

5162420,5,B008H6GHD8,my 3 almost 4 year old boy loves this DVD and so does my 6 year old daughter. I love how it shows bible versus and then how to apply them to what happened at the end of the show.  It just totally backs up what we teach them all the time. We went on vacation and the kids wanted to watch this one over and over again. I hope to support those making these videos and tell my friends about them. It's entertaining but backs up good character and a relationship with God. Love it. It's hard to find good things like this.,1426896000,,517,3.9711538461538463

5162422,5,B008H6GHD8,"I was looking for a movie that had a good message about God.  We had tried the Veggietales movies but none of us really liked them especially my son.  I picked one of these up at the Christian Bookstore on a whim and fell in love.  We have ordered 2 more from Amazon.  It has a story, a recap and a Bible Verse!  I love it!!!  And more importantly my son loves it too!",1400716800,3,368,3.9054054054054053
5162423,5,B008H6GHD8,"Very entertaining for all 3 children, 2 yrs, 4 yrs, and 5 yrs old.  We are particular on what we allow them to watch on tv, and we had no problems with this video at all.  They love it, and it adds another avenue for the Christian values we are trying to instill in them. Hope to buy more of the series.",1390176000,,303,3.870967741935484

8527982,5,B008H6GHD8,"All my boys (2, 5, 9) love this show. It does clearly state Bible verses and is very entertaining to watch. The monster trucks talk and have childlike voices and they make mistakes like kids do and then learn from their mistakes.",1486512000,,229,4.476190476190476

8527988,3,B008H6GHD8,"I checked this movie out from our local library in my search to find cartoons with a biblical message in them. My son doesn't care for Veggie Tales, but loves trucks and trains, so this was perfect. The cartoons themselves are very cute and definitely gained his interest.  However, I'm a little disappointed in the scripture references at the end of each episode. Sometimes the way the narrator/announcer tries to connect them to the show doesn't always play together in a way that makes easy sense to me, let alone a child. Also, the narrator at the end gives examples of what should have been done according to the word, but none of the cartoon characters themselves reflect on the word at all. If fact, if it weren't the message at the end, you would never know these were Christian cartoons.  I wish the characters somehow reflected their faith by going to prayer, or talking about Jesus, etc, without coming across as cheesy or fake, but more in a real way that kids would understand vs. a narrator at the end doing their best to portray a scripture that doesn't always match up with the message they're trying to convey.",1449619200,2,1127,4.63
8527989,5,B008H6GHD8,"These are great cartoons, with a positive message & no hidden agenda from a progressive society. My five year old loves them, has loved them since discovering them s year ago. Big monster trucks with a life lesson!",1445644800,,214,4.657894736842105
