8531251,5,B008VV4YGG,"Fun stuff in the memorabilia portion. I gave this to my husband. He spent hours going over each bit and talking about steam engines and trains. Trains changed England, for better and worse, and even today are an important part of the entire economy and social structure. This set is interesting and contains fascinating old footage.",1515628800,,332,4.946428571428571

8531253,5,B008VV4YGG,"It is a great documentary of The Flying Scotsman, and while the earlier films are dated and audio is laking, they are a wonderful addition to any train buff's library.  The little trinkets that are included are grand for those of us young enough not to have had the pleasure of riding during the golden age.",1367366400,3,307,4.482142857142857
