But it's not just a lotta chop-chop, slash-slash. No, no, no. There're REASONS why these guys are trying to hack each other to death with big blades, most of which involve - yes, you guessed it - women and honor (and not necessarily in that order).

Like a lot of Mexican films of this type, in terms of atmosphere and plot, this feels very much like a Western and, essentially, it is. Except that it takes place on the beach (in Barra de Coyuca, apparently), and instead of guns the guys use machetes.

MACHETES.

The climax, however, is surprisingly...well, I don't want to give it away, but let's just say that it's not the usual sort of thing one sees in a south-of-the-border action-drama. But it does involve machetes.

MACHETES.
