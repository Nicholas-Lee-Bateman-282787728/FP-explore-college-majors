5638786,1,B00BL3TPN8,"If you like hearing  someone ramble on and on about nothing to do with playing guitar  or maybe even being  talked  to you like you` re  a  2 year old, this is the  product you`ve been looking for.
If you`re a normal human avoid this waste of time and money.",1376352000,4,258,4.04

8570160,2,B00BL3TPN8,"If you always wondered what it would be like to learn guitar from a liberal environmentalist child psychologist, here is your chance.  The first DVD has almost nothing to do with playing guitar, and the lesson where she wanted you to bang the back of the guitar like a drum made me wince.  She doesn't play in standard tuning until the last DVD (disc 4).  I don't think I've watched an instructional guitar video with as much buzzing as this.

I thought this would be geared toward learning acoustic guitar techniques and not just a 'learn guitar' video.  If you already know the basic chords in standard tuning this video will probably be of little help.",1482796800,,655,4.612068965517241

8570162,5,B00BL3TPN8,"About a year ago I found this series at the library but, being a library check-out, I could only keep it for a short time so I bought it from Amazon. What a great instructional program. Learning the approach with open G made me feel success from the beginning which encouraged me to keep working at it rather than being frustrated immediately.
Now, having signed up for formal classes, I have something solid to compare this approach to. Jessica's approach is a far better start than the highly acclaimed guitar program I've been to now for four classes. If I'd started in this class - and been asked to make C and G chords - I'd be incredibly frustrated.
As an older student - I highly endorse this. Buy it! :-)",1475020800,4,712,4.442748091603053
8570163,5,B00BL3TPN8,This DVD set is an awesome teaching tool. Just by putting the DVD in my player I've started learning to play acoustic guitar! So easy to understand! The instructor in the video lessons is very thorough. Her teaching techniques are simple and not confusing. A lot easier way to start learning guitar than I expected! I highly recommend this DVD guitar lesson set. 5 Stars from this very happy student.,1468022400,3,400,4.728571428571429

8570167,5,B00BL3TPN8,"This course is unlike any that I have seen. Jess Baron's approach is colored by her background in Psychology and her work as a mentor for school music teachers who want to incorporate the guitar into their classes. Her approach is comprehensive, but not intimidating. She is very encouraging.  The course is perfect for young people or anyone who has tried to learn guitar, but got discouraged.

She covers all the basics that you would expect in a beginner course, but adds exercises in rhythm, voice, relaxation, ear training and more. She starts off ""gently"" with the guitar tuned to Open G, which facilitates chord fingerings and allows the student to get right into making music. She does eventually, tune the guitar to standard tuning; but hopefully, by that point (Lesson 25 of 34) the student is hooked.

By the end of the course the student will be comfortable maintaining and tuning the guitar. They will be able to play and sing several folk songs using basic chords and strumming with only their fingers, a pick or finger picking. She even teaches you how to create your own blues tune.

This course is aimed at beginners, so it does not cover scales (besides Do, re, mi...) or lead playing, but if you want to learn enough to be able to teach kids or have fun around the campfire, this course will get you there.

Songs include: Sweet Home Chicago, She'll Be Coming Around the Mountain, Drunken Sailor, Motherless Child, Over the River and Through the Woods, etc.",1442102400,5,1476,4.727626459143969
