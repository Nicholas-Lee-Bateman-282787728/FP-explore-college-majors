8208820,4,B000TFDNEQ,Production value is a bit dated - as it's 25 years old - but that adds to the character of this doc.  Feels like a small town team - which is exactly what it should feel like.,1438819200,,175,3.72972972972973
8208821,5,B000TFDNEQ,Interesting and good insight on the trials of getting to the Big Show..,1428796800,,71,4.538461538461538
8208822,3,B000TFDNEQ,Good reading but I didn't realize it was so dated when I ordered the book.  Good folowing  the Oaks through teh year and seeing the Manager giving help to the young kids in their first year of pro ball.,1362355200,,202,4.153846153846154
8208823,2,B000TFDNEQ,"First, I am a big CAL League fan.  I have four stadiums within an hour of me.  This is a big reason why players enjoy the CAL league. Short bus trips.

That said, this video is not very good. It was ""filmed"" in 1991. (Videotaped, actually).  Graphics are amateur, audio editing is not very good either. Many times it is difficult to determine who is doing the commentary.

There is no value-added content here.  This is, quite simply, a diary of a season with the Visalia Oaks of the CAL High 'A' League (now the Visalia Rawhide).

One nice part was seeing the teams and ballparks from 20 years ago, just before MiLB's resurgence. Minor League ball in 1991 is not much more than sandlot. Terrible stadiums, sparse crowds, and lame entertainment.  This video does make you appreciate the major upgrades to MiLB in the last 20 years.

I also enjoyed the scenes from my old local ballpark Fiscalini Field featured in ""Stealing Home"" (Mark Harmon and Jodie Foster).  Our local team now plays a few miles away in the palatial Arrowhead Credit Union Park.

I am the prime, targeted consumer of a video like this, and I didn't like it much.  I don't see how anyone else would.  Read or listen to ""The Bullpen Gospels""  by Dirk Hayhurst for a much more entertaining and vivid perspective on Minor League baseball.",1292889600,,1305,4.593073593073593
8208824,5,B000TFDNEQ,"Great video on the behind the scenes of minor league professional baseball.  Shows that not all professional ballplayers are pampered prima donnas with multi-million dollar salaries.  The video takes you through the trials and tribulations of life in the minors, where the dreams are huge and the future can sometimes be brutal.  All young ballplayers with dreams of playing in the majors should watch this video.",1201046400,2,413,5.2272727272727275
