5647836,4,B00BMRMTJU,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

Thanks to author John Grisham, I enjoy a good legal thriller, whether in book or film form.  Even so, horror will always be my favorite genre in either media.  So when I received the press release for THE BLOODSTAINED BUTTERFLY, which is touted as a giallo-styled legal thriller, my curiosity was instantly piqued.  Could two vastly different genres be fused into an entertaining film?

The answer is yes.  THE BLOODSTAINED BUTTERFLY is not your everyday giallo, nor is it an actual horror movie per se.  But regardless of how you classify it, the film is vastly entertaining and very worthy of a look.

I think the uniqueness of this film is a big part of what makes it so entertaining.  Its not really a horror movie, although it does have the slasher element to it.  Instead, its more of a crime-drama with bite.  Granted, some of the court scenes seem a bit long, but they are important to keep the story moving.  In the end, I think even seasoned horror fans will enjoy this one anyway.

THE BLOODSTAINED BUTTERFLY is shot very well, and the HD transfer looks excellent.  I don't know what previous DVD and VHS versions look like, but the quality of the Blu-ray makes it look like the film could have been made in recent years.  Likewise, the sound is great as well; the surround sound is crisp and clear.

The acting is very good, with Helmet Berger headlining alongside Evelyn Stewart and Carole Andre.  The whole cast meshes well, and the chemistry between them is evident onscreen.  I particularly like how theres no over-acting in this film; some of the giallos Ive seen in the past are overloaded with Captain Kirk-esque characters, and they get old very fast.  Not so here, thankfully.

The story is interesting and inventive, however as I mentioned earlier, its not really a horror piece.  Instead, the plot unfolds into a murder mystery.  The audience is given clues as the storyline progresses, which allows a deeper immersion into the film.  The end is satisfying and fun, a worthy conclusion to a great film.

THE BLOODSTAINED BUTTERFLY is a great flick, and I recommend it.  Dont go into it expecting a lot of gore or intensity.  Just accept the fact its a legal thriller with some giallo aspects, and youll be in for a treat.",1474243200,,2317,4.645320197044335

5647838,5,B00BMRMTJU,"This review was originally written for my website Mind of Tatlock. The product was provided for review.

The 1970s were a busy time for Giallo films in Italy, with well over a dozen (a conservative estimate) being released a year. The competition was certainly stiff, so you would need to have to take a different approach in order to rise above the other films. The step that The Bloodstained Butterfly chooses, is to skip on the blood and focus on the police procedural process of catching a criminal. Its an interesting concept that worked in The Bloodstained Butterflys favour.

Movie Review

A nameless teenagers body rolls lifelessly down a hill, with the only suspect, a TV sports anchor seen fleeing the scene. The police commence their investigation and mount up plenty of evidence against the suspect. They manage to finally arrest the man and take the case in front of the court. However, while the original suspect wallows behind bars, another murder takes place with the same M.O. Could it be that the wrong killer rots behind bars, even though all the evidence proves he is guilty? A murder mystery is certainly afoot in The Bloodstained Butterfly.

Years before shows like CSI and Law & Order flooded your TV sets, The Bloodstained Butterfly came along and turned the Giallo genre on its head by focusing on what goes into catching a killer and putting him away for good. However, this wouldnt be a Giallo without a few more murders to spice things up and throw a wrench in the whodunit answers the viewer seeks.

Director Duccio Tessari manages to keep the murders a mystery all the way to the bloody end. Although, he doesnt make things easier for the viewer to guess what or how its going to go down. Writers Gianfranco Clerici and Duccio Tessari threw in several red herrings, cheating spouses and mysterious glances to keep the viewer on their toes.

Fans of bloody Giallos, with brilliant colour and glorious set pieces like Mario Bavas Blood and Black Lace, might end up being disappointed with The Bloodstained Butterfly. It is light on the blood and murder, with only three nearly bloodless murders taking place. This may make a Giallo fan grumble, but it would be a disservice to the flick if you skipped out on seeing it due to the lack of red plasma plastering the screen.

If you happened to have checked out Arrow Videos other Blu-ray release of Death Walks at Midnight, you may notice that Musician Gianni Ferrio is again hitting the right notes with this flick. Gianni Ferrio perfectly channels Tchaikovsky with his work, as Tchaikovskys music plays an important role in the plot. As mentioned in the included essay with Troy Howarth, the music in the film can feel out of place at times, but that was the normal thing with plenty of Italian Giallos.

Blu-ray Opinion:

Presented in a stunning 4K restoration, The Bloodstained Butterfly lands high on the list of perfectly done transfers from Arrow Video. The film appears clean, with dirt and debris removed in several areas, but still keeping the film grain intact. Both Italian, with new English subtitles, and English Dubbed are the two options on the Blu-ray for audio.  However, Italian with subtitles is the way to go with this flick, as the English dubbing is laughable.

The Blu-ray has a well-rounded amount of special features, with one favourite being the visual essay with Troy Howarth on the Giallo industry, with The Bloodstained Butterfly being the focus. It is a highly informative look at the film and many other films of its time. Also provided is an interview with actor Helmut Berger, who seems rather grumpy throughout the interview. Berger isn't the only person interviewed, as actress Ida Galli provides an in-depth look at her career and her part in The Bloodstained Butterfly. Rounding everything out is an enjoyable commentary with critics Alan Jones and Kim Newman, a career retrospective on director Duccio Tessari, trailers and finally, a photo gallery. Also packaged with the Blu-ray is a wonderful 36-page booklet on The Bloodstained Butterfly.

Verdict

One doesnt instantly think Giallo when they see a film that plays out like a Law & Order episode. However, The Bloodstained Butterfly manages to mix the traditional Giallo with a healthy dose of courtroom procedure. It may lack the over the top murder set pieces and the blood to go along with it, but it makes up for it with a mystery thats fun to see play out. Arrow Video tops off the high quality with a near-perfect Blu-ray release.",1472601600,,4505,4.8426527958387515
5647839,4,B00BMRMTJU,"I bought this movie simply because I collect Arrow releases of old horror movies, and I thought this was one of them.  As I waited for the movie to arrive and before I was able to watch it, I started reading the mediocre reviews and began regretting my purchase. The common theme was that this boring film was not a horror or slasher movie, and was not a good representation of the ""giallo"" genre:  a genre I had never heard of.  Well, I decided to watch it, and I am glad that I didn't let the reviews dissuade me.  This is a good movie. The audio and visuals are excellent.  The movie is artistic, intelligent, well-written, acted, directed, and edited. I have no idea if this is a good giallo movie, but it's a good mystery/crime thriller, and it is well worth watching, in my opinion. I like crime dramas, but I am not a die-hard fan, so I can't say how this one holds up in comparison to the best in that genre, but I think it's very good, and I liked this better than a lot of more modern crime/mystery thrillers that I've seen. I was worried this was going to be a generic 70s movie, but--although dated by the dress styles--this movie does not feel outdated. Highly recommended.",1472256000,10,1186,4.34841628959276
5647840,4,B00BMRMTJU,"Although it was produced at the height of Italy's giallo boom, 1971's The Bloodstained Butterfly is remarkable not so much for its similarities to popular titles of the time as for its differences.  With a focus on forensic science and courtroom drama, the film leans closer to Hitchcock's The Wrong Man than anything in Dario Argento's oeuvre.  And, even though it all leads up to a remarkable twist, there's a surprising lack of sex and violence:  two of the prime ingredients in the most memorable gialli.  But it's director Duccio Tessari's tendency to take the road less traveled that actually makes Butterfly a stand-out in a genre filled with films that were only too happy to follow in one another's footsteps.

Opening with a confusing series of title cards introducing the main characters, the film segues into its opening murder:  the brutal stabbing of a student whose body rolls into a crowded park.  Witnesses identify a local sports reporter,
Alessandro Marchi, as the guilty party and with an almost insurmountable amount of physical evidence, Marchi is quickly convicted of the crime.

And yet, several loose ends raise some doubt.  Marchi's family and attorney work on an appeal while his daughter convinces her new lover, Giorgio, to claim he saw a different man running away from the scene.  Just when all hope seems to be lost, two more murders, committed in the same fashion, occur while Marchi is behind bars.  Is he innocent...or is there a copycat killer on the loose?

The more familiar one is with the giallo formula, the more fun you'll have with The Bloodstained Butterfly.  While the film fails to deliver the expected show stopping murder sequences, it lays the groundwork for one of the most truly ingenious endings in the genre...and a logical one at that.  Tessari's emphasis on evidence gathering and new technology may seem a bit dated, but it's shot and edited in a unique newsgathering style that draws one in just the same.

The film ingeniously toys with your expectations right up until the final credits, using the character of Giorgio (Helmut Berger) - a common giallo suspect with a tortured past and taste for rough sex - as a decoy, diverting the audience's attention like a well rehearsed magic trick.  Butterfly demands some patience to be sure.  But just when you think it's dragged on the act too far, the finale sends you out smiling.

Arrow Video's special edition Blu-ray / DVD is as well rounded as they come, with a hi-def transfer worth the cash alone, and a healthy serving of extras.  Authors Alan Jones and Kim Newman are reunited again for the commentary track, with Jones often stopping just too admire the ""completeness"" of the version provided (apparently it was his first viewing!).  Troy Howarth contributes a great visual essay that breaks down the film's cast, crew and place in giallo history.  Actress Evelyn Stewart is interviewed in an hour-long featurette about her lengthy career and director Duccio Tessari's wife, Lorella De Luca (who also appears in the film) provides some insights about her husband.  Finally, Helmut Berger, who also introduces the film, is given his 15-minutes to weirdly wax poetic about his time on set.

There's more here  - including trailers, promotional images, a reversible cover and limited edition 36-page booklet - than most casual fans could ever ask for.  But giallo fans are rarely the casual sort.  And Arrow certainly has their number.",1471910400,,3446,4.949565217391305
5647841,3,B00BMRMTJU,"The Bloodstained Butterfly is one of the tamer entries among giallo  the  20th century Italian genre of film with mystery and often slasher, supernatural, horror, or crime fiction elements. The Bloodstained Butterfly combines giallo with courtroom drama. A young womans dead body is found in a park during a thunderstorm and Italys best detectives are assigned to the case. Newscaster Alessandro Marchi (Giancarlo Sbragia) is incriminated. Several eyewitnesses report having seen him fleeing the scene, his fingerprints are on the murder weapon, and theres mud on his coat that matches the mud in the park. Everything seems to fit neatly, but all is not as it appears.

With its emphasis on the police investigation and lengthy courtroom scenes, the film will remind viewers of TV lawyer series such as Perry Mason or Law and Order. Fans of giallo might be disappointed, however, in that the horror element is understated. Director Duccio Tessari uses some imaginative camera angles in the exterior scenes, but unlike other giallo films made around the same time, The Bloodstained Butterfly lacks a timeless quality and visually is very much a product of the early 1970s. The major drawback is the slow pace  far from the rapid editing modern movie viewers have come to expect.

There are a romantic subplot involving Alessandros daughter, Sarah (Wendy DOlive), and her boyfriend, Giorgio (Helmut Berger), a gifted, disturbed pianist with a dark secret; an intense sex scene; and references to hot-topic social issues of the period. The script is well constructed, with several plot twists and red herrings to keep the viewer off balance. The cinematography is impressive, particularly in its original widescreen format, and the soundtrack interpolates Tchaikovskys Concerto No. 1 with a more traditional score.

Bonus features on the 2-disc Blu-ray + DVD Special Edition include original Italian and English soundtracks, newly translated English subtitles for the Italian soundtrack, new audio commentary, visual essay on the film, new interview with actor Helmut Berger, interview with the actress/wife of director Duccio Tessari, Italian and English theatrical trailers, gallery of promotional images, and reversible sleeve containing original and newly commissioned artwork.",1471824000,3,2278,5.475783475783476
5647842,3,B00BMRMTJU,"This was made at the right time, and has Helmut Berger and Ida Galli (Evelyn Stewart) in the cast, but it never really catches fire or has the distinctive feel of a true giallo.  It is more like a police procedural that isn't very exciting.  I may be in the minority in this opinion, but having seen several dozen giallo from the time, I feel this one is a minor effort at best.  I'd recommend instead anything by Sergio Martino, Pupi Avanti, Mario Bava, or Polselli, or Ercoli, or Miraglia, etc.  In the end this just doesn't hold up when there are so many much more entertaining movies out there in the genre.  The Eyecatcher ""special uncut edition"" I got is a nice DVD -- but the best presentation in the world can't make this average movie any better.",1400889600,4,755,4.402877697841727

The so called rough love scene was confusing to me. Was he acting that way because the girl he loved was murdered or he just liked rough sex? I would love to interview Wendy d Olive. I have some seriously important questions to ask her! Question #1 what did Helmut smell like?, I bet he smelled fantastic. Question #2 Was he a good kisser because from my vantage point he was awesome. I love when he first starts kissing Wendy and his hair falls against her face, Sensory overload to the 10th degree!
