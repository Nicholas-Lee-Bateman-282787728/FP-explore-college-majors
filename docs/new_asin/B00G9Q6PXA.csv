8621507,5,B00G9Q6PXA,"With incredible, inspiring prose, poetry, music and imagery, Gungor continues to prove they are so much more than a band, but a creative force. I recommend for an Gungor fans, obviously, but also for any artist struggling to connect with God and their craft.",1399248000,,258,4.886363636363637
8621508,5,B00G9Q6PXA,"I discovered Gungor after reading a review from a music magazine.  Gungor is opposed to being slotted into the ""Christian Music"" genre, so I had not yet heard of him.  Curiosity got the best of me, so I purchased ""Beautiful"".  I was blown away.with the lyrics AND the music.  So I then purchased ""Ghosts Upon The Earth"" and asked for and received ""A Creation Liturgy"" for Christmas.  This DVD ""Let There Be"" is music from both ""Beautiful"" and ""Ghosts Upon the Earth"".  It is simply beautiful, set in different places, outdoor, indoor.  If you are a Gungor fan, you MUST have this.  If you've never heard of him, are a Christian and love to worship God, download ""A Creation Liturgy"", which is live performances of the other 2 CD's.  I think when Gungor was turned away by a priest when he wanted to become Catholic, God must have just shook his head at his arrogance.",1390780800,,867,4.541935483870968
