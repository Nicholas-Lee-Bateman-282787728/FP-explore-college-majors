This is the ONLY music video I never tire of watching.  I'm not crazy about the first video for ""Shut Up and Kiss Me"" (although I do like the song), but every other video here is first rate.  It seems rare to see a music video that actually adds to your love of one of your favorite songs.  However, this was the case for me for virtually every song on here.

A great performance of ""He Thinks He'll Keep Her"" (the only concert outtake on the tape).  The video for ""You Win Again"" is riveting... a very powerful video.  Her performance of ""This Shirt"" is beautiful... (I love that song!); ""I Feel Lucky"" is really funny; the videos for ""Passionate Kisses"" and ""Down at the Twist and Shout"" are just fun... together they make for a very entertaining tape.

A MUST HAVE for Mary Chapin Carpenter fans!!",1120348800,3,863,4.417721518987341

I like the video  for ""Passionate Kisses"" as it has a lot of scenes from around  Washington, D.C. and the quick takes keep you interested in watching it.
I think that you should probably buy this only if you have a MCC  collection of some sort.  The ordinary MCC fan probably has seen the videos  already and wouldn't need to buy this.  It just becomes dull after a few  viewings, even if you're trying to just see the ones you like.",957657600,2,636,4.190082644628099
