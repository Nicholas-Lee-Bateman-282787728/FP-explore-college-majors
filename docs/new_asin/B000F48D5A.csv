2551032,3,B000F48D5A,"Made for TV movies are just that, stuff that you would watch for free but you would never pay for.

The plot is simplistic.  Aly and AJ are brats (a repetitive disney theme).  Dad makes them work.  Dad goes on a mysterious trip.  While Dad is away, Dad's best friend robs the company, Aly and AJ cause all heck to break lose in the dairy plant - but true sisterhood triumphs over materialism and the desire for a hip prom dress.

The plot is simplistic, paint by numbers, and easy to anticipate.  The dramatic conflict is typical superficial disney materialism. One girl loyal to dad seeks paternalistically to save all those really cute working class people - the other girl seeks to be hip for the prom.  In the wider context of Disney material with these consistent superficial plots, its disappointing.  After a while you have to wonder what message is being sent to your children from disney.  According to disney, the height of teenage anxiety is a prom dress.  With the greater issues of life - which include the US working class and the widening gap between US corporate rich and the working poor - the disney theme disappoints.

This movie is a well done, made for TV movie.  Watch it for free. Dont buy it.  But while you are at it, read to your children ""Harvesting Hope: The Story of Cesar Chavez "" - and explore the real struggle of farm workers.",1157500800,6,1359,4.516393442622951
2551033,5,B000F48D5A,"The story of this movie was interesting.  I usually don't pay attention to the movie that is being played at dinner, but for multiple reasons, I was drawn to watch this.

Aly & AJ plays two daughters that works for their father's dairy company.  Something terrible happens, and the two daughters strive to help out to keep the business going.  There were also many micro problematic situations in the movie, just like in real life, that always kept the story dyanamic and interesting.

There's guy/girl problems, sister problems, business problems, suspected thievery theories, conspiracies, work/life/family matrix complexities, and the general class jealousy/conflicts.  There were probably others, but those are what I remember generally.

Overall, I loved the movie and there was actual thoughtful meaning in it.

This makes a perfect birthday gift for anyone!  As well as something for your own collection if you love Walt Disney movies OR just Aly & AJ!  :)",1151539200,17,963,5.194805194805195
2551034,5,B000F48D5A,"Sister singing sensations Aly & AJ make their DVD debut in the all-new, hilarious Disney Channel Original Movie -- COW BELLES, with an exclusive alternate ending. Super-spoiled rich girls Taylor and Courtney Callum have a lot to learn when their dad insists they take summer jobs at the family's dairy while he goes on a long-overdue vacation. While struggling to balance the pressures of popularity, crushes on totally cute boys, and the pain of really growing up, will these ""Cow Belles"" be able to save the family business and become better people in the process? Full of hip and hilarious adventure, this all-new DVD includes a cool behind-the-scenes featurette and two Aly & AJ music videos. So rustle up some friends and join the fun!",1151366400,7,740,4.928
2551035,4,B000F48D5A,"I liked this movie and Aly and AJ are GREAT actresses and singers and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THEM!!!!!!!! But............... even though this movie was good (and I don't mean this as a bad reveiw for the movie or ESCPECIALLY THEM) some of the  OTHER(not ALY & AJ) actors were really bad, and in 1 scene all the employees talk bad about Taylor and Courtney (Aly and AJ) but in real life, they would never say bad stuff to the boss's daughters, escpecially to their faces.  The reason for this note is only to notify you of some of the good and bad things in the movie, and I don't want to leave you thinking that I don't like Aly and AJ and that they are bad actresses and singers, because they are one of my favorite singers, and they are really good actresses.",1146355200,9,756,4.27972027972028

2551068,5,B000F48D5A,"I did enjoy this film.  Kind of a peak how kids that just sit back and have stuff given to them think, but then when they have to work for what they want they realize how hard it actually is.  Aly & AJ both start as spoiled brats.  But as the movie goes on and they see what actually happens when you have a job they start to appreciate it a lot more.  When Aly sells her car to get money for fresh milk I wasn't expecting that and it was good to see her character grow up a little bit.  AJ took a little longer to come around and mature but it was fun to watch.  Good film.",1341532800,,574,3.7815126050420167

2551070,3,B000F48D5A,"Anyone expecting a hard hitting look at the realities of life from a Disney Channel Movie is barking up the wrong tree. Yeah the plot and believable dialogue are lacking from Cowbelles, but there's nothing fundamentally offensive about this film. Aly and AJ Michaulka star as pampered sisters forced to work at their father's dairy to learn the value of a dollar. While he's out of town, Bob Fenwick the Dairy's accountant runs off to the Bahamas or something leaving the girls to salvage the family business. Of course everything ends happily with the girls having learned that there's more to life than money and appearances...yay! The film suffers from a bad script...there were no real surprises and the dialogue was really average at best...even the best actor would've been hamstrung in this movie.  Of course, if you have a 9-19 year old girl whose a huge fan of Aly and AJ, they probably won't notice the mediocrities.",1282262400,,926,4.860759493670886

2551074,1,B000F48D5A,"I usually like Disney movies. They are simple, colorful, delivers a good message and it is mindless TV for about an hour and a half. When I started watching Cow Girls, this is what I was expecting. The movie is about two girls who have to work at their father's dairy company and must soon save the company when things start to go wrong. The movie was awful; it had bad acting, bad, super super bad dialogue, clich scenes (but to the extreme) and it was just bad in general. Did anyone bother to call the police when the guy stole the money?!

My major issue with the movie is the dialogue, it was pathetic. Alyson and Amanda Michalka are not amazing actresses, but they are not that horrible. But, the script in this movie makes their acting horrible.
