3515857,5,B001CQS7M4,"This is a film that is carried by its 'too wonderously powerful to be fiction' story. While we in the US were focused on confronting the Soviet Union during the Cold War, the peoples of the subjugated Baltic and Slavic nations were struggling to maintain their national identities and cultures. Each nation has a tale to tell (Czechoslovakia's Velvet Revolution, Ukraine's Orange Revolution, Georgia's Rose Revolution) This film shows us how the people of Estonia sang their culture and nation through this ordeal. Although I agree with much of what the other reviewers have written regarding the technical filmaking aspects of this film (somewhat lacking in deep individual character development), I had to give ""The Singing Revolution"" five stars for the power of the story itself. See this film and revel in a triumph of true strength over opression!",1228435200,32,853,5.143884892086331
3515858,5,B001CQS7M4,"We miss things, we here in the most powerful nation on earth.  I was alive when Estonia was fighting for its independence only I wasn't paying attention.  Much of the world turned its back on this repressed nation.  The music is glorious and the people are inspiring.  ""The Singing Revolution"" proves that desire trumps death.  They were not powerful, but they sang their way to freedom, a revolution bought with breath not blood.  You will feel hopeful for the entire world after experiencing this film.  It made me proud, it made me cry, it made me think.  It reminded me that I should pay attention to the rest of the world.",1228089600,52,627,4.585585585585585
3515859,4,B001CQS7M4,"Yesterday afternoon I hadn't a clue about this film, and today I'm proud to say that I last night I learned a good deal about the Baltic situation that happened just a few years before I was born.

SPOILER WARNING: I will try and avoid the old ""this happened and then this happened"" method as much as I can, but some of my commentary may highlight weaknesses or strengths that will give the plot away, at least a little. Sorry in advance.

This documentary tells the story of Estonia's struggle for independence first from the Soviets, then from the Nazis, and then from the Soviets again. There is some bone-chilling imagery early on of the ways in which the Estonians have been persecuted, and in this way it conforms to documentary convention; the camerawork and editing are clean and modern and help the and scenes presented enhance the spoken narrative. I felt that this narrative was told in a ""campfire story"" fashion, meaning that the Soviet occupation of Estonia in the 70s is told by offering us a series of hard-hitting, related but independent stories on the subject, much like ghost stories at a campfire are all ghost stories but do pretty well on their own.

I bring up the storytelling methodology because it is, to me, the film's greatest weakness. The stories told are fascinating and have strong arcs unto themselves, but ultimately work against the major story arc as utilized by many successful documentaries. If each of the individual stories contained singing or were noticeably more important than another individual story, we may have been led (as in a national song) through rising action to an obligatory crescendo and denouement. As it stands, we see a long series of heart-rending mini-stories that ultimately make the film feel like it's covered a lot of ground but hasn't delved deeply into any of it, like a singer that holds a single piercing note for two hours.

Really, though, the stories presented are all very interesting and reveal some very tragic moments in Baltic history. This information, it seems, would have made a smashing miniseries but as a cohesive whole it becomes a grind to endure.",1225929600,6,2134,4.838356164383562

3515891,5,B001CQS7M4,"A very powerful and very moving film. Our choir in New Hampshire sang an Estonian song last semester, and I fell in love with the music. That's when I learned of the Estonian song festival where a choir of 20,000 or more sings to an audience of hundreds of thousands. The film takes my breath away. A peaceful revolution, of individuals inspired by love and freedom and song. It shows the power of hope against fear and a long history of oppression. As an American of the baby boomer generation, I too lived through these events, but was not as aware at the time. The film explains clearly the sequence of events leading to independence of the Baltic countries and the eventual collapse of the Soviet Union. These is a must see for EVERY high school student and adult worldwide. It makes me want to experience the Estonian song festival myself!

3515912,5,B001CQS7M4,"As a recent traveler to the Baltic Sea area, I had little knowledge of Estonia. When our tour guide took us to the Song Festival Ground  in Tallinn, he became so animated and emotional as he began to explain the significance of what historic event had occurred here in the late 1990's which became known as The Singing Revolution. His story of how singing -yes singing - caused a uniting force in the resistance to Soviet occupation was absolutely fascinating to me as a musician.  I asked the guide if there were any books or more information on this incredible story and he mentioned the DVD ""The Singing Revolution"". I ordered this as soon as I arrived home, and was utterly in awe for 90 minutes as this unknown piece of history unfolded.  By the end you are moved to tears by the strength and power, and yes, absolute beauty of this singing nation.

You would expect that they were talking about atrocities from the 18th or 19th centuries instead of just a few years ago.  Yes, this is an inspirational look at a country's enduring patriotism pivoting around a rich choral tradition.  But it is also a lesson in the nature of governments, even modern ones, to squash its people for the purpose of control.  Gen Y and Millenials take notice!

They marched with determination, faces grim but unafraid. And it reminded me at once of the amazing story of the people of Estonia and their resistance toward the Russian armies following the 1989 breakup of the Soviet Union. While surrounding small nations of Lithuania and Latvia exchanged fire and lost lives, the Estonians united, locking arms, and singing patriotic songs. And the Russians retreated.

The Singing Revolution is a true David and Goliath story that happened in recent memory and right under the noses of the world, yet it is one with which very few people are familiar.  The film was very well researched and documented.  It flows nicely as it tells the story of Estonian occupation and oppression, something shared by the people of many of the former republics of the Soviet Union, focusing on the desire for freedom without delving too deeply into the anti-Russian sentiment that some in Estonia possess.  The Singing Revolution will survive as an easily accessible historical record of the hardships the people of the Baltics, particularly Estonians, endured as they yearned for freedoms many people in the West take for granted each day.  Estonia is an amazing example of people coming together and accomplishing their goals through peaceful demonstration instead of violence.",1358467200,2,1105,5.185393258426966
3515980,5,B001CQS7M4,"This a definitely a film worth watching that truly shows the power of song and culture as a means to preserve the collective soul of a country's people through the worst of circumstances.

I toured the Baltics with my own American choir in 1995. I have photos of the song stage in Estonia, but we actually were in Riga, Latvia for their national song festival. I knew the history of Russian occupation, but not the degree to which these people were victims. I wish I had understood what I learned from this film. The nationalism was apparent, but I didn't appreciate the way music held the people together and protected their very identity. It is hard to describe the way it sounds and feels to hear over 20,000 voices raised in one song. There were so many people on the stage (which was more like the stands in a large stadium) that I couldn't capture the entire scene at once in a panorama photo. I could get in maybe 2/3-3/4 of them in one shot. This is an excellent documentary, but could not adequately depict the sheer volume of the joyful peaceful crowd...thousands singing and even more thousands as audience covering acres in front of the enormous ""stage"". I remember the colorful costumes, parades in the street (had never seen people march playing violins before), and we also attended a huge dance festival. After viewing this film, I have a much better understanding and appreciation of this experience.

The only thing I bought in Tallinn was a small antique book (1898) for 12 Kroons (equal to $1.00) that I thought was an Estonian Bible, but our guide told me it was a hymnal. How fitting, in retrospect.

The people in this film are heroic and beautiful individuals and the music is truly unique and sweet to the ear.",1357084800,3,1735,4.626623376623376
3515981,5,B001CQS7M4,"As an American patriot, I could not help but be moved by this film depicting the Estonian people singing their way through to a non-violent independence from the Soviet regime. The average American, through the active negligence of their public education system, has no idea how truly precious freedom is. I wonder if they would show the same courage to stand up and say no to government control like the Estonians did in the late 80's and early 90's, giving voice to their right to freedom and independence through peaceful protest and the power of their native song. If you are an American patriot like myself and you see this film, you will no doubt feel the way I do: extremely proud of the Estonian people for what they have accomplished.",1356307200,2,743,4.679389312977099

In 1991 Estonia confronted its Soviet occupiers and announced its independence to the world.  Music, not weapons, played a pivotal role in this event.  Not only are Estonians a singing people; they know how to use patience as a weapon.  Having lived under one occupation or another for many decades, they know how to watch and wait and act only when the time is right.  These qualities were learned in trying times: a high percentage of their population was murdered outright or sent to work camps in Siberia.  It is a privilege and inspiration to meet and hear the stories of those who led in the recovery of their country and to see and hear this people -- arms upraised and hands clasped -- singing.",1348617600,2,903,4.756410256410256

During those occupations, Estonia lost 25% of their population to assasination, torture and being sent to the Siberian Mines as slave labor.  This film does not dwell on the negative.

The Estonians had, for over 100 years, music festivals with 25,000 people onstage singing Estonian cultural songs.  It was a country of music, and a country that expressed themselves through the voice of music.  After the occupation, it was hard for them to continue their culture, so they remembered who they were through the music festivals held every five years, and through the revolutionary songs that were written and sung at those festivals.  From 1987 through 1992, they were able through non-violence to once again free their country and become an independent Estonia.

He took us not only to locations near Tallinn but also to a couple of resort towns on the Baltic.  And Voil!.  The Singing Revolution.  It completed the story that our guide had so vividly described us, and reacquainted us with so many things we had seen in Tallinn.

The Estonian people withstood no less than Stalin and Hitler as successive purges swept across and decimated their tiny country throughout world war II (and before) and they did it by continuing to sing their national songs at longstanding annual conventions. This may seem simple but in reality it tapped into tremendous reserves of strength by reminding Estonians who they were and that patience and endurance wins. One of the most powerful true pictures in history is the portrait of Estonians surrounding a hostile (Russian)mob at their single radio station and then opening a channel to permit the daunted Russians to escape -- all the while singing!

As a member of Plaid Cymru (The Party of Wales) I found the similarities between these two small countries interesting especially the music festival traditions as well as their problems with ""the people next door"". The murders, mass deportations and devastation happened earlier in Welsh history but the arrogant comments about the Estonians from the Russian colonists in this film are very similar to the views of the English.
I have two criticisms. One, the power of the Russian colonists is stronger than portrayed. Recently they kept the Estonians from pulling down a monument in Talinn to the Soviet soldiers of WWII. And the low birthrate in Estonia does not bode well for the future of the country.
Second, the comment that Estonians were drafted into German service or shot is greatly misleading. I'm sorry, but Estonians freely volunteered on a large scale for Estonian units serving in the German Army as well as SS Wiking Division. The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

3516041,4,B001CQS7M4,"This documentary about the eventual independence of embattled Estonia, one of the Baltic States that was for decades just a part of what was then known as the USSR, or Soviet Union, is extremely moving, not just due to the end result, but the means. Revolution through song? Absolutely. Mikhail Gorbachev, the last head of state of the USSR, and the only Soviet leader to have been born after the October Revolution of 1917, introduced the concept of ""glasnost"" that quickly, unintentionally opened the door to public displays of Estonian patriotism, including singing. The heart of this documentary consists of footage of the Estonian masses singing in the open air, combined with interviews with organizers, although this reviewer found the included collection of early newsreels well compiled as well, especially that of the Yalta Conference during which Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin decided the fate of postwar Europe (including the agreement to permit the ethnic cleansing of millions of Eastern European Germans of which this reviewer is a descendant). If only all freedom could be granted through peaceful demonstration! Despite one's worldview or Weltanschauung, how can anyone argue with the motives behind the masses of a people stripped of their identity and incorporated into a Socialist state, but still venturing to publicly proclaim ""Creator, Protect Estonia"" en masse?

Even for people who have never heard of Estonia, never knew of the Estonians' struggle for independence, this is a documentary that will keep you tied to your seats in awe of what unfolds. There is something almost hypnotizing watching an entire country not resort to violence but to singing to gain its independence.

When the events culminate in the Russians invading the country with tanks and just 2 Estonian policemen are left at the country's radio tower to defend it, the tension grips the viewer, it is that intense. What a documentary. Beautifully, beautifully made!",1257811200,4,918,5.032894736842105

This is a concise overview of Estonians' struggle to regain their independence during the gruesome years of Soviet occupation. It is a fascinating look into how the preservation of national identity, language and traditions(here a singing tradition) became a spearhead for a powerful civil resistance that became one of the keys to breaking down the monster that was the Soviet empire.
It is a gripping story for anyone, not just those who know the history of Estonia. For those less familiar with the subject, it is an eye-opening and inspiring account of what a small nation can achieve, against all odds. It makes you think if a similar model could be used in other countries suffering from opressive regimes.
I so thoroughly enjoyed it that I will buy it for all my friends as Christmas gifts. This movie should be more widely known. You will not be unmoved!",1254009600,4,932,4.905063291139241

This is really a story about a battle over a scrap of land.  It is being played out violently all over the world.  Those living on the land are torn in two, sometimes literally.  These people fought back with music. It is the kind of story that gives you a lump in your throat and reminds you what it means to be human.  I watched this DVD, The Singing Revolution, with my 18 year old son, just home from College.  I was delighted I was able to share this experience with him.

3516060,4,B001CQS7M4,"Few nations suffered as much under the Soviets, proportionately, as Estonia. After a hard won independence in 1920, followed by almost two decades of freedom, the year 1939 and the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact brought a massive Soviet invasion, executions, deportations, denunciations and arrests. Then, in 1941, the Nazis took their turn. In 1944, the Soviets returned, initiating a post-war policy of Russian colonization of the tiny republic.

Through it all, this documentary shows, Estonians had their music, and the power of song played a crucial role in sustaining and expressing their national unity. It was even more significant in helping make the inevitable 1991 revolution more peaceful than it well could have been.

There is no suspense in this documentary - the outcome is well known. But the personal stories of the participants, of those who resisted decades of national repression, who survived the camps, who fought occupation from the forests, make this film a marvel.

I wonder how many people know that the Soviet Union was anything but a big happy family? That the Baltic nations (and many more...) were held captive behind the Iron Curtain against their free will? That there was genocide going on and the outside world had no idea?! Makes me wonder about Cuba, China and other places like that today...
I enjoyed the movie from the very beginning until the very end, but there were 3 scenes that were exceptionally powerful:
1) The 2 Estonian policemen (these guys had some balls!!) protecting the TV tower inside while unarmed locals with linked arms were standing guard outside against the approaching tanks and massive numbers of Soviet soldiers.
2) Over a million people creating a human chain through Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania by joining hands.
3) The scene where the average (unarmed, of course) Estonians went to protect their Parliament building from hordes of hostile Russians - and after surrounding them, peacefully parting ways to let the enemies go through. That sight was just so... CIVILIZED that it was almost surreal!

5)...
I could keep on going but I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it yet. (Oh, I cannot help myself, just one last thing - the scenes where 30,000 people were singing together! UNREAL!!! And the music is beautiful.)

8288736,5,B001CQS7M4,"I was an American ex-pat living in Helsinki, Finland, during the seventies.  When the Soviets first allowed ferry service to begin between Estonia and Finland in 1980, I and my Finnish wife joined another Finnish couple for a 3-day visit to Tallinn.  Upon arrival, we took a taxi to a home in a nearby neighborhood, where we first met and were warmly welcomed by a lovely Estonian couple, who were acquaintances of our Finnish friends.

  I can still remember how shocked I was at the deprivation and scarcity that I witnessed during this short visit, and how gracious our new Estonian friends were, despite their obvious hardships and relative poverty.  At the time, I couldn't help but be amazed by how much the Estonian populace resembled the Finns I knew (the languages sound almost the same to the untrained ear), both in appearance and demeanor.  Witnessing these striking similarities first-hand, I couldn't help but feel an almost overwhelming sense of sadness at the obvious oppression and lack of freedoms which had been foisted upon them by their Soviet overlords (the almost omnipresent Soviet soldiers which seemed to be on every street back then certainly added to the doom and gloom of the situation); it's also why I felt both relief and guilt when we were able to eventually depart on the ferry back to the beauty --and freedom-- of modern Helsinki.

  That's why this film meant so much to me.  The filmmakers have done an outstanding job of capturing the incredible patience, courage, and resilience shown by the Estonian people before and during their Singing Revolution back in 1989-91.  And, as this year is the 25th Anniversary of Estonian Re-Independence, it was gratifying to see how much, how far, and how fast the development of today's modern-day Estonian economy and society has progressed over such a relatively short period of time.",1481587200,4,1863,4.954983922829582
