8239122,5,B0010X746E,Great video on extreme tornadoes.  It's not a British show -- just a British narrator for a National Geographic program. Fun show to watch.,1235001600,,139,4.791666666666667
8239123,1,B0010X746E,"The Tornado is the still-impressive fighter bomber of the UK, Germany, Italy and Saudi-Arabia. Since it has seen actionin various theatres, this documentation promised to be interesting. Unfortunately, the video material has been compiled in such an unprofessional manner that this product is not worth the money and the time:
The pictures are blurred and stretched, since original video material (4:3 Ratio) was stretched to 16:9, downsized to fit 4:3 DVD format again and a black bar added on top and below.

I feel sorry for the original authors of this doc since the content is OK.",1212537600,3,585,5.030927835051546
