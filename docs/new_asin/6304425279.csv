I'm 99% sure the DVD was copied from a bad old VHS with no improvements at all. It is horribly dark. I can't review ""Shriek in the Night""  because it's unwatchable. You can watch ""Dark Shadow"" if you're patient; it's very good, with Dirk Bogarde excellent as always. What a wonderful actor! It's worth putting up with this wretched production to see one of his more obscure performances. Only for this reason can I give it a 3;otherwise, a 1 is all it deserves. Shame on Madacy!

I can't recommend this set. Hopefully someone will restore ""Dark Shadow"" so it can be enjoyed by all.",1297296000,,710,4.404580152671755
