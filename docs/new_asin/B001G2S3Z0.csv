3595568,5,B001G2S3Z0,My five year old loves this video.  We own both the Jungle Fury tapes and he watches them all the time.  The video is 135 minutes long which is over 2 hours.  They are a bundh of episodes back to back that take you through the fights with the Dai Shi.,1231718400,5,251,3.8823529411764706

8303743,5,B001G2S3Z0,My daughter loves Power Rangers and I couldn't believe how much these things cost! But it was well worth it!,1358726400,,108,4.45
8303744,4,B001G2S3Z0,"This DVD was delivered on time- about the middle of the 'expected delivery' dates. It was a good value for the price, and even with shipping, it was MUCH cheaper than going to a store. Speaking of stores, I ordered this over a year ago, and this item, although recently released, was no longer stocked in ANY store. Amazon was a total lifesaver here!",1324339200,,350,4.484375
8303745,5,B001G2S3Z0,"First off I bought this because its always better to entertain the kids over the holidays with something that has action but parents can deal with as well. The price of a used dvd is a lot, but this one more than earned its babysitting money.
The acting and storyline is a lot better than what i remember from the original power rangers, and I found myself watching it as well. Like all other made for kids tv shows, the plot is weak, but still serves to keep your, ahem, your kids attention. The only downside is there were only two dvds released in the US, but hopefully Disney will eventually release them here. Soon.
There are no special features, but that's fine. There are six episodes on this disk - all about 20 minutes each.
Overall this is a great series in the Power Rangers saga, and like it or not everyone remembers watching at least one episode of the original one.",1324166400,,880,4.404907975460123

8303747,4,B001G2S3Z0,My boys 5 and 2 love this DVD. The only downside is that there are only two DVD's for Jungle Fury. Why? They want more DVDs but I can't seem to find anymore. :(,1262044800,3,160,3.735294117647059
