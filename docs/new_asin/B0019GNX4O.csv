3437166,5,B0019GNX4O,really hope this series continues . . . down to earth writing and great acting.,1219190400,2,79,4.333333333333333
3437167,2,B0019GNX4O,"OK, I'm really sorry Jimmy left the series and Tom is hard to get used to. It takes about 4-5 episodes for the characters to gel and get back into a groove. Like the Homicide, Sopranos, NCSI, South Park, and Arrested Development network interference can really screw up a good thing. It seems the shelf live of a good series is about 5 seasons max then the networks start ""tinkering"" with it and just run it into the ground. I hope LV can survive the cast change and uncomfortable story lines. LV used to be a fun action series with lots of T&A, a formula that's worked since the original Charlie's Angles, let it go.",1219190400,,617,4.373913043478261
3437168,5,B0019GNX4O,"I like this show very much. I already own the previous 4 seasons.
I think the fith season is not as good as the one befoer, but it is still
fascinating.",1218931200,2,152,3.935483870967742
3437169,5,B0019GNX4O,"This show is one of my favorite shows on tv and i to feel that NBC didn't respect its loyal fans to the show, by not given us the final episode of this great show it just tells me they don't care what we think. But all and all the show was still good. After good old James Cann left, Tom selleck did a good job coming in having to fill big shoes. All the characters cont. to portray there characters to the fullist. I do hope NBC does release the finally episode to its fans just so we can have some closure to the show. Buy this movies to show NBC that they made a big mistake by taking the plug off this great show.",1218499200,3,617,3.9047619047619047
3437170,5,B0019GNX4O,"I must admit I was hesitant on the idea of ED leaving the show, because no one want change of characters in their favorite show, But magnum PI played a great role. I really enjoy his character. The way he came in and broke the trend of the stereotypes the cast and crew had of him. I am really looking foward to season 6. This season left me wanting for more. It is a great buy, good story lines, I can actually watch this season again not just put it up for sell on e-bay this one is a keeper.",1218412800,3,494,3.95
3437171,5,B0019GNX4O,"I really struggled with this season.  It certainly was not the same without James Caan (Ed Deline). Indeed, even without Nikki Cox (Mary Connell) and Cheryl Ladd (Jillian Deline) make the show different.  But these changes, and the addition of Tom Selleck (AJ Cooper) and Camille Guaty (Piper Nielsen) lend an aura of reality to the show, because people do move on.

As the season comes to its abrupt end, and Jillian returns for what ultimately turns out to be the last episode, it really is a reminder of what a great show this was, and how we saw the main cast develop and grow up over the last five years.  The most upsetting part though is in the end when the screen goes black and say ""To Be Continued"", only you know that will never happen because NBC did not respect its fans enough to even let them finish that last episode.  Despite this ending that will make you sad, and angry at NBC, you get to look back on the series and realize that this went from some taudry drama when it began and grew into a really special television series.",1218067200,60,1045,4.393782383419689
3437172,5,B0019GNX4O,"Although entitled to their own opinion, Las Vegas - Season 5, doesn't suck at all. If anything, it was a step headed in the right direction until NBC pulled the plug. To make matters worse, it was done without resolving the season ending cliffhanger. The whole season was classic ""Las Vegas"". True fans of the show understood the ""escapism"" of the show. The chemistry between the characters and everything ""electric"" that the city of Las Vegas stands for. Plus, I really enjoyed the additions of Cooper and Piper. I thought the chemistry between Piper and Mike was fantastic! I think the charcters of Delinda and Danny truly became a married couple for life during this season. I think fans would've liked to see them as first time parents. It almost makes you wonder had the series been picked up fpr a sixth season, would Ed Deline make an appearance to meet his new grandchild? I just wish there was a way to resolve the storylines for the sake of the fans. Finally, as Sam, nobody worked any better than Vanessa Marcil. Great actress, great role!",1217894400,10,1050,4.681081081081081
3437173,1,B0019GNX4O,"I've been a big fan of the series and own the first four seasons.

But this season just plain sucked.  The scripts were lackluster, many of the scenes seemed phoned in and many episodes just were not up to previous seasons.  The show did a slow fizzle.

And that's a real shame. We lost a greatcasino owner in James Caan. Tom Selleck should have been a great replacement but his character just didn't jell like it should have but the storyines just didn't shine. And it seemed that all the fun and cheekiness was drained out of the series.

What happened to the writers?

I'll not be buying this season. For those die-hard fans who liked the season -- fine. But for those who didn't catch the episodes and are discriminating -- unless you just have to have it, I'd recommend to chose another series.  I was very disappointed and really regret the wasted talent of this last (not a surprise) season.",1217548800,4,898,4.506172839506172
3437174,4,B0019GNX4O,"I love the show, I bought all five seasons and I always thought it exceptionally well cast, performed, cut and directed. So I could not wait to see the fifth season, since the fourth ended with such a cliffhanger. Alas, I was rather disappointed to find out that one of my favourite characters had quit. James Caan, who was the soul and key player of it all. Although I must admit that Tom Selleck does a wonderful job, but still, he's no James Caan. I sure don't miss the character of Nikki Cox. However what I think is appalling to all viewers: they leave us with another cliffhanger in this season and THEY AXED THE SHOW?????!!!!! How are we ever going to find out, what happens to Delinda's Baby or all the weddings, does Ed Deline reconcoile with his wife? How did Cooper survive? What will become of the Montecito? Questions and more questions and - alas - no answers. What a shame!",1217116800,37,888,4.45398773006135
3437175,4,B0019GNX4O,"I've always loved this series.  It's silly yet fun and enjoyable and light too but somehow addictive.  I've watched it from the start and find it still good to this day, but different with the cast changes.
In this season, we see Tom Selleck join the team as the new owner of the Montecito, AJ Cooper.  Danny and Dalinda find out that they're having a baby, and he becomes the President of the Montecito.  Piper and Mike wake up one morning finding themselves married (which they keep secret) and when the wedding is out in the open, Mike puts together another wedding for the sake of his mother which prompts Danny to properly propose to Dalinda.
It certainly isn't the best season in it's five year run, but it's still good if you are a true fan of the show.  I really love episode 12 called I Could Eat A Horse where Danny and Mike are sent to Wyoming to buy a horse for Coopers ranch and also It's Not Easy Being Green where Dalinda is obsessed with becoming environmentally friendly.
If you've also watched Las Vegas from the very beginning, you'll probably still like this but may find this isn't it's finest work.  There are still plenty of laughs and of course there's Mike and Danny who provide a lot of eye candy for us girls.  I still enjoy it and hope that all Las Vegas fans will as well.",1214870400,33,1301,4.373443983402489

I got season 5 First then went to season 1, so my prospective is abit different. I First saw the serie with Tom Selleck and thought, ""not bad"". I really enjoyed season 5 and it really had alot of new potential to develope. The last episode tho is a joke! Knowing the series was to be cancelled, you'd think NBC wouild have allowed one more episode to be filmed or an extra 30 mins added to the final. But to be leading up to such drama and to end the entire show with...to be continued...  COME ON!  I was pi$$#Ed off!  I cant recall any show getting such a raw deal after 5 seasons, maybe there has been, but what a complete joke!
Anyhow...then I went to season 1 and saw the great chemistry with James Caan and the Ice Queen and so on. The show was better the first 4 season, but season 5 wasn't bad either. Season 6 wouda been great...oh well.",1281830400,2,949,4.091397849462366

3437258,2,B0019GNX4O,"~~ Watching Season 5 of Las Vegas is just about as interesting as watching paint dry.
Did someone not notice that Cooper as a ""mystery man"" looked exactly like a dull guy in an undertaker's suit smoking cigars, bowling, and schlepping around?  The crime hijinks used to be a little fun to watch, but that part of the show has faded into the background, with the bland and the more bland taking center stage.
~~ Nonetheless, James Lesure keeps his superb Mike Cannon character watchable throughout.  And Vanessa Marcil works valiantly towards not letting the intrepid Sam Marquez be sucked into the stupid woman syndrome into which she is being drawn. Oh, and Polly!  Always so very tacky and always so very funny.
~~ It was good to be spared another round of the endlessly pitiful Mary Connell and the insipid Jillian Deline.  But if Ed Deline went away, why couldn't daddy's precious pregnant girl go with him?  This would have left a statistical possibility of the show having another female character with an IQ above room temperature.  But then again ... IQ ... well ... never meant to be what this show was about. It is more about silicon, Botox, and collagen.  I've nothing against ""procedures"", but is there no point at which it is identified as deformity rather than enhancement?
~~ People tend to beat up on writers for shows like this, but I work in the corporate world ... truly, it all flows downhill.  So who knows where to point an accusing finger?  I suspect further up the food chain.",1263081600,,1500,4.673003802281369

However, if you are purchasing this DVD, mainly because you were a huge fan of this TV series, then you will be greatly disappointed. Once Jimmy Caan left this TV series, the show just totally crapped out. The writers must have still been on strike when the scripts were written for Season FIVE. An 8-year kid could have come up with better ideas for the plots of each episode. Tom Selleck was such a great actor in Magnum PI, but he just didn't have the same flare that his predecessor Cann had as the head of the Montecito. It is so very sad to see such a great TV series bite the bitter dust of the Las Vegas desert as hard as this one did. My wife and I still miss this show each and every week. Thank goodness though for the reruns of Las Vegas on the TNT Network. I truly wish that I could give this one higher marks, but I'm just being totally honest with my own personal remarks. Sorry guys!",1227916800,8,1008,4.25

I thought that I'd not like Las Vegas as much when James Caan left. I was wrong. Of course, it is different -- but different does not automatically mean bad.

Tom Selleck came in and filled Mr. Caan's absense admirably, while developing his own unique character that I, for one, was just getting to know by the end of the series.

But be warned... the season ends in a cliffhanger, and in their Infinite Wisdom, the Powers That Be have decided that that's it, no more, the end. The series has been cancelled, as far as I know with no plans to even resolve the ending. Just a warning to anyone for who this will cause high blood pressure levels and migrains.",1227484800,,701,4.33587786259542

Hell, they're so un-loyal to the fans that they ended it with a cliffhanger. Sure I Tivo Crusoe on Friday nights but the show doesn't entertain me as much as Las Vegas used to. I actually looked forward to watching tv on Fridays due to this show. The show isn't as good this season, yet it still had a lot of energy and steam left.

  I did miss James Caan and he was barely even mentioned after leaving, even by the woman who plays his daughter. That didn't even ruin the series for me though. Vanessa Marcil was always incredibly hot as Sam and I don't even want to ever see her play any other character, I just want to see more of her in the role. Nikki Cox was cute in the other seasons but she got a little too whiny after awhile. Camille Guaty was a good replacement for her this season. She was super cute and after awhile it just felt like she was always on the show. I also think that Tom Selleck was a great replacement for James Caan and it's shame that the show was canceled during his first season. So it doesn't make sense that they canceled the show, it still had a lot of life in it. Plus I'm pissed that they ended it without us knowing if Danny's g/f lost the baby or not, what a dumb time to cancel it!",1226966400,2,1340,4.049056603773585

LOL) It is just a completely different world full of fine dining, wonderful concerts, and fabulous hotels. I'm not a big gambler at all - in spite of the George Clooney incident, LOL, but it is a wonderful place to escape from it all.  Las Vegas (the series) is a great escape as well!

I personally think that only Tom Selleck could have pulled this off after James Caan left - but was rather disappointed that they didn't develop his character more. He never seemed to have that many speaking lines if you'll notice.

I couldn't BELIEVE that after investing 5 years in this show and owning all the DVDs, that the network would just leave everyone HANGING with such an ending. I have heard that the show was outrageously expensive, but can't believe that some network like HBO won't pick it up??  And they wonder why no one watches TV anymore??  It seems as though inane reality shows are less expensive to produce!
