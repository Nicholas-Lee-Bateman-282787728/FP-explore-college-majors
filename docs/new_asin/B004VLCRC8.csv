8443499,5,B004VLCRC8,"In 2001 the BBC brought together many familiar faces for this first (of three) series about two undercover cops.  Led by Stephen Tompkinson (Ballykissangel, Wild at Heart) and Nick Berry (Heartbeat, Eastenders) the cast included Hugh Quarshire (Holby City, Star Wars), Lisa Maxwell (The Bill), Meera Syal (Kumars At No. 42) and Jake Wood (Eastenders.)  The 3 two-part episodes involve our flawed heroes 'infiltrating the criminal underworld of police corruption, paedophile networks and supremacist groups' as well as giving some insight into their private lives.  The added programme length allows the stories to be a bit more complex than normal; there are explosions and car chases for those who enjoy that sort of thing.  There are no subtitles but the accents aren't difficult to understand.  All three of these series are excellent; it's a shame they're not better known.",1440115200,,877,5.280575539568345
