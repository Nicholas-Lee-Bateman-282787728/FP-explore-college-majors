730329,5,6303934757,"This 1932 version of A FAREWELL TO ARMS was one which Hemingway very vociferously hated. From his perspective, since it placed the romance between Frederick Henry and Catherine Barkley over his depiction of the  brutality of war, he was right. However, director Frank Borzage was after  something else -- a luscious, doomed wartime romance. And in this, he  succeeds, brilliantly. Aided in no small part by the beautiful teaming of  Gary Cooper and Helen Hayes. Hemingway later became very good friends with  Cooper, whom he hand-picked to star in FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS. They were  in the process of forming a company to make ACROSS THE RIVER AND INTO THE  TREES and THE NICK ADAMS STORIES -- Cooper to topline both -- when they  died a mere seven weeks apart in 1961.",955152000,18,770,4.7368421052631575

There were two famous battles in the First World War: The Marne and The Piave. It begins with Red Cross trucks carrying wounded soldiers into town. Troops are marching toward the front lines. The hospital has two wings: one for English, one for Italians. One nurse is being sent away in disgrace. Miss Barkley is the most beautiful of the English nurses. Explosions interrupt the night! The air raid ends. There is a party. Lt Henry meets Misses Barkley and Ferguson. A man sings opera songs. This American joined the Ambulance Corps. Miss Barkleys boyfriend was killed on the Somme. They talk. Can they get along? Ambulances are sent to the river Piave, the front line against the Austrians. [Note the right-hand drive trucks. Does that hospital look like a former palace?] Lt. Henry speaks to Nurse Barkley. Be careful, she says. She gives him a Saint Anthony medal for luck.

Higher-ups send Nurse Barkely to Milan to separate them. Explosions tell they are in the front lines. Is it a Skoda gun? Lt. Henry is wounded in the line of duty. He is sent to the Milano hospital, then meets Nurse Barkley. Lt. Henry has a fever! A priest blessed them. Get well soon. Will they marry soon? Or argue and fight? The head nurse cancels his convalescent leave and sends him back to the front. The train whistle calls for departure. I always come back. Miss Barkley leaves for Switzerland and rents a suite. The letter to Lt. Henry is censurata and returned to sender. Frederick wants to go to Milano to search for Catherine. The battles continue. Soldiers are wounded or killed. There are explosions and air attacks. Soldiers retreat. The police search for stragglers; they either return to the front or are shot. Lt. Henry learns about Catherines departure. He wants to find her and places an advertisement in a newspaper.

But another reads this personal advertisement. Was Lt. Henry shell-shocked and lost his memory? If he returns he will be a hero. But he wont! If he is arrested he will be shot. Henry goes to Brissago Switzerland. Catherines letters are returned to sender. Frederick will to Switzerland over the lake. Ciao. Catherine goes to the hospital, she is ill. Frederick learns of her condition. On November 4 the Austrian-Hungarian Supreme Command accepted the Armistice conditions; the war is over. Frederick meets Catherine again. Im fine she says. Ill never stop loving you he says. Well never be parted she says. Im not afraid she says, then falls asleep. Ringing bells tell of peace. What is the future for Frederick?

You wonder which of Ernest Hemingways past experiences contributed to this story? [Was Love Story inspired by Hemingways novel?] How many other stories echoed its plot? Are there any legends from classical times that are similar? The movie does not tell about Catherines and Fredericks past, the reasons why they volunteered for the Medical Services. An American could not join a foreign army as this would cancel his citizenship. The French Foreign Legion did not require its volunteers to swear allegiance to France. The Americans who fought for France did so as members of the Foreign Legion (the Lafayette Escadrille).",1448236800,,3204,4.862637362637362

730507,3,6303934757,"The Blu-ray transfer is quite good given that it's a 1932 film at the beginning of the sound era (the audio fidelity and sound effects reflect this). Limited special effects also show the film's era and age. It exhibits some of the high melodrama and overacting found in nearly all the early talking movies, a vestige of the silent era and intertitles, which took nearly a decade to evolve into more natural acting relying on dialog delivery for emotive expression. It's fortunate the source material for the Blu-ray was in very good condition.

Set during WWI, Gary Cooper plays an American, Frederic Henry, who is a lieutenant in the Italian Army's ambulance corps and has a section of several ambulances ferrying wounded from the front lines to the field hospital in a rear area (Italy was allied with Serbia, Russia, France, Britain, Belgium, the USA and others in WWI). While delivering wounded to the hospital he meets a British nurse, Catherine Barkley, played by  a very young Helen Hayes, whose fiance had been killed earlier in the war, and begins an illicit love affair with her. Fraternizing with the nurses is forbidden by regulations. The film focuses on their love and devotion to each other, and the effect the war has on both, with a tragic ending.

It's important to note that Hemingway's novel from which the film's screenplay was written, A Farewell to Arms, was his first best-selling novel propelling him to fame, and was published in 1929. That's a novel being widely read only a couple years before the film adaptation's theatrical release. Screenplay and pre-production work had to have begun barely a year after the novel's publication, if that long. The basic problems with the film are not with Cooper's or Hayes' performances in a 1932 film. The basic flaws, with a run time of only 85 minutes, are its conflated screenplay and abridged scenes that skip too quickly through and gloss over dramatic episodes that are substantially more detailed in the novel. The result, compared to the novel, is much greater emphasis on the seduction and romance between Henry and Barkley, and very little on Henry's traumatic hardships with the horrors of the war bearing down on him with increasing weight and growing cynicism. The movie should have been substantially longer, as the war's horrors and Henry's experiences in the war are what propel his romance and love with Barkley. The absence of that being told in the film weakens the power of their love story and undermines the desperation with which they cling to each other.

I've come to the conclusion the studio, screenplay writers, producer and director presumed the audience had either read the novel, or were very familiar with its content, allowing them to severely abridge much of the drama. That may have worked with a best-selling novel published in 1929 and moviegoers seeing the film adaptation of it in 1932, but it makes viewing and fully understanding the film more difficult today for anyone who has not read the novel. Some of the scenes are so abridged as to make them potentially confusing. It is a story about the love and devotion, but it needs the horrors of the war going on around them to propel it. A movie that could have had the contemporary power of All Quiet on the Western Front ends up being flawed from its age and a general lack of knowledge about the novel's details today. Recommendation: read the novel or at least become very familiar with it before seeing the movie.

730605,4,6303934757,"Watched it streaming via Amazon Prime ...

For the period (1932) it has some pretty risque elements.  One also must remember that this was only 14 years after the end of WWI, so the war and its aftermath/impact were still very much a part of life.  The portrayal of the war is fairly realistic, rather than the white-washed romanticized portrayal we often see from the period.

Seeing Gary Cooper and Helen Hayes as ""fresh faced new comers to Hollywood"" is alone worth the price of admission.  You can certainly see here why they later tapped Cooper for the role of Alvin York.

Without giving away any spoilers ... one must forgive the screen writers and the director for the somewhat cheesy, oh-so typical 1930s movie ending.  It was simply the way movies were done back then.  Were the ending done like that today, it would be a satirical masterpiece and have the audience rolling in the aisles laughing.  (Try to watch ""Zero Hour"" -- the film on which ""Airplane"" was based -- with a straight face, and you'll see what I mean.  It's just the way they made 'em back then.)

Go into this movie as if you're about to enter a time capsule; leave your expectations of a ""modern"" movie at the door, enjoy it for what it is and appreciate this glimpse into post-WWI culture and cinema.",1420675200,,1281,4.550218340611353

""Disaster as well as victory is written for every nation on the record of the World Ware, but high on the rolls of glory two names are inscribed  -- --
The Marne and the Piave.""

This is a real tearjerker in black and white. However, it is well made and the story keeps movie. We can even feel sorry for the misguided friendship of Major Rinaldi, which contributed greatly to the disaster in the story.

I was really struck by seeing the young Helen Hayes as the first time I saw her was on Airport (1970.)

730791,5,6303934757,"First off, I want to make clear that, despite what the Amazon product description for this DVD presently (on 2/27/13) indicates, this movie, in this DVD release, is 89 mins. in length, not 80. I notified Amazon of the error a short while ago, so hopefully the correction will be reflected soon.

Secondly, I wish to COMPLETELY disagree with the product review posted by BAILADORA FINA on 1/7/13. I own a KINO DVD of ""A Farewell to Arms"". KINO released this movie as a new HD master, NOT as a restoration. Master means a best-possible straight HD reproduction from the best available picture and audio elements. A restoration, on the other hand, is when imperfections in picture and sound are corrected, as well as is reasonably possible.

As a new HD master, I consider this KINO DVD to be excellent, with overall clear, clean picture and sound, and with nicely balanced greyscale contrast.

I realize there is a conspicuous editing jump in one place, that makes it clear some footage was snipped out at some long-ago point. (You can tell as the scene begins with Catherine's mouth finishing moving from saying something before her continuing dialog begins.) Also, there are some inconsequential instances, throughout the film, where a fraction-of-a-split-second frame or two missing is just barely evident. Those issues reflect the form the reproduced old original film copy is in. As KINO's release is a new straight HD master ""from an original nitrate 35mm print, preserved by the George Eastman House Motion Picture Department,"" we're getting the best possible as-is reproduction of THAT copy. The KINO DVD offers clear, well-balanced, flutter-free, entirely agreeable image and sound quality, that I, for one, am fully satisfied with.

This is an 80 year old movie (most of what I especially enjoy watching, and collecting, where movies are concerned, is Silent through Pre-Code movies, of which I own dozens of such on typically expensive DVD releases [Criterion, KINO, TCM Archives, Warner Archive, MGM Premiere, etc.], and I have high, but realistic, standards and expectations regarding reproduction quality, and this release compares favourably, and very nicely, with other excellent new straight digital masterings I have of movies of similar vintage). I find BAILADORA's review to not at all accurately represent the fine quality of this DVD. The KINO release easily offers the best digital reproduction, on DVD, of this movie currently available. No way can it be accurately said that this DVD's ""visuals are...substandard and so is the sound."" I heartily disagree with that mystifying statement by BAILADORA. For an 80 year old movie that hasn't had any restoration work done to it (that's in overall great condition, regardless), this DVD offers excellent reproduction quality, with no significant shortcomings regarding either picture or sound. Yes: There are some slight visual imperfections, here and there, regarding minor specks, scratches, upper-right-corner reel-change indicator flashes, and that type of thing, but nothing that at all intrudes upon or detracts from the viewing experience; it's the usual type visual issues that any well-seasoned frequent viewer of Pre-Code era movies knows routinely comes with the territory (except with movies that have gotten actual restorations and had those type issues eliminated or minimized). I think the job KINO has done creating the beautiful new HD digital master is commendable, and that it'll satisfy and please anyone wanting to own a high quality, easy to view and hear copy of the movie.

It appears to me that this is the very copy of ""A Farewell to Arms"" that TCM airs, as, to my eyes and ears, everything looked and sounded identical when I recently viewed the movie on TCM, then viewed it again, less than a week later, via my KINO DVD, and was unable to observe any differences whatsoever.",1361923200,13,3870,5.156050955414012
730792,1,6303934757,"Last week I gave away an Electrolux  vacuum cleaner.  It was purchased by my mother in New Jersey in 1968.  It cleaned our homes in New Jersey and Florida for 15 years, and it is still functioning perfectly.  I only gave it away because today's lightweight vacs are much easier to tote.  I tell this story because there was a time in this country when companies took pride in their products and ripping consumers off was unheard of, or at the very least, it seldom occurred.  But the years have passed and companies don't care about quality anymore.  Now it's all about getting top dollar for inferior products that promise you everything and deliver nothing.  Such is the case with Kino's The Selznick Collection.  All five films in this boxed set claim the following:  MASTERED IN HD FROM AN ORIGINAL NITRATE 35MM PRINT PRESERVED BY THE GEORGE EASTMAN HOUSE MOTION PICTURE DEPARTMENT.  If this is actually true I am willing to eat all five DVDs and then the cardboard box itself.  All five films are of substandard quality, some of them so awful that they are barely viewable.  The most disastrous of them all is BIRD OF PARADISE, with the lovely Dolores del Rio, which is not only marred by visuals worthy of bad public domain piracy but is also afflicted with a distortion of its soundtrack from the very beginning of the film, making the dialog unintelligible, to say nothing about Max Steiner's fabulous score, which is distorted beyond recognition.  I have seen public domain copies of this film which are superior to this absolute merde Kino claims came from an original nitrate negative.  Sound and image problems plague all five releases.  The two Technicolor classics, A STAR IS BORN and NOTHING SACRED suffer from color variations which go from a pinkish hue to something that looks like three-strip Technicolor.  At no time during these two films does one get any semblance to real Technicolor or anything close to it.  The best of the worst are LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY and A FAREWELL TO ARMS, which is not saying much because the visuals are still substandard and so is the sound. It's just that compared to the other three aberrations, these two fare a little better.  But I would like to stress that the entire set is no better than a bad public domain copy of any of these films.  Kino has added no extras whatsoever, not even English subtitles.  It's a no frills package of unacceptable prints at premium prices.  This is an insult and a slap in the face to consumers and collectors.  There should be an agency that handles situations such as this, and Kino should be made liable, and be forced to reimburse EVERYONE who has fallen prey to their false claims and advertising and has purchased these five films, whether singly, or all together in a boxed set.  So be warned, if you spend any money on any of these 5 releases, you are just throwing your money away.  If you absolutely must have one or more of these films, I suggest borrowing them from your public library or renting them and making dubs.

The only thing that dates this film is the music score. When the film was re-issued the newly formed censorship caused the film to be cut from 89 minutes down to 78 minutes. Many scenes had a only few seconds cut out of them while others were clipped more severely. Warner Bros. bought the rights to the Ernest Hemingway material from Paramount and re-issued the film with new main and end titles in the censored version around 1950. That edition appeared as a Laser Disc and was the first decent picture quality available for home use. Later David O. Selznick acquired the rights from WB in order to remake the film. The uncut version of the film was included in that deal. Finally Image released the full version on DVD with a somewhat weak sound track. Now with Kino's Blu-ray and DVD release the film can be seen the way it should be.

730871,5,6303934757,"""I'm afraid of the rain because sometimes I see me dead in it. And sometimes I see you dead in it."" -- Helen Hayes

Frank Borzage had a romanticism and sensitivity to his silent work matched by none, and when sound came along he continued to put a delicate touch on films that required something more than just direction. With Hemingway's ""A Farewell to Arms"" he brought this romantic tragedy to the screen with a dark and foreboding glow. Gary Cooper and Helen Hayes portray the doomed couple battling for moments of happiness while bombs explode everywhere around them.

Cooper is Frederic, an American driving in the Italian Ambulance Core who meets and falls in love with lovely Katherine (Helen Hayes). She is a nurse and both are simply trying to outlast the reality of war, any romantic notions crushed long ago by the parade of damaged young men. Borzage uses Charles Lang's photography to frame their old-fashioned romance against images of the first war which engulfed the entire globe. Rather than a grand film about war, however, Borzage makes his point by creating a warm and intimate glow to a romance filled with sweet moments of love, yet surrounded with doom.

Through a timid kiss on a public street, a gift of a shared St. Anthony necklace to guard her sweetheart from harm, Katherine's romantically embellished description of her shabby hotel room when writing her love, and a marriage ceremony on a hospital bed where they pretend they can smell orange blossoms on the wind, Borzage creates something timeless while at the same time showing that true love once meant something. When Frederic comes back after their first time together, the viewer knows long before he gets there it is because he needs to let her know it really meant something to him.

Adolphe Menjou is Frederic's misguided party pal who can't understand and tries to interfere, then has a change of heart and helps them reunite under dangerous circumstances, but perhaps too late. For those who haven't seen it, I won't ruin the experience with too many details. The final shot of doves shot against the heavens has much the same effect as the final shot of Borzage's ""Three Comrades."" This old-fashioned and tender film is an early sound masterpiece anyone with a romantic heart will enjoy.",1191801600,4,2281,4.856041131105399
730872,4,6303934757,"As a fan of old Hollywood movies and stars, I went for ""Farewell"" because the name carries so much weight in American literature and film.  Who can resist these titans of cinema? Well, perhaps those who need a well developed story line and believable script.
One must extend his or her sense of the age in which this film was made.  Editing and paper cut-out effects make this seem incredibly amateurish by modern standards. Emotions are so overwrought that it could have been a silent movie.
Gary Cooper steals his best friend's girl with no remorse. Helen Hay's character is equally spineless right up to her death scene which is hammy enough to bring a smirk to George Washington's face on Mt. Rushmore. Adolphe Menjou gets his revenge by wrecking both their lives.
"" A Farewell to Arms"" is a paraphrase of a French saying meaning desertion. They got it right in the movie.
Having said all that - this film got an Oscar for cimematography. The bar must  have been petty low back then. Perhaps when this was made in 1934 the popular sentiment was that ALL soldiers should desert.
In conclusion, I liked the movie, but I understand from whence it came.  With the price of movie tickets about the same as the price of this DVD, I am happy with my purchase.

One big departure is that Major Rinaldi (Adolphe Menjou), the surgeon who is Henry's (Gary Cooper) friend and drinking buddy in Hemingway's work, becomes the villain here in that he intercepts Henry and Catherine's (Helen Hayes) letters. There are other changes as well. The priest blesses their marriage-- sort of-- for the 1932 censors I suppose. But then the movie is not the novel and doesn't have to be.

Gary Cooper and Helen Hayes give fine performances. It is easy to see why Mr. Cooper was a leading man of the first order, and Ms. Hayes' acting ability of course is legendary.

As relevant today as it was during WWI, with today's Iraq war raging overseas, the viewer can't help but wonder when we will live to see peace again.

The grandeur of the film is in its magnificent cinematography, each shot beautifully framed, which, unfortunately failed to rescue the one-dimensional characters.

If she didn't, that's good acting. It is war & theirs is a really hot, sexual love affair. The war intervenes & separates them. The battle scenes & the montages of Lt. Henry's search through Italy for Catherine was a mess. Were all the scenes shot at night? That made it rather tedious. Adolphe Menjou had a meaty role as Major Rinaldi, Lt.

A good deal of the credit goes to writers Garrett and Glaizer and director Borzage--but the real interest here is not so much in the cinematic interpretation of the Hemmingway novel as it is in the cast, which is remarkable.

Actress Helen Hayes was already among the leading lights of the New York stage when she was lured to Hollywood for a handful of films in the early 1930s--and it is easy to see what all the fuss was about.  Plaintive beauty aside, unlike most stage and screen actors of the era she is completely unaffected in her performance and proves more than powerful enough to overcome the more melodramatic moments of the script.  She is costarred with Gary Cooper in one of his earliest leading roles, and while the pairing is unexpected, it is also unexpectedly good: they have tremendous screen chemistry, and in spite of the film's dated approach they easily draw you into this story of an ill-fated wartime romance between a nurse and an ambulance driver.

The film is also well supplied with a solid supporting cast that includes Adolphe Menjou, Jack La Rue, and Mary Philips, and while clearly filmed on a slim budget--something most obvious in the battlefront sequences--the camera work is remarkably good.  Unfortunately, all this counts for nothing unless you can find a print of the film that you can stand to watch.  It is sad but true: the 1932 A FAREWELL TO ARMS seems to have fallen into public domain, and the result is a host of DVD and VHS releases that range from the merely adequate to the incredibly dire.

I have encountered a number of these releases over the years, and I feel safe in saying that the best DVD presently available is the Delta release; the VHS honors go to the out-of-print Burbank Studio ""Hollywood Favorites"" version.  But this is only in comparison with the unspeakably vile Madacy and Front Row versions, which should be avoided at all cost.

The chaos that surrounds the relationship makes all the participants (including Cooper's best friend, played by Adolphe Manjou) act in ways that are misguided, causing more misfortune, and furthering the anguish of the plot; the chemistry between the stars is wonderful and believable though, and despite its bleakness it is still a tender love story.
There are hellish scenes of war, set to Wagnerian musical themes, and there is an ominous mood that prevails in every scene, even when Cooper and Menjou are out on a drunken spree.

I first saw the film as a twelve-year old in 1931, when it was released; but I've reread the novel many times, and have seen the film twice in recent years. I am a veteran of World War II and a retired professor of literature. So I can now see AFTA through the eyes and sensibilities of a hopefully more seasoned, if not cynical, old man.  In '31, I was too young to ""get"" the implications of war's tragedy (even though my boyhood was saturated with stories and films about ""the Great War""--""All Quiet on the Western Front--the novel & the film--What Price Glory--the play & the film--the 1927 Seventh Heaven with Charles Farrell and Janet Gaynor co-starring, too young--in that earlier age of innocence--to know how babies were made). Now I am touched by Frederick Henry's (not-so)""innocent"" affair with Nurse Cathrine Barkley, touched by its initial idyllic quality. But in 1931, I had not read AFTA. Hardly! Or if read would I have understood it. But decades later, I can now see the lacunae, the holes & telescopings and elidings of vital scenes in the novel, one being the couple's ""alpine idyll"" above Montreux, Switzerland, the row across the lake to Switzerland (which Catherine shares, but not in the film), and which may have contributed to the complications of her baby's still-birth and her own death by loss of blood. Finally, that silly Hollywood ending, with Cooper (an otherwise good performance considering the pre-Method time)picking up Catherine from her (death) bed, murmuringm ""Peace! Peace!""  to the skies beyond the open window,as bells toll the war's end. Too much, what follows and ends the film--those doves fluttering across that sky. I can now see why Hem was so disgusted at the film. Had it ended in the way the novel ends, we would have had a more powerful and dramatic fadeout, with Frerick Henry walking out of the hospital and back to his hotel through the rain, the rain a dominant motif that runs through the film and the novel, his mourning, his loneliness far into the rest of his life (as Hemingway himself was haunted by the real-life ""Catherine,"" Red Cross nurse Agnes Von Kurowsky).

Get a different version if you must, but not the Hollywood Classics version at any price.  It is unwatchable.",994809600,6,499,4.428571428571429

7855564,3,6303934757,"Even though I think this was a pretty good movie, I'm giving it three stars.  This is because there was a little too much religion in it for me.  I was curious about the book version and downloaded a free PDF.  It turns out that one, maybe two of the characters are atheists.  In the book, Catherine (played by Helen Hayes), states that she doesn't believe in religion.  Of course, that doesn't mean she doesn't believe in a god, but it's not a far stretch.  Worth watching though.",1508457600,,481,4.409090909090909

This version of the epic Hemingway story, even though the first produced, is a very poor adaption.  Gary Cooper needlessly plays a very jerky part, stead of the playful and endearing character of the story.  The story portrayed really doesn't make sense unless you've read the book.
