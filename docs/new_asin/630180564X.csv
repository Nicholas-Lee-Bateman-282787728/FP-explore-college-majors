7816457,1,630180564X,Wish I could leave lower. This dvd is a homemade copy off of a vhs tape. In my opionion. The picture jumps fades in and out and does not play most of the time.,1504656000,,159,3.7058823529411766
7816458,3,630180564X,the movie was good but condition of the DVD was poor. IT froze and skipped. it was hard to watch.,1498521600,,97,3.9
7816459,1,630180564X,"Very poor reproduction.  I thought being ""Digitally Remastered"" would mean that the product was good, but the picture quality is worse than my old VHS copy.",1454457600,,156,5.0
7816460,2,630180564X,"I purchased this DVD from FilmRise through Amazon, thinking it would be a better release than the Echo Bridge since they combines 5 movies for 400minutes on 1 disc.  This film has video drop out in the 1st 2 minutes and the picture quality and compression are not good for watching on anything over 27 inch TV.  I have not seen the Echo Bridge disc to make a comparison, but this is not that good for picture quality. more like being made from a VHS tape. so much for re-mastering.",1449100800,,481,4.333333333333333

7816462,5,630180564X,"This movie shows how Clint Walker developed as an actor beyond the Cheyenne series.  The bitter man, Kincaide, is well acted and believable, not a person you would want to cross.  The other actors in the show are also very well done.  A good story.",1360713600,,248,4.466666666666667
7816463,1,630180564X,"This a great hard to find video and I would enjoy seeing it again since it has been a long number of years since my last viewing. But thanks to the seller MovieJukeBoxReply that is impossible due to the horrible packing and shipping of the items I ordered. Thin U.S. Postal envelope with 2 pieces of cut up card board box for packing protection. Envelope came full of holes and the sleeves that held the video's were torn and mangled. Then when I added my reply to rate my service I was accused of being another seller and a lier.

Well I will not be accepting this items and have reguested a refund and before I get to watch them again I will order from a provider that knows how to pack their items for shipping and can themselves tell the truth about an unhappy customer. I am a practicing Audiologist and a collector of movies and video as a hobby I am in no way a reseller of my movies, video's, etc. order from anyone besides MovieJukeBoxReplay for your needs!",1334016000,,966,4.337016574585635
7816464,5,630180564X,"This is an excellent movie, I enjoyed it very much and have watched it several times. I have always been a Clint Walker fan, and it is so fun to see him play something other than the good guy. I would recommend this movie to all western fans. His character is so different from the character of Cheyenne Bodie, and I think he carried it off very well. I think he is a very under rated actor, and deserves more recongnition than he gets. Very good movie.",1257465600,3,453,4.218390804597701
7816465,5,630180564X,An exceptional made for TV western by my good friend Clint Walker!  Great work Clint!  Your the greatest!,1252022400,4,105,4.777777777777778
7816466,5,630180564X,"Good action western with a compelling story line. Hard to understand why Clint Walker didn't become a megastar; he out-classes most
of what Hollywood's offered thru the years. And I loved the music score for this one.",1248912000,3,217,4.891891891891892
