7400060,5,B014HFNQ7C,"I saw this DVD on an infomercial one night and just had to get it. Jimmy has such a wonderful singing voice, and combined with Bill Gather, its even better! This DVD has traditional hymns as well as some songs that Jimmy wrote himself. I also loved the interview that Bill Gaither did of Jimmy on the DVD. If you love southern bluegrass gospel, then this is the DVD is for you.",1495324800,,377,4.25

7400073,5,B014HFNQ7C,Excellent!  Very nice collection of songs and informal interviews.  Mr. Fortune is always a warm and inviting entertainer.  He is a man who cares about everyone who listens to his music and hears him tell about his life.  The music was very good as were all the performers on this DVD.  We have seen Mr. Fortune perform in person and his great personality comes through on this DVD also.,1462492800,,387,4.550724637681159

7400077,5,B014HFNQ7C,"I was turned onto Jimmy Fortune by a dear friend of mine although, being a Bluegrass fan (and guitar picker), I was most familiar with the Statler Brothers from years ago.

7400079,5,B014HFNQ7C,"Jimmy Fortune is one of the best singers I've ever heard.  Whenever he comes nearby, I make sure not to miss his concert.  Hit's & Hymns is a great collection of country gospel songs.  Mixed in are songs he wrote while with The Statler Brothers.  I saw part of this on RFD-TV and had to have the full length DVD.  Highly recommended.",1457654400,3,333,4.306451612903226

7400095,5,B014HFNQ7C,I purchased the DVD version of the album.  Jimmy is hosted by Bill Gaither and they talk about many things including how he came to join the Statler Brothers.  It reminds me of the Statler Brothers CDs.  It is one of the best albums that Jimmy Fortune has made.  Just wonderful.,1454716800,3,278,4.392156862745098
7400096,5,B014HFNQ7C,Jimmy Fortune has one of the BEST voices of all time.  I've been a fan of his since he became a member of the Statler Brothers and even a bigger fan since he struck out on his own.  Every song in this CD is sung with pure emotion.
