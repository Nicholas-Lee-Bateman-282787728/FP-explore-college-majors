8608182,1,B001D5C1E4,"The program mastered on this DVD is defective.  It is very old and has been boxed up to look like a new release.  The program itself is poorly made and is missing important text such as the entire ""fact"" box, lower third Identifications of interview subjects and subtitles.  I wrote to the distributor Madacy Home Video to let them know their mastered program was defective but received no reply.
