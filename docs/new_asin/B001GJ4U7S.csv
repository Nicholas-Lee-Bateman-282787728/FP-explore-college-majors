8305626,1,B001GJ4U7S,"We watched about 15 minutes of it, and then we put it aside.  Perhaps we did not watch enough of it to make a judgment.  It could be that it got better further along, but we wanted to watch something more entertaining.",1411344000,,218,4.166666666666667
8305627,1,B001GJ4U7S,Poor audio and videu quality. Nearly unwatchabe.  Unamusing plot and the scary character looKed like they were simply dressed in full-body spandex.  Low budget production.,1399852800,,171,5.8
8305628,1,B001GJ4U7S,"Not worth the time.
Very bad acting, very bad story line. It was like an average individual making a movie in their back yard.",1394236800,,126,4.291666666666667
8305629,1,B001GJ4U7S,"Horrible movie.  I've heard of ""B"" movies, but this must be a ""C"" movie.  We only watched the first 15 minutes and couldn't take any more.",1379980800,,138,4.269230769230769
8305630,1,B001GJ4U7S,"This was the most boring and awful movie ever.  The actors were Terrible, I have seen better from elementarybkds in little plays. Ridiculous. Uses some extreme inability to be realistic with anything... Low buget, low goals, not thought out, pathetic.",1373846400,,251,5.275
8305631,2,B001GJ4U7S,"I generally enjoy ""bad"" movies, but there weren't too many entertaining elements to this one.
The way it was shot, I was willing to let go of considering its budget.  The ""acting"" was not the worst I've seen (and can make B films diverting at times) ... it was consistently poor, though, and I couldn't find much redeeming value.  About half an hour into the film, where it made some attempt at becoming exciting, I just had to give up and move on.",1373328000,,448,4.385542168674699
8305632,1,B001GJ4U7S,"There is another ""Shadow People"" on Amazon.  Since I'm trying out the Prime membership, I saw this ""Shadow People"" and simply thought it was the same movie but with a different cover photo.  The cover photos on the two movies are somewhat similar as well.  In looking into potential movies to watch, I somewhat consider the cover photo of the movie...does it look professionally, amateur, etc.  The cover photo looks like this would be a well done movie.  I was COMPLETELY wrong!!

If there was a movie category on Amazon called ""Home Made Amateur Movies,"" this movie would undoubtedly be there.  I expected to see a decent movie since this movie is mixed in with all of the other professional movies.  I've seen plenty of ""B rated"" and ""low budget"" movies, but this movie was the absolutely HORRIBLE!  In my opinion, it couldn't even touch being considered a ""low budget"" movie.

The people's voices sound as if the microphone on a hand-held video recorder was used, instead of a professional boom stand...i.e., you hear the ""distance"" and reverb in the voices.

The acting is absolutely terrible.  Special effects were terrible.  The set was terrible and I'm assuming that it was built in someone's home.

I got that ""Oh no.  Here we go"" feeling when I saw the content warning of ""gore,"" etc. that was not provided by the agency that typically rates professional movies.

This is the worst ""movie"" I've ever seen.  This film really should be put into an amateur category.  Otherwise, people like me will have the expectation that we will be seeing a professional or, at the very least, low budget movie.  This is truly a homemade movie.  If it was pitted against other amateur home made movies, then it would be in a league of other similarly made movies.

I wanted to write this review, in part, to warn others.  I would steer clear of this terrible attempt at a movie, regardless of whether you have a Prime membership or not.  THANK GOODNESS I didn't have to pay for this!!  If you do not have a Prime membership, there is no doubt that you will NOT want to waste your money (or time) on this film.  Believe me.",1371081600,,2116,4.623655913978495
8305633,2,B001GJ4U7S,"Well, I managed to sit thru it, but it wasn't easy.  While I appreciate the idea of the film and the effort it took to make it, the resulting product was very poor.

I can clearly see the effort expended - the sets were done as well as could be expected for an amateur independent film (altho I am not sure this truly falls under ""Independent Film-making"", but rather low-budget amateur effort), the acting was alright in a few places, and the plot was at least well thought out.

The execution of it all was mostly poor, due to both poor acting and poor acting that was uneven and unrealistic.  I mean, are these people afraid or not?  Impossible to tell in most places.  When they should be calmer and trying to rationalise things out, they are almost hysterical with fear.  When they should be terrified, they are bland and look as if they are desperately seeking a teleprompter for lines to say.

For a few upsides for the acting of a few of the cast players, the business man was all right.  He behaved as one and even tho the film is obviously low-budget, he wasn't bad to watch.  His body-guard couldn't really act, but he at least showed true concern and misgivings.  I give him an ""A"" for effort. The brothers in the film were slightly above tolerable, imo, until the part where they were no longer the focus.

The teenagers' acting made me cringe.  The girls sometimes behaved realistically for what the story called for, but the males were too calm, or rather, unable to behave as if murder and mayhem was taking place.  Their reactions to events as they occurred was absurd, to put it kindly.

Overall, I'm not certain that I am glad I watched this particular film or not.  Even tho I am intrigued by the myth of Shadow People, this film did the concept no justice.  It was as if the Shadow People were not the focus, or even A focus.  They were merely props for the scenes of gore.

The ending credits and music were, on the other hand, quite entertaining!  I even backed up the track to watch them and hear the song again.  *smile*",1367539200,,2045,4.4144385026737964
