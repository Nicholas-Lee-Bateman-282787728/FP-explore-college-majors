8629028,5,B00H0F8U1O,"I bought this because of the male lead.  He is the highest paid singer in the world, grew up in America, he's even got a Masters degree in music.  Well any-ways I liked him in the movie he made with Charlie Chan called ""Little Big Solider"" and my daughters thought he was handsome too...  This movie is a light weight comedy and can be enjoyed for just that...light comedy.",1442188800,,373,4.3768115942028984
