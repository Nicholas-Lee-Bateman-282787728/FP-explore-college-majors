Anyway, this low budget piece of  schlock had a logo nearly constantly on the screen.
Who wants to pay to  see a logo?  Not me!",958867200,3,315,3.696969696969697
1236058,4,B00000JNTX,"While this DVD isn't the best documentary I've seen, it is still very entertaining. I guess the appealing thing about it is that it isn't just a compilation of old, overseen interviews. It takes you to the opening  screening of A New Hope: Special Edition, and interviews well known actors,  as well as the stars of the Trilogy, on what Star Wars means to them. This  is worth the price alone.",951091200,11,393,4.507042253521127
1236059,4,B00000JNTX,"After viewing 'The Unauthorized Star Wars Story' I had very low expectations for this selection.  Surprisingly, the content was pretty good.  The narration was sound, the interviews were well mixed, and the  content is generous.  If I had any real complaints, it would be that this  DVD concentrates a bit too much on non-Star Wars subject matter.
Overall?  If you are a sci-fi fan pick it up.",945302400,19,393,4.791044776119403
1236060,4,B00000JNTX,"I don't know what these naysayers are whining about, it's cool! I am an avid collector of Star Wars Quicktime clips, and have recorded tons from ET, Access Hollywood and others. I hadn't seen ANY of these interviews! I t  was cool. The DVD also offers uninterrupted interviews in their entirety  (only about 5-7 minutes long each, but hey).",941500800,23,340,4.745762711864407
1236061,4,B00000JNTX,"a great DVD for all the fans, not a behind the scens movie, but a look at the hype. what the movie did to the world. The only misser (but a huge one)  is that there are no scens from the original movies in it. Maybe it is time  for mr. lucas to gif the fans what they want....an official DVD set, all  the movies including a behind the scenes documentary.",940896000,2,355,3.971830985915493

7913010,4,B00000JNTX,"The documentary is only 50 some odd minuets long. Nowhere near the 151 minuets like the back cover says. No footage from the movies are shown. The early interviews are the highlight of this DVD. Harrison Ford is actually having fun during his. When was the last time you've seen that? The press junket interviews from ""Episode 1"" are just fluff pieces. And, that's fine in my book. This is still a DVD about ""Star Wars"". If your looking for an in depth documentary about ""Star Wars"" you will need to buy the bonus disc from the Trilogy DVD set from a few years back. If you are looking for a cheap, fun, odd-ball doc, then you've come to the right place. Every ""Star Wars"" fan needs this in their collection. Everyone else should stay far, far away from this DVD.",1299974400,,763,4.418439716312057

7913012,3,B00000JNTX,"The 3 stars are just for the vintage interviews with the original cast. Something you don't see every day and with the charm of old and belovedly used video tapes. It's like a self cut amateur video of collected bits and pieces... and that gives you a warm feeling. The rest ... well, watch it once and then forget it!",1142208000,,318,4.316666666666666
7913013,3,B00000JNTX,"I bet you're mad how I always bring Lord of the Rings into comparision with Star Wars BUT I CAN""T HELP IT!! Lord of the Rings actors and actresses will someday be put into a book like this. Hopefully they won't end up don't voices for cartoons like Mark Hamill. Viggio Mortenson and Orlando Bloom don't seem like they are sharing that fate. Another thing:I sooo love Peter Jackson doing all three movies at the same time. It's okay for Star Wars(Though sometimes it seems like they don't act the same in Star Wars afterwards)Lordies guys have all had a easy time making it seem continus. After All They probaley felt they WERE almost Tolkiens characters.
  Now I know that Harrison Ford is a huge actor but still. I don't think I'm as interested in Star Wars guys.",1075852800,,764,4.528985507246377
7913014,2,B00000JNTX,"This DVD is a hodge-podge of footage of people waiting in line, brief interviews with the stars of the films, short cuts of sci-fi films and television shows, longer interviews with the series' fans, and a few other eccentricies. The narration of the DVD is really well done and covers up for some of the poor editing. However, other than the narration, that's about it. The ""interviews"" with the stars are really short and most were done waiting in line for movie premiers. The DVD also contrasts Star Wars to Star Trek and towards the end of the disc an attempt at comparing Ed Wood to George Lucas is made. Can you believe it, comparing PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE to STAR WARS! Unbelievable.
The only DVD extras are a series of short interviews with some of the stars of Star Wars. Most are with cast members from THE PHANTOM MENACE. However, there are a couple other interviews that took place over twenty years ago with THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. The best interview in the whole set is with Harrison Ford and Anthony Daniels; it is by far the most entertaining and interesting part of the DVD.
This is a DVD that only Star Wars fans can appreciate it. It's not too bad for a hodge-podge collection of film. However, some of the editing is poor and there isn't anything new or thought-provoking. Besides that, the DVD compares Ed Wood's films to STAR WARS. If it weren't for the good narration and the Harrison Ford/Anthony Daniels interview, the DVD would have received one star just for the Ed Wood comparison.",1031616000,22,1511,4.6
7913015,2,B00000JNTX,"This DVD is an interesting collection of interviews and news footage. It's what you would expect. You will see a young Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford and Mark Hamill.
The DVD is kind of choppy in its presentation, but the interviews are interesting and the look into the past is very nostalgic. I didn't know what to expect when I bought this, but I wasn't totally disappointed.
The Star Wars fan will love it, but the general public...may get bored. There are no DVD Extras of note either.",1024876800,15,488,4.620689655172414
7913016,4,B00000JNTX,"This is a great DVD for avid STAR WARS collectors. It has interviews with the cast and crew of all four STAR WARS films including director George Lucas, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fischer, Liam Neeson, Harrison Ford, and many others. It also has interviews of celebrities who are fans of the STAR WARS films like actress Christina Ricci, William Shatner, and Sharon Stone, among others. The interviewer asks some intelligent questions to the stars of STAR WARS and the celebrity fans, but then there are also some non-intelligent questions that the interviewer asks. There are no sceen clips from any STAR WARS films because this was not made by Lucasfilms company. It also talks about other films that are like STAR WARS, such as STARK TREK. This DVD can only be really appreciated by hardcore STAR WARS fanatics. People who just sort of like STAR WARS but are not obsessed about the sega would probably care less for it since it would be a little less interesting for them. But since I am a huge STAR WARS fan, I really enjoyed this film. It gives a good insight on the films and the people who were apart of them. Highly recommended for avid STAR WARS fans only.",1007337600,12,1158,4.62621359223301
7913017,5,B00000JNTX,"While this dvd is by no means near any official release, it is a  comprehensive recollection of interviews that range from 1980 to 1999 with  stars as George Lucas himself, Sam Jackson and Carrie Fisher among others.  The dvd also includes stories about Episode I premiere, merchandising,  special effects and more. in a scale of 5 stars I'd give 3 to the quality  of the video image and 4 to the sound. In all, an enjoyable experiencie if  you're a fan, if not, you may be a little dissapointed by the old  interviews and the low quality image.",965260800,9,545,4.5
