you come away feeling so good, the good guys win, the bad guys loose
and the whole family can watch this series; a must buy and you will fall in love
with the characters!!!!!",1372550400,2,243,4.191489361702128
5322436,5,B009ERJXYO,"These mysteries are so good, while fairly wholesome and the characters so enjoyable, that you forget you're reading after a while and you even find yourself understanding some of the Italian. we'll buy the next season for sure!",1368748800,,227,5.0
5322437,5,B009ERJXYO,"I've absplutely fallen in love with the Don Matteo series!  The characters are quirky, loveable and completely entertaining.  Although there have been technical problems -- skipping and locking -- in series 1 and 2, they seem to have been corrected in series 3.  The plots are creative and very human.  Although Don Matteo's acting is a bit wooden, it's hard not to love him because he is essentially a down-to-earth, good-hearted and really likeable person. He is the priest we all want to know.

It would be great if someone could really create a first rate product from a technical standpoint because the series is really wonderful and just needs a technical match.",1367884800,,668,4.876106194690266
5322438,5,B009ERJXYO,"We love this series!  The plots, cast of characters, costumes, and settings in Sicily are very entertaining.  We are working on Set 3 and have Set 4 ready to go.",1366243200,,161,4.333333333333333
5322439,5,B009ERJXYO,"As mentioned before, my friends and I love the Don Matteo series because they are very well done, good acting, intelligent, fun and have no vulgarity or obscenity in them. We also like the wise quotations Don Matteo uses from various religions.
We would like the Don Matteo's series to continue with a USA format

5322440,5,B009ERJXYO,"The characters are interesting, enjoyable and well played by the actors involved.  The story lines and plots are far more imaginative than the general fare of American crime or mystery shows.  At the same time there is a simple understanding of human nature and the best of it as well as its weaknesses.  There is the absence of the need for panning and rapid camera switches which are excessively used in TV shows to keep people focused.  The likeable or particular qualities of the characters or dialogue is more than sufficient to keep ones attention.  We have purchased and watched Seasons 1, 2 and parts of season 4 and hope that Mhz continues to produce the other seasons (there are 10 and counting, I believe).  The subtitles are well done and timed to create an ease for viewing the scene while reading the dialogue.  The patient use of the camera shot allows this to happen.  I recommend this to anyone who enjoys mysteries and entertaining characters who are well played.",1360972800,,981,4.729411764705882
5322441,4,B009ERJXYO,"Pleasant light comedy/detective show, a great way to learn current conversational Italian, and for insights into Italian society. English subtitles are not optional, though, so just ignore them if you are studying Italian - or enjoy the subtle differences between the languages. Two dramatic episodes ""Heart of Ice"" and ""Revenge"" (""A Good Man"") were outstanding.",1354665600,,362,5.6

Perfect it you want to brush up on your Italian, but there are English subtitles so even if the language doesn't appeal to you, you will still enjoy this show. The characters are very believable; they start to feel like people you know. The acting is outstanding. Good humor. Good story lines.",1440201600,2,347,4.4375
