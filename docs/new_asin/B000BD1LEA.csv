8085260,1,B000BD1LEA,"Wow. I had bought this film to show to my Spanish classes as a Christmas movie. I'd hoped that they'd learn the importance of the Reyes Magos in Spanish culture. Unfortunately, it's full of language/visuals that would get me written up at work. My best guess is that it would be rated PG-13, but here are my real problems. One of the 3 wise men is actually in black-face. Then there was the issue of called the Japanese businessman ""the jap"" in the English subtitles.

Other than these gripes - it's just a bad movie. The plot doesn't make must sense and it's just boring overall. Don't waste your time. -2015",1449705600,,609,4.486486486486487
8085261,3,B000BD1LEA,"I first ran across this movie on the Spanish channel one night.  It caught my attention because it was obviously a comedy.  My Spanish is very limited, but I could follow what was happening because of the B grade slapstick.  Many people find this kind of humor stupid and not worth watching.  You can choose English if you want; but if you have had some high school Spanish, you may wish to watch that first and get the real feel of the movie. Spanish insults can lose their punch in translation.",1260489600,,496,4.417582417582418
8085262,4,B000BD1LEA,"A twist on the typical Christmas holiday slapstick movies, this Spanish movie based in Madrid is a little more adult than the Chevy Chase Vacation fare, which is part of its charm.  It sometimes felt like a cross between ""Christmas Vacation"" and ""King of Hearts"" (French film about asylum inhabitants in an abandoned town in WWI).  The only thing that pushed the limits was the animation used in the Christmas 7 firework at the end of a film that was largely ""realistic"".  Enjoyable nonetheless.",1152489600,2,495,4.869047619047619
