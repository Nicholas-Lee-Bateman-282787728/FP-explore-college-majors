The DVD was filmed with 10 HD-cameras in Jersey...how could it not be amazing?  The Used, UnderOATH, My Chemical Romance, Senses Fail, Killswitch Engage, A Static Lullaby...damn.",1121040000,,317,4.526315789473684

8074664,5,B000A59Q0A,"I really wish that the Taste of Chaos tour was still around. It was a great mix of bands. If you like Killswitch Engage, The Used, My Chemical Romance, Saosin, etc you will enjoy this show.",1336608000,,189,4.277777777777778
8074665,2,B000A59Q0A,"great bands, ok songs, the sound quality is HORRIBLE! why does every band i see in person suck on dvd? the show was way better when i went. The Used headlined the tour & only got 1 song on the dvd...Saosin played better but unfortunately didn't make it on the dvd. Underoath didn't play at the TOC i went to and i'm glad they didn't beacuse they play horribly on this dvd. buy the Epitaph Tour 2005 dvd instead, or save your money when something decent comes along",1135468800,3,464,4.284090909090909
8074666,3,B000A59Q0A,"I love the bands on this bill, but does anyone else think that Senses Fail ( at least Buddy ) played to a tpe?  I am not shooting these guys down in any way but seriously, listen to it and let me know.",1133136000,,201,3.6744186046511627
8074667,2,B000A59Q0A,"I saw the show in Seattle and it was a great experience. Live shows have that affect though. Even if the sound is bad, it still sounds good, just 'cause it's live, but not on this dvd. And certainly not the way this DVD is presented.

I was really hoping see more of a ""set"" from each band. At least a few songs in a row hopefully. This DVD is no more than a visual sampler of the bands and their live performances in poor quality. This was all shot at one show and throughout the duration of the tour. so what you hear is what you get. some of the performances are not of the bands best.

I really enjoyed the used performance live, as well as MCR's, and i was hoping to see more than just a SINGLE performance each on the dvd! I mean cmon, they were the headliners!! only two songs total!? not even the under pressure colaboration, which was really great!

dont buy the dvd. buy the actual albums and find a show next year for TOC2. itll be well worth it rather than this letdown.",1129593600,6,982,4.130890052356021
8074668,5,B000A59Q0A,"i mean i saw the tour in St. Louis a couple months ago (first night) and it was SO DAMN AWESOME.  A Static Lullabye was alluring, Killswitch Engage was out of this earth, before the show Bleed The Dream played and that was great, Opiate For The Masses made me laugh since the lead singer mooned the audience, Underoath was great with sound clips, and, of course, My Chemical Romance just blew me away.  I hope the DVD contains many songs from the acts.",1125446400,2,452,4.369047619047619
8074669,5,B000A59Q0A,"okay so whats going on? extra features could it possibily be videos clips of the artists?
