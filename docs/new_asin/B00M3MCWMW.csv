It flows completely, without gaps and it seems so REAL....like if your right next to the scene and at time part of the scene. Great Acting by all the actors, and the performance by Danny De La Paz is one of the best ever. it also features a great cast, with Richard Cabral, David Fernandez, Jr. and the other members that become one solid unit in this production. I highly recommend this movie and one will not be disappointed, and will find it a keeper for your DVD Library. It will become one of those movies that you will remember for sure.",1417996800,3,641,4.394957983193278

8670063,3,B00M3MCWMW,"This is a fairly straight forward film. Kapone (Ronnie Alvarez) is wanted by his parole officer  (Rico Aiello) for missing three meetings. He is also wanted by the Familia gang for being a snitch, of which he is wrongly accused.

That is pretty much it. Kapone has some good escape and running skills. He also has a wife and girlfriend. He is not exactly a role model, but he is what we got for a protagonist. The acting is so-so. The support cast lacked. The sound was choppy in some scenes.

Average Latino crime drama.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Some cleavage.",1451088000,,570,4.504854368932039

seen him since Blvd Nights when it was released in the movie theaters. Movie was better than I thought it was going to be.",1445212800,,271,3.9454545454545453

8670066,4,B00M3MCWMW,"I was really impressed with the film.. better than what I expected than other movies out there that were TRYING to capture that REALITY glimpse of the REAL neighborhood Life in the streets of Los Angeles..
Even though that lady detective killed some of the flavor of the film due to her TERRIBLE acting.. the story line was NEVER dull and interesting enough to keep the movie flowing with suspense ALL the way to the END..
definitely a MUST HAVE movie to add to My Collection of gangster flicks..",1429920000,2,496,4.584269662921348
