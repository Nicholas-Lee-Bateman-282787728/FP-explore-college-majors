615372,5,6303278795,"My thanks for the prompt delivery of this product.
This movie was originally bought as VHS tape for my son many years ago and he recently passed it on to his son. Unfortunately soon after this tape eventually failed so I started looking for a another copy. It arrived intime for his birthday. They both were so surprised I sourced a DVD copy.
They both sit back together and enjoy this old movie.

615667,5,6303278795,"While this movie was not a big kid's film (low budget) and came out without a lot of fanfare when it hit theaters, I worked on the film AND my son was the ""scorekeeper"".  So, what am I gonna to say?  I have waited for this film to come out on DVD and it went straight to Blu-Ray.  I have a dusty copy of the original video which my son had a hard time finding.  It was fun to see again.",1422230400,2,386,3.728395061728395

615708,5,6303278795,"Never thought I would see this movie come to DVD, let alone Blu-Ray. The Limited Edition Blu Ray is a must have for any Dirt Bike Kid fan from the 80's. The quality of the conversion is very nice. It's definately not High Definition Blu Ray quality, but it is very clear compared to the VHS version. I would say it's definately DVD quality anyway. The Blu Ray has a menu, with an Audio Commentary from the director, also a couple of interviews. This far surpasses the bootleg copy that was sold in years past as the DVD. This is an actual Blu-Ray disc or DVD release.",1418601600,7,567,4.308411214953271

615711,3,6303278795,"This DVD can be purchased from vintageshack for $15.99 I bought one on ebay for $20, the quality was poor, it was like a worn out VHS quality on DVD. I could tell it is not an official dvd release that was ever in stores. In fact a VHS copy of this movie may have better picture quality then the DVD, at least the VHS is official. The DVD is a laserdisc transfer. The one for sale on Amazon at $200 may be official since it is sealed, my ebay copy came like new however it was the exact same artwork.",1356393600,,500,3.9603960396039604
