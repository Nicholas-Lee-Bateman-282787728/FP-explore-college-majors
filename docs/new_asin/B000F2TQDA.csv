8516269,5,B000F2TQDA,"Marty Robbins possessed the most beautiful of voices and this allied to his wonderful song writing talent made him a star for nigh on 30 years before his untimely death in 1982. All 4 videos of this wonderful series are jam packed with great performances by this amazingly versatile and talented artist. Marty could sing any kind of song and not only that, he could write any kind of song and also put them across in a sorrowful tender performance with his trademark beaming smile! A 'Marty Robbins' comes along once in a lifetime; I'm glad he came along in mine.
These videos are a worthy memorial of a true star, the likes of that we'll never see again.",1326844800,,655,4.512605042016807
