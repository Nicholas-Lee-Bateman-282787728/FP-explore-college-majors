Proud Youth is another Wuxia where five clans gather together to keep in peace. They are Five Venom Clan,Evil Clan,Sun Clan, Huashan Clan,Taishan Clan,Hengshan. All clans have a gathering every two years to compete. There has been a conspiracy between the clans,and one of the clan members is to be executed for being involved with another clan member.

Proud Youth's choreography is directed by Shaolin Prince's Ton Gaai. The fighting is spectacular. There are many weapons used from chains,swords,spears. Chan Wai Man is an assassin for hire,he has the least screen time but when he's there he takes out many people. Wong Yu is the leading actor and his fighting skills are very solid. This is a serious role for him like in Rendezvous With Death. He does not compare to other leading actors that have worked with Sun Chung like Ti Lung,David Chiang,Johny Wang,Chen Kuan Tai. Ku Feng has a short appearance as one of the clan members being rescued. There is lots of action in this one,so this is a must for Shaw Brothers,Wuxia,Sun Chung Fans.",1357084800,,1251,4.868544600938967
