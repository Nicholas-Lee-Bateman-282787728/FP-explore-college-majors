7935711,3,B00005ASOP,"The Vault, a small piece of Charles Band and Full Moon Feature's brief side trip into urban horror and hip hop. The Vault is not my favorite of the 5 African-American themed horror films from this era (the others being Ragdoll, The Horrible Dr. Bones, Killjoy and Cryptz) but it is nonetheless an enjoyable popcorn movie for a lazy afternoon.
As usual in my comments on the films I purchase I will not get into details about the plot or storyline. I don't want to spoil the surprises for you. What I will say is that if you have an interest in African-American horror films or enjoyed films like Ragdoll, The Horrible Dr. Bones, Tales From the Hood, etc - then you should like The Vault as well.
* P.S. The Vault is easily the rarest and most difficult of Full Moon's black horror films to find on DVD. If you find yourself on this page, grab it while you can. It took 4 1/2 years of searching for me to finally land a copy of my own.",1413417600,,934,4.252808988764045

7935713,2,B00005ASOP,"Cant any one listen in this movie.  From the beginning a child who is disrespectful is told to leave and goes on like nothing happens.  Then hiss brain gets blown open.  Even that looked like jam on his head or some thing.  then you get a bunch of purple smoke on the screen.  As I told my dog some things are to bizare even for me.  But by the end of the movie only about three people are left to tell the tale of the Vault the enslaved the souls of mankind.  I am guessing this was a B rated movie.  It stole lines from other movies, and used few props.",1204070400,,555,3.936936936936937
7935714,1,B00005ASOP,"THE VAULT is bad.  That's all there is to it.  The script is ridiculous; the effects laughable; the performances awful.  Full Moon should be ashamed of this howler.  And I have to say that someone needs to tell actress Shani Pride that the proper pronunciation of ""What's with you"" is not ""What's witchoo?"".  A real loser.",1107216000,,322,4.678571428571429
7935715,1,B00005ASOP,"Well, this one isn't as horrible as Horrorvision, but it sure is close!  Nothing works in this film.  The look is very low budget, which is the case, but there are many ways to make it look better;  the acting isn't very good, the story is much too simple, and much too boring, some scenes defy reason, I could go on for days.  I want to like Full Moon films, but I just can't.  The film, it looks as tho they spent exactly one day on the script, one day on filming, and one day on editing..maybe even less.  Black is a first time director, I think, and you can tell...he worries less about storytelling, and more about style, and using cool tricks that do nothing but take away from the plot.  The scenes are too drawn out, and there is very little suspense.  Some of the acting is just plain bad, some is decent at best.
Another problem with this movie is the back story with the slave trade.  I don't know a lot about the slave trade, but I'm gonna take a wild guess and say, despite what the movie claims, they never delivered slaves from Africa to California.  That fact took away from the seriousness, then you have this horrible guard character who goes on and on about the history of the place, despite the fact that there's an evil spirit loose in the building.  I could go on for a while, but I won't.  This movie is just bad...Full Moon productions is just bad, and it's a shame, because I think they could go a lot better.",995155200,7,1434,4.250922509225092
7935716,2,B00005ASOP,"In the begginig it keeps you in suspense when a security guard knows about something evil is trapped behind a wall which noises comes out. People come to this building that's abandoned and one of them release this evil spirit and starts killing. Some scenes with some special effects are not that bad. The problem with this movie when the evil spirit gets in a form of a person,he's not scary at all. I really didn't enjoy it that much,doesn't mean it's that bad,i seen worst. Probally it's a movie you want to see one time and never again.",994809600,5,540,4.4646464646464645
