5082949,4,B007FQXEXC,"No real ""must see"" films here, but most you may have missed.  Nice set of escapism thrillers that you don't see around much and while they are primarily three star films they are entertaining and having 4  films together that you may not have seen is a plus.  Even the early Wes Craven off kilter horror flick while not as good as the others was entertaining.  Worth a watch.",1422489600,4,375,4.391304347826087
