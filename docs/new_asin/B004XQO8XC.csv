4496611,4,B004XQO8XC,"If I have it right, longtime chums Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas only ever starred in two pictures together: 1948's MR. BLANDINGS BUILDS HIS DREAM HOUSE and this one, THIRD FINGER, LEFT HAND, which came out in 1940. If you're ever torn between the twain, opt for MR. BLANDINGS... it's the superior flick. Not that THIRD FINGER, LEFT HAND sucks, mind you. But both Loy and Douglas have had more stellar vehicles. Adoring the hell out of Myrna Loy like I do, I can't bring myself to rate this lower than four stars. So mind the bias.

Myrna Loy's knack for generating that air of cool superiority is on full exhibit here. No one else can turn up her nose so delectably. She plays New York fashion magazine editor Margot Sherwood Merrick, except that the ""Merrick"" bit is a sham. She sports a gold band around her third finger, left hand, to fend off unwanted attention from her male colleagues and it doesn't hurt that this also reassures her publisher's jealous wife. Never mind that no one has once caught a glimpse of her perpetually absentee husband, ""Tony Merrick."" A confirmed career woman, Margot means to maintain her duplicity, and this is probably a damning commentary on how much of a sexist asshat the male executive can be. She's even got her family bamboozled.

But then comes a chance encounter with itinerant artist Jeff Thompson (Douglas), and suddenly the jig is up. Jeff catches on to Margot's deception and, to get back at her after a tiff, he begins passing himself off as her husband Tony Merrick. Now Margot finds herself in an untenable predicament. The last thing she wants is a real-life fake husband. But what's one to do when even the press media's gotten into the act, heralding her hubby's triumphant return? Margot hits on the idea of a divorce, except that this would mean she may first have to marry Jeff (just to keep things legal). It's all so screwball even Irene Dunne wants no part of it.

You can tell that Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas get along well together, even though they don't quite achieve Loy and William Powell's legendary bang-on chemistry. But there's a batch of good banter between the two, and several nice situational comedy develops. Douglas has always had impeccable comic timing and I dig that occasional hitch or crack in his voice. And Myrna Loy, as ever, is gold, delivering the film's funniest moment when, in one scene meant to embarass Douglas's character, she surprisingly rolls out a brassy Brooklyn accent. If only the script had given them even more to work with. I also like that bit when Loy double talks her food order at the restaurant (the punchline is when the waiter actually delivers on ""a chicken on toast without the bread"" and a ""rye sandwich on white bread plain without the chicken"").

Only Ohioans will truly appreciate Douglas's incessant humming of ""Round on the end and hi in the middle, Ohio."" I thought it was a bit much that Douglas's character kept asserting his preference for his hometown of Wapakoneta, Ohio. It's all part of the trend back in the '30s and '40s, of course: the successful career-minded girl being brought to heel and domesticated by the overpowering male. And yet I don't quite see the advantages that Wapakoneta, Ohio would have over the Big Apple. I heard Wapakoneta used to have a zoo, but then the chicken died.

One delightful surprise is Ernest Whitman who shows up in the film's third act. He plays the train porter Sam who, having taken law correspondence courses, is recruited to Jeff's cause (obviously, Jeff is in love with Margot and would rather that the divorce not take place). This happens to be one of the rare dignified roles given to a black actor back in that era. Sam the train porter even gets the last word just before the film's final fade-out. So that's cool.",1313366400,5,3789,4.69172932330827
4496612,4,B004XQO8XC,"Margot Sherwood (Myrna Loy) is a beautiful, sophisticated, rich, New York magazine editor who pretends to be married to a nonexistent husband, Tony Merrick, whom she has told her family and business associates she met and married on vacation a year ago. She explains the fact that her husband is never around by saying he loves to travel. Her primary reason for inventing a husband is that the owner of the magazine openly flirts with his female employees in front of his wife, who insisted that he fire the last two unmarried women who held Margot's job. The wedding ring has also protected Margot from unwanted pursuit by other men she encounters through her job and has helped her hold off a persistent suitor who is madly in love with her and wants to marry her, a lawyer named Philip Booth (Lee Bowman).

Margot's excellent plan falls apart when she encounters Jeff Thompson (Melvyn Douglas), an artist who falls for Margot, too, and asks her to marry him. Margot is spooked when it becomes clear that Jeff has figured out she is lying to him about her husband. As a result, she rejects him harshly, which hurts and offends him. Jeff confirms his suspicions about her not being married by having a friend check the records where she supposedly got married. Then, to teach her a lesson for how she treated him, he shows up at her family's mansion and announces to the butler, her father and sister that he's Margot's husband Tony, putting Margot on the spot. She decides that the only way she can get rid of Jeff while he's openly pretending to be her fake husband is to legally marry him so she can divorce him.

I am a huge fan of Myrna Loy, and it was a real treat to run across a romantic comedy she made at the height of her career that I had never seen. She and Melvyn Douglas each starred in many romantic comedies in the 30's, but this was their first appearance together.

As far as the plot goes, it is never explained in the movie why Margot lives in a mansion in New York City and has a fabulous wardrobe which only the ultra rich could afford. An editor's job certainly would not pay for her lifestyle, and her father is never shown producing any income. Also, the premise itself--that somehow a wedding ring would stave off sexual harassment in the workplace--is rather hard to swallow today (and might have required strong suspension of disbelief in 1940, too). It was fairly common, though, during the Great Depression, for filmmakers to produce comedies about rich protagonists. And regardless of the oddness of the premise, it's always a pleasure to encounter a movie from the 40's in which the heroine is a career woman with a lot of spirit who maintains her personal strength from the beginning to the end of the film.

There is a role of particular note in this film that was very unusual at the time, an African-American train porter named Sam (Ernest Whitman) has studied to be a lawyer and is central in the climax scene to the resolution of the plot.

While not up to the standards of such classics of screwball comedy as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Philadelphia-Story/dp/B0045HCJQW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Philadelphia Story</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bringing-Up-Baby/dp/B004GJYR7I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bringing Up Baby</a>, this film has many amusing moments, the two stars have excellent chemistry, and any Myrna Loy fan will not want to miss it for her alone. She never disappoints.",1312070400,16,3532,5.020477815699659

After all its was released 75 years ago.  The story is simple and cute.  Some good laughs (especially Myrna's fruit hat that wasn't even supposed to be funny) but most of the movie you'll keep a smile on your face.  The days are gone when children could sit and watch a contemporary adult movie with their parents but thanks to DVDs we can go back in time and make it possible.  Make this movie a part of your library.

4496630,4,B004XQO8XC,"This formulaic picture joins the list of many, many in this style in this era, with variations in players and themes.  They kept showing up because they were in demand.  You get to see these fascinating, unique era stars, some the same pairings, many mixed around in various combos, over and over.  Old movie fans, then and now, never tire of the lineup.  We know these do not have today's tech and ""sophistication,"" but that they are actually very superior.  The restraint on the psycho and moral elements makes it a lot easier on the psyche and morale.  The jolts and volts administered by the current day free hand rightfully create wonder that people can sit and watch that same corrosive stuff over and over.

This one is kind of medium, but that's okay.  Myrna Loy, not a comedienne per se, but a classy lady who played comedy well.  I guess that's what romantic comedy is all about, not madcap, just very relationally funny. They gave her some glamour, in keeping with the times, but could have done more.  Her costumes were always high style, with a few real toppers along the way.  Speaking of toppers, she did sport some very exceptional hats; well done in that department also.  However, her hair styling was always a bit of a quiz to me.  While they may not have had the expertise at the time, and she appears to have rather fine weight hair, its styling was usually a bit flat.  Ah ... perhaps, thus the hats.  Yes, that would follow.  But she was a steady attraction, considered a beauty by many, very popular, even dubbed ""The Queen of Hollywood"" at one point, paired up with the one and only Clark Gable, no less, being the king.

But she's playing here with the wonderful Melvyn Douglas, hometown boy reluctantly come to the big city and turned about by the big city gal.  And vice versa for her.  Opposites attract, react, detract and then happily settle on the first.  Myrna's extreme Brooklyn accent shakeup at the Falls was of course a bonus feature flawlessly executed.  Lee Bowman is on hand as the spare suitor, being a mainstay in that capacity through the years.  Always a best man, never a groom.  He had that disappointed look handy, he used it so often.  Another bonus feature was the snappy porter with the legalese.  I have always liked Bonita Granville, the sister here, even in the short Nancy Drew series.  She's slimmed down and a bit more subdued for her, enthusiasm always being part of her contribution.  Papa done good too.

Swell duds and digs.  Good flick.",1351900800,6,2497,4.598639455782313
4496631,4,B004XQO8XC,"Along the lines of madcap comedy and situational comedy, this fluffy film centers on a deception with hilarious results. Margo Sherwood (Myrna Loy) is a career woman who fabricates an unseen husband Larry Merrick to avoid the advances of the male animal. This ploy works well enough until Jeff Thompson (Melvyn Douglas) enters the picture and discovers her deception and decides to play a joke on Margo. Jeff presents himself at the Sherwood family home as the long missing Larry and that is where the real craziness commences. From that point on, Jeff drives Margo a litle crazy as a constant presence in her life. Predictable, yes. However, this movie has its moments such as Loy affecting a Brooklyn accent and doing some double talk at a restaurant and Douglas launching into a song about Ohio. Despite the fact that the viewer knows where all of this is going, this is an enjoyable film that showcases Loy and Douglas on their first screen outing.
While Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House (their second movie together) is a much better movie in terms of script, this movie is undeniably fun and does a nice job of showcasing the pair as a comedy  duo. As always, Loy is a scene stealer with her cute little nose wrinkling appropriately and appealingly and Douglas is adroit as her nemesis a he one ups her repeatedly and throws her off kilter.
This may not be a top choice for comedy lovers, but for Loy fans this is a good choice.",1344988800,,1438,4.63921568627451
4496632,5,B004XQO8XC,"I have watched this movie twice already since it arrived in the mail the other day. It's so funny. I love it. Myrna Loy is delightful and irresistible as the main character who concocts an imaginary husband and Melvyn Douglas does very well as the man who decides to masquerade as that husband. They have great screen chemistry and good rapport between them. It is fun to watch them reacting to each other.
So far, my favorite scenes are when Melvyn shows up at Myrna's house as her long lost husband and also the scene where Myrna puts on a Brooklyn tough girl accent much to the surprise of Melvyn and the visitors from Ohio. Hilarious!
Fans of comedies of the 30's and 40's(such as the William Powell/Myrna Loy comedies and Cary Grant comedies) will love this one as well.",1329350400,5,775,4.542857142857143
8447331,5,B004XQO8XC,Hilarious movie with 2 great leads in Myrna Loy and Melvyn Douglas. The chemistry between them is great. (Evidently they were very good friends offscreen). The plot concerns a successful career woman who has invented a non-existent husband so she won't get harassed at work! She meets the Douglas character accidentally and they take a liking to each other. Initially she doesn't tell him she's supposedly married but a friend of hers lets it slip out when the 2 of them are out at a restaurant on a date. Douglas gets upset and investigates and eventually poses as the fake husband who nobody of course has ever met. From then on there are more and more misunderstandings and the movie gets funnier and funnier. Good ending too! Highly recommended.,1517443200,,749,4.813953488372093
