8051204,5,B0007TFHIY,I loved this movie on DVD about the life of Italian automaker Enzo Ferrari. It was intriguing and exciting!...highly recommended!,1417737600,,129,5.5
8051205,4,B0007TFHIY,"What happen to Phil Hill, the Count,Moss, Fangio, a mere mention of Peter Collins. These men made Ferrari and the film by pass's the greatest era before Schumacker",1354579200,,163,4.857142857142857
8051206,4,B0007TFHIY,"This was a good product, nicely packaged still in its original wrapper. I would recommend this movie to any car guy or anyone interested in how Enzo Ferrari went from racer to owning the biggest sports car company in the world. It is a long movie so make sure you have an afternoon off to watch the whole thing.",1320624000,,311,4.288135593220339
8051207,3,B0007TFHIY,"I should preface this review by stating that I'm a Ferrari aficionado and own a 1986 Ferrari 328.  So I bought this for the same reason I own lots of other Ferrari memorabilia and such - I'm a big fan of all things Ferrari.

I really wanted to love this movie.  But on balance, I felt it just falls short of what it could have been.  The life of racing icon Enzo Ferrari is told through flashbacks, with an enigmatic journalist being the vehicle to pull the story from Ferrari's past.  Visually the movie is quite stunning - cinematography you'd expect from a Spielberg or Cameron film, with many sweeping panoramas and unique camera angles.

But several serious flaws in the end waste much of the beauty of the movie.  First is the dramatic soundtrack;  it runs almost CONTINUOUSLY.  Heavy dramatic violin passages should be reserved for those critical moments of high drama.  But instead the strings sigh and cry and emote to such excess that when you finally get to a scene where such drama is warranted, it just sounds like the rest of the film.  There are a few moments where the soundtrack ceases, and they actually caught my attention due to the LACK of music for a change.

Secondly is the acting.  It's just simply sub-par.  Some of the characters (young Dino for example) just make me cringe in embarrassment for the poor acting job.  It's almost as if it was considered more important to have actors that LOOKED the part, rather than actors that might be off in historical-visual sense, but had greater skill.

Thirdly, it's just too bloody long!  At 215 minutes, it feels more like double that.  Many scenes are very slow and many could have simply been left on the cutting room floor to no detriment.  (And just as a footnote, the DVD has a very odd menu structure - you will see the credits roll after chapter 12, and most likely do what I did and hit 'stop' and go looking for 'part 2'.  Turns out it's just some sort of intermission where it LOOKS like the movie ends.  Very strange and annoying - simply bump the chapter button and the movie continues at chapter 13, but none of this is explained - you just get a message saying 'end of Part One' with no explanation of where Part 2 might reside!).

Lastly, if you are wanting to see Ferrari the car, instead of Ferrari the man, this is NOT the movie for you.  In the entire film there is probably less than a half hour of footage involving cars!  This is very much a biopic trying to explain the inner feelings and turmoils of a famous man;  it does not concern itself much with the cars that bear his name.  There is still plenty of glimpses (1930s Alfas, Ferrari 125, and a few others - including a 400i and 3x8 near the end of the movie) to satisfy us car guys.

Summary:  Beautiful cinematography marred by poor acting and 40 minutes of unneeded plodding story line, Enzo Ferrari is still worth the view if you are a fan of the marque.  3 Stars",1225584000,5,2916,4.428571428571429
8051208,5,B0007TFHIY,If you love Ferraris and motorcar history don't miss this one. Originally made for Italian television as a mini series. This one is not to be missed. It runs very true to the known facts and is probably only mildly embelished. The characters are great and even resemble their real life counterparts. The cars are for the most part accurate for the motorheads among us. All in all a great flick. More than worth the money at almost four hours of entertainment value. Put this one your collection today!,1200614400,2,501,4.640449438202247
8051209,4,B0007TFHIY,"A very good movie. Enzo is a very successfull man in the automobile business but not his marriage life. His desire, confidence, passion for cars never stops... watch this movie if you're really a Ferrari fan. You got to know how he manage his life.",1186185600,,248,4.533333333333333
8051210,2,B0007TFHIY,"there is nothing exciting in this film. the whole storyline is a boring narrative form, lots of talking. two romances, two sons, race cars. lots of wheel and logo shots. blah, blah and blah. i don't think people would like to pay to see this, unless it's for free viewing on the tube. absolutely no charisma from the actor who played ferrari. boring script, dialog, nothing dramatically interesting at all.",1165449600,3,406,4.814285714285714
8051211,5,B0007TFHIY,"What a rivitting movie!  The movie deals briefly with Enzo Ferrari's childhood and young adult years, then mostly from WWII until the early 60's.  There are other brief flashes into the 70's and 80's, but not much.  The main theme of the movie are the events that shaped Enzo Ferrari's life, and not so much about actual racing or running a racing team.  The story focuses mainly on his personal life, the two women in his life who each gave him a child, and how conflicted he felt with people getting killed in his cars.  The great news is that this movie would appeal to racing fans and non-racing fans (read: wives) because it is more a human interest story than a hard core gearhead movie.  With the blessing of Piero Ferrari, Luca de Montezemolo and the Ferrari factory, the historic racecars gathered for the scenes are amazing!",1155600000,7,834,4.601351351351352
8051212,5,B0007TFHIY,"I must admit that I was not knowledgeable about Enzo Ferrai's

personal life.  His relationship with Dino and later with Piero.

Here is Enzo with the 'warts' of his personal life and public's

view both creating the legend that bigger than life. Leaves you wanting more (and that is a good thing).",1147737600,9,298,4.673076923076923
8051213,5,B0007TFHIY,"Great movie of Enzo Ferrari's life. From the turbulent times between racing, building cars, his family and his conscience. In order to understand and love this movies a much as I did, you have to want to know what Enzo Ferrari was thinking in order to achieve his goals and success. Mr. Ferrari tells his story to a journalist who asks specific questions that Enzo himself wonders where or how he knows that about him. The journalist seems to know as much about Mr. Ferrari than he knows about himself. But he is not asking for an answer, more like a confession of his feelings. From his son Dino dying, his drivers dying in crashes on the tracks, from the public thinking his racecars are unsafe to his double life as a father. One of the best ""biography"" movie I have seen yet from rags to riches in creating a legend in the racing and automobile history.",1121731200,20,857,4.464968152866242
