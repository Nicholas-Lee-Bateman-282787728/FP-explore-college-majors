1014825,4,6305389004,Very cute movie.  It's an older movie and exactly how you would imagine pioneer life to be.  Overall good for the price,1386633600,,119,4.363636363636363
1014826,5,6305389004,I love this movie. I received it promptly in good condition. I would encourage anyone that likes clean movies set back in pioneer times to get this movie.,1359331200,10,154,4.535714285714286
1014827,5,6305389004,I bought this movie for 5 bucks at walmart in a movie pack. It was excellent I enjoyed every minute of it. And hopefully I'll find the christmas one for less too. Because the prices on amazon is crazy. Great movie.,1356134400,,214,4.2439024390243905
1014828,5,6305389004,"The Young Pioneer VSH tapes was great. I've been looking for that movie for over 10 years. I'm very happy to finally find it. Thanks for having it in your collection. It would be even greater to get it on DVD also. Again, it is a great movie. Thanks.",1309910400,,250,4.122448979591836
1014829,5,6305389004,"A likeable, young, couple heads West in a wagon to start a farm on the Great Plains of the Dakota Territory. Very realistic and accurate.

The couple face hardships and disasters, but make friends, and press on.
Thoughtful and charming.

The sequel film, ""Young Pioneers Christmas"" is just as good, continues the story, and is even more heart-warming.

I bought the VHS and copied them to DVD. It was worth the effort, because you come away feeling good.

The studios should put these two, excellent, films on DVD today!!",1270166400,11,521,4.820224719101123
1014830,5,6305389004,"This is the nicest western show I ever saw. Good plot, well chosen actors and actresses, in a convincing and beautiful tale of pioneer life. I could watch it over and over.",1147824000,16,172,4.40625
1014831,5,6305389004,This is a great movie based on the book by Rose Wilder Lane (daughter of Laura Ingalls Wilder).  Made for television in 1976 the acting is superb.  It tells one of the great stories of our American history and is done with  great affection.  A definite must for parents - this was recommended by  educational groups as a great movie.  Also a must for any history buffs as  it feels quite real.  What makes the movie is the very real relationship  between Linda Purl and Roger Kerns.  They make the story come to life.,943056000,48,517,4.404255319148936
1014949,5,6305389004,"If you like family movies on pioneers and/or the frontier, then you will probably like this one.  It does a good job of showing the struggles of frontier life, and provides good character role models for the kids.",1481587200,,213,4.605263157894737
1014950,5,6305389004,"I first saw this movie when it was first released many years ago and always remembered it.  It shows what a hard time this young couple had and their dogged determination to stay, keep their land, and make their own life together rather than return to their former, easier lifestyle with their families and friends near.  It is an amazing story of love and courage in young America, in the quite desolate Dakota territory.  Though the story takes place a long time ago, this young couple remain in principle strong role models for young couples starting their lives together today

1014953,2,6305389004,"Poor acting. Linda Purl did the best acting job but everyone else was kinda lame.

Unrealistic situations like the 18-year-old husband who was raised around horses yet not smart enough to know that running them non-stop while pulling a loaded wagon could kill them. One of the horses ended up breaking his leg and had to be shot.

Poor sets. You can tell the green screen was used a lot.

Slow moving. Clean movie, but children may get upset in the scene where the horse is shot.",1474070400,,479,4.482758620689655

1015048,5,6305389004,"I first saw this in the late seventies when my children were small. I loved it. Truthfully, after all these years, I couldn't remember much about the plot. The one thing I did remember was Molly saying to Davy...'but we're rich now, Davy.' For some reason, that stuck with me. I'm so glad to have it in my DVD library. It is a gem!
Firstly, it is CLEAN! Who says you need explicit language, sex, and violence to make a great story? This is pure family entertainment.
Secondly, it really makes me think a lot about what the women of the past - our ancestors - went through...all they endured in settling west. They were made of sturdy stock. They were strong physically, but also emotionally. They had to be.
This arrived before Christmas, but, since I was in the Christmas movie mode, I didn't watch it until after Christmas was over. Since then, I've watched it over and over. However, I will NOT be purchasing or watching Young Pioneers Christmas. I've read the plot summary. I don't care to see that one, but that's a personal thing for me. But one thing about that...the summary states that it takes place in 1874. When this one ends it's April of 1875. Little Davy is born in January of 1874, and he's fifteen months old when this movie ends, which means it was 1875. So...why would anyone back up and change anything?
If you're looking for a great movie, very realistically done (in my opinion) then this will not disappoint.",1451865600,4,1431,4.528957528957529

It is a ""B"" movie so not the top of the line.  However, refreshing and clean.  I would recommend it for anyone.  You can actually watch a good movie without all of the violence, cussing, and sex that is so prevalent in movies these days.

The wagon to see his work in the winter and a blizzard coming up - and they spend the night under the wagon wrapped in a canvas - wow- , and it's a good clean movie. But the acting is very poor, scenery and backgrounds are fake or made up poorly. I guess if you have watched all the other good movie a thousand times and you are absolutely desperate for an old fashioned movie, then this will work. Otherwise - if you wan more of pioneer life, save your money and go outside and plant a garden or cut some firewood, weave a basket - anything.",1417564800,,701,4.161764705882353
