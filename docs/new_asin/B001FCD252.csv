3584924,5,B001FCD252,"Last night on HBO I watched the premiere of this American Girl movie. I enjoyed the Kit movie from last year, they are really on a roll now I have to say!!  This movie is a MUST see for students from 3rd or 4th grade and up. The movie is about a 5th grade girl who is new to a school and is soon bullied by a click of 3 girls, one in particular named Tara.  This is not a sugar coated movie and you see Chrissa's situation go from bad to worse as she struggles to handle it by herself.

I figured this movie would be like every other typical Disney-style movie where Chrissa will eventually get revenge on the ""bad guy"", you know with some plot where say she makes some elaborate contraption which will embarrass the heck out of Tara and spill green paint on her or whatever and everyone will laugh at Tara and Chrissa will be the hero. That is NOT how this story goes at all, and I am very impressed American Girl (who is in the DOLL business) did not fantasy candy-coat the story.  Rather, as you will see, it is shown with much more realism and makes you think about what you would do if you were in Chrissa's (or her parents') situation.

I actually have someone who has been bullying my 10 year old daughter over the past few months and ironically I got a few pointers from this movie last night, it made me think a little different about how to approach the situation.  It also reinforced some of my beliefs on what makes someone a bully as well as providing some tips on ways to keep Chrissa staying strong.

Like other viewers, I bet you will be curious to see what bully Tara's parents look like - in every other movie (e.g. Camp Rock) the snobby/mean girl's mother is usually some self-centered witch who is nasty with her daughter and thus the chain continues....in this movie, you never get to see her parents. I think that is a good thing because it really let me focus on the rest of the story.  I am seriously considering buying a copy for my local school and/or library to donate it, it was that good. The acting was fantastic and Chrissa is absolutely charming, I would love to have a friend like her for myself or my daughter!",1231200000,96,2144,4.263546798029557

3584927,4,B001FCD252,This is a great movie to help children understand how and why bullying affects both the bully and the person who is being bullied.,1498089600,,130,4.458333333333333

3584931,4,B001FCD252,"""An American Girl: Chrissa Stands Strong"" deserves a strong presentation, HBO should have done better.  This one looks like your typical Made-for-TV movie, from Disney Channel, (if I said ""Lifetime"" that would be REALLLY BAD!) the colors are dull..  but the costumes are REALLY bright; I somehow got the idea that the color scheme of the sets and costumes SHOULD match. For this film it would make sense to make the sets brightly colored, the McKenna movie has bright colors, and it isn't too distracting. I don't know where in Minnesota it's set, unlike all other American Girl films. I blame HBO for these oversights. Compare this one to the films in the ""American Girl; 4-Movie collection"" all in contemporary settings with contemporary costumes, much more beautiful. To clarify this is off for American Girl, which normally as good as anything released in theaters. ""An American Girl: Chrissa Stands Strong"" teaches girls to ask for help if the problem is too big, something that most feminist media DOESN'T want to talk about.""An American Girl  Chrissa Stands Strong""  treats bullying more maturely than ABC Family's ""Cyberbully"" where the drama is hyped up emincley. This would be a good movie for teens as well",1493078400,,1217,5.00990099009901

The following is very recent case of an adopted black child with special needs who must have made so much effort to overcome the odds and get in the high school football team, but was bullied from last year by a trouble maker transferred from Texas, and culminating in an extreme case of abuse.
Still, this child feared to talk, ""McDaniel says he did not tell his parents what happened, but his younger brother heard about it from other students and told them on the evening after the attack. McDaniel was taken to a hospital and treated for rectal injuries.""

""Howard was initially charged with sexual assault, but an Idaho court reduced the charge to a felony count of injury to a child, allowing him to maintain his ""innocence"" and walk free on probation.""

I was almost concerned about how much she was and when it would turn around, because the little girl is constantly being told by her friends to ""Not tell"" anyone so she wouldn't be a tattle tale.  That was frustrating me, but finally, the point of the show was that kids NEED to include grown ups (family members, teachers, etc) in their frustrations and when someone is bullying them or picking on them--Yeah!!

Yes, I'm a man who watched an American Girl movie, but if it can help me speak to my girls about being a good person, then I can suffer through the 90 minutes.

The bullies were a lot meaner than I had expected for 4th graders and to me, their pranks were more the type of things middle school bullies might do. It was a well-written script that kept both my 6-year-old and me interested. It really conveyed the sadness and isolation of the new girl and even though the ending was a little bit unrealistic, overall, I was happy to discover that the teachers and faculty in the school took action instead of leaving it up to the kids to resolve this on their own, ignoring it altogether or even worse, dismissing it.

3585339,5,B001FCD252,"My ten-year-old daughter and I have been watching all of the American Girl movies through the years and we now have a clear favorite: Chrissa is not only a powerful film with a great message, the acting is credible and the lead actor is simply wonderful in the role of protagonist Chrissa. Chrissa is a fourth-grader who has to move to a new place with her family. She has a loving mother (a doctor), an artistic dad (who owns a pottery studio), an older brother, and a loving Nana. Things are going great until Chrissa begins her first day at her new school. There are two girls in particular who bully and torment Chrissa, posting mean messages, saying awful things, and spreading false rumors about Chrissa and her family.

Initially Chrissa feels saddened and simply plays the hapless victim, but when things get out of control and the bullying escalates, Chrissa, together with her new friends and the support of her family, embraces her inner strength and stands up for what is right. I loved the message of empowerment in this film, especially in today's world where bullying is a serious issue in schools and as an educator and mother, I could relate to the issues experienced by Chrissa and the other students at her school: the need to be accepted, the feeling of helplessness, the dilemma between speaking out and fearing being called a tattle-tale, all of these issues are well-explored in this film, and my daughter and I greatly enjoyed this.",1434153600,6,1456,4.75494071146245

Chrissa doesn't stand strong at some crucial points

The teachers know who is the bully and who are the victms. THEY don't stand strong. Seriously,  the bully posts a cyberbully post. And the punishment is towel duty and sitting out for a few weeks.  No suspension. Just a slap on the hand.

The teachers know who is the bully. And do nothing.

The bully really really has some SERIOUS psycho behavior and criminal behavior.
The bully STABS Chrissa with a pencil and the lead of the pencil gets stuck in Chrissa's back.

That's criminal assault! !!! Why didn't the movie address that and stand strong to that.

Although the movie has the best  of intentions. The message misses the mark. And missed many opportunities to address a bully.

And I get the movie is a kids movie and ends happily.  Parents need to point out what they should do not the way the movie is.

But the more I think about it the more I am truly disappointed. My daughter says it's only a movie.  I am the decider. And we discuss the subject.

Her best work, so far is the movie ""the greening of Whitney brown"" . The second best from her is the 2006 or 2007 movie "" within. "" she was excellent in that as well.",1399852800,,403,4.05
3585382,5,B001FCD252,"The 8 year old niece gives this five stars! She wanted to watch it again after it was over, so that was also a pretty good indication she liked it. She said this is her favorite American Girl movie & she's seen them all except the Saige one.
The movie has a good lesson for young girls, about dealing with bullies at school and being a new kid at school. The girl in the movie is maybe in the third or fourth grade? I could almost see the little cogs turning in my niece's head as she thought the movie over versus whatever goes on in her school class. The movie thoughtfully shows how to deal with bullying and [SPOILER ALERT] the girls even reconcile and become friends at the end, so the movie depicted dealing with bullies as well as I could ever talk about it. So I didn't think it was a bad thing that the eight year old wanted to watch it more than once.
The movie's theme was a little too mature for the kindergartner niece, though. I think she said once, ""That's mean!"" in a shocked way at the bullying and then asked to watch gymnast McKenna Shoot For the Stars again. So this film is perhaps a little mature for kids under...7? These two girls really enjoy movies that have a heroine who is their age or a little older. The only downside is they are both asking for those expensive American Girl dolls now, not because the dolls are in the movie, they're not. The dear nieces, however, can read the DVD covers and are familiar with the brand. I wasn't expecting a request for the dolls, for some reason.",1398729600,3,1514,4.2787456445993035

I would LOVE to give this movie more than three stars but I came out of this feeling like I watched a How To on being a bully.  I realize that they had to develop the antagonist characters in order to drive the film's message home but after witnessing a lot of the same behavior from a few girls in the neighborhood who recommended the movie to my oldest daughter I feel like the message missed its mark entirely by glamorizing the bullies.  It did open up a lot of opportunities for me to talk to my girls about how not to act and how bullies don't just ""get it"" so I'm glad for that.",1375056000,9,641,3.9921875

When the bullying goes too far and someone gets hurt, Chrissa finally gets the help she needs.

3585420,5,B001FCD252,"In the 1920s, compulsory school attendance ages were raised from 12 to 16. From the two great TV series which were set earlier in North America: Little House on the Prairie (8 plus 1 seasons beginning in 1974) (about rural 1880s in the Midwest) and Road to Avonlea (8 Seasons beginning in 1990 via Sullivan TV in Canada) (about the beginning 1900s on Price Edward Island in Canada), the All American Girl Books explore the 9-10-11 year olds of various periods in the 20th and 21st centuries.
How many G rated movies are available for our kids of today?

 In the 1950s kids no longer were kids when they reached high school in the 9th and 10th grades. In the 1960s kids were still kids until their last year in junior high. Today our kids no longer are kids around the 5th and 6th grades.  It is very difficult for parents to keep their kids as kids during or post middle school. Kids are now wearing makeup in the 5th and 6th grades.  There is just too much sex and violence on TV and in the movies and parents are letting their kids grow up too fast.

 My son, who is 41, wishes we live in the 1950s, 60s (although he thinks he has understanding the violence in American from racism and  Vietnam War), or the 70s when he was born. He thinks I am Beaver from Leave it to Beaver.  He hates TV of today and prefers to watch Box sets of TV from the 50s, 60s, and 70s.  He grew up with Little House, while my daughter 34 grew up with Avonlea. They both love the 1991 TV series Eerie Indiana which had only 19-30 minute episodes before the show was cancelled.  My son and I (he was 10) watched every Saturday morning the 1982 Voyagers series. It stimulated his fascination with history and he became a middle school history/civics teacher. His students think he is too square or old fashioned (I don't know the current words), but they love him and respect him. He does not have discipline problems like other teachers.  He tries to include family values as well as love for your country in teaching. He does have students post current events on the bulletin board every week and there is discussion of what is going on today led by the student supplying the article.

So I grew up with Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys. My sister had all the Nancy Drew books, but my brother only had a few Hardy Boys which I spent the summers in Texas afternoon siesta time reading both (with 100 plus temperatures outside) before going swimming at 4 pm. We went to movies on the weekends with loads of cowboy movies. My son and daughter also read the books during their summers. My daughter also did the Baby Sitters Club books and DVDs.

I have a 12 year old granddaughter and prior to this year grandpa sat down with her and watched an episode or two of Little House or AVONLEA, but she did not have my daughter's interest. She is the Harry Potter child and has read all the books and has all the DVD movies. So I gave her the Books on CDs which she has transferred to her IPOD????
I have purchased most of the American Girl DVDs for my granddaughter but she seems to be too old. Grandpa thinks all five he has watched are great. Kit Kittridge and Molly deal with WWII and being a kid. Felicity and Samantha are set an earlier pre WWI era. The 2009 Chrissa (Stands Alone) movie is super. Parents should watch this movie with their kids (tweens and under) and about bullying which existed in Little House and still exists in schools today. There are so many great reviews for this film, I can add very little. However, parents or parent need to watch this movie and see if their child or children are subject to bullying at school and see if they can help their kid(s) with a solution (not a get even).
My challenge to you is try some of the series I have suggested, but a must is Chrissa. I have not purchased McKenna yet, but it is next on the list. (The family is expecting a new grandchild, a baby girl in March. So Grandpa will still have all his kids movies from Disney to American Girl to watch with her.)

I could cure the current public school crisis by first rolling back the compulsory school age from 16 to 12 and each year after 12 years old or 6th grade, attending a school would be a privilege versus a right. Post sixth Grade Schooling would have four divisions (Academic, Life Skills, Preparatory, and Boot Camp) and moving from division to division would have the attention of parents. Progression would be based on performance versus age and social promotions. Students must be able to read and write at a 12 year old level to live today in our service industries, and high schools do not need classes loaded with non academic kids who can not read or write beyond the sixth grade. I know the majority of the people reading this review disagree and blame our failures on the schools and teachers. In this country we have the community colleges which give those adults a second chance at achieving what education they wasted during their teen age life.  Post 12 year olds if they are not interested in school and their parents don't care, would be apprentices in the work force making little wage. Maybe during their teens they may want to go back to school and want to achieve.

Oh well, this would not work with today's politics and massive testing. So, just give us more G rated movies like the current American Girl series and parents sit down with you preteens and watchg Chrissa.",1358294400,,5382,4.404833836858006

3585446,4,B001FCD252,"I'll bet a lot of parents, especially mothers, can find this movie a little unsettling.  While I don't have kids, all kinds of old fleeting pangs from my 1960's/1970's San Francisco Catholic school days came back.  If you weren't in the ""cool gang"" then, woe betide you, and apparently, that's still the case.

Bravo to AG for producing a well-performed story of ten-year-olds in Minnesota forming a clique and dominating others, while particularly torturing a new girl, Chrissa.

I love the standard stereotypes:  the mean queen bees are two blondes, future Barbie-dolls, with one Indian girl thrown in for diversity.  Then, the newcomer, a classic Irish girl, has dark hair, hence cannot be considered good-looking.  As an Irish-American, I thought she was gorgeous with her hair, skin, smile, freckles and eyes, while the two blondies were the usual boring types all over TV and magazines.  Meanwhile, their teacher is 1. a man; and 2. a mulatto (part black) American.  There are very few blacks in this suburban school, and the only one student I even spotted was the boy who came over to Chrissa's house to play with her older brother.  Throw in that ""skincolor diversity"", whatever you do, in today's film world.

Flipping home stereotypes upside down, her mother is a doctor and her father a stay-at-home ceramics artist, but of course, he looks much older than his doctor-wife.

The acting is very well believable throughout:  her new friend Gwen, ostracized by her poverty and homelessness, is another freckled, Irish-looking beauty, and both girls act out their emotions of sadness and joy professionally.  The older brother, Tyler, in his pre-adolescent shrugging indifference, is also well done.  The nice, cookies-and-mild grandmother, with whom they live, is never upset, and always right about what to do.

FAther and mother remain calm and open to discussion about the kids' problems.  Since my own childhood, these US children's movies wherein the parents never seem to snap, always listen, understand and attend school events - these don't match my own memories or many of my friends.  Apparently the suburban, American-born parents were different, but Italian and Irish immigrant parents as we had did a lot of yelling, were impatient,a nd mainly emphasized staying out of trouble and getting top grades.  Empathy with school bullying?  No use in saying a word at our kind of homes...we knew we were on our own, and muddled through without telling adults.  So for viewers with my kind of upbringing - you know who you are - you can imagine your bemusement at these ideal home scenes.

The school is a public one, with no uniforms, so the kids change their outfits regularly.  A cafetaria provides hot lunches.  The kids don't sit in rows, but in circles.  The building appears to be very new, with a huge swimming pool, and the swimteam coach is the same teacher.  They have official meets with other schools, in team swimming suits, and modern electronic scoreboards.  It looked like a private university level school to me!  We from the big cities can't imagine such luxury - we knew homemade sandwiches for lunch, and a big cement schoolyard for recess and after-school volleyball.  Many schools in SF are still exactly the same now, for lack of space, and so I can imagine some kids finding the school setting and sophistication very enviable.  Not to mention free dress every day!  Practically all public schools in SF, and all private schools, require uniforms.

The actual storyline of Chrissa's battle with the cool girls, with their very vicious attitudes and shenanigans, makes for a good story, until Chrissa tells her parents about her problems.  Then, instead of being told to just ""ignore all that stuff, just make good grades"" (as we were told), her parents got involved.  I was truly hoping for some really clever revenge, not the sappy-happy end with all-men-are-brothers unity and friendship.

TOO UNREAL, sorry!

I recommend this film for its excellent acting, good plot (until the end), and the setting of a modern suburban well-off school.  Parents and kids will enjoy it.

BIG OMISSION:  What WAS at the core of the top queen bee's insecurity, the bee in her bonnet, that made her so atrociously mean?  That was the premise of the art teacher's advice to desperate Chrissa:  see that one should feel sorry for a bully.  It certainly did not seem to me (as a childhood victim myself) that this girl Tara apologized or got put down or in any way truly punished for her bullying.  We do not meet her parents, see her homelife, her academic abilities (only her swimming prowess), so we have no clue as to her motivations.

It would be interesting to see how the future Hitlers and Stalins of the world are formed, rather than always see the victims' lives and points of view.  Perhaps AG can make a different version of this film from the BULLY's point of view.  I still think that in the female department, it's usually money and good looks that make the Tara's of this country dominate the school scene, NOT their insecurities.  Also, what happens later in life - do these former bullies remain so, or become more empathetic?  And how their victims?  Do they become determined not to be dominated again as they grow stronger, wealthier, better-looking; do they become pushy as well, or just give up and continue to give in at the work world, the mothers' meetings, etc.?  Do the daughters of former childhood bullies grow up just the same, and the daughters of the victims become victims themselves?

Interesting speculations for serious viewers of this film:  you will enjoy her FANTASIES of revenge against Tara!",1275609600,3,5653,4.909282700421941

The most powerful messages that children take away from this movie concentrate on the immensity of a bully's power to control, manipulate, and hurt those who get in her way. Even though the point of the movie is to discourage kids from giving in to bullying- the negative power emphasis means that this film may convey the message that going along with bullies is better than fighting against them and that being a bully is the best way to achieve popularity.

While this film does portray a disturbingly honest look at the power of school bullies, the conflict resolution at the end is dangerously unrealistic. When Tara finally confides in parents and teachers about the bullying she is experiencing, the bully automatically looses her power over the entire school and Tara and the bully become friends. Bullies don't just abdicate their thrones because someone tattled. This film reinforced all of the reasons why girls shouldn't talk to their parents about bullying.

3585455,4,B001FCD252,"After reading the reviews by homeschooling mothers, I was pretty leary about this movie but I bought it anyway, and was happily surprised.  As I figured, the reviewers I read had taken some comments out of context, or had simply misunderstood.  The movie does not portray homeschooling negatively at all.  Chrissa considers hs-ing so she doesn't have to face the constant bullying in her classroom.  She wants to escape it.  But others let her know that's no way to deal with the awful situation she finds herself in - escape doesn't solve any problems.  And in fact, as her friends point out, by staying away from school she could find herself falling further behind in her work and letting the bullies win.  Yes, her father does say, ""I'll bet if you're homeschooled, you can't be on the swim team.""  And Chrissa replies, ""Bet you can, too!""  They shake hands as a friendly wager but you don't find out who is right because, of course, Chrissa stays in school.  (As a trivial bit of info, some states have laws that allow homeschooled students to participate in public school sports.  Some don't.) So, enough about the homeschooling aspect of the movie.

The acting is very true to life and the little girl who plays the lead has a great career ahead of her.  Strong supporting adult cast, good cinematography, and an interesting plot keep the movie appealing.  The way the parents dealt with Chrissa's problem, a little too late in the game, in my opinion, was very realistic.  Or at least, they dealt with it the way it should be dealt with.

I think most kids would benefit from watching this movie and seeing how other kids have handled bullying.  It was a relief to know that the script tried to portray how a real kid would feel (""I don't want to be a tattletale!""), and as other reviewers have mentioned, there was no pat resolution, no revenge scene, no concrete answer as to whether Chrissa and Tara became friends.  In other words, it was a true-to-life story.

Then near the end of the movie they said if your homeschooled you will get behind, be dumb AND have no friends. That is a complete lie! I was very upset mostly because about one fourth of the room watching the movie were homeschooled children.

3585475,5,B001FCD252,"I have to admit that I was pretty disappointed to learn that instead of considering a film for a historical American Girl characters like Kirsten or Addy, the company opted to spotlight one of the contemporary ""Girl of the Year"" characters. I didn't really understand or appreciate the fact that they were going for something different when there were plenty of good reasons to write a screenplay about the pioneer era, the Civil War, or New Mexico in the 1800's. However, after watching ""An American Girl: Chrissa Stands Strong,"" the decision seems much more validated, and in fact, this is easily the best film that American Girl has done (which says a lot, considering how much I enjoyed last summer's Great Depression-centered story of Kit Kittredge).

There is a reason why school has become an entirely different and more frightening world for children than it was even just ten years ago. There's a reason why entire seminars have been devoted to training teachers how to be proactive with bullying in today's classrooms. The story of Chrissa--through both the movie and its accompanying books--is ideal for children, parents, and educators to watch together. Believe me, whether you're a kid yourself or someone who works with students on a regular basis, the movie will give you plenty to think about, all told through the eyes of a fictional child who is just one of thousands of targeted students in the real world.

Films about the psychology of female cattiness/bullying have grown considerably more common in recent years, with the made-for-TV film ""Odd Girl Out"" and theatrical semi-classic ""Mean Girls"" exploring the concept in different formats. These movies can represent either drama, comedy or satire, but any girl who has ever gone through those difficult pre-adolescent and teen years know exactly what they're talking about either way.

With the vast majority of these movies, audiences are shown what happens when a triangle develops from one common love interest, and trouble ensues among the females as the Queen Bee feels threatened. Ah yes, it's almost always over a boy, isn't it? One advantage with American Girl's perspective is that they leave the guys out of the picture (in fact, Chrissa's father, classroom teacher/coach, and older brother are the only primary male characters here), focusing instead on the general superficiality and cruelty of younger girls, specifically those in fourth grade. Make no mistake, folks--there is some full-impact bullying that takes place in elementary school, and as a teacher myself, I have watched it take form as early as kindergarten for some children.

Chrissa Maxwell is a sweet, slightly shy 10-year-old girl, whose family decides to move in with her newly widowed grandmother in the middle of the year. The dark side of fourth grade is evident as Chrissa, who is forced to enter a new school, clashes with a trio of ponytail-flipping prima donnas on the very first day. Hiding Chrissa's valentines, pointing and whispering about her in the cafeteria, and stealing her permission slip for the swim team are clearly premeditated acts of cruelty, despite being difficult to prove, but that all becomes pretty trivial when the queen bees--particularly the mean-spirited Tara--drag an innocent Chrissa into trouble with their teachers, the principal, and their swimming teammates. The story becomes even more interesting as Chrissa struggles to befriend a painfully withdrawn classmate named Gwen, who is more concerned about hiding an embarrassing family secret than learning to trust anyone around her. Another unique twist occurs with Sonali, one of the three mean girls, whose character receives more depth and likability as the movie progresses.

A movie like this can't solve everyone's problems, but because it centers around students even younger than the junior high and high school crowd, it proves to be very relevant and even profound for elementary-aged kids. Chrissa's circumstances are set up in a very believable way (not an easy feat when transferring a story like this to film), allowing viewers to consider how they themselves might handle the same things in their own lives. Instead of just settling for a cutesy, unrealistic little children's flick, the writers portrayed some very real school-related issues in a way that makes sense to children, without undermining the incredible pain that students go through when they feel threatened and alone. The movie also expresses whether keeping quiet and attempting to cope with such problems alone are really even worth the trouble--questions that are more easily answered when we see how Chrissa's silence worsens her situation.

One of the biggest criticisms about this movie seems to stem from the final 10-15 minutes, as we find out how the script has chosen to resolve the problem. Ultimately, it was the best direction that American Girl could take without missing the mark with its intended audience. Before you assume that the ending was too rushed or unrealistic, understand that this really was not the film's intent. It is important to look closely at where Chrissa's story concludes, and how her life is impacted by the choices she makes in the end. Examining the bigger picture will bring a fresher, more honest element to the movie, especially if you watch carefully to find the underlying purpose of it (which doesn't necessarily promote becoming ""best buddies"" with the classmates who bullied you in the past). It emphasizes how children's school lives can be improved when they make smart decisions and ask for help, and when you think about it, that's one of the best things to share with children who are dealing with these kinds of issues.

Almost everything about this movie seems incredibly well-done and properly scripted. All of the actors do their jobs on the screen, giving the film a lot of heart and substance. Sammi Hanratty--whom I haven't seen since she starred as Lacey Chabert's kid sister on the ABC Family film ""Hello Sister, Goodbye Life""--really surprised me with how effectively she was able to carry the title role. With her infectious smile and generous personality, Chrissa won me over as one of the most lovable American Girls, and Hanratty was an excellent choice for a character with qualities that any parent would want in their own children. Adair Tishler is somewhat obnoxious as the ever-nasty Tara, but to be fair to her, she was given a role that is known to be overdone in the media. Even Rachel McAdams laid it on pretty thick with her character in ""Mean Girls,"" not because she was a poor actress (quite the opposite, actually), but because the script called on her to express a ""larger than life"" maliciousness. And hey, maybe I've just been out of elementary school for too long, and maybe girls exactly like Tara (or worse) really do exist, even if they are rare.

The rest of the cast is very good, and again, Ariela Barer gets one of the best roles in the movie, seeing as her character undergoes several transformations from one scene to the next. Kaitlyn Dever is another adorable, charismatic young actress who skillfully depicted Gwen's unfortunate circumstances in life, despite being a fairly inexperienced actress. I will definitely be watching for her in the future. I also enjoyed the performance of Jennifer Tilly, who had a smaller role as Chrissa's quirky, yet caring art teacher.

More than anything else, though, I loved how Chrissa's family was portrayed. One of the movie's greatest highlights was how a loving home life is often the only thing a child can count on when things are so difficult and unpredictable at school. Chrissa has distinct, positive relationships with everyone in her family and is able to draw comfort through online and telephone conversations with a close friend from her former school. Finding a safe haven at home is a piece of fortune that not every child is afforded, but as parents watch this with their kids, it's just another worthwhile message that is there for the taking.

The film selects certain themes to emphasize more closely, as do all the ""school bullying"" movies out there, and ultimately, Chrissa's story encourages targeted youngsters to confide in a trusted adult instead of suffering through it by themselves. Many movies of this type tend to send mixed messages to kids by showing them that even if they do finally tell a parent or teacher what's going on, those adults don't really have the power to stop the bullying that goes on behind their backs. It is alarming to think that some of today's children might be being taught to keep quiet and believe that they cannot count on anyone to help them when things get really bad. Fortunately, this movie offers a perfect example of loving and attentive parents, as well as school staff/administration that actually do their jobs instead of just ""talking the talk."" We also get to see them actually address the problems immediately, without just waiting for it to get better on its own (something that happens way too often). It is empowering to see this, and I give American Girl a lot of credit for putting that out there. Adults can learn just as much from this as the kids, if not more.

The unfortunate problem with the American Girl movies is that, despite being very entertaining and wholesome for young children, their audience isn't as vast as it deserves to be. An attempt was made during the summer of 2008 to change that when Kit's movie was developed for theaters, but in the end, it wasn't much more successful than the straight-to-DVD releases from the past. The company has obviously decided to take a little break from the more historical characters, which may be for the best, since the story of Chrissa arguably has had a more timely and relatable lesson to share with kids. It's been rumored that the next film from American Girl will focus on 1970's-era Julie, whose on-screen tale will be written as a musical. Given the phenomenal success of ""Hairspray"" and ""High School Musical"" in recent years, this may be just the thing to help American Girl improve its movies.

I recommend this highly as an entertaining, educational film and powerful source of discussion for children and adults alike. It's absolutely worth purchasing for your DVD collection at home, but you may also consider renting it first, just in case. Stories like this have been told before, sure, but since the problem shows no signs of stopping in our schools, then it's not time to stop delivering the message.",1234310400,18,10512,4.997144488863507
3585476,5,B001FCD252,My girls (ages 11 and 8) greatly enjoyed this movie. It mirrors many of the experiences they face in school today and offered a respectable way of handling these problems. It was refreshing to watch an appropriate movie for girls this age.,1234137600,,239,4.714285714285714

I really, really hope there will be more of these movies made. I would especially like to see, Addie's story made into a movie.
Currently I teach a (girls) single gender class in a city in a poverty area, and the movies are used as teaching tools, not just for entertainment.
Everyone encounters bullies somewhere in their school setting, learning how to deal with this kind of pressure is very important.",1233964800,,618,4.731481481481482

3585480,5,B001FCD252,"I watched this movie from the viewpoint of a teacher, a mother, and a person who still remembers the sting of being a target back in her own school days.  The main fear I had, and that my own students have expressed to me, was that speaking up would bring about the label of ""tattle-tale"".  The movie, and the companion books, address the difference between ""tattling"" and ""telling"" very impressively.
  Yes, as other reviewers have pointed out, this movie has intense moments.  Bullies ARE intense in what they do; they are not just fooling around when they set out to make someone's life miserable.  I think this movie should be viewed by young girls with their parents, and I would also recommend it for any classroom or church library.",1233100800,,739,4.689922480620155
3585481,5,B001FCD252,"My 11-year-old daughter (a major American Girl fan) and I watched this on HBO.  We thought it was a good movie that addressed bullying of young girls fairly well.  I've read comments from people (at this web site and others) who felt the movie was too intense, with very few ""light"" moments.  I believe the movie was fairly accurate in its portrayal of the bullying that goes on at some schools.  Although many young girls (8 and under) enjoy American Girl products, the books/movies are geared toward ages 9-12.  I felt this movie was very appropriate for that age group.  Bullying is a true problem, and it never has a simple fix.  This movie showed how a new girl at school suffered bullying at the expense of a ""mean girl"" trio.  She tried to handle it on her own, and the situation grew worse.  Only when she sought help from an adult did her situation improve.  I think this teaches girls a GREAT lesson:  If they cannot work out a problem on their own, they can seek help from someone they know and trust, such as a parent, grandparent, friend's parent, teacher, etc.  Girls are too young to solve all problems on their own, and they need to know that it is acceptable to seek help when needed.  By the way, the movie did end on a ""happy note.""",1233100800,,1251,4.4104803493449785
3585482,5,B001FCD252,"This is a great movie.  The message about bullying is clear - kids have to tell an adult about what is going on, and not try to handle the bullying on their own. However, there are some very intense scenes, and one in particular where the bully stabs Chrissa in the back with a sharp pencil.  I knew from previews there was a lot of the typical verbal abuse, and even cyberbullying involved, but neither me nor my 7 year old daughter expected there to be a physical assault.  Yikes, it freaked me out, and even my husband a little. So, watch this movie, but don't let your kids watch it alone, at least the first time.  Be ready to talk about it.  It's worth it.",1232668800,,662,4.222222222222222

It is a wonderful opportunity to talk about the situations in the movie.  If your child is being bullied, or is seeing it happen to another child, they may be encouraged in that moment to talk to you about it.  In response to the reviewer that said to only rent it...we did but now I am going to buy it.  We watched it twice while we had it rented and I am positive my daughter will watch it over and over.  Eventhough it is a ""girl"" movie, I would encourage those families with sons to watch it as well.  I will be recommending it to all of my daughters' friends to watch.",1232409600,,833,4.061349693251533
3585484,5,B001FCD252,"I have never written a review before. After seeing this movie on HBO, I had to have it. I came to Amazon (best and first place to look for nearly anything), and when I read one review that said they could only give the movie 1 star because of the content, ""The bully is relentless and very mean. So, just be warned..."" I knew I had to write something.

If you've never seen, or been party to bullying in school, then this movie might seem tough to watch. But my own experience in school was much longer, with much worse events of meanness and cruelty than depicted here. In my estimation, they did a marvelous job of creating scenarios to show the type and depth of stunts children can pull, without making it too traumatic to watch. I was bullied as a new girl for 3 years, 4th to 6th grades. As I watched this movie, it was indeed difficult, but I could not turn away. I thought several times, ""I remember how that felt, but what could I do?"" As another reviewer reflected, I'd seen other movies address it as comedy, nasty parents and mean kids get their due in the end, and I know in real life, that is NO solution.

When the tide began to turn, and I saw how the insightful adults intervened in Chrissa's life, and gave useful & credible advice, I began to cry. When I saw how she then began to handle the situation, it was the first time in all my 44 years I realized there really had been something that could have been done in my case. There really ARE ways to deal with the issue that are not stupid or demeaning, but truly constructive for ALL parties concerned.

So sure, perhaps you might rent this movie first. But share it with every child or parent you know. You may well never know when some poor child is subjected to this... I never told a soul until I was 30 years old. Any person who is bullied, who bullies, or who sees it happening to others should have this glimpse into the real issues and real options regarding such vicious behavior.",1232323200,6,1959,4.289189189189189

With that support and upbringing, she was able to handle the relentless teasing the bullies dished out.
