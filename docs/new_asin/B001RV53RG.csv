8338985,5,B001RV53RG,This is one of the scariest movies that I love. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman are great. Would recommend this one.,1398556800,,113,4.428571428571429
8338986,1,B001RV53RG,"1080i???  Really?  Recomposed for 16:9???  Really?  No subtitles?  Really?  AND it's an old, crummy transfer (not from the silver-retention print Criterion used on the DVD)???  What the heck did I just buy?  Well, as far as I can tell, this is probably a copy of the pay-per-view version you'd see on HBO.  I just wasted almost 30 bucks on this coffee table coaster.  Because that's all it's good for.  What a let down.  I wish they had put the specs up about this disc first.  I certainly would not have purchased it if I had known.",1267488000,16,533,4.427083333333333
8338987,3,B001RV53RG,"I recently got the canadian version of Se7en on Blu-Ray and was disappointed - wrong aspect ratio (1,78:1) and an average picture quality. But today I got a regioncodefree version of Se7en in the Netherlands and got completely satisfied! right aspect ratio of 2,35:1, english DTS-HD master track, and a really good quality. Sometimes it's useful to access the international markets ;-)",1259107200,3,385,5.225806451612903

8338989,5,B001RV53RG,"The movie is great in blu-ray, but unfortunately the surround sound didn't work and had to revert to 2 Channel.  Still a great movie and as is usually the case, the surround sound will probably work with follow-on playings.",1241308800,,223,4.717948717948718
8338990,5,B001RV53RG,"This Blu-Ray disc of ""Seven"" is a bare bones imported release of the film only, with no menus or extras, that features only DTS English, Dolby 5.1 English, and Dolby 2.0 French audio tracks, and no subtitles. It is framed at 1:78, cropped in from the original 2:35 aspect ratio, and is in 1080i/60 not 1080p/24 with an AVC codec.

It appears to be a release, in the Canadian market, of a transfer originally made, one might guess, for HDTV pay per view, or some such thing. That said, contrary to what some disgruntled reviewers have written, the image is outstanding, within the limits mentioned above, with good luminance, which is very superior to the DVD version, excellent color and very sharp detail. The text of the opening credits have been repositioned to appear correctly in the reduced aspect ratio, which supports the idea that the transfer was originally made by the studio for HDTV.

Obviously, there are some compromises here. But considering that this is a fantastic film, that is currently unavailable in the US market, and which has not been announced for the US market any time soon, this is a great Blu-Ray disc to have of this film. Obviously, some overseas distributors are interpreting their contracts with the US studios to mean that if they can issue a DVD of a title in their territory then they can issue a Blu-Ray too. I would imagine there may have been some lively conversations about this implied right between the parties involved. Nevertheless, I would recommend this edition of ""Seven"" until an authorized US version comes along with menus, the complete extras, and all the audio/subtitle tracks.",1238544000,7,1630,4.859712230215828
8338991,5,B001RV53RG,"I already own this on blu Ray, i bought it from amazon.ca
the movie seven is a great movie but this blu ray from (Alliance) is  very low quality 1080i, seems like an upscaled dvd and trasfered to blu ray",1236556800,2,203,4.075
8338992,2,B001RV53RG,"I happened to find this title by accident as I was hoping for a U.S. release at some time. Seven was filmed in 2.35:1 aspect ratio, this disc unfortunately has been framed to 1.85:1 or 16:9, shame as you can tell the difference, especially in the grain. Only plus factor on this disc is the DTS-HD Master audio, however if I remember right my New Line DVD edition had a discrete 6.1 soundtrack ! I just hope Criterion bring out their version on Blu Ray just like the old laserdisc silver print edition.",1236556800,4,502,4.408602150537634
8338993,5,B001RV53RG,"I am adding this short review because the only other review at this time is a one star review that is not relevant to the film.

I am highly anticipating the release of this movie on Blu-Ray.  It is a well-directed and acted film.  This is a movie I can watch several times and still enjoy it.  If you like crime thrillers, then this movie is one for your collection.",1235433600,2,367,4.2
