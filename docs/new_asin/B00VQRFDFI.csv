So I took gamble and ordered the DVD.  I couldn't make it past the first 10 minutes.  I found it entirely unwatchable. Sad.",1437955200,,286,4.2407407407407405
7101090,5,B00VQRFDFI,"I saw this movie in the theater in 1962. The Berlin wall went up a year before. When this happened it shocked the world. I was 15 years old at the time and never imagined that in my life time that the wall would come down. I just happened to stumble across this movie on Amazon, never imagining that it would ever be released on DVD. To me, this movie is a historical document of the history of my life time and is a much welcome addition to my movie library.",1432771200,11,459,4.054945054945055

8710976,5,B00VQRFDFI,"PLOT: East Germans dig their way to under the Wall to West Germany and freedom.

1962~ Berlin is a divided City with the West living in luxury and freedom. East Germany is under Communist domination and life grinds away with poverty and BOMBED out buildings. The Wall is there to keep the East Germans escaping to West Germany.  Gunther Jurgena  lives in poverty in East Germany and dreams of escaping. He takes a tow truck and ramps through the Wall and is shot for his attempts. His sister Erika (CHRISTINE KAUFMANN) goes looking for him at a co workers home....Kurt Schroder (DON MURRY). Kurt keeps her from making a very failed escape attempt under barb wire and she ends up having to stay at their house til dark. The discussion in the Schroder house is HOW to get across to the WEST.  When Kurt shows them a possible exit being a tunnel dug from their basement under the Wall. Soon the entire Schroder family and Erika and a neighbor are busy drilling into a wall with a BAND practice covering the noise. Over the next week the tunnel is longer. Added to the thrills are a nosey man (WERNER KLEMPER) who suddenly makes every effort to get close to every member of the Schroder family and the constant Boarder/Wall Guards just outside the home. When rain and damaged phone cables speed up the need to finish the tunnel. a ""tip off "" has the local security military police headed to the Schroder Home to pickup Kurt. This is a very good movie. Christine Kaufmann is excellent as the innocent girl Erika and Don Murray pulls off the ladies man Kurt who makes the family plan of escape possible. This was shot on location in Berlin and is very well done. Plot and acting are very good and the thrilling final escape are first rate. BASED on a real life story of escape. This MGM print is very good. 5 STARS~",1453507200,2,1809,4.472727272727273
