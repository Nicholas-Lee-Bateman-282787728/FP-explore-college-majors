Arthur is an immaculate human being and one we can all learn from. Appropriate for ages 8 and up. We watched it with our children, ages 8 and 9, this week and it was brilliant. They had so many poignant and thoughtful observations. Love, love love.",1384128000,2,381,4.352112676056338
8052629,5,B0007WFXRQ,"A wonderful video for all to see. Production
was excellent as were the characters and story.
A story that a lot of us can relate to, either
by our heritage or family ties to the past.",1251072000,2,183,4.111111111111111
8052630,5,B0007WFXRQ,"This insightful documentary is about history and how it intersects with the present. But at its core it is a real-life drama about people....two people coming together despite the many differences between them. The filmmakers let the people tell the story, and that's what a good documentary is all about.",1137974400,6,305,5.12
8052631,5,B0007WFXRQ,"In an age when faith is pitted against faith and power is wielded with impunity, ""Facing Arthur"" is a welcome antidote to the presumptive arrogance of self-virtue.

  Arthur and his young German friend muster the courage to look at themselves, their pasts and their histories. More than a tale of a Jew and a German, here humanity is put to the test, and emerges the victor.",1118016000,6,374,4.636363636363637
8052632,5,B0007WFXRQ,"A very different perspective on the Holocaust than has ever been shown before.  Arthur is a remarkable character who challenges the way we think about history, art/music and life.  Best of all he challenges the German boy in the film giving us a glimpse into the burden of the Nazi legacy that young Germans have been left to bear.

This film would be a good introduction to the Holocaust for young people who know little about the Holocaust or have never met a survivor.  Should be shown in schools.",1117929600,8,500,4.584269662921348
