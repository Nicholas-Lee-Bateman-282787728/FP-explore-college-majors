5562343,4,B00B7U2GCC,This is the first Dawn Patrol and hence a classic Given the time and date of production the flying sequences are very good. Unfortunately the aircraft have only a vague resemblance to Neiuport 28's which would be all wrong for the RAF. The acting is rather stilted and the squadron commander is definitely little johnny one note. That one note being petulant and angry.,1422921600,3,369,4.78125
5562344,3,B00B7U2GCC,Some of these actors need to go to acting school.  They clearly overdid the facial expressions failed in their attempts to portray severely stressed RFC pilots.  At one point I couldn't help thinking that the cast in the last school play in my children's school did a more believable job of acting. Good for a laugh though.,1418428800,,323,4.649122807017544

5562346,4,B00B7U2GCC,"This early actioner, telling the story of pilots in WW1, is well directed by Hawks (as always), but the script is too talky. The technique
wasn't ready at that time, to solve the problems in the air. Interesting anyway.",1398124800,,219,4.641025641025641
5562347,5,B00B7U2GCC,"There's more talking than flying in this great old film, but the brief air combat episodes are worth waiting for... wonderful scenes of pilots in their Nieuport 28s gunning and blipping the engines prior to takeoff at dawn, banking and zooming against DVIIs, and yawing and side slipping in to land. WWI and classic aero buffs will like this movie.",1380672000,6,348,4.816666666666666
5562348,4,B00B7U2GCC,"While acknowledging the often stiff and stuffy elements of the story and action, I found myself deeply involved with the characters. Barthelmess is a little stiff, but Douglas Fairbanks Jr is great as a fearless ace in this WW I film. The flimsy airplanes that visibly wobble in the wind are the real thing, as are the great dogfights. One major drawback is the image quality-very soft and muddy.",1377388800,3,396,4.753623188405797
5562349,5,B00B7U2GCC,"This is a great movie about how responsibility weighs harder on the shoulders of those who get stuck with it....

It's interesting to see the 1930 original when the 1938 Errol Flynn remake is so much easier to get hold of (many of the flying sequences in this movie were reused in 1938).
It's also interesting to see the take on the Great War in the air as shown in films like this, also Wings and Hells Angels......
brilliant stunt flying - and who knew that France looked so much like Southern California? ;-)
This is a good movie.",1375142400,,533,4.383838383838384
5562350,5,B00B7U2GCC,"Warner Bros. remade THE DAWN PATROL in 1938 and that version, directed by Edmund Goulding and starring Errol Flynn, David Niven and Basil Rathbone has become a great classic.  However, this earlier version is a worthy film too, and it supplied most of the air combat footage that was reused in the 1938 version.

The 1930 version was directed by Howard Hawks and stars Richard Barthelmess, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., and Neil Hamilton.  That such a film could be stashed in the Warner closet when the newer version was released can only be explained by one consideration: money.  They didn't want the older film competing with the newer one with the newer stars.  When Warner Home Video released the 1938 version on DVD I was really surprised that they didn't include the 1930 version.  Now, at last, we have the 1930 version too on the Warner Archive label.  I could wish for a full restoration, but I'm thankful to have it at all.

The films are so similar that they are often confused.  The dialogue is almost line for line the same and, as I've already pointed out, much of the combat and location footage from the 1930 version was reused in the 1938 version.  But they do have differences too, which makes a comparison interesting.

The story concerns young officers of the Royal Flying Corps (the RAF of the day) flying fragile planes into combat, frequently with very little training.  The original title of the story was THE FLIGHT COMMANDER and it is very much about the emotional toll taken on the young commander (Hamilton) stuck in a desk job sending other young men into combat when he'd much rather be going with them.  As the story progresses promotion or death causes the command to be passed from one character to another and each has to deal with the impossible situation in his own way.

The cast of the 1938 version had appropriate British accents (a bit Aussie in Flynn's case) which helps to establish that this is a British squadron.  However, the 1930 cast, though decidedly American, is mostly younger.  (Actually, Barthelmess was 35, Flynn was 28, but Barthelmess looks younger.) They give a strong image of the very young men, barely more than boys, who were caught up in the horror of an unexpectedly modern war.",1373068800,7,2237,4.72680412371134

8563722,5,B00B7U2GCC,"Because it was made in 1930, it was close enough to World War I that it portrays the life in a British fighter squadron almost identically to my own research in Oswald Boelcke: Germany's First Fighter Ace and Father of Air Combat.  I wuld recommend this video highly. Made with a great deal of integrity. rg",1473897600,,307,4.482142857142857

8563724,5,B00B7U2GCC,"A great movie, it amazed me how the same script could have such a different feel to it.  I bought it because of the larger number of scenes with original Nuieport 28's and the thought that Udet and Nungesser had flown as stunt pilots.  The second Dawn Patrol with Errol Flynn has always been right up there with The Battle of Britain, WIngs and Hells Angels as my favorites, this one is just another to add to that list",1454025600,,419,4.291139240506329
