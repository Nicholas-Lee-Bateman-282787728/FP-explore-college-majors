He was so far ahead of his time that he was intimidating to some who lean towards the more simple and clear-cut.  The reputed hidden messages ranging from hidden treasure to sex continue to interest and plague Verne enthusiasts.

8263551,5,B0016NJ4U2,"Jules Verne had some extraordinary voyages alright...and not just through his fiction. His life was riddled with mystery & genuine adventure, and it was wonderful to get a very intimate look into his darker life--the life not often spoken of.

8263552,4,B0016NJ4U2,Having been a fan of Jules Verne's work I watched this video with great interest. Some of the greatest works of art come from tortured souls and this seems to be the case here. From a troubled childhood to secrets he took to his grave this video gives great insight into the man behind the masterpieces.,1358380800,,303,4.428571428571429

8263556,4,B0016NJ4U2,"Lots of people--me included--think of Jules Verne as one of the fathers of science fictions, but this documentary says he was not about fiction at all when he could avoid it, but considered himself a scientist. It also asserts that some of his ideas are thought to be stolen. It traces his life all the way from an abusive childhood.",1216425600,,333,4.566666666666666
