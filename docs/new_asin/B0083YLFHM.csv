8525257,3,B0083YLFHM,"I tried, I really did.  But every time I'm drawn back to this series by some intriguing characters and interesting plots, I'm repelled by the unappealing characters and the soap-opera elements.  So I can only ever manage to last a few episodes at a time.

The premise of The Tribe is simple enough.  All adults have been killed off by a virus and the children band together into tribes for survival.  This is post-apocalyptic drama in a mostly urban setting, then, with a touch of dystopia.  The challenges of day-to-day living in such an environment are difficult enough, but the characters (mostly teenagers) are also faced with religious fanatics, oppressive governments and manipulative leaders, to say nothing of their endless personal dramas.

The heroes of the story are the Mall Rats, a tribe who live, as you might have guessed, in a mall.  They're joined in their fight to live a decent life, free of oppression, by members of other tribes and a few free agents and opposed, in these later series, by the militaristic Technos who have conquered the city with their technology.

There are some good parts to The Tribe.  The wider plots, which concern political intrigue and shifting loyalties with a strong science fiction element, are inventive and genuinely interesting and they're reasonably well handled despite the budgetary constraints.  A certain suspension of disbelief is required, but I'd rather do that and have that science fiction than watch a show limited to who's got enough food and who's sleeping with whom this week.  Certain difficult elements, such as violence, alcohol abuse and sexual behaviour, are included in the plot without being glamorised or used as an opportunity for preaching.  A few characters are well worth a look.  Ram (Tom Hearne) is creepily charismatic as the now ex-leader of the Technos and had a more interesting motivation than your average villain; his rehabilitation from this point onwards is well handled.  Lex (Caleb Ross) veers between hero and villain, a Mall Rat whose heart might be in the right place, but who is frequently undone by his appetites.  Slade (Matt Robinson) is a wild card whose hidden motives propel him from loner to reluctant leader in the fight to bring down the Technos once and for all.

But there's a lot that's bad about The Tribe, too.  With the exception of the individuals mentioned above and Meryl Cassie (Ebony), the acting isn't strong, though the cast isn't helped by the requirement to adopt American accents.  The soap opera comes close to overwhelming the main plot at times and since I didn't actually care who was sleeping with whom, I found those parts really boring.  Some of the characters are irritating beyond belief (Gel and Sammy, I'm looking at you), some are stupid beyond belief (Amber, take a bow) and some are truly slutty (that would be you, Jay).  There never seems to be a shortage of hair dye, make-up and new clothes despite the complete and utter breakdown of the capitalist-industrial complex, and small details such as where the food comes from are skated over.  The main characters often speak in a very adult manner, which doesn't always sit well with their ages or the drama at hand.  The constant use of the same few scene-setting shots each time the action shifts becomes maddening (did the director really think we wouldn't know we were inside the mall or Ruby's saloon after a few episodes?) and hearing the same irritating music swell every single time the drama hits a peak leads to the desire to put my foot through the TV.

Another point: I really didn't like the portrayal of females in The Tribe.  I'm sure the writers didn't intend to portray females as inferior, but somehow that's exactly what they ended up doing.  Technology is a male preserve, males hold almost all leadership positions and the plot to bring down the Technos is mostly driven by men.  Females are far more passive, even when theoretically in a leadership role, they give the males advice and encouragement and serve as their consciences, and they play nice for the sake of getting along.  Their concern for the men in their lives is at times stronger than their concern for the big issues; witness Trudi and Amber's agonising over Jay, for example, just when the crisis with Mega and the Technos is coming to a head.  Even Ebony, not always admirable but worthy of respect for her brains, her force of character and her refusal to be beholden to anyone, starts whining that she's tired of being betrayed by men and just wants one to love her.

Ultimately, this is a show that I watched more for what it could have been than what it actually was.  You may like it a lot more than I did, especially if you're a younger viewer and you're a fan of the post-apocalyptic genre.",1349049600,,4773,4.791208791208791
