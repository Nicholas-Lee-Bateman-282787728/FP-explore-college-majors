208283,5,6300132838,"I LOVE this movie!  I have had it on vhs since it first came out.

Reed Birney is adoribly innocent & dorky playing Vic in the lead role.  But Brion James & Paul Smith stole the show playing the pest patrol baddies...getting rid of pesty people too.  The cast is sweet, but the comedy is a silly dark crazy adventure.  This movie is a classic funny movie.  If you haven't seen it, give it a try...it'll be a dorky zanie ride!  Even my 78 year old dad loved it for laughs, and he's got every new movie released!",1093132800,4,510,4.142857142857143

FYI, this is one of the earlier movies by the director of last year's blockbuster, Spider-Man.",1046908800,,300,4.375
208285,3,6300132838,"Sam Raimi is the man. SPIDER-MAN surpassed just about everyone's predictions and is the biggest hit of the year (2002) so far (HARRY POTTER and THE TWO TOWERS may knock Spidey off, though). However, Raimi always was the man. He, Rob Tapert, and Bruce Campbell parlayed their little independent film (EVIL DEAD) into a great franchise and used it to start their careers.
CRIMEWAVE was the first major feature for all involved after EVIL DEAD.  The film was written by Raimi and two other quirky directors, the Coen Brothers. The movie was largely filmed in Detroit and the lead character was originally written specifically for Bruce Campbell (you can just picture how much better the movie would have been with Campbell in the lead role instead of the no name they cast instead). However, that was before Tinsletown took over. Campbell was scrapped as the lead, but Raimi kept him on in a supporting role. A new beginning and ending was filmed because ""audiences just won't get it otherwise"" and Raimi and company lost some editing control over the final product. The film was also plagued by all sorts of conflicts and from what I've gathered wasn't the most pleasant of shoots.
The end result is CRIMEWAVE, a quirky little dark comedy that if left alone would have been much better. The movie itself is full of humor on a variety of levels. The direction is intriguing and the acting is campy. The film would probably be PG by todays standards and only contains a handful of ""foul"" language and largely ""cartoon"" violence.
If you are a fan of Raimi, the Coens, or Campbell, this film is a must see. Also, if you like dark comedies full of slapstick humor you will probably enjoy it.",1036281600,13,1684,4.708474576271186
208286,5,6300132838,"This is one of my all-time favorite comedies.  Louise Lasser and Sam Raimi have gone out of their way to make this film look as much like a cardboard box-propped B movie as you could get.  So it's cheap!  Hurray for this kind of cheap!  What is the era?  It has the feel of a mid-60's film, but with a splash of early 80's and mid-40's hair styles, huge clunky 70's tuna boat cars in close up scenes and 50's style automobiles packed in a few outside scenes, with big band swing music from the early 20th century.  This movie capitalizes on sheer stupidity and pulls it off rather well.  Don't expect an ""Airplane"" or ""Naked Gun"" brand of foolishness.  This is in a class all it's own.  I wish there were other films like this.  My heart was broken to find that the only DVD it is available on is a region 2 coded European disc with no English option.  Watch this film only if you enjoy lame comedy and don't mind laughing at things that make other people think you're not playing with a full deck.",1024012800,5,998,4.25531914893617

208290,4,6300132838,"This flick is an oldy but a goody. An early (1985) Raimi vehicle featuring his favorite chin (Bruce Campbell) and favorite car (73 Olds Delta 88), about a young lovestruck wanna-be hero (Vic Ajax played by Reed Birney) who saves a beautiful young woman (Nancy played by Sheree J. Wilson) from the hands of an uncaring heel (Bruce) as well as a pair of psychopathic pest exterminators (Arthur and Faron played by Brion James and Paul L. Smith respectively).  For all that they were the bad guys of the story, Arthur and Faron were by far my favorite characters as they were so completely over the top.

The overall tone of this is mixed horror and slapstick comedy and from one scene to the next you never quite know what old film is being spoofed or what crazy Raimi-signature camera gimmick is going to be employed.

208294,4,6300132838,"The film itself does not hold up very well. It moves along in fits and starts, but it's a terrific time capsule, where the makers of EVIL DEAD make the transition from home-movies shot off the back of a dime to working with a real, if low, budget. The talent on display is undeniable with Raimi foreshadowing the kinetic style that would become his hallmark. There are some laughs to be had, especially if you like screwball comedies. Certainly, if you're a fan of the Three Stooges you'll enjoy it more than most. Where this Shout Factory release really shines is in its extras. Bruce Campbell commentaries are almost always entertaining and this one is no exception. There is also a filmed interview with Mr. Campbell that encapsulates the horrific experience of working with a Hollywood studio, albeit a small one, and dealing with the dramas and demands that go along with it. If you are a student of film or a student filmmaker, particularly if you are starry-eyed and looking to make it in the big-time, purchasing this disc is a no-brainer and serves as a nice little cautionary tale. The film itself rates maybe 2.5 out of 5, but this disc, the quality of the transfer and the supplemental material bumps it up to 4.",1374624000,,1224,4.645161290322581
208295,5,6300132838,"Here's something you should know about the new release of Sam Raimi's CRIMEWAVE, folks:

As Far as I know, and according to Bruce Campbell's commentary, this film was never actually (or at least widely) released in movie theaters.  We all caught up with this on tape and on cable, back in the 1980s.  I still have my VHS copy, which I've watched at least 20-30 times over the years, it being one of my very favorite Raimi Movies.  I'm the guy who can literally quote chapter and verse from the dialogue.  You need to now this about me, because today I ran the SHOUT! FACTORY Buy-ray edition for the first time (a thing of real beauty!), and it turns out this is sourced from a print that is actually more than SIX MINUTES longer than the version I've known and loved for so long.  While not pointed out in the packaging, advertising, or even in Campbell's commentary, there are two scene extensions and one entire five minute sequence that were cut from the original release version, and appear here for the VERY FIRST TIME in darn-near 30 years.  For die-hard fans, these scenes are as follows:

At 42:29, there is an additional bit of dialogue as Nancy complains about her bad night with Vic, just before she's hit with the mud.

At 51:51, there is an entire additional scene that last almost five minutes, depicting Vic returning to the apartment and being ""rejected"" by Nancy, who he can't really see, because she's behind a door, bound and gaged by Arthur Coddish.  Vic then walks out of her apartment, glum and rejected.  It's actually a crucial missing bit in the film, kind of the turning point, in which Vic thinks he's been spurned by the girl of his dreams, but of course it's one big ""bedroom farce-style"" misunderstanding.  In the original release cut (and also in this version), the deleted scene is later referenced on the bridge, just after the film's climax, when Vic says ""I went in your room and thought you didn't care about me.""  I always wondered what he was talking about back in the day, because that scene NEVER HAPPENED in the original release version.

And, finally, at 1:11.04 . . . there is a final scene extension, just before Arthur Coddish is killed, when Vic tries to trick him before the overpass hits.  I won't spoil it, but it's a pretty lame joke.

Groovy!

208296,4,6300132838,"I know lots of people hated the movie, and from the special edition contents here, sounds like the filmmakers themselves hated it. I for one still remember fondly the day i saw it when it first came out, and having seen it again just a few days ago, i think it hasn't lost any of its raw energy and fun. Is it a great film? No. Is it creative, energetic and fun to watch? Yes. Paradox? Yes.",1370995200,,390,4.077922077922078
208297,4,6300132838,"although the extras (interviews, etc.) were a nice addition, one cannot truly give this movie the  5 stars that it deserves, no matter how much it reflects Sam Raimi at his prime, because we all know that the poor director did not have final cut (not to mention final decision making on originally casting Cambell as the lead, and instead being pushed in the face with an total no-name, whatever the studios were thinking!) and if it took them this long to finally release this classic, and made it a BluRay/DVD combo (which is nothing more than paying extra for the same damn movie!) they might as well have given Raimi the opportunity to whip out a director's cut rather than just releasing it in the supposedly inferior studio's cut. At least we finally got the movie, but a missed opportunity, truly.",1370649600,,804,4.661971830985915
208298,3,6300132838,"After making a name for himself with the success of 1983's ""The Evil Dead,"" Sam Raimi teamed up with pals Robert Tapert, Bruce Campbell and a pair of fellow filmmaker friends - Joel and Ethan Coen, the former having worked on ""Evil Dead"" - for the ill-fated 1986 release ""Crimewave.""

With ""Crimewave,"" Raimi opted to break away from gore and make a movie ""everyone could see."" Taking a page (kinda) from the Coen Brothers and their debut picture, ""Blood Simple,"" Raimi and the Coens concocted a zany affair that would utilize a pulpy plot involving a businessman trying to kill off his business partner, a pair of pet exterminators (""Popeye""'s Paul L. Smith and ""Blade Runner""'s Brion James) attempting to carry out the murder, and a nerdy employee ultimately framed for the crime.

It might sound like something out of the Coen playbook, but ""Crimewave"" is really a cartoon - a manic, live-action, in-your-face cartoon with over-the-top humor and performances that certainly won't be for every viewer's taste (in fact, with a few more broadly-played gags, this could've done for pulp fiction what the ZAZ crew did to the disaster genre with ""Airplane!"" several years prior). Bruce Campbell generates a few laughs in a supporting role as an obnoxious heel, yet Bruce was supposed to be playing the film's centerpiece role - just one of many areas where studio interference from Embassy Pictures and its then owner, Norman Lear, caused a great deal of problems for Raimi and his crew.

Maybe it's just the passage of time at play but I recall finding ""Crimewave"" to be a lot  funnier back when I was in high school. These days, its manic sensibilities come off as strident and overpowering (a little bit goes a long way), so I found the most enjoyable element of Shout's new Blu-Ray/DVD package to be its special features.

Bruce Campbell's on-camera interview and commentary track, moderated by DVD extras guru Michael Felsher, are both hugely entertaining, not to mention insightful for any aspiring filmmaker. Bruce isn't afraid to dissect the film's problematic shoot and divulges countless anecdotes throughout the course of the track, while the trailer and a respectable 1080p transfer round out the combo pack.",1367539200,,2217,4.997289972899729

I understand that it's spoofing cartoons and old crime films.

208300,5,6300132838,"This is the movie that explains everything that Sam Raimi and the Coen Brothers have done afterward.
Lines from Crimewave wind up getting quoted in their other films, and even in Xena:  Warrior Princess.
They borrow from this movie in setting up others; for example, their first use of ""Hudsucker"" is as the penitentiary in Crimewave.

Almost every scene pays tribute to something else -- from the Three Stooges to the Avengers TV series.
The setting seems to shift from the Big Band era to the 1970's, to the present (1985) without any purpose.
This is part of what makes it fun:  it creates a link between other elements of popular culture and cinema.
Even the characters who appear only rarely have interesting cameos.  In the ""slower-moving"" scenes, you need to
look around to see what you're missing -- like the Salvation Army sign near the donation bin.  As Faron Crush put it, ""You ain't seen nothin'...YET.""  Drive Alfred Hitchcock mad, and force him to work with a staff of comic book
writers -- and you get Crimewave.  Spot Ted Raimi's cameo, and win...nothing; but he's there.

208301,4,6300132838,"This somewhat cartoonish comedy was written by the Coen brothers quite sometime ago. It's not refined and quite at the level of ""Raising Arizonia"" or""Blood Simple"", but for broadly played comedy it's hard to beat.

208302,3,6300132838,"Whether or not you like this film depends on if you thunk it is silly or funny. It is certainly not a laugh out loud film and most of the events are improbable; that is, as improbable as a three stooges flick. Three out of the box, innovative film makers wrote it and released it in 1986. A nerdy, unintelligent, shlemiel, and shlemazal is determined to win a girl he helps in a near automobile accident. The car is driven by one of two maniacs, killers for hire, who are the funniest/silliest figures in this film noir. Everything goes wrong for the romantic jerk, begining with a punch in the face and ending in nearly being killed. The two madmen are hired by one partner to kill another partner, but the boobs accidentily/foolishly kill him as well, and then go on a violence spree begining with the attempted murder of the wife of the partner who saw them do the killing and ending in them trying to murder the jerk's sweetheart.",1307404800,2,934,4.4678362573099415
208303,3,6300132838,"For most filmgoers, Sam Raimi's ""Crimewave"" (also known as ""The XYZ Murders"") is something of a curiosity, whose reputation rests mostly on the names involved - Raimi (director and co-writer), Joel and Ethan Cohen (co-writers) and Bruce Campbell (original star replaced by Reed Birney). This is mildly amusing comedy that might have been ""Army of Darkness"" or ""The Hudsucker Proxy.""

The comedy starts with a frame story set in ""Hudsucker Penitentiary,"" where a death-row inmate Victor Ajax (Reed Birney) is about to be executed. Victor says he is innocent, but nobody cares. In the following flashback the film shows us how Victor an ordinary guy fell in love with his ""dream girl"" Nancy (Sheree J. Wilson) at first sight and how they got involved in a series of murders committed by contract killers (Brion James and Paul L. Smith).

""Crimewave"" is an unusual combination of slapstick comedy and crime suspense. It is about silly physical gags and brawls on the neon-lit streets. The film's climax includes a car chase on the highway, mixed with cartoonish battles on the running vehicles. It is not ""Matrix Reloaded,"" to be sure, but stunts are surprisingly good, even thrilling at times. Two character actors Brion James and Paul L. Smith are excellent as killer version of Laurel and Hardy.

Not everything works, however. Reed Birney's ""comical"" character tries a bit too hard while dead-pan humor would be more effective. The two stars lack chemistry and their romance is not credible. Bruce Campbell appears as a playboy Renaldo ""The Heel,"" not a very funny character (and he suddenly disappears). ""Rear Window""-like episode of Mrs. Trend (inexplicably top-billed Louise Lasser) and her predicament could have been funnier with better pace and acting. Famous movie producer Edward R. Pressman appears as her husband, but his role is the weakest in the web of eccentric characters.

The film is also known for its troubled production, which Campbell recounts in his wonderful memoir ""If Chins Could Kill."" To some viewers, the behind-the-scene episodes he amusingly recounts may be more interesting the film itself.",1285027200,,2122,5.159883720930233
208304,1,6300132838,"There's a chance the nonstop idiocy of Crimewave might appeal to the lowest of lowbrow sensibilities. Sure, stylistically there's probably nothing else quite like it, but why would there be?  For most who would choose to engage their cerebra, this piece of nearly incomprehensible cartoony trash is clearly a product of gung ho mis-inspiration on the part of Raimi and the Coen Brothers fed by too much available talent and money...and possibly chemicals.

Unfortunately Mr Trend gets a 2 for 1 sale and ends up dead, too.  The maintenence man, Vic, gets drawn in when he tries to save his new girl Nancy, who's just been ditched by Rinaldo, ""the heel"" (Bruce Campbell).  Between an unrealistic car chase, a crushing staircase, a hilarious restaurant fight, a woman accidentally shipped to Uruguay, funny sound effects, nuns, ""fag dogs"", and the captain of the elevator who stops on every floor, this movie is total cheesiness.  I loved it as a kid and I love it now.  I can't say that the acting is good, or that the plot is good, but I can say that this movie makes me laugh.  Lovers of Bruce Campbell will definitely like his character Rinaldo, but he's not the focal point of the movie by any means.

Combining complex camera angles, camera movement and overbearing gore. Crimewave takes filmmaking to a new medium, combing the classic film noir detective theme, with comedic horror/drama heroes and villians. Collaborating the screenplay with his assistant editor from the evil dead, not to mention future vituroso director ""Joel Coen"" , and Joel's brother screenwriter ""Ethan Coen"", the screenplay stands out as an early inspiration to Coen Brother's films, such as ""The Hudsucker Proxy"" and ""Miller's Crossing"". Crimewave is clever and enjoyable from begining to end. The flaws sustain  the intense overacting and slaptstick mentality, yet that adds an extra flavor to Raimi's love of the three stooges. Starring Paul L. Smith, as the unappealing and weak willed , hero, security worker,and Louise Laser as a temptress turned nun. Also, starring Edward Pressman and Brion James as the agressive villian duo of exterminators. Crimewave is a stylistic action thriller bleeding with horror and slapstick comedy.
