8190608,5,B000PDS9Z0,I bought two of her DVD's and I love them both ! I a going to buy the third one right now ! Really good for beginners or for those that haven't been to class in a while. She makes you feel like she's in the room with you while she teachs. I got these DVD's to save a little money on my yoga classes in town. Well worth the money !,1263945600,,330,3.5972222222222223
8190609,5,B000PDS9Z0,"5 Stars all the way! I've purchased many yoga DVD's over the years, but this is the only one that truly got me to continuing practicing yoga. Eva is cute and an excellent instructor. I've been doing her 40 minute workout for 4 months now and I'm in better shape than ever! It's fun and challenging at same time. Give it a few tries and you will be hooked. The price can't be beat. Thank you Eva!!!",1225152000,,397,4.1688311688311686
