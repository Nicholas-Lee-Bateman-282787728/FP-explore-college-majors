400 years ago, it became certain that an asteroid would collide with Earth and the extinction of the race was at hand.  Mankind spent 10 years devising a plan to survive.  The Dobias went out to live in space while the Shioru forged underground.  300 years ago mankind returned to the surface from beyond the stars and beneath the ground.

But the surface was not what it once was, and mankind was forced to battle for supremacy with a new life form borne from the ashes of destruction.  Man was no longer at the top of the food chain.  That spot was occupied by the Siliconians, creatures who roam the landscape searching for prey.  Meanwhile, The Dobias, scientists and nobles, and the Shioru, farmers and nomads are engaged in a cold war over the limited remaining resources; a cold war that threatens to turn hot.

Amidst this battle for survival of the fittest between creature and man are Dean Honos, Alcion Fama, Cris Vesta, Victor Deicius and Shai Tanna, together they are: The Geisters.  The Geisters are the ultimate fighting force with powers, abilities and weapons far beyond normal humans. They are the last best hope for mankind.

Outwardly this series is perhaps like so many sci-fi animes that have come before; however, it keeps its audience entertained with just enough promise of potential and diverse story elements to satisfy.

  While this series does not hold up to the likes of Last Exile or RahXephon in terms of breathtaking visual quality, it does have an interesting and solid set of design and animation values.

  Judging from the low price and decent story, I would offer that Geisters is a fairly good series to get into, especially if you are just starting to get into anime.

  After reading about the series in Wizard, I pleasantly discovered that it happens to be among the first examples of Korean anime to arrive in North American markets.  If Geisters happens to be the example of what we can expect further series from Korea then I look forward to experiencing a whole new flavour of enriching anime!",1097107200,4,976,4.715976331360947
8022541,4,B00025ETRS,"I bought a used one for $8 bucks and I saw a new one for only $18.  Thats a good deal for a dvd that is pretty good.  The characters are good, but the story is something that everyone has heard of, but that shouldn't stop anyone from trying this show. Animation wise is alright, not the best, but I seen worst. Its a good show for the price, also its kinda like Blue gender. If you like sci-fi, you should try this out.",1092700800,4,419,3.9761904761904763
