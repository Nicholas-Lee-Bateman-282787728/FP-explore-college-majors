2002556,1,B0001HAIEA,"This documentary is a real testimony to the problems in inner city schools.  Though not its premise, it exposed a real problem. Teachers, specifically young ones, are not equipped to do their jobs.  They have no idea of how to deal with the mental processes of their students.

Although well meaning, they were antagonistic, inflammatory, and often worsened the problems.  The documentary highlighted that the teachers expected little, and they got exactly that.  They had either no ability or no desire to engage their students.  They did not use innovative methods, nor did they seem concerned with finding better methods to target their student's capacity to learn.

In one scenario a teacher attempted to relax his students prior to administering a test.  What he actually did was cause distress.  He seemed to have no idea that he was the source of the problem, when the students showed anxiety.

One of the saddest facts exposed in this documentary is that teachers are harsh, intolerant and lacks the ability to provide positive reinforcements/feedback.  They approached their students as criminals, future gang members, and it was clear that those were the expectations. The overall approach to problems was confrontation, which created an Us versus Them environment.  It was as if they prepared the children for failure, poverty, and prison.

The unintended message of this documentary is that teachers need more training.  These skills must include their ability to engage, to handle conflict, and to reinforce positive behaviors.

I did not, at the end of this film find these teachers heroes.  I don't understand how doing your job, and badly, makes you a hero.  Is it simply showing up or not quitting?",1278028800,13,1715,5.111510791366906

2002559,1,B0001HAIEA,"after reading the reviews from pbs i was excited to see the film. im so happy i rented it as opposed to getting it from here, which i would have done had i not found it somewhere else. while all the teachers had great intentions, it was obvious they were not equipped with the skills needed to engage the children in a community/learning environment. from observing body language and facial expressions in some of the classes, the children were not engaged (notice how they lit up when they were finally engaged through the photo project!). the answers to questions about behavior were the answers that the teachers wanted to hear and the teachers knew it. if they watched the video, i hope they would take not at how they talked to the students (a couple teachers in particular). getting angry, answering your own question, making students write why they won't misbehave anymore, etc. are old school ways of gaining compliance and they won't reach todays children.

this video would not make me want to be a teacher, if anything, it shows just how much preservice teachers need to be exposed to various cultures, they need to learn how to build a community in the classroom, and they need mentors who are aware of the needs of diverse learners. in order to attract students to a profession, make a video that highlights teachers who are able to make a difference despite the odds, schools that have made drastic turnarounds, and students who excel when they should be another negative statistic.

there are some positive things in the video, they are just overshadowed by the other stuff. and, yes, i agree with a previous writer. another video could have been used in the classroom to expose students to the lives of homosexuals.",1163808000,11,1731,4.766666666666667
2002560,5,B0001HAIEA,"I don't own this product (yet), but it was shown in one of my teacher certification classes. I was really inspired by how much the teachers were willing to sacrifice to make sure their students had at least the opportunity to succeed. However, I was saddened that they HAD to give so much because often the district/administration wasn't doing its part. The documentary showed teaching in a very realistic light rather than the ""oh, well they get weekends and summers off"" light that many people think of it as. This video was shown in a class of 23 potential teachers and I really think it strengthened our resolve to become teachers.

Update===

I now own this DVD and have been teaching for almost five years and can say that this film does a great job of depicting the frustrations of rookie teachers and the obstacles teachers have to overcome just to do their jobs. If you're considering becoming a teacher, I would definitely recommend buying this movie to get a realistic idea of what you're getting into.

8012648,4,B0001HAIEA,"The First Year (2001) directed by Davis Guggenheim seems like a very realistic documentary. This movie overviewed the difficulties teachers can have during their first year of teaching. It addressed problems such as ill-behaved students and under budgeted programs.  The documentary follows the lives of five teachers beginning their careers in California at inner city schools.  They all taught elementary grades except for one who taught ESL to older kids, perhaps Junior High.  One thing that they all had in common though was their passion to be invested in each childs life.  They were all extremely devoted to their class, especially the students who had behavior issues.
Two teachers, the male teachers, stood out to me the most.  One of them, Mr. Rabb, a kindergarten teacher, was particularly dedicated to Tyquan, a student who needed speech therapy.  Mr. Rabb did everything he could to get Tyquan the help he needed.  He constantly tried connecting with the school speech therapist (which never turned into a regular thing).  He called different hospitals to figure out where Tyquan could go for therapy that was covered by Medicaid.  In the end, since the parents were uninvolved, Mr. Rabb began tutoring Tyquan after school himself.
Like Mr. Rabb, I found it inspiring how willing the teachers were to do home visits if necessary.  Many parents were not interested in showing up for appointments or coming to conferences, so these teachers went to their students homes when it was necessary to get the parents in the loop.
This movie was lacking in a main focus though.  I felt like the struggles demonstrated in the film, couldve been struggles of any teacher with experience.  The struggles were not unique to a first-year.  The film also focused on one single student in each class, which took away from all the good that was probably happening in the classrooms.  The movie didn't address how the teachers dealt with advanced students at all.
Overall, this movie was very realistic and showed some struggles teachers may have, but it didn't focus in deep enough.  It was too much to try and cover an entire year, with 5 different teachers, and multiple struggles.",1439683200,,2180,5.0
8012649,5,B0001HAIEA,"This documentary takes place in a school district of South Central Los Angeles, a part of the city with high diversity; it addresses the early stages of 5 recently graduated teachers: Georgene Acosta, Genevive DeBose, Joy Kraft-Watts, Nate Monley and Maurice Rabb. It shows the reality for teachers that want to join the work force with high expectation on job opportunities but soon see themselves finding many obstacles along the way. This documentary shows these teachers lives through their first year as educators, it shows the problems they face, their feelings towards life, towards their career and the situations that they have to confront as educators, for example with students that perform poorly at school and their lives in an intimate way. It also shows what a teacher needs to do in order to correct students when they do something wrong or when their students parents are not concerned about their childrens progress and education. It prepares people watching this movie to know what to do in these cases. These teachers often feel frustrated, but they have to find a way to deal with every day issues and learn as they go.",1427846400,,1140,4.942708333333333
8012650,3,B0001HAIEA,"The First Year (2001) directed by Davis Guggenheim is a very realistic documentary. It can be hard to watch for some people because of the content. This movie went into depth about the difficulties teachers can have during their first year of teaching. From having a problem student to having a war between whose going to give up first (teacher or student), this documentary gives vivid examples on the struggles teachers have. The documentary goes into the lives of five different teachers who begin their career teaching kids of different demographics.
One of the teachers, Maurice Rabb (a kindergarten teacher) is very devoted to his students. One student in particular struggles deeply and Rabb does everything in his power and more to make sure this student gets the help needed. He is also very adamant with his parent teacher meetings. He wants to make sure he can have the chance to speak with all the parents and is even willing to do home visits if need be.
While there are good things these teachers do for their students, there are also some not so good teaching strategies done. For example, Nate Monley, a fifth grade teacher, gave into bribing in a way. He stated that if the students were quite, they would get 50 points which was an unrealistic statement. Granted all he wanted was his students to behave, he went about it in an incorrect manner.
Overall, this movie was very realistic and showed true struggles to being teachers. It was sad at times and hard to believe at times but do not let that stray you away from teaching. I give this movie a three out of five stars.",1427846400,,1591,4.665480427046264
8012651,4,B0001HAIEA,"The First Year is an award winning film directed by Davis Guggenheim following five teachers during their first year of teaching.  The 2001 film documents the first year teachers struggles and disappointments and all the hard work that has to be put into that classroom.  It isn't easy and in this movie, that is a major point.  It depicts the frustrations of every first year teacher in situations that other future teachers need to be aware of. I would recommend this movie because I thought this film was good, it was interesting.  I also like seeing what I may have to deal with as a future teacher.
Maurice and his Kindergarten classroom was the most interesting to me as I would like to teach Kindergarten.  I think its a very realistic view of the struggles of teaching and Im glad that there are movies out there that illustrate that.  The worst part of this film was the fact that it jumped around a lot and it got a little confusing at times to remember who the teacher was.  It was also a shorter film at only an hour and 20 minutes but it was pretty boring so it seemed much longer.  This film showed a number of teachers though that cared for their students and wanted to help them out, so they tried hard to make sure they learned.  What I got out of this film is that one of the best teaching strategies is a value that all teachers should have, all teachers should care about each individual student.  It was cool that these teachers cared and tried to help so much, though you cant help them all.  So I would recommend this film to all future teachers whether they're going into Elementary Education or High School.",1427760000,,1632,4.442953020134228
8012652,4,B0001HAIEA,"This documentary showed some troubles that a few teachers encountered in their first years teaching. Some of these problems included students disrupting class, parents not coming in for meetings, and inadequate school resources. The documentary showed how each scenario was handled by the teachers and sometimes the teachers talked about what was happening.

When one teacher faced the problem of a students parents not coming to conferences, the principal told him to call and say he was coming over to their home. I thought this seemed a bit extreme. It seems unprofessional for a teacher to just come over to a students home uninvited. Other teachers had students who were disruptive or disrespectful; they responded by making their students write reflections on their behavior. Some students had to take these reflections home and read them to their parents and have them sign them. Other teachers had to work through inadequate sources. One example was a speech teacher who didn't come in often enough and so a child did not receive the help that was deserved. Another example was teachers not having their own classrooms.

I think its a decent movie that shows the realities of teaching and the variety of problems that teachers encounter every day. The movie also showed that the teachers found that it is worth it.",1427587200,,1322,5.031963470319635
8012653,3,B0001HAIEA,"The First Year is about a group of teachers who are teaching for the first time. These specific teachers are teaching in inner city schools that don't have a lot of money and the kids usually have difficult home lives and aren't always well behaved or have learning disabilities that aren't addressed. I have mixed feelings about this documentary because it only relates to a small population of teachers and what they have to deal with. The teacher that I liked to most was Maurice Rabb. Although all of the teachers were persistent and cared about their students, I thought he really went out of his way to get help for a student who needed speech therapy. Another teacher who I liked was Nate Monley. I thought he took a lot of time to connect with his student in and outside of his classroom. One of his students that struggled he would go fishing with or take out to dinner. I would recommend this documentary to anyone who wants to be a teacher, but to understand that it isn't realistic for all teaching situations. One thing that you could take from the movie is that if you're teaching in a school like this one, it's important to sometimes teach your kids more than just math or reading, like about violence or gangs, because these are the things that they will be faced with and might benefit from the most. Once they learn how to deal with things in life like these, it will be easier for them to focus on school subjects.",1427587200,,1434,4.477099236641221
8012654,5,B0001HAIEA,"""The First Year"" was not an easy film to watch. It highlights the real challenges first year teachers face when they want so badly to educate youth, especially in a low income area where resources are scarce, to say the least. We see automobile repair shops turned into makeshift classrooms; teachers who don't even get to have their own classrooms; apathetic parents who don't show up for meetings with their children's teachers even when they know their children are not performing well in school; and how both politics and a speech therapist who almost never showed up for her appointments with one child can nearly ruin one teacher's quest to find speech therapy for one of the kids in his classroom.

The film moves along at just about the right pace; I was never bored. These poignant, human stories grabbed my attention and never let it go until the end of the film. I agree with other reviewers who write that this film would be an excellent resource for people learning how to be teachers and not just an expos of how we need to provide better education to all of our youth.

The DVD comes with a few extra features. I like the epilogue with tis information about what happened to the teachers and some of the children alike; and there is a very well done short entitled ""Teach."" There are optional teacher running commentaries as well.

I highly recommend ""The First Year"" for people learning how to be teachers so they will know what they may well be up against should they decide to teach in a low income area with a paucity of resources; and those of us interested in the subject of quality education in general would do well to add this to their collections.",1331164800,7,1672,4.585284280936455
8012655,4,B0001HAIEA,This was an EXCELLENT video because it showed the real world events of a teacher's first year. A new teacher could learn a lot from the video and it would be interesting to watch.,1328400000,,179,4.294117647058823
8012656,5,B0001HAIEA,"Just rented this from Netflix and it moved me to tears. I see negative reviews on here and to me they've missed the point. Sure these first year teachers might not be equipped right from the start but you can tell those kids were impacted in a very good, significant way from having these instructors in their lives. I know I could never teach. It is an important job that our society doesn't value anywhere near as much as it should. I did a little facebook poking around and it looks like all but one of these teachers is still at it a dozen years later. I applaud them and their skills. And obviously this filmmaker has gone on to grander things as well!",1322352000,2,657,4.306451612903226
