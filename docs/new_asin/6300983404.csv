7808879,4,6300983404,"Back in the 1970's, sultry, Yugoslav-born Laura Antonelli was one of the queens of Italian cinema, particularly in the genre of the erotic farce.  ""Till Marriage Do Us Part"" (the original Italian title translates more or less as ""My God, How Low I've Fallen!"", which Antonelli's character exclaims in dismay after a steamy encounter) is one of her funniest and sexiest.  The plot is fairly simple; Eugenia (Antonelli), a beautiful aristocrat, finds out on her wedding night that her new husband is actually her brother.  Since there's the little matter of an inheritance that will be lost if the marriage is annulled, she stays married - and stays a virgin.  Eventually, though, she loses that virginity, though exactly how she does it you'll have to see.  Over and above the erotic hijinks, though, the film has lots of gentle but pointed commentary on the mores and manners of turn-of-the-century/World War I Italy (if you know who Gabriele D'Annunzio was, it'll make some of the jokes and set pieces funnier; it also helps to know that Italy tried and failed to conquer Ethiopia in the 1890's, and did conquer Libya just before World War I).  Look for the subtitled version if you want to hear the original actors' voices.",1104451200,8,1225,4.865384615384615
