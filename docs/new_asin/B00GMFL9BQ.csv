6086544,2,B00GMFL9BQ,"I cannot even begin to express how terrible this movie is. It has absolutely nothing to do with the other two. I know this is a prequel, but it feels like a totally different universe. The story in no way ever ties how the virus got to the mainland. To be honest the second movie at least tried to fill in some of the gaps or at least be in continuity.

The ""evil doctor"" has to be one of the worse characters I have ever seen. They also never explain where this virus came from. I guess this prequel will get an even worse prequel. The island the virus is on is a joke. There is little security and boats can just float right up to it. No cameras or anything. You know what just forget this movie. I'm done.",1406505600,,708,4.057142857142857
6086545,3,B00GMFL9BQ,"""Sometimes we have to harm one to save millions."" A group of friends decide to throw a bachelor party for one of their own. After searching for the best place they find a secluded abandoned island that will be perfect. What starts off as a fun relaxing time turns strange when one they start to develop strange rashes on their bodies. When the rash turns into something much worse they look for anyway they can to cure what they have. When they find a building they think they found the answer, but their problems are only beginning. Once again another sequel that no one was really asking for is made. Due to the recent string of straight-to-video things like this I was obviously not expecting a whole lot from this. I'm not sure if it was because I had that attitude going in but this was actually better then I was expecting. I'm not saying this is anything amazing but it was watchable and I wasn't really bored with what I saw. The most interesting parts though were the scenes involving Sean Astin and the ""back story"" of the virus. When it was over my thoughts were, wow...I was expecting much worse. Take from that what you will. Overall, better then I was expecting and actually one of the better straight-to-DVD horror sequels that have come out...again take from that what you will. I give this a B-.",1406419200,2,1312,4.516806722689076
6086546,2,B00GMFL9BQ,"With a flowing scrip that included a great balance of humor and gore, developed characters, and talented directing, the original Cabin Fever is one of the greatest additions to the horror genre.  Unfortunately this so called prequel falls flat on pretty much every level.  The characters are lifeless, the dialog is awkward, and the storyline is haphazard.  Pretty much the only thing you are going to get out of this is over the top gore.  Without the other elements you basically get one more special effects highlight reel.  Save your money and wait till it pops up on Amazon Prime.  At least with that approach you can turn it off halfway through without feeling like a sucker for dropping $10 on it.  With my track record it will show up on Prime in a few days as I just rented it!",1406419200,,786,4.531914893617022

6086548,4,B00GMFL9BQ,"The cast was good,..
The film was well made with overall good production quality and budget.
Knowing going in to this movie,. how original could it be outside the CABIN FEVER franchise???,
it takes on more of a UMBRELLA CORPORATION type narrative.
The special effects team did an outstanding job for being compleatly and disgustingly gory!
The movie as a whole was ok...but you watch CABIN FEVER films for the gore the virus brings to the screen !
For that,... i give it 4 stars for the disgust,... and the hardcore gore !",1405382400,10,522,4.623655913978495
6086549,4,B00GMFL9BQ,"This prequel to Cabin Fever was pretty awesome. The gore was off the chain and it had some really OMG gross out moments.

It had a great cast led by Sean Astin as ""Patient Zero"".It takes place on a tropical island when two brothers one of their girlfriends and a best friend go by boat to a secluded island for a stag party but what they find instead of fun is that while snorkeling all the sea life is dead and looks lie its flesh has been eaten.

It doesn't take long to figure out something is wrong with the water besides the dead fish because the two that went snokeling start to get very unpleasant skin symptoms like blisters rotting flesh and a bad case of projectile blood vomiting.

Its action packed and full on horror not like the second Cabin Fever film.there's an epic fight between two rotting girls that is really gnarly and that's just one example of the gnarly scenes in the film. I was pleasantly suprised because I read some bad reviews but take my word for it,if you love gore and like to be grossed out this film is for you!",1403913600,,1046,4.299492385786802
6086550,4,B00GMFL9BQ,"This indeed was a surprise to me too, the trailer was awful and made it look uninteresting, but im glad I gave it a chance because its a pretty awesome little horror movie, the story is a prequel style set up, with experiments on a remote island where 4 people go to hang out for drugs and drinking not realising what's going on or that the water is contaminated, it has a different feel to the others but it uses the best element to the max which is the insane body deterioration and there is lots of very cool practical gory moments and bloody mutilation and skin being ripped off etc. This is really worth checking out its great fun, ignore the trailer etc. Its better than you think!",1399075200,,687,4.333333333333333
6086551,3,B00GMFL9BQ,"I love Cabin Fever. I've seen it several times. I hated Cabin Fever 2. Cabin Fever 3 should've been the sequel and the second effort should never have been attempted. Much more could have been done with the storyline and plot, but I think it was probably hard to get funding for writers and such since Cabin Fever 2 was so terrible. Patient Zero actually had a plot and an interesting ending. The cast could actually act, so more development overall could've worked this time. If you were bummed that the sequel sucked, give this one a try. It's completely different.",1396915200,2,567,4.623762376237623
6086552,2,B00GMFL9BQ,"Ok,...for some reason, the whole ""Bachelor party"" story line continues to get used in movies. Why?! I'm not really sure, but here is another one to add to the list. I honestly didn't even know this film existed until yesterday, so I went straight home after work and watched it. If you've seen the 2nd (and I'm assuming you have, since you're looking at the 3rd installment), then you won't be disappointed, as the 2nd was completely atrocious! This one, unfortunately, is equally as bad! How they conned Sean Astin into this movie is beyond my comprehension, but somehow they managed to and I must say,...he is about the only reason this doesn't get a single star rating. He plays the role as if he were in another one of this big budget titles! Fantastic actor, that guy! The others?...eh,..not so much.

*******WARNING,....I'm going to completely RUIN this movie from here on*******

This movie, for me, was kinda confusing in various parts. The actors all tend to blend together and it was difficult for me to tell one C-lister from the next. That being said, this movie takes place somewhere in the Caribbean. There's a wedding going on and for Marcus (Mitch Ryan), it's his last day as a bachelor. What better way to celebrate then the hire a ridiculously LARGE boat and sail to an uninhabited remote island?! Yeah, you get the picture. Anyways, Marcus is marrying into a VERY wealthy family and his brother, Josh (Brando Eaton) and his girlfriend, Penny (Jillian Murrey), along with lifelong friend and business partner, Dobs (Ryan Donowho) want to take his to an island in the Caribbean for a night of drinking and partying. (although how you party with just 2 dudes and one's girlfriend, I'm not sure?!). That being said,...what woman is even remotely likely to allow her fiance to go ""party"" with another girl. And who brings their girlfriend to a bachelor party?! Regardless,...they get a boat (which is FAR beyond their means of expense) and head out to what they refer to as a ""virgin beach"". Yeah. On the way they gift Marcus with a ridiculously large sex toy. Again,...yeah. We also, at this point, discover that Penny and Marcus once hooked up. I'm pretty sure they shot this scene just to get some nudity in the movie. As they approach the ""virgin beach"" they notice a building located on the shore. Hey, what the heck?! Let's go anyways!

Now we're in a science lab. With the exception of Dr. Edwards (Currie Graham), the ""scientists"" all appear to be in their Freshmen year of college as they can't be older then 20. They have discovered some type of flesh eating virus and have quarantined it's only survivor, Porter (Sean Astin). Porter is immune to the disease and Dr. Edwards is intent on extracting a cure. At least, I think this is what is going on? They hold Porter against his will and administer tests on him until he decides to take matters into his own hands (literally!). He cuts his hand open and as a scientist enters his area, rips his suit off and forces his blood into the poor guy's face. This causes a mandatory evacuation period of 48 hours. All the scientist, except Dr. Edwards, Camila (Solly Duran), and Bridget (Lydia), are send into another building in quarantine.

Back to the bachelor party! They make it to the beach and Josh and Emily decide to go snorkeling. Of course, Marcus and Dobs decide to stay on the beach and get high instead (cause you totally can't do THAT at home!). After being in the water, Josh and Emily discover a massive graveyard of fish on the bottom of the ocean floor. Disgusted, Emily rushes back to the beach. This is when the ""Fever"" begins. Emily quickly notices a rash forming on her arm and heads into the tent (which miraculously gets erected). As Josh gets called in to help with the situation he begins to notice a rash starting on his neck. He chalks it up to the weed they smoked and decides this is the perfect time to bang his girlfriend. Somehow, even with a multiple blisters and burning skin, she's up for it. Not only that, but she pushes him down to receive some oral pleasure. Now, I'm not expert,....but this girl as MASSIVE blisters ALL over her body,.....I mean, ALL OVER HER BODY, and this guy doesn't see anything wrong with that?! Gross. Regardless, I took it as sort of a ripoff of the ""finger"" scene from the original. Of course, you know what happens next. He rises up looking like he just got first place in a cherry pie eating contest and she pukes some sort of stuff all over him. Yummy! This cause Josh to rush out in a mad panic and start looking for help. Marcus and Dobs then remember the abandoned building and head for help.

This is where I start to get confused,...and again, maybe it was just me?! Maybe I wasn't paying enough attention, or something, but they find themselves eventually inside the building. Dobs gets spooked after discovering an axe lodged in some equipment and blood on the table and accidentally engages the buildings locking system, barring the windows and exits. Instead of hacking through them they do what any other genius would and venture further into the remains eventually stumbling upon a kitchen and what appears to have been a massacre. After searching for a while, they are approached by a bloody mess that can only be a survivor of the outbreak, so they rush into the next room and lock the door. Too bad the next room if filled with bodies. After one of the bodies comes to life, Dobs quickly rushes back and locks Marcus in. Some friend?! Marcus takes care of business (since he still has the axe) while Dobs is nearly shot to death by the previous survivor. The only thing that saves Dobs (and this is actually how it happens), the scientists, while firing a shot, has his hand broken off at the wrist. This causes his hand to fly directly at his face and the gun to jam directly into his skull. And dead. Wow,....Who thought that would be cool? Stupid. Somehow (again, maybe I wasn't paying attention,..I WAS eating some delicious food at the time) both Marcus and Dobs end up outside again and are met by Josh (who's virus is quickly spreading). Josh has since made contact with Dr. Edwards and was told to come to the building. Dobs then pushes ONE BUTTON and manages to get the security door open. Convenient. They rush in looking for Dr. Edwards and are met by Bridget.

(Now, in a previous scene, Bridget is helping Dr. Edwards with the poor guy Porter infected when the guy pukes in her face causing HER to contract the disease.)

So here we are. Bridget talks to the 3 and tells them to follow her only to be put on the spot by Camilla. Camilla forces Bridget to reveal her face so the guys can see she's not well. Bridget says she can help with Penny, however, so she and Josh head out, leaving Camilla, Marcus, and Dobs. On the way, Josh tells Bridget about the boat they have, so she smacks him in the head and runs for it. She is stopped by Penny, who questions her. Now,...this is another one of those ""what were they thinking?!"" scenes. Bridget and Penny get into a fight. And who WOULDN'T feel like fighting?! They both are on the verge of death, but are somehow battling as if they were on the set of Game of Thrones. The fight is concluded when Penny smashes Bridget's face in with the GIANT dildo that was given to Marcus earlier in the movie. Again,...why they took they time to bring THAT with them to the beach, I have NO idea!

Back in the science lab (that for some reason or another has a huge, illuminated billboard sign above it - because nothing says secret research facility like a giant, lit-up billboard sign), Camilla, Marcus, and Dobs meet up with Dr. Edwards and Portor. After an argument, Dr. Edwards makes his escape. Dobs chases him and Marcus and Camilla stay with Porter. Dr. Edwards makes it nearly all the way to the beach before being confronted by Dobs. He tells Dobs that he can help him with the illness (Dobs has since contracted the infection as well). Of course, Dobs agrees and Dr. Edwards punches him in the face, steals his gun, and kills him. So much for Dobs.

Marcus and Camilla release Porter and initiate the ""self destruction"" sequence. Yes,...the building actually IS equipped with a self destruction sequence. They make a run for in and stumble upon Dr. Edwards. He makes a plea to Marcus and Camilla, I don't know something about how they can be rich, somehow or another, but Porter ends the argument with a poorly aimed shot at the Docs neck. And see ya, Dr. Edwards!

The next scene appears and they're somehow back on that nice yacht. Porter gets both Marcus and Camilla water and locks them inside. After discovering he put his blood into it they try to get out and can't,...thus ending the movie.

Fortunately during the credits, scenes play out to let you know how most of Porter's actions were accomplished. But doesn't do too much to properly explain why?

So there you have it. Another poor excuse for a ""horror"" flick and yet another punch in Eli Roth's face. For a series that started off so awesome, they have done such a poor job with it. They have everything they need to make a cool flick except for the correct story. The only way to bring this series back to life is to have Eli Roth come in an take over. The movie, in itself, is watchable. Albeit, RIDICULOUS, but watchable. I wouldn't bother ever watching it again.

FINAL VERDICT:  WAIT FOR IT ON TBS!  It is mildly entertaining at times, but only if you're not actually paying to see it.

6086553,3,B00GMFL9BQ,"Porter (Sean Astin) is patient zero in quarantine at a CDC facility on some tropical island. He has a natural immunity to the virus. He is there against his will and will do anything to go back to the Shire. Meanwhile Marcus (Mitch Ryan) is going to marry into money with Kate (Claudette Lali). Marcus' wild brother Josh (Brando Eaton) has devised a ""bachelor party"" which consists of those two, a friend (Ryan Donowho) and Josh's girlfriend Penny (Jillian Murray), a former conquest of Marcus unknown to Josh. They are to take a large boat and go to a deserted island to drink, smoke, and snorkel.

It isn't rocket science to figure out that they make it to the quarantined island and have virus issues.

Sean Astin took his role seriously. The overall plot was unfortunate. There were gross containment rule violations that didn't make sense. The overall plot was weak as were the characters. The highlight of the film comes at the end with the ugliest cat fight in the history of cinema.

Worth a rental.

The gore was AWESOME in it, the plot was good, the characters were similar to those of Cabin fever 1 and the movie's theme and background was creepily dark. Set on an island, a group of kids stay there for vacation.

But not long after being exposed to the water, a girl in the group begins to contract the deadly flesh eating virus.

Also on this island are a group of scientists who seem as if they were dumped from a really bad James Bond flick in another timeline and who are keeping prisoner a man (Sean Astin, looking more and more like Zach Galifianakis and hitting rock-bottom career-wise) who may hold the key to a miraculous cure.

This splatterfest offers absolutely nothing beyond some admittedly eye-popping (though, unfortunately mostly CGI) blood and guts being smeared across the screen. The story isn't there, and the actors are similarly absent-minded, including Astin, who gets about 15 minutes of screentime and who seems annoyed that his career has amounted to this (seriously dude, get Brendan Frasier and Pauly Shore on the phone and let's have us an ""Encino Man 2: Ice To See You Again""). There is one particular amusing and protracted fight-scene between the two token female ""characters"" that threatens to give ""They Live"" a run for its money in the over-the-top and gratuitous fight-scene department, but the other hour and change feel like a complete and utter waste of time. Fans of Eli Roth's original will walk away with a bad taste in their mouth, while any horror fan with the slightest bit of taste in the first place will feel their intelligence has been insulted. Stick with the original, and if you must, give Ti West's well-meaning but mixed-bag of a sequel a shot. Keep this one quarantined and away from your Netflix queue.",1413849600,4,1915,4.947204968944099

6086603,4,B00GMFL9BQ,"For me, flesh-eating viruses and similar organisms are some of the scariest things on the planet.  They can bring a slow, painful death that is as gruesome as it is horrific.  So, when I heard another CABIN FEVER movie was in the works, I knew I had to see it.  What better subject matter for a horror flick than something of that nature?  And when you consider its an actual possibility that could happen in real life, that ups the scare factor exponentially.  Im happy to report this latest installment, CABIN FEVER: PATIENT ZERO, is a worthy addition to the franchise and definitely worth checking out.

Before I continue with this review, I have to state up front that this movie contains some gruesome and truly grisly images.  If you have never seen a CABIN FEVER movie and cannot stomach gore very well, I would steer clear of this trilogy.  Of course, what would you expect from a movie about a flesh-eating virus?

CABIN FEVER: PATIENT ZERO is shot well and looks great onscreen.  I understand this film didn't have a very big budget, but director Kaare Andrews does a great job with the money he had at hand.  Much like Andrews previous film ALTITUDE, this picture relies on suspense and intensity just as much as it does on special effects to scare you.

And speaking of scares, CABIN FEVER: PATIENT ZERO has several.  These are not the typical slasher-chasing-victims frights, but more of the horrific-discovery shocks.  And it works well for this genre.  Combined with some insane gore effects, the tension in this movie is enough to give you a heart attack.

As a fan of good gore, I have to commend the special effects team on what they were able to accomplish here.  They put to film some truly disturbing images that I will have a hard time getting out of my head.  For example, theres a sex scene that will make you cringe.  I will not divulge details so as to spoil the surprise, but lets just say you might reconsider getting too kinky in bed after watching this film.

My sole complaint about the film is that it has a couple of Huh? scenes that made me scratch my head.  For instance, after Penny discovers her skin boiling up, she decides to let her boyfriend make her feel better by having sex.  If she was truly in as much pain as she led on, then sex would be the last thing on her mind.

I was also told CABIN FEVER: PATIENT ZERO is a prequel to the other CABIN FEVER films.  I suppose this could fit, however its not explained very well if it is.  This is a minor comment, but one I feel worth mentioning.

But, even so, you have to take CABIN FEVER: PATIENT ZERO for what it is:  a fun, schlocky, gory excursion into biological terror.  I recommend giving this film a look (if you can stomach it), and be sure to watch through the credits for some interesting backstory on the events that you see unfold during the movie; they actually answered a couple of questions for me.  This film is available now.",1410134400,5,2932,4.468926553672317
6086604,1,B00GMFL9BQ,"The meandering plot make this an incredibly boring horror movie. Because ""blockbuster"" movies are almost a thing of the past I watch just about every horror movie that comes to redbox as even bad horror tends to at least be watchable. Cabin Fever has a fun ""flesh eating virus"" premise and good production quality for a direct to DVD horror movie but it moves so slowly that it just can't hold your attention. This would've been a fun 30 minute TV show but the 97 minute run time makes it feel like a 3 hour movie.",1410048000,2,514,4.364583333333333

This really just made me think this is sick and hope that something like this is really not out there, because they set it up for part 4 now...  I would like to see this evolve over to a zombie or walking dead type of thing, now that might be cool.
This one is not for the weak stomach viewers, makes the past ones look like there wasn't a lot of graphics when there was.  I think the first cabin fever had good enough graphics in that movie, but this one over the deep end compared to that one.",1409184000,,735,3.9060402684563758

6086609,2,B00GMFL9BQ,"Although still fun, this was the least impressive flesh-eating virus movie of the franchise.  It's often more than gory and wacky enough to please fans of the franchise though.

A group of friends embark on a Caribbean bachelor party cruise and come across a remote island research facility and they are exposed to a deadly, flesh-eating virus during a gore-chummed snorkeling expedition.

Simultaneously we switch back and forth with a parallel plot in which researchers have isolated ""patient zero"" (Sean Astin; The Strain, The Goonies, Lord of the Rings)--the carrier of the original strain of this horrible virus that blessed us with this franchise--moved him to an island lab (yes, that lab) for study and we'll just say things get out of hand inside their research facility as well.  So we have two simultaneous infections occurring on this normally sleepy, sunny island.

If you've seen any of these movies, you've sort of seen them all.  But let's be clear here, director Kaare Andrews (The ABCs of Death - V is for Vagitus, Altitude) delivers extravagant levels of gore consistent with the franchise.  After exposure our early infected cast members have a rash which quickly shifts to symptoms of blisters andworse.  More advanced victims practically melt away and projectile vomit liquefied gore into the faces of the yet uninfected.  Skin sloughs off of bodies, pus erupts from bloated flesh, and--perhaps the most flawed aspect of this sequel--victims eventually become almost zombie-like.  Also, like its predecessors, it uses a sex scene to set the tone of the urgencybecause after all, and I can't speak for everyone here, but when my girlfriend's body is covered with festering sores the first place y mind goes to is ""then we should probably have sex!""  Perhaps this is all just to teach younger viewers that sex might just catch you something deadly.  Oh, and bonus, there's also a flesh-ripping zombie girl catfight.

Part one of this franchise succeeded with a rather serious tone, part two was basically slapstick and goretastically hilarious, and this third installment attempts to re-secure a sense of fear and urgency as the infection advances while maintaining some playful silliness (e.g., having your softened, flesh-eaten skull crushed by a giant dildo).  In my opinion the urgency is long missed and, while this movie is entertaining for the sake of the gore and some most welcomed wackiness, the overall Cabin Fever experience doesn't measure up strongly to the first two and is, in fact, ranking far below either of them in quality.

The nigh-zombiism of the infected left me feeling a bit derailed and the plot (revolving around getting off the island) degenerates down a dumb path.  But kudos for not just ""redoing"" the movie and ""calling"" it a sequel as we often see in the horror genre.  At least a solid effort was made to make this installment feel different from the others.  In that respect, the entire franchise is successful.

I must say I was entertained, though.  This flick was a lot of fun and any film featuring a bludgeoning death-by-dildo scene deserves some attention from gorehound goofballs.",1407542400,6,3142,5.0523255813953485
6086610,4,B00GMFL9BQ,"By far the most enjoyable Cabin Fever.  The plot is actually well-written, smart and fast-moving.  The fact that Sean Astin is the lead actor not only is surprising, but his acting makes the movie.  ""Patient Zero"" takes its audience on a journey through a journey of twists and turns, explaining how this skin-melting disease ends up a franchise of multiple disgusting movies!  HUGE PLOT TWIST at the end, but I am not going to ruin it for anyone.  Rent this one - You will not be disappointed.

6086612,3,B00GMFL9BQ,"Cabin Fever: Patient Zero - is pretty good. I found the part of the movie with the typical immature twenty something year old youngsters annoying. It seems allot of Horror movies star a group of extremely absorbed party obsessed youths. This was the norm back in the eighties and nineties. I think its time to change the formula. The rest of the movie was great. I would like to also see horror movies have more scenes take place in more well let day time scenarios. They seem to make you believe that only bad things happen at night and all is peaches and cream during the day. What a load of nonsense. Nasty horrid scenes don't think of concepts like ""oh my its one in the afternoon all should be well. "" I find sadly this movie seems to be clinging to these tiresome concepts. Why not hire main characters more in their 40s or 50s who are experienced and not so immature. If the script is written correctly and better actors hired I think the movie would be more realistic. Most teenagers and twenty years old's don't make enough money to be going on expensive luxury vacations.
