I have to say the ""villain"" was the only one who threw the production off for me. His acting style was very one note.",1508630400,,266,4.037735849056604

8410322,1,B003ZHR6W0,"Terrible acting, script, terrible everything. I couldn't figure out if it was intentionally campy or just plain awful.",1506643200,,118,5.611111111111111
8410323,1,B003ZHR6W0,"OMG, this has got to be one of the worst films I have ever watched. There is no point to the story and nothing is explained. Where is the storyline?",1463184000,,148,3.966666666666667
8410324,4,B003ZHR6W0,"First of all, I want to say I'm not a huge fan of horror movies in general. But this one actually managed to keep my attention on the movie. I like the story, it's fresh, original and something I haven't seen before. But most kudos go to the make-up and special effects. It's very well made and people who prefer practical effects over CGI won't complain with this movie. Definitely worth your time!",1447891200,,399,4.47945205479452
8410325,4,B003ZHR6W0,"This movie was campy fun, in tradition of The Godfather of Gore Herschel Gordon-Lewis's Wizard of Gore and Blood Feast the fx's are pretty impressive for how low budget it was with creatures like something out of From Dusk Till Dawn!",1441238400,,233,4.7073170731707314
8410326,5,B003ZHR6W0,"GREAT Horror movie, my wife and I LOVE it. It really makes you think of what your fears really are GREAT story line.",1422316800,,116,4.086956521739131
