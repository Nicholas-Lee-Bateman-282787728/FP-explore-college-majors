8186013,5,B000OPOCN2,"I downloaded an episode of Dr. Danger.  It's a rare jem of a show, much like Three Sheets, both from now debunked tv channel MOJO.  Dr. Danger is able to warm up to the coldest of people in distant counties, letting us see into the dangers but also the beauty of far off places.

I would have liked to see more of Dr. Danger, but like I said, MOJO is no longer in service, as is now, Dr. Danger.",1235606400,,395,3.9746835443037973
8186014,1,B000OPOCN2,"I watched two episodes and a pattern emerged. Dr. Danger visits places as any tourist would, emphasizing the largely missing ""danger"" aspect. The Yemen episode was sort of entertaining but I am not sure whether this was intentional. After visiting a restaurant and guys who jump over camels, Dr. Danger decided to climb a mountain. The mountain seemed pretty small and unchallenging, but Dr. Danger managed to lose grip and slide down a couple of meters, dislocating his shoulder. The cameraman had climbed the same path seconds before with his presumably bulky camera, and Dr. Danger did not carry anything, so I think Dr. Danger is a bit clumsier than his cameraman. The last ten minutes of the episode depicted the pain and suffering of Dr. Danger and his arrival in the local hospital.",1231027200,2,789,4.895522388059701
8186015,5,B000OPOCN2,"I watched this show on Mojo Mix (On Demand) and loved it.  Unlike a previous review, I think Dr. Bob is awesome.  He seems genuinely interested in the people and places he visits, opened my eyes to a lot of the beauty of the Middle East, and takes a 560 foot descent into a cave in Oman after spending the night at the top of a mountain - how freakin' cool is that?  The dude is obviously well respected, and his personal history seems to go deeper than he allows you to believe, as displayed by his interaction with international military groups and local humanitarians who not only know him... but like him enough to accommodate his requests.

Whether it's learning CQC techniques with the US Military, uncovering a fully self-sufficient, and (until recently) uncharted town in the middle of the Afghanistan desert, or attempting to communicate with the people of Somalia... only to become the ""#1 Most Wanted"" bounty for that day (he was the first white reporter to visit since a British reporter was recently murdered 45 seconds after she stepped out into the streets) - I found this series to be slightly addictive.

If you're one of those people who love The History Channel, I think you might enjoy this series as much as I did.  The truth is: We need more television programming like this.  How someone can watch this and not be fairly enlightened is beyond me.

Is it a keeper?  Well, I guess that's for you to decide.  All I know is that Dr. Bob's got me hankering for a trip to Oman - and a really long trip down a very steep hole - just to see what he wrote in that cave diary. :)",1229385600,2,1592,4.421232876712328
8186016,1,B000OPOCN2,"this has to be one of the worst tv shows i have seen in a long time - this guy is a journalist? he comes off as a pompous foreigner wearing khakis and a blue blazer who inserts the word 'dangerous' into every other sentence. he is trying to make the audience believe that he is some sort of thrill seeker journalist when in fact his insincerity and melodramatics make it seem all about him, not the story. i am sure that the situation on the ground in Somalia is dangerous but i felt like he was making too much of an effort to follow 'danger' instead of the real story. it was difficult to watch such horribly inept reporting and even as entertainment, this just does not hold up. to sum it up in one word: horrible.",1216512000,,717,4.202898550724638
