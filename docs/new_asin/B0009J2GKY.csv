2293522,3,B0009J2GKY,"Enjoyable little film about two people from opposite sides of the tracks. Lots of character development and wonderful cast. Not the best romantic comedy of all time but it's certainly a little charmer that has become a jewel of a movie , if you and your significant other have a rainy Sunday , together.",1150070400,6,303,4.62962962962963
2293523,4,B0009J2GKY,"This 1979 movie, ""Foolin' Around"", is definitely a feel-good romantic comedy, and it's got a lot going for it.  This is certainly not the most realistic movie you're ever going to see--often, it's downright outrageous in a very cartoonish sort of way--but it's often hilarious, and also, it has its moments of smile-inducing tenderness.  The pairing of Gary Busey and Annette O'Toole is uncanny--both of them are undeniably charming and they deliver uniquely down-to-earth performances.  Eddie Albert also does a great job as the veteran president of a construction company and has a wonderfully dramatic and surprisingly suspenseful 'coming-of-age'-type scene with Busey 50 stories up.  With its blend of poignancy and over-the-top humor, ""Foolin' Around"" makes for a highly entertaining movie that's a pleasure to see.  Also of note, Seals & Crofts contribute 2 tunes to the soundtrack which I'm quite sure were both written specifically for the movie (they aren't on any S & C album): the solid, easy-going, country-flavored title track (which sounds a lot like the Eagles' ""Peaceful Easy Feeling""); and the decent ballad ""These Moments Never Live Again"".",1117152000,18,1158,5.34065934065934
8061642,5,B0009J2GKY,when they filmed this movie I was working in downtown Minneapolis for an elevator company and when they filmed the scene on top the construction  we were working across the street it's an apartment building built by Borson Contruction. The building is on the corner of 13th and Lasalle south,1484611200,,291,4.82
8061643,5,B0009J2GKY,"I always loved this movie, but I am not going to pay so much for VHS, we should be able to get it in digital format...please.",1473638400,4,125,3.8461538461538463
8061644,5,B0009J2GKY,Fun movie with great cast. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do.,1423872000,3,61,3.4285714285714284
8061645,4,B0009J2GKY,"I doubt anyone will rate this as a great movie. But it is most certainly enjoyable to watch for a few good laughs and some great music by Seals and Crofts.  It is a real shame that the S&C tunes are not out on CD.  Also this movie deserves to be on DVD.  I'll bet there would be a lot of people willing to pay a FAIR price for it.  I know I would.  I had a major crush on Annette O'Toole back in the day.  ""One on One"" with Robby Benson is another nostalgic look back at late 70s early 80s as is Fool'n Around.  If it goes to DVD it is definitely worth a few bucks.",1377648000,,565,3.73728813559322
8061646,4,B0009J2GKY,I saw this movie a long time ago and really enjoyed it. Wanted to purchase it but when I saw the price I thought another movie over priced fom the 80's! Wait till the price GOES DOWN!!!!,1369872000,3,186,4.054054054054054
8061647,3,B0009J2GKY,"The movie is really funny and worth watching, but what I like most, there is some great Seals and Crofts music heard in the movie, that is not on any of their albums.",1367971200,,166,4.0606060606060606
8061648,5,B0009J2GKY,"Wonderful little comedy. But the sellers here are nuts. It's a VHS, and they're asking 90-130 dollars? I want some of what they're smoking.",1359331200,5,139,4.833333333333333
8061649,3,B0009J2GKY,"Can't believe this isn't on disk. I was going to art school in Mpls when this was being filmed, and I saw part of it being filmed at Central Lutheran Church (across the street). Today I found out that a friend of mine had actually been in the movie, and now I want to see it again. It's a silly little flick, but good for a few laughs, and it's fun seeing the familiar locations.",1332288000,4,379,4.066666666666666
8061650,2,B0009J2GKY,"Even though this is a good movie, it seems really steep in price for a VHS.
Yes, it is very good, but why so high Amazon?  Please market this in DVD  and affordable.",1293667200,6,165,3.9696969696969697
8061651,4,B0009J2GKY,"This gem needs to be on DVD.  It's a 1980 romantic comedy filmed in and around Minneapolis with shades of *The Graduate* (denouement at the Church wedding) and  *The Blues Brothers*  (compare that car chase in ChicagoLand with this wiener wagon vs. electrical service cherry picker truck vs. skywalks and locks in Minneapolis.)
The excellent cast includes Annette O'Toole, Gary Busey, Cloris Leachman (back in Mpls after Mary Tyler Moore a/k/a Mary Richards and friends left) Eddie Albert, and a show-stealing Tony Randall as the Butler.  Also appearing is William H. Macy, long before he came back to Mpls in *Fargo,*  and the Old Met(troplitan Stadium.)

Five Stars if you are lucky enough to have ties to the Land Of Sky Blue Waters and so will love this nostalgic look back,  four stars if you're not so lucky. /TundraVision",1152921600,15,828,4.913669064748201
