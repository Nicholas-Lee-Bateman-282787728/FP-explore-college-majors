8289807,5,B001CUAZD4,"I read the book, Bully: A True Story of High School Revenge by Jim Schutze.  An excellent book; I couldn't put it down!!  I could understand why Marty Puccio  came to hate his ""best"" friend although he took the wrong avenue to even the score.  I wish that pictures of Marty's face and ankles were available for the jury.  When one person's hate turns into seven peoples' hate, they have a mob's mentality.  There are no winners!  I would tell people to read the novel first because it is so detailed, and the DVD is better after that.  A mesmerizing combo!!",1399507200,,557,4.445544554455446
