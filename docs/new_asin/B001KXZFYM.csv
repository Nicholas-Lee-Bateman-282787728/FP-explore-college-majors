8316446,5,B001KXZFYM,"A story of a princess who wants to make people in the world happy. Digiko and her friends head out to do just that. They help everyone they meet. Except that Digi Devil and Piyoko will do just about anything to stop Digiko and her friends.

The series is on four DVDs and each has 3 episodes on them. All episodes are short but all together you get 48 mini stories.
The series is a prequel to the original tv series and other spin offs fo the series.

The graphics are colorful and eye catching. Easy to see and the characters are dressed in cat eared hats and have tails. So they are hybrids of cats and humans.... I just loved this series with all the cuteness. You just can't say no to DIgiko.

A must have for anyone who love sweet,cute stories. Yes, you will lear something from the series.",1379376000,,795,4.251655629139073
8316447,5,B001KXZFYM,"This has got to be one of the cutest and funniest anime series I have seen in a long time.  Join the super cute Princess Dejiko and her equally cute friends as they try their best to make everybody happy.  All the while the evil, and also cute, Deji Devil and his cute apprentice, Piyoko, try their best to make everybody miserable.  It's over four hours of good, whole-some cuteness that just won't stop.
  The other thing I liked about this show is the way the shows themselves are done.  Each DVD has three chapters, and each chapter is divided into four, five minute episodes.  The four episodes share a common theme making each chapter about twenty minutes long.
  So, if you like quality anime with an overdose of cuteness then I highly recommend Panyo Panyo Di. Gi. Charat.",1234396800,7,780,4.553956834532374
