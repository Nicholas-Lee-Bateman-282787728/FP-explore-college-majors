8548300,1,B00A8KJMA6,"From an outsider's clever irreverence, White's observations and commentary have degenerated into repetitive explicatives, an obsession with fellatio, and to me worst of all is ambivalently  reducing his third wife--hmm, no comment--to an foil.

His performance was akin to Andrew Dice Clay's decline into unfunny grossness, though Clay has become an excellent actor. The issue with White is how real is his projected and underscored alcoholism and distance abuse?

Enough. The point is  this DVD was sad and boring to watch, not worth the time or money.",1423958400,,553,5.32183908045977
