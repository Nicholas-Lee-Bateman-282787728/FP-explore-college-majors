4710202,5,B005IUIWNE,Great action. Jino kang is a true and real Martial Arts Grandmaster. The action is non stop with all styles of Martial Arts being shown.  If you want to see the best Martial Arts action movie in a long time get Fist 2 Fist,1322006400,5,222,4.045454545454546

8475075,3,B005IUIWNE,"Fist 2 Fist is the second passion project of auteur Jino Kang, a man whose martial arts philosophy reflects a balance of tradition and pragmatism. However, his movie merely reflects limited experience and resources, thereby scratching a rating thats disproportionate to the amount of effort that went into production. I can come up with plenty of action flicks worse than this one, but I still don't recommend it.

The story: A former cage fighting competitor (Kang,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blade-Warrior/dp/B0000714DB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blade Warrior</a>) must face his past when a vengeful mob boss (Bill Duff,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Human-Weapon/dp/B0013XZ6HU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Human Weapon</a>) is released from prison and seeks to destroy the life he's built.

Kangs theatrical presence reminds me of other masters who took up acting (e.g. Hwang Jang-Lee, Jun Chong), but he also reminds me of fellow action hero Hector Echavarria for his habit of placing his character in flattering situations while pretending it's tortured drama. The film dwells heavily on how his relationship with Bill Duffs character went sour, as well as their connection to an orphaned student (Peter Woodrow), but Im not buying either as a cause for emotional music. The movies decent as a simple action-thriller, but it stumbles when it tries to be anything more than that.

If theres one thing that director Kang enjoys more than ham drama, its fight scenes, and he stuffs his movie with 24 of 'em. His strength as a choreographer and his experience as a martial artist shine through: intricate ground-fighting is as prevalent as karate-style brawling, and both are delivered with equal amounts of energy and ingenuity. Disappointingly, their overall quality is tarnished by the claustrophobic camerawork and a tendency to feature interchangeable fighters who the viewer doesn't care about. Arch-villain Bill Duff only has a single fight, and its not particularly good, but at least he gets more of a chance to show off than the top MMA fighters mentioned on the DVD case (I think the producers were referring to Tim Lajcik and Gene LeBell, only the latter of which gets to fight at all).

Kang seems to rely very much on himself when it comes to making his pictures, and personally, I don't believe that he can go much further with this method. I can potentially see him as the star of movies he didn't direct, but unless he gives up the reins a little, I can only hope that he figures to start pulling the camera back while shooting his fight scenes. Dont go out of your way for this one.",1456444800,,2693,5.404761904761905

8475083,3,B005IUIWNE,"If ""Fist to Fist"" spent any significant budget I will be shocked. This film seems to be part documentary and part instructional video with a sloppy narrative. The acting from some of the actors is so terrible that it diminishes any fine acting from the others. There are scenes with Martial Arts legends and while training the hero's students for success in an underground cage match are shown doing a demonstration but this entry has little to do with the narrative. The hero drops off his students at each real life legend's gym when he could have taught them himself, hence-Instructional documentary. Sure I enjoyed the film but that is because I am interested in Martial Arts. There interestingly wasn't any traditional boxing employed. There was threats of sexual deviant behavior but no scenes of sex. If you want to see the greats of martial Arts who made MMA what it is today than you may enjoy this film but if you want to see an action packed thriller than skip this film.",1381276800,,982,4.682080924855492
