2750515,5,B000MV9O54,I have been wanting thest movies for years and when I was this collection at this price I had to buy it.  Love it.,1198540800,,114,3.75
2750516,4,B000MV9O54,"Three wonderful classic romantic movies in one package. What a great idea! And the price can't be beat. The only negative is that Doctor Zhivago is on a dual-sided disk. Of course, that was only a negative because there's nothing in the package that clearly indicates this and the print on the disk is so small it's difficult to read. Once you know to turn the disk over for part 2, it's not an issue.

I love these movies and having them in one package is terrific. In fact, I bought one for my daughter for Christmas. (I'll be sure to tell her about the Doctor Zhivago disk, of course.)",1196294400,6,588,4.345454545454546
2750517,3,B000MV9O54,"I have to agree with previous reviews that this was a great price for three great movies, however, I was very dissapointed with the packaging.  It appears that they took discs from the single sets (that probably were not selling) and repackaged them into this disc.  I tend to be very meticulous with my packaging, and it bothers me that the disc for Casablanca says DISC 1, but there is no DISC 2.  In addition, when you unfold the packaging, GWTW and CASABLANCA have ""pretty"" discs, and then you have the ugly clear faced disk for Zhivago.

It is true that if all you are looking for is the movie, then this a great set, but if you like packaging as well, buy the individual movies.",1192665600,38,684,4.404761904761905
2750518,4,B000MV9O54,"I love the quality of the reproductions.  Gone with the Wind is 2 disks, that is good, Casablanca is one disk, and why would they put Dr. Zhivago on a 2 sided disk?  Couldn't the producers of this set put Dr Z on 2 disks also for those of us who store our disks in a machine?",1187913600,7,275,3.807017543859649
2750519,5,B000MV9O54,"This set is a bargain. Three of the finest movies of all time in one set for about $30.00. Packaging is done well, with a nice cover. For those who complain that ""Gone With the Wind"" is not in widescreen format - please understand that there is NO widescreen version of ""Gone With the Wind"" as widescreen didn't appear until the 1950's and GWTW (""Gone With the Wind"") was filmed in 1939! Great performances in all three films and GWTW's cinematography is so excellent that nearly every scene is a painting. So tragic that Leslie Howard, who played Ashley Wilkes in GWTW, was killed only a few years later in World War Two. Great movies all, and a great package deal.",1186185600,34,666,4.512396694214876
2750520,5,B000MV9O54,"These are three of my favorite movies with some of the best performances I have seen.

Clark Gable was great in ""Gone with the Wind"", but Vivien Leigh was magnificent and made me a lifelong fan with this movie.

Humphrey Bogart and the beautiful Ingrid Bergman, who could ask for more?  In ""Casablanca"" you also get a great script and ""As Time Goes By.""

""Doctor Zhivago"" gave me my first look into the Russia of the early 20th century.  It is also a passionate love story.",1173484800,20,473,4.453488372093023
2750521,5,B000MV9O54,It is AMAZING to find 3 classics such as these all together and for such a great price! What a deal!,1302998400,,100,3.8095238095238093
2750522,5,B000MV9O54,"I personally don't give a Damn about the packaging.  I bought it for three wonderful movies and the price... The films themselves are complete (no skipping through important scenes etc)  and, incidentially,  the packaging turned out to be just fine.",1271894400,,249,5.175
2750523,5,B000MV9O54,"I don't honestly care that the one disk that others are complaining about, does not have a printed image on it. Many DVD's come this way, and because it's a dual sided disk then they can't print on it.

Personally I'm happy with the price and quality of packing. If it really bothers you then buy them individually. Otherwise be happy at the saving!",1233878400,11,349,4.453125
2750524,5,B000MV9O54,These movies are classics and it is a nice package deal.  I recommend them.,1231718400,2,75,4.357142857142857

2750527,5,B000MV9O54,I bought these film a year and half ago for 12 bucks it was worth every dollar. If they were bought one at a time you would never beat this price. Even at the 20 bucks Amazon wants now it is still a great value. All three are AFI and Oscar winners and I think great films. There are a few extras on each.,1226793600,2,304,3.765625
2750528,5,B000MV9O54,The dvds are in excellent condition. Fast delivery. Very excited about this purchase. Thanks for the great service.,1213228800,2,115,5.444444444444445

8173064,5,B000MV9O54,"Warner Bros. always releases fantastic collection series, and the Warner Essential Classics always have some of the best films of all time on it, and it doesn't get any better than this! These are three among the best romances of all time.

  Gone With the Wind (1939)- 10/10- ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn"" Easily in my top 10 favorite films of all time. One of the greatest romances, one of the greatest epics, and one of the greatest films of all time. The story of Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) and Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) amongst the backdrop of the Civil War is a classic, and is definitely one of the best stories of all time. In the film's 3 hours and 53 minutes, there isn't a dull moment. Every scene is phenomenal with the acting, the costumes, the color. Everything is perfect in this film. It's one of those films where it's so fantastic that words can't even describe. The 2-disc version on this set isn't the best quality, but it's still great.

  Casablanca (1942)- 10/10- While I do prefer ""Gone With the Wind"" more, I do truly believe ""Casablanca"" is the better romance film (After all it is considered the greatest romance film according to the American Film Institute). Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman have amazing chemistry as two lovers during WWII. The story of love and love lost is fantastic and the black-and-white cinematography intensifies it along with great direction from Michael Curtiz. It has one of the all-time great film endings and it's a film to remember. You'll want to ""play it"" again and again! The quality of the film on this DVD is very good!

  Doctor Zhivago (1965)- 10/10- It's different from the previous 2 films, but this David Lean-directed film is an epic like no other.  It has Omar Sharif, Geraldine Chaplin, and Julie Christie in a love triangle during the Russian Revolution. In the film's 3 1/2 hours, it's full of intensity, fantastic color, beautiful settings, amazing romance, memorable music including the score, and a truly great story. It's not as famous as GWTW or Casablanca, but it's one of the all-time great romance films that every classic film fan should see. Also, I must add that the remastering is top notch on the DVD. I felt like I was watching a film from the 21st century. The video and audio was absolutely fantastic!

These three films all have to do with love and love lost during a certain war, and these are films that have stood the test of time after decades and decades. Also, people shouldn't be complaining of the packaging. Just because the discs are pulled from previous releases, along with ""Doctor Zhivago"" being a dual-sided disk, it doesn't mean the quality isn't good. All in all, this is a must-have!",1329436800,,3018,4.831067961165049
