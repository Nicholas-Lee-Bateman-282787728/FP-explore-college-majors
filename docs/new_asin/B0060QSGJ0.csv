4923943,5,B0060QSGJ0,"I love Memphis. My sister and I have seen it at least 3 times since it came out and love it. It is a fun musical and if you have not seen it and are buying the dvd, do both buy the dvd so you can watch it as many times as you want but also see the musical because when you go to the musical it keeps it going and their is nothing like the atmosphere at a Broadway Musical. Knowing how much I love this musical I will probably have to buy myself another copy after a few months because I will watch this DVD so much. The musical has soul and is one of the most amazing musical of this generation.",1327449600,,595,3.806451612903226
4923944,5,B0060QSGJ0,"I saw this play on broadway not too long ago and was blown away by the acting and mainly the musical scores.  There is a little bit of something for all in here, comedy; drama; sounds and sights.  They were selling this DVD for $30.00 at the door so this is a steal!  Next best thing to being there but if you get the chance go see the actual play.",1326931200,20,348,3.942857142857143

I have already pre-ordered the DVD and can't wait for it to arrive.  The instant stream is amazing.  They really did a great job filming and you truly feel like you are there in person.  It's also great to see the original Huey in the cast as I saw him perform the role before he left the cast for medical reasons.  It's an amazing show live and an amazing show filmed.",1324771200,18,494,4.268817204301075

The music, as I was told, was fantastic and the plot was such a great concept. Unfortunately, I felt absolutely no chemistry between Huey and Felicia, two characters who were (supposedly I guess?) having an epic and forbidden love affair. The actors seemed to be going through the motions. That was too bad, because the story could have been so much better had that chemistry been there.",1408320000,,494,4.755813953488372

4924037,5,B0060QSGJ0,"What a treat to have this performance on DVD!  The Broadway Musical Production won four Tony Awards including Best Musical for 2010.  The show played on Broadway from 2009 to 2012, and is currently touring.

The time is set in the 50s with Huey Calhoun, played by Chad Kimball, a white DJ, who loves the rhythm and blues sound, and he arrives against opposition, on the scene, to a black underground club to convince the black patrons that he is real and into soul music.  Huey has an air of coolness to him, shows some swagger, and is white-boy suave.  And, mainly, he  knows how to sell records,  He falls for the club owner's sister, making her own way into the music industry.  Together, they have a mission.

From there, the story follows the love between a white dj and a black musician.  The theme is about race relations of the time.  There is one incidence of violence, but it is done without offending the audience.

It's clear to see why this musical won the Tony Award... with plenty of fun, lively songs, robust dancing, colorful costumes, and a very good storyline.  I don't think there can be another Huey Calhoun, as the original Broadway performer, Chad Kimball was outstanding in the role.

The music is pure exhilarating rock and roll.  The founding member of Bon Jovi, David Bryan was behind the musical production.  This great Broadway musical is filled with music and dance.

The changing sets were very impressive, well done also.  If you want a fun musical performance, try this one.....Rizzo",1356480000,2,1516,4.699619771863118

This award winning production is based on a true story of the beginnings of Rock and Roll. If you weren't aware or around during this bit of history and even if you were, it is really informative and thought provoking as well as entertaining.  Lot's of behind the scenes of what didn't make the newspapers and tabloids.

A piece of innovation and genius is that they  filmed this during an actual performance while it was still on Broadway.  It gives you the feeling of being in the audience of the Shubert theater without having to travel out of your living room.

My advise is to buy yourself a copy, pop some corn, invite your friends, insert the video into your DVD player, sit back and enjoy the whole experience of Memphis.",1349654400,,1102,4.415841584158416

By Lorenzo M.

 Yes, I understand why this production received the ""2010 Best Musical of the Year Tony Award' - it was energetic, it was upbeat, it was passionate, it was colorful and it was fun! This current production at the Pantages Theatre in Hollywood of Memphis - contains some of the most amazing vo
cal talent I have ever seen on a live stage.

Director Christopher Ashley (Director of the Broadway revival of The Rocky Horror Picture Show and the first Broadways run of Xanadu) along with writers David Bryan (music and lyrics) and Joe DiPietro (lyrics and book) made a toe-tapping, hand-slapping, energetic musical based loosely on a real Memphis disc jockey Dewey Phillips who is one of the first white DJ's to play black music in the 1950's.

First I want to say - still not completely gone even today - racial discrimination was mean, sometimes brutal and often slow to change. This play makes a real issue very clear that there is always an upside to accepting people for who they are and what they believe in. Including love itself - and which love knows no boundaries, no limits and especially knows no skin color of any race.

The talent abounds in this entire production and let me start with Bryan Fenkart, playing Huey - the man who changed the `sound' of radio by introducing the white community to the `Soul' of Rhythm and Blues (and the heart of Rock'N'Roll!)! His spot-on southern accent, superb timing and acting chops and especially his vocal talents spark a musical explosion of emotions toward his love for a black woman and the music that moves his very own soul. He amazingly delivers the hysterically written song ""Hello, My Name Is Huey""- and sets the tone of his whole mission. But, his most amazing solo number is ""Memphis Lives In Me"" - a heart-wrenching cry of his inner soul.

His girlfriend Felicia, played by the beautiful Felecia Boswell, is sassy, smart and full of passion with her desire to move up and out of the slums of Memphis and pursue a musical career. Ms. Boswell performance is amazingly sharp and ever-present with passion - however her vocal talents will amaze you. She can sing with power and range and duration that I have not seen on stage live in a long time. She shines with her song ""Colored Woman"".

Bryan and Felecia, when singing together, have amazing vocal harmony and timing with their combined musical numbers like ""Ain't Nothing But A Kiss"", ""Make Me Stronger"" and ""Love Will Stand"". They made the audience roar with applause.

Another standout and show-stopping performance came from Huey's `Mama' - played by the amazingly talented and vocally stunning actress/singer Julie Johnson. She literally stops the show to a thunderous applause with her musical number ""Change Don't Come Easy"". Not only can she sing, harmonize and scat like no one I've ever heard before, but she has comic timing and strong witty deliveries that make you cheer for her character throughout the production.

All of the supporting cast had amazing vocal talents, from the deep vocal styling's of Quentin Earl Darrington playing Felicia's brother to the large Janitor with the amazing song and dance moves played by the talented Will Mann - to the amazingly charming and funny station manager Mr. Simmons played hysterically by William Perry.

The rest of the ensemble keeps the energy high with their vocal talents and energetic dance moves which were designed by the choreographer Sergio Trujillo who created some of the most entertaining and original steps for this time-sensitive play.

Some of the most amazing numbers include, ""Underground"", ""The Music of My Soul"", ""Radio"", ""Stand Up"", ""Tear Down The House' and the showing stopping finale of ""Steal Your Rock'N'Roll"".

A special note to the Scenic Design by David Gallo and Lighting Design of Howell Binkly who created a set and look that was not only candy for the eye but simplistic and yet functional to make us believe in this story and characters. It included live video feeds, color set pieces and a stage that moved in and out to create locations - musically - in seconds. Special note as well to the time-accurate details and colorful costuming done by Paul Tazewell too!

This musical is MUST-SEE. Nominated for nine Tony Awards and winner of four - including Best Musical, Best Book, Best Orchestration and Best Score - this is a really great show, with an extremely talented cast and musicians. It's worth the price of the ticket to see the performances of Bryan, Felicia and especially Julie and it's exactly a production like this that reminds me why I really love Musicals so much! Go see it!",1344124800,6,4641,4.821383647798742
4924052,5,B0060QSGJ0,"Very nice souvenir. We saw this musical in New York, liked it very much and for a long time we could not buy a video!
Now we are happy with this video!",1339113600,,151,3.75
4924053,5,B0060QSGJ0,"I became interested in Memphis - the musical when I happened to stumble upon it on Netflix.  I liked it, enough that when the Blu-ray became available, I ordered it knowing the superior picture and sound would be much appreciated.  I was not disappointed and loved it!

First, the technical achievement of filming a live stage show and presenting it with first rate sound is exemplary.  The production crew succeeded in a big way.  The performances by the actors is no less commendable.

Some don't like Chad Kimball's portrayal of Huey Calhoun (somewhat based on real-life DJ, Dewey Phillips).  I get that, but I find him to be authentic in a goofy Gomer Pyle sort of way.  With his optimism, humor, passion for music and indifference to race (in the 1950's), he is likeable.  His manerisms take some getting used to, but so what?  His heart and soul is really, well, the heart and soul of the show.  Being the Felicia character is black and apparently has much more going for her than Huey does - and that she falls for him after seeing his passion and doing so much to realize her dreams, it isn't so unimagineable that they are drawn to each other.  Not by a long way.

Montego Glover is phenomenal.  She sings the pants off every tune she attempts.  ""Colored Women"" is a definite highlight.  The supporting cast is excellent too.  There are many fine performances, right down to the last ensemble member.  This isn't high-brow or sophisticated musical theatre, but it is extremely entertaining if you like good music, good acting and good story telling.

I had the good fortune to see the tour of Memphis recently, and it is even better than the excellent Blu-ray recording of the Broadway cast.  If you get a chance to see it in person, don't miss it.  The entire cast was awesome.",1337126400,2,1787,4.627388535031847
4924054,5,B0060QSGJ0,Always good to see a release of a filmed Broadway show. People who want a memento or people who missed the show or weren't in a position to see it can get the opportunity. This is a really good show and this is very well done balancing the feel of a show with closer cuts for dramatic and comedic heightening. I hope more shows go down this path rather than a filmed concert performance. Enjoyable,1337126400,,397,4.306666666666667
4924055,5,B0060QSGJ0,"Book, music, and cast are exceptional.  The lithe and lovely Montego Glover is funny, sensitive, soulful, immensely talented, Chad Kimball is absolutely extraordinary, a character actor in a classic romantic role, endlessly inventive, all heart, a great soul. My favorite musical of all time.",1336435200,,292,5.636363636363637
4924056,4,B0060QSGJ0,"Today I saw the 2:00 showing of the 2010 Tony Award winner Memphis on Broadway.  I was super excited, as this was my chance to finally see Rent alum Adam Pascal perform live on stage.  I had met him years ago at the screener for the film adaptation of Rent, but I had yet to see him sing in person.  Not only did he nearly move me to tears with his powerful voice, but the rest of the cast did such a fine job that I was sure the audience would have danced right along with them if there was no seating!

Memphis centers on a white disc jockey, Huey Calhoun, who has a particular affinity for ""race"" music during a time when this is obviously still a taboo subject: the 1950s.  He wanders into a club (""Delray's"") which is owned by the brother of Felicia, who sings at the club and instantly charms Huey.  He promises to get her on the radio one day if a local radio station will give him a job.  ""If I get on the radio, you'll get on the radio.""  After being fired for selling ""race"" music records like hot cakes at his department store job, Huey lands a job as a DJ where his success continues as he plays ""race"" music over the local radio.  As Huey's success grows, so does Felicia's.  She finds herself both falling for Huey and embarking on his endeavors, despite the protests of Huey's prejudicial mother and the horrific violence Huey and Felicia ultimately endure.

Huey eventually lands a variety show starring all black dancers.  He is offered the chance to break out of Memphis, Tennessee and into the big leagues if he changes his cast to all white dancers.  Simultaneously, Felicia desperately wants to move up north to New York and begs Huey to come with her.  She desires freedom from the dangers of racism that came with her relationship with Huey, as well as that of simply living everyday life.  Huey can't imagine ever leaving Memphis, as it is his home and a part of who he is.

Memphis is, at times, like one large gospel revival; it encourages the audience to shout ""Hallelujah!"".  As the doo-wop of the 50's gives way to rock 'n' roll over the course of the play, the musical tone noticeably varies to give way to more of a bluesy and rockabilly feel.  As Felicia remarks at one point, ""rock 'n' roll is just Negro blues speeded up!""  That's the beauty of Memphis.  It comingles rock 'n' roll and the blues in the same way that it comingles people of differing races.  We are all the same, just slightly different.

Adam Pascal was as enjoyable as I always knew he would be, particularly during his solo ""Memphis Lives in Me"".  He hit the high notes with such gusto that I believe I forgot to breathe for a second.  He played Huey Calhoun with a convincingly simple mind and an impeccable accent.  I am thrilled that I finally got to see him on the Broadway stage.

Montego Glover was phenomenal as Felicia and hers and the rest of the company's costumes were simply gorgeous.  My two favorites in particular were her red satin pumps and her sparkly, Barbie-like gown that was simply breath-taking.  Glover also brings a naivety to her role that makes your heart break for her.  I strongly suggest seeing her while she is still with the company, as both she and Pascal intend on leaving the show in the fall of 2012.  Glover originated the role and no replacement is yet lined up.

J. Bernard Calloway was my third favorite actor in his role as Delray.  He has some of the best lines and his delivery of certain lines roused plenty of laughs from the audience.  James Monroe Iglehart was an instant favorite as Bobby, who reminded me of Amos from Chicago in that he was the underdog for which everyone rooted and we all felt similar pangs of happiness to see him succeed and break out of his shell.

Memphis is a bluesy production with an old-timey feel that provides all three elements of a successful Broadway production: fantastic music, awe-inspiring costumes (and costume changes!) and a solid story.  If you were alive during the 1950s, I recommend this highly, as you will probably gain an extra layer of enjoyment from having experienced first-hand the history that fostered this production.  For the rest of us, I recommend it for its hilarity, rollicking numbers and visuals.  I was also surprised to learn that the keyboardist for New Jersey's own rock legends Bon Jovi, David Bryan, co-wrote the score!  You will leave the theater with a positive mind and a song on your lips.

For me, seeing Memphis was like flipping through channels, landing on a program I wouldn't normally watch and feeling rewarded for putting down the remote.",1336176000,,4568,4.531135531135531

4924061,5,B0060QSGJ0,"My hubby and I are so glad Amazon carries this fantastic movie of the Best Broadway Musical of 2010, ""Memphis the Musical.""
We watched it on PBS, got blown away with joy and amazement, ordered it right away, and now have seen it for the third time.  It's very rare for us to watch anything more than once!  We also like to re-visit some clips on YouTube.
I still marvel that the cast must perform at this peak-level talent and excellence for nightly performances and even matinees, well-captured in this video.  My admiration for their thrilling performance abilities - and their stamina! -- just knows NO bounds!
Especially since ALL the material is superb - the songs and dances dramatically portray the 1950's themes of social injustice via radio stations' suppression of black music - and of course the big taboo against black/white romances. Our hero-DJ Huey Calhoun (the utterly awesome singer Chad Kimball, playing this sometimes goofy but very intelligent guy) tries to pioneer the breakthroughs in both the music and the relationships, at his great personal expense.  There is sorrow, yes - but also hilarity and triumph galore!  And it is hard not to love and admire every single member of this fun and fabulous cast.
This is an overall thrilling entertainment experience - a great story brought to dazzling life in a tremendous production!",1332806400,2,1350,4.929515418502203

4924063,4,B0060QSGJ0,"Ordinarily, I wouldn't be caught dead listening to rock, being far too old.  I like classical music, especially opera, and the popular music of the 'Thirties and 'Forties.  Nevertheless, taken in the context of the play, I found the music appropriate and more moving and exciting than that of any modern opera I've heard.  The cast is great, except for the doofus who played Huey.  I can't imagine any woman, black, white, brown or green with purple polka dots, being interested in him. He cost my rating one point and was trying for two.  Despite him, I heartily recommend this performance.",1330473600,2,591,4.811881188118812
4924064,2,B0060QSGJ0,"This musical won Best Musical.  Its a good production and a very good DVD with great sound and sharp picture.  I really wanted to like this.  But the subject matter was handled so much better and with humor in Hairspray.  The songs are decent but unmemorable. But the REAL problem is the male lead who insists on talking like Deputy Dawg or James Cagney.  I never got used to it.  It is so incredibly annoying that you simply cannot buy the bi-racial relationship he gets into with a woman who offers so much, while he offers nothing but obnoxious exuberance and annoyance.  If the lead actor were to cut out his speaking pauses while speaking his lines, the show would easily be a half-hour shorter--and sweeter.

The production values of this show, the dancing, singing and most of the acting was excellent but what on earth was the actor portraying the main character ""Huey"" (or the director of the show) trying to do - a bad copy of Michael Crawford in the awful British TV series ""Some mother do have 'em"". This ridiculously over the top performance spoiled the show for me, apart from the fact that I could hardly understand a word he was saying or singing.

4924069,4,B0060QSGJ0,"I never met a musical I didn't like so had high hopes for Memphis: The Musical.  I own all the videos of Stephen Sondheim's shows.  I also have the Blu-ray of the highly regarded 2006 revival of Company.  The failure of any of those videos to have closed captions, however, has made me vow never to buy another one that doesn't have them.  Apparently the Memphis Blu-ray  is visually stunning and comes with a fine DTS-HD MA audiotrack but it also lacks closed captions.  That ended the inquiry for me, I won't be buying it.

Nearly all Broadway musicals are packed with intricate lyrics, which it's important to fully understand to fully appreciate the story that is being told.  Also, Broadway performers are not noted for having uniformly perfect diction.  Despite having good hearing, I think it is nearly impossible to fully understand the lyrics in a musical theater piece without captions.  CAVEAT:  For those of you who are not insistent as I am about fully understanding lyrics, the Memphis Blu-ray would probably be a great buy for you.  That's why I rated the Blu-ray at 4 Stars out of 5 sight unseen.  Enjoy it, I'm just sorry that I can't.",1329350400,,1152,4.6716417910447765
