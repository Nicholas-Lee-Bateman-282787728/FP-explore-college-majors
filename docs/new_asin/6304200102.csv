7866173,1,6304200102,"The seller ""guarantees"" that this DVD is ""Region Free"" despite the delivered disc clearly marked as Region 4.

An added sticker on the sealed DVD states: ""This DVD is ""Region Free: also known as ""All Region."" There is no regional
coding block on this DVD. It will play on any DVD player without special additional restrictions.""  **NOT TRUE!**
I tried the disc on several Sony, Panasonic DVD players and all state that they cannot play the disc ...

As this is my first purchase from ""HONESTWILL,"" I hope future sales are backed up with working knowledge
of his product. ""Guarantees"" are worthless and a waste of everyone's time and money if they are invalid.",1300924800,,659,4.7631578947368425
7866174,1,6304200102,"My review is bad enough very negative.
The movie was just copied in VHS quality on a 'official'  dvd release.
Even some parts in the movie ware cut out.
Maybe a a little to much of (non sexual) nudity, but later on in the movie you're able to see everything.
So the cutting was with no reason. Even on our national tv we could see the normal version of this movie.
Very disappointing tough, bad luck probably?",1283126400,,409,4.311688311688312
7866175,5,6304200102,Antonie Kamerling is GREAT as Chris. Every time I show this film I am told by the people present that they are completely taken by this film. It can be difficult to sit through bacause of the manipulative way Chris is treated... but it is a frightening look into shady characters of the under-world....  It`s daring... it`s haunting... it`s great...,1089590400,,349,4.816666666666666
7866176,2,6304200102,"The technicians who did the telecine work on this DVD product should be sent back to video school. Not only is the widescreen movie framed to 4:3 (cutting off the left and right sides), but the picture is ""overscanned"" (cutting off the top and bottom portions) as well. At least 30% of the widescreen frame cannot be seen--hiding some of the subtitles. For those movie lovers interested in an absorbing European erotic thriller, may I recommend the VHS form of ""Suite 16"" distributed in Canada by Norstar Entertainment/Malofilm. Their widescreen transfer is properly done. Perhaps these Canadians can produce the DVD product sometime soon.
Note: There are at least three different ""cuts"" of this film: 106 minutes (European version), 98 minutes (Canada R-rated version), 93 minutes (U.S. R-rated version).",1016582400,10,805,5.248062015503876
