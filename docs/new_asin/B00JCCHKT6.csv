8649722,1,B00JCCHKT6,"I was very glad to find this attempt at a film: good price, prompt delivery and so on. The film itself is total crap. No wonder it seems to have directly from the film process to the Giveaway Bin. Yes, it's as bad as the initial reviews promised. Really, what is the sound of no hands clapping?",1424736000,,294,4.175438596491228
8649723,5,B00JCCHKT6,Great action movie which grabbed my attention from the start and never let go.  Another strong performance from Juliette Bennett as she continues to captivate audiences.,1423785600,,169,5.5

8649725,4,B00JCCHKT6,"I co-hosted a movie night and chose Shame the Devil - it was a perfect movie to watch with friends. We kept trying to guess the motives of the killer and the suspense kept us engaged, Like any good thriller there is a twist that was unexpected. Interesting concept film with religious messages and nicely shot. Juliette and Simon had some great chemistry and provided the tension needed to maintains the audience's attention. .",1422748800,,427,4.783783783783784
8649726,3,B00JCCHKT6,"Shame The Devil is one of those movies that's not stellar but also not a horrible way to waste an hour and a half. The opening scene and the doctor's office debacle were fun to watch, and the acting was pretty decent (most of the time). I found some of the old girlfriend stuff a little lame and unrealistic, but I did like the ""trick"" ending a whole lot. Overall a fun movie to watch when you're bored and out of options.",1414108800,2,422,4.158536585365853
8649727,3,B00JCCHKT6,"James (Simon Phillips) is a detective investigating the strange deaths of a ""you lie you die"" serial killer. The killer uses a lie detector as a trigger mechanism to kill its victims. The killings start to center around James who is released from the case. Determined to still solve the crimes, James flies to NY to see a crime profiler who happen to be an old girlfriend (Juliette Bennett). His pregnant wife (Lucy Clements) doesn't want him to go.

The opening scene made me chuckle. The killer had a Saw-like attitude and feel. This is a crime/thriller with a touch of horror. Film includes your basic twist, nothing fancy, and an ending I might have done differently.

Good rental.

F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1396051200,,712,4.725806451612903
