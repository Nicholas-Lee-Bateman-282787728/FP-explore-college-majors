8115242,4,B000EWWEL2,"Great film. Good character development and plot,. I saw it at a theater and decided to buy my own  copy,but  discovered my copy won't play on my USA DVD player. I would have thought the seller would have alerted customers to this  before offering it, but not my seller, so be careful; before you buy if you have a DVD  pplayer from the USA like I do. My copy now just sits around and i plan on giving it to my cousins the next time I am in Italy.",1522713600,,446,3.9775280898876404
8115243,1,B000EWWEL2,"I'm sure it is a great film, however they say that it is compatible for all regions, I have 3 DVD players in my Household, all 2 years old or less and it worked in none of them.
I am very disappointed.",1450483200,,201,3.8095238095238093
8115244,5,B000EWWEL2,"A neat historical thriller, fiorile is my first Taviani film, but it probably won't be my last. I hadn't really read much about the film, except to form the opinion that it was probably a routine quality children's fantasy film, so I let it pass me by for years. It is actually a historical thriller about several generations of a family, told as a tale to the children of the present day family, mingled with a caution about the legend's possible effect on the children. There are some rather predictable elements to the film, but the acting is excellent by all, and the sumptuous Italian settings give a feel of Shakespeare mixed with the modern day, and the ending has considerable style. Well worth adding to your collection.",1420329600,,729,4.703125
