I am glad that Kultur Video kept this available for a while longer -- it originated as a public television documentary -- and only wish that they, or someone else, would turn it into a dvd, possibly combining it with other, historical footage.

Like the other reviewer, I have used this for classroom viewing and discussion. I do not agree that the first part of the film moves too slowly, but perhaps its detailed discussion of Anderson's early years and especially the importance of her church affiliation in Philadelphia works better with college students.

A star-studded group of talking heads is present: Howard Taubman, Isaac Stern, Todd Duncan (the first Porgy), Jessye Norman, Mattiwilda Dobbs (the SECOND black woman to appear at the Met), and representatives of the Sol Hurok agency. It's narrated by Avery Brooks. Very classy production values. The spot in which Duncan talks about his personal reactions to hearing Anderson sing ""My country, 'tis of Thee..."" at the Lincoln Memorial concert is an emotional highlight. Other concert footage features Stokowski, Toscanini, and recital moments with Anderson's longtime accompanists Kosti Vehannan and Hans Rupp (I hope I spelled their names correctly).

Extremely worthwhile viewing. Strongly recommended.",1274659200,3,1488,5.319148936170213

There are very inspirational and touching moments, however, it takes a while to get to the meaty portion of the video.  The beginning is very dry and the movie takes a while to get moving.",983145600,4,272,4.313725490196078
