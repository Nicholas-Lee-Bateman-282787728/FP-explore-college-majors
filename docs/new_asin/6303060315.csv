556389,5,6303060315,I absolutely loved this movie when I was younger and I am trying to find it to purchase.  Can anyone help me out?  Please respond with where to buy it.  I have googled and have come up empty handed. THANKS!,1161043200,,206,4.1
556390,5,6303060315,"I beleive this special first aired in 1978. That was when I first saw it. The one thing that really got my attention and sticks in my mind the most,is Alexander Graham Wolf's striking resemblance to While E.Coyote. I suppose that's partly due to Chuck Jones. It was like seeing Raggedy Ann and Andy meet While E.Coyote""super genius"".",1145923200,,333,4.758620689655173
556391,3,6303060315,"I just bought the video brand new, with both the ""Pumpkin"" & the ""Christmas"" specials on it (60 minutes) for $23 including shipping. I know I'm not permitted to link where but just ""google"" on the pertinent names & the site comes up readily.",1127779200,,241,4.5
556392,5,6303060315,"If you want this film, first seek out a copy of the original video release, which was the double feature that also included Raggedy Ann and Andy and the Great Santa Claus Caper (the Christmas special). That's the one I have, and I recommend it not only because it has the bonus of the Christmas Special, but also because I have the Christmas Special from THIS video company and it is a very poor quality recording, so I assume this Halloween video is also a low quality recording. Now, about The actual cartoon:
Raggedy Ann and Andy and the Pumpkin Who Couldn't Smile is a Halloween Special I've loved since I was a kid! I'm a big fan of Holiday Specials, and the two Raggedy Ann and Andy Holiday specials, along with the feature film, Raggedy Ann and Andy: A Musical Adventure, made me big fans of the Raggedy characters.
In my opinion, any Raggedy fan MUST have a copy of this Holiday Special, even if the video tape is below par. This and the Christmas one were both done by animation legend, Chuck Jones. He's the guy who directed How the Grinch Stole Christmas, among other classic cartoons! This story, which I believe may have been made back in the '60's, though I could be mistaken, tells the story of a Jack O' Lantern that has not been bought, and it's already Halloween Night! Meanwhile, a little boy sits crying in his bed because his aunt has forgotten how much fun Halloween is, and won't let him take part. Raggedy Ann and Andy decide to help the little boy, and set out to get him a Jack O'Lantern for Halloween. After quite a chase involving the Police, Ann, Andy, their dog Arthur, and the sad Pumpkin, finally make their way into the boy's arms, and the boy and the Pumpkin are overjoyed to have each other. With one problem solved, Ann and Andy creep into Auntie's room to whisper into her ear reminders of how much fun Halloween was when she was a kid. With her memory restored, she takes her little nephew out for a night of belated Trick or Treating!
  This is a very cute and charming little Halloween Special, and there aren't enough of those, so I recommend any Halloween, animation, or Raggedy fan pick this up while they can!",1023840000,,2153,4.461928934010152
556393,5,6303060315,"My copy at least, was a terrible one. If you want this film, seek out a copy of the original video release first, which was the double feature that also included Raggedy Ann and Andy and the Pumpkin Who Couldn't Smile (the Halloween special). Now, about THIS cartoon:
  Raggedy Ann and Andy and the Great Santa Claus Caper is a Christmas Special I've loved since I was a kid! I'm a big fan of Holiday Specials, and the two Raggedy Ann and Andy Holiday specials, along with the feature film, Raggedy Ann and Andy: A Musical Adventure, made me a big fan of the Raggedy characters.

This and the Halloween one were both done by animation legend, Chuck Jones. He's the guy who directed How the Grinch Stole Christmas, among other classic cartoons! In this story, which is obviously targeted at very young kids, and I believe may have been made back in the '60's, though I could be mistaken, tells the story of a big bad wolf who wants to take over Christmas! He sets up a factory at the North Pole that specializes in covering Santa's Toys in ""Gloopstick"", a substance that preserves them forever, though they're not very useful. His idea is that now Santa will have to start charging for the toys, and give HIM part of the profits, since Gloopstick is HIS invention. Comet the Reindeer flies Raggedy Ann and Andy in to help her stop the rotten wolf and save Christmas!
  As I said, this is targeted at younger viewers, and an older viewer would probably have to have loved it as a kid to appreciate it. But as for any negative comments about the animation quality, well, it's standard Chuck Jones (a legend), so I think that speaks for itself.
  As an added note, the two holiday specials are the only places you'll find one of my favorite cartoon characters, Raggedy Arthur, the dog!",1023840000,,1905,4.501449275362319
556394,3,6303060315,"My daughter loves Raggedy Ann.  I have purchased several books that she throughly enjoys.  Due to the low price, I purchased this video.  The video has 3 cartoons.  The first one features Raggedy Ann.  This is an old cartoon probably made in the 40's or 50's by the creator of Raggedy Ann-- John G.  The cartoon is about how Raggedy Ann helps a blind girl ""see"" through her imagination. This cartoon is simply wonderful!! Unfortunately, the next two cartoons are not so great and do not feature Raggedy Ann.  The second one is about a fair and the third one sounds like it is dubbed.",983923200,,583,4.495238095238095
7836930,2,6303060315,"The party which shipped my ""good condition"" movie, was not honest about the condition of the movie. There was multiple lines across the screen and even with the volume all the way up most of the movie was inaudible. I do love the movie however. Paying full price for the new unopened movie is in my opinion worth it.",1478131200,,316,4.372881355932203
7836931,5,6303060315,"Cute and funny little cartoon about Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy, their dog Arthur and their quest to find a pumpkin for a lonely little boy.  It's cute and in places very funny.  I wish they would put it on DVD.",1477872000,,212,4.146341463414634

7836934,5,6303060315,This was a gift for our eldest daughter.  She grew up with Raggedy Ann & Andy cartoon movies & this Christmas one was one of her very favorites.  She's thrilled to have it once again.,1388188800,,183,4.2
7836935,5,6303060315,As a little girl I saw this on tv and fell in love with it because I watched it with my dad and he enjoyed it as well.,1383696000,,118,3.25
7836936,5,6303060315,"Yes, I know that that title sounds awkward, but I do like snuggling my Raggedy Ann and Andy dolls while watching a good movie or cartoon, and I am a HUGE Halloween nerd.

This cartoon classic is very appropriate for all ages, the animation is great and the scores are very memorable and charming. Raggedy Ann and Andy discover that a little boy, Ralph, is not being allowed to celebrate Halloween with the other children in the neighborhood because of the rules his aunt Agatha sets out for him, and they hear him ask her for a pumpkin if he can't even have fun on Halloween. When she says no, Ann and Andy call on Raggedy Arthur, their skateboarding dog, and the three of them go off in search of a pumpkin for Ralph. Meanwhile, a lonely pumpkin in a pumpkin patch is crying, thinking he won't be wanted by anyone since Halloween was soon to be over. So, in all reality, this is a story about both friendship, love and the spirit of giving happiness to others. Personally, as a child, I used to watch this VHS over and over every year and nearly every time, I would, and I still do, cry along with that adorable pumpkin. I loved this classic so much as a young girl that I actually wanted a pumpkin just like the one featured in the cartoon so I could make him happy every Halloween and sit him with my own Raggedy Ann doll.",1379721600,,1325,4.3
7836937,5,6303060315,"I remember watching this on TV as a kid and loving it, the drawing is great but what else could you expect of the famous Chuck Jones of Road Runner and Whyle E Coyote fame.  This sweet little cartoon brings back so many memories for me and reminds me of when I was young enough to love Halloween the best of all the holidays!  I wish that who ever owns this would put it out on DVD or just play it again so people could record it.  So here's a tip for people who don't want to pay a hundred dollars for a video tape, even if it has never been watched I still think the tape must be pretty old. Go to You Tube and watch it for free because some kind soul has put it on there or if you need to own this go to Movie Lead.com and order a copy through the studio for about 50 bucks and you can get that on disk. It's a sweet little cartoon and if they put it out for halloween I would get it for about 10 dollars but paying a hundred for a old tape is a big rip off and the people who are charging this should be ashamed of themselves.",1290038400,,1030,3.803738317757009
7836938,5,6303060315,"Of all the Hallowe'en specials and cartoons four generations of our family have ever seen, this and Bugs Bunny's Transylvania 6-5000 are our favorites.  Bugs Bunny cartoons are better appreciated by adults, but this one is loved by everyone.  The well-crafted storyline, voices, and graphics set this 1979 Chuck Jones cartoon above even the Charlie Brown classic.  In this story, Raggedy Ann and Andy help two needy and lovable characters find happiness together.  How appropriate that a lonely pumpkin cries pumpkin seeds!  The tone is caring and gentle, and there is none of the loud rudeness so common to today's cartoons.  Although it has been years since we'd seen it, we all fondly remember it, and regret that it's not available for our new generation of children.  We highly recommend this well-made holiday special.",1224374400,,824,5.104477611940299
7836939,4,6303060315,"I love this movie since I can remember I would like my child to experience it like I did, its a great movie to watch and if anybody got this movie and its great shape I would love to add this to my collection.",1204156800,,209,3.772727272727273
