1979793,1,B000190776,"I was looking forward to this movie, but as I'm watching it, I have to say ""skip this film.""  These are basically a bunch of privileged, wealthy women, talking about how hard their lives are, and how unfair it is that older women can't get plum roles anymore.  Hey ladies, it's called reality.  This is what happens when you work in an industry that is totally geared toward youth and beauty.

They don't get to spend enough time with their kids.  Hey, what working mother does?  At least the time they aren't spending with their kids is the time they're jetting off to Italy and France to shoot glamorous movies, rather than just your jerky boss in your boring office job asking you to stay late again.  At least they can afford for their kids to live in luxury while they're on movie sets, rather than struggling to afford halfway decent child care.

This movie is nothing but wealthy, privileged women belly-aching about the drawbacks of their glamorous lives, and I can't see how any working mom could watch it without wanting to vomit.",1086739200,11,1040,4.614130434782608
1979794,5,B000190776,"I stumbled upon this movie totally unexpectedly and I am absolutely delighted that I found it!  What a wonderful idea to open up and search for answers by connecting to other people and in the process creating an inspiring piece of work!  Thank you Rosana for that! I absolutely loved the way Jane Fonda described her flow experiences while filming certain pivotal scenes during her career.  She touched my heart deeply... : ) Such a life affirming movie!  You get that I am excited right?  I will definitely make sure that I tell people about it because it is not often that we get to see the actresses we have grown so accustomed to watching on screen let us see their spirit in such fashion.
Definitely see this movie!",1080604800,9,721,4.558139534883721
1979795,4,B000190776,"It seems so effortless, yet so rich in content and inspiring for people to take one step back and take a good look at today's Hollywood; especially in the light of actresses and their personal insight of their career. Thoughtful and well deserve your attention. Jane Fonda's interview was so engaging and powerful. A film from the heart of Rosanna Arquette not to be missed.",1080432000,7,374,4.769230769230769
1979796,4,B000190776,"The reviewer here says that Winger is special because she...'bows out during her prime.' Wrong! She sees no pictures in which women can act in their prime! During the entire film it is observed that as women age, of course they get better at their craft. But they cannot use these skills, because the thing that is prized above all in Hollywood in 'f*ck*bility.'",1079568000,4,362,4.671875
1979847,3,B000190776,"There are two ways to watch this movie either as a fan of the many actresses or as a documentary of women who struggle to balance work and life.

The gems of the movie were the insights by the women.  Here's one from Whoopi Goldberg, ""Longevity is everything. We have outlasted most of the people that used to hire us.""  You can see more interesting quotes on IMDB, some not appropriate for this forum.

At times, this movie felt like you were invited in to sit down with some girlfriends, drink wine, and chat.  The actresses became more human with their insights and intelligence.  Rosanne's admiration of her fellow actresses was endearing to me, I'm sure to others it would be sickly sweet.

It would have been helpful to have a little more context around the topic, the industry and the actresses.  I didn't seem like a documentary to me, more like Rosanna Arquette's personal video blog.
Bottom line: We all have choices, these are the choices some 40+ year old actresses made in their lives.",1291680000,3,998,4.630681818181818
1979848,3,B000190776,"Maybe my expectations were too high, but I thought I was going to like this doc a lot more than I did. So much of it seemed so superficial--Arquette had a great idea but she doesn't ask the greatest questions and therefore doesn't elicit a lot of great answers. Worth watching for the dinner scene with Margolies and Hannah et al where we're introduced to the term ""f***ability"" and for the interviews with Winger. It will definitely confirm all your worst suspicions about what drives Hollywood, and I'm hoping a lot of these women move into producing and directing so we get to see something more on screen than Spiderman 3 in future.",1290643200,3,636,4.6371681415929205
1979849,1,B000190776,"Some of the interview subjects in this movie are interesting individuals, others self-absorbed adolescents, but Ms. Arquette is essentially inarticulate and doesn't seem to know how to conduct an intelligent interview. Her interview subjects offer some interesting insights, especially into just how shallow some of them are, but Arquette isn't responsible for drawing them out. The interviewees present their views mostly well in spite of Arquette's ineptitude as an interviewer. Most often her ""questions"" aren't really questions at all, but rather range from sycophantic exclamations to inane observations about herself.

Avoid this turkey.",1256342400,7,643,5.913978494623656
1979850,3,B000190776,"There were many things I did and did not like about this documentary regarding ageism, women, and the double standard in Hollywood.  I remember reading an interview with Susan Anspach about ten or fifteen years ago complaining about parts drying up for women her age, yet the male actors she acted with at the start of her career were still going strong.  It was terrific to see Theresa Russell again, a wonderful and beautiful actress who never got a really big break.  Far and away Whoopi Goldberg was the strongest and most honest of all the interviewees, but since her career was never based on her looks, primarily on talent, I'm not sure that the challenge of ageism in Hollywood affects her as much.  My main complaint is that already this documentary seems dated and why not also reach out and include actresses who came before these leading ladies and also faced age discrimination and on a much broader scale.  Elizabeth Taylor and  Debbie Reynolds from the 1950's, some of the great actresses of the 1940's.  They aren't all dead and I believe that would have made this film stronger and packed a harder punch.",1226793600,4,1121,4.717948717948718
1979851,5,B000190776,"If you are a film buff and are interested in the listed actresses,this film will not disappoint. It highlights an issue that is very real and pervasive: where are the scripts and stories about adult women, for adult women and by adult women? It's well done and captivating.",1195171200,2,273,4.708333333333333
1979852,2,B000190776,"In 1996's ""The First Wives Club"", Goldie Hawn, as an aging actress, has a piercingly perceptive line courtesy of screenwriter Robert Harling, ""In Hollywood, women only have three ages: babe, district attorney, and 'Driving Miss Daisy'"". Actress Rosanna Arquette has decided to explore this unfortunately true perspective in her 2002 documentary where she speaks with thirty-five renowned actresses of varying ages. Even though it's doubtful any of them are facing economic hardship, their dilemmas would still make a worthy subject for a film, but she makes it such an overly personalized odyssey over her own tenuous success as a 43-year old actress and mother that she is unable to provide anything significantly insightful on the topic.

Instead, we are left with a film with some revealing moments but more commonly, a haphazard structure of interview snippets that seem to make the same set of points over and over again - the incessant struggle to find good roles for women past forty, the precarious balance between managing a career and raising a family, and the myopia of profit-minded studio executives interested in what teenage males want to see (at least according to film critic Roger Ebert, the only male interviewed). The problem is that Arquette, as a documentarian, cannot provide much-needed objectivity to her subject, as she repeatedly interjects with her personal experiences when she is not fawning over her subjects.  Her lack of discipline extends into her editing as there is no sense of organization to her narrative other than how she came upon the actresses, whether proactively seeking them out individually, organizing lunches (like what Jon Favreau does with his TV series, ""Dinner for Five"") or happening upon them at Cannes (like surprising a thankfully good-humored Frances McDormand in the ladies room). Truth be told, some come off quite badly as they fumble through unformed thoughts or mind-numbing analogies. Meg Ryan, Gwyneth Paltrow and Emmanuelle Bart come to mind.

Some like Robin Wright Penn and Charlotte Rampling reveal so little about themselves that their inclusion provides questionable value, and a self-consciously glamorous Sharon Stone comes across as rather disingenuous when she talks about her abandonment of vanity. But others provide nuggets of wisdom like Holly Hunter, Diane Lane, Salma Hayek, Martha Plimpton (who has forsaken movies for the stage) and a predictably funny Whoopi Goldberg. Leave it to veterans Vanessa Redgrave and Jane Fonda to offer the film's most honest, insightful comments, the latter especially revealing in how former husband Ted Turner encouraged her retirement and then sharing how she feels when she nails a pivotal scene in a movie. Fortunately, Debra Winger, whose self-imposed (and ultimately short-lived) retirement inspired the film's eponymous title, shows herself to be the trenchantly sardonic, perceptive non-conformist she obviously is. The film really contains very little when it comes to revelations about the inherent sexism of the film industry, and Arquette's personal catharsis frankly does not resonate enough to make the film worthwhile. Other than some trailers, the DVD has no extras.",1149379200,15,3196,5.400801603206413
1979853,2,B000190776,"Searching for Debra Winger woulda, coulda, shoulda.  What a complete disappointment for me to see famous actresses given the chance to peel away their manufactured facade for a few minutes only to be constantly interrupted by the interviewer who is a poor listener at best and one who obviously did no home work due to the fact that she kept asking, either the same question over and over again or injecting her opinion inside a question 'trying' to be answered.

There was a moment in the Russian Tea Room that should have set the tone for this documentary.  Instead it was completely ignored which is a feeling that runs throughout this docu.  The majority of these women's opinions were reduced to sound bites.  It was embarrassing when Holly Hunter who is in a word that was constantly used and used again, awesome, have her moment interrupted by the interviewer (shocker there) by injecting ""I want to see them.""  Poor, extremely poor and a good reason why there are journalist and actors and they are not one in the same.

1979854,2,B000190776,"Don't buy this, I did and sold it back. It's okay to watch once maybe, but not to buy. The first 30 min are pretty good,but the rest of the film are just the same old thing and nothing really interesting. BLAH!",1137110400,3,210,4.023809523809524
1979855,1,B000190776,"More like not even from the same planet. Folks, this abysmal ""documentary"" is served up by Rosanna Arquette and is a ridiculously piss-poor attempt at revealing ""ageism"" or ""sexism"" or something-ism coming out of modern Hollywood.

First, Arquette needs to go to film school. She was in way over her head with this ""project.""  Her ego and obvious lack of interviewing skills made some scenes difficult to watch.

Second, somebody needs to tell Arquette that nepotism is NEVER a good idea. Loading up your film crew to attend a Cannes film festival showing of your sister's ""work"" is low-brow and insulting to the viewer. Discussing how ""proud"" your parents would be of you and your sister is not germane to the subject matter and more than a little patronizing to the audience. Christ on a crutch, Arquette, sentimentalizing your own life in the context of a documentary film discussing ageism in Hollywood is completely inappropriate and unprofessional.

The best scenes in the film were with Jane Fonda. A more appropriate title for this film would have been ""Getting Some Good Insights from Jane Fonda."" Fonda's discussion of those rare moments during filming when an actor becomes one with the set, the other actors, the director, their inner and outer creative forces -- that few minutes of discussion were the highlight of the whole film. Fonda discussing intimacy - also somewhat interesting, especially coming from someone whose been in the business as long as she has, hearing about her sacrifices and what it meant to her - that was pretty good stuff.

Winger contributed very little to the film. And most of the film was just an ego-driven cacophony of dye-blonde botoxed-up middle-aged mediocre actresses discussing how to deal with their kids and families. (Are we really supposed to take Kelly Lynch and Daryl Hannah seriously? Has anyone ever taken these babes seriously? Really, Hannah was great as Kennedy Jr.'s girlfriend---but as a serious actress? Please.) McDormand didn't seem like she took any of it seriously. Rampling seemed bored or uninterested, or maybe there was a little prima donna stuff going on with her - she seemed detached from the process.

You have to wonder what the reactions of these actresses were when they were approached by Arquette to participate in the project. Redgrave? Jane Fonda?  Charlotte Rampling? These are heavyweights in the business, people, and Rosanna Arquette is...who? It seems entirely reasonable that some of the other heavies, like Streep, Sarandon, and Jodie Foster would have turned her down after laughing uproariously over the concept. Or maybe they were just busy working, something that would leave Arquette wondering why she would be making a film about women of a certain age being unable to get work  in Hollywood.

For documentaries, stick with Michael Moore.  Arquette hasn't got any chops and, at least at this time, seems ill-equipped to handle the challenges of any substantive issue in a documentary film.",1136592000,7,2985,5.085889570552148
1979856,3,B000190776,"When actress Rosanna Arquette (PULP FICTION, HOPE FLOATS, THE WHOLE NINE YARDS) began wondering why Debra Winger walked away from her acting career, she also began to ponder the bigger issue of the pressures faced by women working in show business. The result is the interesting documentary SEARCHING FOR DEBRA WINGER, in which the indefatigable Arquette sits down with a number of her friends and role models (including Diane Lane, Salma Hayek, Melanie Griffith, Holly Hunter, Frances McDormand, Gwyneth Paltrow, Sharon Stone, Jane Fonda, and Arquette's sister Patricia) to discuss such topics as career vs. motherhood, the industry's dismissal of older actresses, and the shortage of good roles for women in general.

While hardly in the same league as documentaries like BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE and CAPTURING THE FRIEDMANS, SEARCHING FOR DEBRA WINGER does raise a number of trenchant issues through a series of lively conversations orchestrated by Arquette. And if there are no immediate answers to the valid questions raised (why, for instance, isn't the industry comfortable with older women-younger men relationships when several fossilized actors have made it a habit of appearing opposite women young enough to be their great-grandchildren?), it's still a thought-provoking journey that should hold your interest throughout.",1133049600,3,1330,5.584158415841584
1979876,2,B000190776,"The film is a parade self-absorbed, shallow actresses who are out of touch with any semblance of reality attempting to sound profound.  With this group even the most mundane issues require endless hyperbole with words like ""passion"", ""empowerment"", ""struggle"", ""the craft"", ""dignity"", etc.  It's occupational existentialism for the vacuous.

It's interesting if you want to see a first person confirmation of Hollywood stereotypes.",1123459200,10,431,5.809523809523809

1979878,4,B000190776,"Actress Rosanna Arquette takes on the film industry and its perceptions and expectations of ""older"" (late 30s, early 40s+) actresses, filmed in a documentary style in various interviews with actresses who are ultimately the subject of the film. (The title of the film refers to Debra Winger, of course, who basically retired from the film industry amidst being branded ""difficult to work with"" as well as a dearth of good scripts available for women, particularly as they age.) Arquette talks to a number of actresses about their struggles in the industry, culminating in an interview with Winger herself. The film gives an inside view of an interesting and untapped subject matter in which all the actresses have complaints and thoughts to share, but none are more interesting, pointed or intelligent than Winger's-her reputation for ""difficulty"" might well stem from her brutal honesty and insistence on telling things as they are. She refuses to sugarcoat anything or dumb herself down to appease others or to fit into a mold of what's expected, which is apparently what working in Hollywood means.",1109721600,8,1101,5.156424581005586
1979879,2,B000190776,"Ive wanted to watch this for a couple of years now and finally got around to it. I thought with all of the high profile actresses in it they would have something to say or it would be good. But I was left being very dissapointed.

Roseanna Arquette says she is on the search for Debra Winger, why did she leave the business? But it quickly turns into a film about Hollywood mom's. How they balance doing films with children. Usually it seems they move down to one movie a year. How does them working effect their children and their personal lives? Can they have it all? How can they do it???

I was dissapointed that really none of these women had much of anything interesting to say. Whoopi Goldberg is the highlight of the movie since she was able to make me laugh. Really what it came down to was ""it's hard and it's a struggle"". Well that's what everyone faces everywhere while raising families. There are some scenes that I found really interesting though. The one with Martha Plimpton and Ali Sheedy. Both 80's staples and now rarely seen. The both seemed very angry and bitter not at ageing or trying to ""have it all"" but from being typecast or not getting work. And the interview of Gwyneth Paltrow where she discusses her parents saving her from doing teen movies or sexually themed comedies and how it helped her career not to do a lot of sexual roles. Im not a prude but there was some pretty sexy stuff in ""Shakespear in Love"". I guess for her being naked and simulating sex is more ""artistic"" if the jokes are witty and high brow.

When Debra Winger is ""found"" its a let down. Roseanna seems to not understand that there is a life outside of Hollywood and its ok to leave fame.

None of the actresses (except for Martha Plimpton and Ali Sheedy) really seemed to be complaining about anything except how sexist Hollywood is. While Roseanna seems to be upset that she doesnt get work anymore.

What could have been a really great discussion about ageism in Hollywood or better yet (what should have been the real reason) why Debra Winger decided to leave the industry to have a real life turned into a pointless movie with unanswered questions and an annoying Arquette.

Your not really missing anything by NOT watching this movie. If you want to watch it to see how Arquette sucks up to other actresses then I guesse it would be good for that.",1104710400,11,2355,4.477855477855478
1979880,1,B000190776,"I was hoping that Arquette, with so many talented women before her camera, would deliver fresh insights into the very real problem of sexism in movies. Instead, the inarticulate Arquette leads us through a meandering flattery fest (""you're, like, so amazing""), constantly emphasizing appearance by telling the actresses how good they look, as if her point is that actresses over 40 should be cast in movies not because they're talented, but because they still look sexy.",1104451200,27,470,5.197368421052632
1979881,2,B000190776,"Debra Winger left the Hollywood scene back in 1995, after receiving three Oscar nominations and only in her early thirties.  This is nearly unheard of in Hollywood as budding actresses remain in the spotlight, perhaps not always making the best film choices.  Rosanna wants to find an answer to the question as to why Winger left the glamour of Hollywood.  She was a powerhouse in Hollywood, and just suddenly left the scene.  Why?  This should have been the focus of the documentary, but instead what happens is that we end up with several interviews with Hollywood heavyweights as they talk about the trials and tribulations of what it is like to be a mother, actress, and a multi-millionaire all at the same time.  We hear words from the likes of Meg Ryan, Whoopi Goldberg, Melanie Griffith, Daryl Hannah, Salma Hayek, Holly Hunter, Diane Lane, Samantha Mathis, Frances McDormand, Gwyneth Paltrow, Martha Plimpton, Sharon Stone, Tracey Ullman, and Robin Wright Penn.

Throughout the film, these women guide us through a very chauvinistic Hollywood.  We learn that Hollywood is not the place for an aging woman with desires to have a family.  Continually torn between two classic Hollywood roles, the girlfriend or the old maid mother, these woman ravishly fight over anything fresh and new that comes to the table.  The constantly endure the painful eye of the producer and director that grade them on the size of their breasts instead of the knowledge of their mind.  Proving that a glass ceiling does exist, even in the most magical of places, just like in the real world.  As these women talk and discuss life, we are continually getting closer and closer to our ""hero"" of the story, Debra Winger.

Overall, the fact that we ""found"" Winger within the first hour was the biggest let down of the film.  On the other end of the spectrum, the high point is when Arquette comes clean and actually says that she has made some films ""just to pay the bills"".  Always good to hear that the leader of this documentary possibly could be making this very film just to ""pay the bills"".  I lost a lot of credibility to Rosanna after she said this.  The better title for this film should have been, Searching for Jane Fonda.  The fact that she is in this movie longer than Debra Winger only proves that Rosanna had no clue what she was doing.  She led us on a very curvy road with several bumps that eventually placed us in the middle of nowhere.  There was no direction and no point behind this movie.  Within the first twenty minutes I was tired of the only words coming out of Rosanna's mouth being, ""You were brilliant"" or ""You look amazing"".  She, perhaps not consciously, contributes to this stigma surrounding the women of Hollywood.  Her filler spots where she talks to her child and travels the world seemed forced and unoriginal.  The only point that this film proved was that Rosanna Arquette knows some very famous people in Hollywood, and have ultimately done much better than her.  This was one of those films that high school nerds would make with aspiration to show women how popular they were.  Arquette basically uses this documentary to boost herself up on a pedestal that she does not deserve to be anywhere near.  Avoid this film at all costs, especially if you are a woman interested in the Hollywood scene.  Searching for Debra Winger will only prove that documentaries can be scripted.

1979882,2,B000190776,"This is a pretentious, hackneyed look at the meaning of life and relationships as told by a few Hollywood actresses. Firstly, it's hard to garner a great deal of sympathy for the woes and troubles of some wealthy film stars. Secondly, Patricia Arquette, the director of the documentary, makes it seem as though these actresses are full of insight and wisdom when they are really saying things that we've heard over and over again.

Stay away from this one. There's nothing really creative or original about it.",1091404800,9,510,4.862068965517241
1979883,3,B000190776,"Many of the comments in this movie resonated with me, a working mother in my mid-40s.  This is something between a home movie and documentary, very personal and informal.  The comments that inspired me didn't relate to working women's struggles, but gave a glimpse at the human condition. Laura Dern said: 'We're all asking the same questions. How do we feel safe, how do we keep our hearts open when there's so much fear?'  A few of the women surprised me with their intelligence.  Curious that we don't see this kind of introspection in professions dominated by men, or will we?  Ten years from now, should we watch for Searching for Ricky Williams?

1979884,3,B000190776,"I salute Ms. Arquette for doing something original: piercing the facade of the successful actress stereotype and inducing a plethora of fascinating and accomplished women to speak openly about their life experiences.  The film works well at a number of levels -- personally I am not AS interested in acting per se as I am in creativity in general, and there was ample interesting material on what it means to be creative, and on the tension between pursuing one's creativity and achieving balance in one's life.  Beyond the creativity issue, there is the equally interesting question of how one should approach aging and what growing older means; it was an inspiration and a pleasure seeing so many women who are past their Hollywood ""primes"" talking about the pressures, but also the rewards, of aging.  I suspect there are not many men who would enjoy this film, which is a shame because men face these issues too.  But this film is a gold mine of material for women, and particularly female artists working in any medium.  I also enjoyed the soundtrack.  I only gave three stars because, notwithstanding the good concept and the excellent quality of some of the interviews, the film shifted focus a lot: one second we're hearing about how Hollywood only cares about sex appeal, the next we're hearing how hard it is for an actress to raise kids, the next we're hearing about the challenges of nurturing both an intimate relationship and a career, the next we're hearing about what it means to be an aging actress.  And, actually, the nominal subject of the film, Debra Winger, raises a whole separate issue, which is why we even need the outward trappings of success to be ""successful"" in our lives and creative pursuits.  Also, the camera work was pretty basic, and the editing of the piece as a ""documentary"" could have been much more imaginative.  Other than using the scenes from ""The Red Shoes,"" which was inspired, the film was almost nothing but talking heads.  A few family photos would have been refreshing, for instance, when Ms. Arquette talked about her mother raising five creative kids and stifling her own creativity.  Or some scenes from films in which some of the interviewees had starred. Or any little detail to enrich the film's texture.  Although the comparison may be unfair, Michael Moore understands how to make a documentary visually riveting; just because a film is a ""documentary"" doesn't mean it should ignore the pursuit of ""movie magic.""",1089676800,3,2470,4.882775119617225
1979885,3,B000190776,"THE FILM starts with Rosanna Arquette questioning herself: ""Cannot actresses balance between work and family?  Especially after reaching 40?""  Well, she says not exactly, but to the effect, and makes her intention very clear with a footage from Michael Powell film ""The Red Shoes"" (1948).  The point is clear, and interesting if you watch the heroine's fate.
SO ROSANNA STARTs her journey, holding a hand-held camera, interviewing as many actresses as possible.  Some of the interviewees are her good friends while some are probably encountered at the film festival in Cannes, and agreed to say a thing or two.  The film comprises these footages until Rosanna goes to Debra Winger, who Rosanna says, retired from the profession.  (But I am afraid that not all people share Rosanna's view that she actually 'retired.')
Now, let's face it.  AS A DOCUMENTARY, ""Searching for Debra Winger"" is a big failure, being too disjointed and having no focus.  After all, there are so many actresses out there now, and many opinions too, especially those about their professions, this case acting.  It's diversity, which should be treated more carefully.
THE INTERVIEWEES include Patricia Arquette, Emmanuelle Beart, Katrin Cartlidge, Laura Dern, Jane Fonda, Teri Garr, Whoopi Goldberg,  Melanie Griffith, Daryl Hannah, Salma Hayek, Holly Hunter, Dinae Lane, Kelly Lynch, Julianna Margulles, Chiara Mastroianni, Samantha Mathis, Frances McDormand, Catherine O'Hara, Julia Ormond, Gwyneth Paltrow, Martha Plimpton, Charlotte Rampling, Vanessa Redgrave, Theressa Russell, Meg Ryan, Ally Sheedy, Hilary Shephard-Turner, Sharon Stone, Tracy Ullman, JoBeth Williams, Debra Winger, Alfre Woodard, and Robin Wright Penn.  I don't know why, but Roger Ebert pops up, saying very unique things about one Angelina Jolie film.  (Come on, Roger, you must be kidding, right?)
SOME OF THE INTERVIEWEES are very inspired, giving us insights into the business with humor and charms.  You see Frances  McDormand, and you understand her good-natured personality instantly.  Or look at Charlotte Rampling (who appears with Katrin Cartlidge), and how she dresses herself.  She is gorgeous, as seen in ""Under the Sand"" and her fashion sense!  And we miss late Katrin Cartlidge, who shows her amiable down-to-earth personality.  What is regrettable is that the time alloted to them (or some others) are too short.  Why did they decide to include Roger Ebert?
And if you say that actress's job gets harder after 40 (and I do not disagree), OK, where are those people?  I mean, Streep, Weaver, Keaton, Close, Sarandon, and so on and on?  On the UK side, how about Denti or Mirren?  Or another Redgrave?  On French side, how about Moreau or Deneuve?  Rosanna must have approached to them, and if they declined interview, why did they?  Because they think differently?  Or just too busy?  But if busy, Rossana's argument (about the profession) is no longer valid.  I kept on thinking about it, and the idea certainly weakens the impact of the film's contents.
You might, moreover, still hate some of the interviewees, who give too strong opinions.  SOme of them are not convincing, and some are downright irritating.  At least Rosanna Arquette should be prasied for inducing them to be honest, and whether you like it or not, what they say before the camera is never boring.
The film is interesting to see regardless of the director's intentions, which gets blurred as the film goes on.  Too many talks are gathered to support one coherent idea, but the interviews themselves are always fascinating.",1088899200,7,3558,5.222222222222222

8008281,1,B000190776,"really disappointing. lot's of great issues to talk about, just wasted... the interviews- the questions and the answers (at least most of the ones they show) are just not profound, intelligent, articulated, etc.
exception: the answers of debra winger (which i guess proves the point of the movie, too smart for the movie business).
also interesting is the way actresses reveal the charade of their well being---- i'm at peace, better than ever, except when i don't get out of bed all day.. :/",1414540800,,492,4.869047619047619
8008282,4,B000190776,"I enjoyed this documentary by Rosanna Arquette in many ways.  It's not about Debra Winger; rather, it poses the question: ""Where do actresses go after they turn 40?""  Rosanna (to distinguish her from her sister) honestly reveals herself, with no attempt to disguise why she asks the question. Many of the actresses whom she interviews are her friends, and it seems that she tries to be considerate by not spending too much time on camera setups, etc. Among her subjects, Whoopi Goldberg was very earthy, and more or less answered, ""I don't know why the hell people ever wanted me in movies, anyway"" - as she confirmed just why we all love her. Adrienne Shelly, whom I didn't know before, was provocative and seemed to have a beef. That intrigued me, so I found her solution: she wrote her own film, ""Waitress"" and starred in it, together with Keri Russell and Cheryl Hines, whose ensemble work was topped only by The Supremes at their best. Then I learned of her tragic murder shortly after the film was completed. Jane Fonda sounded as if she had scripted and rehearsed her interview.  Rosanna seemed honestly jealous, though supportive when interviewing her active sister Patricia. It was funny to see Katrin Cartlidge pop up in the interview of Charlotte Rampling - Rosanna didn't seem to know her.  Neither did I, but I found her interesting and checked out her films.  It was interesting to hear from the very talented and intelligent JoBeth Williams - partly since I once sat on the steps shyly while we were both waiting to audition for a school play.  Finally, the interview with Debra Winger is charmingly quirky - more than she appeared on screen. I read that she was difficult to work with, and suppose that she poses a challenge to directors that might be welcome: how to deal with talent that wants to go its own way, without diluting it when you try to harmonize it with your concept? It didn't sound like Ms Winger was really satisfied with her retirement, and she's back now. If I were to design a film such as this, I would explore the other side of the question: ""How do starring actresses manage to maintain their careers into maturity?"" Catherine Deneuve is an example, and made the tradition to supporting roles in ""Indochine"" on the director's invitation, and in ""Dancer in the Dark,"" which she did because she wanted to work with Lars von Trier [see her ""Close Up and Personal."" Streep managed to get mature roles and is still working. There is clearly room for a follow-up to Rosanna Arquette's interesting and personal documentary.  She has been criticized already for filming technique that might be a bit below professional standards, but I'll ascribe that to her consideration for her interesting friends who agreed to be interviewed.",1390176000,3,2762,4.777777777777778

Some people work because they have to, not choose to. Try talking to women outside your profession. Some who don't shop on Rodeo Drive.",1370736000,,349,4.453125
8008284,1,B000190776,"Full disclosure:  I did not watch the whole movie.  I can't imagine who could have done so.  I thought I might be watching a movie that told me a little about Debra Winger, an actress who actually had some chops back when movies weren't completely dreadful.

Instead, this piece of fluff comes to us from Roseanna Arquette, whose chief claim to fame is being the muse behind a tawdry rock anthem, and whose oeuvre is largely devoid of anything more watchable than her little 80s miniskirt in ""Desperately Seeking Susan.""  Although she might have gotten around to something moderately interesting eventually (happy to say I didn't stick around long enough to know), she opened the film by revealing with great pathos the gut-wrenching decisions behind honoring her ""art"" at the expense of being a ""normal"" wife and mother.  This was echoed by great thespians like Sharon Stone, talking bitterly about how they had to manage similar choices.  Or Robin Wright Penn sharing that, only by having the safety of her loving marriage could she take the huge emotional risks that were necessary for her Artistic Vision.  Or the has-been Whoopi Goldberg griping about the difficulties of success.  Presumably, they were all at some point going to discuss how lamentable it is that women of a ""certain age"" suddenly don't get as much work.

Here's a news flash, Roseanna and company:  Everybody alive must make the same choices every day.  There are cab drivers whose sight fails and who can no longer drive, longshoremen who develop back pain and can't lift, women who quit careers to home-school children, and countless individuals who are just less marketable when enter their 50s and 60s and must compete with younger entrants in the job market.  The chief difference between you and the rest of us is that we don't make a seven- or eight-digit paycheck from six months of glamorous work during the good years.  And nobody really makes movies about us.  Are we supposed to be reassured that problems can tarnish the most golden of lives?  Comforted that you're ""just like us little people"" with our cares and worries?  How stupid.  How crass.

I find this movie execrable.

I pretty much stopped watching current Hollywood offerings about 10 years ago.  This movie has thoroughly validated my entertainment choices.",1362009600,8,2307,4.94025974025974
8008285,5,B000190776,"Two things about this review: I quibble with none of the criticisms I'm reading here. As a film, a documentary, it's deeply flawed. But where Arquette succeeds is in getting 35 sensitive, articulate, introspective women to talk and think and report about issues that matter so very much to women in Western culture. And that makes this film well worth watching and discussing.

Consider who we're hearing from. Featured are many of the actresses whose experiences and performances have recently shaped how our culture experiences and values women - how it celebrates them (physicality, vulnerability, grace, sacrifice) - and how it devalues and limits them. Acting requires the ability to express, distill and represent, so what is captured (yes, inexpertly!) is filled with emotional depth, truth, and insight.

I don't need this film to be a perfect example of filmmaking or editing. In fact, its flaws are deeply interesting and relevant to the study. It's interesting to hear the actresses greet one another with validation on how they look, especially older actresses.

I've watched the film several times, taking away new insights each time. Some of the issues it helps me explore:

* Motherhood and guilt
* The dynamic, fruitful elationship between vulnerability and creativity
* Importance of sexual attractiveness and where women can find their value as they age
* Power structure of Hollywood film industry (with great relevance to the larger business culture I inhabit)
* Changes I see from the film's date - how much has changed in the nearly 10 years since these conversations took place

If you're the type of critic for whom seeing the boom microphone dip into the shot, or the interviewer interrupting her subject are errors that make you unable to continue watching, then this will be a short, agonizing viewing you'd best avoid. But if you're like me, someone who can look past that and focus on what's being said, how it's being expressed, and enjoy thinking about why even the flaws are there - give it a try.",1361923200,7,2029,4.991124260355029
