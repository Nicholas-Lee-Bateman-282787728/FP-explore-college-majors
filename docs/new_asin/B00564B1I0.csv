8459205,5,B00564B1I0,"Fascinating epic films, about 20th Century Russian history.",1407974400,,59,6.5
8459206,2,B00564B1I0,"Sequels can be a disappointment. These are after the high bar set by the original. Some great actors are in it Nikita Mikhalkov, Oleg Menshikov, Yevgeny Mironov. The movie tries to move on after the 1st and change the ending of the original which was a bit of a stretch in the way they did. It does it's best to portray the struggle and hardships of WWII.",1387929600,,355,4.313432835820896
8459207,5,B00564B1I0,"A very good insight in the harsh years under Stalin, an excellent view on how people tried to live and how some of them managed to survive. Don't forget that many millions of russian soldiers and citizens did not survive WWII. The movie shows the violence in its pure and inhuman way, for some people it might be too much and too cruel. But the reality of war is and will be cruel. In some way it is an anti-war statement. Nikita Mikhalkov acts his role brilliantly.",1386979200,,466,4.367816091954023

8459209,3,B00564B1I0,"Burnt by the Sun 1 is a great film, one of the greatest. Therefore, expectations were high for BBS 2 (part 1 and 2). However, I was disappointed. It is well worth seeing, but not at all the same class as the first movie.",1358553600,,220,4.0227272727272725
