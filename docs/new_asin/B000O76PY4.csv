If you have had a hard day, then sit back and watch this tale of life at a small airline and the antics of most of the crew. I first watched this on BBC America years ago and it is still worth looking at. And I still fancy Janice. Of course she has not aged one day and I have, but such is life. Just sit back and enjoy.",1392940800,,400,3.7176470588235295

8183473,5,B000O76PY4,"Mile High was aired by BBC and was a great hit among viewers. Make sure to buy Season One. Season Two includes Part One and Part Two. This story revolves around a British Budget airline, called Fresh Air. And yes, there are members of the Mile High Club. If you liked the series Pan Am , you will love Mile High. Humorous and delighful. You will laugh constantly. The story focuses on the lives and loves of the cabin crew and cockpit traveling all over Europe. Not a dull moment. As an ex-international flight attendant. I loved every moment.",1353801600,,543,4.494949494949495

8183476,5,B000O76PY4,"This review pertains to both Season 1 and Season 2 of Mile High.

This is really a fun, entertaining, and sexy British show.

Ever wondered what it is like to be a flight or cabin crew of an airline? This sexy series will show you a lifestyle you thought possible only in real life (or is it the other way around?). This series is really realistic, and I can testify to this!

Infidelity, sex, friendship, revenge, nudity (lots and lots), emergencies, death...are just a few of the action awaiting you as you travel with the crew of Fresh Airline to sexy European destinations (and in Season 2, you'll travel to International destinations such as Toronto and Bahrain).

The characters are very well thought off and convincing. Throughout the series you will have a love/hate relationship with them, and this is what makes the characters so believable. At the end of the series you will really miss the characters--they really do grow on you. And they might learn a thing or two from you--or is it the other way around?

Do all airline captains cheat on their wives, and do they become less likable by the viewer when they do? You might just be surprised, or rather be surprised at yourself. The sins of one are also the sins of others, whatever this means.

Do all captains keep a girlfriend at each port of call? And how about the copilots and the cabin crew, are they as promiscuous as the captain? Why is there always a gay cabin crew (who by the way is one of the funniest characters)?

Ever heard of a nudist flight (i.e. flight with nude passengers)? Do you think the flight crew fly their aircraft while nude too? Watch the series and find out for yourself!

What does friendship mean when you are a mile and more above the earth in an aircraft? Does your job come first or your friends?

Is it OK to cheat your airline, and how far will one go to do so? Will you go out with your ex-girlfriend's best friend (that is, after cheating your airline)?

Have you taken a flight lately? You might just decide to take one after this series. In fact, this series might be a great motivator for couch potatoes to go fly to a sexy destination! You will never fly the same way again! And who knows, you might not come back.

For those wandering about the series title, the Mile High Club is an exclusive, non-enforced, free (meaning you don't have to pay to join), members only club for those who have had sex in an airplane that's flying at least one mile above the ground--and no, no one has to be present to testify to your act or sign a membership card. A person's--or rather the persons' (for at least two should be involved) word suffices to join this exclusive club. When did you say you were last on an airplane?

I really recommend this series for mature adults (or 18+ immature adults as well). It is a lot of fun. Be aware though that this series contains a lot of sexual scenes (gay, straight, and curved) as well as gratuitous nudity. Be aware too that you might just get the flying bug and end up either going to flight school or applying for a position as a cabin crew. Or you might end up as a sex mechanic (did I mean maniac?), but let's hope that won't be the case.

I think I'll change my career in the world of my mind. The world miles above the earth is quite sexy...and predictable--sort off! And safe as long as it remains in the theatre of my mind.

P.S. I usually don't write this way, so blame this series--it is the cause of the state of mind I'm presently in! If you wanna (meaning want to) join me, watch the series!",1189468800,2,3542,4.379573170731708
