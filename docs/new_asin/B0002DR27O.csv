that tell the whole story even though it's about one family's
struggles thru WWII! John Shea and the other actor who plays
his brother are great in their roles as one brother is against
the war but gets thrown into and the other take a job with the
Gestapo thinking it would be easier on him but finds out later
otherwise! the best part is Tony Randall [Felix on the odd couple]
plays a gay cabaret performer! awesome! the ending is brutal and
shocking. Amazing at one time they could make tv movies this good!",1318204800,,575,4.333333333333333
8026821,3,B0002DR27O,"Not surprisingly--it's all very understated. Actually--seeing this on TMC I was amazed how visually sophisticated this made for TV production looked. Very nice atmosphere and compositions (mise-en-scene!!!!). Not mounted as an adventure or for tension, but engaging nonetheless.

John Shea is more than watchable. The same cannot be said of the transfer--which looks like a VHS copy projected through wax paper.

Caveat Emptor!",1293494400,,427,5.761904761904762
8026822,4,B0002DR27O,"a good movie, starts out slow and the video quality isn't the best for its time.  great for learning about the SS and its involvement during the WWII. its not a action war movie, but rather drama and a bit romance.  great for anybody that likes Nazi history",1285200000,,257,4.333333333333333
