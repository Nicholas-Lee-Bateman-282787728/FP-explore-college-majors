8231769,3,6304774338,"This is parts 3 and 4 of a four episode show off of the final fantasy game of the same name.  The show isn't based on the game, but they have the same setting.

I watched this with part one.  I don't think it would be so easy to follow without having seen part 1.  This begins with the main character Linally having merged with the wind crystal.  It went in through her chest, but manifests its guidance by making her [...] cheeks glow when it wants to show the adventurers something.  (She wears a shirt and panties but no pants.)  Somehow that says a lot about this show.  There isn't really a cue to the audience that this is because of the embedded crystal, so not having seen part one could make this confusing.

I preferred part one to this video, mostly because here there long tedious fight scenes.  One of the better features of these is that there is a longish sequence with totally inappropriate music.  The music is happy and jazzish and would better accompany something having to do with a chokobo than with a going to the moon to fight the death god scene.  There is comic relief here, but it seems forced.  The best part of the video is seeing the setting from the video games drawn out and little details added.

Overall I don't recommend this movie.  It's not so terrible, but it isn't wonderful either.  Also because you only get two 30 minute episodes you don't get much video.",1165708800,,1396,4.39453125
