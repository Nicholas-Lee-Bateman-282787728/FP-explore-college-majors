It's a great series with Sergio Leone touches, broad comedy including slapstick, deadpan, characters and class war satire. I wonder whether its interest in language was influenced by Deadwood. Li Daegil deserves to be a classic character and his portrayal by Jang Hyuk is brilliant and energetic. Supporting actors and direction are clear and imaginative. I want it in US version and will purchase it when it becomes available.",1283558400,5,532,4.857142857142857

8405382,5,B003TPQD9K,"Chuno is one of the best historical dramas ever for all the reasons mentioned by the excellent reviews, along with The Queen Seon Deok and The Kingdom of the Wind. The title of my review reflects the thought, a universal truth, expressed by the lead actress Lee Da Hae when she was talking with Oh Ji Ho (the rebel general), well into the latter half of the series. They were running away from their pursuers Jang Hyuk (the slave hunter) and Lee Jong Hyuk (the top marshal assigned to eradicate the rebellion, a.k.a the ""bad guy"" of the movie). As the days went by and the goal became less clearer, the good general became less confident of his plan to change the ruling class and bring some measure of social justice to the Joseon dynasty. During their journey in one occasion, the good general was expressing his frustration about the goal being too uncertain and not seeing the end of the road, and because of this she should reconsider following him, to which Lee Da Hae said that what is important to her, paraphrasing, ""is not where she is going but with whom."" I bring this up because it helped me understand the way Chuno ended, which was perfect, brilliant, with a subtle touch of film making at its best!!!  As some people expressed, the ending may have been a bit anti-climatic as the intensity was building up. But if you remember this thought when you finish watching the series it will all make sense.  Or if you already liked the ending it will give you a new meaningful perspective. As in real life, what is important is the ""journey"" and not so much the end of the road because one can waste their life and get stuck by focusing too much on how difficult the journey is, or how uncertain or changing the goals are.  No matter how much effort you put in life to achieve or get what you want, sometimes it is just impossible, otherwise you would be god and not a human being (Jang Hyuk trying to reunite with Lee Da Hae) (Oh Ji Ho trying to achieve his dream of a more just society) (the slaves trying to win their rebellion).  Whether you reach the goal or not is not that important but rather enjoying the present, every moment of the journey, with the people you care, and no matter what you do.  Now back to the movie, I liked very much the performances by Lee Da Hae and Oh Ji Ho, their chemistry, and how subtle and intense their attraction to each other was. Their subdued interactions represented the best scenes of cinematic romance in a long time.  Lee Da Hae is one of my favorite actresses along with Lee Na Young (Runaway Plan B). After watching Chuno please watch Runaway Plan B, which has a similar theme of characters being on the run but in modern times with conspiracies and twists galore, and is completely different and much better than IRIS.  Last but not least, the soundtrack is one of the best along with the OST of Runaway Plan B, and this is not a surprise as the production team of writer/director is the same for both of them.  I got the CDs from amazon and they are worth the price because not only of the superb music but also for the great art work and lyrics in the inserts, better than downloading the tracks.",1367020800,,3157,4.412371134020619
8405383,5,B003TPQD9K,"Excellent series, excellent subtitles! The cinematography is breathtaking and action sequences are brilliantly choreographed and executed. An excellent gift for both the veteran KDrama lover and the beginner who keeps asking what the big deal is about this dangerously addictive form of entertainment! NB: This particular set is a Region 3 DVD so you will have to either buy a multiregion player or set your laptop DVD player to region 3.",1359936000,2,438,5.183098591549296
8405384,5,B003TPQD9K,"I stumbled across this drama through Netflix and I was automatically hooked.  Everything from the scenery to the actual acting was just amazing.  Very convincing with the acting.  Story line was very well written and at many times had me at the edge of my seat trying to predict the next scene.  From slaves to nobles, you couldn't help but feel what each class was going through.  I love how everyone is intertwined with each other and how they all have a piece of the entire story.  Some actors you couldn't help but relate to and the humor was also great.  Love, conspiracy, lies, hate, compassion, forgiveness, loyalty, humor, action, yelling, crying, laughing...and stamina, haha...these guys walked and ran everywhere, sometimes on horses but boy did they travel days on the path.  Bottom line, it was an awesome epic series and I wish there was another season because I miss the dialogue between these characters.",1358467200,2,920,4.890322580645162
8405385,5,B003TPQD9K,"Another Korean TV drama masterpiece!  Excellent all round.  As good as, and competing with Chinese productions.
The quality of writing is excellent.  Great music.  Korean karate is as good as Chinese kung fu.

8405386,5,B003TPQD9K,"I loved this series!  I looked forward to, and watched all episodes within a week - week and a half (embarrassed to say).  I wish it continued.  Unlike many American shows - there was a finality to the end of the series.. no continuing - so I can't look forward to future shows.  I wish it was new to me again, so I could watch it new.. have fun - enjoy.",1357084800,2,354,3.943661971830986
8405387,5,B003TPQD9K,"Chuno (The Slave Hunters) masterfully blends elements of The Good The Bad and The Ugly, The Seven Samurai, Romeo and Juliet, Robin Hood, and A Game of Thrones; and raises the bar for Epic Dramas.

Setting:
Chuno is a 24 episode drama set during Korea's Joseon Dynasty (16th Century).  After Korea lost the war to China, the country was in ruins.  50% of the population was enslaved.  When slaves escaped, Chuno (Slave Hunters) were hired to return them to their masters for severe punishments.

Story:
The story revolves around a band of slave hunters lead by Lee Dae Gil, a hunter with a brutal reputation.  For the last 10 years, Lee has carried a portrait of a beautiful girl with him where ever he goes, asking everyone if they have seen her and promising them great rewards if they can give him any information.  It is soon revealed that Lee was once an aristocrat from a wealthy family who fell in love with a slave named Un Nyun.  Because they were from different classes, their relationship was forbidden and they were both severely punished.  During a slave rebellion, Lee lost everything and turned to the streets to survive.  Now Lee's face is badly scarred and he has the grim countenance of a starving wolf.  After 10 years, he still searches for the woman that he loves and her brother who led the rebellion.  The Slave Hunters become entangled in a major political conspiracy when they are hired to track down an escaped military criminal.

Awards:
Won Best Actor Jang Hyuk as Lee Dae Gil
Won Best Actor Oh Ji Ho as Song Tae Ha
Won Best Supporting Actor Sung Dong as Chun Ji Ho (The guy with the evil laugh)
Won Best Couple (Lee Dae Gil and Unnyeon)
Won Best Script
Nominated for Best Drama but lost to IRIS.

Characters:
As you can tell by the awards, the acting is superb.  Jang Hyuk (Lee Dae Gil) is like a Korean Toshiro Mifune.
Lee Dae Gil is the leader of the slave hunters.
Song Tae Ha is the escaped military criminal.
Hye Won (Un Nyun) is Lee's long lost love.
The story also features corrupt politicians, assassins, mercenaries, soldiers, rival factions, street gangs, merchants, heirs to the throne, spies, scholars...

Action:
Chuno has outstanding action sequences similar to the Movie 300.  There are brawls, wars, skirmishes, musket snipers, sword fights, spear fights, archers...

Soundtrack:
The soundtrack is a fusion of modern music blended with epic period music.  Personally, I hate lyrics in background music, but for some reason Chuno pulls it off beautifully.  The best example is a track called 'Gloomy 30's'.  You can find it on youtube or itunes.  I put the link in the comment section below.

Maturity:  Teens
This was a TV show.  There's violence with some blood although I wouldn't call it gory like Spartacus.  There's NO nudity like A Game of Thrones or Spartacus.

Overall:
This is a MUST SEE if you are an EPIC COMPLETIONIST.  If you like A Game of Thrones, 300, The Good the Bad and the Ugly, The Seven Samurai... then this needs to go on your list.  I've known people who cried because some scenes were so sad, some scenes were so funny, and some scenes were so beautiful.  I watched the entire series twice already.  It's amazing!

People who may not like this:
If your epic period pieces need to be historically accurate, then the music, dynamic fight scenes, or makeup on the women may bother you.

Chuno is available right now on Hulu.com, but the subtitles are sub par.  The acting is so good, you don't even need them.  I've included two (fairly spoiler free) trailers in the Comment Section Below.

Enjoy!",1309737600,8,3563,4.662921348314606
8405388,5,B003TPQD9K,"This is the best Korean TV series EVER.  Amazing cast, amazing story.  Leaves you wanting more.  On Hulu for free!",1301011200,,114,4.6
8405389,5,B003TPQD9K,"I purchased this dvd set through Amazon and have finished the set.
The cinematography is on par with other series.
The storyline, humor and action is real good.
Here's the shortcoming: The English subtitles start to degrade about half way through the set, making it hard (frustrating, if not difficult) to grasp what they're talking about as there's no correlation to the storyline as well as to previous subtitles (Tae Ha becomes Ti, DaeGil becomes Ji).
You would have to listen to who they're talking about to hear the name.
My advice to the publisher is to get a real good translator to do the translations, consistently.
Otherwise, it's a good series.",1291161600,6,655,4.857142857142857
