Ridiculous script, awful acting and cheesy choreography by a dancer who should have known better.

If you want to learn about Argentine tango, get ""Tango, our dance"" and ""Tango, the passion"", for movies start with ""Tango"" by Carlos Saura, ""Tango lesson"" and ""Tango bar"".",1239667200,4,293,4.745098039215686
