7886626,3,6305272069,"At least that's how I heard someone refer to her once, and that seems pretty accurate, although I am pretty sure Ms. Herrera's breasts are not surgically augmented.

This is a pretty cheesy Western spoof, although it's pretty well-made, with bright, colorful cinematography and energetic performances from a cast of seasoned pros (Guzman, Ibanez, Cesar Bono). Lorena Herrera (oddly, third billed), as the title character, is not bad either, although I'm not sure that's actually her spinning the gun in the close-ups. Still, she is nice to look at, for sure.

Notice how on the cover she's holding what looks like a Walther PPK, as if this movie were a spy spoof instead of a Western spoof. Oh, well - you get the point.",1343088000,,720,4.798387096774194
