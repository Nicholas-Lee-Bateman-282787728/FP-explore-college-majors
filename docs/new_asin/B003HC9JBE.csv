8396994,5,B003HC9JBE,"I watched the videos ""Morning and Bedtime Stretches"" and ""Pilates on the Go"". Excellent! Very well done! Every move is well detailed and easy to understand, just the way I like it. I tried some of the stretches, but my back is still a little sore to do a lot. Small steps, just like you said in the video - this works for me!  I liked the relaxation chapter at the end of ""Morning and Bedtime Stretches"" - I really enjoyed that part and the way I felt after. I am so happy that you are a part of my life now through your DVDs and I can listen to you everyday while I practice and strenghten my back! Thanks so much for such great videos!",1311033600,5,637,4.055555555555555
8396995,5,B003HC9JBE,"My attention span isn't typically so great that I partake of stretching nearly as much  as I should.  It increases your fitness benefits, helps give you long lean muscles rather than looking bigger...I know, it's important. I just haven't been great at doing it.

So, because this was included in a set of workouts I got, I thought I may as well give it a go this week. Not so much for the benefits, but it's been a long, hard week, and I couldn't drag myself to workout and I felt it was the only way I'd not feel guilty considering I've put in little workout time lately.

It's not a fancy Hollywood DVD with background trainers, elevator music, etc. but, that winds up being a good thing... just like the preceding learning I'd gotten from the previous DVDs I got (she has a set), it was VERY good learning and very clear and ""warm"" instruction. That's what shines-- By that I mean she is an ideal instructor for such a DVD...soothing voice, calming. A good teacher. Even for a beginner. It feels like

This isn't a DVD that begins where you just follow along with the movements. It's put together as a tutorial first for you to understand the movements and how to do them properly. It takes me forever to memorize anything...if you are one who can, you might be able to get it down and do it on your own every night and morning..or, if you want to jump in and see the workout without this part, know that, after the in depth instruction, there is a condensed version you move to...this is where you go through the sequences without the training once you get that down.  It's a nice combo to have both rather than having to get the details every time when you've already learned the whys and hows the first few times (or if you are quick, the first time) you do the DVD.  When you do the condensed routine with the instructor that will gain benefits but just take around 10 minutes in your morning and then 10 for your evening stretches.

But here's the skinny...as it suggests, somehow these morning stretches chosen invigorate in the morning and your evening stretches relax in the evening.  It is like a natural cup of coffee to start my day but somehow my evening stretches do de-stress me at night. Lately, that's just all I can do. I let go of my ""to-do"" lists, and it helps center your body and mind and relax you while also adding muscular benefit. Afterwards, as promised, I do feel relaxed and sleep deeper. Now granted, I'm new at putting stretches into my routine, but  when I feel there are multiple benefits to a routine I do continue..

.It's a good compilation with stretches to get the blood pumping in the morning and stretches that calm all the excess energy at night. The cueing is easy to follow regardless of experience, the moves are explained in full, the details of why it's important to do moves correctly are fully taught..it's not just following moves on a screen. It allows you to pick it up, correctly, so it becomes a long-term routine. Then follow moves on the screen.

I haven't yet done the body stretches after a workout...that will be my next phase...I could see that being equally as effective with the benefits of flexibility.

Conclusion: These are gentle stretches for any age adult, easily explained, fully taught, with benefits that have kept me doing them in spite of a frenetic schedule that's taken away much of my motivation to workout lately...This is yoga in stretches.",1288742400,21,3420,4.541463414634146
