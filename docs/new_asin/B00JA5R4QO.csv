8649210,3,B00JA5R4QO,"A young American girl intent on being an adoring wife marries British royalty. On her wedding day she spies her new husband with his mistress. She then determines to be scandalous herself and become a powerful socialite. Power becomes more important than love. This is a well done drawing room drama with many conflicts and interesting twists, but there may be too much idle chatter for many viewers. Nonetheless, its interesting enough to provide light entertainment.",1493510400,,468,5.171052631578948
