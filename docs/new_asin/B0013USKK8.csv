8253028,2,B0013USKK8,"I think the silk reeling title is misleading.  As I understand them, silk reeling exercises differ quite a bit from what is taught on this dvd.  This is all sticking hands, and not much variety of that.  He teaches one basic figure 8 movement and shows how to use it in a partner exercise.  Not at all useful to experienced practitioners.  It may be okay for absolute beginners who want to start working with a partner.",1489536000,,419,4.4605263157894735

8253031,5,B0013USKK8,"I am a huge fan of the YMAA company. My only complaint about them is that their DVDs and books are usually expensive; however, the higher price in this case is worth it. The DVD is easy to follow as long as you stay patient (not everyone picks up on this kind of stuff at the same time). It only took me about ten minutes to begin understanding. I highly recommend this for an already experienced T'ai Chi practitioner.",1360886400,,419,4.3164556962025316
8253032,5,B0013USKK8,"If you want to develop the ability to effectively use the unique techniques and applications of Taijiquan, this DVD is an essential part of the process.  Listening, following, sticking, leading and other intrinsic energies of Taijiquan can be developed through the practice of the sticking hands taught on this DVD.

It's been said that one of the goals of a Taiji practitioner during a fight is to maintain contact with their opponent in order to have more control over the situation.  The skills taught on this DVD clearly show the training necessary to accomplish such a goal.

Master Yang, Jwing Ming demonstrates the various drills with a group of his students.  Students are shown practicing the solo and two person drills.  This is always very helpful as one can see the variety of ways that the students express their understanding of the skills taught by Master Yang.

In the Taijiquan Classics there is a passage that details the path of power in the body:

  All movements initiate from the feet

  directed by the waist

  manifested in the fingers

As you watch and learn these drills, the above passage in the Taijiquan Classics becomes more relevant to the Taijiquan practitioner.

A few months ago I read an interview in Black Belt Magazine with a first place medal winner in Taijiquan push hands, heavy weight division.  He claimed that the phrase in the Taijiquan Classics, ""Move 10,000 pounds with 4 ounces"" is an illusion.  The man then insisted that in reality, large muscles and strength make it appear to the observer that very little effort was expended to move a large object.

I can only guess at this person's training, but I would imagine he has never been exposed to the kind of information on this DVD.  The subtler and more effective skills of Taijiquan cannot be learned until one has grasped the essence of sticking hands.  By using the intrinsic energies of Taijiquan, like sticking, leading, following and listening, one can neutralize and redirect an opponent's energy.

Strength is important, but when you match strength against technique, the latter usually prevails.

This DVD combines two previously released VHS tapes that were titled:

 Taiji Yin & Yang Symbol Sticking Hands 1: Yang Symbol Side

 Taiji Yin & Yang Symbol Sticking Hands 2: Yin Symbol Side

The DVD covers the following material, with both courses included on the DVD:

  Course 1

  Solo Practice

  Stationary Yang Side Training

  Moving Yang Side Training

  Parallel Moving Yang Side Training

  Bagua Circle Yang Side Training

  Course 2

  Solo Practice

  Stationary Yin Side Training

  Moving Yin Side Training

  Parallel Moving Yin Side Training

  Bagua Circle Yin Side Training

The drills are practiced in a horse stance, a bow stance, while moving forward, while moving backwards and walking in a Bagua circle.  Additionally numerous applications are shown using the sticking hands drills.

It might seem like overkill to practice so many different variations of the drills; doing large, small, vertical, horizontal, forward, and backward, etc...  But as Master Yang points out, ""You can't ask the enemy to cooperate with you"".  You must become familiar with the drills to the point where you can practice them in any order, direction, or combination.

Many times I will test a student by having them try an application on the left side, when they normally would only know the right side version.  Many students would have difficulty in performing a mirror image of stork spreads wings, for example, as that is one of the postures that is usually done only on one side in the form.  Roll back is another posture that is usually only performed on one side.

Do we ask the enemy to please repeat their attack, but only on the other side, the one we learned?  To truly understand and know a technique, it should be learned on both sides.  I've always appreciated that Master Yang teaches the basics, the applications, the practice drills, and the techniques from the left and the right.

Master Yang initially counsels the students to make large circles while practicing the drills, and then gradually make the circles smaller and smaller.  One might think that this lessens the effectiveness of the movement.  Yet when the outside movement and circle becomes smaller, the movement inside the body becomes larger.  The irony is that the most powerful movement is that which originates from the internal, not the external.

For all students, this is one vital package of information that can lead to a more profound understanding of Taijiquan.  Thanks again, Master Yang!",1207699200,18,4592,4.973509933774834
