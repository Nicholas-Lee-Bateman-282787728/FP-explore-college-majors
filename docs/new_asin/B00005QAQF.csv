The Five Venoms might be the most famous, but it doesn't have much fighting, and what little there is is sub-par.  Crippled Avengers has unusually involving characters with great fighting and lots of it, so it is pretty much their best film.

Avenging Warriors of Shaolin (aka Shaolin Rescuers) gives a lot a screen time to Chang Cheh's second and third string stables of martial arts actors and is memorable for fleshing out their characters more than in most of the rest of the Venoms oeuvre.  It also contains the most amusing display of comraderie in the entire Venoms canon: that between Kuo Chui and Lo Meng as tofu restaurant waiters.  The only thing that comes close is the interplay between Fu Sheng and Sun Chien in The Chinatown Kid.  A lot of people find the repartee between Kuo Chui in this film to be cloying to the point of nausea, but once you get really used to the Venoms and love them, this film scores on so very many levels.

I understand how some may not like this film, and I do not recommend it to anyone to anyone who's seen less than at least three or four other Venoms films, but for the true fan, this is one that demands being played over and over again.",1218931200,3,1266,4.407725321888412

I was only 10 years old when Black Belt Theater came on the scene on channel 11, though the titles of the movies are fuzzy to me, I do remember seeing this one. If you are a die hard fan of this genre like me you would know from seeing this movie it isn't the best of the genre but still it has it's moments. It doesn't compare to master killer, 5 venoms, 4 assassins, and super ninjas but still if your a hard shaw bros. fan add this to your collection!",1046822400,5,557,3.938053097345133

7949974,3,B00005QAQF,"This DVD has all of your Shaw Bros favortie actors, they gathered everyone for this battle!  The final battle has about a dozen fighters-- none of which are the lowly henchmen type, its a full on battle of skilled warriors.  Even better, they use lots of different weapons as well, building up to the final battle with the master spearman.
Still, despite having plenty of fighters and lots of weapons, the action in this DVD is not spectacular.  Lots of the punches and kicks are performed slower than you'd expect, making it look like their not really fighting at all.  Also, the camera is often way too close to the action for you to really appreciate the skills being displayed.
There are also some other strange elements that make their way into the film including a master teaching how to fight with a bowl and chopsticks.  It might sound kind of cool, but it ends up looking foolish on-screen, when the student uses the chopsticks to fight against a swordsman.  I'd recommend only to the die hard Shaw Bros fan.",1008115200,6,1017,4.622222222222222
