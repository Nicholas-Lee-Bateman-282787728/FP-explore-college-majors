6266359,1,B00IJS2NZU,"Zach (Zach Gilford) and Samantha (Allison Miller) are newlyweds who annoyingly film everything and they don't do it well. On their honeymoon to the islands, she becomes pregnant with the anti-Christ which proves to be an annoyance to her vegan lifestyle.

At one point when they weren't filming themselves, they used an overhead store camera to maintain the realism. It was really nice for a change to see something without a camera jerking about or a head being cut off. What was with the kid with a camera making a film in a dark hallway?

Carrying the dark lord around in your tummy makes Holy Communion a little more exciting than usual. Apparently Satan cannot be born in a normal manner and has to come into the world making a lot of noise with kitchen utensils.

The film picks up at about an hour. If you managed to make it that far you qualify for one punch on your hacker card, same as watching someone else's bad home movie about their little anti-Christ.

6266361,5,B00IJS2NZU,"Zach (Zach Gilford) and Samantha (Allison Miller) are two newlyweds with some strange habits indeed, including attending an underground party in Santo Domingo the night of their wedding where they know no one at all.

I don't understand why everyone seems to despise this very disturbing movie.  Some of has the quality of the really nastier Satanic picks: ""The Amityville Horror II: The Possession"", ""The Omen"", all done in a pretty novel way.  The scenes with poor Father Thomas are the best, especially when Zach visits him in the hospital.  He's slowly, remorselessly being destroyed by the pestilence emerging from Samantha, and no can do annnytthing about it.

This is a great horror flick unfairly received.",1454371200,2,714,5.120689655172414

6266370,4,B00IJS2NZU,"I don't know what it is with people who think found footage movies should begin with blood spattering across the camera lens...seriously, people are doing nothing but whining about watching the two main characters doing normal activities.  THIS STYLE OF VIDEO IS SUPPOSED TO TAKE 30-60 MINUTES BEFORE ANYTHING EERIE HAPPENS.  QUIT ACTING SURPRISED.  IT'S RETARDED.

Now, as to the movie itself, it is a unique mix of FF perspectives; the majority of the film is shot by one of the protagonists at about head level with a camcorder, which is nothing new.  But occasionally it switches users, and the movie's perspective changes to spy cameras and even some retail security cameras (black and white with no sound) in places like stores or parking lots (places that would have security cams).

Screw what you heard, I'm spreading the word.  The acting was top notch.  The effects were top notch.  The story was a LITTLE bit predictable, hence 4 stars.  The locations were more than varied enough.  The camera work was top notch.  This was a very good FF movie, completely devoid of anything to whine and cry about.

The movie is dark, both literally and figuratively. The wedding scene was lovely, but it went downhill from there. On your honeymoon, how stupid do you have to be to turn down dark isolated streets with an unknown cab driver and end up in a club and drink shots of unknown liquid? OK - so we're past that...SPOILER alert although you'd have to be living in a cave not to catch on, she gets pregnant with Satan's child - voodoo style.  And what happened to the original OB doctor?

6266382,5,B00IJS2NZU,"I have to disagree with most of these reviews. This is a very good movie of its type for suspense and sheer eerieness.  The blurb on the DVD sleeve, however, is completely misleading and sounds more like a ""Blair Witch Project"" movie than the actual story.

The crime has already been committed and the culprit arrested. The video tape is evidence. Fillmed by Zach, the young husband, beginning the night before his wedding to Samantha, the video tape was to be a ""Family Album"" of their life. The only thing odd about Samantha thus far is that she's an orphan, delivering by C-section after her mother was killed in an auto accident. Now, she's part of Zach's family. The tape shows their honeymoon in Santo Domingo, getting lost, being taken to a weird nightclub and waking up the next morning not remembering the night before. Samantha becomes pregnant in spite of the Pill. So far it looks like simply a young couple's recorded life but slowly odd things happen which, combined, add up to terror. Samantha, a vegetarian, begins to crave raw meat, actually eating it out of the case at the grocery and killing the deer on their property. She becomes destructively violent when she's touched or anyone enters the nursery.  Someone begins watching their house and Zach sees the taxi driver from Santo Domingo in their church. The priest has a stroke and afterward when shown drawings of symbols Zach saw on the island, becomes violent. Sam's doctor disappears and is replaced by another. All this is recorded on the tapes.

There's a definite resemblance to Rosemary's Baby without the explanation of why all this is happening and that makes it even more frightening because there seems to be no cause. Zach certainly doesn't profit from what's happening. In fact, he's one of the victims. I found the hand-held camera device a little distracting at first but as the story progressed, its unwieldyness added to the chaos going on in Zach's mind.  Those wanting a reason and a purpose behind what happens won't like this tale very much but that's the way some of the most frightening events happen sometime...for no reason apparent to the victim.  The sheer fright and frantic concern Zach has for his wife and unborn child carry the story and I think that was what was intended. This is a story of the victim, not the perpetrator, and for me, it works.",1427760000,2,2353,4.754901960784314

Honestly, have none of these people ever even seen The Blair Witch Project, let alone its too-numerous-to-count imitations? Well, young Zach McCall (Friday Night Lightss Zach Gilford) apparently hasnt, or hed know better than to head down to a voodoo-infested locale like Santa Domingo for his honeymoon - dark tourism, anyone? - documenting every ill-fated moment as he goes.

At any rate, something mighty untoward happens to the newlywed couple while they're down there, and when they return to the States, Samantha (Allison Miller) finds herself pregnant despite the fact that she has been on the pill for ages. Suffice it to say, Mia Farrows Rosemary has nothing on this poor girl when it comes to a questionable conception, followed by a monumentally troubled pregnancy and delivery.

Devils Due might have been effective were it not so utterly derivative of so many films that have come before it.

We have seen it all before a gazillion times:

1. The completely unrealistic bonehead who has to film EVERY single detail of his life, including taking a whiz, surfing the internet, eating dinner, picking his nose during a ""selfie"" session, etc. etc. etc.  **YAWN**

2. Handheld video cameras for about 80% of the movie. Hidden video cameras for about 18% of the movie, and totally irrelevant people-we-don't-know filming themselves for about 2% of the movie. Most of it is choppy, unfocused, extremely shaky filming by someone who appears to have Parkinson's.  **HEADACHE**

3. The young, semi-attractive newlywed, who is mysteriously, and for no apparent reason, other than that she is newly wed, impregnated with a devil-child. Typically it is the son of Satan, a demon, some unexplained form of evil incarnate, or, as in this case, an anti-Christ. None of this makes any credible sense, whatsoever.  **YAWN**

4. The nincompoop friends and family members whose appearances in the film are completely unnecessary and have no bearing, whatsoever, on the story. None of their characters are developed at all. NONE of them. I am not kidding. I didn't even know the girl who came to ""watch"" over the pregnant woman at the request of the husband was his sister, until much later when it was briefly mentioned. **CONFUSION**

5. Same old ending. **YAWN**

It is hard to believe that ANY movie studio would greenlight this trash. They did nothing but waste their money.

NOTE: I did give the movie a slight bump above a one-star rating because the acting was above-par for such a terrible film.  Nobody was over-acting or wooden in their delivery, throughout. Too bad these marginally satisfactory actors did not have more to work with.

Final Rating: 1 1/2 to 2 Stars ... okay, 1 3/4 stars, and that is really pushing it.",1407283200,2,1857,4.951612903225806

6266443,1,B00IJS2NZU,"Over the last few years, I've found myself in the unenviable position of having to defend the potential merits of the 'Found Footage' genre that's practically taken over the horror flick industry. The vast majority of film buffs were sick of the gimmick over a decade ago; however, like a bad penny, reality TV, and Dr. Phil, it keeps turning up. I understand the malaise-bordering-on-hostility directed towards FF. And admittedly, one reason I haven't been bombarded with the stuff is because I'd made the decision some years back to cut back on the boob tube, a promise to myself I kept. Luckily for me, I suppose, most of my FF experiences have been pretty positive.
  The patriarch of the FF family is, of course, 'The Blair Witch Project', one of the most financially and creatively successful fright films of all time and a movie which NOBODY will admit to even admiring, just a little. I will, though. I saw it on the Friday of it's opening weekend at the theater, and sat transfixed. No, it's not great; judged strictly as another horror movie churned out from the factory, it's only riveting detail is it's complete and utter banality. But 'Blair Witch' was way more than that: thanks to a marketing campaign unique in its brilliance and a splendid directing innovation, the tiny student film project made that rarest of jumps, from ""movie"" to ""event"". Still, had the film itself stunk on ice, all the bells and whistles on Earth couldn't have saved it. Thankfully 'Blair''s creative faults were minor, and it produced just enough cool, original scares to keep the viewer in it til the end...and what an end. It's quite amazing what an unforgettable final act or scene can do for your opinion.
  I'm sure there were scores of ripoffs that were awful. I may have seen a couple of them and simply forgotten, but the next foray I made into the genre was the magnificent 'Paranormal Activity', a truly terrifying horror film that proved without question that the Found Footage fad existed for a good reason.
  The next two installments of the series were also very good, and stood on their own, a mind-boggling rarity in a fright flick sequel. The 'Paranormal' producers finally jumped the shark with the following two re-hashes, but even they were superior to most failed scary movies I've seen. Add to that mix the nifty V/H/S, and FF afficianados suddenly found themselves lots of ammo for any sudden debate that might break out unexpectedly.
  Which bring me to 'Devil's Due'. When I saw it was available at my local Redbox, I didn't hesitate. Looking back, it's obvious my pickiness and sheer luck in viewing the right Found Footage films had made me confident, even cocky. ""Come on, it's a Devil flick hand crafted with the surefire style that saved celluloid horror 15 years ago. It's gotta be decent, at least..."" In retrospect, chilling last words.
  'Devil's Due' is a Dud, a Dismal Disaster so Dunderheaded it's Dearth of originality or inspiration is Difficult to Deduce. Sorry about that. Ahem..In conclusion, let me guarantee that the biggest FF proponent could not possibly claim that this boring dreck is watchable in the least, nor is it helped at all by it's gimmick.

6266450,1,B00IJS2NZU,"I'm certainly not going to say anything positive about this movie, but I also struggle to pinpoint anything about it worth denigrating, since it's impossible to find a single idea that is original to the plot.  Devil's Due is entirely derivative, being a complete retread of Rosemary's Baby, albeit filmed in the style of Paranormal Activity.  (There's even a tinge of Terminator in the framing sequences.)  For dialogue, it has that cutesy, sardonic, lovey-dove patter common to the found footage format where modern couples are featured as the main characters (i.e., Paranormal Activity 3).

I suspect that this film originated as someone's great idea to use the title, ""Devil's Due,"" applied to a loose plot about the birth of the (or in this case ""an"") antichrist.  All the flimsy details would be cobbled together later after the film was greenlit.

Maybe there are a few specific points that I can poke at.  First, the viewer will be interested to know that there is apparently a substantial Latin-speaking subset of the population of Santo Domingo.  I never knew.

The tenuous theological connection that the plot seeks to make between the paranormal happenings and the bible are laughable.  It posits the existence of a satanic group that existed during the early days of Christianity, replete with its own set of religious symbols and beliefs.  There were in fact many early heretical groups, but none resembling the character described here, and none professing to worship satan.  Also funny is the suggestion that an average parish priest, presented here as the mouthpiece of exposition, would have intimate knowledge of such a group.  He quotes from 1 John a passage relating to the arising of several antichrists.  Now, there are biblical passages that can be referenced that would suggest the existence of a supernatural antichrist to come near the end of time.  However, the passage used, if considered in context, is clearly not one of them.  In context, the antichrists referred to are ordinary human beings, alive at the time of the epistle's writing, the advocates of the specific heresy against which the author was then writing.  Unfortunately, because this movie wants to promote the idea of a plurality of antichrists, it latches onto this passage and pours on the drama.  Also regarding the priest, his acting is atrocious.  There is a scene in a church where the priest is supposed to be overwhelmed by the power of the antichrist, located in the pews in front of him in utero.  From the look on the priest's face, though, rather than experiencing some profound spiritual intuitiion, instead it comes off as though he has just crapped his vestments.

The plot sets up, early on, a suggestion that the female lead has a mysterious past and a sinister destiny.  This would suggest that the events that unfold and the ordeals that she is subjected to were a long time coming.  The eventual point of contact between her and the satanic cultists on her honeymoon is more or less opportunistic for them.  However, in the last scene of the movie, which presents a new couple abducted on their honeymoon at a new locale, the insinuation is that the cultists are just randomly abducting newlyweds.  The carefully hinted backstory of the female lead is made to seem irrelevant.  Movies like this oftentimes like to have a twist at the end; I understand that.  It isn't often that the twist is permitted to completely undermine the preceding movie.",1404345600,,3462,4.944636678200692

6266458,1,B00IJS2NZU,Reminded me of Paranormal Activity.  You view the entire movie through a cam recorder.  The story itself had no substance. I wouldn't recommend this movie.,1403049600,,155,5.16
6266459,1,B00IJS2NZU,"I'm ever the optimist, so I'll try movies or books that interest me, even if a lot of other people hated it. Sometimes I luck out and really enjoy it, and sometimes I despise it. Devil's Due is honestly one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.

The 'first person' alternating with 'hidden camera' style of this entire movie added nothing and became incredibly annoying quite quickly. Lots of time was wasted on bits that lent nothing to the story- honeymoon tourism activities, opening wedding gifts, Dad's filmed tour of the neighborhood for impending baby...ugh. Snooze fest.

It took over an hour for this movie to command my attention. While there's hints of issues with the pregnancy as it goes along, this movie misses the mark for horror or suspense until the last few minutes, and even then, it's not show-stopping but just mediocre at best. The majority of this movie just floats along with little to offer in the way of actual entertainment. You could watch a 'What to Expect' video, throw in 2 minutes of mild suspense or tension, and you've got the idea of the vast majority of this movie.

I'm ashamed to admit that I sat through the whole thing. Shame on me! Be it a bad book or a bad movie, I really need to learn when to call it quits sometimes. This one falls into the 'waste of time' category without much pondering. I was very bored 5 minutes into it but I hoped it just needed time to get rolling as some do. Sadly, it does NOT really get better. At all. You've been warned!

I'm disappointed it was such a boring flop. Sure, many pieces have been done around the devil's baby idea, but done well, it can still be a gripping story. It's not the idea that's stale and boring here, but the way it's presented.

Don't waste your time on this one. You'd be better off watching The Omen for the 54th time- truly. And no, I did not expect this to be nearly as good as that classic. But I did have hopes it has SOMETHING redeeming about it.

Will I still watch the sequel even if they decide to keep using the ""collected"" footage idea? Yup, sure will.

6266462,1,B00IJS2NZU,"Well, for the first time in my life, I have to give Redbox some credit for being around.  I'm a pretty big fan of horror films, and in many cases, buy the DVD.  But with flood of so many horror movies lately, you can't watch them all when they play in the theaters.  This was one of those films I decided to wait on.  I'm glad.  Because it's all re-hash.  I find it funny that right now, as I write this review, a Rosemary's Baby remake is in progress.  Really?  Another remake?  Go Hollywood!!
Honestly, if you have already seen the aforementioned original film, along with The Omen, then throw in a little of the movie Chronicle, then you really shouldn't waste your time.
There is one small other problem I have with the film.  The end credit song ""Once Upon A Time"".  It actually wasn't just in the end credits, but at the beginning of the film as well.  This may be my own personal opinion, but I found it distasteful to use a song by Robert Bradley's Blackwater Surprise, that was recorded by a different band.  Why not just use the original song?  They never gained any fame or anything in the late 90's and early '00's, and might have enjoyed a re-look.  Gaslight Anthem...a bunch of young white guys...singing about how they remember Marvin Gaye and Otis Redding....how cheesy!  So, in essence....this whole film delivers nothing original.

Before this movie came out, there was a cute little  minute and a half video  on Youtube with a mechanized baby in a carraige, which was remotely controlled to  move on it's own while the baby would rise up, puke, growl, or spit on people.  It was very clever, but it was also a cleverly, deceptively designed way to fool, trick, gode,the public into  thinking it would be in the movie that was a part of this short.  IT WAS NOT.  All  the way through, I kept thinking, they better hurry  up, cause that baby  hasn't shown up yet, and she hasn't even had it yet,1 hour and 15 minutes into this pile of dung.  In actuality, there was a baby doll laying on the darkly lit floor, shown at a distance, which didn't even move, and then a hooded figure covered it and whisked it away.  They spent more money on that 3 minutes of video  than they did in the whole damn movie.  If they thought they were playing an April Fools joke on the  public, since it came out on DVD very close to that month, they only succeeded  in creating a lynch mob that would like  to find them and string them up by their Buster Browns.

The film is about a couple that have a good time together, but when they start to have a baby that all changes. The movie does have some scary moments, and of course some jump scares. I do like the premise, and I was interested to see this movie, because it was directed by one of the VHS directors. The mystery in the film was pretty interesting. I like the fact that the husband is trying to figure out why his wife is not normal. The found footage in the movie was a bit scary at times. The only parts that annoy me were the jump scares that pop up. Is it as bad as the critics says it is, surprisingly it's not, so yeah I don't think it's a bad movie.

Then it cuts to two terrible characters in the middle of a mockumentary horror flop.  There was never any reason to make this a ""found footage"" film, because there's footage popping up from many different sources that somehow always get the perfect angle and was edited together by a professional.  And speaking of the characters, the dog is the only character I ever rooted for in this thing, and well, unfortunately dogs don't have a good track record when it comes to squaring off with El Diablo.

The entire movie is the wife doing unconscious evil doings to some people she meets then asks her husband, ""What's wrong with me!?""  And clearly, there are a lot of things wrong, but he always answers, ""Nothing.""  As the husband makes more poor decisions despite his loyal dog trying to tell him something's wrong, it's too clear the ending will be none too pleasant.

All this might have been okay if the filmmakers had the presence of mind to realize it's a bad movie and try to at least make it a fun watch.  Unfortunately, the movie plays it dead serious most of the time and doesn't even try to interject clever satire of better devil baby movies made in the past.

6266484,2,B00IJS2NZU,"A great indicator for how good or bad a horror film will be (or any film, really), is how much of it is revealed in the trailer. If people know they have a shallowly plotted and poorly cobbled together movie, they'll stick every impressive moment in the trailer, even if it gives away the entire plot. The confidence behind really good films (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inception/dp/B0047WJ12K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inception</a>, say, or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Cabin-In-The-Woods/dp/B0095R4Z8C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Cabin In The Woods</a>) is first demonstrated in the previews that entice viewers with curious questions rather than all of the giant, CGI'd answers.

There is absolutely no way to spoil DEVIL'S DUE, unless I tell you maybe the final five minutes of the film, and even that won't be too hard for viewers to guess, especially if they pay much attention to the first five minutes. Basically, what you have here is a rehash of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rosemary-s-Baby/dp/B000IZ8NBU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rosemary's Baby</a>. Samantha and Zach are two newlyweds who travel to the Dominican Republic for their honeymoon. After an evening of heavy partying, they wake up with no memory of the night before (although viewers are given glimpses of what happened; the first sign that the film doesn't trust its audience all that much). When they get home -- surprise, surprise -- Samantha is preggers. With Satan!

Or at least A satan. The movie opens with a Biblical quote that explains that, in the end times, there will be a large number of different Antichrists that are born. Sam is one of the  lucky chosen mothers. Watch as she goes from being a vegetarian to eating raw meat. Amaze as she shatters the windows in a minivan with her bare hands because it moved a little in her direction. Yawn as she goes through annoying mood swings and gets ultrasounds. She is pregnant after all.

Big problem here: we have another found footage film. Holy cow, am I officially sick of these things now, and of all the movie buffs I know, I have been one of the long holdouts and biggest defenders of the merits of the style. But no. I'm done now. I see clearly that 99% of found footage films only use that style because it kinda-sorta detracts from the fact that the story is horrible or nonexistent. There are exceptions to this, of course (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bay/dp/B00BITSYZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bay</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Behind-the-Mask-The-Rise-of-Leslie-Vernon/dp/B000OYCMLM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon</a>&nbsp;are pretty good), but not many.

The story, in almost all cases, is the camera or cameras, and that's about it.

So, of course, we have the required dialogue explaining why all of this is being filmed (Zach is using high-tech gear given as a wedding present to document the honeymoon and, later, to make a video diary for his unborn child), as well as cranky dialogue demanding that the filming be stopped. We have hidden cameras and shaky night vision. We have security footage and interrogation films. And we have a woman who is pregnant ... with Satan!

Completely unimaginative in pretty much every way, what could and/or should be frightening about the film is demolished by its predictability and annoying reliance on this long-dead cinematic style. There are one or two effective moments -- you've definitely seen bits of both of them in the trailer (one involving some wayward youths who stumble upon our possessed momma and the other involving the big climax) -- but this really isn't any more interesting than it would have been as the video diary of a normal pregnancy.",1400803200,2,4398,6.085483870967742

6266515,5,B00IJS2NZU,"The 411 by Maria:

As soon as the opening scene starts I remembered the trailer. A guy sitting in an interrogation room all bloody looking down while he is asked questions about his wife's death.

Samantha and Zach are on their honeymoon when they find a taxi to go back to the hotel. The driver talks them into heading to an underground place for some more partying. They reluctantly say yes and eventually wake up unsure of how they even got to their hotel room. (My husband and I were yelling at the TV at this point. ""Stop, the guy needs a flash light to enter the building! Why are you still following him, RUN Forest Run!"") We, the viewer, see them being carried to a satanic symbol on the floor.

Sam soon finds herself pregnant even with birth control pills. Eventually strange things start happening. Sam has a craving for raw meet and devours it literally at the meat counter in a super market. She gets nose bleeds and her back is completely bruised and she has super human strength whenever she feels she is threatened.

Eventually they notice people watching the house and camera are installed in the home but I still don't know by who. At a friend's communion the priest starts spitting up blood during the ceremony. We see Sam's eyes turn red!

During this time Zach is slowly investigating symbols, visiting the priest and even sees the cab driver at the church. Eventually he for some reason breaks into a house where he sees footage of his own home. He is nearly stopped but races back to his home to find Sam screaming in a pool of blood with her belly cut open. He watches at the cab driver and doctor take the baby and he is arrested for the murder of his wife!

Interesting story. Not scary. I love that the story was told through the camera. Throughout the movie Zach is filming everything. Makes it seem more documentary then movie.

The scariest scene to me was when a little girl enters the nursery looking for her aunt and Sam steps out of the shadow to say ""get out"". This is kind of a Rosemary's Baby but better!",1399507200,8,2041,4.4411764705882355

6266524,1,B00IJS2NZU,"My first one star review, kind of special...

In a word, this film is dull.  All the marketing, trailers, and devil baby prank stuff is misleading at best, or bait and switch false advertisement at worst, depending how you feel about it.

In the broad sense of the term, this film falls into that gray area genre, known as mockumentaries and found footage, without the ""found"" part gimmick.  It is a bunch of segments from various cameras and sources, spliced together.  The viewer is never privy to how the footage exists, merely that it does.  Like many in the sub-genre, the first hour or so is loose character build up, plot holes, and various filler scenes that do nothing to progress the film, but pushes it along to meet that 90 min minimal run-length they had in their cross-hairs.

Story itself has zero to do with the devil baby.  It's entire screen time is, at best, 10 seconds and has no memorable action.  The film is completely about a woman getting black-out drunk, not remembering a whole night, learning she is pregnant, and ""weird"" situations start happening.  Toss in a few cultists keeping tabs on how the pregnancy is going, and that is the film in a nutshell.  We have all seen better, on small budgets, with less time wasted.

Seriously, this is coming from a guy who flat out loves the shovel-ware that is SyFy original films and the dime-a-dozen found footage films you see splattered across Amazon, Hulu, and Netflix.  I usually like crap films, which is why I mentioned this is my very first 1-star review. This movie has NO redeemable qualities.  Everything worth seeing is covered in the trailers, no exaggeration whatsoever.

Save your cash.  Hell, I couldn't even recommend seeing this film for free on Netflix or something.  Just watch something else.  If you really have a need for a possession, or devil baby, type film... seek it elsewhere.  That short film in... I forget if it was V/H/S or V/H/S 2... one of those... much better devil baby story and at only 1/3rd the runtime.  Screw it, watch both V/H/S films... grab bag of good and bad short stories.  Even the worse story they have is far better than this film.

6266527,4,B00IJS2NZU,"I don't get the negativity about this film. When I watched the trailer, I was almost put off. Forget the trailer. While its technically 'found footage', at one point there were cameras installed in the couple's house, unbeknownst to them, which was a clever and effective way of transcending the limitations of the 1 person POV, the recorder.

Anyway, the production values are strong. It doesn't feel lo budget. We begin with the couple getting married, then going on honeymoon, and  that is where the pivotal encounter takes place that changes everything. The honeymoon segment was very good, imo. It built the tension and atmosphere quickly, since up to that point, it was all good times for the 2. On their return, things get strange pretty quickly. It doesn't drag. The rest is effective and tension continues to be built, though it is not sustained, more like up and down, as things happen then resolve, till the next one happens, etc. When the final part commences, its a fast, bloody ride.

I am a sucker for Satanic themed stories and so I had to give this one a whirl, despite the negative reviews. I am so glad I did. Its one of the better ones I've seen lately, especially the oh so many found footage film attempts that are like 'meh, seen it before'. Found footage of Satan's baby, I can get down with that.  There is really nothing wrong with this film, technically. If someone doesn't get into the story for whatever reason, that's them. Don't make the mistake of not watching it because you think its a technically inadequate, bad acting, bad story, lucky to have gotten made flick. Its not one of those.

6266531,2,B00IJS2NZU,"I should preface this review by saying I didn't pay any money to see this film; a friend bought it and wanted to watch it one night.  If I'd rented it myself or watched it in the theaters (or, God forbid, bought it unsuspectingly), I'd probably give it only 1 star.  So keep that in the back of your mind as you read on.

The film follows newlyweds Samantha and Zach (Allison Miller and Zach Gilford, who do an adequate job fulfilling their roles, at least by genre standards).  They go south of the border for their honeymoon, and for some reason wander into an out-of-the-way psychic's shop for a palm reading.  Then leave in a hurry and wander through a part of town usually inhabited by people who kidnap tourists.  Needless to say, something bad happens, and Sam becomes pregnant with a devil baby, and then starts acting weird, and eviscerating deer, all under the spell of a symbol eerily reminiscent of the video game QUAKE.

DEVIL'S DUE is typical of a found-footage horror film, in that it has mildly-wooden acting, overall poor effects, no logical plot whatsoever, and no adequate reason why the camera should always be on.  Also: if the lead couple would just turn on the lights once in a while, things might've turned out a little differently.  There are a couple of decent jump scares, and actually some truly interesting imagery, especially during the Devil rape scene and again during the climax.  But these alone probably aren't worth your time.  Give DEVIL'S DUE a chance if you enjoy this type of film (and I mean truly enjoy it).  But I wouldn't put much effort into viewing it, or put too much money down.  In the words of my friend who bought it: ""That movie just sucked.""  I won't go that far...but I wouldn't say it's too off the mark, either.",1399161600,2,1767,4.568253968253968

6266540,1,B00IJS2NZU,"Obviously, the horror genre has taken a drastic shift over the last few years  neglecting the typical masked killer with a butcher knife for unexplained mystical possessions and home invasions.  In the last year alone, the additions of The Conjuring, Insidious: Chapter 2, and Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones are just a handful of films that have incorporated strange, unexplained elements into the lives of occupants of a typical household setting.  Devils Due follows that general theme, also incorporating a strong Biblical element  that will be construed by many faith-based believers as beyond disturbing.

Directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett (V/H/S) reunite to helm Devils Due, starring Zach Gilford as Zach McCall and Allison Miller as his wife, Samantha.  When we first meet Zach, hes breaking into his own house to be with his bride-to-be, Samantha, the night before their wedding.  He has an obsession with videotaping everything, which also includes the following day  the wedding.  Their wedding goes down without a hitch, becoming one of their happiest days ever, and then they're quickly off to Santo Domingo for their honeymoon.

Once there, they enjoy their time on the beach and seeing the city  eventually prompting Samantha to get her palm read by a psychic, which doesnt go over so well.  Following the reading, the couple find themselves lost in the city, only to be picked up by an enthusiastic cab driver that promises to take them somewhere exciting for their last night.  The driver delivers them to a back alley club where Zach and Samantha party the night away, but not before things take an out-of-the-ordinary turn for the worst.

The following morning, the couple awakens in their hotel room  a little under the weather, and catches their flight back home where they prepare to start their married lives together.  Nearly right away after they return, Samantha shockingly reveals to Zach that shes pregnant  even despite the miniscule chance she could become pregnant.  At first, everything appears to be fine with the pregnancy   but as the baby grows closer to its birth, strange things begin happening to Samantha.  Having documented everything, Zach takes it upon himself to attempt to figure out what is causing his wifes abrupt change in attitude.

On the basis of Devils Due being a horror movie, it badly fails that criteria  since its not actually scary as much as it is downright strange and disgusting.  After the conclusion of the film, its easy to see the movie should have been devoted more to the storys unnerving cult rather than its oblivious main characters.  The cult in question is devoted to the devil (apparently), and it somehow empowers the unborn child with Jedi (I guess Sith in this case) force push powers (thats the best way to describe it).  Crazy baby powers notwithstanding, the other cringe-worthy moments include the random appearance of Bambi in the woods and a scene where a doctor puts an incredibly large needle into Samanthas stomach.  Like I said, not so much scary as it is strange and disgusting.

At some point, scriptwriter Lindsay Devlin decided it would be an interesting idea to turn one of the Bibles most bothersome quotes into a film  which obviously will disgust a vast majority of potential moviegoers and severely limit viewer interest.  Aside from that, the major underlying problem with the film is the undeniably poor execution of the film.  The directors decided to make this into a POV (point of view) feature, creating an endless amount of bouncing that could easily make a few viewers queasy.  Finally, its pretty rare but this is also one of those strange occasions where the advertising schemes overshadowed the film.  If you're unsure what that means, feel free to look-up devil baby attack in New York City  - which managed to make its way into the news.

From the get-go, Devils Due makes no attempt to hide what its really about:  the coming of the antichrists  and yes, thats supposed to be plural.  The very first thing you see at the beginning of this film is a Bible quote from 1 John 2:18  which mentions the last hours (probably meaning days) leading up to the arrival of the antichrist.  Of course, this isn't the first film to tackle this disturbing subject, but it is the first to do so in the same style of filmmaking as The Blair Witch Project.  And, for those of you that never saw that revolutionary (depending who you ask) flick, then all it should mean to you is that this film is shot almost entirely with a camcorder (occasionally a ""spy"" house camera).

Since the camcorder/steady cam style of filmmaking is used, it obviously limits the involvement of the actors.  There are only a handful of moments that youll see both Gilford and Miller on screen together, making it incredibly difficult for them to ever really form meaningful chemistry.  You understand that they're in love, and its well understood that Zach loves for his wife, but its really hard to care what happens to these characters.  To be sure, they make the mistake of being at the wrong place at the wrong time, but other than that, they only real message to take from this film is don't get into unannounced cabs in foreign cities.

Overall, Devils Due doesnt belong in the horror franchise.  It belongs in the movies that have no point and you should never watch category.  The acting is barely average, but even if it were better it wouldnt change the outcome.  Without a clear-cut purpose, other than to bring the antichrist to Earth, theres no mistaking the fact that Devil's Due is an absolute waste of time, money, and effort.  This particular film is so devoid of purpose that its even hard to imagine horror gurus giving this movie a glance, let alone an hour and a half of their life.  Do yourself a favor and move along.  Theres nothing to see here.

6266544,1,B00IJS2NZU,"Like many, and possibly you yourself, the way I found out about this film was through the Baby Devil Prank seen all over the internet where a Devil baby in a pram operated by remote control, is pranking people throughout New York City, by scaring them, flipping them off and regurgitation etc.

The prank made this film look like it might be a fun horror movie along the lines of Chucky? How wrong you would be to think that. This film is basically Paranormal Activity (enter whatever sequel number here). Sure, this film throws in a few visual effects, but nothing as good as say like in simmilar hand held movies with CGI like ""V/H/S"".

What's even worse, and not to try and spoil the movie for you, but don't worry, watching it is the biggest spoiler of the movie, least what you expected compared to what you get, but that devil baby thing in the prank has nothing what-so-ever to do with this film. You don't see it for even a split second. I'm sure the promoters thought it was brilliant advertising, but to me and many others, it's FALSE ADVERTISING.

So the film is about a newly married couple who are very much in love, and don't realize she is carrying the devils baby. That's it. Not much in between of any interest, a few cheap effects here and there, no memorable or worthy moments... and ummm... oh yeah, NO DAMN DEVIL BABY.

Pass on the film. Some say it's passable, not great but don't understand why it's being slammed so much? Because of the damn baby devil prank video that has nothing to do with any visual concept in this film... so, if you haven't seen that video, you might watch this film and think, ""Euhh, OK, never wanna see it ever again""... but if you have seen that prank video, don't expect it to have anything to do with this movie. The prank video had scarier scares than this abomination of unofficial Millionth version of Paranormal Activity.",1398556800,5,1877,4.495601173020527

6266548,4,B00IJS2NZU,"I gave this movie four stars because I'm a fan of the ""found footage"" genre of horror movies and this one was particularly well done.

While at certain points I asked myself ""why would they be filming this"" I realized it wouldn't be much of a movie if they hadn't.  A line or two of dialogue would have better explained why Zach felt he had to continue filming when any real life pregnant woman would have smashed the camera over her husband's head; let alone a woman carrying the offspring of demonic forces.  The film itself tried to build tension toward a horrific conclusion but barely created any real suspense or dread.  All that being said, there were some finer points to the movie, and those points are why I gave it four stars.  I will do my best not to give any spoilers.

Let's face it, ""found footage"" has lost some its edge in recent years because of how common the format has become.  However, in Devil's Due, there were moments where the camera was shaking for legitimate reasons in the story instead of poor filming methods which I felt lent a certain authenticity to movie overall.  Probably the most unnerving aspect was how the story was recorded.

I genuinely try to approach each new movie I watch without trying to compare it to other films.  Devil's Due could be compared to many films which cover the ""Satan's baby momma"" theme but this one had a fairly fresh perspective on the subject.  I think the lead actress did a very good job bouncing between the scared newly wed to psychotic pregnant lady with evil powers.  She really gave a sense that she had no idea what was happening to her throughout the movie.

The best aspect of Devil's Due is the atmosphere and how it slowly darkens.  The movie starts out bright and hopeful but slowly moves through shades of grey eventually dropping in to a very dark place.  The jump scares were well timed and pretty effective when building tension in the moment.  Some of the plot was predictable but not so overdone as to ruin the overall story.

My favorite part was the ending; the place where all the madness has led.  Being a huge fan of the ""possession"" genre of horror I can honestly say that this was one of the best displays of demonic activity I've ever seen.  The sheer violence of it made the wait worth it; particularly when you can experience the effects of demonic forces from a first-person point of view instead of through a camera stuck in the corner.  The angle itself lends a certain realism to the fantastic events that are taking place.

Most people compare movies like Devil's Due to Paranormal Activity and Blair Witch.  My advice is that if you really want to enjoy a movie then stop comparing it to predecessors.  On it's own Devil's Due was a fun horror movie.",1397520000,9,2754,4.530364372469635
6266549,1,B00IJS2NZU,"Once again Hollywood dishes out ANOTHER demonic possession/Antichrist movie. It seems like demon movies are all they focus on these days. So basically the movie is about this couple, Zach and Samantha who recently get married and travel to the Dominican Republic for their honeymoon. Like a lot of typical 80s/90s horror films, they visit a shady fortune teller who warns the couple ""They've been waiting for you.""

After leaving, they hire a taxi driver when they get lost on a street they don't recall being on. Zach and Samantha's taxi driver takes them to an underground nightclub which is really a satanic nightclub. Samantha gets drugged and taken off to some chamber where these douchebags perform a ritual that summons an evil and powerful supernatural force to get inside of her. She wakes up and thinks she simply passed out from all the alcohol. Once they travel back to the United States, she discovers she's pregnant. Samantha becomes puzzled by this since she has taken birth control pills since their wedding. She thinks she's carrying a normal baby, but unbeknownst to her and her husband, she's really carrying Satan in the form of an unborn baby. And that's where their journey to hell (literally) begins.

A mysterious hooded figure seems to stalk them around, a series of weird paranormal things begin to take place within the house (sound like a familiar movie?), and Samantha's attitude shifts drastically, becoming very protective of the baby if someone gets even remotely close to her or her belly.

The writers try to make this a scary film but just like every other horror film these days, it unintentionally turns out to be comical. There's one scene where Samantha is in a grocery store and she opens a pack of raw meat and begins eating it while shoppers just stand and watch her. Seriously?? Not only is this film more comical (in a bad way) than scary but it's also predictable. There are so many parts of this where you'll say to yourself ""I knew that was going to happen"". I won't give away anymore though in case there's someone who actually decides to check this out

I was actually mad at myself for wasting money on such a film that's poor in every aspect. If you want to see a Satan-child movie that's ACTUALLY creepy then just watch The Omen or Rosemary's Baby. Devil's Due is an atrocity and I'm just embarrassed for the group of people that actually thought this was a good idea. The worst part about this movie is that the ending leaves an open door for a sequel----which is the last thing it needs.
