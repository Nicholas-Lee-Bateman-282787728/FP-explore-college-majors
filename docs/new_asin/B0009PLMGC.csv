8064788,2,B0009PLMGC,"Was so happy to see this movie on Amazon. Unfortunately, it has been dubbed. Much better in the original language with subs. Ended up watching it on YouTube,",1390089600,,157,4.642857142857143
8064789,4,B0009PLMGC,The movie was funny.  This nomal guy is throwing into this situtation where he is being force into marrage with the mob's daughter.  They're from two different worlds and how they interact with each other makes this a funny movie.  Great for laughs.,1375833600,,249,4.744186046511628
8064790,4,B0009PLMGC,"although not big star actor or actress, but pretty good movie for the content and funny. The actress acting in the movie is good.",1365724800,,129,4.416666666666667
8064791,5,B0009PLMGC,"Really magic, as is another famous Korean film, ('I'm a Cyborg, and That's OK').

  The magic is this: On first viewing, the movie(s) seem silly, stupid, or weird, and definitely disjointed.
  It's very hard to understand what's going on, and scenes that might explain things seem to be missing. But these tricky Koreans always have a twist of some kind at or near the end, that gives the answer to a puzzle you didn't even know was there.

Then---you have to watch them a second time to understand it all, and to see that---they aren't really silly or stupid or weird or disjointed at all, and, in fact are more cohesive than a lot of other-nation movies. AND-this turns out to be a cute movie.

Recommend, recommend, recommend.",1232496000,4,729,4.6484375

8064794,5,B0009PLMGC,"This film, while woefully under appriciated at the festival I saw it at, by far deserved a best screen play award. It's lively and funny dialoge is boosted by the outrageously funny characters and situations plus one of the most perfect endings to this kind of comedy I've seen in a long time.

Some strong language and bloody violence make this otherwise sweet hearted romantic comedy more for the adult crowd.

Dont expect too much in terms of redeeming diadatic value here, this film is simply for fun and a lot of fun it is.",1125532800,9,528,4.5473684210526315
