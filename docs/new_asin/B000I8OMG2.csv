2653714,2,B000I8OMG2,It was good to see a Christian perspective that the news doesn't give but the video is drawn out and not very encouraging.  You don't walkaway seeing God's hand in the lives of those on the video just devastation and even the cross that is found doesn't do much for them.  Sorry to be negative but I wouldn't recommend it.,1316822400,,322,4.35
2653715,5,B000I8OMG2,"We watched this documentary last night (9/11/11)..it was an experience we will never forget. It is a must see for all and since it is just 1 hour in length it is perfect for a Sunday School, Bible Study, Christian meeting, etc., etc.  It is a very thought provoking documentary and very well done!",1315785600,6,297,4.5

2653717,3,B000I8OMG2,"I thought this documentary was going to be a lil more indepth than what the news was and in my opinion it really wasn't. I thought I would be learning much that was not covered by the orginal news and I really didn't. I bought it for my homeschooler I that didn't work either it was way too ""boring"" for kids and teens. I would really appreciate someone making a documentary on this event that would catch the interests all kids, teens and adults. Especially since this day marked a very tramatic day in history for all humanity. Sorry I hate not being able to give good reviews but...the truth must be told! this dvd would be great for some people but for most...even if the topic/event is very important to all not many could sit through this whole documentary.",1298246400,2,763,4.457142857142857
2653718,5,B000I8OMG2,I felt so many emotions watching this documentary.  I've never heard the stories of the rescue workers and this provided a wonderful forum for them to tell about their experiences.  It's a great story of faith.,1192579200,6,210,4.805555555555555

2653739,1,B000I8OMG2,"I attempted to watch this long and boring re-hash of the traumatic events of 9-11.  Even though this feature is just 55 minutes, it drags on and on and on.  They don't mention the cross until the end of the movie.  I understand how one can use this steel cross as symbol for faith but these characters narrating this boring film ""jump the shark"" to suggest that the cross is a miracle.  Really? Two steal beams forming a ""t"" or a cross is not a miracle and is not remarkable at all.  This is what happens when silly fundamentalists portray their outlandish emotional bs on the general public.",1400371200,7,592,4.444444444444445

These Erwin brothers are the sons of Hank Erwin member of Alabama gov.also dedicated christians from the church I was involved with in Birmingham. This is a great gift. ALL Americans should buy this and give it to someone.

2653742,1,B000I8OMG2,It was only a matter of time before fringe groups started to sully the memories of the victims and the selfless heroes who gave their lives for the sake of others on 9/11. There is little substance here and nothing redeeming.,1376438400,9,225,4.512195121951219

2653744,5,B000I8OMG2,"Enjoyed the different point of views/storylines. Thought film flowed well, and that they did a good job of choosing powerful, tasteful photos that spoke to your soul. I applaud the directors for the way the footage, interview, intertwined peacefully. It was pieced together nicely.

Throughout the film, over and over, the words ""respectful"", ""proud"", ""courageous"", & ""love"" would come to mind. The film did a great job of capturing the true American Spirit.  It proves that when people come together to work for the good of mankind, (brother to brother, sister to sister)amazing things can happen. As the film implies, it is during these ""ground zeros"" in our lives, where we find that our hearts are bigger than we ever realized, and our capabilities are way beyond what we imagined. This film highlights selfless acts, ""Do to others as you would have them do to you."" Luke 6:31.  These stories show exactly that....people sacrificing their lives for others.

This film is inspiring and touching.  Brings you close to the frontline of the 9/11 attacks.
Recommend ya give it a try!

It inspired me to put up a photo I had taken years ago in NYC. A photo of ""the cross"" several years after the attack.  I placed it on my bulletin board that I pass by  every day.  It's my reminder to keep praying for all the people that were touched by 9-11, all the workers, fire, police, emergency crews, volunteers, families, friends, and on and on. May God Bless them all.  They will NEVER be forgotten.",1373760000,,1491,4.766536964980545
2653745,5,B000I8OMG2,This brings back all the drama of that day and adds the subsequent storyline that many of us did not see.  It chronicles a part of the American experience that must be told and never forgotten.,1371513600,,193,4.361111111111111
2653746,5,B000I8OMG2,Whether you're a religious person or not you can't deny there crosses were left standing for a reason.

2653750,5,B000I8OMG2,this is a wonderful documentary. Very moving. I would recommend people to watch it to receive a fresh perspective on 9-11.,1358035200,,122,4.857142857142857
2653751,5,B000I8OMG2,"I loved this documentary. It told a story the news media would never want you to know about. Toward the end of the movie, while digging through all the wreckage, the police/ firemen found three Steel Crosses still standing. The symbolism of the crosses, meant a lot to the rescuers. Because the crosses would have signifigance for believers in Jesus,it is not something the news media(in this country), would ever likely share.
If you are not offended by ""The Cross"", you will really enjoy this video. I think it is a video everyone should see.",1354320000,2,544,4.7368421052631575
2653752,5,B000I8OMG2,"We as Americans will never forget 911, the exact thing we were doing when we heard the news. The
news of disbelief, anguish, and uncertainly. This movie is one of the most powerful movies I have
ever seen. After witnessing GOD's power, it's awe inspiring, never forgetting that trusting in him
is the ONLY answer. Let us never forget the children who have lost their mother or father due to
this unspeakable act. Amidst the mayhem, Jesus reigns supreme, and always will, for eternity. Man,
that's a long time. Buy this video and share to others. Don't keep it on your shelf at home. This movie
is meant to build motivation through life's heartache... JESUS is the ONLY name we need to know!",1352073600,,690,4.617886178861789
2653753,5,B000I8OMG2,This DVD was live interviews with the first responders and not actors. It took me back in my emotions plus the convergence of the beams to form the cross. God let them know He was there through it all.,1320883200,2,201,4.17948717948718
2653754,5,B000I8OMG2,"This is the most powerful documentary on the events surrounding the 9/11 tragedies from those that were victims, responders, family members, and reporters.  I have watched many movies, specials, and documentaries dealing with all aspects on the events leading up to and immediately following the 9/11 tragedies and this is revealed to me an miraculous and uplifting find at Ground Zero that I had NEVER seen or heard of being reported by the national media outlets . . . the cross found within the rubble of the Twin Towers that has since become somewhat controversial monument.

This hour long video was shown at my church on the anniversary of 9/11 a few days after our pastor had attended a spiritual retreat where the guest speaker was one of the first responders that shares his experience of being inside the towers when they collapsed and the days leading up to to his eventual rescue. This is, at once, a difficult, uplifting, emotional, stirring, and respectful documentary to watch for all ages.

I can best sum up this review by adding: ""And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose"" (Romans 8:28).",1320451200,2,1187,4.752427184466019

2653756,5,B000I8OMG2,"This is a well done, heart wrenching documentary about one of the most traumatic days our country has ever experienced. It demonstrates the amazing strength and courage of the men & women who worked so hard to save lives and give hope to our country and all of the families who've lost their loved ones. Through their relentless determination to recover people and clear this disastrous area, they discovered one piece of steel in the shape of a cross. Since it stood strong and alone amidst the debris, it seemed to have been symbolic of strength and hope to our working heroes and our country.

It is definitely worth the purchase as a remembrance of the courage and strength of all the men & women who sacrificed their lives and the dedicated workers who gave their all to assist and give hope to the survivors and our entire nation. To me, it's a reenforcement of what a wonderfully strong country we live in, and how thankful we should feel.",1319068800,3,946,4.597633136094674

2653758,5,B000I8OMG2,"The stories of these pastors, who psychologically suffered as much as the first responders, is remarkable. The story explores the innermost heart of the tragedy. Just when you think it's a hopeless darkness, the discovery of the cross at the latter part of the video puts SO much in perspective - it really answers the question ""Why did He 'let' this happen?"" It is a very uplifting and inspiring story and well worth watching more than once.",1318464000,4,442,4.753246753246753
