8153852,5,B000K0YPBA,"Dr. Buttar introduces the viewer to the destructive enemies within us - the free radicals and the damage they cause as they roam the body stealing free electrons from cellular components thereby causing destruction of structures and loss of functions...resulting in sickness and death. Heavy metals are a major contributor to the free radical toxic load in the body. This video especially focuses on mercury, the #2 most toxic substance known to man (behind #1 uranium).

The DVD describes the clinical use of EDTA and DMSA as chelating agents and their proper use in effectively removing heavy metals in the body. Difficulties experienced with DMSA by other practioners is addressed, and the role of heavy metals in Alzheimer's and Autism is mentioned. Through the use of chelation therapy complete reversals of autism have been achieved, as well as healings of a wide variety of other illnesses. When the toxic agents are ""flushed"" out, the body can proceed to do what only it can do....heal itself.

Dr. Buttar also describes how some people are heavy metal excreters and others are not. Two case histories are discussed, one an excreter and the other, a non-excreter. A genetic test for apolipoprotein E is useful in determining who can and cannot excrete the heavy metals.

Much time in the 2 hour DVD is spent discussing the clinical use of chelation. And although this DVD is directed toward the professional medical population (there are many clips from seminar presentations), Dr. Buttar uses scientific terminology and explanations along with layman descriptions that make this DVD useful for a wide range of health practitioners and health seekers.

My only criticism of this DVD is the price. It's not that it's not worth the price; it's worth every penny. This DVD has a message that needs to get out and be heard by lots and lots of medical professionals and lots and lots of sick people. Ideally it should be free (just like Apple computers were given free to schools back in the 90's), but more realistically something in the $20 range would make it more attractive to a larger population of buyers.

This DVD also addresses a major conflict within medicine today - the conflict between the healers and conscientious professionals who are trying to help those who are suffering and the status-quo gang with vested financial interests in keeping thing the way they are -who are raking in big bucks with the conventional ""treatments"" that don't heal, that just make lots of money at the expense and misery of millions of vulnerable sick people.",1302739200,3,2558,4.9672897196261685
8153853,5,B000K0YPBA,"I have seen Dr. Buttar speak several times before at medical conferences.  His ""Know Your Options-The Medical Series"" video presentation captures the essence of his live lectures.  He speaks in a way that my patients can understand the basis for many of the diseases they face.  My keen interest in ""Heavy Metal Toxicity the Hidden Killer"" is based on my concern for my dental patients as a ""biologic dentist"".

My core desire is to have my patients understand the risks of metal toxicity.  Almost none of my patients were aware that they were having a toxic material placed in their body every time a ""silver filling"" was prescribed and placed by their previous dentist.  With each and every ""silver filling"" containing mercury at nearly a 50% concentration, the total amount is substantial.  It is a travesty that the heavy metal mercury is still ignored as the predominant toxic metal used in traditional dental practice.  That's not informed consent.

Dr. Buttar has been instrumental in helping my patients to begin recognizing the potential for the wide ranging, seemingly unrelated, deleterious effects of heavy metal contamination on their health.  I look forward to having the entire video series in my office to share with my patients.  An alternative to heavy metal mercury fillings is certainly a major step forward for the aware individual who decides to take an active part in determining the future of his own health.
