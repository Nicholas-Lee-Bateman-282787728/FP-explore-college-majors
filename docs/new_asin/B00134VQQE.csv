Juan Pablo II, Karol, El Hombre que lleg a Papa y Karol II: El Papa, el Hombre, se constituyen en aire fresco para nuestras vidas, en el sentido de que tuvimos a nuestra vista, generacionalmente, a un Santo en el amplio sentido de la palabra.  Realmente, ambas pelculas, una continuacin de la otra, estn muy bien logradas, bien hechas!!!!  Como comentario, me parece que debera de promocionarse ms la comercializacin de la segunda parte, ya que en mi caso particular, tuve que hacer mil esfuerzos para conseguirla y a un precio alto!!!!.  A veces hay disponibles con inmediatez DVD's que no construyen, sino ms bien destruyen, y en este caso es una pelcula formativa, edificante, que nos muestra una vida a imitar.
Esta pelcula est en espaol y el ingls, para aquellos que talvez no la adquieren por temor a que la misma no venga en nuestro idioma. Que Dios nos bendiga a Todos!!!!

8249195,1,B00134VQQE,I did not want a Spanish version of the movie.  I attempted to speak with a representative and was unsuccessful.  Finally I returned the film with an accompanying letter.  I never heard from anyone at Amazon.,1392163200,,208,4.722222222222222
8249196,2,B00134VQQE,Unlike Karol I this film is produced solely in Spanish.  I was outraged that the film did not even have sub titles.  So if you read and understand Spanish this is a film for you.  If you do not then don't bother as it was targeted for only the Spanish speaking the rest of us be damned.  An outrageous production without giving thought to the rest of the world which might have enjoyed the film were they able to understand it!  I sent it back and was thoroughly digusted.,1380412800,,472,4.258426966292135

8249199,5,B00134VQQE,"IT'S ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT MOVIES ABOUT JP II' LIFE. MADE BY ITALIANS AND  POLISHES IN EUROPE, I RECOMMEND FOR ALL PEOPLE REALLY INTERESTED ABOUT KNOWING HIS LIFE AND HIS WAY TO GOD, INCLUDING GROWING UP IN FAITH.  THAT'S  ALL CAN I SAY. YOU WILL NOT REGRET.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Karol-2/dp/B00134VQQE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Karol 2</a>",1330300800,,398,6.615384615384615
8249200,5,B00134VQQE,"I saw this movie on EWTN, and I MUST have my own copy. The Polish actor who plays JPII does an incredible job! But beware, this is what I call a ""10 hankie"" movie. I think I cried on and off through the whole thing, but the ending had me positively weeping, and missing our beloved John Paul II even more. This movie is so beautifully done you believe you are looking at the real JPII. The woman who plays Blessed Mother Teresa could be her twin! I beg you, if you love JPII, don't miss this movie! It does proper homage to the man who had the single greatest influence for good during the entire 20th century. You will be glad you have this movie the day Pope John Paul the Great is named Venerable, then Blessed, then the SAINT that he truly is! May God make this time come soon. Servant of God, Pope John Paul the Great, pray for us.",1227657600,5,836,4.134969325153374
8249201,5,B00134VQQE,Excellent movie; lets us inside the Vatican to really get to know Pope Paul the Great.,1220745600,,86,4.4375
8249202,5,B00134VQQE,"This is one of the most remarkable movies I've ever seen! I remember Pope John Paul II very well - from when he was elected Oct. 16, 1978 to when he died April 2, 2005. I didn't always agree with him but most of the time I did and I certainly could see his sanctity. This movie helped me appreciate the man as well as the pope. I love our new pope, Benedict XVI, but I now have a greater appreciation of PJPII since seeing this remarkable movie.
This is the 2nd of a 2-part film about PJPII (I haven't seen the first part yet). It starts when Polish cardinal Karol Wojtyla was elected pope and ends when he died. It touches on such controversial things as AIDS in Africa, the war in Iraq, and the church's teachings on women's roles, homosexuality, abortion, artificial contraception, etc. but it doesn't DWELL on these issues. They're mentioned because they are part of the battles the church is fighting constantly.
 What makes this movie so compelling is the performance by Piotr Adamczyk, the actor who played the pope. He had the accent down and he seemed to understand fully the complex man PJPII was. The 2 saddest parts - the hardest parts to watch - were the assassination attempt May 13, 1981 and the final days of this beloved pope. My GOD how the man suffered. As many people have commented, ""PJPII taught us how to live and he taught us how  to die.""
 What also was so good was seeing the behind-the-scenes aspects of these 2 moments as well as other parts of this great pope's life. I urge everyone to see this movie and to buy it if you are able. Look at it over and over as I shall do on either EWTN or if and when I can get the DVDs. It's worth every single minute. This truly is a stunning production.",1217462400,10,1719,4.315789473684211
