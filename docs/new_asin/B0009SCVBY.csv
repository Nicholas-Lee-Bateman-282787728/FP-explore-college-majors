2317581,5,B0009SCVBY,"If you are looking for 3 episodes of good TV shows from the 1960's buy this Christmas DVD.  If you are familiar with the ""Hillbillies"" and ""Junction"", you'll love these Christmas episodes.  If you are not familiar with these 2 shows, buy it anyway for good family viewing.

  My overall comment----- Buy it, you'll like it.",1132358400,14,323,4.696428571428571

2317594,5,B0009SCVBY,"This was a gift for my Mom, who was looking for a Christmas movie.  I came across this dvd, and I thought it would be perfect for her.  She loved the old tv shows like The Beverly Hillbillies, and as a matter of fact so did I.  So, this was the best of both for her, she got a old movie and a Christmas movie all in one.  It's actually (3) movies on the dvd, one from Petticoat Junction and two from The Beverly Hillbillies.  She's been watching them, and has really enjoyed seeing the old shows again.  This was a great gift to her and I'm so glad I found it.  Thanks",1413849600,,568,3.9734513274336285

2317596,5,B0009SCVBY,Classic says it all. I recommend this to anyone interested in classic television. Iy has traditional comedy nothing over the top.,1389139200,,129,5.190476190476191

2317598,5,B0009SCVBY,"This is a really great collection, but please add Christmas in Hooterville to this great collection.  Christmas in Hooterville is my very favorite episode, and after purchasing this collection, I was very surprised to see that it was not included.  Please add Christmas in Hooterville to this collection or bring it out separately on dvd for us all to enjoy.  Christmas in Hooterville is currently only available on vhs, please bring out on dvd.  Thank you.",1380326400,,457,4.973684210526316
2317599,4,B0009SCVBY,I like this video.  I just wish we could get more Beverly Hillbillies Christmas - and everyday episodes.  I collect them.,1378252800,,121,4.714285714285714
2317600,5,B0009SCVBY,i rememeber seeing these as a child.i the 60's. i used to come home and watch bevely Hillbillies and Petticoat Junction.brings back my childhood to me.still funny even after all these years,1377129600,,189,4.9375
2317601,5,B0009SCVBY,I had forgotten how funny and down to earth these old shows were. It was great to relive a part of my youth watching these holidays  specials,1360713600,,141,4.222222222222222
2317612,5,B0009SCVBY,I bought this for my father for Father's Day and he of course liked it since he is a Beverly Hillbillies fan.  I find it said that I will only be able to purchase two more of these since they have produced only three seasons for sale.  Hopefully by the time I buy the third on there will be more seasons for sale.  Not everyone who watches the Beverly Hillbillies has Cable TV (and that is only when you can find a station running the program with parts edited out) and not everyone has a computer and internet to watch them on line.  Please produce more volumes of the Beverly Hillbillies and other shows.  I hate only finding a few seasons of any show.,1339977600,2,654,4.241935483870968
2317613,3,B0009SCVBY,"This an operation I don't like, to be compelled to pay extra money for Christmas episode that I should find in the series DVD-Box. No problem about video quality, very good. But why, tell me why I have to pay extra money for this?",1331337600,9,230,4.25
2317614,5,B0009SCVBY,"Great holiday fun to watch and reminisce about more simpler times. Innocence of the good old life revisited and what is important during the Christmas season- memories, love of family and friends, caring and sharing.",1326585600,,216,5.2
2317615,5,B0009SCVBY,"The Beverly Hillbillies/Petticoat Junction Ultimate Christmas Collection is the perfect companion set to Beverly Hillbillies Ultimate Collections Volumes 1 & 2. It has the first season Christmas episodes of both TV series and the second season Beverly Hillbillies Christmas episode. Both of these TV series were created by Paul Henning.

This three episode Christmas DVD has been digitally remastered from original episode negatives owned by the Paul Henning estate so the quality is not only superb, but far more superior than any public domain DVD offerings of these. It is also the only DVD set that is approved of and authorized by the estate of the late Paul Henning.

MPI Home Video yet again does a wonderful job on this DVD set. The episodes audio also sounds great and the episodes on this DVD look fresh, clean and new as the day that they were initially shown on the CBS TV network.

This set also has original cast sponsor commercials. It also has new episode introductions by Paul Henning's own daughter Linda Kaye Henning. The DVD also features holiday greetings by Frank Cady and Linda Kaye Henning. It also features a Christmas Surprise feature.

This DVD set has the stuff that all of those previous public domain issued DVD sets lacked and also missed. It is also well worth the price that you pay for it.

Once again, MPI Home Video does yet another wonderful job here on this set and it's predecessors Beverly Hillbillies Ultimate Collections Volumes 1 & 2. They are also shown in the order that the CBS TV network initially showed them, which is the first season Beverly Hillbillies holiday episode Home For Christmas and it's second season holiday episode Christmas with the Clampett's and last but not least, it shows the first season Petticoat Junction episode Cannonball Christmas. This and it's aforementioned predecessors are THE ones to own. Once you have this and it's aforementioned predecessors, you will never watch those public domain issued DVD sets again or you just might get rid of them once you have this and it's predecessors. It doesn't get any better than this.

This and Beverly Hillbillies Ultimate Collections Volumes 1 and 2 are THE ones to have and own. No true blue Beverly Hillbillies fan should be without this or it's aforementioned predecessors in their DVD library.",1326240000,9,2317,4.943444730077121
2317616,4,B0009SCVBY,"These early seasons of the Beverly Hillbillies and Petticoat Junction were great.  8 years later, it was a different story because the Hillbillies were still considered dumb and uneducated.

2317618,4,B0009SCVBY,"Oh what fun it is to ride on a first airplane ride with the Clampetts going home to the hills for Christmas!
Here are 2 Christmas episodes of the Beverly Hillbillies and one from its spin-off, Petticoat Junction. But wait!  There's more!! Also included are some vintage commercials that aired with the original broadcasts.  When was the last time you heard the now-way unPC jingle:
o/~ Winston tastes good like a "" "" cigarette should o/~
As Jed Clampett would say: WoooooooooooooDoggies!
It's down-home-spun fun in Hooterville and Beverly Hills for the Holidays. /TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer",1166486400,22,593,5.166666666666667

2317620,5,B0009SCVBY,"These two classic country comedy shows from the 60s are true time pieces of a simpler time. But they are also amusing and extremely charming slices of Americana. Since MPI has released the only authorized ""Petticoat"" and ""Hillbillies"" DVDs to date (see their ""Ultimate Collections"" for both shows), these are the only DVDs to feature the wonderful theme songs that introduce each series over the opening credits. Also, Linda Kaye Henning, daughter of creator-producer Paul Henning and co-star of ""Petticoat"" (as daughter Betty Jo Bradley) provides informative introductions to all 3 shows on this DVD plus does a sweet Christmas greeting with co-star Frank Cady (known as Hooterville General Store owner Sam Drucker). There's also some original cast commercials from both series, including a great Jethro recitation of ""The Night Before Christmas"" for Kellogg's Corn Flakes. This DVD is a real treat and a great buy. (P.S. There's also another bonus - a Christmas episode from Henning's earlier series from the late 50's -- ""The Bob Cummings Show/Love That Bob"" with Dwayne Hickman and Rosemary DeCamp.",1145145600,58,1102,5.267045454545454
