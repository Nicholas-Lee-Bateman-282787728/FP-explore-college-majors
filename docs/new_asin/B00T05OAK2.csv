8700081,1,B00T05OAK2,"This dvd will NOT play on American dvd players.  It might state ALL REGIONS, but this is not true.  I am stuck with a worthless dvd.",1499817600,,132,4.038461538461538
8700082,5,B00T05OAK2,"Captures the crazy 1960s in Britain as the youth culture was starting to blow the top off the stuffy, cultural Establishment. Sex is in the air in this free spirited and very funny coming of age movie with wonderful characters and great music by Traffic and Spencer Davis. Not crazy about the speeded-up hallucinogenic scenes which seem very dated, but there are only two or three. For the rest, just enjoy the ride - nothing heavy here but terrific fun.",1446422400,,454,4.6875
8700083,4,B00T05OAK2,"Really enjoyed revisiting the late 60s. Loved the clothes, the music and the storyline. Fun with a simple interesting message.",1388534400,3,126,5.35
