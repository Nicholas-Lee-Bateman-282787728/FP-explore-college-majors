We get to tag along with our ragtag band of adventurers, dreamers and hopefuls as they pick up new members from troubled backgrounds of child soldiers, prostitutes and living alone on there way to the promised game. There's a real medley of backgrounds and dreams among our quest group, it is fun to see them come together as a team on the journey which is a mere 3000 mile jaunt across Southern Africa and 7 or 8 countries which has much beautiful terrain to see. There is a lot of comic relief from misunderstandings and assumptions on their way. It's pretty family friendly though one should note there is some adult themes in here like condom use, VD's, child soldiers, etc. The fables of the perfect Soccer ball and match as told by young protagonist are some really cool claymation segments.",1484179200,,907,4.6397515527950315

8438764,5,B004R8N9BI,"I enjoyed watching this movie and i recommend it to anybody..... Dudu, the main character is so funny and always has something interesting to say. He HAS A goal and goes even beyond his own health to achieve it. This movie also brought me hope. It reminded me that no matter what you go through in life, there is someone on the other end of the world going through worst. Fabrice, the other character was kind of interesting too, the second character i enjoyed was Beatrice, she is a very smart pretty girl who wants to become a doctor. don't waste anymore time just get the movie",1354147200,,580,4.429906542056075
