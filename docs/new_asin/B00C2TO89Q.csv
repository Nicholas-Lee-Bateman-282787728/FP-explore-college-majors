8576740,5,B00C2TO89Q,"I think I have a newer version of this DVD that I purchased from Women's Health. The cover is red. It is a great workout, you can do all 5 or get the whole body in the 20 minute workout. The arm workout was one of the best I have done because the exercises are unique. There was also a hamstring exercise in the leg workout that I have never seen before. There is some cardio in the 20 minute workout. I think if I had to add anything it would maybe be a little more cardio but definitely a challenging workout. I just wish she had more DVDs!",1460332800,,542,3.981651376146789
8576741,5,B00C2TO89Q,"Happy to add to my rotation.  It has a full workout for all areas and then individual workouts for arms, legs, abs etc.  It's great",1412726400,,131,4.2
8576742,5,B00C2TO89Q,"The full-body section of the DVD is one of my favorite workouts.  I've been doing it for a while and still feel challenged just by changing the weights and adding the other sections.  I actually wish the abs section could be longer!  Holly Perkins does a great job explaining what each of the movements do and how to maintain proper form.  Some instructors gloss over that, which makes it hard to follow along.",1411171200,,410,4.575342465753424
8576743,4,B00C2TO89Q,Needed something that was low impact. To many injury's need something low impact with a punch! This is a great workout for that. Have seen results already.,1395446400,,155,4.777777777777778
8576744,5,B00C2TO89Q,"I am so in love with this video. It contains four different workouts so you can mix and match and get an ultimate personalized workout. I've been doing it for a couple months now and I still find the workouts challenging, but that great balance between hard enough and too hard to stay motivated to try. I really like Holly Perkins' workouts because they are incredibly effective but mindful about good form and avoiding injury. This is by far my favorite DVD workout to date.",1372464000,5,476,4.6117647058823525
