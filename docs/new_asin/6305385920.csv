1015231,4,6305385920,"The videos include edited-out sections in which the ladies visit various local food purveyors. These bits are charming and informative, and for me they greatly improved the series. From the television I assumed the ladies  were just dilitantes, hardly in the same leagues as Julia or perhaps  Jacques. But these restored sections show them to be quite serious and  knowledgeable about sourcing produce, fish and local delicacies.",955584000,36,429,5.373134328358209

7888356,5,6305385920,"I love watching the Two Fat Ladies.  I used to watch them many years ago, so it brings back good memories.  They are like old friends watching them laugh, cook, and sing together.  I really don't watch them for the recipes, although they are interesting recipes.  I just like their humor, the places they travel, the scenery, etc.  Since I purchased the set, I've watched all the shows twice.  They are fun!",1308009600,,407,4.583333333333333
7888357,5,6305385920,"After seeing this wonderful show on the Discovery Channel for the first time (thank you re-runs), we became instant fans of Jennifer and Clarissa, our two favorite gals.  Jennifer Paterson will be sadly missed for her comedic timing and singing, her huge spectacles and those painted nails and rings.
Finding this series on Amazon was a moment of great joy, and having bought and watched it, our joy increased exponentially.
From the opening song, to the last quiet reflections with some wine and a ciggy - this is truly a cooking show with a difference.  We don't even cook and we love it!
""Grab that crab Clarissa
Eat that meat Jennifer
Why doesn't that pheasant look pleasant
Fasten your seatbelts for a gastronimic ride""
Most menus include unusual foods - lots and lots of game, lard, bacon, butter, lemons, tomatoes and even eggplant - poor man's caviar, but they all look delicious anyway.  The high points are always the little stories between the cooking, with those accents rich enough to rival the cooking.
Merely watching this show has been known to cause weight gain.
Fatten your funny bone - highly recommended watching",1087862400,7,1132,4.885416666666667
7888358,5,6305385920,"These ladies are rare. They are excellent cooks that cook right from the land. No short cuts here. Their sense of humor is delightfull. I would have been honored to have met Jennifer Paterson. Her death was excedingly premature. The world is not for the better without her. The Fat Ladies are bright, well educated, humorous and can never be replaced. They brought alot of joy to my life by watching their shows. I learned alot about cooking and laughed till I hurt. Why they are off the TV I will never understand, and why more VHS and DVD are not avaliable......
They are the best.",1017446400,10,583,4.509433962264151
7888359,5,6305385920,"The Fat Ladies use copious adipose tissue ( that's lots o' lard, folks) in their cooking, without demanding applause for doing so, unlike a certain popular TV ""chef"". Great food, if perhaps not daily cuisine (there's a time and place for cream and butter sauces, and one for tofu salad).
Even my Irish mother would have loved them, British as they are. Alas for Jennifer Patterson, and I will miss them.",998092800,4,403,4.690140845070423
7888360,5,6305385920,"If you've never seen this series and love cooking, you owe it to yourself to get these tapes.
They were very unconventional, truly funny and had great receipts (Jennifer's insistence on the spelling of recipies).  The amounts of butter, lard and cream used in the show are quite enough to give one a coronary, but then again, their motto has always been to live life to the full.  Alas, Jennifer is no more (she died of lung cancer), so this series is a real gem.
I live in Australia and this series was a very big hit over here, where they were feted as celebrities.  In these days of political correctness and constant dieting, these two large ladies bring a much needed different viewpoint to cooking.
Last but not least, don't ever let the title ""Two Fat Ladies"" ever put you off.  They never hid the fact that they were built solidly.  In their own words, they said that they had absolutely no problem with fat, but were a little miffed that the word ""ladies"" made them sound like a public convenience!",978134400,17,1007,4.510989010989011
7888361,5,6305385920,"I started watching these two adorable creatures on PBS.  I bought the set, and can't wait to get my hands on more.  Come on, people, The Two Fat Ladies were on for six years.  Surely you can compile more shows than just these 13 episodes.  Jennifer is gone and there will never be any more.  Put more episodes out for purchase.  I've actually tried some of the recipies, and they  work.  They are not fancy complicated things, and there is room for mistakes, your own creativity or whatever, and Jennifer's and Clarissa's adventures just make for great entertainment.",975888000,,567,4.714285714285714
7888362,5,6305385920,"You want a cooking series that's a bit different?  This is it.  I bought the 4-tape series about a year ago.  Now I anxiously await the release of further videos in the PBS series.  Jennifer and Clarissa are wonderful!  The best part is they mix wit with cooking history - and demonstrate it in a fashion thats not available in other videos I have seen.  You owe it to yourself to get this boxed set.
Your mouth will drewel as they prepare dishes in front of your eyes.  There is NO annoying music, or fast moving clips that make your eyes blur.  Get it, and get it now.  I guarantee you will not be disappointed!",972172800,7,613,4.260869565217392
