8636059,3,B00HUTPJZA,"In an ancient Roman site, researchers find a burial situation which has 1000s of bodies from 1,500 years ago.  They try to find out who these people are and why they were buried en masse.
To a small extent, this will make you appreciate being alive in the 21st century AD.  The interviewees stated that ancient Romans knew little about curing illnesses.  Thus, sick people went to the bathes and mingled with the healthy.  There was no sewage, so excrement and filth was just thrown on the streets.  Tuberculosis, leprosy, and other fatal illnesses were rampant.  They mention that a certain scourge easily killed 1/10 of the population.  Then again, if the ancients heard about global warming, acid rain, HIV/AIDS, rising rates of autism, then they would possibly be scared of the present.
The British narrator pronounces the last syllable of catacombs with a long U, rather than a long O.  If ""catacoooooombs"" sounds funny to you, then you will be tickled to distraction here.  From what I heard, every nation now has its own anthropologists.  Thus, I was a bit surprised that there were few Italian interviewees here and most of the researchers seemed to be French.
The burial site includes men and women.  It has coins from 100 to the 300s.  They could tell the bodies weren't of Roman natives, but of Roman denizens.  I wonder if the viewers who loved Russell Crowes' ""Gladiator"" would love or be scared by this non-fictional discussion.
Here's my big problem: they state outright who the corpses are in the last seven or so minutes of the program.  I really think they knew who these bodies were from jump.  Thus, to an extent, the work strings the viewer along.  Instead of just speaking of these people and speaking in detail about their role in ancient Roman society, the work meanders.  This could have been a 20-minute discussion that the makers stretch into a 50-minute one.  Nevertheless, any European History teacher should feel comfortable showing this to her or his students earlier in their courses.",1393113600,3,2016,4.845029239766082
