1946768,5,B0000USUO8,This is the absolute nearest I have come to finding a real ballet class on video.  It has a wonderful warm up followed by floor exercises and center work. If you are studying Ballet this is great at home practice refresher.  If you are taking a Ballet class and thinking of buying one tape or dvd buy Ballet Bootcamp 2!,1123459200,9,319,4.3
1946769,4,B0000USUO8,"I enjoy this dvd when I want to do some toning and some ballet dance. The toning is well done, and the ballet dance is fun, though it takes a few times to get the routine. It's a nice challenge. Teacher's explanations and personality are enjoyable.",1356220800,,248,4.413043478260869
1946770,4,B0000USUO8,"I haven't gotten to work too much with this video yet, but Amazon is bugging me to review. It's a little harder than I had anticipated but once I get the combos and routines, it'll be fine. The workout is fun, but I was hoping for basically a difficult class structure that I could do at home.",1351209600,,293,4.157894736842105
1946771,4,B0000USUO8,"I really like this video.  It's a nice mix of ballet and exercise.  The last section contains a choreographed routine to the music of ""Paquita"" which is one of my favorites!  However, this is not for someone with no dance experience.  Choreography is very fast and it helps if you know the moves.  It could be a little harmful if you're trying to fly through the moves without proper techniques or body alignment.  At one point, even the instructor is laughing because it's so fast.  It would have been nice to slow down the music a bit, or to mark it to half-time.

Overall, fun way to get into shape.  Definitely helps to have some dance background!",1349827200,5,651,4.495726495726496
1946772,5,B0000USUO8,"Very challenging.  Won't stop using it until I master each and every step of it, and that's going to be a ""minute"".  Great instruction!",1327104000,,135,4.583333333333333
1946773,5,B0000USUO8,"I just recently bought this DVD. I needed something to pair with stretching on the days that I don't have dance to keep my body up and running. I'm a dancer and I found this to be a great workout, and by the end you can really feel that all of your muscle groups have been worked. Great for dancers, but I could easily see a non-dancer being able to follow along for the most part with no problems! Can't wait to incorporate this into my weekly routine.

Everything is well explained, and everything moves at a good pace!",1312848000,2,521,4.262626262626263
1946774,5,B0000USUO8,"I usually am not very good at committing to any sort of fitness regimen, but I am hooked on this dvd. I also have the New York City Ballet 1 and 2, but I feel that this gives you a better work out in terms of getting that dancer's body.",1302048000,3,236,3.74
1946775,4,B0000USUO8,"Pros:  Lovable instructor, enjoyable music, largely obtainable motions for the beginner, and NO BULKY MUSCLES!  I am so sick of discotheque boomchickaboomchicka music and 10 pound weights as the new standard for female fitness.  This DVD has enough material to merit two workouts.

Cons:  The final choreography at the end is taught with the instructor facing forward, i felt that if she faced the back it might be easier to follow. The transition between ""phrases"" of dance included some pretty quick foot movements.  The direction changes are pretty hard when one's ""studio"" is a limited space like a bedroom, if you live in an apartment the choreography portion could pose more than a few challenges.",1297814400,5,703,5.069565217391304
1946776,4,B0000USUO8,"I prefer the Ballet Boot Camp I but this is a good alternative if you need a change in your routine.
I prefer it to the N.Y city Ballet workout that's by far a better production but doesn't cover as many muscles as this video. Jessica relies a lot on variety and repetitions &, as everyone knows, repetitions work!
The break & explanations between moves are a little too long for me but I just FF.
It's a great workout for anyone, regardless age, sex or background (I'm recovering from 2 sress fractures)",1274227200,3,504,4.43010752688172
1946777,3,B0000USUO8,"I have no previous ballet experience and was looking for an interesting way to improve flexibility and muscle tone and see if ballet held any interest for me.  This struck me as something that would be great for those getting back into ballet.  For me, the routines just seemed rather long and involved.  Also, not being that skilled, it is easier for me to learn complex dance moves if I can watch the instructor from behind and see their front in the mirror (which I have never yet seen in a dance workout dvd.) There was nothing really interesting about the stretches so I did not really get what I was looking for.  Having said that, I like the instructor so I tried the Ballet Boot Camp Stretch and got exactly what I was looking for!",1263427200,8,739,4.411764705882353
1946778,5,B0000USUO8,"I really enjoyed this DVD workout!  It's definitely helping me get back into shape after having my second baby 2 months ago.  The instructor genuinely seems to enjoy leading the class.  This would be dificult for someone who had never studied ballet, but for ex-dancers with experience, this is a great product!",1243555200,,311,4.9423076923076925
1946779,5,B0000USUO8,"This DVD is the best i own that really resembles a ballet class, it runs for about 1 hour and 40 minutes if you do the entire workout.
The explanation is excellent, the music is excellent, the only thing i would change about it is offering a version without the initial explanation of every exercise, after you do this dvd a couple of times you could easily skip this part.
This and the NYC Workout Vol2. deliver excellent results in the entire body.",1207353600,5,450,4.433734939759036
1946780,5,B0000USUO8,"I like this video for the workout.  You are not going to become a ballerina by doing the workout.  If you want to learn classical ballet, take a class.  This is a traditional workout video.  The majority of the workout involves doing floor exercises were you are going to work your abs, arms, back and legs.  These are exercises that a dancer would do to maintain his or her body.  Yes, there is a section in the beginning were you warm-up doing some ballet moves, and another section at the end were you can practice some more ballet moves.  I usually bypass the latter. I would recommend this video.  The video was filmed in a dance class, so don't expect a lavish production.  The  participants also appear to be students, of all ages, who are actually taking a ballet course from the instructor.",1171065600,17,799,4.524475524475524
1946781,5,B0000USUO8,"I am a casual ballet dancer who does not regulary attend class.

I have found this video a to be a great in-between workout.

I think that it is great to maintain flexibility and strength. I really needed something that was NOT high impact aeorbics  -- and this is definitely it. I always feel great after using this video, not tired, sweaty, and completely worn out. I would recommend this to anyone looking to tone up.",1168819200,12,420,4.5
1946782,4,B0000USUO8,This DVD is a good workout.  It is a basic background and very plain and simple. Don't let that stop you from trying it.  The exercises are effective and you will gain strength in your legs and core.  You will begin to sculpt your legs and arms.  I keep it in my rotation and I have many many dance and aerobic DVDs.  I would recommend it if you are interested in learning dance or practicing between classes.,1159056000,15,409,4.259740259740259
1946783,1,B0000USUO8,"Having taken ballet classes for eight years, I was not at all impressed by this DVD.  The production quality is poor, there is very little barre work and the instruction is brief.  Much of the DVD is in fact movements which aren't related to ballet.  I attempted to follow this DVD one time and gave up - the instructor is awful.  Save your money and don't buy this.",1153440000,17,366,4.338235294117647
1946784,5,B0000USUO8,"Given the great reviews of this so far, it's hard to imagine that these don't do this DVD justice.  Jessica Sherwood is effortlessly elegant in her movement and she is clear in her instruction.  She's also lovely- not too enthusiastic nor too rigid- just very natural and engaging.  This DVD in its entirety feels like a ballet class and a very unpretentious class at that.  There are very good exercises and basic ballet, so it's enjoyable and gives a thorough conditioning for the entire body.  As a basis for comparison, I think Ballet Boot Camp 2 is more thorough and contains more ballet than NYC Ballet II (I really like this DVD too but it feels more like isolated movements instead of ballet).  I also prefer the choreography and appreciate the better instruction and inclusion of the arms in Ballet Boot Camp 2 which I was not so impressed with in NYC Ballet II.",1151280000,39,871,4.623376623376624
1946785,5,B0000USUO8,"This is the best ballet workout ever!  I also love the first Ballet Boot Camp.  I have tried NYC Ballet workouts 1 & 2, Balletone and Center Moves, all of Stephanie Herman's DVDs, Bar Method, Cardio Barre, Melissa Lowe's three ballet DVDs, and other various ballet inspired videos and DVDs.  This outdoes them all.  It definitely is worth ever penny.  I have lost 215 pounds and reshaped my bod with this.  I give it a thousand stars.",1147132800,73,434,4.571428571428571
1946786,5,B0000USUO8,I just did this workout yesterday.  I loved it.  She works every part of your body.  I haven't had this much fun with a workout in awhile.  Plus it makes you feel graceful.  I imagine sticking to this will yield great results.  Definitely buy it!!!,1146700800,6,248,4.4
1946787,5,B0000USUO8,Wonderful for people with prior ballet classes.  Probably not for the beginner unless you are really interested in learning ballet moves.,1142812800,12,137,5.523809523809524
1946788,5,B0000USUO8,"Love this one!!!!! Well, as much as one can love a workout DVD. I surely own enough of them, mostly collecting dust.  I actually use this DVD when I cant get to class.

I have about 30 years of ballet class experience and am still able to find a challenge each time while enjoying myself.  My daughter, who doesn't take ballet, bought this DVD for herself, and loves it.. (she made an attempt to swipe mine...)",1125187200,38,410,4.368421052631579

8003159,4,B0000USUO8,"The DVD editing is unorganized and cheaply made.  But great workout if a beginner, using as a another choice for a workout, or refresher.",1425427200,,137,4.708333333333333
8003160,5,B0000USUO8,"Great workout, as a former ballet dancer it is perfect workout for me as I always loved ballet class. Definitely works every part of your body , and is great for stretching.  Done regularly will definitely keep you ""on your Toes"".",1417219200,2,230,4.609756097560975

8003162,5,B0000USUO8,"I am absolutely in love with Jessica Sherwood's Ballet Boot Camp 1, Ballet Boot Camp 2, and Stretch videos.  I take an adult ballet class and these videos have improved my technique and strength.  I have used other great videos, but have found hers to be the best.  I would rate these video beyond 5 stars.  She has such passion for what she does and you can see that she and her students are having so much fun.  I just hope she continues putting out future videos.  Love you, Jessica",1414022400,2,485,4.333333333333333
8003163,4,B0000USUO8,"I have the NY Ballet workouts and love them.  This is a completely different style/format.  It's a studio of healthy adults following her rather rapid ballet instructions....much faster paced than NY vid.  Because she is moving at a much faster pace, it does feel like there are more exercises included, if you're counting, and she does more repetitions.  Is that better?  I guess it depends on your preference.  I like the slower, deliberate pacing of NY which focuses on getting very precise with your body.  It's easier, in a way, more Zen.  The Boot Camp is great if you want something with more energy and a more peppy feel.  The extra routines at the end are long and involved, so if you're interested in adding to the workout, there's more there.  On balance a very good workout.",1399420800,,786,4.671532846715328
8003164,5,B0000USUO8,"This is a great workout. For years, I've been doing yoga, piles, P90x, and anything I can get my hands on that is on DVD to mix things up and stay fit.

I found this challenging for a few reasons - one, it's a long workout, and two, I've never really done ballet before (pre-school doesn't count, no matter what my mother says).  I don't know what the positions are called, but that's okay, over time I'm sure I'll figure it all out.  It doesn't hurt that I have a full-length mirror in my gym so that I can check my form. I have never done balancs before, so I had to rewind that a few times and try, try, try again until I got it right.  I didn't even try the phrasing at the end.

I figure I'll just try to do a little more each time I put this DVD in. This one is fun because not only is doing everything a challenge, it moves at a pretty fast clip. I figure if I do my best and improve a little more each time and get a little farther each time, eventually I'll have learned something really neat.

If I get too stuck, apparently Ballet Bootcamp 1 is a little less intense :).

All in all, it was a lot of fun and nice to have in my workout repertoire.",1373760000,,1157,3.961206896551724
8003165,3,B0000USUO8,"This dvd is in the middle of my ""exercise deck""
I like the instructor, but given a choice between nyc ballet and this dvd, nyc ballet wins out every time.
For me it's a matter of ""Am I going to stick with this exercise video?""
I pull it out every once in a while.  Not crazy over her stomach exercises.  She does the old method of hurling yourself straight up from a prone position, which for me uses 80 percent back muscles, and 20 percent abs.",1373587200,,445,4.162790697674419
8003166,5,B0000USUO8,"I own her 3 dvd's and I really love this one! It's not a real ballet class, as you don't do barre exercises, but it's more a ballet workout, on classical music.

Ballet Boot Camp 2 is much better than her previous dvd Ballet Boot Camp: on the first one, the camera work is bad. Sometimes the camera zooms on the dancers' faces or legs, so you can't see very well what they are doing. I find it really disturbing.

Ballet Boot Camp 2 is a total body workout. You don't need to have any ballet experience. There are no barre exercises, except the Center Barre part (you are doing standing exercises, without using a barre). These exercises might be a little bit complicated a first if you never did any ballet before. But after doing this dvd a couple of times, you should be able to do them.

At the end you will learn a choreography. Even if this part is too difficult for you, you will still enjoy the rest of the dvd, and it's still a good buy. With this workout, you will work on your flexibility and strength... and it will make you feel like a ballerina!  :-)

Her Ballet Boot Camp stretch is also excellent. It's shorter than the other 2 dvd's and in that one, you will learn how to do the splits.",1368835200,2,1203,4.235807860262009
8003167,5,B0000USUO8,"I would definitely recommend this product, as I found it easy to follow and not at all boring. Maybe a bit on the long side for people who haven't got too much 'time' on their hands, but overall I found it a great workout.",1357084800,,222,4.068181818181818
