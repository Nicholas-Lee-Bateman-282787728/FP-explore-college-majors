8625556,5,B0012N73CW,"Markula is a director who loves bad movies. By bad, i mean ""bad in a good way"".BAD has become a style-Ed Wood, Andy Milligan, William Girdler...the list of great ""bad"" directors never ends! If one senses a love for the horror genre in Markula,that person would be correct-Only that by horror we are talking the old b&w kind. But also John Waters movies! Acid-toungued humour that seems funniest late at night with a group of partying friends.
The psychological themes of loss and abandonment are explored;as are homocide, paranoia, and split-personalities. THESE ARE HOME-MADE MOVIES that offer no apology at any crazy turn!",1209427200,,624,5.067961165048544
