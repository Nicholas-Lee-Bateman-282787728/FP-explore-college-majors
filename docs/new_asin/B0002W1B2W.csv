8161788,5,B0002W1B2W,"This DVD is clubbing world style!(No Eric Clapton. Cream is nightclubs on this it's graphic montage video to techno-House-trance music! Some old band does not own the word Cream For all purposes, their is nothing deceptive about the title.) Cool Graphics and music! Very adult content to me, the way I'm seeing it. You would probably want to buy some DVDs to go with this. Here is a list: Perry Rhodan Space Night 40th Anniversary, Gartel - Trance Dance and Other Living Things, Ministry Of Sound The Annual 2003, Liquid Moods (do an A9 search for this one and some

others), All of the Mixmaster DVD's especially Happy To Be Hardcore, Son Kite Live in Tokyo,  Male or Female, More Ibiza Nights  (you might like Afterlife which is similar to more Ibiza Nights,

The Trance collection, Spotworks, Paul Oakenfold - A Voyage Into

Trance, Tranquil Moods, Caribou - Marino, Relaxation Lounge,

Geospirit 1 - Virtual Vortex, Syncrosect, Illuminated Chakras,

The First Trance Opera Of The World, All of the X mix DVD's,

Flowmotion 1, 2 and 3 also the DVD 3 Lux. Pick up some Cafe Del Mar Cd's to chill

out because it's all about mood... Don't do anything Jesus won't let you do!",1140048000,2,1175,4.692682926829268
