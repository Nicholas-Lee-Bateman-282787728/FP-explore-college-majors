7906897,5,B00000F57T,"No camera tricks, no safety helicopters, no posh hotels to overnight in, and no hyped-up-buildup without delivering (I'm talking about you Grand Inga Project). Iceland River Challend is from an era when Explorers were really putting it all on the line. Rappel down into an ice cave  then kayak out! Unreal!

This video belongs on the canon of classic exploration. There are no rivers like the Jokulsa, where razor sharp volcanic rocks await the kayaker who flips in a massive hole.

My only complaints are that I wish it was on DVD and I wish it was longer.",1378166400,,557,4.663265306122449
7906898,3,B00000F57T,"I bought this video for two reasons: I love Iceland and thought it would have some great footage of Icelandic beauty; and it was cheap. There is some beautiful scenery in the video, but overall, it was not up to the normal standards set by National Geographic. The concept here is that some intrepid explorers attempt to kayak and raft down a completely unexplored whitewater river in Iceland. On the impassable parts of the journey they use ultra-light aircraft with the kayaks strapped to them to transit the regions (mostly waterfalls are to blame here.) Now I realize that I am being picky and taking the conservative stance here, but I really question the risk/reward relationship for this particular journey. Yes, they can say they were the first to kayak down (and fly over) this particular river, but I came away from the video thinking that if someone had been killed (and that was very easy to envision) it would have been a total waste given what was actually accomplished: after all, they didn't go to the moon here.

The video was released in 1995, but the documentary was made in 1983, so it is a pretty old adventure now. It isn't a bad video, it is just somewhat repetitive. The scenery though...well, that's just plain beautiful.",1095465600,,1246,4.741935483870968
