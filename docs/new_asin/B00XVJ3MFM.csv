8716781,4,B00XVJ3MFM,On some levels liked it better than Gabrielle Roth's ecstatic dance DVDs and the price was more reasonable. It is enjoyable but at the same time wasn't quite right for me. Some how the integration of the dance with the chakras didn't quite mesh but just for some dancey fun why not.,1515801600,,282,4.4423076923076925
8716782,5,B00XVJ3MFM,"This DVD is very well done, and helped me let go and just dance.  Beautifully joyful!",1486684800,,85,4.3125
8716783,3,B00XVJ3MFM,"The production quality is decent, the music is good, and it is a visually appealing video. That said, this isn't really any more than typical ecstatic dance... trying to specialize by commandeering the chakras. Whatever. Not a complete waste of money but I would not buy again. Also, it won't play in my dvd player, only my pc, which is annoying.",1472428800,,346,4.688524590163935
