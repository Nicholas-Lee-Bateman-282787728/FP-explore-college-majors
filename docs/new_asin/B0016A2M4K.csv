8261843,4,B0016A2M4K,The movie was shown to a prolife group. Enjoyed the history given and details of his life. Great scenery. Even called St. Lucy for the handkerchief and novena with card and medal of St. Gerard Majella. Would suggest this movie for expectant mothers.,1378339200,,249,4.813953488372093
8261844,1,B0016A2M4K,"This film is more of a documentary than anything.  Many of the scenes are just artwork, and not classic artwork at that.  There are a few actual photographs of some towns and churches in Italy, but for the most part you are just watching various people talking about St. Gerard.
I found many of the examples of this saint's miracles to be suspiciously legendary, but maybe that's just me.

Frankly, I could not stay awake to finish this film.  Neither could my husband.",1376006400,,469,4.614457831325301
