8009580,4,B0001BKABC,"This collection of classic low budget B-movie gore is a real flash from the past, they just don't make them like this anymore.  These are the 3rd or forth run movies that I used to watch at the Saturday Night Horror Movie fests at our local Drive-Inns.  The quality of video transfer isn't the greatest, but you've got to consider that the film source must have not been kept in the most ideal of storage conditions in the Philippines for twenty or thirty years, but I think of movies from the golden age of the Drive-Inn Theatres like most guys my age think of 60s muscle cars, all of them no matter what kind or type should be restored and preserved.",1238544000,,652,4.380165289256198
8009581,5,B0001BKABC,"For those of us who are B movie aficionados, these films have the perfect combination of horror, blood, gore, and bare-breasted women. Anyone who watches films like this knows at the outset you aren't going to get Academy Award winning material, and these films do not disappoint in that regard.  So ---- call the pizza delivery guy, crack open a beer, plunk yourself down on the couch, and enjoy!",1233273600,3,397,4.753623188405797

Producer/Distributor extraordinaire Sam Sherman and Image Entertainment have teamed up to present The Blood Island Vacation package, an awesoma DVD set of four Filipino produced, hemoglobin drenched, drive-in classics at one heck of a nice price...here's what you get...

Brides of Blood (1968)

Directed by Eddie Romero (Mad Doctor of Blood Island, Beast of the Yellow Night), Brides of Blood (1968) and featuring Kent Taylor (The Day Mars Invaded Earth, The Mighty Gorga, Hell's Bloody Devils), former stripper Beverly Hills aka Beverly Powers (Kissin' Cousins, Invasion of the Bee Girls), and John Ashley (Muscle Beach Party, The Eye Creatures, Beast of Blood), the film involves various, mutated creatures terrorizing natives on a place called Blood Island.  Extras included are as follows; a short audio commentary track featuring distributor Sam Sherman, an interview with director Eddie Romero, an original Brides of Blood wedding ring giveaway promo, a ""House of Terror"" live horror show promo, a Beverly Hills pinup gallery, a Blood Island image gallery, liner notes by Jim Arena, a Brides of Blood essay by Christopher William Koenig, and a trailer for this film, along with ones for Mad Doctor of Blood Island (1968), Beast of Blood (1971), Brain of Blood (1972), Blood of the Vampires (1971), The Blood Drinkers (1966), and Raiders of the Living Dead (1986).

Mad Doctor of Blood Island (1968)

Produced and directed by Eddie Romero (Brides of Blood, Beast of the Yellow Night, Beast of Blood), the film stars John Ashley (High School Caesar, Beach Blanket Bingo, Beast of Blood) and Angelique Pettyjohn (""Get Smart"", Clambake).  Ashley plays a scientist (not the same one from Brides of Blood), who visits Blood Island and finds himself caught up in some nasty business as a deranged scientist on the island is performing hideous experiments involving green blood.  Extras include a short audio commentary track featuring distributor Sam Sherman, an interview with director Eddie Romero, an original Mad Doctor of Blood Island `green blood' prologue bit, a ""House of Terror"" live horror show promo, a still gallery, liner notes by Jim Arena, a Mad Doctor of Blood Island essay by Christopher William Koenig, and a trailer for this film, along with ones for Brides of Blood (1968), Beast of Blood (1971), Brain of Blood (1972), Blood of the Vampires (1971), The Blood Drinkers (1966), and Raiders of the Living Dead (1986).

Beast of Blood (1972)

Produced, co-written, and directed by Eddie Romero (Mad Doctor of Blood Island, Brides of Blood, Beast of the Yellow Night), the film features John Ashley (High School Caesar, Muscle Beach Party, Hell On Wheels) and Celeste Yarnall (The Face of Eve, The Velvet Vampire).  Ashley reprises his role from Mad Doctor of Blood Island returning to the island to discover the evil that had thought been destroyed is still thriving.  Extras included are as follows; a short audio commentary track featuring distributor Sam Sherman, an interview with director Eddie Romero, an interview w/ Celeste Yarnell conducted by Sam Sherman, a `lost' opening sequence, a ""House of Terror"" live horror show promo, a still gallery, liner notes by Jim Arena, a Beast of Blood essay by Christopher William Koenig, and a trailer for this film, along with ones for Brides of Blood (1968), Mad Doctor of Blood Island (1968), Brain of Blood (1972), Blood of the Vampires (1971), The Blood Drinkers (1966), Raiders of the Living Dead (1986), and Horror of the Blood Monster (1970).

Brain of Blood (1972)

Co-produced and directed by Al Adamson, the film features Kent Taylor (Brides of Blood, Satan's Sadists), Grant Williams (The Incredible Shrinking Man, The Monolith Monsters), the colossal (7'4"") John Bloom (Dracula vs. Frankenstein, Bachelor Party), Regina Carrol (Blood of Ghastly Horror, Doctor Dracula), Vicki Volante (Hell's Bloody Devils, Horror of the Blood Monsters), Reed Hadley (The St. Valentine's Day Massacre), and the diminutive (2'11) Angelo Rossitto (Mesa of Lost Women, Invasion of the Saucer Men, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome), this feature has nothing in terms of relation to the three other films in this set other than the fact they were all distributed by Sam Sherman through his Independent-International Pictures, Inc. film company.  This film involves a sickly Middle Eastern dictator arranging to have his brain transplanted to another body, and a certain amount of wackiness ensues... extras included are as follows; a short audio commentary track featuring distributor Sam Sherman, an interview with director Eddie Romero, an interview with Beverly Powers, a ""House of Terror"" live horror show promo, a Blood Island still gallery, liner notes by Jim Arena, and a trailer for this film, along with ones for Brides of Blood (1968), Mad Doctor of Blood Island (1968), Beast of Blood (1971), Blood of the Vampires (1971), The Blood Drinkers (1966), Raiders of the Living Dead (1986), and Horror of the Blood Monster (1970).

As far as the picture quality on the four DVDs, they're all in full screen (1.33:1) aspect ratio and all look very decent.  There are some obvious age elements (white specking, the occasional vertical line), but the colors are bright and sharp, and the overall quality is superior to any VHS copies of the films you may seen in the past.  Also, each has audio presented in Dolby Digital mono audio, which also comes through well.  As far as the actual films go, I'd rank Brides of Blood and Mad Doctor of Blood Island among the best here, with Beast of Blood following a close 2nd, while Brain of Blood comes in a very distant 3rd.  One last note, distributor Sam Sherman does provide audio commentaries on each of the DVDs, but they're not so much specific to the film rather than to an overall history of the films and his experiences, and they don't tend to run the length of the films.
