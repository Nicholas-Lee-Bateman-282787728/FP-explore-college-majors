905827,5,6304675348,"I LOVE this movie and could go on about it forever but don't worry I won't. When this first came out I din't think it would be all that hot, and also I wasn't a big fan of horror films apart from Halloween but I was  eventually persuaded by my friends. And I'm happy they did I love this  film. The plot is quite simple. It starts off with Casey Becker (Drew  Barrymore) being horribly killed. We then go straight to the aftermath. At  the school she went to the press are having a field day and Sidney Prescott  (Neve Campbell) is having to deal with this and it also being the year  long anniversary of her mother's murder. Then the murders start up again,  first with the high school headteacher, then Sidney's best friend Tatum  (Rose McKowan) A tfirst Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich) is suspected but he is  then released. Itr's then a free for all with everyone suspecting everyone  else. I won't give away who does it but I must say I was suprised. Neve  Campbell is fantastic as tortured Sidney, Skeet Ulrich is great as the  suspicious boyfriend Billy, Courteney Cox is excellent as the bitchy  journilist Gale Weathers (in a refreshing break away from Friends) Jamie  Kennedy is cool as the film-buff Randy and David Arquette is sweet as the  quirky nerdy Deputy Duey. This is a great film, but the first 10 minutes  where Drew Barrymore is killed is of course the most thrilling and scary.  This is a great film. If you haven't seen it yet where have you been the  last 2 years? Get your head out of the sand and rent it now!",912124800,,1532,4.391459074733096

905829,5,6304675348,"Halloween, Psycho, The Exorsict, A Nightmare on Elm Street, The Shinning,  Night of the Living Dead, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  Scream lives up  to all of these classics.  Neve Campbell (the best looking woman in the  world) in the role that made her a star on the big screen.  It's full of  suspence and a whole lot of hummor.  Get this soon to be classic right  away.  After that, make sure you check out it's sequel that is just a good  as the original.

906731,5,6304675348,"A Wes Craven Masterpiece! It was 1996 and the horror genre was literally DEAD. Oh sure, horror movies were still being made but most of them lacked any real creative writing instead focusing on rehashing the same old formula over and over (with the exception of Wes Cravens New Nightmare which did  break new  ground). Only the very best of them were (Wes Cravens New Nightmare, In The Mouth Of Madness, Silence of The Lambs, Seven) were lucky enough to break even or do really well in the box office.  Certainly the sub-genre of slasher movies were scraping the bottom of the barrel at this time  in film history. Thus sets the stage for December 1996 and the previous high points for Dimension Films were The Crow and Halloween: The Curse Of Michael Myers. The 4-year-old studio is still looking for their crown jewel project that would put them on the map as legitimate contender among the big boys.

At this same time an unknown but determined writer named Kevin Williamson has locked himself into a hotel room for 3 weeks determined to not go home until he completes the writing of a screenplay for his newest story which he is simply calling Scary Movie. To make a long story short, he completes writing the screenplay and begins to shop it around to film studios. The Weinstein brothers at Dimension films love it, they sign Kevin Williamson to write the film and after initially being turned down by Wes Craven, Wes gave it a second chance and agreed to come aboard to direct the film whose name was later changed to Scream.

Wes Craven has an incredible legacy in the horror genre that shaped and re-shaped the entire genre over the course of 40 years of his films. He revolutionized the genre in the 80s with A Nightmare On Elm Street and now over ten years later he was about to do it once again with the Scream franchise. Scream is a genuine masterpiece because it not only contains all of the elements needed for a fulfilling horror movie, it goes one step further and introduces new ideas while being done with a keen sense of self-awareness throughout the movie that had never been done before in the genre. Wes Cravens New Nightmare started to explore this idea of self-awareness of the actors within the movie but in Scream he took it to the next level. We see the now famous Rules To Survive A Horror Movie as perfectly explained by one of my favorite Scream characters Randy. Moreover, this thread of self-awareness runs throughout the picture from multiple characters but never done in an over the top manner where it does not work within the context of the moment.

It is the story of a small town where people are being brutally murdered and the killers attention begins to focus on the lead character Sydney Prescott and as the film unfolds there is revealed a much larger back-story that is under girding all of the events which are happening. No one can create tension and suspense in a scene better than Wes Craven and he is arguably the star of this film because of how brilliantly he tells the story visually from behind the cameras. Scream delivers at all the important angles and keeps you guessing as well as jumping throughout! The ending is fantastic and very original!!

I am a STICKLER for not giving spoilers and even though this film is now TWENTY years old I will still not reveal anything more specific about the film other than to say, this is a MUST watch film for anyone who enjoys a top-shelf murder mystery, suspenseful thriller and slasher horror. Wes Cravens direction and tone for the film is nothing less than SUPERB and combined with brilliant writing this is an instant classic and is no surprise to this fan/viewer that it turned the entire horror genre upside down upon its release. Horror movies are not supposed to make hundreds of millions of dollars in the box office but Scream and its sequels have done just that. It is NO accident!!

This is the film that sparked a myriad of copy-cat films in the late 90s and early 2000s who were desperately trying to reach the success of the Scream franchise but all of these far more inferior films failed miserably to do so.

Finally, if you have never seen Scream and perhaps you're not a fan of the horror genre please hear me out, you owe it to yourself to watch this film at least once! Twenty years later it still stands up tall and towering over the genre. Sadly, Wes Craven passed away in August of 2015 but thankfully he was able to see the incredible fingerprint he left on the film industry which he helped shape since the 1970s. I can only imagine what new projects he would be working on right now which upon completion would once again revolutionize the genre. Rest In Peace Wes Craven and thank you for over forty years of SCREAMS!!!!",1472428800,6,4746,4.5729411764705885

907231,3,6304675348,"Released in 1996, Wes Craven's ""Scream"" chronicles the murders of various people linked to a high school in a California town by someone dressed in a ghost-face Halloween costume. Neve Campbell plays the protagonist, Rose McGowan her best friend, Skeet Ulrich her boyfriend, Matthew Lillard his best friend, David Arquette the deputy, Courteney Cox an annoying reporter, Joseph Whipp the sheriff and Jamie Kennedy a dude that works at a video store.

People keep hailing ""Scream"" as some kind of stand-out slasher flick, but it's not IMHO. It tries to walk the balance beam between serious slasher and amusing parody, which creates an odd vibe throughout. At no time was I able to buy what was going on as reality. The camp and contrivances kept screaming ""This is all a joke,"" like Henry Winkler's weird principal. As such, the movie's never scary despite some shocking elements and gore.

Another negative is the host of unlikable, obnoxious or annoying characters. Campbell is serviceable as the heroine and McGowan is awesome just because she's so alluring. Drew Barrymore is also good, but her presence is limited to a glorified cameo in the prologue. I realize that the rest of the characters are so distasteful because this is a whodunit and most of them are potential suspects, but this doesn't take away from the fact that they make for an unpleasant viewing experience. Before you say, ""But this is a horror flick and therefore it's supposed to be unpleasant,"" I get that; I'm talking about how most of the main characters are so repugnant it's impossible to care about them. Let 'em all get slashed to death for all I care, lol. Then there's the ridiculously over-the-top last act, which is so contrived, cartoony and drenched in fake blood you'll just roll your eyes in disbelief. All this is compounded by the clumsy and weak killer, which I suppose makes sense when you later discover who the killer is.

Thankfully, there's some good beyond the three girls noted above (especially McGowan, who's a pleasure to watch), like the numerous references to horror flick lore and the whodunit factor, but none of these redeem it from being a joke of a slasher. It's worth seeing if you like slasher movies, if for no other reason than to see if it matches the over-hype, but you'll probably be disappointed because of the disagreeable characters and the odd horror/parody fusion, not to mention the cartooniness and contrivances.

The film runs 111 minutes and was shot in Santa Rosa, Tomales, Glen Ellen, Healdsburg and Sonoma, California.

907677,5,6304675348,"in honor of wes craven, i sat down with a stack of fourteen of his movies. in the end, i held the hills have eyes and scream in my hands; i went with the latter because i saw it at a time in my life when i was pretty low, pretty down, and it really played a part in my re-invigoration.

what a dynamite movie. slightly less meta than new nightmare--scream spends a lot of time talking about itself, new nightmare is about itself--but still clever and engrossing after all these years, with plenty of nods to horror, and specifically, slasher history. the opening sequence is a punch in the gut, one of the finest horror film intros ever, and provides a nice bridge between the down and dirty wes craven who brings the pain, and the polished, elder craftsperson who can work in hollywood. this is best typified when we see steve from the torso up and hear some ripping, wet sounds. in my mind, having seen scream a million times, i foresaw the scene as showing us steve's entrails in gruesome close-up, but in actuality, we only see him for a fraction of a moment, from far away, from down low. craven gives us a practically subliminal glimpse at the deed, and then let's our own imagination do the rest. patrick lussier deserves props for his sharp editing throughout.

the jagged steadicam zoom to casey with the sounds of her mother shrieking also makes it perfectly clear that this is going to be an honest to god horror movie. craven has a lot of fun with the camera throughout, shooting many scenes at low and off-kilter angles. it's really a sublime delight to watch.

what also really makes scream fantastic are the performances. the leads--neve campbell, courtney cox, and david arquette--are all tremendous, and the rest of the cast really makes the most of each opportunity. rose mcgowan as tatum is sassy and smart and an utter delight, and mathew lillard is every bit her equal as the manic and tactless stu. there is a scene with these two, when school is out (forever!), and they're walking down the sidewalk, moving all over the place, with stu lifting tatum over his shoulder and dancing with her like a pair of figure skaters before finally dipping her whilst the two try to convince sydney that a par-tay is just what she needs. it's seamless, and recalls craven giving us another group of teens walking down the street, nancy, tina, glen, and finally rod, in the original elm street. jamie kennedy is the perfect nerd gatekeeper, explaining what's going down to the rest of the cast and the general public. skeet ulrich is super skeevy, and henry winkler is the perfect principal. each of these actors sings kevin williamson's smart dialogue. additionally, the cheerleader in the bathroom expounding upon sydney's mental state is brilliant, and provides more meta-narrative. also, nice to see donald thompson's deputy, joseph whipp, ascended to sheriff. drew barrymore or course totally nails the opening.

a great movie and really smart, knowing work by the great wesley earl craven. as is always the case, themes of perseverance and survival, as well as accepting the truth, are ever present. like i said this movie rescued me; i can't thank you enuf, wes.",1441065600,2,3177,4.729241877256317

With the typical jump scares which aren't scary the stereotype characters, and the goofy kills we have come to expect from hack and slash movies.  The only thing that is interesting is trying to figure who the killer might be that was the only thing I found interesting in this whole dull movie,  Also the costume of our killer looks pretty cool but that can't sustain a 2 hour movie.

908256,4,6304675348,"What more can I say about ""Scream"" other than it single-handedly resurrected the horror genre after an abysmal early 1990's run. Before ""Scream"", great horror was few and far between in the 90's (films like ""Nightbreed"", ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1990), ""Bram Stokers Dracula"", ""Candyman"", and ""New Nightmare"" are the only real standouts in my opinion) and the genre was on a major downtick and seeing the worst recession it had endured since the late 1960's to mid 1970's. Worst of all, the glory days of 80's horror was over and it seemed as if there was no true hope in sight for fans, then Wes Craven dropped a neutron bomb on the genre and it helped breathe life into it and it has been on a rise ever since. More and more good horror has been coming out of Hollywood since 1996 and it is all thanks to this gem of a film.

Part horror and part satire, Wes Cravens ""Scream"" toes the dangerous (and often unforgiving) line between horror and comedy, sometimes blurring the line so much that it is hard to distinguish when you should be scared or laugh. What we are given is a film masterfully crafted by one of the most brilliant minds in horror history and perfectly cast. From a script written by late 90's wunderkind Kevin Williamson, what we are offered is a unique spin on the genre, a film that is not afraid to make fun of horror film cliche's and dares to spit in the eye of them. A film that focuses more on terror of the unseen and unknown than any film since Carpenters immortal ""Halloween"". A film that leaves you guessing until the final act and introduces so many great characters (and villains) and phrases to the horror lexicon that it is almost sickening. If there were one horror film to define an entrie decade and stand out as its best offering, in the 30's it would be ""Bride of Frankenstein"", in the 40's it would be ""The Wolf Man"", in the 50's it would be ""Creature From the Black Lagoon"", in the 60's it would be ""Night of the Living Dead"", in the 70's it would be ""Halloween"", in the 80's it would be ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"", and in the 90's it would be ""Scream"". A definite must-see and a film that is in my personal top 50 films list.",1415750400,2,2171,4.360493827160494

Don't watch the beginning of this movie while eating I will tell you that much. The Scream movies are still a movies I will watch around Halloween. In the Scream movies there a ghost faced killer going around and killing everyone and basically the killer just slashes people's throats noting to gruesome. There is also some romance in each movie as well which I like. So if you want to watch a scary movie that's not to gross watch the Screams movies.,1414713600,,655,4.360655737704918

908733,4,6304675348,"I've gone back and forth in my feelings about ""Scream"" both times I've seen it, almost 20 years ago when it opened, and just now There are times when its meta-parody- butstill-scary approach to teen slasher films works quite well, especially the ending which manages to be funny, scary, over the top, and socially witty all at the same time. Other times it's too self conscious to actually be scary, but not surprising enough in its humor to really be as much fun as it could be.

It's also a hard film to criticize, because the answer to almost every complaint (e.g. the actors playing high school kids all look like they're well into in their 20s) can always be 'but that's the whole point, it's always that way in these movies'. But one thing that does annoy me that isn't so easily shrugged off is that the cast seem to be in a number of different movies. Skeet Ulrich, for example, brings a surprising amount of realism and depth to his character, while Courtney Cox as an 'I'll do anything for a story' reporter plays a cartoon of a cartoon. This isn't of issue of 'good' versus 'bad' acting, but it does make figuring out just what the tone of the film is, more muddy than it needs to be.

Probably the best thing about 'Scream' is it knows when to BE best. The opening and closing 15 minutes are the two strongest sections of the film, so if the middle is a little all over the place and sometimes repetitive, and a little more obvious in it's humor, that's not what you walk away remembering.",1413331200,,1501,4.415162454873646

908789,5,6304675348,"Directed by: Wes Craven
Written by: Kevin Williamson
Starring:David Arguette, Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, Skeet Ulrick, Drew Barrymore, Rose McGowan, Roger Jackson, Matthew Lillard.

This is an excellent story about a killer who dresses in a dime store ghosty face costume. He sneaks around the little town of Woodsboro heckling people with vicious phone calls (thanks for the terror Roger Jackson) and stabbing them if all goes as planned. He is an uncoordinated villian and ends up sprawled on the ground as often as his victims.  It is an off beat approach to a horror movie that paid off at the finish line like Seabiscuit to win.  Many a risk was taken in this film and one has to give credit to Craven and Williamson for pulling it off.  What's so unusual?  The dialogue in this movie drops the name of about a dozen other movies.  The result is not meltdown, but upbeat. Also the so called objective reporter is a main character exploiting the story for her own book sales.  So Gale (Cox) becomes a character with a past who has angered many with her selfish style.  Another odd thing: Craven goes for laughs here and there. Usually a horror flick is serious and goes for fear. Other things you don't often see in a shocker is very good to excellent photography: inspirational sunsets, sweeping panning shots.

Campbell and McGowan do a great job as two feisty friends both with some smarts. Barrymore shows some very good acting during the film's opening scenes.  A strange sound occurs in this movie as Neve opens a closet.  I have never heard a kind of electronic moan and thought it added some freshness.  Music was good featured by an acoustic version of ""Don't Fear the Reaper"".  One more comment: there were of course scary bloody moments in this movie.  When Wes goes for terror, he doesn't mess around.  He'll make you feel like it's all happening outside your bedroom window.  Maybe it is? The phone will ring first.
This movie gets my vote as a groundbreaking great idea.  Give it a try.",1409616000,,2007,4.688571428571429
908790,5,6304675348,"My view of horror as an art form all changed on one cold winter day in 1996. December 20th, 1996 to be exact. A little movie called Scream opened and terrified moviegoers everywhere. It was the first film of its kind. A horror movie in which the characters in the movie had seen other horror movies. It could have been confusing and overly meta but it was all part of the fun.

""Scream"" made horror movies scary again with a brilliantly constructed plot. One year after the death of Sidney Prescott's (Campbell) mother, two students turn up gutted. When a serial killer appears, Sidney begins to suspect whether her mother's death and the two new deaths are related. No one is safe, as the killer begins to pick everyone off one by one. Finally, something the horror genre was missing: a good old fashioned murder mystery. The performances all around are first rate from Neve Campbell as the vulnerable to Courteney Cox as the bitchy journalist willing to do whatever it takes to get a story Gale Weathers to David Arquette as the sweet, slightly dimwitted Deputy Dewey to Drew Barrymore's doomed Casey Becker.",1409184000,,1110,4.721649484536083

908925,5,6304675348,"So here's my sob story.
I was living in Vienna. I was running low on Schillinge (this was before the Euro) and I was feeling low. At this point I thought movies in general a waste of time, especially those that had any hint of commercial success. But I also knew movies cheered me up, and I really needed some cheer. There must have been loads of great movies to see in that metropolis (not to mention live theater, dance, improv, cellar tavern brawls) but for unknown reasons I committed what shall be known as ""the mistake.""
I bought a ticket for Scream...4? I think it was 4. Oh, God, how dreary. A movie at the end of a dying franchise is so pathetic. Neve Campbell looked like she was coming back from rehab. The plot was made out of styrofoam. Forget it. I give lots of movie a second chance, that one I will never watch again unless forced to do so by an act of torture ironic seeing how many torture porn films I've watched. But I digress.
Months into my improvised exploration of the horror genre and all its related sub-genres and crossover genres, I realized that there was a reason the franchise lasted that long. The first movie really meant a lot to people, people who had skin in the game then like I do now. I want nothing more than peace, health and wealth for me & my family, and a thriving world horror cinema industry. That's why I get ecstatic over movies like Cabin in the Woods.
And that's what Scream must have felt like when first release.
You have a genuinely scary killer, a gorgeous leading actress (Neve Campbell), a gorgeous comic foil (Courtney Cox) and a gorgeous ""decoy"" (Drew Berrymore)and you've got a script that speaks EXACTLY to the frustrations that fans were having with mainstream and probably even side-stream horror movies back then: boring, predictable, cheap and obviously mercenary. Tired. Worn.
Movies, yes, like Scream 4.",1405987200,2,1869,4.582089552238806

909003,5,6304675348,"Aside from his Nightmare On Elm Street movie, Scream is my second favorite horror film to be made by Wes Craven with Shocker coming at 3rd. It could be said that this is also one of my many favorite horror movies of all time. The 90s had been going through a transitional stage with horror films and there really hadn't been a great slasher film since Craven's 1984 Nightmare On Elm Street. Then in 1996, Craven gave slasher fans this amazing masterpiece that is, Scream.

Many of you know the plot, but I'll go into it anyway to give my thoughts on parts of it. Neve Campbell delivers a tremendous, awe-inspiring lead role as Woodsboro high school teen, Sidney Prescott. Sidney is dealing with loads of distress as the 1 year anniversary of her mother's death, who was murdered a year prior, is approaching. We're informed that the murder of Sidney's mother, Maureen, was supposedly done at the hands of Cotton Weary who is currently serving prison time.

All the while, a killer dubbed The Ghostface Killer has come to the town of Woodsboro with their focus being on poor, traumatized Sidney. Unfortunately for her, they're dead-set on killing her just like her mother was killed and they're killing her closest friends to get to her. As the trail gets bloodier and the bodies pile up, Sidney must come to terms with the Ghostface Killer and realize that the only way to find who's behind the mask is to play their deadly cat and mouse game.

What I love about Scream is that when you watch it for the very first time, it's scary and the suspense is intense. What I also love about Scream is the huge cast involved in it. There are so many characters in the movie, you literally spend half of the time trying to figure out who the killer is from the wide cast of characters. Everyone playing their parts in this film are superb as there are no bad actors/actresses in this movie. Courtney Cox also stars in this movie as the obnoxious, loud-mouthed author and news reporter, Gale Weathers. David Arquette also delivers in his role as the lovable and mellow cop, Deputy Dewey. And how can we forget about good ole Skeet Ulrich!

Overall: If you're a fan of suspenseful slashers that tell a great story and are unpredictable, watch Scream. Definitely in my Top 3 films to be made by Wes Craven! An interesting little known fact about this movie is that Neve Campbell and Skeet Ulrich starred in the amazing supernatural thriller, The Craft, earlier that year (which is also an amazing film). The sequels that would come, following the first Scream weren't as good but that's the case with most series movies. All in all, Scream is a 90s classic that is a must-have for any horror/slasher/Wes Craven films",1401494400,,2704,4.627083333333333

909007,5,6304675348,"Scream is one of the greatest horror movies of all time. It provided a rebirth and second great era of horror movie slashers. Wes Craven proved to be one of the greatest horror directors of all time but directing two of the greatest horror movies in two separate decades. He gave birth to Freddy Kruger and gives birth to Ghost face here too. To start in terms of acting in this movie just about everyone put in their career best performance here. Neve Campbell was awesome as the new Scream Queen taking over for Jamie Lee Curtis.

  The supporting cast was incredible. Matthew Lillard almost stole the movie. He was very energetic. Rose McGowan was awesome as a tough chick and best friend to Neve. Jamie Kennedy was excellent in his role of the horror movie obsessed geek who explains the rules of the horror movies and has a crush on Neve. Courtney Cox gave the best performance of her career as a bitchy news reporter willing to do whatever it takes to get the story and make a buck or two. David Arquette played the dim witted but lovable deputy to a tee. His best role ever in his career.  Skeet Ulrich also gave an excellent performance and like some of these actors you wonder why they didn't have better careers.

  The movie is scary with great suspense and humor. It's fun trying to guess the killer and Craven did this movie in such a way is that you suspect everyone. It had a great story, interesting characters and was a thrill ride from start to finish. It was the best horror movie of the 90s by far. This is a must own for any true horror movie fan. If you are viewing this movie for the first time you are in for a real treat. Turn off the lights on a late Friday night grab some popcorn and watch this classic you won't be disappointed.

909052,3,6304675348,"From the director of A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, SHOCKER, and DEADLY FRIEND(Wes Craven) comes this horror flick masterpiece regarding after a series of mysterious deaths befalls their small town, an offbeat group of friends led by Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) become the target of a masked killer in this smash-hit ""clever thriller"" that launched the SCREAM franchise and breathed new life into the horror genre.

SCREAM was partly based on the real-life case of the Gainesville Ripper & was inspired by writer(Kevin Williamson's)passion for horror flicks, especially John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN.

SCREAM also provided a comedy & ""whodunit"" mystery with the violence of the slasher genre to satirize the clich of the horror genre popularized in films such as HALLOWEEN back in the Fall of 1978 & FRIDAY THE 13TH back in the Spring of 1980. This flick was also considered unique at the time when it was released in the late Fall of 1996 for featuring characters who were aware of real world horror flicks & openly discussed the clich that SCREAM attempted to subvert.

SCREAM was also credited with revitalizing the horror genre in the 1990's which was considered to be almost dead following an influx of direct-to-video titles & numerous sequels to established horror franchises of the 1970's and 1980's along with the fact that those sequels drew decreasing financial & critical success as they exploited clichs that films in that genre had become reliant upon, but SCREAM's success spawned a series of sequels, except only SCREAM II which was released in the Fall of 1997, achieved a level of commercial & critical success equal to the original which in this case was SCREAM I, plus director Wes Craven even got Saturn nominations for best director for 1996 as well.

Unfortunately, years later after SCREAM's theatrical release was accused of inspiring & even inducing violent crimes & murders, especially with the bad influence of SCREAM's mysterious masked murderer ""Ghostface"" just like Michael Myers was the ghoulish mass murderer for HALLOWEEN, Freddy Kruger was the scorched evil serial killer for A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, the diabolical hockey-masked murderer(Jason Voorhees) was for FRIDAY THE 13TH, and ""Chucky"" was the wicked murdering doll in CHILD'S PLAY.",1386720000,,2273,5.185286103542234

This is the movie Wes Craven waited all his life to make, and all the classic elements of his best films to date are in this flick---the violence, the suspense, the great characters, cool story, and really good acting. Of course, Craven is interpreting Kevin Williamson's inspired screenplay, so can't forget his invaluable contribution. Expertly crafted, SCREAM is about as good as it gets for modern slash movies, and not only did it resurrect the slasher genre from a slump, it also helped usher in the current horror rage... going 17 years strong now! Neve Campbell is awesome and believable in the lead role, Drew Barrymore is splendid in her 'Janet Leigh' bit, and gotta say the bag guys are as crazy as Krug and Company from Craven's LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT '72 at the end. The movie holds up solid today, and I watch it over and over, many times over each year...Definitely among my favorite slasher movies of all time, and THE favorite of the newer batch made after the the 80's.",1382486400,,1100,4.675257731958763

909178,3,6304675348,"I've watched this movie many times and still don't understand what all the fuss is about.  It's a slasher flick.  Just because it supposedly parodies the genre doesn't elevate it above the genre.  It still uses the exact same elements in the same manner as the rest.  A wink and nod to the camera, assuring us of its self-awareness, doesn't alter the fact, it's still just a slasher flick, no better or worse than the rest.  Employing a cast of elderly ""teens"" is par for the course.  The number of victims is actually quite low.  The costume is silly, not scary.  The number of red herrings is limited to four and of the four; the most obvious is under the mask.  The harassed victim (Neve Campbell) is just as ineffectual as every other harassed victim, it's a key element they didn't bother to change or update.  Bad acting abounds (primarily Matthew Lillard and his tongue).  How it got to be the highest grossing slasher flick of all time is beyond me.
As I stated, I've watched Scream many times, I will continue to watch it.  It's in my collection but it's definitely not one of my favorites.  As far as the scare factor goes, it's practically nil.  The problem with trying to appear glib and hip is that you risk watering down all that is expected in a slasher flick, replacing it with unwarranted humor instead.

These comments still remain true today, and the references to other scary movies only get increasingly relevant with the continual stream of slasher and horror flicks which have come out since 2000.

Randy mentions all the rules...Stu disobeyed like every one and his body doesn't show up...well then that just made it easy(by the way when we 1st saw this I was the only one who guessed it, my husband didn't even guess everyone....but he's proud that I did so here's a shout out to you, love you babe!",1379203200,2,1047,4.24

I was hooked instantly. This proved to be a very enjoyable movie. The introduction of the killer was done extremly well, this is one scary character to imagine running from. Most characters felt well done and easy to understand, although some were pretty annoying. Surprisingly the humor of this movie, be it lines or the killer stumbling over 50% of whatever ended up in fron of him, proved to be very well balanced with the horror part.

What got me into this movie, was the fact that the killer tries to act repeatidly through out the movie, rather then do very minor actions before going after the main character. Also I was surprised how I much I was in detective mode and how I found myself trying to guess who the killer was, not because I was bored with the movie, but because the movie interested me so much. The bored reason is when I usually try and think about it.

As the movie went on, it got more intense and when it ended I was impressed with it, and I know I wanted to check the rest out.

There are minor gripes with this however. (SPOILER ALERT) Some characters are pretty annoying but thankfully leave, Gale constently getting in the way drove me nuts (Yes it's a sterotypical character but still makes the list). Dewey, Gale and Rodney aren't very interesting in this movie. Finally, this isn't a true dislike, it was pretty easy to guess who the killer was although I wasn't expecting both of the two ""Real"" suspects to be partners in crime.

Plus the acting is done very well with great casting for the movie.

909545,3,6304675348,"The SCREAM Blu-Ray is an overall solid HD upconvert of the original DVD: all the special features are transplanted, as well as original commentary. However, as upconverts go, it's pretty sweet, but the tradeoff is that the clarity of the transfer really accentuates the image problems (NONE of which have anything to do with the transfer itself).

For starters, the film is finally presented in its original anamorphic aspect ratio, but this comes with a price. Considering that the film was shot on practical locations instead of sets, anamorphic may not have been the best format choice: the close quarters of real buildings really emphasize the ""squeeze"" effect at the edges of the frame in kitchens or narrow hallways. Original DP Mark Irwin was allegedly fired because of severe focus problems in dailies and I tend to believe it: there are glaring focus problems in the last 2 reels, and the wide-angle shots (10-12mm) have the depth of field of a medium (50mm) lens. I was surprised at how just HOW diverse the focus was throughout most of the shots and wondered why they didn't reshoot entire sequences because of it.

The film's age also tends to show in the color representation. Cheap film stocks of the 90s used by indie filmmakers and Dimension films were prone to displaying dirt damage and luminance source with the same crispness as the picture so this can be a tad intrusive compared to single-generation master transfers of today, but at least they feel natural rather than a sign of poor maintenance. The color, however, is well-represented: it's not flat, faded, or washed, just a tad uninteresting.

There IS a bit of pixellation in the blacks and darks, but fortunately they blend well with the natural film grain of the image, so it's very hard to tell which is which. And YES, I was looking for this deliberately. Some have complained of haloing towards the later part of the film but it didn't seem to bother me all that much considering that this is an HD transfer of a 16-year-old movie and not a full-blown JAWS/GODFATHER restoration.

The soundtrack has already been listed in greater detail by others, but I agree: the sound is surprisingly stellar, even overbearing at times with how much detail is in the foley track.

All in all, the Blu-Ray is a nice package for fans of the film or those nostalgic for the theatrical experience of 1996. For a film that hasn't undergone any restoration work, it's still in pretty good condition. It's not worth a $20 tag, but for $10-12 it's a welcome addition to the library.

Syndey's friends and her boyfriend Billy (Skeet Ulrich, ""The Craft"") are there to comfort and support Sydney through these trying times.

Oh I think I forgot to mention there's a killer with the nickname ""Ghost Face"" whose come to town and seems to be targeting certain people and killing them, like he did to Drew Barrymore in the fantastic opening sequence. This killer seems to be working their way towards Sydney for reasons that become much clearer as the movie goes on.

What director Wes Craven (""Red Eye"", ""Nightmare on Elm Street"") does well with this material written by Kevin Williamson (""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", ""The Faculty"") is give it a lot of punch and mock the horror cliches of various movies, while making a great, fun film on its own.

The before-mentioned opening sequence with Drew Barrymore as the first victim was very well done, starting with a phone call featuring the famous creepy voice asking ""Do you like scary movies?"" and ending in a short chase scene and killing. The rest of the movie features some clever dialogue, good death scenes and funny and good performances by other actors like Matthew Lillard (""Scooby-Doo""), Jamie Kennedy (""Romeo & Juliet""), David Arquette (""Eight Legged Freaks""), Rose McGowan (""Planet Terror"") and a funny small role by Henry Winkler (""The Waterboy"").

These movies all have a 2.35:1 (or 2.40:1) aspect ratio.  The video quality of these movies is very good to great. I rate it about 9.3 on a 10.0 scale (I have never rated a Blu-Ray below 4.0).

All 3 movies have DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio, which is adequate to very good.

I thought the movies were okay, but not great.  I don't know if I am going to ever watch them again - I may sell them.",1327449600,,556,4.045871559633028

Like so many slasher films the original was better. It was both bloodier (the death of casey and steve being the bloodiest of course) and funnier (mathew lillard was classic).  the thing is the rest of them were also great.  It unlike the slasher films that followed but like the original halloween knew the power of a knife to put the audience on the edge of their seat.

909774,4,6304675348,"Finally we get all the SCREAM films on blu ray and here we have the first and best that was hugely original and put a much needed original kick in the horror movie genre.  We all know the story and we also know that when an older classic film comes out on a blu ray transfer it is really important to find out the quality and if the transfer succeeded.  I was thrilled when I popped this movie into my blu ray player and was itching to see the infamous opening scene with Drew Barrymore.  Sadly it was a huge disappointment.  The audio was great but the video totally lacked clarity and seemed blury and overly grainy.  For me the full effect of the scene was lost.  Luckily when we get to the next scene with Neve Campbell at her computer the video had hugely improved.  The picture was pretty crisp, colors were vibrant, flesh tones realistic and I was then impressed.  Throughout the rest of the movie the video quality gets about a B.  The dark scenes work well.  Black and white ratio is clean and the colors do blend in well.  The graininess after the opening scene is there on purpose and looks fine.  When the villian dashes in and out of the picture the black and white of the costume looks great.  But the part of the movie that is a truly huge improvement over the dvd is the audio.  The DTS HD Master 5.1 audio track uses all surround speakers to full effect.  Dialogue is crisp and you will be jumping out of your seat in all the right moments.  The track is perfect for this classic horror movie and shines.  The soundtrack blends in with all the films sounds perfectly.

But the video is where opinions will clash.  For me the upgrade to blu ray is much better than my dvd version.  I never liked the dvd presentations and the blu ray is in a 1080p enhanced widescreen which makes viewing the film better.  There is some fine detail but the picture overall just does not POP like a quality blu ray does.  I think when most people watch a blu ray they want that crispness and clarity that just makes it far surpass the dvd.  It can become almost like you are in the movie.  I think people forget the film is 15 years old and overall the picture is acceptable but the poor quality of the opening scene just leaves it lacking for me.  When the movie is offered on blu ray at a steal price which Amazon seems to be doing now it is definitely worth a buy but if you are pretty satisfied with a dvd version you own I would think before purchasing it at full price.",1305936000,15,2473,4.244111349036403

909779,5,6304675348,"So many will wonder why I claim this is a forgotten classic. I mean isn't the SCREAM mask still sold at Halloween? Haven't we just seen a new sequel released? Isn't the movie spoken of in every Wes Craven interview?

All of these things might be true but the fact remains that while SCREAM did do big box office, was sequelized and is talked about at times, I found in watching it again that it was a much better film than I recalled. It was scarier than I remembered. It was better made than I thought at first. And it works on so many levels as to be considered a classic.

For those uninitiated the film tells the story of a group of teenage friends. The film opens with Casey (Drew Barrymore) receiving an anonymous phone call with someone who at first flirts with her and then threatens her. In short order she not only witnesses her boyfriend's demise but is soon murdered herself by a killer in a stretched ghost face mask and flowing black tattered robe.

The next day the kids at her high school are upset when they hear of the murders. But as teens go they also tend to move on to the next thing that interests them, a true example of A.D.D. Enter our main character Sidney (Neve Campbell), a young woman whose boyfriend Billy (Skeet Ulrich) wants to take things to another level but who remains chaste. Her best friend Tatum (Rose McGowan) isn't quite as pure. Tatum's boyfriend Stuart (Matthew Lillard) is the court jester, making jokes at all times. Rounding out this group is Randy (Jamie Kennedy) the nerd of pack who works at the local video store and is a movie fanatic.

As the film progresses so does the body count. With each murder we also get a glimpse of the killer and the fact that he seems to be a bit of a bumbler compared to the villains other slasher films have delivered in the past. Where the cool killer reigned in most, this killer trips over his costume, gets knocked in the head more than once and gets downed occasionally only to mysteriously disappear. While choosing to wear a goofy mask this seems like more of what a real serial killer might be like, a klutz who makes mistakes.

The cast is rounded out by David Arquette as Deputy Dewey, Tatum's brother and the local goofball policeman. Dewey comes off as little more than a Don Knotts/Barney Fife knock off. But beneath it all lies something more than gets revealed a piece at a time in all of the SCREAM movies.

Offsetting this character is Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox), a driven newswoman who will do anything to get the story and advance her career. At the moment she is not well liked by Sidney whose life story Gale has pitched on more than one occasion. Sidney's mother was murdered earlier and Sidney has identified Cotton Weary (Liev Schrieber) as the killer. Gale has taken Cotton's side in the matter and has done all she can to get his release much to the displeasure of Sidney.

Now the nice part about all of these characters is that each one has a reason to be the killer and the opportunity over and over again. We constantly wonder who the killer is and each time you think you know you find yourself pausing to consider the next person. Is Dewey really hiding his homicidal tendencies behind the goofy faade? Is Gale so determined to get Cotton released that she'd do anything to see it happen? Could Billy have had a reason to become the killer since his mother left him? Every character bops in and out of the scene with ample opportunity to jump back in as the killer.

At the heart of this is Randy, the movie nerd, who takes the time at a party to discuss the ins and outs of horror films and ""the rules"". So many actually fit any number of films that have been released its hilarious. For instance the rule that if you're a virgin you're safe. Having sex always results in being the next victim. Or never say ""I'll be right back"" when leaving a room since it usually results in your chances of returning being non-existent.

What makes this movie so good is that it keeps your guessing like the best whodunit ever made. You find yourself thinking it's this person then another then another until you're never quite sure who you think did it. And then result, the reveal, was a tremendous surprise when this film was first released. Even knowing who the killer is doesn't spoil the fun watching it again as you catch the clues left throughout.

The movie is also fun because of the in jokes that many movie fans will catch. Names of characters, locations, little aside dropped in all make the movie hilarious with each one. The best one is when high school principal Henry Winkler hears a noise in the hall, sticks his head out and sees the school janitor (played by director Wes Craven) wearing a green and red striped long sleeved sweater who grunts at him, to which Winkler replies ""Sorry, Fred"". Yes, a direct reference to Craven's best known film A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET.

The SCREAM films are being released in blu-ray format for the first time from Lionsgate who recently picked up the distribution rights. They've done a great job with it, just in time for the release of the latest sequel. Best of all its nice to see the film come out in a clean format that means it can be appreciated again for some and for the first time for others. Believe it or not the movie IS fifteen years old now. So if you're watching it with someone who hasn't seen it don't let them know who the killer is, sit back and watch them try to figure it out and enjoy the ride.",1304467200,3,5478,4.440796019900498

***SPOILER WARNING***

I broke down and picked this up because Amazon had it on sale for $6. Though not perfect, the picture quality is good/very good. The sound, on the other hand, is fantastic - one of the best DTS-MA tracks I've heard on blu-ray. However, despite all the audio and visual goodness on display, the admittedly small edits to achieve the ""R"" rating are annoying. The tone of the film changes subtly as a result.

The slow-mo zoom at the end of the opening scene is far more effective than when sped up. A snipped second here and there in a number of other death scenes make them seem cartoonish and sanitized. Two characters appear to repeatedly stab each other with little consequence.

If Scream were released today, it would surely receive an ""R"" in its uncut form. Compared to the likes of Saw and Hostel, the on-screen violence is positively restrained. Lionsgate dropped the ball on this one. Please don't wait another 15 years to fix it.",1302825600,49,1147,4.715

909899,5,6304675348,"Amazon doesn't seem to be separating these reviews, but this review is for the Blu-ray box set of all three films from Alliance.

At roughly $15 a pop for each film, it was well worth the purchase.

The basics: the transfers are in 1080i, not 1080p, but my player converts it to 1080p at 60Mhz anyway, as I'm sure most players will. Regardless of the 1080i, the transfer on all three films is very strong and certainly the best quality currently out there. The colors are nice and vibrant without overpowering the scenes, and some shots are very striking in their detail, especially if all you've seen are the regular DVDs. The first film looks like an entirely new movie thanks to the transfer, especially considering it was never even released in anamorphic widescreen. Certain shots were very surprising, most notably Tatum's scene in the garage--the Ghostface costume looks very glittery and sparkles on the screen, which is something that caught my eye immediately. It's as if the killer has rolled around in glitter. I never noticed it before.

The soundtrack is fine for all I can tell, but I don't have a surround system, just my TV speakers.

The films are all presented in their original 'R' rated versions--no cuts.

There are no extras whatsoever, so that may be disappointing to some. However, I personally don't watch the extras on my movies anyway.

The real issue here was the packaging. Despite being very nice to look at (the outer sleeve slides off much like a TV box set, and it's a cool blue color), ""Scream 2"" and 3 were incredibly hard to remove from the packaging. On one hand, it's nice they're secure for shipping, but man I had to practically break the things to get them out. ""Scream"" is on the other side of the ""book"" (it flips open) and I had no issues removing it, but I had hell with parts 2 and 3. I didn't even put them back in the case after removing them, I stuck them in separate DVD cases to avoid going through that crap again.

All in all, I cannot imagine any future release looking much better than this. There is some -slight- grain in a few scenes throughout the films, but the image is so sharp and crisp it honestly didn't bother me. I would say the quality is pretty excellent and I was very satisfied. They looked like new films.

If you are tired of waiting for the U.S. to release these films on Blu-ray and don't mind the lack of extras, you can't go wrong picking this up. The films look great, and at $15 a pop they're a bargain. And unless the U.S. release is something amazing, I cannot imagine they would look much better.",1296691200,3,2579,4.507494646680942

909902,2,6304675348,"I don't get all the love for Scream.  It's not a particularly appealing movie to me.  I love slasher films when they're actually executed well, but this one misses the mark in WAY too many areas.

The films idea of building suspense through lengthy phone calls isn't the least bit frightening, and just about every one of the main characters are either very poor actors, or just terrible in this particular case.

The entire conclusion -without spoiling what happens- is terrible too.  It's bland, uninspiring and uninteresting writing to the extreme.

When it comes to slasher flicks, I like to see suspenseful segments leading to a gruesome and unforgettable outcome for the poor victims.  The violent segments here wouldn't be out of place on the Lifetime Movie Network, seriously.

It seems a trend is developing here- movies from the late 90's looked good back in the day, but the actual writing and storylines have dated horribly and aren't fun at *all* to watch  We're talking severely flawed storylines and execution.  I'm noticing this is especially the case with the horror genre.

Scream falls in the same exact category as other horror films from the same period in time, I'm afraid.  It's just not scary to me, and the borderline mockery of the whole slasher genre doesn't help either.",1284681600,,1298,4.9036697247706424

910011,5,6304675348,"After reading several of the reviews on here, it is abundantly clear that a majority of the reviewers missed the point of the film entirely.  Scream is Wes Craven's attempt to pay homage and occasionally lampoon the genre he had been apart of for a quarter of a century, when Scream was released in the mid nineties.  As a horror fan, the film was revolutionary to the genre, because it infused fun and comedy into horror.  If you are a horror fan, all the winks and references to seminal horror of the late seventies and eighties (ie Halloween and Friday the 13th) should be very enjoyable.  This film might well be responsible for bringing horror back to the big screen, as it seemed destined for straight to video at the time, with it's humor, wit, and pacing.  If you're a teen reading this, skip it and go text through the entire crappy remake of whatever classic film Rob Zombie is ruining this week, because I'm sure you've never seen the original, or wait for Scream 4 to be released watch it and then realize their might actually be some good horror out there that doesn't have Hannah Montana in it.",1281139200,4,1108,4.52

910017,5,6304675348,"""Scream"" reinvented the horror genre upon its release in 1996. Scary films went to the wayside at the boxoffice by the late 1980's after films like ""Halloween"" and ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" made too many sequels that were badly written and poorly acted, and ultimately the audience didn't buy in to them. ""Scream"" was written by writer genius Kevin Williamson. The story is based in the fictional town of Woodsboro where murders are taking place with the killer making obsene phone calls (with his voice disguised) to his victims before killing them. The film is basically a whodunnit film and its up to the audience to decide who is the actual killer. The acting ensemble is filled with fresh and vibrant new faces who can actually act and the script is both brisk and surprising. You will be shocked at the surprise ending. ""Scream"" was a huge boxoffice hit and ultimately spawned two other sequels that were just as good as the original. Thankfully, the producers wisely stopped making any more sequels after the third installment reasoning that scripts would become tiresome and they didn't want to fall into the same mess that films like ""Halloween"" found themselves in after making too many sequels only for the sake of making money. Too bad the producers of the ""Saw"" franchise"" would not follow suit! The DVD has special features including a featurette and interviews with the cast and crew on the making of the movie.",1262736000,2,1426,4.848360655737705

910019,5,6304675348,"The town of Woodsboro is being haunted by a series of brutal murders.  But the focus seems to be Sidney Prescott (Never Campbell).  But this isn't your normal serial killer.  Instead, the killer has been influenced by the horror movies he or she has watched over the years.  Disguised with a Ghostface mask, the killer calls and daunts the victim before arriving to slice and dice.

While most of the high school takes it as a joke, Sidney is taking it seriously.  But who around her might be the killer.  Maybe it's reporter Gail Weathers (Courtney Cox) looking for her next story.  What about film geek Randy (Jamie Kennedy).  Boyfriend Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich) is a suspect, so that makes him innocent, right?  Then again, any of these people might become the next victim.  Will knowing the rules of the horror genre help them make it out alive?

Okay, so this is so NOT my normal genre of film.  And yes, it definitely earns its R rating with brutal violence and horrid language.  But I have always had a fascination with the genre, so when this movie became a surprise hit, I wound up checking it out.  And the mystery fan in me loved it.  The clues and red herrings are everywhere.  However, the jump factor had me going from the start as well.  Yes, I jump quite easily.  My roommate used to laugh at me watching this film, in fact.

The thing that sets this apart from other slasher films is that we actually do get to know some of the victims before they die.  These aren't just the stock characters you'd normally find, but real people.

Okay, so the other thing that set it apart is the humor.  These characters know they are in a horror fan and talk about how to make it out alive.  Of course, convention is thrown on its head (at times).  But that wink at the audience as it attempts to scare us silly adds to the fun.

While most slasher movies still don't entertain me, I keep coming back and watching this franchise.  If you want your scares with a post modern edge, this is the place to turn.",1255305600,4,2012,4.4114441416893735
910077,5,6304675348,"I'm sure in this day and age it's appropriate to give ""Scream"" less than 5 stars. Plenty of folks will say how ""unoriginal"" the movie is, or how it's just a rip-off of a bunch of 80's flicks......and I say Bull***t.

""Scream"" jump started the horror movie genre in the 1990's. Without ""Scream"" we woudn't have flicks like ""I Know Whay You Did Last Summer"" or ""Urban Legend"". Without ""Scream"" we might not have ""Inside"" or ""Martyrs"". Sure ""Scream"" ushered in the 90's version of slasher flickes, but it also ushered in an era of self referential horror films. Wes Craven was able to poke fun of the genre he helped create....and the ""Scream"" audience was in on the joke.

So many horror films since ""Scream"" have come to rely on the horror converntions set forth in ""Scream"" that it actually feels original.

""Scream"" is meant to be fun, the cast, and the soundtrack both indicate that this is a fun film, not to be taken too seriously. If you've seen ""Terror Train"" or ""Prom Night"" or ""Hell Night"" than you are the target audience for ""Scream"", as an homage to 80's horror, you won't find a better film. It plays on the viewer's recollection of Jamie Lee Curtis' early film work, and updating the horror genre beyond what is found in the latest ""Halloween"".

because they were plotless, had gratuitous violence and gave me nightmares. So I was reluctant to see Scream. I waited until it came out on video tape (Yeah, its been that long) however I enjoyed it and didn't feel scared because of the tongue in cheek nature of the film and the funny moments that lessen the shock of the violence But , the suspense kept me on the edge of my seat and the twists and turns keep you guessing who is the killer and why are they trying to kill Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell). The revelation of the killers was surprising, since it seemed that someone older was doing the killings.

910081,5,6304675348,"The opening sequence to this teenage slasher film is one of the most memorable scenes in Hollywood history.  I know, that may seem like jumping the gun a bit, but it's not; believe me.

Think about it; Drew Barrymore alone in a house when the phone rings right as she's setting popcorn on the stove.  She informs the caller that she's getting ready to settle down and watch a scary movie.  She loves scary movies.  The caller is dark and mysterious yet surprisingly friendly, almost so smooth he's inviting and so Drew (her name in the film is Casey) keeps talking to him.  Then he starts to scare her.  He lets her know he's watching her and when she threatens to hang up he threatens her life.  What follows may be one of the most intense scenes in the whole of horror films, and it remains one of the most memorable scenes ever filmed.

So begins a tale of murder in a small town as local students start dropping like flies.  It's the one year anniversary of the brutal murder of young Sidney Prescott's mother and it seems that she is the next target.  Her friends try and show her support, but things look even grimmer when her very own boyfriend appears to be the masked killer.  Dealing with a killer on the loose seems like enough to get anyone frazzled, but Sidney also has to deal with local reporter Gale Weathers, who is obsessed with Sidney's mother's murder and is convinced that Sidney ID'd the wrong guy.

As the night sets in, the body count rises and everyone is using their horror movie knowledge to try and make it to the sequel.

What is so amazing about `Scream' is that it knows what its faults are and it exploits them.  What writer Kevin Williamson and director Wes Craven have done is create a film that pokes fun at the horror movie stereotypes without ever falling into parody territory.  This film is genuinely scary, but it never takes itself too seriously.  It contains all the generic horror clich&eacute;s but inserts its own array of twists to deliver a fresh take on a tired genre.  This is the film that proved to be a rebirth for a genre that many had written off.

The cast is funny and entertaining, Matthew Lillard getting major points for creating an obnoxiously entertaining character that you wanted to see in every scene.  Neve Campbell is a very pretty and very naturally charming girl who should have received a bigger career after this, and Skeet Ulrich has enough of a bad boy charm that you can see him as a suspect but hope and pray that he isn't the killer.  Jamie Kennedy didn't impress me too much, and I've never really felt McGowan was a real actress; but they are serviceable.  David Arquette is effective and Courtney Cox is brilliant (truly), but in all honesty, this movie BELONGS to Drew Barrymore, who in just merely five minutes cemented herself as the new scream queen!

So, the film is chilling, smart, funny and wonderfully crafted.  What's not to love?",1236729600,,2918,4.545977011494253

I think Wes Craven is overrated. Ive stated this on anther one of his movies, i've even checked out the Interet movie database to see what he has done. Nightmare on Elm Street is a classic and probably his best work. His other movies were decent but nothing could compare to Nightmare on Elm Street.

910159,3,6304675348,"When ""Scream"" first came out, 12 or 13 years ago I loved it. Because it seemed to be such a funny and clever film. Keep in mind, I was 12 when I first saw this movie. I just watched ""Scream"" the other day on Encore Mystery (because heaven knows that network TV has gone to hell in a handle basket!) and experienced a totally different feeling about this movie.

This movie is just a ridicules farce because it's such a cliche. If anyone is over the age of 12 and can't tell who the killer is then he or she probably had a lobotomy. And, most of the characters were so annoying. The 2 killers acted like they totally wanted to get in each other's pants, they didn't seem like murderers. Courteney Cox (as Gale Weathers) was so foolish because she's such a lousy actress. Courteney Cox' acting  (in)capabilities rival that of Madonna. The only good scene with her was when she got punched in the face.

I did like Rose McGowan (as Tatum Riley.) She came off as believable. But why did they have to kill her? And I sorta liked Jamie Kennedy (Randy) because he was so funny, ""virgins don't get killed."" But overall, most of the movie is really not worth watching.

The best part of the movie is the beginning with Drew Barrymore (as Casey Becker.) Drew was only in that first clip, but she still received star billing. She's not in the rest of the movie, but her first scene is certainly the very best because she's really the only true actress in this movie. (BTW, am I the only one who thinks that Drew was wearing a really fugly-looking wig?)

There are also a few aspects of this movie that are fundamentally wrong:

1) Neve Campbell - She's not a very good actress either. The producers should of shelled out a few more bucks so that Drew would of stuck around for the entire movie.

2) Tatum being killed - In all horror movies the good friend/nice girl is never killed off. I don't get why they had to kill her off.

3) The 2 stupid nimrod-killers weren't even frightening - And, they also explained everything at the end in detail. Who does this? This is so ludicrous!

I was going to give the movie a 2 star rating, not 3 stars because it's really a 2 and a half star movie at the very best. But I figured I would be generous and round up to a 3. Sweet dreams are not made of these.",1202256000,4,2287,4.275462962962963
910160,5,6304675348,"It's a well known fact that Scream was single-handedly responsible for a major revival of the horror genre in the 90's, inspiring countless inferior productions and entering pop culture. Nearly 15 years after its release, and with a third sequel scheduled to start production in the next couple of months, I feel inclined to renew my vows as a ultimate Scream fan, even if I feel a bit scared of this new sequel.
Truth is, Scream might just be one of my favorite movies ever. I remember being totally shocked when I first saw it, and I could barely sleep that night. That ghostface mask both haunted and fascinated me. I was barely a teenager, and I was amazed that a movie could get to you like that.
It was a scary movie - simple as that - and it had memorable characters who you cared for. The story was interesting, original, and yet, simple. Straight to the point. Soundtrack was great. Acting was fabulous. I think I really started paying attention to technical aspects of filmmaking as I watched Scream and Scream 2 over and over, and listened to the filmmakers talking about it. It wouldn't be a stretch to say that my love for movies in general exploded with the Scream films.
And to this day, it holds up well. From the classic opening scene with Barrymore to the (then-)surprising end, we hold our breaths.

910161,5,6304675348,"'Scream' is a fantastic horror film, which brought post-modern thought into movies about movies, to the masses. From the opening scene, you realise this film is going to go down in history as a classic. Well-written by Kevin Williamson (Dawson's Creek, I know what you did last summer), brilliantly directed by Wes Craven (Nightmare on Elm St, Red Eye) and acted beautifully (Drew Barrymore, Neve Campbell) - any horror fan should love it.
The scariest thing about this film is that it puts you in the characters point of view, for example - the opening sequence with Drew Barrymore playing Casey Becker is breath-taking. Casey is aware of horror films, and is a horror fan, so when she is victimised by the Ghostface (the killer), she says what we're thinking, putting us in her shoes. The acting and script in this opening 15 mins is amazing, and given that Drew was offered the main role, and turned it down for this role, that alone should tell you how worthy it is of cinema masterpiece, plus it's truly terrifying.
The film then plays out as a thriller/horror with lots of comedic jokes and self referential themes thrown in. We then have the audience trying to decipher who the killer is. The characters are well written, and the film plays out perfectly. This was the movie that started the craze of ninties self referential horror movies, such as 'I know what you did last summer' and 'Teaching Mrs Tingle.'
Written by the then 'fresh talented' Kevin Williamson, who went one to be a teen horror talent, and directed by one of the greatest horror directors, Wes Craven, who brought us one of the most influential 80's horror franchises of all time, 'A Nightmare on Elm Street.' How can you go wrong?
A first grade film which deserved all the praise it got when it came out from critics and movie goers, look out for it if you like your movies fun, scary, witty and smart.

But why does the first one get so much credit, while the other two get so unfairly trashed? The first one has slanderous dialogue-which I hate,and the killer is disappointingly predictable.

The 2nd one is much better despite a bloody opening, and also has alot more humor,Jerry O'Connell singing `I think I love You' to Neve was a riot too!

I'm glad he couldn't write the third one, because Ehren Kruger did better anyway. Kudos to Wes Craven though for only going to 3 chapters, as slasher films so often don't do, and they don't know when to quit, this one covered all aspects of the story w/out going overboard.

910234,5,6304675348,"By the mid-'90s, the teen slasher genre seemed utterly played out. But in 1996, a seemingly unlikely figure helped resurrect the genre. That man was director Wes Craven, the horror maestro who had himself been largely responsible for kickstarting the genre in the '80s with the classic ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" (1984). A dozen years later, he directed a new classic called ""Scream."" Written by Kevin Williamson (""Dawson's Creek""), it's a self-referential horror film/satire that's both terrifying and hilarious.

Craven had actually written and delivered another self-referential, postmodern take on the teen horror genre two years earlier, with ""New Nightmare."" But since that film was the seventh installment in the left-for-dead Elm Street series, it was largely overlooked. ""Scream,"" on the other hand, boasted a new story line, more laughs and a hot young cast, and it quickly became a hit with critics and audiences.

Neve Campbell plays Sidney Prescott, a teenage girl still coping with the violent death of her mother a year earlier. Now, a deranged killer is offing her classmates and other members of the community. Worse, the murderer's got his eye set on Sidney, terrorizing her with a series of creepy phone calls. A tabloid reporter (Courtney Cox) thinks the current serial killer may be the same person who murdered Sidney's mom.

Sidney's friends try to comfort her by cracking wise about horror films and offering advice on how she can avoid becoming the killer's latest victim. It may not sound helpful, but it's better than leaving herself in the hands of bumbling Deputy Dwight Riley (the perpetually annoying David Arquette). In the end, everyone is a suspect, and Sidney races to find the killer's identity and save her life.

""Scream"" succeeds as both a satire and a horror film. Williamson's excellent script tweaks every scary movie cliche and asks the question every horror buff wants to know: Why, when the heroine is being chased by the killer, does she run up the stairs instead of out the front door? It's a blast to watch the film's characters talk horror, even as they're being stalked by the killer.

Of course, the humorous self-referencing wouldn't be nearly as fun if the movie wasn't damn scary in its own right. With a petrifying opening sequence, Craven immediately establishes that he hasn't lost his touch for delivering scares. Ferociously acted by Drew Barrymore -- giving perhaps her finest performance to date -- it's guaranteed to leave you whimpering.

From there, the laughs and scares come fast and furious and don't stop 'till the film's knockout finale. While ""Scream"" did regrettably spawn a slew of weak imitations (including its own limp sequels), the original is a scary treat you don't want to miss.",1179792000,,2758,5.063876651982379

She's great at playing a tough as nails reporter and it makes me wish she was casted as Lois Lane in Superman Returns!  While Neve Campbell should've went on to being a big star after this seies as well, yet you barely see her around these days.

  Campbell plays Sidney Prescott and drama seems to follow her where ever she goes. Her mother was brutally killed and now a year later a killer with a ghostface mask is after her and her friends. Drew Barrymore is really good as the victim in the opening scene. She helps make it one of the most popular and memorable scenes in movie history. The rest of the movie is really good too but not as good as her opening scene. The whole series probably isn't as good as her opening scene.

  Jamie Kenedy probably has his best role here too in a movie as a film geek named Randy that's obsessed with Jamie Lee Curtis. He has some of the most memorable lines in the movie and he delivers them well and gets some good laughs. Mathew Lillard ""before he was Shaggy"" and Skeet Ulrich who are two underused talented actors are also good here too. Lillard plays Sidney's bestfriends' b/f while Ulrich plays Sidney's b/f. Lillard is whacky and nutty while Ulrich is just basically there for us to think ""is he or is he not the killer ?"" . Rose McGowan ""before Charmed"" plays Lillards g/f who is Sidney's bestfriend. She's both spunky and cute in her role and has a memorable scene with the killer. The film is one of Wes Craven's best and although I loved part 2 it's not as good as this one is. It does have  a good cast too though. Part 3's new cast fails to impress though. This one however has a great cast, is funny and is  good for a scare here and there with some gore too.",1156636800,4,2164,4.318518518518519

But as time went by the theater became packed and when the movie ended it was one of the most fun experiences in my lifetime attending the theater.

The audience was in it right from the start: from Drew Barrymore's opening sequence to the revalation of who was responsible for the killings (I won't give it away for those who haven't seen it), the audience was hooked big time.

Although I have the disc, it was extremely disappointing to not have the un-rated version. I actually owned the uncut laserdisc and although it's only about 3 minutes extra footage of the killings, fans should have an uncut anamorphic widescreen version of the film.

Since this year marks the 10th anniversary of the picture's release: maybe Dimension Films will revisit it and give the ultimate edition to fans everywhere: uncut, with new audio commentary and a new retrospect of the trilogy.

910315,5,6304675348,"Scream:

Scream was the movie of all movies my senior year of high school.  It was all most people could talk about for the longest time...  Presumably because of how realistic it was.  This wasn't a monster fest.  This was a real person, with a really messed up mind going around killing high school students!  What more could a teenager who loves scary movies ask for?

This movie is more suspense than horror, I think.  Yeah, there's blood and a little bit of gore, but that is greatly outweighed by suspense that builds up to the reveal of who the killer is.  This was one of the first movies that really kept me guessing - although I sort of had the surprise ruined for me by my best friend who assured me that I would think the killer was ""hot"" whenever I got to see the movie.  But even though she told me that, I still got tripped up in my thought processes when I was trying to put the pieces together.  Only a good suspense movie will do that to you!

Let me not forget to mention the excellent levels of comedy relief that this movie has.  Even though there's a masked murderer roaming their community, the characters in this movie still manage to deliver some pretty funny dialogue.  My favorite characters have to be Dewey and Gail Weathers!  Although Stu was also pretty funny...

In all, I thought the story for this movie was completely original (at that time), and was very well acted, directed and produced.  I have seen all of the Scream movies, but I really don't think either of the sequels even comes close to the greatness that the original movie achieved.

Every lover of horror/suspense has to see this movie.  It should be a requirement.",1146787200,2,1663,4.465116279069767

But thanks to an inventive brilliant script, direction and performances - it was a mindblower and still is... The constant references to other films and the combined forces of drama, suspense, comedy and slasher - AND THAT IT WORKS - makes THIS an unforgettable experience.

910318,5,6304675348,"Come December, Scream will be ten years old. That freaks me out. I still remember seeing this when I was a sophomore in high school. How time flies...

Kind of bashed by horror diehards when it was released, it nevertheless became a box office smash. It started a trend of some really crappy teen slasher movies during the latter half of the 90's (we're now in the age of remakes), but this definitely remains the best of the bunch. Very original, with a quick pace and a likable cast. I never understood why so many people thought it was ""scary"" back then, but it entertained the hell out of me, and still does to this day.

The DVD is pretty good, with an ample amount of bonus features and crisp 5.1 audio. But, it's non-anamorphic, which could be a pain in the arse for those of you with widescreen televisions. Since it's tenth anniversary is approaching (I still can't believe it), Dimension would do well to release an anamorphic director's cut (which I actually have on VHS... the director's cut, not an anamorphic video). There isn't a huge amount of difference in the DC, but it still retains Craven's original vision, something I think fans of this film who never owned it on VHS would like to see.

Scream seems to have become ""accepted"" by the horror community. Not because it magically got any better with age, but because some of those who used to bash it seem to have finally grown up and won't let their taste be dictated by what's popular at the moment (See? It works both ways). I'm rambling.

Highly recommended.",1138492800,2,1532,4.56
910319,4,6304675348,"With huge success throughout the 1980's with numerous horror hits, such as, ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"", ""The Hills Have Eyes"", and ""A New Nightmare"", in the mid-nineties, director Wes Craven returned to the genre that he knows best.  Though it seemed that Wes had nothing else to give in the franchise, by any original means that is, he along with writer Kevin Williamson have managed to completely rejuvenate the dying horror franchise, with a sense of freshness and originality, all the while poking fun at what had made the genre so successful.  With the help of up-and-coming acting talents, such as Neve Campbell (TV's ""Party of Five"") and Courtney Cox (TV's ""Friends""), it didn't take long for people to realize that this latest Wes Craven film, ""Scream"", was far and above anything coming out of the horror genre in recent years, and was to change the horror landscape for years to come.

""Scream"" is set in a sleepy town called Woodsboro, where everything seems perfectly peaceful and serene, that is until a murder is committed.  With the police left with no clues as to who is behind this tragedy, another murder occurs, and another, leaving the community convinced they are under siege by a serial killer.  However, when the killer targets a local girl, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), it appears she will be just another notch on the killers belt, but with a stroke of luck Sidney escapes with her life, and is now the focus of the public media circus, led by reporter Gail Weathers (Courtney Cox) surrounding this killer's rampage.  With this new spotlight shown on her, Sidney is revealed to have been responsible for putting a man behind bars who claims he'd been framed for the murder of Sidney's mother, and evidence is pointing to the possibility that maybe this new serial killer is linked to Sidney's horrific past.  Now, it seems that maybe this man, Cotton Weary (Liev Shrieber), wasn't lying after all, and that maybe her mother's killer is still out there.  But finding the killer will prove to be no small task as everyone in this small town are suspects, and no one appears to be safe from the killer's wrath.

With the release of ""Scream"", both director Wes Craven and screenwriter Kevin Williamson, were thrust back into Hollywood popularity.  Audiences just loved the somewhat campy dialogue, and tongue-in-cheek humor that the duo imbued into the movie, and the non-stop twists were enough to keep everyone on the edge of their seats with anticipation.  It was for the most part a great film, but there are however a few complaints I have with some aspects of the film.  The acting was good from the cast of Hollywood's young stars, but sometimes the dialogue should have been handled in a more mature way than just your average television show script (this problem is especially evident when Skeet Ulrich is speaking).  The gore is very present in this horror movie, which is to be expected for the genre, however at times it did seem that director Wes Craven was trying extra hard to be as gory as he could be.  I don't know if he did this to satisfy some morbid sense of accomplishment for himself to include as much blood and guts as possible, or if that is what he thought would guarantee butts in the seats, either way the ploy didn't bother most people and ""Scream"" had plenty of return business.

Overall, ""Scream"" is an entertaining horror film, with plenty of twists and turns to keep you guessing until the very end, though sometimes too heavy on the gore, it sure beats some of the other horror films that had previously been released.

""Scream"" is rated R for violence, language, and sensuality.",1136332800,2,3640,4.763116057233704
910320,5,6304675348,"I grew up watching horror films. I saw them too young and too many - and Michael Myers still scares the crap out me even when the film has nothing but crap left in itself. Writer Kevin Williamson clearly shares the same nervous fondness for the genre as myself (and clearly, many others) do - he has managed to make a movie that is both genuine scary movie and arch parody of scary movies. It's the film's very self-awareness that makes it different from all the rest. Instead of following the time-honored horror rules that it so carefully details, it leads them - the virgin is immune from death, we are told, but what if she gives it up! oh heavens that wasn't supposed to happen!

The movie begins with Drew Barrymore and goes somewhere totally different - and by the end you are so amazed that they took you there so adroitly, so smoothly, and yet with so many geniune yuks, you want to see it again! At least, that's how it was for me. The characters mock the very archetypes they end up playing - and they weave in and out of Red-Herringville with smooth abandon. A groovy cameo by the Fonz himself (as the high school principal) is a nice nod to we who have grown up freaking out that Freddy will come in our sleep. Watch for funny horror cameos and winks here and there.

My favorite moment involves parallel action between the characters' viewing habits and the reality all around them. I don't want to give anything away but it involves a van, Jamie Kennedy, and Jamie Lee Curtis. It sums up what I love about Scream. It's smart, but it's not too smart - it hands you some information and hides other information - it dances around, pointing you in the direction it wants, but upon repeat viewing it doesn't suffer like movies like The Game do.

Grab some friends, a big bowl of popcorn, check all the locks in your house...and obey all the rules! This movie makes 'em and breaks 'em! Woo hoo!",1133827200,,1904,4.418803418803419

910394,5,6304675348,"This film is, and will always remain, a true classic.

I can't really write a summary of the film without ruining it, but let it suffice to say that there is a crazed killer running around wearing a demented ghost mask, now known as the Scream Mask, and a rather horrible knife, and is trying to kill Sydney Prescott (played admirably by Neve Campbell, one of the best young actresses). And there's a lot of gore!

A lot of films like this take quite a while to get the ball rolling. Not this one. It starts straight away, within the first five seconds, as doomed Drew Barrymore's character recieves a sinister phonecall from a man who is obsessed with horror movies. Let it suffice to say that we know immediately it isn't going to be a happy ending for her.

With an all-star cast, featuring Drew Barrymore, Neve Campbell, Matthew Lillard, David Arquette, Courteney Cox and Skeet Ulrich, this is a FANTASTIC movie, and my personal favourite horror at the moment. I highly recommend it - Wes Craven truly is the master of slasher movies.",1129680000,,1038,4.6
910395,5,6304675348,"As you can read from the title this is one of the best teenage slasher flicks movies that was made in the mid 90's that I have ever seen. I wouldn't describe it as your typical horror movie. The movie is just so good that I will try to keep my review brief to not give to much away.  Directed by Wes Craven and written by Kevin Williamson; this film pays homage  to the classic 1978 horror flick Halloween and spoofs other horror movies and horror situations.

The movie starts off pretty quickly with Casey Beckert played by Drew Barrymore picking up the phone and starting a casual conversation with a stranger on the other line about movies. She is ready to watch a scary movie.  The caller get's personal with her and soon starts to torment Drew's character and says she will have to correctly answer his movie questions or her and her boyfriend Steve will die.  The beginning of the movie is just so intense its actually my favorite part. The music gets more dreadful and its a perfect way to keep the audience more interested as to what is coming up.

We then move to Sidney Prescott played by Neve Campbell who has had intamacy issues since her mother passed away almost a year ago.  Billy Loomis played by Skeet Ulrich plays the somewhat patient boyfriend who tries to get Sydney to forgot about her mothers death and to move on.  We soon learn that there has been 2 students killed who went to Woodsborough High. The teens were gutted from the inside out. The rest of the cast is introduced here. Courtney Cox plays the annoying tabloid reporter Gale Wethers who will do anything to get a story expecially this one. She wrote a book on Sydney's mothers death and made it into a best seller and Sydney now has a grudge against her. David Arquette plays Deputy Dewey Riley the nerdy cop in charge of looking into what has happened and is helping in the investigation.  Matthew Lilliard plays Stu who is Tatum's boyfriend and  Tatum is played by Rose McGowan. They are all interviewed as to how well they knew the victims. The killer soon starts to stalk Sydney by calling her at her home and finding her at her school among other places. She ends up staying at Tatums for her safety. Suspicions start to mount as to who the killer is and what kind of motive the killer or suspect may have. There are some very funny moments and memorable lines with Jamie Kennedy who plays Randy, the nerdy movie freek who works at a video store. The humor makes the movie more interesing to watch.  The killer continues killing more victims in pretty grotesque ways. The first 2 killings is probably the goriest. The students all end up going to a party at Stus house after the high school closes down due to another attempted murder.  After everyone leaves the party only a few people are left behind and this is where most of the action beginns. The special effects are very interesting too near the end. You will enjoy this film I guarantee that. I watched it 4 times when it came out in 1996. The ending is great and it will blow you away. The collectors edition includes 7 minutes of behind the scenes. These include the high school scene with Neve, Skeet, Rose, Randy and Matthew, scenes with Neve and Courtney outside of a police station, the beginning with Drew Barrymore, and near the end with Neve Campbell.  There is an interesting interview with the director Wes Craven. There are also cameos in the movie by Linda Blair ( The Excorcist) and Henry Winkler (The Fonz).",1129248000,,3470,4.506369426751593

910400,5,6304675348,"There's more than a few reasons to hate `Scream'; the main reason would be that the film single-handedly resurrected the teen-slasher genre, a movie category that had long been beaten to death. Because of the success of `Scream', witless horror rubbish like `I Know What You Did Last Summer' and `Urban Legend' got greenlighted, half the teenage casts of various WB television shows got summer acting jobs, and some awful scripts that should've been left dead and buried `Teaching Mrs. Tingle' got to see the light of day. `Scream' is responsible for a lot of garbage. But the truth of the matter is, `Scream' is also a phenomenal movie.

Director Wes Craven was perfect for this film- as director of slasher classics like `Nightmare On Elm Street', he easily sets the visual feels and style of film to perfect evoke all the slasher films of yore . . . and then, much like `Scream's' script, chooses to either faithfully follow the tried and true, or to go off in competely unexpected directions. Either way, Craven manages to create a lot of absolutely nail-biting, thrilling scenes. He also doesn't hold back with the gore, which is always a plus in great slasher films.

The best slasher film of all time is still John Carpenter's `Halloween', without question, but `Scream' actually runs a close second. It's well worth watching.",1119052800,12,1333,4.86784140969163
910479,5,6304675348,"""Scream"", released in 1996, is a great horror film that stars Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox (now Cox-Arquette), David Arquette, Jamie Kennedy, Drew Berrymore, Skeet Ulrich, Matthew Lillard, and others.  This film pays homage to many horror film classics that many horror film fanatics never forget.  Two sequels proceed.  Its release started a new frenzy of horror film fans.  It encouraged its audiences to watch the classics that influenced this film.  This later became Wes Craven's highest grossing film to date.  It received critical acclaim, including a consideration for an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay (which was overlooked).

""Scream"" desplicts a group of people in a town that is terrorized by a ""serial killer"" whose obsession with horror films goes too far.  He, she, or they call the intended victim, alters their voice through a machine, flirts with them, threatens them, and attacks them.  The police force's only lead to the killer's identity is a ghost mask.  Sidney Prescott (Campbell) seems to be the main target to this killer.  Does it connect to the brutal slaying of her mother a year before?  Does the killer want revenge, or does the killer want to play copycat?  Until the questions are answered, everybody is a suspect.  And those who break any of the horror film rules become a target.

Director Wes Craven certainly knows the true meaning of horror as he combines these films into this film, yet, fitting wonderfully.  He doesn't spoof any of them.  Rather, he creates his own horror film that is truly chilling.  He occassionally includes non-horror projects that fit the film well, including ""The Ricki Lake Show"".  Meanwhile, he adds the occassional teen humor that relates well to that age group.  Despite branching off other horror films, his creativity is expressed greatly as in his past films.  He takes the typical horror film traditions, mixes them, and makes them his own.  He makes every chase scene a roller coaster ride, every suspicious scene suspenseful, and every bloody violent scene intense.

Horror film commemorations include ""Friday, the 13th"", ""Halloween"", ""Carrie"", ""The Exorcist"", and his own ""Nightmare On Elm Street"".  Wes Craven plays a cameo as the janitor ""dressed as"" Freddy Krueger.  Through these various homage scenes, the main storyline of people being stalked by the killer is never distracted.  Meanwhile, he gives this film its own legacy beyond the now-infamous ghost mask.  While many other previous blockbuster films have tried paying homage to other films like it, this is the first that has succeeded in high quality.

Through this storyline, the actors finely express the crutial points of the film that make it more entertaining.  They scream wonderfully, they express their terror wonderfully, and they offer their own sense of humor through the perfect scenes.  Campbell expresses the terrorizing theme the highest while stretching Jamie Lee Curtis's legacy as Laurie Strode from ""Halloween"".  Cox and Arquette offer the sense of humor the most as an annoying news reporter and a police officer.  The actor or actors who play the killer or the killers offer their terrorizing moments greatly that make their character or characters more chilling.

""Scream"" begins an unforgattable fine trilogy that will hold its position in film history for a long time.  Those interested in this trilogy must watch this edition first.  Otherwise, they will not understand the storyline.  This will surely continue pleasing its audiences as it has since its release.",1115942400,,3541,5.19434628975265

910481,5,6304675348,"All horror movies are the same old predictable thing right?  They're all about the blood and gore and horny teenagers right?  Well, Scream doesn't disprove that, but it does manage one thing: to make fun of the horror movie genre while at the same time being a horror movie itself!

Scream, I'm sure you all know, is one of the movies that redefined the horror genre.  Still bloody and gory (and sorry to say but too much blood and guts ruin the scare of the movie), but the way the film is crafted is beyond genius.

A group of teens who are being chased by a killer don't realize they're in a horror movie!  In short, it's a cliched horror film in which the main characters are a bunch of teenagers getting killed.  But there's more, these are teens who know the secrets to surviving through a horror film.  From the rules of ""Don't have sex"" to ""Don't say, 'I'll be right back'.""

Yet ""Scream"" manages to break the rules.  The Killer also knows the rules of a horror movie, and at the same time those who seem to follow the rules are the ones who seem to get it the worst.  There's also a very clever twist at the end, and while it gets old to see it, the way ""Scream"" pulled it off is better than most other films.

However, I'll have to say this.  ""Scream"" is in-fact overrated as a horror film.  It IS a genius film by making fun of the horror genre as well as being a part of it, but it's not scary.  I mean come on, this is Wes Craven, meaning nothing is really scary, there's just going to be a lot of blood and gore.  Who gets scared by blood and gore?  Really, it ruins most of the creepy parts and it quickly looses its scary motive and becomes the movie about guessing who's going to die next.

""Scream"" is good, but again, it's ruined by too much blood that just isn't needed.  Horror movies are always better when they don't need to be hack and slash.  Unfortunately, that's what ""Scream"" is.  A slasher film.

See it though, you'll be quite surprised at how good the movie is.  It somehow redefined the horror genre, but it'll never hit the mark that ""The Sixth Sense"" left.",1114041600,2,2090,4.262086513994911

Some parts are scary: like when Tatum gets killed in the garage at Stu's party. The most scariest part is in the begining when Casey Becker gets killed. It's the best part in the whole movie.

910483,2,6304675348,"Dimension/Miramax/Buena Vista is an interesting combination. Miramax as a DVD division of Buena Vista (aka- Disney), usually turn out excellent DVD's. However, Dimension distributed the film Scream, and they are usually called upon to produce the lackluster second-rate material that comes Miramax's way (Dolph Lundgren films, and endless sequels to the Hellraiser, Halloween, and Children of the Corn franchises). And Dimension films on DVD usually get the same treatment Buena Vista's Touchstone and Hollywood studios- crap. Yes, usually widescreen. But the transfers are nearly always lackluster and the discs contain absolutely no features whatsoever.

So here comes Scream on DVD, and it is with almost no consideration whatsoever, that the version of this film we are left with is not very good at all. This is not the definitive version of Scream, not by a long shot. This studio, regardless of it's having been founded by Miramax and partly operated by the Weinsteins themselves, has taken it upon themselves to butcher this truly exceptional and excellent horror-thriller.

Most VHS copies of the film were of the uncut, unrated version of the movie which contains 3 key scenes of extended gore. 1: Steve the footballer boyfriend's intestines spill out of his torso and flow over his lap while he squirms in the chair, whereas in the cut version we see his guts just sitting on his lap. 2: Kenny the cameraman's throat is slit in extreme-closeup and blood trickles all the way down to the collar of his shirt, whereas the cut version both removes a closeup shot of the shock in his eyes as the knife slices him, and shortens the trickle of blood by more than half of it's full-duration. 3: The killers slice each other up. The cut version removes about 3 shots of Billy cutting up Stu, and also a frame of Sidney's father next to a puddle of Stu's blood on the floor as it drips from his arm, that seems to also have tiny chunks of flesh in it.

These cuts hurt the film a lot, since it's been argued by many hardcore horror fans that Scream doesn't appeal to the gorefans when it really has a lot going for it in that department. Plus, the psychological aspects of the film are hurt by alternating points of view away from what's happening to the killers and showing Sidney's reaction instead, also shortening that so we don't even see how Sidney is handling this. In both versions, we get that Sidney is upset and repulsed by what she sees. And no more in this cut version.

Then, even in Dimension's re-release of Scream to DVD in the 2000 Scream DVD Trilogy boxset, they couldn't manage to make Scream's widescreen transfer anamorphic. Which itself has been enough of an error that Universal saw fit to re-release their The Thing: Collector's Edition on DVD. Dimension/Buena Vista saw fit though to give the fans a few nice little extra bonus features- like several trailers, over a half dozen TV spots, a special FX conceptual art photo gallery, cast/crew profiles, and a really dinky little trivia section that reads strongly on the NO DUH! register for fans of this series.

The audio commentary with Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson is a carryover from the UNRATED laserdisc edition of the film, and is a gem. Because these participants don't know it, but what they end up adding is the ONLY SIGNIFICANT making-of/behind-the-scenes info Scream fans have ever received. Oh yeah, I forgot there are a few more features- 2 very brief behind-the-scenes footage clips set to really bad 'alternative' songs, and a Q&A with the cast and crew as they answer 2 questions (""What's your favorite scary movie?"" and ""Why do people like scary movies?"").

More needs to be said about the audio commentary. A lot of horror fans have said some really stupid things about Wes Craven, and it's really not fair since a lot of serious film fans (people who usually turn their noses up at horror films) don't regard him as a quality filmmaker either. This commentary proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that Wes Craven is probably the greatest director horror has ever seen, and an accet to the creative community. Especially because his insights both as having over 25 years experience as a filmmaker and as a college-degree psychology teacher/professor, are some of the most home-hitting to why horror gets so little respect and why it is so important as a film genre.

Also the audio commentary gives us Kevin Williamson at his most talkative regarding the conception of Scream, and is a very valuable note since it is without a doubt his only quality work as a screenwriter. Wes and Kevin together are a truly powerful couple of experts, Wes's experience makes up for what Kevin lacks. And this commentary no doubt gives us a lot of food for thought on why a good deal of the scenes in this film are some of the most daring and groundbreaking to be tried in a horror film in nearly 2 decades. But there are a couple disturbing gaps of silence (though they aren't nearly as long on repeat viewings), and it still manages to leave the viewer with a lot of questions.

I was hoping that the popularity of the new Craven-Williamson film Cursed would give Dimension/Buena Vista reason enough to seriously considering releasing Scream again in an amamorphically-enhanced widescreen version- of the UNRATED video/laserdisc version. Then again, maybe not... But there are reasons to have hopes high either way: The Weinsteins recently finished splitting with Disney, and get to keep the Dimension films name & catalog of films. Maybe this alone is enough to get the definitive version of Scream out there...

The Trilogy Boxset is a must-buy if you're a fan of this series. Since Dimension was more than stingy the first two times around with bonus features, there's a bonus disc with 4 and a half minutes of hilarious outtakes, a really fluffy 30-minute featurette on the making of the film that has the feel of a slightly more personal talking-head promotional companion that they used to show on HBO (and doesn't go into nearly enough detail into matters like, how many times the film was resubmitted to the MPAA for rating issues), and most importantly screen test auditions for Neve Campbell and Skeet Ulrich.

I hope Cursed doesn't get the royal shaft like Scream did when it comes to DVD. I mean, Cursed was just that, cursed to a disastrous future of mangling to be a box office PG-13 hit and twisting of the original vision of it's creators. What hopes lies in the future for Cursed on DVD? Hopefully, Buena Vista will remember that they do have those disclaimers on DVD packaging: BONUS FEATURES AREN'T RATED(!), and we'll be able to see the copious deleted material for the movie.

For Scream? Most likely, not another release. Though it certainly does need it, since it's still without a quality documentary on it's making. And it doesn't make sense, since Sony/Columbia-TriStar has released over a dozen different versions of Men in Black on DVD, and have also updated their release of The Craft and I Know What You Did Last Summer to include new bonus features. What keeps those heads at Dimension standing still?",1112400000,,7115,4.814238952536825

There's even a line in the film: ""Nightmare On Elm Street was great but all the sequels suck."" or something like that.

That's the second movie that I've seen (first being Donnie Darko) that she's played this sort of undeveloped character.  Anyhow the movie keeps you guessing until the very end as to who ""Scream"" really is.  I first thought that the principle (Henry Winkler is great) was the killer.  They make you think someone is the killer, than you change your mind, than you change your mind again and again until the end.  It's a good movie, and I've got the sequel with me ready to watch, I'm itching to see it, but I doubt that it'll have characters as good as the first movie or someone who looked as much like Johnny Depp as Neve Campbell's boyfriend in this film.

910591,4,6304675348,"Scream is one of the most clever horror movies to burst onto the screen in years. Unlike other horror movies, Scream manages to be extremely terrifying at some points, and delightfully clever at others, as the characters make subtle references to past horror classics. Our story begins at the Becker residence, where Casey Becker is getting ready to watch a scary movie. Until she suddenly gets a call from an unknown person inquiring her favorite scary movie. After having a brief talk about horror movies, our unseen character lets it slip that he is watching Casey, and is someone near the house. This is where the true terror begins, and the story begins to get interesting. The killer now knowing that Casey knows he is near threatens to gut her boyfriend [who he has captive on the back deck] unless she can answer a question about a scary movie correctly. Upon getting the question wrong, her boyfriend is gutted, and the killer begins pursuing Casey. The next day, we meet up with Sydney Campbell, a friend of Casey's who is crushed by the murder. It doesn't help that Sydney is recently mourning over the loss of her mother a year ago, and her boyfriend Billy might just be the murderer. With a killer on the loose in the town, some of the high schoolers decide to have a party to celebrate that they don't have school because of the deaths. With rampant partying going on, no one seems to notice that the killer is among them, killing them off. It all boils down to the final fight between Sydney and the killer, who has his own reasons for wanting Sydney dead. Although many may be turned off by the explicit violence and blood, and others may not like it just for the fact that it's a teen horror movie, that's no reason to miss out on one of the scariest movies ever.

910593,4,6304675348,"I gotta say, first and foremost, this is pretty much just another slasher movie.  Sure,  there are 2 fairly brief scenes in which the characters discuss the supposed conventions of slasher films, and fairly frequent references to them at other points, but this hardly qualifies it as a parody or a sorta post-modern dissection of the genre.  Furthermore, these verbal references don't really seem to affect the action of the film to any substantial degree: Cut them out and leave everything else the same and all the critics would've completely ignored this film, and accussed it of just being a retread of all the old 80's slasher films.  And they would've been right.  What we have here is simply a slight twist on the old genre, not a re-invention.

Fortunately, being a slasher film is nothing to be ashamed of, and this is a good one.  Most notably, the opening scene is simply brilliant.  The phone conversation part of it is actually very well written, and performed surprisingly convincingly.  Even the whole quiz aspect of it works pretty well.  And the murders themselves are extremely intense and brutal, if not actually that gory, and it ends on a truly unnerving image.(though I've always been particularly disturbed by hanging corpses, so maybe that's just me)  Personally, I think this to be an almost perfect horror set-piece, and they couldn't possibly have hoped to top it. Sadly, they don't come at all close, but the rest of the movie is pretty good.

I won't bother going into the plot, other than to say that the killer's identity is a mystery, and the final revelation is actually pretty satisfying.  A bit far-fetched, and the viewer couldn't reasonably be expected to be all the pieces together based on the evidence we're given, but it's still pretty cool.

The characters and acting are usually alright.  Neve Campbell is pretty bland as the protagonist.  I don't empathize with her much, but I don't hate her either.  In fact, this is true of pretty much all the characters, though there are a few exceptions.  Most notably,  Matthew Lillard has got to be the most annoying actor on the face of the earth, and I cringed every time he came on camera.  Fortunately he doesn't get all that much  screentime.  Rose McGowan falls into the hot but very obnoxious category, but she doesn't actually play that huge of a role either, so she ain't too big of a problem.  David Arquette annoyed me quite a bit the first time I saw this movie, but viewing it again he's alright.  Characters who we're supposed to like because of how incredibly dorky they are usually don't work for me, but he's actually kinda likable.  (Perhaps I've come to terms with my own dorkiness)  Also, the Fonze does a nice job in his small role as the principal, particularly in the scene where he's attacked.(which is  his only major scene)  Very, very reminiscent of how I remember acting when I've become senselessly scared of nothing.(Course, turns out he had reason to be afraid... )  Other that that, nobody's worthy of much mention, which is fine cause slasher movie aren't about acting.

The film could stand to have been cut a bit.  There are some effective scenes throughout the middle portion of the movie, but there's a bit to much nothing as well.  These 'nothing' scenes aren't necessarily too boring individually, but as a whole they just drag the pace a bit too much.  Still, this movie manages to generate a fairly oppressive atmosphere when it's actually tries to,(particularly the music) so it's a bit more versatile than lots of slashers.  Sadly, it still has a few too many senseless jump scenes, but that just comes with the territory.

The later horror scenes generally work pretty well, even if they aren't in the same league as the first.  Craven actually holds back on some of the standard stalking-scene techniques, most notably the perspective-cam, which is nice because it makes these techniques more effective when they actually are used.  Sadly, the second best horror scene comes only shortly after the first, where Neve is called by the killer.(I'm having an impossible time remebering the characters names. Sorry)  Lots of people dislike the climax, but I think it's pretty good, largely because I think the final revelation satisfying enough to carry the scene.  Scream hasn't got a whole lot going on in the creative death front, generally being satisfied with knifings and a few actual shootings.  There's one odd death, which I won't give away, which is kinda cool.  Not that great, but still pretty decent.  It isn't terribly gory either.  There's a wee bit of guts, but other than that it's pretty much just characters being covered with blood.(It's really hard to believe that this was only 20 seconds away from an NC-17.  Well, alright, I've not actually seen what they've cut, but I've read descriptions, and even that stuff doesn't seem like it could be extreme at all, saving one shot)  Still, the deaths are pretty intense, and occasionally cringe-inducing, so they work well enough.

Well that's it.  5 stars for the opening scene, maybe 3.5 for the rest.  4 stars overall.",1097798400,,5113,4.8229885057471265

910668,4,6304675348,"Casey Becker (Drew Barrymore) innocently answers the phone as she prepares to watch a scary movie. She doesn't recognie the voice on the other end, so she hangs up. The person persistantly calls back and says that if she hangs up gain, he'll gut her ""like a fish"". He then tells her to look on the back porch.

 She does as she is advised and discovers her boyfriend on the back porch with his insides on the outside. She begins to run, but doesn't get far. She makes it outside but then the killer stabs her in the chest. Her parents find her blood corpse hanging from a tree shortly after.

 Everyone is talking about the murders the next day at school. That night, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), whose mother was brutally raped and murdered one year earlier, gets a disturbing phone call from the same voice. The killer gets into her house but she just barely escapes.

 The killer continues to try to murder Sidney throughout the movie. He also tries to kill other people, including Sidney's best friend Tatum Riley (Rose McGowan), ""Top Story"" correspondant Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox), Deputy Dwight Riley (David Arquette), Sidney's boyfriend Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich), Principal Arthur Himbry (Henry Winkler) and others. This shows that the movie had a good cast. There were a lot of talented actors such as the ones mentioned above, which helped make the movie better.

 The kills are done rather well. Most of the deaths come from a result of a knife wound or in some cases a gun shot. There are some pretty creative ones though, such as the death that takes place in the garage scene.

 It's nice to see a regular phychopathic killer going on a murderous rampage, rather than some superhuman freak that can't be stopped. Another good aspect about the movie is the sense of mystery as to who the killer really is. You have your suspects throughout the movie but you don't find out who it is until the end. As Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy) says in the movie, ""Everybody's a suspect!""

 When you finally find out who the killer is, it's a bit shocking. Then the motive and cover up is revealed. This is when everything comes together.

 I like how the theme of this movie was that they were living out a scary movie. The aforementioned Randy, horror movie fanatic, gives us the three rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie. They are usually true and pretty acurate. However, there are exceptions, as proved in the movie. The rules are as follows:

 1. You can never have sex -- ""sex equals death""

 2. You can never drink or do drugs -- ""the sin factor""

 3. Never say 'I'll be right back' -- ""you won't be back""

 The movie also makes reference to and/or mentions multiple horror movies. These include Halloween, A Nightmare On Elm Street, Friday The 13th, Prom Night, Evil Dead, Psycho, and Carrie, among others.

 Wes Craven, the man behind A Nightmare On Elm Street, directed all three of the Scream movies. In fact, his name is mentioned in the film and there is a janitor wearing the old freddy sweater and hat ensemble. It doesn't live up to Nightmare, but not many movies do.

 In my opinion, Scream is easily the best movie in the trilogy. It had a pretty big impact on moviegoers and was pretty successful. The 'ghost face' mask is like the present-day equivalent to Jason's hockey mask or Freddy's glove. Everyone can recognize it and tell you what movie it was from, even if they haven't seen the movie. Scream is probably one of the best horror movies of the 1990's.",1090886400,2,3527,4.6032

Apparently some school boards had agreed, thinking it was going to be another cute teen comedy a la SIXTEEN CANDLES, this time with America's sweetheart Drew Barrymore.  Wll, Craven and his screenwriter Kevin Williamson pulled a similar truck on world moviegoers who came to see this film expecting nothing and instead experienced an unusally intelligent, even chic blend of comedy, horror and the self-aware postmodern, with fine performances from everyone involved (OK, except for Skeet Ulrich).

After the first showing, we never looked back, and we spread the word that Craven had made a fantastic comeback after a few stinkers and disappointments.

A new inventive story about 5 teens who actually knew what was going on.  Heading the cast is Neve Campbell, Rose McGowan, Courtney Cox, and David Arquettet.  It is a retrospective look back on Halloween with a 90s twist.  The film is clever in every aspect and actually the killer turns out to be an everyday person, and not the insane mental patients, like Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers, and Leatherface.

For instance the janitor that the principal yelled at Scream was chasing him, was wearing Freddy's sweater and the principal called him Fred. Also when Cindy was talking to Tantum she said that this wasn't some kind of Wes Carpenter movie. Well that was two different directors Wes Craven who directed Scream and John Carpenter who directed Halloween. Also it was funny when the guy sitting on the couch kept telling Jamie Lee Curtis that Micheal Myers was right behind her when Scream was right behind him. Of course he was one of the bad guys so Scream wouldn't have killed him. Courtney Cox played the typical snobby reporter who only cares for the well being of her carreer. The acting in this movie was excellent but before you see this one see Nightmare on Elm Street Halloween and Friday the 13th.

910750,5,6304675348,"In 1984, Wes Craven brought us the incredible A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. In 1996, he brought us the unbelievable hit SCREAM. Some horror fans look at this movie as a joke. When I look at those people, do you know what I see? @ssholes. This is an excellent piece of work, and very original.
  Drew Barrymore plays CASEY BECKER, who gets this weird phone call from an unknown guy. The unknown caller begins torturing CASEY and then kills her boyfriend, STEVEN ORTH, and just when you thought that Drew was going to be our leading lady who survives this whole ordeal, the unknown caller then kills her.
  Neve Campbell plays SIDNEY PRESCOTT. Sidney is our leading lady. The year before, Sidney's mother was brutally murdered. Sidney accused a man named COTTON WEARY. The next morning, Sidney arrives at school and notices the whole campus is full of police cars and reporters. Sidney's friend TATUM (played by Rose McGowan) tells her what had happened. After school, Sidney and Tatum are sitting on a bench with their boyfriends BILLY LOOMIS (played by Skeet Ulrich) and STU MACHER (played by Matthew Lillard) and their friend RANDY (played by Jamie Kennedy). They are talking about what kind of questions they were asked during their individual interregations and then they talk about their whereabouts the night before.
  That night, Sidney is planning to spend the night at Tatum's house. She gets a call from Tatum saying that she is on her way. She hangs up with Tatum and gets a call from the killer. The killer then comes in and attacks Sidney. The killer suddenly disappears, but her boyfriend Billy appears. She thinks he was the one who attacked her. Luckily, Tatum's older brother, DEWEY (played by David Arquette), who is cop, shows up to Sidney's rescue.
  The next day at school, the principal suspends every class due to everything that has been going on. Dewey arrives on campus and begins talking to ambitious reporter GALE WEATHERS (played by the beautiful Courteney Cox Arquette).
  That night, Suu throws a party. The party goes real well, until Billy shows up. He and Sidney get to talking and the two... you know... After they finish, Billy becomes the killer's next victim, sending Sidney running around looking for help. Gale and Dewey, run to the house. Dewey goes inside the empty house to check everything out, while Gale gets inside her news van to call the sherriff for backup, unaware that her cameraman had just bit the dust. Seeing her dead cameraman sends Gale crashing into a tree, leading to an ending that sets the stage for its stunning sequel, SCREAM 2.
  This is a movie that I have enjoyed for the past eight years (I still can't believe this movie is that old). Whatever you do, do not listen to what some people might have told you. This is an outstanding movie with a 100% original concept. Buy it and you'll see what I am talking about.",1075680000,,2877,4.720558882235529
910751,5,6304675348,"I'd like to begin my review by clarifying a few things about some other reviewers' complaints. First of all, ""SCREAM"" is not a ""rip-off"" of previous slasher flics. Actually, it is an homage to them. It clearly knows that it is using the same situations as some previous horror movies, and it humorously pokes fun at its slasher-genre routes. Secondly, it is original, as much as it spoofs other movies. Because, you see, in this movie, the characters KNOW they are in a horror movie, and they have some knowledge of what to do and what not to do in this kind of situation. Once the ""rules"" of a scary movie are stated, they begin breaking all of them, and that is a twist. Another twist is the ending, which I won't give away, but let me just say it was very well done (although it was VERY violent). This movie is marvelous. The acting (including Drew Barrymore, Neve Campbell, Skeet Ulrich, Jamie Kennedy, Rose McGowan, Courtney Cox, David Arquette, Matthew Lillard, and cameo of Henry Winkler) is exquisite, the writing is comical and horrifying at the same time, and horror veteran Wes Craven directs excellently. The thrills and chills are actually GENUINE. It's very frightening and ominous at times, but the humor will make it fun for people to watch. There is a lot of blood, though, and most of it is chillingly realistic, so be ware, seriously. The DVD features are very good, including a very engrossing commentary by Wes Craven and brilliant screenwriter Kevin Williamson, lots of trailers, and more!",1074902400,,1512,4.752851711026616

However I thought the plot just went downhill after the opening sequence. The ending didn't satisfy me and in my opinion, it was a tad humorous but I felt it had a demented and crude side to it. The ghost-face villain was sometimes creepy, but had no atmospheric movements like other killers in other similar films did. I thought the film was pretty good, especially the opening sequence with Drew Barrymore, but the film went downhill quite a bit. I just think it got a little too many they-like-it-so-i-will-like-it reviews which made me a little disappointed. Otherwise, pretty good.",1073952000,,764,4.7518796992481205

Hello?! This is an INTELEGENT horror/thriller/suspense movie if I ever saw one!  It plays with your mind, it makes fun of other horror films, and at times it even makes fun of itself.  Having the sense of humor that I do, I find that entertaining.
My one complaint, and this goes for the entire series even, is that there were time during my first veiwing of the films that I was plugging my ears and half closing my eyes, expecting the killer to suddenly jump out of nowhere-yet this never really happens, or at least not often enough to be considered a movie that makes you ""Jump out of your seat"", except maybe with laughter.  It did keep me on the edge of my seat, though.  But repeated viewings will probably not do that, since I now know there's really no big ""scares"".  However, I now own the trillogy because I find it to be very clever, and it does have all the other horror elements aside from pure sudden scares.

I saw it with friends when it came out and I knew it was going to be an amazing movie with great sequels. The plot is just so origional, and it makes perfect sense and it's hard for anyone not to like it.
Sydney Prescott is in highschool, with a boyfriend, friends, and a good dad, but things go wrong when her class mates turn up slaughtered. Soon, Sydney finds herself in the middle of a brutal killer, who turns out to be the one person closest to her, her boyfriend and his best friend. They blame Sydneys mother for sleeping with his father, and breaking up the family. And now Billy wants revenge.
This moive has so many twists and turns and scares, it has to be one of the best slasher flicks out there.

They were the first of the slasher films that had characters that had watched other horror movies.

There are references to movies like ""Carrie,"" ""Nightmare on Elm Street,"" ""The Exorcist"" and many more. So it is pretty cool to watch kids realize that they are actually in a horror movie situation and try to figure out what to do. The third movie is pretty good as well. Even if the movies don't scare you all that much, they are all really likable, and I would reccommend them to any horror movie buff.",1067731200,2,742,4.544776119402985

This movie IS the original teen slasher, a mix of humour and suspense, that will leave you terrified all night. Although it is not as good as its sequel, Scream 2, I feel that Scream is much funnier, and more clever.
The movie is about a group of teenagers, and one by one people in their high school are being brutally murdered. Neve Campbell plays the starring role as Sidney Prescott, a teenage girl who is being stalked by the killer that murdered her mother. The movie also includes Countney Cox, as annoying and persistent News reporter Gale Weathers, and David Arquette as the dim-witted cop, Dewey. The film also features a cameo performance from Drew Barrymore, who's appearance made the film a smash hit, even if she was only in it for 10 minutes!

910887,2,6304675348,"A surprise smash hit when first released, the first installment in Wes Craven's Scream series is overrated to this very day.  It's not scary one bit, and some of the characters are so annoying you'll actually be cheering for them to meet their bloody demises.  All that aside though, Craven does manage to put some ingenuity into the film by attempting to deconstruct the teen-horror genre outline and instilling some of the main characters with actual intelligence, something in the later installments of film series' like Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th was lacking.  Scream has a few quick moments of brilliance here and there, but all together it's pretty much predictable mainstream shlock horror.  The second film managed to be better than the first, but the third and final (?) film was the worst of the series.  The cast features Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, David Arquette, Skeet Ulrich, Drew Barrymore, Jamie Kennedy, Matthew Lillard, Rose McGowan, and Henry Winkler.",1067558400,,989,5.080246913580247
910888,5,6304675348,"When Scream was released in cinemas back in 1996 it provided a much-needed injection of life into the horror genre. It was a movie with all aspects of horror rolled into one and also managed to stand out from the crowd as the most original and enjoyable slasher flicks in years. Although the creepiness and scary moments of this film are debatable, the clever incorporation of pop culture wit and humour is undeniable. You only have to look at horror films from the past 30 years to see the influence they have had on Scream, yet you only have to look at films in the post-Scream era such as ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" and ""The Blair Witch Project"" to see the influence that this film has had on the world of cinema and the horror genre on the whole.

The phone calls come thick and fast in the film, and they work very well by creating the sense of ambiguity that every viewer will try to solve. The killer revealed at the end is certainly unexpected. When I first saw the film, I could not have predicted who the killer could have been. Of course as you are watching the film, you run through all the potential serial killers in your head, but you never imagine the outcome. This isn't your average slice and dice horror film, where the killer has no reason to kill his victims. He has his reasons, yet the delve into his mind is never fully understood. We can only take his word that what he's doing is some act of revenge or jealously. It all seems like a down and out killing spree where he kills not because he has to, but because he wants to - he likes to. The Scream mask that has no eyes or nose but one long white mouth is totally iconic and has definitely earned its place in cinema history. It's this screen play that makes the film. The man behind the mask is clumsy, and this is where the humour is based. The killer isn't someone who always knows where his victims are. He tries to think he does, but he doesn't and the results are very humorous. This also rubs off on the killer's clueless victims.

Despite a fantastic script, even the best of films will fail without a decent cast and Scream is luckily blessed with some of Hollywood's cream of the crop. Neve Campbell plays the lead of Sidney, while Courtney Cox, fresh off her ratings success on hit comedy Friends, is spot-on as the self-centered and arrogant news reporter. David Arquette is annoying at first, but he does grow on you towards the end as the dim-witted deputy sherriff. A young Drew Barrymore is awesome in her short ten minutes at the beginning of the film of which she is responsible for the iconic status the film has achieved. Rose McGowan is perfectly cast as Sidney's best friend, while Skeet Ulrich and Matthew Lillard play their roles brilliantly and are the perfect horror couple! I don't think that in a horror film you could come up with a better cast of characters, all unique in their own way, and that is perhaps the secret behind the success of Scream.

OVERALL GRADE: 10/10

In 1996 I was nine years old, so I obviously didn't see this film when it was first released. In about 2000 I saw it for the first time, and loved every minute. I am very into the horror genre, and Scream scared the pants off me! Now that I'm older and just turned 16, I don't see the film as very scary, but more for its comedy value. Three years ago, my friends would laugh their heads off watching Scream and I'd be like, ""How can you laugh?! It's terrible what he's doing!"" I'm totally different now! I don't know why I'm saying this because I can't imagine anyone in their teens or 20's who hasn't seen Scream before, but if you haven't, just give it a go. It's a classic.",1067040000,,3663,4.358711566617862

  Please do not get this film mixed-up with Scary Movie (2000).  Scary Movie was a comedy, a parody that spoofed the 1996 film ""Scream"".  Scream (1996) can out at the right time.  They quit making the Friday the 13th films, Halloween films and Nightmare On Elm Street films (although temporarily).  Then this film Scream (1996) suddenly became a hit and was the most talked about film on television at the time.  The film begins with the now classic scenes of Drew Barrymore.  If you've had any hardships like this in your life, I would not watch this film.  The film HALLOWEEN (1978) is paid homage to by the creators of Scream.  I truly believe the film Scream gave someone the idea of bringing back Jamie Lee Curtis and the ""Michael Myers"" character again for Halloween: H2O 20 Years later (1998).

Well...I didn't find this SCARY-OR-FUNNY...I was a little dissapointed about how there were only a couple chase scenes...I could have easily watched this at night (instead of 10:00 a.m., as I chose to do...), and gone to sleep deeply and peacefully...So...WAS this soppoused to be a comedy?!?!?! I didn't find it funny AT ALL! My sister, who I was reccomended this by, saw as more of a comedy...of course, I thought maybe for scary-movie buffs, because they're soppoused to be a lot of refrences to past ones...but shes certainly not one of those!

910894,5,6304675348,"Scream is a pretty darn good movie.  If someone was to view it now for the first time, it might seem old and unoriginal, because they have seen a dozen other slasher films from the late 90s.  However, those people might forget one key fact.  SCREAM WAS THE FIRST MOVIE TO USE THE TECHNIQUE AND STYLE IT DOES.  There have been SO many other countless imposters after it that simply cannot live up to it.
A lot of reviews say Scream is not scary at all, from what I've read.  They point out it is a satire.  YES!  IT DOES MAKE FUN OF THE HORROR GENRE.  But, there are also scenes of complete terror in Scream.  Horror and Comedy are closly linked because they are probably the two strongest emotions that humans feel.  An example is after an audience screams from being startled, they usually LAUGH.  Scream pushes all these buttons by being a satire and a horror film in, it's own right, all at the same time.
I will make this point: I WAS TRULY SCARED BY SCREAM.  No, I'm not a whimp, as another review stated you were if Scream scared you!  I have sat through all the horror classics other reviews reccommend over Scream like Halloween, The Exorcist, The Shining, The Ring, the original Haunting and Rosemary's Baby.  While I admire them all and think they're great films (with the exception of The Ring, which was just ok), none of them came CLOSE to scaring me the way Scream did.
Maybe you ask why it is scary?  Because, in so many ""killer"" movies, the stalker just silently lumbers around at a slow pace and hacks everyone up.  In Scream, the killer now has a cell phone at their fingertips.  There was added thought to the script to have to put words in the killers mouth, truly chilling words.  And not only that, Scream's killer is very realistic because he/she/(don't want to give anything away) runs, trips, falls, and acts just plain old human.  Not only that, there is an uncanny sense of humor that the actor gave to the masked figure that makes you want to laugh and scream at the same time.
Also, SCREAM HAS SOME EXCELLENT ACTING IN IT!  People critize Rose Mcgraw, David Arquett..etc, but HELLO!  Did any of those harsh reviewers ever see the amazing performance Drew Barrymore gave in her opening scene?!  It was truly one of the most terrifying moments in horror history, and has rightly taken it's place among classic film scenes.
Perhaps Scream should be rewarded most for reinventing the slasher genre.  In a time when the countless Halloween and Friday the 13th sequels were being made, along came Scream with its witty writing and stylish directing from Craven.  Also, at least Scream was smart enough to stop the sequels after number 3, to form a nice trilogy.  I believe that the saying goes ""the highest form of flattery is reproducing a persons work.""  Then, because of all the imitators that Scream gave birth too, there is a lot of praise it has received.",1055808000,,2884,4.551456310679612

It's just too modernized, too hip to be taken seriously.  I enjoyed the light comedy and the countless references to horror movies, but this isn't a masterpiece.  It also doesn't help that the main stalker (""Ghostface"") just seems too down-to-Earth, and I think that any of the teens could (with a little luck) have escaped him, or even murdered him.  Another low factor was that Neve Cambell's character sometimes turned this into a laughable melodrama.  It's a fun movie, but probably not worth a buy.",1055548800,4,641,4.844036697247707

Needless to say, that very same character does just that while being pursued by this films killer.

There were also many scares and shocks, like when...well...I'll leave you to watch them! ^o^

That is a good starter, but I think the plot could've had more details to it. Like telling about her mother's life, and Sidney's childhood, etc.

Scream is an absolute diabolical terrifying movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat from the first second to the last scream.
It starts pretty easy with a fabulous Drew Barrymore who receives an anonymos phone call and she thinks he's out for a flirt but what he really wants is to play a deadly ""who wants to be a victim"" quiz and when you play this quiz, you don't have a fifty-fifty joker.
Now after the terrible murders have been committed at the edge of Woodsboro, a peaceful town (or so it used to be) in sunny California, the police thinks that they are related with the brutal death of Maureen Prescott, mother of Sidney Prescott, which happend nearly a whole year ago. Maybe they aren't so wrong. One day later Sidney is attacked, and everyone suspects that it's her boyfriend who pops up the second she has been attacked. But when he's in jail, she receives another phone call. Now everyone is a suspect and everyone could be a victim.
For Sidney's protection her friends organize a party where the three rules of surviving a horror movie are confronted with every party guest:
1. You can never have sex.
2. You can never drink or do drugs.
3. And never ever under any cirumstances say ""I'll be right back""...because you won't be!
With these words the killing spree has begun, after all tomorrow is Maurren Prescotts ""one year death anniversary"". And the killer will do anything to have Sidney dead on that day!
Filled with loads of shocks, great acting, a stunning music score, a slam bang showdown, an original screenplay, a sensational opening sequence, and a great ""who dunnit"" ending, this movie gets a full five stars! (Would have been six)

It was so nice to see this film after the string of terrible sequels (Halloween, Friday the 13th, and Nightmare on Elm Street) that were made in the 90's.
What made it even better was that this film paid homage to many, if not all, of the films I mentioned above. There was just the right amount of humor mixed in with the jumps and gore.

911043,3,6304675348,"This movie/franchise started the entire Teen Slasher/Horror movie craze and it was O.k. Let's be real for starters, all slasher movies in general either have no plot or very little plot and SCREAM is no exception to that rule.
Exactly 1 year ago, from the start of the movie, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) helps put the killer of her mother behind bars. Now a year after the conviction, 2 teens are brutally killed in similar fashion to her mother. Now the question is, who's behind it? Is it the killer that killed her mom and that they have the wrong guy behind bars or is it someone else?
I'm giving this a 3 because this was a basic hack and slash movie and the mystery surrounding the killer wasn't done well because the investigation for the killer was left a little flat. Plus by the last 45 minutes of the movie, you pretty much had it figured out.
Another thing that bothered me about this movie was that it was way too cliche' even for a Teen slasher. Why is it that when the killer is trying to kill a busty, female victim, she runs for her life and puts up the biggest fight whereas when the killer stalks a male victim, the guys go down in a heartbeat? The contrast just isn't there and there's really no gray area.
It's still decent enough to sit back and watch but I personally wouldn't go into this one with too many expectations because this is a pretty basic one. Nothing's too complicated in this one and each victim's demise is pretty basic as well (with the exception of 1). Rent this one first, see what you like and if you like it, by all means, check out the rest of the series.",1040947200,,1604,4.332225913621262

I mean how many movies have a girl get crushed in a garage door without making it look totally corney... but... Wes Craven and the rest of the Scream crew pulled it off so it was actually scary... something that many horror movies lack these days.  Scream is like the original ""Halloween"" film of the 90's  Overall I would say Scream is an excellant horror film and I would recommend it to any other slasher movie fan.",1040774400,,694,4.433070866141732
911045,5,6304675348,"Scream provided the horror genre with a significant shot in the arm when it was released in 1996.  This movie was a whole bunch of horror films all rolled into one, yet it was also quite original and unlike what had come before.  Along with the undeniable creepiness and suspenseful nature of the wonderfully complex plot, Scream brilliantly incorporated pop culture and humor.  It paid homage to its antecedents, referring to 14 different horror movies of the past, incorporating scenes (and that powerful Carpenter music) from Halloween into the plot itself, citing the unspoken rules of horror movies, and sneaking in great cameo appearances by Linda Blair and ""Fred"" the janitor (played by Wes Craven himself).
The phone call from the killer gimmick works very well here, providing Scream with its own peculiar trademark.  I certainly had no idea about the true identity of the killer at the end, and I was thrilled to discover all of the rich nuances fuelling the entire killing spree. Scream is not your typical slice and dice flick with an easily identifiable bad guy and a plot that serves no more purpose than to provide an excuse for killing people.  Script writer Kevin Williamson is a veritable genius, a man whose love of horror movies fuels him to put together a story that will involve the audience's mind as well as its emotions.  The manner of murders are refreshingly varied, partly because the masked killer is so doggone clumsy most of the time and has to rely on devices other than his shiny big knife.  I found the suspense level of every important event almost perfect.  The soundtrack also adds strength to the whole effect, featuring great tracks such as Don't Fear the Reaper and Red Right Hand (which was originally used in a classic X-Files episode).
Of course, even the best script will fail without a talented cast, and Scream is blessed with some of Hollywood's best performers.  Neve Campbell is of course the perfect Sidney; Drew Barrymore is largely responsible for making Scream's opening scene such a memorable one; Courteney Cox is the perfect self-centered tabloid reporter; David Arquette is actually likeable in his role as the somewhat dim-witted deputy sheriff; Rose McGowan is the quintessential best friend (and a total knockout); Skeet Ulrich and Matthew Lillard play their roles perfectly; and the character of Randy Meeks, the self-proclaimed horror expert, is one of my all-time favorites.  Even the Fonz himself, Henry Winkler, plays a part in the film.  I don't think you could put together a better overall cast for a horror movie, and that is one of the real secrets of Scream's success.
No matter how many times I watch Scream, I never fail to get completely drawn into the suspense.  The DVD makes the experience even better with its load of goodies-a number of trailers, Wes Craven's commentary, some behind the scenes footage, interviews with cast members about the movie, cast biographies, trivia information, etc..  One really interesting note about this film is revealed in the credits: this movie was made ""No Thanks Whatsoever To: the Santa Rosa City School District Governing Board""  because the school board backed out of its decision to let part of the movie be shot at its local high school, citing the film's excessive violence.  I believe this movie does what horror is supposed to do: draw out your own fears and negative emotions, transfer them to the screen, and send you away feeling invigorated, refreshed, and glad to still be alive.",1040342400,,3506,4.938775510204081
911046,1,6304675348,"Having established himself as the best and most mischievous film maker currently working in the dead-babysitter horror genre, Wes Craven (of the 'Nightmare on Elm Street' films) is in the mood for parody. So 'Scream' winks at everything from a virginal heroine in a flowered cotton nightie to 'the moment when the supposedly dead killer comes back to life for one last scare.' Along the way, proving it's not too detached to get down to business, 'Scream' also finds time to disembowel a pretty young victim or two. Scream is Wes Craven's latest horror film with a gimmick that just doesn't quite work. It opens, in traditional slasher film fashion, with the young, pert, and alone Casey having a ""terrifying"" (yeah right, I laughed through the whole thing and so did my friends) encounter with a homicidal caller. The killer then sets his sights on Sidney ), a distraught and whiney whoa is me teen who has been standoffish since her mother's brutal murder a year ago. The film continues in its predictable path, as the killer moves gorily from victim to victim. The twist in Scream is that the characters acknowledge the cheesiness and predictability of horror flicks, and even outline the flaws and imperfections. Unfortunately, this self referentiality doesn't quite work, for Scream falls into the same boring and thoughtless patterns as prior movies of its ilk. Sorry people, but this movie WASN'T SCARY AT ALL! However it wasn't a complete waste of time. I did enjoy this movie, and thought that it was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. This film might have been scary if it hadn't made fun of itself. How do you expect a person to take a movie seriously, when it doesn't even take itself serioiusly? So basically if you're looking for a very scary and disturbing movie, look elsewhere, but if you want an enjoyable movie that you can laugh at and just have fun with, then see this.",1039737600,2,1898,4.772036474164134

While the above statement is true, There is no denying that this movie was influential.  Some would say that the teen slasher genre pretty much was over with ""Halloween II"" a long time ago, but people have liked these movies for over twenty years now, so good or bad, it's a subject matter that people are interested in.
What ""Scream"" did was add new hipness to the slasher flick.  Two different characters in the movie make fun of the bimbos who literally ""flash and die"".  They are aware of the ""rules"" of the game, and as their pals are being run through the carving bar, they are able to analyze their role in the play, and make their moves to increase their own chances of survival.
This was a brilliant move.  And Rose McGowan and Neve Campbell became a new breed of slasher movie actress.  I know this is all silly, but these movies have their own little world, and there really are rules.  These ""new breed"" actresses may still get chopped up, but darn it, they know why, which makes them liberated in my book :).

Scream 2 and 3 also were creepy but part 1 was the best. I have the 'widescreen series' DVD, it has a commentary track, a theatrical trailer and movie recommendations. The movie kicks off with Drew Barrymore (cUtE as hell), is getting harassed by a crazy prank caller obviously in her back yard. Helpless Casey? No! If she would have not stopped so many times to see her parent's coming she could have made it to their car. Sidney plays the quiet, incredibly annoying protagonist who someone is desperately trying to kill, the killer even tries to kill her in the restroom! Anyway, no turn is safe and anyone can be the killer! Scream is probably the best scary movie of the nineties through 2002. See it, it will definately at least entertain you if you like mystery and thrillers and if you like those teen high school slashers.

911097,5,6304675348,"So, ""Scream"" is a ""postmodern slasher movie"" which ""cleverly deconstructs horror films.""  These are certainly weighty accomplishments because tossing around concepts like ""postmodern"" and ""deconstruction"" will usually confuse the heck out of people on this side of the Atlantic.  Actually, I do not find ""Scream"" to be terribly postmodern, at least not in the sense of being self-reflexive, which is the usual shorthand meaning of the term in media studies (the sequels are considerably most ""postmodern"" than the original).  However, the film certainly does reference the teenager horror/slasher film genre, which makes the idea of deconstruction more palatable.  Then again, maybe we can use Occam's Razor to offer a simpler explanation.
""Scream"" works for three basic reasons.  First, it is clear that each of the victims in this film is being slashed to death by an ordinary human being (please appreciate how delicately I phrased this part of the sentence) and not a person possessed by the spirit of Samhein, reincarnated as a killer corpse, or running around in our dreams.  Instead of the killer being a monstrous ""other"" this time around the killer is essentially...someone...like...us.  Scary notion, that.
Second, the script by Kevin Williamson is, if not literate, at least hip.  By this I mean to reference the dialogue and not just the idea that the threatened teens in this film make use of everything they have learned from watching ""reel"" horror films.  Of course, Williamson has proved this ability to an even greater degree on ""Dawson's Creek.""  In ""Scream"" we wince at what is being said because we are supposed to, not because it is an involuntary response.  However, I would say the comparison between Williamson is not with Quentin Tarentino (""Pulp Fiction""), but rather with Joss Whedon (""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"").  Along similar lines I would add this is a horror film where the suspense is not maintained by the soundtrack, which may well be the most under appreciated warning sign of a bad horror film.
Third, the cast for this film is well above average.  I mean, this is a film that throws away Drew Barrymore in the opening sequence; go back and look at the splatter flicks of the last twenty years and find a better damsel in distress what Drew does in her absolutely riveting moments on screen.  This is a film that offers Neve Campbell and Rose McGowan in terms of young actresses instead of Adrienne King or Heather Langenkamp.  You have to go back to ""Halloween"" with Jamie Lee Curtis and P.J. Soles to find scream queens this bankable.  This is also the quality that has extended itself for both of the sequels in this series as well as all those ""I Tied a String Around My Severed Finger to Remind Me What You Did Several Summers Ago.""  Horror films that off up Sarah Michelle Gellar in supporting roles are a good sign for the genre.  Good actors with decent dialogue; what a revolutionary concept.
Consequently, I view the preoccupation of fans and critics over the rules of slasher flicks articulated by Jamie Kennedy's character to be something of a smoke screen for what is really going on here, which, in the final analysis, is just basic good old fashion solid movie making.  I think the credit ultimately goes to director Wes Craven, who used his credibility off of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" to put these pieces together.",1036627200,4,3370,4.911816578483245
911098,5,6304675348,"Legendary horror movie director Wes Craven (A Nightmare on Elm Street) does an excellent job of reviving the good old-fashioned ""scary Movie"" genre that had been missing for several years.  A very good cast of actors, including Neve Campbell (Sidney), Skeet Ulrich (Billy), Courtney Cox (Gail), Drew Barrymore (Casey), Rose McGowan (Tatum), and David Arquette (Dewey) give top notch performances in this movie.  The overall premise of the film is good, too.  I also enjoyed the way that classic horror films such as ""Psycho"" and ""Halloween"" were blended in.  This is good old fashioned suspense and terror at its best. The plot is excellent and there are a lot of twists and turns that will keep the viewer  glued to the screen throughout.

Well, if I can steal a line from ""Pet Sematery,"" sometimes dead is better.
Overall, ""Scream"" is an overdone and overrated teen slasher film whose primary distinguishing feature is its satiric cuts at its own genre.  All the familiar horror staples are here, and the characters that live the longest are the ones who realize they're living out a horror movie and play by the rules.  Largely camp, ""Scream"" does boast some genuinely scary segments well-orchestrated by legendary horror master Wes Craven, particularly the Drew Barrymore scene that opens the film.  But mostly it's just silly, with all the weaknesses that always doom slasher pix:  too many vapid, sex-starved teens, a reliance on cheap gore instead of real chills, and a lot of low-brow ""humor.""  Moreover, ""Scream's"" killer is a terribly inefficient killing machine.  Ghostface often bungles his murders by running or falling over every obstacle in sight, and even when he catches a victim can't figure out how to finish them off.  Neve Campbell's character is likeable, resourceful,  and attractive, but given her inferior competition it's not hard for her to stand out.
""Scream"" is a big disappointment, and no matter how many teens swear otherwise it's nothing a horror movie should be.  For a more mature thriller, check out ""The Sixth Sense"" and leave the screams for the kids.",1029715200,2,1463,5.012396694214876

We get to see Drew Barrymore in her finest perfomance since her critically acclaimed roles E.T. and ""Firestarter.""  We get to see Matthew Lillard in the role that made him one of Hollywood's most annoying stars since Gary Busey.  To top it all off, we get to watch the identical twin of Johnny Depp, Skeet Ulrich, act in one of his brightest roles ever. Truly, Scream is a work of unmatchable art.
Now for some serious critique. Scream is not scary and focuses far too much on the slash 'em up techniques that Freddy and Jason wore out in the eighties. This film is nothing more than a remedy to a boring evening at home. There is nothing frightening about Scream. No, it is hardly on the same lines as some other great slasher films, unless of course, you enjoy predictable killing scenes and harshly detest Drew Barrymore.
Why two stars instead of one? The opening sequences are a fine part to this movie but unfotunately the film continues on a downward spiral from there on out.",1029456000,,1394,4.568

Never have sex or you'll definitely be killed. But this is no, 'Scary Movie' parody.  There is blood, gore, and some very tense and scary moments.  Characters do get killed.  And since they're all aware of the rules of horror flicks, it makes it much more interesting to watch how they try not to fall into a horror flick trap.
As far as the DVD is concerned, this is not an *ANAMORPHIC* transfer like Scream 2 and Scream 3. I totally do *not* understand why that is.  This is the best film of the three and deserves the best everything (transfer, extras, etc.)  It is however shown in widescreen letterbox format (2.35:1 aspect ratio,) so you won't miss out on any details.  The picture and sound are near perfect.  Again my only complaint was that the movie was not presented in anamorphic widescreen.  Extras are limited to commentaries by Wes Craven, trailers, cast biographies, and some film facts.  Not great, but not bad either.
I would definitely recommend getting the Trilogy set.  That way you can watch all three movie and see how it ends...",1027814400,,1228,4.587155963302752

Now that's graphics. Wes Craven is so awsome,from Swamp Thing to Nightmare on Elm Street to scream he's awsome. Hey,did you know that in all three scream's the people die in the beginning are on the cover. Drue Berrymore in the first one Jada Pinkett and Cotton in the third,now you now.

911185,5,6304675348,"Scream is undoubtedly horror's milestone. It did wonders for the horror of the late 90s. Much like Halloween in the 70s, it set up the formula for horror movies after it. Even though many horror movies overused that formula.
  Everyone knows the plot. And it's simply basic. Someone is killing a town's teenagers, and it's obvious the killer is obsessed with movies. But there's a whole different story behind that simple plot. And it's handled in a way that brings true horror to real life. Kevin Williamson wrote a great script, with the wittiest dialogue I've ever heard in a movie. I honestly think every little wink to movies and every snappy comeback said in Scream did not come off corny at all. Half of that success is due to the talented cast. Neve Campbell is our heroine, and becomes much like that of Jamie Lee's Laurie Strode. Courtney Cox-Arquette and David Arquette met on this set, and their chemistry is shown greatly. I love the couple. Matthew Lillard and Jamie Kennedy supply most of the comedic relief during the darkest tones of the movie, and do it well. Skeet Ulrich plays the boyfriend to a tee, and his resemblance to Johnny Depp from Nightmare on Elm Street is crazy. And the awesome Rose McGowan. She was also great. And all thanks to Drew Barrymore for giving us one of the most intense scenes in a horror movie. And I don't believe Scream's horror movie tone could not have been done without Wes Craven. This is definitely his movie, and it shows.
 Scream's DVD presentation is certainly a good disc. An undoubtedly entertaining and insightful commentary is given by Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson. Although an additional one from the cast would have been a nice addition, but I'm not going to complain. There are many behind-the-scenes vendettas to explore, and the usual theatrical trailers and tv spots are also available.
 Six years after its release, Scream has already gone down as a horror classic. Actually, the whole trilogy is classic. Although the two sequels are nothing in compare to Scream.",1026604800,,2035,4.789173789173789

Although it was influenced by many slasher flicks of the 70's and 80's (HALLOWEEN, PROM NIGHT, FRIDAY THE 13TH, etc) it still remains a fresh new horror film in it's own right. It brings the quality that all of the old slasher films,(people getting killed left, right and centre, by someone in a mask and a really big knife) along with many of it's own. Namely it's comedy.
The direction is good from Craven, but it is helped immensely from Kevin Williamson's witty script. The perfomances throughout are very strong, but it's Jamie Kennedy as movie geek Randy who comes up trumps, stealing all the prime lines from the leading lady Neve Campbell.
Scream 2 and 3 don't even come to close to this masterpiece.  Like Jamie Lee Curtis once said ""the original is always best"".

The hardcore fans of Scream will claim its a clever satire, when in fact the comedy feel to the movie derives not from satiristic intent, but rather from its trying to be a hip teen flick.  Its characters apply to every stereotypical teenager.  There is a tough guy (Ulrich), a movie nerd (Kennedy), a hot innocent girl (Campbell) , a hot slut type (Mcgowan), a funny cool guy (Lillard), and theres even one of normal guys whos trying to get with a hot girl whose out of his league (Arquette and Cox).  The script is as sterotypical as the characters.  The average 14 year old girl will tell me that they never knew what was going to happen in this ""clever"" script, when it is in fact as expected as its two ridiculous sequels.  The killers are magical Wizards.  Even if its impossible for them to pop out, they do- just like their sequels.  I could call this movie a failure, but its not.  Craven accomplishes exactly what he is trying to- ridiculous pop horror flick that will get him a bigger office and a higher budget for his next films.  The fact that this shamless garbage provoked several others of its kind (I Still Know What You Did, Scary Movie, Final Destination, Urban Legends...the list goes on)makes it even worse!!",1021334400,6,1370,4.44
911192,1,6304675348,"For me, ""Scream"" is just a gore, teen, stupid, oversexed and horribly overrated version of John Carpenter's classic, ""Halloween"". More than a homage, it's a copy. Remember: 'Go to the McKenzie's house, call the police'. Doesn't this remind you something? Sure it does! There's nothing new in this movie, nothing at all. The main characters are just pretty, baby-faced and very willing fans of horror movies who don't ask for much else but getting stabbed and the killer's suit is grotesque, making him look more like a mental creep than a ghost (and ridiculized by the Wayans Brothers in their raving film, ""Scary Movie"" - Wazaaaaaah!) And what about the killer himself, what about his personality, his UNIVERSE? We're pretty far away from ""Seven"", ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and also ""Halloween"" where Michael Myers becomes a killer only at the age of 6, and loses his humanity after a 15-year stay in a psychiatric hospital. In ""Scream"", young Billy Loomis turns suddenly into a mass killer and guess why? Only because his father betrayed his mother, who moved away and abandoned him! For a serial killer, the motive is very thin, and for me, it's not enough...
The ending is disappointing, if not ridiculous. All those characters who get killed but come back, just because they're 'good', as a matter of fact it makes them unhuman, look like Michael Myers himself, some kind of undestroyable people, and this is dangerous and no good... That female reporter who crashes in her van but comes back to save Sidney just in time, that goofy teenager who gets shot in the chest but comes back to life just in front of Sidney, in perfect condition, that police officer who's stabbed in the back but is found alive, on a stretcher... what d'you want me to say? This happy ending's too big to be honest. In ""Halloween"", Michael Myers is the only one to come back, because he's not human any more, the others die for good, they won't be coming back, and that's logical. ""Scream"" is maybe a homage, but it's abusive and not logical. And that's why it's disappointing and, above all, a nuisance for kids.
The only positive element of this failure is an astounding young actor, Skeet Ulrich. The rest is no new and no good. ""Scream"" is the movie that not only (re)started the horror movie fashion in the 90s, but also started the teen - stupid and immature - movie style itself. Such horrible movies like ""American Pie"", ""Not another teen Movie"" or ""Harvard Man"" wouldn't have been made without ""Scream"".",1021248000,3,2497,4.76905311778291
911193,5,6304675348,"It gave birth to a series of horrible movies (I Know What You Did Last Summer, Urban Legends) but watch it. It's a very clever, funny, exciting, and YES, scary movie. I mean can you watch that very beggining scene with Drew Barrymore, in your basement, at mid-night, and not be scared? That scene's a real masterpiece, and kicks the movie to a very fast start instead of wasting time on nothing.
Don't get me wrong, the movie is really fast paced, but it's got great character development. Each character in this movie is well developed and realistic (I'm not kidding).
The plot isn't quite your usual ""stupid scary movie with lots of hot girls showing their breasts off and having sex while smoking pot and getting slaughtered by an unkillable, emotionless killer,"" no. Scream has a plot. A year ago, Sydney Prescott's (Neve Campbell) mother (Lynn Mcree) was brutally raped and muredered. Sydney fingers Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber), and why shouldn't she? She saw him leave wearing his bloody coat and all evidence points to him. However, when Steven Orith (Kevin Patrick Walls), and his girlfriend Casey Becker (Drew Barrymore) pop up dead late one night, and Sydney's friends start dropping dead, she begins to suspect that maybe she fingered an innocent man, and her mother's killer is still on the loose. But, who's the killer?
Scream co-stars W.Earl Brown, Courteney Cox (Courteney Cox Arquette), David Arquette, Rose McGowan, Skeet Ulrich, Matthew Lillard, Joseph Whipp, Jamie Kennedy, and and cameos by Wes Craven, and Linda Blair.
I know I said this movie isn't just sex, nudity, murder, and gore, but it delivers in some areas (don't get all excited, no nudity). There's a truckload of gore (even more if you can get the director's cut) and lots more guts then I had expected to be in a movie of today. The death scenes are elaborate, well staged and exciting. Even better, we actually care about the teens in this movie. They're likable because they all know that they're in a horror movie and the ""rules.""
The cast is excellent, each actor does great. Neve Campbell does sympathetic teen really well, Rose McGowan (as her friend with a variety of skimpy outfits, Tatum) does great. The off-beat boyfriend (Skeet Ulrich) is played well. All the other actors are great, but it could take hours describing them all here.
kevin Williamson really did great with his script here. He doesn't think to much of himself like he does now, and givers the movie a never ending energy. Wes Craven (A Nightmare On Elm Street) brings the film to life vividly and I wasn't bored for a second. No dought he helped all the actors in looking scared (marvelously) and the opening with Drew Barrymore must be seen to be believed. That's what I call scary!
The DVD (Dimension Collector's Series) is a keeper, despite having some minor problems. One of the (minor) problems is the non-anamorphic transfer. Being an owner of a widescreen TV, this annoys me, but the picture is still genuinely good. It's crystal clear and free of blemishes and grain. It just would have been better with an anamorphic transfer. Still, good picture quality. The second problem is that the version on the DVD is the original theatrical version, and not the director's cut mentioned above. There isn't to much of a difference, but there's more guts, blood, and gore in the unrated version. Just a little problem, again. Nothing extreme.
Those problems are basically nothing when you come to the good stuff about the disk. The great commentary by Kevin Williamson and Wes Craven (also on the earlier disk) is here, and it's a real pleasure. I've listened to it several times and still get a kick out of it. They both seem at ease and point out interesting facts I never noticed about the movie. Other features are two trailers (red band and green band) and over five TV spots. there's a short production featurette and a behind the scenes thing that's interesting. There's a cool special effects gallery. Also, you can ask two questions with the cast and crew (""Why are people so fascinated by horror movies?"" and ""What's your favorite scary movie?""). There's also a ""Did You Know"" section that gives out some interesting facts. A nice array of special features.
The films remastered in a booming, beautiful 5.1 surround sound that will please all. Dialouge is clear and easy to understand and the action sequences are loud and exciting.
Scream's great. I am not ashamed to like it. It's one of my favorite movies and I find it clever and witty. Forget those people who diss this movie and see the masterpiece (the Oscars for 1996 really missed this one). Also, the two sequels are almost just as good. I'd recommend getting the box set (I own it, and love it) because it has an exclusive Collector's Edition of Scream 2 and a bonus fourth disk.

I love it. I love this genre. It may not be your high-class film full of social commentary and important messages hidden within the plot (although i'm sure some people would indeed argue that it is. and they would find no real argument here) but nonetheless it is an excellent film. I have never had such fun watching a film. When i go to the cinema, or rent/buy a video from the store, i am looking primarily for enjoyment. A film which will entertain me and keep me riveted and excited. As such, this film is fits the mold perfectly. There is little doubt that films such as this are just fun fun fun all the way. You just sit back, let it all wash over you, and enjoy the enthralling ride every twist of the way.
as well as being a hugely entertaing film, it is one which pays some kind of homage to all films in this genre which have gone before.

I still laugh out loud hearing that line.  Wes Craven's Scream is a tribute to all the eighties horror, especially Halloween (itself a tribute to Psycho).  A young girl alone one night gets menacing phone calls from a man who is apparently watching her as he talks (When a Stranger Calls!).  The killer, wearing a white mask, attacks her (Halloween).  As he goes in for the kill she reaches up with a dying hand and pulls the mask from his face.  As she does we see a slight hint of recognition in her eyes.  Now THAT'S an opening.  Already they've established a solid whodunit wrapped around a slasher film.  It just gets better from there.
We meet Sydney Prescott (Neve Campbell, cutest girl ever!) and her boyfriend, Billy (Skeet Ulrich).  After some witty banter between Sydney, Billy, friends Tatum and Stu, and local film-geek Randy, the same killer attacks Sydney.  And right now if you're a slasher fan you think you've got it figured out.  Sydney trusts one of the characters absolutely after her attack and you just know it's him!  That's when Craven and writer Kevin Williamson pull the rug out from under you.  It can't possibly be him because all signs point to him!  They've used your own expectations against you.
That's the brilliance of Scream.  Some critics will tell you that Scream owes its success to a sort of self-reference and ironic view of horror.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Scream owes itself to a solid story and mystery, good performances, and excellent direction just like every other genre of movie.  Check out the slasher films that followed with the same tone and lesser writing, acting, direction, and you'll see what I'm talking about.
I watched this movie in a theatre on opening weekend in 1996.  There were maybe 12-15 people in the theatre.  The most recent movie I had seen in a theatre at that point was Halloween 6 and it was a similar crowd.  Like everyone else in the theatre that night I felt disappointed.  We had gone in expecting the fine cuisine of Michael Myers and had come out with the bitter leftovers of dying genre.  The audience I saw Scream with came out happy and talking about getting in line to see it again.  Quite a contrast!
Scream opened in something like 5th place at the box office that weekend.  By the next weekend it was third. ...That's the kind of thing that happens when you make a really good movie.

Scream has a typical horror movie plot with plenty of blood and butcherings, however, it also has a mystery throughout the movie on who the real killer is. Also, throughout the movie, they make plenty of references back to some of the classic horror movies such Halloween and Psycho. Scream was big enough to spawn two sequels and I believe is the reason movies like I Know What You Did Last Summer and Urban Legend were created.

This 1996 effort written by Kevin Williamson and directed by modern fright master, Wes Craven, truly is ""clever, hip and scary"" in its ability to successfully combine elements of horror, mystery and comedy into one nice, neat, little blood-soaked package.  Along with an exceptional leading cast, ""Scream"" also features strong supporting performances from both David Arquette and Courteney Cox, as well as an unforgettable cameo appearance by Drew Barrymore.  Buffs of the genre will also have fun picking up on the various references to older films which helped pave the way for this modern horror ""classic"".  Two sequels soon followed, ""Scream 2"" in 1997 (the better of the two) and ""Scream 3"" in 2000, neither of which are necessarily bad films, but they're certainly not able to compare to the original as far as wit, character strength and story development go.
However, as is the case with any ground-breaking motion picture, numerous rip-offs and imitations are bound to follow.  A slew of ""whodunnit""-type slasher flicks have been released over the course of the past few years in an attempt to cash in on the popularity of the ""Scream"" franchise, including films like ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", ""Urban Legend"", ""Valentine"" and the direct-to-video quickie ""Bloody Murder"", all of which range from being merely mediocre to downright awful.

But after being bombarded through the media about how original and clever ""Scream"" is, the curiosity got the better of me and I watched it.  What I found was exactly what I expected--self-satisfied, star-driven teen slasher fair with occasional (and I do stress, occasional) wit and nary a thrill.
""Scream"" starts out with a boring, suspense poor scene that must last fifteen to twenty minutes.  In this scene, we find an overly ""endowed"" ...teen (Drew Barrymore) harassed by threatening and relentless phone calls from someone with a sinister voice.  After director Craven feels he has generated enough ""suspense"", the film finally cuts to the chase to reveal Barrymore's boyfriend, his entrails sitting in front of him.  A few ""terrifying"" moments later, Barrymore meets a similar fate.
The rest of the film is pretty much just a slasher/whodunit with the film's hip, baby-faced cast (Neve Campbell, Skeet Ulrich, Courtney Cox, David Arquette, Rose McGowan, etc) struggling to catch the serial killer before they become the next victim.  Along the way, Wes Craven sprinkles little tributes and references to other directors and films of the horror genre.
Ironically, the film is a victim of the same cliches it so vehemently reviles.  I found it to be painfully predictable, and knew who the killer was the first moment I saw him.
As a slasher film, ""Scream"" is decent.  There is some humor which fans of the genre will find amusing, and even though it did not induce so much as a muscle twitch on me (scary films just do not scare me), others will probably find it thrilling.  Nevetheless, the film was much over-hyped and not nearly as smart as advertised.",1016150400,,1763,4.929054054054054
911241,5,6304675348,"It's hard to know where to start with what has rapidly become not only a movie that revolutionised its entire genre but also has become a cult classic.  It has spawned many, mostly inferior, imitators, two sequels and put Drew Barrymore and Wes Craven back on the map.  It starts out with what could possibly go down as one of the greatest teaser sequences in all movie history.  The twist in this horror flick though is that the killer and the victims are well versed in how to survive a horror movie and in the backlog of classics that they often dip into.  Therein lies the trick - if you know your movies well enough then you can survive.  For example, the killer whispers menacingly down the phone that his victim can get away if she can name the killer in `Friday The 13th'.  There's a whole lot of films that are referenced here, not least `Halloween', `Prom Night' and `Nightmare On Elm Street'.  The script by Kevin Williamson is a sure-fire winner with plenty of black comedy thrown in with its genuinely scary plot.
 Another thing that sets this apart from other movies is its cast, all of who are spot on.  The majority are virtual unknowns although unfortunately have found it difficult to make a statement elsewhere in the industry.  Neve Campbell as the resourceful heroine is continually astounding, as are Skeet Ulrich as her boyfriend, Jamie Kennedy as the movie geek and Courtney Cox is a role that's thankfully very different from her character in TV show `Friends'.
Right from the very beginning the movie manages to subvert its genre with its characters pointing out how clichd horror movies usually are.  Most importantly though, it manages to be a hit to both an audience that are watching for pure entertainment and to one that understands its various nods and winks to the genre.  This is not only a classic of horror cinema but a classic in its own right.",1013299200,,1882,4.635542168674699

Drew Barrimore is amazing as the terrified Casey, who innocently chats with the murderer about horror movies, until she realizes what is going on... But the most amazing (and I mean it!) performance of the movie is Skeet Ulrich as Billy Loomis. He just moves so smoothly between the innocent guy, who is wrongly accused (the way he looks at Sidney in the police station, like he's going to start crying any second) to the 'bad boy' look with the 'evil' shine in his eyes when Stu and him are scaring Randy at the video store, or in the final scenes when they're chasing Sidney around.

These are real characters with real lives and real everyday things going on in their lives, who happen to get mixed up in this horrible situation. This is what's on the news. This is real. The movie goes for characters and scares, not excessive gore or nudity. The film is obviously a tribute to ""real"" horror/suspense films like ""Halloween"", and ""Psycho"". That's what we've needed. The premise of a killer in a mask stalking teenagers is nothing new, but that doesn't mean it can't be new or fresh or scary. You just have to have a good script, direction, music, and acting. This film has all four. It brings back true terror to the genre that hasn't had much in the last few years. Scream has taken some flack from real gorehound horror buffs who slam it for being too safe and funny. I find that rather sad. It's too bad Scream had to have a backlash because it's smart(obviously),and had great direction from Wes Craven at the top of his game.

911402,3,6304675348,"The crowned king of horror is back, and after a disappointing run with the Eddie Murphy vehicle ""Vampire In Brooklyn"", Craven has hit pay dirt with a movie that is ironically a satire of his own work in the horror genre.  Charmed by first-time screenwriter Kevin Williamson's whimsical draft, Craven partnered with the young go-getter and on a budget of $15 million made a film that grossed over $100 million in the United States alone.
Craven is not one to waste much time giving us the goods when it comes to his freaky flicks.  In the fashion of ""When A Stranger Calls"", a young pretty blonde named Casey Becker (Barrymore) answers her telephone in the early evening hours in Woodsborough, a small and virtually crime-free town.  Sudden danger is the furthest thing from her mind as she tends to her popcorn on the stove, prepared to watch one of her favorite scary movies.  She lifts the receiver and almost immediately is hounded by the menacing tone on the other end of the line, forced to participate in a maniacal game of horror movie trivia to save her own life.  Unfortunately, she gets a question wrong and she, along with her hapless boyfriend Steve, are the first in a long line of doomed souls.
Although the movie begins with Casey and Steve's brutal demise, the main focus of the film is on Sidney Prescott (Campbell), a precocious high school student whose mother was brutally raped and murdered barely a year before.  Once Sidney and other Woodsborough natives get wind of the gruesome homicides the town becomes a media circus.  The high school campus alone is swamped by local authorities and insatiable reporters, amongst them all a particularly rapacious tabloid journalist named Gale Weathers (Cox).  Gale is no stranger to the town's history - she cashed in on Sidney's misfortune by writing a tell-all chronicle of Maureen Prescott's murder and declaring that Cotton Weary (Schreiber), the man who was indicted, is innocent and that the real killer is still at large.  Since then, Gale has become Sidney's worst enemy and she makes it known with her angry fists.
Besides her battles with Gale, Sidney becomes the Woodsborough killer's focus and is relentlessly taunted by his menacing phone calls, not to mention his ghoulish get-up and gleaming butcher knife (which he adeptly wipes clean after each kill).  All the while, her boyfriend Billy Loomis (Ulrich) becomes the prime suspect and she begins to wonder just who to trust.  The body count continues to rise and before you know it, it seems that Sidney has no chance of survival.  But like all good horror movies should have, there's a juicy twist at the end and we discover the raison d'etre behind the killer's exclusive list of victims.
Upon a first viewing, avid horror fans or ing&eacute;nues to the genre will be on the edge of their seats all the way and jump at every surprise around the corner.  To a seasoned movie critic, a stark realization comes very quickly as to just how tongue-in-cheek this film is but Craven's directorial style still manages to grab you like the rest.  There's a lot of inside jokes sprinkled evenly throughout the film that horror movie aficionados will appreciate; Craven even dares to make himself the butt of a few jokes to show what a healthy sense of humor he has.  Williamson's screenplay has the characters assuming a rather blas&eacute; attitude in the beginning, even amidst all the subsequent chaos.  Not only do they have frank discussions about mutilated bodies but one of them even coaches the others on the key elements to surviving a horror scenario.  Laughing in the face of death is an approach Craven and Williamson gleefully experiment with the whole way through.
""Party Of Five"" veteran Neve Campbell is the beleaguered Sidney Prescott, investing her character with as much personality as possible.  A lot of what she does here is get upset and - of course - scream her lungs out.  There are times when I think she's not putting enough into her role, but I have to realize she's playing a teenager and it's a much more realistic portrait than, for example, the ridiculous traits that the neophytes of Dawson's Creek are endowed with.  Skeet Ulrich fairs well as Billy Loomis, the boyfriend that is ever under suspicion.  He's a fairly handsome chap but someone PLEASE get his hair out of his eyes, for crying out loud!  Those scraggly bangs that never seem to stay tucked behind his ears were quite an annoyance for me, not to mention his constant upward glances when conducting his dialogue - he seldom looks a character full in the face.
Aside from Rose McGowan's continually tacky sense of fashion, she's the worst performance in the movie.  Her delivery is so snide and her character is such a twit that you wish Tatum were added to the body count earlier in the film. Matthew Lillard is overblown with his obnoxious surfer boy shtick (which can also be seen in ""She's All That"").  This is one of his worst performances, not to mention his most grating.  Like Tatum, I prayed for Ghostface to skewer Stu in the first half hour.  David Arquette is the strangest casting choice of all and he seems paranoid every minute he's on camera.  I kept thinking to myself, ""What the hell is wrong with that guy?  Get him some Valium, for Pete's sake!""  Fortunately, Courtney Cox is the luminary of this mediocre troupe as the love-to-hate-her Gale Weathers, a part completely out of type from her sunshiney role as Monica on ""Friends"".  She gleefully takes advantage of the cutthroat nature of her character, playing her to the hilt with her mega-bitch aura ever intact.  Consistently clad in vivid-colored ensembles and fire-engine red lipstick, Gale is a force to be reckoned with and she lets no one forget it.
I have realized that after seeing this film for the third time, it's not the acting that's to be commended but the general idea.  The concept alone is the movie's greatest asset and without it or its innovative creators, ""Scream"" would've choked on its own breath.",993772800,,6008,4.7972841901066925

Score: 98/100
Not since Alfred Hitchock's 1960 masterpiece Psycho has a horror tale been so thrilling and refreshing as Scream, a psychological thriller with all the right ingredients. The only way for this movie is to go up in time, and since 1996, Scream has already become one of the most memorable, amazing films ever put to screen.
For Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), being a teen in a `90's life is hard. Her mum was brutally murdered when she was an early teen, and her father is continuously away on business trips, never really sparing much time for his daughter. Add to that, she has a spooky boyfriend Billy (Skeet Ulrich) with an overload of hormones, and you have a young woman on the verge of collapse. But, it's not until Sidney's mothers story is brought back to life by yet another series of murders in her hometown Woodsboro that Sidney's life really starts to fall to pieces. As each of her friends are picked off by the ghost-masked serial killer, Sidney is rammed in the head with emotional and mental impact.
In one moment or another, the characters in Scream seem to point the finger at themselves and it becomes part-obvious part-guessable who the person behind the sharp end of the knife is. Either way, the movie is still endlessly fun to watch, one that I have seen at least a dozen times. When you watch it, your head spins, and you lose your mind with all the frightening hoo-hah going on. Wes Craven controls the film like a master, and Kevin Williamson's script brilliantly spoofs off our old favourite horror movies, while at the same time being it's own movie, with all new original ideas. The performers are great, Neve Campbell brings Sidney stunningly to life, she plays the best heroin ever put to cinema. Also on the hot-hand is Oscar-worthy Rose McGowan in a sarcastically amazing portrayal of Sid's best friend, Tatum who is slowly slipping away from her long-time mate. Matthew Lillard is excellently uncontrolled, David Arquette is silly and amusing and Courteney Cox plays tabloid pest Gale Weathers with eagerness and greatness.
Scream is an ingenious piece of cinema, not to be missed by anyone who has a major or occasional interest in film.",985478400,,2195,4.778947368421052
911507,4,6304675348,"Watching ""Scream"" is like taking a trip the movie store and browsing the horror section, recalling all those old memories of horror film stories that were truly inspired. It contains all the classic elements of a horror thriller, and here's a new twist: it plays all of the tired horror clichs to its advantage, giving it a new and fresh feel that makes it innovative and intense. Featuring an all-star cast, ""Scream"" is one clever and intense suspense ride that is crowd-pleasing and fun.
All the suspense and terror begins with the murder of two high school students in the small town of Woodsboro. The victims' gruesome deaths touches a chord with Sidney Prescott, also a high school student, whose mother was killed a year ago in a quite similar manner. Soon, she begins receiving phone calls as well as visits from a person dressed up in a black cape and ghost mask, with a voice distorter to hide their true identity over the phone. The movie plays frequently on Sidney's emotional instability in certain moments, but through it all, she remains a strong character that we have no problem rooting for when the good gets going.
As the bodies pile up, the police start asking questions. The school turns into a secondary police station as students are put through questioning, while outside, reporters are crawling like ants on a sandwich to get the scoop on the latest news. One such reporter is Gale Weathers, whose book on the murder of Sidney's mother has sparked her aspirations into high gear. Her confrontations with Sidney give us the real spark of the suspense: Sidney's accusations against the man that she thinks killed her mother were the reasons for Gale's book, and while she would like to disbelieve, there is no turning her back on the fact that the killer may still be on the loose.
The movie never really has a point at which it decides to pick itself up and move faster; from the beginning it keeps us involved immensely, giving us many thrills, jumps and chills. The screenplay, written by Kevin Williamson, is one of the fresher horror scripts to come out in a long time, and under the direction of horror master Wes Craven, the film has nowhere to go but up. The movie has a lot of surprises, and while it's not one of those nightmare-inducing type scary movies, it scares us by making us jump as well as peaking our interest as to what the plot is going to do next.
This is what makes it so clever: it never gives away any of its secrets until such time as it is necessary. All the fingers point to at least two different suspects at each moment of the movie, proving and disproving theories and accusations as to whether or not the presently accused is really the killer. Even the characters themselves point fingers to their own guilt. In the end, when all the secrets are revealed, will you find yourself gasping in awe at who the killer actually turns out to be.
The movie also is unique in the way that it plays on all of the past horror film clichs through its dialogue and following twists. Even one of the characters, the film store worker, Randy, stands up during a party to deliver a speech on the rules of surviving a horror movie. His education in the horror genre serves for a lot of insightful dialogue into horror movies of the past, and the movie uses this to its advantage by having its characters act in the ways he warns them against. The movie's message is simply one of ""Don't say that people running up the stairs is silly, because what would you do?""
The all-star cast is full of bright faces (when they're not smeared with blood) that know the material and know how to play it out. Neve Campbell plays the terrified Sidney Prescott, in one of the better roles of damsel-in-distress to come out of a movie like this. Campbell brings out the fact that underneath her fear and pain, she has a strong side that refuses to give up, which grows with the movie. Courteney Cox plays the self-involved Gale Weathers, who perseveres in getting her story just as Cox does in bringing this attitude to life. David Arquette is Deputy Dewey, the silly, out-of-sorts cop who has a very big soft spot where his badge should be. When it comes time to get serious, though, he does a good job of it. The rest of the cast includes such talent as Skeet Ulrich, Drew Barrymore, Matthew Lillard and Rose McGowan, all of whom bring sass and originality to the movie.
Filled with stunning surprises and intense moments unlike anything you've experienced before, ""Scream"" is a rocket ride into suspense, dazzling us with an original and refreshing story that plays on all its characters and twists while making the movie hip, fresh and entertaining.",985132800,3,4674,4.612244897959184

The movie could be the usual hotchpotch like thousand other, set between the young people of a college, so busy to butcher each other, while the adults seem live at the borders of world.
But here there is something more and better, further the good technical level: here we have IRONY, in the ancient sense of word.
The movie sees itself, like genre, like anthropology of fans, like communication, and does it with a playful disposition that exceeds the bloody situations time by time in scene.
When the masked killer attacks, always he receives very hard knocks by his victims and he rolls and jumps like a puppet: maybe are they afraid of this just, the  characters in the movie and the spectators in the reality? That the killer can be a bit ridiculous?

911589,5,6304675348,"This first film under this title by Wes Craven is a remarkable jigsaw puzzle mixing allusions to three major horror films (Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday 13th, Halloween) and a fair sense of suspense among teenagers. The suspense alone justifies the interest we can find in this film. It is built with great art and we discover that everything is constructed to let us know the criminal or criminals from the very start, provided we can read images properly. But the second interest is the intricacy of the plot that shows a great capability at mixing references, interlacing lines, interweaving crimes and events, keeping us alert and awake from beginning to end. But the essential interest of the film is that it is an absolutely realistic mirror image of teenagers. They are unconscious of what life is, though they cannot imagine death and are afraid of it more than any other generation before this one. They are cruel among themselves and totally closed to adults, unable to build or just accept a normal and equal relation to grownups. And that is their main, not shortcoming or drawback, but characteristic. Their world is entirely closed to the adult world around them, and they cannot have relations among themselves if adults are present. They can only live in the backs of adults, in a world, a culture, a lifestyle that is absolutely cut-off from adult society. In many ways they mimick their parents or their parents' generation. But they think, feel and consider they live a real life. They feel, think and consider they are totally independant, though they have no financial, no professional, no social autonomy. This fake independance on a background of radical dependance makes them play a dance that looks like that of a dog running after its wagging tail, or is it that of a tail running after a wagging dog. In such a world, a culture, a set of inter-individual relations it is fairly easy for some, who do not find the place or space they would like to have, or simply the ego-flattering that they need in order to exist, to become marginal (and their margin is the center of their world), or even criminal (and their crimes become the acme of an adventuristic life). Wes Craven does a marvelous job at depicting this youth at the end of the twentieth century. It is true to the very heart of its plot and story. The whole generation is  corrugated , and the few who are slight misfits in this corrugated world become paranoid, schizophrenic or anything else you want, and life is at stake, and the world is their target. Let them draw the knives then. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Universities II and IX.",978134400,,2628,4.737991266375546

While most people may consider this a cool movie just because  of the scares and the over-hyped ""irony"" there is actually an intelligent  plot with a pretty good twist. I notice this more as I am a writer and this  is one of my fave horror/thrillers.
I advise you not to watch this for  the pumped up scares (to a very loud soundtrack) but for how a typical  ""who's the killer?"" plotline can be a little better than it is believed to  be.
Some of the characters can be really annoying. In fact the only one  that doesn't enrage me is Dewey. His idiotness makes me laugh and diverts  my attention from the other characters in the very slow ""character building  scenes"".
The direction and photography are very bland. Wes Craven did a  much better job of a real horror film with A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET. Here  it just seems as if he aiming at the teen/popcorn market. You'll notice  that, with these kind of movies, most of the characters (not actors) are  teenagers and the tone of the film is mostly ""safe"". In the Scream  ""sub-genre"" there is never any REAL edge.
After this movie was made,  many, increasing bad, movies that were all exactly the same rolled off a  conveyor belt in Hollywood. They were easy moneymakers. Craven knew this  beforehand but deep, intelligent movies do not sit well with mass  audiences. The blander the style of film is, the more popular it will be  with the majority of audiences.
The plot in this one redeems these bad  qualities. I just wish for a real horror film to come out of Hollywood.

911720,4,6304675348,"Wes Craven's ``Scream'' violates one of the oldest rules in movie history:  It's about characters who go to the movies. They've even heard of movie  stars. They refer by name to Tom Cruise, Richard Gere, Jamie Lee Curtis.  They analyze motivations (``Did Norman Bates have a motive? Did Hannibal  Lecter have a reason for wanting to eat people?'')
True, they went to  the movies in ``The Last Picture Show,'' and the heroes of ``Clerks''  worked in a video store. Even Bonnie and Clyde went to the movies. But  those movies were about the *act* of going to the movies. ``Scream'' is  about *knowledge* of the movies: The characters in ``Scream'' are in a  horror film, and because they've seen so many horror films, they know what  to do, and what not to do. ``Don't say `I'll be right back,' '' one kid  advises a friend, ``because whenever anybody says that, he's *never* right  back.''
In a way, this movie was inevitable. A lot of modern film  criticism involves ``deconstruction'' of movie plots. ``Deconstruction'' is  an academic word. It means saying what everybody knows about the movies in  words nobody can understand. ``Scream'' is self-deconstructing; it's like  one of those cans that heats its own soup.
Instead of leaving it to the  audience to anticipate the horror cliches, the characters talk about them  openly. ``Horror movies are always about some big-breasted blond who runs  upstairs so the slasher can corner her,'' says a character in ``Scream.''  ``I hate it when characters are that stupid.''
The movie begins, of  course, with a young woman (Drew Barrymore) at home alone. She gets a  threatening phone call from an evil Jack Nicholson soundalike. She is  standing in front of patio doors with the dark night outside. She goes into  a kitchen where there are lots of big knives around. You know the drill.
Later, we meet another young woman (Neve Campbell). Her father has left  for the weekend. Her mother was murdered . . . why, exactly a year ago  tomorrow! Her boyfriend climbs in through the window. At high school,  rumors of cult killings circulate. The killer wears a spooky Halloween  costume named ``Father Death.'' There are more phone calls, more attacks.  The suspects include the boyfriend, the father, and a lot of other people.  A nice touch: The high school principle is The Fonz.
All of that is the  plot. ``Scream'' is not about the plot. It is about itself. In other words,  it is about characters who *know* they are in a plot. These characters read  Fangoria magazine. They even use movie-style dialogue: ``I was attacked and  nearly filleted last night.''
The heroine has been rejecting her  boyfriend's advances, and just as well: As another character points out,  virgins are never victims in horror films. Only bad boys and girls get  slashed to pieces. Realizing they're in the midst of a slasher plot, the  characters talk about who could play them: ``I see myself as sort of a  young Meg Ryan. But with my luck, I'll get Tori Spelling.''
The movie  itself, for all of its ironic in-jokes, also functions as a horror film--a  bloody and gruesome one, that uses as many cliches as it mocks.
One old  standby is the scene where someone unexpectedly enters the frame,  frightening the heroine, while a sinister musical chord pounds on the  soundtrack. I love these scenes, because (a) the chord carries a message of  danger, but (b) of course the unexpected new person is always a harmless  friend, and (c) although we can't see the newcomer because the framing is  so tight, in the real world the frightened person would of course be able  to see the newcomer all the time.
The movie is also knowledgeable about  the way TV reporters are portrayed in horror films. The reporter this time,  played by Courteney Cox of ``Friends,'' asks wonderful questions, such as  ``How does it feel to almost be the victim of a slasher?'' Savvy as she is,  she nevertheless suggests to a local deputy that they shouldn't drive to an  isolated rural setting when it's a nice night to walk down a deserted  country road in the dark while a slasher is loose.
What did I think  about this movie? As a film critic, I liked it. I liked the in-jokes and  the self-aware characters. At the same time, I was aware of the incredible  level of gore in this film. It is *really* violent.
Is the violence  defused by the ironic way the film uses it and comments on it? For me, it  was. For some viewers, it will not be, and they will be horrified.
Which  category do you fall in? Here's an easy test: When I mentioned Fangoria,  did you know what I was talking about?",965433600,,4594,4.6959798994974875

The beginning was promising (I have to admit-it made me  jump a couple times). But the movie goes on a downward spiral around the  middle of the movie. The killing scenes aren't creative . . . and those  scenes are almost the same each time! It got pretty annoying hearing that  dumb phone ring every two minutes. Another thing is that this movie is  entirely predictable. I knew who the killers where, I knew who was going to  die and who was going to live, I knew when the killer was going to show up!  Another stupid thing that brung down the movie, was the killer's motive at  the end. It's horrible! Couldn't they think of a better motive, come on!  Well, there are some good parts in the movie. The character development was  okay, the killer's costume was great, and the music that played went well  with the movie. I have to say that Scream is worth seeing, but it really  isn't that great of a movie.",962928000,2,1072,4.226600985221675

Deputy Dewey Riley  (David Arquette) tries to help her, but he is stalked, too. Then there's  the cheesy tabliod reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) who is more after  a story than trying to help. Sidney hates her because Gale believes that  someone else other than Cotton Weary (Liev Screiber) killed her mother.  Sidney put Weary in jail for the murders. There are murders popping up  everywhere, and everyone's a suspect! Everyone from Sidney's boyfriend  Billy (Skeet Ulrich), Stu, (Matthew Lillard), the horror movie freak Randy  (Jamie Kennedy), Sidney's friend Tatum (Rose Mcgowan), Dewey, Gale, and  even Sidney!

911791,5,6304675348,"A serial Killer, wearing a ghostface-mask is killing teenagers in the small town of Woodsboro.
A fame-seeking reporter, a wannabe cop and off course the surviving Heroine Sidney are the ingrediants of this  re-invention of the slasher genre, which was only present in the back  corner of some videostore for the last 10 years.
Wes Craven, the man who  brought Freddy Kruger onto the silver screens and into our nightmares,  cooperates with screenwriter Kevin williamson and they make you laugh and  scream with there masterpiece SCREAM.
Scream begins with a phone call  that will make motion picture history as well as the terrifying murder  scene that follows it. It was the first time ever I found myself sitting in  the theatre biting on my nails and hoping she'd make it...
After that  furious entrance to the movie, the story is explained and the characters  are being introduced to the audience. Sidney Prescott, whose mother has  been killed just a year ago, her boyfriend Billy Loomis (Hello  ""Halloween""! , Moviefreak Randy.......
All those characters are  so well written that you have a real relationship with them and you really  care, what's gonna happen to them because the ghostface never  rests...
The brilliance of SCREAM lies in its irony. Scary movies exist  in the world of sidney and her friends an they know how they work. So you  have to play by the rules, if you want to survive. The camera work in the  first installment of the Scream Trilogy is the most innovative of these  three movies. The camera often photographs the events in a slightly odd  angle which reflects the uncertanities of the characters. (I hope I didn't  spell that wrong..)  Adding to this is the beautiful music of Marco  beltrami. In his first soundtrack, he surprises with a wonderful  melancholic theme for Sidney and some decent suspense-music.
Speaking of  suspense. There's a lot of it in SCREAM but not as much as I hoped there  would be because the beginning was so impressive, the rest of the film  couldn't keep that pace. The shock audio-shock effects are very rare in  this one and they don't actualy work pretty good.
So I guess I told you  enough about SCREAM.. now you'll have to see for yourself...",961459200,,2211,4.805851063829787

911794,5,6304675348,"There are many people who shun this film for many reasons, and it may be true that you have to have an open mind to enjoy it.  But, this film is more than what meats the eye and it is an excellent new way of creating  fear, fun, and a great story.
The film starts off with a bang and its  thrill hightens as the movie goes on.  Drew Barrymore is the best cast they  could have come up with for the short and very scary cameo at the beggining  of the film.  Some people trash the beginning, but the thing that really  makes it frightening is that it isn't out of the realm of possibility, and  things like this do happen.  The first scene is gory, but excellently put  together and you will never forget it.
Then the main story starts, and  it continue's brilliantly for three whole movies.
The story focuses  around Neve Campbell's character, Sidney Prescott, who's mother was killed  a year before.  The story is delivered to us through more of events,  pictures and onscreen television reports than dialogue.  It is very  succesfully dished out to us with a wonderful mix of drama, action,  thrills, and then the obvious bloody scenes.
When you watch this series  of films, you have to look at it as the first series of thrillers of its  kind. The acting in this film and its two sequels never fails to convince,  especially Campbell's.  Her acting really does express to the viewer what  it could be like to be at the center of a bloody killing spree.  Aside from  Campbells incredible performance, we get an array of different characters  who all have a different role in this roller coaster plot.  But, we will  never forget Randy, the obsessed movie buff who knows all the rules to  survive through a horror film, played by Jamie Kennedy.  He is by far the  funnest of all the characters, and he gives ALL THREE films something that  they would be hurt without.
Wes Craven's breakthrough film is in a large  part due to Kevin Williamson's incredible script that will really make you  think.  This series was the start of a whole breed of copy's, which none  have lived up to the SCREAM films.  Ehren Kruger does pick up to write the  third film, though he did follow a 30 page outline from Williamson.  It  does not fail at all in comparison to the first two.  You won't be left  with anything unanswered with the first film and its sequels, and all  together they make a great trilogy.  And we will never forget Drew  Barrymore's scene that started it all...
If you look past the blood and  violence, which really are prevelent in this series, you will see a witty,  fun and scary mixture of thrills to create for you the ultimate SCREAM.",960336000,2,2645,4.457983193277311
911795,2,6304675348,"THis one is pretty decent. Ironically enough this series gets better through the sequels instead of worse. As a result this one is the _weak link_ in the Scream trilogy.

Neve Campbell is great as the  characther ""Sydney"", and with Courtney Cox, Drew Barrymore and  David Arquette (is he related to Alexis?) this can't go wrong. Kevin  Williamson har proved with the Scream movies and the latest Halloween  movie, that he has a great talent writing movie-scripts. The movie also  contains more gore than I thought in the first place. (The movie is rated  ""15 years"" here in Norway). A must for every fan of  slasher-films.

The acting is quite good for movies of this sort,but the costume(inspired by a Muinich painting)will probably inspire more laughs then screams. Suspense is conspicious by it's  absence,except in the riveting opening,and final,which are maybe the only  two things in this movie worth watching. Courtney Cox,and Neve Campbell are  good to look at,I must say,but they alone are not worth your rental  dollars.
  The characters themselves are pretty shallow,vapid,typical  teens who spout Quinetin Tarentino-esque dialouge in one of the few  original ideas in this cliche riddled mess. They also seem nothing like real  teens,or at least any I know.
  I suppose it can be fun in a cheesy sort  of way,and perhaps worth a dollar or two on a slow night,but other than  that skip it.
  Of intrest mostly to fans of this rather spotty  subgenre,but you're really much better off watching it's  inspiration,Halloween. Oh,and Nightmare On Elm Street beats the stuffing out  of this gory piece of tripe. So does Wes Craven's New Nightmare.

Not the best movie ever made like alot of these people are saying, but it was probably one of the most entertaining films of 1996. I think, and some will agree  with me here, that the reason why people give this movie such a bad rap is  because it was the mother of all these new teeny bopper horror flicks that  have penetrated the movie scene. I (Still) Know What You Did Last Summer,  Urban Legend, the Faculty, Disturbing Behavior and now this new Final  Destination movie. People probably wouldn't complain so much if they had to  go through all that slasher hooplah that dominated the late 70's/early  80's. But it's easy to understand where they come from. Frankly, I'm  getting kind of sick of it. But Scream stands alone as the best of all of  them. Urban Legend was better? Give me a break.

911845,1,6304675348,"Scream brought us little shocks and no nudity.  The most popular slasher movies, A Nightmare On Elm Street, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween and Friday the 13th all had creative death sequences, which are important  in slasher movies. They also brought us very SHOCKING material. And often  nudity. They were not afraid to stand up to the plate and deliver what they  were supposed to.  Unfortunately, the '90s were a politically correct time,  where many slasher movies were nervous about showing, gore, nudity and such  else. Scream, I respect for delivering a reignition in the genre, but it  doesn't deliver what the '80s crowds went to see, except for the slashings  of course. Wes Craven is noticeably softer here than ever before. He's  unfortunately not given the audiences shocks that will be talked about for  years. Last House On The Left was extremely shocking and A Nightmare On Elm  Street has some of the most elaborate death scenes in slasher history. And  if Kevin Williamson would have watched more than just a hand full of  slasher movies, it would have been given more fun material I believe. And  if he did watch more than a hand full of slasher movies, he should have  thrown much more stuff in. The classics like the Friday the 13th series,  Nightmare On Elm Street series, and Halloween series remain uneclipsed by  present slasher movies. Thankfully, it looks like Scream has boosted life  back into the '80s horror rather than the '90s horror, seeing how the  Scream-imitations are slowly dying down and Jason X, Freddy vs. Jason, Seed  Of Chucky, Hellraiser 5 and others are on the way.",954720000,11,1619,4.857142857142857

  Problems:That costume is a bit dorky,making me want  to laugh rather than scream.
  Neve Campbell overacts from time to  time,and comes off as whiny.
  Do we really need yet another slasher  movie?Didn't think so.
  The gross over-use of pop culture refrences  to appear clever is enough to make anyone gag.

Neve Cambell,  Courtney Cox, David Arquette, Jamie Kennedy, and Henry Winkler all turn  engaging memorable performances that amazingly defy camp. The revelation  that all the characters in Scream are actually aware of horror movies and  know all the Slasher movies rules is both an engaging and very original  twist on the boring monotonous teen horror flicks that preceded it.  Scream's deft combination of horror and comedy made a surprisingly hip  movie that pleased teenage audiences. Kevin Williamson composed the Scream  script with Wes Craven in mind, and the cohesiveness of Williamson's  brilliant script and Craven's experienced direction make an atmospheric  intelligent horror film in the proud tradition of Halloween.

Series"" tagline. If you  really need the TV commerical clips, the trailers, and other frills, then  get this DVD. Otherwise, buy the ""non-deluxe"" edition and save a  few bucks.
The movie itself is a must-have. Feb 4, 2000 was the release  date of SCREAM 3. If you don't know about the SCREAM trilogy, then don't go  see see SCREAM 3. You won't have a clue on what it is about.
Anyway,  horror/suspense fans should see the SCREAM series--starting with the  original flick.

The movie has unlimited replay  value and its cult following is well deserved.  The fact that this was  directed by Wes Craven is even more shocking in its universal appeal.

But I would never classify this light hearted, sardonic film, filled to the brim with our favorite tv actors, as horror. Horror transends time - it is  supernatural, dark, lovely and completely outlandish. This film spoonfeeds  horror to those who know nothing about the genres itself. It's sad to see  that the great horror meistro Wes Craven took on this silly project. I  don't blame him though, the genres has hit an all time low, even though  critics say it's coming back with this dumb movie and the pathetic Blair  Witch Project. The problem with Scream is that it relies on cheap, jump in  your face, thrills and some fancy ruminations on old tricks of the horror  movie's trade. Please. People think that's intelligent and witty? Try  making a real horror movie, without the big actors and funny quips - now  that's a challenge. See The Texas Chainsaw Massacre - not for a moment does  that movie sway from its truly ominous atmosphere. And some horror movies  are just straight funny - mostly because they are campy and take themselves  100% seriously. Scream never takes itself seriously. I was just waiting for  the next cast member from ""Friends"" to pop up on the screen and  make some stupid, so called ""witty"" remark about an old classic  horror film.

912199,5,6304675348,"Scream is an astonishingly entertaining film, which mixes all the right ingredients - great direction, brilliant writing and a fresh and talented cast (especially Jamie Kennedy who excels in the role of the very funny  Randy). The first scene is absolutely terrifying, taking horror back to the  simple idea of someone being stalked by a killer - it really is one of the  most intense sequences ever committed to film. And whilst the blood flows,  you'll still be laughing heartily at the sheer self-awareness of it all, as  Williamson sets out the rules, then goes right ahead and breaks every  single one of them. To convey my enthusiasm for this film in a few hundred  words is impossible, but if you spend your money on it you won't feel  ripped off. Now, this 'Collector's Edition' is quite poor, with not much  substantial to offer - some TV spots, trailers and a few measly behind the  scenes snippets which have music over them so you can't hear anything going  on on the set! However, the commentary with Craven and Williamson is very  entertaining, and even though I'm moaning, the extras could have been much  worse. Anything that covers this brilliant film is always going to be  interesting, but I had hoped for the Director's Cut with a few minutes of  'lopped off to gain an R rating' gory action. Anyway, I absolutely love  this movie, and I would advise you to at least give it a try. Buy for the  film, stay for the extras.",948067200,,1441,4.610236220472441

Besides it's scripted commentary there are the  not so obvious comments that the more experienced horror fan will  appreciate (such as where have I heard the name ""Loomis""  before?). Keep your eyes open for an appearance by Craven as the school  janitor; perhaps a tip of the hat to Hitchcock's cameo in  ""Psycho"".

2.  A good script  by Kevin Williamson.
3.  Above all, excellent performances by the  ensemble cast.  Neve Campbell is really the lead (although only third  billed) and she is a superb heroine--sympathetic but also tough when she  has to be.

The only reason I would have  wanted to see the secound one was because she was in it, but, OPPS! shes  dead before it starts.

Scream is not suspenseful as I would like,  that I will admit.  But the way they drew out typical slasher movie  scenarios and re-enacted them their way was humorous and sort of a thriller  at times, wondering who the killer was and who would be next. The ending  was good.  For the reviewers who said Scream copied other horror movies,  that was kind of the point, or did you not pay attention to the movie?

The voice on the phone always seemed calm and  undercontrol, but underneath was something much more sinister.",912902400,,271,4.680851063829787

7875438,5,6304675348,"This movie spawned so many imitations, it's hard to remember just what made it so great in the first place. The script, full of pop culture references and horror tropes, is tight and fun. It's got great performances by a stellar cast and assured direction by one of the horror auteurs, Wes Craven. The opening bit is scary and engaging. The ending is truly surprising. This is one that still holds up, even twenty years later, and manages not to seem dated at all.",1520294400,,464,4.535714285714286
