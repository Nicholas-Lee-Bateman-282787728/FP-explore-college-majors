2518839,1,B000EHQ7X8,"The only reasons this movie gets 1 and 1/2 stars is because it has Angus Scrimm from the Phantasm movies in it, and because Annie Sorell is gorgeous. Other than that, don't even bother with this movie. The acting is atrocious, the story is horrible, and the only thing that really carries this movie is the shower scene where you get to see Annie nude, plus Angus Scrimms acting.",1149033600,5,379,4.507246376811594
2518840,2,B000EHQ7X8,"I feel very obligated to watch just about everything with Angus Scrimm and Jeffrey Combs, so when they're together in a movie you better believe I'm going to check it out! Annie Sorell who plays Michelle, is a minor (even though she's in her late twenties) and is placed in a halfway house for problem children after a car wreck where she developed amnesia. She is plagued by visions of her dead father and has a fancy looking ouija board that was in the car with her during the time of the accident. Michelle tries to understand her past and why she is being tormented by her horrible visions.

The acting was really quite horrible, but I did enjoy the performances by the house mother. Eliza Swenson, a sexy redhead, played a pierced out problem teen and she was very entertaining as her character Dalia. The teens in the house go about their day to day business and Michelle has visions and everyone keeps telling her to forget about them because nobody really cares. But she does damn it, and she?s going to get to the bottom of it!

The twist at the end of the movie was really unique, but the story was just not really there. I wasn't interested and I didn't care about any of the characters. I didn't even care how it ended. If there's really any reason to check this out here's the short list; Angus Scrimm plays Michelle's doctor, Jeffrey Combs shows up a few times as a cop to investigate, Eliza Swenson's [...] and the most humorous (and by humorous I mean worst) fight scene I've ever seen between our main character and her body double. Rent it if there's nothing else to rent, or if your curiosity gets the better of you.",1146268800,6,1635,4.446666666666666

2518851,1,B000EHQ7X8,"I hate whodunit slasher films where we only see the killer's hands and shadows until the very end. This is one of them. ""Satanic"" had nothing to do with Satanism. No rituals, no chants, no black Masses. There weren't even any demons! Just the pentagram symbol. It's about an underage girl(played unconvincingly by a twenty-something actress) who was mentally insane. She handmade a Ouija Board and killed people. It wasn't even in the name of Satan. All she wanted was immortally. In that case, ""Faust"" would be Satanic, too, and it is most certainly not! ""Satanic"" was stupid and badly produced. It's not the worst movie in the world, but it really, really sucks. Satan must be rolling in his grave. Avoid this movie, for God's sake.",1378166400,2,734,4.78740157480315

2518854,3,B000EHQ7X8,"Like many a horror fan, I have a special place in my little black heart for actor Jeffrey Combs of Re-Animator fame.  You'll notice he gets top billing in Satanic, but don't let that marketing ploy fool you.  The fact is that Jeffrey Combs turns up in only three scenes in this film; you can count his onscreen minutes on one hand.  I knew that going in (it's sort of an open secret), yet the film seemed to hold potential promise for other reasons - sadly, that potential is, for the most part, wasted in this effort.  I liked what the filmmakers tried to do here; the basic idea could have made for an entertaining, even suspenseful film capable of delivering a hammer blow of a final twist.  The cast and crew behind Satanic, though, just weren't up to the task.

Annie Sorell (whom many will recognize from the shower scene with her twin sister Alicia in Cruel Intentions 2) plays Michelle, a mixed-up teen recovering from a horrendous automobile accident that took the life of her father.  She has no memory of her past, yet she is haunted by increasingly disturbing nightmares.  Her doctor, Dr. Barbary (Angus Scrimm) has to reconstruct her seriously injured face from photographs, and I think all will agree he does a super-bang-up job of it.  Once the bandages come off, she is moved to Harmony House, a half-way house for problem kids.  (The accident seems to have changed her whole personality because she was reportedly quite a rebel in the past.)  The place is run by a weird, borderline pervert (Rick Dean) and his - well, I don't want to say she's ugly, so I'll just say she's ferociously unattractive - wife (Diane Goldner).  Eliza Swenson seriously heats up the film as Michelle's hot redheaded roommate.  In the grip of her worsening nightmares, Michelle comes to the reluctant conclusion that she not only killed someone, she sacrificed her victim as part of some satanic ritual.  As you no doubt would expect, death soon comes calling at Harmony House, and the whole series of deadly events leads Michelle ever closer to the truth about her past - a truth which will come as no surprise to virtually anyone paying the least bit of attention to the film.

Some critics have pretty much raked this film over the coals - and not without reason.  Making people think Jeffrey Combs plays a significant role in the film is rather dirty pool, some of the acting in the film is not very good, and the story never really comes together in an effective way.  All of these things are true, yet I certainly didn't hate this film, nor did I ever finding myself tuning it out.  Satanic just never achieves the cohesion it needs to really work.  I cared very little for any of the characters (except the sultry redhead, of course) and thus felt almost nothing, least of all suspense, as the movie progressed.  The film poses different questions for the viewer to consider, but these essential questions never seem all that important.  The killings were quite unsatisfying, usually taking place off-screen and involving minimal amounts of blood, the film features one of the most boring catfight scenes ever filmed, and the ending is just far too predictable.  All of the pieces for a good psychological horror film are there; director Dan Golden just couldn't put all of them together effectively in the time allotted.",1153526400,,3322,4.711072664359862
2518855,1,B000EHQ7X8,"Annie Sorell (Man of the Year) stars as a young girl named Michelle who has woken up from a car accident in which she doesnt remember what she was doing at the time. She is brought into a home with a group of people where she'll stay for the duration. Soon Michelle finds a book in which she tries to remember what happened during the car accident. Then when things become clear all the pieces come together and Michelle has to stop what's going on since everyone around her starts to die. Can someone say boring? Sorell needs to take acting lessons bad. She gives one pretty empty performance as does everyone else. What a waste of Jeffrey Combs (Re-Animator, The Frighteners)....AGAIN!! That goes for Angus Scrimm (Phantasm) too. The end fight scene and hopefully you'll make it to the end is one of the dumbest things you'll ever see. Also starring James Russo, Diane Ayala Goldner (Feast), Brett Erickson (Scarecrow: Resurrection), Alecia Loren (Coyote Ugly) and Eliza Swenson (Candy Stripers).",1152144000,3,998,4.842105263157895
2518856,2,B000EHQ7X8,"SATANIC is ulimately silly and amateurish but it is perversely interesting enough to subdue horror fans who yearn for the days of really good horror movies.

A young girl is in an auto accident and horribly mutilated.  Kindly Dr. Angus Scrimm reconstructs her face and she emerges beautiful but with no memory of who she is.  She is placed in the youth shelter from hell where she encounters three other troubled teens and is haunted by ghastly visions.  James Russo turns up as some kind of hobo and Jeffrey Combs flits in and out as a weary homicide detective.  Climaxing in one of the worst fight scenes on screen, the twist is pretty obvious.

8109797,3,B000EHQ7X8,"""SATANIC"" is one of those movies where either you like it for what it is, or dislike it for what it is not... or... something....

In other words, this is not an easy movie to recommend... or disrecommend (if that's a word)... and one of the reasons for that, I believe, is for the same reason that it took me a while to come around to warming-up to it, namely, its uncomfortably ""open to interpretation"" ambiguity. After a first watch, you may come away with one interpretation, but upon a couple of re-watches, that interpretation may completely flip on its head, creating a different story in your mind entirely. Now whether this was the intent of the creators or not, I've no information on that, but as soon as I realized what a reimaginative mindphuk this movie can be in its simplicity, I finally came around to embracing it and having a deeper appreciation for it that had not been there upon my first couple of initial viewings.

Of course, Angus Scrimm's minor role is perhaps the initial draw to this movie, but sadly even he seems to be ""mailing it in"" with the rest of the sea of ""also players,"" and you get the sense that most of the performers are genuinely not all that skilled in the art or are just not living up to their potential and are simply just trying to get a paycheck cut to them for that particular hour. The real flaw though is the weak half-hearted climax, which could've made up for all of the movie's other faults had it been more engaging & engrossing, but sadly, they really dropped the ball in this department.

All-in-all, however, I've really come to like this movie -- again, mainly on the strength of its ""story idea"" and its multifaceted interpretive elements, which would've made for a considerably better movie had it been handled with more care and refinement.",1424736000,,1803,4.575851393188855
8109798,4,B000EHQ7X8,"It's not bad after all. OK whaddya want, what were you expecting, Jim Jarmusch?
Listen, if you're into Ouija themed movies, this one isn't bad at all. At least it's coherent with a clever little plot twist.
The setting in the home for wayward kids is somewhat realistic (ripping off the state govt.) and the owners who run the place are convincing enough. sleazy scam artists; the woman looks like Elsie the Cow, she could get a job at Bordens and the guy is just a dumb schmuck.

The script is tight and well paced. They use the ouija board fairly often as an important visual focal point and the board itself is aesthetically pleasing and well designed. Some of the characters in the home aren't portrayed as well as they could have been , bit of a mismatch but it don't matter.

Sure it's kinda hokey but surprisingly, not in a really offensive way; it just works all around.

This is good entertainment and very watchable.",1422576000,,926,4.532934131736527
