3527896,4,B001DAVU5K,"My wife and I really enjoyed this film. It plays like a narrated home movie, but in a way that is personal, intimate and very inspiring.
I'd recommend flyabout to any pilot and non pilot looking for adventure and personal enlightenment.",1227744000,,236,4.780487804878049
3527897,5,B001DAVU5K,"A superbly crafted documentary charting the journey of a novice flyer around the continent of Australia.  The flight itself is both a stunning travelogue and a metaphor for the filmmaker's personal journey of discovery as she faces the unforeseen challenges of navigating the continent with her father as her co-pilot.  The footage is beautiful, and the twists and turns taken on the aviation tour and in the filmmaker's personal experience are constantly surprising, moving, and relentlessly entertaining.  Don't miss it.",1228521600,,522,5.5
3527898,5,B001DAVU5K,"As a pilot and world traveler myself, I enjoyed this movie and how it intertwined so many different themes into a cohesive yet enjoyable documentary. I have not been to Australia (yet), so I got to live precariously through Monika's travels, and better yet, at altitude. Far from a tedious travelogue, the drama between family members will interest anyone who isn't drawn in because of the amazing panoramas, the beautiful music, the flora and fauna, the narrator's introspection, and of course, the aviation angle.

If I have described the film somewhat cerebrally above, I am happy to add that the movie can be enjoyed by all ages. As the founder of an organization using women in aviation to inspire girls to achieve their full potential (Girls With Wings), I endorse this movie as a way to educate girls on all they can achieve. Flyabout is the perfect ""vehicle"" for doing so. My 6 year old niece sat curled up next to me on the couch as we watched the entire movie. She was riveted, didn't move a muscle during the duration, and at the end of it I asked her what she liked the best. Her answer, ""that it was a girl pilot.""",1228521600,3,1127,4.551724137931035
3527899,4,B001DAVU5K,"This is a great small doc for lovers of aviation, Australia and the challenges of stepping outside yourself, beyond yourself to realize your dreams.  I saw the film in a theater and the audience had a great time.  Monika is a remarkable character and her evolving relationship with her father during the flight moves this story beyond a travelogue into something much more.",1228435200,,373,4.904761904761905
3527900,5,B001DAVU5K,"I really enjoyed this film and it's theme of self discovery.  I have never flown a plane before, but after riding along with Monika on her adventure, I just might start!",1228348800,,169,4.451612903225806
3527901,4,B001DAVU5K,"Greatly enjoyed this intimate glimpse into one woman's very personal journey - one that, like any good story, has plenty of obstacles, frustrations, and triumphs.  This film will no doubt most deeply resonate with female aviators, but I am neither and still found it a wonderfully compelling piece of work.",1228262400,,306,5.12
3527902,5,B001DAVU5K,"I saw Flyabout at the SXSW Film Festival in Spring 2008. I found it to be a heartfelt, surprisingly powerful film. What starts out as a travelogue ends up being a complex portrait of a father-daughter relationship. With father and daughter in the cockpit, the rest of the family in the backseat, the small plane becomes a microcosm of the ways in which we struggle to control our own destinies, chart our own courses, letting others in or not. The scenery is lovely as well! Big thumbs up.",1228176000,,489,4.568181818181818
3527903,5,B001DAVU5K,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flyabout/dp/B001DAVU5K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flyabout</a>Great flying, beautiful scenery and a heartwarming, soul-searching experience of a young woman flying her family around the Australian Outback for a month.  This is a gal with only 140 hours total flying time taking her family around the periphery of the Australian continent, much flying at 500 feet with windows open looking for emu, camels, dugong and other wildlife over some of the most beautiful terrain in the world.  But the real story is the interaction with her father, dealing with one who has been the alpha person in the family but has barely received his license, is too inexperienced to be in control of an airplane with his family aboard, yet resistant to stepping down because he so looked forward to doing the flying.  The movie becomes her own ""walkabout"" but in an airplane, hence the movie title.  By the end of the film she has looked inward, resolved her turmoil and has had the experience of a lifetime.  This film is great for anyone interested in flying, Australian Outback, and/or coming of age situations.  It is particularly relevant for the younger generation interested in flying, for parents who want to encourage their children that they can do anything to which they aspire and to parents dealing with the growing independence of their children.",1228176000,,1411,5.420091324200913
3527904,5,B001DAVU5K,"I loved this movie!  It's a great combination of heartfelt personal story and exciting adventure.  The filmmaker/narrator takes a trip flying a small airplane around the continent of Australia with her father.  The trip has its ups and downs--both in the flying department, and the intergenerational one.  The footage of Australia and its sights is amazing, and the story is told very, very well.  There is upbeat music, fast-paced editing, and some very personal observations by the woman herself.  People who love small-plane aviation will find this movie irresistible.  And so will anyone with a dad!

What makes the film a real success is how well it weaves together a good narrative (windy landings, mechanical delays, wildlife encounters) with the theme of being on a ""walkabout"" and trying to listen to one's own inner voice.  When the trip was over, I felt like I could really see inside the filmmaker's head--and that is what I call truly personal storytelling!  I've recommended this movie to a whole bunch of people since I first saw it, and just about everyone who has gone out of their way to find it has thanked me for the recommendation.  Five stars and then some!",1228089600,,1179,4.874371859296482
3527905,4,B001DAVU5K,Flyabout is a wonderful documentary. I have never been that into airplanes so at first I wasn't that interested in seeing it. But to my surprise it turned out to be a very moving film about a father and daughter flying across Australia. Full of twists and turns I recommend this film very highly. On a side note[...] reports that the Petrillo that directed Flyabout is married to Julian Petrillo who directed the fantastic documentary  Word Wars. What a talented family. If you are looking for a great date night buy both and sit back and enjoy.,1228089600,,545,4.618556701030927
3527906,4,B001DAVU5K,"My wife and I found this DVD very enjoyable to watch. The flying was great, the scenery was beautiful, and the drama between Monika and her father was interesting.

I applaud Monika's hard work. Flying, filming, financing, and editing a movie is no easy job, and she did it all by herself. Support a fellow pilot and general aviation and purchase this movie!",1227916800,,358,4.682539682539683
8292462,5,B001DAVU5K,"Excellent  movie. Sentimental, warm, respectful, picturesque, As an aspiring private pilot myself, I understand what she means about turning 82 and looking back. Take the bull by the horn, no regrets. I would like to do what she did as well.  Very well made. No surprise the main character works in Hollywood. .",1524268800,,311,4.849056603773585
8292463,5,B001DAVU5K,"Very poingient, thought provoking and genuine. It will give you cause for introspection.",1523664000,,88,5.846153846153846

8292465,5,B001DAVU5K,A journey worth the time. Sit back and take flight with a relationship worth sharing.,1515715200,,85,4.733333333333333
8292466,5,B001DAVU5K,"We enjoyed this film. Part travel documentary, part autobiography, part family journey, this film is a touching portrait of a womans quest to fly around the continent of Australia.",1515628800,,180,5.241379310344827
8292467,4,B001DAVU5K,"I heard about this documentary on a podcast I recently listened to. From what I learned about the story, I knew I had to see this. I sat down Saturday morning with my wife and 13 year old daughter. When the movie was over both daughter and wife thanked me for getting this. We all agreed that we wish the movie was longer. I am a private pilot while my wife and daugther are non-pilots who fly with me when they can. I highly recommnend this movie for aviation and non-aviation enthusiasts alike. Not 5 stars because it is not HD....but she probably did not have the option when this movie was recorded.",1343001600,,603,4.345132743362832
8292468,4,B001DAVU5K,"I caught this movie in Austin and because I was curious what it was like to fly around Australia.  At first it seemed like there would be some warm or funny moments with the other fliers and we would see the pilot fulfilling her dream.  But the film takes a surprising turn.  The tension between the filmmaker's father and herself really made for a great drama with serious suspense.  I've read that many notable successful women in business and politics also fly--maybe there's a statistic about successful women having to face competition with their fathers, too.",1231977600,,565,4.854166666666667
8292469,4,B001DAVU5K,"This a well told story that is at least as much about the nature of changing relationships, growth and facing fears as it is about circumnavigating Australia in a very small plane. The director (a new pilot)and her father (an even newer pilot) decide to fly around Australia  and over the course of this trip learn about each other, the nature of relationships and themselves. That being said it is not overwrought or overly sentimental ... the landscape is as bold and striking as Ms. Petrillo is gutsy and articulate.
  This is a beautiful tale of a substantial journey over terrain that is both emotional and physical.",1231286400,,621,4.785046728971962
8292470,4,B001DAVU5K,"It would be a mistake to regard Monika Petrillo's quirky and genuine ""Flyabout"" as merely a great flying yarn and scenic travelogue about Australia--though her film is eminently both of those things. On its deeper level ""Flyabout"" is the tale of a grown daughter reckoning with her father, accepting the disappointments of life and relationships and then bravely flying on regardless. You'll love the way ""Flyabout"" tells your family story too. The in-air cockpit footage is great, especially when Monika encounters her first rain storms and difficult crosswind landings and her father has to trust her to be a better pilot than him. I also especially enjoyed the gritty and uncut gem quality of the filming--this is Monika's video blog of a remarkable aerial journey across Australia. This, plus Monika's heartfelt but unpretentious narration, is a refreshing break from the slick and overdone docu-videos from too many of today's film-makers. You don't have to be a pilot to love this one. ""Flyabout"" is Monika Petrillo's statement about life.

8292471,5,B001DAVU5K,"The story of a young woman fulfilling a long-time dream of flying around the continent of Australia.  This film is inspirational on so many levels.  Whether you're a young pilot, a young woman, a young film-maker or anyone with a taste for adventure, there is something here for all.  The visuals are true to this beautiful and mysterious landscape. The dangers are as real as the emotions that fly between Monika and her family.  Through this brave and unique journey we learn that the flying is only the beginning of her challenges.  I don't want to give away any more.  Just watch it!  You'll be glad you did.",1228867200,,612,4.611111111111111
