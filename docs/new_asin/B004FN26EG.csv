8428083,5,B004FN26EG,"Fascinating insights into the social effects of sending women to gaol

No where are the gender differences between men and women, more apparent than in extreme social situations

The National Geographic series is excellent - they get behind the scenes, with interviews with inmates and gaolers, show  both sides of prison life. This helps explain why perhaps prison is not the deterrent it might be. Prison is shown as one element of a counter culture that is a natural human response to a social system that leaves some advantaged / disadvantaged relative to others.

Whether a totally inclusive society can ever exist is well outside is a question for another day - but this series of documentaries provides some fascinating social insights into how people are responding to current social norms.",1422921600,,798,5.068702290076335

8428087,3,B004FN26EG,"I could argue that this uses a possibly feminist, and definitely Oprah-ish, technique: it explores women's lives to enduce empathy for the subjects.  Viewers get to see a pregnant woman in prison, a woman begging to have a cellmate, a bad-butt prison shot caller, etc.
I kept asking myself, ""How is this different from shows on men's prisons?""  This never says CA only has one prison for women, as I'm sure many states do.  However, it does speak of how it's easier to divide men by threat level, race, etc., while female prisoners all get lumped together.  At no point do they speak of forming families like they did in the film ""Stranger Inside.""  Still, the solitarily confined inmate's desire to have a celly may affect women more than men.  (I just imagine some men would be thrilled to be left alone or removed from the crowds.)  The work attempts to say female inmates can be just as violent as males.  It stood out to me that female correctional officers conduct the strip searches and other procedures of a private nature, but that receives little focus here.
If I heard correctly, many prisons for women have a different ethnic makeup than male prisons.  In ""Stranger Inside,"" one woman says to another, ""There's more of us than there are of them.""  This doesn't come up here.  I watched a ""Lockdown"" episode on a male prison and race was in every other paragraph.  This work says many women go to prison due to drugs.  I think Dr. Angela Davis, or someone of her ilk, said many women go to prison because of the men in their lives who force or trick them into doing illegal acts.  That's never mentioned here.
As you can guess, I just loved Cheryl Dunye's ""Stranger Inside.""  I encourage viewers to watch this and that film consecutively.",1307664000,,1749,4.614886731391586
