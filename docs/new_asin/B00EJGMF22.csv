5921136,1,B00EJGMF22,"I am a fan of David Sedaris, so naturally I was excited to come across this film...now i just wish i could un-see this film and go back to complete adoration of Mr. Sedaris. Maybe one day i will regain my full capacity of appreciation for his work (note: i will get over this), but for now I imagine I will be wincing and have flashbacks. Hopefully, by the time I hear him share another story on this american life I will be ready to forgive his involvement in this film, and things will be back as they were intended to be. I don't get paid until next Friday, jeez I could really use my 7 bucks back.",1379980800,3,601,4.101694915254237

5921140,1,B00EJGMF22,"You will like this movie if you are an east coast elitist.  It will confirm your prejudicial biases that the rest of the country is full of red-neck Christian right kooks.  This movie is so awful, I couldn't believe it.  It is not remotely believable.  While there are people out there who have extreme views anywhere you live, this movie does not pull it off in any way shape or form.  The acting is terrible, the script it terrible.  Having experiences and relatives that live in such towns as the one portrayed, it doesn't even come close with portraying the depth and mostly goodness of Middle America.  Its not a believable movie in any way the main character is faced with conflict; whether it be working in menial labor, facing the average blue collar worker (who were portrayed in the worse way possible), facing his own homosexual tendencies, facing general homosexuality in general, facing the problems of undocumented un-bilingual Hispanic workers, conflict with his mother, and especially facing anything that remotely looked at spirituality, which I think was supposed to be a main theme of the movie.  There are many ways and paths that people can find spiritual peace.  The arrogance to satirize a person finding spiritual peace with the Christian Right was appalling. After watching this movie, I'd rather live with middle America, than with elitists on the east coast.  The only way this movie could have been good is if it played up the satire and turned this movie into a wacky comedy; but it does not.  It toys with satire only a bit to leave the viewer with the belief that it wants the viewer to believe that middle America is full of uneducated, nutty, anger-filled, delusional Christian right nuts.  If you want a good satirical comedy on middle red-neck America, I suggest you rent Dale and Tucker vs Evil.  Now that is a great movie.

Now I don't want to say too much about it, but I'm pretty sure other reviews have given things away. so with that said, I liked this movie, I did kind of figure out the twist but nonetheless the actors kept me enthralled. what can I say about Jonathan Groff, BRAVO, he was terrific as the spoiled rich kid apparently slumming it in the great Northwest. he is picking apples, then he meets others and moves on and on and on. Figured the ending but nonetheless, I hated it for the religious claptrap that was spouted. Narrow minded people have never been my forte'.",1439769600,8,793,4.438356164383562
5921156,4,B00EJGMF22,"I understand the bad reviews.  I really do.  The movie starts slow and drags on at first, and David is hardly a character we are pulling for.  He comes off as out of touch and elitist in the opening scenes where he is riding a bus and it takes awhile for him to start to win us over.  But despite digging such a big hole, director and writer Kyle Patrick Alvarez pulls this movie up with great story telling.  As the movie develops and David grows as a character we start to not only warm to him, but understand his strange and somewhat immature quest for identity.  We see why he is so confused and why he seems to swing to such extremes in his journey of self discovery.

Overall I liked the movie, great acting and a fine job from Alvarez.  But the film is not without its flaws early on and it does take time for it to find itself.",1439078400,,835,4.111111111111111

5921158,1,B00EJGMF22,"CAUTION! SPOILERS MAY LURK BELOW!

I'd never heard of David Sedaris, and this movie doesn't motivate me to change that. If he's anything at all like the David in this movie, he's a rich, spoiled, shallow, obnoxious, narcissistic, condescending, self-pitying, passive-aggressive jerk. Not the kind of person I want in my life.

I might have liked this movie if only Curly (or Jon, or anybody!) had beaten that you-can't-get-mad-at-me-I'm-just-a-lost-little-boy smirk off his face, but it didn't happen. Too bad. Other reviewers talk about how he grew and changed in the course of the movie, but I guess they saw a different movie. He was a spoiled, self-pitying jerk in the beginning and he was still a spoiled, self-pitying jerk at the end.

I thought I liked Jonathan Groff (he's what drew me to this movie) but the more he plays obnoxious characters like this the more I suspect it may be because he's like them. And Dennis O'Hare is so reliably good that it's surprising how bad he is here. The Christianity shtick in this movie feels completely false, sour and vindictive, like something shoehorned in only to let the writer settle a mean-spirited old grudge.

I stuck with this movie all the way to the end, and the best thing I can say about it is that it did, finally, end. I hated it.",1429056000,,1292,4.728888888888889

5921160,1,B00EJGMF22,"Misleading, confusing and extremely bazaar. Eerie as well!
I watched this with a few friends and nobody liked it. Well acted by the actors in this movie. We could see character depth and hard work in the actors. But--- this was a film about an a--hole. The main character, named David, played by Johnathan Groff, was so rude and arrogant, it was hard to route for him. He ended up hurting a lot of people's feelings along his way, totally disappearing from his family and ignoring his worried mother. Then he mislead and humiliated a kind man who helped him out a lot. Bad things happened to him, and bad things happened because of him. Absolutely nothing enjoyable or uplifting about this movie.

Such. A. Disappointment. .Is this really about David Sedaris, himself??! He would actually admit that he did these things to people?! This has absolutely changed our opinions of David, if so. Wow, what a horrible miserable person who just went around arrogantly feeling sorry for himself, hurting people along the way.

Some scenes are apparently meant to be punches in the stomach, rather than Humor.  Bravery is the motive for confession, maybe?  Seems a bit counter to his real life now, but people are allowed to change their minds?  We are left with more questions than we had before we saw C.O.G.  We wonder and wonder.

5921168,2,B00EJGMF22,"C.O.G. filters David Sedaris's prose through the sullen lens of Indie Cinema. The result makes for interesting cinema, but is stale when compared to the original text. Jonathan Groff is great lead that is relatable, but not bland, giving us a David that is deeply emotional, though he says very little. However, as the embodiment of Sedaris he lacks the judgmental wit that makes Sedariss voice so singular.

I never laughed during the movie, rather I found myself feeling sad and lost in this film. And while I found that using the events and dialogue of Sedaris short story to be refreshing within the Indie Americana genre, it didn't see or feel anything I hadn't before. Sedaris C.O.G.s was a master class in hyperbole of the mundane; The film C.O.G. is a routine indie coming-of-age story.",1411430400,4,794,4.838235294117647

5921175,3,B00EJGMF22,"Cutie Jonathan Groff is best known for being the beefcake in clean-cut TV shows and films, so maybe that explains why he wanted to do this grungy movie about a preppy trying to go earthy by working in an apple orchard, to mostly comic effect.  It turns into a strange relationship movie between him and the townies who look after him after he leaves that ill-fitted job. Denis O'Hare as a fundamentalist Christian does a good job of potrying him as a guy who just wants to be in charge of other people's faith, and Corey Stoll from House of Cards is convincing as a sexually confused man trying hide his feelings for Groff. If you like the actors, then you might like the film. All you Pretty Little Liars fans will not want to watch it because Troian Bellisario has only 1 scene.",1401840000,2,780,4.416666666666667

I guessed pretty early on what has driven this young man away from his parents. It turned out to be the best, most honest part of the movie for me. It was just a look between two people on a bus. You're given to believe that this man is on some sort of journey and the people he meets have such an influence on his young life. I didn't see that at all. This was just a closeted young man who couldn't/wouldn't open up, seemed like a bit of a lazy bones, and was extremely immature. He really didn't journey anywhere, in my opinion, as he seemed essentially the same at the end of the movie as he was at the beginning. I did like how he showed a sensitive artistic side in some boxes he made. The movie just didn't touch me much other than that.

I have read ""C.O.G."" several times as I own the book, ""Naked"", and I read his books like crazy in college and find them even more poignant as a working adult now.  I must say: the movie is not the same.  Don't expect the same story you read that Sedaris wrote; it won't be in this film.  There were some golden scenes/lines that made it in (like the crabs part --- aaah!).  I did appreciate the approach that was taken, and the fragility and humility that was imitated strategically, even if I was a bit thrown off by the perspective of the director (that is to say, I imagined everything much differently because the book had such vast differences).  If you're a Sedaris fan, do NOT expect the version you know as well as I (and we) do, but it was a good movie.  I wasn't left empty or doubtful. It wasn't slow or without finality to me because I understood it as a piece of someone's life, not the whole story, and that may only be because I know how things progress somewhat (again, Sedaris fan...).  I have not liked most movies that have come out lately, but this one was pretty good.  I bought it.  I don't regret it.  I will watch it again.",1392163200,,1201,4.223684210526316

5921188,3,B00EJGMF22,"If you want a movie with some amazing acting, then this is a movie for you. From the incredible job that Jonathan Groff did, to Denis O'Hare (wow!), to an itty bitty role by Sean Stockwell that was still incredible, to Corey Stoll (again, a tiny role, but WOW!). People who were only a step-above walk-ons were simple terrific! The scenery and photography were wonderful.

Then there was the story... The only thing I can imagine is that the first and final reel of the version I watched were missing. Or once again, artsy-fartsy was the name of the game.  I do know this. If I hear that a move has come out that was written by Kyle Patrick Alvarez, for the rest of my life I will eat ground glass before I would watch anything this man wrote again. I know it was supposedly based on a story by David Sedaris--who I think is a master writer--but I don't believe it. David is wonderful. This script? Well, if I use the words I want to use, Amazon won't post my review. One of those words is four letters, starts with an ""S"" and ends with a ""T.""

I am a gay man. WHY is it that people think that to tell a gay story, it has to be a story with no beginning and no end? Does the author think he is being a master because his story has no...well....story?

I was SO angry that I WASTED my time with this movie that I wanted to scream!  I am so sorry Johathan Groff!  I wanted to email you and tell you how awesome this movie was--because you were incredible!  And maybe (and I will only say maybe) Kyle Patrick Alvarez is a really really good director. I know something was wonderful about this movie...

But when it ended I was stunned. I kept checking to see if maybe there was a mistake. Was I missing a disk? Was there a scratch on my disk and that is why part of the movie wouldn't play?  Finally I saw that, no--this is where Kyle Patrick Alvarez intended the movie to end. With not ONE resolution at all. Nothing between the main character and his family, nothing to explain if he was in fact gay or not, no resolution between Jonathan's character and ANYONE else in the movie at all. Here I am an hour later, still saying, WTF!

I am so torn. In some ways I want you to avoid this movie like a bad case of the crabs. On the other hand, everyone who helped make this movie happen--them I want you to watch this film for. Even the lady that Jonathan worked with on an assembly line--she was incredible!  And maybe that was because of the director?  Maybe he should stick with directing and skip writing EVER EVER EVER again?

I'm pissed!  When I watch movies about straight characters, the movie has a beginning, a middle, and an end. So often when I watch a gay movie I am left pissed off or totally unsatisfied. Once again, that is what happened.

I cannot believe or accept that the Sedaris story was like this!  I thought I had all of his books. I will have to look and see if it is better than this movie. After all...it couldn't be worse.

This and a couple of ideas is what I took away from this movie. I never heard of Jonathon Groff before this movie, but he played this character well, but only a few scenes (mind you these were a little intense) that he actually had to convey true emotion. The other times he just played the observer. Either way, I really liked this movie and glad it was Jonathon who was selected to play the part.",1389657600,,831,4.509933774834437

5921194,4,B00EJGMF22,"For those who admire the writings of David Sedaris (essays and short stories - Barrel Fever, Naked (1997), Holidays on Ice (1997), Me Talk Pretty One Day (2000), Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim (2004), and When You Are Engulfed in Flames (2008, Squirrel Seeks Chipmunk: A Modest Bestiary, and  Let's Explore Diabetes with Owls (2013) and thus know that much of Sedaris's humor is autobiographical and self-deprecating, and often concerns his family life, his middle-class upbringing in the suburbs of Raleigh, North Carolina, Greek heritage, being out as a gay man, jobs, education, drug use, obsessive behaviors and his life in France, London, and the English South Downs) will be pleased to see his humor translated to the screen by writer/director Kyle Patrick Alvarez. The other aspect of this at times controversial film that makes it important is the choice of casting Jonathan Groff, the gay actor who begins the television series `Looking' this spring. The choices make the film even more enjoyable because the emphasis is not on the gay aspect but instead on the trials of coming of age and struggling with all the bulwarks society places in our way.

David (meant to be David Sedaris) is a cocky young man who graduates from Yale, yet to escape his dysfunctional family and see the world as it really is, travels to Oregon to work on an apple farm run by Hobbs (Dean Stockwell). Struggling as a non-Hispanic worker he is befriended by a driver named Curly (Corey Stoll) who picks up on David's sexual ambiguity and attempts to seal his fate. David escapes, falls under the wing Jon (Denis O'Hare), a evangelistic Christian who has a history of alcohol addition and anger management all of which he hides under the cloak of being a C.O.G. (Child of God). David joins Jon in making jade clocks in the shape of Oregon to sell at the fair. He `sees the light' and decides to become a C.O.G. and from there the story plays out in very strange ways. Out of his element, he finds his lifestyle and notions being picked apart by everyone who crosses his path. And his final coming out realization is gently subtle.

The cast is uniformly excellent, but the major kudos go to Jonathan Groff who demonstrates his fine acting skills and magnetic screen presence. The film is after all just a story about a boy of our times. It resonates well. Grady Harp, January 14",1388793600,,2372,4.752427184466019

5921201,4,B00EJGMF22,"I've always been a fan of David Sedaris, and I've read most of his books.  Funny stuff.  That being said, I surely wouldn't want to be in his family.  Could you imagine hanging out on Christmas, and then having something bad happen?  You'd have to figure that you'd be featured in his next book.  And not necessarily in a good way.

And from what I've read, this is just a small slice of Mr. Sedaris' life; what you might call his ""Oregon years.""  Off to go find himself, pick a few apples, and get away from that family of his for awhile.  Hey, I can't blame him.  Time spent with extended family is time lost, time that you'll never get back.  I think that I'd rather pick apples in the rain myself.

But what's interesting here:  he seems to go full circle, perhaps backwards even since he seemingly only becomes more confused about himself -- perhaps even life itself -- while making that trip to Oregon.  Hey, you can't blame him, really.  While they have some of the best wine in the Willamette Valley, Oregon itself seems to be rather backwards.  While they want to think of themselves as modern-day liberals, at the same time, they hold onto some very conservative views as well.

And the young Mr. Sedaris runs into a few conservatives here himself, and he tries to fit in.  He really does.  But ultimately, he learns that people might be the exact opposite of how they wish to portray themselves.  Watch a scene in the third act; it reminds me of a similar scene in ""The Color of Money"" where Paul Newman throws some money at Tom Cruise, telling the youngster that he's given him all that he's got, and that the young pool upstart has to find his own way in life.

And while this film surely doesn't give all that it's got, it is very good.  I'll give a recommendation on this film.  Just stay away from family at Christmastime and everything will be all right.",1388016000,7,1871,4.425219941348973
5921202,5,B00EJGMF22,"...Not exactly the kind of movie that movie buffs usually appreciate, and the mixed reviews are probably indicators of that.
This Sedaris/Alvarez concoction was brilliant to *not* give superfluous or unnecessary back-story, and equally brilliant to not whittle down the experience into an expectant happy ending.  Like a poem or song lyric or a painting, the story opens and closes, illustrating (as a portrait) a time of the life of an individual.  The movie's pace is very thoughtful and relaxed: you are not rushed from scene to scene or met with quixotic & unnecessary edits.  There are some moments in films that are so essential to an emotional connection to the characters and the plot, and Alvarez seems to have been clever and careful in keeping that in the scene.

To start the film, the lead character is on his own, and on an interstate bus ride from his school of Yale in Connecticut, to Oregon.  When he meets up with his girlfriend in Oregon, he begins to realize that his relationship is ending.  Though they both had romanticized living a slower-paced rural life together, he was actually serious and she was not: she moved on to another man.  He ends up forging the rural workman's path alone, finding a job at an orchard, picking apples, and staying in workers' living quarters with a Hispanic population, and later quirky Christian stoneworker.  The movie's content is largely based on the interaction he has with others that come into his life to ""help"" him in his travels.  The acting in the whole cast is fantastic, and really fitting to each role and purpose.

As the title unabbreviated lends the word ""cog,"" this was exactly the sentiment one leaves the film with: that the lead character was a cog for the physical and psychological needs of others.  In being sensitive, and of a moderate or passive heart, he became a tool.  He is respected, loved, or valued by the people of the world that claim to want to help him, but their value of him only lasts insofar as he fits their expectations, demands, and gratifies them.  He is appreciated only when he completes the picture for another person's egosyntony: from the early moments with his girlfriend, to the last moments of having out-sold the stone worker.  Throughout cog, the harmful idiosyncrasies and paradoxical nature of people becomes illuminated, and it raises the question of what it means to ""help"" one another: how limited that help can become when the ""helpee"" is not obeisant or a reflection of the values system of the ""helper.""

However, the lead character is not without his own paradoxes: he plays a kind of telephonic cat-and-mouse game with his mother -- wanting to not meet with her, but calling to keep her informed that he is alright.  In the end, since sexuality is a theme throughout the film, one can only assume that his sexuality and/or scholastic hiatus is the source of the conflict between he and his mother, as well as his former girlfriend.  C.O.G. is a beautiful (but dark) snapshot of the nature being alive on the battlefield of discovering who you are.

This seems to be the biggest and most important plot line b/c it would make sense that this disagreement informs the main character's motivations and the predicament he is in.

The protagonist, David aka Samuel aka David drops out from his high powered academic life to explore life outside of his world at Yale. The character is sarcastic and narcissistic and generally unlikeable. He has no clue how to relate to others outside of his intellectual circle. He is rude and condescending to the people he meets and has no problem shooting barbs at others unlike himself. Then, at a critical point in the story, he doesn't have the guts to stand up to his antagonist. When he gets a second chance to stand up to him, he fails even more miserably, as his veneer of arrogance collapses and he is left as a cowardly shriveled shell of a man.
As a supposedly smart guy, he doesn't have the basic common sense to secure his cash somewhere other than stuffed down the side of his bed frame in full view of others in a laborers dormitory.
He does not see the frailties and vulnerabilities of the people around him. He befriends a troubled but well meaning man mainly to lean on him for help. Because of his lack of insight, David antagonizes and alienates him.

In addition, the very premise of the the movie is problematic: a graduate student of Yale wishes to experience hardship, somewhat inanely, among various communities in Oregon: Farmers, factory and migrant workers, evangelizing christians, are conceived here as the unwashed, ignorant, bigoted, and unprogressive poor. In the eyes of this young man, their belief systems are a blight on life in general and a source of distress for him in particular. However, being apparently helpless against the ignorant masses, he has no answers and nor will he terminate his voluntary foray into their lives.  So he just suffers among them for the duration of his planned time there.  He doesn't start to understand this life differently and they never start to see him differently.

The writing labors. A lot of bad language is employed, and crass humor abounds.  Throughout the shoddy plot, much contrived discomfort is suffered.  The acting is poor, the settings unnecessarily bleak.
