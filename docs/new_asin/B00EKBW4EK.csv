8606294,5,B00EKBW4EK,"Johnny English 2003 movie is a great movie from start to finish. Rowan Atkinson plays Johnny English and his side kick Bough which is played by Ben Miller must investigate the mysterious theft of the British Crown Jewels. Natalie Imbruglia plays Lorna Campell who helps both Johnny English and Bough solve the crime. Have fun with this one.
Johnny English Reborn 2011 is another great movie. Rowan Atkinson once again plays Johnny English . This time he teams up with Daniel Kaluuya and Rosamund Pike. Gillian Anderson plays his boss. Dominic West plays a double agent who kills to get the three keys to unlock a box which has a deadly drug. So he can use the drug on Gillian Anderson so she can kill the Chinese Prime Minster. This one is a lot of fun.",1416960000,,753,4.544117647058823
