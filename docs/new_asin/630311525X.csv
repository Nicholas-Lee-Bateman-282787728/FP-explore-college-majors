Spoiler Alert for those of you who want to see the episode..
In this one we get to see Worf's coming of age ceremony with the Klingon Pain Sticks in the holodeck.  While Wes, O'Brien and Dr. Pulaski look on..  also this one has Riker's father.  He's been absent pretty much all of the time.  He tells Riker he's hurting his career and has to move on.  It would have been a variation of the formula if Will Riker did take command temporarily and returned to the Enterprise.  I can't understand as to how he did keep turning down promotions and Starfleet still offered him the chair.  Oh well, that's going to change with the new film ""Nemesis.""",1017532800,,683,4.459677419354839
7839826,4,630311525X,"""The Icarus Factor"" is the first Next Generation episode to deal explicitly with the idea that the crew of the Enterprise has become a family.  There are two plot lines in the episode, both dealing with how Riker and Worf are alienated from their families and both establishing that the spair has found a home on the Enterprise.  The episode begins with a threat to our happy little family.  Commander Riker has been offered command of the Aries along with a sensitive mission.  Just to make things interesting the person sent to brief Riker is his father, Kyle, and it becomes very clear that these two would have to work really hard just to have a strained relationship (which involves martial arts fought blindfolded with large sticks).  Meanwhile, Worf is about to celebrate the tenth anniversary of his age of ascension, but as the only Klingon in Starfleet he has no one with whom he can share the moment (which involves a ritual that uses pain sticks).
It is always interesting to me how enlightened Starfleet is by giving Riker a choice to accept a new command or not.  You have to admire any sort of military structure that allows such freedom of choice, unless, of course, the episode is written so that Starfleet actually issues orders or something like that.  The relationship between Riker and his father is a bit overblown: Apparently they have not seen each other for fifteen years and they can not have a civil conversation unless they are beating each other up on the holodeck.  The situation with Worf offers a nice counterpoint, because his situation is more understated.  Certainly the resolution to that plotline is more in keeping with the idea of family.",973814400,,1677,4.775086505190312
