8273328,5,B0019BI12S,"I'll start off by saying this movie is a little off kilter for most, so it stands to reason that most probably won't like it.  Now if you don't mind dark humor or even enjoy it, then you'll find yourself laughing at this very enjoyable piece of kiwi cinema.  The story telling in it is just well done, sure some acting may be a little over the top but it really sells the story and makes for some great characters and great scenes.  I found this gem thanks to my equally twisted friend who let me borrow his copy, and I'm glad I picked up my own copy.  This is a great movie to watch with some friends and a few beers.",1332892800,,618,4.040983606557377
