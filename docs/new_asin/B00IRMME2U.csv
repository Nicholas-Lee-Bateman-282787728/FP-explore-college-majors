6290308,2,B00IRMME2U,"The science content is interesting and up to date but in terms of coming away with an idea of how to actually practice being mindful, this film leaves you wondering.  You get that it's a great idea and would serve us all well if we could be more mindful in our daily lives, but this is not a HowTo DVD.",1399161600,6,302,4.033333333333333

6290310,1,B00IRMME2U,"It is very difficult to find suitable videos for a treatment program, particularly an alcohol/drug treatment program. Spent 25 dollars on this but wish I had viewed it streaming as I would have saved myself some money. It is a big misfire.  I'm not sure who this is good for. The mindful/less couple were really irritating and simplistic and reinforced gender stereotypes that women are more insightful, in-tune, centered than men, which, I can tell you as a clinician is not the case. The script writers couldn't even have them share the challenges of being mindless and becoming mindful. Plus her script and performance were condescending and he seemed like a dolt. A total mistake to include. Further, it just kept repeating the marketing without any real exploration of the how, or at least not enough of what one would expect to be included. Very surface. One good section on brain mechanisms but one can get that anywhere. A couple of good commentaries but all too brief.",1464998400,15,977,4.850299401197605

6290322,5,B00IRMME2U,A good introduction into mindfulness and what it is all about before getting to the meditation DVDs. It more or less explains the need for the meditation,1442016000,2,153,4.703703703703703

6290331,1,B00IRMME2U,"I expected a lot more from this movie. I love Dan Millman and I've read all of his books. This is the main reason I bought this movie because I saw it mentioned on his website, but he hardly appears in this movie. I loved all the 'What The Bleep' movies and 'The Secret' and I thought  'The Mindfulness Movie' would be the next step on from these movies but it fell very short of my expectations. I really learnt nothing new.

6290335,4,B00IRMME2U,The movie gives a nice basic review of the basis of mindfulness.  It has great and knowledgeable people in it and helps the viewers to understand better what Mindfulness is.  Even though I agree with other reviewers that the Mindless and Mindful representation could be done differently.  The most important part of it is that at least the concept of Mindfulness and its benefits are exposed in a secular way which takes away the limited believe about Mindfulness being a religious or new age practice.,1422144000,,502,4.882352941176471
6290336,1,B00IRMME2U,70 minutes of the benifits mindfulness but zero minutes on how to practice. This movie has great potential with all the big names in the field but failed to even mention how to become mindful. The word breathing was mentioned once in a sentence but not referred to as a way of gaining mindfullness.,1422144000,6,298,4.537037037037037
6290337,4,B00IRMME2U,Nicely done.  Helps make connections for people who are learning about mindfulness.  Lends itself well to excerpts.,1421625600,,115,5.705882352941177

6290339,1,B00IRMME2U,"Awful! Really poorly done.

Had really loud distracting music throughout that was soo loud that you have to struggle to hear what the people were saying.

There were these skits too with a 'mindful' and a 'mindless' person with terrible acting and horrible dialogue.

Fantastic topic, poorly executed.

Felt like i was watching a really bad infomercial.",1421020800,8,353,5.140350877192983
6290340,5,B00IRMME2U,I highly recommend this movie for anyone seeking a gentle reminder of how plugged in and tuned out we are most of the time.  It's a very fun and entertaining film while at the same time delivers a very deep message.  It's fun and inspirational and a good start on the path to a more fulfilling and present life.,1420502400,,311,4.254237288135593

6290343,1,B00IRMME2U,"This is one of the WORST movies ever made about this important topic.  Paul Harrison does a fine job of discussing the research and the benefits.  But then there are these constant inserts of a couple (man and woman) who wear t-shirts that say ""Mindful"" and ""Mindless"" on them - as if the audience is still in pre-school.  The couple interacts and attempts to demonstrate what mindfulness is.  Unfortunately it functions on the worst stereotypes of gender disparity - the man doesn't 'pay attention' to his female friend and she has to call him out on it over and over and OVER!  Mindfulness is not about hitting people over the head with some ""morality"" about who is more mindful and who doesn't measure up.  DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO UNLESS YOU WANT TO TURN SOMEONE OFF TO MINDFULNESS PRACTICE.",1418083200,5,792,4.661870503597123

6290345,5,B00IRMME2U,"Mindfulness is a concept that most of us have learned at one time or another, but have let it sort of slip away--at least, that describes me.  The movie is a little over one hour long, and the subject is artfully and entertainingly presented.  I felt somewhat serene and more relaxed after I watched it.

One small example that has been useful in my life:  We have no control over events that swirl around us, but we do have control over how we choose to react to them.  Example:  Some guy on the freeway gets angry at you, yells and flips you off. You have the choice to yell back at him (elevating your breathing and heart rate at the same time) or shake your head and smile, glad that you're not the other driver.  Mindfulness. But I don't always react as calmly as I should.  Mindfulness, the movie reminds us, takes practice.

I watched this movie by myself, when it came, and the next day with my 13 year-old son.  He said he got something out of it. Perhaps he was just being mindful.",1417305600,10,991,4.308108108108108

6290348,3,B00IRMME2U,"The film has a couple playfully bantering in between segments; the female wears a t-shirt saying ""Mindfulness"" and the male wears a shirt that reads, ""Mindless."" This t-shirt segment seemed awfully low budget. These segments are supposed to be light and engaging but I found the female character's role annoying rather than educational. She seemed demeaning and judgmental of her partner. How is that representing Mindfulness?!? Also, while there are some true gems in this video, the wonderful experts were rushed through while the non-experts are given a lot of time to develop their thoughts. I really wanted to hear more from the experts! I wish more emphasis was given to the experts' insights; (for example, the production could have added text only frames of the experts' most salient quotes in order to really underscore the experts' main points). I bought the video to show to students of a Health Psych class but I think they will find it mostly boring. A shame. It's such an important topic but I believe this video could use some tweaking.",1415059200,24,1051,4.943502824858757

6290353,3,B00IRMME2U,Good intro to the general idea of mindfulness and who finds it useful but unfortunately there was little practical detail. It would not necessarily provide practical help for clients.,1407715200,,183,5.344827586206897

6290358,4,B00IRMME2U,"The movie was great and inspired me to continue and strengthen my own mindfulness practice. The only negative was the 2 actors, mindful and mindless.

6290359,1,B00IRMME2U,"I confess I had to watch this mindlessly in order to get through it. Whose idea was it to have the two ""humorous"" interlude characters, Mindful and Mindless illustrating (I guess) the point of the previous sections of the movie? If mindfullness turns you into a Flaming High-Maintenance Bitch, then I guess the point was well illustrated. I started feeling really badly for Mr. Napolean Dynamite Clueless.

Then the editors got this clever idea to create whole spoken thoughts by cutting together the mini sound-bites of as many of the contributing interviewees as possible. Was this some clever challenge to my mindfulness? Or were they trying to make the point that all the interviewees had said the same thing and wanted to make sure they all got credit for the thought?

Back to the architectural drawing board on this one.",1406332800,,827,4.9

6290362,3,B00IRMME2U,"This movie had great potential to be as good as Leap or Bleep, but the red, white and blue people were so annoying, it was difficult to sit through and eventually, I just skipped ahead when they were bantering back and forth.  There are lots of better movies on the subject, but I like to support this genre, just so they keep making more movies and hopefully better ones in the future.",1405123200,2,386,4.361111111111111

6290365,5,B00IRMME2U,"As a mindfulness teacher, author and workshop leader, I have shown some clips of The Mindfulness Movie in my workshops and it has gotten a wonderful reception. The film is extremely well produced, visually appealing, and features a lot of variety in the topics covered. In particular, it does an excellent job of explaining mindfulness--and I think you will be hard-pressed to find a more complete and wide-ranging description of the essence of mindfulness. The Mindfulness Movie examines cutting-edge approaches for how mindfulness is being used to help returning veterans and in schools--and the stories of these individuals were emotionally compelling. I really enjoyed the informative and empowering segment on the neuroscience of mindfulness, and how practicing practicing mindfulness for just a few minutes a day can change the brain. I recommend this for individuals who want a better grasp of mindfulness-- as well as for wellness coaches, teachers, therapists and others who want to motivate and educate those they are working with about the many benefits of a mindfulness practice.",1401753600,31,1091,5.385964912280702

8644816,4,B00IRMME2U,"I show this in an anger management class I teach.  I agree with some of the reviewers that the cut scenes involving the couple are kind of cheesy, and most of the time I fast forward over them in the interest of time and to keep the audience's attention.  While the video does not teach particular mindfulness skills, it does a good  job of illustrating the benefits of mindfulness on the brain, and instills hope in the ability to change by demonstrating the brain's ability to make new neural pathways.  The section on veterans is most helpful because it shows a group of real people who benefited from Mindfulness training, and anger is talked about.  I think that because this video does not teach skills or emphasize the eastern roots of mindfulness actually makes this more palatable for some clients, as I do encounter some clients who are resistant to those beliefs and/or meditations due to their religious principles or worldviews.",1530489600,,941,4.819875776397516
