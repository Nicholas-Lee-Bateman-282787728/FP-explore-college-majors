6340240,3,B00J9BZ4QQ,"I agree with all the posters that say Born to Be Wild is fabulous, and the Arctic movie is horrible. Born to Be Wild is one of the best 3D documentaries I have seen. They really made use of the 3D. I thought maybe this was standard with the IMAX films, but after watching a handful of them, I realize that this truly is one of the best they've done. My children also really enjoyed the subject matter. The baby orangutans and elephants are adorable. I liked that while their back stories were a bit sad, that is not what the film focused on. It focused on the hope of the reintroduction of the animals into the wild. It focused on how there are still good people in the world willing to help. So, while it mentions the problem (poachers and people destroying habitat) it didn't make this documentary into a huge downer or a guilt trip. They did a good job at keeping the propaganda to a minimum. And the movie is all the richer as a result.

To The Arctic was horribly done. The 3D was practically non existent (aside from some computer enhanced snow flakes in the opening). They spent very little time showing the animals. The propaganda was some of the thickest I have ever had to wade through. The tone of the whole thing was a downer and as a result none of us enjoyed it. Once it was finished we threw on Born to be Wild again just to get the bad taste out of our mouths.

I'm glad I paid about the same for the double feature as I would have for just the one show. To the Arctic will be headed To the Trash.",1430611200,,1513,4.178082191780822

6340243,4,B00J9BZ4QQ,"These documentary type shows are both pretty interesting. I really liked the Born To Be Wild 3D showing the care for baby orangutans and elephants. Just adorable. The African scenes were stunning with a true 3D appearance.

The ""To The Arctic"" show was interesting and informative although not so appealing probably because most of the scenes are among the snow/ice background. I did like the story about how a mother polar bear will do anything necessary to insure the survival of her cubs. The Alaskan 3D scenes are pretty good.

Overall, these are pretty cool (~hot & cold:) 3D IMAX DVDs to watch and share with others.",1426464000,,622,4.803738317757009
6340244,5,B00J9BZ4QQ,Dynamic duo 3D adventures. Born to be Wild and To the Arctic are both good IMAX films. Personally I think Born to be Wild is the stronger of the two. It's an adventure/animal film but it's also quite touching. I would highly recommend this combo package. Both are worth buying. Highly recommended.,1426464000,,297,4.730769230769231
6340245,3,B00J9BZ4QQ,"Born to be wild is worth the entire price of this double feature.  It has outstanding 3D and an awesome story to tell.  I would have easily paid to see this in a theater.  The arctic film - not so much.  Due to the fact that much of the scenery is white, the 3D is less than impressive.  And, the narration and story are lacking.  I wanted to like it because I am intrigued by arctic animals, but I found myself not caring very much.  So, this set is definitely worth it - but only because ""Born to be Wild"" is a part of it.",1426118400,2,524,3.933333333333333

6340247,5,B00J9BZ4QQ,"Born to Be Wild was the documentary which was part of the PBS documentary&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Wild-Affair/dp/B00JJRLGCG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Wild Affair</a>. Watching the cry, the tears of Daphne Sheldrick for Aisha, is truly the most painful part of the whole documentary. No one should cry like that although her cry is a cry of a mother who has lost a child, a very caring mother who made me cry as well. Thank you Daphne for all that you have done. The IMAX version is a very fun documentary especially for kids.

To The Arctic is out of this world documentary where you will witness the wild beauty of none other than The white majestic Arctic. It is an landscape that it is nearly impossible to inhabit but with the magic of IMAX you will be able to witness the amazing families who have made this pure blue and white beauty their home in an uncompromising cinematography that watching it once will not be enough. To The Arctic is one of the best forty minutes of IMAX productions since the air and the environment of the Arctic is so cold, clean and pristine that the species who survive there are as resilient and as grand as the surrounding. Meryl Streeps narration certainly adds to the quality of this spectacular adventure by IMAX . A must see documentary. Bravo, bravo, bravo.

P.S. Walmart charged me more for this DVD.",1425686400,2,1400,4.953191489361702

8648956,4,B00J9BZ4QQ,"As others have said of this double feature To the Arctic though containing some very charming scenes of the polar bears does not lend itself well to the 3-D format because there's really nothing to contrast the white of the animals and the environment.
The other feature Born to be Free is really worth having due to the crisp clear 3-D presentation and the fascinating subject matter regarding  the
lifestyle of Elephants and various monkeys...
Much to be earned and highly entertaining
Strongly recommended for the entire family",1460419200,,530,5.0227272727272725
8648957,5,B00J9BZ4QQ,My family loved this moved.  The Born to be Wild had amazing 3D effects.  That movie alone made the price worth while!,1451260800,,118,4.318181818181818
8648958,5,B00J9BZ4QQ,"I really like the Born Wild it's heart warming to know that there are people out there who are doing what they can to save these unfortunate orphaned animals. To The Artic is more of a lecture on global warming than an adventure with the polar bears. The 3D is very good and is IMAX quality, 3D is a little lacking on the polar bears but I expect that's because they could not get as close to them to bring out the 3D shots.",1449878400,,424,4.059523809523809
8648959,4,B00J9BZ4QQ,"I would have given this five stars if the 3D had been effectively used in To The Arctic. It is not very good and looks as though it was both an afterthought and a cash grab. There are so many missed opportunities for great 3D moments. There wasn't a single ""wow"" shot and it makes me wonder if it was never even intended to be in 3D. I was very disappointed with this part of the feature. On the complete opposite end of the spectrum is Born To Be Wild. It is an amazing documentary with brilliant 3D visuals. If you enjoy 'before the window' 3D then you will be pleased. I saw it in an IMAX theater and loved it then and it translated exceptionally well to my 60"" HD3D TV. I highly recommend this purchase for Born To Be Wild alone.",1447632000,,733,4.1328671328671325
8648960,3,B00J9BZ4QQ,Watch Born to be Wild and throw away To The Arctic. Born To Be Wild was great and the 3D was excellent. To The Arctic was one huge advertisement for global warming and didn't tell you anything about the Arctic other than as a species humans are destroying it.
