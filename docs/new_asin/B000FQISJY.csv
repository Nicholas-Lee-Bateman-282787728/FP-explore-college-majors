2581823,5,B000FQISJY,"Its as if this anime was made just for me.  I'm a big anime fan, but mainly for the serious ones. I've seen pretty much every anime {that I care to see}  As of late, there were only Naruto and Bleach on my radar. But sometimes they tend to get off the serious and into the silly. I HATE that. I like comedy anime. But not when its one and the same with the action anime.

  All of a sudden I come across this.  OMG !!!  Its beautiful !! Every ep. is beautifully drawn. Its about rival ninja clans.

1 - Its not too long. Appx 20 eps. give or take.

2 - Its serious and STR8 to the point. Theres comedy here and there but its very light and doesn't last long. {The way I like-em}

3 - Its not kid friendly. By no means is this the bloodiest anime I've seen, but heads will roll and bones will crack and ..... well you knowhatamean.

 All n All .... this was a GREAT escape from the norm. All the other animes I've seen lately are beating around the bush or acting silly or just too dang long to hold my interest.  Highly recomended",1174176000,,1030,3.9901960784313726

Well done Anime. It's about time.

I haven't enjoyed a film from this genre since Ninja Scroll.

A little over the top with a couple characters, but the Romeo and Juliet-like plot makes it an easy classic for your collection.",1173398400,,310,5.03921568627451
2581825,5,B000FQISJY,"I couldnt/cant stop watching this show. Just 1 of many good anime in last 3-4 years. I've had the series from import discs so hopefully the dubs sounds good.

No foolish comedic pieces here. This is pure action and story. Get the series, you won't be disappointed.",1157760000,3,264,4.617021276595745
2581826,5,B000FQISJY,"Not since HBO `s Spwan, The Ninja Scroll movie , and the original Heavy Metal ( 1981), has there been any real decent mature (adult) animation. Let alone one with a plot.

Basilisk is one of four anime from Funimation that gears towards mature ( less skittish) veiwers. The animation is beautifully done, and is well acted on both dubs. The story makes Romeo&Juliet` s situation look like a bad B-rated romance movie. In the first episode, you already have good guess on how things are going to turn out. Kinda like the anime Berserk ( another good one). You automatically know your characters are not going to have a happy ending. However, you`re  curious on how the characters get to that point. I admit it, I am curious.

Speaking of Berserk. Basilisk is violent. There is no-stepping away from that. Keep in mind you are dealing with warriors and cold blooded killers. Not to mention a war itself. Things are never pretty in war, and kid show like Naruto dosen`t even shy away from that brutal truth. and seeing the true ugliness of human nature in all forms. Not recommended for younger viewers under 15. Much like what Berserk was. Berserk in my opinion was more about the dangers of following ambitions, and becoming a slave to it. Basilisk I can give a few opinions on, but I want to see the whole series before I set anything in stone. So far, Basilisk looks to be a promising series.

I have to admit, Funimation new adult four is looking to interesting all together. For those that are ultra-nonskittish, check out Speed Grapher.",1157673600,3,1540,4.6300366300366305
2581827,5,B000FQISJY,I enjoyed this very much.  I was waiting for another anime to come out that looked like the Ninja Scrolls movie.  Each ninja has their own special power.  I can't wait to watch the rest of the episodes.,1155340800,4,202,4.2631578947368425
2581828,5,B000FQISJY,"Based on the like-named manga, BASILISK is an intense, violent, and grim fantasy/action ninja series (24 episodes in all -- the first DVD release contains eps. 1 - 4).

This is, for my money, one of the finest anime series ever released by Gonzo (or any anime company, for that matter). Beautifully and stylistically animated with imaginative (and sometimes nutty) character designs and fluid fight sequences, and backed by a brilliant musical score to boot, BASILISK is both a visual and audio feast. But don't be fooled by its initial beauty -- at its core this is a brutal and unforgiving show that is aimed at adult audiences.

The basic plot is quite simple: In Japan, 1614 AD, in order to settle a growing dispute over which of the Shogun's two sons should succeed him, the government lifts a peace agreement between the bitter rivals of the Kouga and Iga clans and pits ten ninja from each clan against each other. As each clan represents one of the Shogun's sons, the winners and their clan will enjoy one thousand years of prosperity, while the losing ninjas will likely be annihilated in the fracas.

After quickly establishing this scenario in the first episode, the series then swiftly cuts to the chase, with ninja after ninja battling it out in a bloody and unmerciful clash to the death. The twist is that each ninja has a different type of power, and each side is unaware of exactly what their enemies' superhuman abilities are. This element of surprise works to great advantage for some, but what may work well against one opponent, may prove to be a glaring weakness against another.

The ninjas' powers are far from realistic, and characters are routinely vanquished after they've been barely introduced, but overall the storytellers do a very good job of bringing forth a large cast of colorful characters and giving them vivid enough personalities to make us genuinely care about what happens to them.

Caught in the middle of this dire situation are the innocent Oboro and the wise Gennosuke, who form a sort of ""Romeo and Juliet""-style couple. She is the heir to the leadership of the Iga clan. He is the heir to the leadership of the Kouga clan. They are deeply in love with each other and had hoped that their upcoming marriage would finally put an end to all the bad blood boiling over between the two clans. Their plans are, of course, shattered once the peace agreement is broken, but amidst the increasing bloodshed and body count, Oboro rebels against her ruthless compatriots and holds out hope that she might in some way be able to curtail the madness before it reaches its inevitable finality. But can her innocence survive as the ninja war becomes more and more intense?

Ninja fans expecting the lighthearted, comedic antics of NARUTO or the wisecracking heroics of NINJA SCROLL, or even the bloody but inconsequential fisticuffs of the highschool fightfest TENJHO TENGE, may be stunned by the grim and merciless violence on display here. Character after character is dispatched of, sometimes in painfully graphic ways. Here violence is not clean and without consequences; characters don't take a beating and bounce back with smiles on their faces (well, maybe one does, but that's all).

As such, there are no conventional ""good guys"" to be found in this harsh ""kill or be killed"" scenario. When one ninja triumphs over another, there's no sense of exhilarating victory. The tone is more bitter than sweet, because each killing only further taints the soul of victor and prolongs the senseless carnage. And in a world in which the government not only condones such pointless slaughter, but actively encourages it, how can humanity survive? Revenge is indeed a vicious circle, and by showing us just how unrelentingly ugly and inhumane it can get, BASILISK puts the hurt and pain back into animated violence.",1151971200,39,3843,4.875957120980092

8125504,5,B000FQISJY,"Basilisk takes place in 1614 during the Tokugawa Shogunate era. Two ninja clans are at war with each other competing to win the favor of the regime for the next 1000 years. Each clan has to choose 10 members. Whichever clan kills the 10 members of their rival wins.

There are a lot of awesome things to say about this anime. The animation, the music, and the story line are all great. Almost all , of the characters are too. There are a few ninjas I didn't like though. One guy kills you with his hair, one guy is a quadriplegic that kills you with a knife that he holds with his tongue, and one dude turns into goo when he touches salt. Most of the other ninjas are awesome though. The bad guy is really a heartless bastard. It makes it very interesting when you have a bad guy that is way evil. The characters really keep you interested and the carnage never lets up.

I really think anyone that likes anime would get a kick outta this one. If you like it there's a live action movie called Shinobi. It's the same story line with a few less characters. It's incredible as well.

Definitely give Basilisk a look see.",1354060800,,1118,4.289099526066351

8125507,1,B000FQISJY,"I like a variety of animes, but this just isn't one of them.  I couldn't even get past the first episode.  First of all, I always watch in Japanese with subtitles, as I prefer original format, so I can't speak for the dubbed version, if there was one on there.  I found the story to be convoluted, the artwork to be shabby in comparison to other loved animes, and the characters not at all compelling or people I could become attached to (a critical hook for me).  I honestly didn't care if any or all of them died.  But, I'm also not a horror fan (except Resident Evil), and don't like action scenes that are violent for the sake of violence without tasteful combat, which is all I could figure out that this anime offered.  I prefer animes like Witch Hunter Robin, or Trigun, so perhaps this is a genre more reserved for people with different tastes than my own.",1199577600,,864,4.36875

Even the music is good (unlike some other anime series like Rurouni Kenshin, when you can't stop wondering why should the music of such a wonderful series be so horrible!)

Not the best choice for kids, but definitely a perfect choice for adults!",1187481600,,376,4.611940298507463
8125509,5,B000FQISJY,"This anime is so hot it can't be shown on standard cable. Based on the 1958 novel The Kouga Ninja Scrolls by Futaro Yumada, Basilisk is the latest from Studio Gonzo and it shines like little else before it.

The action in Basilisk is reminiscent of Ninja Scroll, but the story is unlike anything else out there. Gennosuke is next in line for leadership of the Kouga ninja clan. Oboro is next in line for the Iga ninja. The two clans are the bitterest of enemies--with a feud going back over 400 years--yet Gennosuke and Oboro are all but betrothed. Peace is about to come to the long-feuding clans.

But in Edo, the Shogunate is undergoing a crisis of succession. Open warfare is about to break out between the factions of the Shogunate for the right to rule all of Japan. To settle this feud without sacrificing samurai of the aristocracy, the Shogun decides to let the ninja clans decide the next ruler.

He dissolves the no-hostility pact forced on the two clans hundreds of years ago and has their leaders draw up a list of the ten best ninja from each clan. With the two vying powers each represented by one of the clans, whichever clan destroys the other's best ten first will be declared the winner and gain favored status with the Shogunate for 1,000 years. Their representative and their dynasty will rule Japan.

The twenty ninja each have a unique power that is both awesome and deadly to behold. Ninki can control his hair as both an appendage and a weapon, while Kazamachi has the appearance and abilities of a spider. The sense of impending tragedy is almost unbearable at times, but the hope for an eventual reconciliation between Gennosuke and Oboro is enough to keep you watching from the edge of your seat.

The animation is crisp and beautiful, with jaw-dropping action sequences. Where the Ninja Scroll animated series failed so miserably, this series excels beyond all expectations. It's unfortunate that the content is so mature it can't be seen on standard cable here in the states, but this is one of the few series that is worth every penny of the price tag.

If I said ""this DVD wasn't all that great"" it wouldn't matter. If you didn't buy this DVD and bought all the rest because they received better reviews, you'd wind up buying this one anyways. It's pointless to have an incomplete set, plus there are tons of goodies to watch... Just buy'em all. You won't regret it.",1175644800,,459,4.476190476190476
