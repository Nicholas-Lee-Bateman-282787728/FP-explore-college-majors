8599716,2,B00E0AEYVW,"Poor Katarina -- is she ever going to stop exploiting the way she was exploited by the big, bad Communists(the political party she was quick to join, and leave for Capitalism, when it suited her needs)?  Nothing new, just a rehash of three decades of whining about how badly she was treated.  She seems to have no awareness that her ""anything to win"" attitude(including the use of dirty tricks and unsportsmanlike conduct) made her a collaborator with her evil keepers.  The suck-ups behind this documentary don't even address this and other unsavory aspects of her personality.  Katarina was controlled and spied on for sure but she was also pampered and given privileges the average East German could only dream of.  She has no awareness that she, and her family, lived the good life(by East German standards) at the expense of others.  Witt lies until she can't lie anymore then she tells the truth -- but makes excuses and blames others.  ""The Diplomat"" is a study of how a woman can live nearly half a century have no self insight.",1411603200,,1036,4.754189944134078
8599717,4,B00E0AEYVW,I only found this because I was looking for Brian Boitano videos (I am a fan). It gives me a background for Kat that explains some of her in-your-face attitude at the '88 Olympics (the first time I was exposed to her skating).,1400716800,,226,4.27906976744186
8599718,4,B00E0AEYVW,"I guess I've to credit that whole shady business with Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding for hooking me into figure skating for a number of years. I only ever saw Katarina Witt perform in the 1990s, when she was past her heyday. She still looked so damn beautiful. Espn Films has been churning out these excellent documentaries, but maybe I haven't looked forward to one such quite like I'd looked forward to Nine for IX: The Diplomat. She's the diplomat.

During the height of the Cold War era, Katarina Witt was easily East Germany's best argument in the sports world for socialist superiority. She was, after all, referred to as ""the most beautiful face of socialism."" Witt had the titles to back up her rep as one of her sport's most scintillating, most dominating figures: six European skating titles (1983-88), four world championships (1984-85, 1987-88), and consecutive Olympic gold medals (1984 and 1988).

Based on my having watched the thoroughly engrossing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ESPN-Films-Nine-for-IX-Let-Them-Wear-Towels/dp/B00E0AECV4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ESPN Films - Nine for IX:  Let Them Wear Towels</a>, color me impressed with ESPN Films' Nine for IX programming. As you know, this series' title, Nine for IX, was inspired by the equal rights legislation Title IX. As such, these documentaries seek to examine women's issues set in a sports background. The Diplomat premiered on ESPN this past Tuesday (8/6/13) and I saw it and was fascinated by it. And yet I was left... wanting more. The hour-long documentary rolls out a deceptively straightforward narrative. But if you look closer, it's trickier than that. There's a sense of ambivalence - or maybe ""guardedness"" is the better word - that Witt presents on camera.

The piece does well in establishing the relevant political and cultural climate in which Witt constantly found herself in precarious negotiation. We're made privy to the political and personal stakes, and how very crucial it was for Witt to win back to back Olympic gold medals to ensure her freedom. Katarina Witt reveals a conflicted lump of emotions, and I guess it's understandable. On one hand, she expresses her appreciation for the state's affording for her training and according her the status of the priveleged athlete. Conversely, as they say, privelege has its price. From a young age, she was the subject of constant surveillance by the Stasi, the East German secret police. She was informed upon by a myriad of friends and peers (yes, I mean you, Ingo Steuer). As per a 2012 interview Witt conducted with a UK periodical (dailymail.c0.uk), post-unification, she applied to the new German government to see the files the Stasi had compiled on her. Astoundingly Witt had garnered 3000 pages' worth of surveillance, rooting back to when she was eight years old.

There are two key turning points in the film. The first highlights the excrutiating pressure endured by Witt as she entered the 1988 Olympics in Calgary. She and her trainer, Jutta Mller, had pried a promise from the government that should Katarina win gold again - a back-to-back feat that hadn't been accomplished by a female skater in over half a century - she would be permitted to skate professionally outside East Germany. Reminiscing about Witt's successfully holding up her end of the bargain, Egon Krenz, former head of East Germany, gives out a smirky, smirky smile: ""And it was as easy as that."" The second swerve concerns the collapse of the East German government and the poverty-stricken public's ensuing vilification of Witt when they learned of how the former regime had so mollycoddled her. There's a moment in the film in which she makes her way towards her car and someone in the crowd calls her a wh0re. Witt confesses the shock that coursed thru her, and the deep hurt. In her eyes, she did nothing wrong. She believed that she had accomplished something special for her country and didn't deserve the people's ire. Oh, it's awkward, when adoration sours.

Like Witt herself, the Diplomat isn't easy to codify. It's a tricky expos that explores the demarcation between artistry and politics, privelege and exploitation, allegiance and aspiration, full disclosure and self-deception. Along the way, The Diplomat charts Witt's rise to superstardom. Archival footage include her gold-winning ""Carmen"" performance at Calgary and clearly demonstrate that her skills on ice were legit, her artistry tremendous, her passion clearly manifested.

By and large, I don't know that we get a true peek into what makes her tick.  In the end, I guess you can't blame Witt's ambivalence. Near the end of the film, Katarina reflects: ""Of course, looking back, one thing is definitely wrong - you cannot put people in a country and try to just leave them there. You live only once on this earth and you should be allowed to travel the world, to make up your own opinion. You need democracy."" Ultimately, Witt flourished in her gilded cage. I guess when one is endowed with sheer ability, a dash of clever, a streak of independence, and a knack for coming thru in the clutch, well, sir, the sky's the limit even when under the shadow of a paranoid empire. The Diplomat didn't hook me in as deeply as did Let Them Wear Towels. I still enjoyed it and very much recommend it. It's well-crafted and offers, thru the prism of sports, an intriguing look into a bygone era, when the world was held hostage by a decades-long nuclear standoff. Nowadays, I don't even remember where my nearest bomb shelter is.",1375920000,10,5573,5.076419213973799
