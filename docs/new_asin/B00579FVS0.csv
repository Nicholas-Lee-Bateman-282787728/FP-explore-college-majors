8460430,5,B00579FVS0,"After a long time with only a few Bill Elliot film on the market ( except for Red Ryder ) they really begin to come and it is great. This one is especially good. The print is sharp, Elliott is d... good and there are lots of action. I don't know what I think about Dub Taylor as sidekick but I must admit he made me laugh and Eddy Waller ( later to be Allan Lanes sidekick Nugget Clark ) makes a great performance as the judge. Highly recommended!",1359504000,,447,4.033707865168539
8460431,5,B00579FVS0,"Columbia Pictures Corporation presents ""HANDS ACROSS THE ROCKIES"" (1941) (56 min/B&W) -- Starring Bill Elliott, Mary Daily, Dub Taylor, Kenneth MacDonald, Frank LaRue, Donald Curtis, Tom Moray, Stanley Brown, Slim Whitaker, Harrison Greene, Art Mix & Eddy Waller

Directed by Lambert Hillyer

Wild Bill (Bill Elliott) and Cannonball (Dub Taylor) arrive looking for the killer of Cannonball's father only to become involved in a family feud. A man has been charged with kidnaping the girl he plans to marry. So this time Bill turns into a defense lawyer and among the opposition is the killer he is looking for. Only when the killer is revealed does Bill put his guns to work.

The supporting cast is very good, with standout performances by the two Crawley sons Frank LaRue (Rufe Crawley) and Donald Curtis (Dade Crawley), and a favorite of mine Eddie Waller (later Nugget Clark in the Rocky Lane westerns of the early 50's) as Judge Plunkett.  This role of Judge Plunkett just might have been Eddy Waller's best role during his long career.

If you're a Wild Bill Elliott fan, it just doesn't get any better than this. Highly recommend.

There is no doubt in anyone's mind that Gordon Nance from Pattonsburg, Mo, later known at William ""Wild Bill"" Elliott (the Peaceable Man) was the best Red Ryder on the big screen --- also the latest Bobby J. Copeland's book on ""Bill Elliott:The Peaceable Man"" is chuck full of answers to all the questions his fans had from early on...plenty of thrills, adventure and loaded with action. My personal favorites were the ""Red Ryder Series"" or ""The Great Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok"" an ongoing character that would appear in many films to come...as Hickok and Wild Bill Saunders. Elliott was a natural for the western, his riding abilities and fight scenes were the caliber of Buck Jones, Johnny Mack Brown and Bob Steele --- good reading for all you wranglers out there --- I found myself being transported back in time, Mr. Copeland's book has opened my eyes to what a wonderful unselfish person Bill Elliott was --- only wish I could have met him. He was one of a kind --- a peaceable man! --- published by Empire Publishing and available on Amazon and Empire Publications Inc --- it's no small wonder that William Elliott's name was at the top of the list, working with the top directors of the day Howard P. Bretherton, Spencer Gordon Bennett, Joseph Kane, Wallace A. Grissell, Leslie Selander and R.G. Springsteen all under Republic Pictures banner. Not to forget D. Ross Lederman under the Columbia Pictures banner.

Western Classics such as this one are always in demand ... all my heroes have been cowboys!
