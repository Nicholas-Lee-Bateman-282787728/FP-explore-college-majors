8148227,3,B000IZJQSO,"First of all, I'll say that the picture quality could have been better.  My copy is from Eros International.

This movie has four very important popular Bollywood actors and actresses.  First of all, it has Amitabh Bachchan, probably the most important Bollywood actor in all of India.  (His son married Aishwarya Rai, one of India's most famous international actresses (Bride and Prejudice, The Mistress of Spices, Devdas, Mohabbatein, etc) And it stars Anil Kapoor (best known now for ""Slumdog Millionaire"") and Priety Zinta (from Mission Kashmir), and Gracy Singh (from Aamir Khan's ""Lagaan: One Upon a Time in India).  With a cast like this, you'd be expecting a fabulous film.

But for me, I really hated Priety Zinta's role in this film.  She's a spoiled rich b*tch and her behavior has allowed someone to die because of her petty selfishness.  I have to forget that this is just a movie, but her behavior was really upsetting.

This film is about a doctor and a son that owns a hospital but neds some additional financing to keep, it going.  The son, Akash (Anil Kapoor) falls in love with a new doctor (Gracy Singh) that has come to work in their hospital.  But, since the hospital needs some additional financial support, an investor says that he will provide all the financial support needed if Dr. Akash marries the investor's spoiled daughter.

I guess I don't need to say more, because I don't want to spoil the end if you want to see this film.  It's worth renting once.  Check it out, as I would suggest that you check out many Bollywood films (if you don't mind reading subtitles).",1257552000,2,1597,4.739130434782608
