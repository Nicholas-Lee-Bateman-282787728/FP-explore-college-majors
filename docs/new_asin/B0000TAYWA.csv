1942855,5,B0000TAYWA,"...is a good day.  A show this creative should live on forever on tape or DVD.  Unfortunately, due to rights issues with the underlying movies, MST3K is likely to disappear forever in January.  Until that time, we have 4 more episodes to preserve for posterity, and to demonstrate to Rhino that there is an audience for this show.
""Hamlet"".  An underrated show, and a good candidate for DVD-hood.  Mike and the 'bots win a game of 3 card monte and get to select their film.  They choose ""Hamlet"" but let Pearl decide WHICH adaptation.  Instead of Kenneth Branagh's 1996 version or Zeffirelli's 1990 interpretation, they get to watch this poorly-dubbed German made-for-TV slice of warm pork.
""Space Mutiny"".  Made in the one country not subjected to endless reruns of ""Battlestar Galactica"" - South Africa.  What to do?  Why , reuse the BG opticals in the bizarre space drama.  The film can be summarized as follows:  Our hero, Big McLargeHuge, does something in a spaceship that is made of brick walls and boiler rooms.
""The Girl With Gold Boots"".  A film made when Manson walked the streets.  The less said about this one the better.
""Overdrawn at the Memory Bank"".  The kind of film your parents thought would be ok to watch since it was produced by PBS.  It even has that flat videotaped ""made in the UK"" look about it.  Little did your folks realize that making kids watch this awful Raul Julia vehicle is tantamount to child endangerment.  The film itself is a futuristic ""Casablanca"" something-or-other.  Oh, and it's hilarious!
In conclusion:  buy this collection, even if these experiments aren't your favorites.  Create demand for old MST3K episodes so that others might be released in the future.  Supplies are really limited, so act now!",1068508800,8,1748,4.854237288135593
1942856,4,B0000TAYWA,"I knew there would be at least a few reviews that dismissed the SciFi era in favor of the Comedy Central years. The arguments seem to center around the host segments, which, in my opinion, are hardly the most important part of the show. Yes, one gets to feel some attachment to the characters, but the premise of MST3K is people making fun of bad movies, and in my opinion the SciFi era represents the pinnacle of Best Brains' comic writing.
First, I must admit that I didn't have Comedy Central until the ascendancy of South Park forced my cable provider to add it. We did, however, have the SciFi channel, for whatever reason. So I had to wait until the SciFi channel picked up MST3K before I could watch the show. So my association with MST3K consists primarily of these three years, though I have watched a number of the CC-era episodes now.
There are really two different periods. Joel and Mike offered two kinds of humor. Joel--sleepy-eyed, laid-back Joel--was capable of the most intellectual, wise commentary, but it was generally reserved for the host segments. The skewering of the films was relatively friendly--even when the film was as punishing as ""Manos: the Hands of Fate."" Joel was the class clown who made fun of the teacher's presentation, but in a way that let the teacher know he didn't really mean any harm. The pop culture references in the Joel era tended to be somewhat dated and very geared toward a baby-boomer audience.
But the ""Mike"" era changed that. Slowly, by degrees, the commentary began to sharpen to a razor edge. The references became more contemporary. The sarcasm was amped up, and this was probably what turned a lot of former MSTies off. The films were no longer joshed; they were skewered. Where Joel and the 'bots would often spend much of their time pretending to be characters making stupid or goofy remarks--essentially, allowing themselves to be drawn into the film, crappy as it was--Mike and the 'bots tended to comment more broadly on the action, the plot, the actors and the production values. This type of humor was much more appealing to me.
My point of all this is that the whole Joel/Mike debates are not only divisive but pointless. The two hosts--and the eras they hosted--offer two arguably different senses of humor, and many people will prefer one or the other. But I think it's unfair to demand that Rhino produce DVDs from one era over another. I've been waiting for some SciFi-era DVDs for a long time, and these represent a tiny fraction of the DVDs published to date.
Now, as for the episodes themselves--I must admit, ""Hamlet"" and ""The Girl With the Golden Boots"" are not two I would have chosen for the DVD. That said, both are amusing.
But the real meat of this set are ""Overdrawn at the Memory Bank"" and ""Space Mutiny."" The former is a movie, made for public television, that inexplicably stars Raul Julia. It is very, very bad, and yet, watching it, one can't help but notice that it has a lot in common with ""The Matrix."" Both films deal with a world where computers control everything and a single programmer who must fight back; and both films are bad. (Ooh, that's going to cost me some ""helpfuls"").
But ""Space Mutiny""...ah, Space Mutiny. So perfect. So unbelievably amusing. It's one of those films that must have written itself in the MST3K office. My favorite line: when the villain attempts to escape in what appears to be a cherried-out golf cart, and the heroes quickly board another one to give chase, Mike notes, ""You could walk on your hands and catch up to the guy!""
Personally I hope for more SciFi era releases...""Riding With Death,"" would be wonderful, as would ""It Lives by Night"" and the two Japanese superhero films, ""Invasion of the Neptune Men"" and ""Prince of Space.""",1068076800,280,3759,4.705614567526555
1942857,5,B0000TAYWA,"I am excited to see releases from the Sci-Fi era. Some of my favorite episodes of the series are from the Sci-Fi period. Pearl, while not the same as Dr. F and Frank, has some great moments.  The only change I would have wanted to see for this release would have been the release of ""Jack Frost"" or ""Soul Taker"" as the forth episode instead of ""Hamlet.""",1067817600,3,353,4.268656716417911
1942858,5,B0000TAYWA,"Although I would watch the show sporadically during the Comedy Central years, I just didn't enjoy the show with Joel as much as I did with Mike.  Not that Joel (being co-creator of one of the best shows in history) didn't do a great job, he did, but I felt that Mike was more energetic and funnier in the lead.
I really got into the show during the Sci-Fi years (Season 8-10) and didn't miss a show, taping them onto VHS (which I still watch from time to time) and I do have all the Rhino VHS & a few DVD versions available (nod to Joel on Manos, Pod People & Mitchell), and I am very excited to finally see some of the Sci-Fi Ep's come to home video!  The episodes run from excellent (Overdrawn At The Memory Bank, Space Mutanty) to good (Girl In Gold Boots) to so-so (Hamlet).  But beggers can't be choosers, so I'll take what they give.
The work by Mike, Kevin & Mary-Jo are fantastic as always, but I really enjoyed Bill Corbett as Crow, and he had some big shoes to fill for Trace, but he came through with flying colors!  He always had some of the funniest lines and he delivered them like a seasoned pro.  I feel that the shows during the Mike era were more consistantly funny and stronger, especially during the Sci-Fi years. (Shame on Sci-Fi for letting this brillant show go!)
A personal wish list of future episodes to consider would include, in no particular order:  Jack Frost, Riding With Death, Agent For H.A.R.M., Prince Of Space, Devil Doll, Time Chasers, Puma Man, Werewolf, The Deadly Bees, Hobgoblins, The Final Sacrifice, Quest Of The Delta Knights, Soultaker, Merlin's Shop Of Mystical Wonders, Future War, Boggy Creek II, Track Of The Moon Beast and Final Justice.
Anyway, if Rhino wants to put out more Mike & his Sci-Fi (or Comedy Central) years, I'll buy 'em!",1067817600,18,1785,4.476923076923077
1942859,5,B0000TAYWA,"It's great they're releasing the Sci-Fi eps,but I hope they'll continue to release the Comedy Central eps as well...I love these eps on this box set,though Hamlet is probably the weakest one of the bunch,but I'm not not saying it's bad either!! There are some good quips in it...I love the packaging,too! Rhino if you're reading this,please,please,please release the Comedy Central eps,like the more obscure eps.....How about some extras like interviews of the cast and such?? Maybe some trivia about the movie and things like that?Just a thought. Other than that,looks great!! Keep up the superb job!!!!!",1067817600,10,605,5.247422680412371
1942860,5,B0000TAYWA,"It's great to see more later season MST3K appearing on DVD.  I have them taped off the TV but it's just not the same.  I also am happy to see they're releasing totally new episodes, as opposed to releasing DVD's of those shows they already put on tape.
The episodes themselves are mixed.  ""Space Mutiny"" is hilarious!  Why did anyone let them use the Battlestar Galactia shots?  Probably one of the gang's funniest rips though.  ""Girl in Gold Boots"" (while not sci-fi) is equally funny.  My favorite sign is Tom Servo's comment at the beginning that ""shouldn't we be in individual booths to watch this movie?""  Beautiful.  I've only seen the Hamlet episode once and wasn't too impressed and ""Overdrawn at the Memory Bank"" is some mess Raul Julia made that seems like a low budget conglomeration of Casablanca with Tron.
Still, this is wonderful and the first two episodes alone are worth it for me.",1067212800,3,898,4.705128205128205
1942861,5,B0000TAYWA,"This collection includes 4 episodes from the Sci-fi seasons of MST. The four episodes are Space mutiny a barely watchable sci-fi flick. Overdrawn at the Memory bank, a horrendous mess of a movie that takes place in an Orwellian future, with Raul Julia making the movie barely tolerable in the rebel lead charactar. This move hates anteaters for some reason, watch the film and you'll understand. It also rips off Casablanca, features a baboon named Daisy, and a perverted little kid.  Anyways, the plaot of this movie nearas I can tell is that Raul Julia gets in trouble for downloading movies, and is sent on a mandatory ""dopple"" somehow, while in the main frame computer where you go when you're doppled, Raul screws up the computer and somehow writes his own programs, ending up in casblanca his favorite movie. It's all very, very confusing. You wish you could just watch Raul watch Casablanca, it would be a much better film. This was made by a New York PBS station, who should have used their money more wisely. Hamlet- A dreary, boring, and B&W German version of Shakespeare's play. The silloquy of this movie is barely watchable, as it is so boring, in fact the whole movie is slow and boring.  Finally, Girl in Gold Boots- a drama about a dancer named Michelle and a thug named Buzz and a musician/arty guy named Critter who is going to become a draft dodger. The plot revolves around a nightclub in Los Angeles where Michelle along with Buzz's sister Joan or Jane, I forget frankly ""dance"" and I use the term loosely, Critter is a janitor and Buzz sells drugs, eventually Buzz and the owners of the club are brought to justice, Michelle and Critter marry and Critter joins the army. Buzz's sister OD's not fatally, and we don't know what happens to her. I hope Rhino puts out more comedy Central episodes as there are many I wnt to own. This is a good collection for now though, and i cannot wait to get it.",1067212800,2,1917,4.58600583090379
1942862,5,B0000TAYWA,"How could any self-respecting MST3K fan complain about these great RHINO collections.  Here we are getting 4 complete episodes of one of the most unique TV Series in history.  I must say that with Rhino VHS I've been disappointed twice with the quality of the tapes.  Most seemed to have minor defects.  However, with the DVD releases (I have all but about 2) the quality is very good.  Indeed, Rhino's best release must be the MANOS/Poopie Reel DVD.  Perhaps MST3K's most beloved episode with a blooper reel that'll make non-fans FANS!
The episodes here are a mixed bag IMO.  I love SPACE MUNTINY and would buy this collection for it alone.  Did they just lease Battlestar Galactica's special effects?  How stupid can you get?  This flick makes ICE PIRATES look like 2001: A Space Odyssey.  (Although I quite like ICE PIRATES and would love it on DVD...but you know what I mean)  At the other end we have HAMLET.  This episode bores me to sleep.  I'll try it again when this arrives.  Not MST3K's worst but not a personal favorite of mine either.  A close second to SPACE MUTINY is OVERDRAWN AT THE MEMORY BANK.  It's been a while since I've sat down and watched it.  Oddly, the movie is actually okay.  Raul Julia makes it tolerable.  Mike & The Bots make it a blast for 90 minutes!  Finally, GIRL IN GOLD BOOTS which barely passes Sci-Fi Channel's requirements for a Sci-Fi/Horror film (there's a haunted house ride in it and a funny scene with missing film frames so an actor just sort of pops back in to the conversation :) ).  I'm glad they took the chance.  It brings back memories of the Comedy Central years.  I miss films like TEENAGE STRANGLER, DADDY-O and all those great shorts like MR. B NATURAL and the one about train crossings (""Oh, why don't they look?"").
The only down side I can see is that I already have great copies of these on VHS (3 or more of each, actually...fanboy).  But there are so many of the pre Sci-Fi Channel episodes that I badly want on DVD.  Still...this shows that Rhino is dedicated to bringing MST3K FANS what we want.  MST3K DVDs!!!  For that we are all grateful.",1067126400,5,2105,4.526595744680851
1942863,5,B0000TAYWA,this is another great set of mystery science theater shows it has 4 episodes from the scifi era.  on that note you soon will not be able to see sci fi episodes because they are canceling the show this january.  this collection looks to be better than the first three because it has alternate host segments with mike.  I cannot wait until nov 18 to get this and I hope Rhino puts out more. update its not alternate host scenes but new intros with mike.  there pretty short but its better than nothing. still a great set.,1066608000,,519,4.319587628865979

1942896,5,B0000TAYWA,"This set is a great introduction to the Sci-Fi era of MST3K.  'Girl in Gold Boots' is kind of lame, but Mike and the Bots make the most of it.  'Hamlet' is my personal favorite, and goes to show that the Best Brains crew can make great riffs, even if the movie isn't so bad (Don't get me wrong - this is an AWFUL version of Hamlet, dubbed from German and very dark all the way through.  Except that it's still Hamlet, and that makes it good.  ""Overdrawn at the Memory Bank"" is suspiciously great, considering it was obviously done on a very small budget for public television.
Now 'Space Mutiny' - this is the one that everyone seems to think is the greatest of the set.  Kind of a cheap Battlestar Galactica rip off (in fact, it apparently lifted some stock footage directly from the original show.  Can they do that?)  It features one of the best sequences in the whole run of the show, where Mike and the robots give new names to the big dumb weightlifter type main character.  ""Slab Bulkhead, Fridge Largemeat, Punt Speedchunk, Butch Deadlift, Bold Bigflank, Splint Chesthair, Flint Ironstag, Bolt VanderHuge, Thick McRunFast, Blast Hardcheese"" and so on.

1942897,5,B0000TAYWA,"MST3K: Volume 4 / B0000TAYWA

With two great films and two fairly good ones, this volume is a great addition to any MST3K collection, and is also a wonderful introduction to the franchise - two of the films riffed here are my ""go to"" films for MST3K newbies.

- Girl in Gold Boots: This is a perfect movie for the MST3K team to riff, because it combines a simple, cohesive plot (Girl finds herself out of her league in Sin City) with terrible production values. This makes it a wonderful introduction to MST3K-style riffing, because the viewer isn't burdened by trying to figure out what is going on, and can just relax and enjoy the zingers. The zingers themselves are beauts - with characters that pop 'magically' in and out of scenes, a soundtrack that insists it's Christmas whilst the set crew adamantly maintained a Halloween theme, and a hero who calls himself ""Critter"", Mike and the Bots have plenty of material to work with. This is definitely one of my favorites.

- Hamlet: The setup here is cute - Mike wins a bet against Pearl and gets to decide his movie for the week (""Hamlet"", a classic!), but she has the last laugh by picking which *version* of ""Hamlet"" to show, and she picks a frighteningly terrible one...in theory. In practice, this is basically a good example of how boring Shakespeare can truly be in the hands of a crummy acting troupe, and most of the riffs here have less to do with the lackluster performance (about which one can only say so much) and more to do with the vagaries of Elizabethan language - so, basically, Mike and the Bots are riffing the script of ""Hamlet"" but against a really crummy production because the good stuff couldn't be licensed. Interesting, but not really one of their best.

- Overdrawn at the Memory Bank: With Raul Julia (of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Addams-Family-Addams-Family-Values/dp/B000FIHN52/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Addams Family / Addams Family Values</a>&nbsp;fame) as a lead, and with a plot that seems to be a panache of Philip K. Dick science fiction stories, you'd think that this film would have real potential, either as a stand-alone movie or as a good riffing. Unfortunately, the presentation and plot are so disjointed and confusing, that most viewers will probably struggle through once or twice before being able to really enjoy the riffing. This is a good MST3K episode but not, in my opinion, one of the best.

- Space Mutiny: Ah, this movie can carry the collection by itself - I've never seen anyone *not* enjoy ""Space Mutiny"" in the hands of Mike and the Bots. With shots ripped blatantly from ""Battlestar Galactica"", a cult of priestesses whose worship antics largely revolve around a Spencer's Gifts electricity ball novelty toy, a hero of many names (Meaty McJockstrap! Puffy Hugeshoulders! Play along and see what names you can come up with!), and dozens of well-placed railing deaths, you'll want to watch this film over and over again. A classic in every sense of the word.

1942898,5,B0000TAYWA,"This was my first MST3K box set a long time ago, and it is still the best in my opinion. They chose great movies for this set, and my favorite is Girl in Gold Boots. That movie is so completely horrid, and yet perfect to mock! The guys dissect this tragedy of a film in style. The scenes are choppy, the dancing is painful to watch, and it all brews so well in a MST3K show. And you'll die when you see Crow dancing in gold boots! Memory bank was good - it is is my husband's favorite. Space Mutiny is really good too - it's so ridiculous!. The ""car chase"" is so laughably lame, but what did I expect from a movie like this? Hamlet wasn't bad, but a little slow. We only watched that one once I think. This is a must-have for any MST3K collection. Gold Boots and Space Mutiny are hilarious and worth every penny!",1269388800,,812,4.113207547169812
1942899,4,B0000TAYWA,"Two of the movies are pure gold...""Overdrawn at the Memory Bank"" and ""Space Mutiny."" ""Hamlet"" is a bit boring and tedious, but worth a watch. The first two movies are beyond funny and can be watched over and over.",1247529600,,213,4.487179487179487
1942900,4,B0000TAYWA,"-- another review at this late date.  Like the other sets, some of these are more desirable to own than others.  I tend to better enjoy episodes where the underlying movie is silly or campy-bad (Santa Claus / Squirm / Final Sacrifice), but not unwatchable like 'Manos.'

Having said that, Space Mutiny is one of my all-time favorites.  I hadn't seen all the others, but bought the box set just for that one.  A truly cheezy movie that was made for no better reason than to swindle the movie-going public out of its hard-earned dollars, gets the kicking it so richly deserves.  Classic line: at a meeting of the rebels, a dissenter is knocked down and murdered.  Crow says, 'It's a rare meeting where something actually gets done!'

Overdrawn at the Memory Bank: Early Raoul Julia in cheap made-for-public-TV tripe, shot on videotape.  Not a top-10 episode, but maybe top-25.  Girl in the Gold Boots: A solid, but also not-top-10 episode, on a par with Secret Agent Super Dragon, or Touch of Satan (secondary inclusions in other box-sets).  Hamlet:  The awful underlying black-&-white (mostly black) movie ruined this one for me.  Looks like it was shot in an abandoned bunker.  Not many memorable lines.

But don't let words like 'secondary' fool you - mst3k was better than most stuff of TV, then and now.  They can't all be gold. I wish they'd box up the most-requested episodes a few at a time, and the less-requested episodes 8 or 10 at a time.  Nobody listens.",1221264000,,1465,4.7047244094488185

I've just never felt the need to watch anything else. Space Mutiny is by far one of the best MST3Ks ever made. The movie is beyond horrible which makes for excellent humor. The names that Mike and the bots call the so-called ""hero"" makes it worthwhile all by itself. I have never once regretted having this set. Someday I'll watch the rest but for now Space Mutiny and Overdrawn are good enough for me. I could sit and watch them all day.

1942917,5,B0000TAYWA,"When MST3K came to the Sci-Fi Channel in 1997, it was understood that the movies up for MST'ing would be bad science fiction/horror movies (and let's face is, there are billions of them; at least a thousand are being made as I write this, I am sure).  And the first two Sci-Fi seasons consisted mostly of science fiction and horror movies.  But in its last season, all that changed.

Witness ""Girl in Gold Boots.""  It's horrible, to be sure, but not a horror movie, unless you count the fact that the titular girl dances in a go-go joint called ""The Haunted House.""  And if you are looking for a reason to buy this collection, this is the stand-out episode.  Fanboys laud ""Space Mutiny"" as the best thing Mike, Servo and Crow ever did in the history of the show, and although I agree it is a fine episode, it is not my favorite.  And I am not entirely comfortable with Mike and the bots riffing on Shakespeare, even if it is a stagy German film of ""Hamlet"".  And God knows ""Overdrawn At the Memory Bank"" has its legions of fans and to this day I sometimes sing, ""Come as you are to my mall, to my a-a-trium.""  But ""Girl in Gold Boots"" - consider it ""Manos! The Musical!""

There is just so much to love about ""Girl in Gold Boots.""  The movie itself - a kind of badly lit, badly written, badly directed, badly acted version of ""Rebel Without a Cause,"" if James Dean's character had been a homicidal maniac and Sal sang bad folk songs and Natalie worked at a greasy spoon.  What the movie wants to say, at least from the hilarious trailer included in the DVD, is that young people in the 60s faced many temptations - drugs, committing petty crime, dancing, oily club owners, girls not only in gold boots, but also in silver boots.  But if they held tight to their beliefs, listened to their hearts and played their guitars in the rain, they could find the right path.

The riffing in ""Girl in Gold Boots"" is impeccable.  My hat is eternally off to Tom Servo for his ""Charles Manson is walking the streets/The Zodiac Killer's at large/Charles Bukowski is puking out the window/and Santa Claus is on his way!"" during the epic drive into L.A.  And how lovely of Crow to note Buz's teleportation into a scene in a bar with a snappy ""I'm back!""  and calling the trio ""natural born cheapskates"" as they decide how to divide up the bill.  And Mike - Oh, Mike - he just had to ruin Buz's moment in the sun, marveling over his front-page worthy gas station heist in which he stole $40 and left the attendant slightly injured.

Now, as for the debate of whether the Sci-Fi era was worse than the Comedy Central one, to me, is irrelevant. I enjoy the show just for itself, for the pop culture references and just the sly side comments (a trait that I myself now do at movies, and my wife hates).

This set contains two of my most favorite episodes ever: ""Overdrawn at the Memory Bank"" and ""Space Mutiny"". I am not sure why these episodes get me so, but oh lord do they.

1942934,4,B0000TAYWA,"What do insanely funny people in Minnesota do in there spare time?  Mystery Science Theater is one of the results, and here are four very entertainingly awful ""experiments:""

Girl in Gold Boots: This one has everything - bad lighting, bad acting, really bad editing, and a purplexing storyline: wannabe dancer Michele leaves her abusive dad at ""Eat"" (the restaurant they run) and hops a ride with Buz, the greasy dope-dealer who says he'll get her a job in a ""groovy Hollywood nightclub."" Along the way, they pick up Critter, a folksy gentleman who bears a strange resemblence to Paul Rudd.  This movie features bad 60's music, terrible dancing, and some of the ugliest men you'll find in L.A.

Hamlet: I feel a duty to advise you to stay away from this if you find Shakespeare boring.  But it's easier to understand Mike and the 'bot's zingers about this dubbed German version of the greatest drama of all time.  Funniest of all is Hamlet's famous ""To be or not to be"" speech.  If you can get through this, kudos to you.

Overdrawn at the Memory Bank: I know I still love Raul Julia (Gomez of the Addams Family), but I hate his decision to star in this made-for-PBS-film about a man rebelling against his futuristic workplace.  While trapped in a computer.  Watch this one a couple of times and it'll become one of your favorites.  Enjoy the guys' jokes about Julia's obsession with Casablanca (yes, the classic movie) as it plays out inside the computer.

Space Mutiny: This is a must-see for diehard MST3K fans.  A soggy Star Wars rip-off, this is a great example to aspiring filmmakers what NOT to do.  Some of MST3K's best jokes are here, including an ongoing rambling list to rename the movie's muscular ""hero"" (i.e., ""Butch Deadlift,"" ""Punch Rockgroin"").  The funniest (unintentional) character?  Kalgon, the head mutiner, with greased-back hair and a widow's peak drawn on his forehead.

1942935,4,B0000TAYWA,"This box set is the ultimate question mark. How can a show that is so funny in the midst of it's prime bomb out so badly in one episode?

Space Mutiny - is by far the funniest episode I have seen! Beef Hardslab (or whatever his name is), Grand-ma daughter, Commander Santa Claus and Kalgan are enough to make this episode funny without Mike & the Bots ripping it a new one. It's basically a cheesy 80's sci-fi movie - one of those movies if the world would stop in the 80's and the future grew out from that point - this is what it would be like. The chases in the golf carts/floor buffers are hilarious, the acting is down right awful, the main character is so easy to make fun of... This is MST gold - no wait PLATINUM! This episode is worth getting this box set!

Overdrawn at the Memory Bank - this movie made me squirm in my seat the first time around - squirming because I wanted it to end so badly - but I was laughing while I was squirming! This is another movie that seemed like it'd be funny without M&tB's but you throw in the MST crew you have something that'll make you laugh so hard you'll cry. Raul Julia plays a guy bored at his job - and he ""scrolls up cinema's"" or basically downloads movies to his work station. He get's caught and sent out on a mandatory vacation where his brain is inserted into a baboon. THEN if that wasn't wacky enough they lose his body and he becomes one with the computer and he does this entire Casablanca reality for himself. Note to movie makers - don't put a good movie into your bad movie to try to make your bad movie seem good - it doesn't work! This one too is worth the price of the box set!

Girl in Gold Boots - This movie is a dumb 60's - I want to be a famous dancer so I'll get with this creepy guy who I met at a diner and he'll show me the way - type of movie. First off, the girl can't dance to save her life - Elaine from Seinfeld looked just as good as she does. Then you have the creepy guy she meets at the diner - who looks like Regis Philbin - and he's not as creepy per-se more like an icky-elf. Then their is the true love interest a guy named Critter - oh yeah ladies line up - and take a number for a ride on the Critter! He's your typical rebel with a heart of gold type of guys... Mike and the Bots rip this movie to shreds - and again this one makes this box set very appealing!

Then we get to Hamlet... What can I say... I haven't actually watched this entire episode because I was afraid I'd fall asleep. It's too talky for Mike & the Bots to get in good one-liners. And it's pretty much word for word (TV version of course) Hamlet. No, dumb lines to make fun of. No, extremely stupid car chases in golf carts. No, vacations inside of a baboon's body. No, icky-elves. Nothing. I'll probably put it on one day when I'm cleaning and try and over hear parts - but it's the worst MST out there (which is incredibly rare finding a bad MST).

So, all in all - I'd give this box 5 out of 5 if it wasn't for Hamlet - but each of the other episodes tries their hardest to make up for Hamlet. I really want to say 5 out of 5 - but you can't ignore it... it is part of this package... Such a shame.",1128211200,10,3164,3.9842271293375395

Now all we need are Prince of Space, Jack Frost and The Thing that Couldn't Die and our lives will be complete...

1942937,4,B0000TAYWA,"This is the second boxset of MST3K I have purchased so far. The first being box set #1. This boxset features nothing but SciFi era, Mike-hosted episodes. The humor in these episodes is very nice, but I enjoy the very early mike days the best. The comedy central years with mike are absolutely gut busting. Here are the major differences:

1) back then Trace Beaulieu did crow's voice, and Trace really had a knack for delivering some gut-busting lines. Without him, the show has a much different feel.

2) These sci-fi episodes have a lot of dialogue in the movies they watch. The Trace years were mostly 1950's B&W movies with very little dialogue, so they could make fun of the movie much easier.

With that said, here are my takes on these episodes.

1) Girl In Gold Boots: My ex-girlfriend used to rant and rave about this episode, so I thought it would be great. The boys do a decent job of cutting it up, but some of it falls flat. Their jokes about Charlie Manson being on the loose in LA are very funny. The host segments are pretty descent, and the segments with the Pearl and her goons are unusually par for the course. This is a decent episode, but a little of it can be tedious.

2) Hamlet: Wow, this is God-Awful! I couldn't stand to watch this through. This is truley a stinker of an episode. I'll give this another go in the future, but this is really bad!

3) Overdrawn at the Memory Bank: Superb! This is truley a great episode! The way they rip on the fat man in this movie is SOOOO funny! The scene where Raul Julia is talking to the fat man by the pool is absolutely hysterical. One of the greatest lines in MST3K history occurs in this episode: This is how much pure cocaine you would need to enjoy this movie!

4) Space Mutiny: This one kinda grew on me. At first it was kind of boring, but now I find it very enjoyable. They seriously shred this stinker apart! Very ammusing stuff!

This is a pretty decent set, but I think I'll just stick to the Trace and Mike years.",1122595200,3,1991,4.319034852546917
1942938,4,B0000TAYWA,"Space Mutiny.  Space Mutiny.  Space Mutiny.

Do the other movies on this dvd even really matter?  Once you've seen Cameron Mitchell in a Santa Claus beard getting a lap dance by an 80s reject who worships toys from Spencer's Gifts, you've kind of reached the pinnacle of badness.  I've probably watched this movie, with the help of Mike & the Bots, more than some of the best REAL movies in my dvd collection.  Why?  Because it's the next best thing to watching a trainwreck in action.

It's hard to believe that Space Mutiny was actually supposed to be a serious movie (and even more unbelievable they felt it necessary to leave a window open for a SEQUEL).  Did anyone during the production of this movie look at the golf cart and say, ""You're kidding, right?""  Did the editor(s) of this film intentionally bring a dead commander back to life as some sort of payback for having to edit this mess to begin with??  Will spaceships in the future really be constructed from bricks and mortar?  There's SO MUCH wrong with this movie that it could possibly be entertaining without the bots.  You can't say this about most MST3K films.  With the bots, you're taken over a comedy edge that will leave you laughing and crying for years.

As for Girl in Gold Boots, Overdrawn..., and (ugh) Hamlet, let's consider them the appetizers.  There's always one appetizer you won't like, and in this case Hamlet will most likely be it.  I guess they were afraid that if they packaged something funnier with this set, like maybe The Final Sacrifice (""Rowsdower?""), it might accidentally kill some of the weak-hearted among us.  Personally, I'd have taken the risk.

1942939,5,B0000TAYWA,"What can top Raoul Julia in ""Overdrawn at the Memory Bank"" (yes, Public Television at its finest) asking the eternal question: ""Ma, 'my nuts?""  At least there are bits of Casablanca thrown in here and there, and everyone gets to pretend they're in a much better film.

Space Mutiny is also a riot - if you believe that space takes place entirely inside a warehouse, with speed demons riding souped up golfcarts.  Plus, this film features one of the few meetings where anything was actually accomplished.

Girl in the Gold Boots is also quite funny, with a star who stands out because he just doesn't care much about anything, and he's the one with the most redeeming qualities.

I disagree with the other reviewers who panned Hamlet.  First, even if Mike and the bots aren't as funny here as they are in other episodes, my understanding is that the underlying story is considered pretty good.  And heck, when else are you going to get the chance to laugh all the way through Hamlet starring Maximilian Schell?

Alright, that was lame, i'm sorry.  It's MST3K time again, kiddies,  and these are all from the sci-fi channel years.  What that means, of course for those of you who don't know, is that Dr. Forrester has been replaced by his mother, Pearl, and Crow T. Robot has a different voice and personality(I.E.: angrier) .  And the episodes are:

GIRL IN GOLD BOOTS

A waitress in a diner, named "" Eat "" no less, is whisked away to L.A. by a drifter with a speach impediment in the hopes of making her dreams of becoming a go-go dancer come true.  Along the way, of course, they pick up a slghtly less greasy drifter, engage in petty crime and share dune buggy rides.
FAV. LINE: "" Whatever, white people. ""
FAV. HOST LINE: "" But, Crow is shaking all of his various things! ""

HAMLET

Mike scams pearl into letting them watch "" Hamlet "" , the greatest drama ever made.  Too bad for them this version of hamlet is a black and white, dreary, dubbed, made for german t.v. and very, very bad.
FAV. LINE: ""Now is the winter of our...damn, wrong play.""
FAV. HOST LINE:  TOM: "" Actually, the ""H"" is at the beginning, so it's pronounced "" huh-tom "" .
  CROW: "" Well, ' huh-Tom ' , why don't you 'huh-  lick me '! ""

OVERDRAWN AT THE MEMORY BANK

The late Raul Julia stars in this made for PBS production about a guy who gets suspended and put on mental holiday for watching CASABLANCA at work.  His mind and his body get seperated and the race is on to reunite them as he attempt to bring down the system from within his own mind.  I guess that's possible.
FAV. LINE: (at the nirvana center) "" Come, as you are, to my mall, to my atrium yeah yeah.""
FAV. HOST LINE: ""You don't wanna end up in the bone orchard.""

SPACE MUTANY

In the low-budget, 1980's future, in space.  The maniacal villan running the engine room decides to take over a starship and return to earth.  It's up to Captain Santa Claus, a beefed up hero who screams like a woman, his girlfriend who looks old enough to be his mother and some overly skinny, new-age dancing alien chicks to save the day.  Complete with over-acting, under-acting, rail kills and harrowing chases on floor cleaning machines.
FAV. LINE: ""They woke up the Oak Ridge Boys!""
FAV. HOST LINE: ""They have 20 pages on Gwen Stefani alone.""

All the episodes include introductions by Mike.  My favorites on this set are Space Mutany and Overdrawn...,.  It's hard to not like any episodes of MST3K, but HAMLET is so bad that even the usual wisecracks from Mike and the bots make this one hard to watch.  That's why I give this set only 4 stars.  If I were to subtitute another sci-fi era episode, it would be SOULTAKER, one of the funniest sci-fi shows and also brings back Joel, as well as T.V.'s Frank.

1942953,5,B0000TAYWA,"Rhino has seen fit to release more MST3K movies from the Sci-Fi era which, considering that the Sci-Fi Channel has stopped broadcasting reruns, couldn't have come at a better time.

""Girl In Gold Boots"" is a swinging, sixties musical mystery tour.  Michele is a waitress in a roadside diner who wants to become a professional dancer. One day, Buz walks in and tells her that his sister is a famous dancer. If she'll provide him with companionship, he'll drive her to L.A. and help her break into show business. Before they can leave they also meet Critter, a charming drifter. Long story short, all three end up at the Haunted House, the nightclub in L.A. where Buz's sister Joan is the head dancer. If you look up the word sleazy in the dictionary, you'll find a picture of the nightclub owner. He's also a big time drug pusher, who soon has Buz dealing for him. He's already got Joan hooked on drugs.  Joan is washed up and the nightclub owner wants the younger Michele to take her place. Critter winds up stuck as a janitor and stuck on Michele. He refuses to get involved with any illegal activities, except for the fact that he's a draft dodger! This Elvis wannabe is content to sing sappy love songs and stay on the sidelines.  A host highlight has Crow T. Robot doing a go-go dance while wearing gold boots!

""Hamlet"" stars Maximillian Schell in the title role, and was produced for German television in 1960.  Max really puts the ham in Hamlet.  This is the biggest bomb the Germans dropped on England since World War II.  The voices of the actors are dubbed in English with German accents.  Stranger still, the voice of King Claudius sounds like it was done by Ricardo Montalban!  At one point in the film, Crow makes a remark about fine Corinthian leather.  There is also a strange background sound heard throughout the movie.  No doubt, it was the sound of William Shakespeare spinning in his grave!

""Overdrawn At The Memory Bank"" was so awful that Raul Julia watched his performance in it and died of shame.  (Sorry, Raul, R.I.P.)  No expense was spared in paying Raul to star in this made-for-PBS movie which, unfortunately, left little money for special effects.  Raul plays Aram Fingal, a computer programmer who works for Novicorp, a giant corporation that exists somewhere in the future. When caught watching ""Casablanca"" at his desk, he is required to undergo rehabilitation therapy.  His mind is transferred into the body of a baboon, in order to give him a new outlook on life!  While monkeying around, his real body is misplaced and his mind is transferred into a computer.  With the help of Appolonia James, a medical technician, Fingal manages to reprogram himself into a simulation of his favorite movie.  This film takes ""Casablanca,"" ""1984"" and ""Planet Of The Apes,"" puts them in a blender, and hits the fast button!

""Space Mutiny"" nearly causes one aboard the Satellite Of Love!  All is not well aboard the Southern Sun spaceship. The old space captain, played by Cameron Mitchell, looks like a cross between an aging hippie and Santa Claus. He is content to explore the galaxy forever. John Phillip Law plays Kalgan, the mutineer who wants to take over the ship and divert it to a habitable planet. His acting is so far over the top that, when he laughs menacingly, you expect him to twirl a nonexistent, handlebar mustache. The captain's daughter is a brainless bimbo, while the pilot picked to succeed the aging captain is a giant slab of muscles with no acting talent whatsoever.  There's lots of shooting with space guns, followed by a succession of space-suited stuntmen falling over handrails. The big chase scene involves the use of modified golf carts.  My favorite scene takes place in the spaceship's bar, where the space travelers wear disco outfits and the women use hula hoops when they dance!  While watching this in amazement, Crow asks, ""So, in the future, there is absolutely no shame?""",1086998400,12,3933,4.75699558173785

1942956,5,B0000TAYWA,"Three great and one horrible episode of MST with new introductions featuring Mike for each are the contents of this set. The episodes in question are 'Space Mutiny', 'Girl in the Gold Boots', 'Hamlet', and 'Overdrawn at the Memory Bank'. I am ecstatic with the package as a whole, although I personally wish that they had never done 'Hamlet', and though I have seen it twice now, I doubt seriously that I will watch it again. On a brighter note the other three episodes are absolutely delightful.
'Space Mutiny' features reused 'Battlestar Galactica' stock footage combined with interiors filmed in what appears to be a boiler room (but remember it's a futuristic spaceship!) The costumes, acting, and especially dialogue are hilarious and I never tire of seeing this episode. My favorite scene is the hula hoop dance in the nightclub which yields the following glorious chestnuts from the MST crew: ""So in the future there is absolutely no shame""; and, ""She's presenting like a mandrill!""
'Girl in the Gold Boots' is a cheesy gangster/musical/dance movie straight out of the 1960s. Words can't describe the plot and the inane turns taken (the dune buggy scene in particular comes to mind here), so you'll just have to watch it for yourself. The dancing is particularly delicious to watch, as are the wretched musical numbers, particularly the closing tune, which provokes Mike to say ""So here's a puzzler: which of these two is worse at their craft?"" as the two stars dance and sing respectively.
'Overdrawn at the Memory Bank' is the best argument I have ever seen against the NEA. This horrible made for PBS film starring the genuinely great Raul Julia concerns a misanthrope from the future stuck into the body of Daisy, a worn out old baboon (""I'm Daisy; I like rotten fruit, poetry, and flinging my filth."") Of course everything goes horribly awry and Julia as 'Aram Fingal' has to fight to get out of the computer in a bad 'Casablanca' rip off. People either love or hate this episode, and I can see both sides of the issue. I personally fall into the former camp, so I am delighted it is now on DVD! Despite the horrible made for PBS special effects, and wretched storyline, the level of writing for the MST guys us near the peak of 'Manos' here. The anteater jokes alone make the film worth watching.
'Hamlet' is a 1960 black and white German TV production badly dubbed into English, and truthfully is one of my all time least favorite episodes of MST. I find this episode to be virtually unwatchable.
I hope that another volume comes out shortly, as one can never get enough MST. All told this is one of the best investments for your entertainment dollar that you could possibly make!",1080950400,3,2694,4.746268656716418

1.) Overdrawn at The Memory Bank: If the late Raul Julia (may God rest his soul) was alive today, I'm sure he would be embaressed that this god awful piece crap existed. But its funny watching him on a show made for public access.

2.) Girl in Gold Boots: One person carries this entire movie and its not the waitress/dancer. It's Critter.

3.) Space Mutiny: I remember watching this on t.v. and laughing really hard. It was the first episode of MST3K that my boyfriend saw and he nearly died at this comment made by one of the robots, ""Look, Sting, Debbie Reynolds and God.""

Pretty funny episode with the Casablnca references and the anteater-bashings. 9/10",1078963200,8,1384,4.368217054263566

1942970,4,B0000TAYWA,"One can't help but feel sorry for accomplished, talented, (and now deceased) Raul Julia, in the PBS Stinker ""Overdrawn at the Memory Bank"".  However, the host segments and riffing by Mike and the Bots is top notch and will help ease the pain.  Using ""state of the art technology"" (in 1980), this movie is about a bleak, futuristic world where our ""hero"" Aram Fingal, (Raul Julia) fantasizes about an alternate reality Casablanca. The pseudo-science and bogus techie talk really makes this one a laugh - it really dates this movie!  Just lay off the anteaters, OK?
Girl in the Golden Boots - Naive country girl and drippy draft dodger get mixed up in the strip club underworld. Hilarity ensues.
Space Mutiny - Cheesy Canadian Sci-Fi ""action"" film.  Look out for the stock footage from Battlestar Galactica!  Continuity errors abound!  Best running joke: anything with the Ballerians!
Hamlet - Well, if you ever have to do a report on Hamlet, watch this and at least get some laughs out of it.
Overall, another solid release from Rhino. Let's hope that they continue!",1078704000,,1065,4.856353591160221
1942971,4,B0000TAYWA,"This fourth collection of episodes from the classic TV comedy show, ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" (which, if you don't already know, is the program where a silhouette of a man and his two robots sitting in theater seat provide running comedic commentary to rotten movies), contains four episodes from the later seasons that appeared on the Sci-Fi Channel. That means Mike Nelson is the host, Billy Corbett is doing Crow's voice instead of Trace Beaulieu, and Pearl Forrester is now the evil scientist holding the crew of the Satellite of Love hostage.
The early DVD collections were all focused on the Comedy Central years of MST3K, so this is a nice shift in Rhino's marketing. Some fans aren't fond of the host segments in these later years, but there are some occasional funny ones. The riffing, however, is as good as ever, and has changed to an angry, sarcastic style different than the Joel and early Mike years. I love both styles, but some fans prefer one or the other. Just be aware that in this package you're getting a full-assault of the later, Sci-Fi Channel episodes. (Rhino is about release another package of Sci-Fi Channel episodes, after which I hope they'll return to some of the early seasons to maintain balance.)
Of the four episodes on this collection, two are superb, while the others are entertaining but more average. Here's what you'll find:
GIRL IN GOLD BOOTS: A really sleazy `go-go' film from the late 60s with some disturbing similarities to ""Showgirls"" (except it's better). Sleazy `elf boy' picks up a girl in a greasy spoon restaurant with the promise of making her a dancer in Los Angeles at the club where his drug-addled sister works. Unfortunately, Elf Boy is a bit psychotic, the boss at the club is oily and sleazy, and a poetic spouting dude named Critter (or ""Yak Boy"") tries to lure our girl from her plunge into a life of...(gasp!)...SIN! Oh, and there's lots of cameras leering at girls in skimpy go-go outfits dancing to lousy music. The film is similar to early MST3K episodes like ""Hellcats"" and ""Wild Rebels"" in its greasy ugliness, but the film is mostly slow and boring. Mike and the `Bots do a decent job with it, but this is only an average episode. There is a funny host segment where Mike sings a syrupy guitar ballad while the ship burns.
HAMLET. A 60s German TV production of the play, horribly dubbed into English, and starring Maximilian Schell. It's bleak, drab, slow, and shot entirely on a single very uninteresting set of black curtains and granite furniture. The amusement of this episode is watching Mike and the `Bots take on a classic of literature, and riff off of famous lines, some of which is hysterical. But the production is so ponderous and slow that you'll be screaming along with the hosts for Hamlet to just shut up and die at the end (""Is there a word in English language he hasn't said?"" one of them asks). There's a funny host segment called ""Alas Poor Who?"" set up as gameshow, where contestants must identify celebrities based on pieces of their bones. An intriguing, if not fantastic, episode.
SPACE MUTINY. Ah, here's the gravy! An awful South African-produced sci-fi stinker that rips off the plot of ""Battlestar Galactica"" - as well as all of its effects footage! (I'm not sure this was legally done.) The inhabitants of the giant space cruiser `The Southern Sun' - which is mostly a large basement and boiler room - face a mutiny by guys in marching band outfits. A chunky loser and his love interest (old enough to be his mother) must save the ship. There are loads of people flipping over railings as they get shot (railing kill!), mutineers who can't aim worthy a damn, a chase on vehicles that go slower than golf carts, and a hero who screeches like a woman at odd moments. Mike and the `Bots really let this film have it, and the result is one of the funniest episodes of the Sci-Fi Channel years.
OVERDRAWN AT THE MEMORY BANK. Just as great an episode as ""Space Mutiny"" is this horrendous Public Television-produced film. Acutally, it isn't a film: it was shot on VIDEO! Cheap and flat looking, and filled with cheesy video toaster effects, the film blows any chance of succeeding it might have had. And it had potential. It has a real star, Raul Julia, and an early cyberpunk and proto-`Matrix' idea of a man whose mind is lost inside a giant corporate computer in a dystopian future. But none of it makes the least bit of sense, and it reaches hysterical levels of incomprehensibility by the end. Mike and the `Bots are in top form, and there's plenty to laugh at here. The end sequence, where they call the tech-support line for the movie to complain, is a classic!
In addition to the films, Mike Nelson makes brief introductions to each episode, describing a bit of the behind-the-scenes torture the writers went going through. It's a nice feature, and I hope Rhino continues it.
Unlike some earlier Rhino discs, there are no ""un-cut, un-MST3K"" versions of the films available. Frankly, I never watched the un-cut films on the discs where is WAS available, and I don't think anyone would want to watch any of these film without Mike and the `Bots. They change awful entertainment into great entertainment - and that's a magic feat all on it's own, and why ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" will live forever as one of comedy greats.
Come on, JUST PUSH THE BUTTON, FRANK, and buy this collection!",1077753600,120,5391,4.6997885835095135
1942972,3,B0000TAYWA,"The best episodes are still unreleased. First Sci-Fi Channel grabs the show, then makes them ONLY do sci-fi films, then puts it on at horrible times. Some say the host segs aren't important, like heck! The host segs were put in as part of the package, but with Brain Guy, the departure of Trace, and the unexplained ape, host segs to me meant ""bathroom time."" Those of us over 30 prefer the baby-boomer humor and pop culture references, that's what critics loved about the show. Anyone can make snide comments at bad movies, and I remember Joel speaking about the pop culture references. He said he wasn't worrying about people getting it, and that the right people will get it!

1942973,5,B0000TAYWA,"MST3K has got to be one of, if not, the funniest shows ever created!!! This box set has some of their finest episodes.
Girl in Gold Boots - 5/5 Hilarious
In this 1969 drama that would make Nancy Sinatra and her walkin' boots proud, sexy Leslie McRae (DEATH RACE 2000) stars as Michele, an aspiring professional dancer. When she takes a chance and moves to L.A. with just a pair of gold boots to her name, she ended up entangled in fame's crime-filled underbelly.
However, Mike, Crow, and Tom Servo are here to save this piece of feces, and this one turns out to be one of the funniest episodes ever. Keep your eye out for the icky elf guy. I'd have to say the funniest part was the end were Tom starts singing ""You're living a lie, you dance like a clown, I hope that you die!!!""
Hamlet - 2/5
You know the story. However this movie doesn't have much to work with. It's pretty boring and the film appears to be shot in someone's garage. It's just not that good, so moving on.
Overdrawn at the Memory Bank - 5/5
A man refusing to submit to the mindless monotony of his world punches up endless re-runs of ""Casablanca"" on his video display terminal until, in a strange mechanical mix-up, his identity and Rick Blaine's become fused within Novacorp's computer bank. Now, what was just a flickering fiction on his screen, becomes a reality. Wow this one is hilarious!!! The big fat guy and teh constant rifing of this one makes this one of the funniest episodes ever! ""Oh I'm fartin monopoly cards!"" - Tom Servo
Space Mutiny - 5/5
A brave crewmember takes charge when a mutinous revolt threatens his spacecraft. He leads the rest of the crew in a battle against evil space pirates. This is possibly the best episode ever! The movie practically makes fun of itself. Keep an eye out for the beefy guy who screams like a woman, and the daughter he falls for whom is like 70!!! It's a bad movie, saved by the MST3K briliance!!!",1076544000,2,1918,4.436260623229462
1942974,5,B0000TAYWA,"I have been a big fan of MST3K for years. I am not really into the Mike/Joel debate, but suffice it to say that any episode I have seen has brought a lot of laughter, regardless of the host. I would rate these episodes, from very good to good as:
Space Mutiny, Girl in the Gold Boots, Hamlet, Overdrawn at the Memory Bank. Actually a true mstie fan can find some humor in any episode. I just wish that more episodes would be released on DVD, preferably some that were not previously released on VHS.  I have all of the Rhino VHS episodes and a few DVDs. To me this is just a very funny show that you can watch over and over and still find a funny line you missed. I would buy just about any of the episodes from either the Comedy central or SciFi eras.
What is really funny is that people actually watched these movies when they were released theatrically or on tv. And the MST3K riffs represent only a small percentage of the horrible movies released to the public.",1075161600,4,966,4.25
1942975,4,B0000TAYWA,"I think Boxed Set #4 is worth owning, but definitely the weakest of the four yet released (however, I haven't seen ""Space Mutiny"" and ""Overdrawn at the Memory Bank,"" which one reviewer said are the stronger of the four, so perhaps I will change my mind when I see them later this week).  The release of an all-Mike DVD collection naturally opens up the Joel vs. Mike controversy, which I think is very much overblown.  I see it as more of a thankfully long Trace Bealieu (sic?) era and the shorter post-Trace Bealieu era.  Trace, in addition to playing Dr. Clayton Forrester and providing the really excellent voice of Crow T. Robot, was also the most important writer the show had.  When he left, the quality of the writing went way down, and hence did the quality of the show.  I don't think Mike can be blamed for that; bringing back Joel wouldn't have helped in the post-Bealieu era.  His contribution to the show (evident in how far the quality of writing fell immediately upon his departure) has been sorely underestimated, in my humble opinion.  I feel like some sort of fanatical cultist to even HAVE such specific opinions on a t.v. show I started watching nearly 15 years ago, and which has been off the air for 5, but that's what MST3K does to a fellow....I wish Rhino Records would release ""Gamera vs. Guiron"" and ""Earth vs. the Spider.""  And ""The Magic Sword.""  'Its King Grady!'",1074643200,3,1392,4.603238866396761
1942976,4,B0000TAYWA,"I have been a huge fan of MST3K since the very beginning of the series. Watching the evolution of the series has been incredible and I truly believe that the originality / sharp witted commentary of the episodes place the series in a class by itself. However, I simply love the episodes with Joel as the host. I can appreciate Mike and his humor. However, I feel Joel appeals more to my generation and pop culture in general. Please Rhino !! Now that you have released two sets with ""Mike only"" episodes (by two I mean the 4th and the upcoming 5th set) PLEASE release a set with ""Joel only"" episodes. There are simply countless episodes from the Joel era that should be on DVD that the fans deserve them.",1074556800,4,704,4.423076923076923
1942977,3,B0000TAYWA,"Maybe it's because the Sci-Fi series ends in early 2004. Maybe it's because Sci-Fi released the rights for these four eps early. Maybe they're just having trouble securing those older Comedy Central eps. For whatever reason, Season 4 is comprised entirely of Sci-Fi channel episodes.
Many MSTies make the upfront caveat that Sci-Fi's framework never matched that of Comedy Central. The sitcom-style sketches often fell flat, and Pearl sometimes seemed bored and apathetic even being on the show. None of her minions could touch the charm of TV's Frank, though Kevin Murphy did an admirable job as Bobo. That being said, however, Crow's new voice was a subtle evolution, and the actual film riffing was still well-done much of the time. Since that's the meat of the show, that's also the criteria of this review.
1) Space Mutiny: Battlestar Galactica's stock footage must have been cheap, because this ep had it by the pantload. A bizarre cruise to the end of the universe (for sweet monkey-lovin', no less) is halted by the mutinous Kalgan. The hero Dave Ryder (aka. Pec Boulderdome, Crunch Buttsteak, etc.) must defeat Kalgan while simultaneously scoring with the captain's daughter. The ep starts out slow, but picks up about the time the hero appears, and ends up being one of the stronger Sci-Fi era episodes.
2) Girl in the Golden Boots: ""Girl Leaves Home to Become a Star"" is the basic premise of this film, with some greasy young men dueling for her affections along the way (and by ""young"" I mean ""fortysomething""). To be honest, all the characters in this film are ""seasoned"", though it doesn't help their acting. There's some okay riffing in this episode -- funny enough to manage some chuckles, but not enough to justify 1/4 of a $50 DVD in my opinion.
3) Overdrawn at the Memory Bank: Since it was a PBS production, I guess there was supposed to be some educational value, but the film I saw involved Raul Julia pretending to be a monkey for the first 15 minutes. Its premise is similar to The Matrix (a programmer mind-links to a computer mainframe to fight evil), but Julia's adventures come across more like a low-budget Holodeck than anything, notably in some Casablanca scenes. Some great riffing, on the same level with Space Mutiny and many Comedy Central classics. Raul Julia even seems a little embarrassed in the film, as though he knew it would be famously ridiculed someday.
4) Hamlet: This is the sort of film you enter with high hopes. Mike and the 'bots take on Shakespeare - what's not to like? Sadly, the answer is ""pretty much everything"". The crew makes an honest effort, but there's little to work with in this plodding German dub, and the whole episode fails miserably. (perhaps the worst MST3K episode...ever?) Why Rhino included it is a mystery. I'd call it a tragedy, but that would be redundant.
MST3K, Vol. 4 is like the whole Sci-Fi run in a nutshell. On the one hand, you feel like some bad choices were made, and some important elements were left missing. On the other hand, you know they remember the fans, and they're still trying. Ultimately, it could be (and has been) better, but it's still better than nothing.",1074556800,8,3157,4.783882783882784

1942979,5,B0000TAYWA,"I want to know why everyone seems so apathetic about the now infamous (in MST3K circles) version of Hamlet that was included in this box set.  It could be that I'm an English Lit. major who's actually read and studied Hamlet, but I thought that our boys on the SOL did a wonderful job in this episode.  Granted, they shot off about a few things that were related to other Shakespearian plays, but come on people; this isn't rocket science.  Most of what they referred to should be common knowledge to anyone who's graduated from high school.
I personally thought that it was incredibly brave of Mike and the 'bots to take on old Bill Shakespeare, even if they picked a production as bad as this version of one of his most popular plays.  I applaud the effort put forth and can't wait to add this episode (not to mention the others included in this volume) to my ever-growing collection.",1073260800,2,886,4.51875
1943000,5,B0000TAYWA,"The four movies in this collection are some of the best of the sci-fi seasons.
Space Mutiny: This horrendous, sci-fi movie features a group of space explorers on board the Southern Sun, a spaceship piloted by Santa, and featuring a concrete basement/warehouse, with heavy metal pipes brick wall. That's right the spaceship has brick walls and heavy metal pipes, consider that for a moment. The villian is the head of security who tries to take over the ship so that they can land somewhere. The ship is forbidden to do so under some vague treaty. I dunno the plan doesn't sound that evil. Our hero, big guy with the acting ability of a side of beef, (M&TB's nicknames for this alleged hero had me on the floor.) bails on a famous scientist killing him, than sets fire to a disabled bad guy. There are hazerdous safety railings, Ballarians(pointless female aliens), TWO golf cart chases, a killed crew member appearing in the VERY NEXT SCENE, and a special apperance by Sting. We also see recycled Battlestar Gallactica footage. Good episode. Favorite Line: ""Is it a good idea to set off random explosions in a space ship?"" (8.5/10)
Hamlet- This is a [bad] German version of hamlet which is so dreary, it makes the orginal play look like a screwball comedy. A brief plot summary; Hamlet's uncle and mother kill Hamlet's father and then Hamlet tries to let the uncle and mother know that Hamlet knows about the murder. It is like I said a dreary , dreary film. The episode is good though, especially the ""to be or not to be""  monolouge wherein the actor appeared to have studied at the Shatner school of acting, it features Danish clowns, stilted dialouge and a whole depressing b&w feel, (though hamlet was a tragedy) the skits are some of the best parts of this episode, my favorite is the last SOL skit. All in all I liked it a lot. MSTies take note you may have to watch it three or more times to appreciate this episode that's what i had to do anyway.  I think i's a very underrated episode. Favoite line:""Fraility thy name is Carl...""(7.5/10)
Overdrawn at the memory bank-This film features the late great Raul Julia, as Aram Fingal, a bored data entry person in a kinda Orwellian future. He is caught watching cinemas, (movies), and is sent to madatory doppling rehab. He is doppled into a baboon named Daisy, and the film goes downhill from there. In the middle of it somehow Fingal puts hiself in the mainframe program, and starts to write his own life. Abalonia gives Fingal contrdictory orders, and the evil exec threatens to kill Fingal. At one point the movie tries to rip off Casablanca, with Rick and the fat man making appearances. Anyway other things to watch for are the perverted kid(who actually causes all the trouble), Abalonia Jane the heroine who seems so biboesque, crappy special effects, and the evil exec, who looks like TV's frank from the Comedy Central days. This movie hates anteaters for no good reason. The ending of this movie is so confusing that you think the writers just threw up their hands and said ""i don't care..""  Made for PBS so remember that next time they try and guilt you into pledging money. Favoite line: "" I bet no one ever downloads this cinema"" (9.0/10)
Girl in gold boots-An awful 60's flick. The main charactars are Michelle, a waitress turned dancer who who has an alcoholic abusive father, Buzz a hooligan and nogoodnik, who promises to make Michelle a pro dancer, and Critter, a poetic beatnik-hippie sort who rides a motorcycle (named traveler) and plays the guitar.(I use the term plays loosely) Critter is also a draft-dodger to be. This threesome go to Los Angeles, where Buzz's sister Joanie, (who is a pro dancer and drug addict) takes Michelle under her wing, buzz becomes involved in Leo's (the dance club owner) drug empire and Critter becoming a custodian and song writer. After about an hour of vaguely sexy girls dancing, we get to a drug caper that goes south when Buzz kills a guy for no reason. I liked Joey the pusher, he was the hippest charactar in the film, what he is doing isn't so cool but he is. After Critter beats up Leo, Buzz and Leo's flunky Marty, he joins the Army and marries Michelle. By the way Critter is terrible at playing the guitar and Michelle is even worse at dancing. It has terrible editing. How bad? Buzz suddenly appears in a scene, he just appears doesn't walk on or anything, and there is random guy who gives Buzz and Michelle rides in a dune buggy. I swear I am not making this up.  Good all-around episode here. Favorite Line: Okay here's a riddle which one of these two people is worse at their art form?""(9.5/10)

1943002,5,B0000TAYWA,"Another great boxed set of painful theater by Rhino!  Once again, the packaging is cute as hell, and I couldn't agree more with the movies featured in this pack.  A new feature that MiSTies will enjoy is the commentary from Mike at the start of each DVD--it's a brief 10 seconds, but fun anyway.
This time around, you'll be treated to cinematic disasters called:
1.)Girl in Gold Boots--a movie about a waitress who wants to become--AHEM--a dancer in L.A.  She achieves this by hooking up with a young man (he's 43!) who promises that his sister can make her into a dancer.  And there's Critter, the draft-dodging mop boy who's just loaded with money, if you happen to be in NEPAL.  Other gems in the plot--though totally unrelated--are the bikers who bicker with Buzz, the inexplicable bath tub dune buggy ride, and my favorite, the bongo players who don't even seem to be in the same movie.  ""I'm an icky elf!""
2.) Space Mutiny--a futuristic spaceship with a HUGE boiler room.  Captain Santa Claus's ship has been overtaken by Diabolik (for all you MiSTies out there), and the only man capable of saving the ship is Dave Ryder, a beefy, dense bodybuilder <Bolt Vanderhuge> who screams like a girl through half the film. Brace yourself for TONS of 80s aerobics wear and no shame at all.  ""Railing kill!""
3.)Overdrawn at the Memory Bank--not really a movie, but a series that ran on PBS, and once you watch it, you'll see why.  Raul Julia plays Aram Fingal, a bored data entry clerk who is separated from his body through the rehabilitative process of doppling.  He's assumed into the big machine and wreaks all sorts of havoc on Nirvana Village.  A huge man with an obvious thyroid problem wanders around the film, makes a threatening presence, and sweats a lot.  What the hell is this film about?  WHO KNOWS!!!  ""I am interfaced!  BFD!!!!!""
4.)Hamlet--a dreary, translated German version with Maximillian Schell that shouldn't be viewed by anyone alive.  While it hurts to say this, this MST isn't that funny until you've seen it about 3 times.  The first time I watched it, I wanted to stop it and put ""Manos"" on instead. IT IS THAT BAD.

1943003,4,B0000TAYWA,"Rhino's first release of Sci-Fi era episodes of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" is not as hilarious as many of the Comedy Central offerings, but is still a good buy for and MST3K fan.
""Space Mutiny"" is perhaps the best episode offered here. It is a ridiculous and boring science fiction thing about...a mutiny in space. ""Hamlet"" is not one of the more popular MST3K episodes, although I found it a reasonably funny, unique experiment. ""The Girl in Gold Boots"" is perhaps my least favorite episode in this collection, because the riffing is less inspired. ""Overdrawn at the Memory Bank"" is a hilarious episode.
""OATMB"" also has my favorite riff in this set, a throwback to the Comedy Central days: ""Hey, it's TV's Frank. He's really come up in the world!""
While the movie segments of these episodes are all pretty good, my biggest problem with the Sci-Fi era episodes are the scenes with Pearl Forrester. They are incredibly unfunny and lame, especially the ones in ancient Rome from ""Space Mutiny.""
On DVD, the movie scenes are fairly uneven. ""Hamlet"" and ""The Girl in Gold Boots"" are scratchy and blurry, while ""Space Mutiny"" and ""Overdrawn at the Memory Bank"" are as good as can be expected. The intermission scenes are much sharper and with brighter colors. Each episode has an introduction by Mike Nelson. These introductions are reasonably diverting, but they are on the short side (25 to 35 seconds).

1943005,4,B0000TAYWA,"I was looking forward to this release from the moment it was announced.  You see, the last three seasons of Mystery Science Theater 3000 felt like ""my"" years.  It was only after the show jumped from Comedy Central to The Science Fiction Channel that I would be able to watch regularly on my cable provider.  So, when I heard that the fourth DVD box set would be a selection from those years, I was pleased.  And when the episodes themselves were listed, I was happy with the picks.  These are good MST3k episodes.
Here are some short comments on each of the four episodes included in the DVD box set:
GIRL IN GOLD BOOTS  --  A grumpy and moody drifter, an intellectual who randomly loses his beard halfway through the film, and a woman who looks like a frumpy Angelina Jolie travel to LA.  Once there, they get involved in some drug-dealing scheme that makes little sense.  The mocking that the film receives from the crew is a little run of the mill, but still makes for an entertaining episode.  Also included on this disc is a melodramatic movie trailer for GIRL IN GOLD BOOTS and a fun, cheesy TV spot.
HAMLET --  Yes, that Hamlet.  I remember when this episode was first broadcast; early Internet rumors spoke of a German-produced Shakespeare play that had been translated, first from the original English into German, and then literally translated straight back into English without regard for the original.  Unfortunately, those rumors turned out to be much more interesting than what we got.  This German version of Hamlet is boring, and, well, boring.  The MST3k crew does a decent job of mocking both Shakespeare (""I thought frailty's name was Carl..."") and this production's rather stilted direction.  One gets the feeling that the writers had been holding onto some of these riffs since High School English class.  I liked this one, but I don't feel it was one of their strongest efforts.  Still, it's nice to see them moving outside their established genre of movies.
OVERDRAWN AT THE MEMORY BANK  --  An awful mid-80s movie, with annoying mid-80s music, shot in a mid-80s office building on mid-80s videotape.  This stars the talented Raul Julia who, as the cast informs us from time to time, usually turned in much better performances than this one.  In any event, he gets lost inside a Virtual Reality computer where he creates a Virtual Reality Casablanca for himself.  I wouldn't mind getting lost in a Virtual Reality Casablanca, but I would hope that I'd find myself a better script than this.  Oh, and apparently in the future, the world is ruled by a bloated version of Doctor Who writer Terrance Dicks.  This is one of the goofiest episodes of the show and also one of the most hilarious.  I still cannot think of the film's climax with smirking, and the telephone call that Mike makes to the film's technical support line during the closing credits is one of the more original and amusing jokes that they did in the series.
SPACE MUTINY  --  In a giant spaceship resembling a warehouse, a space mutiny is taking place... but nobody cares.  There are also some weird space babes jumping around a dark room, but after seeing the film three or four times, I still have no idea what they're supposed to be doing.  This film rivals the previous movie for sheer goofiness.  The mocking that it receives is one of the sharpest that I've seen.  The bots' attempts to keep track of the films high number of ""railing kills"" are an absolute hoot.
For this DVD box set, host Mike Nelson has recorded all-new introductions where he basically explains that the writers and producers of the show don't know what the deal was with any of these movies either.  He sort of looks like they just woke him up.  Perhaps he just went into shock at the thought of all the hours he spent watching these bad movies.
In any case, this is another strong release from Rhino.  The DVD box sets have generally been of great quality, as even where there is a less funny episode included it will have three top-notch companions to raise the average.  This, the fourth release, continues the run of worthy packages, and is recommended to long-time fans or to anyone who still hasn't gotten into this great series.",1070582400,14,4203,4.670748299319728
1943006,4,B0000TAYWA,"I don't think I've ever been disappointed over any of the MST3K releases so far.  Even The Crawling Hand has it's moments.
Unforunately I don't have cable TV.  So far I've just had to live off the Rhino releases.  For some reason this release just hasn't given me as good an impression as the others.  There is a definite difference with the SciFi episodes.  It really feels like the cast is holding back.  There were so many moments when an obvious or perfect comment were definitely needed and the cast just sits there with their mouths shut.
The worst offender is Hamlet.  What were they thinking?  They make timid little remarks about every couple minutes.  And there was plenty to make fun of.  Were they trying to be respectful to the play?  Most of the jokes have to do with Shakespeare's actual words rather than how crappy the interpretation is.  Couldn't they have mocked the German-ness at least a little bit??  Instead they make cornball 'great dane' jokes.
Girl in the Gold Boots is pretty funny at times and mediocre at others.  Once again, it really felt like they were holding back their insults.
At least Overdrawn at the Memory Bank and Space Mutiny redeem this collection.  The cheesy 80s special effects bring the outrageousness that is missing in Hamlet and to a lesser degree Girl in Gold Boots.
I love MST3K as much as anyone, but I'm not going to turn a blind eye to how boring some of these episodes are.  You can definitely tell that a vital ingredient to the show was lost after Trace and Frank left.",1070236800,,1527,4.5793357933579335
1943007,5,B0000TAYWA,"It's true that all of these movies are from the Sci-Fi channel era.  And it's true that they've all been on recently.  However, wouldn't you rater have clean, crisp DVD versions instead of grainy videotaped versions in which you have to fast-forward through the commercials?  I know that I would.  Plus, all of these selections have a 30-45 second introduction by Mike Nelson, and the trailers for ""Girl in Gold Boots.""  Let's break it down:
""Hamlet"" - I know, I know - it would seem very tedious to sit through Hamlet, but Mike and the Bots do a great job of riffing on this poorly dubbed, over (and under) acted, moody German version of Hamlet.  B+
""Girl in Gold Boots"" - Think ""Showgirls"" only worse (!).  A waitress from the sticks leaves her abusive father and heads to L.A. with a shady character and a guitar playing hippie named Critter to become a dancer.  But nobody bothered to tell her that she kind of sucks as a dancer.  She becomes involved in a tailspin of bad music, bad outfits, and marijuana.  Check out the bizarre over-acting of the lead dancer.  A-
""Overdrawn at the Memory Bank"" - This ranks right up there with ""Manos: The Hands of Fate"" as the worst movie I've ever seen on MST3K.  Raul Julia ""stars"" in this PBS movie as a man in the future who's brain gets trapped in a computer during a botched procedure which was supposed to insert his brain into a monkey.  Or something.  Very confusing, very boring, and very 80s special effects.  Be warned - this is an AWFUL mess of a movie.  At times I found it hard to sit through, but it's worth watching.  C+
""Space Mutiny"" - the best of the bunch.  It's in space, and there's a mutiny, but for the life of me, I can't figure out what goes on.  Be prepared for excitement as our beefy hero indulges in a futruistic golf cart chase, and relaxes at a futuristic disco where hula hoops seem to be all the rage.  This is a must-see, especially for the names Mike and the bots come up with for our hero (""Gristle McThornbody!""  ""Big McLargehuge!"").  A
I know that a lot of people wish for more Comedy Central episodes, but it's very hard to get licensing for these films.  Especially now that MST3K is more popular and the company has realized that these films are essentially being made fun of.  But beggars can't be choosers.  I'll be happy with anything Best Brains, Inc. releases on DVD.",1070236800,,2357,4.450934579439252
1943008,5,B0000TAYWA,"Although many of us are still wishing for Rhino Video to release more episodes from the Comedy Central era, these are four strong episodes nonetheless that any fan of the show will enjoy. Especially strong are Space Mutiny and Girl In Gold Boots. Space Mutiny stars Cameron Mitchell and for some reason his real life daughter along with some beefy no-name as the hero. The stock footage of the space ship battles is from Battlestar Galactica, so that tells you how much effort and money went into this hilarious attempt at ""space opera"". The acting and action sequences will have you rolling on the floor in spasms of laughter. For example, the climactic chase in the odd little golf cart-type vehicles at the end of the film will make your eyes water it is so goofy. Girl In Gold Boots is from one of the kings of grade-Z movies, Ted Mikels (of Astro Zombies fame), and is surpisingly good for him, but is nevertheless great fodder for Mike and the 'Bots, who proceed to find humor in all of the crazy 60's characters and issues in the film.
The other episodes include a German version of Hamlet. Since Shakespeare is one of head-writer Mike Nelson's great loves, it's loads of fun hearing him unleash his wit on this botched version of what may be the greatest play ever written. Finally, Overdrawn At The Memory Bank is a low-budget PBS version of a story by SF writer John Varley. Raul Julia's always adequate acting ability cannot save this film from everything else in it that is just plain wrong. The host segments making fun of PBS pledge drives are some of the best from the Sci-Fi Channel episodes of MST3K.
I personally enjoyed all of these episodes and purchased this DVD set as soon as it became available. Note that this set, unlike other Rhino MST3K releases, contains some new commentary by Michael J. Nelson.
Now, Rhino Video, please hear my pleas and release more Comedy Central episodes, especially those for which you already own the movie rights, like Teenagers From Outerspace or Giant Gila Monster. How about some Robert Lippert film episodes, like Rocketship X-M, King Dinosaur or Lost Continent? We want them now!",1069718400,8,2138,4.719251336898396

8002495,5,B0000TAYWA,"The Volume 4 Collection is a must have for any serious collector of the MST3K DVDs.  I'll get the negatives out of the way.  There is little in the way of special features-just the original trailers.  Although it does have the brief intro by Mike, which I miss about later DVDs.  The 4 episodes are all from the Sci-Fi Channel era, so if you want a broad sampling of MST3K over it's 10 season run, this isn't a good example of it.  That said, Volume 4 contains 2 of the best episodes for introducing yourself, a friend or a relative to the Satalite of Love-""Overdrawn at the Memory Bank"" and ""Space Mutiny.""  Mike and the Bots bring their A-Game to ripping on the movies, and the two movies fall squarely into the ""cheesey bad"" camp, rather than the ""soul-crushing bad"" category that is more likely to frieghten away newcomers.

As for the other two movies, ""Hamlet"" is one of the ""soul-crushing bad"" movies, so it's more suited for veterans of the series.  I still enjoyed it, but it's not a good intro movie like the first two.  ""Girl in Gold Boots"" I admittedly have the not much of an opinion formed yet.  I did enjoy the host segments-watching Bill Corbett dance shirtless is something that should not be passed up.",1346976000,,1220,4.504545454545455
8002496,5,B0000TAYWA,"This is one of the few sets that is kind of a mixed bag of good and bad to me, course since its MST3K its always more often than not fun.

Episode 1002: Girl In The Gold Boots
This is the infamous episode with a girl at a diner who dreams of making it big in Hollywood. Along comes a man named Buz who says he can help her make it big as he has a sister whose a famous dancer. Also there's a guy named Critter who is a songwriter thats an Elvis type rip off. Its a mess of a movie, there's an endless ride on a beach buggy that has no reason to be here. Its not what I've thought as the best episode they've ever done, the crew tries but even the best can have an off day. Favorite Line: Not so much a line but when Buz just appears in a scene out of nowhere like he was teleported, that was funny.

Episode 1009: Hamlet
This cheap, bland German version of the classic play is certainly a hard one to sit through movie wise. The acting, the dramatic time consuming pauses and the ultra cheap sets make it so hard to watch. Though Mike and the bots do the best they can with the material they have, when they hit its solid, when they miss its very obvious. Favorite Line: ""Stop the world, I wanna get off""

Episode 822: Overdrawn at the Memory Bank
Here we have Raul Julia in the future, he gets doppled into a monkey cause he's a bad employee and somehow gets lost in cyberspace, or something close to it. I'm not exactly sure and I'm fairly certain the filmakers didn't either. This is one of the best they've done period in my opinion, as they just go nuts on everyone and everything in this movie, nothing is safe. Favorite Line: The whole sequence where the fat guy talks to Raul's charatcer by a pool, absolutely gut busting.

Episode 820: Space Mutiny
Here we have a bunch of guys trying to mutiny on a spaceship, that looks a lot like a huge warehouse/basement, I mean you can even see the sun shining though despite the fact they're in deep space. There's also a big beefy guy named Ryder who tries to take down these bad guys with the help of a woman who looks like she could be his mom. Though apparently these two are dating in real life. Also funny that the space footage is from the late 70's series Battlestar Galatica, which I'm fairly certain wasn't used legally by the director. Its easily another one of the best from the crew, their riffs based on Ryder are comedic gold. Favorite Line: ""I think it's very nice of you to give that dead woman another chance.""",1310342400,,2477,4.197478991596639
8002497,5,B0000TAYWA,"I originally found out about MST3k while it was in its final couple of years on the Sci-Fi channel, so I differ from some fans in that I really don't think the SciFi episodes are in any way inferior, and I really think Bill Corbet did a great job as crow.  I've seen plenty of the CC episodes too, mind you, so I'm aquainted with every phase of the show, I just see a lot of fans poo poo the SciFi years, and I'll tell you right now some of my very favorite episodes are from those last few seasons.

Anyway, here's a breakdown of Vol 4, which feature 4 episodes from the SciFi era of the show, all episodes that I was familiar with, but until I bought this box set, I hadn't seen in at least 5 or 6 years:

GIRL IN GOLD BOOTS:  A 60's drama that chronicles the rise of Michelle, an aspiring Go Go dancer and her eventual entanglement in the world of drug dealing that everyone in these rise to fame movies falls into.  I remember this being an ""okay"" episode previously, but now having watched it a few times again its become one of my top 10 favorite episodes.  I think this is actually a really great ""first episode"" to show to people who haven't seen the show before.  The movie has some really wacky characters, the plot is cliched but moves quickly enough, and everything they do to accomplish those set plot points they do in just the stupidest way possible (the idiotic dancing, pouring beer on a motorcycle seat, robbing a jail by having ONE trustee exit, then having TWO come back in while being completely unnoticed by the sheriff they JUST WALKED PAST), making all the riffing just as easy as can be.  Really a great episode, even the host segments are funny (Mike ""Taliban"" Nelson).  One of the best on the set, and like I said, one of my top 10 favorites.

HAMLET:  This one gets trashed by a ton of MSTies but I don't really understand why.  True, its not the greatest episode, but its far from deserving the ""worst episode ever"" tag that gets repeatedly thrown at it (I'd watch this over SWAMP DIAMONDS any day of the week).  Basically, its Hamlet, but a terribly boring, sparsely set, Made-for-German-TV version that Mike and the Bots have to sit through.  Its about the dullest production of Hamlet I've seen, but I still thought they did an admirable job, and I found myself laughing out loud quite a bit at several very funny riffs (see my review title for one such example).  I think it gets a bad rap mainly due to fans not really being familiar with Shakespeare, and therefore are somewhat intolerant of the film itself.  Whatever the reason is for all the haters though, i still think its a fine episode, not the best by a long shot, but still quite enjoyable to me.

OVERDRAWN AT THE MEMORY BANK:  A movie made for PBS starring Raul Julia.  Its just a terrible Sci Fi movie that makes very little sense at all.  I remember liking this episode a lot back in the day, but upon watching it again found it to be a bit on the boring side.  The riffs weren't that fast and furious, and the movie itself is just a chore.  Its still worth watching, and I did get a chuckle or two, but I remembered it being much funnier.  Still a fan favorite, so your milage may vary, but its not a favorite of this fan.

SPACE MUTINY:  A classic.  Basically the 80's Sci Fi equivalent of ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" in that it gets everything so very wrong that it ends up being a completely hilarious movie, though not at all on purpose.  Mike and the Bots have a field day with this one and the great riffs combined with the complete insanity of the actual film itself make it an easy favorite of mine.  How can you not love the car chase through the ships basement on two dinky electric go carts(""Toro! Toro!... These things are made by Toro!"")?  Just so much to love about this episode, its a must own.

All in all, a good set of episodes.  Two are amazing, two are okay, but all are worth seeing at least once.",1302307200,,3915,4.307377049180328
