476422,5,6302491940,"The film industry likes to remake classic films, they think they can assure return on investment at the box office. If it worked for them it will work for us. This, True Grit and The Poseidon Adventure are good examples of films they shouldn't have messed with. The setup, the training and the execution of the raid are all well done. The getaway chase scene is classic. It isn't a modern day exploding cars escape, and I hesitate to call it realistic, but it was filmed on location. But they trashed a lot of minis doing it. Best of all there's no horrific attempt at an English accent by a sad American.",1514678400,,605,4.410714285714286
476423,3,6302491940,"Review of The Italian Job
Hot Toasty Rag, November 30, 2017

As you might be able to guess from the title, The Italian Job involves just that. Michael Caine has just been released from prison, and he goes to Italy to take part in a large-scale robbery, with the help of his friends Noel Coward, Lelia Goldoni, Maggie Blye, and Benny Hill.

Its quite a bit different than the 2003 remake with Mark Wahlberg, but since they both star pretty dreamy leads, no matter which one you rent Im sure youll be thoroughly entertained. In the original, Michael Caine utters one of the most famous one-liners after his colleague detonates a van: You were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off! If youve heard of that line, chances are youve heard of this film. Theres also an incredibly famous ending to this movie, which I won't spoil for you. Depending on your point of view, itll make you love or hate the movie, but I really liked the ending. It fits the rest of the film, and Michael Caines 1960s persona, perfectly. If you're just starting out on the heist film genre, both versions of The Italian Job are great places to start. Theyre entertaining, humorous without being cheesy, and have some pretty tense scenes that will have you on the edge of your seat.",1512000000,,1256,4.553097345132743
476424,5,6302491940,"I had never seen the original Italian Job, (only the Charlize Theron remake) and I can truthfully say that this is light-years ahead of it's counterpart. It stars Michael Caine in one of his most iconic perfomances. And features at least 2 of his most famous lines ever. (I think you know what they are by now). Plus the film stars Benny Hill! As a kid I loved watching him on Channel 9 WOR and never tired of his antics and hijinxs. And he's great here, even though it's only a small role. And there's Noel Coward, who is great as the mob boss who directs the entire enterprise from his jail cell.
  In the end, the reasons why this movie is so much better than the cruddy remake are clear. This version of The Italian Job is a very '60's, British, Swinging London-type film. Most of the seeds for the Austin Powers movies were sown here. It's kind of campy, in a very British way, and is more than a bit funny. While the remake, on the other hand, is much grittier, darker, and has all of the campy humor drained out of it just to make a stupid action film. It basically turns The Italian Job into Gone in 60 Seconds. (Remember that turkey?) The Mini's make an appearance just to keep one strand of thread connected to the original. It's not good enough.
  This one, however, is more than good enough. It's great. If you like Michael Caine, or car movies, or classic '60's British cinema, or you just prefer the original to the remake, (Memo to Hollywood: Stop with the remakes and reboots! Come up with some original ideas for once!) then I think you'll love The Italian Job. Sometimes you just can't top the original.-------------------PEACE",1511222400,,1645,4.473333333333334

476427,1,6302491940,"This was a HOT MESS!!!  Where to begin?  This isn't dated - it's just lacking coherent plotting and direction ......that's all.  However, Michael Caine is in really good form here, being tough, masculine, and forthright - but he appears to be acting in another film!!  The film that surrounds him has extraneous female characters, too many people assisting in the execution of the heist plan to care about them (Benny HiIl as the computer guy - REALLY?), and a pointless subplot involving Noel Coward (?!?!) as a prison official who has a hand in Caine's heist plan.  Stupid background music by the not-always-reliable Quincy Jones includes a thoroughly moronic song at the end of the film over the final chase - it's the earworm from hell!!!  The mini-cooper chase scenes are thrilling, but even with that, there's is some plotting and direction ideas that are just odd and tedious.  Let's not even discuss the ""ending"" ......the film just stops at a certain point.  If you want to see it, RENT IT FIRST!!!!",1503792000,,1008,4.819767441860465

476445,1,6302491940,"This a very confused movie, right up to the cliff hanger ending with no resolve. The Michael Caine driven male - female relationships are messed up beyond repair. The mastermind lives in a prison, and goes to to a dumpy wooden outhouse as his place of priviledge. The film embarks with warm romantic music as we follow a classic sports car smoothly weaving along a mountain road in Italy. Are we headed for a hot date? Not today pal, unless you think that a high speed bulldozer car crunch vendetta is sexy. The car chase sequences with the Mini Coopers are fun and they do drive through some inventive spaces.

The features are great too, explaining how the movie came to be, the problems with filming, and the incredible chase scenes in Turin done without informing the local police beforehand.  Even Benny Hill thrown in for essentially one joke.  It all works for fun entertainment.
Don't bother with the unfunny American version.",1490572800,,482,4.975

476533,5,6302491940,"There are few genres as enduring in the movie biz as the heist and they don't come any more entertaining than this one. Michael Caine is at his best as a fresh-out-of-jail, small-time crook who decides to pull the job of the century. To achieve this, he sets about finding someone to bankroll the enterprise, in the person of Noel Coward. Coward, a big time syndicate boss is still running his business from jail and after some persuasion, agrees.
Caine then sets about assembling a cast of idiosyncratic no-hopers to carry out his bold plan, among them Benny Hill, an electronics wizard with a fondness for fat women. After much practicing, three teams in Mini Coopers (driven by ""chinless wonders"") set off for Italy with a bus-full or two of supporters all dressed as soccer fans. The arrival on the scene of the Mafia does little to dampen their enthusiasm and the fun really starts.
The climax of this action/farce is the car chase through the streets, sewers and even the skyline of Turin. Plenty of action, plenty of laughs and all very well paced. If anything, it's probably too short (though I don't mean the ending...) but I guess that just makes you appreciate it that much more. An old favorite which is hard to beat.

476558,5,6302491940,"Let's start at the beginning, 1969-small downtown theatre, Texas. The marquee reads ""The Italian Job"" and Michael Caine. And that was virtually all the promotion this film got. The producers on the bluray talk of the failure of the movie in the USA and it was no wonder with how it was just dumped into theaters with no aplomb. Lucky for me the theatre included Michael Caine in the title because at 14, I thought he was the coolest dude in cinema at the time (I felt blessed by the gods that I had wavy hair like him). I still remember clearly the sign and the serendipity of seeing two new Jaguar XKEs parked out front presumably owned by the fighter pilots from the nearby AFB. Seeing The Italian Job then and there made it one of my favorite movies of all time. This was a zeitgeist experience. If you are not of those times, then the movie may be enjoyable, but its magic is just a mystery to you. I mention all this because most reviewers of older movies don't capture that first love experience that original fans have. I can appreciate Gable, Cooper, and Flynn, but not on the level of a 1930's or '40's filmgoer. So that makes the extras on the bluray so enjoyable as fortunately, most of the participants were still around in 2009. And despite what the Amazon description says, my US bluray Has been playing all the features. It was good to see that such a major Hollywood player as Robert Evans was a big supporter of Italian Job and is still fan enough to contribute his interview.
I don't need to go into plot, critiquing, etc. Because that is well covered ground. In closing, this is a must have for those who love this movie. For a lonnng time it was unavailable, and then came out on EXTENDED play video tape (the cheapest format in VHS-thank God those days
are over). Then the DVD (just had to make sure I was ordering the real Italian Job and not that new crap-name stealer) came out. If they can
ever convert it to 3D, I'd buy that. But the truth is soon no one will be around that grew up with this movie and the zeitgeist, like the morning  mist will have vanished and no one will put up the money to polish up this gem and put it on display.

BUT, this will remind you why so many later 60's movies made you want to take a shower and clean your house.  Ugly people doing ugly deeds were made to look fun and cool.  Everybody treats everybody else like trash and we're all supposed to chuckle at their cleverness and worldliness.  I like Michael Caine's acting generally, and he was in some truly top movies, but in this I just couldn't help groaning, knowing what has happened to our culture because of stuff like this.

Stunt driving by Remy Julienne's team was incredible. None of the modern CGI crap but actual driving skills using vehicles most of today's younger drivers could not handle(i.e no GPS, ABS, power steering, etc).

I sought this out because I loved the remake, but I wish I had skipped it.  I like Michael Caine and was excited to see Benny Hill in a role, however Caine is probably the best thing about the film and Hill's role is forgettable.  The film takes a long time to get to the good stuff (the heist,) then ends remarkably abruptly without a resolution.  I had to rewind it a bit to see if I missed something, but it's just like they let the credits role in the middle of a scene.

Join Sir Michael Caine and his gang of crooks for the ultimate British caper movie packed with fast cars, beautiful girls and swinging 60s action. In his final screen appearance, Sir Noel Coward joyfully sends up his own patriotic persona, and there are small though priceless cameos from the likes of Irene Handl and John Le Mesurier.

The Italian Job 40th Anniversary Special Edition blows the doors off with astonishing array of BRAND NEW extras, including EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEWS WITH SIR MICHAEL CAINE, QUINCY JONES and others, as the tell us what really happened making The Italian Job. PLUS HOST OF STUNTS, MINIS and MORE, in this thrilling set of DEFINITIVE DOCUMENTARIES and COMMENTARIES.

FILM FACT: The music for the soundtrack was written by Quincy Jones. The opening theme, ""On Days Like These"", had lyrics by Don Black and was sung by Matt Monro. The closing theme, ""Get a Bloomin' Move On"" (aka ""The Self Preservation Society""), was performed by the cast and had lyrics featuring Cockney Rhyming Slang. Many incidental themes are based on British patriotic songs, such as ""Rule, Britannia!"", ""The British Grenadiers"" and ""God Save the Queen,"" and lead actor Sir Michael Caine is among its singers. Although it received a Golden Globe nomination for ""Best English-Language Foreign Film,"" the film was not a success in America. Sir Michael Caine blamed its failure on unattractive and misleading advertising. As a result, plans for a sequel were shelved.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: In this classic crime film, small-time crook Charlie Croker [Sir Michael Caine] organises a motley group of thieves to steal four million worth of gold bullion from an armoured car in Turin, Italy. The mastermind of the heist is Mr. Bridger [Sir Noel Coward], an experienced convict who has come up with the idea, but can't take part in its execution because he's in jail. To pull off the plan, the gang must tie up traffic in the centre of the city to divert attention from the robbery, and ultimately make off with their booty undetected. The caper leads to one of the most exciting and fantastic automobile chases ever filmed.

I cant stress enough how wonderfully, quintessentially 60s The Italian Job is. The cars, the clothes, the music, the camera work, the exuberance. And the women, ironed down hair, goofy underwear, and every one of them as beautiful as a Bond girl, with even less dialogue. Because the film is essentially quirky British attitude, the robbery is not simply a capitalist venture. The heist comes across, however vaguely and misguidedly, as the last hurrah of some youthful social rebellion. The films light-hearted tone turns briefly revolutionary as the lad's club police officers and smash pickaxe handles through cop car windshields. The Italian Job also makes light of the antagonism Britain has always had with the rest of Europe, especially with bloody foreigners one of the crooks mutters as he wanders Italy. Words and phrases like anarchy and angry young man would not be inappropriate. This was the 1960s, after all, when even action movies were allowed to have social commentary.

Enter the legendary Sir Michael Caine, in one sharp suit after another, whose name is deservedly painted like the Union Jack in the re-release trailer. He plays Charlie Croaker, fresh from prison with absolutely no compunction about turning to crime again. The prize is a half-ton of gold being transported through a giant traffic jam in Turin during an Italy-UK soccer match. To this end, Croaker enlists a small army of Cockney crooks, and soon its bloomin this and bloody that as the lads soup up three mini Coopers. Theres bugger-all we can do about it as were off to Italy where our heroes can short out computerized video cameras, cross the Mafia, and walk nonchalantly past jaw-dropping Renaissance architecture. The movie doesnt bother developing the gang too much; Tony Beckley is the prissy one, Stanley Caine (Michaels brother) is the lummox, and Benny Hill is well, Benny Hill, and lets all thank God for that.

Blu-ray Video Quality  This is a 100% top of the shelf image from Paramount Pictures on this classic brilliant British film. All the stunning 1080p encode image and with the breath taking 2.35:1 [Anamorphic] aspect ratio has a stunning bright, happy colours, and impressively high detail for a film celebrating its 40th Anniversary, which you would thought was filmed today. It shows some depth, strong contrast and black levels. It looks almost brand new and seems to have greatly benefited from the move to hi-def. The visuals approach the spectacular with over 26 Gig being filled on the dual-layered disc for the feature film. All in all Paramount Pictures has done a sterling impressive job.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  On the English language front we have a brilliant 5.1 TrueHD Master Audio Surround mix or you have the option for the restored mono track. The disc starts by giving you a choice of about a dozen different languages for menus and optional DUBs and subs. I'm usually a fan of the original but I switched to the 5.1 TrueHD mix as it gives you a much more natural sound and it suited the film well with so many more subtle effect noise and sympathetic music tones sounding crisp and clean. The car chase scenes are dramatic and evenly separated with some action to the rear speakers.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary with screenwriter Troy Kennedy Martin and Mathew Field, author of ""The Making of The Italian Job"": A great, very informative commentary. The two gentlemen discuss the history of the film, what it took to get it made, how it resonated with critics and audiences.

Audio Commentary: Commentary by producer Michel Deeley and Matthew Field, author of ""The Making of The Italian Job"": A new commentary recorded for the special edition of the film. Once again, a wealth of information is supplied.

Special Feature: Self-Preservation Society: Making of The Italian Job [2003] [1080p] [89:00] A selection of behind-the-scenes episodes where many of those who were involved with the film talk about its history, legacy, appeal, style, etc. and is a terrific brilliant supplemental feature. Contributors include Don Black, John Clive, Hazel Collinson, Michael Deeley, Frank Jarvis, Disley Jones, Troy Kennedy-Martin, Douglas Slocombe, John Trumper, Derek Ware and Philip Wrestler. Narrated by Lancelot Narayan. Directed by Lancelot Narayan and Matthew Field. Screenplay by Lancelot Narayan and Matthew Field. Music by Quincy Jones. Cinematography by John Hazell.

Special Feature: Mini Adventures [2009] [1080p] [17:00] A celebration of what many regard as the true star of The Italian Job, the Mini, which is enthused over by stunt driver Russ Swift, whose career as the leader of a Mini display team was inspired by his love affair with the film, The Italian Job director Peter Collinson's son and self-confessed Mini fanatic Tara Collinson, and vehicle suppliers, drivers and actors in the film Barry Cox and David Salamone. Directed by Daniel Skinner and Matthew Field. Music by Quincy Jones. Cinematography by Iain Ovenden and Nick Barnett.

Special Feature: Music Video [1080p] [4:00] The Self-Preservation Society. Get a Bloomin' Move On (aka The Self-Preservation Society as it is sometimes referred to) originated from old East End tunes like My Old Man's a Dustman. Quincy had a fascination with Cockney rhyming slang, he found it very funny and apparently created it for the amusement of the production team.

Special Feature: The Deleted Scene with Commentary by author Matthew Field [480i] [2:00] The only deleted scene from the film is deconstructed by Matthew Field.

Theatrical Trailer [1969] [1080p] [3:14] This is the Original Theatrical Trailer for The Italian Job. When The Italian Job was released in the UK, it didn't receive many blistering reviews; in fact it was quite the opposite. The British film review press elite thought it to be unpolished and rather rude. Despite the bad press, many individual cinemas put in a lot of work to promote the film displaying Mini Coopers on stairways and even on the roof of foyers. Even though it wasn't a smash hit, it was nominated for a Golden Globe for 'Best English Language Foreign Film' in 1969.

Re-Release Theatrical Trailer [1999] [1080p] [1:45] Back in 1969, little did the critics know that The Italian Job would become a full blown cult movie with later reviews of its re-release on the 10th September 1999 being nothing short of fan-bloody-tastic. In an interview with The Sunday Times, writer Troy Kennedy Martin had a stab at explaining why the film had become such a success 30 years on Much of the reason why it's so fashionable right now is today's ""Loaded culture,"" which has made it alright to be a lad again.

Finally, this is such a fun film and Sir Michael Caine is totally perfect. The Italian Job is a fun British Comedy Caper. Excellent performances, and one of the most memorable car chases ever filmed make this a very enjoyable movie. Paramount presents this film in a special collectors edition with some interesting added features. The menu sequence is also nicely done, with a 3D animated rendering of the three Minis. This Blu-ray is close to perfect impeccable image transfer, great audio options and, possibly, the most complete extras of the year. Super job Paramount and Wow - what a package! The other amazing aspect of this film, is hearing the silky smooth voice of the amazing British Singer Matt Monro singing over the opening credits, that was composed by Quincy Jones, and includes ""On Days Like These"" and the lyrics were penned by Don Black, another brilliant Brit. Very Highly Recommended!

Although there isn't a whole lot of pyrotechnics like the remake, this film makes up for that by being a lot of fun, and quite funny at times. Sure, there's a lack of character development for most of the members of the team, but most of them have a little moment or two here and there. Arguably, the best part of the movie outside of the performances and humor is the climactic Mini Cooper chase through the streets of Turin, followed by a (SPOILER!) literal cliffhanger of an ending, which I think works better than the happy ending in the remake.

476954,3,6302491940,"So, this is the original, and I just saw the remake several days ago. I am not going to make comments on how much better or worse this one was in comparison. What I will say is they leave so much out. Why is the character Michael Caine plays such a celebrity criminal? How is it that a major crime boss can come and go as he pleases from a high security prison? And didn't have more capable people involved? Left all the details in the hands of the main character? How was this supposed to be funny? Making fun of the Italians and the mob? Nah, it just didn't go over well. While I understand this was made in the 60's, and reflects attitudes from that time, it just didn't gel for me. I watched the entire film, and the highlights were the circuitous route the stunt drivers took, and how well they drove (for stunt driving back then). Meh. The supposed cliff-hanger ending just showcased the bumbling of the main character, and the whole operation. Throwing a bicycle into the power grid kills it? Doubtful. Sure, this was supposed to be a comic caper, and for the time probably did just fine. On its own, it's still okay, but it would have been a low-budget film that would have seen little screen time, I think, even with an actor like Caine involved. I like Caine as an actor, and as a comedian, and have enjoyed far better films with him as lead. Feel like I wasted my time, but stayed through it so I could have a basis for comparison against the remake. The idea sounded so much better than what came out on film. 3 'Meh' stars.",1396396800,,1536,4.3

476956,4,6302491940,"Michael Caine's reputation was built on a series of performances playing the lovable bastard - The Italian Job being the prime example. Caine's thief treats his women with casual disdain, his cohorts in the heist with even more casual disregard, but somehow manages to make us love him anyway. Remy Julian's stunt work with the tri-colored minis is some of the most peerless and perilous ever achieved on film. Yet, The Italian Job falls short of expectations. It's rather cartoony and often cliche, but nevertheless a lot of fun to watch. It has no staying power, however. Once you've seen it you can vaguely recall the particulars of the plot (which is threadbare at best). Still, it's an intoxicating blend of 1960's super kitsch and modish glam-bam. Style over substance, though nothing for the heart or mind. Watch it for what it is, because it is infinitely more entertaining than the abysmal Mark Walberg/Edward Norton remake.

This 40th Anniversary transfer is region free (thank you, Paramount) and yielding an exquisite image and phenomenal sound.

The cast is perfect. Who else but Michael Caine should be Charlie Croker?  Can anyone really even assume Mr Bridger's role but Nol Coward.

It's escapism!  One has to keep in mind this when watching!  It's a good romp!

And the theme song at the end of the film is so appropriate:  "" Get A Bloomin' Move On""!

Interesting tidbit is the then owner of ""Mini"" cars refused to provide the cars without charge.  Inversely, despite the fact the Italians were the bad guys, Fiat provided all the Italian cars without charge!  Further to this, Italian authorities in Turin refused to close the streets down for filming. The Mafia stepped in and blocked the streets so filming could take place! What a great moment for international relations!  Some great humourous one-liners too, e.g., ""You're only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!""  You have to watch it for context!

And the ending...  well you'll have to watch it.  Also another little tidbit; there was talk of a sequel titled ""The Brazilian Job"". Never got made.

I didn't think Michael Caine could be so mediocre, but a script and supporting cast this poor creates more drag than even he can overcome.

Its principal virtue is that it doesn't take itself at all seriously: we know that Charlie (Michael Caine) and his gang will probably not get away with the money, but it's worthwhile watching the way in which he completes the heist and then tries to get away through the streets of Turin and subsequently through the mountains.  As the Mr. Big behind the whole operation, Noel Coward plays himself; by the late Sixties, he had acquired quasi-cult status, reveling in his reputation.  This is precisely the kind of character he plays in the film.  In historical terms, Peter Collinson's film is an advertisement for the Swinging Sixties, with Britain at the center of new movements in fashion and/or coolness.  The iconic Minis - used by the gang to complete their escape - are frequently shown in close-up escaping from the more cumbersome Italian police vehicles.  On the soundtrack, the famous theme celebrating ""The Self Preservation Society"" attests to the virtues of capitalism and individual effort.

Noel Coward as the criminal mastermind, Benny Hill as a computer whiz, would you believe and Michael Caine at the peak of his form. A fabulous caper movie with terrific set pieces, a fantastic car romp, an amazing advertisement for the original Mini. Did you know that Mini makers BMC weren't interested ? and the Italians happily offered Fiats for these scenes but the producers wanted British cars and the Mini's were immortalised. And the film's ending is one of the most inspired pieces of (forgive me) cliff hanging that has ever been put on film.

From the Lamborghini Miura racing through the Alps, to Michael Caine in the Aston DB5 to the 3 mini coopers that end up starring in the movie.

Michael Caine is great as the leader of a band of crooks as they pull off an impossible feat using a unique and clever approach.  Plot twists arise as the crew finds itself between two powerful criminal elements, each wanting their piece of the operation.  This movie can pull you in and hold your attention without blowing up everything in sight and stacking up a huge body count.

This movie is a great disappointment.  The story line is plain and thin, and the characters in place to develop and carry the weak plot fall short.  Michael Caine, who I appreciate in so many other of his works, is unremarkable as leader of a heist.  He does not exude the qualities of authority or cleverness one would associate with a criminal mastermind.  The redeeming part of the movie is the car chase, which is more humorous than exciting, and the ending is so ridiculous that one wonders who was in charge of the disconnected screenplay.  If you are a fan of this film, then I would highly recommend this Blue-ray version, as the audio and video quality is unsurpassed...however, the movie stinks.",1362355200,,857,4.718120805369128

Wow serves the purpose of reacting to the intricacies of the dynamics of his scheme. And someone had gone as far as inventing a guide to the most original and bizarre alternate routes through and around the city of Turin. Michael Caine, as ever, carries off his facility to portray a lovable rogue; and who could not adore Benny Hill being Benny Hill?
Of course, Noel Coward adds a most British counterbalance to the visual, as well as that matchless English penchant for absurdity.
Perhaps the many elaborate heist stories, both earlier and later, may slightly dull the novelty of the general theme, and despite the discontinuities in the production, director Peter Collinson managed to get a great deal from his cast and to come out with what is arguably not a classic, but at least 99 minutes of G-rated fun.",1359849600,,963,4.878048780487805

'The Italian Job' (1969) is restored in amazing detail, showcasing exquisite location photography throughout numerous countrysides and cityscapes in England, Ireland and Italy, as well as some equally impressive interiors and stunt-driving footage.  And if that isn't motivation enough, this release also includes a new, informative commentary track with original screenwriter Kenneth Martin and a thoroughly revamped making-of documentary (that, irrespective of the PAL warning in the product specs above, is viewable on U.S. devices), in addition to commentary with producer Michael Deely, a deleted scene and other extras that can be found on the 2003 Paramount DVD.  TIJ may not be the greatest comedy/caper picture of all time, but it's a fun, smart and handsome production with a host of superb British character actors (and, of course, the impeccable Michael Caine) here likely looking and sounding as fine as it ever will.

477324,1,6302491940,"I bought this DVD used a few months ago, I liked the 2003 version a lot and the DVD cover of this original version looked nice. The movie open with a red Lamborghini Miura who is running on a beautiful scenic road with entertaining music playing... until it hit a bulldozer parked on the middle of the road and explode, supposedly killing the likeable driver, and then ceremonially dumped off the cliff. Flowers are even thrown in the river. A similar thing happen in the 1979 Blake Edward's movie ""10"" where George Webber's yellow Rolls-Royce hit a police car, but apparently suffer only minor damages even if he use another car for the rest of the movie. I had seen the excellent movie ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"" a few years ago before seeing this one, so I have an excellent unadulterated opinion of Micheal Caine. The story didn't make any sense to me who was expecting a serious movie, I had to see it a second time to really understand they were intentionally making fun of him, like putting classy classical music when he act like a slob... I figure they told him they were filming a comedy...  Michael Caine's career, who look helpless and wear a dark blue suit for most scenes, apparently never recovered having for done that movie... There's also 3 making-of documentaries made recently on the DVD, the persons interviewed seem quite overwhelmed by what happened and seem to put the responsibility of the whole project to one of the producer... I can't understand why someone would want to do something like that to a excellent actor who didn't do anything to him... It should also be noted that this is the last movie in which the famous English playwright Noel Coward appear, he died of a heart attack in 1973... It may be unrelated, but after a very successful start in the 60s the Lamborghini carmaker was on the brink of bankruptcy when Ferrucio Lamborghini sold it in 1972, his financial troubles came when the South African and Bolivian government cancelled their orders of tractors who had already been manufactured in 1971... I'm not recommending this movie at all, it's a waste of time even when seen just out of curiosity, in fact the DVD is apparently out of print...

477333,4,6302491940,"Another in a long line of English caper films, The Italian Job (1969), directed by Peter Collinson, is a classic example in the genre.  With a mostly British cast, headed by lovable bad boy Michael Caine (The Ipcress File), the film follows the adventures of a criminal gang, engaged in a bold robbery attempt, executed with precision, while gloriously waving the Union Jack in the face of the opposition.

Charlie Croker (Caine) is just out of prison, when he receives information about a robbery scheme, from his friend Roger Beckerman (Rossano Brazzi), who has just been killed in Italy, by the Mafia.  Beckerman's plan, involves stealing a delivery of gold en route to the Fiat plant in Turin, Italy.  The idea is to utilize the city's traffic control system to create gridlock, to enable the thieves to escape.  With most of the plan outlined, Croker needs to work out the details, find a crew, and get financial backing.  For the later, he turns to Mr. Bridger (Noel Coward), who although behind bars in one of her Majesty's prisons, is still the man in charge.  Although initially resistant, seeing that it would be a huge boost for British morale, Bridger greenlights the Italian Job.

With support of girlfriend Lorna (Margaret Blye), Croker gathers materials, and puts his group together, including math whiz Professor Simon Peach (Benny Hill).  The group arrives in Italy, but experiences car damage, and encounter a major roadblock from the Mafia.  Undaunted, the Brits continue as planned, infiltrating Milan's traffic control center, and executing their plan to near perfection.

The Italian Job is probably most known for the mad driving of a set of red, white, and blue mini Coopers, used to transport the stolen gold.  Maneuvering through the streets, sewers and sidewalks of Milan, the three minis blaze through all manner of alternate routes.  With world renowned Remy Julienne, and his driving team behind the wheel, the film features an impressive, and light hearted display of driving skill.  As the mission nears completion, Quincy Jones's soundtrack builds and elevates to celebratory levels, with Michael Caine leading the bawdy singing.  Making their escape in a bus, collecting the gold, and recklessly tossing the mini's down the side of a mountain, the group's hubris goes a little too far, and the film ends memorably in a literal cliffhanger, for the self-preservation society.

Producer Michael Deeley, came up with the unusual ending, and had a resolution in mind for a sequel, which never came to be.  The point of the film was to showcase the brazen execution by Croker's team, and to have ripping good time in the process.  In that, The Italian Job was an uproarious success.  Caine and his boys exercise some restraint, but they certainly push very hard to hold up the British end.  Back in England, those behind bars offer a glorious salute to Mr. Bridger and his boys, for pulling off the outrageous heist.

The enhanced version looks and sound great.  The cinematography in Milan and the Italian mountains is often delightful.  Extras include a commentary track by producer Michael Deeley, and author Matthew Field.  It's a little dry, but is still informative.  There are also some well produced making of featurettes, but unfortunately there is no contribution from the iconic Michael Caine.",1273968000,,3333,5.038321167883212

Rather than rattle us, scare us, thrill us, it charms us, just about effortlessly, through a perfect combination of cast, script, music, and direction. Caine is terrific as heist head man Charlie Kroeger, but the greatest pleasure comes from Coward, playing a behind-bars king of Anglo-Saxon crime with a fixation on The Queen. In a small part, Benny Hill is a delight. The chase scenes are filmed not from the cars' bumpers, but from a graceful distance, and Jones's music is a deliciously light accompaniment to the playful Mini Cooper sequences that benefit as much from Turin's scenery as from unexpected twists and turns--across a weir, swinging through a sewer pipe.

We all know ""The Italian Job"" is a Sixties classic, but what you don't know is that this 40th Anniversary reissue of it (issued 15 June 2009 in the UK) is simply off the charts good...

First up is the print - which is GLORIOUS - as pristine as you could hope for and a joy from start to finish. And although it doesn't state it on the outer box, this is the fully restored British Film Institute version, which has been cleaned up frame-by-frame (and those clean shots are used in the ""Making Of"" extras too). One of those features is the 30th Anniversary reissue trailer from 10 years ago, which uses the famous ""...doors off..."" van sequence. Untouched - it's covered in scratches and has no definition whatsoever - it allows you see what the film stock did look like as opposed to how beautiful it looks now after restoration.

There are so many scenes that now stand out - as Matt Monro's cheesy song ""On Days Like These"" plays and the car drives through the Alps in the opening credits - when Charlie comes out of prison as he walks through the gates and Maggie Blye greets him in a stolen car from the Pakistani Embassy - when the three Mini Coopers climb the roof of the football stadium with the Italian cops in pursuit - it's just all BEAUTIFUL. The BFI have also done ""Zulu"", ""The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner"" and ""Saturday Night And Sunday Morning"" and this is up to the same stunning standard as they are (see my reviews).

The extras are generous too (nearly two hours worth):
1. Commentary with Screenwriter Tony Kennedy Martin and Author Matthew Field
2. Commentary by Producers Michael Deeley and Author Matthew Field
3. Mini Adventures (in HD)
4. ""Self Preservation Society: The Making Off The Italian Job"" (in HD) - features new interviews with the cast, writers, producers including Michel Caine, Maggie Blye, Troy Kennedy Martin, Michael Deeley, reminiscences on Noel Coward, the Director Peter Collinson, Quincy Jones on the cool score etc...
5. Music Video (in HD)
6. The Deleted Scene With Commentary by Author Matthew Field
7. Theatrical Trailer
8. Re-release Trailer

The casting of course was a mixture of luck, fate and genius - Caine perfect as Charlie Croker the likely lad, Benny Hill as the groping computer boffin, the suave yet deadly Raf Vallone as the Turin Mafia boss and Tony Beckley as the dandily dressed Camp Freddy. But the biggest coup of all was Noel Coward as Mr. Bridger - the master-criminal doing time in her Majesty's prison service. He has tea and scones, worries about the British economy and has his cell plastered with pictures of the Queen. Coward is just priceless as he lords about the decking of the prison block, ""Rule Britannia"" played behind him by a string quartet - it's enough to make you howl with laughter...

You see you forget how funny The Italian Job is - the catty gay tailor saying Charlie's pre-prison clothes could now be part of a museum exhibit, Coward standing beside two prison guards as they hand him his two newspapers and a toilet roll. Prison Governor John Le Mesurier's look of astonishment as Coward complains that `his' toilet has been invaded by Michael Caine (pitching the heist to him) - a man's toilet is his castle... The snooty garage manager played beautifully by John Clive counting the money Michael Caine has just given him for looking after his Aston Martin DB - it's been in his garage for two years while Caine was away in `India'. ""I was shooting tigers old boy..."" Garage owner counting the fifties, "" ...there must have been an awful lot of tigers sir...""

The Turin locations are wonderfully colourful, the mountain scenes as crisp as those in the James Bond reissues and Caine's freckles clearer than ever - all of it - what a peach!

I've reviewed a lot of oldies on the new BLU RAY format of late - some successful, some woeful - but this is up there with the very best. In fact, as a man who adores the medium and believes in its possibilities, I suspect it'll tickle Michael Caine pink that his films ""Zulu"" and ""The Italian Job"" are both going a long way towards establishing BLU RAY as `the' format to restore old movies to and preserve them properly. Onwards to David Lean boys...

As you can tell - and if you'll forgive the pun - I was blown away.

The Caine film is all live action, full of suspense and hugely funny.  Coward as the English mob boss is iconic. And it ends ambiguously!

477402,5,6302491940,"This is a classic British comedy from the time when Alec Guiness, Michael Caine, Peter Sellers and other British comic actors (as differentiated from comedians) ruled the roost.

  The story is simple. Michael Caine is released from jail. A colleague of is murdered in Italy and his not-terribly-grieving widow brings Caine a message - on film, no less. The sight of Michael Caine sitting next to a film projector watching the outline of the planned heist is hilarious in this day of digital cameras and video iPods.

  The story involves Caine getting the permission and assistance of Mr. Bridger, a crime boss who leads a life of luxury behind the walls, recruiting a gang and making arrangements to steal a $ 4-million dollar gold shipment in Turin, Italy. (Four million sounds so small these days, doesn't it?)

  The story, frankly, is very thin. This is comedy, not drama. The real pleasure comes in the execution of the heist. A rogue ""computer expert"" (a hilarious Benny Hill doing his usual schtick) substitutes a tape - yes, a tape - at the traffic control center, which in turn sets off a massive traffic jam.

  The armored convoy carrying the gold is trapped in the midst of this jam and the rest of the film is occupied with the getaway. The getaway features a classic, very funny and very long car chase. Again, this is a comedy, not drama and almost cartoon-like . . . and great fun.

  The ending comes as a bit of a surprise and leaves the audience hanging, so to speak.

  All in all, a fun film. Funny almost as much for how dated it seems as it is for the humor of it. A fun way to idle away 90 or so minutes while looking back at life in a much simpler time when moviemakers didn't take themselves so seriously.

477409,3,6302491940,"I saw the 2003 remake of The Italian Job before I saw the 1969 version.  The chief difference between the films is that the first film is a comedy while the second is meant as an action-drama.  The first Italian Job is filled with a large number of gang members about whom we know nothing in the film concentrating on the main players - Michael Caine and Noel Coward.  With the 2003 version we get to know each team member and their specialty and a lot of the fun are the different likes/dislikes Charlie's team and how they interact with each other.  Benny Hill, as the computer expert, in the first Italian Job is more interested in fat women than turning traffic control in Turin upside down; his role has no real humor and is too small to be of any consequence.

Michael Caine makes a good Charlie but he is also not the brains behind the operation: Rossano Brazzi (who is done in by the Mafia at the opening) has planned the job and although the Mafia boss (played by Raf Valone) is threatening he is inconsequential during the heist when he could pop up as a surprise for Charlie and the gang.  The 2003 Italian Job keeps you on the edge until the very end. The chase in the 1969 film is good but it is hardly the thrilling ride in the 2003 film where Charlie and company are seriously challenged; the police in the first film are bumbling at best.

Sadly, I did not find much of interest in the first Italian Job and can only recommend the film for Michael Caine's performance.  The film is a bit slow in starting, a little vague about the characters and motives with a decent car chase.",1192060800,9,1594,4.343434343434343

But I was soon swept up in the spirit of the armored car robbery caper he orchestrates. And even though I'm usually bored by car chases, I found this movie's get-away sequence to be ingenious and almost thrilling. It's off and running through impossibly narrow archways, down steep staircases, over bridges, with one literal cliffhanger along the way. A great music score adds to the bounce and jounce of every hurdle that's overcome.

As an additional bonus for foreign car buffs, the DVD includes an out-take sequence with the robbers' cars and the police cars doing an extended, elaborately choreographed minuet in a marbled ballroom. The director rightly decided that this surreal episode didn't fit in with his generally realistic picture. But it's good that the dance was saved.

The DVD bonus materials are overall as interesting as the picture itself. The director's commentary is especially worthwhile, because he recorded it relatively recently, so he was able to reflect backwards and forwards over each actor's career. You get to hear ""whatever became of..."" Everyone knows what Michael Caine has been doing. But Peter Collinson recaps the careers of Noel Coward, Raf Vallone, Benny Hill, and others who also star in the movie.

This director commentary is like falling into convivial conversation with a master filmmaker. I only disagreed with one opinion he had about his finished picture. He said he didn't like the way Benny Hill's infatuation with LARGE women had been scripted. I think Collinson felt the character's on-screen enthusiasm, with Hill frequently managing to bury himself in some woman's abundance, was in bad taste.

But I personally found Hill's irrepressible enthusiasm rather appealing. It's as irresistible as this movie itself.  I didn't see the recent re-make of ""The Italian Job,"" but I have a hunch this original is the version to get.",1181606400,3,2080,5.2342342342342345

The almost nonexistent score consists of a few random notes and a very boring refrain near the end of the movie.

Anyway, this is a ludicrous, ridiculous film, made up of a lot of little disconnected sketches which don't really add up to a full-scale drawing. If there is a theme or a moral, it seems to be that whatever kind of car you drive, you'll be seeing it coming down the mountain, sooner or later. The camera just loved those spinning, crashing, blazing cars, and couldn't take its eye off them. Irene Handl was a natural genius; and I believe she was just like that in real life. Benny Hill was a bit wasted. Truly, nothing much made much sense in this story. Characters came and went, popped up improbably all over the place. Like Caine in the prison toilet, or Coward in Harley Street. And what about that Fred Emney? A genuine one-off character. Pythonesque, is what I say.

477479,5,6302491940,"The 60's Italian Job is well known to British audiences, for whom the movie is as regular a fixture of Christmas television scheduling as James Bond films, The Great Escape and the Queen's speech.  Negative reviews by US viewers are as much a result of the lack of a culture context and unfamiliarity with many of the ensemble cast.  The film has aged well and provides an amusing, if rather rose-tinted, snapshot of 60's British culture.

The cast includes Noel Coward as Mr Bridger, the criminal mastermind, and Michael Caine as the foppish Charlie Croker.  British audiences will recognise a host of well known actors in cameo roles, including Benny Hill and John Le Mesurier.

The stars of the film though are undoubtedly the cars.  Amusingly, the array of 60's supercars including a Lamborghini Muira, E-Type Jaguars and Charlie's Aston Martin are overshadowing by the three Mini Coopers which lead the Italian police on an amazing car chase through Turin.  Remy Julienne and his stunt driving team produced one of the most amazing and well known, at least to British audiences, car chases on film.  Arguably it still rates as one of the best car chase sequences and all the more so because the stunts were actually filmed on location in Turin (and Coventry in the case of the sewer scenes) and in cars with minimal modifications.

There are many memorable moments in the movie beyond the Mini Cooper sequence.  Caine's 'blow the doors off', Benny Hill's larger lady obsessed Professor Peach on the tram in Turin and the 'hanging' ending stick out in my mind.

The extra features on the DVD are good but not truly outstanding.  The 'Making Of' documentary provides a number of interesting insights into the movie.  The commentary overlay track is a little stilted but worth a listen.  There is only really one deleted scene, the rather amazing 'Blue Danube' car ballet on ice.

In summary, this is a true British classic with a great cast, score and storyline.  A nice snapshot of 60's London, a fantastic (at least for UK audiences) cast and the superb car chase scene make this one to buy.  The Hollywood remake, whilst not a bad movie in its own right, shares only the title, a storyline based on a gold heist and the updated BMW Mini with the original.

Some reviewers complain that it is dated, well that because it is - get over it this and enjoy a 60's romp with Michael Caine in full Alfie mode. This is not a film for those looking for social messages, deep meaning or plot cohesion, but one for those appreciative of British humor, ingenious car chases and who do not get hung up over the (nowadays) politically incorrect cultural stereotypes.

Most of the dialogue is just characters endlessly explaining the plot, which still makes little sense despite all this exposition.

The direction is badly paced and unfocused and the actors are eithed adrift or worse, like the talentless girl who plays Caine's girlfriend and sounds like she's reading her lines off cuecards while stoned. Yes she's gorgeous, but couldn't they have found a girl who could look good and also believably portray a human being.

Looking for a good heist movie. Ignore the tripe coming out of Hollywood today, and go for the originals....""The Italian Job"" and ""Ocean's 11"". Now THAT'S entertainment.",1112832000,8,549,5.088888888888889
477493,4,6302491940,"A classic film genre that hasn't seen much action in the past few decades is the heist film. The re-imagining of OCEAN'S 11 did a nice job as did the re-imagining of THE ITALIAN JOB. Unfortunately, even those both of those movies had some great elements, neither one was original enough to even come up with their own title.

The original THE ITALIAN JOB, on the other hand, was made during an era when movies still reeked of originality.  In the film, Charlie Croker (Michael Caine) is released from prison after having served his time. He receives an interesting message from a close friend of his. His friend was in the process of steeling over 4 million dollars in gold right under the noses of the Italian mafia. Unfortunately, the mafia found out about the gig and had him killed. Before he was killed, he had set a plan in motion so that Charlie could take over the operation.

Charlie agrees to do the job, but he needs some serious financing. So, Charlie breaks into the prison to visit Mr. Bridger (Noel Coward), one of the most wealthy and well-respected crooks in England. At first Bridger dismisses Charlie's request and has some of his goons pay him a visit. Then he finds out exactly how much is at stake and who they will be stealing the money from. He has a change of heart and give Charlie the money he needs. From there it's one misadventure and adventure after another leading from England to Italy, past mafia goons, to the World Cup, and over some mountains involving $4 million dollars in gold bars and three red, white, and blue Mini-Coopers.

The casting and acting in THE ITALIAN JOB is some of the most original in Hollywood history. Michael Caine was not yet a huge star, but had just finished filming ALFIE when he was cast in THE ITALIAN JOB. His role as Charlie Croker made him an international movie sensation. Noel Coward was specially picked by director Peter Collinson because of Coward's generosity to Collinson in his youth. The studio had originally wanted Nicol Williamson, but Collinson swore by Coward. Coward's prescence as the lordly Mr. Bridger added a touch of class to the movie. Then there's Benny Hill, playing the large women loving Professor Simon Peach. The Benny Hill show had yet to be broadcast, but even in the supporting role of Professor Peach, Hill illustrates his connection to bawdiness.

The movie includes a famous song entitled ""The Self Preservation Society"" which, in large part because of this movie, has become a favorite song played in English football (soccer) matches. Besides that famous song, there's also several great pieces of dialogue including Michael Caine's line, ""You're only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!"" which was voted the most memorable film line of all time in a 2003 movie poll.

The final scene in THE ITALIAN JOB remains as one of the most memorable, yet most frustrating in all of movie history. The film ends without any resolve because the studio had hoped to make a sequel, but the sequel never came.  It's a dirty shame, really, because this is one movie that a sequel would have added something to the original.

The DVD includes the famous deleting ""walzing Minis"" scene, a commentary track, the original trailers, and a documentary. The commentary track is rather interesting to listen along with, but the documentary (chopped into three parts) is incredibly boring!",1111708800,9,3372,4.791738382099828

477497,4,6302491940,"It is true that original ideas in Hollywood are even rarer than lasting show-biz marriages, but the remake of the '60's British classic ""The Italian Job"" stands out as the glaring example of the industry trying to pass off flash and flair in the guise of eye-candy actors and high-tech special effects in place of the human elements of acting chemistry and film craftsmanship.

The 1969 version of ""The Italian Job"" succeeded on so many levels; it was a fantastic film that was well-indicative of its time (the afterglow of the sexual revolution as well as the London fashion boom seen recently only on a second-hand basis from the Austin Powers movies in addition to Ing-er-lund's winning of the 1966 World Cup, British hipsters could actually display the Union Jack and sing ""Rule, Britannia"", unthinkable for the UK apologists of today) as well as a crime caper with a decidely different twist to the wit of say, the Rat Pack version of ""Ocean's 11"".  And the distinctly European take on the car chase already iconocized in Steve McQueen's ""Bullitt"" demonstrated by the use of the ORIGINAL bumper-to-bumper crumple zoned Mini Coopers as opposed to the full-throated Detoit muscle flexed by ""Bullitt""'s Dodge Charger and Ford Mustang is ably accentuated by some of the best stunt driving seen in a generation among some of the most beautifully picturesque backdrops in the world.

This is an admittedly dated, though terrifically quirky and extremely fun movie to watch.  It's a fine example of why Michael Caine was one of the most charming actors of his generation and another example of what a movie can be when given over to human inspiration and creativity as opposed to a cookie-cutter script handed over to an overzealous special effects department.  Rent the Wahlberg/Theron/Norton remake if you must; it's a good enough example of the quick fix mentality that prevents anything new and original from succeeding in Hollywood today.

Michael Cane's Charlie character is an artist working effortlessly in aloof charm. He's the kind confident character you'll admire  like Murphy in CUCKOO'S NEST in spite of the obvious reasons not to. There is seductive music and beautiful scenery and plenty of restrained continental humor.
I have no interest in cars, but even I admitt the classic models of the time featured here are beautiful and add to the ambiance of elegance infusing the scenes .
The chase is more clever than thrilling although the site of four cars performing on the top of a tall rounded building still makes me shake my head when I see it thinking they must have been mad. Remember, no remote control models or studio set ups were used here.  That car jumping from roof to roof is real.
Don't come here looking for an action adventure though - it's more adult than that albeit geared for adults of another generation.

477515,4,6302491940,"This isn't *quite* the ultimate ""chase"" film -- that would be either ""Vanishing Point"" (for a relatively serious film) or ""The Junkman"" (for a comedy), but it's one of the better-acted.
Michael Caine and Noel Coward anchor the comedy nicely -- Coward's ""Mr Bridger"", the undisputed head of the British underworld, ruling crime with an iron hand from a comfortable cell in a pirson where the warders and Governor act as his personalk service staff, is a wonderful conceit.  Caine's Charlie Croker, very much the smooth fast-talking all-round crook of working-class origins, plays off Bridger wonderfully to get permission to do the job, to the point of appealing to Bridger's obsessive patriotism (God *is* an Englishman) by pointing out that stealing four million dollars in Italy will help the balance of trade.
Roughly half the film or a bit more is devoted to getting the gang together (including hiring a computer expert [played by Benny Hill] who may be the single most over-the-top element in a film that hovers at ot near that metaphorical ""top"" for most of its unning time.)
A recent poll in Britain voted the line ""You were just supposed to blow the bloody *doors* off!"" as the best all-time movie line (i prefer the similarly-inspired ""Think you used enough dynamite, Butch?"", but won't quibble); it's certainly appropriate...
The gang have to do the job in spite of the Mafia (personified by Raf Vallone) -- after, all, this is their home turf and the Brits are invaders -- and this conflict leads to the horrific destruction of some simply lovely Sixties high-performance cars on a mountain road -- the punchline to the opening credit sequence is particularly painful, because so unexpeced.
Use of the original Mini Coopers[1] as the getaway cars is inspired; their small size, excellent handling, good turn of speed and the fact that they were currently being built under license by an Italian firm based in Turin, the setting of the heist, all contribute to the fun of the chase.  And the efforts of Remy Julienne and his stunt team certainly don't hurt; the knowledge that all of these stunts were done for real, not by computer imagery, is impressive.
By 1969 the Mini in all its variants was history in the US, and though it continued in production worldwide for thirty years more, the American market diodn' reward the film-makers as well as they might have hoped, and the sort-of-planned sequel in which we see how Charlie and Co get out of the (literal) cliffhanger that ends this film was never made.
Since Amazon is offerenig a two-fer of this DVD and the actually-not-bad (if not great) exercise in BMW product-placement ""remake"" with Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron, one might do worse than to get both of them and spend an otherwise-unoccupied afternoon comparing them, spoting the little grace-note references to the original inserted into the ""remake""'s unrelated plot.  (Certainly a more-rewarding afternoon than one would have doing the same with the badly-acted-but-incredible-chase original ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" and the execrable 2000 ""remake""...)
The Bottom Line: The better of the two ""Italian Jobs"" (not surprisingly).
[1] History: The Cooper and Cooper ""S"" were high-performance variants of a small car produced by British Motors under the Morris and Ausin names; not all Minis were Coopers.  The ""S"" used a larger, more powerful engine, was banned for emissions rerasons in the US in 1966, the car itself was unable to pass crash-test standards in 1967 and so disappeared from this country.
Production continued in England (and in Italy under license, which leads to a gag in the original film) for many years after that, but was finally discontinued.
The Mini was the first of the ""two-box"" subcompacts with transverse engine and front-wheel drive, the direct ancestor conceptually of the VW Rabbit, Honda Civic and so on; none of them, however, used anything like its unique ""Hydrolastic"" suspension, which was completely hydraulic, with no springs or conventional shock absorbers.
It was smaller than those, at somewhere between 1500 and 1800 pounds and using ten-inch wheels.
BMW bought the name, and has recently brought out the car they call a ""Mini Cooper"", much the same shape, but much bigger and more luxurious -- the BMW ""Cooper"" weighs almost 3000 pounds and uses wheels as large as fifteen inches.
Those of us who cherish the original Mini in all its variants are not decieved...",1073779200,11,4430,5.014945652173913
477516,3,6302491940,"""The Italian Job"" is another movie that begins with a lot of promise and dwindles as the clock rolls on-fortunately capped at 90 minutes or so.  The opening sequence, as the credits roll, is a memorable scene that caught me completely off guard.  I enjoyed the young Michael Caine's acting.  His charm and personality definitely help carry the film throughout its length.  The quirky setup of the film is quite inventive, including a job that is not planned from the ground up, but rather inherited after the death of its mastermind.  The film itself does not focus upon the heist; rather, it chooses to direct its attention to the getaway.  This makes up the extended action sequence of the film, starring the little minis.  The chase sequence is quite enjoyable to watch and I waited the entire movie to see it.  I particularly liked the inventive end to the chase sequence and the comedy that is woven into the driving.
""The Italian Job"" does not take itself seriously, and neither do I.  The ending, as the documentary implies, is the ultimate cliffhanger.  I wasn't sure what to make of it-or whether or not I enjoyed it.  I can say that I appreciated its originality and I'm glad the film did not descend into a classic heist ending with everyone patting each other on the back.  You'll have to watch it for yourself to decide.

Anyway, Roger Beckerman, a brilliant thief, is murdered because he had masterminded a potential heist to take place in Turin, Italy, involving millions of dollars of Chinese gold bullion. Beckerman leaves a tape for Charlie Croker, who has just been released from a British prison. The video tape, to be viewed in the event of Beckerman's death, explains the entire caper and offers Charlie the opportunity to do the job. Charlie gets the funding for the project from Mr. Bridger, played by a wonderfully comic Noel Coward. Bridger is an inmate of the prison where Charlie had spent the last few years and he rules the UK underworld like a king, from his jail cell, with guards and inmates paying him homage. Croker fights off the advances of gorgeous blondes with one hand while he uses the other to whip into shape his motley crew of screwball bandits.
The dialogue is hilarious at times, especially when the team of thieves, who seem to have a collective IQ of 75, go at each other like recalcitrant adolescent schoolboys. Croker who occasionally is forced to step out of his role as master-thief to play schoolmaster, yells at his men during a particularly delicate operation, ""Get yourselves sorted out and shut-up! No one talks anymore except me!"" During a meeting with the Mafia leader who threatens to kill Croker and his men if they pull-off the job, Charlie responds, ""You will be making a grave error if you kill us. There are one-quarter million Italians in Britain and they will be made to suffer. Every restaurant, cafe, ice cream parlor, gambling den and nightclub in London, Liverpool and Glasgow will be smashed. Mr. Bridger will drive them into the sea!""
This film is pure fun with the mother of all car chases as the grand finale. Not to be missed!

477548,4,6302491940,"It seems that good movies inspire remakes. As to whether they are ""inspired"" remakes is always open to question. Both versions of The Italian Job have unique features that make them interesting but for sheer acting chops and fun (with the exception of Ed Norton in the remake who seems like he's trapped in a film he doesn't like), 1969's The Italian Job is my personal pick of the two. Mark Wahlberg can't hold a candle (and isn't much of an actor frankly)to Michael Caine in the original film.
There's almost as many things that make this classic film tick as there are seconds on a clock. The plot focuses more on the getaway than the caper. This unique twist turned the formular on its head. The terrific cast (including the late Noel Coward in his last screen appearence and, of all people, Benny Hill!)features the marvelous Michael Caine in the lead. He gives a great performance and helps the ensemble rise to the occasion.
The late Peter Collinson directs with energy and wit bringing to life what could have been, despite its plot twists, a routine film. Collinson is something of a cult director who died relatively young before he could fulfill his full promise as a director. I'd also recommend his cult classic psychological thriller Straight On Till Morning which became available last year on DVD. While it's hampered by some mid-70's editing and visual conventions, Morning more than holds its own with the explotiation films of the time.
Complimenting the film is a commentary track which features the film's original producer as well as a number of nice extras. It's great to also have this minor classic finally restored to its proper aspect ratio. The DVD transfer is pretty good and while the quality of the print varies a bit, it's really good on the whole.",1065744000,6,1780,4.763754045307444

Michael Caine at his ultimate ""Cockney"" best and a cast assembled to perfection. Benny Hill as the technical genious behind the gold plot, with his love for ""BIG"" women, was a classic role for this much missed comic master.

477553,5,6302491940,"The Caper genre has been around for a long time but isn't seen all that much these days or, in my mind, done as well. The latest, of course, was the REMAKE of ""Ocean's Eleven"" and the REMAKE of ""The Thomas Crown Affair"", both not as well done as the originals. And, then, there is the remake of ""The Italian Job"".

However, for what it is, this original version is still a very fun film and is definately one of the all-time Car Buff favorites because of the Minis and, unlike some, Car Buffs enjoy ALL the Mini scenes, especially the practice sessions (much more fun than the remake's). The ending theme song is still hugely popular with British car lovers.

By today's standards the original ""The Italian Job"" may seem lame to the younger crowd since there are no hotshot special effects...or loads of dead bodies. And English humor is, well, different than Americans'.  On the other hand, all the car stunts are real and fun and the cast does not take themselves too seriously. The movie isn't as slick as the new version with Mark W., but I still like it more. It is a very 60s movie.

For one thing, there is more to the getaway than the remake. However, just like the remake, the crew is stealing money from the Mafia, but, unlike the remake, the ending isn't as tidy and happy for the robbers. Funny as can be, but not exactly happy. It's a real cliff hanger.

This movie is also timely right now since BMW has introduced the new retro designed Rover MINI to the U.S. market. And, as a matter of information, used/restored ""old"" Minis are still being imported to the U. S. in decent numbers by private individuals. I've heard that there are an estimated 10,000 classic Minis still in the U.S. I belong to a Mini club in Texas with well over 100 members. Many, like myself, own more than one and many also own the new BMW MINI.

The only odd aspect about this movie is why it took so long to finally be offered on tape and then, after a couple of years, get down to such a great price since Michael Caine starred in it. I can remember waiting and waiting for this movie to be released on VHS.  Something along the lines of the wait for ""LeMans"". And, then, it wasn't cheap.

477576,5,6302491940,"The Italian Job is one of the most distinctive comedy films in British Cinema History, arriving on the scene as the 1960s were coming to a close and instilling a bright, colourful, energetic outlook onto the British public that was revolutionary at the time as the 'New Wave' cinema era began.
Relatively new at the time, Michael Caine took on the part of Charlie Croker, a criminal who has been released from jail and comes across a new job... a job in Italy.  But first he has to get the funding, and turns to Criminal Mastermind and Big Man, Mr Bridger, played by Noel Coward who adds a veteran aspect to the cast of actors; Even a young Robert Powell ('The Detectives') makes an appearance.  Reluctant at first, Mr Bridger gives the reins to Croker and everything goes to plan... although the training is a bit on the unsuccessful side!  They travel to Italy, run into the mafia, who aren't best pleased of their intentions and then proceed to bring the town of Turin to a standstill; With the help of Prof. Simon Peach, Benny Hill, who further establishes the film's comedic value!  The job is done, and the escape begins, with some breathtaking and enormous action chase sequences, as the minis come into play.  But things go sorely wrong and the boys find themselves in a predicament.... what will they do...
The film had huge support from Remy Julienne's Stunt Team and Giovanni Agnelli, the Fiat Giant, who released the Fiat town of Turin into the hands of the production team for a day of madness.
Having originally had a different ending to the film, of the team driving off into sunset, one of the producers came up with the current closure which leaves the film on a cliff-hanger, so to speak; which wasn't supported by the entire crew, but has proved to be a winner.  No other film has had such a open and inventive ending as The Italian Job.
The film is a perfect example of British inspiration which lead to one of the most influential comedy capers of all time.  To me, the film truly personified the hopes and dreams that the 1960s stood for... a new Britain.  I will never forget sneaking down very early on Christmas Day, many years ago to watch the cheeky film... it's a feel-good film with some of the best lines in history.  You won't be disappointed in the least, with the action, acting or even story.",991440000,5,2326,4.5587529976019185
477577,5,6302491940,"This is the movie that defined the word, 'Classic'.
Michael Caine plays Charlie who's just been released from prison. Rather than trying to keep on the straight and narrow, he immediately embarks on trying to steal gold bullion from the Italian's.  He gets the backing of Mr. Bridger, London's head of crime, who's in prison himself.
To help him carry out the plan, he gathers together an array of colourful people including Benny Hill as the clever professor who has a penchant for big women.
Add to the mix three Mini Cooper's as the unlikely get away cars and you're in for a fun filled, action packed film that sees Charlie and his gang trying to outrun both the police and the Mafia.
The build up to the heist is interesting and funny but the unique get away at the end is the scene stealer.  Through underground sewers and subways, down church steps, through rivers and up to the very rooftops, it's gripping and highly entertaining.  I think anyone that watches the film will just yearn to have a Mini Cooper afterwards.
Of course, the cliff hanger of an ending just fits so perfectly too.
To add; I also think the soundtrack is great and the film produced one of the most, if not THE, memorable quote of all time from Michael Caine when he sees the truck explode into thousands of pieces during a practice run and then turns to the unfortunate explosives 'expert' and says, ""You're only supposed to blow the bloody doors off.""
Mr. Caine has said that he still has people come up to him in the street and say that to him, even now!
To conlcude, The Italian Job is very patriotic, even the cars are red, white and blue, and I think it's the masterpiece for all British classic's.

Alas, the  chase scene is the crescendo to which the film builds and it dissapoints. It seems there is a heavy Benny Hill influence in the chase, perhaps he wrote it.
