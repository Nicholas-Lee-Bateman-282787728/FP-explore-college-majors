8329341,4,B001O4C6QM,"Another rare glimpse into television's earliest days. Lights out was a program originally broadcast on radio, that carried over onto television, with mixed results. Light's Out didn't last on television, as it was more of a program that lent itself to the radio audience, relying on your imagination, rather than visual presentation. Still worth a look.",1448928000,,353,5.321428571428571
8329342,3,B001O4C6QM,"I normally don't list comments about Amazon purchases, but I thought in this case I would.

I bought several Alpha discs lately (Harlem features and Lights Out episodes), and about half of them were actually DVD-R's. This title is one of them. Unfortunately, it was not listed on Amazon this way.

I assume that Alpha is now ""duplicating"" some of their past titles rather than going through the cost of ""replication."" Yet sadly, even some of their packages that contain DVD-R's show the traditional DVD logo.

As for the material itself, it is what you would expect from Alpha (and even has their watermark during beginning and end credits), but I love these offerings from bygone days so much, I chose to acquire this vintage item. The disc plays okay, but of course, as a DVD-R, it won't play in some machines.

(By the way, note for the record that the following Alpha titles I purchased were actual pressed, replicated DVD's: Lights Out, Vol. 6; The Girl from Chicago; Spirit of Youth/Lucky Ghost; Where's My Man To-Nite?/Mystery in Swing; Miracle in Harlem/Ten Minutes to Live; The Bronze Buckaroo/Midnight Shadow.)

Just thought you should be fully informed",1417737600,3,1163,4.913265306122449

8329344,2,B001O4C6QM,"I bought this on the strenghth of the actors: Basil Rathbone and John Carradine in their TV years. The image is of VERY bad quality (be warned!) and the sound isn't better. Sometimes it's so muffled you are left wondering what has been said. For fans of old-school horror spooks it's always nice to find newly unearthed material involving the genre's favorite actors, and Rathbone's performance is especially good here (as a mistreated valet with a revenge). Somehow it's good that we have the possibility of watching such obscure films/TV series of ages ago. On the other hand, the edition on display here is clearly on the cheap side (what ugly DVD boxes, front AND back!), and the image and sound are akin to a souvenir... The episodes and sets are also on the cheap side. At one point, there is a technician crossing the set in the middle of a scene! He gets conscious of his unwanted presence and quickly rushes off the set. Ultimately it's like dreaming of seeing those long-lost episodes rather than actually seeing them! Quite fitting somehow. As to spending money on those, it's certainly not worth it.",1245196800,4,1111,4.761658031088083
