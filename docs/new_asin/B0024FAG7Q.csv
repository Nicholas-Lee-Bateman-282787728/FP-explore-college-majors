3846097,5,B0024FAG7Q,"In the 1940s Rita Hayworth was billed as the Love Goddess, and when Gilda came to the screen, nobody doubted it, the lady is smokin hot, the script was very good for the day, Rita was one of the few glamor/beauty stars that could actually act, and damnd well, Miss Sadie Thompson added to Gilda should convince everyone of that. Rita could also sing and Dance, with a capitol D, Cover Girl is one of the best Musicals ever to come out of Hollywood, and Rita sparkles, not to mention steals the film from Kelly, Silvers and Arden, I saw Salome on the screen, and it's the reason I ordered this set, as I have the previous films already, while she was way to old for the part, the only people who cared were those who dote on accuracy, there isn't a Biblical film out of Hollywood that is accurate, so why there was such a stink about this one I'll never know, my guess is she was to beautiful and dressed too provocatively (after all it was the 1950s, and society was much more up tight than it is today) Tonight and every night is the one I haven't seen yet, so no comment other than if Rita is in it, it's worth watching",1287187200,2,1121,4.21860465116279
3846098,4,B0024FAG7Q,"To whom it may concern:  Yeah, I'm wondering when this set is ever going to be released, too.  I feel that Amazon should look into it.
It disturbs me that the title has been ""out"" for months in its PAL version in Europe (presumably England) and still not released to Amazon customers here.
I have already ordered a copy and paid for it.  It seems strange that so many classic American film releases, on DVD, are available only in a Region 2 format for
Europe (wherever the PAL standard is used) but we can't get the same films here (even though they originally CAME from HERE).  This is a strange releasing
phenomenon in the DVD trade!  Might as well add that even in the proposed American version set of the Rita Hayworth films, many, many potentially interesting
titles from her career, especially from the 1950's through the early 70's, are not available to be viewed in ANY form.  What about ""The Happy Thieves"" with Rex Harrison,
or ""The Wrath of God"" with Mitchum, to name only two? She made over 60 films and very few are available to enjoy today!  The set, when it appears, will include a
few of her more interesting titles, but why don't we have it available when it has been on the market in Europe for the better part of a year (at least).  Well, its an
interesting question.  Amazon, are you listening?",1280707200,6,1314,4.487394957983193
3846099,5,B0024FAG7Q,"The Rita Hayworth Collection includes two of her greatest films: COVER GIRL and GILDA. Both have been previously released on DVD and therefore they can be purchased individually. The other three films are new to DVD...

GILDA (1946) is an excellent Film Noir which co-stars Glenn Ford (The Big Heat, Blackboard Jungle) as one of three members in a torrid love-hate relationship. The incredibly beautiful Rita Hayworth performs two songs, ""Amado Mio"" and ""Put The Blame On Mame"", with perfection. GILDA catapulted Rita Hayworth to legendary, super star status which was so-well deserved. GILDA is one of my favorite movies of all time. Includes audio commentary with Richard Shickel plus featurette: ""Martin Scorsese & Baz Luhrmann On Gilda"" & original theatrical trailer.

COVER GIRL (1944) is a wonderful Technicolor musical with Gene Kelly (An American In Paris, Singin' In The Rain), Phil Silvers (Diamond Horseshoe, TV's Sgt. Bilko) and Eve Arden (Stage Door, Mildred Pierce). This film, simply put, is Rita's best musical. In fact, I would go as far as saying Cover Girl is Columbia's greatest musical. The film has wonderful songs and dance routines which includes Gene Kelly dancing with his alter-ego. The hauntingly beautiful song, Long Ago And Far Away, is featured. Includes featurette: ""Baz Luhrmann On Cover Girl""

TONIGHT AND EVERY NIGHT (1945) is another entertaining Technicolor musical. The setting is Britain during WWII and features a troupe of performers who never miss a show despite bombings and other issues. Rita Hayworth stars with Janet Blair (My Sister Eileen, Fabulous Dorseys) and the lack-luster Lee Bowman (Buck Privates, Cover Girl). Includes featurette: ""Tonight And Every Night"" with Patricia Clarkson & original theatrical trailer

SALOME (1953) is a Technicolor epic which features the seductive ""dance of the seven veils"" which preceeds the beheading of John the Babtist. The impressive cast stars Rita Hayworth, Stewart Granger (King Solomon's Mines, Scaramouche, Prisoner Of Zenda), Charles Laughton (Mutiny On The Bounty, Spartacus, Witness For The Prosecution), Judith Anderson (Laura, And Then There Were None). Includes original theatrical trailer.

MISS SADIE THOMPSON (1953) is a Technicolor, musical/drama re-make of Somerset Maugham's Rain (originally starred Gloria Swanson in 1928 and then by Joan Crawford in 1932) which features Rita Hayworth as a prostitute surrounded by dozens of Marines, including her co-star, Aldo Ray (Battle Cry, Naked And The Dead) and the ultra-conservative reformer, Jose Ferrer (Moulin Rouge, Cyrano De Bergerac). Things heat up fast, but Sadie Thompson is not one to be pushed around. Rita has several songs but two of the better ones include the wistful Blue Pacific Blues and the sizzling, ""The Heat Is On"". This film was originally released theatrically in the 3-D process in 1953. Includes featurette: ""Introducing Miss Sadie Thompson"" with Patricia Clarkson & original theatrical trailer.

Needless to say, this box set is a must to complete any Rita Hayworth collection! All five movies in this set look beautiful.
Gilda shines in glorious black & white and the other four films
are stunning in beautiful Technicolor.

3846117,5,B0024FAG7Q,"Rita Hayworth was at the top of my favorites list and I recall going to the movie theater in my youth to see any movie she was appearing in. She was absolutely beautiful, a fabulous dancer (Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly were amongst her dance partners on film), and for me a very good actress. So to have five of her films in one collection is a fabulous treat!

Pal Joey is not in this collection--but Cover Girl with Gene Kelly is a Technicolor dream, a terrific film. Miss Sadie Thompson with Aldo Ray and Jose Ferrer is, again for me, the best version of the Somerset Maughan story. Rita sizzles, doing a fabulous job of acting. Tonight and Every Night was, for its time, wartime, a nice concept of what was going on oversees and Rita and Janet Blair do a good job with its' story line.

And of course, Rita's greatest fame came with her role in Gilda in which she and Glenn Ford made the movie screens in the forties ablaze! Gilda is so good, much better than she is given credit for being. The first time you see Hayworth is a classic movie moment!

The only film in this collection that is just OK is Salome, although she was gorgeous and was surrounded by the great Charles Laughton and Judith Anderson.

If you are a Rita Hayworth fan (are there people who can't appreciate this most gorgeous femme fatale?), this is a fantastic collection of her films.",1425686400,,1360,4.4063745019920315

Gene Kelly (loaned to FOX just this once) makes Rita's dancing shine in Cover Girl. Gilda, with Glenn Ford, is still among her top dramatic and dancing performances in a kind of ""film noire"".

3846153,5,B0024FAG7Q,"Of the five movies comprising the Films Of Rita Hayworth Collection, four of them are among her best in the course of a career which spanned 37 years.  During her career heyday in the 1940s Hayworth had three sensational box office hits in a row - right at the peak of the World War Two years - - which were a must for this compilation. In fact, Cover Girl (1944) which pairs Hayworth with another dancing powerhouse - Gene Kelly, puts the talents of both stars to great advantage and is one of the most glamorous, gorgeously shot and best remembered musicals of the decade. The basic plot has Hayworth's character moving up to glossy, magazine cover fashion model from vaudeville dancing roots and this picture may be considered the peak of her musical /dancing performances during her long tenure at Columbia Pictures. Following that,Tonight And Every Night (1945) also provides good entertainment value as Hayworth plays a showgirl in London who undergoes typical romantic complications while persevering during the Blitz.
  This collection would scarcely be complete without her signature portrayal as the quintessential femme fatale in the title role of Gilda (1946).  As one of the box sensations of the era, Gilda  is also the ultimate love triangle/exotic nightclub melodrama of the decade which encapsulates the titillating black & white glamour Hollywood filmmakers used to excel at.  The most outstanding aspects of Hayworth's tempestuous performance in this story are her lively black glove striptease (about as racy as it got in the 40s) of ""Put The Blame On Mame"" and the more coolly sensual ""Amado Mio"".  Gilda was also the first  pairing of Hayworth with Glenn  Ford (there would be two other pictures pairing them as Columbia's leading love team). Hayworth also got to star in a cheesy biblical epic of her own... (such stories were a rather prominent part of the 1950s film going experience) in the title role as Salome (1953).
  The new testament schlockfest features a good cast (with Stewart Granger, Charles Laughton, Judith Anderson) who were unfortunately forced to labor through a poor, stilted script which resulted in bad acting for all. At the time Columbia bragged that most of the picture was filmed in authentic ""Holy Land"" locations - - though they could have saved themselves the trouble and extra expense and filmed the whole thing on the outskirts of Palm Springs and no one would have been the wiser!  In any event, the color,costumes and Hayworth's ""Dance Of The Seven Veils"" still make the film worth watching - though one critic of the day asserted (I throw in some giggles and guffaws) that Salome was ""a gross perversion of the bible"" and ""a clumsy attempt to eke sex out of religion."" However, in our time ... pretty tame stuff.  To wrap up the collection, Miss Sadie Thompson (1953) may be the story most relevant to contemporary viewers; when reflecting on the ""culture wars"" of the present. This classic tale of tropical sex and salvation (based on the famous Somerset Maugham short story) had been filmed twice before with Gloria Swanson and Joan Crawford, but Hayworth's version is the most outstanding, providing the strongest interpretation of the role.
  The endless conflicts between hedonism and so-called ""religious values"" are brought to the fore when a stuffed-shirt minister collides with a woman with a supposedly shady past. Sadie stands out as a sobering tale of ""sin"" and ""redemption"" - with a heavy dose of hypocrisy and double-standards thrown into the brew (just think of any religious scandals that are relentless fodder for the present day talk show circuits). In any event, the theme and content are still quite subdued when imagining how the material would likely be handled if filmed for today's jaded audiences.",1405382400,4,3780,4.996815286624204

1.  Gilda:
  Great dramatic performance worthy of an Oscar.  She and Glenn Ford dominate the screen with an historic love/hate relationship.
2.  Tonight and Every Night:  Showcases Rita's dancing as never before.  I had never heard of or seen this movie but was entranced from the beginning to the end....the Blitz in Britain was not much fun but this crew carried on courageously.
3.  Miss Sadie Thompson:  Fun from beginning to end.  Rita and Aldo Ray cavort on an isolated Pacific island whilst Pious Jose Ferrer tries to take away their fun.  Watch for one of the grunts played by Charles Buchinsky.  Small part for the man who would become Charles Bronson
4.  Cover Girl:  Frilly and silly but fun.  Gene Kelly and Rita dance throughout with Rita getting the break that tears them apart as a couple.  Phil Silvers does his Sgt. Bilko impression as their friend.
5.  Salome:  Rita at her sexiest...she virtually glows in this semi-biblical story.  Stewart Granger becomes the focus of her desire toward the end of the movie after all the trials and tribulations of her step-father's (King Herod..Charles Laughton) court.  Her dance before her step-father is legendary.",1388707200,4,1234,5.014851485148514

3846176,3,B0024FAG7Q,"Columbia's Rita Hayworth collection is an attractive package showcasing the actress's versatility as a performer in a quintet of films, three of which haven't got a lot going for them other than her vivacious presence.  Content includes:

'Cover Girl' (1944) - Not being a fan of musicals, I find this to be one of the more palatable entries in the genre, and the stunning Technicolor cinematography is the clincher.  3 1/2 stars.

'Tonight and Every Night' (1945) - Routine wartime singathon appeals strictly to aficionados of this type of fare.  Musical numbers are plentiful, but not particularly memorable.  2 stars.

'Gilda' (1946) - Classic, high-gloss noir is arguably the best of the group, although the individual release from 2000 features the exact same print and has a short documentary attached to it that isn't resurrected here.  The usually interesting Richard Schickel offers rather a weak, meandering monologue as commentary, and doesn't seem even to like the movie very much.  4 stars.

'Miss Sadie Thompson' (1953) - Tepid quasi-musical adaptation of Summerset Maugham's 'Rain' with Jose Ferrer fails to deliver the emotional intensity that Joan Crawford and Walter Huston did twenty years earlier.  2 1/2 stars.

'Salome' (1953) - Cheesy but watchable Biblical mini-epic is moderately entertaining, primarily thanks to a great ensemble cast.  2 1/2 stars.

This five disc set has been out for some time now and has remained at the hefty $49 and up price tag ever since its debut, which is completely unjustified, given two of the movies have already been out on the market for years now. Those two are also this set's best: the epic film noir fairytale ""Gilda"" and the very flashy, charismatic musical ""Cover Girl"". And they're also the same exact transfers from their previous releases, so shouldn't the price reflect that?

The highlights are supposedly three newly remastered color films, which all look fantastic. All are also nice examples of how not every classic movie is a classic. The only bright spot of ""Tonight and Every Night"" is a luscious number featuring Hayworth and Janet Blair performing in colored PJs, which do a beautiful job of highlighting their perfect figures; otherwise, I found my attention waning repeatedly. ""Miss Sadie Thompson"" is the most toothless adaptation of the story, and ""Salome"" may be one of the most boring things ever filmed.

It's an expensive history lesson showcasing what most of Columbia's films of the post-war era turned out like, but you'd best either pick it up cheap like I did or just pick up a single of ""Gilda"".",1332892800,3,1338,4.808695652173913

3846199,4,B0024FAG7Q,"""The Films of Rita Hayworth"" once again validate what a true Movie Star Rita Hayworth was. One of its strongest lures is that ""Tonight and Every Night,"" ""Salome"" and ""Miss Sadie Thompson"" are finally available on DVD. I am not that fussy about picture and sound quality, so do not have much to say about the transfers. And being a fan of film dance, I am delighted to be able to see Rita dance, lip-synch and smolder. In ""Miss Sadie Thompson,"" Rita's extraordinary performance of ""The Heat is On"" is what that film is all about. And, for me, the heart of ""Salome"" is her ""Dance of the 7 Veils,"" no matter how ill-conceived it is. Valerie Bettis is the wrong choreographer for a primitive, erotic dance. But since Modern-Dance-Bettis was under contract to Columbia Studio at the time, I understand why they used her. It is the smoldering close-ups of Rita that make it work. And Charles Laughton never fails to make me howl watching him act ""the lusty pedophile."" As a sidenote, there is a infamous radio commercial for the film in which the announcer actually said:""Rita Hayworth's Salami will take your breath away.""

I am very disappointed in the ""Extras"" and think that Sony should be ashamed of themselves. Patricia Clarkson is a lovely and well-spoken actress, but what she says has no particular focus. The only worthwhile piece is when Baz Luhrmann and Martin Scorcese talk about ""Gilda.""  Jack Cole is [finally/luckily] mentioned by Scorcese in the ""Gilda"" extra in terms of his work on ""Put the Blame on Mame,"" but most of the success of ""Tonight and Every Night"" is dependant upon the musical numbers Jack Cole created for Hayworth, Marc Platt and Janet Blair. Platt's dancing to a Hitler speech is a landmark and what he did for Hayworth in ""You Excite Me"" is unleashing the beautiful beast in her. If you don't believe me, look at her flouncing about in ""Cover Girl"": high shoulders, frozen mannequin hands, coy smiles and none of the sharpness Cole infuses in her in ""You Excite Me."" Cole also partners Rita in the film so I think a major point about the success of this film was completely overlooked. Ms. Clarkson runs the laundry list of names in her talks (Director, screenwriter, director of photography, composers,costume and scenic design, etc.) but ignores letting the viewers know who had the ""vision"" for the musical numbers - which is nearly 50% of ""Tonight and Every Night."" I love Baz Luhrmann and his films, but am afraid that he did not do his homework - or doesn't know the difference - in some of the the things he said about Rita's dance ability on the ""Cover Girl"" extra. She was not a Flamenco dancer, she was a classical Spanish Dancer, which is very different in its fluidity and femininity from the rhythmic and aggressive sharpness of Flamenco. Baz is a former Ballroom dancer and should know the difference.",1294444800,17,2845,4.722334004024145
3846200,5,B0024FAG7Q,"After dancing professionally from the age of 13 with her father's troupe, and then after five years working in the film business, in 1940 Rita Hayworth was a starlet under contract to Columbia Studios. She had had leading roles in B films, serials, and some supporting roles in major films like 'Only Angels Have Wings' with Cary Grant (1939) and 'Susan and God' with Fredric March and Joan Crawford.

In 1941 Rita bloomed-blossomed-EXPLODED onto the screen as a major film celebrity. First, as 'The Strawberry Blonde' (for Warners), she received great notices and gave a well-polished performance as an 1890's flirt. Rita worked well & charmingly opposite James Cagney.

At 20th Century-Fox, Hayworth was dazzling as the temptress Dona Sol in the Technicolor 'Blood and Sand' opposite Tyrone Power (who can forget the way she runs her fingers thru & pulls Power up by his hair!). Her Sol was mysterious in her silences, yet highly erotic in her interaction with Power and Anthony Quinn. Rita was fantastic in color and became Hollywood's most famous redhead with the release of this film.

At this time, by Hayworth's own account, Fred Astaire came to her home studio Columbia, signed on for 2 films, and asked for Hayworth to be his partner. Their first film, released in 1941, was 'You'll Never Get Rich'. Astaire and Hayworth were magical together, and most critics agree that Hayworth was one of Astaire's best dancing partners.

Astaire would later state in his memoirs that ""Rita danced with trained perfection and individuality."" And according to Astaire's good friend David Niven, and also Astaire's daughter Ava, Rita Hayworth was Fred Astaire's all-time favorite dance partner.

Publicizing the release of 'You'll Never Get Rich', Time Magazine put Hayworth on the cover of their November 10 1941 issue, with a portrait by the famed pin-up illustrator George Petty.

Finally, in August of 1941, Life Magazine published the iconic photo of Rita perched on a bed in a satin and lace nightgown. It became one of the most famous 'pin ups' of the war years. By the end of 1941 she was nicknamed ""The Love Goddess of the 20th Century"". She had just turned 23.

So here was the birth of a modern film Goddess, surely as remarkable as Venus herself arising from the sea. Hayworth in her day was compared to this ancient deity (Life Magazine, ""The Cult of the Love Goddess in America"" 1947), representing for her generation their current feminine ideal.

Even now Hayworth provides the prototype of the ideal woman: that amazing head of long flowing auburn hair, crowned with a widow's peak. The angular face with its beautiful profile. The full lips, the ample bosom. the elegant hands with their long red fingernails. But there was much more to her than that. She was in her own right an excellent dancer, one of the best. When dancing she moved -flowed- thru space with an unearthly grace. She was extremely photogenic-- the camera loved her, as it did Marilyn Monroe. Onscreen, she brims over with exotic magnetism. It is hard to take one's eyes off of her. Yet, like Ava Gardner, Hayworth could convey a warmth, a deep vulnerability, to her audiences.

Columbia's studio chief Harry Cohn was said to have been quite an ogre in real life, but he was above all a showman. He presented Rita in films tailored to capture her unique charsima at its upmost. On the whole, he was very successful. The Hayworth persona is perfectly captured in her Columbia films.

The five films in THIS set -'Cover Girl' 1944- 'Tonight and Every Night' 1945- 'Gilda' 1946- 'Salome' 1953- and 'Miss Sadie Thompson' 1953- give us a great representation of Hayworth in her full glory, at the height of her powers to mesmerize an audience.

Hayworth the dancer. In 'Cover Girl', Hayworth in a flowing dress of gold comes flying down - seemingly from the heavens -to dance with her chorus, a truly iconic moment. Yet another from the same film, the majestic 'Long Ago And Far Away' musical sequence, is a masterpiece of lyrical romanticism. Rita and Gene Kelly bring to their perfomance here a highly-charged romantic passion that is amazing to watch. Their dancing sizzles with electricity, culminating with Hayworth giving herself to Kelly by dropping deeply into his arms-- surely one of the hottest dance moves in movie history.

One of the highlights of this set is the many dance and musical numbers Hayworth is involved in. In these films, working with some of the best choreograpers from Hollywood & Broadway (like Jack Cole, Gene Kelly, Valerie Bettis, among others), Hayworth excels in a wide range of musical numbers-- old-time vaudeville numbers, classic tap, comedy numbers, exhilarating duets with Kelly, a white-hot Brazilian samba, the primitive-style choreography of the 'Dance of the Seven Veils', the archetypal siren's song of 'Amado Mio', the playful mock-strip of the iconic 'Put the Blame on Mame'.

The Hayworth closeup. Rita Hayworth and Technicolor were made for each other. An expensive process at the time, I am grateful that Columbia Studios was able to put Rita in many Technicolor films. The extreme closeups of Hayworth in these films (particularly in 'Tonight and Every Night'), are just jaw-dropping. Dazzling. Hayworth's coloring in these films- her skin all peaches and cream, the vivid red-gold of her hair- just unreal like a dream. Cinematographer Rudy Mate (he also shot 'Gilda'), and the others who shot these films must be commended for their artistry in contributing to Rita's mystique.

Hayworth and 'Tonight'. This under-rated musical has the most beautiful Technicolor photography I have ever seen. Lee Bowman, who lost Rita to Gene Kelly in 'Cover Girl', makes a good leading man for her in this film. The erotic high-point of 'Tonight and Every Night', the 'You Excite Me' dance number, is amazing for its risque lyrics as well as for its overwhelming visuals and for its spectacular, delirious musical arrangement.

Salome and Sadie. While perhaps the weakest film in the set, nevertheless 'Salome' is a prime example of Hayworth in her 'goddess' mode, with many lavish closeups of her, each accompanied by her own special musical motif. Designer Jean Louis dresses Hayworth in every color of the rainbow, first in Roman, then in Palestinian princess designs. This film is sheer eye candy.

'Miss Sadie Thompson' is a total departure for Rita, her first character part, and one of her best performances. The whole film has a nice, jazzy feel to it. Rita's Sadie is fun-loving, a bit blowsy, and we see her as a totally street-wise 'dame'. She more than holds her own in the dramatic scenes with co-star Jose Ferrer. Rita as Sadie, drunk and sweating in a roomful of drunken marines, cuts loose with 'The Heat is On'-- another iconic, memorable moment. Yet she tops herself in the very next scene with the jazzy, blusey 'Blue Pacific Blues'.

Gilda. A black and white film that launched Rita into immortality. In 1946, the first atomic bomb exploded in peacetime was named ""Gilda""...so explosive was this character on the public's imagination. 'There Never Was A Woman Like GILDA' screamed the ads back then, yet it still holds true today. This is a 'film noir' meditation on sex and desire. Co-star Glenn Ford has said Hayworth was his favorite actress and that this was his favorite film. Director Charles Vidor guides his favorite actress perfectly, and somehow, in some organic way, he captured her essence as no director ever has.  Rita is simply magical in 'Gilda'. Pure cinema magic.

Also, Rita Hayworth and music go hand in hand. Kudos to Columbia Studios' music department-headed by Morris Stoloff- who provided rich, beautiful orchestrations and music for each Hayworth film. A perfect example of their artistry would be the fanfare to the opening credits of 'Gilda' and 'Miss Sadie Thompson'. Wonderful music.

After a very long time in development, Sony Pictures is releasing this 5 disc set as part of their 'Collectors Choice' series in conjunction with Martin Scorsese's Film Foundation. All films have been restored and this set will be of high quality just by its pedigree.

A special thanks to Mr. Scorsese, whose name has been connected to so many restorations of classic films this year. He seems to be deeply involved in keeping these films alive for future generations, as well as being our greatest living director. I find him inspiring.",1288915200,41,8388,4.968616262482168
