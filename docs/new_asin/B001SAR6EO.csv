8339608,4,B001SAR6EO,"i enjoyed the first couple of season immensely.  As the series wore on, it became repetitive, and finally became boring.",1362355200,,120,5.0
8339609,5,B001SAR6EO,I am thoroughly happy with my purchase. The DVDs were in mint condition and came very quickly!,1246838400,,94,4.588235294117647
8339610,5,B001SAR6EO,"I hope everyone who is reading this considers purchasing LOST!  If not purchase, at least go watch the show because in my opinion it's amongst the best series on television and it will keep you glued wanting and needing for more episodes.  But, Lost isn't something you can just pick up at any season...you need to watch from season 1 and go in order otherwise you will be LOST!  This box set of seasons 1-4 is cheaper then buying them individually but if you don't have the money to buy them individually buy one at a time starting with season 1 at $38.99 on amazon.  I'd speak more about lost but i don't want to spoil anything for you.  But if you can wait til december they will be releasing the seasons 1-5 box set and in that way you will be able to get all of the current seasons together and be able to watch them back to back!  be prepared to lose alot of sleep, accomplish nothing during the day, and run your electric bill up hahaha because once you start lost you will keep playing more and more one after the other because it has the effect of making you want to know what happens next.",1246752000,,1099,4.23444976076555
8339611,5,B001SAR6EO,No problems with this order at all.  It came quickly and was exactly as described.,1246320000,,82,4.466666666666667
8339612,5,B001SAR6EO,"It goes without saying that this is a phenomenal series, but I will say it anyway: LOST is a great show.

One word of caution: As the price of these DVD sets often fluctuates, it's difficult to say whether it is better to buy the four seasons individually or whether to invest in this set.  (At the moment, it is cheaper to buy them separately, but that could change tomorrow.)  Be sure to do the math yourself!

In any case, each season of LOST is well worth owning.  A series this complex makes multiple viewings a near necessity.  And then you'll want to watch them all again once the series has concluded (with Season Six), just to pick up on all the details you glossed over previously.",1242777600,,691,4.4015748031496065
8339613,5,B001SAR6EO,"Okay with the dvd's to watch, now i can find all of the little inconsistencies. the statue they just showed in season 5 finally is no where near where they first camped. Sun's wedding dress is wrong. but this is a show i can watch over and over again to find the little things they missed when scanning for continuity.",1242518400,,318,4.316666666666666
8339614,5,B001SAR6EO,"This show will keep you jumping from one thought to another. Plus, buying four seasons at one time was economical and made viewing even more addictive.",1242172800,,151,4.846153846153846
8339615,5,B001SAR6EO,This is great quality for dvds and fun adventure to follow year by year.  Having this is a wonderful way to catch up with Lost.,1240617600,,127,4.08
