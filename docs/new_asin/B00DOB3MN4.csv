5838526,5,B00DOB3MN4,"These are three of my favorite actresses - in a soap opera mystery. All the actors are very good, as is the plot, but the real plus is the depiction of the late forties. I was a child during that time and it is a slice of Americana that will probably not come again - the working woman, the housewife and the social climber. Some would probably not want to revisit that era but it had its strengths, like all times. I think it was a pretty realistic portrayal of what I remember, so I would recommend it, both for the story and the window into post-war suburban life.",1383696000,8,567,4.2110091743119265

5838528,5,B00DOB3MN4,"Anyone who had any doubts about whether to upgrade from the previous ""Studio Classics"" DVD that Fox released in 2005 can put all those doubts away. Released this week, ""A Letter to Three Wives""(1949) looks nearly pristine(Bitrate: 31.98) on Blu-ray and once again credit should be given to the great restoration team at Fox. Filmed in black and white, ""Letter"" has never looked better than it does in this new Blu-ray from Fox. There is no print damage(vertical lines, specs, torn or missing frames, etc.) and some of the close-ups are stunning to say the least. Blacks, whites and grays are evenly balanced right down to the costumes, automobiles(I'd love to have that ""Woody"" that Jeanne Crain drives),household items and even the famous ""letter"" that the three wives receive in the beginning of the picture. My only complaint would be that some scenes seem to be overly bright but they are few and are not distracting and may have something to do with the print source rather than the restoration. Nearly everyone who has seen ""Letter"" knows the story so I won't go into that except to say that it was originally called ""A Letter to Five Wives"" but cut to four wives when adapted by Vera Caspary from the Cosmopolitan story. Joseph L.  Mankiewicz, who wrote the screenplay and directed(winning Oscars for both) cut out the fourth wife(who was to be played by Anne Baxter) further tightening the story which keeps you guessing until the end. He rewarded Baxter one year later with one of the leads in ""All About Eve"" the film he is most remembered for. Mankiewicz considered himself a writer first and foremost and the actors he cast in ""Letter"" give some of their best performances with his witty dialogue. Linda Darnell is exceptional in her role as the brazen and cynical golddigging wife of Paul Douglas. Fox mainstay Thelma Ritter adds comic relief to the tense setting. She's always a delight. The Audio(English: DTS-HD Master Audio Mono & Dolby Digital 2.0) is crisp and clear with no hiss or other noise artifacts. ""A Letter to Three Wives"" is 103 minutes(Aspect ratio: 1.33.1) and contains the following subtitles: English SDH, French and Spanish. Special features include an audio commentary by Mankiewicz's son Christopher, a superb documentary on the tragic life of Linda Darnell seen on ""BIOGRAPHY"", Fox Movietone News and the Trailer to the film. Like their recent Blu-ray releases of ""Blood and Sand"", ""Niagara"", ""Cleopatra""(also directed by Mankiewicz), ""How Green Was My Valley"", and many other films recently restored, Fox continues to give consumers and film collectors only the best when it comes to home entertainment. ""A Letter to Three Wives"" in Blu-ray should be a welcome addition to any film collectors library.",1379721600,37,2739,4.9803493449781655
5838529,4,B00DOB3MN4,"Joseph L. Mankiewicz's 1949 character drama A LETTER TO THREE WIVES provides a tour-de-force showcase for three outstanding female stars, and illustrates a timeless dilemma that most every married woman must have considered at least once during her marriage...

On their way to chaperone a childrens' picnic, girlfriends Deborah Bishop (Jeanne Crain), Rita Phipps (Ann Sothern) and Lora Mae Hollingsway (Linda Darnell) receive a mysterious letter - addressed to all of them - in which local good-time gal Addie Ross reveals that she has left town, and taken one of their husbands with her! Too late to call off their involvement with the picnic and return home to uncover the truth, the ladies spend quiet moments to themselves, and try to recall incidents that might have caused rifts in their marriages...

Deborah remembers the night that husband Brad (Jeffrey Lynn) first introduced her to Rita, Lora Mae, and their close circle of friends. The insecure farmgirl originally joined the Navy in an attempt to launch herself into the great big world outside, never entertaining the notion that she'd net a husband out of it. She drowns her fears in a series of martinis, puts on her only ""fancy"" gown, and later embarrasses herself on the Country Club dance-floor when her dress performs a wardrobe malfunction.

Career-minded Rita casts her thoughts back to the night when she pushed hubby George's (Kirk Douglas) birthday celebration out of the window in order to host a dinner party for two ill-mannered radio executives. And Lora Mae recalls her blue-collar beginnings in the small trackside house that she shared with her mother and sister, where millionaire Porter Hollingsway (Paul Douglas) plucked up his earnest employee for a glamorous life of leisure.

One husband has now left the picture. As the three ladies re-assemble at the Country Club with their partners, the truth will be revealed, but not before one final twist to the puzzle...

I'll never comprehend exactly *how* screenwriter Joseph L. Mankiewicz was able to probe so deeply into the female psyche, and write two screenplays that seem to precisely echo the fears, insecurities and longings that are universal for every woman. ""All About Eve"", and most especially A LETTER TO THREE WIVES still stand up remarkably well in their depiction of strong women who still aren't afraid to explore their inner fears and failings.

Darnell, Crain and Sothern are all outstanding in the lead roles. Sothern, I believe, comes off best with some of Mankiewicz's snappiest dialogue. Little wonder that Ms Sothern later fared so brilliantly in the world of sitcom television. Ms Darnell is fascinating as Lora Mae. At this time, Darnell had successfully graduated within the ranks of Fox from sweet ingenue roles in ""Day-Time Wife"" and ""Mark of Zorro"" to harder-edged characters like jaded concubine Tuptim in ""Anna and the King of Siam"". As Lora Mae, Ms Darnell brings us a truly complex young woman whose clearly not your standard gold-digging dummy. Jeanne Crain, it's reported, wasn't well-liked by Mankiewicz; but Fox producer Darryl Zanuck had been grooming Ms Crain since she first arrived on the lot, personally supervising her casting in such box-office hits as ""State Fair"", and had in fact originally earmarked Crain for the title role in ""All About Eve"" (this never materialised, probably for obvious reasons!). Nevertheless she is charming as Deborah.

The character of Addie Ross, the woman who triggers the internal drama for the three women, is truly an enigma throughout the film. Despite the fact that we never actually see her (we almost do in one tantalising frame), she permeates every second of the film, ala Hitchcock's ""Rebecca"". An unbilled Celeste Holm (who went on to play Karen in ""All About Eve"") provides Addie's narration.

Over fifty years since it's original release haven't dulled the revelance of this absorbing character drama.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: A Letter to Three Wives is considered one of the screen's best treatments of marriage, offering inside looks at three suburban couples, each of whom represents a different side of the issue. The Bishops [Jeanne Crain and Jeffrey Lynn] are the typical post-war marriage of two naive young people who met when both were in uniform. The Phipps [Ann Sothern and Kirk Douglas] are a working couple, plagued by career conflicts, particularly the fact that she out-earns him. And the Hollingsways [Linda Darnell and Paul Douglas] are an upwardly mobile couple held together by memories of their original sexual chemistry and fear of what a divorce could do to his business.

Each couple's story also plays out in its own comic style. The unsophisticated Crain's marital problems take the form of romantic comedy as she tries to deal with her insecurities. Writer Sothern and teacher Kirk Douglas move the film into the realm of high comedy as they cross swords with wit and he struggles to survive a dinner with her boss, the pretentious producer of a group of radio soap operas. Darnell and her rough-hewn husband, Paul Douglas, represent a broader take on the battle of the sexes, though her taming of him during their courtship and the height of their emotions, from lust to anger to jealousy, gives their story an almost Shakespearean character.

Joseph L Mankiewiczs A Letter to Three Wives, dishes out some hard hitting good wisdom and advice. The wisdom is a tripled panelled comedy-romance, where the love is very volatile which can quickly. And the advice, angled mainly towards the ladies, is never to speak harsh words or such, to their true-loving husbands who may leave them and never return.

A Letter to Three Wives represents one of the most ingenious uses of the flashback in American film history. Director-writer Joseph L. Mankiewicz links the stories of the three marriages with recurring characters, visual motifs and sounds, with Addie Ross, the unseen small-town temptress, always somewhere behind the action. When this film became his first hit, Joseph L. Mankiewicz became 20th Century-Fox's top director. It also brought him the first of two pairs of Oscars for Best Directing and Best Screenplay, the second set was for 1950's All About Eve, a feat still unmatched. Linda Darnell and Paul Douglas gave their best performances as the battling Hollingsways. The film also marked Kirk Douglas' big screen debut, after a successful Broadway run as junkyard tycoon Harry Brock in Born Yesterday.

Indeed, it is just such a prospect and the prospect of hubby taking off, which suddenly confronts the three wives of the title in the Music Hall's new film. Just as they're starting out one morning to take some kids on a river-boat picnic, these three country-club wives in a small town get a letter from a local friend. The friend very graciously informs them that she is eloping with one the husbands. Provokingly, however, she fails to tell them exactly what husband it is. And so, while these three anxious ladies are shanghaied all day with the kids, they have plenty of time to wonder and reflect on their married lives. The one who snagged her helpmate, while he was a sailor, and she has little more to disturb her than the thought that she lacks sufficient ""class."" But the one who is a radio-writer and has been letting her mind get rather blunt has the disquieting realisation that she has fallen a bit beneath her spouse. And the third one, the hard-boiled gold-digger who deliberately roped her hard-boiled man and has the frightening knowledge that, while she loves him, they have each let the other down.

Thus, in the reflections of these ladies, Joseph L. Mankiewicz cleverly evolves an interesting cross-sectioned picture of the small-town younger-married set. And as writer as well as director, he has capably brought forth a film which has humour, scepticism, satire and gratifying romance. But the final romantic remembrance, that of the hard-boiled wife who is a taut and explosive piece of satire, as funny and as poignant as it is shrewd. And it is played with coruscating vigour by Linda Darnell in the gold-digger role and by Paul Douglas as the rough-cut big-shot whom she tangles with frank and ancient wiles. Indeed, this one rough-and-tumble between Kirk Douglas and Ms. Linda Darnell is deliciously rugged entertainment, the real salvation of the film. For in it are also included Connie Gilchrist as Ms. Linda Darnell's old ma and Thelma Ritter as a beer guzzling neighbour with remarkable and funny barbed things to say. And the verbal dexterity performances of these two, punctuated with rowdy backhand swipes, give a wonderful shanty-town setting to a vulgar yet pathetic romance.

But of course it wouldn't be fair to tell you whose husband it is that has run off with one of the husbands. But the outcome is thoroughly satisfactory and so is the film and a real tour-de-force brilliant film, which is a well-made psychological comedy of morals with witty dialogue and is one of Joseph L. Mankiewicz's best film, especially as each threatened wife reviews her marriage, we get, at best, a sharp, frequently hilarious look at suburbia, and, at worst, a slick series of bright remarks. Joseph L. Mankiewicz coaxed good performances out of Jeanne Crain and Linda Darnell, and the others certainly didn't need coaxing and Paul Douglas is pretty close to magnificent, and Ann Sothern, Kirk Douglas, Florence Bates, Thelma Ritter, and Connie Gilchrist are first-rate.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The films original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.33:1 is faithfully reproduced in this stunning 1080p encoded image transfer. Sharpness is superb throughout, apart from glamour close-ups particularly of Jeanne Crain, and there is detail to be seen in facial features and hair. The grey scale is wonderfully realised with its crisp whites and inky blacks and the encoded image is free from age-related artefacts.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The 1.0 DTS-HD Master Audio Mono sound mix is more controlled and a bit tighter than the slightly louder 2.0 Dolby Digital stereo track which is also provided. The dialogue has been well recorded and is always completely discernible, a good thing for a film in which what is said is so vitally important. Alfred Newmans score has a reasonable amount of fidelity, and the track overall is free from any hiss or other age-related problems. The stereo track does offer a lovely spread for Alfred Newman's score but otherwise doesn't offer much of a difference with the mono audio mix.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Audio Commentary: Commentary with Christopher Mankiewicz, Kenneth Geist and Cheryl Lower: With this particular audio commentary, it is totally brilliant and is so full of interesting and intelligent anecdotes, and the said three people in the recording studio, I call them The Dynamic Trio as they inform us of some fantastic inside information about all aspects of this brilliant film and also what went on behind-the-scenes. We find out that this is the first quintessential Joseph L. Mankiewicz film, as well as a typical Mankiewicz film, especially in the genre of high comedy, and the Director works best in his view of social satire arena. A Letter to Three Wives we are informed, is one of Mankiewiczs finest and funniest film, because from the first footage of the different small town streets and houses of the three married couples, and it is also a humorous light study of the social class conflict among the bickering married couples of different class and wealth, all of whom idolise and envy the social goddess Addie Ross. We also get informed that all films were predominantly in the studio, but Mankiewicz persuaded Daryl F. Zanuck to let him go East for the exterior shots and part of the film where the three women for the local boat trip at the start of the film, was actually shot in the Hudson River in New York, a couple of hours North of Manhattan area and the day of the shooting of this particular scene it rained solid for 9 days and was a hair pulling experience for the Studio Executives. At the time of shooting this film in 1948, the Production Code had a long list of rules and regulations on what would not be permitted to be included in the film and Cheryl Lower reads out a letter from the Production Code to Joseph L. Mankiewicz informing him they cannot have the word laxative, cannot have the word toilet in your film and sounds totally humorous in the 21st Century and a down right prehistoric Victorian attitude that Hollywood had in that period of the 20th Century, especially if any Hollywood Studio went against the Production Code and tried to show the film, they would get a very heavy financial fine and would also not be allowed the film to be shown in any cinemas, so sadly everyone had to play by the Production Code dictate system. So Joseph L. Mankiewicz adapted the film from two sources, the original was from a Cosmo magazine short story A Letter to Five Wives and then adapted for the screen by Vera Casper and then turned into A Letter to Four Wives and Mankiewicz found it far too long and try to cut it down to a manageable screenplay, but finally had to go to Darryl F. Zanuck and informing him of this serious problem, Darryl F. Zanuck told him it was simple and to take out one of the wives from the screenplay. At around Chapter 10 we finally get to see the fabulous actress Thelma Ritter, which we find out this is a her first major film role in a Motion Picture, whereas before Thelma Ritter was basically only in cameo roles in films like Miracle On 34th Street and Call Northside 777, and eventually we get to see Thelma Ritter has to be put in a ridiculous waitress outfit to impress Ann Sothern pompous crass ignorant two Radio Advertising Executives and you get that fabulous scene where Kirk Douglas lambasts the Radio Executives who are involved with radio soap operas, that is insulting to their radio audiences who listens to the pathetic sanitised vacuous simple minded scripts, especially including radio adverts of the period like today, where if you drink the right beer, youll get the girl, etc, etc, etc. The three audio commentators talk about the Texas beauty Linda Darnell, who was signed by a Fox scout at the age of 15 years of age, and under her contract with Fox, Ms. Darnell had been making films since 1939, 10 years before this particular film, and in the third part of the film we see the character of Ms. Darnell lives on the wrong side of the track and see how she eventually gets her man so that she no longer lives in poverty and is looked upon as a Gold-digger, but deep down she is really in love with her man Paul Douglas. We also find out that Joseph L. Mankiewicz liked the character of Kirk Douglas, also loved words and also had read all the classics at school and was a very learned man. And so clever Mankiewicz is with his screenplay with this film, it keeps you guessing right up the final cliff-hanger in the Country Club, who is exposed as the husband who has run off with Addie, the socialite gold-digger vamp, and we are all fooled, and that is why Joseph L. Mankiewicz is a master at producing brilliant screenplays and was totally deserved the Academy Award OSCAR especially for this film. By the way when we get to the final part of this film when the wine glass is tipped over and breaks and the Noel Coward type quip by Addie, when she says Hey Ho! is a throwback to the ghostly scene in the 1932 Warner Bros. classic One Way passage starring Kay Francis and William Powell, and of course we come to the reality for the life of the three wives and where Addie has lost out when the glass is tipped over and is broken. So to sum up, this is a totally brilliant and professional audio commentary presentation and Christopher Mankiewicz, Kenneth Geist and Cheryl Lower certainly know their facts and also enlighten us on how this brilliant film deserved all of its awards it received and it will be a great loss if you give this audio commentary a miss, as it will totally enthral you all the way to the very end of the 103 minutes audio commentary. Happy viewing!

Special Feature: Linda Darnell: Hollywoods Fallen Angel [1999] [1080p] [4:3] [44:03] This truly wonderful TV Special, was first shown on BIOGRAPHY on the American A&E Network and is Narrated by Peter Graves. We are informed that Linda Darnell was a Teenage Starlet who took a nation by storm and with this special extra we get contributions from well-known Hollywood people, who are as follows: Ronald Davis [Biographer]; Undeen Darnell Hunter [Sister]; Lola Marley [Daughter]; James Robert Parish [Film Historian]; Dorris Bowdon Johnson [Actress]; Roddy McDowall [Actor]; Alice Faye [Actress]; Richard Widmark [Actor] and A.C. Lyles [Producer]. Up until now I had not known about this brilliant and talented actress and because of having her in this Joseph L. Mankiewicz film, I am now have more appreciation with this beautiful actress. Her life story is quite extraordinary, especially being brought up by her very eccentric and volatile Mother, especially with all the excessive menagerie of animals and especially a cockerel who was allowed to eat at the dinner table. Linda Darnell also had very volatile marriages that sadly always ended in failure, but Ms. Darnell did have a brief affair with Joseph L. Mankiewicz, but sadly it was not to last. Another sad reflection of Ms. Darnell life was not able to have any children, because of medical complications and eventually adopted a beautiful daughter. Despite a brilliant acting career on the silver screen and stage performances, that was equally prolific and really enjoyed performing to a live audience, but sadly because of deep bouts of depressions, especially with her career being a very volatile rollercoaster ride, and failed marriages, but at one point of her career looked like it was on the up. But sadly her career ended tragically, as Ms. Darnell was staying with friends at their apartment, which tragically caught fire and the actress suffered from really bad third degree burns and also suffered from severe excruciating pain and after a 9 hour battle, sadly passed away and Hollywood lost a beautiful starlet and also a very talented actress and this special feature is really beautiful produced and is well worth a view and gets a 5 star rating from me. Happy viewing!

Fox Movietone News: 22nd Annual Academy Awards OSCARS, Presented For Achievement in Motion Pictures [1949] [480i] [4:3] [1:15] This Black-and-White newsreel, gives us a view of the whos who of the top Hollywood Royalty; but the only person you get see awarded for A Letter to Three Wives is Joseph L. Mankiewicz. Narrated by Joe King.

Theatrical Trailer [1949] [480i] [4:3] [2:43] This is the original Theatrical Trailer. Despite it being a good print, sadly the audio sound is totally atrocious, whatever was 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment.

Finally, this is a brilliant and great Hollywood film classic which features sparkling writing and brilliant performances, A Letter to Three Wives is a welcome addition to the growing number of Fox Blu-rays of the studios best films. A Letter to Three Wives is the very definition of an under-appreciated film classic, which is really unfortunate, because its an excellent and unique intelligent well thought out film. It was very well written and has a good twist at the end. The acting was totally brilliant and its just a film that I would gladly watch again and again. I just cannot figure out why this film isn't talked about more. Maybe it was eclipsed by Joseph L. Mankiewiczs next film All About Eve. But whatever the reason, if you ever have the chance to see it, it is well worth viewing this awesome quality Blu-ray disc. Highly Recommended!
