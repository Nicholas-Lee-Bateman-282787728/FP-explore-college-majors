8146826,5,B000IOM0VK,"This March 4, 1986 concert stands out for a number of reasons. Anita at 67 is as much in control of the stage and musicians as she was 28 years prior at the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival. And she could still sing and swing!

A big plus for me is this video provided some excellent shots of her long time drummer, John Poole, who is one of my idols and inspirations (and was also with Anita at the 58 Newport Jazz Festival.)

The opening song - Wave - was a good warm-up because when the next song - You'd Be So Nice To Come Home To - got going she hit her stride and maintained it for the rest of the concert. In that song she and Tommy Whittle on tenor saxophone traded fours in an extended call and response lasting more bars than I bothered to count. At one point the other musicians stopped while Anita and Mr. Whittle continued, building tension, which was released in a remarkably timed rejoining by John Poole, Merrill Hover in piano and Lennie Bush on bass. The next song, Green Dolphin Street was clear evidence that the energy was going to stay the entire performance. Even the next song, the ballad I Can't Get Started did not break the pace.

I thoroughly enjoy watching Anita in performance, and especially when those performances are years apart so one can compare and contrast them. I have every DVD of her that is available, including her short appearance on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jazz-on-a-Summer-s-Day/dp/B00003OSU4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jazz on a Summer's Day</a>, and none of her energy or talent had left her when this performance was [thankfully] captured on film. This, like every other video I have of her, is a treasure and contains a performance to be savored again and again.",1335657600,2,1757,4.85
8146827,5,B000IOM0VK,"I had written a review of her previously, in which I criticized her seemingly haughty attitude, but I had never seen her in person, nor had I seen her on a DVD.
I had only heard her on records or CDs, and had formed my opinion based on how she sounded, and anecdotes I had heard or read about her.
I must say after watching this DVD that she had an amazing, unique talent:  I don't think I've ever seen any other singer seemingly imitate a musical instrument in precisely the same way - and she seemed to do it quite naturally, and it didn't seem to be ridiculous, as it could easily have been.
I guess it goes without saying that one has surely missed out on something great, not to have seen her in person - because she definitely does seem to have had a very unique talent, and was certainly a cut above the ordinary.
Even a very good singer doesn't just move seamlessly through the music, using her voice as if it were an instrument (which it really is, of course) but not an instrument in the sense that we ordinarily think of it.
And so maybe what it boils down to is that she really was a ""diva,"" in the purest sense of the word, and, as such, had a little problem relating to mere mortals.",1332547200,,1197,4.181818181818182
8146828,3,B000IOM0VK,"~ While this 55 minute DVD does capture a nice performance by Anita O'Day at age 67, it is just that = nice.  Not outstanding.
~ The program is varied, and she shows signs of the old spark on the up-tempo numbers.  However, the ballades drag a little bit (even Anita admitted in numerous interviews that ballades are not her strong point).
~ The performances here are not up to the standards of her earlier recorded performances (see for example the DVDs&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jazz-Icons-Anita-O-Day-Live-in-63-70/dp/B002N5KDZM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jazz Icons: Anita O'Day Live in '63 & '70</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Live-in-Tokyo-63/dp/B0012D7DJK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Live in Tokyo '63</a>, her historic performance in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jazz-on-a-Summer-s-Day/dp/B00003OSU4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jazz on a Summer's Day</a>, and the second DVD in the biographical set&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Anita-O-Day-The-Life-Of-A-Jazz-Singer/dp/B001W3P50O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Anita O'Day - The Life Of A Jazz Singer</a>).  Of course, some of this is the result of a long hard life, but some of it is the the lack of dynamic interaction between Anita and the individual members of the band.  If you want to see Anita the musician as an integral part of a band check out the videos listed and linked above.
~ Despite the fact that Anita may have lost some of her spark, and the voice no longer had the clarity that it had in the 1950's and 1960's, Anita at 67 years of age was still a great improvisor.
~ The sound quality is not as clear as it should be for a 1986 recording, and sometimes the balance between instrument volumes is not great; however, the video is visually excellent.
~ I gave the DVD a rating of 3-stars (which for me is ""average"") mainly because there are other videos that document Anita O'Day at her best and therefore warrant higher ratings.  Having said that, the DVD is still entertaining and the music is much better than so much of the other music being produced in 1986 (not to mention today).",1330732800,3,2240,6.031446540880503
8146829,4,B000IOM0VK,"Anita could still swing at her age in this one!  Of course, she probably could until the day she died.
One of the best-ever jazz singers, if not THE best!",1245456000,2,154,4.133333333333334
8146830,5,B000IOM0VK,"All too often, performances by jazz greats released on DVD date from the artists' declining years, when their technique or control has begun to slip, making most of these programmes slightly depressing affairs. I am happy to say, that's not the case here. O'Day benefits from never having depended on the quality of her voice for her greatness, so age doesn't really diminish her. Her vocal instrument was always merely pleasant, never spectacular. What makes Anita O'Day one of the greatest jazz singers of all time--nay, one of the great jazz *musicians*--is that she has such an innate feeling for the music. In every performance, she is constantly playing with time, rhythm, melodic variation. She is truly that jazz artist for whom the cliche fits: she never sings the same song twice. Watching her outfox and outplay her sidemen in this show (and she is outplaying them, albeit with her voice) is a real kick, as she gleefully deconstructs familiar old standards, sometimes several times within one song. Even the lyrics become almost secondary. For Anita, it's about the musical feeling, the improvisation, the sheer joy of getting inside a tune and blowing it up.  Watch this show, and the years seem to drop away. Anita O'Day is truly ageless.",1233446400,10,1252,4.961904761904762
8146831,5,B000IOM0VK,"I bought this DVD for someone else, he loves it and says it's one the best shows he saw from O'Day.",1217635200,3,99,3.761904761904762
8146832,2,B000IOM0VK,Very disappointing. I was hoping this was a re-masterred version of an album formerly recorded by Anita O'Day. It is not Anita O'Day in her prime which I had thought this was. This was produced 2 years before her death at the age of 80+.  Hardly Anita in her prime.,1170720000,9,265,4.3
8146833,5,B000IOM0VK,Good recording. Anita still had a good quality to her voice. Good back up from trio.,1168560000,8,84,4.3125
