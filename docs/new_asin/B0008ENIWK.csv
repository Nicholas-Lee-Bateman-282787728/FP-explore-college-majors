2258195,5,B0008ENIWK,"To start from the beginning, I picked up this DVD set at the store and looked at the cover as I was deciding if I should get it or not. As soon as I read the back of it I started laughing so hard everyone was looking at me. I knew I had to get it.

To state the obvious Kirstie Alley is one of the funniest ladies of television of all time. It does not really matter how much weight she gains, she is as beautiful as ever and funnier then ever.

As the title of the show suggests, it revolves around Kirstie being a fat actress in Hollywood. From the first episode, which starts with her getting on a scale and throwing herself on the floor screaming and sobbing, till the last one which ends with her saying ""As god is my witness I'll never be fat again"" this show is funny, funny, funny. She has taken her real life experiences and has created most honest, in-your-face comedy I've seen in a long time. Put in a mix all of her Hollywood friends as guests on a show and you've got one entertaining show. I did as one of the reviewers suggested and watched all 7 of them in one afternoon, it was that good. Writing is great; show unfolds very naturally as if you were watching real life. Hope Showtime will bring it back for next season.",1117670400,37,1237,4.15
2258196,2,B0008ENIWK,"I had high expectations for the show. I saw the first episode on a free Showtime weekend and like it. Rented the whole season this weekend and saw that it went downhill fast! Yeah, there are funny parts, but the show quickly gets annoying. Very annoying!! I can't believe there are people that think this is good TV!! I'm not suprised that this show didn't make it.",1117497600,4,365,4.462686567164179
2258197,5,B0008ENIWK,"I missed the first few episodes but was instantly hooked when I left the channel on Showtime one night.

Kirstie is the funniest she has ever been and I love her battles with an oversexed Blossom!",1116547200,6,196,4.444444444444445
2258198,5,B0008ENIWK,"First off, I plan on buying this for everyone I know. Secondly, kudos to Showtime! I subscribed for The L Word, which has been awful in Season 2, and almost cancelled until I saw Fat Actress. It's been a long time since I laughed this hard at television. This is probably the closest that American TV has come to having it's own AbFab. Just to see Blossom again! Oh, the rapture!!! No, it's not for everybody...thank the gods!",1115683200,4,426,4.4743589743589745
2258199,5,B0008ENIWK,"I was one of those people who anxiously awaited this show.  I absolutely LOVE Kirstie Alley's comedic work.  I was; however, a bit disappointed with the first episode of Fat Actress.  It wasn't nearly as funny as I expected it to be, but it was above average if only because Kirstie Alley was in it.  I figured there must be something to it for her to be involved in it and enlist her friends (like John Travolta, Carmen Electra, Kid Rock, which all make cameo appearances).  I didn't give up on the show though, and was happy to find that the 2nd episode (which features Kid Rock) was side splitting funny, just I was hoping and expecting.  All the people who wrote it off after the first episode (I understand ratings plummeted severely after episode 1) are MISSING OUT BIG TIME.  The show is SO funny.  If you are one of the people who dropped it after the first episode, WATCH the 2nd and thereafter epidodes and you will find the show you were hoping for.  The show is granted, not for everyone, but if you enjoy Kirstie Alley's self-depricating humor, you will adore this show.  And BUY the DVD, the price is very reasonable and there are tons of laughs here!",1115424000,7,1165,4.452830188679245
2258200,5,B0008ENIWK,"Mention this show and you're bound to hear people complain about how it was done in such poor taste, how it's insulting to overweight people, how it portrays certain stereotypes incorrectly, etc.

Then ask people who have a Fat Actress-kind of sense of humour and they'll tell you this show is hella funny!

Me?  I happen to be a fan of the show.  Once you realize that the show is poking fun of how Hollywood tends to act, you'll understand that Kirstie isn't suggesting you smoke crack, become bulimic, take laxatives or eat a parasite to lose weight.  She's not telling you to go out jogging in an attempt to ""run into"" a celebrity that could hook you up with your dream guy.  What she IS doing is putting to light the crazy ideas that SOME people have.  The ideas that any sane person knows better than to do.

Only some bits of the shows zany antics were taken from Kirstie's real life experiences.  The rest is pure creativity in the works.

So if you have a crazy sense of humour and aren't offended by ""what-not-to-do"" situations, give the show a shot.  And keep an eye open during episode three to see Kirstie's son, True.

Long live Kirstie and Fat Actress!",1114473600,10,1167,4.478672985781991
2258201,5,B0008ENIWK,"Kirstie Alley is a goddess.  I am a longtime fan. This show is frankly, the funniest thing on TV. It's not everyone's taste, granted.  But it made me laugh so hard I almost passed out.  Ms Alley bravely shines a klieg light on her life and it is hysterical.  If it were up to me, I'd give her the damn emmy already.  Brave, f-ing funny and sometimes staggeringly tasteless.  I am so buying this the instant it hits the shelf.  Oh God, let there be a gag reel",1113782400,10,458,4.136363636363637

I watched that far in hopes that it would improve...but it did not. Why don't they hire some decent writers before putting a series into production, To simply rely on dirty language & trashy sex does NOT make a good show. I thought of dumping the discs in the nearest Goodwill box, but had second thoughts since I don't think this is worth anyone watching it...so in the trash it goes.",1355356800,,533,4.448979591836735

You just have to have that certain sense of humor to be able to understand the comedy.  Yes, she is fat.  Yes, she is self-asorbed.  Yes, she whines and cries alot.  BUT SHE'S ACTING.  It's not how she really lives.  It's sort of like she is doing a mockumentary on herself and she just goes over the top and has fun with it.  While most people can accept this behavior in the privacy of their own homes and possibly with friends, they apparently cannot on a television show.  You either hate it or love it, and I love it.  It cheers me up on a rainy day and just remember, it's not for real, duh.  She's just pretending it is.  That's acting, planet Earth, just a different kind.",1226275200,,834,4.3441558441558445

2258216,4,B0008ENIWK,"When Hollywood branded her as just another overweight and unemployable star, Kirstie Alley hit back with her very own television series.  FAT ACTRESS revolves around a somewhat-fictionalised Kirstie as she battles and schemes to reinvent herself in fame and in life.

FAT ACTRESS is a great show, because it features Kirstie Alley playing an alternate version of her own persona, plus a range of guest stars who aren't afraid to poke fun at themselves.  Much of the dialogue was improvised, which gives a freshness to the episodes.

The main characters in FAT ACTRESS are Kirstie, her personal assistant Eddie Falcone (Bryan Callen), hairdresser Kevyn (Rachael Harris); and diet guru Quinn Taylor-Scott (Kelly Preston), who eats Kleenex tissues.

COMPLETE EPISODE LISTING:

""Big Butts"" - Kirstie forces her agent to set up a meeting with NBC president Jeff Zucker; and after a steamy night with one of his executives, manages to get a holding deal.  Guest starring John Travolta, Jeff Zucker, Mark Curry and Michael McDonald.

""Charlie's Angels"" - Bloated to the point of violent diarrhea after swallowing a series of laxatives and caffeine, Kirstie attends a meeting with ""Charlie's Angels"" director McG.; whilst Eddie decides to stalk Carmen Electra.  Guest starring Kid Rock, Edie McClurg, Carmen Electra, and Melissa Gilbert.

""Holy Lesbo, Batman!"" - Desperate to meet Gwen Stefani, Kirstie plots to intercept her regular afternoon walk, only to wind up being arrested in a gay pick-up sting.  Guest starring Mayim Bialik, Kevin Nealon, and Mo Collins.

""The Koi Effect"" - After being embarrassed on the street by Leah Remini, Kirstie decides to take drastic measures in her dieting.  With a new method, Kirstie surrounds herself with small people and things, and turns her mansion into ""Tiny Town"".  Guest starring Mayim Bialik, Wallace Shawn, and Leah Remini.

""Crack for Good"" - Kirstie's crackhead brother arrives for a visit, just as Kirstie is trying to get a free kitchen makeover on ""Oprah"".  Guest starring Connie Stevens, Christopher McDonald, Geoffrey Lewis, and Larry King.

""Crybaby McGuire"" - Kirstie's new man is just a little bit too sensitive, as she and her assistants discover during a weekend getaway.  Guest starring Bill Smitrovich and Merv Griffin.

""Hold This"" - With her holding deal about to expire, Kirstie will stoop to new depths...  Guest starring Jeff Zucker and Rhea Perlman.

FAT ACTRESS is a side-splitting comedy series that will be remembered for a very long time.  Kirstie Alley gives a fearless performance that sees her into some very graphic and confronting material, yet she still manages to be the same loveable Kirstie that endeared her to ""Cheers"" and ""Veronica's Closet"".  The supporting cast is first-rate, especially Kelly Preston as the Botox-lipped Quinn; and Mayim Bialik (TV's ""Blossom"") will surprise you with her cutting self-parody.

The DVDs include bonus audio commentaries and cast biography pages.",1183507200,2,2959,5.273504273504273
2258217,4,B0008ENIWK,"After watching the first season's seven episodes I am disappointed this show never caught on because it is laugh out loud funny.

This show, to me, is basically ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" only instead of an avuncular bald Jew, you have a fat actress. Kirstie Alley plays herself with such a great sense of humor. She is as funny as she has ever been and has a supporting cast that absolutely shines. Rachel Harris plays Kevyn, Kirstie's friend/assistant, and regualrly steals the scenes she is in. Bryan Callen, from MadTV, plays another friend/assistant of Kirstie. I never really cared for him on MadTV but he is very well cast in this series. The guest stars are many and they are very well used, from Kelly Preston to Kid Rock to Leah Remini.

The plot is basically Kirstie battling her weight and trying to get back on TV. In the same vein as ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" Kirstie has multiple social blunders per episode. Her blunders are very overstated (for lack of a better word) and can lie outside the realm of believability which is my only complaint. Even so, the scenarios are quite funny if not believable.",1169856000,4,1110,4.687179487179487

2258219,4,B0008ENIWK,I had never seen the show on tv but my fiance had and loved it. I perchased it and I have only watched one episode and that is enough for me.

2258220,5,B0008ENIWK,"I don't have Showtime at home, but had heard about this series, so took a chance and bought the DVD set. I've always liked Kirstie Alley, and after seeing this all-too-brief first season, appreciate her even more. Like another wonderful, mostly-improvised show, HBO's CURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM, this one follows Alley's plight as she tries to rebuild a sagging (no pun intended) career and wrestle with her considerable weight problem. (How brilliant to create a character that is at once bigger than life and yet who suffers some of the same demons we all deal with.) Take note, also, of some of the camera angles that go out of the way to show Alley at her worst, and you appreciate how brave she was to do this comedy about her shortcomings. Add in some very funny situations and excellent ensemble support, and you have a show that will make you laugh out loud time and again. (In one episode, she starts dating an older billionaire who turns out to have a quirky, over-emotional personality. I laughed so hard at actor Bill Smitrovich's star turn as the billionaire that I think I hurt myself. In another equally funny episode, Wallace Shawn plays Dr. Sigmund von Oy, whose theories Alley embraces in an attempt to try anything that might remotely help her lose weight.) It seems that this first season and its seven episodes will probably be the extent of this show; once Alley's weight is fully off the show won't play particularly well. Meanwhile, we  have these seven in which a fifty-something actress fighting the pounds shows us the flip side of glamour, and makes us realize even the rich and famous suffer the same challenges we all do.  Highly recommended!",1146873600,,1666,4.7612456747404845
2258221,4,B0008ENIWK,"This is a great DVD set if:

1) You really like Kirstie Alley

2) You have no issues with profanity

3) You've got a slightly warped sense of humor, a la Spinal Tap or Best in Show

4) You appreciate self depecrating humor

5) You have no trouble with the idea that her male assistant sleeps with Blossom in a plot to help Kirstie befriend her neighbor, Gwen Stefani (I'm not making this up)

Personally, I thought this show was somewhat bizarre and yet among the most hysterical shows I've seen in ages. How many overweight women would make fun of themself and walk around in a robe with minimal makeup? I thought it was incredibly brave of Kirstie, and it gave me new respect for her. I shared it with about a half dozen people right after I first watched it. Of them, four people loved it, one hated it and one just thought it was all right. So it's not for everyone.

The show walks a line between funny/odd and just plain out there, with story lines that find Kirstie one of the ""forgotten"" Charlie's Angels (along with a midget and a Canadian), and taken in by the ""Koi"" diet in which she is supposed to think small and surround herself with small things in order to get thin to her obsessing about befriending her neighbor, Gwen Stefani, so people will think she's cool. Sometimes, the shows end weakly, and as someone else noted, I think the fault was due to loose writing, and not reigning in the stories. But regardless, it's still funny. The guest stars are wonderful, especially an appearance by Wallace Shawn (""My Dinner with Andre"" and ""Princess Bride""). Blossom is freakin' hysterical.

One tip - listen to the commentary on the first episode and the other ones with Kirstie and the cast. (Skip the ones with the director/writer, they're boring.) They're not great as commentary really, since they're all talking over each other and making jokes -- but they're hysterical, yet touching. She laments that she probably should have married John Travolta, and offers some interesting reflection on herself in series, She'd obviously slimmed down by the time she made the commentary. She almost cries at one point. ""I thought I'd have to be padded up for this scene, but look at me, I'm huge..."" It's very sweet, and it makes you love her all the more.",1144281600,2,2262,4.5955334987593055

2258223,1,B0008ENIWK,I ordered this dvd series because I liked Kristy Alleys performance in other movies and series. But this is totally different.

2258225,3,B0008ENIWK,"Kirstie Alley is such a wonderful comic actress: from Cheers to the Look Who's Talking movies, to Veronica's Closet, to Drop Dead Gorgeous, as well a number of other, smaller roles, she's shown us all time and again that she's more than capable of delivering the laughs. Also, she's an extremely likeable sort of screen presence, she's got a beautiful sort of vulnerability that alternates with a hard-as-nails bitchiness that's a joy to watch. I was looking very much forward to the release of 'Fat Actress', a pseudo-documentary style show that showcases Alley's current weight-and-career-related nightmares.

Starring alongside Alley are Rachael Harris as Kevyn Shecket, a quirky and shrill personal assistant, and Bryan Callen as Eddie Falcon, Alley's put-upon male secretary. As an ensemble, this trio works extremely well together, their charisma and zeitgeisty carrying-on is hugely suited to this style of show. Also, there's a huge and expansive roster of cameo appearances by more professionally fortunate actors - John Travolta, Mayim Bialik, Kid Rock, McG, Edie McLurg, Leah Remini and Carmen Electra, to name but a few. Also, some of the plots are essentially very funny - Kirstie tries a bizarre 'think smaller' diet, Kirstie's drug-and-alcohol addicted family shows up while she's waiting for Oprah's TV Crew, she's given the Hope diamond by a needy billionaire, and gets thrown in jail for being caught cruising with a group of gay men - one of whom is her ex-lover.

So why didn't 'Fat Actress' work, then? Lousy writing, I think. For every solid, belly-laugh joke, there's a number of totally unfunny one-liners and situations. Also, there's an odd lack of decisiveness about the show - the first two episodes could be reality television, but subsequent episodes just come off as mundane sitcom. All the charisma in the world couldn't have saved the final two epsidoes from unfunny mediocrity.

And it's truly a shame, this could have been such a wonderful series, had the producers stuck to the foulmouthed fly-on-the-wall style of the first few episodes. It's sad - albeit unsurprising - that this was cancelled, but if you're an Alley fan, or simply curious about this show, I can recommend this for purchase, for no other reason than to own a genuine television curio.

Come back soon, Kirstie!",1138924800,,2316,5.119047619047619

2258227,5,B0008ENIWK,"I have seen every episode at least 100 times. First off, Kirstie is brilliant in this. If any of you are doubting the show due to other reviews, and the bad publicity it has gotten please refrain from doing that.

We have a series of guest stars including Leah Remini, John Travolta, Blossom [yes, I know thats not really her name but thanks to this show I am forever stuck calling her that], Kelly Preston [who plays Kirsties ""diet counselor""], and several others.

Rachael Harris, best known as her work on the I Love The..series and, The Daily Show is phenomenal and carries out most of the scenes as does Brian Callen, from Mad TV.

Having struggled with dieting issues my entire life, I can oddly relate to the show and I get the humor. I only wish that there were more shows out there like this. It amazes me that the world can embrace Curb Your Enthusiasm but they will not embrace something as brilliant as this.

I have always loved Kirstie Alley, and I think she still looks hot even with the weight, this coming from a gay man. Review time! Well, it is rated TV MA for a reason! The language is nuts! I don't like to hear Kirstie talk like she does on this. On the plus side, Rachael Harris and Bryan Callen are in it. Bryan Callen was on MadTV, most remembered as the character PoolBoy. I think Rachael Harris was on The Daily Show With Jon Stewart for a bit. This season is only 7 episodes long, about 30 minutes each. This show isn't really laugh-out-loud funny. One reviewer said to not eat or drink while watching this, but I think that's a bit extreme. It has it's own unique wit, but it's not gonna make your sides hurt with laughter, it's more entertaining than funny. One episode deals with using crack, which seems inappropriate to me. Wasn't this show cancelled by ShowTime?",1125964800,3,1039,4.360824742268041
2258229,4,B0008ENIWK,"When I first read reviews there were only two, both negative, which made me curious because I have NEVER seen Kirstie Alley do bad work.  I think she is a brilliant actress, and she seems to be a very smart, savvy, sexy woman.  So I had to get this DVD, and the Walmart price of $16 made the decision easier (since there are only 7 episodes with a few side dishes).  The first episode was disappointing, but perserverance paid off and the remainder of the DVD is excellent.  Supposedly this is unscripted (whatever that means in Hollywood-speak), and if so, that just makes it all the more amazing that the dialogue and acting is so extremely sharp and funny.  There were times though that I felt they could have created a bigger budget for the writers and the director.  There are some times, especially in the first episode, wherein Kirstie comes off as a brunette Anna Nicole Smith.  All in all, I liked it and I would watch the show if it had a new full season.  I just don't know how they could keep an audience's prolonged attention if they don't change the premise a little bit and `flesh' it out.",1125187200,2,1104,4.430693069306931

2258231,5,B0008ENIWK,"If Kirstie Alley were not lampooning with sly genius the same people that have tortured her for the past 15+ years, this show would be sinful.  Instead, it is a sardonic trashing of Hollywood virtues that will have you laughing so hard that there should be a warning to stop the DVD before you attempt to eat or drink.  All the reviews that complain that it is boring or embarrassing miss the point:  this is sophisticated, brutal, witty, sharp comedy of the highest level with great actors, including many of Ms. Alley's friends.  She is in on the joke, she has had enough, and she is ready to speak out.  Stand back.  I have heard that Showtime wants to bring the series back, but is unsure whether to do so now that she has lost weight.  You knuckleheads!! Kirstie Alley will figure this out!

2258233,5,B0008ENIWK,"I had absolutely no expectations for the show, and stumbled acrossed it by accident. I LOVE the way Kirstie Alley makes fun of herself, almost before you can. The show is a little twisted with some bizarre humor. Either you love that kind of stuff, or you hate it. I love it! I've had all of my friends watch the shows and they think they're hilarious too. The cast is awesome, all quirky in their own ways.

If you're looking for a mentally stimulating, politically correct, intellectual show, this isn't for you. If you want to check your brain at the door and have some laughs, buy this DVD!!!",1122595200,2,596,4.467889908256881
2258234,1,B0008ENIWK,"Kirstie Alley Weighs herself......then spends the next 5 min screaming and moaning on the bathroom floor.  That beginning says it all about this series, unrealistic, way over the top, irritating but not very funny aside from a few scenes with former ""Blossum"" Myam Bialik.  I like Kirstie Alley's no B.S. attitude and I like the premise of this series, I just think she very much over did it.  Audiences fled it in droves after it's well rated premier.  Buy this DVD if you would like to see why.",1121126400,5,496,4.6022727272727275
2258235,1,B0008ENIWK,"The show might be great for some TV watchers, but I must say it is a very boring show and has a very dumb script.

If you are looking for stupid jokes, you could watch it.

But if you are looking for some smartly written jokes, go and watch ""SATC"", ""Friends"" or anything else.

It was such a waste of money for me to have bought this DVD and yes, I regret it.",1120953600,5,359,3.8904109589041096
2258236,4,B0008ENIWK,"This is a much stronger show than I would have expected, given what I didn't see as a very strong premise.  But with great writing, an excellent cast, and Kirstie Alley anchoring the show with still-strong comedic instincts, this has turned out to be one of TV's better comedies.

A strong supporting cast really helps this show, with Rachael Harris and Bryan Callen both providing excellent foils for Alley.  Kelly Preston has a small but funny recurring role, and their are some hilarious guest turns - I especially enjoyed Kevin Nealon's turn as a Specter-esque producer, and Bill Smitrovich as an emotional suitor to Alley.

The first episode is the weakest of the bunch, but that's likely because it had to be used to set up the rest of the season and to introduce the players.  After that, the show quickly begins to arc sharply upward, and there are some truly hilarious and memorable scenes in each episode.  It would have been nice to have more than 7 episodes, but I have to credit HBO with never trying to squeeze too much out of a show.

If you like Kirstie Alley, and if you're a fan of other semi-reality comedies like Curb, you're sure to enjoy this show.  A great first season, and a show well worth watching.",1119571200,7,1225,4.587155963302752
2258237,5,B0008ENIWK,"Kirstie Alley can arguably be called a genius, in that; she can turn the life of her middle-aged, overweight self and make a television series out of it.  She simply lampoons herself in an (allegedly) unscripted parody of her (allegedly) real life.  It works.  Surrounded by unprofessional and `quick-buck' Hollywood sleazebags, Kirstie serves up some delicious moments.  Every episode works, but some standouts are her family (a drunk father, a ditzy mother, and a crack addict brother).  He tries to convince her that loosing weight with crack is the way to go, instead of having Oprah redo her kitchen.  Another knockout episode has her cavorting with `little people' in `little houses' as a way to get small by ""thinking"" small.  It's so weird, it hilarious.  Don't forget about the episode where she takes the advice of Kelly Preston (as a real bitch weight loss guru) and consumes too many laxatives and has to have a lunch meeting with some executives.  The bathroom scenes are hilarious (""Oh!  You're Kirstie Alley!  Will you sign my baby's Diaper?"").  Now it seems she will supplement her income by working for Jenny Craig.  Alley makes the world work around her and that's a rarity.",1119398400,4,1192,4.9296482412060305
2258238,5,B0008ENIWK,"When I first read that she was doing a show about being a ""Fat Actress,"" I had some skepticism about just  how funny a show could be about someone being fat and not getting work but it appears Kirstie has taken that premise and run with the joke. Upon viewing one episode I knew that I was in for a good ride so I bought the entire DVD (since I don't have Showtime). You can tell Kirstie is making, not only fun of Hollywood, but of herself and I have been laughing hysterically at all the episodes. She is not only great but her supporting cast is wonderful as well. And you can't forget the writing. In this day of throw away sitcoms, this one is one of the better shows out there now.

When Emmy time comes around, I hope she is on the nominee list. She deserves it.",1119139200,18,769,4.12
2258239,3,B0008ENIWK,Ok.... Kind of funny but... she's making a fool of her self! For real! She's fat but so what?? This is so beneath her....,1118880000,4,121,4.083333333333333
2258240,5,B0008ENIWK,"I absolutely LOVE this show! It is one of the most genius shows on cable! I love how it depicts being a fat actress in today's ""stick figure"" Hollywood, and how controversial, yet funny it is. (i.e. trying to put a decorative feather down her throat to throw up, having her crackhead brother try to convince her that crack is a great way to lose weight), or using her female persuasion to have ""partial sex"" with the President of NBC to get a $2 million development deal. This show will have you laughing your ass off!! You won't regret buying it!",1118102400,10,547,4.425742574257426
2258241,5,B0008ENIWK,"Ever since I heard that Kirstie was going to star in a show making fun of her weight I was happy. Happy because she was not gonna let it bring her down. I had seen lots of promo pictures where they make her look huge, much more than she really is. Her hair is 80s big. She is still very beautiful, and her voice is still so sexy and funny.

I was really looking forward to this and I have just watched 2 eps. It is very funny, some scenese stand out, like the beginning of the second one when she tries to find her fat pants LOL

But often, it is so cruel I feel sorry for her, so much fun is being made of her weight that I feel sorry for her, she doesn't deserve it. I feel bad for her like when in the future, maybe when she's lost all the weight, she'll look back at this, and feel so bad for being such a spectacle.

I hope not, she's a great gal. I hope that she'll lose weight and keep the show running and that she'll be in demand like before. Luv",1117756800,2,955,3.8622448979591835
8055823,4,B0008ENIWK,"Surprisingly funny for a one-trick pony premise, and that's also the reason it only ran for a single season on Showtime!  But, I noticed something really interesting about the cast:  several are prominent followers of the controversial religion, Scientology!  Both Alley and [guest-stars] John Travolta and wife Kelly Preston have all promoted their church publicly, while other cast members such as Kevin Nealon and [the late] Geoffrey Lewis have been more circumspect.  It makes me wonder if perhaps this series was partially-produced  by the church's media branch, Golden Era Productions? Not that it makes a difference... it's still funny for the most part.",1513814400,,661,5.378640776699029

8055826,4,B0008ENIWK,"This is just an FYI. I purchased on Amazon last year. Paid a few dollars more which is fine. I failed to notice even though it was the complete season, that it's only 230 minutes run time. I tried to fairly compare this with current shows, not ""back in the day"" shows. LOL. A currently running show that has it's first season on DVD is 530 minutes run time and is a similar price. No issues with price, quality or the show. It was an honest description that I failed to notice.",1478390400,,477,4.195652173913044
