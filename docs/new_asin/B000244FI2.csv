8324417,2,B000244FI2,"I have a healthy appreciation for 'bad' movies and for sexploitation films, and it's very rare for me to watch one of these films and not like it. If you watch a film expecting it to be bad, and it meets those expectations, then it's less of a disappointment. This film is one of the few I've watched that was disappointing.

The main character goes to a beach house alone for vacation. She meets the various neighbors and voyueristically watches them. Seems like a promising plot for sexploitation/soft core erotic film. the problem is this film throws in irrelevant subplots and not all of them get resolved. In the end, the film is more disappointing than entertaining.",1298764800,2,672,4.743589743589744
