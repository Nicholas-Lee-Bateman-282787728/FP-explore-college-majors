2603064,5,B000GAKJAA,"Some reviews are a little harsh here.  If you are a POLICE fan, you knew Stewart had his SUPER 8 camera in hand throughout and it is GREAT to see some of what he shot, even if the film is not a perfect overview of the history of the band.  For the footage from the DE DO DO DO video to STING recording CANARY IN A COALMINE, this is GREAT suplementary footage to have for any POLICE collection.  One reviewer complains of spending $10?  This is the kind of stuff you would pay $100 for a bootleg of at collector's shows.  I am glad STEWART took the time to assemble this and offered it up to the fans!  Bravo!",1160092800,16,608,4.067226890756302
2603065,3,B000GAKJAA,"Not what I expected but not nearly as bad as some of the reviews(""K Tarin"" likes to write a LOT of negative reviews, for example. lol).  I figured that if Stewart Copeland had 50 hours of video saved that this would make for an interesting documentary right? Well... not quite.  There are way too many time lapse shots from hotel windows and most of the documentary is just funny moments between band members and their road crew.  You won't see a lot of behind the scenes/in the recording studio moments or things of that sort, that's for sure.  It's true there is not a lot of concert footage but, for me, that's ok.  That's not why I bought the DVD in the first place.  The commentary with Stewart Copeland and Andy Summers is, for the most part, interesting and should be heard.  The biggest letdown of all is that Sting has had no involvement with this for whatever reason.  I saw him on a talk show with Robert Downey Jr. and no mention of this DVD was even brought up.  Even though it's not quite what I expected, I like this and any Police fan should buy it.  There's not a lot of revelations or full songs played in concert(I think I heard about 10 seconds of ""Every Breath You Take"" somewhere in the film during a recording studio segment) but I personally didn't expect that when I heard it was from Copeland's 50 hours of home video he had saved all these years.  Worth a look and it's cheap enough price-wise.",1159833600,2,1421,4.385496183206107

I hate to have to say it but I was tremendously disapointed with ""Everyone Stares.""

I'm a huge Police fan. They were the first band I ever loved. I heard ""Can't Stand Losing You"" as a 13-year-old kid in 1983 and I was gone, loved 'em, bought every album and listened to each song over and over, with no skipping around or anything.

I even like ""Mother,"" off ""Synchronicity,"" *that's* how big a Police fan I am.

And I'm also a huge Stewart Copeland fan. I've always thought he didn't get enough credit for his work or his side projects, particularly ""Rumble Fish.""

But ""Everyone Stares"" is kind of a drag. It consists of Copeland's Super-8 footage which he apparently shot during every waking moment of the Police's career -- their early van-packed touring days, their moment of ascension, their superstardom, dinnertime, naptime....

Basically what you get is lots and lots of muddy handheld camera work. It's admirable that he got all this stuff, but it's all basically studios, crowds, planes, trains, cars, stages. And that's kind of Copeland's point -- that being in a big band like the Police is bizarre and disorienting.

But it feels like there needs to be more substance than just a series of home movies.

Copeland's subjects -- Sting, Andy Summers, fans, roadies -- bascially react to his lens in one of three ways: 1) they mug for the photographer, 2) they act a little uncomfortable, like Ross McElwee is hiding being the Super-8 and primarily 3) they snarl and/or growl, ""Get that camera off me!""

Some music movies make you want to rush out and hear the tunes by a particular band, but this film actually made me weary of them. I'm glad Copeland was able to get what he got in terms of performance footage, but mostly we see/hear multiple muddy live versions of a the same few songs, mostly ""So Lonely.""

Copeland's narration also hurts the film. He's a very nice, very smart guy, and I know he wanted to tell his own story, but the writing is lazy and twee and feels a little disingenuous. Stuff like, ""We were riding a wave of this new music called 'punk,'"" ""Success was just around the corner and we wanted our share,"" ""The touring life began to seem normal and the homelife began to seem surreal.""  Copeland himself doesn't even seem to buy the ""gee whiz"" tone of what he's saying.

Anybody who disagrees with me on this film is probably going to say that I'm looking for a different documentary, and I'm sure one day there'll be a finely reported examination of who the Police are and all that factors that made up, say, ""Zenyatta Mondatta"" and ""Ghost in the Machine.""

But in just trying to give a band's eye view, Copeland has made something that's so close to the center of the storm, you don't get any sense of any of the overall aspects of the storm itself -- what contributed to it, what it affected, how it came about and how it all ended.",1158537600,12,2873,4.546511627906977
2603067,5,B000GAKJAA,"These days, it's hard to be a Police fan.

The band broke up 20 years ago, and A&M records isn't exactly burning up the retail shelves with *new* Police releases in the US.  So this DVD release is something NEW and very welcome for long suffering Police fans.  Just when you think there isn't anything else to learn about The Police, this DVD sheds new light.

The DVD itself is from the perspective of Stewart Copeland, Police drummer and a man considered to be one of the great living drummers.  Starting in the late 70's, Stewart routinely filmed tours, video shoots, and recording sessions with his ""Super 8"" camera.  What results is the most ""inside"" documentary of a band you could imagine... one filmed by a core member of the band over many years.  The resulting film is the story of the rise of one of the greatest bands in Rock And Roll history, culled from over 50 hours of Stewart's private footage.

What can be found here are Stewart's memories of the history of the band, wonderful ""derangements"" (remixes and rearrangements) of classic Police songs, 20 minutes of extra footage, and an excellent DVD commentary track by Stewart and Police guitarist Andy Summers.

The only negative ""warning"" I would have regarding this DVD is the quality of the Super 8 source footage.  If you are expecting modern day HD level of quality, you will be disappointed.  Having said that, the Super 8 footage has been digitally transferred and color corrected well for the DVD.  It looks good given its age and source quality.

If you are a fan of music history in general, you will enjoy this DVD.  If you are a Police fan, you should drop what you are doing and buy this DVD.

Dan

PS:  If there is any justice in this world, Stewart's ""derangements"" will be released on an audio CD.  They are an amazing listen for this longtime Police fan.",1158451200,4,1839,4.6061538461538465
2603068,5,B000GAKJAA,"""I blame the man holding his camera for all of my problems.""

It's the final scene of ""Everyone Stares"" that kept running through my mind after seeing the film for the first time. This is not so much because of Sting's parting words as quoted above, but more the image itself, and how much more it seems to be telling us than what directly meets the eye. We see Andy and Sting, though Stewart's ""eyes"" via the camera lens, as they are all handcuffed to the railing of a precarious-looking staircase perched high above a city. The reasons for this unusual predicament are never quite explained, but it seems to make a telling statement about the band itself at that particular moment of time: cramped and trapped together at the top, and dangerously close to falling over the edge.

To those critics who have claimed that this film has no depth to it? I say that clearly, you simply weren't paying enough attention.

This film is not a strictly linear, fact-laden and/or impartial documentary. Neither is it the expose of ""sex, drugs and rock and roll"" (emphasis on sex and drugs) that some curiosity-seekers seemed determined it should have been and were disappointed that it wasn't. Instead, it is a fractured, personal collection of video ""snapshots"", capturing the small moments of life on the road as well as the absurdities and monotonies of becoming a rock star. For the well-versed Police fans, it is also a chance to experience the thrill of seeing events, concerts, and even photo-sessions from a perspective we've never seen before. It begins with a clever montage sequence of animated photographs as Stewart sets the scene with his narration, covering the early days of the band until he purchases his Super 8 camera, and suddenly the action really takes off, in more ways than one.

There is an interesting, dreamlike quality to the entire movie, which seems to come from the Super 8 footage itself: it is somewhat grainy, rendering every scene in a softer focus than we are used to on a big screen. As cars, boats, people, clouds and cities zoom by in time-lapse footage, and as stage lights blur past the camera when Stewart rushes on stage or struggles to get through crowds of fans, this sense of ""unreality"" slowly builds and at times it becomes almost dizzying. (It is also hard to believe that the Derangements were not written specifically for the soundtrack of this film, as they provide the perfect mixed-up/familiar-yet-different mood for everything we see, and the lyrics sometimes provide interesting and clever accents to the particular moments being shown.)

As for individual scenes themselves, I actually don't want to talk too much about my favorites, because a great deal of the enjoyment of them comes from being surprised by what you get to see, as well as the amusing little ""subtitles"" or comments Stewart adds to them. I think the first-time viewer is better off getting to experience that surprise for him or herself. Suffice to say the audience--particularly the avid Police fan--is likely to be incredibly amused and delighted at many moments, and wrapped up in the story overall as we get to experience it as if we were a member of the band ourselves.

While all seems to be fun and games at first, the cracks within the band slowly begin to start surfacing as the film progresses. It's presented with subtlety, not with in-your-face fights and screaming contests. It comes through more in small comments in Stewart's narration, as that ""unreality"" builds and we start to get the underlying sense that all is not as well as it might seem. The piles of money may be growing, but weariness and unease is settling in. The hotel rooms may be growing bigger, but they seem to have become more like prison cells than the familiar, cozy havens on the road they were years before. Indeed, it seems as though the band members have all become literally and figuratively handcuffed to that ivory tower, and as Stewart says near the end, it's time to break free from it all and really ""learn what this life is all about.""

In its own unique, quirky way, I'd say that ""Everyone Stares"" is just as revealing an autobiography as Sting's ""Broken Music"" was a few years ago. It's a piece of the Police story we've been missing, and as a fan, I have to say it makes me feel now that the story is complete in a way I didn't feet it was at all, three years ago after the Hall of Fame ceremony.

The DVD itself comes with some truly great extra features as well, most especially the audio commentary track by Copeland and Summers. Their comments and stories fill in the details of what we see on screen in the movie and make it all the more enjoyable on further viewing. Extra scenes include some humorous moments as well as a collection of ""Live Shards"", small sequences of live performances that didn't make the film but make for interesting viewing nevertheless.

A great film and a great DVD. All this fan could ask for!",1158192000,62,4943,4.705202312138728
2603069,5,B000GAKJAA,"It was amazing to this powerful trio from an angle that only the famous would ever be able to.  Even if you are not a fan, I definitely recommend this just to see what it was like to be as BIG as you can possibly be in the music industry.  For fans- DO NOT MISS THIS DVD! It will put you right on stage with The Police.  The only thing I wish that this DVD had more of was the infamous inner fighting that supposedly caused the end of the group.",1157068800,2,445,3.868131868131868
2603070,5,B000GAKJAA,"I was lucky enough to attend a screening of this film here in Los Angeles. Afterwards, Stewart had a Q&A session with the audience. Andy Summers, who basically stole the show in this film, was in attendance as well. It was quite fascinating to watch the inner workings of this band as they grew, not only in popularity, but in their own lives - emotionally and with each other. You can witness for yourself the excitement of a screaming crowd or being mobbed by fans after the show. The tedium of recording albums, doing interviews or photo shoots, or the dreadful aspect of constant travel. I have seen some of this super-8 footage before, but the majority I had not. The quality varies as the years go by, and the musical performances are too brief for my tastes, but I still enjoyed this film tremendously. I had taken a friend to the screening who hadn't had much exposure to the band previously, and they walked away amazed. Sting was not in attendance, but both Andy and Stewart freely chatted with fans and signed autographs, easily the most approachable musicians I have ever chatted with. Stewart was witty as always during the Q&A, and he promised to make the DVD release worthwhile. I hope he kept his promise.",1156982400,5,1221,4.631336405529954

2603095,3,B000GAKJAA,"My major problem with this movie is that it's lazy. No one uses the time in front of the camera to do anything more than clown around. Copeland is a smart guy, but for some reason chose to make a dull movie.

It has documentary value, presenting a compressed view of years of touring (and some studio moments). But much of this footage just confirms how repetitive and boring this kind of life tends to be.

I had hoped to get an insight into a mystery that had puzzled me--the unproductiveness of this band. Five albums in five years, no additional songs as singles, and the albums were made very quickly, containing a lot of filler material. Copeland has compared The Police to the Beatles, but there were far fewer songs, and of much lower ambition (the chord sequence to ""Every Breath you Take"" is nothing more than ""Heart and Soul"" revamped). With all that time sitting around in dressing rooms or on tour buses, why didn't they use it to do what they were supposed to be doing--making music? This collection of home movie clips doesn't offer any answers. There are basically a lot of shots of people doing nothing.",1371081600,,1120,4.567164179104478

Now as an adult, I was very nostalgically excited to see this film come about.  But 10 minutes into the film I was ready to turn it off, only continued watching because of my youthful obsession.  Boring and boorish.  Steward Copeland doesn't come across well, his narration making me wince on multiple occasions.  I'd skip this one, even if you are a die-hard fan.",1310256000,,508,4.7272727272727275
2603100,3,B000GAKJAA,"I honestly would enjoy watching this.  I have always admired Stewart Copeland's musical ability (and not only his gift of percussion: HE taught picturesque lil' ""Sting"" exactly WHERE to play the bass lines on the Police' first hit, ""Roxanne""), and Andy Summer's a phenomenal ""less is more"" guitar style.  But: I simply cannot, in all good conscience, purchase ANYTHING with that malignant, self-righteous hypocrit ""Sting"" in it.  And since ""Sting"" is/was the ""frontman"" of the Police...well...I guess I'll wait till this comes out on ""late-nite TV"" to view it....",1302566400,,563,5.303370786516854
2603113,3,B000GAKJAA,"""Everyone Stares"" is like being invited over to Stewart Copeland's house to watch old movies he shot during his years in The Police as he talks over it.  Really it's more like having heard from a friend that they got to do that and then they tell you about it as it's at a remove.  It's fun to see the footage, but as a documentary there's no real insight or new information as Copeland is extremely respectful towards the notoriously prickly Sting as it probably took all three to clear the music that was used throughout the film as well as their very presences on screen.  It feels like the kind of footage that would be made available to a real documentarian who would then use it in a better film, but as it's own document it's fun to hear the music and see what it was like on those early tours, but only if your a fan.",1284422400,,825,4.208860759493671
2603114,4,B000GAKJAA,"I have been a fan of Stewart Copeland for 30 years. The Police were my first foray into the new wave/post punk era. I love this film because it's by my favorite band member.

It's a wonderful chronicle of the beginning one of the the best bands of the 1980s. We see them start off like any other band; traveling in a beat-up van. Then they go to the US and find that they have to get their even more beat-up van to venues in a bigger country.

I've read reviews of this film. Many critics have found it to be ""repetitive"" and ""redundant."" But isn't that touring, in a nutshell?

did shoot and how he put it all together is a fun ride with the group. Stewart also created a soundtrack for his
film by re-editing Police studio and live multi-tracks to create something new. And it works! My only complaint is
that even though the box and disc itself state that the DVD is encoded with both DTS and Dobly Digital 5.1, they
were not encoded in the mastering and manufacturing of this title. I've notified Stewart's web site about this

2603118,5,B000GAKJAA,"Since I was only 5 years old in 1977, I don't have any recollection of The Police in the early days. As a `tween' I was hooked on the popular MTV videos (""Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic"", etc.), and in college I bought a cd of their `Greatest Hits'.

The point is I was NOT a die-hard Police fan--that is, until I bought the `Certifiable' DVD/CD from the re-union tour. And then that was it.  I had to hear more, know more, see more. I had a LOT of catching up to do.

I've always listened to Sting.  But the music by The Police was entirely different.

And the primary reason is Stewart Armstrong Copeland.

Thanks, to `You Tube', I began watching snippets of old Police concerts and footage and it's clear that this band was extraordinary. Their music is NEVER the same twice.  Stewart modifies the drum patterns, Sting changes up the vocals and bass, and Andy plays around with the guitar riffs.  So I recently bought ""Message in a Box"", a few live concerts, Stewart's studio albums and a few of his film scores.  And after finally appreciating and understanding the depths of this band's sheer and raw talent, I had to get this film, too.

And it was worth every penny.  Any Police fan should have this in their collection. PERIOD. This footage is priceless.

Some memorable scenes include (SPOILER ALERT):
1) Sting lugging around his bags and gear to cheap motels
2) Andy `trashing' the candy store
3) Andy getting his makeup done
4) Stewart recording himself jamming during a live concert (MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE SCENE--WATCHED REPEATEDLY)

Throughout the film, Stewart's narration and the scrolling captions are witty and humorous. And the live concert footage and music, of course, makes a wonderful background.

I really tried to find something wrong with this film, but I couldn't.
It was just the right length (although I wouldn't have complained if it was longer).
The technology was what it was, so you can't find fault with the grainy-ness of the film.
This film is part of music history and part of these talented musicians' lives and I am eternally grateful that Stewart recorded and shared these memories with us.

And if I should ever be lucky enough to run into Stewart, say at a book-signing for his memoir this fall, I'll try not to stare.",1236211200,7,2264,4.653266331658291

Copeland's narration starts off slightly awkward but morphs into something better and more thoughtful, and drops some interesting clues as to the reasons for breakup.  If you love the band as much as I do, then this is well worth it - just don't expect an exhaustive fly-on-the-wall approach to the material.

I recently saw them at Giant Stadium in NJ for the second time. There will never be another band like them, and if they tour again in 5 years and Im 50 or even 60 for that matter I'll go see them again. I have yet to see three musicians produce that kind of creativity and energy in their music.

A recent article in Rolling Stone mentioned that the Sundance viewing of this movie was what started the ball rolling on the awesome reunion tour; Andy and Stewart were at the show, but Sting was not.  However, he surprised everyone by showing up at an after-party and the three turned heads by mugging it up that night.  And so it began.  (I also give a lot of credit to Sting having read Andy's awesome book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/One-Train-Later-A-Memoir/dp/031237481X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">One Train Later: A Memoir</a>, but hey, that's another review!)

As for the movie itself, it's great for fans.  There's rare footage of the famous early US tour-in-a-van that's just amazing, as well as lots of other early gigs.  Stewart re-mixes a bunch of Police tunes to great effect: I'd like a soundtrack please!  Overall, it's a great look at a band's humble beginnings and rocket rise to stardom in  just a few years, and shows the grind of tour-record-tour-record that the boys went through.  These guys were very driven and really put in the work to make it happen.  A great companion to the longer, but less focused Police: Around the World which I pray will come out on DVD soon.  Highly recommended.",1182816000,,1351,5.170506912442396

As much as I enjoyed the film, it also made me feel like I had missed out on something... something special.

From a filmmakers point of view, well, I come from the chain saw school of editing.  It could have been tighter.  It does linger a bit here and there.  But when you are dealing with something so personal, its hard to be objective.  So, I'll cut Mr. Copeland some slack and just say ""Thank you for letting us in.""",1180310400,,730,4.127659574468085

You really get a good feel for life on the road as the then little-known band treks across America's Heartland in the late 70s (note the t-shirt Sting wears during the recording of Zenyatta Mondatta: from Cain's Ballroom in Tulsa, Oklahoma!).  Even though Stewart Copeland shot this footage, the DVD would be a lot more watchable without his corny, hammed up narration throughout.  Bad, bad, bad.  But the music is still good!  If nothing else, this DVD will make you get out your Police CDs and revisit all those great songs for a couple days.",1178496000,,644,4.614035087719298
2603162,5,B000GAKJAA,"I am a long time Police fan, and am delighted that they decided to reunite at least for a tour (a couple of new songs are rumored...you never know). This is certainly a most interesting take from the inside of their unique experience. Stewart is The Kinetic Kid by definition, and often the images reflect this very non-stop, hyper-ADD aspect of his personality. Thank goodness for his being hyper, because he has given the world some of the finest drumming ever heard by human ears. The movie is really like entering Stewart's mind. I was surprised by his very professional, patient tone of voice, while I remember him as a very fast *duh!* talker. In particular, I appreciated the parts that show the genesis of the famous riffs etched in every fan's mind, and the claustrophobic feeling brought in by the non-stop assault of the fans, a little reminding of Hard day's night. You understand why worldwide success can also last so much, as can a musician's patience, focus, and inspiration. After all, it becomes a blur, and Stewart is masterful at conveying the feelings of the Man in a Suitcase's line: ""bird off a flying cage, you'll never get to know me well, the world's an oyster, a hotel room a prison cell"".
I was expecting more bitching at Sting - there is some, but not so bad as I had anticipated - therefore, our Kinetic Kid was also rather well-behaved. Maybe the passing of his beloved brother Ian and of the ""fourth member"" Kim Turner have somewhat changed the feelings that led to the acrimonious split of a great band at the very top of their game.",1177632000,4,1566,4.616487455197133

This video is for the dedicated Police fan and is a fine backstage look at the band members on the brink of superstardom. It is unfortunate that there aren't a broader variety of songs but Stew Copeland's jovial narration more than makes up for this with his jovial commentary. There is a great option to hear Andy Summers and Stewart discuss the film, it's too bad Sting's perspective is not a part of this interesting little documentary.",1174608000,,500,4.629213483146067
2603165,4,B000GAKJAA,"What is utterly, utterly fascinating about this film is that it literally follows them from the very beginning.  You get Stewart-shot Super 8 footage of them driving around America from tiny gig to tiny gig, hauling their own gear and staying at fleabag motels.  With a crew of... two.

Then things start to change.  The gigs start getting bigger, the crowds larger, the hotels nicer.  You are there the first time they return to England after one of their singles breaks and you see their awe as fans mob them at the airport.  Soon the touring van is replaced by touring bus which is then replaced by touring... plane.

It really, really is a voyeuristic, mindblowing look from their perspective, literally.  More from their perspective looking at the audience.  This is NOT a behind-the-scenes look at them in the studio, save for a few killer scenes from Zenyatta and Ghost.  No fights or arguments or groupies.

Truly eerie to see them from the very, very beginning.  Watch it with Stewart and Andy's commentary for the second time.  In fact, you could watch this the first time--it's a better narrative for what's going on.

BIGGEST BONUS: I don't know where they came from, but the whole film is littered with alternate takes and EARLY, early versions of classic Police songs that I have never heard before.  There's wild early takes on ""I Burn for You,"" ""Tea in the Sahara,"" songs from Ghost with piano on them that wasn't on the album.  Some of the songs are virtually unrecognizable from their eventual versions--only the lyrics give them away.

For any Police die-hard, you must see this.  It's basically home movies, but oh what movies they are.  Casual fans will probably not think much of this, and that's fine.

Casual fans wanting to get an early look at the Police should rent/buy the video ""Police Around the World.""

2603166,3,B000GAKJAA,"An interesting doc for 80s music fans.  Well over twenty years after the Police called it quits, it seems a good time to look back.  The documentary is not much - 71 minutes of familiar sights and sounds.  It was refreshing to hear a very wise, aged Stewart Copeland narrate.  It convinced me to hustle out and get ""Message in a Box"" the collected works of the Police.  We might never hear music like that again.",1174003200,,412,4.368421052631579
2603167,4,B000GAKJAA,"""I blame the man behind the camera for all my troubles.""

So says Sting, staring grimly off into the sunset, in the final scene of Stewart Copeland's ""Everyone Stares: The Police Inside Out"".  That scene alone would have garnered a hefty sum of money on video prior to the release of Copeland's hypnotic documentary, but in ""Everyone Stares"", Copeland does more: he provides us with a candid, no-holds-barred look at the journey that led Sting to make that defining comment.  In 1978, when a wannabe punk rock group calling themselves The Police had just released their first album, drummer and founder Copeland purchased a nifty new toy: a Super 8 camera, the precursor to the modern day camcorder.  During the following five years, Copeland documented the band skyrocketing from pretentious punks to rock gods.  It's a fascinating ride, and though it's not exactly a linear representation of the band's rise and - well, unofficial disbandment - it provides a clear and often appalling look at how the band and its members changed over time.

We don't see much of Copeland, save for in a few scenes.  One of the most memorable involves a well-documented fight between Sting and an audience member at a live performance.  Copeland places the Super 8 camera on a tripod behind him and, using a mic, turns around and explains the fight breaking out in front of us while doing some mindblowing drumming.  Guitarist Andy Summers shows up a lot, and is clearly a fun and colorful guy; early on it becomes clear why Summers was called the glue that held the band together all those years.  Sting is a ball of ferocious creativity from start to finish; the only different is that, at finish, his ego has taken control.  Copeland documents how Sting took control of the recording from ""Ghost in the Machine"" to ""Synchronicity"", shutting the rest of the band out, and how he forced the group to disband at the peak of their popularity.

""Everyone Stares"", which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in '06, is sort of a mixed bag.  It contains some wonderful footage that is really meaningful and demonstrative of the life and behavior of The Police and its members, but it also contains some ridiculous fooling-arounds of the band members that could be done without.  The film, which includes some headache-inducingly fast-paced and hallucinatory editing, has no smooth flow.  And Copeland's quirky narration, though funny at times, is often a little dull.  A big plus are Copeland's ""derangements"" of Police songs.

Personally, as a Police fanatic, I found ""Everyone Stares"" to be informative, interesting, but nothing wonderful.  Is it neat?  Oh yeah - for the Police fan.  However, if you're not a die-hard Police lover, this is not the film for you.  If you are, by all means give it a shot.  The DVD also includes some cool and equally informative deleted scenes (a few of which could have replaced the more unnecessary sequences of the film) as well as snippets of a few Police live performances and a bonus commentary with Copeland and Andy Summers.  All in all, ""Everyone Stares"" is a wonderful opportunity for Police diehards to walk in the footsteps of one of rock's all-time greatest bands, but the film will hold little appeal for anyone else.",1173830400,,3250,4.8584392014519056
2603168,3,B000GAKJAA,"Stewart Copeland's pseudo-documentary about The Police, assembled with footage he shot on a Super-8 camera during the band's heyday, is noteworthy because it captures their remarkably fast climb to stardom and offers some very honest insights into why the trio called it quits after only five albums. That the movie was entirely edited, narrated and scored by Copeland is quite an achievement.",1173312000,,393,5.354838709677419
2603179,4,B000GAKJAA,This DVD is not for the casual Police fan or someone just getting started with their music.  It is definitely for the hard core fan or someone interested in the behind the scenes.  It is rather quick and somewhat choppy in regards to the timeline of the Police.  Nonetheless this Stuart Copeland documentary is a must for the true fan.,1173312000,,335,4.55
2603180,5,B000GAKJAA,"I would assume anyone reading these reviews or looking at purchasing this DVD know who the Police were, and knows their music.  Knowing who they were is where this DVD takes off from, and it brings a 'behind the curtain' view of the performers across the years.  Stewart Copeland, the band's founder/drummer, glommed onto an 8mm sound camera and hung on as it commanded his soul.  The obsession with this camera grafted to his hand was evident in some of the early photo shoots and videos.  Now you can see all that footage edited down and put to a story of this famous rock band's rise to fame.

It starts with still photos from the earliest years and quickly transitions into the film as Stewart (and Andy Summers) procure their cameras.  Instead of getting a pre-polished, over packaged, over thought, mush glorification of the band you get the band, as themselves, filmed by one of them, narrated by the band (one, or two of them depending on the audio track).  Due to the film being a home effort, it wasn't taken with any specific purpose in mind other then Stewart having fun or documenting things of immediate interest in the day.  He experiments with stop motion, titles(Kim dumps a take?), time lapse, makes a fiction with Andy and supporting act, but more importantly he is holding the camera as the band starts touring as a stripped down, low rent act and builds to a gigantic world consuming success.  Looking back you can laugh sympathetically as Sting has to lug his suitcase and bass into the hotel room, or as he finds the limo at the airport isn't for him.  Then you see a rock star's pov as a surprise crowd mobs his band at the airport for the first time.  Clips of the band and crew all over the world, as well as silly, impromptu humor give the video a lively, warm feel.  It's a home movie!  But, it explains what the band did that you never saw.

There are two audio tracks.  The first is Stewart's narrative, and I found it adequate but a little boring.  Half way through the film I was wondering what I was doing watching, but it picked back up and got me through.  The second track is commentary by Stewart and Summers, and their comments make the film fly by as they explain the context of shots and also joke about the images.

Additional footage edited, but deemed important or entertaining, is lumped in the extras section.

If you loved the band, and want to see them in their more private spaces, then $10 is a pittance.  I thoroughly enjoyed this little trip to Uncle Stewart's basement movie night.",1172793600,12,2533,4.525274725274725
2603181,5,B000GAKJAA,"I was fortunate enough to see ""Everyone Stares"" on the big screen at the film's premiere during the Santa Barbara International Film Festival last year (Feb 06), and it's everything you hope an inside look at the band would be - once you get past the shaky footage and far-from-perfect sound. I think, as other reviewers will attest, this adds to the film's charm and re-enforces that it is ""real"" and not some recreation of actual events. I can't imagine anyone seeing this film who is not a fan of the Police, but if you are a fan, this film is a must-see for you. Oh - one great thing about seeing the film at the premiere: Stewart Copeland was there on stage at the relatively small theater for a Q&A following the film. It was very intimate - and the theater was so small, nobody needed microphones and so you felt like you were part of something really special. Stewart introduced Andy Summers who was sitting in the audience, and the two answered questions about everything - including, ""Will the Police get together for a reunion tour?"" Quite bluntly, Stewart said, ""No."" And moved on to other questions. Audience persistance lead him to say words to this effect (this is not a quote): ""Sting is on another planet in terms of his music today. Even in the Police, his mind was racing in other directions. Andy (Summers) and I felt so fortunate to hold onto him in the Police for as long as we did, but we couldn't hold on forever. There are no ill feelings, and we talk - but only rarely. So, no - there will be no reunion tour."" I'm writing this the morning after the Police performed at the Grammys last night - for the first time in more than 20 years.",1171238400,3,1662,4.416938110749186

Running the DVD with Stewart's and Andy's commentary turned ON is mandatory...Stewart may be a Beirut-born diplomat-brat American, but he shares Andy's wickedly dry and ironic British sense of humor. One can also detect the merest tinge of regret when he accepts Sting's half-serious pronouncement that Stewart is the ""cause of all my troubles."" [I paraphrase]  We also get a sense of the rather callow, prickly and tense person that the young, pre-megastar, pre-yogi Sting was. His great talent was likewise unmistakable.

For instance, there are a couple of shots where he has highlighted a certain person in the crowd, and until I watched it back with the commentary on, I had no clue what he was trying to say with that. It just looks like something you would put together on your home computer, which can sometimes be a good thing, but for my taste, not good here. OH! And correct me if I'm wrong, but are you jumping around in time a bit throughout? But hey, the music editing is great! LOVE the derangements! Even better than the originals if you ask me! But of course, we wouldn't expect any less from you there. I think some things you need to leave to the pros who do it for a living, Stewart. You wouldn't want a film editor sitting behind your drum kit, would you?(XOXO) But otherwise, very fun ride back into musical history with my all-time favorite band. Lots of new insights into their inner sanctum.  I pretty much felt like I was part of the band and could feel the excitement of (and sometimes fearfulness of) the rushing, screaming, rabid fans.

p.s. You have HOW many hours worth of footage, Stewart?  Give it to a pro and let them do their thing!",1163030400,,1416,4.430769230769231
2603223,5,B000GAKJAA,"This docu-movie, shot by the band's drummer, is a feast for fans, but equally fun for the common man. Really, it is well done and it's fun to see what it must have been like to have been them, there! Highly recommended!",1163030400,,219,4.238095238095238
2603224,5,B000GAKJAA,"I love this film either way, but I have to agree with those who found Stewart's narration a little glib and removed, particularly when his images are so personal and revealing of the band. I much preferred the commentary track with Stewart and Andy reminiscing over each scene. It has the same life and spontaneity present in his home movie footage, and you're given a much greater insight into their experience. Sometimes it's just the memory of a location, but often there are interesting facts you wouldn't have caught otherwise.

Now, a bone to pick with the Sting-haters. I'm no great fan of his Adult Contemporary solo career, but claims that he's pompous or pretentious in THIS film are really unfounded. The guy spends half the movie dancing and wrestling with Andy! In fact, all three act more like brothers on summer vacation than band-mates. Maybe it's not the whole story, but the Sting we see in ""Everyone Stares"" seems really genuine and excited about the success they're finding.

p.s. - check out the other extras!",1162598400,,1030,4.846590909090909
2603225,5,B000GAKJAA,"If you ever heard Stewart Copeland speaking in public (take podcast of 2004 O'Reily Conference for example) you already know that listening to the man is quite entertainig experience. Mr. Copeland is great storyteller with a sense of humour and it shows in the film. One other thing is that this movie is not your ordinary ""Behind the Music"" documentatry, but real-deal archive footage, straight from the center of events. C'mon, where else does a music fan get this kind of stuff? And lastly, Stewart's production chops are good - great editing, directing and scoring, all done by the man himself. I liked this DVD a lot.",1162080000,,622,4.822429906542056
2603226,4,B000GAKJAA,"For all those reviewers here yearning for a comprehensive Oscar-winning documentary, knowing darned well this was just clips from Stewarts's home movies, get a life! This is not that movie!! Talk to Scorcese about what you want, and quit yer whining.

This is a casual, sometimes heartfelt, always in-the-moment look at the glory days of the Police. Its way beyond a ""just cashing-in"" token effort, being a genuine first-person reminiscence about events most Police fans already know about. No big news, no, but a nice perspective.

More footage is shown for the band's early days, and the first 3 albums, than the big blockbuster tours and albums of the '80s. Almost nothing of the Synchronicity tour, which was kind of sad but when you think about it, haven't we already been inundated with images from that time?

The titles/captions are wonderful, sometimes hilarious. The narrative is simple, telling the story, and not pretending at any great philosophical insights. Its a personal memoir, from a musician who was there.  Personally, I think thats a pretty valuable thing for any Police fan.",1160697600,2,1097,5.0777777777777775
2603227,4,B000GAKJAA,"Stewart Copeland is the best rock-reggae drummer ever. Unfortunately, he's not a very good cinematographer. This movie starts out strong propelled by Stewart's narration. Towards the end however, the film loses interest. The general crappiness of the video and audio starts to weigh the film down around Ghost In The Machine. When he stops speaking, it really bogs down.

Still, this film is a must have for any Police fan as it partially documents their ascent to superstardom. It's funny that he had the presence of mind to start filming while playing So Lonely. ""Pretty flash"" alright.

In my opinion it was a poor decision to have a narrator read Stewarts words throughout the entire DVD.  It put me to sleep.  I would have appreciated an interview format more like Neal Pearts DVD.  The video footage was fantastic, but the context was diminished with impersonal reading.  It was like watching a home movie while some stranger poorly reads the family diary.",1440028800,,467,4.646341463414634
