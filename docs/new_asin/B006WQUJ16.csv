5026139,4,B006WQUJ16,"This set contains the entire Season 1 of the Pac-Man cartoon series from the 1980s.  Watch the adventures of Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, Pac Baby, their dog Chomp Chomp, and their cat Sour Puss.  Each episode also features the evil Mezmeron and his Ghost Monsters, who chase Pac-Man and scheme to try to find out where the Power Pellet Forest is.

The set has two discs, and they both come in a standard sized DVD case.  Disc 1 contains the following 9 episodes (each episode contains 2 stories):
- Presidential Pac-Nappers, Picnic in Pacland
- The Great Pac-Quake, Hocus-Pocus Pac-Man
- Southpaw Packy, Pac Baby-Panic
- Pacula, Trick or Chomp
- Super Ghosts, The Pac-Man in the Moon
- Invasion of the Pac-Pups, Journey to the Center of Pacland
- The Day the Forest Disappeared, Sir Chomp-A-Lot
- Neander-Pac-Man, Backpackin' Packy
- The Abominable Pac-Man, The Bionic Pac-Woman

Disc 2 contains the following 4 episodes:
- Chomp-Out at the O.K. Corral, Once Upon a Chomp
- The Pac-Love-Boat, The Great Power-Pellet Robbery
- A Bad Case of the Chomps, Goo-Goo at the Zoo
- The Pac-Mummy, Nighty Nightmares

It would have been nice if they listed the episodes on the discs themselves and/or on the back of the case, but they didn't.  The only way to know what episodes are on a disc is to play the disc and wait for the main menu (or you can read my review ;) ).

When you insert a disc, the FBI warning is displayed and you can't skip it.  That's not a big deal since it lasts about 5 seconds or so.  After the FBI warning you are taken to the main menu where you can select to play all episodes or just a single episode.

Each episode consists of the following:
- the opening sequence (30 seconds)
- the first story (about 11 minutes long)
- a 30 second intermission called Pac-Mania that shows either the ghost monsters trying a scheme to get Pac-Man and failing, or Sour Puss trying to pull a prank on Chomp Chomp and having it backfire.  I was pleasantly surprised by these intermissions as I had completely forgotten about them - they are short, cute and humorous.
- the second story (about 11 minutes long)
- the credits (30 seconds)

They put chapter breaks after each of the items - so there's a chapter break after the introduction, after the first story, after the Pac-Mania intermission, after the second story, and after the credits.  The chapter breaks let you easily skip items if you want by just pressing a button on your DVD player remote.

As far as picture quality goes - it looks pretty good for what it is, although I did notice some scenes that looked a little blurrier than other scenes.  Also, I did not see any digital artifacts such as pixelation/blockiness in fast moving scenes (something that has plagued a few other DVDs that I've bought), which means they did not use too much compression in putting the material onto the DVDs.  Ideally they would have been able to put all 13 episodes onto one DVD, but if they needed to split the episodes onto 2 DVDs in order to avoid using too much compression, then it's good that they did that.

Overall I'm happy with this set, and hope that they release Season 2 (the final season) soon.  Season 2 includes the ""Christmas Comes to Pacland"" episode.

Finally, there are 2 things that should be noted:
1) These discs are DVD-Rs and not pressed DVDs like most commercial DVDs are.  This is due to the fact that they are manufactured-on-demand when you order the set.  The top of the discs look very professional though (unlike another manufactured-on-demand DVD-R that I ordered), so some people may not even realize they are DVD-Rs.  If you look at the underside of the discs though, you will see the purple tint that is characteristic of many DVD-Rs.  There are some DVD players out there that have trouble playing DVD-Rs.

2) Disc 1 is a dual layer DVD (while Disc 2 is a regular single layer DVD).  There are some DVD players out there that have trouble playing dual layer DVDs.",1332028800,16,3945,4.568181818181818
5026140,5,B006WQUJ16,"It's here, the original 1980s cartoon based on the then-wildly popular arcade game, Pac-Man!!  Produced by Hanna-Barbera, the show brings to life many elements of this game as well as its successors, Ms. Pac-Man and Baby Pac-Man.

All three characters - Pac-Man, Pepper (Ms. Pac-Man), and Pac-Baby - and their pets Chomp-Chomp and Sour Puss pull together as a family as they fend off Pac-Land's five Ghost Monsters:  Clyde, Pinky, Inky, Blinky and Sue.  (Pinky, Inky and Blinky appeared in both the Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man video games; Clyde appeared in Pac-Man only, replaced by Sue in Ms. Pac-Man.)  The Ghost Monsters - each with their own unique mob-like personality - work for Mezmaron, whose mission is to seize the power pellets, Pac-Land's power source.  Most of the show's plots center on these battles.

The first season of Pac-Man, which did not feature Super-Pac or Pac-Man's nephew P.J., aired on the ABC network from 1982 to 1983 and contained 13 episodes.  Their titles are listed below, along with their original air dates.

5026150,4,B006WQUJ16,"My 6 year old daughter likes Pac-Man.  She was introduced to him via an old arcade game at the carwash by our house (the place has lots of old games. It's cool.)  I have purchased a few different Pac-Man related items for her.  This one is the latest.  She and her 10 year old sister have been watching this set almost daily since they got it for Xmas.  It's one of the DUMBEST shows I've ever seen but that is part of the fun.  I was born in the late 70s and grew up on Hanna-Barbera cartoons, so it's nostalgic for me.  But, for real, this is one of the worst cartoons ever.  It's the same thing over and over in every episode.  Also, Pac-Man leaves his baby son alone at home all the time, and tells the cat and dog to take care of him while he's out partying or chomping ghosts.  The character of Ms Pac-Man is really flat.  It's not well thought out at all but the colors are pretty and it's fun to hate on it with my kids.",1420329600,,928,4.016393442622951

5026159,4,B006WQUJ16,"Let me set the stage a little.  It's late December 1980.  I'm just turning two.  Pac-man is less than a year old.  The two of us seem destined to grow up together.  My favorite gift that year comes not from my loving father or mother but from an aunt and uncle I will see little of growing up.  It's a wooden Pac-man toy with painted wheels, and I love it. It will quickly become my favorite toy, and remains the only thing I still own from two years old.
  It seems strange then, tragic even, that I never knew this show existed as a kid!  Where was I?  All I can figure is that He-Man must have been on at the same time. (Seems I had a thing for charactors with -Man in their names..) It's really a shame, because if I had seen this as a child I might find it more viewable as an adult.  Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong about the show... but then there's nothing really right about it either. You get the idea that Hanna Barbera figured the Pac name alone would draw kids in and they didn't need to focus on story telling. The show has very little humor, no witty one liners or zingy comebacks, nothing quotable. The charactors are lifeless and bland.  There are some flashes of genius, like the Pac family going to the drive in to watch video games (kinda' a Galaga meets Star Wars) but they are few and far between.
  Not even my kids got into this one, and they both like Pac-Man and 80's cartoons.  Still, it gets four stars for simply being a Pac-Man cartoon.  It's not bad for what it is.  It's just not great, either.",1362355200,,1536,4.187713310580205
5026160,5,B006WQUJ16,"Such memories overwhelm me when watching this series.  I was nearly my 13 year old son's age at the time.  He thinks its great and really loves it.  Even though he is into Xbox 360, blogging and other high-tech activities of 2013, its nice to sit and time-warp with him on the classics of my childhood.  To bond with such a fun show.  It is so cool.  Yea son, I know, please don't use that phrase.  He says I sound so silly.",1361318400,5,424,4.097560975609756

The show is corny, there's barely any plot, and after a while each episode seems the same as the last, but it's Pac Man and his family & it's classic at it's best, and still beats any of today's cartoons by hundred.",1358294400,6,390,4.27027027027027

5026165,4,B006WQUJ16,"I am finally glad that we have yet another great 80's classic cartoon from one the most popular video games of all time and produced by one of the best animation companies of all time.

Warner Archive at least got all of this series complete and on DVD. They also got Dragon's lair and let's hope Supercade will come too.

POSITIVES: This is season 1 complete and unedited as it originally aired, it even includes the ""Pac-Mania"" short bumpers. It does not include the Christmas Special or Season 2, but luckily that was released on another DVD you can also buy.

NEGATIVES: Like many early & mid 80's cartoons they were shot on 35mm film, transferred to tape and edited for production. For some strange reason the whole industry thinks that by doing a ""new film"" transfer that the DVD will be so much better quality. Sadly, this is not always the case.

Just like with other 80's cartoons (G.I. Joe, Transformers, Dragon's Lair) this appears to be a new film to digital transfer, which would be OK if they only knew how to remaster it correctly!

This suffers from the common remastering problem of the ""contrast"" being incorrectly set, so you can't tell the difference between the ""red"" ghost and the ""orange"" ghost...it's outright set way off! So compared to the original analog broadcast tapes (still shown on Boomerang) the remastering is sub par.

To make matters worse, as with many ""new transfers"", there were missing scenes from the 35mm film, so those were simply replaced with the original scenes taken from the analog broadcast tapes. The problem is they don't match at all and appear out of place since they don't suffer from the poor contrast settings, they actually look better. So it's a standard ""mixed bag"" that we have commonly come to accept for 80's cartoons, on that part.

Time Warner could have spent more time on correcting the contrast and other colors that are off, or just used the original tapes which would have been better in my opinion, but this was a low budget job and that is what you should expect.

MENU/EXTRAS: BIG silly FBI warning, very basic menu and no extras.

This is a standard burned DVD-R (with CSS copy protection which is useless) created On-Demand, which is not as good as a DVD ROM but far better then silly digital downloads wrapped in DRM that you can't use on DVD (i.e. Smurfs).

OVERALL: Buy it for sure, esp. if you want the full season and if you have the time and knowledge, you can easily fix the video contrast yourself if it's that important to you.",1353801600,,2510,4.632882882882883
5026166,5,B006WQUJ16,"I recommend this cartoon. Especially to anyone who grew up watching it Saturday mornings, or loves PAC-MAN in general.  I bought this one for myself as I wanted to have a childhood keepsake.  I was a little hesitant at first about the DVR- recorded discs and if it would work or not on my cheap $24 DVD player.  Fear not, plays perfectly!!  Good Quality and menus.  PAC-Mania shorts appear in between each 10-12 approx. minute episode in this collection (I assume as originally aired) . There is a play all option or you can watch a specific episode if you want to choose.  What you will not find here is ""Christmas Comes to PAC-Land"" tv special that aired the first season.
