4005588,5,B002W5GK6E,"This Australian cop series is outstanding. I was surprised to see a devout Muslim family man as the main character. It takes a bit of time to get used to the rapidly-spoken Aussie English, but it is well worth the transition time.",1402272000,,230,4.5
4005589,3,B002W5GK6E,Violence. Sound and the accent made it hard to follow. Multiple storylines sometimes made it confusing  who were the good guys.,1397260800,4,127,5.0476190476190474
4005590,5,B002W5GK6E,"These episodes of crime and justice down-under are very well done, riveting, and enlightening.  The friction between Aussies and immigrants is eye opening so say the least.

The only improvement in their presentations would be to add the option of english sub-titles for those of us who have a tough time picking up their accent.",1351209600,8,329,4.963636363636364
4005591,5,B002W5GK6E,"This is more than just a typical police drama.  First of all, it is an excellent police drama, and if you like that genre, you will not want to miss this series.  Second, for those North Americans used to American or Canadian police series, this series out of Australia presents a familiar yet different twist.  The rapidly spoken Aussie English may take a while to adjust to, but once done, is well worth it.

In addition to the typical machinations of office politics among peers and with superiors, East West has the additional dimension of the protagonist being a Muslim, and faced with what can only be described as derogatory attitudes from colleagues in his department.  Detective Zane Malik, among other characters, are multi-dimensional, and we see him confront family issues at home, including dealing with the shooting of his own father decades ago.

Through Malik and the police cases he deals with, we gain an insight into an immigrant community struggling to adjust to its new homeland with dignity and humbleness while confronted with scorn and often contempt.

Kudos to MHz Networks for bringing this justifiably acclaimed series to the New World.",1336435200,15,1163,4.994818652849741

4005593,5,B002W5GK6E,"This first season is fantastic. Sets up the whole series.  Season 2 was great too!  You can't go wrong trying out this police procedural series. Like the movie Animal Kingdom you'll see some really rich story lines. The series has won a number of awards, the latest being a Gold Medal for Best Mini-series at the New York Festivals International Television and Film Awards.  Season Three will screen in Australia in 2011 using the Afghanistan war as background so the DVD should be available this year too.",1292284800,4,506,4.793103448275862
4005604,2,B002W5GK6E,Mixed review. Loved show for first two episodes where there were subtitles. No subtitles after that and even though we loved the show we had to stop watching it because we could not understand the dialogue/accents. Very disappointing.,1511913600,2,234,5.184210526315789

Don Hany (Serangoon Road, Underbelly) is a great actor.  I sometimes had to 'rewind' parts because of the accents and lack of subtitles; and, having to play each episode separately (no 'play all' option) was irritating but the series was worth the extra efforts.  Series 2 and 3 are also excellent.",1446768000,2,442,5.027397260273973

4005623,5,B002W5GK6E,I loved this entire series!  I loved that a muslim actor was playing a good muslim cop.  It also has a bromance storyline with his partner who was of a native nationality.  Don Hany's real life father payed his character's father.  The only negative is that sometimes their Australian accent is barely understood.,1441584000,2,313,4.849056603773585

4005640,1,B002W5GK6E,"Terrible in many ways. First, the Australian English is incomprehensible-subtitles re needed, and there are none. Second, this is a series about Muslims in Australia, written by a pair of flaming leftists. In this series, all muslims are peaceful saints who cannot understand why people hate them.
The rest of Australia, especially the police, are hateful racists, something the writer and producer firmly believe. Terrible waste of money.",1433289600,3,439,5.470588235294118

4005657,5,B002W5GK6E,"The Aussies are really good at making realistic films and this is no exception. You are not asked to sympathize with the Muslim police officer but you are asked to see him as you see yourself--a person struggling to care for family to find justice for wrongs committed by senseless thugs and in the end to show compassion for a co-worker who has been on your case not because you aren't doing a good job but because you are ""one of them"".
Don't think anyone will be converted in this first season but I liked it well enough to go on to season 2. Just wish Amazon didn't charge so much!!",1412640000,2,586,4.288288288288288

4005659,5,B002W5GK6E,"This is one of the best crime series ever produced for television. The homicides that form the core of each episode likewise expose tensions related to class, gender, and ethnicity typical in any urban society. However, the lead detectives--Muslim and Maori--are unique featured players with rich lives that comprise a significant part of the series. The viewer learns about urban Australia while considering the difficulties of modern life facing all of us. As a middle-class white woman, I connected more to these characters and their problems than I have to those found in the standard American crime drama.

4005662,5,B002W5GK6E,"This is a carefully thought out, expertly acted police procerdural set in Sydney, Australia. The head of the homicide squad is a blond, blue eyed woman and the detectives include an Iraqi muslim, a Polynesian, an Asian and a lesbian, pregnant with her first child. Each episode has a complete story but there is also an over arching storyline driven by a much larger crime. The plot that is continuous is driven by the changes in Australia because of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan: damaged vets serving in the police, the influx of refugees from those war torn countries and the fact that Australia is a natural destination for immigrants from Asia. The mix of the unit also means there will be conflict between the members of the unit.  I found it really compelling, although the Australian accent makes the dialogue hard to follow at times.",1404000000,4,845,4.7482993197278915
4005663,3,B002W5GK6E,"I bought this because I have yet to be disappointed by Aussie productions. However, I would rate this as quite average; the storyline is entertaining but did not rivet my attention. I am English and have spent time in working in Australia, and even I found the speech pattern hard to follow. The average Australian tends to speak out the corner of his or her mouth and this proved not an exception to the rule !! Not a criticism, simply an observation !! I think the lack of subtitles dampened my enthusiasm for this production. Notwithstanding that, the acting is excellent and it does adequately achieve its purpose of illustrating cultural differences within the Australian immigrant community. I am dithering whether I would buy a second series, or perhaps hope my local library has a copy !!",1402444800,10,796,4.817518248175182
8382816,2,B002W5GK6E,"I, too, wanted to like this series, but I'm afraid the accents were just too difficult for me to understand.  I realized about half way through the first episode that I was understanding maybe a quarter of what was being said.  Not sure why this series is so difficult.  I have Acorn TV and have watched tons of other British programs, including other ones from Australia and could understand them just fine....",1528761600,,411,4.680555555555555

8382818,2,B002W5GK6E,"The dialogue sounded as if it was on double speed, especially the main character's. It was almost unintelligible without captions, much like trying to listen through a bad cell phone connection. The camera work was jerky. I didn't get through the first episode, not because of the content but because of how much work it took to keep up with the dialogue.",1525392000,,355,4.741935483870968

The casting is superb, the acting sterling, and the writing is brilliant. the entire execution of the series is phenomenally excellent. The false reviews or perhaps culturally biased bigots who claim that this series is ""anti-police"" needs sub-titles betray that they have not watched it, There are few finer works of crime genre anywhere that have such a visceral depth of understanding and respect for police, nor indeed for the preciousness of human life, especially when unjustly brutalized. As a Muslim, the attention paid to the details of my faith were especially heartening and are very rare in the media, post 9-11. A riveting viewing experience.",1524614400,,961,4.932098765432099
8382820,5,B002W5GK6E,"First off, if you have read my other DVD/BD reviews on Amazon, you know I hate spoilers. So you won't find any here to stop your enjoying this series. Theres nothing like having someone who has watched a show spoil the fun for you. After all, these are called mysteries for a reason.  So here is what you SHOULD know:

There are six episodes running 58-59 minutes each. Each involves a graphically violent crime.

The crime team  and the murders  are culturally diverse. This is Sydney, Australia and we have a Moslem detective, a black detective (referred to as Samoan) and a white racist. Thats just the detective squad. The crimes cover other ethnic groups in Sydney.
Though many shows called Series One  have a few (often many!) loose ends at the end. And some are not renewed for a second season. That is NOT the case here. There is a second season being released soon but there are NO loose ends on this one.

This is not a new series. I was produced in 2007 but is just making its debut in the US.

The DVD set has a nice 23 minute making of featurette, well worth watching (but only AFTER you have seen the series). I will share one piece of info that I learned in the bonus that  knowing up front  will help you enjoy watching it. The director encouraged the actors to talk faster; faster. So, don't feel left out if you seem to miss words. Since there is also slang not common to US folks, I HIGHLY recommend adding the English subtitles option. They are big and easy to read  though they will fly by too.
In addition to the graphic violence (and a small amount of language) there is a totally un-needed sex scene at the beginning. Its not graphic but seems out of place IMHO

Well, thats all you really need to know.  If you like British and Australian crime shows (which Acorn continues to offer), I think youll like this one. Now to wait for Series 2.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8382821,4,B002W5GK6E,"The world is filled with tension these days. The possibility of war between various countries looms if you believe everything you read in the press. The fear of nuclear holocaust hasn't been this pervasive since the 1960s. While the potential is and always has been there the reality is that the odds of it happening are slim. And yet a fear remains in place.

Much of that fear stems from the actions that have involved Muslim extremists. Now please note this is not ALL Muslims but extremists we are talking about here. This would mean those that feel the need to wipe anyone who disagrees off the face of the Earth. The problem is that far too many associate ALL Muslims with this movement. Sadly those that have no connection are paying for the actions of the few.

Few films or TV series have actually covered this topic in depth. Some have touched on it but nothing major. With the exception of one. EAST WEST 101, which aired on the SBS network in Australia in 2007 made this the center piece of the series with all other actions revolving around it. Why no one has taken the series to reset it in another country is beyond imagination. It would work so well in creating a bridge between people.

The story focuses around police detective Zane Malik (Don Hany), a Muslim on the elite Major Crime Squad in Sydney, who faces scrutiny and distrust from his fellow officers due to his faith. His partner is Sonny Koa (Aaron Faaoso), a Samoan-Australian who faces as much prejudice as Zane due to his heritage. As part of the team they focus is on crimes taking place in Sydney that range from gang violence to murder. Covering the area of Sydney that houses a number of immigrants creates more tension than should exist.

One of the main officers on the team is Detective Ray Crowley (William McInnes). Crowley is filled with plenty of prejudice against nearly any and every one you can imagine. He focuses much of this against Zane and the two face off more than once in the first season. The second episode spends much of its time focusing on Crowley when his son is found dead of a heroin overdose. Filled with guilt over the death and knowing that the man who most likely sold him the drugs was foreign, the possibility of Crowley being the killer of this drug dealer is introduced. That internal affairs is leading an investigation into his conduct doesnt help.

So what makes this series work? Why is it so interesting and why would is it a show that other countries should emulate? The main focus of the series is the answer. The combination of prejudice mixed with the fear the world fears after numerous attacks and bombings is a balancing act that deserves discussion. And the series never turns away from that discussion. It embraces it and shows the differences in cultures not just from one side but both.

The pervasive fears of non-Muslims in a world of terrorists threats is normal but at the same time can become irrational when you begin thinking that ALL Muslims are the enemy. And the distrust of those who are Muslim in a country where they are treated poorly based on the actions of a minority of their religion creates a resentment as well. The character of Zane tries to balance both sides, remaining faithful to his religion and family while working within the system to prove his worth their, that he can be trusted like any other member of the force.

The acting on the show is wonderful with each actor playing their part to perfection. Hany does a great job in the lead role, displaying an intensity when called for and a softer side when needed. One hopes that he moves on to bigger and better things. McInnes as Crowley is a character that you will loathe early on and never remove that loathing for him even when hes faced with the death of his son. He is an unsympathetic character that you want badly to feel something for but then he opens his mouth and all sympathy is lost again. How you feel by the end of the series depends on your views.

Acorn Media is just now releasing the first season of the series with the second soon to follow. It provides viewers around the world with a chance to experience TV from another country and they're bringing some of the best there is to find. This is one of those good ones and while only 6 episodes long is a real treat. If you're looking for a crime drama that offers something a little different then I highly suggest this series. You won't be disappointed.",1523577600,2,4441,4.528678304239402

8382823,5,B002W5GK6E,"A major crime drama series that is character-driven with a unique prejudice theme. Sydney Detective Zane Malik (Don Hany Janet King) is a Muslim family man in a post-9/11 world. East West 101 offers perhaps a realistic view of Middle East prejudice that exploded across the world after the US terrorist attack. Other minorities are also addressed in the season. Each episode has a primary case story, but some character thread stories carry on from episode to episode. It feels real, crimes get solved, but not all ends well, like real life. Zanes boss is played by Susie Porter (Janet King), who must handle prejudice conflict within her investigative team. William McInness plays the good/bad cop Crowley. My wife enjoyed it too.
This is the first of what should be 3 seasons of DVD releases, only six out of 20 aired episodes. The only negative is director caused. Faster-faster-faster filming buzzword mentioned among the cast causes dialogue ripped off so fast it required some backing up to catch what the multi-accented cast said. Director-crammed dialogue was not enough to cut this series down from a five-star crime drama from Down Under.

SDH SUBTITLES helpful for 54 minute episodes and behind-the-scenes bonus.
[1] The Enemy Within ==2 armed Middle Eastern young robbers kill a cop. Zane Malik clashes with DS Crowley who objects to his Arab community connections.
[2] Death at the Station ==Redfern Stations tainted street drugs kill. Crusader of reform is also killed. Assassination? Accusations point toward the police station.
[3] Islander Sacrifice ==Zane appointed SCI on a triple drive-by killing. DS Crowley put off but has his own IA case to defend.
[4] Hunt for the Killer ==Vietnam couple killed brutally. Zanes testimony in an internal case could be costly. For who?
[5] Haunted by the Past ==Zane hunts for an auto salesmans murderer as he ponders deeper his Dads shooting. Zanes film Dad is also his real-life father. Interesting casting.
[6] The Hand of Friendship ==Attempted drowning in a caravan park is blamed on Zane. Than a body is found in Chinatown. Whos responsible?",1515715200,,2103,5.060518731988473
