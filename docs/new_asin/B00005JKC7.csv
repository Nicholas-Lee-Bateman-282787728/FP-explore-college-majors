1432493,4,B00005JKC7,This has got to be one of my favorite documentaries. It still amazes and saddens me at how we have let our school systems down.  If you have not seen this documentary you need to see because you will love it and it will open your eyes as to what is going on in this country and how we have dropped the ball where education is concerned for our children.,1343779200,2,353,4.042857142857143
1432494,5,B00005JKC7,"This film covers a few different issues. Number one, it covers the struggle of an under-educated woman trying to make it by with very little money and too many kids. While this certainly tugs at the heartstrings, I think the second issue it portrays is far more important, although ultimately lost on some who will watch the film.

This film demonstrates the importance of parent(s) and/or tutor(s) in a child's education, outside of the classroom. If the parents are unable to help the child, funding for after-school help has been entirely cut, and class sizes are far too large for teachers to spend one-on-one time with students, the pupils are left to struggle and ultimately be left-behind. As the students continue to struggle later in life, ultimately graduating at the absolute minimum or dropping out, they will end up in a low-paying dead-end job if they're lucky, or end up in a life of crime, only to perpetuate the cycle to the next generation.

If you'd like the really see the importance of after-school programs, free tutoring, and/or cutting class sizes, not to mention proper funding for supplies, watch this film, you won't be disappointed.",1326672000,4,1160,4.943589743589744
1432495,5,B00005JKC7,"I have waited for this video to be available for years at a reasonable price. Every University should have several copies of this movie. People all over the United States would be ashamed and astonished after watching this film. The first question that would be asked will be how many decades ago was this. The shame is that this is happening now where people have to walk miles to get water to take a bath or cook, or where the kids take turns going to school because they are sharing the same pencil or the same pair of pants. These are people who have real problems and need help in this country.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/7-an-Hour-Ain-t-No-Job-The-Second-Emancipation-of-the-Black-Race/dp/1597440132/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">$7 an Hour Ain't No Job: The Second Emancipation of the Black Race</a>",1285804800,9,845,5.661417322834645
1432496,5,B00005JKC7,"This documentary is true to what everyone is saying - it shows a delta woman's struggle for survival in a harsh world. she can't read, she's poor and uneducated, but she has plenty of love to give around to her babies. lalee struck me because she is so genuine. she's got a big heart. she doesn't have much, but she is makes the best out of her situation, never blaming a soul. it makes you grateful for everything you have. after all, what do we know about driving into town just to get a jug of water so we can have a bath? what do we know about losing our home?
There are two stories displayed in the film. the first is the part about lalee, and the latter is about reggie barnes, a superintendent who is struggling to get the west tallahatchie school district up in levels to keep the state from taking over. his dedication to the children in the district is astounding. more schools need someone like him, who is willing to go the long run to help educate.
if you're looking for something real about the grittiness of the mississippi delta, this is for you.
also, i read an article on her about a year ago in my state capital's newspaper. since the documentary, many people have come by to bring her gifts or help fix up her house and such. i'm glad she was able to touch so many lives. she is an amazing woman.",1197936000,16,1316,4.268
1432497,5,B00005JKC7,"I feel this movie is a very insightful and honest portrayal of African American heritage in the deep south, a heritage that has restricted them in terms of healthcare, education, employment, and social justice.  The strength of the central character, LaLee Wallace, is touching and inspiring.  Despite all the hardships she has endured for decades, she continues to love, care for, and nurture her struggling family, including her grandchildren.  She teaches these grandchildren how to be the best they can be ""for themselves.""  In one very poignant scene, she is deeply saddened by the telling of the story of how her son was killed in a car accident.  As tears stream down her cheeks, she says ""doesn't pay to love your children too hard.""  Equally inspiring are the principal and teachers in the poverty stricken schools that the children attend.  They are a dynamic group of individuals, dedicated to improving the quality of the school and the education provided----communicating that they feel that these children are worth it, and that education is the only way to break the cycle of poverty, drop-out rates, teen pregnancy, and crime.  They know they are confronting great odds, but feel a strong sense of responsiblility to the children and the community.  I would highly recommend this video, and hope to use in my own graduate level classes on Diversity. It highlights the strength of the human spirit and the concept that ""it takes a village to raise a child.""  We fall short in that area!  Vera Gray",1033257600,4,1512,4.936758893280633
1432498,5,B00005JKC7,"It will bring tears to your eyes.
This film is powerful. No narration, just reality coming at you in your face, in your gut.
This is modern day Third World living in the United States of America that's happening right now.  Not fifty years ago but RIGHT NOW.
If you don't look differently at that last CD you bought, or that latte' you had yesterday, you have a heart of stone.
If you say you care about anyone other than yourself and you don't choose to go into the world and DO SOMETHING after seeing this film, you may as well be dead.  You can't be human and go back to life as usual after seeing this film.",1033257600,9,611,4.169491525423729
1432554,5,B00005JKC7,"I find myself watching this documentary almost daily. This documentary captures a way of life that would otherwise go unnoticed by the public at large. My mom grew up in rural Alabama. Picked cotton, drew the families only source of water from a well, etc... She was the 6th of her 7 siblings...but the first to go to college. She said she always use to say...while picking cotton in the hot scorching sun, she knew their had to be a better ""way""... A better way to make it that is. And education was it, she said. I have a ton of family that still lives in rural Alabama and I can tell you straight up, this documentary is the TRUTH!!! This documentary captures the essence of my moms family. I love this documentary. I watch it often just to hear LaLee say some of the phrases my grandma and mom use. Like... ""Ya'll worrying the devil out of me."" lolol LaLee was a great women. May her soul rest in peace.",1389744000,,907,4.309941520467836
1432555,4,B00005JKC7,"I've shown this film to my Introduction to Sociology Students. It can be used to discuss class conflict, structural violence, and agents of socialization very easily.  It is sometimes difficult to follow along, even though there are subtitles to help understand the southern accents.  Nonetheless, it is a very powerful film that stayed with my students long after we watched it.",1388361600,,379,5.19672131147541
1432556,5,B00005JKC7,This is a timeless documentary...I really wish someone would go back and do a follow-up with this family. I'm curious to know if they have advanced.,1383609600,,148,4.730769230769231
1432557,5,B00005JKC7,"In the early 2000's, I saw this on HBO. Although I live in a small city in southern Alabama, it still shook me to my core that there were/are still fellow US citizens living in such abject poverty - uneducated and with few to no prospects for a better life.  The legacy of cotton referred to in the title is the continuation of the lack of availability of and emphasis on meaningful education for the poor, especially in the agricultural south.  As a child, Lalee was expected to leave school at an early age to be in the fields picking cotton with the rest of her family.  The effect of this generational lack of education has caused and still causes tremendous hardship to the working poor in the rural south.

Lalee is the elderly family matriarch and she valiantly does what she can to problem-solve for her numerous children, as well as keep/raise several of her grandchildren/great-grandchildren.  It is both heartbreaking and spirit-affirming watching her pick greens from a field to help feed them all.

However, it was so sad to watch Lalee cook all of her wonderful, nutritious and delectable food such as greens, ham, steak, potatoes, banana pudding and her other specialties in her kitchen - so she could raise $$ by selling plate lunches to the nearby cotton factory workers.  It was sad to watch for a couple of reasons: 1) she didn't know enough about basic business strategy to realize she needed to charge more for her meals - to cover supplies, utilities and gas to transport the food; 2) there was no such fare for her own family; they ate spaghetti with some chopped up balogna thrown in (""so everyone could have a little piece,"" as Lalee said).

The parallel story told in this film is the massive push the area's school system (in which many of Lalee's grand-children attended at the time) mounts to achieve a better rating for their schools.  This side of the story is uplifting and brimming with hope.

There have to be lots of Lalees living in Mississippi and Alabama, but this Lalee is the one I happened to ""meet.""  She stayed with me for all of these years.  I tracked down the dvd recently and purchased it here on Amazon.  The film still carries such an emotional punch for me.

After watching the film again, I went online to see if I could find more about Lalee Wallace.  I found that Lalee died of a stroke in November, 2008.  I was so very sad to read that - not only for the loss of such a strong spirit in this world, but I wondered how her family would hold together without that strength.

As someone who works in public housing, I can tell you first-hand the way to end such poverty is first-class education accessible to all.  With the help of the inspiring school head in this documentary, maybe Lalee's kin (her grandchildren and great-grandchildren) will have more options than did Lalee.

Moving, moving story with a compelling title character - God speed, Lalee.",1376438400,,2907,4.609708737864078

1432559,5,B00005JKC7,I somehow managed to misplace my original DVD of Lalee's Kin which was purchased many years ago. I am glad that this rare film is available and offered at a reasonable price.,1362873600,,174,4.46875

This film holds special significance to me because I am not only from the Mississippi Delta but also be use my entire research career is dedicated to addressing the many complex issues surrounding poverty. The biggest peeve with the video is the subtitles that were put in to help some viewers understand the regional accents. This was a good idea, but it would have been much better if the subtitles had actually been correct. Otherwise it provides an accurate view of chronic poverty in one of the most impoverished regions in the U.S.",1353628800,,584,4.735294117647059
7938773,5,B00005JKC7,"I first saw this movie when it came out in 2000 on HBO channel. I was very touched by the movie. The grandmother who had a hard time throughout her life and even trying to raise her grandchildren while living in very poor conditions. The town and school have no jobs ar good education to provide for the people or children. When my husband started driving for Werner who transports for Dollar General stores in 2003. We traveled back and forth to the delta because one of the terminals was in Indinalo, Ms. We saw nothing but cotton fields for miles. I spoke to white lady and we held a conversation we were in the Delta. She commented that that the Delta is no place for a black person. I wouldn't live there being of any race.

7938782,5,B00005JKC7,"I have visited Glendora Mississippi, one of the nation's poorest towns, on several times. The grocery store downtown was owned by the two men in nearby Money MS who killed Emmitt Till, whose murder ignited the Civil Rights struggle more than any other event. It is also the birthplace of Sonny Boy Williamson (Alex ""Rice"" Miller) the youngest of 21 children of local Blacksmith Jim Miller and his wife Millie Ford Miller. Watch some of the American Folk Blues Festival era videos of Sonny Boy, enjoy them and watch to see the Miller nieces and nephews' faces among the children being raised by Laura Lee (Lalee). It is eerie. This was shot in 2000 and in 1998 with the help of the mayor Johnny B. Thomas my friends and I brought in six cases of harps, sixteen top blues harp players and spent two days teaching 114 young well-dressed children how to pay harmonica.  The Black Bayou School at which we held the even was closed down by local authorities the very next day!
This film is raw, real and moving. It is the final (I hope) chapter in the story begun with the Pulitzer Prize winning documentary Slavery By Another Name (the re-enslavement of the South through forced labor of innocents programs like the sharecropper system.) Note the discussion of Black women having as many as 17 children. The worst social problem there is teenage pregnancy, a practice used in slavery to create, in effect, cotton farmhand farms from which to harvest workers.
Nothing has changed. This hamlet's chief industries include an Emmitt Till and Sonny Boy Williamson museum (call ahead to see it - it is seldom open).",1396656000,,1604,4.728571428571429
