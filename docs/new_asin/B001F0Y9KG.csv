3559469,4,B001F0Y9KG,"I ordered this DVD in hopes finding a belly dance workout that's appropriate while pregnant, as I've enjoyed belly dance for exercise for many years. While it's really not ""dance"" (more like cardio and isolation moves based off some belly dance inspired movement), it's still a gentle, smooth, and wonderful workout. If you're careful to isolate your muscles and squeeze and release, you will feel a burn. My heart rate got up a little bit, but nothing crazy - which is perfect since I""m 6 months pregnant.

While this workout won't make you sweat, it will stretch you and relieve tension and soreness in your muscles. I felt GREAT afterward! Tension and discomfort in my back and hips was relieved and I felt relaxed and renewed. If you want to get a more advanced workout, try some gentle aerobics or walking, but for a great exercise program that works your muscles and also stretches them out, give this one a try.",1279324800,3,918,4.701863354037267
3559470,4,B001F0Y9KG,"I am in my 28th week and haven't exercised at all until just 2 weeks ago.  I have Preggi Bellies (from Australia) and can only do the warmup.  I can do 10 - 15 very slow minutes on an elliptical.  This video will not work up a sweat, and it is a little boring.  This is not learning to bellydance.  That said, it is good for someone just getting back to exercise late in pregnancy or on a day that you are just really tired but still want to do something.  Also, I've taken a couple of bellydance classes (pre-pregnancy) and it's a form of dance that makes me feel really good.  Doing this video reminded me of these beautiful, graceful moves at a time when I feel anything but.  I had 1 other Neena/Veena video years ago that I found unbearably annoying, this wasn't nearly as bad.  And this is petty, but I wish she wore a different outfit, something a little more attractive (it's not the same outfit from the cover picture).

I wouldn't have paid full price for it, but used it was well worth buying.",1272412800,2,1004,4.264550264550264
3559471,1,B001F0Y9KG,"I don't understand the reviews I read that led me to purchase this video. It's the most boring, non-challenging workout video I've ever encountered! Move your torso in a few circles, now point your toe out to the side, now point it to the other side...sheesh.
This is simply coddling. Maybe useful in your 9th month if you can barely move.",1271635200,3,339,4.573770491803279
3559472,5,B001F0Y9KG,"I started this workout in my first trimester, and was surprised that such simple, non-jarring moves could make my thighs burn they way they did.",1268438400,,144,4.8
3559473,4,B001F0Y9KG,"I bought this after doing several of Veena/Neena vidoes(am still doing Basic Moves and Core Conditioning).  I'm currently 5 months along and when I first watched the vidoe thought, oh wow, this is quite tame.  Then I tried it-boy was it a workout!  Not too difficult-but I loved how she had Kegels and squats-which are important for pregant moms.  I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a prenatal belly dance vidoe",1258243200,9,428,4.743243243243243
3559474,4,B001F0Y9KG,"This is a gentle, low-impact, yet thorough workout. I'm not currently pregnant, though I hope to be soon, and bought this in anticipation. You definitely feel like you've exercised with this program, but it does not make you overly tired nor is it strenuous. I think it is a perfect option for pregnancy, especially since they focus so much on rib cage exercises that help you have more room to breath around baby, and on stretching the pelvic/hip area in preparation for childbirth.",1241568000,10,483,4.831325301204819
3559475,5,B001F0Y9KG,"This workout is really lovely--a good level of activity and toning exercises, but fun and sensual.  I first tried the prenatal bellydance video with Naia and was really wishing that there was a Neena/Veena video instead.  The Naia video was harder to follow, with not enough instruction and more complicated floor moves.  I have been doing Neena/Veena videos for years and love them.  I was so happy to find this video and I exercise to it frequently, in addition to yoga and cardio such as walking and elliptical.",1236124800,2,514,4.806818181818182
3559476,5,B001F0Y9KG,"this dvd is beautiful,I already love veena and neena,its lovely that neena made this video,it makes me feel so soothed and calmed.a brilliant companion for us pregnant mums,made me feel very calm and sensual.

theres an interview at the end too with a doula,its brilliant xx",1234137600,5,274,4.956521739130435
8300371,5,B001F0Y9KG,"Love the two options for workout, for the further along and/or inexperienced, or the more advanced/early pregnancy.",1470960000,,115,5.823529411764706
8300372,3,B001F0Y9KG,Fun but not much of a workout.,1417737600,,30,3.4285714285714284
8300373,1,B001F0Y9KG,As the other reviews say...This copy is in FRENCH!  Amazon customer service was great about returning it.  Would have loved the english version as I am a Nena and Vena fan.,1386288000,,172,4.516129032258065
8300374,4,B001F0Y9KG,"I bought this dvd because I'm pregnant and also a bellydance teacher. I wanted to know some moves that I could teach to my students without doing anything wrong, but this is too basic! She doesn't talk about what moves you can or can't do, it looks like she's doing yoga with a few steps of bellydance.... The good thing is: the warm-up!! I do it every day and also the interview with the doula was excellent!",1367107200,,409,4.324675324675325
8300375,5,B001F0Y9KG,"Good workouts, easy on body, enough to get you sweating and using your muscles. Uses chair and floor excesses depending on your abilities and its useful for all through your pregnancy. was fun, just like there other video's and the women doing it was even pregnant looking. not all skinny, and fit running, like she'd never been pregnant. that does make a difference in watching these. Hope you enjoy.",1354752000,,401,4.826086956521739
8300376,4,B001F0Y9KG,"Good movements for pregnancy, the bigger I got the less I could do. It was very slow but relaxing and taught you all the dance movements.",1324512000,,137,4.3076923076923075
8300377,1,B001F0Y9KG,"I've done belly dancing and belly dancing workouts but this is not it. I usually like Veena and Neena - they are both beautiful, talented and fun - but this is slow and dull. It can build arm and leg strength by having you hold your arms up a lot and do a lot of squat-like motions. If we aren't suppossed to be belly dancing while pregnant than they should have just not made a prenatal belly dancing workout. Instead they decided to make some money by pushing out another product.",1301270400,3,482,4.3076923076923075
8300378,1,B001F0Y9KG,"Buyer beware.  I ordered this DVD, which was supposed to be in English and it came in French.

I then returned that DVD when Amazon told me it was probably an error with the warehouse, and they sent me a new one.

The new one was also in French.

Finally, Amazon told me to return the second one for a full refund.  They would not offer to send me the correct DVD in English, which is what I ordered.

I have always been happy with Amazon's service, but this experience left me completely frustrated and I am thinking of pulling my baby registry off of this website.",1297209600,2,566,4.242990654205608
8300379,5,B001F0Y9KG,This dvd is wonderful.  It is low impact and easy to follow.  I love the twins and how they teach you to belly dance.  With the baby belly you can belly dance and it helps with your pregnancy.  From having more energy to helping with your birthing experience. I would recommend this dvd to all pregnant women.,1297036800,,309,4.368421052631579
8300380,5,B001F0Y9KG,"Throughout a very difficult and complicated pregnancy, this video helped my body be more flexible in preparation for birth (used many of the movements during labor) as well as psychologically. When I was not feeling that great, just inserting the dvd and following her graceful movement was a meditation that always left me feeling great at the end. My son is now 10 months old and I still do these exercises from time to time and he loves the music...as do I. Will be looking out for all your other dvd's... Maybe Neena and Veena can make a dvd for after pregnancy...I'd buy it in a heartbeat. Enjoy your pregnancy!",1279497600,2,616,4.609090909090909
