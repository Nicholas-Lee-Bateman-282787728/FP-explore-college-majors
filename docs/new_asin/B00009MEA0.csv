Like most Imamura films this movie is so completely bizarre that it keeps your interest through utter fascination. Imamura says  ""I am interested in the lower structure of society and the lower part  of the human body.""  This is a good summary of this movie. The lead, a  pornographer believes that he is doing a favor to society by creating 16mm  B&W black market porns.  The most incredible scene I have ever seen on  film is in this movie, a dream like sequence with surf music and a insane  woman in a mental hospital are a brief description.  To see this one scene  is reason enough to buy this.",957744000,19,695,4.3515625
7991592,5,B00009MEA0,I love Imamura's no-nonsense depiction of Japanese life and culture. I always enjoy his colourful and alive characters. One cares for his everyday people as they live the absurd condition that is human life...,1431129600,,209,5.176470588235294
7991593,3,B00009MEA0,"Actually, a guy called Ogata makes living by illegally producing pornographic flicks, trying to look respectfully as his personal life is an extent-or a very play ground- for his job itself: he is for step-daughter, a school-girl playing around and with him for a monetary gain, his superstitions-overvhelmed wife is in an incestuous relation with son of her from a first marriage and brother and sister are cool each to other somehow either, while colleagues do not shy from same gender relation entertainment.

A black  and white movie where characters speak mostly than act explicitly.",1276214400,,588,5.178947368421053

7991595,3,B00009MEA0,"Just describing the story of any one of Shohei Imamura's films won't be enough to convey its oddity. Imamura's films are the misfits of Japanese cinema. They deal with bizarre, marginal characters in grotesque and unusual situations. Don't expect Kurosawa's epic sweep or Ozu's understatement. Imamura's films are flamboyantly crude and bizarre. His closest analogue in Japanese literature might be Kenzaburo Oe -- Oe's short story collection Teach Us To Outgrow Our Madness has a very similar tone. (And Imamura's more recent film Warm Water Under A Red Bridge is nicer than his early work, much like Oe's A Quiet Life.)

This film is about a frumpy middle-aged man named Subu who makes money by filming and selling illegal pornography. But he runs a small operation, which makes him vulnerable to just about everything. He needs to conceal his work from larger, more organized gangs, so they don't extort money from him. But of course, his work is illegal, so he can't exactly ask the law for help, either.

It's a sleazy story. The film is not the least bit titillating -- the actual pornography is never shown. Most of the plot is concerned with Subu running around trying to keep his operation afloat. He has to deal with lots of small details, like where to buy film, where to get women, how to sell the product without the mob knowing about it, and so on. It's such a mundane, slate-gray routine that it isn't even shocking.

One might be tempted to read the film as a justification of Subu -- not necessarily of Subu's work, but of Subu himself, an attempt to humanize him, in other words. Something along the lines of, ""hey, this guy is engaged in illegal activities on the fringes of society, but after all he's just another poor hard-working slob, same as all of us."" But I personally think that the film does precisely the opposite. And this is a bit of a subtle point, since Imamura does put a great deal of effort into making Subu as ""ordinary"" as possible. He's not involved with more ""serious"" crime, and he's not really any more malicious than the average person. And he doesn't take any prurient interest in his product -- his main reason for doing this work is to make enough money to support a family.

That family consists of a woman and her son and daughter, both children by another man. The children despise Subu from the beginning, but after they find out about his line of work, their hostility becomes open. At the same time, they continue to live on his money. They understand that he's supporting them, and this makes them hate him even more. There is a subplot in which Subu appears to feel desire for the daughter -- at the very least, he desperately wants her to like him. But the more he grovels before her, the more she humiliates him. She tells him to his face that she hates him, and at times, it seems like she's deliberately leading him on and raising his hopes, solely to extract money from him.

Subu has more luck with the woman, who really does seem to like him sometimes. But she feels guilty for coming to consort with such a man after her husband's death. She constantly imagines that her dead husband is angry at her, and fears some kind of divine retribution. Which ultimately arrives -- the final scene with her in the hospital is terrifying, because it's so jarring and unexpected.

This is why the film is not really a comedy, even a ""black"" one. It's just not funny to watch the man be degraded and used over and over and over by everyone and everything. He has no dignity. Even his appearance is vaguely repellent. There's something reptilian about the way Subu slinks around in his secret studio. And, of course, as a final humiliation, it turns out that he's impotent. He does miserable things and lives a miserable life. It might elicit some compassion on the part of the viewer, but even that compassion comes mixed with contempt. Subu makes several defiant speeches in defense of his vocation, but his words have a whinging, self-justifying tone that, while perhaps mildly humorous, is still distasteful.

And this is also why Subu emerges as an object of scorn rather than sympathy. It would seem that pornography has dehumanized him totally, beyond all hope. It perverts all his good intentions in advance. He wants to be a responsible father, but his ""dirty money"" makes the children hate him, and his very attempts to endear himself to them have the exact opposite effect. And so on, and so forth -- he took up this work to be happy, but it's the work itself, more than anything else, that forever condemns him to wretchedness.

I guess that's a really depressing message, so there's a drawn-out scene at the very end that is a little less intense (though still distasteful). The last shot has the effect of slightly softening the inevitable conclusion about Subu, by portraying him as a lost soul out in a vast ocean. But that's also why the whole scene seems unconvincing. The hospital scene writes off Subu's life, completely and finally; that's where his story really ends.

It's an engrossing film, in its own way. There are lots of oddities throughout, like how the woman imagines that her husband was reincarnated as a fish and is now watching her from his bowl across the room. But the overall tone is unpleasantly grotesque. I prefer Warm Water Under A Red Bridge -- at least there Imamura allowed his harried protagonist to regain his dignity.",1204243200,6,5414,4.672612801678909
7991596,5,B00009MEA0,"Imamura's sharp Oedipal satire was risqu and far ahead of its time in 1966, tackling themes of incest and sexual perversion in a contemporary Japanese family. Ever fascinated with the lower quarters of society and the human body, Imamura delights in registering the bizarre ways in which affection can be placed and misplaced, or simply twisted in knots, as with Haru and her too-affectionate son, Koichi. Mr. Ogata, meanwhile, looks at his blue movies as a kind of public service, and one could say the same for the director, who uses dark humor in his stylish depiction of such lurid but fondly human subject matter. Made with consummate skill by a Japanese master, The Pornographers is a seductive look at the kinks of love and longing. Still, decidedly not for all tastes.",1183334400,,776,4.886363636363637
7991597,5,B00009MEA0,"The Pornographers is an ironic title for a film about love. Sex drive is like the ever present gravity which more or less impacts on planets.  However look at all the odd twists & turns in the characters' lives that would have been unlikely if they were only trying to get laid.  Sometimes the hero's thoughts dart back to his lover's little girl as she was injured under a vehicle.  His lover later winds up insane & exposes herself to passerby - a moving depiction of permanent loss, although some ding-dongs in the audience thought they were supposed to laugh.",1122076800,,563,4.61
7991598,2,B00009MEA0,"This is a film that shows the potential of Shohei Imamura, but im afraid it does not fulfill it. The film trys to hard to be arty:the jump cuts and ""creative"" camera movement serve only to confuse and alienate the viewer.
Imamura is a master film maker, and this isn't a horrible film, but if you want to see his best, get ""the Eel"" or ""warm water under a red bridge""",1074211200,5,367,4.183098591549296
7991599,1,B00009MEA0,"There is a case for decrepit cinematic 'crud' being universal. This is it. Get Ozu's ""Tokyo Story"" instead (out on Criterion). That is a piece of timeless lyrical cinema. This film merely confirms that risque cinema quickly loses its potency (losing it in favour of a ephemeral revolutionary stance). A Waste.",1064880000,3,309,5.078431372549019
7991600,3,B00009MEA0,"Love'em or hate 'em, idiosyncratic films that dabble with subversive notions and stories of fringe people make some viewers uncomfortable.  You either get it or not. For those who do, there are rewards.
Shohei Imamura's THE PORNOGRAPHERS (Home Vision Entertainment) is about ""public service"" amateur porn filmmaker Subu.  He supports and sleeps with landlady Haru, who thinks her disapproving dead husband has returned as a carp. But really, Sabu lusts after Haru's daughter. Voyeurism and incest is kinky comic fodder for Imamura, who said he's interested in ""lower human society and the lower parts of the human body."" Not for every taste, but way ahead of it's time.  If you liked this one, see if you can find ""Down and Dirty.""",1059609600,8,731,5.024793388429752
