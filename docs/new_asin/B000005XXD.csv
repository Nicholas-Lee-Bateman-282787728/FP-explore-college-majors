1188362,5,B000005XXD,"This is an excellent, multi-dimmensional movie about tradition and moving on. Shirley MClaine plays Madame Sousatzka, a concert piano teacher, who takes on a 15-year-old Indian boy in London as her pupil. She drives him like a dog, but falls in love with him too, and tries to protect him from the money grubbing agents. She fails at this (inevitable, I suppose) because he need the money to help his mother. The film tries to do too much in its 126-minute length, with certain elements being carried only so far and then abandoned (Madame S.'s son Edward, her own past and failure, and the girl pop singer Julie [played by Twiggy] to name just three). But everyone does a bang-up job, and the story is wonderfully told and full of subleties and nuances that add much to its depth and our appreciation. Worth a watch.",1122422400,,817,4.641379310344828
1188363,5,B000005XXD,"It is one beautiful movie I've ever watched.  The movie deals with so many issues: clash of western/eastern cultures, a 13-year-old boy going through the pain of growing, society problems in England -- the tenants are chased out of their apartment because someone thinks the apartment needs to be torn down, an old man being mugged by young boys, etc.  There are class issues as well.  And the boy, the piano student, is being pulled toward pre-mature success, against his teacher's will, because his single mother has lost her job and they have no other means to survive.  The clash between the mother and his teacher (played by Shirley MacLane) is pretty real and funny too.  Two women compete each other to mother him, and he is at the age he wants to be independent.  He's also attracted to a woman who lives in the same apartment as his teacher.

All these issues are finely woven, and you will see the real lives of all who are involved.  Obstacles are everywhere, but regardless of what happens, the boy cannot stop from growing and he moves on.

Wonderful, wonderful movie.  A must for movie lovers.",1098144000,9,1107,4.65979381443299

1188365,5,B000005XXD,"This movie was a beautiful story about an Indian boy and his piano teacher. It was imaginative, funny, and moving at places. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a touching story.",1077321600,,178,4.59375
1188366,5,B000005XXD,"John Schlesinger became famous as a polemic and very socially oriented director, but this is his Masterpiece of all times.
It is not a monumental movie and it is not a box-office smashing hit.
No. This is a far superior work of artistry, worked and reworked from the guts and above all, from the heart.
The story is very skillfully developed and has plot twists and turns as the classical masterpieces interpreted in this movie.
Yes, because it is a tale of two cultures: the Western and the Eastern. The western side is taken by a (Russian?) piano teacher, living in London (masterfully played by a magnificent Shirley MacLaine) and the Eastern is represented by a would-be
and reticent Hindi piano student.
Not only does Schlesinger tell us the story of the two and their passions and strives in life, but also gives us a whole palette of undertones in quite different social worlds.
Despite its length (slightly over two hours) the movie has never a dull moment or a static conversation. Emotions are fully and honestly expressed by all involved and never for a moment, one can feel he is watching a movie here.
Quite the contrary. All the characters play their parts so much to the hilt, that it ""sucks"" us in and doesn't let loose until the end credits roll.
I am not an emotional person generally, and many ""tearjerkers"" only make me crack up, so academic they are, but when I watched this movie for the first time in New York City at the Carnegie Odeon Movie Theater, I must admit I came out in tears and had to make an effort not to be noticed for that.
Not that it is particularly sad, quite the contrary. Despite some very dramatic moments, it is truly a wonderful comedy.
No the sadness comes out from the realism contained in the lives of the characters, in which we all could find similarities.
The dreams, the passions, the disappointments, the crime and punishment and finally, the absolute redemption are all very important factors in this excellent movie.
The music world is only a mask to show us a much deeper view on society as such. But the film is conducted by Schlesinger (the old fox) as an orchestra conductor, directing a symphony by Beethoven.
His baton is light but never loses out on a note. His conducting is comparable to the mastery of Herbert von Karajan. The only difference is that he waltzes with a camera.
If you want to discover a different movie from the same-o, same-o, then this is an absolute must see.
I personally laughed, cried, got concerned and was worried, was uncomfortable, then immediately relieved by pleasant surprises throughout the entire movie, but above all, it made me think about the similarities with my own world and this is probably why I learned to love this tiny masterpiece.
I just own the VHS version, but would like to plea the producers of the movie (Universal was the distributor, but the movie was a Cineplex/Odeon production) and all those who are involved in DVD production to finally decide to release a pristine copy, with a decent digital sound and a crisp image.
Of all the movies around, this one surely would merit an extra effort to digitalize it and therefore preserve it for posterity.
I can only recommend it. This movie is for all, although some scenes may be a bit difficult to understand by younger audiences, without an adult presence. But in reality, this is a naive suggestion, since it has to be watched by the entire family on a quiet movie evening around the living room.
You need some concentration though, to watch it. It is not a popcorn and beer movie. This is a movie for those who love to think.",1063152000,32,3592,4.631661442006269

1188368,5,B000005XXD,"This movie made a Shirley MacLaine fan out of me.  Madame Sousatzka is a flamboyant, eccentric piano teacher who struggles with her past as she seeks to make the best of her students.  She is a stern but loving taskmaster as she teaches a young man not only about music, but about life.  If for nothing else, the film is worth watching for an elegant dinner party scene in which teacher and student play a Schubert piece for four hands, amid what appears to be hundreds of burning candles.  Subplots involve changes in the lives of the residents of Madame Sousatzka's aging but lovely apartment building and finding companionship in old age.",1017273600,6,641,4.696428571428571

Shirley MacClaine is an idiosyncratic, passionate teacher of music  as well as life.  She wears her heart of her sleeve and uses a personal and  vulnerable approach to teaching the piano.

Ms. MacLaine's scenery chewing abilities are used to their finest advantage as she builds the character of the imperious piano impresario.  Navin Chowdhry, as her newest student, more than holds his own against this force of nature.  Dame Peggy Ashcroft gives a master class in how to use quiet to gain attention, and Geoffrey Bayldon turns in a sterling performance that sets the ""stiff upper lip"" stereotype on its head.  This is a perfect movie if you like character studies, or if you just want to spend a few quiet hours in England without leaving home.",1467763200,,648,4.707964601769912

1188390,5,B000005XXD,"'Madame Sousatzka' tells the dramatic story of the often difficult and complex relationship between teacher and prodigy.  MacLaine is at her best as the talented but eccentric and demanding London piano teacher, herself a failed concert pianist living in her famous mother's shadow.  Navin Chowdhry makes his debut as a young pianistic prodigy who becomes ""Madame's latest,"" an unwitting pupil that becomes the focus of her intense artistic attention and affection.  As a professional pianist, I can say that anyone who has studied a musical instrument at a high level will recognize much in this movie's story.

1188421,5,B000005XXD,"As a concert pianist myself, this is one of my favorite movies of all time.  Shirley MacLaine is extraordinary in the role of an aged concert pianist coach.  Her eccentricity, makes for such an endearing performance.  Her dedication to her craft and students.

The young boy Manik, (studying to be a concert pianist with Sousatzka)  represents the new.. the young the hip. The disjunct between the characters is interesting.

The music is glorious, mainly the composers: Beethoven, Schubert and Schumann.

Twiggy's character as a pseudo-talented pop singer as a quirky dimension to the plot.

What is funny and would never happen to a concert pianist in real life:

The scene where Soutsatza flashes back to her debut performance where she completely forgets the music and storms off the stage in romantic fervor drama LOL  So high camp.  That would never happen to a concert pianist in real life. Concert pianist are so well programmed in memorization of the music that even if there was a memory lapse, they would fake it to the end or end it quickly with some logical musical cadence. Never would they just stop playing.

I am just so annoyed and a bit insulted that this movie is not on dvd (with extras!!!).... It is Shirley's best work next to Sweet Charity.

This movie has extraordinary heart and is a beautiful look into the lives of piano coaches. As a concert pianist and coach myself.. I do understand that we indeed feel our students are our children.  Shirley plays the dynamic perfectly.  The other older tenant characters including a quirky downstairs lady and a closeted gay male add addition warmth to the work.

1188425,4,B000005XXD,"A 15 year old Indian piano prodigy (Navin Chowdhry) is taken under the wing of the great piano teacher Madame Sousatzka (Shirley MacLaine). It's not long before Sousatzka clashes with the lad's mother (Shabana Azmi) who is eager for the boy to start playing concerts before the teacher thinks he's ready. It doesn't help when a promoter (Leigh Lawson) attempts to lure the young man away from his teacher and enter the commercial world. While the story (based on the novel by Bernice Rubens) isn't particularly original, the screenplay by Ruth Prawer Jhabvala (HOWARDS END) provides a solid framework for MacLaine's terrific performance, one of her very best. MacLaine's Sousatzka is one of those brilliant monsters for whom Art (in this case, music) takes precedence over everything, investing her very heart and soul into the ""children"" she creates even as her heart gets broken every time. She's surrounded by a colorful company of assorted characters played by Peggy Ashcroft, Twiggy, Geoffrey Bayldon and Sam Howard. The capable direction is by John Schlesinger and while the film is far removed from his superb work in the 1960s and 1970s, it's still a solid example of good craftsmanship.

1188427,5,B000005XXD,"""Madame Sousatzka"" is a film I initially watched back when it came out in 1988; I enjoy classical music so I saw it the first week of its national release.  The movie is a good depiction of the many trials that a talented fifteen-year-old boy is likely to face when confronted with the challenge of having to make adult decisions.  While the adult characters in the cast played major roles at encouraging the main character to pursue his passion of playing piano, there are several scenes in the film where they also emphasized that there are more things to life than music.  They include the birthday party sequence where all the festivities are fun to watch; the several sequences where young character lusts after (ex-fashion model) Twiggy; but my favorite scene is the opening one seconds before main character takes a seat at the piano to play a Scriabin etude before an attentive audience --which includes the obsessive piano teacher, Madame Sousatzka --played by Shirley MacClaine.  In this opening scene, John Schlesinger effectively shows emotional range of his main character before he steps onstage apparently prepared to perform; I had to play before an assembly just as Manek at sixteen.  I visited London back in the early eighties, so as I watched the film it also brought back fond memories of my visit to that part of England.  I highly recommend ""Madame Sousatzka"" to all lovers of classical music and anyone who has ever had to go through something behavioral experts refer to as ""growing pains.""",1356998400,,1515,4.8984375

1188431,5,B000005XXD,"I had watched this film several years ago (probably more than ten), and like some of those events and experiences that stay with you in the recesses of your mind, this one stayed with me for a long time.  As Amazon's outreach has expanded dramatically over the past decade, I have found it to be a great resource to dig up and find precious works of art and literature, including rare ones (Ebay does a similar job, albeit with its differences).

One such film that I have not found in DVD format was Letter from an Unknown Woman; the other was Madame Sousatzka.  I believe both films deserve circulation in DVD, and cannot recommend them strongly enough.  When Hollywood, and its poorer clone Bollywood are obsessed with skin flicks and action flicks, or formulaic concoctions designed to dazzle with sounds and visuals while barely scratching the variegations of the human mind- these films are both rare and refreshing in their timelessness and their humanity.  They will appeal to audiences old and young, old-fashioned or forward-thinking.

I am gratified that this film has received fairly strong recommendations from a large majority of the reviewers here.  The negative reviews are relatively sparse.  Now, I do not as a rule subscribe to popular ratings in ascertaining value in any work of art or creativity.  In this instance, however, I am with the majority, and have given the film five stars.

One reviewer found this film exploitative at several levels.  In the latter reviewer's estimate, the young prodigy Manek was being exploited by a troika of women: Madame Sousatzka herself, his mother Sushila and the ""pop-star-wannabe"" Jenny.  The reviewer seemingly makes a plausible psychological argument of child-abuse (in this case of a young boy by several women), and asserts that many will not view this as ""creepy"" unless the genders are reversed.  I admit that such oversight does happen every so often, and society does appear to be far more willing to brand men as pedophiles or exploiters than it does women.  Part of reason is rather likely to be that such events do happen much more frequently in the men-exploiting-women-or-minors mold.

I would argue, however, that this film, made with both sensitivity and insight, as well as great visuals and sound by John Schlesinger and his team, is not exploitative in any overt, intentional, psychologically deranged way.  In fact, it may be viewed as entirely non-exploitative in the sense that each character is depicted as a product of its own circumstances, and is believably human.  I did not see anything exploitative or least of all incestuous in the relationship of Sushila (played with wonderful grace by Shabana Azmi), the single mother who is raising her gifted son Manek in London, while running a catering business from home, and her aforementioned son.  Being Bengali myself, and without wishing to sound too jaded, let me mention that it is commonplace for Bengali mothers to dote on their sons- the great nineteenth-century poet Madhusudan Dutta (1828-1873) immortalized this in his tribute to the beloved social reformer, Vidyasagar (1820-1891), whom he famously described as having ""The wisdom of an ancient sage, the courage of an Englishman, and the heart of a Bengali mother.""

There is nothing exploitative or incestuous in a mother's desire to see her musical-prodigy son becoming a famous concert pianist.  It may seem restrictive to the (minor) son's other intentions or interests, yes, but this is played out every day, even under more normal conditions.

As for Madame Sousatzka, the central character here, played with uncanny feeling by the redoubtable Shirley MacLaine- I see her as ultimately tragic and yet stubbornly unchangeable.  Yes, the flashbacks depict her as a one-time prodigy who failed to reach the heights of success in public performances that her own mother and she herself once desired.  Yes, the story depicts her as a deeply dedicated piano teacher who is perhaps unrealistically protective of her talented pupils (with one that more recently left her roost for greater commercial success, and for whom she likely nurtures not-so-platonic feelings).  Yet, what is uncommon about the clash of pure art versus commercial success in human affairs?  What is unrealistic or exploitative about Madame telling Mrs. Sen that she is entirely against commercialism and profits?

Where the film triumphs in terms of its realism is in fact Maneks's own, un-coerced decision to both perform on the London stage as a debutante, and also to leave Madame for a more commercially successful teacher.  Clearly, this breaks Madame's heart, and further negates any alleged exploitative dimension in the film.

The ""pop-artist"" Jenny is also a tragic character here.  We observe a real exploiter and predator here in the music promoter who sexually preys upon Jenny, and also manages to pry Manek away from Madame Sousatzka.  All these characters are entirely believable and portrayed realistically.  A second layer of exploitation is shown in the machinations of the real-estate developer who works overtime, deviously and heartlessly to evict the elderly residents of the complex where Madame lives.

I view the final scene, where the one-time student (and flame?) brings along a new charge for Madame, even as Manek leaves for greener pasture, as a play on irony and the cyclical nature of her fate- one that she cannot change no matter how hard she tries.",1313452800,2,5452,5.111612175873732
1188432,1,B000005XXD,"""Madame Sousatzka"" is the story of Manek, a sixteen year old boy with a prodigious musical talent, and the three older women who try to use him in various ways for their own gratification.

First there is Mme Sousatzka herself, a grandmotherly Russian piano teacher with a failed concert career and a history of forming inappropriate relationships with her under-aged male students. Throughout the film, she is constantly primping and trying to make herself physically attractive to Manek. She also showers him with gifts of clothing, tries to control his relationships with other people (particularly women), and throws jealous tantrums when he doesn't pay enough attention to her.

Then there is Manek's mother, whose principal goal is to turn Manek into a well-paid concert performer so that she can live the life she thinks she deserves. The development of his talent is simply a means to an end for her. Like Mme Sousatzka, she also exhibits jealousy when Manek tries to form relationships with other people, and she uses the same kind of baby-doll seductiveness toward him that she displays toward her boyfriends.

Finally, there is Jenny, a pop-star wannabe approaching middle age, who recognizes in Manek's talent something that she will never achieve. Seeing that Manek has a crush on her, she decides to have sex with him -- primarily to drive away her own sense of failure.

Many reviewers see this film as some kind of ""coming of age"" saga. It's not. It's about three older women who violate a young boy's trust by having various kinds of inappropriate relationships with him, when they ought to know better. In the long run, this is going to cause Manek to devalue himself and have trouble forming normal relationships.

If you doubt this appraisal, just flip the characters' genders and see how the story sounds:

* ""Monsieur Sousatzka"" is an aging (male) piano teacher who has romantic designs on a sixteen year old girl student.

* The girl's father makes veiled sexual suggestions to the girl as a way of getting her to do what he wants.

* Sousatzka's upstairs neighbor is a middle-aged pop singer who sees that the girl has a crush on him, and seduces her to gratify his own ego.

Suddenly not such a ""coming of age"" story, is it? More like child abuse. Our culture doesn't tolerate this kind of thing when the perpetrators are men, but for the most part turns a blind eye when the perps are older women and the victims are male.

This is a creepy film. Even creepier because it ends with one of Mme Sousatzka's former boy students bringing a new young man to study with her. The cycle of abuse continues with a new victim...",1228867200,4,2644,4.765864332603939

1188434,4,B000005XXD,"This is a very fine portrayal of the bullying, exploitation, and lack of interpersonal boundaries that pervade the classical music industry. I give it four stars for its entertaining ""true-to-lifeness""---even the boy's mother uses him incestuously. The only reason I didn't give it five is that Schlesinger himself exploits his adolescent star at times, probably unconsciously (as in the massage scene). Instead of growing up and/or getting the intensive psychotherapy they so desperately need, these people will continue to perpetuate their unhealthy dynamics transgenerationally. The proof is in the statements of the other reviewers: no one has spotted that this boy is constantly being abused. The proof is also in the characters themselves: the movie ends with Souzatska's former student walking a new junior to her studio. He will never wake up to the fact that the woman is disturbed...and actually rather evil. Instead, the cycle of mental damage will continue for decades, if not centuries.",1195689600,2,999,5.410256410256411
1188435,2,B000005XXD,"Derivative elements hinder story of an eccentric Russian piano teacher in a decaying neighborhood of London (a literary descendant of Jean Brodie and possibly Auntie Mame) who coaches a brilliant immigrant youngster from India in music and life. Modest drama, marked with false uplift and poor color, contains a multitude of sub-plots which never come together cohesively, serving little purpose other than to pad the slim central story. Shirley MacLaine has good moments as Yuvline Sousatzka, yet the character herself rings curiously hollow, despite MacLaine's obvious desire to make this woman both human and larger-than-life. Director John Schlesinger was probably too grim a filmmaker for such material; with the exception of a remarkable final shot of a neighborhood in transition, Schlesinger's touches are too heavy (he's hardly the filmmaker to find whimsy in any scenario). The screenplay is made up of musty literary mechanisms, though young Navin Chowdhry nearly makes the set-up plausible.",1193529600,4,1002,5.555555555555555
1188436,5,B000005XXD,"A piano teacher lives into a glittering  environment, plenty of expensive jewels in order to cultivate and inspire constantly the spirit, but the fate has prepared her a striking surprise when she looks her dark side in the mirror of the reality, personified by a teenager (15) who was born with an inner passion.

Interesting existential dialectics between what's real and what's untrue in this formidable clash of trains among two characters, the ostentation of experience against the rebelliousness of youth around th music and its intrinsic values.

A bold film brilliantly acted and best directed.",1186444800,,602,5.25
1188437,5,B000005XXD,"I just watched this movie on an old vhs taped off of HBO from the late 80's! Terrible quality and sound, but a fantastic movie nontheless and it reminds me so much of my childhood. I need this on DVD. Who do we petition to get this on DVD?!?!",1172793600,9,242,3.9591836734693877
1188438,5,B000005XXD,"I appreciate this film more now than I did when it first came out and wish it were more generally available, especially on DVD.  While it certainly is a great vehicle for Shirley MacLaine, it is more than just a showcase for her.  It is a story about transitions, of being between worlds and finding one's way through being defined by others.  The ostensible point of the story is the art of playing classical piano.

Madame Sousatzka (MacLaine) is an older and famous piano teacher.  She is known for her authoritarian and, well, old fashioned ways.  However, she produces students who can really play.  The problem is they tend to leave her.  Of course, one thing piano teachers (all teachers) know when a student starts with them is that the relationship will, at some point, come to an end as the student goes off on their own path.  In reality, a great teacher knows this and the very best ones teach their students to become independent and able to learn and work on their own.  However, the teaching of piano is still the older style of master - student intimacy and when a student leaves before the master is ready or if the student is rejected by the master, well, terrible hurts are unavoidable.

Madame's rigidity and demanding demeanor come from her own training from her mother, who was an even greater concert artist.  The studio is dominated by a large portrait of her mother and so much of what Sousatzka does flows from her relationship with her mother.  The mother, though, was not a healthy teacher for her daughter.  During the movie we learn about a terrible source of pain and fear that still grips Madame at the present time of the movie.  It has paralyzed her for much of her life, even while Madame still idolizes and imitates her mother more than she knows.  For Sousatzka the transitions are between a past world that has a dying place in the present and the question of whether she can ever get free of her mother and her own painful memories.

The student in this movie is Manek Sen (played quite well by Navin Chowdhry).  He is a brilliantly talented boy from an immigrant family.  He has his own domination problems with his own mother and then gets into a domineering student-teacher relationship with Sousatzka.  He has pressures from his mother who constantly lets her know of all her sacrifices (working and selling her jewelry) to get him his training and wants to be taken care of.  Manek doesn't like the man she has taken up with, and wants to use his gifts to provide for her (his father has died).  Since musical prodigies make good box office, he is also being pursued by an agent who wants to get him on the stage - the agent is also trying to get him to another teacher.  Manek also has terrible pressures about his own Indian culture versus the European culture he is living in and whose music he is learning to play.  Sousatzka is trying to remake him into a European so he can play the music more completely, but his mother resists the change because of her own desires to keep her boy close to her.

Madame is dead set against him going to the stage to early, because of her own painful experience.  And this holding back from the stage is what causes her students to leave.  They want to play.  She wants to spare them from the pain of failing on stage without ever explaining it.

Well, I don't want to share how all this comes together, but the ending of the movie does have transitions made and not everything is wrapped up neatly.  However, we know more about where everyone is going and understand why.

As for the playing in the movie, it is pretty good.  The difference between the student playing of pieces and the teacher is interestingly different.  And the concert performances do make sense.  However, this is not so much a movie about classical music as using classical music to tell its real story.",1146873600,5,3861,4.539797395079595
1188439,5,B000005XXD,"This is wonderful movie whose release on DVD is long overdue.  Shirley McLaine was wonderful as Madame Sousatzka -- a bit like my own red-haired, eccentric piano teacher in college.  The plot and characters are unique and memorable.  What a shame this exceptional movie has not been released on DVD by now.",1139616000,18,306,4.846153846153846
1188440,5,B000005XXD,"I've been a piano teacher for the last 24 (almost 25 years) and I loved this movie. I have owned it for many years and watch it on a regular basis.

 I thought Shirley McClaine and the rest of the cast were absolutely perfection in their roles. Shirley Maclaine completely became Madame Souzatska, she transcended the art of acting.

 This story about an very eccentric (though very good hearted) piano teacher and her relationship with a teenage virtuoso (named Manek Sen) is truly a classic piece of art. There are so many levels going on at once, not only with these key characters, but the others as well.

 There is Manek's single mom who has sacrificed everything for her son and wants him to be able to perform and prosper as quickly as possible, while Madame Souzatska wants to let the boy mature as an artist. There is the dynamic of the elderly ""Lady Emily"", Mr. Cordle and Madame Souzatska, who have been living in the same building forever and are like a family along with the pretty young aspiring Pop singer Jenny (Twiggy) who also lives in the building.

 Jenny has a boyfriend who is an artist agent who becomes enamored with the young virtuoso and wants to promote his talents. At the same time Manek has developed a crush on Jenny. Both of these things go against the grain for Madame Souzatka and create a subtle tension. As I said, there's a lot of levels all interacting at the same time that create a wonderful tapestry of dynamics and emotions.

 I won't try to give to many details of this movie because I couldn't do it justice. All I can say is that it is a favorite of mine and I do hope that they'll put it out on DVD. Even though I already have it on VHS I would gladly purchase a DVD copy as well!",1122595200,3,1727,4.385579937304075

Newcomer Navin Chowdhry impresses as the young pianist, and of course, Shirley MacLaine stirs the heart and agitates the senses as Madame Sousatzka.
