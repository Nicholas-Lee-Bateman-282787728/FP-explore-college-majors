8360540,4,B002AWM0VI,"Many films and documentaries have been made since James Dean's untimely death in 1955. Ray Connelly's 'James Dean The First American Teenager' [1976] is one of the better ones. It chronicles Dean's short life from farm boy to new rising star. An alienated and rebellious figure who's death created mass hysteria that would make him a Hollywood icon. Featuring exclusive interviews with Sal Mineo who was brutally murdered in 1976 and Natalie Wood who mysteriously drowned in 1981, both give fascinating insights into James Dean the man and his cultural impact on the world. Dennis Hopper's take on Dean gives the quote: In one hand I've got Marlon Brando yelling 'Screw you' and in the other Montgomery Clift asking 'Please help me'! A product of the 1970's era it includes a musical soundtrack from Elton John, David Bowie, Lou Reed and The Eagles. Great documentary inclusion for James Dean fans.",1463356800,,898,4.993333333333333

The film it self is not in that great condition considering it was put together in 1974. It remains however
one of the better Dean bios.",1273449600,4,241,4.5
8360543,2,B002AWM0VI,"This 1975 production features interviews with many of those who knew James Dean best, such as Bill Bixby, Sammy Davis Jr. and Dennis Hopper. He'd only been dead 20 years when this was made, but he'd been a cult figure for years before. You get the sense that Dean was far more interesting in person than he comes across in the three movies he made or the very lame TV roles he did. This early documentary is interspersed with several jarring contemporary rock songs by the likes of Elton John. There's a lot of footage from his movies, which seem very dated today. Dozens, if not hundreds, of films have been made about James Dean who only has three film roles to his name: ""East of Eden,"" ""Rebel Without A Cause"" and ""Giant."" He always seemed to look much older than the ""teenager"" he played. Still, the various still photos of Dean are what made him the cult figure he is today, not his acting, in my opinion. This dated film is probably not among the best if you are curious about James Dean.",1269129600,3,995,4.413043478260869
