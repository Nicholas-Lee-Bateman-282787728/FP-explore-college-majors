An authentic spiritual journey into the darkness of giving one's personal power away and losing  one's self:  the very essence of evil.  It leads to self-empowerment and  spiritual awakening.  An amazing experience.",931996800,2,328,5.591836734693878
768310,5,630403220X,"A virtual ""diamond in the rough"" of boorish contemporary horror movies, this film contains everything a good vampire fable needs to grow up big and strong; haunting imagery, a believable performance by the  exquisitely addictive yet often overlooked Lili Taylor (fear not, for  another potent ""fix"" of her fine acting talent, see ""I Shot  Andy Warhol""), and an innovative, thought provoking  perpective on the  vampire mythos. Last but not least, the great Christopher Walken shines in  a scene so compelling, it begs comparison to Sir Laurence Olivier's  confrontation with Frank Langella's Count in the 1979 film version of  ""Dracula"".  This film is pure art, with a powerful stream of  conciousness to guide the viewer along to it's enlightened ending. A  must-see for any true fan of the genre.",913852800,,798,5.15625

768443,2,630403220X,"Abel Ferrara gave a shot at the vampire genre and the result is ""The Addiction"", an interesting but flawed movie that fails to convice. Lili Taylor plays a NY philosophy student who gets bitten by a vampire woman. That experience will change her life and the way she views the world, offering new perspectives and goals. While this is a somewhat promising idea, the plot never sems to surprise all that much, so it gets a point where it keeps repeating and moving nowhere new.
The movie touches a few points like existencialism, fate, guilt, sin, faith, nihlism and of course addiction, but the development could be better and it ends up seeming like unfullfilled potential. Still there are some intriguing elements, like the black and white cinematography, the moody atmosphere and some compelling, well written dialogue. But even considering these good ingredients, the movie doesn`t step above average material. ""The Addiction"" just lacks bite.",1075680000,,947,5.116129032258065
768444,2,630403220X,"I will not say that Abel Ferrara is not creative in his own way to make movies. This work proves that there is someone behind the camera full of ideas and a great thinker, No doubt about it. The problem is just the story. It could have been a great one but dunno what happened. It becomes easily boring and it's a pity. Acting is okay. Walken's got a little role in it, 10 minutes maximum. If you are curious about Abel Ferrara, well It's still worth few bux.",1069977600,,459,4.168539325842697
768445,4,630403220X,"I really enjoyed this movie. It's set in a very intellectual environment, with a dark side. When the main character becomes bitten by a vampire she gets pulled into the life of a vampire, a very addicted one. She's addicted to the life-style of a vampire but hates it. The movie is about her struggle with her sinfull life-style.
 It's not a movie comparing vampirism to aids and drugs so much, but rather to human sin nature. Sin nature as presented in the movie though, is as addictive as drugs and contagious and incurable as aids. The movie did an excellent job of displaying the nature of sin to the audience. Notice first that the sin had to be chosen, victims were never forced. After they chose sin, they became addicted and couldn't, by their own means, be released from their addicted lifestyle. In this movie, it's not until you are saved can you finally find release from sin. Her nature had to be changed, not her environment, not her psyche. I think the theme of the movie is embodied in the quote from R.C. Sproul(A famous calvinist minister and speaker) at the end of the film, ""We are not sinners because we sin, we sin because we are sinners."" It was a movie about human nature, and the anatomy of sin the Biblical idea of sin (intended or not). Vampire stories in general are a study of sin.  Concider their hate for all things Christian, the love of death and destruction, their opposite lifestyle(sleeping upside down, night dwellers ect) So I found this movie a great one to add to the list of vampire movies that I love!
  I highly recomend this movie.  You'll have a lot of fun examining it and picking out the details that hold the secrets to the overall meaning of the film. Very philosophical!",1017532800,17,1720,4.535483870967742

768447,4,630403220X,"This vampire movie is possibly the most modern of its kind.  It has Taylor as a university student who is vamped in a back alley.  Soon after she finds that sunglight is an issue and she's drawing blood from tramps.  What makes it so modern is the fact that vampirism is used as a metaphor for both AIDS and drugs, with the 'disease' being passed from one person to another.  Later on there are scenes of Taylor injecting herself with a 'fix' of blood.  The Addiction takes the vampire movie out of Anne Rice territory and places it as a horrific urban myth.
Taylor really is superb in just about every role she plays, but here she's the leading part.  This is particularly rare for an actress best known for her supporting roles.  Strangely enough, the big name Annabella Sciorra has a relatively small part, although she does have a dominating presence for the scenes she is in.
Alongside its vampirism though are questions about the soul and redemption.  Perhaps the most intriguing idea that the movie has is that guilt is eternal and that people are drawn to sin because they are doomed already.  It is a rare movie of this genre that has a few ideas in its head, and also a rare one that is virtually incomparable to others of its type.  Obviously it won't be to everyone's taste, but its use of haunting imagery and different perspective on the vampire genre should be applauded.",1014508800,3,1386,4.55241935483871
768448,5,630403220X,"As the title indicates (not enough apparently) the film's about ADDICTION, and all it has to do with vampires is VAMPIRISM. For, The Addiction is No More a VAMPIRE Flick than Bram Stoker's 'Dracula' or Mary Shelley's 'Frankenstein' are merely monster movies! They, like Abel Ferrara's films, occupy a strange residence in the psyche of all who ever get to know them off the safety of a screen and its killing-room floor. Ferrara's films, such as The Addiction, are Darkly fascinated Entertainments for mainstream viewer's without any need for mild entertainments to diverge their work-a-days with some semblance of a comedy's smile, or the fixation of drama's tears; or in this case, the suspense of mutilated moments to squirm in one's seat, unless it be metaphysically.
Set to the tune of Cypress Hill's: 'I Want To Get High....So High'....in a crisp, letter-boxed, Black & white Surrealistic 1990's timepiece which begins in an NYU Philosophy Class with a photographic discussion of the Holocaust not for the historically squeamish, but meant for those who 'are doomed to repeat' the 'Old Adage of Santayana'.
It is a film where Lili Taylor plays an honor roll graduate candidate not satisfied with just WRITING her Ph. D.thesis, but valiantly attempting to LIVE it. Thus it begins, in both barely whispered tones of an dream-induced ecstasy only the greatest of narcotics can otherwise afford, or in all the agonized screams & whimpers of Narcoticized withdrawal where:
---""Physical dependency can teach you more than any amount of philosophical dissertation ever could""---
Of course there is a definite all-too-G.D.-Real sense of Actual HORROR in the film in that drug Withdrawal hurts as much as the metamorphosis of the Loup-Garou (the WereWolve which the Addict of Narcotica has an affinity to as much in the physical realm as Vampirism does in the Psychological/Spiritual---another Aspect of classical and Medieval horror that permeates the film is the Witch and the Mage, played ingeniously by both Walken and Sciorra. Also, the infamous Witch's Sabbath is equated with the drugged debauch in a scene essential to understanding the film. As is the standard entrance of Ferrara's Catholicism and the refuge of the church in the light of God. A possible resolution of conflicts is voiced in the same persistent priest that appears in several of Ferrara's films.
The entire approximately 90 min. film is made up of myriad quotes from Literature, Philosophy, History, Drama & Poetry & so on. This 'play on words' deals on the cutting edge of THE CORE ISSUES OF DRUG ADDICTION where a war which kills only the ones we love is far darker and more evilly absurd beyond the capabilities of this or any film to correctly portray unless it be an autopsy film by Stan Brakhage.
""WSBurrough's Naked Lunch, Beckett, Satre...What? You think these are works of Fiction!?!""---Shouts Christopher Walken, a consistent & potent presence (if not the central character) in virtually all of Ferrara's films.
In short, THE ADDICTION IS A METAPHYSICAL HORROR FILM more than another cheap Hollywood vampire flick done for the umpteenth time betting on a sure thumbed-up review amidst the pursuit of trumped-up media-goer's pockets.
And Abel Ferrara is unquestionably the most misunderstood filmmaker in the 'Unedit-ed Tastes of America'. He is also, alongside David Lynch, its greatest and most abused film asset, next to Dennis Hopper & good Columbian cocaine.",1010534400,5,3446,5.166368515205725
768449,2,630403220X,"No, really, what the hell was this?  This was one sorry excuse for a Vampire movie.  I figured with it being in Black and White and having Christopher Walken's name in the credits, it'd be a worthwhile Indie-Horror flick.  In all actuality, its a waste of time.  For the most part, its just really slow and predictable. (Ooh, she's gonna bite ANOTHER person in the neck...didn't see that one coming!) Believe me, even if you don't know much about Vampire history or folklore, like me, you can do a LOT more with a Vampire story than just neck biting.  I don't mind a movie with lots of interesting and ""thought provoking"" (I doubt that's spelled right) dialogue, but it usually helps if its actually interesting and more than just a way to fill in time and make the audience think they're watching something profound.  After Christopher Walken's one, Fifteen-Minute(!) scene (another huge dissapointment), I expected the movie to carry on into a new direction, and actually have a goal.  Needless to say, despite Walken's character and monologue, nothing much was done to enhance the direction of the movie.  The acting wasn't all that great, but it also wasn't all that terrible.  The cinematography and directing looked pretty damned good, but the whole script just ruined what could have been a good idea.  I think this was one of those times where someone just assumed that any movie thats labled an Indie and/or is in black and white is automatically good.

The acting is superlative, the mood is compelling, and the iconic imagery is extremely rich.  Lili Taylor hardly ever speaks above a whisper, which irritated me to no end.  Christopher Walken's too-brief appearance the best part of the movie, a flooding ray of light into a dark world.

768500,3,630403220X,"Strange low-budget Abel Ferrera film is much too pretentious, arty and slow moving to enjoy as horror film, but at times is a fascinating film which melds drug addiction and vampirism. It's not always sure what it wants to say or where it's going and in the end seems pointless (though there's a muddled message about spirituality in here).
It combines some ruminations on the philosophy of Kirkegarrd, Nietzsche, Sartre and shows us a woman struggling against personal convictions, desires and addictions.  When attempts are made to link all of this to things like the Holocaust, and the My Lai massacre it lost me, but it's an ambitious and at times interesting film shot in black and white.  It is slow going though.  Don't be fooled by the cast which includes Christopher Walken(a cameo), Lili Taylor and Annabella Sciorra and the presence of Ferrera into thinking there's some camp value in the film-it's a low budget serious arty film with very little humor.

Lili Taylor turns in an excellent performance as Kathleen, a philosophy student who is plunged into the dark world of the vampire.  As she is transformed gradually in the movie the fact that she is a philosophy student plays a large role.  She is forced to reconcile her new life with the existentialism that is the focus of her studies.  As she becomes more sure of herself in her new life, an elder vampire Peina (played by the creepy Christopher Walken) throws a wrench in the works.  Lili Taylor's voice is marvelous in the dark settings where her character contemplates her new existence with philosophy.  Where will her journey into darkness take her...?

768502,2,630403220X,"With a title like The Addiction you might expect this to be about some form of substance abuse and that's exactly the effect director Abel Ferrara (King of New York) wanted it to have.  It's an interesting new spin but on the vampire gere but doesn't quite work because he doesn't follow through, allowing the film to fall into a slump which it never pulls out of.  Lili Taylor (an exellent actress with bad taste in scripts) plays an NYU student whose bitten and finds herself turning into a vampire,  craving blood.  She becomes dependant on it, as a heroin addict would, and even goes into withdraw when she goes without it.  Her decent is slow and alarming but anybody who attempts to interfer winds up an unwilling donor to her dependancy.  As I said, interesting - not entertaining.  For the duration of the movie she knocks off old school chums, teachers, strangers, you name it and after awhile my interest began to waver and it suddenly seemed like a much longer film than it's 82 minute running time.  Shot entirely in black and white, a gimmick which ought to be reserved for Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg.  And for fans of Christopher Walken, though second billed, his part is little more than an extended cameo.  Probably the most interesting in all the cast members is Edie Falco, in her pre-Soprano days.  You're not likely to  find much value in this unless you're a die hard horror fan, in which case - bon apetite.",971568000,2,1439,4.622047244094488
768503,3,630403220X,"One of Abel Ferrara's interesting failures -- a philosophical art-house vampire movie, shot in stark b&w, with Lili Taylor as a philosophy student who gets bitten by Annabella Sciorra and tailspins into the madness  of hunger. How could it miss? Well, there's a reason that ""Bad Lieutenant""  is Ferrara's best film: It wasn't written by Nicholas St. John, whose  scripts for Ferrara have been pretentious at best, ham-handed at worst.  This one is both. When we're not watching the humorless Taylor shooting up  blood or blathering about deep stuff, we're wincing at death-camp footage.  One can almost justify the images of real-life atrocity as Ferrara's usual  outrageousness, but after a while the gallery of Holocaust horror just  seems like a cheap, unearned way for St. John to beef up his themes of  collective guilt and evil in modern society. Taylor is compelling, Ken  Kelsch's photography is riveting, and Christopher Walken is amusing in a  small role as some sort of vicious vamp guru.",964742400,,999,5.067484662576687
768504,3,630403220X,"Abel Ferrara's foray into the arena of vampire movies stars Lili Taylor as an NYU graduate student of philosophy named Kathleen Conklin. Ferrara's usual suspects crowd the film - Edie Falco plays another grad student,  Annabella Sciorra plays a mysterious vampire woman, and Christopher Walken  is on hand for a typically skin-crawling cameo. This moody black &  white movie makes no secret of the fact that it is largely a parable of  heroin addiction. ""The Addiction"" is replete with ideas, but most  of them are fairly murky. Some of the themes include the idea of  intellectualism as vampirism, predation as ethical relativism, the  existentialism of modern life, the nature of evil, and the culpability of  all humans in evil acts such as the My Lai massacre and the Holocaust.  Paradoxically, ""The Addiction"" is an indictment of  intellectualism, but it seems to beg for a doctoral level of analysis.  Probably the most fully realized aspect of this slow-moving film is its  depiction of city life as a decaying and fetid unlife.

Still to this day, I kind of struggle to completely and fully grasp the entire concept of 'The Addiction.'  However I do appreciate the different spin on vampires mixed with its philosophical approach, Biblical and drug affliction.  The setting is also urban NYC and it's soundtracks has old school 90s hip-hop.

This movie doesn't show the audience fangs -- as we mostly see in tons of vampire films -- but again, there is an underling and theological approach that will challenge the viewers blended with it's typical scare factor.  To put it directly, the film is simply different and unique!  Not to mention adding to its style the movie is not in Technicolor but yet black and white filming.

The acting is exceptional!  Lili Taylor steals the show doing justice for another role she plays.  For those vampire or horror fans and those who deeply have a philosophical side who likes seeing the age old vampire tale dissected again, check this one out.

7860166,2,630403220X,"A friend of mine referred to/gave a summation of director Abel Ferrarra thus:  ""Tarrantino without the humor.""  In the case of ""Addiction,"" he is mos def on-the-money. It's an interesting concept for a movie - vampirism-as-an-addiction - but what brings it crashing down is a lot of blame-the-victim-type ""philosophy"", i.e., ""If you REALLY don't want me to bite you & drink your blood, you should just say so in a straightforward manner!  NEVER MIND that I'm CRUSHING YOUR HAND with my undead strength & scaring the living daylights (no pun intended) outta you - I have to have some b******t rationale for what I'm doing, just like any criminal or psychopath, so I don't have to feel bad about it later.""  Also the pacing is REALLY slow & much of the dialogue is right out of a freshman philosophy class study-group: ""We aren't evil because we do evil - we do evil because we ARE evil.""  Wow, DEEP!  Nothing like knee-high nihilism and ivory-tower blather, huh?  I'm sure Ted Bundy and Joe Stalin had some cheesy ""philosophy"" to help them ""justify"" their monstrous behavior, too...not to mention Ayn Rand.  Chris Walken shows up briefly to babble and look a lot like Shemp Howard.

If you're into the vampire mythos, you'd be better off renting DVD's of ""True Blood"" or ""Forever Knight"" or, for a genuinely funny  version of the Dracula tale, the movie ""Love at First Bite.""  Otherwise, ""The Addiction"" is for Lili Taylor fans only.",1318291200,,1432,4.780487804878049

However, I was rather disappointed with the actual film.  It didn't seem like the writer really knew what they were talking about.  Hardcore philosophy geeks will be turned off by the fact that the film has a very immature understanding of the writers that are quoted.  The dialog was delivered with very little passion;  I couldn't believe any of the actors.  The main character is bit by a vampire, and slowly goes crazy, delivering senseless lines while biting her victims all the while writing a philosophy thesis.  Mid-way through, she meets Christopher Walken, who decides to say things that are supposed to sound intelligent, drink her blood, and then disappear for the rest of the film(?).

I think the film was trying to talk about something that neither the actors nor the writer really understood, and so the film turned into a series of out-of-context philosophical quotes (with perhaps a small exception at the end) delivered with zero passion.  I really can't recommend this movie to anyone.",1262995200,,1263,5.0
7860168,1,630403220X,"First, imagination if you will, a college student out there, somewhere, decides to write a script that deals with the philosophy of evil.  Then that person gets some money.  Let us say, oh, five dollars or more.  Maybe more.  Maybe he found some coins in his Dad's old truck.  He runs over to a garage sale and buys a camera in which he stuffs in some black and white film.  Then he hires some of the best actors, like Christopher Walken, and some others to play in his story.  Then he films it.  Some scenes are in the street.  In fact most are.  But he does dish out some money for some better places.  Like restrooms and art museums.  More likely art stores.  No editors are involved.

7860169,1,630403220X,"Have you heard the one that involves vampires going to college to learn philosophy?  Opening like a simple joke one could overhear at a bar, ""The Addiction"" is yet another fledgling disaster by director Abel Ferrara.  Unlike your typical philosophical joke, this one involves a plethora of detailed information, actors excited by the material - destroyed by the finished product, and a score that completely misses the tone of the overall film.  Yep, I am going to come out punching with this one, because for nearly 80-some odd minutes, I tried ... I tried to get into Ferrara's mind, into his details, into his rhythm, but could not find anything to attach myself too.  This was one of those films college philosophy classes drool over trying to find the inside jokes, the powerful double meanings, and the hidden power of the words - but for me, a simple film viewer, this one went over my head, displayed a lack of talent, yet showed me strength with failed opportunity.  ""The Addiction"" remains on VHS without the transfer to DVD for a particular reason, and while I will honestly give a reason for my disgust, I don't foresee a transfer in this films future, unless the dollar bin has any space to fill.

""The Addiction"" has two prerequisites one must accomplish prior to even thinking of enjoying this feature.  The first is that you must have some knowledge of philosophy to comprehend the rants that Taylor gives (both in and out of character) - even if it is simply an introduction class, you will be in a better position that I was.  The second is that you must have watched or have heard of the Jim Jarmusch film ""Dead Man"".  In fact, when looked closer upon, these two films could be companions to each other - both giving nearly a full college credit within the parameters of the opening and closing credits.  With these two prerequisites under your belt, you are ready to endure the truth - no matter how painful Ferrara makes it.  I tried to enjoy ""Bad Lieutenant"" as much as I could, the cult status sky-rocketing the hypothetical stock price of Harvey Keitel's portrayal of a corrupt cop, but it just wasn't the film I was hoping for.  ""The Addiction"" falls within the same.  I wanted a powerful moment of cinema helmed by Lily Taylor, Christopher Walken, Edie Falco, et al, but instead a was handed 80+ minutes of incoherent gibberish.  Have you seen ""I Shot Andy Warhol""?  If you find yourself with the answer of ""yes"", than you have seen an identical character delivered by Lily Taylor.  Ranting, raving, and pushing the limits of independence, Taylor finds herself welcomed unrepentantly into the world of the vampire.  Using reverse psychology, philosophical rants, and even the taste of drugs, Taylor becomes a creature of the night - ready to suck blood and bore to sleep.

The rest of the characters attempt to give something to camera, but that piece of machinery doesn't lie.  Falco is as stiff as a board, Walken tries to steal his scenes, but they merely interpret into hack philosophy quotes.  Then we have others (like Fredro Star) that one could mention, but it would just waste your time.  The camera focus' on Taylor, and while I can get lost in her blunt mannerism, this wasn't the film for her talents.  The picture didn't seem to match the artists, and vice versa.  The music didn't seem to match the theme, and the emotion didn't seem to match the words.  ""Addiction"" felt like a student film, pushing the limits of nothing while trying to seem more artistic than entertaining.  The line was fuzzy.  I needed either a deeper character study or a deeper plot, I wanted something that would make me think - not bend my mind unwillingly.  The language seemed forced and the plot seemed unrealistic.  I realize that this is a film about vampires, but two scenes made me shudder uncontrollably (and not in a good way).  The first is when Taylor drugs her professor using the infamous ""in"" and ""out"" method, and the second was when Taylor has the party and everyone goes ballistic - as if nobody will notice that people are missing.  I needed more development, more explanation, more voice to this philosophical film.  Ferrara could have made this into a breathtaking film that explored possibilities, but instead he let the camera slide, let the music destroy the scene, and allowed our actors to go character-less throughout the entire film.  In essence, the film imploded.

Overall, I wish I had something positive to say about this film.  I wanted to like it, because I thought the cast was incredible - such big names - but nobody seemed to work for the pennies they were probably making.  This film is a blemish on Walken's career, proving that he cannot save everything.  The hokie black and white choice for cinematography was creative, but not original.  It distracted from our central focus and forced us to scurry around near the end of the film to find it.  This is an independent film, but that doesn't mean that it is a good independent film.  There are problems throughout this feature that destroy the characters, sound, and sights throughout.  It is hard to watch, just like ""Dead Man"", and may even put you to sleep before you know what happens.  The characters were forced or non-existent, the sound was horrid (completely didn't match the film's tone), and the story was bland.  This was yet another way of trying to appeal to smarter viewers without actually listening.  Sure, throw in philosophical words - that makes any feature better (did you hear the sarcasm?) - but with ""Addiction"" nothing could save it.  There is one final scene that is the epitome of how I felt about this movie, it is right before the party when Taylor is so angry she destroys a closet while trying to rip her clothes off.  If one had a camera in my house, I believe you would have seen the same thing as this film came to a close.  Please avoid - it isn't worth the VHS it is printed on.

Grade: * out of *****",1193788800,2,5944,4.665706051873199
7860170,5,630403220X,"I found this movie fascinating and watched it a number of times.  Whatever it may be, it certainly isn't a classic vampire film, let alone a cheap exploitation flick along the lines of ""Vampiric Lesbians from Outer Space"" (I made that title up).

Vampirism in the movie is presented as more a disease than something supernatural.  There really aren't any special effects, except for an intimation that the anti-heroine (Taylor) has superhuman strength.  Except for one prolonged scene where a party literally turns into a ""feast for the damned,"" it isn't even particularly violent (the black and white tends to mute that).

Lily Taylor is a very interesting actress with a true penchant doing odd roles.  She isn't a classic beauty, but she is attractive, and the character she plays has a sort of dark charisma that I found pretty fascinating.  About the only other depiction of a female vampire that I liked as much if not better was Julie Carmen in ""Fright Night II"" (but that's a radically different flick).  Taylor's vampire was compelling enough that I wonder whether I would tell her ""to just go away"" (something that apparently drives away vampires in this film's universe).

One knock against the film I suppose is a rather cryptic ending.  I won't spoil it, but suffice to say, I was left wondering what exactly happened to the character of Kathleen at the end.  Also, I think Christopher Walken was underused in the film.  He's a great actor, and I would have liked to have seen more of him in it.

One last thing...someone else tagged the movie with ""lesbian vampire.""  I don't think that really is valid.  Yes, the character of Kathleen attacks several women, but she also attacks men.  One gets the impression that such a vampire feeds on whoever might cross her path.",1165968000,5,1782,4.79344262295082
7860171,5,630403220X,"""One aspect of determinism is manifested in the fact that the unsaved don't recognize the sin in their lives; they're unconscious of it. They don't suffer pangs of conscience because they don't recognize evil exists. This is because they're all predestined to Hell and therefore never brought to the Light of metanoia{conversion}...so when considering the salvatory aspects of facing guilt, suffering is a good thing. We should all hope to feel guilty, to feel pain, so we can seek pardon and ultimately freedom. Guilt is a sign that god is working out your destiny, and it's a foolish person who refuses to acknowledge this.""

The above quote is taken from the film, and is given by Kathleen's[Lili Taylor]philosophy professor, alluding to the thematic framework for Abel Ferrara's powerful and allegoric tale of redemption vis-a-vis existentialism meets vampirism ...similar to how Jim Jarmusch incorporated existentialism and mysticism into the western genre with his brilliant ""Dead Man""[also filmed in black and white.]

""The Addiction"" is quite unique, not your average horror movie. Don't be fooled by the ridiculous looking video box cover{no DVD available}. I'd seen it many years ago and stumbled on it again as IFC aired it late Halloween night. It's stark, grim, futile, very 'human'...the story need be in order to propell Kathleen toward the possibility of salvation. As most people aren't inclined to examine the metaphysical and philosophic elements of existence, the film may be substantively lost on many viewers who won't be bothered with a movie that requires thinking and feeling outside of the usual pedestrian horror movie cliches. The focus here is soul sickness, redemption and Christian iconography, much like Ferrara's wrenching ""Bad Lieutenant.""

Taylor gives a pained performance as an ordinary college student coming to terms with the vast array of evil deeds carried out by mankind. This is framed within her academic studies{philosophy, examining war atrocities}, but when she is violently attacked{yet chosen/accepted}while walking home one night, reality forces her from detached, speculative positions on evil into the burdensome gravity of facing that which is a very real aspect of humanity. You fear for her yet are fearful of her, and the nature of her addiction remains elusive.

In one scene, Kathleen seduces a fellow student in a library, coaxes her back to her apartment in order to feed. The distraught girl stands sobbing in front of the bathroom mirror, applying a bandage to her neck as Kathleen coldly sizes her up.

Her victim pleads ""don't you care what you did to me! doesn't it affect you?"" She replies, ""Why didn't you tell me to leave, to get lost like you really meant it? My indifference is not the concern here; it's your astonishment that needs studying.""

In another scene, Kathleen, checking herself over in the mirror before going out, thinks to herself, ""is it wrong for me to draw blood? No. It's the violence of my will over theirs.""

There's similar dialogue throughout, examining attitudes of moral ambivalence and apathy toward evil, even our species' desire for it. At the story's conclusion, Kathleen, now hospitalized after a heinous binge feeding, is confronted by the woman who initially attacked her, or, who she oddly submitted to. She symbolizes a quasi devil-on-your-shoulder attempting to justify evil, moral indifference and will to power just before the pastor arrives to give Kathleen her ""last rites.""

""Nobody can fall so low unless he has a great depth. If such a thing can happen to a man, it challanges his best and highest on the other side; that is to say, this depth corresponds to a potential height, the blackest darkness to a hidden light."" ~ C.G.Jung

Given the realistic griminess and overall bluntness of the film, it concludes with a rather lyrical and moving scene of redemption and salvation, haunted by Kathleen's voice-over ...""To face what we are in the end, we stand before the Light, and our true nature is revealed; self-revelation is annihilation of self.""",1131148800,20,4061,5.150227617602428

The Addiction has some good things and some bad things, so I can't agree with David Thomson (The New Biographical Dictionary of Film) that the movie is ""brilliant,"" but it's worth watching. I like Kathleen, who wants to know the truth about herself is even if it's unbearable, better than Abel Ferrara's self-pitying Bad Lieutenant. Kathleen is a lot like Marti in the Ferrara film Body Snatchers, and at the end she is just as unreliable a narrator as Marti. (Nicholas St. John was also one of the writers of Body Snatchers.)

The good things: (1) Lili Taylor as Kathleen. (2) The black and white documentary look. (3) The party Kathleen throws to celebrate getting her doctorate in philosophy, where she gets her revenge on the academics who've made her waste years studying the meaning of life and death from books when she could have been learning the bloody truth on the streets. (4) The way we get right to the horror when Kathleen gets out of class, tells a fellow student, ""I'm going this way,"" and puts herself in the path of evil. (5) The possibility that her vampirism-addiction isn't real. Maybe Kathleen is going crazy from overwork. Maybe she has acquired a more mundane drug addiction that she has to romanticize to herself. Maybe her new addiction is to sex and/or cruising. Kathleen seems to let the beautiful woman vampire (called Casanova in the credits) pick her up.

The bad things: (1) Christopher Walken's character. You could skip the scenes with Walken as a first vampire or personification of evil and the movie would make as much, if not more, sense. (2) The relentless citing of philosophers from Protagoras to Descartes to Nietzsche. ""Peco ergo sum."" (3) The overdone Catholic iconography (also in Bad Lieutenant). The priest in the hospital walks past the woman who turned Kathleen into a vampire and doesn't recognize evil when he sees it. A nurse opens the blinds in Kathleen's hospital room and light flows down the wall from a crucifix to touch her and begins to release her from her addiction.

But there is no release from this addiction. As everyone tells us repeatedly, ""The evil is in us. We're not sinners because we sin, we sin because we're sinners."" For all the Roman Catholic imagery in this movie, it's as Calvinist as Paul Schrader's Hardcore. And the evil isn't just metaphysical, it's political, too. Kathleen watches documentary films with piles of Jewish and Vietnamese corpses. And Kathleen tells her friend, ""You pay your taxes that turn Central America into a bloodbath.""

The Addiction doesn't seem to be out on DVD and isn't currently available on VHS, but it's worth tracking down in cult video stores.",1118102400,7,2693,4.8077753779697625
7860174,2,630403220X,"It's been a long time since I last saw ""The Addiction"", and at the time it struck me as an interesting film, exciting, and worth more than one viewing.  The appeal has faded with time.

Filmed in black and white, it opens with two philosophy students sitting in class (Lili Taylor and a blonde chick who remains lifeless on screen even before she's even turned into a vampire) watching a film on the holocaust and some of the atrocities which took place during the Vietnam War.  They have an oh so deep discussion about y'know, morality and the Big Picture.

Lili Taylor is not my favorite actress, so perhaps I'm biased.  The way she flares those nostrils of hers so passionately is enough to make one vomit.  She always overacts, and in a movie like this which is already over the top, one gets a strong sense of unintentional camp.

Her character is shy, introverted, and awkward (of course).  That is, until a mysterious woman shoves her in an alley and says ""Tell me to go away, dumbass"".  (Isn't that just so Generation X?  Ferrara tries too hard with this to be contemporary and hip--sorta like Dad trying to come to your party donning a bandana and a Linkin Park shirt.)  Taylor of course has no clue about the mores of inner city junkie urban vampires, and is bitten.  She becomes dreadfully sick, and before you know it, she's wearing sunglasses, talking about Nietzsche, and behaving erratically.

And she starts smoking cigarettes.

She learns more or less quickly that she is becoming a vampire, and yet Ferrara is going for something ""deeper"" here.  The vampire is just a junkie! Yes folks, as if this hasn't been done about two million times already, he goes for the jugular with a gimmmick.  Ferrara has the potential to be a great director, but almost consistently indulges in superficial societal comments under the pretense of them being innovative when they really aren't.  Vampire as junkie is decidedly not.

But not just vampire as junkie.  Vampire as Lili Taylor behaving like a 16 year old who just discovered that hey, things might not be what they appear! The only thing missing from her development into coffeehouse vamp is a scene her apartment, watching American Beauty and crying afterward. She starts READING all the time as well as accepting the music of Cypress Hill (one of the only redeeming aspects to the movie) as the soundtrack to her life, and hanging out with crackheads on the street. Which is not to say that this is entirely corny; an atmosphere of palpable decay is created which works, a certain deranged excitement, but can't compensate for the excruciating pretentiousness of the whole thing.

Christopher Walken is in this movie for about 15 minutes.  If he's what you're looking for, don't bother.  He gives Taylor the heads up on what it means to be a postmodern, so cool cool, drug using vampire.  Not even he can save this.  The elements of philosophy are thrown in just for the sake of giving the movie a ""heavier"" feel and the Deep Discussions are just empty. The ending makes no sense, but if you want a good, bitter laugh, listen to the dialogue by the chick standing over Lili Taylor's hospital bed.  Wearing a leather jacket.  Smoking cigarettes.

I gave it two stars because it is, after all this, worth watching. Once.  It creates a strong, at times overpowering mood. There are some genuinely scary scenes, but they are few and far between.  But this does not make a film.  Ferrara has a lot of potential and so did this film, and why he does this to himself is lost on me.

Give it a rental.",1108512000,3,3555,4.649038461538462
