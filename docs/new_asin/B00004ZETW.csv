1384008,5,B00004ZETW,"With this movie, the plot is over and done with before the credits are over . . . but thank God for the three wisacres in space. I mean really, this guy in the military learns that his brother was killed while having this . . . um . . . ""picnic"" with a girl, so in order to find out who killed him, he joins this motorcycle gang where they openly do drugs, drink booze in strange ways (at least we HOPE it's booze) and at the highlight of the movie have this weird stunt where they pull the guy at the arms and feet with these two tractors. After hours of boozing and this cool race (that we can't see, but I'm sure it was a good one) between these guys they get back to the plot for the last fifteen minutes of the movie and everybody follows this one girl in a ten minute long scene where we see every minute of a single file line of people following her one block behind the other to this hide-out where the killer is and there's this big fight on this boat . . ..Of course, this plotless twisted tale becomes great fodder for the guys who toss out one good crack after another.",995241600,,1081,4.032558139534884
1384009,5,B00004ZETW,"This is an earlier episode of MST3K (Season Two), but it is very funny primarily because the movie THE HELLCATS is so bad.  The plot is not decipherable, but it involves Ross Hagen (yes, he plays Rommel in THE SIDEHACKERS) trying to avenge his brother's death.  He does this by joining a drunken sex orgy held by this group called the Hellcats.  This is where the plot stops, and MST3K takes over.  I especially liked the song ""Mass Confusion,"" which Crow says ""describes the plot.""  This latest Rhino release is top-notch; however, whoever was in charge of writing the synopsis on the back of the boxcover does not know the difference between Joel and Mike.  Joel is the host in this episode but the summary says it is Mike about two or three times.  Also, on the front cover, the folks at Rhino failed to edit the cast of The Hellcats, instead using the cast from BLOODLUST!  Despite these minor mistakes, the final result is a high-quality tape of a classic television show, Mystery Science Theater 3000.  Definitely recommended.",981244800,21,1032,4.720670391061453
1384020,4,B00004ZETW,"Much like Sidehackers, this is a season 2 episode starring Ross Hagan in a biker movie.  Only there are much more drugs in this one and - believe it or not - much less plot.  Actually, it has less plot than darn near any movie I've ever seen.  Less plot than Incredibly Strange Creatures even.

Hellcats really is one of the worst movies out there.  Heck, it's even worse than Girl in Gold Boots.

I still consider it to be an episode worth owning, like all the other MST3K DVD releases (except The Atomic Brain).  As the old saying goes, even a mediocre episode of MST3K is way better than the best episodes of other shows.  If you're on a limited budget though, and can only choose Hellcats or Sidehackers, go with Sidehackers.

(On a side note, Ross Hagan's name in Sidehackers is Rommel, and I don't even know what his name is in this one.  The movie never bothers to tell the audience I guess.)",1155859200,,899,4.36144578313253
1384021,3,B00004ZETW,"I am THE biggest MST3K fan in the world, but I found this particular episode to be a real disappointment.  It has some laughs but not nearly so many as most MST3K's, and the sound quality of the actual film is really, really poor.  It's very hard to hear what's going on.  (Mike and the 'bots sound fine, but what they're riffing on is pretty incomprehensible.)  Apparently this is the (only?) episode without the usual writing talents; once again, a disappointment.  I'd recommend it mostly for those who already have every other MST3K available.  There are lots of great episodes for sale--get those first!",1096156800,6,608,4.798076923076923
1384022,5,B00004ZETW,"Until I discovered MST3K I'd never even seen a ""B"" movie ""biker"" picture, but the writers and cast of MST3K always seem to be at their best when making fun of these low-budget stories about sociopaths and societal drop-outs. I was overjoyed when I found out that Hellcats would be offered on DVD as this and the other season 2 gem, ""Wild Rebels"" are to me among the very best MST3K episodes ever. The stupidity of the characters and dialogue is funny all on its own, but the cast of MST3K raise the humor level many notches and never let up on the poor direction, acting or plot for a second. They even manage to make the music in this film fun and you'll be humming ""the bike song"" after the closing credits.
One cinematic footnote regards a misidentification I believe of the film's director, Bob Slatzer, who is actually the stockier fellow of the two main ""gangsters"" and not the thinner one pointed out by Joel and the 'Bots during the picture. I discovered this when I saw Bob Slatzer interviewed in a documentary about Marilyn Monroe. But, this minor error does nothing to diminish the quality and quantity of the humor in this episode, which is so dense with jokes that you'll catch something new each time you watch it.

1384023,4,B00004ZETW,"Ah, the 'other' Ross Hagen motorcycle movie.  Reading his bio on IMDb it says at one time he ran an acting school...oh bruther!  Well, while Hellcats was certainly prime for the Mystie treatment, a better one to watch is Sidehackers, another Ross Hagen/motorcycle epic.
Ross is a some sort of law enforcement agent who goes undercover to infiltrate a goofy biker gang after his brother is killed.  For some strange reason, Ross teams up with his murdered brothers' girlfriend to achieve this.  I will admit that after awhile, I just stopped trying to figure out what was going on in the movie, and just focused on the humor provided by Joel and the 'bots.  I did notice a lot of dancing (cough, cough), beer swilling, and general activities you would associate with a psuedo 60's hippie biker gang.  Probably the funniest part in the movie for me was when the leader of the biker gang is challenged to a race by the leader of another biker gang.  We're treated to about five minutes of watching the people watching the race.  I mean, we don't even get to see the race, only hear the reving of engines as the riders supposedly race around.  I'm not sure why they couldn't have included some footage of the actual race, being that this is a movie that's heavy on the whole motorcycle thing, but whatever...it wouldn't have made the movie any better.
While this isn't my favorite episode, it's still really funny and worth getting if you're a fan.  Not a lot of extras on this one except the trailer and the flipside of the disc has the un-mystiefied version of the movie.",1052956800,4,1569,4.591397849462366
1384024,5,B00004ZETW,"I loved this episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 featuring the film, ""Hellcats""! ""Hellcats"" revolves around a biker gang in the sixties as they get drunk, stoned, and beaten up for random reasons. The dance/party sequences are hilarious thanks to the commentary by Joel, Crow, and Tom Servo! I also liked that fact that you could watch the uncut version of the film without the MST3K commentary. It's almost like night and day without Joel and the gang!
I would highly recommend this DVD to any fan of MST3K as well as people would love a good laugh!!!! You won't be disappointed!!!!!",1050624000,3,588,4.7745098039215685
1384025,5,B00004ZETW,"There is no excuse for ""The Hellcats"" to have ever been made.  Not one.  There is also no excuse for the casting, the screenplay, the cinematography, the direction, the sound editing, and I'm sure that there would be no excuses offered.
But there is a reason it was made, and it had to do with drive-in theaters.  ""The Hellcats"", I'm sure, was something of an ATM for the producers and the theater owners, the bottom-half of the double-bill (which would have been referred to at my old fave drive-in as ""OUR 2ND BIG FEATURE"") that would have been out-of-focus, ignored, or forgotten.  But the booking fees alone would pay for the production, and by the time anybody noticed that this flick was chock-a-block with contempt for the prospective audience, the cars were pulling in to the stalls, John and Marsha were sipping soda pop and wondering who was going to make the first move, and all the right people would begin re-lining their wallets.
And that's where MST3K comes in, resurrecting this garbage heap, and shining some light on one of the purest examples of how not to ever make a movie.  Although the host sequences are flashbacks to previous episodes, they are still funny, and show the real creativity of the writers and performers.
The movie (by itself) is unwatchable.  Not only because of its sheer stupidity, and at times, even because of the incompetence in its making.
An example.  A rival gang meets up with our heroes (?) and their leaders challenge each other to a race.  They take off, and for a good three or four minutes of screen time, we see various shots of the bored-looking gangs, and hear what sounds like low-horsepower engines revving and slowing, revving and slowing, revving and slowing.  Then the gang leaders re-appear, race over.  As Crow says, ""What an exciting race."" And when they decide to fight, it's Ross - playing a Vietnam vet - who cools 'em out, saying, ""Peace, brothers!  No more war!""  (To which Joel says, ""Hey, look! It's Ross Hagen, the Prince of Peace!"")
The gang on the satellite finds fodder everywhere, from the remarkably bad camera work (""FOCUS!"" is heard at least four times), the psychedelic parties that look like the least-fun frat mixers ever (although Crow disagrees), to the fact that Ross Hagen is the star (famous from ""Sidehackers"", his refrain of, ""Chili peppers burn my gut,"" can be heard more than once).
My favorite scene?  Towards the end, Ross is caught, beaten up and tied to a table.  Well, more correctly, his knees are tied to a table.  To which Crow says, ""Those guys have a lot to learn about tying people to furniture.""
There is a feeling hanging over the non-MSTied movie that a whole lot of people got tricked into doing this over a long summer weekend, and when they realized what had happened, they still didn't care.  This movie hates the audience, and it says so, over and over.  The SOL says it right back.",1049155200,3,2892,4.695049504950495
1384026,5,B00004ZETW,"Hellcats is a campy classic from 1967 featuring Ross Hagen as an undercover narc who (with his murdered brother's fiancee) infiltrates a '60s hippie-biker gang to find out who killed him. So bad it's good!! The film really has a '60s feel to it, and it's worth it for you '60s afficionados to get your hands on the uninterrupted (i.e. not the Mystery Science Theater 3000) version.
The acting is bad, but the hippie/biker parties are classic. This does have an authenticity to it, as actual hippies are used, ""cubes"" and ""Mary Jane"" is frequently mentioned, ....This film laid the groundwork for Easy Rider and the hundreds of similar films to follow. ""Davy Jones and the Dolphins"" make a brave attempt at a psychedelic soundtrack, though THIS Davy Jones sings out of tune. The rest of the soundtrack is some over the top cartoon drama music (i.e. Batman and Crazy Cat and Minute Mouse themes).
... I give it a 10 as a classic B '60s film.",1044748800,,939,4.62874251497006
1384027,4,B00004ZETW,"First off, this review is of the uncut, non-MST3K version. I have no problem with Joel and the bots; I just generally prefer my cinematic rotgut straight-up, no chaser. The Hellcats inhabits the fringes of that shot-silent-and-looped, stock-music-infested, nearly plotless netherworld of such trash favorites as Beast of Yucca Flats, Hot-Blooded Woman, and Teenage Zombies. In fact, co-producer Anthony Cardoza was one of the producers on Yucca Flats, and he and Hellcats director Robert F. Slatzer later made the atrocious Bigfoot (1970). Plus, writer/assistant director Tony Houston was associated with a number of Larry Buchanan films (Mars Needs Women, Eye Creatures, Zontar the Thing from Venus, etc.) in various capacities. All of which explains a lot. The movie opens in a graveyard at the gang leaders funeral, with each Hellcat laying a knife or chain on the casket. Ranking biker chick Sheila (Sharyn Kinzie), pulls her bra from under her shirt as her offering! Next were treated to some mis-dubbed dialogue between some cops before repulsive director Slatzer shows up as sleazy drug lord Mr. Adrian. (Pay special attention to the incongruous sound effects in the shot-silent scenes: e.g., a baggie dropped into a paper bag goes thump; a man walking through a grassy field makes an odd sucking sound.) The plot: military sergeant Monte Chapman (Ross Hagen; The Sidehackers, Mini-Skirt Mob, Devils 8), the brother of a narco cop murdered by the Hellcats on Adrians order, meets with some senators at an airport, then dons leather jacket, shades, and dorky Then Came Bronson-style knit cap to go undercover, infiltrate the gang, and bust the biker/dope ring, accompanied by wispy blonde Linda (Dee Duffy; Murderers Row, The Ambushers), fiance of the dead narc. Since theres only enough story to sustain a 25-minute episode of Dragnet, most of the time is taken up by the Hellcats (all in chintzy dime-store biker attire) riding their hogs to the accompaniment of some twangy Davie Allan and the Arrows-style bongo-rock (The Arrows are listed on the soundtrack LP but not in the movie credits); drinking lots of beer, then squirting and pouring it on each other; lying around, stumbling, and falling down; lots of aimless partying; some of the stupidest dancing ever committed to film; and tripping out (Biker: You ran into a bad cube, man. Hiney: I don't feel so good. Mommy! I don't feel so good! Everythings green!). Tony Lorea as Six-Pack is a definite lowlight with his cheesy garb, lame comedy bits (including awful Jimmy Cagney impersonation), and particularly mortifying dancing. Hagen is sullen and monosyllabic, trading cringeworthy dialogue with Duffy such as, He: Mama, remember the lessons. She: Go for the throat! Kinzie and Slatzer deliver some of the flattest line readings this side of a Warhol movie and Cardoza appears briefly as a painter who is attacked (and his semi-nude model assaulted) by the bikers. Theres a hilarious confrontation between Hellcat leader Snake and beatnik-look rival gang leader Zombie, whose big motorcycle chicken run takes place entirely offscreen (all we see are the blank stares of the spectators!) and ends with a lame chain fight; Hagen is challenged to a drag (when we say drag, we mean scrape) where the contestants are stretched between two cycles rack-style and/or dragged along the ground; Mexican drug dealers (signified by Flamenco guitar music) play cards while a jonesing junkie chick pleads for a fix; and the films sole arty moment occurs when a womans scream segues into the whine of a jet turbine, a la Hitchcock! The soundtrack is as bizarre as the onscreen action, varying from lame psychedelia and generic frat-rock to snippets of bossa nova, harpsichord, elevator music, and even what sounds like a zither! Several horrible vocal numbers (including the mind-numbing theme) that sound like bad Kasenetz-Katz tunes are credited to Davy Jones and the Dolphins and arranged/produced by Richard Podlor (could this dreck possibly be the work of Richard Podolor of Chocolate Watchband, Hondells, etc., fame? No producer is credited on the soundtrack LP.) When the brassy stock music cues from Adults Only skinflick Strange Rampage pop up halfway through, anyone familiar with Johnny Legends Sleazemania trailer comp will be rolling off the furniture. Curiously for a biker flick, theres actually not a lot of motorcycling until the last 10 minutes, when the gang races to rescue Monte and Linda. The Hellcats in its un-Mystied form is a smorgasbord of ineptness for aficionados of poverty-stricken grade-Z schlock; I noticed even more delicious badness on second viewing. Would make a great double-bill with H. G. Lewiss She Devils on Wheels, with which it shares a similar non-style and crude charm. Serious biker dudes beware!
Fortunately for Mysties and bad film cultists, the source print on Rhinos DVD is much better than one would expect for a movie of this type. The transfer is full frame, which is cool since it wasn't shot widescreen anyway. The brightness, contrast, sharpness, and detail are fine; and physical damage is limited to only some light speckling and blemishing. Color balance is OK, if unspectacular; saturation is slightly above average for quick-fading Eastmancolor. The Dolby 2.0 mono sound is a bit muddy at times (some of the dialogue is difficult to understand), probably due to the original mix, and there is also some soft background hiss. The Hellcats trailer, letterboxed to 1.66:1, is only included on the MST3K side of the disc, but looks about as good as the feature, with reasonably good color, and only some very light speckling evident. For fans of low-budget biker sleaze, a cant-miss package for the cash. Easy, mama.",1043193600,4,5727,5.1525241675617615
1384028,3,B00004ZETW,"Hellcats begins promisingly enough, with a catchy little theme song (""Heeeellll-cats!  Heeeellll-cats!"")  that you will not be able to dislodge from your brain for days.  It's perky and happy in exactly the way that the movie is not.  Then the movie descends into extended periods of boredom punctuated by stupid biker tricks.  As another reviewer noted, everything in this movie is padding.
This is one of those movies that would be intolerable were it not for the MST3K treatment.  You get to see unattractive people spray beer on each other, make out, ride motorcycles, and engage in dubious feats of strength, although I fear this description makes the movie sound much more entertaining than it actually is.
As for the ""plot"", Ross Hagen shows up in the US on leave from Vietnam, hangs out with bikers and his dead brother's fiance in some kind of attempt to do something undercover, something happens with the biker gang, and then he goes back to Vietnam.  The end.  Was it some kind of social commentary, equating the bikers with the Viet Cong?  And if so, were they both supposed to be bad guys, or just misunderstood good guys?  Was it a failed attempt at a girl-gang film a la the far more entertaining (and non-MST3K) ""Switchblade Sisters""?  With the truly awful script, direction, lighting and sound, who can tell?
While I wouldn't pass up this DVD altogether, I would acquire the MST3K version of ""Sidehackers"" first.  It's a far more entertaining and bizarre motorcycle movie, with Michael Pataki taking it totally over the top, and Ross Hagen as the hero yet again, in case you can't get enough Ross Hagen.  I really hope these two films don't represent the peak of that guy's career.",1027468800,5,1699,4.797250859106529
1384029,4,B00004ZETW,"I'm not sure where and how the most dangerous radioactive material in the world is secured, but The Hellcats should be stored in the same place, as far removed from mankind as possible.  The evidence indicates that the movie is supposed to be a video of people endlessly riding bikes out in the middle of nowhere, but at the last minute someone decided to insert a few moments of a largely incomprehensible plot into the final product.  Even writer Mike Nelson later admitted that this is a movie that should never have been subjected to the MST3K treatment, but fortunately Joel and the Bots manage to extract some real humor out of this monstrosity of moviemaking.  Here's the story (or what might be the story if it actually existed): The Hellcats is a group of skanky young hippie types who spend their lives getting stoned, getting drunk, overdosing, riding motorcycles, and engaging in free-spirited, unhygienic parties--oh, they also run drugs from Mexico for a big boss man (who is played by the man who perfected the art of reading his lines just as if he were indeed reading them).  Two cops are out to bust Mr. Big, and one of them gets knocked off when he starts to get too close.  The dead cop's fiance and brother team up and go undercover in an effort to nail the bad guys.  Much drinking, carousing, biker hijinks, bad dancing to utterly horrible music, and unintelligible mumbling follow.
Somehow, Joel and the Bots make what would be an otherwise horrifying situation bearable with liberal doses of comedy.  This is fortunate indeed because the skits on the Satellite of Love consist largely of flashbacks to previous skits (the reason for this is that the whole staff went to New York for a meeting with representatives of the Comedy Channel at the time this episode was being filmed).  If you are looking for commercially released MST3K shows, I would place this one close to the bottom of your list unless you are determined to purchase the videos in order of original air date.  The most important thing is that you do not, under any circumstances, watch the original The Hellcats movie by itself, for only Joel and the Bots can see you through this one safely.
I must say a word about the summary available on the back of the video.  I have no idea how this happens and is not caught, but the summary says that Mike Nelson rather than Joel Hodgson is our human commentator.  This is the ninth experiment of Season Two, and Mike Nelson was a full three years away from replacing Joel on the show.",1027209600,2,2518,4.6359550561797755
1384040,2,B00004ZETW,"Forgive me for saying so, all you MSTies out there like myself, but isn't this movie just a little TOO bad? I mean, even if Joel and the Bots were in their best-ever form (which they absolutely aren't in this episode), would it really be worth it to sit through this cinematic atrocity? Well, maybe if they were as funny as in Pod People, one of their best, but still when a movie is just too bad, it seems like the writers have too much to work with and just work on the obvious (e.g. bad music, long senseless scenes, corny dialouge, no plot whatsoever). But as in Pod People, where its bad, but its production values are just good enough to have the MST3K writers sweat a bit, the episode seems to be much better than usual.
I would provide some of the best lines from this episode, but there really aren't any. By the by, stay away from CATALINA CAPER also, for similar reasons.",1027036800,4,882,4.319277108433735

 But still I enjoyed it, it now sits along with all the other MST3k rhino stuff. But for the love of GOD rhino... PUT SOME EXTRA FEATURES ON THE MOVIES! There really is no reason to buy any MST3k DVD except the Manos one which has the blooper reel POOPIE on it.",1026950400,,487,4.236559139784946

1384043,2,B00004ZETW,"Don't treat the DVD release of this so-so MST3K episode like a major event. There hasn't been a new MST3K episode released to  video or DVD in many many months. Stacked against recent DVD reissues like ""Red Zone Cuba"" (very funny) to ""The Crawling Hand"" (depressingly unfunny), this episode hits the straight middle. A fairly early episode, the warm vibe is there even if the jokes are weak. The skits are nothing special, but again, a fun vibe throughout. I actually didn't mind this movie in any case. (I have a soft spot for beer-chugging biker gangs and their corny initiation rites...) There aren't enough jokes to patch up the slow spots between biker fights, but it's fun enough.
Whatever. Who cares? My problem is this DVD was already available on video. There are no extras, zip. They used to at least include the ""uncut"" version of the film - not anymore.
If Bad Brains released the episodes that are really good: (""Magic Sword,"" ""Santa Claus Conquers the Martians"", ""The Girl in Lovers Lane"", ""Attack of the Eye Creatures"") we'd really be in business. But right now, I'm lowering my hopes for a new MST3K of any kind. What next, ""The Gunfighter"" on DVD? ""Catalina Caper""? Yay. (Or is it yawn?...)

1384044,4,B00004ZETW,"HELLCATS contains a lot of the typical bad movie-making decisions that have entertained and pained MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 fans for years.  Most of the so-called action is centered on a group of angry bikers.  They get into fights, become engaged in terrible musical numbers and don't really do much of anything else besides party.  While some MST3k movies are simply entertaining in their awfulness, HELLCATS is not a film whose faults could really enjoyed without the commentary, because the biggest flaw of this movie is its sheer boredom.
This movie is one of the most grotesquely padded films that I've ever seen.  MST3k often mocked short instructional films that were no longer than 30 minutes, and if HELLCATS had been reduced to that length, it would still have been too long.  Everything seems to take to hours to occur and absolutely nothing is worth the wait.  Episodes like this can sometimes spell real trouble for the viewer, because if the jokes from Joel and the bots aren't up to the usual standard then there is no obvious entertaining badness to distract us.  Thankfully, HELLCATS managed to coax some hilarious one-liners out of the gang, and we're spared the thought of having to survive the film without the needed lifeline of wisecracks and puns.
The DVD is packaged with the original trailer, which interestingly would give one the impression that this film is all about the various women who hang out with bikers and their naughty and taboo adventures.  Shockingly, the movie is absolutely nothing like the trailer.  The DVD also comes with the uncut, unedited original version of HELLCATS, which just goes to show that the people at Best Brains, Inc. are not only funny folks, but also tireless philanthropists, dedicated to wiping insomnia off the face of the Earth.",1024358400,3,1799,4.95016611295681
1384045,3,B00004ZETW,"I'll tell you first that I can guarantee that I am as big an MST3K fan as anyone (I DO have every episode from KTMA to season 10 on tape).  With that said, I just can't get into any of the episodes before season 3.  I can't point out why exactly, other than that I think the jokes just aren't as funny.  I don't know if it is because the best jokes ended up coming from Paul Chaplin and Mary Jo Pehl (who didn't join the team until season 3) or if they just hadn't hit a groove yet, or what.  But it just seems to me that none of the early episodes have the edge and laugh-out-loug humor of the later episodes.  As far as I'm concerned, MST hit its peak with season 4 and continued strong though season 7 (and even season 8).  The episodes from seasons 1 and 2 I just cannot watch anymore.
Anyway, off my soapbox, and onto this episode.  The movie is basically about a guy who works with the cops to bring down a gang that caused his brothers death, and ...uhhh...then other stuff happens... and they have strange orgies of licking and groping.....and then it ends.  Yeah, pretty bad, really.  Not a lot of plot here, to tell you the truth.  And the orgies were pretty lame, too, as far as orgies go.  And the Joel and Bots commentary just wasn't up to snuff with later episodes.  There were some funny moments, but nothing that made me shoot my drink out through my nose or anything.  However, this episode had some classic host segments from episode's past(all cut to in nifty flashback form) and that saved it from the 2 rating that I would have given it.

Like 'Sidehackers,' 'Hellcats' is an unpleasant film about drugs, murder, biker gangs, and the basically good kids who get caught up in all that stuff.
The riffing on this film is pretty good, and captures the playfulness and exuberance that especially characterized the early seasons. The host segments are a little lame, in that they're largely flashbacks to other episodes (this episode came about three-fourths of the way through the second season, so there's not even that much to flash back *to* yet). On the other hand, none of the episodes in which these segments originally appeared have been released on video (yet?), so from that standpoint I suppose it's nice to see them here. But they're not as topical as they often are in other episodes.
Still, I love MST's early years even more than I love the later years, and encourage all fans to stock up on Season Two episodes whenever possible.",1006992000,5,1136,4.921875
1384048,5,B00004ZETW,"This is without a doubt one of the worst movies ever forced upon the inhabitants of the SOL. It concerns a guy getting revenge on the gangsters who killed his brother. He does this by joining a outlaw motorcycle gang, where drugs and alcohol are the staples of life. Joel and the 'bots rip this movie to shreds, among the oddities of this film are: an exciting off-camera motorcycle race, endless scenes of people riding motorcyles and an odd fight scene near the end. It is a perfect antidote for a bad day.",1000339200,3,508,4.473118279569892
1384049,5,B00004ZETW,"I first saw this when I was about fourteen or fifteen. I had a wretched cold at the time and woke up that Sunday feeling like total crap. The only thing I had going for me was the anticipation of watching the previous evenings Mystery Science Theater 3000, which I had taped. Things finally went my way when I pushed play, for this is without a doubt one of their greatest efforts! Though I haven't seen it in years I do remember that the plot of the alleged ""film"" was virtually non-existent and that Joel and the 'bots wisecracks were razor sharp. Buy or rent this tape at once, especially if you have cold because after watching this I swear my cold symptoms all but vanished.",999648000,,679,4.396825396825397

7928523,5,B00004ZETW,"THE HELLCATS is amazing. The sound is atrocious, and most of the dialogue, due to both bad recording and untrained acting, is incoherent; much of the film is out of focus; the plot, such as it is, is incomprehensible; the movie's idea of biker life is something like SONS OF ANARCHY for the Disney Channel; the songs are third-rate British Invasion rock 'n' roll that seem to share the same key, tempo, and lyrics; and the star is the mumbling, stonefaced Ross Hagen, whose acting runs the emotional gamut from A to A. In other words, it's a perfect MST3K episode.

The movie is one extended non sequitur, and even the host segments, composed mostly of clips from earlier episodes, come off as maddeningly arbitrary. THE SIDEHACKERS is a model of logic and clarity compared to THE HELLCATS, but does that make it a better movie for riffing opportunities? You decide.",1434240000,5,866,4.735099337748345
7928524,4,B00004ZETW,"Such a bizarre little movie...

Joel and the bots throw down against this biker tale about a soldier who joins a biker gang to get revenge or something like that.  Maybe nothing like that actually, because I could hardly follow this poorly edited mess.  From the opening credits (complete with odd theme song) to people licking beer off each other to the main character trying to be pulled apart between motorcycles in a field all the way to a cheesy climactic battle on a trash barge, this movie had me confused all the way through.  The saving grace was the MST treatment, which adds genuine comedy to a movie whose genere I could not place.  Watch if you can.",1391644800,,662,4.529411764705882

7928528,5,B00004ZETW,"Oh Lord, where to start, with this epic?? Joel and the Bots, send this back to Hell, where it came!! This could have been used to show just how NOT to direct a film, without the always stimulating commentary. Slatzer the director, probably didn't know from day to day, whether the funding would run out, to finish this stinker. The acting was wonderfully inept, the sound poor, and the director could have been referred to, as "" One-Shot Slatzer!!""
