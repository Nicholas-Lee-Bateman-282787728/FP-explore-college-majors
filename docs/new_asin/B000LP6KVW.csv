I usually don't care for reenactments.  However, because I love Ancient Egyptian fans and mascara and artwork, all the reenactments here didn't bother me as they do in most documentaries.  Plus, you could tell that the actors loved imitating these ancestors.  Still, at times the script is threadbare, so the reenactments eat up a lot of time.  They show harem dancers performing for about two minutes and it really does nothing but provide eye candy for modern viewers.

Too often, documentaries overly focus on gods and royalty and forget the common people.  This work mentions peasants and farmers before it moves on to the pharaoh.  The documentary had white and Arab scholars interviewed, however, there were no women interviewed.  The work does try to speak about Ramesses' favorite wife Nefertari, to provide some type of gender inclusion.

I am so used to hearing that empires conquer all with whom they come into contact.  Think of Caesar's ""We came, we saw, we conquered.""  Here, however, the work says Egypt came to a treaty with the Hittites.  Egyptian records list Ramesses as victorious, but Syrian records disagree with that.  I appreciate that this work doesn't suggest all rulers don't face losses and that some ancient history may be skewed propaganda.",1197676800,,1464,5.092436974789916
