8006394,4,B00014K61S,"""Killer Weekend"" is one of those movies where it's not a big production but nonetheless watchable. It has a ""Late Movie at 11"" vibe and I got a couple of laughs out of it (in a good sense).  However, for those who want to order this movie, there are two movies with the same title and Eric Roberts is in both of them (and the other movie has a different cast and plot I believe), so pay attention, it can be confusing.",1424304000,,418,4.097560975609756
8006395,2,B00014K61S,This movie wasn't that great. You really didn't care who lived or who died. The only good thing about this movie was Eric Roberts. To bad he got killed off so early.,1305417600,,165,4.1875

That's right,Killer weekend stars Thee ERIC ROBERTS !
Actually this is a pretty good slasher film with ""Aged like fine wine"" ERIC being very bad to his family and guests over a weekend end.
Filmed in MALIBU,At a gorgeous mansion and with a cast I've seen before.
This film could do good business for Midnight Releasing aka Maxim Media.
Eric has a screen look and demeanor not found in most straight-to-dvds,He just seems to be having mean-spirited fun at others expense.
The deaths are actual unique for the most part and seem very painfull in execution(pun intended).
Besides Eric,John Daly from HEMDALE fame is a cowriter,Damn this movie gots some talented genes !",1277164800,3,672,4.9035087719298245
8006397,5,B00014K61S,Cyriell Clair is the reason I bought the DVD.  She is the most beautiful woman on the planet.,1220400000,3,93,4.166666666666667
8006398,3,B00014K61S,"KILLER WEEKEND has so many plot holes and is generally poorly acted, but it's Agatha Christie style plot was engrossing enough that I find myself liking it anyway.  Not a great whodunit, but has enough plot twists to keep you interested.

A group of rich, snooty and ultimately boring couples are spending the weekend at a beautiful resort in Santa Barbara, when one of them is brutally murdered.

A detective who is ready to retire is assigned the case and his Columbo-style interrogation and dry humor are fun to watch.  We get several suspects and of course the necessary red herrings.

Al Sapienza gets the acting honors playing studly Michael Greene, who becomes the main suspect when his wife is victim no. 2.  His restrained performance erupts when he is accused and his Brooklyn accent comes out of nowhere, but he infuses the role with a lot of energy.  Eric Roberts, the only name star in the movie, is of course the first murder victim, and he adds his usual heartless, cold persona to this role.  Screenwriter Jennifer Farrell wrote herself a meaty role as hostess Janet, whose blond beauty and warm smile are not to be taken too seriously, it seems.  There's some incest, some steamy sex scenes, but the violence is restrained and not too gory.

Overall, mystery buffs may appreciate this low budget film; at least it's not another slasher wannabe.",1103155200,5,1361,4.777777777777778
