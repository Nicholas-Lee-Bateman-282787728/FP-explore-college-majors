3772867,4,B001R3YRHG,"All of the series... Buns of steel, legs, arms and abs. Provide great workouts. It's an older series, but still effective.
Good for the beginner.. because most of the exercises are very low-impact.",1278979200,2,197,5.0
3772878,5,B001R3YRHG,I use this program in combination with the ABS and ARMS of Steel.  It is a great overall workout program.,1389312000,,105,4.25
3772879,3,B001R3YRHG,"I grew up with a legs and buns of steel that my mother had from the late '80s. I was kind of hoping this was like that, but instead of the good old fashioned leg and bun crunches, there are a bunch of new techniques that seem more fancy than effective.",1378944000,2,252,3.9607843137254903
3772880,5,B001R3YRHG,"because its a very good exercise dvd
its really works I had its before I missed place it when I moved out of state",1377216000,,114,3.7916666666666665
3772881,4,B001R3YRHG,"I definitely like this video.  I felt like it could have been a little more challenging, but overall, I like the movements and exercises.",1355184000,,137,4.708333333333333
3772882,5,B001R3YRHG,This is a great workout.  I love using this workout video. The results are well worth the work and are fabulous.,1355184000,,112,4.333333333333333
3772883,3,B001R3YRHG,"I have several work out DVDs and I'm not very impressed with the exercises on this one.  Some get so complicated, you can barely follow them.  Others are just plain silly.  I think they are trying to get too creative on their workouts--keep it simple!  I really like the 5 and 10 minute formats of the work outs and a couple of them on pretty good.  But, had I been able to watch it before buying it, I would not have purchased it.",1347926400,7,431,4.144578313253012
3772884,1,B001R3YRHG,"If you want bad knees or back problems, this is the video for you!  She overextends the knees on lunges and squats, doesn't teach how IMPORTANT it is not to have the knee go past the foot which she and the girls do in this video.  She also hyperextends the back in most of her exercises...NOT GOOD.  The fact that the workouts are so easy and short pretty much guarantees NO RESULTS if you really wanted results.

This has got to be the worst video I've ever seen.",1346284800,8,464,4.238636363636363
3772885,5,B001R3YRHG,"Leisa Hart's: Buns of Steel, Abs of Steel, and Legs of Steel are fantastic. Not only are you working on the areas you are targeting, you are also having fun and getting your cardio in! These DVD's are great for beginners and advance. Recommend all of Leisa Hart's products!!!!",1335052800,,276,4.653061224489796
3772886,1,B001R3YRHG,"I hate to be so negative, but I really disliked this DVD.  I own about 150 workout DVD's, 25 of them are for lower body toning only.  They all blow this one away!  It is definitely for beginners and nothing like the classic ""...Of Steel"" workouts.  I really don't like how Leisa Hart's workout style has changed.  I love her, but she has gotten so easy.  I started working out with the VHS tapes of the Steel workouts.  Some featured her, some featured Tamilee Webb, etc.  Those I think are way more effective and challeging than this DVD.  You can find some of those on here and I think your money is better spent on those.

The DVD is set up into 4, 10 minute sections.  The first was cardio and it couldn't get my heart rate up.  I wear a heart rate monitor so I know exactly if I'm being challenged.  I never reached my target heart rate zone.
The next 2 sections were toning, but neither felt at all challenging.  Not enough sets.  Way too Easy!  Nothing new.
The DVD finished with a 10 minute yoga section which I actually thought was ok, but just feel overall that this DVD was a total waist and a total dissapointment.  Sorry.",1300665600,17,1134,4.298578199052133
3772887,4,B001R3YRHG,"This workout is entertaining and easy to do. You don't feel worn out when you're done and you can tell your muscles worked. The only thing that is a little bit annoying is the voice of the host, but you get used to it eventually.",1283126400,,229,4.111111111111111

8337273,1,B001R3YRHG,Too fast paced for beginners and no way to slow it down to learn the moves.  I was very disappointed since I had one of her older videos.,1395878400,,137,3.892857142857143
8337274,5,B001R3YRHG,"It's fun and effective. It took a few times doing it to learn the routine. But now since I know the routine, I love it. The entire video is about 45 minutes. It seems the time goes by fast because you are concentrating on the steps and the video is broken up in 10 minutes session.",1395360000,,281,4.035714285714286
