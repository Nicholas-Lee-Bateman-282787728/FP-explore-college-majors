4251926,5,B0042P2O1C,"I rarely watched TV and only recently discovered I had Lifetime with my new cable provider along with being able to tape shows. When I discovered by chance that a movie was on earlier, LAST CHANCE CAF and that I'd missed it, I was mortified. I simply couldn't wait another month until it was to be on again. I just had to order it online, knowing it would be a movie I'd watch over and over, again.

I'm a HUGE Linda Lael Miller fan, and have read many of her books, fifteen or more. One of them being LAST CHANCE CAF, which I loved. Oh, what a great day it was to discover one of her books has been made into a movie. I would love to see all of them become a movie...well, almost all of them.

Just as I loved the book, the movie was good as well. Loved the storyline. The acting was good though I wouldn't say great. There were some really great scenes, so true to Linda's writing.",1292716800,3,883,4.098265895953757

8413875,4,B0042P2O1C,"This is a great family move.  The thing that I didn't like was the way the woman actor was in this. Clearly she doesn't have any control over her child.  Number one Kevin Sorbo is a hunk, she was just sort of blah.  However, still a cool movie. Anything Kevin Sorbo is in, I like.  This is a sort of mushy movie though.  NO sex which was good. Just kissing and hugging.",1422230400,,369,4.069444444444445

8413881,5,B0042P2O1C,I got my copy of this movie from the Lifetime channel website.  Look in the search under Kevin Sorbo to find it. I liked the movie and I am a Kevin Sorbo fan.

8413883,2,B0042P2O1C,"I love Linda Lael Miller's book Last Chance Cafe, so when I saw a couple of good reviews for the TV-movie (which I only just learned existed a couple of weeks ago) I paid $35 plus tax to get my very own DVD.  I hate to say it, but the prior reviewers must have seen a different version.  This movie is a poor translation of the book.  I understand that movies are never as ""deep"" as the books they are based on, but this storyline was thin to the point that anyone seeing the movie without having read the book has no idea what the whole conspiracy plot was about.  And leaving out the part with Chance's relative who owns the log cabin (was it his aunt?, can't recall at the moment), that was a shame to leave out of the movie because that was a huge part of the story.  The acting by the actresses playing the mother and daughter characters was really bad - I'd say ""anemic.""  I'll happily sell the DVD cheap, because charging $35 would make me feel like I'm robbing someone, but I'm keeping the book and will re-read it.  This was a pricey risk I took, paying $35 for a TV movie I hadn't already seen, but live and learn!  READ THE BOOK!",1297123200,,1140,4.17351598173516
