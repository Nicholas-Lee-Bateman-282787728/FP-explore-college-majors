8436537,5,B004NAZ7QK,"Unbelievably beautiful film set in 1800's Arctic region. Great plot, great actors, great costumes, and superb cinematography. The characters draw you into a mesmerizing story of the life of a Norwegian orphan raised by ""Finnmark's"" indigenous people which are called Lapps in the film.  Her inner struggle to please her adopted parents and yet find the happiness for which she so longs has you cheering at the movie's end.
Incredible scenery and filming conditions which could not be reproduced today.
One of the best silent films ever!!!",1510963200,2,538,5.183908045977011

8436539,5,B004NAZ7QK,"This is an excellent silent movie made some 80 yrs ago. It's hard to believe it's so old as it was done so well. The filming, actors and story line are very engaging and easy to follow. It is in blk/wht and has English overlapping Norwegian subtitles. It has a bonus option that contains film stills and bios of the producers and main actors, all very interesting tidbits. Of note the birth and death dates of those involved are listed in the credits -you can be sure that wouldn't happen today!

I've never really warmed up to the silent movie genre but this one is on a completely different level. It's not the typical overly dramatic, slapstick and theatrical type of movies I had seen before. It's very natural looking in both the settings in the frozen tundra and fjords and the actors themselves. As another reviewer mentioned this group of actors all had very expressive faces making the story easy to follow. They were brilliant and many went on to have successful careers in silent movies in Scandinavia. I especially liked the eye expressions conveyed by the two Sami men.

What impressed me most was the simplicity and innocence of that time. Movie making was in its infancy and I'm surprised that Norway didn't emerge as a major player in the industry as did Hollywood based on the quality of this film. I'd imagine many a film student has studied this film for it's creative and lifelike aspects and ease of story telling. The plot itself has some sad moments and also some heartwarming elements. The sweet fatherly affection the two Sami men had for the little girl was uplifting. For some reason and perhaps because times were so hard back then, I'd made the wrong assumption thinking that people were not that nice to each other, that child rearing was more an obligation than a joy as they were too busy working, trapping or farming.

It's a wonderful movie that will surprise you in how watchable it is though it's long at almost three hours. It was fascinating to see historical Norway and the Lapland areas complete with reindeer, snow, sleds, nomadic huts, costumes and the familiar Sami four wind hats you see on skiers today (the joker/court jester hats). Life for the Sami's was a nomadic one following the migration of the reindeer herds. They would meet up at trading posts several times a year which also served as a social function as they largely lived a solitary life moving around. The movie is further enhanced with music from Edvard Grieg.

Kudos to Norske Film Institute and Santa Monica Studios for bringing this wonderful movie back to life, they did a fantastic job!",1432339200,5,2603,4.701754385964913
8436540,5,B004NAZ7QK,"Like other reviewers, I saw Laila, accidentally, while staying up late one night. TMC broadcasted it around midnight - and I was riveted and amazed until it ended around 3 am.

This movie is over EIGHT decades old - and it is a statement to its greatness that its intricate story, acting, cinematography, costumes, and incredible scenery have withstood the test of time.  As an American, it was jarring and enthralling to see a part of the world and two cultures most of us have never thought about.

The images are in stunningly-crisp black and white.  The acting is natural and believable - so unlike Hollywood's silent films with their overly-made up, cartoonish characters, and exaggerated acting.  With Laila, I felt like I was watching the story unfold while I secretly watched behind a fir tree - albeit freezing - but utterly engrossed.  One has to wonder how much this film influenced later directors, screen writers, and cinematographers.

This film should be in AFI's top 10, it is that phenomenal.",1335571200,4,1009,4.9
8436541,5,B004NAZ7QK,"Like previous viewers, I stayed up very late watching this movie and recorded the movie, but someone in my family removed it! So, it  took me a while to find it, since I could not remember the title. I researched the internet vehemently to find this on Amazon to purchase. Thank You,Amazon, for selling this wonderful movie! I strongly recommend this movie if you like movies with adventure, pure romance, sadness, and wonderful ending! I wish it could have gone on and on...I wish they would make a remake of this!",1326067200,,515,4.65934065934066
8436542,5,B004NAZ7QK,"A wonderful classic that has all the elements of epic: Romance, action and classic actors.
Highly reccommended for any silent collecion.",1311465600,2,136,5.523809523809524
8436543,5,B004NAZ7QK,"I see that the two previous reviewers watched Laila on TCM, as I did.  I am on Pacific time, so I was in bed a little after midnight, our time!  I am a fan of the old silent ethno-movies, beginning with Edward Curtis's ""In the land of the war canoes"" (1914) and Robert Flahrety's ""Nanook of the North"" and ""Taboo,"" and so on.  Laila ranks right with the very  best of them, with stunning scenes of the great reindeer herds, wolf packs, and the nomadic camps of the Laplanders -- all shot on location in northern Norway.  It is a rich and complex story of a Norwegian girl rescued from the snow and raised by Laplanders, betrothed to marry her foster brother -- whom she does not care for in any romantic sense.  The dilemma involves interracial marriage, resolved in an interesting twist at the end.

The cinematography, by the director George Schneevoigt (1893-1949), is as good as it  gets.  It is hard to believe that you are watching a 1929 silent film.  But what blew me totally away was the performance of Mona Martenson (1902-1949).  I had never seen nor heard of her before, and I watch the TCM Silent Classics almost every Sunday night.  She is the best I have ever seen.  I Googled her name and found that she was a well known Swedish actress, a classmate with Greta Garbo in film school in Stockholm.  She was with Garbo in Gosta Berlings Saga (1924), after which Garbo went on to world fame.  I would say that Mona Martenson's performance in Laila is better than anything I ever saw Garbo do (and I am a Garbo fan).  Do not miss this one.

8436544,5,B004NAZ7QK,I did the same as the first reviewer and stayed up till 2:00am CST to finish watching. The director of this movie was as good or better than most today. The camera work was excellent and I wonder what it would have looked like originally before it needed to be restored. I'm going to put this on my want list and hope to get it sometime this year.,1301875200,5,347,4.117647058823529
8436545,5,B004NAZ7QK,"I watched this movie on Turner Classic Channel early this morning.  It started at 12:30am and didn't end till 3am.  At about 2am I was going to pack it in and tape the rest of it, but it was so interesting I stuck with it till the end.  What a fantastic story and acting.  It was hard to believe I was watching a movie made in 1929.  I'm not going to stretch this review out . . . I loved it and it may have been one of the longest movies I've ever stayed awake for!  I highly recommend it.",1301875200,16,490,3.85
