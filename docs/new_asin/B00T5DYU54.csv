8700410,5,B00T5DYU54,"Love this video!  I'm an intermediate-level practitioner. Upper body & core strength-building poses have long intimidated me in classes & gotten short shrift from me at home. Another area of weakness has been that, while my lower body is reliably strong in many standing poses, I've lacked strength & stability in asanas that require raising a leg out from the body to much degree & then keeping it lifted -- e.g., one-legged downward dog, standing split (ha! as if), some one-legged balance poses, etc. I have no idea of my flexibility in such poses nor have I ever been able to develop greater range of motion in them, since holding my lifted-leg weight always overwhelmed whatever degree of extension I've got.

This DVD is helping me with all of these areas of challenge & is an excellent value for the price. I like Vytas' cueing & direct, friendly style that meets students wherever they are in their practice abilities. I've been doing this DVD 3x/wk for 3 weeks now, and it's so motivating to feel real & rapid improvement in my upper body & core strength after years of plateau.

This video kicks my butt in a good but not overwhelming way. I won't lie -- I have to kind of force myself to do it & not wait until some mythical, sparkly time when I feel ""motivated."" A few minutes into it, however, I'm rewarded by feeling the motivation starting to grow. The first few times I tried to keep up, I felt typically discouraged & over-challenged in my weak areas. I could tell pretty quickly, however, that this video targets exactly what I need. My vinyasa practice & form are showing improvement as a result.",1469059200,,1615,4.620209059233449

8700412,4,B00T5DYU54,"Vytas Strength DVD is in my weekly yoga rotation now.  I like to cycle through a variety of yoga dvds to prevent boredom and get a more balanced practice.  Of all of my DVDs, Vytas is probably my favorite instructor based on his explanation of the poses, encouragement and lack of excessive chatter.  He has a pleasant voice and a gentle yet firm demeanor that I find motivating.  I am working up to being ready for his complete set based on my success with this DVD.  I'm 61 and have been doing yoga for about a year and a half, and can do most of this dvd except the opening core work which is still quite challenging for me.  There is a less intense core conditioning segment on the extras though and that has been very helpful.",1453593600,3,731,4.299270072992701
