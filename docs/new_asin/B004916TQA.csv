Very very entertaining...And i can't wait until Season 3!!! At the end of the Season 2..it shows you in special features a sneek peak of season 3....OH MY GOSHH!! i cannot wait.

4287033,1,B004916TQA,"My friends went on and on about how wonderful this show was, so i bought the first season.  I was appaled.  This show is a horible repersentation of the American young adult.  I hope people from other countries do not watch this.  All this show does is glorify promiscuity, acholism, and fighting.  The first episode ""Snooki"" admitted to sleeping with 3 people in one week, getting in two fights and getting so drunk she couldn't remeber what happend the night before.
Snooki is only 23, my daughter is 23 and she has served in the army for six years one Iraq deployment, earned a degree in nursing, mothered a beatiful girl, and working on furthering her degree.  Snooki has no formal education and is nicknamed ""Snooki"" for being the first of her friends to loose her virginity, she has no formal education, and no plan on pursuing a career in the future. Yet she is the one asked to ring the bell at wall street and host other events.
If this is the face that young girls are seeing and aspiring to be I want no part in it.
Please save the soul of a young girl and don't support these young adults.",1294790400,8,1101,4.399014778325123
4287034,4,B004916TQA,"I waited for the perfect time to start watching jersey shore and that was when this double package came out. Pretty much got these two seasons for the price of one season.

So one thing i noticed about the Uncensored Material of this DVD is for the majority, all of the AUDIO is uncensored. When they talk you still here them clearly cussing. This helps because you do not hear the ""beep"" on any cuss word at any time on the show [for what I've noticed]. The bad thing is, the PICTURE is not. For some reason, the DVD producers were just too lazy to fully write the cuss word on the subtitles and too lazy to uncover the blurred out nipples and thongs. Basically, everything that was blurred out on the MTV channel screen, is still blurred out here. So if your expecting a complete uncut season, this is not it. Doesn't take away from the show though, i am hooked.",1294185600,6,864,4.333333333333333
4287035,5,B004916TQA,I bought this for my sister's birthday... She loves the show. It was the perfect gift at a GREAT price!,1381536000,,103,4.2
4287036,5,B004916TQA,"I bought this as a gift for my daughter in law, who loves it, i have no idea what it is about though.",1378771200,,101,3.4347826086956523
4287037,3,B004916TQA,I am a fan of the jersey shore but I was extremely disappointed when the DVD box came damaged -.-,1361404800,,97,3.9
4287038,5,B004916TQA,"I had season 3 and i wanted season 2 to see how it built up to that boiling point (Uncensored) and it coming with the first dvd made it even better, good price for both seasons.",1358121600,,177,3.9444444444444446
4287039,5,B004916TQA,My daughter really enjoys the Jersey Shore and these DVDs are very enjoyable to her when its not on television,1357257600,,110,4.55
4287040,5,B004916TQA,"I fended off watching, let alone liking this show for 3 years.  I was bored one day and decided to see what the hubbub was all about.  If you really enjoy watching hungover people just primping and talking smack while they prepare to go out drinking, then getting into fights and attempting to sleep it off and do it all over again....relatively uncensored....then this DVD set is for you!
Somehow I'm intrigued by the whole thing, and I don't recommend it for everybody, LEAST of all the demographic that MTV is aiming for, (of which I am NOT a part).  So yeah....get these discs.",1355961600,,581,4.5673076923076925
4287041,4,B004916TQA,I bought this mostly bc I liked the drama. This show is good if u want entertainment not if u want a show with a brain. But it's still a good buy,1345161600,,145,3.5625
4287042,4,B004916TQA,"jersey shore season one
very entertaining! the way they describe their ""culture"" is just way funny!!
my fav person is snooki she is just too cute and funny!
and i love when they were explaining wat GTL is!
only downside i guess is angelina....... im normally not a person who hates a certain person on reality tv but this girl is just too irritating!!

jersey shore season two
i like this season better than the first one!!
i like it better when they party at jersey but everyone was more of a family and there was a lot more dynamic!
the letter, MVP and snooki and jwwow was just amazing i cant wait to watch season three!!

packaging
i don't if it was amazon or sth else but one of season one didn't play so i had to buy season one again separately.......
one if the discs already was not in the right place and scratched and i understand that disc not playing but the other two didn't play either..... so if u r thinking of ordering it you should be careful!",1338595200,,961,4.274725274725275
