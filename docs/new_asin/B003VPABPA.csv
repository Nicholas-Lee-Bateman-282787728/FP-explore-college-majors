It has CREEPTALES, plus 3 other horror films, plus it's cheaper.

Its version of CREEPTALES is fullscreen, and visually like an old TV or VHS print. The other three movies are also of low visual quality.

Regarding CREEPTALES itself -- I love horror anthology films, but CREEPTALES is pretty bad. It was shot in the 1980s (but only released during the past decade), and was obviously trying to cash in on the success of George Romero's and Stephen King's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Creepshow/dp/B002GHHHG0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Creepshow</a>&nbsp;horror anthology film.

But don't be fooled. CREEPTALES is no&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Creepshow/dp/B002GHHHG0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Creepshow</a>. It's a collection of short horror films (or in some cases, scenes from unfinished horror films), with a wraparound -- the only original part of CREEPTALES.

The short films are mostly boring and unoriginal. In one of them, some men hunt for a werewolf, which kills some of them, and then is killed. Big deal. There's only one really good story, SUCKER, which evokes TV's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tales-From-the-Darkside/dp/B003VJTGNE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tales From the Darkside</a>&nbsp;in its humor and tone. Another tale, about a Halloween party in an abandoned town, is also fairly good.

CREEPTALE's wraparound is abysmal. Horror anthologies benefit enormously if given a suspenseful, well-acted wraparound (e.g.,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Asylum/dp/B000FC2GFK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Asylum</a>, or Peter Cushing's excellent performance as a conspiracy theorist in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Uncanny/dp/B006K5H9QW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Uncanny</a>). But CREEPTALES's wraparound is just a bunch of ""monsters"" in rubber masks grunting as they watch TV, playing the CREEPTALES's videotape.

What's worse, the opening wraparound is some 8 minutes long. Eight minutes of ""hilarity"" while two hunchbacked ghouls search for a copy of CREEPTALES, which they bring home to their monster friends. No real dialogue, just campy grunting, groaning, and mugging for the camera. That goes on and on, until you feel compelled to fastforward to the first short film.

A HARDCORE horror anthology/short film fan may find some value in CREEPTALES, but unless this DVD-R is a pristine widescreen version, you're better off buying the cheaper version on the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Afraid-of-the-Dark/dp/B0001WTVP2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Afraid of the Dark</a>&nbsp;DVD set.",1363132800,,3012,7.564102564102564
8406975,1,B003VPABPA,"Sorry just being honest. This is just bad... really bad and overall the worst anthology film I have seen.  Too bad cause I love anthology horror but this really just the pits. This is coming from someone who likes the worst films from the 80's.  There are 6 stories and none of them are made well at all. And none of them are actually interesting.
Warped - This was actually meh, not horrible just a terribly made and bland story. Nothing too bad but I hoped it would get better. It didn't.. it got worse.
... let me see if I can remember the names of these stories
Snatched or something... horrid and stupid... I was expecting more from this story as it is pretty much the same thing as one of Dean Koontz's short horror stories from Strange Highways. An insult.
The Closet - This was like 2 minutes and worthless.... there is a monster in the closet and it pulls someone in...... like could the film even try?
Then we have like the garage ghouls or something like that..... I have no idea.. by this point the film was losing my attention cause it was so bad. This was just boring.. not funny... not scary and I am still trying to find a point of it. Actually you may want to skip this story all together. It will cut back on how long you have to sit through this.
Then we have some bland werewolf story......... so bland.... so short... and oh so bland.
Finally Sucked... omg seriously??????? If you took the worst episode from Tales From The Crypt and made it 300 times worse then that and added 500 dashes of dumb you would get this story.
Look I know Creeptales was trying to be campy but it's not funny or fun.. which campy should be.
AVOID!!",1295222400,2,1648,4.312903225806451
8406976,5,B003VPABPA,"Since I had never heard of this, I decided to take a chance and buy it.  I'm a fan of Horror anthology flicks, so I figured why not.  It sort of surprised me that this is actually an older flick.  I was thinking it was new - not that it matters but I used to rent and collect a lot of old Horrors on VHS (until DVD came along), and I've never ran across this one.  Turned out that 'CreepTales' is worth having!  It contains 6 stories (plus the intro as a surrounding story), in the span of 102 minutes.  Not a bad flick to pop in for those with short attention spans.  This flick, in my opinion, is kid friendly and by that I mean there's no nudity, gore, or harsh language.  Yet, it doesn't need to use any of that.  Nice to take a break and watch some good, clean, fun Horror with your family on Halloween!  Oh, the intro to this is set on Halloween night!

The first is titled, 'Warped', and in my opinion it is probably the weakest.  About a girl, Elizabeth, who goes to the countryside to visit her Aunt Viola.  Elizabeth has fount out Viola's sick, family secrete.  That's about all I can say without giving it away.  The last few minutes of 'Warped' is cool and memorable!

The second is titled, 'SNATCHER', and I think this one might be my favorite!  This story stars Tom Kenny, voice of SpongeBob SquarePants, who plays a character that goes around snatching purses all day and every day until he steals from the wrong lady.  You see, this old lady has a very, unique purse!  Without giving away too much of another simple, short story, this purse may look like a purse but it isn't.  This totally threw me off (haha).  Find out for yourself!  Cheesy fun!

The third story is titled, 'The Closet', and yes, it's about a monster in the closet.  With a title like that, what else could the story be about (haha).  My only complaint is that this is the shortest story of them all.  I enjoy these monster-in-the-closet stories and I had much rather preferred this feel not so cut off.  I enjoyed the look of the closet monster and the way it had that 'The Willies'/'Goosebumps'/'Are You Afraid of the Dark' style to it!  Anyways, you'll have to find out what happens to that kids big brother.  Great stuff!

The fourth story is titled, 'Groovy Ghoulie Garage', and this one probably made me laugh the most (in a good way).  This I felt is the most campy and has such a stronger 80's feel to it.  It reminded me of that one flick, 'Graveyard Disturbance'.  Sort of that style of campiness (haha).  Anyway, these two guys take a road trip on Halloween night and decide they want to visit the town of, dang, I forget the name of the town!?  Anyways, that's not important.  They visit the town and find that the townsfolk take Halloween a little too seriously.  I won't give it away, but it's cool why these folks are the way they are!  This story is probably the most kid-friendly of them all with having a ending that isn't so ""doom and gloom"".

The fifth story is titled, 'Howling Nightmare', and has, for a low-budget flick, a cool but goofy-looking werewolf.  At least this werewolf looks way better that one off of 'The Werewolf Of Washington' (haha).  Anyway, I think this is a cool, original story.  I didn't clearly understand its title until the end, and was like, ""hey this has a neat, little twist to it!"".  Keep in mind, these are simple, little Horror stories.  You won't find anything groundbreaking, ok.  Again, can't really say too much about this story without spoiling it.  Just know that there's hunters and a werewolf and that the ending is hilarious.

The sixth and last story is titled, 'SUCKER', and between this story and 'SNATCHER', is what's making it hard for me to decide which one is my favorite out of the bunch!  'SUCKER' is about a odd-looking door-to-door salesman who shows up to Dora Duffy's house at midnight offering, what he calls, a ""Sucker""!  Basically what looks to be somewhat of a modified 'Dirt Devil' vacuum cleaner.  The Sucker magically gets rid of all filth without needing to charge or be emptied out!  Strange, huh!?  Back to the story, you see, Dora lives in a dirty, sloppy house and blames her husband for it.  Salesman gives her special instructions on how to use it!  Will she take heed?  What will become of the house, husband, and herself!?  Seriously, you have to watch this!!!  The turnout of this story is another cheesy, good one!  Love it!

As for the intro itself, its cool because you have these two guys who seem to be some sort of ghoulish fiends trying desperately to find a copy of 'CreepTales'.  They scurry through the woods on Halloween night towards the video store, but only to find that it has just closed.  They then remember that their Uncle Munger was buried with a copy of it (because its his favorite flick).  The two get the bright idea to dig him up and snatch it (haha).  Well, they take 'CreepTales' back to their house and watch it with other mutant-looking friends and that's when the show begins.  Note: When watching 'CreepTales', have with you, soda, popcorn, and pizza because after each story, it would cut back to the ghoulish fiends enjoying their treats while watching this flick (haha).",1284508800,6,5182,4.498388829215897
