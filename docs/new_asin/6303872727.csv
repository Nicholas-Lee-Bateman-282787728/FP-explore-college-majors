724170,2,6303872727,"Legend of Lemnear has amazing graphical quality despite its age. Too bad that this 45 minute ""movie"" has bad dubbing, not much of a plot, and shallow characters. But, it's done by Satoshi Urushihara, so you can except some really detailed visuals and a good deal of nudity. The theme song is also good, as is the background music, although it tends to drop in and out of tune every ten seconds or so. I don't know if it's just my copy. The last fight against Veroll and his four (!) forms was actually pretty cool, and had a sweet background song to it, audio problems aside. But as it stands, it's too short. There's not much of a plot to it, but the animation was definitely its main point. A decent rent.",992908800,13,707,4.323308270676692
724171,1,6303872727,"This has got to be THE WORST anime I have EVER seen!  And I have seen probably almost 1,000 or more hours of anime. The main character spends the  whole movie either naked, or in an extremely revealing bikini  ""armor"" that wouldn't protect her from a damn flying toothpick!  My best friend and I rented this video expecting a shojou anime with an  inspiring plot---what we got was multiple scenes of topless women being  touched in exptremely inapropriate ways by the ""Bad guy"" . And  aside from that there wasn't even a plot! The pathetic attempt at a plot  that they had was confusing, hard to follow, incomplete, and utterly  stupid. PLEASE DO NOT MUY THIS MOVIE!  If I can convince you of ANYTHING  let it be that it's an extremely BAD BAD BAD idea to buy this movie. If you  want suggestions on Good Animes, E-mail me ( Quistis@onebox.com ), I'll  give you a nice long list, just please don't buy this one!",967161600,14,911,4.4817073170731705
724172,1,6303872727,"The Legend of Lemnear through sheer stupidity attained a legendarily bad ranking in my book. This movie takes the attitude ""plot? Who needs it! "" I'm not sure of the release date of the movie Heavy Metal, but I  have a distinct and sickening feeling that this entire movie was just an  adaptation of the *well done* last sequence of that film. The fact that it  took itself seriously was one of the worst things about this film. I mean,  come on, funny haired chick wears little or no armor seeking revenge on Big  Bad Guy? And the idea for the prophesy was pitiful. Read correctly, the  main character's only purpose was to stick around so that the  ""champion of bronze"" guy could whoop up on the bad guy. Blech.",944438400,5,713,4.438461538461539
724173,3,6303872727,"This anime is actually quite nice and enjoyable to watch. The character designs are great, done by Satoshi Urushihara a famous artist in japan, and the action and visual scope is great. However, the movie suffers from a  pretty short running time which makes it feel a little rushed. If the back  story had been given full treatment, not just in flashbacks, and if more  sub-plots had been included then it could have been great. If you're a  fantasy, or action anime fan this is probably good choice. However, if  character interaction and a deep plot or more your thing Lemnear is  probably not what your looking for.",940723200,,619,4.685185185185185
724174,1,6303872727,"Too much rape/abuse, virtually no character development, and a ridiculously simple ending.  If you must watch it, listen to the cool music at the beginning, then fast forward to when she's running up the staircase,  ignoring the numerous disquieting rape/abuse scenes.  The fighting at the  end is amusing.  Then, take note of the mindbogglingly silly ending.  Then,  throw it away.
If you really liked the part in Return of the Jedi when  Jabba was abusing the slaves, you'll get a kick out of this anime; it takes  up about 1/4 of the actual playing time.  Otherwise, don't bother.",929145600,5,583,4.857142857142857

7854685,5,6303872727,"Legend Of Lemnear is a fantasy/sword and sorcery film from 1989. The movie is 45 minutes long, and it is directed by Kinji Yoshimoto.

The film is about a female warrior named Lemnear who must combine her powers with a male warrior named Messhu in order to stop an evil sorcerer from destroying the world.

I really love this movie. It is a great fantasy film. It is beautifully drawn, and the art style and character designs remind me a lot of video games like
''Final Fantasy V Advance''. I love the art style, the music, the sound effects, the voice acting, and the story. It also has a wonderful happy ending. The film can be watched in English, or in Japanese with English subtitles.

If you love Japanese anime, RPGs, or the fantasy genre, you'll love this movie. It's a great fantasy film with lots of action and magic.",1370908800,,826,4.493333333333333
7854686,5,6303872727,I finally found this and it's now part of my collection.  I watched this years ago and I just had to get this on dvd.,1357257600,,117,3.68
7854687,3,6303872727,"If you're a fan of Frank Frazetta, or sexy fantasy/adventure, then this is totally up your alley. Legend Of Lemnear was a 3-volume manga by Plastic Little creators Kinji Yoshimoto and Satoshi Urushihara, and was later adapted into this 45-minutes OVA.

Set in a Conan-styled world, Lemnear is a bikini-clad warrior woman on a pterodactyl searching the landscape for the evil wizard Gardein that killed her family. This leads her to a city in the middle of the desert ruled by a lard-ass sultan who has the most bitchin' topless harem ever, but is also in the pocket of Gardein, and his master, the Dark Lord Varhol. Lemnear gets caught, and enslaved by the evil sultan, but encounters an old Gandalf dude who tells her she is the ""Champion of Silver"", and presents her with a magical necklace. After being temporarily hypnotized by the sultan, she breaks free and heads out after Gardein. She flies up on her big bird, and follows him to a giant floating fortress which is Varhol's lair. He absorbs Gardein into himself revealing that he was really a part of him all along, and that he is was the Champion of Gold. His plan was to absorb Lemnear and her captured friend Messhu(who is the Champion of Bronze)to become all powerful. Varhol then morphs into a two-headed dragon for a fight that Dirk the Daring would've survived. But Lemnear escapes with Messhu on her pterodactyl, and Varhol morphs again into a stone giant the size of a skyscraper. It takes the combine powers of Silver and Bronze to finally smite him down.

Urushihara did some amazingly vibrant artwork for this, and there is truly vivid animation by AIC, whose work is seen in numerous anime movies and OVAs to this day. Most people think there's alot of similarities between this and the Taarna character from the Heavy Metal movie, mainly that she's a hot white-haired Red Sonja girl with flying dinosaur in a desolate wasteland, although this one is more fantasy-based, and is way heavier into fan service. It doesn't have much in the ways of substance, but is pretty good at least for fans of old Japanese NES fantasy games.",1350864000,2,2097,4.726775956284153
7854688,5,6303872727,"Wow was this good, there was more fan service in 45 minutes of Legend of Lemnear than there was in the whole of Agent Aika. The character designs are amazing, the animation is awesosme and you see half the time seeing nude women, including the main protagonist.

My favorite scene is where you see a king surrounded by nothing but naked womens slaves who he has under his evil trance and he fondles one of the slave girls freely without consequence. It was an epic moment that bordered on hentai but it was etched in my mind ever since.

Considering you pick this up for a few dollars, this hardcore anime with extreme nudity is as good as it gets in terms of pirce.

7854689,5,6303872727,"I was trying to get a few older anime DVDs and this one fit the bill. As one other reviewer said, it reminded me a lot of the Heavy Metal ending section. Very Nice!",1309564800,,164,3.8529411764705883
7854690,4,6303872727,"This anime is a great big fantasy adventure. Actually it's pretty short, but it is still good, especially forthe price you can get it at these days. The animation is sorta old school, there is some fan service, but above all it has a solid original storyline and includes a few kick ass scenes. The one downfall is the flaming eighties ending. Well, you can't win them all. Simply put, a must for anime collectors.",1082419200,8,414,4.533333333333333
7854691,1,6303872727,"The vulgar ""Legend of Lemnear"" is one of those anime that gives the Japanese animation is poor reputation of having just sex and violence. But indeed, that's just what ""Lemnear"" has in its very short runtime (almost an hour). The plot vaguely consists of a chosen one set out to free her people, or some such nonsense. The film has no sense of character nor direction and mostly consists of animation that is subpar for the genre and useless plot devices that might be good in another movie. What the film does develop is sex and nudity. True, much anime has these two, but plenty still keeps a strong story going... There's better stuff out there.",1040169600,3,648,4.594827586206897
