6619180,5,B00NAFSRLQ,"For anyone interested in orchards and nature, support Stefan by buying a copy of this video, and sharing it with friends and discussing it.  Very important work.",1417910400,3,161,4.962962962962963
6619181,5,B00NAFSRLQ,I loved this DVD. Great starter information for those in the cooler climates. Good reference material provided for further research.,1467158400,2,132,5.65
6619182,5,B00NAFSRLQ,One of the best permaculture videos I've seen.,1464912000,,46,4.875
6619183,4,B00NAFSRLQ,Loved it. Watched it twice but it still left me with unanswered questions. Not specific enough with all the info I needed. But these guys did a great job in getting this dvd made.,1464566400,2,179,4.294117647058823
6619184,4,B00NAFSRLQ,"Great visuals, interesting summary of philosophy.  Many useful points to consider.",1461542400,,82,6.454545454545454
6619185,5,B00NAFSRLQ,Excellent documentary. Love how he touches every aspect of a perfect orchard. Very enlightening.,1449878400,,96,5.928571428571429
6619186,5,B00NAFSRLQ,Nicely explained and easy to follow.  I'll be starting my Orchard plan this year with developing the soil first and moving on to the tree planting within ~3-5yr time frame.  I'm sure I'll practically wear out the DVD by the time my tree's start producing.,1449014400,2,255,4.644444444444445
6619187,5,B00NAFSRLQ,If you were my relative and I liked you I would suggest that you read this book before you plant another tree! It will save you alot of Grief.,1447804800,3,142,3.9310344827586206

6619190,4,B00NAFSRLQ,"Very good production quality and nearly 2 hours of excellent information. Love the ""NAP"" concept, using whey fungicide, companion plantings, bird, pollinator, and beneficial insect attraction. Didn't like that he has no solutions for curculio and we aren't shown the real scale of his operation or what it looks like in all seasons (only fall and winter), he also didn't seem to explain his root stock choices unless I missed it, and honestly from what little was shown his yields looked kind of poor. There are many different takes on organic/permaculture orchards, keep in mind that this is just one of many. If you are interested in another perspective search for the free online book ""Miracle Apples"" (intro by yoko onto). I prefer larger 111 rootstocks resulting in deep roots and less disease, plus less need for understory management, but the below horizon training shown in this video would result in much lower yields like you see in this video. I'm also not sure a nitrogen fixing tree is the best idea, would like to see more data on that, that could also lower yields. Don't get me wrong, I love seeing different approaches and love when people take the time and effort to share their experience and knowledge gained in the field.",1440892800,13,1242,4.835680751173709
6619191,5,B00NAFSRLQ,"At first I wasn't too impressed with the film since a lot of it is just him saying how he does things, and much of it doesn't apply to my situation (I don't want plastic landscaping mulch all over my farm, and have no need to water trees in my climate), but some of the things he said stuck in my head and I keep remembering them and want to use them, so I've changed my mind and really value the DVD.  It's definitely worth the $20 to anyone interested in permaculture and/or growing their own fruit.  The section on grafting is really good.  I wish they'd taken more time to film the orchard during different seasons, tho.",1437004800,13,624,4.271186440677966
6619192,5,B00NAFSRLQ,"Fantastic show, even my 7 year old enjoyed it and talks about NAPing trees.",1435536000,2,75,4.428571428571429
6619193,5,B00NAFSRLQ,"I watch this over and over and over. You should too. It has so much info and I write it down, watch it again and see more info. I love it. Not boring at all. Excited about all that I learned and growing my own orchard.",1435017600,2,218,3.760869565217391
6619194,5,B00NAFSRLQ,"Inspirational, honest and informative",1433894400,,37,8.5
6619195,5,B00NAFSRLQ,So pleased with this film. My wife and I splurged and bought this and were very glad to have done so. Check out his follow up mini-video on his website. Looking forward to another film.,1431388800,,185,4.314285714285714
6619196,5,B00NAFSRLQ,"It's a great introduction into permaculture, and there are a number of useful tips for setting up and managing an orchard. I loved it, and I'm hoping to set up something similar in the next few years. Highly recommended.",1431043200,,220,4.666666666666667
6619197,5,B00NAFSRLQ,A great resource for anyone interested in designing their own sustainable orchard or simply growing a fruit tree in their yard.  The film breaks down complex design ideas into digestible portions for all viewers.  Well thought out and presented and beautifully shot you'll want to come back to the film again as your understanding and experience with the subject deepens.  I have purchased one for myself in Florida and one for my son in New Zealand.  The details may differ by region but the practices laid out in the film apply across all growing zones.,1431043200,3,555,4.810526315789474
6619198,5,B00NAFSRLQ,"Really fabulous video!  You will have to watch it a couple times and take notes to get all of the information in it.  I bought this for my dad since he is going to be creating an orchard and garden space on his property, and we both thought it was quite helpful.  If you want a great overview with good details of how to have a permaculture orchard from a small scale to large scale, this is an invaluable tool.",1427414400,5,411,4.1125
6619199,5,B00NAFSRLQ,"This video is _by far_ the best demonstration of applying of permaculture principles, because Stefan Sobkowiak uses them in practical ways for growing and harvesting fruit organically.  Added bonus, it is enjoyable to watch and listen to him as he demonstrates techniques and describes his experiences.  I'm an experienced gardener, but I'm interested in learning to grow produce and be more self-sufficient.  In this video, I learned some new things: planting by harvest dates, training vs. pruning, and using whey for fungus control.  I highly recommend this video.",1423612800,5,567,5.409090909090909
6619200,5,B00NAFSRLQ,"Amazing, revolutionary approach to developing an orchard.  Loaded with practical information and the production quality is very high.",1419206400,5,133,6.388888888888889

8676760,5,B00NAFSRLQ,"I love this! Beautifully shot and chock full of info. I especially like the text balloons that popup on the screen to show the inter-related plants and their names - such and such pear, chocolate mint, lemon balm. Need to have a pen and paper handy to write notes on the guilds shown right on screen - right while you watch.",1511136000,2,324,4.327868852459017
