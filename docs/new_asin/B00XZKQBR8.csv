8717202,1,B00XZKQBR8,"What deception, this DVD should not be sold as the audio is terrible, the narrator mumbles, the music is very poor and I love classical music but this was very bad. Worst of all why would the makers of this DVD have the beautiful Peterhof palace garden on the front and it is not featured on the DVD, very deceptive , no gardens are on this DVD just a few flowers . I have been to St. Petersburg and thought I would have a DVD as a reminder of my trip. None of the  buildings are filmed from the interior , this  DVD will be returned, very poorly made in every way.
