7076195,3,B00V2HX3O0,"I love the book and have listened to the audio version twice (44 hrs). The first movie was good. Started the second, only to see all new actors. Different actors again in the third and just couldn't finish it.",1438646400,,209,4.384615384615385
7076196,3,B00V2HX3O0,"Easier on the eye than the rather tedious book, but the changing cast in each movie just didn't do it for me.  To break it down; movie #1 was 4 Stars, #2 was 3 Stars, #3 was 2 Stars; hence the composite rating of '3.""  A worthy addition to my movie collection, but not one I'll watch again.",1430438400,4,290,3.9827586206896552
7076197,4,B00V2HX3O0,"Nice film that gets you thinking. Not the typical Hollywood action, comedy or romance.

I had high hopes for this film since I like economics and philosophy. I would have preferred one really good 90 minute film instead of a trilogy. Each of the films has different actors, so when you get to know the people, you have to relearn then again in the second film, and then again in the third film.

I really liked the actors in the first film. Dagny and Hank played great parts as business people that get things done, instead the usual Hollywood portrayal of business people spending their time sipping wine and socializing. The rest of the first film cast was great also. The first film was hard to follow. I had to watch it a second time, and write notes of where each railroad went, who owned what company ect. It would have been nice to introduce and elaborate new people, rail lines and companies more slowly, so I wouldn't need to take notes to understand everything. I thought the sets and special effects were quite good for a budget film. The story is good and believable.

The second film was fun, and moved along at a good pace.

The third film seemed like a sappy soap opera at times, but was still fun and adventurous. Commendable for the limited budget they had.

I'm glad I watched the films, because I wanted to see the story, but didn't want to read a 1,000+ page book.",1468800000,4,1384,4.454545454545454

7076199,4,B00V2HX3O0,"IMO this will help spread the word about Ayn Rand's idea about valuing your work/your creations better than her book ever did.  The movies covered the book theme well.  It is an eye opener about current conditions considering it was written almost 60 years ago.  Sadly, it is too accurate a depiction of our present nanny state status.
I wish there had been more continuity in cast.  A tighter written script would also have been appreciated.  I preferred the Part I Dagny Taggart and Henry Rearden actors.  They seemed to fit my concept of a business doer.  So for the minor shortcomings, I still gave the series four stars on the strength of the material in hopes we can awaken before John Galt starts luring the truly driven people away.",1462665600,,740,4.6461538461538465
7076200,5,B00V2HX3O0,Movies were well done. A must see for everyone,1454544000,,46,4.222222222222222
7076201,5,B00V2HX3O0,I watched the first and second movie on Netflix and I wanted to see the third one so I bought this set to see it. This is a great trilogy at a great price,1441929600,,154,3.5588235294117645
7076202,5,B00V2HX3O0,Really brought the message of the three books I had just read.  Unfortunately the actors changed in each episode which was a bit annoying as the characters grew on you.  Made me think that maybe Donald Trump was John Galt!  Truly enjoyed the movies after the great books I read!,1441584000,,278,4.52
7076203,3,B00V2HX3O0,"The first film was best in production then dropped on last two films. A very interesting  message in the films. It is rumoured a mini series being done, l hope there is more detail and story added in series. Anyway dvd set is worth while watching.",1440633600,,247,4.369565217391305
7076204,3,B00V2HX3O0,"The story and philosophy of Ayn Rand Deserves higher marks, but the acting was a bit too ""soap opera"" like for me.
It did however convey Rand's overall philosophy sufficiently.",1440374400,,176,4.9
7076205,5,B00V2HX3O0,"I havew read the book several times and this is a entertaining way to get some more out of the book.  It will never match up to the book for the serious follower of Ayn Rand, but it does have it's moments.  Just as the movie Fountainhead could not live up to the book- there is too much to put in a movie.",1439942400,3,305,3.8253968253968256

8708944,1,B00V2HX3O0,The reason why they had to change actors and crews for each chapter was because they butchered the original text with their artistic license.  Unbelievable stories- like a soap opera you could see on any broadcast channel each week.,1505433600,,232,4.948717948717949

8708950,5,B00V2HX3O0,"A remarkable insight into the destructive force of corporate control of our government and the insidious evil of creeping socialism. All three episodes tell a then hypothetical story written in the 1950's, a story that has become truth in the America of 2016. Episode #2 is an especially poignant presentation of Ayn Rand's view of Statism and Corporatism. It argues well for the values of ""objectivism"" and individual liberty as the pillars of a healthy and successful society.",1473552000,4,478,5.141025641025641
