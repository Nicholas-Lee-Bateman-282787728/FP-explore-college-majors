8124414,5,B000FKS19W,"As a fan of both Ingmar Bergman and Liv Ullmann, I was anxious to see this film. When I finally did, I wasn't disappointed. The story, the acting, the cinematography, all were excellent. I'm hoping that someday this will see a DVD release in a widescreen format. This VHS says it's in letterbox but the VHS I have has it in full frame. I don't know why that is but I still enjoyed the film.",1379808000,,390,4.213333333333333
8124415,4,B000FKS19W,"There's a theory, perhaps Freudian, which claims that, for women, religious ecstasy parallels sexual ecstasy. For men the theory, perhaps Freudian, is that men's ideal woman is both mother and whore. Be these theories as they may, Ingmar Bergman's lifelong fascination has certainly had religion as a major focus. In PRIVATE CONFESSIONS the character Anna is first sexually drawn to the priest who officiates at her first communion, even though he is much older, and her uncle. In the event she marries a priest, Henrik, and bears his children. A family friend, Tomas, declares his love for Anna, and she succumbs and enters the affair with an unbridled, unleashed passion. Their relationship is peppered with expressions of fear and it soon becomes clear that Tomas is alarmed by Anna's powerful emotions, and the relationship founders. Tomas is just not ""up to it"". Such is the bare bones of this marvellous film. The themes I found interesting include the compulsion among many of us for control over others;the ordered versus the disordered life (there is a marvellous scene in which the husband at home notices a plant is dying, a chair is misaligned and has a squeaky rib and there are four minor stains on the tablecloth, all of which he takes as visible manifestations of his wife's neglect of her family in favour of her philandering whereas it is merely his perceptions that create this belief) family versus one's own desires which may be outside the family; the need for compromise; faith; ritual and loneliness. Pernilla August, as Anna, is frankly rivetting and it is impossible to take one's eyes off her. Indeed, the camera can remain for what seems minutes on her silent face and we read, as a book, the thoughts and feelings that are conveyed by her subtle but evident expressions. Every emotion, including rage, is a wonder to witness. There may be nothing more interesting in Art than the human face, and the cinema, in particular the cinema of the likes of Mr Bergman, has made the most of that fascination. In the film before us Ms Liv Ullman has done a brilliant directing job of bringing Mr Bergman's writing to the screen.",994550400,3,2147,4.852861035422343
8124416,4,B000FKS19W,"Written by Ingmar Bergman and aptly directed by Liv Ullman, ""Private Confessions"" continues the chronicle of Bergman's parents which began with the 1992 film ""The Best Intentions.""  Now, twelve years into the marriage  of Anna and Henrik (Pernilla August and Samuel Froler), the story unfolds  through a series of five ""conversations"" which are actually pivotal  intervals in Anna's life.  The first is with her Uncle Jacob (Max von  Sydow), a clergyman, and we learn of the anguish she has suffered due to  her own unfaithfulness to the autocratic and demanding Henrik.  Though she  does not regret the affair, she realizes the precariousness of her position  and the threat it poses to the well-being of her family, especially the  children.  Jacob tells her she must end the affair at once, and advises her  to tell her husband everything.  She knows how much this would hurt Henrik,  and must decide whether or not to do as her Uncle insists.  In the second  conversation we learn the outcome of her decision.
 The third  segment takes place two months prior to her confession.  Anna arranges a  rendezvous with Tomas (Thomas Hanzon), a young theology student, at the  home of a friend.  When it is finished, Tomas leaves her, appalled by his  own inadequacies at allowing their affair to proceed at all.  Anna truly  loves him though, and knows that she will always be with him, at least in  her own heart.  The next conversation is ten years later.  Jacob is dying  and has asked for Anna to come to him.  They have not actually spoken with  one another since he advised her in the matter of her affair with Tomas.  All this time he has wondered, burdened by the possible outcome of his  advice, and doesn't want to go to his grave without knowing.  He is  relieved to learn she has not seen Tomas in ten years, and they take  communion and pray together.  Then, in the final segment, Anna is eighteen  years old, a confirmation student of Jacobs, and we learn of her doubts  concerning her faith.  Jacob, her spiritual advisor, tells her she must  decide for herself whether or not to take communion, and in the end we are  left pondering Bergman's familiar themes of faith, suffering and the  foibles of human nature he addresses so adroitly; the pain of discovering  one's own loneliness; and the guilt we all seem destined to bear.  Liv  Ullman has done an outstanding job of rendering Bergman's material to the  screen, and should be commended for eliciting exemplary performances from  von Sydow, Hanzon and especially August, and for allowing them the time  necessary with which to convey as much with an expression or a gesture as  with words alone.  These moments enable the actors to breathe life and  meaning into their characters while giving credence to the morality to  which those characters must adhere.  ""Private Confessions,"" like all of  Bergman's work, will make you pause and reflect on your own life and  imperfections, while bringing you face to face with the reality of being  mortal.",953856000,6,3014,4.80943025540275
