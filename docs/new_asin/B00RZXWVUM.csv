6937627,5,B00RZXWVUM,"Very good story line, great acting, and the picture was perfectly clear for a movie was made in the seventies, or early eighties, also it contains some nudity & sexuality, but it does not effect the main story. It just a part of it.",1431907200,3,232,4.295454545454546
8696523,1,B00RZXWVUM,"Three women are topless. One is side view topless once towards the end. Other two are topless multiple times during movie. One gives a almost full frontal, but mostly is a side view.",1503705600,,182,4.545454545454546
8696524,1,B00RZXWVUM,This movie was a waste of a DVD.  Poor performances by the actors and the music was left over from an ice cream truck.,1465862400,3,118,3.9166666666666665

8696526,2,B00RZXWVUM,"If not for the few examples of full-frontal, this would be totally unwatchable. I couldn't figure out what was supposed to be going on most of the time, and the ""sizzling climax"" mentioned in the jacket description is a perfect example of over-hyping and under-delivering. The transfer is bad (though I've seen worse), the women are just OK and the plot seems both to start in the middle AND end in the middle. Clocks in at around 65 minutes and I still couldn't get through it without falling asleep.",1454025600,4,501,4.640449438202247

8696529,1,B00RZXWVUM,"If you're as old as I am you might recall a series of videos that came out in the eighties called PRIVATE SCREENINGS. These were European soft core porn films under that banner, movies that displayed more nudity than plot while cutting out any and all shots of penetration or male nudity. At the same time they displayed female bodies often. The plots were thin at best and did nothing more than present a reason for everyone to disrobe and have sex.

SUMMER HEAT appears to be one of those movies with only the PRIVATE SCREENINGS tag missing. The movie features a farmer and his second wife who seem more interested in fooling around than anything else. At the same time his son by his first wife is a voyeur who loves to watch his step mother whenever shes disrobed. A maid is hired and the son watches her as well. She eventually sleeps with his dad, his stepmom finds out and soon the son sleeps with the stepmom. End of story.

Yes, really, that is the plot line in one small paragraph. A few things are inserted among the rest like the sons love of photography that gives him a chance to shoots pics of the maid and the local landscape. But those aren't the focus of the film and all it boils down to is skin.

The only people I can recommend this movie to are those desperate to see nudity. That would be extremely desperate. No redeeming value whatsoever for this film.",1433894400,24,1377,4.392156862745098

8696532,3,B00RZXWVUM,"French soft porn film similar to the David Hamilton films, but nothing special ...and as most somewhat stupid and twisted in the characters",1431907200,7,139,5.086956521739131
