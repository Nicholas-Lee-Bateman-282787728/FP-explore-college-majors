1889083,5,B00009RDG9,"Who cares about the critics?They don't speak for the movie viewer. Im going to keep this as simple as possible, this movie IS AWESOME. Director William Friedkin gives us this film about the clash between teacher and student in THE HUNTED. What grabs me (other than the film) is the flawless direction of the knife fight scenes which the depict the Phillipine knife fighting art of SAYOC KALI.This is best depiction of the fighting art itself in American Cinema. My hats off to the superb Benicio del Toro and Tommy Lee for pulling off memorable intense, bloody, sharp fighting scenes. I thought it was sort of unique the way Friedkin chose not to put music during the fighting scenes between Aaron Hallum(del Toro) and L.T. (Tommy Lee) for one reason.
1. This is where Hallum was taught how to kill with bare hands and weapons. The forest, nature itself was his classroom and his hunting ground for humans, the sounds of nature make the scenes more realistic,ominous and deadly.
Overall, THE HUNTED is a classic William Friedkin brutal slugfest. A Fine tribute to the action genre as well as the Phillipine fighting art.",1056499200,,1120,4.808290155440415
1889084,4,B00009RDG9,"After the critical lambasting surrounding the release of ""Jade"", and the lukewarm reception of ""Rules of Engagement"",
'70s cinematic fireband William Friedkin once again galvanizes the soul with ""The Hunted"", an impassioned duet, an Oedipal wrestling match, a primal struggle that is his most audacious visual tapestry since ""To Live an Die in L.A."". Under his stellar direction, Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio Del Toro sizzle, stab, and scorch into an immortality of devastation, in this brimstone biblical tale of a soldier who wants to die like a soldier. You'll walk out of the room with grit on your face, having watched this filmic equivalent of a Johnny Cash song from a director who knows God, murder, and the evil that men do.",1055980800,,732,4.959349593495935

1889114,4,B00009RDG9,"The wind is in the thorn tree.

Yep, there is nothing exceptional to this Rambo formula remake. They use all the same clich they probably recycles some of the old Rambo blood and bullets.

Now you ask ""why we should watch the Rambo rehash?"" Well I'll tell you. Because instead of Richard Crenna, you get Tommy Lee Jones and most of his facial expressions; when they are not being hidden behind blood and hair. And instead of Sylvester Stallone, who was very good in ""Oscar"", you get Benicio Del Toro who can look more like a man betrayed than an old boxer.

The story is as old as the hills. L.T. Bonham (Tommy Lee Jones) is called out of retirement to track down a mysterious person or persons unknown that killed some hunters. The person turns out to be a soldier Aaron Hallman (Benicio Del Toro) that he trained to kill. Through a series of mishaps Aaron gets loosed and the inept authorities must compete with L.T. for the retrieval or destruction. However L.T. knows he is to only one to do it.

So does Aaron get away so he can kill again?
Does L.T. make his first kill or is he really a pusssy-cat?
Do the inept authorities realize their limits before it is too late?
Do we come away with any new insights?",1504828800,,1213,4.377777777777778

1889146,2,B00009RDG9,"As someone else wrote, if you like a bunch of chases and bloody knife fights without any kind of real plot or character development, you will LOVE this movie.  I, on the other hand, prefer, at the very least, a storyline I can get in to.  If we are to believe the description of del Toro's character, there wouldn't have been much of a movie.  He would have gone stealth in the wilderness and no one, including Tommy Lee Jones, would ever have found him.  Movie over.  But, instead, it was almost as if del Toro's character WANTED to be found.  Especially in that ridiculous foot chase through the city.  Come on....tracking someone on foot through a large, busy city?  At each turn, del Toro was giving TLJ breadcrumbs to keep chasing him.  del Toro should have been long gone by the time elderly TLJ emerged from under the streets to even begin chasing him.  Instead, no, he's right there.  I don't care how tough, smart, fit or good tracker you are....eventually youth HAS to win out.  For ME, the only redeeming scenes involved the wolf, oh, and the gorgeous scenery.",1474588800,,1071,4.549738219895288

1889156,5,B00009RDG9,The Hunted is one of my favorite thrillers. For some unknown reason it borders on obscure and I have no idea why. Its a steller thriller with bad ass performances by Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio Del Toro. Also has masterful direction by William Friedkin and some of the most original and exciting martial arts in movie history. The fight at the end is tough to beat for any movie.

1889204,5,B00009RDG9,"This is my favorite movie with Tommy Lee Jones as the protagonist. Benicio del Toro did a really super job portraying  the soldier that could not ""turn it off"".  The training that soldiers get are ingrained into their very being; to kill without hesitation. To put emotions into a box inside their head and lock it down tight -not to be opened again until their tour of duty is at an end. But, sadly, some can never learn to let their training...their war face...the cold killer that the military has ingrained so deeply, just simply 'go away'. To just turn it off and forget it. del Torro's character is one of these.

Tommy Lee Jones (or LT) has been raised by his father, a fighter, and his father's father, all trained in stalking, tracking, surviving. Blending in and becoming a ghost. LT does not like guns. He specializes in stabbing weapons. How to make them (even out of flint if necessary) how to fight with them, and del Toro's character was his most skilled and astute student.

The war is over. But the soldier that could not ""turn it off"" is loose in upstate new York...and his mind is filled with the atrocities of his murderous service for a government that NOW, just wants him dead. This movie is right up there with the great war dramas,  like;  Apocalypse Now. Saving Private Ryan. I have watched this movie at least a dozen times. The knife scenes are unbelievable! I believe that this video is very relevant at this time in Americas history. PTSD is a real problem with the poor young men coming home from fighting to keep America free. I think everyone above 13 should watch this movie to see what horrors the young men and women suffer to keep us safe...and free",1417219200,6,1685,4.526315789473684

1889209,4,B00009RDG9,"This an underrated and unfortunately it was one of those films that just came and went in the theaters. There wasn't a whole lot of advertising for the film when it came out but I will tell you it sure did surprise me when I rented it for the first time and then bought the DVD. The action is straight forward and intense but it definitely proves that when it comes to a knife fight, one person will go to the hospital and the other person will go to the grave. The great thing about this movie is that it proves that yes, you can bring a knife to a gun fight =)  The added bonus is learning more about the style of Filipino knife fighting techniques used for this film. I am Filipino and even I didn't know that Kali was the system used by the US Navy Seals. Anyway, there there are a contrast of styles between Del Toro's character and Tommy Lee Jones' character as well as how they fashioned their knives. This movie is definitely a must have.

1889211,4,B00009RDG9,"The Hunted is the story of a loyal U.S. Military Special Forces team member sent on a
mission to assassinate one of the Serbian rebels.
The action is great and the story is great, but the message is that our own Government betrays
it's own military and really does leave them behind.
I know cause I come form a Military Family and I know others in special forces and U.S. Navy SEALS
that were highly decorated Silver star recipients and Purple Heart winners.
We need to support our men and women and give them special assignments after being exposed to
the truths about ""War"".
The female FBI agent was a total ""fiction"" and nothing like real agents. I know quite a few. Procedures and other techniques
were way off the scale and not done(It's only a movie right)
The character ""LT"" played by  Tommy :Lee Jones was not as developed as is really used in training combat soldiers.
The Character trained soldiers for CQC type drills with a knife. The training is good, but without actual ""experience"", it is
useless for the field, unless you have a martial arts background.
The knife used or made was interesting, but many experts have debunked it as a throwing knife and just a partially well made survival knife.
All in all, it was a fun ride, but not very accurate but that is because the message was in another direction.
I also worked for the U.S. Secret Service, so I had to be a ""counter-sniper"" and ""Counter-Terrorism Expert.""
I also recommend a movie with Peter Coyote called ""Le Grande Arte""(1991) which has some really cool knife fights and real fighting techniques. Enjoy !!",1413676800,7,1582,4.65

1889235,5,B00009RDG9,"To me this was a terrific movie. Why?  Well, it's a passionate Frankenstein type of movie. Tommy Lee Jones at some point trained personnel who were valorous on how to become killing machines. One of his star students snapped and becomes a mass murderer, and Tommy Lee is brought out of retirement to look for his former student. He had spawned this maniacal cretin.  The passion to stop this man is palpable. Tommy Lee has five times more charisma than any human needs to become a movie star. Thus, he is truly a super-star. The struggle between the two men in my mind is like the struggle within any man against his bad self. Yet, in the last analysis, man can never destroy his bad self.  Only Christ can give a man the victory over the flesh, the world, and the devil. But, like Lord Byron 200 years ago, the heroic struggle of man is inspiring. It shows man at his greatest, yet the truth is man is weak and cannot overcome without Almighty God.  Tommy Lee sees himself as a kind of father to this murderous anomaly. He has to stop him, but in a certain way, he loves the guy.",1404345600,,1080,4.3316831683168315

1889241,1,B00009RDG9,"I didn't like this film and I hardly managed to watch until the end, for following reasons (some limited SPOILERS will follow):

- the story is stupid beyond anything that words can describe; nothing in this film makes the slightest sense, from the ridiculous beginning to the even more ridiculous ending

- all characters are clich&eacute;d - there is not even one a little more original

- the dialogs are lame; also, no humour, not even one good one-liner,

- we cannot relate neither to the fugitif (Benitio Del Toro), who is a barking mad mass murderer nor for the tracker (Tommy lee Jones), who is simply lame (and no, I don't men that he is limping); the only character we can feel something for is Abby Durell (Connie Nielsen) from Portland Police Department - but her screen time is very limited

- no police force in the world is as clueless and pathetic as Portland cops described in this film

- even if all Special Forces in US military receive extensive formation in close quarters combat (including the use of knife), use of explosives, precision shooting, wilderness survival and camouflage, there is no such thing as ""training of professional military assassins""...

- even if such thing as ""training of professional military assassins"" existed why in the world would it devote so many time to making of crude iron daggers, like those made in early Iron Age?

- it would take 15 seconds for the lazy scenarist of this film to check on the internet the basic fact, that NO US ground troops were deployed in Kosovo in 1999...

- a wolf taken in a trap, bleeding and half crazed with pain and fear, would ripe open the throat of any human trying to approach and especially to touch him; helping such an animal ALWAYS implicates first using a non-lethal tranq gun, because otherwise there will be blood - rescuers blood...

- neither Pentagon nor CIA are or ever were authorized to carry extrajudicial killings (asssinations) on the territory of USA; the idea that they do such a thing and the target is a US citizen is sheer LUNACY as it would be murder pure and simple and would be prosecuted as such; even the extrajudicial killing of a renegade US citizen (Al Qaeda operative Anwar al-Awlaki) ABROAD was allowed only ONCE in the whole history and it took the personal order of the President of United States (Obama in 2011) for this operation to be greenlighted

Considering the cast (Tommy Lee Jones, Benitio Del Toro, Connie Nielsen) and the director (William Friedkin, of ""Exorcist"" fame), this film is an almost total letdown - in fact it is just a completely failed remake of ""Rambo: the first blood"". A film to be avoided with greatest determination.",1396915200,3,2673,4.714592274678112

1889275,5,B00009RDG9,"""Actions speaking louder than words"" is the benchmark of what Alfred Hitchcock would label pure cinema. THE HUNTED is a dramatic tour de force of pure cinema. Tommy Lee Jones as the ""hunter"" and Benicio Del Toro as the ""hunted"" are perfectly cast and deliver frightenedly realistic performances. William Friedkin's direction disposes any hint of a smooth narrative flow. Instead Friedkin relies on the strengths of his two leads to interpret the strange camaraderie that exists between the man who teaches to kill and the man who will not stop killing. The teacher and the viewer know that there is only one way to stop the pupil. The opening of the film suggests that Del Toro has become traumatized by the inhumanity he witnesses in Kosovo and an extermination we see him carry out in that war zone. Now Del Toro has started killing hunters in the northwest forests and Jones must reluctantly agree to stop him. I really liked Del Toro's performance because he does not seem to be a man traumatized by bloodshed but instead needs a purpose to continue practicing the skills that he is so ever proficient at. I equally liked Tommy Lee Jones' performance because he instinctively knows of this primal need that Del Toro must satisfy. The minimal plot and other characters in this film are only synergist elements to set the stage for Jones and Del Toro. Strangely the viewer identifies with Del Toro's character because we only see him kill those that extinguish life. They take life without really questioning the overall purpose of the system of right and wrong that has been created here on earth. Jones too is an instrument to that end which we can not truly fathom.",1379289600,,1670,4.782006920415225
1889276,1,B00009RDG9,"This movie starts off ok, but the plot is so full of holes that if you actually question it you find the entire thing ridiculous.  I am mainly speaking of the finale scene when Tommy Lee is searching for Benicio's character at the end of a supposed climactic manhunt yet somehow they both have time to stop and forge hand made tools, one chipping away an arrowhead the other managing a 1600 campfire in which to forge old steel he finds on the riverbed.

1889282,4,B00009RDG9,"The Hunted is, in a way, the faithful adaption of the novel First Blood. I found the Hunted an entertaining and interesting ride. What really made this film work are the performances by Benicio Del Toro and Tommy Lee Jones. There is also some entertaining fight scenes as well, particularly in the beginning.

As I said previously, this film is, more or less, a faithful adaptation of the First Blood book, rather than the film First Blood. In the First Blood novel, Rambo goes insane from his experience in Vietnam and from losing all of his friends. Rambo goes on a killing spree, killing cops as well as civilians. This film pretty much follows a similar story. A man named Aaron Hallam, played by Benicio Del Toro, was a soldier for the U.S. Military that had returned from war. What he experienced during the war causes him to go crazy and kill innocent civilians. Meanwhile his old mentor L.T. Bonham, played by Tommy Lee Johns, has to track him down.

What makes this film is Benicio Del Toro and Tommy Lee Jones. I'm not to familiar with Benicio Del Toro's other work. The only other film I have seen him in is the Wolf Man. I thought he did a good job here though. Tommy Lee Jones has never given a bad performance in any of his films that I have seen him in. He is one of my favorite actors working today.

The film looks good too. There is a great atmosphere and tone set by the film. There is some good action as well. The beginning really had the best action scenes. However, do not go into this film expecting constant action. This movie is more of a drama than an action film. It is very much like the first Rambo film, which was more of a war drama.

Overall, if you are a fan of the First Blood novel and want to see how it would be on film, give this film a look. I say this film is worth seeing at least once. It is a good look at how war can affect people. People bashed this film when it came out, and I do not see why. It is not perfect, but it definitely does not deserve the hated it has gotten by both critics and users.",1368230400,,2045,4.209183673469388

1889286,4,B00009RDG9,"William Friedkin is a seasoned director with his share of hits and misses. Whatever his failings might be they aren't on the technical level. The man knows how to frame and set up a shot. It's just that at times the script isn't up to his technical abilities. That's the case here.

Here's the scoop. Benicio Del Toro plays Aaron Hallam, a high level ops dude who's been on too many missions and seen too many innocent people get killed. Ethnic cleansing in Kosovo puts him over the edge. Now he's gone renegade in the Pacific Northwest preying on hunters who are way over equipped to kill defenseless animals. The FBI brings in Tommy Lee Jones, an ace tracker who originally trained Hallam, to bring him in. Of course things go horribly wrong.

Like ""True Blood"", you have a top-level operative in the Northwest being tracked by feds who are nowhere near his ability to kill and survive. Like ""The Fugitive"" you have Tommy Lee, who knows his stuff, tracking a guy to bring him in. The meeting of the two films works fairly well. The dialogue is not really very good but is, thankfully, kept to a minimum. What is happening here is the movement through terrain. Friedkin lovingly uses the gorgeous territory to draw the viewer in. This is a breath stealing part of the country to begin with, and he shows the grandeur of the water, rocks, trees and everything else. You want to be there. And watching the high-level skill set of Jones and Del Toro is also very good. The techniques shown in tracking and hand to hand combat seem authentic. The two men's preparation for their final conflict is a bit over the top. Del Toro has nowhere near enough time to fashion the weapons and booby traps he uses. The final conflict though is choreographed and executed extremely well.

This is better craft than it is art but it's still a heck of a watch, particularly for guys. If you want a dose of some testosterone laden action, this goes well with beer and pizza.",1363996800,,1955,4.548295454545454

The movie also highlights the issues that plague soldiers when they come home from war.

1889301,3,B00009RDG9,"The Hunted(released Mar/03)is a mediocre flick that has much in common in its dynamic with The Deer Hunter & Rambo. It's a PTSD(post traumatic stress disorder) flick that soon leaves one looking at the watch and wondering when it's going to end(watch watching is NEVER a good sign).The direction here by Friedkin is pedestrian at best and he just doesn't pique our interest long enough to keep us and hold on to us.
The film opens with a flashback to Kosovo in the late 90s. A village is getting razed to the ground and its inhabitants shot. A US special force is on the ground and is going after its leader. Aaron Hallam(Benicio Del Toro)is one of those members and he completes his objective. Back stateside he cannot forget the horrific images burned into his mind and he becomes a recluse.
Fast forward to Oregon a few years later and two deer hunters are out in the woods. It appears,however,they are there for more than deer as they find Hallam and it is not a reunion they are after. Soon after Hallam announces his presence to them they start shooting at him. He takes them out viciously and soon a manhunt is on for Hallam.
The special agency that Hallam was originally a part of recruits Hallam's former teacher one LT Bonham(Tommy Lee Jones).Bonham is an extraordinary tracker and within a short time he has his man. Bonham asked to do his job alone but the FBI follows him and assists in Hallam's take down.
While under interrogation some high level government agents show up and claim Hallam for their own. During transport Hallam manages to escape and Bonham is called back in to assist in the search. They almost get him in an underground construction site but he eludes them and lands at his ex wife's house. There Bonham follows and finds him sitting in an upstairs room. It's a quick visit as Hallam again escapes into a wooded area where Bonham tracks him down,for the final time. It's a fight to the finish against teacher Bonham and student Hallam. Both get in some good licks but in the end the outcome is inevitable. Bonham retires back to his home in BC,and is seen burning the letters Hallam had sent him long before.
Once Halllam is caught the first time(within a half hour of the films opening)there is not much of another place or twist they can add on or go to that would make this film more interesting. Bonham is just such a good tracker that finding his former student within a short time is inevitable,no matter where Hallam may want to go;which leaves no mystery there. Hallam is suffering from PTSD and we have certainly seen that in a myriad of movies over the years,so again nothing new. Secret government agencies and operations,cover ups,usurping of local authorities,again this is old hat and given the less than stellar direction and script it turns quickly into a bore. Del Toro and Jones are good in their respective roles but not good enough to overcome the many filmic stumbling blocks they are presented with on a constant basis.

Benicio Del Toro? The same.(Why did they make Tommy Lee's character a major guerrilla trainer for the military, at the same time NOT making him 1 of their own? EXTREMELY UNLIKELY!!!) Connie Nielsen(the FBI woman) was way WAY beyond stupid and knocked @ least 2 stars off the rating. Her acting was affected, specious, phony, and vapid. Not intending to be chauvinistic but if they put a male actor in her roll, right off the top of my head I can't think of 1 on the same plane w/ Benicio & Tommy Lee, or maybe if they put Tommy Lee in her roll and put someone of high caliber in his, they may have had a 3 or possibly even a 4 star movie. In as poor acting as Nielsen afforded, she blew the movie apart on revealing what it is/was-another Hollywood ""action"" film pathetically trying to incorporate feminism, showing women in ""super-tough"" authoritarian rolls, while still being ""hot and sexy""(putting her in snug sweaters accentuating her nice heaving swelling full hot breasts). (Maybe they should have incorporated a ""wet t-shirt"" scene w/ her like they did for Kanakaredes(CSI:NY)in 1 or 2 of those lamer episodes.) This @ the same time portraying  massive gauntlets of highly trained SWAT operatives(all men, though mildly quiet, meek, and remedially castrated in their bearing, ""but tough enough"") as being slavishly subservient and obedient to ""the woman"", who justly wants to mete out retribution against her ""fallen comrades"".

The FBI enlists the man who trained Hallum in order to track him down, LT. Bonham Tommy Lee Jones.

As I said, the film delivers in being a chase picture. Hallum is always one step ahead and Jones is none too far behind. What I appreciate about the film is the fine pacing, it dives right on in into the action with everything unfolding. William Friedken, director of some the finest action films in film history such as The French Connection and To Live and Die in LA, is naturally up to snuff when it comes to the car chases and major action sequences. However what keeps this film from perfection ? A lack of originality. There are just too many echoes from films such as Rambo and The Fugitive without the critical psychological aspects. Hallum is a Rambo clone but we don't know why he goes on his blood bath; The film tries to suggest, I think, that he is disgusted by senseless slaughter but that's exactly what he does during the entire film. Also the biggest annoyance of the film by far was why LT. Bonham ignored Hallums pleas for comfort. We even saw the numerous letters Hallum sent being burned by Bonham at the end of the film. Bonham stated he never killed anyone, does he just sever the ties to his students once he was done with them ? Is he even disgusted by what any of them do with the knowledge he teaches them ? We don't know and the film doesn't seem to care.

I would recommend this film simply for the well done chase sequences and terrific knife play but this film could have been a lot more than a plagiarism of better films.",1275868800,,1820,4.446107784431137

Throughout the film, Tommy Lee looks wracked with guilt because of his past but doesn't do much about it. Meanwhile, Benicio plays the war scarred assassin with no way out.  That's pretty much the storyline as The Hunted combines chase sequences, Rambo First Blood forest scenarios and a one way ticket to the end.  There is a tremendous opportunity to up the psychological ante in the Hunted, but it never quite materialises.  Still, this is watchable especially if you're a Tommy Lee fan.",1256601600,,763,5.0

Nevertheless, for those who know that the logic for the action may be quite flawed but like to see chases and hand-to-hand combat, this should be a satisfying film. Obviously, those with no such taste will miss nothing by giving this a pass. Jones has nothing much to do beyond the action but looks good doing it; the actor playing the hunted does a commendable job doing what the hunted are supposed to do in films of this sort-not much acting but looking good in the closeups. Other assorted actors do all that was required of them without any embarrassing themselves. All-in-all, no significance besides action for the sake of action. Incidentally, relevant to this and many other films, both theatrical and made for TV: I do think it indecent to use scenes of real horror in the context of rather trivial even if entertaining pursuits. The justifiably respected principals of the film, no doubt agree, so that the presence of such scenes here probably means they drastically overestimated the quality of the film that they made.",1254355200,,1200,4.774038461538462
1889310,4,B00009RDG9,"Growing up in the 80s as a geeky kid with Cerebal Palsy, I grew to hate action films. Arnold Shwartznager and Chuck Norris seemed like idiots, and represented the right wing reactionary politics I despise. But seeing The Hunted  made me realize I don't dislike action films at all, just bad actors and comic book direction.

The Hunted stars Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio Del Toro. Jones trains Del Toro how to kill with knives in the army, and the student sees the horrors of war in 1999 Kosovo. He comes home and begins to kill hunters, as he has become an animal rights fanatic. His exposure to violence has embeded violence into him. He tries to do the nobel thing, but does not realize his own pathology in how he goes about this.

Assisting the FBI,  the teacher tries to track his renagade student down.

The Hunted, is of course, directed by the great Biily Friedkin, and this makes all the differance. During a car chase on a  rainy cold day, the car is stuck in traffic, and you can see the driver tired, cold, struggling with the steering wheel. You begin to feel tired. Your arms start to hurt.

In another scene, the instuctor teaches his students how to kill with knives, stabbing numbered points of the body. The instuctions are rote. Friedkin shows how young man are turned into murder machines with the same detatchment they are taught to drive or flip Big Macs. This is absolutely chilling, and not in a cinamatic, thrill-chill way. It really  sends a sick feeling through you.

The teacher is chasing his mad student out of guilt for the methodical trarining he gave him. Later, they end up in a knife fight. These cuts hurt. You can feel them going into YOUR skin. The duel is long and you realize, it is protracted, disgusting work to knife someone to death. It is a mean, horrible busness, even if it is self-defense.  Only Freidkin can take what would be action fare and elevate it into an anti-violent statement.

For the longest time, I have always thought Martin Scorcesse was our best filmmaker. His use of unique camara angles, imaginative transitions and attention to detail makes an extremely compelling case for this.

But after seeing The Hunted--which made me revisit French Connection  and The Exorsist--my money is now on Friedkin. He may not have the flawless track record of Scorcesse, but his feel for the viceral is simply amazing. Scorcesse uses the physical to work your emotions. Friedkin uses the physical to work your body, actually giving you tactile sensations that make you feel what his charactors are undergoing. It is astounding.

The Hunted is not a complex story, but the acting is fantastic, focusing on the emotions instead of the stunts. When you work with a director like Billy Friedkin, all you  have to do is act. Leave the action up to the master himself.",1248566400,2,2812,4.675456389452332

Another problem I have with it is Benicio Del Toro cast as a redneck backwoods guy from West Virginia. I think he does a good job but he is totally miscast. If you are going to have a hispanic guy play the part then change the characters back story and make him from somewhere else. He didn't fit the character at all... but he did a good job and he is a good actor. Tommy Lee Jones is just great in everything he does and was really good in this as was Connie Neilson.

The Hunted involves a Special Forces assassin, played by Benicio Del Toro, who begins to kill people in the Oregon woods using his highly evolved knife fighting and tracking skills. The FBI calls a former Special Forces tracker/knife fighting trainer, played by Tommy Lee Jones to help find the assassin.

From here, the movies involves into a classic cat-and-house game between the two men with the FBI in the middle. The knife fighting is realistic and intense.

1889319,4,B00009RDG9,"It's not hard to see how this movie got made.. a director known for gritty streetwise thrillers (The French Connection), about a soldier who was trained to kill, but now can't turn it off due to battle scarring (First Blood, anyone?), starring Tommy lee Jones reprising his role in the Fugitive, but with a twist..

Tommy Lee Jones is just the right casting for the role of the 'Tracker' - a man whose father was a soldier, but trained his son how to kill, and survive in the wilderness, be stealthy - in order that he would never have to kill. Now one of his proteges has gone rogue, and TLJ is brought out of retirement to track him down, meeting along the way the FBI agent played by Connie Nielsen.

The concept is a good one, if unoriginal. The idea of the tracker is fascinating, and as the extras on the DVD show, not without basis in fact - but the execution is a mixed bag.

On the plus side, the knife fighting scenes have a gritty fast moving realism to them that has rarely been seen. This is one of the movies big attractions. On the minus side, the movie feels like it has been chopped up, and pieces gone missing. Even the deleted scenes only give a hint to some of the directions the movie was going. There is a cynicism about Americas military here, similar to Friedkins last movie Rules of Engagement, but whatever message comes along with that has thinned out along the way. The roles the actors play do not leave the actors room to flesh out and inhabit their characters. Connie Nielsen does her best, which is pretty darn good, in a woefully underwritten role which seems in the end to serve little useful purpose.

On the whole though this is an edge of the seat chase movie, set in breathtaking, if chilly, scenery in Oregon and British Columbia, and should not disappoint. Just don't expect to remember much about it in a month or two.

So, if in the mood for a combination Fugitive/Rambo story with two very intense lead actors, this is a convenient diversion to play numerous times.

Tommy Lee Jones was the mentor who trained Benico Del Toro on the art of killing and now the ex-student has gone out of control and Jones must hunt him down, something the police can't seem to do. That's the story, simple as that. The only thing was a little implausible is that old man chasing down a kid for miles. Tommy Lee might be in shape, but he isn't young enough to do what he does here. However, both men are fun to watch and the action scenes are well done. You don't get bored watching this movie.

No, the film isn't high-grade mentality but it isn't totally stupid, either. It doesn't get carried and is pretty believable until the final chase scene.

1889324,1,B00009RDG9,"The Hunted (William Friedkin, 2003)

You're never sure what you're going to get with William Friedkin. You could get Cruising, or The Exorcist, or his remake of 12 Angry Men. Or, you could end up with Jade, The Guardian, or The Hunted. Yes, The Hunted definitely gets tossed on the pile of ""films William Friedkin will disown later in life."" If anyone else involved with the movie wants to be remembered fondly by the masses, they, too, will disown it.

It's painful to watch Hollywood in action sometimes. The trailers for The Hunted made it seem like ninety minutes of Tommy Lee Jones chasing Benicio del Toro through the woods. That might well have made for a good movie. Instead, we get about five minutes of Tommy Lee Jones chasing Benicio del Toro through the woods, a bunch of minutes of him chasing Benicio del Toro through other places, and a whole lot of backstory, subplot, and exposition that is entirely unnecessary to the film.

The basic plot (what the film should have been in its entirety) is that Aaron Hallam (del Toro), a very nasty government military type, has gone renegade after losing his mind during an assignment. He has become paranoid, and believes the government is now hunting him. (Whether he is correct is never truly exposed, one of the few plot elements where the film does refuse to capitulate to ""we need this in a Hollywood movie."") The government brings in L. T. Bonham (Jones), a tracker for the Canadian forestry service who used to work for the government training people to become very nasty government military types. You can see where this is going.

Obviously, you've got a rehash of David Morrell's fine novel (and, with the exception of the final five minutes, Ted Kocheff's equally fine film) First Blood, with del Toro as John Rambo and Jones as Col. Trautman. The trailers made this look like a different, and intriguing, take on the same material, with nothing but the two main characters hunting one another through the woods. But Hollywood doesn't like to do two-character movies, despite the breathtaking success of some memorable examples of the subgenre in the past (Closetland and My Dinner with Andre being the obvious examples). So somehow, somewhere, someone decided that Aaron Hallam needed a makeshift family, there needed to be a whole bunch of FBI agents, etc., and the movie ends up being more about the other stuff than about Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio del Toro chasing each other through the woods. Worse, when the obviouis showdown finally does occur, any semblance of realism the movie might have had goes flying out the window; it's the Grizzly Adams version of the scene where neither six-shooter ever runs out of bullets. Thoroughly stupid, and the movie gets knocked down half a point solely for its last ten minutes.

1889325,4,B00009RDG9,"Okay so basically William Friedkin has resigned himself to producing B moving hookum with A list actors who think that Friedkin just might have that magic left in him. The truth is that the Friedkin of ""The French Connection"" and ""The Exorcist"" fame was abducted and departed this universe only to be replaced by a less than accurate decoy copy of himself a looooong time ago.

Anyway down to the review. The Hunted is nothing more than a ludicrous story in order to set up various knife fight set pieces. The story is basically about a secret ""Black Op"" assassin (Del Toro) who has turned into a serial killer with a penchant for hacking up his victims with a knife. His old combat trainer (Jones) is sent to track him down and there is the usual cat and mouse type play so that Del Toro and Jones can go it at in a knife fight.

Let the truth be told. If you go for this movie on the basis that it is a hand 2 hand combat action flick and nothing more then you will enjoy it immensely and probably try to make yourself a blade the next day given the details in this movie. However, if you think that you are in for a serial killer classic, with huge performances from Del Toro and Jones with the backing of an ace director, Friedkin - then you will only convert the DVD to a coffee cup holster in no time.

A sad ending awaits all who serve the greater good. History is proof to this fact.

Del Torro plays Aaron Hallam an ex-soldier seriously traumatized by the horror he saw in Kosovo. We find out that Bonham (Tommy Lee Jones), who is sent to stop the killings was also the man that taught him how to kill. A great oppertunity to create a deep, psychological thriller. Unfortunately we get a rather shallow cat and mouse chase full of far-fetched action, while entertaining teenagers, this is nothing new for the rest of us.

What I would have liked to have seen is a better character study of Hallam. Ok so he turns mad after Kosovo, but we never go deeper than that, this could have really boosted the character and the film. Jones was good, but didn't have the script to flex his muscles.

1889328,4,B00009RDG9,"Other reviewers have already commented on action, plot, etc., so I would like to take this into realms psychological.

First of all, this film is a wonderful demonstration of a thesis basic to depth psychology:  those mythic stories we fail to take account of when they address us get lived out unconsciously.  ""Mythic"" in the sense of a primordial tale, not an archaic explanation.  The primordial tale addressing these two men is that of Abraham and his son Isaac.  The narrative voice at the start of the film lets us know that:  ""And God said, Abraham, kill me a son.""  This, then, is the given, the symbolic framework in which the older tracker/weapons master and the young soldier must operate.

Then comes the personal.  L. T. (Tommy Lee Jones) learned how to track, hunt, survive, and kill from his own father.  He taught those skills to Aaron, but they were not enough.  Overloaded with the stresses of war's insanity, Aaron writes to L. T. for help, but the older man does not know what to do, how to help (perhaps because his own father did not).

There are many traditions and myths describing how the older men initiate the younger ones into adulthood.  This film depicts a failed initiation:  the dilemma of an elder who ought to be a mentor but, never having been mentored himself, cannot give the male blessing to the younger man who needs it so badly.  Because of this, both have little choice but to live out the story of Abraham and Isaac in its most destructive implications.",1094515200,11,1495,4.652671755725191

Benicio del Toro (in an utterly bland performance) plays a trained killer who decides to kill two forest rangers and two hunters, telling himself that they were out to get him?  Even with an effectively disturbing opening in Kosovo, the movie ends up being a chase scene wherein Tommy Lee Jones (as always, effective) uses his tracking skills to track down Del Toro, lose him, track him again, lose him, etc.

Director William Friedkin (French Connection) paces it well and it has some good action scenes, but ultimately it gets repetitive and rather dull as we all know how it will end up.

Connie Nielsen (Basic) suffers through her rather needless role, and Leslie Stefanson as Del Toro's love interest provides some human spark to an otherwise heartless film.

Good action, but not involving enough to be great.",1094428800,,874,4.8389261744966445
1889330,3,B00009RDG9,"If you're the type of person who doesn't like character development and plot cluttering up your movies, THE HUNTED is for you. It's cold, bleak, violent, and pretty much all action. Various synopses may lead you to believe it has a plot, and the film actually starts to build up to one, but essentially eschews it all in favor of Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio del Toro beating each other up for 90 minutes. The good thing is that this is a William Friedkin action film, so you know it's going to be graphic, gory, and very pulpy, with a good (although short-lived) car chase, and slightly arty direction. Honestly, though, I was very impressed how there was no music blaring away as Jones and del Toro stabbed the hell out of each other. Say what you will, I'm a big Friedkin fan, and I enjoyed this one.",1090454400,9,802,4.425675675675675
1889331,4,B00009RDG9,"Aaron Hallam (Benicio Del Toro), has went off the deep end using his special forces killing techniques to fillet hunters who kill with ""irreverence"" as some sort of social statement.  Now it's up to the man who taught him L.T. Bonham (Tommy Lee Jones), a professional tracker and good ol' boy to bring him in.
The Hunted is simply a fun, sometimes silly non-stop action extravaganza low on story, dialogue, character development, and overall plot and heavy as a sumo wrestler on visceral, fast paced, beautifully choreographed and even more beautifully photographed action sequences.
Staring in Kosovo, in what can only be described as a vision of hell on Earth, we meet Hallam a special forces op/assassin who witness brutal mass murder at the hands of some tyrannical military force.  After his mission is carried out Hallam returns to the world and is given the silver star.  He then disappears into the woods and begins to carry out his crusade for animal rights, or so we're supposed to believe even though the details are hazy.  There's also a moment where Hallam says he was set up, but that's quickly forgotten along with his animal rights stance and we're left to believe that the guy just snapped.  Tommy Lee Jones is brought in as is the case in all these movies where only a retired agent/cop/tough guy can bring down this new threat, a threat he helped create.  After a brief, very brief, ploy by a shady government official Bonham jumps aboard to help bring in ""his boy.""  From there we're treated to chase after chase, hand to hand combat after knife fight and it's all breathtakingly captured by William Friedkin of The Exorcist fame.  A man whose made a name for himself by filming amazing car chase sequences.  So who better to call the shots on The Hunted, which is really one amazing chase sequence after another, than Billy himself who pulls everything off...amazingly!
You have to give the guy credit for not going the route seemingly all other action movies go these days when it comes to filming high octane action sequences.  I'm talking about endless slow-mo's and irritating Matrix-style visuals.  Here Friedkin keeps the action going at a fast pace.  The many hand to hand combat sequences between Hallam and Bonham are done with so much realism you I almost found myself grunting and grimacing along with the actors.  Bravo.  As far as the story is concerned it's all pretty much window dressing, thin window dressing at that.  Void of dialogue with all other characters (excluding Jones and Del Toro) there just for show.  Although Jones and Del Toro, who are great actors, spend most of the movie running and fighting it still took much skill to play these rolls only relying on physical prowess and the ability to show emotion without speaking.  Bravo again.  There's an out of place theology lesson at the beginning of the film that's just silly.  The story of Abraham and Isaac is employed simply for pretentious purposes I'm sure and carry little weight in the film itself.  Hallam looked up to Bonham as a father and at one point Bonham refers to Hallam as ""my boy.""  And of course Bonham is brought in by the government to essentially kill Hallam, but that's as far as the Bible lesson goes.
The Hunted has it's fair share of goof.  I found myself laughing out loud quite a few times at how silly some things came off as being.  Hallam's initial motive for killing hunters was simply ridiculous.  Also I have to say that Tommy Lee Jones seems a bit old to be engaging in hand to hand combat with anyone.  The final showdown is simply a one sided fight to what was ultimately a predictable finale that for a moment had me believing things were going to shift.  Alas they didn't and the end seemed like a cop-out quickie to a vaguely symbolic finale.
After watching The Hunted I came away smiling, superbly entertained, and recounting the numerous goofy moments.  I also praised Benicio Del Toro for his great, creepy performance, the break neck action sequences and director Friedkin.  But now in retrospect I find much sadness in the story and the characters.  It's really about two people neither one good nor evil, but walking that thin red line between the two.  The Hunted isn't a great film, but one that resonates in my mind causing a number of emotions.  If you're an action buff, The Hunted will surely suffice if you're in the mood for a quick action fix.  However, and it sounds weird saying (or rather typing) this, but I think there's much to be discussed about the characters, Hallam in particular.  I've found much to empathize with both men and ultimately feel sorrow for them.  Check it out!",1090022400,2,4644,4.713754646840148
1889332,3,B00009RDG9,"And that is nothing like sarcasm. Okay, it is. It's a lot like sarcasm, actually. Maybe if it weren't Tommy Lee Jones as the star it wouldn't be so obvious to any viewer, but to me what it came down to was a tough, know-it-all smart guy chasing a resourceful criminal that apparently no one else can catch.

The Hunted seemed to have promise in the previews. Jones of course is usually good in everything (others might say this is because he typically plays the same character). And since starring in The Usual Suspects, Benicio Del Toro can really do no wrong. But The Hunted is a strange film, awkwardly left of center, as though it was aware of it's own triteness so it tries to overcompensate for it in random areas - violence, gore, and casting for example. Watching the movie I couldn't help but feel it was far beneath Del Toro's ability. He is certainly more gifted than to play the run-of-the-mill action star that he is in The Hunted.

The Hunted is a typical disciple-gone-wrong movie. Del Toro, a deeply covert special forces soldier who ""doesn't really exist"" is so battle scarred that he goes AWOL and kills some innocent people. Once the government realizes this, they send the man who trained him - Jones - to track him down and catch him. From here it unfolds in an extraordinarily predictable way. The audience is left to feel as though they are watching out of obligation rather than actual interest - 9/10 viewers could probably outline the rest of the story. To try to hold our interest then, the filmmakers include a deep amount of gore in the movie, much more than a typical action film would have. Whether it's photos of decapitations or showing us orphaned children stepping though bodies in Somalia trying to find their parents, The Hunted delivers some disturbing scenes

The problem is that the film doesn't really earn the right to do this. What I mean is, if I'm going to look at sickening images then it really needs to be a good movie otherwise. I'm not going to look at it for the sake of looking at it, and unfortunately that's all The Hunted has to offer.

I advise avoiding this film despite the promising cast. You'll just be waiting for plot twists that never come and hoping Benicio gets back on track in his next role choice.",1086393600,,2265,4.557739557739557
1889333,3,B00009RDG9,"Benicio Del Toro is a great actor, and so is Tommy Lee Jones, but great actors can't save a movie with a tired plot.
The story is pretty similar to Rambo and U.S Marshalls and I couldn't help but think this was a redo of U.S Marshalls, only this time it was Del Toro instead of Snipes. As with most other action films, the plot had to be fairly simple, so as not to confuse the audience *sarcasm here*, and this is where most action-thrillers seem to fail for me, they are virtually plotless.
The film does not develop Del Toro's motivations adequately at the start, it relies instead on flashbacks which are pretty brief and aren't very convincing. It seemed to me like an afterthought to put in a motive for his conversion from being a hired killer to a part-time loony.
I don't want to spoil the film for you though so if you like action, I guess you won't be too disappointed. However if character development and great storylines are essential requirements for your viewing pleasure, you might want to watch something else, check out Del Toro in Traffic, or the Bourne Identity which is marginally better.",1081900800,,1110,4.555

The first twenty minutes show this in spectacular fashion. Tommy Lee Jones may have played his hunter act one time too many, but he is really effective.
People may accuse William Friedkin of being a director for hire in his later work, he still has a few tricks up his sleeve.

Well this is one of those kinds of movies, except when you're not laughing, you are snoring.  But I might add, there is suspense... you will be asking yourself ""When will this senseless movie ever end?""
Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio Del Toro fight in the woods camouflaged with their little man-made knives... making ooga-booga grunting noises as they swing away for 10 minutes.  Then they disappear again in the woods for a while to construct another lame knife and do the ooga-booga all-over-again.

But anyway, this movie reminded me of cross between 1993's ""The Fugitive"" and ironically 1981's ""First Blood"" (Rambo I).  The Fugitive because of the cat and mouse game played between Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio del Torro, and First Blood because of the setting and ""hunting tactics"".
The movie starts out with del Torro in the middle of a battle zone during the Kosovo conflict in 1999.  This was the most intense and realistic battle scene of this conflict I have ever seen on film.  Great special effects and tension.  You've got del Torro sneaking around, playing dead half the time, evading Serb soldiers to get to his final target, a Serbian commander who's ordering the shootings of every ethnic Albanian.  This scene is what finally made del Torro flip.
So del Torro is back in the states 5 years later and starts going on a killing spree, killing a group of hunters in the north west around Portland, OR.  It is then that we're introduced to Jone's character who was del Torro's killing instructor in the military.  So from here on out through the rest of the movie, we see a cat and mouse game between the two ranging from environs from the forest to a waterfall/river/damn, to the city streets and industrial complex.  It ends with an extremely bloody knife fight where both fighters end up near dead.
But anyway, the thing that really pulled me into the film was the great soundtrack.  Very powerful and emersive 5.1 surround track.  Especially the Kosovo battle.",1078790400,,1682,4.60738255033557

Aaron and his team of marines are on a assasination mission, their mission is assasinate a General who is leading a series of massacres in Kosovo. Hallam witnesses these massacres, images of burning houses and women and children being driven into the street, civilians being shot. Any normal person would snap, this he did. After leaving Kosovo Hallam suffers war trauma, he gets an award then slips into madness. We then the film transititions to his military instructor who taught him to assasinate. Also the man who was like a father to him. His name is LT. Bonham who is retired and helps animals out in canada. He has been asked by the FBI to help bring Hallam in.
Well I thought that end just left you hanging, you want more but what more can it give you. Very dry movie, if you want to watch a similar better version of this movie with mostly the same actors then I will suggest ""The Fugitive"" and ""U.S Marshalls"". Both good movies, this is just alot gorier than both. Its worth watching but the end leaves you asking for more and boy it sure pisses me off. I like the narrative by Johnny Cash in the beginning and the end. It gives it a real tense feel. If you really enjoyed ""U.S Marshalls"" or ""The Fugitive"" I suggest this, but don't get your hopes up for it to be better, the only thing that is better is the action. If the director had mixed the action with some really great twists and turns then this movie would've been alot better. It's rent worthy in my opinion, don't buy it. I personally liked the special features and the Documentaries, they were the boost of the whole DVD. They're fun to watch!

1889338,5,B00009RDG9,"I loved ""The Hunted."" I thought that it was a brilliant, suspenseful, excellant action film. It was bloody, but not nearly as bloody as ""Kill Bill Volume One."" I liked the way the killer killed. He used his hunting knife, and during the film, as a viewer, I could feel the way the future victiums felt. They didn't know that they were about to be killed, but they were scared. The two stars in ""The Hunted"" are Tommy Lee Jones and Benecio del Toro, and they were perfect in their roles.
When the film begins we meet Aaron Hallam, who is a soldier in a war battle in Kosovo. He witnesses explosions, burning buildings, and people shooting each other. Finally he stabs somebody in the throat, and we flash to a different scene. We then meet L.T. Bonham(Tommy Lee Jones) who is a retired military trainer. He is called back into action when a former trainee of his-Aaron Hallam-goes on a murder spree in Oregon. During his battle in Kosovo, he finally snapped, and becomes the very dangerous killer of four men. L.T. arrives at the lastest murder scene in the woods. He meets Abby Durrell, the agent working on the case, and he sees dozens of other agents looking around the scene of the crime. He likes working alone, and meets him in the woods, while looking around. He brings Aaron back with him, but while being transported to another location, he somehow mananges to escape. When L.T finds out about that he become determined to find him or kill him, because he is still very dangerous. Turns out, Aaron went to see his ex-girlfriend Irene Kravitz, and her daughter Loretta, Aaron and L.T. ensure a cat and mouse game, with either one of them being the cat or the mouse.
A main reason who I loved ""The Hunted"" so much was because it was a fun cat and mouse chase. The ending was also surprising, because whatever happened at the end, I thought that it was going to happen the other way. I didn't think that it would stick to formula, but it did. Kudos to Tommy Lee Jones. He once again mananges to give a great performance, and Benecio del Toro I don't really like, but he also mananged to be good in this film. It is not a film for everybody. It does have some very bloody scenes, especially the knife fight towards the end, but overall the film works very well. I only wish that I didn't miss this in the theatre. It would probally have been much better there.

The violence fits the story, however, the irony of the beauty of the Northwest and the gore of the movie are totally opposite.  This is the story of a teacher who must go after a student who has strayed.  Del Toro is absolutely believable.  Jone's does a credible job in tracking down his student and in fighting.  The constant battle gets to be much.  Yet you see Jones using stick-to-itiveness throughout and there are many opportunities for him to give up.

Jones plays L.T.Bonham who trained Aaron along time ago and now feels as if it is his responsibilty to catch Aaron and put an end to the murders. The film has a pretty good start but eventually begins to drag,making you feel like running to a video store while the movie is still playing,pick up another one and be ready to pop it in by the time the movie ends.

1889341,3,B00009RDG9,"I will start off by saying that I expected a little bit more from this movie, especially since Tommy Lee Jones usually is a guarantee of a good movie. Benicio Del Toro has also done some pretty good movies in the past. This movie is mediocre. The plot is old, and I would say pretty much used up.
The movie is about the ex-special forces trainer L.T. Bonham (played by Tommy Lee Jones) being called in to assist the FBI in tracking down an elusive killer. Several deer hunters have been viciously murdered in the woods of Oregon and Washington, and it appears to be the work of a skilled assassin. L.T. takes on the task of tracking down Aaron Hallham (Benicio Del Toro), which in his past life (working for the military as a civilian expert) he has trained in survival and assassination techniques.
The whole movie is full of little annoying glitches that take away from the credibility of the movie and makes it all seem quite far-fetched, occasionally even bordering on corny. It is a cross between ""The Fugutive"" and ""First Blood (Rambo),"" but sadly, it doesn't hold a candle to either.
There is the bad boy that is a highly skilled killing machine that is running around in the woods and in the city (Did anyone say Rambo?), being chased by the good guy, which has almost superhuman tracking skills (The Fugitive?).
I enjoyed the action in the movie, and the actors are good. Ordinarily this would be exactly my type of movie, but due to the corny plot and poor execution, I only give it 3 stars!!!",1074211200,,1503,4.529411764705882

But there are so many plot holes in this movie it was hard for me to recommend it highly.  Both lead characters should have died long before the end of the movie.  I suppose super soldiers have incredible endurance and twice as much blood as most people.  Benicio Del Toro should have drowned when he jumped into the Columbia River.  If the impact didn't kill him the current would have pulled him down.  I know this river personally and the current is incredibly strong.  Tommy Lee Jones character said Benicio could ""swim like a fish"" but I doubt he could breath like one.  Also, Benicio is being chased by agents and cops so what does he do, he builds a fire and fashions a blade.  Good idea.  Tommy gets stabbed in the leg by a long, sharp stick which apparently only made him angry because he didn't bleed from that wound thereafter. Then he falls onto some rocks on his way down a large waterfall, then pulls himself out and shortly gets into a knife fight with Benicio. It is only near the end that the editing and plot take a back seat to reality.  Am I supposed to believe that Benicio set an elaborate trap of two logs that come smashing together a la ""Return of the Jedi""?  I realize that he isn't your normal human soldier but hiding might have been a smarter plan.  He is able to blend with the shadows, yes?  Then there is the scene where Tommy is just dripping with water, and only moments later he is completely dry.  Anyway...it wasn't a complete waste of time.  In fact, the fight sequences were enjoyable, albeit bloody.  And there were some other scenes that were fairly well done.  It just didn't make much sense.

The killings and slaughtering of hundreds of Albanian men,
children,women and elder people by cruel and idiotic serbs haunt him and change the path of his life. So back in U.S.A. he protects deers and other animals and kills all their killers.

  Not only are two great actors puzzling with their appearances in such a sorry flick but there seems to be a worrying trend in casting good actors in bad films lately.
  ""Hunted"" is nothing more than a rip-off from the 1st Rambo film with more...knives.  There is just an excuse for a plot (and a bad excuse at that) and there's practically minimal dialogue as it would be close to impossible to adapt any meaningful dialogue to an almost inexistent storyline.
  Speaking of that, the plot is basically about an ""unnofficial army trainer"" (T.L Jones) who goes after one of his most prized ""students"" when the latter ""loses it"" and starts chopping up people up in the mountains where he's found refuge after a blurry involvement in...Kosovo has made him a walking psychological trauma.
  From there on the barrage of cliches is unrelenting. The ""killing machine"" who cant be caught unless the ""teacher"" tracks him down. The ""killing machine"" who evades scores of police cars in the most unlikely circumstances and butchers up other trained- and multiple in numbers- cops, agents, etc.
  The ingenuity of the ""killing machine"" who has time enough -as does his teacher- to construct a knife from scratch while being in hot pursuit by half the poilice force and the FBI in his area.
  And so on and on and painfully on.
  Of course, any b-movie is better than this because, at least, a b-movie doesnt take itself seriously. ""Hunted"" does and it becomes all the worse a film for it.

Since his academy award winning performance in The Fugitive, it seems like he's starred in just about every chase flim since. The characters that he plays are all slightly different but essentially the same. But there's three things you can count on with most of these films, and that is they're an entertaining ride from the beginning, there's inevitably an action scene involving water or a water fall, and old Tommy always gets his man, dead or alive.
~The Hunted~ moves along quickly, beginning with Benicio Del Toro's character on a search and destroy mission in Kosovo. He mission is successful and he is awarded the Silver Star for Valour, however this success comes with a price - his sanity. As it turns out, the boy is a killing machine gone rogue, currently murdering innocent civilians in the forest, and the only person who can match his skill and apprehend him, is the guy who trained him in the first place. Tommy Lee Jones plays a character based on a real individual, who trains the military Special Forces to survive in the wilderness, track animals and humans with hardly anything to work with, and expertly kill with a minimum of fuss. Now with all the necessary background information firmly in place, the stage is set, and the chase commences...
The most fascinating thing to watch in the film is the knife battles between Tommy Lee Jones and Del Toro. One can see that the actors have been expertly trained and have spent many hours rehearsing to ensure these knife scenes come off in a realistic fashion. The battles do in fact run a little too long, as with any fight on the silver screen, but that's the only unreal aspect, otherwise they're extremely believable.

The rest of the film is about how neither his old special forces bosses not the cops are anywhere near hard enough to catch and restrain Hallam but Bonham of course is. And, yes, it is as routine and predictable as it sounds.

There's a father-son thing going on between Hallam and Bonham that is enormously contrived and unconvincing and has the feel of something tagged on at the last minute in a failed bid to add a little emotional depth to a film that doesn't have any. It is decently enough acted especially by Jones -though he is surely getting a bit old for this kind of part - and pretty efficiently directed by Friedkin. I just wish he could have found something more interesting to direct.",1071619200,,1374,4.5

Undoubtedly, Mr Jones and Mr Del Toro are watchable (and bankable) actors.  Because it is R rated - lots of knives and descriptions of how to carve up a man - it's audience I guess is lonely young men who fantasise about violence, or who have a thoroughly unhappy view of humans and relate better to dogs and squirrels than they do to their neighbours.

1889352,3,B00009RDG9,"""The Hunted"" is a nice action film that follows in the footsteps of ""First Blood.""  It was filmed right here in Portland, Oregon, so Oregonians will get a kick out of seeing Portland become the battlefield for several chase scenes.  The script of this film is quite bad.  While I like Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio Del Toro, their lines seem to be quite awkwardly delivered.  I'm not quite sure about the reason for this.  Jones seems to be playing a character he has played before and rushes his lines without giving us any sense of why he is doing so.  Despite this setback, the film does achieve much in the action sequences and does a pretty good job when no one is speaking.  Furthermore, I enjoyed the fact that I had a hard time taking sides in this film.  It is unclear who the ""bad guy"" is, and the only real candidate for the slot is the government.
I really enjoyed the knife fighting sequences in this film.  They look exceptionally realistic and more down-to-earth than many other knife fighting scenes I have viewed over the years (think Segal).  The survival and tracking aspects of this film will awaken any outdoor enthusiast and make him or her want to head out for the wild.  I enjoyed all of these sequences and even wanted more of them.  All in all, while I was entertained by this film, it drags in many sections and I would have liked to see the characters develop themselves more.  As far as the special features are concerned, the documentaries are quite interesting-particularly the one on Tom Brown, the tracking and survival expert used to give the film a realistic feel.",1071187200,,1597,4.56140350877193
1889353,4,B00009RDG9,"I only take a star away from this movie because the end of it is foreseeable very early.  The rest is perfect.  The acting is incredible, the plot is quite layered, and the fight scenes are in a league by themselves in terms of movie fights.  Most fights in movies are standard standing-waiting-to-be-hit affairs, where the characters show no pain after taking blows that, in the real world, would have sent them crumbling to the ground.  Granted, after taking a stake through the thigh Tommy Lee Jones' character would never have been able to stand and fight on it, but the scenes are impeccably choreographed and very real, with the martial arts angle adding further realism.  It was an especially nice touch that Jones didn't hook up with the FBI agent at all during the movie; it was all about him and Del Toro, and their story together, which made it all the more realistic.  At the end he goes back to being a lone wolf, and is perfectly satisfied, as is the audience.  This film is definitely worth seeing, and if you like this kind of film worth buying.  Be warned, though, the violence (especially the opening scene) is excessively graphic and bloody; in other words, real.",1071014400,,1182,4.649038461538462
1889354,2,B00009RDG9,"I found this movie to be a clich through and through.  It was predictable and pretty boring.  The cat and mouse was just tired and rehashed.  Tommy Lee Jones is much older than Del Toro, so while he was believable as a teacher, it was beyond belief that he could hunt him down and fight him as if he was just a young athletic himself.
There isn't much dialogue in the film, at least not much that matters much.  There aren't any good twists or surprises.  There are other cat and mouse movies, Cliffhanger and Shoot to Kill, two examples that are set in the woods, that are much more exciting and offer more plot twists and more developed characters.

We have given reasons (VAGUE REASONS) why suddenly Del Toro cannot stomach being a killing machine any longer, so what does he do...goes rogue and kills.  There is only one person who can catch him, Tommy Lee Jones, who is ageing.
So starts a nice cat and mouse game - but who is the cat and mouse.  Nice watch, but will soon fade.  Doubt most people would want repeat views of this movie, is do, suggest getting a used copy.

1889357,3,B00009RDG9,"From the first frames of this interesting and somewhat offbeat movie, I found myself fascinated by the setting in the snow-graced forests of the Pacific northwest, where retired government martial-arts and assassin training expert Tommy Lee Jones walks with both grace and purpose through the winter splendor of the chilly landscape. However unlikely the action as depicted in the scenes, it was a marvelous set of opening scenes, providing a key insight into the lead character's humanity and perspective. Little would I know that this was perhaps the most satisfying aspect of this taut suspense thriller.  Lee is soon whisked away almost involuntarily to help solve a pair of horrific murders of seasoned and well-armed hunters in the area, only to discover the assailant was one of the expert assassins he helped train. From there the mystery begins to deepen, and Lee finds himself locked into a death struggle on a number of levels both with the assassin, played well by the charismatic Benico Del Toro.
Del Toro's character is haunted by memories of atrocities he witnessed in Kosovo, and his former government handlers are trying to convince Lee that Del Toro has simply gone renegade. Yet there are signs that there may be some truth to Del Toro's suspicions, as told to Lee indicating that he had been set up, that the hunters he executed in the forest were in fact government assassins come to terminate him. The viewer is taken on a whirlwind ride through forest, suburb, and through a variety of cityscapes, and a few of the chase scenes are entertaining, amusing, and quite ingenuous. The plot sometimes suffers from more bullet holes than any of Del Toro's victims, but if you can suspend your critical faculties enough to enjoy the fireworks, you will likely enjoy this potboiler effort at government intrigue gone horribly wrong.

The knife fights are memorable. No cute and coy Steven Seagal dancing here. These men push themselves in these scenes and make you believe it. It's true though, as other reviewers have said, that the story development was sometimes a little vague and unrealistic. For example, as another reviewer pointed out Jones plays a *top* trainer of elite killers who claims that he's never had to kill himself. Just from my own military experience that strikes me as pretty unlikely. Nevertheless, this movie grabbed me. It's a blast, just don't pick it to death (Sooo, if you're a guy and you need to have everything about the plot and character behavior spelled out for you so you can 'truly experience the film' then I think you'd be happier watching a Kevin Kostner flick with your boyfriend.

Except the guy he's after in this isn't innocent, he's a brutal cold blooded killer. He trained him to kill and now he went nuts and can't stop killing. Now he's the only person that can stop him. That's the plot student vs teacher. When they aren't having brutal fights, Tommy Lee Jones is tracking him down in the woods, sewers, old gf's houses and down busy streets. It's all fun though and it's nice seeing Tommy Lee Jones chasing a guy that's actually dengerous for once. Benicio Del Toro is scary as the guy he trained and that lost his grip on reality. Despite not playing characters that are developed that great, Lee Jones and Del Toro play them well. Their fight scenes are well done and possibly the most brutal fight scenes seen on film in awhile.

1889361,4,B00009RDG9,"This movie has the most realistic knife fights ever filmed...Well, kinda. Since I actually train in knife fighting, I can tell you this, Toomy Lee Jones & Benico Del Toro characters must have really liked one another very much. A real knife fight, as the ones that have taken place in the phillipines for decades, are quick and brutal. If you think a real knife fights last longer than a few seconds, you'd be mistaken. But, with the premise of this film, these characters are very skilled at Kali/escrima/Silat, the characters could possibly pull off all the blocks that keep these knife fights going; maybe... Both Jones & Del Toro were trained by the team of Tom Kier and Rafael Kayanan, two of the most noted instructors of Sayoc Kali in the world. I think their movements were very realistic and believeable.
With all that said, I did enjoy the movie. I wouldn't call this a masterpiece, but I wouldn't call it garbage either. It produces the type of film you see in the previews. The Tommy Lee Jones character is based on a real person, Tom Brown Jr., who is a remarkable man with some amazing talents; he known as the best Wilderness survival and Tracking expert in world.

Benecio Del Toro can't save this movie in any way. Tommy Lee didn't get much help with the script, so that's why his performance wasn't that good. You have a specially trained agent who goes haywire and starts killing people, but it never explains why he went crazy in the first place. What triggered this behavior?..I don't know.

1889365,2,B00009RDG9,"""The hunted"" is, so far, the worst film of 2003 that I have watched. There are so many flaws, so many wrong things; I'm amazed that a multi-million dollar budget like this one has such a poor script, edition, direction and even casting. Three actors I consider excellent - Tommy Lee Jones, Benicio del Toro and Connie Nielsen - deliver in ""The hunted"" the worst acting of their careers - well, in fact Tommy Lee was worse in ""MIB II"", but this is a close call.
Del Toro is simply awful as the ex-black-ops soldier who sees horrors while in action in Bosnia, and then suddenly snaps and begins a murder spree in Oregon and Washington State woods. But other than watching one single scene where he's troubled by nightmares, there's no explanation of why he turns into a wild murderer. Tommy Lee Jones is summoned by the FBI to help hunt del Toro down, because the older one was the former killing insttructor of the younger one. What's laughable is that Tommy Lee's character prides himself of never having killing anyone, and that's a little hard to believe about someone who is considered one of the best about teaching other people to kill. The chasing scenes are terrible. Del Toro is always ahead, and manages to loose Jones' pursuit. But then Jones, who surely must have been created by a fox, or a leopard, just snifs the air, or sees a foot print on a lawn, and is back on the track again. Pitiful. Connie Nielsen's character is completely neutral, and clearly just a beautiful face to go against del Toro's dark, disheveled looks (and those black marks under his eyes get bigger each movie) and Tommy Lee Jones' scraggy gray beard. I don't remember any of the other characters. But it doesn't matter. The prize question is, why do these award-winner actors agree to be part of such a bad movie?
Psychological level is zip. And that is very strange, because the director, William Friedkin, is responsible, back in the 70s, for what I consider to be one of the best psychological thrillers of all time, ""The exorcist"". But in ""The hunted"" it's just plain action and chasing scenes. Most of them are good ones, but some aspects are ridiculous. For an example, Jones' character gets a spike buried deep in his thigh, then he takes it out and manages to continue his pursuit without even limping. Ha-ha. I know this is fiction, but there's a limit to everything. This is to show the script was poorly and amateurishly done. And the trailer is misleading. In it, most of the scenes shown are in the woods, trying to re-create a ""Rambo"" atmosphere, but in fact most of the movie has the city of Portland as background.
Movie studios: don't treat your viewers as idiotic people. In the end, it will backfire on you.
Stay away from ""The hunted""; it isn't worth the admitance or rental price.

I guess that's a roundabout way of saying how the pacing was really ungainly and awkward.
Anyhow let's get to the good stuff:
The first opening battle scenes looked terribly fake. It was obviously filmed inside a studio. I don't know why it seemed fake. The way the people were dying was really fake. They flayed themselves about in an overly dramatic cartoon kind of way. And I guess it looked terribly busy in terms of the amount of ""authentic"" detail was being pushed up against your eyeballs. The darkness and the all smoke and explosions looked overly done as well.
Onto the rest of the movie:
The lovely wilderness scenes of the forests in BC and Oregon are absolutely gorgeous, and I wouldn't have minded if the rest of the movie was filmed in such locales but alas the director thought it necessary for us to switch to an urban setting for a better part of the filming. His mistake. Who cares about the city!?
The female FBI agent was the most unconvincing female FBI agent I have ever beheld! Her spindly little arms, too pretty face, and spindly long legs all looked more suited for the cat walk instead of the physical rigours of an FBI job. Look, Gillian Anderson of X Files fame makes a more convincing FBI agent due to her beautiful natural real people looks and the natural authority in her demeanor and face instead of the sad limpy so-called commanding prescence of our skinny glamour-puss FBI agent in this movie. I could not help but laugh whenever she squeaked out some order.
I was afraid her spider-like arms could not hold up her little gun. What an ill choice!
I thought it was equally revolting that we had the incredibly unnecessary interlude with Del Toro's lady friend and the lady friend's daughter. BTW, I really wanted to kick the little girl due to her cardboard saccharine sweetness. It was so FAKE! STOP IT! ACT LIKE A REAL GIRL! Real girls bite and kick and muck about. They are not all happiness and sunshine!
The training scenes were intriguing, but at times resembled a bizarre Broadway chorus line with the constant slightly funny excercises and such.
Yes, Del Toro's motivation were opaque at best. They hinted here and there, but in the end I was worked up into a fit of sleep.
The only good thing was the understated acting of Tommy Lee Jones. I guess he took the job to pay for that house in Tahiti. We could only be so lucky.",1065225600,6,2603,4.516949152542373

""The Hunted"" is about hunting alright, but the poachees are not your average antelopes or hyenas but human beings.
This soldier's teacher, played by Lee Jones, is the only guy who can supposedly contain him. Incidentally this teacher has never seen a battle but coaches elite US forces in armed sniper combat (assassination). Sure thing.
Apart from the jerky narrative and a secondrate screenplay, the story is basically just that -- a guy gone awry while hunting, and a GoodGuy trying to capture him. No surprise then that the flow is very, very drawn out. Be prepared to see the two characters sharpening their own knives for a duration of 10 minutes or so. Benecio's character could have slain Lee Jones' character blindfolded, not only with his knife skills but also with his lame dialogue (especially in an interrogation scene where we are fed a wholesome 15 minutes of how animals should be respected, which, btw, has little to do with Kosovo.) Oddball Biblical undertones and a totally out-of-place performance by Connie Nielsen complete the production.

While the Hunted is somewhat interesting, Friedkin seems to forget what made his earlier movie such a success:  it had a real story with real characters and the big chase was only one small portion of the movie.  In this newer film, the chase is everything.
Benicio Del Toro plays a government assassin who has gone over the edge and now is killing people in the forests of the Pacific Northwest.  Tommy Lee Jones is his former trainer who is now called in to track him down.  Initially this goes rather well, but soon enough, Del Toro escapes custody, and half the movie is little more than Del Toro escaping one dragnet after another.
This is a movie with a lot of unrealized potential.  The plot is almost too straightforward, with nary a twist in sight.  Neither of the two main characters are nearly as interesting as they should be, and the action scenes are relatively routine.

Watch closely; those two ""hunters"" Del Toro's character kills are not hunters but rather ""sweepers,"" sent to kill him. Similar to Jones's character in ""Under Seige,"" who has an attempt made on his life by his employer, the CIA. Then he takes over a ship and Steven Seagal gets to display his acting skills...
  Well. The knife fights are fantastic. Not realistic, as they probably wouldn't last more than one or two slashes in reality, but fantastic as in well-choreographed and well-acted.
  Also interesting is Tom Brown Jr.'s involvement with the film. Brown is a man who learned tracking (among other things) as a child. He owns a tracker school in New Jersey. He was an advisor on the film, and taught the actors a number of things, including how to flake stones into knives, and other fun stuff. He has a ton of fascinating books, containing a combination of practical advice and insight on survival and everyday life, as well as spiritual insight, which, like all spiritual insight, can be taken with a grain of salt and possibly utilized in one's daily existence.

The next scene shifts to the year 2003, in a wooded area in Oregon, where Tommy Lee Jones rescues an animal who has been caught in a trap. He's a retired CIA trainer who lives like a hermit and works occasionally for the police as a tracker in solving crimes.  It seems like several deer hunters have been viciously murdered, and the FBI is stumped.  Film casting being what it is these days, the FBI leader is a woman, Connie Nielson, who is just too good looking for the role.  But hey -- this is Hollywood.
As the film moves along, we learn that it's all because of shell shock as well as a high regard for animal life, that has pushed Benicio Del Toro over the edge and makes him the killer. The plot thickens because Tommy Lee Jones is the one who trained him to kill. And so the rest of the film is a cat and mouse game between these two men.
The director, William Friedkin, did an excellent job in creating the tension and making the fight scenes seem so real that I could almost feel the blows.

1889375,2,B00009RDG9,"Just how long can a once-great director coast along on his early-career reputation?  That's the question I found myself asking while watching ""The Hunted,"" the latest fiasco by William Friedkin, the renowned filmmaker who gave us ""The French Connection"" and ""The Exorcist"" thirty long years ago.  Is it possible to find another director who started out so promisingly and tanked so badly?  And, yet, somehow, because of the extraordinary quality of those two seminal films, his name still conjures up a great deal of respect and affection among action and horror film aficionados.
""The Hunted"" is a bland, hopelessly run-of-the-mill, would-be thriller that asks the age-old question, ""What happens when a man, who's been trained by the military to be a `killing machine,' suddenly goes off the reservation and starts eviscerating people he, through sheer paranoia, believes are up to something evil?"" (it should be pointed out that this last aspect of the scenario is never very fully developed in the course of the film).  Benicio Del Toro plays Aaron Hallam, the psycho with nine lives (and seemingly nine hundred escape plans) who leads the FBI on a merry chase in and around Portland and its scenic environs.  Hot on his trail is Tommy Lee Jones as L.T. Bonham, the man who trained Hallam in the ways of killing and now has to find a way to put a stop to him before he can do more damage.
Del Toro and Jones are far too talented to be stuck in a vehicle such as this one, with Jones, in particular, looking tired and understandably baffled as to why he is still playing out variations on his ""Fugitive"" role ten years after the fact - even though, in this case, it is HE who finally gets to plunge over the waterfall into the roaring rapids below.  Maybe he's been waiting a decade to do that and saw this film as the perfect opportunity.  Hallam is so effective at dodging his pursuers and inflicting mega damage on all around him - while escaping unscathed himself, of course - that his character achieves all the truthfulness and plausibility of a Freddy Krueger knockoff.  And there is certainly enough splicing and dicing, flesh-cutting and bloodletting to fill a typical ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" installment.  Most of the stunt sequences are standard-issue and downright laughable, while the FBI, as usual, emerges as a bunch of incompetent hacks who can't even catch a single suspect while the object of their search is able to effectively dispose of a number of their finest agents armed with nothing more sophisticated than some well-honed hunting knives.  What is, perhaps, most dismaying about ""The Hunted"" is the fact that the script doesn't even try to put any kind of new spin on this old material.  The film is, literally, nothing more than a distended chase sequence with no interesting plot twists or character revelations to distinguish it from a hundred other films of a similar nature.
""The Hunted"" also trivializes the kind of trauma soldiers suffer as a result of their experiences on the battlefield by showing yet another army veteran flipping out and committing wholesale slaughter once he's returned to civilian life.
As for Friedken, all I can say is that his glory days appear to be gone forever.  ""The Hunted,"" despite the pedigree of its director and the big names in its cast, is clearly the work of a hack.",1062892800,4,3343,4.825174825174825
1889376,3,B00009RDG9,"This movie had a lot going for it; a plausibly good story-line, great actors in Jones and Del Toro, and a director with a proven (albeit distant) track record.  It did not live up to its' promise.  The acting was fairly good.  Tommy Lee Jones gives his standard (in his case that means ""good"") performance but shows his willingness again to put his talent into lesser productions (remember ""Double Jeopardy""?).  Benicio Del Toro has shown his talent in the past but is given little opportunity to do so in this movie.  His role is essentially non-verbal.  The other acting is adequate or better.
The main problem with this movie is the story-line.  We have seen the story of the returning special forces hero who can't handle society so he drifts away to the wilderness.  We're ready to see that again in this movie as the stage is properly set.  The problem is that the secenery changes too often and too fast.  The actual wilderness scenes are very well done and the photography is excellent.  I give the director his due on the first third of the movie.  But our anti-hero is too quickly captured and the action switches to an urban surrounding.  There is a lot of action throughout the movie and nobody seems to be able to get a solid hold on Del Toro's character (including, at times, Del Toro himself).  Ultimately the scene changes from downtown Portland to the wilderness again.  You tell me how two men on foot can get from one extreme to the other in a brief amount of time and find each other so quickly.  Not only that but they do so while the whole of the federal, state and local law enforcement agencies with all of their technology and resources are unable to do so.  It gets worse.  Our anti-hero has the time to forge a knife while waiting for Tommy Lee who takes time to create his prehistoric blade.  Their fight is not choreographed very well and we are again pressed to accept that a series of deeply embedded wounds will not slow either combatant down.  It was too much for me to accept although I'm probably too pragmatic for my own good at times.
There are scenes that are meant to embellish the meaning of the movie.  Our hero, Tommy Lee Jones, is first met tracking a wounded wolf.  He catches up with the wolf, removes the trap from its' paw and puts a healing solution on the wound.  I was waiting for the wolf to lick his hand.  This, we come to understand, is what he will be called upon to do for Benicio.  There's a children's hide and seek game in an airport that seemed, at first, meaningless.  Of course, the meaning is found in Tommy Lee Jones telling the girl where the boy has hidden.
The time of the movie (95 minutes) puts this in the B movie class and much of what happens in it substantiates that.  It could have been a better movie than it is.  But it isn't.",1062806400,2,2802,4.409356725146199

This is not the case, however, THE HUNTED is a mature and stylish action potboiler with no fluff and some good old american violence.  What transpires is a taut cat and cat game (forget the mouse) that culminates to a great showdown.  Both leads are cooly effective, especially TOMMY LEE JONES who shines in a role that is thankfully a lot different than his turn in both FUGITIVE movies.  At just under ninety minutes, this film is a nice change from usual Hollywood fodder.

Troutman with cinema's other great Tommy Lee. and Brian Denehy's red neck posse with the FBI and a covert Sweeper team and you have ""The HUnted"".  That said, this is an unbelievably good film.
  Like ""First Blood"" this movie is all about knives...not nifty ones with blades twelve feet long with handy hollow handels filled with fishing line, sewing kits, portable toasters, an electric blanket, and a nose-hair trimmer..no these are real functional knives.  combat knives wrought from raw steel or a chunk of flint.  Furthermore they are about the men who weild them: The troubled and possibly paranoid trained killer, and the man who trained him.
  DOn't forget the Johnny Cash music.
The opening battle scene is as gritty and distubingly realistic as anything I've seen, and the one-on-one fights are absolutely plausible and true.  No one is being hoisted by a winch, pulled on wires, or being filmed by ninety cameras to provide nifty 360 views...this is BETTER.

1889383,2,B00009RDG9,"Read this plot synopsis quickly.  The film picks up in a battle in Kosovo in 1999.  Del Toro is introduced as a soldier in a special opps group as he witnesses the horrors of war.  Fast forward four years and Jones is introduced as the world's greatest tracker.  Then Del Toro kills some  would be hunters and Jones is called in to find him.  There are other things going on here, but this is what the film is about.  The hunt, the father versus the son.  It's fun as it plays out.
The Hunted opens with a quote, or interpretation (I'm not sure which) from the bible and the story of Abraham via Johnny Cash.  Now Jones is not Del Toro's real father in the film.  He trained him though, and Del Toro saw him as a father figure.  For those not familiar, Abraham was asked by God to kill his son.  Now this is suppose to work as an allegory for the film, but I'm not really sure it does.  Almost nothing is explained in The Hunted.  It made me think of the film Basic, a film which told the audience everything, but showed nothing.  The Hunted is the opposite, it showed everything, but told us nothing.  It lends the key elements to the audience, just enough to keep us in the film, but it never elaborates.  I wanted more.  I wanted to know why things were happening.  Instead the plot is second to the action, nothing new in this genre, but the plot works like my description of it, which, if you go reread, is not enough.
In theory, more movies like The Hunted should get made.  The plot is simple, yet engaging, the acting is good, but not over the top, the action is intense, but not unrealistic, and the running time short.  Of course, William Friedkin has been around a while and knows what he is doing, but I think this film would have benefited from another thirty minutes of character development.  Friedkin says on one of the DVD extras that he wanted the film to be short.  Okay, I'm the last one to argue movies are too short these days, but this one should have been longer.  A sort of poor man's First Blood I'd say.  Nice effort, could have been more.",1061510400,,2066,4.276485788113695

1889387,2,B00009RDG9,"2 stars for a movie that stinks you ask? Well, yeah. I'll give one star to Benicio Del Toro for his appearance in this movie. It is not Del Toro's fault however, that whomever edited this picture must have left the best scenes on the cutting room floor. Or perhaps William Friedkin just doesn't know how to direct a movie of this calliber.
Tommy Lee Jones is ageing nicely, but after The Fugative and whatever that sequel was, it is more like seeing Clint Eastwood repriving the exact same role, except Clint is better. I really enjoyed Mr. Jones in Space Cowboys - so you see he can play a different role other than the ""I know everything about everything and you don't"" crap that he once again gets handed here.
The movie dares to bring up ""Combat Stress Disorder"" and that is about 1 minute of the movie. Why it was brought up in the first place is just an excuse for the movie.
For about the last 30 minutes of the movie there is the typical, but somewhat slow in this case, final chase scene. When the good and bad finally meet, it can't be over soon enough. In my version of the movie, Mr. Del Toro would have killed Mr. Jones and snuck away for perhaps a shot at the directors throat and maybe the editor(s) of the film as well. As is, I wasn't involved in the production so this is the studios way of ending such a fine flick:
Good guy gets stabbed and slashed until he's ready to start making a comeback, this reminded me a lot of WWF and Hulk Hogan, it was that bad! And, although Mr. Jones should have no blood in his body by now it doesn't seem to affect him for the rest of the movie. Remember just 5 minutes earlier? Apparently, if you can pull a stick/spear out of your leg, it will only bleed for 20-30 seconds at most, will not bleed in a river, and will be ready to walk on again in 1 minute.
I couldn't wait for this movie to end, ohhh the other star you ask? Simple enough, Connie Nielsen is drop dead gorgeous. Too bad she plays the dumb cop (not her fault) and has meaningless scenes to boot.
Final words about this movie - It's 15-20 minutes too long and it may have been written well, but it got shafted on the budget and so the movie is predictable and meaningless.",1060732800,,2190,4.216666666666667

The question is ""Will this 'predictable' movie entertain""?  YES!  William Friedkin knows how to pace his action movies and this one is no exception.  Tommy Lee Jones is his usual (read 'predictably') fine acting self and Benecio Del Toro gives further evidence that he is a major talent.  Both characters, co-participants in a deadly and bloody 'hunt/hunter' tale, are well developed, nuanced, and terrific to watch.

1889391,2,B00009RDG9,"William Friedkin was one of the most talented directors in modern American cinema. His Exorcist entered history as one of the sacriest films ever made, while films like the underrated To Live and Die in LA and the classic French Connection sealed his reputation as a talented artist who can craft good entertaining films. So a new film by Friedkin requires attention! How disappointed I was therefore with Hunted, expecting a thrill ride, and getting an average over stretched story that is closer to a TV movie, than a film done by and starring Hollywood's best.
First of all the film is not original..The cat and mouse chase in the woods, the war hero that flipped, it reminded me a lot of First Blood, but this is not the problem. Originality is not synonymous with creativity. A remade film or plot with the right  filmmakers can become a classic. It is rather the whole plot and direction that I found lacking creativity in Hunted.
The opening scenes in Kossovo have a 'studio' feel to them, and look staged, while Tommy Lee Jones's character is underdevelopped and 'cliche'd'.
While the actors in the film are the best in the business, especially Jones and Del Toro, they do look uncomfortable in their roles and uninspired.
Overall Hunted can be watched on cable at most, but certainly it is not 'movie library' material, which is sad given the name Friedkin attached to it.",1059264000,5,1381,4.754166666666666

Del Toro plays a ""Black Op's"" type of military specialist, who (it later transpires) was an A student of civilian instructor Tommy Lee Jones, in the deadly art of assassination among other things. Without giving too much away, Del Toro (constantly haunted by his military past) appears to have gone off the deep end, and all suspicions point to his involvement in some brutal murders. This is a cue for Tommy Lee to be dragged from retirement as the ""only man"" who can find him, and ultimately hunt him down. I don't think it's too much to say that the opening sequences in this movie are harrowing, and the whole subject matter is more than a little disturbing, and please - this movie is NOT for kids, even younger teenagers. The hunter/hunted action makes up the bulk of the film, and one can't help drawing comparisons with movies like US Marshals, and The Fugitive, but this is very different, and I believe much better. Del Toro is not a ""good guy"" being persecuted and chased wrongly, and we aren't looking for a conspiracy theory or gang of corrupt politicians to blame, and this adds much more believability and tension to the plot. Jones is very good in this ""non governmental"" role and is very believable in his demonstrated expertise, but Del Toro is the real star of the picture in my mind. He is cold, calm and brooding, killing without fear or conscience, whilst still fighting his inner demons. Direction is slick and inventive, and the locations used are breathtaking.
