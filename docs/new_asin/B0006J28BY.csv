8041769,5,B0006J28BY,"One of favourite movies of all time. Great cameos, too. The story is one I think too rarely heard of in the gay community, or even in the world in general. In the world, people speak of having found God or of not having found God but not many speak of the active search for it, and questioning God, only the darkness from not having found God. This story is so poignant and heartfelt and true of so many gay people that I know. Indeed, if this movie had had more press within the gay community, more would understand how good a movie it is. Especially beautiful is the scene during the closing credits. I couldn't think of a more beautiful close this movie.",1372204800,,657,4.306451612903226
8041770,1,B0006J28BY,"Other reviews gave this movie a thumbs down but I was sure they were wrong.  Well, they weren't.  I wanted to see Leslie Jordan in action.  The plot and script are very lacking.  Bad jokes, bad ideas, bad news.  I guess you can tell, I didn't like this movie.  I thought it had promise, but I think the 5 star reviewers must have been paid off or something.",1366848000,,357,4.176470588235294

8041772,5,B0006J28BY,"It is sometimes difficult to find clarity and redemption or even a god in your life when you're completely drug-addled. Leslie Jordan captures this milieu in 1970's Atlanta, with all its dangers, perfectly. It's the most accurate depiction of floundering stoned on uppers, downers, coke or heroin, from one day to the next that I can recall seeing. Leslie's comic adventures with his best female friend, a debauched coke-snorting ex-debutante and current stripper (Erin Chandler), are followed by his raw love for the ultimate ill-fated ""bad boy"" (Mark Pellegrino), which is especially heart-wrenching, and concludes with a near-death experience, leading to a sadder but wiser chance of survival.",1338336000,,696,5.453703703703703
8041773,4,B0006J28BY,"After seeing Leslie Jordan in ""Sordid Lives"" I looked forward to watching his other films. I borrowed a copy of Lost in the Pershing Point Hotel and saw a different side of Jordan.

In Sordid Lives, Jordan played the campy cross dresser Brother Boy. The part was over the top and very memorable. Lost in the Pershing Point Hotel is also campy, but it is a much grittier film. LPPH concerns a 38-year-old gay man (Jordan) in the 1970s. He decides that he can no longer stand to live in his parents' home in a small southern town, so he moves to Atlanta to ""find himself."" In Atlanta, he lives at the seedy Pershing Point Hotel.

The story is all about the bizarre characters Jordan encounters in Atlanta. There is a drug addicted heiress, who befriends and then betrays Jordan. There is also a heroin-addicted pimp who hooks street kids in order to lure them into prostitution. (Bizarrely, the pimp becomes Jordan's love interest). Jordan also has a strange relationship with his cellmate after he is arrested for drug possession.

LPPH is not a perfect film. The film is a strange mixture of camp comedy and stark truths about the difficulties in our lives. The filmmakers aren't always entirely successful at managing these two very different moods. The DVD that I watched was of very poor quality. The sound was so bad that I had difficulty hearing it (there are no captions) and the picture ""froze up"" so many times that I finished watching the film on my laptop.

Film fans who want to see something different should find a copy of Lost in the Pershing Point Hotel.",1258761600,,1569,4.633093525179856
8041774,4,B0006J28BY,"A brave movie about the only two things which should matter--acceptance and faith. Yet these are lost early in life crowded out by junk--the junk of fractured families, the junk of sexuality, the junk of junk. The attempt at reclamation, of course, is farcical as Mardi-Gras carnies try for salvation from their wrecked temples of promiscuity and addiction and cruelty.",1254700800,,369,5.166666666666667
8041775,3,B0006J28BY,"I think this was supposed to be autobiographical but it was very hard to follow.  It had it's funny moments and it's poignant moments and if you are a fan of his, it is probably worth watching.  It is mostly a slice of life thing, though, so do not expect any redemption or resolution.",1184198400,3,285,4.2592592592592595
8041776,3,B0006J28BY,"Leslie Jordan, the talented pint-sized actor who makes frequent hilarious guest spots on ""Will & Grace,"" wrote this autographical tale which was formally produced as an off-Broadway play. How much of it is true-to-life would be interesting to know but suffice to say, he was come a long way since the depressing drug-hazed disco 70s in which most of the action takes place.

The film starts out with The Storyteller (Jordan) being loaded into an ambulance and then telling his story to the Almighty in an all-white purgatory. Beginning with some quite hilarious scenes of his childhood, in which he shocks his religious fanatical parents with his confessions of being gay, he lives with them until his late 30s and then flees to Atlanta, the ""gay mecca"" that he has read about in magazines. Arriving at the seedy Pershing Point Hotel, he immediately makes friends with an ostracized debutante whom he christens ""Miss Make-Do."" Miss Make-Do (Erin Chandler in a terrific natural performance) is a drug addict who works as a go-go dancer and sometimes hooker to finance her drug habit.

Miss Make-Do and our hero eventually have a falling out and he then hooks up with a straight bad boy named Tripper (excellently played by Mark Pellegrino). Their platonic and depressing relationship, living in the dire straits of a basement, showcases some of the film's best writing and most earnest scenes. Back in purgatory, Jordan cuts loose with some penetrating comments on the nature of God and being gay.

Shot on a small budget, the film nevertheless sports a professional look and the cinematographer has diffused many of the 70s scenes with green and red hues that illustrate the seediness of the situation. The supporting players are as fine as the leading actors. John Ritter appears as a minister in one of the film's early scenes. Kathy Kinney has a brief but funny sequence in a doctor's waiting room and Sheryl Lee Ralph is hilarious as a holy-roller nurse.

An interesting film but not all that entertaining, fans of Leslie Jordan might want to take a look at it. Unfortuately there are no extras and a commentary by Jordan is really needed.",1113177600,10,2143,4.895316804407713
