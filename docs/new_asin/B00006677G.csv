7962046,5,B00006677G,"I wanted to find an edited version of that episode as it featured a random flashback to Bulma's flash in episode 3 (which nobody warned me about).  But the edited tape was more expensive, so I got this one as it was just that one scene I wanted to get rid of and I have no idea where Funimation would have stopped with the edits.  Bottom line, I am a satisfied customer.",1402272000,,370,4.125
