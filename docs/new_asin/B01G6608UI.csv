8762382,4,B01G6608UI,"Released in 1923, Haldane of the Secret Service was Houdini's last feature film and the second made for his own Houdini Picture Corporation. It is far from his best film. That would be the yet unreleased The Grim Game (1919).

Still, it's fascinating to see the real Harry Houdini in action, and the water wheel escape at the end is truly hair-raising. Houdini also shot on location during his last European tour, so it's fun to see action staged on the streets of London, Paris, and New York in the 1920s.

So not a great film by any stretch. But a fascinating artifact of film and magic history.",1464566400,,597,4.518518518518518
