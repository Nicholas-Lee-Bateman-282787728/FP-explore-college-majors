6105759,4,B00GS08Z9E,"Lucille Ball's third ratings busting decade on Televsion, Here's Lucy brings into the fold her real life kids, Lucie and Desi, Jr. When given a good script, the kids are spectacular! Lucille Ball has some more classic TV moments herself, and over all an entertaining show. Had this set been curated to include the 100 best episodes, it would seem the show was nearly as good as I Love Lucy and the Lucy Show; however, you are your own curator here, so be prepared for classic comedy sandwiched between some of the most draw dropping bad comedy in TV history. But forgive her those terrible 50 or so episodes, and remember that she had been doing weekly TV for over 20 years. With Here's Lucy, the great ones are so great and the terrible ones so terrible. It takes about 4 seasons for Lucy and Harry to develop a real, heart-warming chemistry, which pays off in several of the latter episodes. This is the only Lucy sitcom to have a ""final episode"", and it is clever and noteworthy. There are real comedy gems from each season!",1479340800,3,1027,4.526881720430108
6105760,5,B00GS08Z9E,This is a favorite of mine as well as my daughter's. We love watching this show. This is one of our favorites. Lucille Ball is so funny. We are pleased with these DVD's.,1474156800,,169,4.151515151515151

6105781,1,B00GS08Z9E,"When the Lucy character stopped being clever, when there was no Ricky, and when her voice became deep Lucy Ricardo disappeared and became a caricature of what she once was. Its wonderful that she gave so much pleasure to so many people but Lucille Ball should have ended ""Lucy"" when Viv decided to leave ""The Lucy Show."" Perhaps then she could have played another character successfully instead of always going back to ""Lucy"". There is a history of characters and shows that stayed on the air too long . In addition to Lucy there were Archie Bunker , Samantha Stevens, and even Hawkeye Pierce ( I stopped liking MASH when it became a drama)  among others. Its a shame there weren't more examples like Mary Richards whose show ended when it was still fresh and funny",1430179200,4,765,4.625
6105782,5,B00GS08Z9E,Ok... if you like vintage shows & you LOVE LUCY this is the set for you. Awesome picture and sound has to be turned up a little. Worth every penny for the days when life was beautiful! A must!!!,1429142400,6,194,4.0

OK... you also have Gale Gordon, one of the all time greats and Desi Jr. Throw in a bevy of the biggest Stars of the time guest hosting, this was a wonderful series filled with laughter, music, dancing and more laughter. This was when TV was entertaining and Show Business was fun.",1428537600,6,330,4.253968253968254
6105785,5,B00GS08Z9E,A very funny series with multiple great guest stars!  The main cast along with the guest stars make the show.,1427760000,2,109,4.45
6105786,1,B00GS08Z9E,"Sorry to the other fans of Lucy, but I have to call it as I see it.  Most of these episodes were poorly written and tedious.  Everyone shouted their lines, overacted, and Lucy kept looking at cue cards as she opted to stop memorizing her lines by this time.  She should have went out on top with I Love Lucy.  The first couple of seasons of The Lucy Show were tolerable, as the chemistry between Lucy and Vivian was always great.",1423872000,10,429,4.2592592592592595

6105792,5,B00GS08Z9E,"another classic series by a classic team.  not quite as good as I Love Lucy, but certainly better than The Lucy Show which seemed to have no consistency with regard to plotlines, cast, setting, backstory, locations, or just about anything else over its six year run.",1405209600,2,266,4.782608695652174
6105793,5,B00GS08Z9E,This is a must collection if you are a Lucille Ball Fan. It's great to see Lucille's kids in this show.,1403568000,2,103,3.9523809523809526
6105794,5,B00GS08Z9E,"Everyone loves Lucille Ball! ""Here's Lucy"" may not have been as successful in syndication and on cable television as ""I Love Lucy"" or ""The Lucy Show', but it continued Lucille Ball's Monday night's dominance as the #1 show on network TV. For it's first four years the series was a Top 10 Nielsen champ with the 3rd year (1970-1971) coming in at #3 overall and #1 as the highest-rated show on CBS even beating out ""All in the Family"".

 The highlights of the show were it's plethora of guest-stars who made appearances including Liberace, Carol Burnett, Eva Gabor, and Liz Taylor and Richard Burton in a classic episode from season 3 when Lucy puts on one of Liz's diamond rings by accident.  That episode was the highest-rated in the show's run and even made the cover of TV Guide that week.

 A great deal, a great show and the greatest lady of TV comedy!",1388102400,17,856,4.532467532467533

This ones a flop  sent back
Only watched  one and it was stopping and going tho whole cd  and NOT a funny cd like the Lucy's I have

Kids were terrible at acting
Not the same without the regular cast",1518825600,,223,3.782608695652174

8626569,5,B00GS08Z9E,"Lucy had many different shows in her years as a gifted comedic artist. For some reason it is the Here's Lucy show that she appeared the most real and endearing to me as an autistic child growing up. My grandmother who raised me was an office worker raising kids as was Lucy in this series. Lucy was kind to a fault and a loving mom. Lucy had the same problems my grandmother had raising kids and balancing a job. Mr. Mooney was a kind lovable but stern boss at Carter's Unique Employment Agency. The Carter's Unique Employment Agency found talent for unusual stunt needs giving Lucy reason to share her physical comedic genius. Lucy was a perfectionist and loved physical comedy but she was getting older here and it showed a little. Lucy was still a gem here but anyone who remembers I love Lucy see's the difference. Age was mellowing the first lady of comedy but Lucille Ball still ruled! It's funny I did not even have to watch the shows to know the name of the agency after almost 50 years since seeing a Here's Lucy episode.

The video quality is good. The color is good. The sound is good. Now I listen to the DVD on a Denon Stereo with 7.1 surround sound so its hard to sound truly bad on such a system. I watch on a 65 inch screen so video defects and artifacts become obvious if there are any.  There were no video issues so bad it took away from the pure viewing pleasure of seeing my gal pal Lucille Ball on screen after such a long time parted. For me this was Lucille Ball at her most real. Maybe Here's Lucy will always mean more to me because; it was around this time that I realized my mom who died would never be back. I Loved Lucy, I always Loved Lucy and this Here's Lucy Show cemented the relationship.",1511481600,3,1723,4.282208588957055

Many hours of entertainment and laughs and at a great price too. You can't go wrong with this complete series of ""Here's Lucy"".",1504569600,,264,4.638297872340425

8626573,1,B00GS08Z9E,The worst lucy series The lucy show was a hundred times better and this series cost 3 times as much as the lucy show.,1501286400,,117,3.9166666666666665
8626574,5,B00GS08Z9E,Great TV show.  Lucy knew how a show is to be.  I often read Desi Arnaz is not in this but I can say this.  It is definitely great. Her children are superb. Gale Gordon is wonderful as a boss.,1497052800,,192,3.75
