I found this very disappointing considering the cost.  You can find much better stuff on YouTube and it's free.",1424131200,2,266,4.739130434782608
8583211,5,B00CLX0OD2,"I didn't mean to watch this video all the way through but I did. I don't do face painting but decided to take a peak at this video anyway. What a gem. The teaching was clear and the camera was right where it should be. There was a nice little surprise at the end with many inspirational ideas. Even though I don't face paint for a living, I'd do this at a birthday party for sure. Thanks!",1400284800,,388,4.0519480519480515
