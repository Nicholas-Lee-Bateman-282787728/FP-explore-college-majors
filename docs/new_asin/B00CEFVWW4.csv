Scripting which was blocky and poorly constructed.  Had an impulse to turn off 20 minutes into the movie, wish I had.",1378512000,2,293,5.041666666666667

5718625,5,B00CEFVWW4,"This is a very well made film.  I've always been fascinated with the story of Templar Knights, and I try to watch films about them when they are released. The acting, the story, and especially the music all really stand out.  Eric Estrada plays his role very well.  Richard Dutcher and Joseph James are great, and are very believable in their roles.  The film is an exciting action adventure movie, like Raiders Of The Lost Ark, Goonies, and National Treasure.  It's on a much smaller scale obviously, but they still managed to pull off something great.  The CGI in two of the scenes needed to be cleaned up a little but the rest of it was great.  The music is exciting, emotional and very memorable.  The cinematography and the music are amazing for an independent movie.  If you are a fan of great action adventure movies, see this film and you won't be disappointed.",1375228800,4,869,4.590909090909091
5718626,5,B00CEFVWW4,"Templar Nation is an exciting film with great plot twists and plenty of action. The history of the Knights Templar is fascinating and this film adds element from history and lore into a current setting. I thought that the characters were deep enough to feel real and the plot, despite it's esoteric theme is rather good. There is enough action to keep the movie going while the puzzles and questions surrounding the Templar clues keep the audience guessing all the way until the very end. It is definitely worth the price to get a family friendly, action packed, fun movie that can be enjoyed many times.",1375228800,5,604,4.7075471698113205
5718627,5,B00CEFVWW4,"If you liked National Treasure or Raiders of the Lost Ark, you will love this movie.  The history of the Knights Templar is veiled in secrecy.

It is possible those deleted scenes were redundant, of course, in the mind of some editor, OR for Amazon's purpose.  This strikes me as possibly a 'mini-series' that was VERY abbreviated.  Too bad.  It was ""just getting interesting"", IE: I was interested in the connection between Templars and The Anasazi ... so little is known of the Anasazi, and of course I have not formally studied either group of people - less so the Anasazi than the Templars.  I do read a great deal, and the subject of Templars and Masons has been exhaustively explored (with no 'real' answers). ..

LAME! This movie has terrible acting, cinematography, and basically not enough talent to make the plot feel credible. I feel like you have to make the movie your resources allow. This movie tried to take it further then it could afford.",1386633600,,398,4.391891891891892
5718724,1,B00CEFVWW4,"This is a story for those who like conspiracy theories. The Nicolas Cage version was slightly better. In this film Alfred (Erik Estrada) who has ""knowledge of many things"" gets killed by a man of a secret order. We know the order is secret because the man wears a hooded robe with a triple cross on it. His friend William (Richard Dutcher) leads a dig in the desert which leads to a remarkable find, one you might be able to figure out from the title. While the killing is a mystery, those of us who spent their childhood watching Shaggy figure things out, should have no problem with a single suspect killing.

The skull prop was fake looking. I haven't seen teeth that white when bleached. The plot has hokey. The dialogue was a joke. The acting was extremely bad. Paul Pugmire couldn't deliver a line, and David Matochief Anderson didn't know what to do with his ridiculous lines. They plan on doing a sequel unless we can quickly repeal the first amendment and stop them.

It is overrated at PG-13 too. If you liked this film, many in this group also were part of ""The Masonic Map"" (2011) written by Joseph James who horribly played Robert in this film. James is 32 degree Mason and level 18 Wizard. This seems to be part of a group of films coming out of Salt Lake City.",1386460800,7,1275,4.421276595744681

Like its predecessor, ""the Masonic Map"" the story was interesting and numerous viewings reveal details that go unnoticed the first time through.  I originally purchased a digital download of TN for viewing while awaiting delivery of the first in the ""trilogy"" : ""the Masonic Map"".  Like the latter, TN ventures into unfamiliar territory in the history of the original Order, but one that has been hinted at in the researches on the Newport Tower, the Westford Knight, the ""hooked cross"" and other, pop researchers. Perhaps a grain of truth may be found?  Regardless, the movie is a fun ride that improves with each viewing.  Give it a chance, it might just surprise you.",1380844800,2,798,5.107692307692307

The halting delivery of the lame dialog set the stage for various characters' omniscient replies to other characters' (should have been) surprising revelations and the predictable ""discovery"" that was made by sticking a sword in a stone (that's original). Naturally, if you stick a sword - any sword, regardless of length - into a hole (which hasn't gathered any dust or debris in the past 700 years), it will reflect the sun's light directly where you need to find the next clue, no matter what time of day you stick it or in what season. I'm sorry, it's just difficult to find anything positive to say about this film. Oh - here it is: I'm positive I've seen better special effects in an elementary school's Fall Festival skit.
