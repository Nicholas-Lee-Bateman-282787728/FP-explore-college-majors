8135579,5,B000H0M47U,"Teeny-Tiny was my brother's favorite book growing up. Now it is out of print and hard to find. I wanted to get a copy for my son who loves witches and scary stuff. He loves this DVD. We have watched it a million times and he always talks about the scary witch woman. Oh and yes, she is scary, very scary, the way a witch woman should be. If your child is sensitive to scary things and doesn't like Hansel and Gretel than this movie is not for them.",1385164800,,448,4.044943820224719
8135580,5,B000H0M47U,"Used to borrow this on VHS (over and over again) at the Pacific Beach library. My then 5 and 7 year olds just couldn't get enough of it! Now that I found it here on DVD format those same kids, now 18 and 20, have a running joke between them, going around iwith creepy voices, saying: YOU STOLE MY MAGIC OBJECTSSSSS. Lol. Totally priceless purchase!

Warning, not for the faint at heart. This is about a witch that tricks small children into her house and eats them, while making decorations, furniture and fences with the bones.

Several other great stories from other cultures on the DVD as well.",1363651200,,597,4.518518518518518
8135581,1,B000H0M47U,"My brother and I watched this movie when we were children, at a friend's house. He had nightmares for over a year about witches. It is a very creepy movie for little kids, and I bought it again recently to see what it was like now, and I couldn't believe it was for kids, or that we were ever allowed to watch it. I am not surprised my brother had nightmares.",1360972800,,359,4.070422535211268
8135582,5,B000H0M47U,My kids ages 10 and 6 LOVE this video--especially my six yr old son.  We borrowed this from our local library months ago and my son recites the Teeny-tiny and the Witch Woman story all the time.  I finally decided to order our own copy and he is thrilled!  It is the sweetest video.  Very good story telling.  I highly recommend this great video for your family.,1198281600,3,362,4.343283582089552
