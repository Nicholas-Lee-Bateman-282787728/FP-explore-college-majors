8417302,5,B0046HCONE,"Other reviewers have already commented on the wonderful quality of this performance, and there is no need for me to add to these comments.  On the minus side, I agree that the lack of subtitles is unfortunate, to say the least.  One other minus that I haven't seen commented on is the lighting:  there is a bunch of blue spotlights pointed down from the ceiling, with the result that some of the performers have blue faces.  This is particularly annoying in the case of Waldemar himself.",1312761600,9,487,4.627906976744186
8417303,5,B0046HCONE,"This Gurrelieder's performance is really outstanding. It was recorded in october 2009 in Munich , and is funny to see, at the end two important conductors in the auditorium - Kent Nagano and K. Thielmann . Gurrelieder is a typical work of Schoenberg's first phase. One mix of Wagner, Mahler and Strauss. But the result is far from one simple ""imitation"". Gurrelieder is a masterwork ,and it uses the most large Orchestra ( largest than Mahler's eight )even used. The first part consists of alternate songs from the two lovers: Waldemar and Tove. Deborah Voigt is one splendid Tove , but the great surprise is the tenor Stig Andersen as Waldemar. I know only one recording of Andersen : Brahms Rinaldo. To me Andersen is diferent from one Heldentenor. He has force but he has too a lot of expression. The Wood Dove , Mihoko Fujimura , is perfect in every sense . I really never heard her aria so well done. The others soloists are very good too. The orchestra is simply  fantastic, as is the chorus . But the great star of this DVD is Maris Janssons. He isn't one specialist in the Vienna Second School. He conducts Gurrelieder in one romantic way, that is very good for the work. Jansons makes here one strong performance.
 This is one Gurrelieder to be seen, but principally to be heard.",1298419200,13,1288,4.595652173913043
8417304,3,B0046HCONE,"Live performances of Gurrelieder are rare.  This DVD is a record of a live performance.  It must have been a memorable day for those present at this performance.  The DVD captures a very good performance of this work in good sound and image.  However, this is not an English-friendly DVD.  Yes, it has English essays in the booklet, but no subtitles.  To produce a DVD of a major choral or operatic work without subtitles is to not exploit the capability of the medium.  It significantly diminished my enjoyment of the performance.  And the performance is not available on Blu Ray.  Wait until a great performance of this work is available on Blu Ray, with English subtitles.",1296086400,25,675,4.75
