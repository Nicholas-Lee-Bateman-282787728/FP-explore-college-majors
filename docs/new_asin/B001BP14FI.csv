Unfortunately, there is no Japanese language option. My 9-year old loves watching Pokemon every Saturday morning at 9:00 AM, so I thought I'd buy her the DVDs and let her hear the dialog in the original Japanese. The only language on the discs is English. She enjoys the cartoons nonetheless, so it's not a total loss.

If I'd have known this were the case, I probably would have gotten her something else. For now she'll have to stick with Tonari no Yamada-kun (My Neighbors, the Yamadas), Tonari no Totoro, and Howl's Moving Castle for her Japanese language fix.",1233532800,2,771,5.015625

3496811,5,B001BP14FI,"Disclaimer: This review contains potential spoilers.

I was pleasantly surprised with the B&W series - characters, story, and the new theme songs.  For those who haven't seen the series yet, B&W takes place in the Unova Region, which is inspired by New York City.  (Junichi Masuda, game director for the Pok&eacute;mon series, confirmed this bit of historical trivia in various interviews).

I should note that I have a vested interest in B&W since I'm a New Yorker.  I had pretty high expectations for the series going in, and at the end of the first 12 episodes, I was very satisfied. Ash, Iris, and Cilan meaningfully embody the melting pot for which NYC is famous. As New York is the epitome of heterogeneity, it pleased me immensely that the heroes of the series reflected that diversity.  Other than that, I'm glad that the time-honored themes that has carried this series so far still feature at the heart of each episode (especially with respect to friendship and striving towards a goal).

As for the DVDs themselves - the packaging is simple, and there are no special paper inserts and no bonus features on the discs.  But honestly, for the price, having the episodes alone is worth every penny.  And of course, it's terrific that I now own a small piece of Pok&eacute;History with Pok&eacute;mon's monumental foray into a region inspired by NYC.",1395273600,,1356,4.860869565217391

3496815,3,B001BP14FI,"I purchased this set in an attempt to get back into the Pokemon anime series, however I was not very impressed.

For starters, Ash's current voice actor is not the best. His old voice actress Veronica Taylor was the only Ash for me. I'm sure some old time Pokemon fans would agree with this statement as well. Sarah Natochenny has been Ash for 8 years now and I still don't fully like her, however I will say that she has adapted to Ash's voice much better than she was sounding in Battle Frontier. She has improved and I do not totally dislike her as Ash- but Veronica Taylor was, is and always will be my Ash Ketchum. No questions asked.

The other voice actors were alright, I guess. Some of the 1-episode characters voices were pretty annoying though. Specifically looking at Episode 5 on Disc 1. I do feel like all of the characters sound more childish than they used to in the old 4Kids dub, maybe it is just me being a nostalgia nerd.

The episodes themselves are decent at best. The first two episodes involving Ash getting his fourth gym badge and helping out Bianca with her father in the gym were both somewhat enjoyable episodes for me. The third episode had a rough start but an alright second half/ending part. The fourth episode was all about Ash and Trip meeting the Unova Champion Alder. Alder's humor and attitude made the episode very, very enjoyable and funny. Episode 5 with the Maractus was another lame episode. -- A good amount of these episodes are totally hit-or-miss for me, which kind of sucks. At least the old filler episodes were pretty enjoyable for the most part... or at least as enjoyable as a filler episode is gonna get when it comes to Pokemon anime.

This set contains 2 discs in a regular plastic recyclable DVD case, nothing special. Not a single extra feature or bonus card, etc. - No paper insert advertisements are present either. Overall, you will receive 2 discs featuring the first 12 episodes of Season 15 and that is it. Nothing more, nothing less, sadly.

This is a good release for young children and new fans of the Pokemon anime franchise because it contains a fair amount of episodes for a great price. It is also clearly aimed mostly at the younger children and fans, as that is the Pokemon series prime demographic, not old-time Nostalgia nerds like myself.

I will probably still continue to buy these sets for the gym battle episodes and in the hopes that more episodes keep my interest. 3/5 for this box set due to voice acting and some boring episodes.",1393286400,4,2512,4.571111111111111

3496826,5,B001BP14FI,My kids love anything with Pokeman.  They have watched this movie over and over.  the Black & White series is a new favorite.  Arrived when expected,1366848000,,148,4.615384615384615
3496827,4,B001BP14FI,"It's kind of obvious that Unova saga is my favorite (mainly because I'm one of the few people that hate Misty and thought Brock needed to go.) Set in a far region away from ""Japan"", Ash is now in ""America""...

...Which means losing his brain cells again with forgetting the basics. In this season, Team Rocket has suddenly become competent (actually this was built up for people who were paying attention to the Diamond and Pearl arc. After taking credit for the fall of Team Magna, Aqua and Galactic, Team Rocket got promoted and not wanting to disappoint their boss leave their cute/comedic Pokemon behind to get serious.) As luck would have it, Pikachu is zapped by Zekrom (the black dragon) and loses his electricity. Ash doesn't realize that until he battles his new (unappreciated) rival Trip (who chooses Snivy like the majority of the fanbase did when Black/White came out because he was cool while Ash had the reaction of the fanbase that saw Oshawott for what it was and ends up taking Oshawott with Juniper's approval.)

From there, Ash meets Iris and then later Cilan and the trio form the group similar to the Kanto group and travel Unova only all have a goal in mind.

If you can survive the first 12 episodes, then you'll be pleased with the quality episodes coming afterward. In fact, the quality of the Unova arc is very good until the Unova League (where it's at its worse) and then it picks up again with the N arc.

Personally, I find Iris and Cilan being part of the group as refreshing. With too girly and annoying female characters -cough- DAWN -cough cough- and characters that needed to go because their jokes were boring and repetitive...(Brock) While Iris is annoying with her ""Just a kid"" comment repeated once or twice per episode, its to be noted how this statement is meant to be filled with hypocrisy as her rival Georgia will point out multiple times. Iris does suffer from an inferiority superiority complex and has to insult Ash to make herself feel better when she's not that good at being a trainer (at first). She has ways to go before she ends up like her game counterpart. Cilan is my new favorite being fabulous and a wonderful trainer unlike Brock who always lost. -_-

Ash builds his team relatively quickly this season similar to season 1 and the mistakes he makes aren't as noticeable in this season as did the DP saga (losing to the first gym anyone?) Ash overall in this season while more excited (given he's in Unova) is noted to be MUCH calmer in threatening situations as well as handling Trip way better than his previous two rivals. (He doesn't get too upset for losing against Trip and makes it obvious that his goal is to open Trip up instead of hating like Paul or trying to be better like Gary.)

The worse part of the season is obviously the voice actors mainly Ash again (I want his old voice back). Also, I don't like how this doesn't have dual audio for Japanese. To watch the better version, just go online because the Japanese version actually isn't being taken offline for once.",1362614400,,3041,4.601476014760148

3496831,4,B001BP14FI,"Pokemon Black and White is the 14th season of the long running series. After traveling through the Sinnoh region, Ash and Pikachu fly to the all new Unova region where new Pokemon await them. Along the way, Ash meets new friends like Iris and Cilan who accompany him on his new journey. In this first set Ash captures a few new Pokemon and even battles the first Unova region Gym Leader.
  Furthermore, the set contains the first 12 episodes from the new season. It contains two discs with six episodes on each one and unlike the early Diamon and Pearl Box Sets, both disc are placed in the same case. Also, both discs are placed in thier own tray instead of stuck right on top of each other like other double DVD sets. Although this set contains standard DVDs, they look AMAZING when played in a Blu-ray player. The picture is stunning as Pokemon battle and use thier attacks. Additionally, all the episodes are in the wide screen format that I enjoy.
  In conclusion, this set is packaged very well and allows for little storage space. The picture quality is spot on and robust. The episodes are good but many of them just aren't what Pokemon used to be. This new season is fit more for a young fan rather than an older on. Die hard Pokemon fans young and old should enjoy the set though. There are no special features but thats something to suspect from Pokemon releases anymore.

I am pleased that Viz wants to get the Unova sets out quickly. The picture quality is clear, and the sound is crisp. The set contains the episodes ""In the Shadow of Zekrom"" through ""Here Comes the Trubbish Squad."" If you are into Pok&eacute;mon or have young children, I recommend picking this set up.",1357603200,,430,4.455696202531645

We have not viewed the DVD's but they appear to be fine.-",1356566400,,127,3.923076923076923
3496838,5,B001BP14FI,"As the title states, this set contains the first 12 episodes of Pokemon B/W. Here is the list of the episodes -

1. In the Shadow of Zekrom
2. Enter Iris and Axew
3. A Sandile Gusher of Change
4. The Battle Club and Tepig's Choice
5. Triple Leaders, Team Threats
6. Dreams by the Yard Full
7. Snivy plays Hard to Catch
8. Saving Darmanitan from the Bell
9. The Bloom is on Axew
10. A Rival Battle for Club Champ
11. A Home for Dwebble
12. Here Comes the Trubbish Squad

The episodes are on 2 discs with 6 per disc. There are no extras on the discs, which isn't a surprise, since the set is so cheap. It would be nice to have some character profiles or something, but not really a big deal to me. The episodes are done in widescreen and look amazing.

Overall, a nice set for a really good price.

If they keep the releases at 12 episodes for each set, then there should be 4 sets for the 48 episodes of Pokemon B/W.",1355788800,13,915,4.038674033149171

8284031,5,B001BP14FI,"I loved BW.  To me is the second best season after the original.  The music,  the plot and the characters were great.  I enjoyed that Unova had its unique kinds of Pokemon and because of its isolation,  Pokemon from other regions were rare.  I also liked how they made Team Rocket more serious and that they were not present in every chapter.  Their work with the doctor gave you something to look for,  instead of having them randomly attack the heroes to steal Pikachu like in other seasons.  I enjoyed the male and female concept of the Pokemon and that the kids were constantly catching New Pokemon,  which is one of the attractives of the anime.  I am really disappointed at XY,  which followed BW for that reason,  they rarely catch Pokemon.",1496620800,,747,4.568181818181818
