771045,2,6304030894,"The tagline to this film's advertisement boasts ""Real as the Screaming Headlines! True as the Bullets that Wrote Them!"" These lines promise more that the film can fulfill. In this ""true crime"" drama, the actual St. Louis policemen involved in the ""Great St. Louis Bank Robbery"" played the same roles they did on that fateful day, when three desperate men (plus the getaway driver) attempted the broad-daylight robbery of the Southwest Bank. A young Steve McQueen, very early in his film career, is George Fowler, the youngest of the hold-up men. His relationship with a partner's sister stood to endanger the whole plan, and hardened criminal John Egan (Crahan Denton) must make sure everything goes as planned. This created a tension between the men that may derail the job. This all sounds better than what is actually in the film. The low budget black & white look of the film can't even muster a semi-documentary feel to the ""true-life"" events. The actors all gave lackluster performances, either overplaying, underplaying, or just not playing. The addition of the ""real-life"" policemen added nothing to the proceedings: anyone could have portrayed them, for all the importance they play in the film. If anything, they may have posed the question of whether or not the situation was handled properly. McQueen is the only saving grace, playing George as a young man caught up in events beyond his control. McQueen worked hard, giving George a shot of teenage angst so popular at the time, and displayed a hint of the acting prowess that would serve him well in the better films to come. All in all, a ""caper"" film that, at once, seems very short (88 minutes), and too long.",973987200,4,1676,4.88421052631579

771354,4,6304030894,"This is a well-made and absorbing story based on a real-life bank robbery. In one of his earliest roles, Steve McQueen joins a group of crooks to participate in a carefully planned bank robbery. McQueen's girlfriend (played by Mollie McCarthy) tries to talk sense into him, but he rationalizes that he's not really a criminal like the others; he is ""only"" expected to drive the getaway car, rather than participate in any gun-wielding. (What's the harm in simply driving a car and getting several thousand dollar's for one day's work, right?)

The gang leader plans the robbery down to every detail. He estimates how long it will take to hold up the bank and how long they will have to get away before the police arrive, allowing for variables in traffic. He assigns roles to each member, coordinating every possible detail. There is no way this can fail, right?

Another member of the gang (played by David Clarke) had recently completed a hellish prison term and is scared to death to ever face prison again, but he is so confident this heist will go off successfully he goes along with it also. (Hey; if criminals were smart, they wouldn't be criminals.)

It becomes clear when you see this fact-based movie that an armed robbery is very difficult to pull off successfully no matter how carefully it's planned. Anyone found participating in an armed robbery is risking a high possibility of either a long prison term or of getting shot dead by the police. (When a robber is seen brandishing a gun, police in real life do NOT necessarily warn him or say ""drop your gun""; they often will just shoot him immediately with no warning. Being as this is a fact-based movie, you won't see too many Hollywood crime movie clichs.)

As expected, Steve McQueen is excellent in this film, but there are good performances from the entire cast.

""The St. Louis bank Robbery"" is in the public domain. As with most public domain movies, this film is available from a variety of different companies and the picture and sound quality may vary greatly between one company's edition and another's. The version of ""The St. Louis bank Robbery"" I saw was on a disc manufactured by a company called ""Dollar DVD"". Despite the low retail price of $1, the picture and sound quality on this particular edition was very good throughout, and the picture was correctly letterboxed in its original aspect ratio.",1429401600,,2381,4.769417475728155

THE GREAT ST. LOUIS BANK ROBBERY is easily one of my favorite public domain films. It's a noirish 'B' unit semi-documentary headlined by an up-and-comer who already had star power.

Young Steve McQueen is featured in this taut little true story of a heist gone terribly wrong. Shot on-location where these events actually unfolded, a mostly unknown cast includes non-actors: bank personnel, citizens and law enforcement responders who were involved on the day this hold-up occurred. The first hour of the story includes (sometimes unnecessary) character development, the balance is the actual crime.

McQueen portrays an expelled college athlete who throws in as wheel man for three ex-cons planning a bank caper. Events however propel him inside Southwest Bank, as what should've been a fairly simple robbery becomes a frightening siege. Recommended for all classic era crime movie fans.

771531,2,6304030894,"There are two reasons to see this film - a young, pre-famous Steve McQueen and the step back in to 1950's with all the great classic cars.
This was one of McQueen's first film roles and definitely not on his best films list. It's interesting to watch McQueen in his last 20's knowing that superstardom was a few short years away. THE GREAT ST. LOUIS BANK ROBBERY is based on a true story and features the actual locations and some of the real policemen surrounding the heist. Knowing that, the film is bland and relatively slow paced. We don't know much about the bank robbers and their relationships as they plan their heist.
McQueen is the star of the film and a young man recruited to drive the getaway car. Although he's not eager to break the law, he sees this as a way to get back on track with his life. Finally, when the actual heist begins do we begin to see some action and excitement in this film. McQueen's youthful and raw talent slowly begins to emerge near the end of the film.
The quality of the print is tolerable but not great. The film looks dark and menacing which adds a bit to the story. Men were still wearing long coats and hats in the 50's so the step back in time is interesting. Basically, I could only recommend this film to a Steve McQueen fan wanting to see the beginnings of the King of Cool.",1343001600,,1323,4.317269076305221
771532,4,6304030894,"""The St. Louis Bank Robbery"" (sometimes seen as ""The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery"") is a cheap black and white crime drama set in 1950s St. Louis, starring an extremely young Steve McQueen, who here foreshadows his greatness to come. The film opens with a title card reading ""This story is based on a true incident. Men of the Saint Louis Police Department play the same parts as they did in the actual crime."" Having lived in the St. Louis suburbs for three years, it was interesting for me to see the old buildings and roads that are, of course, now either completely gone or radically changed.

McQueen plays George Fowler, a bright collegiate young man hired to be the driver in a huge bank heist. He is recruited by Gino (David Clarke) an old friend, who also brings the love interest, Ann (Molly McCarthy,) into the mix complicating everything. I liked the way the film progressed, getting George further and further entangled in the criminal enterprise, and making it clear that crime was an ugly but seductive path. Some of the intrapersonal conflict is melodramatic, and the excessive time and dialogue during the robbery of the Southwest Bank distract from an otherwise very good effort. McQueen acquits himself well as does most of the supporting cast, especially the cold-blooded John Egan (Crahan Denton,) who is as unseemly as they come without resorting to the vulgarity or pointless sadistic violence found in most contemporary crime films.

Refreshingly, the robbery goes wildly awry, and leads to a self-revelatory breakdown for McQueen, who is in way deeper than he ever imagined he would be. The moral is clearly that crime doesn't pay, and the film works tirelessly and effectively toward that goal. Overall ""The St. Louis Bank Robbery"" is a good example of 1950s crime drama, and is grounded in reality far more than most crime films. Although it's occasionally a bit slow, as it devolves to bedlam and failure it makes the point that no matter how easy you think it is to get out of a criminal life once you start, the reality is quite different (a theme that became even more popular in recent years.) For an early look at Steve McQueen and a fascinating look into the midcentury crime genre, I recommend ""The St. Louis Bank Robbery"" without hesitation.",1342656000,,2277,4.820971867007673
771533,3,6304030894,"Steve McQueen (1930-1980) rose to stardom in the 1960's and became of the biggest action stars of the era, appearing in such films as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Thomas-Crown-Affair/dp/B0009HKH6Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Thomas Crown Affair</a>&nbsp;(1968),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Papillon/dp/B004KWVDWI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Papillon</a>&nbsp;(1973),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Getaway/dp/B000MV90J4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Getaway</a>&nbsp;(1972), and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bullitt/dp/B000MV90IU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bullitt</a>&nbsp;(1968), McQueen's trademark style earned him the nickname, ""the king of cool"".

While starring in the TV western series Wanted Dead or Alive (1958-61), McQueen was also attempting to launch his film career.  After a starring role in science fiction thriller, The Blob (1958), McQueen's next film role was in The Saint Louis Bank Robbery (1959), a drama based on real life events, involving a group planning to hold up a bank.  For those who may become disturbed by the discussion of the details of a movie over fifty years old, be advised that some mild spoilers follow.

McQueen is George Fowler, an ex-serviceman looking to get ahead by participating in his first crime.  Fowler is brought into the job by his friend Gino (David Clarke), and is slated to act as wheelman for a group led by John Egan (Crahan Denton).  Egan's plan involves intensive scouting at the Southwest Bank, and putting the team through a series of dry runs, before the actual robbery.

Things become more complicated for Fowler, after he contacts his ex-girlfriend Ann (Molly McCarthy).  She is Gino's younger sister, and becomes concerned that George and her brother may be involved in something that will lead to disaster.  Egan and others in the gang have doubts about George, and these concerns rise to a critical level, after a rash act by Ann, causes a change in their plans.

Crime seldom pays, particularly in this era of moviemaking, so as you might expect, things do not turn out roses for the robbers.  Things go bad, and the gang is trapped inside the bank with a number of hostages.  Hopefully the police procedures seen in the film, which appear to put the safety of the hostages at risk, were not actually standard practice.

The movie does a solid job of showing the gang casing the bank, and planning out the robbery.  The romance between George and Ann adds some color and emotion to a film that otherwise seems short on warmth.  Although McQueen ends the film crawling on his belly, he displays some flashes of the qualities that would later make him a star.  Led by Molly McCarthy and Crahan Denton, the performances of the supporting cast are quite good in this slightly better than average crime adventure.",1341100800,,2972,6.04047619047619
771534,3,6304030894,"Not a particularly bad film, just not particularly good either.  It's a bit like watching The Sopranos.  You can start counting the bad decisions made by the criminals from the moment the first frame hits the screen, so the film has something of the appeal of a train wreck being screened in slow motion.  Unfortunately, this film lacks The Sopranos' gallows humor.  The criminal ""mastermind"" of the robbery states early on that he doesn't like working with people he doesn't know, and yet he includes McQueen's character in the job anyway, even though that character has apparently never been to prison, has apparently never even committed a crime previously, and has a fairly difficult time just trying to steal a license plate from a parked car.

Then it turns out that the McQueen character's former girlfriend lives right there in town.  I expected that she would be the seed leading to the ruination of the robbery and the destruction of everyone involved, and the main surprise of the film is that she is not.  She is the unwitting key to the fate of McQueen's character, but otherwise does not affect the overall outcome.

I'd have to say that this is a film for real die-hard fans of Steven McQueen, and black and white movies, and caper films.  Kansas City Confidential, from 1952, while only a caper film in part, is far more entertaining.  So is the original D.O.A. with Edmund O'Brien.",1320105600,,1398,4.763485477178423
771535,4,6304030894,"Having visited St. Louis several times over the years, this time-capsule shows the place before the arch when Stan Musial reigned the city. I must say I bought this DVD more out of curiosity with low expectations than rounding out my McQueen collection and then I sat mesmerized by the noir-ish feel of this building surprising caper movie. This nugget falls into the Asphalt Jungle type of drama, which is very high company. Some of the reviewers did not catch this because of its subtle resemblance. In other words as you are in with the hoods and their caper, you begin to experience the danger of involvement with ""associates"" you don't really know. Like in ""Asphalt"", the tension builds as the character flaws of the participants unravel before your eyes. The cover artwork captures the Peckinpah (""Getaway"") look to McQueen. This does not disappoint. Although this seems low-budget, the script is brilliant from beginning to end. McQueen, surprisingly has all his chops. Hot-headed, moody, conceited(put-on) and romantic. The ""unknown"" character actors keep it real. The boss, ""John Egan"",(Crahan Denton)brings loads of experience to his dark persona as the hardened boss. Then we meet McQueen's buddy, Gino(David Clarke)not sharply-drawn, his sister (played well by a Shirley Maclaine-type) in all her scenes, and the sociopathic sickie(James Ducan)rounds out this thrown-together gang. This movie should be seen by any teenager today who does not know what you mean by being careful about whom you associate. The screenwriter was certainly aware of Theordore Dreiser's work on the American Dream and brings this film to its surprising climax with tremendous impact,utilizing even true participants in this robbery. The robbery here is two-fold, the bank job and a squandered American Dream. The only reason it did not deserve 5 stars in my opinion was the locale-lighting did not measure up to the script that was just a hair away from Kubrick quality. I would also venture that this seldom-seen gem is ripe for a make-over by a Quentin Tarantino. You can see by this movie how McQueen shot into ""Wanted-Dead or Alive"" so quickly. An overlooked gem.",1319414400,,2157,5.148148148148148

This movie feels more like a play or graphic novel.  There are no fancy stunts or even fancy camera work.  It's a simple story about a disastrous set of decisions that leads to a lousy day in St. Louis.

As for acting, well, the actors over reach and clearly Steve McQueen was still developing his cool guy persona.  What makes this movie compelling is the downward spiral of Steve McQueen's character (and the weird ""time capsule"" feel the movie projects to modern audiences).  In this movie, McQueen could project tough, but cool ... not so much.

771619,3,6304030894,"A rather standard heist flick, maybe a bit above average. One of Steve the Loner's early roles as Steve the Loner, and he's the best thing about the film, though the other character actors are all decent, if not outstanding.

This may be a true story, etc, but it all looks like an episode of Dragnet in many ways. With all the great bank robbery films out there it's hard to say watch this one first; once you've run out of heist flicks, this one will do. It would have been perfect finding this black and white chestnut in 1977 on tv at 3 am, but in the dvd age we have endless options. Go for the classics of this genre first, unless you are a major McQueen fan.

And even then, he doesn't do much but mumble and look distracted. Tough, but distracted. Careers have been carved from less...",1247443200,2,793,4.28

In THE GREAT ST. LOUIS BANK ROBBERY (1959), McQueen hires out as ""wheel man"" to a small gang. In this true story, the bank heist quickly devolves into a hostage situation that ends disastrously. Shot on the actual location using non-actors who were both victims of and respondents to the crime, this picture has a realism that makes it worth seeing.

771621,4,6304030894,"At 63, and a friend knowing I was from ""Dago Hill"" in St. Louis, we were chatting about how things had changed in our world.  He being an avid Cardinals fan, as myself, we starting telling stories about Ole' St. Louis.  When I told him about being an early teenager, my father owning the quick shop""Tom's Grill"" and watching the making of the movie, meeting Steve McQueen,in person, seeing the behind the scenes operation, he was intrigued and asked me a lot about the story.  As we sat talking my wife looked at me and suggested we go to Amazon.com, see if the movie was downloadable and watch it.  Well, needless to say it brought back many memories, and since my father died in 1981, I got to see him, alive, young and in the movie in the restaurant scenes when Steve was timing things and had the argument with the girl.

My father obviously is ""Tom"", owner of the grill, I remember many of the actual police officers in the movie as well as those that were involved in the real robbery.  In the scene where the police cars are coming out of the station to respond to the bank, they are coming out of the 2nd district police station on Hampton Ave. which was right behind my house. Since I used to go to the station, shoot my .22 rifle in the basement range, put the flag up on week-ends, I got to know many of the officers that also knew my dad.  As well as sometimes sneaking a ride on the back of one of the police motorcycles from time to time.

Yes, it brought back many memories, the movie itself was of course low budget, black and white, a very young Steve and refreshingly not full of sex, and tons of profanity.

To Amazon, I can only say thank you, from my heart, I am now a semi-retired former police officer, on reserves, and a PhD meteorologist here in Carlsbad, New Mexico.

In missing old St. Louis, the movie actually reminded me of the times as a kid, crawdad fishing and bike riding in Tower Grove park, having sat under that very pagoda in the movie when the gang members met.

So, especially if your an old St. Louis resident or just want to see how it looked with the old 50's cars, cheap gas, and a nostalgic hamburger fast food shop, I highly recommend you watch this movie: ""The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery""

771622,4,6304030894,"I must say I found the movie to be much more interesting than the other reviewers.  If your a fan of Mid- Century Crime movies such as ""Odds Against Tomorrow"" you will like this one.  Characters range from psyco to sordid and sad.  I'm not familiar with the director or the other actors besides McQueen, but the performaces are complex and outstanding. Cinematography is reminiscient of old ""Highway Patrol"" TV series. Recurring rockabilly song heard in background on car radio, jukebox, etc.  Interesting look at 1950's St. Louis.  One daring and creepy aspect of the movie is the homosexuality of the dominant, psyco leader of the group, John Egan.  He and Willie's relationship is alluded to as beginning in prison, and Egan holds his attraction to the McQueen character as a threat over Willie's head, which leads to Willie's animosity toward McQueen, who seems to start to catch on to it at the end.  McQueen's girlfriend's realization of Egan's homosexual attraction to McQueen on a fire escape with Egan leads to her downfall.",1146873600,2,1033,4.936416184971098
771623,4,6304030894,"One of the first films of the King Of Cool the Great St. Louis Bank Robbery is not a bad heist film for its low budget and being made in 1959. Also the film is based on actual events in St. Louis with many of the police officers playing roles in the film.

The story is about George Fowler (Steve McQueen) he is hired to be the getaway driver in a bank robbery by a old friend Gino (David Clarke).He meets with the rest of the crew the methodical John Egan the boss (Crahan Denton) and Willie (James Dukas) the criminal that has past his prime and jealous of George's importance in the robbery. Throught the film we see the preparation for the robbery and George's involment with a past love.

What I liked about this film despite it being a old film and in black and white its that its good heist film. Its cool how they prepare the heist. Timing the runs and checking for cops close to the bank. Another thing is the film feels real and the plot doesn't go to extremes like some other films that we have today. Also there is a scene in the film that I especially liked was where Gino is in the bathroom shaving and George closes the door and Gino realises how small the bathroom is and claustrophobic of it reminding how jail is to locked up. Today in films criminals act like its nothing getting out of jail.

The DVD is a barebones release. Nothing at all. Dont expect in the near future any special edition. But if you really like this film get because just look at the price 4 dollars. Who can beat that.

A entertaining and quick film with good performances. Not a bad heist film with no happy ending for a change than most clich films. Any Steve McQueen fans should see this to look at the start of this legend's career.",1137888000,25,1728,4.259146341463414
771624,4,6304030894,"The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery is an exciting movie featuring a young Steve McQueen.  McQueen plays George Fowler, the getaway driver for a group of three robbers attempting to rob the Southwest Bank in the city of St. Louis. The four men must watch and observe the bank to see when the officers on duty change shifts, the amount of traffic on an average day, and when and where they will make their getaway.  This is an exciting movie that I picked up because Steve McQueen was in it, but I enjoyed the whole movie, not just McQueen's performance(only a year after his first starring role in The Blob).  This is a good example of film noir also with its dark mood, interesting camera angles/shots, and not so perfect characters.  Very entertaining movie as the tension rises all the way until the exciting climactic bank robbery.

  Steve McQueen, in his second starring role, is excellent as getaway driver, George Fowler, a naive college student who finds himself wrapped up in the world of crime.  Even here in only his second major role, McQueen has already perfected the quiet, loner type.  Crahan Denton plays John Egan, the emotionally fragile leader of the bunch who wants this to be his last job.  David Clarke plays Gino, the ex-con who refuses to go back to prison.  James Dukas stars as Willie, the member of the bunch who takes pleasure in antagonizing the rest of the gang.  Molly McCarthy plays Ann, a girl George used to date who gets unwillingly involved with the heist.  The DVD contains a small biography about McQueen and the standard presentation of the movie which doesn't look too bad.  For a surprisingly good heist movie with an excellent performance from a young Steve McQueen, check out The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery!",1091059200,16,1750,4.713815789473684
771625,3,6304030894,"Roan has done a commendable job in restoring this movie, given that the first and last reels of 35mm fine grain were lost, and negatives had to be used for those reels. The picture, while technically widescreen, is a 1.66:1 ratio, so in viewing it on a 16x9 television, the viewer is either left with a slightly trimmed (top and bottom) full frame, or it can be viewed using the ""zoom"" function, sacrificing small amounts of information at the top and bottom. This is unfortunate, as viewing the movie in the latter manner, the picture appears somewhat soft. The picture is quite dark, until the last reel. However, grain and damage are minimal. Sound is probably the weak point of this release....however, I assume Roan did everything it could with the source materials that remained of the film. This is the only reason I leave them off the hook on this DVD.
If you're interested in seeing early Steve McQueen, this is a great place to start. I actually found him to be more similar in this movie to the persona he would become known for, than in his early role in ""The Blob"".

But Dammit, it's funny!  For instance, Willy.  He's not a criminal, he's mentally handicapped.  In 1960 this may have been Action, but 40 years later it's a Four Star Comedy in my eyes.

771627,3,6304030894,"Steve McQueen always was involved in bending the law, both on the screen and in his private life.  He was born in Missouri; this one takes place in Missouri, and it uses the same policemen in the cast that were there in the original robbery.  One thing about McQueen is that he has actor friends that appear in several films with him.  It is interesting to see all of them as they get older.  If you watch this one a few times, you can appreciate that each of the robbers contributes a significant part to the whole that makes the robbery organized.  But a more subtle question is: what did the group of robbers have that caused their downfall ?  To contrast this one, early in McQueen's career, see ""The Getaway"" and ""The Thomas Crown Affair.""  By then, McQueen has discovered that maybe a robbery can be successful !!",1005868800,2,819,4.456375838926174
7860512,5,6304030894,"STEVE McQUEEN in his 1st major movie roll as an unknown, is worth Five Stars. You can see director realized he had a real star in him and the role grew as they filmed. Story is true, as far as Hollywood shows them. McQueen's role was originally just a driver. But, when you find a kid with talent, go with it! So sit back & watch an OK real crime movie with one of Hollywood's greatest in an early role. Story suffers a little as they obviously did rewrites to expand McQueen's role. But, who could complain about that? Is it McQueen's best, ""No."" but, the star quality is there. He is not as polished as in later films, but just watch & ENJOY, realizing you are watching a legend being discovered, as his role grows from bit part to the film's central star.

This was his next movie after the unexpected success of The Blob.  It is a true story ad uses a lot of the same people who were actually involved.  It's been awhile since I have seen this.  So I am reviewing it from memory.  There is one scene where I think it is McQueen involved in a fight,  He throws a punch that even with the camera angle you can tell it is about a foot a way from the other guy's face.
