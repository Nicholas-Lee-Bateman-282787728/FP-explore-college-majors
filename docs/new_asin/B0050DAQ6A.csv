4513962,5,B0050DAQ6A,"I have watched this documentary 10 times and I never get tired of watching it! As a huge Nightmare on Elm Street fan, I was extremely excited that there was going to be a documentary dedicated to Nancy Thompson, and trust me, I AM NANCY truly does the character justice. There are really funny parts, really serious parts, and a few really touching moments, and the film is edited so well that it all flows together. I have been recommended this documentary to so many people, and I will continue doing so because it is BRILLIANT! True Nightmare on Elm Street fans, especially Nancy fans, will definitely enjoy it. And I love that Heather Langenkamp is so proud of this character and wants to remind people what a heroine she really was. Heather, Arlene, and everyone else involved in making this documentary, I just have to say great work, and thank you for reminding this world just how special Nancy is. Watch this documentary, everyone! You won't be disappointed!",1307923200,6,967,4.727810650887574
4513963,5,B0050DAQ6A,"I have watched this documentary 8 times and I still laugh every time!  If you are a true ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" fan I don't know how you could not watch this film. There was so much thought put into it by Heather and Arlene (the star and director) and they really to a great job honoring the fans that were so open to share their stories.

Heather is on a mission in this movie to see what Nancy (the heroine) means to fans. We all know and love Freddy, but without Nancy who would Freddy have to battle? Nancy is the strongest of the Nightmare on Elm Street leading ladies and should be honored as such. What surprised me when I first watched the film was how it was so funny, and yet it really took a look at the more serious side of the Nancy story and how the courage of Heather's character has helped other people. There are also some wonderful interviews with Wes Craven, Robert Englund, and Jessica Craven (Wes' daughter) exploring the legacy of NOES and the character of Nancy.

I have become very passionate about this project and I feel like it is actually pretty hard to put into words of how amazing it actually is. The best thing I can say is it is worth watching... again and again and again! So after you leave this page go to [...] or buy it here at amazon and get your copy now. Go ahead, I'll wait!",1307923200,4,1321,4.213438735177865
4513964,5,B0050DAQ6A,"This is a great documentary on the insight of the character Nancy Thompson, a truly iconic horror heroine.  It is apparent that she is more than just a scream queen.  She has touched people's lives, and it is shown through the many fans that Heather Langenkamp meets along her journey of discovering Who is Nancy Thompson.  If you are a fan of Nightmare on Elm Street, this film is a must buy!",1306454400,4,393,4.430555555555555
4513965,5,B0050DAQ6A,"If you are a fan of A Nightmare on Elm Street you must get this dvd for your collection.  The ""I Am Nancy"" song alone is worth the price of the dvd.  Heather Langenkamp is one the greatest heroines in cinematic history.  To understand Nancy is to understand Freddy.  The expanded interviews with Robert Englund and Wes Craven was very entertaining. So get your coffee brewing and order this dvd now.  And whatever you do, don't fall asleep!",1305936000,3,440,4.589743589743589
4513966,5,B0050DAQ6A,"Heather Langenkamp reminds me of Julianne Moore, so many layers and an extraordinary actress.  While I would have enjoyed seeing more of Heather in movies, she didn't compromise her integrity and become a typical red carpet chaser, being famous for absolutely nothing.  She leaves you wanting more.

The way she portrayed Nancy in the three Nightmare films she participated in had you rooting for her, NOT rolling your eyes, just hoping that Freddy would win.  The fear and emotion she displays in NOES the films isn't typical unrealistic teen scream hysteria.

ANOES came out when I was in junior high school.  I was about to deploy to Afghanistan when the remake was released and I spoke with some of the younger generation of fans that were my age at the time I saw the original ANOES that said they saw the NOES remake and the original.  The said hands down, no comparison of the remake to the original and were big fans of the original Nancy.

I found out about I AM NANCY because of the Never Sleep Again DVD.  I was unaware of Heather's participation in either until I read the back of the Never Sleep Again dvd case. I was sold on the dvd and bought several for other original NOES fans.  I am grateful she was interested in the project rather than distancing herself from something from her early career.  While I enjoyed the performances of all the actors in ANOES, I have to say that this film holds up due in large part to the performance of Heather Langenkamp.

If someone wants to talk about role models in films for young people, take a look at the character of Nancy in the Nightmare films.  She embodies the qualities a person of any age, female or male, could aspire to.",1340582400,5,1688,4.531353135313531
4513967,3,B0050DAQ6A,"I was looking forward to seeing this DVD, but after I got into it, it was really quite boring.  I was hoping for more detail on the interactions on set of the movies and more indepth discription of her realtionship with the other actors.",1339286400,3,237,4.386363636363637
4513968,5,B0050DAQ6A,"I AM NANCY is a must see, must own DVD! If you love Freddy or Nancy or both you need this DVD in your collection.",1336780800,,113,3.56
4513969,5,B0050DAQ6A,"I love ""Nancy"" a.k.a. Heather Langenkamp my whole life I've never not known who Nancy was. I love this dvd Heather Langenkamp if you see this ""Thank You"" and when I'm going threw it at bad times I always remember wwnd ""I Am Nancy"" :))",1336348800,4,234,4.222222222222222
4513970,5,B0050DAQ6A,"Smart, witty, informative, and a great edition to the Elm Street series (and Never Sleep Again). A lot of thought and care went into making this documentary. Every clip is cleverly placed and the interactions fans have with Heather is memorable and sincere. Director, Arlene Marechal, put a lot of blood, sweat, and tears into the project and it shows. You will not be disappointed with this documentary. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and by the end, you'll be stating: I Am Nancy.",1318464000,2,477,4.829268292682927
4513971,5,B0050DAQ6A,"This documentary is as much about the legacy of Nancy, as it is about the fans, some who have been there since 1984!  This project really delivers, as it focuses on what Nancy means to different individuals globally, and shows just how far some have taken their love for this character, and applied it to their personal lives. Never Sleep Again gives us a short glimpse of this project, as it focuses more on deconstructing the Elm Street movies. Here, the heart and soul of the movies is exposed, through perhaps their most important characater, Nancy.  This is a must for any fan of the original franchise, if they have a thirst and a desire for more.  Here is Heather Langenkamp, with Robert Englund, and others, many years after the movies have been released, still going on strong with their desire to bring a little piece of Elm Street to every corner of the globe.  The Elm Street legacy lives on, and in 2011, it makes a stop at perhaps one of the most important areas that hasn't been covered yet in the 25+ years that this franchise has been around: Fan Street.  Once on this street, rarely visited on a project outside of more rare and hard to access convention panels, we get answers to the question, ""exactly what kind of an impact has all of this had on global society?""  Also, ""who really IS Nancy?""  ""What is she all about?""  Heather Langenkamp knows, and here she finally takes the time to star in perhaps her most important project to date, to let the world know that, she IS Nancy.",1315267200,2,1500,4.509225092250922
4513972,5,B0050DAQ6A,"In horror films, the heroes or heroines are usually always overshadowed by the villain on a large scale. But does that mean that the villains are the only ones who are important? Why do so many people like these evil characters anyway? This is what Heather explores in her documentary!!! In this outstanding love letter to the world of fandom, Heather seeks to find where her beloved character of Nancy stands in the world of well known horror icon, Freddy Krueger! The beautiful thing about this documentary is that Heather is a fan of Nancy herself. When she takes you on this journey through the world of conventions, you feel as though you're right there with Heather, talking to these fans and listening to their stories. Heather is an extremely kind, funny, compassionate, intelligent, and welcoming person and you see so much of that in I AM NANCY. The documentary is absolutely charming.  I waited two almost three months from its release so i could have my first time seeing it be on the big screen at this summer's Days of the Dead convention and I can tell you that i was NOT disappointed! I am a huge fan of Nancy and I've always felt that she deserved a lot more recognition than she first received. Nancy is who I believe to be the greatest horror heroine of all time, and she is without a doubt my favorite CHARACTER of all time. Nancy is strong, resourceful, loyal, compassionate, unwavering, and intelligent. Whats so amazing about Nancy is that she is the typical girl next door and she defeats evil without the use of any super powers. This reminds audiences that you don't have to have supernatural forces working with you to obtain greatness, all you need is your own strength and will to overcome an obstacle! When you watch this, you will see the Nancy inside a lot of fan leap out of the screen from some of these stories. I do not want to spoil it but I promise you that you will not be disappointed. This documentary is brilliant and extremely inspirational, the ending brings me to tears every time! Along with fantastic moments captured on the screen, this documentary is assisted by superb editing and direction to convey its purpose. I love this with all of my heart and it will forever be a treasure that i will pass along to as many people as possible. I am proud to say that I AM NANCY :)",1310601600,10,2321,4.5393794749403344
4513973,5,B0050DAQ6A,"I can't begin to tell you how much I've enjoyed this documentary!  Not only is it a wealth of information, but it contains so much of Heather's personality that you feel like you are right there with her.  I've had the wonderful opportunity to meet her twice and she is so approachable and caring.  I went through many years of problems regarding myself and my place in this world.  I use to watch ANOES repeatedly and always rallied behind Nancy fighting Freddy.  I didn't realize till so many years later and after watching this DVD that the reason I enjoyed these ""Nightmare"" movies and characters like ""Nancy"" & ""Jesse"" was because they were fighters and I didn't have the strength to fight for myself, so they were my hero's when I couldn't find one in me.  I guess I've come full circle regarding that and after seeing this documentary, I'm thankful it has been made.  Maybe others can find that strength too.",1310601600,21,915,4.611111111111111
4513974,5,B0050DAQ6A,If you are a Nightmare on Elm Street fan - you MUST watch this video. Heather is great in this movie and did a great job.,1309132800,5,121,3.6923076923076925
4513975,5,B0050DAQ6A,"If I could, I would rate this 4.9 stars.  I love this dvd, it's 5 stars.  I love Heather, she's 5 stars.  The only problem I have (and I'm just being picky here) is that I don't like the case it comes in.  It's not really a dvd case, it looks more like a greeting card.  The dvd is inside of it and it doesn't seem very secure or protected against scratches.  Plus, the spine isn't labeled so it doesn't look right on my dvd stand with the rest of my NOES dvds.  But it's still a great dvd and I would recommend that all NOES fans buy it.",1308355200,3,538,3.8807339449541285

8451054,1,B0050DAQ6A,Took forever to get the item and when it finally arrived it is in this cheap cardboard sleeve.  I am surprised it made it to me in one piece.  Wow!  At least package it in a standard dvd case.  Major thumbs down.,1471046400,2,212,3.9761904761904763

8451057,2,B0050DAQ6A,"Don't buy this expecting it to be an all-encompassing documentary about Nancy and her involvement in the series. Or even how Heather Langenkamp got the role of Nancy in the first place. That was already covered in previous video docs. It's basically Heather and her film crew wandering around, wondering why Nancy didn't become the cult phenomenon that Freddy did. Well, like Heather said in New Nightmare, she wasn't really in much of the series. It's mostly comprised of her many convention appearances, with a few interviews, only two of which you will recognize: Robert Englund & Wes Craven. Heather goes around asking why more people don't have Nancy tattoos (there was one, but mostly because she was on the original VHS cover). Then, she whines about them changing the DVD box art to feature Freddy more prominently. She also bashes the only two toy models she can find of her Nancy character, and can't seem to find any Nancy standees, but tons of Freddy stuff. ::pout::

Nancy may have seemed like a strong character in the movie, but in the end, she ultimately proved to be ineffectual since Freddy lived and kept coming back. After Never Sleep Again, I can just picture Heather following some poor executive around. ""Picture this: what if we tell this story from the perspective of the Nancy fans?"" Executive: Here you go, this all we could find. I Am Nancy is released.

Oh, those caveats I mentioned? The product details list a running time of 2 hrs. Not so. This feature is only 71 mins long. Some Pig's response to this was to add up the time of the movie + the special features (two extended interviews and a music video made from convention footage) and you get 2 hrs. I told them that's not really how that's supposed to work. Also, this disc doesn't come in a case. It is inserted directly into the pocket of a cardboard sleeve where it will scratch each and every time it goes in or out. Think Avatar, Star Wars and Friday the 13th blu-rays all over again. Just invest in 50 cent cases and run off some paper inserts, Some Pig! This has cheap written all over it. Except the price isn't. Almost $20 after shipping because it's not on Amazon Prime. If I had seen this beforehand, I would not have purchased it. Luckily, they refunded my money. Buy at your own risk.",1407196800,4,2284,4.595588235294118
8451058,5,B0050DAQ6A,"This documentary was quite innovative and had a great insight from the perspective of the heroine as opposed to the monster; who usually gets more love than his forthright counterpart.  ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" has always been my favorite franchise of the 1980s because of its unconventional appeal and its original stories that is more than just the typical supernatural madman in a mask with a machete.  I saw the film at the age of 6 for the very first time and it honestly scared me to my core; the story and how it all developed was so intriguing that you can't help to be wrapped inside it's creative magic.  What I was most captured by, even at the age of 6, was the girl with dark hair, who is the one that is standing against villain Freddy Krueger.  Nancy Thompson took it upon herself go into her nightmares and seek out her nemesis; an unlikely trait found in some heroines.  I always wanted to know more about her and wanted the world to know just how great she is, not just to the franchise, but in literature as well and also what she means to the fans.  I AM NANCY is an awesome insight to those very questions and goes into depth of the impact that Nancy had on the film and how she continues to live on in the next generation of horror movie watchers; even after 20 plus years since the film's release.",1386115200,,1323,4.336032388663968
8451059,5,B0050DAQ6A,"Where to begin... It's the classic tale, girl tries out for movie, gets cast, movie does well, spawns sequels, builds an empire, spawns millions of fans, all looking up to her...  waaaaaaaaait a minute, that is not the typical tale at all!!! This Dvd documents Heather Langenkamp, who played Nancy in 2 1/2 films... i say the half cause in New Nightmare she was only nancy for the second half...  anyways... Heather travels around the world and interviews fans as to why this movie and the character means so much to us.

If you are a nightmare fan this is a must for you, if you are a Heather fan, then you already have it in your collection, you pre-ordered it, have multiple copies, and probably could recite it word for word, and if you don't.... well then what are you waiting for?

I think it is established by the reviews that this is a 5 star, if i could give it 10 i would, i might have to write another review to just give it 10 ahahah. anyways, I really enjoyed this documentary as Heather has been my idol since i was 4 years old. thats 25 years now... The Character of Nancy has shown me that I can face my battles or ""freddies"" as its referred to in the documentary, and that i can win...  Amazon is a great place to order this, but i say pop over to I am Nancy doc the web page and order it from there, you can get it autographed by Heather... and trust me, its really Heather autographing it, I met her in November, and gave her a doll i made (im on the front page of the nancy doc web page) and i asked about the autographs and she said she signs every one, that its not an assistant or anything... its really her and Arlene who run the page... so check it out, she also has a blog on there...

What it boils down to is Heather is a truly amazing person, and this Documentary is a Love Letter to her fans!  Now what are you waiting for, go order it!  BE NANCY",1361923200,,1876,4.134615384615385
