4049699,5,B0031REQBS,"I made a mistake and purchased the Red Cliff - International version, first.  I came across the pt 1 and pt2 of Red Cliff.  I was very pleasantly surprised when I watched the Pt2.  It was great.  I enjoyed the fight scenes.  The details were surburb.  The John Woo the director did an excellant job.  I would recommend buying the Red Cliff pt1 and pt2 dvds.  They have a better flow of action in the movies than the International version.  The history lesson was great.",1274054400,6,469,4.423529411764706

8387215,4,B0031REQBS,"With the cast established, their motivations solidified, the stage set and the first volleys already thrown in the original, John Woo is able to just sit back, relax, and make the thoroughly indulgent epic action picture he always wanted in its sequel. Where the first film thematically leans more in the direction of theology and politics, backed by a brief taste of large-scale military maneuvers, this follow-up is a full-gale blast of battlefield planning and dramatic execution. History buffs may grimace at a few of its flashier moments, like the warrior who uses his spear to pole vault over enemy battalions, but those are rare enough to write off as passing fits of eccentricity from a director who's not always known for his realism. Besides, the real sizzle lies with the world-class, hour long battle scene that closes the picture - and the obscene amount of fascinating war maneuvers seen therein. It's the mother of all fight scenes, an intense, unrelenting thrill ride the likes of which hasn't been seen from the west in decades, if ever. And, as Woo addresses one of my biggest complaints about the first Red Cliff - the generic, evil-for-the-fun-of-it enemy commander who's admirably rounded out in a few powerful scenes - it's ultimately an even better effort than its predecessor. A thrilling, intense, large-scale classic that makes for one hell of a payoff.",1342396800,4,1379,5.026200873362446
