The is a fun, quirky, little Roger Moore actioner, made will he was still playing the role of James Bond. Beautiful HD presentation and sound. Great modelwork and explosive effects as well! Nice to see this on blu. The U.S. title is called ""ffolkes,"" and the disc gives you the option to play the movie with this title, if you prefer. I was very pleased to upgrade my DVD copy of this movie to blu!",1474416000,2,542,4.376237623762377
8327913,5,B001NTE7GK,"ffolkes or NORTH SEA HIJACK is one of the greatest unsung action adventure films ever made. It has so many strong points. The cast and script are far above anything anyone ever expected and unfortunately this film went entirely unnoticed on its release. This is one of director Andrew V. McLaglen's best films thanks to a cast that includes Roger Moore, Anthony Perkins, James Mason, David Hedison, Michael Parks, George Baker and Jack Watson and a superlative screenplay by Jack Davies. What really makes this film work so successfully is how Jack Davies gave each character such depth and distinct and dynamic personality. This keeps the story moving and is as intense and suspenseful as it is entertaining. For instance, David Hedison given what is essentially a minor role has some effective lines bringing his character true realism to the extent that we truly empathize with him making him more than another cardboard figure that he had been relegated to throughout his career. Anthony Perkins turns in one of his best roles and a very villainous and diabolical one at that. Anthony Perkins' character is so unpredictable you just haven't a clue to what he is up to next. He's incredible. But the entire cohesive force that holds this film together is Roger Moore. This is probably the performance of his career, along perhaps with THE MAN WHO HAUNTED HIMSELF. Roger Moore is flamboyant, charismatic and demonstrates a no nonsense tough and hardened side we have never seen. And the best thing about Roger's performance is that he is entirely and thoroughly believable. Every once in a while you have to pinch yourself and remember that this is really not the true life Roger Moore here, he's just playing a character. Roger Moore is that good in this film. The plot too is not standard fare. It has twists and turns and things happen that normally don't happen in your typical action adventure film. You just don't mess with Anthony Perkins in this film. That's all I will say on that. In fact, I don't know what else to say. This really and truly is a good one.",1415059200,,2069,4.782122905027933
8327914,4,B001NTE7GK,"Roger Moore stars here as an unofficial Scots marine commando (Rufus Escalibur Ffolkes) who trains an elite squad of half-a-dozen other ex-servicemen to combat underwater terrorism, should the need arise - and it does! Anthony Perkins (as Kramer) leads a team of villains to hijack a North Sea oil rig for a 25 million ransom. David Hedison is the captain of the oil rig. James Mason stars as Admiral Brindsen, the navy's man on the scene and Faith Brook is our decisive lady Prime Minister. The story was written by Jack Davies; Elliott Kasner was the Producer, and Andrew V. McLaglen the Director of the movie. It's a gripping thriller, though it would have been even more exciting with some of the stunts we have now become used to in James Bond movies.",1349222400,,756,4.69172932330827
