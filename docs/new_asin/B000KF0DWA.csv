8156046,5,B000KF0DWA,"A friend who knows I love magic gave me this DVD.  It may not have been for my particular age bracket, but I enjoyed it.  I can see how it is a great primer in magic for young magicians.  I chuckled to realize a version of Wonder Wand was something I performed in my teens.  The tricks are easy to learn.  They do not require expensive props.  They use props the kids can make themselves out of common around the house materials.  Parents may want to supervise or help with the props as they require the use of scissors and a piece of dowel may need to be cut for a magic wand.  Lyn does a great job demonstrating and explaining the tricks and their preparation.  This would be a great gift for any budding young magician whomever he or she might be.",1201305600,2,750,4.188811188811189
