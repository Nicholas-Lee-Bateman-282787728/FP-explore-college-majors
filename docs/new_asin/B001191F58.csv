Only 2 scenes are from 1986 & the rest is from 1989 (Interesting) Winterbeast isn't a movie that's so BAD it's good, it's a movie that's so BAD it's HILARIOUS.Totem poles are coming to life & killing people!!! There are times where you'll laugh, There are times where you'll cringe, There are times where you'll go WTF?! You'll either be entertained or BORED out of your mind. I don't know if there will be times where you'll get pains in your head watching it like I did but I hope not. The claymation in this movie reminded me of The Gumby Show, only demented. After the 1st claymation monster scene with the lady who puts forth no effort in her screaming (Which was hilarious) after seeing the monster, You know it's going to be bad. Winterbeast is a movie for all those bad movie lovers out there. If you're not a bad movie lover then I can't imagine you'll sit through the whole thing. I absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVE bad movies but out of all the tons of them that I've seen, I've NEVER ever seen 1 like Winterbeast. The DVD cover even says *It Must Be Seen To Be Believed* & that's the truth!!!",1497139200,,1189,4.409090909090909

8241074,1,B001191F58,"I purchased this flick based on the reviews here on Amazon, that'll teach me a lesson to listen to others. Winterbeast does not deserve the status of ""CULT FLICK"", there are far better movies out there that deserve that title. I live & breathe horror, sci-fi, fantasy flicks, low budget & LOVE everything about bad cinema but this was not worthy of my twenty bucks!! NO PLOT, Extremely bad acting, the editing is horrible, the audio/sound is just awful!! Some of the audio does not sync up to what the actors are saying (bad ADR) & the picture quality is just terrible!! Parts of this movie did not even make any sense, nothing redeemable in Winterbeast! I literally wanted to fast forward this piece of junk, i gave it every shot, i tried to like it but it's not worthy of my opinion or this review. I have to let others know what they are buying so they do not make the same mistake i did. You've heard the expression, ""It's so bad it's good"",... Not In This Case! This is just plain bad with no redeemable qualities. If you buy this coaster worthy movie and are disgusted with it, remember, I TOLD YOU SO. Spend your 20 bucks on something more worthy. This movie deserves ZERO stars on Amazon's rating but only gets 2 bloody thumbs down, WAY DOWN!!

8241076,5,B001191F58,PLEASE buy this now!!!!  Are you a fan of stop-motion!?  Just buy this; it needs to be in your horror collection!  Oh yeah!....remember to stock up on beer and invite your friends for this too lol!,1259020800,2,197,4.416666666666667
8241077,5,B001191F58,"Yikes! ""Winterbeast"" is a true no-budget classic! Non-existent production values are  coupled with powerful hallucinatory imagery, some of which is truly disturbing, to create an absolutely unique  viewing experience. The clay-animated monsters remind one of Art Clokey on a bad acid trip; they remain cute and likable as they graphically tear their victims to pieces. One sequence featuring a marvelous actor, Bob Harlow, wearing a clown mask and prancing about a dead body to an ancient recording of a childrens song, is as creepy as anything you'll ever see on film. ""Winterbeast' is no-budget filmaking at its finest. You'll have trouble sitting through it the first time. Then you'll watch it again, and again.

The audio commentary by director Chris Thies and producer-editor-animator Mark Frizzell is a virtual crash-course on the joys and agonies of making a no-budget film, a great and insightful bonus on this disc and not to be missed.

""Winterbeast"" is Grade-Z horror at its best. Highly recommended!",1206057600,5,1012,5.267080745341615
