The songs are classic, touching, emotional, heart braking and unforgettable. The sound and quality image on the blu ray is fantastic, to all Motels fans I reccomend to buy it now before it gets out of stock or the price gets higher and impossible to get. This is a concert fans of The Motels have been waiting for sooo long. Take the L....but its not over......everybody wants more Motels songs! I love you Martha!!",1448150400,,527,4.739130434782608

7364818,5,B013GY0FQ0,"What a fabulous film!! The only other music film I can compare it to is Scorsese's ""The Last Waltz"". The Motels at the GoGo totally pulls you in and doesn't let you go. Denise Faye's brilliant direction made me feel as though I was there at the Go Go, with my nose pressed against the stage.  I never wanted it to end, even though I could hardly catch my breath.  Mesmerizing.  Denise and the director of photography Roy H. Wagner, capture the beauty, talent and allure of the ever-gorgeous Martha. Is it possible that she becomes more captivating with age, a la Patti Smith and Marianne Faithful? The smokey, atmospheric look of the entire production pulls you back to a time that we yearn to relive.  I look forward to what these talented filmmakers will do next.",1445385600,3,765,4.562043795620438
7364819,5,B013GY0FQ0,"If you like the Motels or are a fan of 80's music, this is a real treat. I'm not sure if any other concert footage captures a Motels performance in the way this dvd does. Lead singer Martha Davis looks and sounds great with the filming done by Emmy winning cinematographer Roy H. Wagner and the film's director, Denise Faye. But it's not just the Motels... it's a bit of history too. This was filmed in 2014 at the 50th anniversary of the Whisky-a-Go-Go on the Sunset Strip. It was a sellout crowd, celebrities everywhere, and a backdrop of the place that invented go-go girls in cages. The extras on the disk includes a bull session with former Motels band members.",1442966400,6,666,4.512396694214876
7364820,5,B013GY0FQ0,"I've been a fan of The Motels since the early '80s. I've seen the band play live, in its various incarnations, hundreds of times at all kinds of venues. This night was hands-down one of the most memorable. It'll go down in history--because The Motels were a big part of The Whisky's history. The nostalgic feeling at this show was palpable; the crowd was transported back in time, led by Martha's ever-captivating vocals and stage presence. Several members of the band from the past showed up. It was also Martha's birthday. Emotions were running high--lots of singing along and woo-hoos and laughter and even tears. I haven't seen the DVD, but I can't imagine that this concert captured on film will be anything less than 5-star (a renowned and veteran DP shot it.) For those like me who were there, the DVD will allow us to remember and relive it. And for those who weren't there, now you have a way to experience the Motels-meets-Whisky magic, then and now.",1438732800,8,960,4.686390532544379

8727639,3,B013GY0FQ0,"She still has a great voice!  But shes gained about 40 pounds and dresses like a man. The trench coat and hat are not good for her image, to say the least.  a real heartbreak! her voice is worth it, but I just can't stand to look at her, after all, SHE WAS DROP DEAD GORGEOUS! SEXY!  SEDUCTIVE! But now shes just cute and pudgy(?) with a great voice. So just close your eyes, the voice is still very seductive.",1488153600,,410,4.1

An entertaining celebration of Life and career in an intimate setting.
Fascinating selection of musical styles. The songs here remind me how beautiful my youth was and Martha Davis is a very special part of it. She is in Masterful form here, simply exquisite! An artistic and survivalist triumph. Beautiful!

The video quality is very good overall marred only by second and third cameras that are lower definition.

8727641,5,B013GY0FQ0,"This is a great addition to your Disc library.  It is filmed at the Whiskey and as soon as Linda Perry comes out to introduce The Motels I am excited. I felt like I was there. Martha Davis in her sultry beauty and mesmerizing voice transported me back to a time when I went out to watch bands live. It is beautifully filmed in the blue light of a live show. You can feel the excitement of the crowd especially when Martha steps off the stage and walks through the crowd with her beefy body guards in tow.  These are songs that the crowd knows and feels. It is a music of a different time when you felt the songs and didn't need a visual to enjoy it; a time when we listened to the lyrics, the beat and auto-tune didn't make a singer.

Only The Lonely and Suddenly Last Summer are two of my favorite songs of the times and two I would sing at the karaoke bars of the 80s. Man, I miss those times.",1450224000,2,895,4.045197740112994
8727642,5,B013GY0FQ0,Bought my copy through PledgeMusic and am glad I was part of this campaign. I saw the Motels some 30 years ago and their music still holds up.  This DVD (Blu-Ray) is extremely well filmed and the audio is top notch.  Just like being at the Whisky without leaving your living room.  Happy belated birthday Martha.,1449360000,,312,4.535714285714286
8727643,5,B013GY0FQ0,"This was well worth the wait....Whether you are a fan of Martha Davis OR you are not familiar with her but love incredible live RnR with a truly sultry, charismatic delivery.....BUY this. They don't make like they used to! Martha is as important as contemporaries like Deborah Harry, Chrissie Hynde & if you love them, you already love Martha & own this already like me. EPIC, Intense RnR without anything but this amazing artist and her band...Again, buy it!",1448755200,,459,4.822784810126582
