2769948,3,B000NJMJX4,"It's good, but if you have already purchased the Super Mario Bros 3 complete  series there is no need to buy this item. It has no special features and all of the episodes are already on the Complete series edition.",1186444800,9,214,4.35

8178555,5,B000NJMJX4,"My son loves these cartoons so its great for him. I think they're annoying though. Shhhh don't tell him I said that. So if you're a little boy or buying for a little boy, great buy! If you're a grown woman who is not interested in Mario, maybe not so great buy. lol Delivery was great though and dvd had no damage or anything.",1411430400,,326,4.109375

8178558,4,B000NJMJX4,"King Koopa Katastrophe features 6 episodes from the old 90s Super Mario 3 series for, in general, a very low price.

The episodes play out of order compared to the original broadcast, but each stands alone without building on earlier episodes, so this is a non issue.

Most importantly, 3 of the 6 episodes on this volume feature cover songs that were present when the show first aired, but were removed from the Complete Series DVDs due to copyright restrictions.",1370908800,2,464,4.7875

8178562,4,B000NJMJX4,MAN I remember these cartoons. They are exactly like the game. The look of the cartoon is more old fashioned-not like on the cover- they trick you. It's not modern at all and you see some mistakes sometimes like the birds head is green then in another scene its yellow. They are funny and Loud!,1237852800,,294,4.363636363636363
