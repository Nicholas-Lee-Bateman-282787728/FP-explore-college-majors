2042984,4,B0001Y4JMU,"A must for Jagged Edge fans all the videos are on this DVD except for the original version of Where the party at, instead the powers that be felt the need to put the awful 11-01-01 Dupri remix video instead. Another big disapointment was lack of anything else like interviews or concert footage on the DVD but you can't have it all i guess.",1086739200,,340,4.328125

2042989,5,B0001Y4JMU,"I love love love this dvd..it is my favorite of the many music dvds I own.  I love the music and having the videos just adds to the whole JE experience.  Truly underrated but maybe that is why they have been in the game for so long. The clothes they are wearing in some of the videos are so right and they look so handsome, adding to the eye candy. If you love JE then get this one, you will not regret it.",1342656000,,406,3.8795180722891565

2042992,4,B0001Y4JMU,"I am a big fan of the group. This is a great selection of videos but quite a disappointment because of too many re-mixes. Jagged Edge's main qualities are smooth ballads such as 'Gotta Be,''What's it like,' and 'Promise' etc. Re-mixes are great to listen to but seem ridiculous on video as the performers' dance routines are always out-of-sync with the beat and lyrics. This collection could have been much better had it also included ballads like 'Without You,''Girl its over' and 'I don't wanna.' Hoping for another unleash soon!!",1151712000,,532,4.9222222222222225
2042993,5,B0001Y4JMU,Jagged Edge still has the potential to be one of the biggest groups in R&B. After four classic albums they released a greatest hits video collection. Like a previous reviewer said it would have been cool to see some live footage and get some slow jam remixes instead of the bass ones.,1133136000,,284,4.480769230769231
2042994,5,B0001Y4JMU,When I first heard of Jagged Edge I didn't pay much attention to em.  Then a couple years ago I heard the Remarqable Remix of Lets Get Married n fell in love.  Found out who sang the song n ordered two cd's to get it.  I barely listened to most of Jagged Littel Thrill n found that they sing a lot of songs I like n wanted but couldn't get cuz I didn't know who it was.  This DVD is great cuz the videos are ones Ive never seen.  I was disappointed the video for the original version of Where The Party At wasn't included n the lack of interviews stinks but overall having 13 videos made up for that.  All in all if all you need to be happy is videos this is a good choice.,1106784000,3,673,3.875912408759124
