6251702,5,B00I5TYNZ6,"I absolutely LOVE both of these movies. There's always a good feeling when you know you've received a good return on your investment. ""Sadie"" is one of the most enjoyable adult films that I've witnessed in quite some time......either ""retro"" or current. Chris Cassidy is gorgeous.....and extremely sexy. I had never previously HEARD of her until I discovered ""retro"" 70's pornography on Amazon.com (of all places). ""The Seductress"" featured the talents of Ms. Lisa DeLeeuw, absolutely 1 of my very favorite 70's porn Queens from that period. I knew I would get a charge out of anything that Lisa was featured in.",1408665600,11,612,5.009803921568627

6251704,4,B00I5TYNZ6,"I've been impressed with the quality of other Vinegar Syndrome releases, but this doesn't live up to that standard.  While the lighting, sharpness and detail of the original material does come through - it's not clipped, too bright or too dark and color balance looks good - there is a lot of digital compression noise on top of all that.  Larger areas of low detail tend to take on a watery appearance due to the high amount of compression used to encode these, and it's particularly evident in the first film, Sadie.  There is a lot of graininess over both films, again, more so on the first film.  As stated though, the quality of the source material still comes through, and the noise may not be all that problematic on smaller screens.  There are no apparent edge enhancements done, which is good, and VS takes pride in this fact as stated on their website.

Audio is Dolby Digital mono, and there are no special features, aside from trailers for the two films.  Having been spoiled by previous Vinegar Syndrome releases, I was expecting similar quality here.  The difference may be that my previous exposure was to their Drive-In Collections, and this set is from their Peekarama series, which may be handled by a different service.

As another reviewer has pointed out, both films do include hardcore scenes.

I'd recommend this if you're into the 60's & 70's exploitation genre, and even though there is a fair amount of digital compression noise, the original material still shines through.",1402704000,15,1499,4.797665369649805
6251705,5,B00I5TYNZ6,Considering the age of these adult features (1970s) the transfer to DVD was quite excellent.  I was mightily surprised and impressed at how well scripted the movies were too and the acting by the whole cast was excellent.  I would certainly recommend this set to all adults seeking a bit of tongue-in-cheek humour.,1401667200,14,314,4.90566037735849
6251706,5,B00I5TYNZ6,"Both movies were great, clear picture, good acting, and lots of nudity and hardcore sex. both movies considered of the good movies of the eighties, and the price is reasonable for two movies.",1398902400,12,191,4.818181818181818

8639470,4,B00I5TYNZ6,"This is yet another impressive Vinegar Syndrome release
If you are a fan/collector of these classic 35mm and 16mm films this is another outstanding Peekarama Big 2 Unit Show!  double feature
These two films are Bob Chinn at his best during the early 1980's  during a much different time

Sadie (1980)
Originally on VHS there has been a unofficial DVD-R bootleg sold throughout the years
This is the first time it's gotten a real legit official home video release
***Scanned & Restored in 2K from 35mm Internegative
Starring:  Cris Cassidy, Diana Holt, Lisa K Loring, Rick Ardon

The Seductress (1981)
Originally on VHS and later a dvd version released by  Gourmet Video on September 2007
I have no clue how good Gourmet video is? if there transfer are better then the original VHS?
I doubt it though......
***Scanned & Restored in 2K from 16mm Camera Negative
Starring: Billy Dee, Damon Christian, Kathy Harcourt, Lee Carroll, Lisa DeLeeuw, Yvette Cole
Lee Carroll is a bit underrated

This tawdry tale of double-dealing and sexual intrigue focuses on the sleazy goings-on in the building of a Vegas high-rise. Damon Christian stars as a peeping photographer who teams up with sultry hooker Lee Carroll to entrap some local politicos. Once he`s shot some steamy pics of them in the clinch with Lee, Damon blackmails the guys into letting him skimp on fire codes and building guidelines. The results are explosive -- in more ways than one! Highlights include a lusty liaison between the buxom redhead Lisa de Leeuw, Yvette Cole, and a pair of well-built studs, and a fiery tryst between Billy Dee and Kathy Harcourt. In the end, everyone finds out that the best way to fight fire is with some fire of your own!

You will never see either film looks this good
The only real negative is any lack of any exclusive extras
Both films do have the original Theatrical Trailer
But, that's it regardless  it still two classic early 1980's film getting a spotlight and ""real"" 2K remasters

The only question any collector/fan should have is this for me?
That all depends if you are a retro fan this dvd is another must to add to any collection
If you don't know who Seka, Christy Canyon, Angel Kelly, Ginger Lynn, & Barbara Dare are this release isn't for you
You honestly won't get these films or understand why these are classics  another solid dvd  8.5/10",1482105600,,2347,4.767901234567901

8639472,3,B00I5TYNZ6,"Though these movies were mad in the 60's-70's their plot and action was below standard. I don't expect much out of b-type of sexual/porn movies , but this was below my standard (if their is standards for this cinematography)",1433289600,,224,4.769230769230769

8639474,3,B00I5TYNZ6,"Avoid the Drive-In Collections are all pretty poor in just about every respect ...Check out the Peekarama series which are as a whole of much better quality and better then most hard core flicks at a very good price for double sex features. Which show all, but not kinky as a whole, fair reproduction. Not a tease as many, but non-stop action,and often the actors are really enjoying themselves ...can be rough and crude yet still sensitive at times

Better then most current x rated type films which seems more artificial and twisted",1418774400,,534,4.741935483870968

8639478,2,B00I5TYNZ6,"Both Sadie and The Seductress were adult films from the early 80's directed by Bob Chinn. And both films were attempts by Chinn to come up with an adult movie with a plot. Neither succeeded.

Sadie was an attempt to be an adult movie with a plot, but unfortunately, it failed in an aspect. After a promising opening scene between Sadie (Cris Cassidy) and Jock (Jerome Deeds), it went downhill from there. The plot centers around Sadie, a high priced prostitute whose values are constantly clashing with Senator Chester Daniels and his wife as they live under the same tavern together. Daniels is a devout Christian who's trying to save Sadie from a life of sin. But the rest of the plot is a confusing mess. The acting is bad and many of the sex scenes were short.

The Seductress is the story of political blackmail, but it devolved into a one-note plot where everybody is blackmailing everybody for political leverage. Another issue here is the final scene. Generally in adult films the director saves the best for last with a scorching grand finale, but it was difficult to get engaged with the final scene between David Hamilton (Rock Steadie) and Cody Marjon because Marjon just wasn't attractive.

Neither movies featured any hot sex scenes or had a coherent plot.",1411430400,4,1270,4.763636363636364
