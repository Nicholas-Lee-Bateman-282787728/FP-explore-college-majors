4214489,5,B003X00ZJA,"Great for old airplane buffs like me. A big thank-you to the producer for gathering these old films together in this DVD. There one film (in the B-58 series) that  has loud and distorted sound, but that may have come from the source film itself. Otherwise, I love it.",1410393600,5,267,4.448979591836735

The segments presents information on each bomber from the pov of the time, allowing interesting insights into how these weapon systems were viewed early in their service period.  Some pretty rare footage too, of rest pilots like Yeager and Tex Johnston, X planes, mission films, etc.  All in all a DVD set I enjoyed.",1461456000,3,350,4.898305084745763
