7948595,5,B00005OCL8,This all female review of horror is terrific.  It's like all your favorite old monster mags on the big screen.  Wish there were more of these.  I love the format and all of the information.  The best of the series.,1323216000,,214,4.275
7948596,4,B00005OCL8,"This is the second documentary in a series of three. The DVD runs about 50 minutes and is packed with great footage and juicy horror tid bits. 'Bride of Monster Mania' focuses on the women of horror. I actually learned more from this one than the first DVD and found this ""doc"" to be worthy of any horror fans collection. Elvira is back, not only to introduce the program this time, but to narrate. My only gripe is that with the short length of these features they should have been combined on one DVD to save buyer's of this product shelf space and money.....Oh greed is a terrible thing! :-(",1205280000,3,594,4.409090909090909
7948597,5,B00005OCL8,"I first saw this during AMC's Monsterfest a few years ago. And what took

so long for  female horror characters to be recognized. I bought this a

month ago when I noticed it was available.  This DVD helped as being a guide to discovering other horror movies. And Elvira as host added that touch.  The DVD describes how woman shapped horror movies from the silent films to today.  I do highly recomend this DVD  for all horror fans.",1178409600,3,432,4.461538461538462
