7588896,5,B01A64DV6O,"This movie adaptation of ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" (mainly the first book, though the Tweedles from ""Through The Looking-Glass"" are added in and the famous Cheshire Cat scene was deleted, though the character does appear) has not had the best luck with home video. Most prints are cropped to a 4:3 presentation. There are some non-US versions out there that do present the movie in widescreen, and a couple are reportedly anamorphic. But now, rejoice! There is an anamorphic widescreen version for the US in this DVD on demand release from Amazon and DigiCom. (I mean, yes, I would have preferred that it be released to Blu-Ray,but you just gotta take what's available.)

The picture seems to be neatly sourced from a clean transfer of the film. The picture is encoded on the disc at 720X480p, but will be presented in full widescreen by your player ""stretching"" the picture to 854X480p. Chapter marks are every five minutes, there are no subtitles included.

This is, without a doubt, THE edition for any US fan of the movie to get. Until someone (PLEASE?) makes a Blu-Ray.",1454371200,8,1083,4.880434782608695

8746559,4,B01A64DV6O,"This movie stays very true to Lewis Carroll's source material (though it does add Tweedledee and Tweedledum from the sequel, ""Through the Looking-Glass""), especially the costumes. However, Fiona Fullerton, being 15 years old at the time this was made, is a little too old to play Alice.
I like how this is sourced from a clean transfer of the movie. However, the sound seems a bit muffled (as other reviewers have said) and there is still some film dirt on the video as well as some distortion in the soundtrack, but not as much as on other DVD transfers (most of which are cropped to 1.33:1 pan-and-scan format). I didn't like how the chapters were every five minutes. I also didn't like how this was cropped from the original 2.35:1 aspect ratio to 1.85:1. Also, there's no scene selection menu.
Still, the movie is very enjoyable.",1526947200,,833,4.712328767123288

When I looked at the cover, I knew that this was THE ONE I had to have!  I've never seen the movie again, but remember it fondly.  Out of all of the different versions, this is the one I highly recommend!  It is a trip!",1523923200,,328,3.9846153846153847

8746562,4,B01A64DV6O,"William Sterling's 1972 British version of Lewis Carroll's ""Alice's Adventures In Wonderland"" may not have been the success it deserved to be. But this version did achieve something of a ""cult status"", becoming a staple on local TV Stations. Fans of this version should be delighted with the Widescreen presentation here, which is a BIG improvement over the faded prints in other DVD editions. The film seems like something of a revelation, as you can finally see more of the sets, colors, costumes and fantasy atmosphere.
  William Sterling's version is most faithful to Lewis Carroll's book. The screenplay does unobtrusively add Tweeledum and Tweedledee from the sequel ""Through The Looking Glass."" The film begins on that golden summer afternoon when Charles Dodgson, pen name Lewis Carroll (Michael Jayston), along with his friend Robinson Duckworth, first told the story of ""Alice's Adventures"" to Alice, Lorina, and Edith Liddell. The fantasy begins shortly before Alice (Fiona Fullerton) follows the White Rabbit down the Rabbit hole. Falling asleep on the river bank as a breeze blows a deck of playing cards into the air, Alice magically finds herself in an atmosphere of oversized flowers and assorted other things, and follows the White Rabbit down the Rabbit hole into the upside-down, wacky world of Wonderland.
  15 year old Fiona Fullerton as Alice is supported by a gallery of British character actors as the famous Wonderland characters. Most notably there's Robert Helpmann, Peter Sellers, and Dudley Moore as the Mad Hatter, March Hare, and Dormouse from the Mad Tea Party. There's also Michael Crawford (""Phantom Of The Opera"", ""Hello Dolly!"") as the White Rabbit, Flora Robson (""Withering Heights"", ""Fire Over England"") as the Queen Of Hearts, and Ralph Richardson (""Long Day's Journey Into Night"") as the Caterpillar.
  The 90 minutes film only drags during Alice's two songs and dances with the Mock Turtle and Gryphon. Otherwise, it is delightful. The Songs by John Barry and Don Black include ""Curiouser And Curiouser"", ""You've Got To Know When"", ""The Last Word Is Mine"", ""The Pun Song"" and ""The Me I Never Knew.""",1515369600,2,2139,5.185507246376812
8746563,2,B01A64DV6O,"Let me start with the fact that ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" and ""Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There"" by Lewis Carroll are two of my favourite books of all time.  So why only two stars may you ask?  Well, ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" (1972), a musical film version starring Fiona Fullerton as Alice is done as if where a musical at a theatre which just does not work as a film for me.  The sets and costumes are cheaply done and just look very poor, although, I will give credit to the makeup created by Stuart Freeborn.  The music and singing is not very good and the producer-director William Sterling's directing is even worse.  It was enjoyable seeing Dudley Moore playing the Dormouse and Peter Sellers playing the March Hare but it did not overcome the poor directing.  Tweedledum and Tweedledee where added to the film as well, even though they were only in the second book, ""Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There"", and their appearance in the film does nothing to improve the story or the film.  Overall I found the film to be a great disappointment and I do not recommend it unless you liked the film as a child and want to relive it as some of the other reviewers who liked it seemed to imply.",1513814400,,1250,4.57847533632287
8746564,4,B01A64DV6O,"A very enjoyable version of the Carroll classic.  There are a number of songs, most of which don't add up to much - hence the missing star - but score is by John Barry and is okay.  The costumes appear taken from some of the Tenniel illustrations which I feel is a plus.  There have been many odd versions of this story (like Tim Burton turning the story into a feminist / Dungeons and Dragons fantasy) but this one tends not to wander off from the book very much, if that is important to you.

Fiona Fullerton is so good-looking that having her in almost every scene was far from a burden.  And for the most part she puts across the role of Alice, even if she is, like almost all the actresses who have portrayed her, much older than Carroll's Alice.

I've had two different copies of this production and this one is much superior so this is the product to buy.",1505347200,2,862,4.257668711656442

8746568,3,B01A64DV6O,"Here's the trouble. Yes, the product is in widescreen and it's enhanced for 16:9 televisions--all fine and good. I don't think there's another version like that available in the US. However, here is the definite drawback for me (and for perhaps anyone looking for a TRUE widescreen version). The widescreen-enhanced version on this disc is still not a true widescreen version. Cropping is still evident because the actual transfer of this film is a widescreen on par with ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Titanic"". This can be seen in evidence during the opening credits of this release. What we have thereafter is a cropped picture equal to the widescreen filming of movies like ""Jurassic Park"" or Tim Buton's ""Alice"" film. This doesn't make me happy, at all! I have an Australian DVD of this movie in the true widescreen format and though it's not enhanced for 16:9 televisions, it's still a much better transfer. And as to the picture and sound on this actual product, the film is over 40 years old. It looks it (and perhaps worse) as it has never been restored nor cared for very well. The sound quality isn't great either. I'm not entirely sure of the quality of the other releases of this sadly neglected film, but I didn't find this one to have anything going for it, except that someone somewhere might be happy with this ""widescreen"" version. But first and foremost, it is NOT a true widescreen and the picture and sound quality aren't very good. Sad, because, again, it's a beautiful film and deserves a better release. I'll find something to do with this purchase. Someone might want it, but I won't keep it on MY shelf.",1454457600,5,1627,4.6923076923076925
