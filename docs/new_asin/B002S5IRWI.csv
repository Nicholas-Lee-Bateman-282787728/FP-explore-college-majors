8379081,5,B002S5IRWI,"I bought a Gitane D-hole recently that had some fret buzz. This video was a great help in doing a fret re-dress. I was successful for the most part but next time I will be more patient when crowning the frets. I think the Gitane has small frets and I had a file that was for medium to large frets but managed to get by.
Make sure you have the right tools. The video is pretty complete and Jamie does a good job of explaining everyhthing.",1294531200,2,437,4.093023255813954
