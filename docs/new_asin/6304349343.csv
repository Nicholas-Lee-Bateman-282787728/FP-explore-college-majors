I saw these tapes after seeing a tape of Al with Preston Nichols and another guy (Cameron something?) which was a disappointment and just didn't seem kosher, and these Al Only lecture tapes are far better.

Al on his own is far more professional and plausible, but even so, I wonder about the validity of this info. That Einstein's Unified Field Theory has been cracked is perfectly possible. Free/Over Unity energy and anti-grav tech are a direct relation of this breakthrough.

It is not that I have a problem believing in the possibility of the Philadelphia Experiment, it is just the fact that we only have the word of a handful of people, some of whom are not especially credible, that concerns me. To my knowledge, no actual USS Eldridge crew members have stepped forwards and talked about it, despite all the publicity over the years. Still, the very nature of cover-ups is that there usually isn't any direct evidence - as with Roswell.

Well worth watching, but the quality is sketchy.

7868470,5,6304349343,"AFTER READING THE OTHER REVIEWS, I SAW ONLY ONE THAT REALIZED THAT AL IS THE REAL MCCOY. AL, LIKE MYSELF HAS NOTHING TO GAIN BY TELL THE WORLD WHAT WE LIVED THROUGH. AL STATED THAT HE DIDNT REMEMBER THAT HE WAS INVOLVED IN THE PHILADELPHIA EX. UNTIL DECADES LATER WHEN HE WATCHED IT WITH SOMEBODY ELSE AND THAT IS WHAT CAUSED HIM TO HAVE FLASH BACKS OR MEMORIES OF BEING INVOLVED IN THE PHILADELPHIA EX. THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO ME, I WAS INVOLVED IN A HIGHLY CLASSIFIED MIND CONTROL PROGRAM CALLED M.A.R.S. ""MIND ALTERING and REPROGRAMING STUDY"". AFTER I WAS HAVING THOSE FLASH BACKS FOR WEEKS ON END, THEN I BEGAN HAVING FLASH BACKS ABOUT BEING INVOLVED IN A TIME TRAVEL PROJECT CALLED G.A.L.A.X.Y. ""GALACTIC ADVANCED LIAISON AND XTRA YEARS"". I LIKE AL DO NOT EXPECT THE AVERAGE ARM CHAIR QUARTER BACK AND JERRY SPRINGER CHEERLEADER TO TAKE ME SERIOUSLY, BUT ITS NOT A SUBJECT THAT ILL TALK TO JUST ANYBODY ABOUT EITHER. AL BIELEK IS TELLING THE GODS HONEST TRUTH ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED, THE ONLY PROBLEM  IS JUST LIKE MINE, WE DONT HAVE THE EVIDENCE TO BACK UP OUR STORY. HECK WE WERENT EVEN SUPPOSED TO REMEMBER MUCH LESS BE LET OUT OF THE SERVICE WITH LOTS OF EVIDENCE. I WAS INVOLVED IN G.A.L.A.X.Y. IN LATE 1986 UNTIL JULY OF 1987 AND I DIDNT EVEN START TO REMEMBER MY INVOLVMENT UNTIL THE FALL OF 2004. SO HAVING AVAILABLE EVIDENCE IS NOT VERY REALISTIC. SO WITH ALL THIS IN MIND, AL BIELEK GETS 5 STARS FROM ME. WARD FRAZIER U.S. ARMY PROJECT M.A.R.S. MIND CONTROL SURVIVOR 1984-1986 AND PROJECT G.A.L.A.X.Y.

7868471,5,6304349343,"If you want Star Trek type entertainment don't buy this video.

If you want the truth about mysteries that mankind has wondered about since the very beginning of time with concrete evidence backing it up this video is for you.

Find out what really goes on in secret organizations like the CIA and others which we probably don't even know about.

This guy gives real evidence, places, and names the names of people who were involved with creating a time machine during the 1940s.

This is a video for truth seekers.  It's not a movie with special effects and things like that.  It's a lecture given by someone who was sent 40 years into the future during the 1940s.

There's a lot of evidence that The Philadelphia Experiment really happened.  There's movies called 'The Philadelphia Experiment' but those are re-enactments.  This video is about someone who really experienced it.

7868472,3,6304349343,"This is a remake of a previous movie of the same name.  I purchased this video thinking it was the older version.  Although this film with Michael Pare is interesting, the method of time travel, and the effects used to  create it, were a little too extreme.  The earlier version, with James  Farentine and ? Robert Mitchum?  had a much smoother and more believable  transition through time.  I would certainly love to obtain a copy of the  original.  I would guess the release date to be mid-seventies to  mid-eighties.  Please e-mail me if you know where to find it.",944611200,7,567,4.616161616161616
