8307228,2,B000EGEK3S,"Barrio de Cholos takes place in Tijuana b.c. Mex. Not everyone has been to Tijuana and lived amongst its people to understand their culture, let alone understand the cholos of ""Tijuas"". With that said, this film was made for a very distinct group of people, those who want to be taken to Tijuana through a movie, may it be because they've been there before and enjoyed it, or it can just be for many reasons. Like Duke of Earl (the cholo movie classic), Barrio de Cholos is a low budget film. You can tell right from the beggining, the sound, choreography, but mainly the acting. However, for us who like watching movies about, or even belong to the lowrider/cholo/chicano lifesyle, Barrio de Cholos might be something you will enjoy watching. Don't expect an ""American Me"", or a ""Blood-in-Blood out"", this is stricly a low-budget cult film about, not only cholos, but the cholos of Tijuana. Am I saying that there is a diffence in Cali cholos, to Tijuana cholos? Yes, there is a difference. They mainly speak spanish only and use terms like, ""morro/morra, la revu, etc..."".
To finish this critique, let me say that I personally was patient with the ""low-budget"" qualities of this film, and actually really liked the movie. I lived in Tijuana back in my cholo days of the early 90's. This movie took me back to those times that I really miss. If you are an ol' school cholo, you'll probably like this movie.",1202601600,,1407,4.6546184738955825
