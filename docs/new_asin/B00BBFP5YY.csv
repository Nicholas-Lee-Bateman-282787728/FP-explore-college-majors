5570126,3,B00BBFP5YY,"This is a story about all of us having elements of good and bad in us. It is about forgiveness and the choices we make. Teacher Sara (Saye Yabandeh) has had a violent past and her nightmare hasn't ended being in a bad part time relationship with Riley (Travis Johns). Derek (Corey Sevier) lives with Parker (Vince Lozano) and has hit rock bottom.

***Midpoint Plot Spoiler***

During a robbery Derek shoots Sara. She loses her child. He can't live with the guilt. He meets his victim and allows himself to become her abused slave. The scenes are interlaced with flashbacks of her personal abuse as we see where she gets her ideas to abuse Derek. Mario Van Peebles plays an investigating officer with his own personal axe to grind.

The theme is over riding in the film. Derek is constantly asking himself ""How did I get her?"" to the point of ad nauseum. The rape scenes were violent and intense. I felt uneasy watching them. While that may have been the intent of the director, I really don't like paying someone money to make me feel that way. The actors did a good job. The juxtaposition of Sara as victim and Sara as ""punisher"" was good, but could have been expanded.

A film clearly not for everyone.

8565339,1,B00BBFP5YY,"Awful film. It has some of the worst acting I've ever seen. Nothing on it seems interesting, new or just ok as the script moves constantly between terrible and beyond bad.

The cinematography is so amateur that it looks like a youtube video shoot with an Iphone and most of the footage is so poorly directed that even in the most ""dramatic"" scenes this looks like an involuntary comedy. While I was watching the story was so confusing I was unable to even understand what was going on, and the few things that I got were just so unoriginal and uninteresting that at some point I just stop caring.",1499731200,,596,4.467889908256881

8565345,1,B00BBFP5YY,"After watching this piece of ""  "" I had to write a review. This is the worst movie I have seen in the 62+ years that I have been on this planet. There cannot be another movie worse than this. The story was absurd as well as predictable. She'a wearing lipstick in a Islamic Country so rape is inevitable. Now when this female beats up this male and makes him her slave I said to myself she wants a sex slave because of what has happened to her and guess what? The entire movie I said to myself this woman is sick and it had nothing to do with the rape or I think the killing of her sister. The acting was so horrible I could not believe during the filming someone had to say to themselves are maybe even out loud this takes ""  "" to another level. How could Mario Van Peebles stomach this piece of ""  "" What was going on with her lips?",1412553600,,833,3.9760479041916166
