8687162,5,B00P9X37RG,"If you've ever felt like you were the only one around who was trying to make something and no one else even understood why you were trying, this is the movie for you. It shows you that there are people out there doing things like you and that you can develop a community, even if it's mostly online. The film is a documentary that looks at the creative lives of a bunch of different women across the US who are mostly creating on their own but by creating a community of support also learn to collaborate. It's an inspiring look at how creatives can find their people across vast distances and create a supportive and vibrant community.",1470182400,,636,4.444444444444445

8687164,5,B00P9X37RG,"We think of artists as tortured souls locked in garrets, but Jen Lee's beautiful film exposes the truth - that finding your community, collaborating, and opening yourself up is a far richer experience. When you finish listening (and watching) these amazing artists discuss their work together, you'll be ready to find your own kindred amongst the independent artists in your area and in the virtual community. Purchase this, and then invite your friends over to join you in watching.",1422230400,2,483,5.1265822784810124

However. this film goes beyond letting creatives know they are not alone. It encourages us to work together to create new and beautiful things. Thank you Jen for sharing this with us, you and the artists in the film created a beautiful thing...together.",1420329600,2,404,4.690140845070423

As a writer and artist who has made dear friends in my online communities seeing how these women came together in friendship and partnership, in collaboration, to do incredible work is nothing short of awe-inspiring. Colorful, delightful, wonderful conversations, amazing women, you don't want to miss this!",1415577600,4,448,4.986666666666666
