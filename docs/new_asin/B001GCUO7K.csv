3598926,4,B001GCUO7K,"I went to see Monsters Vs. Aliens, and to my surprise I was really entertained by the movie and its characters. I will not spoil the story for all of you that have not seen it yet. But I will tell you a little about the story and the characters.

The main character of the movie is a girl named Susan Murphy (Reese Witherspoon). She is about to get married, when she is suddenly hit by a meteor. She begins to grow in size, finally reaching a height of 49 feet 11 inches. She is captured by the U.S. Army and transported to a secret goverment base. She is given the name Ginormica.

The dumbest monster of the group is B.O.B. (Seth Rogen) He is very funny and very dumb, which makes him a very amusing character. He is often saying stupid things at the wrong time (which makes him very funny).

The smartest one of the group is none other than Dr. Cockroach, Ph. D. (Hugh Laurie). He is very useful in their battles against the evil alien villian Gallaxar (Rainn Wilson). He has a nasty appetite for garbage. He was a man who experimented on himself with a machine, giving him the appearence and ability of a cockroach.

One of the coolest monsters among the group is The Missing Link (Will Arnett). He acts like a jock out of his prime, even though he is over 20,000 years old. He is actually very entertaining and funny. He is the best friend of the next character.

Insectosaurus is a giant 300 foot tall fuzzy larva. He is basically a parody of Mothra mostly, with a hint of Godzilla as well. Insectosaurus' best friend is the Missing Link, but the giant is willing to put its life on the line to protect his friends, especially Susan. Another great character of the team.

The plot of Monsters Vs. Aliens is predictable, but the movie makes up for it my being very funny and action packed! It is a great family movie and will entertain all ages. So, if you are looking for an entertaing treat of a movie, then go see Monsters Vs. Aliens.

P.S., If you are a Godzilla fan, go see this movie. Insectosaurus does something that might intrest all of you Mothra fans out there. Anyways, Monsters Vs. Aliens is a good movie. Go see it and enjoy the show.",1238371200,16,2153,4.340796019900497
3598927,4,B001GCUO7K,"Monsters Vs. Aliens is a thoroughly enjoyable animated 3-D film from Dreamworks that has lot going for it: Top-notch animation, a stellar voice-over cast and a very entertaining and engrossing story in which monsters (all of them cleverly based on 1950's B-movie creatures and characters) fight for the Earth as good guys against an attacking wave of alien robots.

After young bride-to-be Susan Murphy (voiced by Reese Witherspoon) is struck down by a rogue meteorite in Modesto, California on her wedding day, she incredibly grows in size at the altar to 50 feet tall (she's based on the title character from the 1954 flick 'Attack of the 50 Foot Woman') and is promptly apprehended by the military. She is subsequently taken to a top-secret, clandestine government facility deep underground where other creatures have been captured and housed by the government since the 50's. During this time, Susan is given her new identity and codename, Ginormica. Within the compound, she meets an amorphous blue protoplasm named B.O.B. (voiced by Seth Rogen, based after 'The Blob'(1958)), a super-intelligent, half-man/half-cockroach mutant known as Dr. Cockroach (Hugh Laurie doing a cinematic take on Vincent Price) and an amphibious, half-man/half-fish creature, Link (voiced by Will Arnett), obviously patterned after 'The Creature from the Black Lagoon'(1954). The facility also houses a gigantic mutant named Insectosaurus (a strange combination of Godzilla and Mothra) who dwarfs even Susan/Ginormica at 350 feet tall.

Turns out, the meteorite that gave Susan her enormous size and strength was a piece of an extremely powerful element known as Quantonium, whose rightful owner, a ruthless alien despot known as Galaxhar (Rainn Wilson), will stop at nothing to reclaim. After Galaxhar deploys an enormous, hostile alien robot probe on Earth, Susan/Ginormica and the other monsters are commisioned by their captor, General W.R. Monger (Kiefer Sutherland) to fight off the alien attacker in exchange for their release. The motley group led by Ginormica agrees and the team takes on the gigantic monstrosity running amok in San Francisco in a thrilling (and very funny) passage that climaxes on the Golden Gate Bridge. The group succeeds and are temporarily hailed as heroes, but Susan and the others find themselves unable to adjust to life on the outside after their release. The monsters are feared and shunned among Susan's home community and Susan herself is dumped by her self-promoting former fiance, Derrick. Meanwhile, Galaxhar is not easily detered and plots an all-out, full-scale invasion upon Earth to recover the Quantonium. The group must then get back together to infiltrate Galaxhar's mothership high in Earth's stratosphere in a thrilling, do-or-die final mission.

Monsters Vs. Aliens has a very good plot, great characters and is chock full of plenty of humor that works whether you are 10 years old or 40 years old. In fact, the other film it reminds me the most of is 'Ghostbusters' (1984), in the fact that both films have such wonderful humor and excellent comic relief juxtaposed with really harrowing, dangerous and sometimes scary situations. It has good characterization as well and although Susan's character of Ginormica is arguably the star, it's B.O.B. the Blob who gets most all of the film's best lines and moments. I found myself laughing and enjoying this real crowd-pleaser alot and I'm sure it is certain to entertain both children and their parents, too.

Be sure to look for a very funny moment early in the film in which the scene-stealing character of goofy U.S. President Hathaway (voiced by the Daily Show's Stephen Colbert) attempts to make first contact with the alien robot probe by playing out the tune of Harold Faltermyer's 'Axel F' to it on an electronic keyboard! Funny stuff!",1238284800,6,3826,5.236541598694943
3598928,4,B001GCUO7K,"Wonderfully inventive characters and highly polished visuals abound in Dreamworks' latest computer animation extravaganza, working diligently to disprove the concept that story is the most important element. With hilarious caricatures, gargantuan CG sets, and grandiose action sequences, it almost succeeds. But ultimately the aesthetics can't win out over an expected plot, hit-or-miss humor, and characters whose personalities don't live up to their appealing appearances (as well as quite a few underused voice talents, such as the tragically unrecognizable Renee Zellweger, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd).

On her wedding day (in Fresno California, the most romantic city in the world), Susan Murphy (Reese Witherspoon) is hit by a meteorite infused with Quantonium, a rare and powerful element that causes her to grow to an enormous size. Targeted by the government as a ""monster,"" Susan is captured and imprisoned at a secret facility where other such oddities have been held since the 1950's, when it was deemed that the public couldn't handle the presence of extraterrestrials. Governed by Patton-esque General Monger (Kiefer Sutherland), the tenants include Dr. Cockroach (Hugh Laurie), a mad scientist who accidentally transformed himself into a roach-human hybrid; B.O.B. (Seth Rogen), a gelatinous, brainless mass brought to life in an experiment gone wrong; The Missing Link (Will Arnett), a Creature-from-the-Black-Lagoon-like lizard man; and the skyscraper-sized mutant larvae Insectosaurus.

When deranged alien overlord Gallaxhar (Rainn Wilson) arrives on Earth to obtain the precious Quantonium and conquer the world, President Hathaway (Stephen Colbert) offers the monsters their freedom in exchange for defeating the evil mastermind and his legion of robots and clones. ""Do something violent!"" commands the trembling American leader, after giving an ineffective welcoming to a towering probe droid. (In a spoof of Close Encounters of the Third Kind, the President unleashes a series of jazzy funk beats and dance moves that tops the hilarity with its wild spontaneity.)

Pixar may be the heavyweight champion of computer animated feature films, but Dreamworks Animation is steadily making its way into the ring. With Monsters vs. Aliens, they've gotten the formula down pat - exhilarating action, amazing special effects, humorous character designs and a relatively preach-free plot. The intensity of the film is extraordinary, with an attack on the Golden Gate Bridge matching the sheer magnitude of destruction in Cloverfield and challenging the awe of Independence Day and Godzilla. The throwbacks to classic B-movie monstrosities form an homage collage that rivals the research put into The Incredibles' comic book character origins.

Although Monsters vs. Aliens doesn't offer a noticeably large number of literally in-your-face moments, seeing it in 3D (and/or IMAX) certainly doesn't hurt. No details are spared with the absolutely brilliant CG models and animation, and the textures and lighting are consistently photorealistic. It may not rank amongst the greatest computer animated works, but in its technical mastery and pure entertainment achievements, it's out of this world.

The good guys - the ""monsters"" are typically-likable as you see in other animated films of today. They are pretty funny, too, diverse ""monsters"" like ""Dr. Cockroach, B.O.B and The Missing Link. They, along with ""Ginormica,"" who does her impression of the 1950s sci-fi character, ""The F-Foot Woman,"" are appealing and fun to watch.

I'm tempted to describe this movie as ""innocent,"" because it's such a nice story that doesn't have all the innuendos some other animated films have, yet still will make most adults laugh in many spots because there is some good humor that kids wouldn't get. ""Monsters Versus Aliens"" shows one doesn't need ""edginess"" in every movie to have adults enjoy the kids' film, too.

Acting wise, I adored Reese Witherspoon (Susan)  and Seth Rogan (Bob).  I though they were perfect in their roles.  I thought Raine Wilson (Galentor sp? evil alien)  was ok, He came off as a generic cartoon bad guy for the most part.

The movie is decent. The visuals look amazing. They did a great job in the edit room.  The script and film design is obviously for the whole family as there are comedy bits for kids and some for adults.  Seth Rogan (Bob) was funny I enjoyed when his character was on screen.

3599820,5,B001GCUO7K,"No argument Monsters vs. Aliens is one of the best animated 3D I have
seen.  I would go as far as saying that it sets the benchmark but
it's plagued with a problem that I will get into in a few moments
(though I am certain you can guess what it is already).

Monsters vs. Aliens is a lively, highly entertaining animated film
that gives nods to such famous classic ""B"" horror movies including
Attack of the 50 Foot Woman and Mothra.

Susan (Reese Witherspoon) is about to marry the man of her
dreams, a self-centered local weatherman -- that is, until she
is hit by a meteorite from space which causes her to grow to
monstrous size.  The government seizes her and locks her up
with other monsters considered to be of her own kind.  There's
the Jello-like B.O.B. (Seth Rogan), Dr. Cockroach (Hugh Laurie),
Insectosaurus and and The Missing Link (Will Arnett).  All are
destined to be imprisoned for life, that is, until an evil alien named
Gallaxhar (Rainn Wilson) threatens Earth's existence and the only
hope of survival is through these unaccepted creatures.

Let's get to it.  Monsters vs. Aliens on 3D Blu-ray is everything
you could hope for out of this format.  Exceptional, perfect picture
quality, enriched with colors, where you can see detail down to
individual strands of hair.  3D depth and separation is at the moment
unmatched by any other animated title I have reviewed.  Just
when I thought I had seen the best that 3D can offer, along comes
this title.  It just blows away everything else that is out there for
now (prior to the release of Avatar).

I am even basking in the fact that there is a considerable amount
of ""In Yo' Face"" 3D leaping off the screen although within the first 5
minutes of the film it's pure gimmickry.  Fingers reach out at you,
TV antenna's and the barrels of alien guns protrude right off the
screen.

...but that's not even the most remarkable aspect of the 3D.
Just take a look at moments like when General Monger (Keifer
Sutherland) is flying around on his jet pack.  It's as if he's hovering
in mid-air apart from everything that is placed around him.  This
is the kind of stuff that people need to watch to be sold on the
format.

But here's the problem that prevents Monsters vs. Aliens
from being called the current benchmark 3D:  ghosting.

Back in February Adam Gregorich, Kevin Collins and I
looked at this title being demoed at a Samsung 3D event.
All of us saw ghosting that at the time we thought was more
inherent to the LCD/LED hardware (though we also suspected
transfer problems).  The ghosting was much less noticeable
on plasma displays which is why we ultimately chose plasma
as the best way to watch 3D.

However, now that I am watching the film in its entirety,
I notice several scenes that have ghosting problems.  Most
of it happens in dark scenes though on the day-lit scene upon
the Golden Gate Bridge I can still see ghosting within the
bridge cables.

It's a shame.  Most of the bright scenes are so crisp and
razor sharp that the 3D just pops out at you.  The overall
presentation is so monumental that you almost can forgive
the ghosting problems.

Perhaps there can be a total remaster of this film done
when the release goes public.  One of the main reasons I
mention this is because of the audio.  This disc features
a dolby digital 5.1 track but no lossless audio.  This is a
huge loss because the mix is as engulfing as the imagery.
There are so many effect sounds whizzing around the
viewer's head.  I mean, the audio is potent but if there is
the potential to liven it up, by all means the studio should.",1453075200,3,3586,4.530326594090202

Here's a summary: Susan, is a bride to be, but on the big day she gets smashed by a meteorite that changes her into The Fifty Foot Woman. Soon she is captured and placed with other ""monsters"" that are being confined in a top secret installation. It looks like poor Susan and her fellow monsters will spend their lives as prisoners. ...until an alien probe sent by the evil ""Galaxar"" lands and starts to tear Fresno California to pieces. The government decides to pit their monsters against the alien invasion. The ensuing battle is entertaining. It's heroic! It doesn't matter what age you are, this is a cool vid. I loved it.

3600474,5,B001GCUO7K,"Just finished watching this with my wife and our 3 year old son. LOVED this movie! Not just for kids. There was definitely a lot of humor in there for the parents which kids would not understand (but wouldn't mind). Visually it looked amazing on our HD TV. We have a 3D LG TV and I didn't know there was a 3D version at the time I purchased this. The 2D version was only $4 used including shipping so who cares! The 3D version would have been over $20. I'll pick it up later. My wife and I generally don't like the same types of movies and we both laughed a lot together during this movie. I love sci-fi/action, she likes comedy-romance and cheesy family movies. The two of us being able to equally enjoy a silly animated sci-fi flick like this was very cool. With our son mind you! We are careful what our son watches. There were a few parts we thought might be too scary for him, just one or two of the action sequences, but when we asked he said ""It's scary... but I like this movie!"". All was good and the three of us made it to the end and felt pretty good about the hour and a half we spent watching this together. For $4, are you kidding? Money well spent. I can definitely see us watching it again at some point.",1415836800,,1220,4.130252100840337

3600730,5,B001GCUO7K,"Susan is a young bride to be, getting ready for her big day when a meteor strikes her and she finds herself glowing and growing out of proportion, becoming almost fifty feet tall. The military arrives soon after and after she is sedated, she awakes and finds herself locked away in a top secret facility along with other monsters who are either missing links or the subjects of experiments past and her name has been changed to Ginormica. At first, she is definitely not okay with it, and is more than anxious to get back to the life she had, but over time finds the monsters she is held with are not quite the monsters they appear to be as they begin to get acquainted. A chance for freedom arises when the monsters are asked to take on a giant alien robot and they set out for the Golden Gate Bridge where Susan earns her place as Ginormica as she almost single handedly takes it on in order to save the people on the bridge. They defeat the robot and earn their freedom at last, but when Susan tries to reconnect with her old life she discovers the man she almost married is on a fast track to promotion and considers her being a monster a big detriment to his future success and he wants nothing more to do with her. The other monsters find freedom has a hollow ring to it as well, because they aren't really accepted anywhere. It is here that Susan has found her calling as a monster--and is kidnapped by the alien seeking to gain the element that gives Susan her powers and to invade and conquer her world. The monsters then must band together to save one of their own, and stop the invasion, if they can. The monsters here are all straight from the B-movies of the Fifties, B.O.B. is a thinly disguised Blob, Dr. Cockroach is straight from ""the Fly"". The Missing Link is ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" and Insectasaurus, is from ""Mothra."" Ginormica is from ""Attack of the 50 ft. Woman"" . This is meant to be a parody and the movie pulls it off rather well. While this may not be on a par with other movies by DreamWorks, it is still fun to watch and worth a look.",1393632000,,2072,4.315384615384615

3600888,1,B001GCUO7K,"This movie was a monstrous disappointment for me. The first trailer I saw I said, I want to see that movie.  I sat down in the theater anticipating what great colorful experience I was about to behold. I admit, for the first few minutes, I was happy as could be, but then the movie started. It starts out pretty decent from what I remember but somewhere in there it begins to take a nose dive, crashes and burns, then crashes again. The story to the film is just there as a side attraction to the monstrosity consuming the screen. The short films spawned off of this film aren't half bad though, I can recommend those. I believe the difficult part for those behind this movie was developing a plot to use the time allotted for a movie.

The story itself keeps you intrigued and the lead character who has set her mind on ""the wrong guy"" figuring that out as she gains personal confidence throughout the movie is a fan pleasing touch.",1377043200,,380,4.323943661971831

3601167,4,B001GCUO7K,"With a child who's in that era of watching his favorite movies over and over again, it is nice to have a movie that is fun and age appropriate for him but also lacking in irritating characters and negative messages.  Monsters versus Aliens highlights the qualities of friendship and acceptance while remaining really fun to watch.  For grown-up fans of classic monster movies there is a lot to like and some genuinely funny moments as well as nods to some classic movie scenes even beyond the 60's monster/sci-fi genre.  I also think this is a great movie that conveys, in a subtle way, a positive message for girls about being their own person in addition to being caring about others.  The voice talent behind the characters is excellent and it is fun to see how the movie characters' facial expressions really resemble those used by the actors themselves in their other screen roles.",1375401600,2,886,4.771241830065359

3601170,5,B001GCUO7K,Another hit from Dreamworks. I enjoy well animated movies that make your eyes pop because of the attention to details but they must also have a good story. This movie is truly enjoyable especially to the much younger crowd. The characters are hilarious & the kids will surely enjoy them. Two monster thumbs up!!,1374969600,,311,4.777777777777778

I was skeptical at first, but when I realized that Elizabeth Witherspoon was doing the voice of the main character I thought that I'd give it a chance.  I haven't regretted it!

3601248,5,B001GCUO7K,"""Monsters Vs. Aliens"" is great! This is how the story goes: When California girl Susan Murphy is unwittingly clobbered by a meteor full of outer space gunk on her wedding day, she mysteriously grows to 49-feet-11-inches tall. Alerted to the threat of this new monster, the military jumps into action and Susan is captured and secreted away to a covert government compound. There, she is renamed Ginormica and placed in confinement with a ragtag group of other monsters: the brilliant but insect-headed Dr. Cockroach, Ph. D.; the macho half-ape, half-fish The Missing Link; the gelatinous and indestructible B.O.B.; and the 350-foot grub called Insectosaurus. Their confinement is cut short, however, when a mysterious alien robot lands on Earth and begins storming the country. In a moment of desperation, The President is persuaded by General W.R. Monger to enlist the motley crew of Monsters to combat the Alien Robot and save the world from imminent destruction.

The voice cast led by Reese Witherspoon (as Susan / Ginormica), Seth Rogen (as B.O.B.), Hugh Laurie (as Dr. Cockroach, PhD) & Will Arnett (as The Missing Link) is excellent! The directing by Conrad Vernon (who also directed ""Shrek 2"" (2004) & Rob Letterman (who also co-wrote the screenplay and directed ""Shark Tale"" (2004) (both who also wrote the story) is great! The story by Vernon & Letterman & the screenplay by Letterman, Maya Forbes, Wallace Wolodarsky (both who also did the screenplay to ""The Rocker"" (2008, which starred Rainn Wilson, who is the voice of Gallaxhar), Jonathan Aibel & Glenn Berger (who also co-produced and wrote the screenplay to ""Kung Fu Panda"" (2008) is great!

The music by Henry Jackman is great! The film editing by Joyce Arrastia (who also did the film editing to ""Shrek The Third"" (2007) & Eric Dapkewicz (who also did the film editing to ""Flushed Away"" (2006) is great! The animation and visuals are excellent!

This is a great animated film that keeps DreamWorks Animation's winning streak running on hot. An excellent voice cast led by Reese Witherspoon makes this an interesting choice of a computer-animated picture. This is probably an early Oscar contender for Best Animated Film.",1369526400,,2189,5.091922005571031

3601313,2,B001GCUO7K,After receiving this movie in the mail I couldn't wait to watch it with my son ( 3 yrs.old) . I thought it was a funny movie (like Mosters Inc.) with a few scary parts age-appropriate for kids his age! After watching the first 20min. he started being scared and started crying. So this movie will have to be put up until he is a little bit older and understands the scary parts better. Bummer!,1367193600,,393,4.253333333333333

3601378,4,B001GCUO7K,I thought that this movie was great. it was fun and exciting. You could relate to the characters as real people who are miss understood. in the end it showed that you can ge along if you taae time to communicate.,1366243200,,212,4.195121951219512

3601575,5,B001GCUO7K,"Reese Witherspoon is such a likable character as the lead voice. I immediately harkened back to the 1950s movies ""Attack of the 50 Foot Woman and The Blob. The monsters in this DVD are not threatening to the humans (just like Disneys Monsters Inc. movie) but the aliens sure are. I chuckled at the military allying with the monsters to protect Earth. The initial battle looked like a repeat of Independence Day. This is a movie to let your imagination run free without logic and not meant to to taken seriously.",1358726400,,511,4.626373626373627

3601639,4,B001GCUO7K,"This movie is a good movie. I got it for my 7 year old and I guard what he watches carefully.  He loved it, the monsters and aliens were great, the anime was great... My only reason for saying that I like it and not love it is that I do guard what my child sees very carefully and I, myself, prefer to have a little less graphic ""expression"" drawn into the female characters"" physic these days and less romantic suggestions written into the storyline. I accept a little but this movie was just a pinch over what I consider acceptable for my young child to watch without concern.  (Yes, I do feel 7 yrs old is still a little young for that stuff)  The movie isn't filled with it so it just takes a little patience, tolerance, or fast forwarding for any parent that is concerned.  This aside, its a cute movie.",1357689600,,808,4.261437908496732

3601647,5,B001GCUO7K,The film is rated PG and I agree that a parent should watch this movie with a small child to see how the child is reacting.  If the child doesn't appear to be upset; great.  If there seems to be some discomfort with some of the scenes I would suggest putting the dvd away until the child is a little older.,1355875200,,306,4.0
3601668,4,B001GCUO7K,"The shipping blew my mind from the seller, it was second day and awesome. The movie is cute. Funny story and a few moments of pure laughing at the stupidity and genius of the writers. Other parts were a little bit old and less educated thinking moments. The problem with this movie is it's watch about once every year (if your in a crazy-stupid mood) movie.

Bottom line this is a nice compilation of older 'horror' movies, and conspiracy theories re-made to show our already over-media fed generation.",1355788800,,502,4.704545454545454

And Hugh Laurie (Dr. House) is awesome as Dr. Cockroach. And hahahahah Steve Colbert is great as the President lol. It can be a bit cheesy at times but so worth the viewing. :) I've seen it many times and enjoy it more and more each time. The graphics are great as well.,1352332800,,405,4.139240506329114

3601725,4,B001GCUO7K,"I have to admit i was not impressed by this movie the first time watched it. I don;t know what we were expecting, maybe a funny Shrek-type movie as the kids ones nowadays seem to have a lot of adult humor as well as for kids, to keep us all entertained. I thought the storyline and script were kind of so-so, and it just didn't have that wow factor for me. HOWEVER -- the second time my 3 year-olds wanted to watch it, i thought it was better for some reason. Maybe because i knew the storyline and what to expect. I like Reese Witherspoon, and i think the main character is very likeable because she supplies the voice. I would recommend it for young kids, no scary scenes, and very likeable characters. A decent movie for little ones.",1352073600,,736,4.302158273381295

3601825,4,B001GCUO7K,"This amusing and kid-safe bit of fluff makes me wish for a rainy Saturday and a bucket of popcorn. It starts off tamely enough, with Our Heroine preparing herself for the white wedding of every girl's dreams. At the very last instant, that goes horribly awry - providing a cringeworthy moment for anyone who's seen last minute catastrophes at big family events.

In a moment, Susan transforms from the princess in the fairy tail to the monster. At this point, cue the secret military lab, self-important general, and aliens promised by the movie's title. Mousy habits of a lifetime die hard, but Monster Susan really comes into her own as the battle progresses, and discovers a lot more in herself than she or anyone had ever seen.

""Anyone"" includes the fiance that dumped her at the altar when 'for better or worse' got worse than he bargained for. But, now that Susan is something really special, he's suddenly willing to give her another chance at boosting his career. Susan has a career of her own now (monstering and saving Earth), and realizes she can do better than him. I like the message: a girl doesn't have to settle for any jerk just so she can have a boyfriend. So, if you have a kid, a rainy afternoon, and a yen for popcorn, give this movie a try - but remember, the kid is optional.

3601904,5,B001GCUO7K,"I was impressed with Steve Colbert as president. His TV persona showed through in this left of center satire on monster and alien movies. It is a movie that parents will find entertaining as well.

There is a reference to Susan's boobies and a scene where the military man scans his butt to enter a room. That is pretty much the extent of objectionable material. The movie starts out with Susan getting married in a Unitarian(?)church (no Christian symbols) when she is struck by a meteorite which turns her into the 50 foot woman. The military subdues her like Lilliputians and imprisons her with other monsters (interment camp).

When an alien robot attacks the earth, the monsters are let loose to save the planet and win their freedom in return. If your kids liked Mars Attacks, they will enjoy this movie. I know I did and so did my grandniece (third-fourth grade).",1343692800,2,870,4.717105263157895
3601905,5,B001GCUO7K,"This is definitely one of Dreamwork's best CGI films! (IMHO)

This movie is pretty much 2 stories that merge into one.

The first is about the destruction of an alien planet, & a meteor from it's destruction, which crashes on earth. An alien that caused this planet to blow-up, named Galaxar, tracks this meteor to earth, in an attempt to retrieve it.

The second storyline is about a woman named Susan Murphy, who gets hit by this meteor right on her wedding day, as it crashes to Earth. The contents of the meteor, (or perhaps more accurately, meteorite), contains a substance which we later find out is called ""Quontonium"". The ""Quontonium"" causes Susan not only to grow to an gigantic height, her hair to turn from brunette to white, but also endows her with incredible strength.

After being captured by the military, Susan is taken to a hidden military installation, (which we later find out is the area known as Area 51-a bit that is played up for laughs), & encounters a rather unlikely group of 4 other monsters, who she is initially terrified of, but quickly develops a close friendship with.

But all Susan really cares about is being returned to normal size, & returning to her fiance', who we find out later is more concerned about his career, instead of her. But we see that she quickly accepts her ""condition"", & with the help of her other monster friends, succeeds in defeating Galaxar.

What makes this movie so enjoyable is the characterizations of each of the people. They are all so completely different. Not to mention almost non-stop action, which keeps the viewer attentive for virtually the entire movie.

There is also a great deal of humor in this movie-much of it coming from the blue blob which is named B.O.B.

The character of Galaxar, voiced by actor Rainn Wilson, is determined to reacquire the ""quontonium"" that he feels Susan has ""stolen"" from him. He intends to use it to conquer earth.

Galaxar is suitably evil, but sometimes is not always in complete control of everything, as we have so often as we have seen other evil characters. He underestimates the monsters determination to help Susan, & this is all played up for laughs.

Susan is voiced by actress Reese Witherspoon. Despite her height, she doesn't want to accept being considered a ""monster"", & is constantly having one of her fellow monsters, a mad scientist named Dr. Cockroach, experiment on her, in an attempt to return her to being normal size. But in the end, she turns out to be a real hero after all.

Dr. Cockroach, is voiced by ""HOUSE"" actor Hugh Laurie. A brilliant, (though '""mad""), scientist, he was experimenting on trying to give man the cockroaches ability to survive, only, to be turned a human cockroach himself. Among the other monsters, he is the voice of reason & order. The ""mad"" characteristic is also prevalent in his mad scientist laugh, & the crazy inventions that he comes up with.

The Missing Link, (similar to the creature, from the movie ""Creature from the Black Lagoon""), is voiced by actor Will Arnett. He fancies himself as being the ""tough guy"" in the group, but usually ends up really not helping very much-more often getting injured in some way. But he really does have a kind heart. He is also good friends with another one of the monsters, a 350 foot tall bug, known as Insectasaurus.

Insectasaurus, (who initially was a small grub, that after being exposed to a nuclear accident, goes on a rampage & almost destroys Tokyo), before being captured, doesn't really speak, but more or less roars & makes other sounds, that only seem to be understood by the Missing Link, who is sort of a best friend to Him. When she first encounters him, Susan is initially terrified of Insectasaurus, but later in the movie, comes to regard him as a friend as much as the other monsters, & we see him being loyal to her as well.

General W.R. Monger, (a play on the term ""war monger""), is voiced by actor Kiefer Sutherland. A die-hard military man, he is always up for a good battle, & shows no fear. He is in charge of the secret military instillation where the monster are imprisoned, but is never really mean to the monsters. When one of Galaxar's giant robot probes starts to cause chaos, he is the one who suggests using his monsters to fight it, as the military has not been able to stop it. He is always prepared for any eventuality.

B.O.B. (voiced by actor Seth Rogen), is basically a big blue blob that was created in, (according to the movie), a food facility, by combining a tomato with a ranch-flavored seasoning. He has no brain, & only one eye, & can change himself into almost any shape. Not having a brain, B.O.B. is not terribly intelligent, which is played up for laughs throughout the movie, & is constantly being corrected by both the Missing Link, & Dr. Cockroach. But like the other monsters, he too is very loyal to helping Susan out when she needs it the most.

Derek Dietl, (voiced by actor Paul Rudd), is Susan's fiance'. He is a self-absorbed newsman/weatherman/sportscaster who is really only interested in his rise to be a network newsman, & Susan's height is a deterrent to achieving that.

The part of the President of the United States is voiced, (very appropriately), by political satirist, Stephen Colbert. He is somewhat overconfident in his dealing with the space probe that was initially sent by Galaxar, & is the one who orders Monger to use his monsters to combat it. But more than once, he is on the verge of willing to give up. His first initial contact with the robot probe is a hilarious parody of the movie ""Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind. But he flees in the face of danger, especially when he is almost killed by the space probe/robot.

Some of the very funny sequences in the movie are:

The parody of Close Encounters, (which I mentioned above)
Bob's inability to recognize that Susan is a female
Link's attempts to be tough, only to fail
Dr. Cockroach's mad inventions
The war room, where strategies are determined in what to do.
The robot probe chasing Susan through the streets of San Francisco

As stated, the actions sequences are virtually non-stop & very well animated in their detail.

But what really drives this movie is the characters themselves, & their differing personalities.

This movie is a must see for all but the very young animation fans!",1343001600,2,6330,4.683783783783784

Dreamworks continues to prove themselves an ample adversary to Pixar in the realm of digital animation as this movie is a feast for the eyes as well as treat for the funny bone.

Fans of old sci-fi B movies will catch loads of nods to the genre, but no insider knowledge is needed to enjoy this film. A shining moment of this film is when the villain gives his ""big reveal"" speech, except you don't learn anything because his machine prevents you from hearing the key points! The movie is full of fun jabs at old movie tropes like that.

And, of course, there is a ton of action, but it isn't wasted. Real character developing moments occur even in the action sequences, making it all a part of the story rather than an excuse to dazzle.

First, it was very slow in the beginning, even after Susan, the female lead character, gets turned into a giantess with white hair. It seemed like it took a long time for the movie to even get to the monsters, let alone the aliens.

Second, even after all of the monsters were introduced, the movie just wasn't as entertaining or funny as I thought it would be. There were definitely moments that made us all laugh, but not nearly as many as in, say ""Megamind,"" or ""Despicable Me."" The Missing Link monster didn't really add anything to the movie, although BOB managed to come up with some of the funniest lines and we all liked his hitting on a mold of green Jell-O!

Also, it's more of the same as far as gross jokes, weak-willed men, and strong, sexy women -  in a children's movie.

This is a terrific movie. It was a great counter to the failure that was Where the Wild Things Are.

There is a secret government group comprised of monsters. These monsters are released to combat an alien bent on the earth's enslavement.

While this was released in 3D, I was unable to see it in that format.

The voices are provided by: Reese Witherspoon, Seth Rogen, Hugh Laurie, Will Arnett, Kiefer Sutherland, Stephen Colbert and many others.

Casting Colbert as the President was genius. He steals the show. Every single line is laugh out loud. My particular favorite has to do with ""Code Brown"" because he has to change his pants.

Dreamworks has been trying to steal some of the thunder from Pixar for years. This film is great for the entire family to watch and not have to worry about subtle, inappropriate humor.

Note: the 3D in this blu ray is crappy, no where close to ""Avatar"" level. In a 2D version, you lose visually/gimic for what the movie attraction offered in the theater.

3602210,3,B001GCUO7K,"When a radioactive meteor hurtles into Susan Murphy on her wedding day, she is transformed into a towering, platinum-haired giant. Taken away by the government, Susan is introduced to other scientific oddities, including the amphibious Missing Link , the dim blob B.O.B., and the brilliant, bug-headed Dr. Cockroach. These ""monsters"" are released from captivity when a massive alien robot sent by the scheming Gallaxhar appears in San Francisco. With little time to adjust to her new stature, Susan must learn to work with her strange allies to avoid an all-out extraterrestrial invasion.

MVA is what I would call a ""safe"" movie. It's fluffy and nice, but it doesn't push boundaries. It sticks to entertaining the audience for 90 or so minutes and it does the job well. Compared to Pixar's most recent movie, UP, it's pretty much crap, but I won't do that because most animated movies can't reach Pixar's greatness.

MVA starts off pretty quickly and the movie runs in a fast pace. I'll admit it, some of the jokes are plain dumb and unfunny. There's one scene where the president of the US plays a well-known tune when first meeting an alien spaceship. It was cringe-worthy to say the least. However, the movie also has a lot of funny moments, most coming from Seth Rogen's character, B.O.B. He's my favorite character in the movie. The other actors were decent, but nothing to shout about.

The movie also has plenty of great spectacles and some truly vibrant action sequences. I did not see this movie in 3D, but this is one of the few rare movies where watching it in 3D could possibly make it a BETTER movie. As I watched through the movie, I envied the fact that I was watching it in 2D, seeing some obvious shots for the 3D technology when it was in theaters a few months back.

3602211,4,B001GCUO7K,"While it isn't oft publicized, Pixar and DreamWorks have quite a little game of swapping going on that basically started right from the beginning.  Need evidence? Well you know Pixar's Toy Story and DreamWorks had a remarkably similar film in Small Soldiers.  DreamWorks had Antz and Pixar A Bug's Life.  Pixar had Finding Nemo, DreamWorks Shark Tale and so on and so forth.  Pixar led the monster genre with Monsters Inc. but DreamWorks had even bigger ambitions in mind when they decided to enter the game in 2009.

Monsters are good science fiction fun but then again so are aliens.  Rather than choose between the two, DreamWorks wisely opted to pit them against each other in a plot that works way better than the title insinuates possible.  The big gag surrounding this one in its theatrical debut was that it was DreamWorks' first 3D motion picture (a trend that has been slowly gaining momentum of late).  Of course my encounter with this one was limited to the realm of high definition LED display and the power of the BluRay so I cannot comment on the 3D effects in this critique.

The story tells of typical California girl Susan Murphy (Reese Witherspoon) is unwittingly clobbered on her wedding day by a meteor full of mysterious space gunk.  The encounter results in her growing to 49-feet-11-inches tall.

As is expected in a 1950s B-movie spoof, the military jumps into action and captures the freshly mutated girl and transports her to a covert government compound where she is renamed Ginormica.

The confused and abused gentle giant finds herself placed in confinement with a ragtag group of Monsters: the brilliant insect/ mad scientist Dr. Cockroach, Ph. D. (Hugh Laurie); a fish man thawed mid evolution named The Missing Link (Will Arnet); the gelatinous and indestructible B.O.B. (Seth Rogen); and a 350-foot grub known only as Insectosaurus.

Their confinement & governmental study is cut short, however, when a deadly alien robot lands on Earth and begins wreaking havoc upon the planet. In a moment of desperation, the president thanks in no small part to the persuasion of General WR Monger (Kiefer Sutherland) decides to enlist the motley crew of Monsters to combat the Alien Robot and save the world from imminent destruction.

On the surface, it's a pretty decent plot and honestly, the potential for depth or layered plot structure are certainly secondary considerations to the primary goal of presenting really, really impressive visuals and near-constant stabs at humor.  The latter has much to do with the cast even over the writing as it was the adlibbing of Seth Rogen, Will Arnet and Hugh Laurie that manage to inspire the giggles over the in-your-face gags and comedic setups.

The textures, lighting, and rendering are simply stellar throughout (again even discounting the 3D experience) and hold up still even in this ever-advancing industry.  The pacing is fairly consistent if a bit more plodding than what is considered standard fair in the kid-friendly computer animated feature film game.  In fact, with a runtime of 94-minutes, the sensation that it's a bit longer than most films of the sort is no mere illusion.

However, the film comes up a little short in the area of providing the sheer cleverness commonly found in the top entries to the CG-game.  It's got enough humorous moments and visual charm to make the experience rewarding regardless, but the potential for absolute greatness is frequently apparent.

In all Monsters Versus Aliens follows the formula that most of DreamWorks' heavily hyped (exception Kung-Fu Panda and the Shreks) films in that a bit of structure inconsistency takes away from what could be a true top contender.  It's good fun, awesome to behold, and offers up some genuine hilarity at times.  At the end of the day, that's a resume strong enough even for a monster.",1288483200,,3845,4.9734375

Second they blended a love of B monster movies with a ""Dirty Dozen"" idea of prisoners being let out of prison to defeat a greater threat. Third they gave Henry Jackman his first break in scoring the music, who did a fantastic job. Focusing on the character of Ginormica (voiced by Reese Witherspoon) they tell a story of a young woman letting go of her smallness and accepting herself and her true power.

3602270,4,B001GCUO7K,"MVA, at first glance seems like a movie that's typically attempting to capitalise on the growing trend of CGI animated ""comedies"", however, I would personally consider it up there with the likes of Shrek and Toy Story and not down there with the likes of Space Chimps and Fly Me To The Moon, two films which may appeal to kids, but I absolutely hated. These types of movies generally attempt to appeal to both adults and children with different types of comedy which is aimed at kids, and risqu comedy which would appeal to adults and go right over the heads of the kids, not risking the embarrassment of parents having to explain to their kids the adult jokes.

The story focuses around Susan Murphy (Witherspoon) who's hit by a meteorite and is mutated and grows to about 50 feet tall. As a result she is captured and kept in a secret government facility with other monsters; B.O.B. (Seth Rogen), Dr. Cockroach Phd (Hugh Laurie) the missing link (Will Amett) and a giant grub known as insectasaurus. These are kept under lock and key by General W.R. Monger (get it?, voiced by Keifer Sutherland). Meanwhile, in space, an alien known as Galaxar (Rainn Wilson), wants the energy that made Susan a giant and to do it, he's going to send his giant, indestructible robots to do his dirty work.

It really was enjoyable with the typically stupid but brilliant humour that many have come to expect from films of this kind. The message here is to be comfortable in your own skin and recognise your own potential even if, to some, you might be a ""monster"" or a ""freak"" what really matters is what you think of yourself and what you know you're capable of achieving, and it's a message that I really like.

I think 2009 kind of spoiled me, with great (and I mean GREAT) animated films like `Up' and `Coraline', so when I saw `Monsters vs. Aliens' I was let down.  It killed my momentum a little.  That said, when you take it in context it is likable and fun, and certainly suited for the whole family (as apposed to the creepy `Coraline' or the suggestive `Fantastic Mr. Fox').

My daughter and even my wife really liked this.  I thought it was cute (if not totally clichd) but nothing memorable.

Playing much like a rip off of `Mars Attacks' (I need to rewatch that movie again), `Monsters vs. Aliens' revolves around a group of nerdy monsters being kept under wraps by the government until they are needed to fight against some evil aliens who wants his quantonium back.  The monsters are told that if they save the world they can have their freedom, so they take the job.  Among the monsters is Susan Murphy, a young woman who was hit by the meteor on her wedding day and grew to gigantic proportions.  She wants to reunite with her fianc and find a cure, so she is more than willing to leave her prison and fight the aliens.

The film has its moments, but it isn't very memorable to be honest.  There isn't anything here that is going to drive me to watch it again.  To be honest, my daughter watched this and `Coraline' almost back to back and she has been asking me to put on `Coraline' again for days now.  She hasn't mentioned this movie at all.

That said, some of the voice work is funny (mostly from Seth Rogan and Stephen Colbert) and some of the humor is chuckle worthy (especially most anything that comes out of B.O.B.'s mouth).  The animation is standard yet vibrant and engaging, and I'm sure that this film gains some stars when viewed in 3-D (it looks like the type of movie that needs it to survive).

When a giant robot from outer space threatens to destroy all life on Earth, a group of adorable monsters, whose very existence has been kept under raps for decades by the federal government, is deployed to defeat the menace. One of the ""monsters"" is Susan (energetically voiced by Reese Witherspoon), an average California girl who becomes a multi-story giantess after she is hit by a meteorite on the day of her wedding. The save-the-planet mission she is sent on gives her a chance to prove to herself and to those around her that she has what it takes to make a difference in the world.

""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is a minor-league animated effort that is clearly aimed more at the youngsters in the audience than at the adults. Kids will enjoy the cutesy creatures, the frenetic pacing, the bright colors and clean backgrounds, and the nonstop action sequences that make this feel at times almost like a ""Transformers"" for the pre-teen set. And speaking of other movies, the film is stuffed to bursting with cinematic allusions, ranging from ""Close Encounters"" to ""E.T."" to ""The Wizard of Oz"" to ""The Blob"" to ""Attack of the 50-foot Woman"" to ""Dr. Strangelove,"" some of which will be familiar to the kiddies and some of which only the adults in the audience will be able to pick up on.

3602299,4,B001GCUO7K,"This might not be as layered or polished as some, but it's one of the most laugh out loud animations I've seen in a while.  Reese Witherspoon voices Ginormica - the lady who on the day of her wedding is affected by a weird radiation which make her grow 50ft high.  She is then taken by a secret government base headed by a general hilariously voiced by Kiefer Sutherland, to join other `freaks' such as the missing link, B.O.B. the blob, and Doctor Cockroach, all similarly plucked from classic movies for those that know their sci-fi.  When an alien comes to earth threatening its destruction in his quest to obtain something Earth has, Ginormica and her new friends are all the government has to stand in their way.
So much for the plot, it's pretty straightforward and not particularly full of surprises.. but in fact it's the knowing nods and winks to the genre that make this movie a treat, with plenty of gags both visual and scripted to keep you amused.  While the animation is second to the story, and the characters stylised rather than photo realistic, there are moments, such as the Golden Gate Bridge scene, that showcase some excellent animation, particularly in bluray High Def.  Hugh Laurie and Seth Rogen add to the excellent voice cast, making this a well rounded worthwhile buy.
As others have mentioned, the only niggling point is the misleading addition of 3D glasses - the movie theatre version was 3D - this is NOT.  There is an additional short (B.O.B.'s big break) which the 3D glasses are for.

  Monsters vs Aliens had the potential to become a Sci-Fi comedy classic along the lines of a 'Coneheads' or 'Galaxy Quest' but didn't quite make it. There were a few scenes that really hit the mark however, due to the satirical content. My favorite scene was President Hathaway (voiced by Stephen Colbert) trying to make personal contact with the alien robot. The President is depicted as sort of a twisted Madison Avenue Ad exec type from the 60s surrounded by prototypical yes men. First he plays the theme from 'Close Encounters' on a DX7 Yamaha synth and then breaks into Axel F, the theme from the 1984 Beverly Hills Cop movie (the anachronisms just seemed to jell perfectly). When the robot makes it clear that he's not interested in 'peaceful co-existence', President Hathaway just manages to escape with his life. The president's transition from feckless appeaser to impulsive warmonger in a matter of a few minutes is priceless!

  The film's inciting incident draws you in at first. That's where Susan is infected by the meteorite and is transformed into a giant monster on her wedding day. We break into the 'second act' when Susan is transported to the secret government facility where she's imprisoned with other monsters who have been captured over the last fifty years. I just couldn't understand how the secret government monster unit could have so easily muzzled all the guests at the wedding who were witnesses to Susan's amazing transformation. And that especially includes Derek, Susan's social-climbing TV anchor boyfriend, who would have been first in line to promote the media scoop.

  I was further disappointed when we soon learn that the government has 'collected' a total of only four monsters (not including the newly minted Susan, now dubbed 'Ginormica') over the past five decades. And it seemed crazy that such an enormous facility was needed to house such a limited collection (I guess that was the joke--the government was so paranoid about the monsters escaping that they built such a giant facility despite the fact that their prisoners were a completely sorry and ineffectual bunch). The bottom line is that it would have been much more fun if there were more monsters released to combat the invading aliens. The film's scenarists could have worked the additional monsters in without taking away from the principals (the other monsters could have been designated as less intelligent and unable to speak--at the same time, their ineptitude could have been highlighted through various visual scenes without the need for dialogue).

  The monsters of 'Monsters vs Aliens' seem to be created in order to emulate Dorothy's allies in 'The Wizard of Oz'. Susan (having been separated from her family and propelled into a new world) can be likened to Dorothy. Then there's Dr. Cockroach as the brainy Scarecrow, The Missing Link as the Tin Man without a heart and BOB equivalent to the cowardly lion (since this is a comedy, BOB's 'cowardice' is due to stupidity rather than a lack of nerve). And Insectosaurus, the lovable moth, functions as a sort of Toto character, beloved by the protagonist and her allies.

  I found the Monsters to be a rather unfunny lot. There wasn't much difference between the Dr. Cockroach character and the principal villain, Gallaxhar (both had that maniacal laugh). And what about the 'Missing Link'? I guess he was supposed to be some sort of Loch Ness Monster but there was nothing distinctive about his comic persona. BOB, the gelatinous mass, who couldn't think straight, was perhaps the most amusing of the motley trio. The bit about him falling in love with the jello mold was one of the funniest scenes in the entire movie.

  As the Monster vs Alien's plot develops, it becomes obvious that the vapid Susan, who defines herself in relation to the obnoxious Derek, finally gains confidence and is no longer dependent on men to go forward in life. That's her 'internal arc' and I had no problem with the way the story was going in that regard. But the 'external arc' of the story was underdeveloped and derivative. Take for example when Susan first stops the alien robot (but must destroy the Golden Gate Bridge in the process). Although the city of San Francisco had been evacuated, I would have thought that the battle with the alien robot would still have been covered by the news media. The film's screenwriters missed a big opportunity to depict Susan as the new hero and media darling after destroying the alien robot. And for awhile, it would have been nice to see Susan distracted by fame and seduced by the culture of celebrity.

  Finally, Gallaxhar and his spaceship, seemed to be like a cheap imitation of the brilliant Coneheads. Contrast the sharp, satirical portraits of various narcissistic characters in the Coneheads with Gallaxhar --reminiscent of the mustachioed villain of 19th century melodrama.

  Monsters vs Aliens has quite a bit of very neat animation along with a positive message of self-empowerment. But by the film's end, it becomes too much like the kind of films it seeks to satirize. Yes, another 'mother ship' blows up after being set on 'auto-destruct', thanks to the heroic efforts of a group of motley but lovable losers. 'Monsters' has its moments but it's not consistently funny enough to be ranked as one of the better comic animations.",1270166400,3,5387,4.946784922394679

Starting out, Susan was a blushing bride about to be married to her shallow weatherman boyfriend Derek, but a meteorite chrashes near her and dowses her with an outer space radiation called quantonium. She is then transformed into a white-haired giantess, and immeadiately accosted by the military, who apparently were expecting a giant to be there at the crashsite in the first place because they had large hypodermic needles to put her to sleep with. Susan wakes up in the secret government facility of Area 52 which houses other kinds of ""monsters"". The team consists of Bob the blob, the amphibious Missing Link, the insectoid mad scientist Dr. Cockroach, and the tremendous kaiju Insectosaurus. Things seem miserable for Susan(now called Ginormica), but the evil alien overlord Gallaxhar shows up in his starship and launches a giant robot loose on San Francisco. So the monsters are sent to stop the robot in exchange for their freedom. After an epic battle that wrecks the Golden Gate Bridge, they destroy the mecha, and Susan heads to her hometown along with her new monster buds to see her fiance. However, Derek breaks up with her, which makes Susan embrace her monsterhood. This would be nice, except that Gallaxhar kidnaps her to extract the quantonium from her to power his clone-making machine and invade Earth. Bob, Link, and Cockroach board the ship and find Susan who is now normal size after having the radiation sucked out of her. They manages to destroy the ship's computer, and Susan confronts Gallaxhar, which gets her cosmic mojo again, turning her back into a giant. They escape on Insectosaurus who is now a gargantuan butterfly. The monsters then agree to continue working with the military to defend Earth against other threats.

M.V.A. was a very enjoyable movie. The 3-D is applied wonderfully, unlike some other animated films. The story pays great attention to the Silver Age schlock creature features, both the stereotypical monster ones and flying saucer flicks. The casting was fine, although it was a little overboard with Stephen Colbert at the President, and they could've just had John DiMaggio doing the voice of Keifer Sutherland's character, General Monger. Like in most Dreamworks cartoons, there is alot of pop culture subreferences, although one of the genuinely good ones is the DDR session. There's already been an OVA prequal called BOB's Big Break, and a Halloween TV special, but knowing Dreamworks there's probably gonna be an actual movie sequal too.

3602503,4,B001GCUO7K,"When the government hides monsters in a bunker and the planet is suddenly under alien attack what should be done?  Why, have the monsters fight the aliens of course!  Such is the premise of this little movie.

Meet Susan who undergoes a drastic and alarming change on her wedding day - growing quite gigantic.  Suddenly (very suddenly) she's captured by the military and wakes up in a strange place.  It's the huge government bunker where all the monsters are kept.  This was a problem I had with the movie - this bunker is HUGE and filled with technological marvels but through the movie we only see 5 monsters - where are all the other monsters to justify such space and expense?  Granted they did have an invisible man at one point too and Insectosaurus is huge but still...

Some others are Dr. Cockroach (no further description needed), Link, or more formally Missing Link and Bob, a living food additive with no brain.  They are a pretty charming and funny bunch and the movie is full of funny little snips of dialog and scenes.  The President's attempts at communication with an alien probe alone had me cracking a big grin.  And when the alien(s) arrive we're also treated to lots of smooth action and cool looking technology as well.

The main narrative follows Susan (or Ginormica) and there are the expected lessons of accepting people for who they are not what they look like but also a lesson about standing on your own and up for yourself and your friends - all  good heart warm-y stuff.  What the movie lacks though is any real plot.

You see, the alien(s) just show up looking for quantonium a super powerful element.  A giant probe robot is dropped down and starts smashing stuff and the General just up and says the monsters should handle it.  They've been in captivity for years except Ginormica, who's new, so I'm not sure what made him think the monsters were the best candidates and I'm not sure why the monsters should help (other than the carrot of freedom) and why they aren't just a bit more miffed at being held prisoner for just being who and what they are.

As to the alien's motivations for wanting to take over the Earth and kill everyone - forget about it.  He just shows up.  The movie even makes fun of this by having the alien attempt to explain but us missing half the conversation.  I wasn't laughing.  He was a threat, even for Ginormica and her giant strength but this lack of understanding his motives was annoying.

The voice work was uniformly good from Reese Witherspoon to Seth Rogan and the action was action packed and the laughs were plentiful but if you're looking for a lot of substance then you may need to look elsewhere.

3602505,5,B001GCUO7K,"Dreamworks really outdid themselves as an animator company with Monsters vs. Aliens, even (dare I say) on par with Pixar films!

I love it when the writers who do science fiction play homage to old monster films of the Fifties (The Blob, Attack of the 50 Foot Woman, Mothra) and write a funny plot, a few insider jokes, and no sex or potty humor.  Can it be done?

Yes, successfully.  Susan is about to get married but somehow gets hit on the head with a meteor.  A meteor that holds powerful energy that an alien wants for himself.  She becomes 50 feet tall to learn what a jerk her groom is (a newscaster from Modesto, who is moving on to the big Fresno market).

Love the San Francisco-esque scenes, so realistic.  Our cockroach mad scientist (al'a The Fly) hooks up a streetcar (to the Castro) with four rockets -- Man, I've never seen MUNI move so fast! (Local humor, sorry).

Susan's fighting the aliens, the giant robot crushing the Golden Gate Bridge, her returning of self confidence and wanting to help her friends communicates so many positive messages to kids who watch this.

Bob is the best.  He is patterned after The Blob, can pop his eye in and out, absorbs food and falls in love with a dish of jello.

The DVD specials are interesting:  Two ""make-of"" regarding 3D filming technology (wish I saw this in a 3D theater now) and some ""deleted scenes"" most of which are storyboarded with voiceovers.  Dreamworks added the same thing to their other DVD on Madagascar, showing short songs of their earlier films.  I skipped this, as I can only ""move-it move-it"" so much.

As with other computer animated films, 'Monsters vs. Aliens' looks great in high definition. I had the opportunity to watch the DVD version and the difference in picture quality when compared to the BD is huge! Presented in its original aspect ratio and in 1080p, the movie is a visual feast. The color and detail in the sequences that take place in Gallaxhar's ship as well as the simplest scenes in which the monsters party by a swimming pool look clear and bright.

The story is quite original and the movie has its moments, while it is not at the level of say, a Pixar film, it entertains and my kid loved it. There are good jokes throughout the film as well as tributes to the old movies from which they based the characters on (also look for references for Sci-Fi and horror movies) The voice acting is also a great, Reese Witherspoon, Hugh Laurie , Seth Rogen, all of them do a great work, also it was fun to listen to Kiefer Sutherland as General W.R. Monger (it was hard not to think of Jack Bauer though) Stephen Colbert is without a doubt one of the funniest voices (and characters) in the movie as the president. Audio is presented in English 5.1 Dolby TrueHD and  also included are Spanish/French tracks in Dolby Digital 5.1

The movie definitely has enough material for a sequel, we have yet to see if this was a one movie project only (like the incredible&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bee-Movie-Blu-ray/dp/B0018QCXFK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bee Movie [Blu-ray</a>]) or a setup for a new franchise like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Madagascar-Blu-ray/dp/B001AII4TA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Madagascar [Blu-ray</a>] was.

A great addition to any family collection, especially if you have boys.  Yes, the usual gross humor.",1256688000,,276,4.787234042553192
3602657,4,B001GCUO7K,"In the realm of animation films, DreamWorks' track record for sure isn't quite as sublime as that of Pixar's (*cough*SINBAD: LEGEND OF THE SEVEN SEAS, *cough*BEE MOVIE, *coughhackcough*SHARK TALE). However, DreamWorks has trotted out its fair share of classics or near-classics. I really like MONSTERS VS. ALIENS, and if it weren't for the SHREK series, I might even put this up there as my favorite DreamWorks animated flick. I certainly think it's on par with KUNG FU PANDA, OVER THE HEDGE, FLUSHED AWAY, and ANTZ (But you ever get the sense that Pixar films just have more heart?).

In the much ignored Omega quadrant, in Sector 72-4, towards a planet locally known as Earth, the most potent element in the universe, the Quantonium, plummets. Quantonium is highly sought by the four-eyed space terror known as Galaxar, this element being crucial in some master scheme of his. Galaxar heads toward Earth, post-haste.

The film's concept is nifty and it also bridges two genres. What does the U.S. military do when the country falls under alien attack? It sics monsters at the problem. There's a top-secret military project which, for the past fifty years, had been capturing rampaging monsters and then holding them prisoners (and, after fifty years, the military has exactly... five monsters). The central character is Susan (sweetly voiced by Reese Witherspoon). Susan is a young woman in Modesto, California, and moments away from getting married. And then a meteorite slams into her and turns her into a 50-foot-tall giant. There goes the wedding. There goes the self-absorbed fiance. Here comes General W.R. Monger, head of that top-secret military project, grappling nets and sleep darts in his arsenal.

Who knows how long Susan would've languished in some maximum security holding facility? (Answer: the rest of her life.) But then the colossal retro-robot probe from outer space comes to Earth, and even our cool and brave President is rendered useless against it. To quote the Commander in Chief: ""Okay, uh, boys, set the terror level at Code Brown 'cause I need to change my pants."" As a desperate last gesture, the Earth monsters are released from captivity (including Susan, now codenamed Ginormica) and off they go into hapless action, and, oh heck, this is just a fun movie to watch.

It turns out that these scary monsters want what everyone else wants: to be accepted and to fit in. And this being DreamWorks Animation and a kid's flick, no way was a ""good guy"" beastie gonna pull a switcheroo and turn to the dark side. Even the most suspect creature, the super-genius labcoat-wearing cockroach, stays true to his friends. But, okay, there's a part of me that wouldn't have minded if there'd been more edginess to this movie. Plenty of big action sequences - including a fantastic encounter on the Golden Gate Bridge, in which the CG really pops - but the best moments come when the monsters are simply interacting with each other, and the inherent sweetness of these characters come out. That's when the movie shows its heart and when it's at its most appealing.

The voice casting is crazy stocked with big names. Reese Witherspoon is well cast; she makes Susan seem like your typical sweet-natured young woman living out her life but who then gets exposed to very odd goings-on. Will Arnett brings swagger to the Missing Link (who bears more than a passing resemblance to the Creature from the Black Lagoon), while Hugh Laurie's mellifluous voice makes it fun listening to the mad British scientist Dr. Cockroach, PhD. You've got Kiefer Sutherland (General Monger) and Paul Rudd (Susan's weatherman reporter), and the casting coup may well be Stephen Colbert playing the hip and happening U.S. President. But Seth Rogen easily takes the cake as the funniest monster in the bunch, as Benzoate Ostylezene Bicarbonate (or B.O.B.), that completely clueless but amiable gelatinous blob. Heck, Rene Zellweger even drops in for a cameo.

MONSTERS VS. ALIENS is just a straight up crowd pleaser. The animation is flawless, but you can almost shake that off, because any DreamWorks or Pixar product will be well-designed and very slick and will flaunt flawless animation. It's funny at a mile-a-minute clip (smile-a-minute?). Leonard Nimoy entrenches himself deeper into pop culture and, as a Spielberg fan, I appreciate the cute nod to CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND. Encroaching a bit into Studio Ghibli territory, the dialogue-bereft Insectosaurous - so huge it makes Ginormica seem like a normal-sized girl - looks like something that would emerge from Hayao Miyazaki's imagination. And with its high energy and frenetic pace, the kids' eyeballs will be glued fast to the screen. Speaking as a sometimes babysitter, this may be the best thing going on for this flick.",1256601600,,4789,5.040404040404041

3602659,2,B001GCUO7K,"Well, if you like to see things blow up and some likeable and very shallow characters spout gags that are sort of funny, this is the movie for you.  I really wanted to like it, but in the end it was just a lot of eye candy that was the intellectual equivalent of eating all the icing off a cake and finding there was no cake to begin with.

By the way, anyone notice that BOB and the alien probe robot are basically the same thing?  Same shape, eyeball, and all sorts of appendages that appear on demand.  One is goop and one is metal.

To be fair, there was some rather cool effects shots in this movie, and I'm sure that in some areas the creators pushed this 3D animation technology further than ever.  In fact, I enjoyed the ""making of"" type documentaries more than the movie.  Want to make animation like this?  Well, they reveal exactly what workstations and software they used, which is more than I can say for most of the ""making of"" documentaries that come with 3D animation movies.

The irony is that during the ""making of"" documentary someone brags that this movie took 40 million hours of render time, and the original Shrek took only five million, and then I thought to myself, ""Yeah, but the original Shrek is a classic, and this just ain't.""  I'll bet the original Toy Story took even less render time!  You see, there are movies that go for the heart, and there are movies that go for the eye.  Toy Story, Shrek, Up, and Kung Fu Panda are examples of the former, and this an example of the latter.",1256515200,7,1513,4.345195729537367

They each had a part to play in this movie, and had to utilize teamwork to be victorious.  At the end you were not left disappointed thinking that any of the characters needed more exposure, or disappointed thinking that any of their personalities fell flat.  This movie was jam packed with funny moments, down to the smallest detail.  If you are perceptive you will get the most out of this film.  There is so much material that you may not get it all the first time.  It is appropriate for children as well as adults, fun for the whole family.

I like the character designs, and the animation is really top notch for a Dreamworks film, however, the film has no more depth that a typical Saturday morning cartoon. Enjoyable to watch the first time, its certainly not a film I will watch again and again as it lacks the emotional depth from Dreamworks previous film Kung Fu Panda, which I felt was an excellent film and very obviously Dreamworks best.

3602663,2,B001GCUO7K,"Dreamworks animation has an interesting track record on thier CGI movies, in the sense that they get about half of them right.  Let's review:

- Antz (bad)
- Shrek (good)
- Shrek 2 (good)
- Shark Tale (awful)
- Madagascar (bad)
- Over the Hedge (Fantastic!)
- Flushed Away (good)
- Shrek the Third (bad)
- Bee Movie (bad)
- Kung Fu Panda (absolutely brilliant)
- Madagascar 2 (bad)

I find it interesting that they can make films that are so good and others that are so far on the other end of the spectrum.

At any rate, this brings us to Monsters Vs. Aliens.  Since the Dreamworks films are mostly a gamble, I wasn't sure what to expect when going into the theater.  Unfortuantely, they seem to have churned out another thoughtless, meaningless pile of throwaway film.

The characters were completely undeveloped.  However, it doesn't really matter since they were so bland by design that digging a little deeper into who they were would give us very little.  The only character that resonates at all was the bohemoth protagonist, who does give us a little bit of relief from the void of personality in the movie.

The plot is largely forgettable, and makes little sense as it progresses.  Humor can make up for a complete lack of quality screenwriting, but M. vs. A. fails on that front as well.  A few good lines pop up here and there, but nothing that brought more than a chuckle to anyone in my family.

Watch ""The Iron Giant"" instead.  That's the best animated film about a giant main character that I know of.  Perhaps the ONLY other one....but brilliant nonetheless.",1256256000,7,1575,4.615107913669065
3602664,4,B001GCUO7K,"A narcissistic, callous, egomaniacal alien versus a gigantic babe ... hmmm ...

There's something here for everyone. One character gives a nod to Al Gore (""That would be a very convenient truth ...""), but anyone with a sense of humor will immediately see that there is more than a passing resemblance between Obama and the tentacled alien baddy who wants to remake earth in his own image. The resulting Obama vs. Palin dust-up is entertainment for all. Not quite 4 stars, but 3.5 would be more like it.

Update: as expected, this movie has sparked intense (but healthy) debate in the Democrat blogosphere. Namely, which character is Joe Biden? It seems to me, however, that the filmmakers did not intend the answer to be vague. Hint: which character would be most likely to invite a person in a wheelchair to stand up? But this raises other questions as well. For example, if you ask yourself ""which character thinks his parents met in Selma four years after he was born,"" then the waters are muddied considerably. However, I think the physical resemblance decidedly tilts Obama to Galaxar rather than our blue blob friend. Not to mention his now-famous comment that perhaps his white grandma didn't deserve a heart transplant but rather a pain pill. This seems to line up with Galaxar's character more.

Who says libs don't have a sense of humor? Not to mention being able to laugh at themselves.",1255996800,,1397,4.8125

3602699,5,B001GCUO7K,"Dreamworks is having a very hard time trying to keep up the genuine perfection of PIXAR. Since these guys probably believe they never will surpass them the next best thing is to just make fun of them and everything else. So because of that mentality we get the latest DreamWorks film Monsters VS. Aliens.

MvA is the story of a young woman named Susan ready to take the next step in her life and marry the man of her dreams. Suddenly she is exposed to a meteor and starts to become a `big' problem. Now she is government property, has made a bunch of interesting new friends and is now part of a team that has been assembled to take down threats that the average man may not be able to handle. Her first mission, stop an alien invasion! Not too bad for the next step in Susan's life.

Monsters VS Aliens is a laugh out loud comedy that really appeals to a very diverse audience. There are numerous references to Sci-Fi pop culture and of course the Monsters in the movie pay tribute to all the classic B horror films of the 1950 until today. Some of those examples include, `The Creature of the Black Lagoon', `The Blob' and The `Attack of the 50 Foot Woman'. The cast is fantastic and of course we all knew that Seth Rogan would steal the show as he always does.  Some of the other cast members include Reese Witherspoon, Hugh Laurie and believe it or not a whole new side of Keifer Sutherland. What I loved about this movie was the fact that Stephen Colbert played the president and probably delivered the best line in the whole movie. I applaud `Monsters VS Aliens' for its original tribute to the Sci-Fi parody and it is definitely one of the few DreamWorks films that is very much worth the money. Since `Shrek' there really hasn't been a truly great DreamWorks animation film. (This is not including anything made by the Aardmen Studios). I have to say I am very excited for future DreamWorks parody projects. The two known ones on the horizon are `How To Train Your Dragon' which is a take on fantasy stories and `Oobermind' which is a take on Superheroes and comic books.

The movie was good. It teaches the value of friendship and staying loyal to your positive beliefs. There are some truly funny moments and best of all, the movie was pretty short. So for me, 3 stars...my kids on the other hand...5 stars. I'm writing the review, so: 3 stars. :-D",1254787200,,1631,4.466442953020135

3602703,4,B001GCUO7K,"We got this on Blu Ray and it looks amazing.  The animation was just flat out great and in the HD format the characters and environments just come to life.  Especially a screen in San Fransisco has a tremendous amount of detail.

The story and characters are all very well written, extremely well animated, and the actors did a great job of bringing their voices to life.  There was a lot of good clean humor with an easy to follow plot.  I especially liked our heroine giant as she did a wonderful job with a well written character.  I like how this character grows over the course of the movie and does not fit any female stereotypes or played as a ditz but is instead a strong and courageous woman.  We need more characters like that.

The extra movie for BOB's birthday was great.  It was really funny and gave a little more back story on the main characters.  It was also in 3D was was fun.

The only downside is the film lacked 3D for the main film even though it had it in the theatres and comes with glasses for BOBs birthday film... but no 3D option for the main movie.  We are not really big into 3D or anything but it would be nice to at least have the option since that is how they made the movie.  Coraline offered both versions for example.

Overall we love the film and it just looks so crisp and clear on blu ray.  I would have given it 5 stars had the movie come in 3D.  I am sure over the years we will watch this one a bunch with the kids.",1254787200,,1458,4.117021276595745

The only real dissapointment with this blu-ray is they did not put the 3d version of the film as well as the 2d.

3602737,4,B001GCUO7K,"From the creators of ""Shrek"" and ""Kung Fu Panda"", Academy award winner Reese Witherspoon leads a ragtag team of unlikely heroes in the animated blockbuster ""Monsters vs. Aliens"". When the strange energy of a meteorite causes her to mysteriously grow to a towering 49-feet-11-inches, Susan Murphy (Witherspoon) is taken by the military to a top secret compound where the government has kept the existence of monsters hidden from the public for decades. Susan, dubbed Ginormica, and her new monstrous friends are called into action to save the world from the evil alien leader Gallaxhar (Rainn Wilson). Though certainly not the best animated movie of the year, ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is a very enjoyable parody of classic Sci-fi movies of the 1950s. The animated movie offers some amusing characters and loads of action and humor. The storyline is pretty straightforward but the computer animation is very impressive. The all-star voice cast also includes Hugh Laurie, Will Arnett, Seth Rogen, Paul Rudd, Stephen Colbert and Kiefer Sutherland.

""Monsters vs. Aliens"" makes its way onto Blu-Ray with a top-notch presentation and a great set of extras. The animated movie is presented in 2.35:1 widescreen format. Like many animated movies in high definition, ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" looks fantastic. The HD transfer would have been perfect if it wasn't for the lack of a 3-D option. Its 5.1 Dolby TrueHD sound is also excellent. Special features include several behind-the-scenes featurettes (Modern Monster Movie Making & The Tech of Monsters vs. Aliens), an audio commentary track with the filmmakers, the enjoyable 13-minute ""B.O.B.'s Big Break"" 3-D animated short, three deleted scenes, paddle ball 3-D game, three sing-along segments with the film's characters, and sneak peaks of other DreamWorks animated films.

I'm very disappointed with the main story line but I did like the alternate story line of B.O.B.'s big break.
That will be something that I can show my kids.  I think that this was a setup for a Saturday morning cartoon lineup.  Just like the penguins did.
I don't fault Dreamworks one bit about wanting to make a buck, but this was really a straight to DVD sort of production.
It seemed very edited and cut-up with a loss of continuity of both character and the story line.

But what doesn't kill you makes you stronger.  And taller.  As Susan grows to the size of a giantess, the government shows up and takes her away to a secret facility.

It is there that she finds out she isn't the only monster rounded up over the years.  There's B.O.B, a giant blob of goo (Seth Rogen), Dr. Cockroach, Ph. D., a mad scientist who turned himself into a human cockroach (Hugh Laurie), The Missing Link, a fish monster (Will Arnett), and Insectasaurus, a giant caterpillar.

The five monsters might have stayed locked up forever if it weren't for the alien invasion.  The governments, lead by President Hathaway (Stephen Colbert), makes the monsters a deal.  If they will defeat the alien, they will be released from prison.  Can they save San Francisco from the menace?

Where do I even begin with this film?

Let's start with the negative aspect, the story is predictable.  I had all the major plot points figured out by the half way point.  So if you watch this movie looking for originality, you will be disappointed.

However, I can't fault the producers for dragging things out.  The story moved very quickly from one plot point to the next.  Not that this weakened the characters.  Susan is really our main character, but everyone gets some time to develop.  I grew to love all five of our main monsters and was rooting for them to come out on top.

And the movie is hilarious.  I am not too familiar with the 50's monster and alien movies, but it was still clear to me that's what was being spoofed.  Plus the one liners were enough to keep me and my friends laughing the entire time.

The voice talent did a great job, and the animation was as realistic as it could be considering all the fantasy elements involved.

Being Dreamworks, there were a couple of slightly off color jokes that I didn't fully appreciate.  But most of the movie was acceptable for kids of all ages.  And the movie is so funny I seriously doubt it would scare any but the youngest of children.

I have written off Dreamworks animation in years past because it didn't look too good.  While this movie wasn't enough to make me into a die hard fan of their work, it was enough for me to take look at their future movies at lot more seriously.  This one is well worth seeing.",1254182400,3,2436,4.522935779816514
3602741,3,B001GCUO7K,"Monsters VS Aliens is pretty much what I expected. An expensive, explosion filled animated movie. As with all American mage animated films, there are the obligatory inside jokes for adults and a moral about ""following your heart"" and female empowerment (that's been a compulsory theme ever since ""The Little Mermaid"" was in theatres). Things do blow up real good, and kids will appreciate all the colors and moving stuff but the movie has no real heart. Nothing in this film really engaged me.

Then there are these other subtle themes that you can derive from this film. Its interesting that people will accept a cockroach scientist, a 60 foot tall woman and aliens in a movie, but a non-secretive, competent, effective government is way too fantastic. Another trend in films like this, all the men in the movie are crazy, weak, cowardly or selfish - great role models for boys.

In general, Monsters Vs Aliens is a so-so movie, not very memorable. If you want to see an animated film this year with more heart and brains, then go rent/buy Coraline instead.",1254096000,2,1058,4.8076923076923075

My entire family - husband, 12 year old daughter, 4 year old daughter, and me - all found something to enjoy in this film.  And I started laughing out loud when the 4 year old started explaining the movie to me as we watched.  What a hoot!

The plot of MONSTERS VS. ALIENS is pretty basic:  America has been capturing and holding monsters in an ultra super secret government facility for decades.  Aliens land with intent to destroy the Earth.  The military sets loose the monsters, who are all pretty genial folks, to attack the aliens and defend the Earth.  Along the way, lessons are learned about overcoming obstacles and being happy with who you are.

MONSTERS VS.

3602789,4,B001GCUO7K,"I hate to say this, but let's face it. Unlike the company's ""Shrek,"" DreamWorks's latest animation ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is not likely to win the next year's Oscar. Though the animation is technically marvelous, and the film is fun to be sure, funny with many jokes, ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" doesn't have one thing every great animation film has - that is, a good script, or a story that really grabs your heart.

This is not to say the film is a failure. Actually, ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is quite entertaining. The story is about Susan Murphy (voice by Reese Witherspoon), a bride hit by a meteorite on her wedding day. Her body starts to glow, and then grow, and she becomes a giant woman. Taken to the government's secret facilities, she has to live there totally isolated from the world until an evil alien sends a huge robot to the Earth.

So who is going to fight? Of course, it's the team of ""monsters"" including Susan or ""Ginormica,"" ""B.O.B"" (voice by Seth Rogen), Dr. Cockroach (Hugh Laurie), The Missing Link (Will Arnett) and a giant bug ""Insectosaurus,"" led by General W.R. Monger (Kiefer Sutherland).

As its tongue-in-cheek title suggest, ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is partly homage to old-fashioned B-movies made in the 1950-60s. You cannot watch Susan's giant woman character roaming in the street without remembering the campy classic ""Attack of the 50 Foot Woman."" As if to make up for the weak storyline, ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" has a lot of gags and references to pop culture, and Stephen Colbert gives the most hilarious turn as ""The President."" The film also has a unique soundtrack, unlikely combination of B-52, the theme from Beverly Hills Cop, and oldies like The Exciters' ""Tell Him.""

I didn't see the film in 3-D, but the visuals are still wonderful, especially the scenes in and around the city of San Francisco. Interestingly they decided to ""shoot"" the film as if it is a live-action film, and it works, at least in the 2-D format.

The storyline is uneven at best and those lovable characters (you just can't hate even this silly ""villain"") deserve a better script. ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is a delightful 94 minute ride of roller coaster, but don't expect something deep and emotional like ""Monsters Inc.""",1247270400,,2226,4.832020997375328
3602790,1,B001GCUO7K,"Monsters vs Aliens is the exact opposite of Kung Fu Panda. It has no vision, it has no interesting characters, it doesn't look good, and the heroine is quite irritating. It's the kind of movie I wonder how it even got past the script stage. It all feels a bit... random, and not fleshed out at all.

Susan (voiced by Reese Witherspoon) is struck by a meteor on her wedding day to a cocky anchorman. Transformed into Ginormica, she is sealed off in Area 51 by the government, alongside four 'monsters' - a mad scientist turned cockroach, the missing link, a weird gigantic larva, not to mention the ""Blob"" himself - only his name is Bob. Their help is needed, however, when an alien emperor plans to invade earth.

The premise sounds promising but the execution is all off. Of all the 'monsters' they could think of, they go for those four? They have none of the depth or visual appeal of the characters in Kung Fu Panda. None of the characters appear to have gone through a character design stage at all; they all look quite crude and unimaginative. If this movie had a vision, I'm not seeing it. The plot is very thin and is almost solely held together by gags - which are admittedly quite hysterical at times. But jokes alone don't make a movie.

While I enjoyed the movie a bit more than I thought I would (or should have), it left zero with me. As I watched this movie unfold in the cinema, I only found the 3D glasses I was wearing to be worth the ticket. It seems Dreamworks learned nothing from their previous film, Kung Fu Panda. What I love about that film is that it's deep and full of substance, and just plain beautiful. I just don't understand how Dreamworks could throw all that out the window. But even the dumbest script in the world can sometimes be saved by just being 'cool' - and this movie doesn't even have enough substance for that. Nothing about this movie attracts me to it. Dreamworks have completely degraded their standard with Monsters vs Aliens, and I hope it's only a temporary setback.

3602791,4,B001GCUO7K,"I took my son today to see Monsters versus Aliens in Real 3D. Having grown up in the 3D revival era (remember Friday the 13th Part 3 in 3-D or Jaws 3D?), I had my doubts about how good this 3D could actually be. Reminiscences of the paper glasses with one blue and one red lens made me wary of what this movie might offer.

Our first exposure to this new ""Real-D 3D"" was a preview for the movie Battle for Terra. I was immediately sold on this incredible new 3D technology! Wearing clear-lensed 3D glasses made large enough to fit comfortably over prescription glasses, this new technology involves none of the color distortion of the early 3D movies while providing an exceedingly realistic three dimensional experience.

For a movie that reportedly used the 3D process as an enhancement to the story and not a gimmicky addition, Monsters versus Aliens starts with an early scene of a man playing paddle ball while waiting for some form of extra-terrestrial activity to pop up on a computer monitor. I literally flinched when the paddle ball popped out of the screen, nearly hitting me in the nose.

Other realistic three dimensional effects included snow blowing around in a scene that made me feel as if I was actually in the snow storm, soaring through the rings around Saturn, and a meteor crashing to the earth, just to name a few.

The story line of the movie was pleasing, as well, with a governmental facility where monsters are kept being forced to release the monsters to fight off an invading alien force that the American military is ineffective against (must be the post-Obama military era). There are only two brief scenes in the movie that even the most guarded of viewers should be okay with. When the President of the United States (played by Stephen Colbert) receives a warning from Galaxhar, the ruler of the invading alien armada, that everyone will die within 24 hours, he says, ""Raise the alert level to brown, because I need to change my pants."" In another scene, when bride turned monster Ginormica is approached by the other monsters who are trying to figure out what the giant monster woman is, B.O.B., an indestructible gelatinous mass, says, ""He's a boy. Look at his boobies.""

My son and I both immensely enjoyed Monsters versus Aliens, both for it's humorous story line and it's incredible 3D effects. Happily, there will be more where that came from as at least eight other films are slated for release this year in this incredible 3D format. This movie is a must-see for all!

Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):

1. Star studded cast lights up the screen (or at least their voices do) in a funny and action-packed computer-animated film from Dreamworks.
2. Reese Witherspoon is Susan Murphy, a sweet home Modesto girl who doesn't realize her true worth until she gets hit by a meteor. . .
3. . . . on her wedding day
4. The casting people outdo themselves with Seth Rogen as a brainless blob, Hugh Laurie as a mad doctor with the ethics of a cockroach, Rainn Wilson as an evil alien and Stephen Colbert as the President of the United States.
5. Think of a bigger, better Mars Attacks! and Spaceballs.

When an evil alien targets Earth as a source of ""quantonium"", the Government has only one option, and that is to call out the monsters under the command and supervision of General W. R. Monger (Keifer Sutherland).

General W.R. Monger: ""This place is an X-file wrapped in a cover-up and deep-fried in a government conspiracy.""

Other star vocal talent includes Will Arnett, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd, Jeffrey Tambor, Renee Zellweger and John Krasinski, among others.

The plot itself may not be a classic, but the animation and casting make it a movie you'll want to have in your collection.

Recommended, naturally, for fans of superior computer animation, monsters and aliens.

The President of the United States: ""Boys, set the terror level at code brown, 'cause I need to change my pants.""

3602793,4,B001GCUO7K,"""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is just plain fun, a film, I suspect, adults will enjoy more than children. Yes, it does have plenty for children to enjoy, not the least of which are the impressive animation effects and the fact that it's presented in 3-D. But consider the fact that numerous satirical references are made to global warming and the American government, and one character is given one or two hilarious lines regarding her thumbs and how one is smaller than the other: Will kids really understand or even notice these touches? I tend to doubt it. Regardless, I think everyone will enjoy this film. If you're one of those people who think 3-D effects are distracting, don't worry--not all theaters playing ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" are equipped to show it in 3-D. You therefore have the option of experiencing it without being subjected to objects flying off the screen.

The story begins on the day Modesto native Susan Murphy (voiced by Reese Witherspoon) is to be married to local TV weatherman Derek Dietl (voiced by Paul Rudd). As she stands outside the church, waiting for the ceremony to begin, a meteorite suddenly falls from the sky and lands directly on top of her. She isn't killed, but the strange radiation from the meteorite transforms her into a giant; it isn't long before she's tranquilized by government agents and taken away.

When she awakens, she learns that she's being held in a secret high tech facility designed to keep monsters out of the public eye. She then meets four of the residents. The first, nicknamed B.O.B. (voiced by Seth Rogen), is a viscous blue blob with one eye and no brain, the result of a genetic accident involving a tomato and a packet of ranch dressing. The second, Dr. Cockroach Ph. D. (voiced by Hugh Laurie) was once a man until a machine fused his DNA with that of an insect; now he's a child-sized bug who likes to laugh like an evil scientist. The third, The Missing Link (voiced by Will Arnett), is a fish-human hybrid who isn't the most physically able but likes to pretend that he is. The fourth is Insectosaurus, a monstrous caterpillar that once attacked Tokyo. The facility they're in is run by the aptly named W.R. Monger (voiced by Kiefer Sutherland), a tough-talking general whose Southern accent is second only to his loud voice. Because of her enormous size, he gives Susan the nickname Ginormica.

(If I may digress for a moment: If you take another look at the way I described the monsters, you might notice that they were inspired by five famous monster movies--""Attack of the 50 Ft. Woman,"" ""The Blob,"" ""The Fly,"" ""Creature from the Black Lagoon,"" and ""Mothra."")

When a tentacled alien creature named Gallaxhar (voiced by Rainn Wilson) sends a giant robot probe to Earth on a mission of destruction, Monger convinces the President (voiced by Stephen Colbert) to let the monsters take care of the problem. At this point, it becomes a journey of self-discovery for Susan--she essentially begins realizing that she's actually achieved something by being transformed into a monster, and because of that, she starts to rethink her relationship with Derek. It's not as if he was all that nice a guy to begin with.

But what am I talking about? Not too many people will see ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" looking for a commentary on self-esteem. Above all else, it's a light-hearted animated comedy built around inside jokes, witty dialogue, and sight gags. A good example of the last is the scene in which Susan finds herself fighting against Gallaxher's robot; before trying to save innocent people driving on the Golden Gate Bridge, she puts both her feet into cars and uses them to roller skate down the hilly streets of San Francisco. And then there's the recurring gag of two identical, gigantic red buttons in the middle of a secret military compound. One of them releases nuclear weapons while the other dispenses lattes. Naturally, the President is often confused about which one is which.

I have no doubt that the one character audiences will love the most is B.O.B. He seems so delightfully brainless, and you know this is true when he thinks that Susan is a boy because only boys have breasts. There's also his brief romantic triste with a plateful of green Jell-O, who he thinks gave him a fake phone number. You just can't help but laugh every time he appears on screen.

The long and short of it is that ""Monsters vs. Aliens"" is a thoroughly enjoyable animated film, and while the 3-D process is at times a little too intrusive (as in the beginning, when a man sits at a desk, playing with a paddleball), it ultimately serves the story very well. It certainly holds up better than many recent films presented in 3-D, including the delightful ""Coraline."" I suspect the satirical sense of humor will be lost on kids, but the physical gags certainly won't. So it seems we have one of those rare cases when a cartoon was made with all audiences in mind. I had a lot of fun watching this movie, and if you're in need of lighthearted comedy with great visual effects, I'm sure you will feel the same way.",1239926400,,5067,4.731596828992073
3602794,4,B001GCUO7K,"I am a huge fan of animated films. And since Pixar can't produce every animated film, I also go to Disney films. And since those two studios release only a few films every year, I also go to see DreamWorks animation. DreamWorks animated efforts are getting better, but they still lack the magic Pixar is able to create and the beauty Disney is capable of.

In their newest release, ""Monsters Vs. Aliens"", the filmmakers blend a series of references to classic sci fi and monster films of the 50s, with the pop culture references that are de rigueur for any animated film today. The result is an enjoyable effort, enhanced by the 3D process it was created for. The key difference between this film and say ""Coraline"" or ""Bolt"" is that while the 3D enhances these far better films, it wasn't necessary to enjoy either. In ""Monsters Vs. Aliens"", the film  would seem a little lackluster without the 3D glasses. propped on your nose, making everything seem a little more lifelike.

The story opens at a monitoring station in Antarctica. The bored technicians are hitting a ping-pong ball lazily in the air and at us. Woo. Watch out it might just hit you. This is an amusing signal to us that this film is going to make a lot of references to 3D films from the 50s, when the technology was first introduced to battle the threat of television. There is a similar scene in Vincent Price's ""House of Wax"" when a barker uses the same technique to get the attention of passerby, hitting the ball directly at us. The key difference between the two films is that the 3D process is so much more convincing now.

Susan Murphy (voiced by Reese Witherspoon) is preparing to marry her fiance Derek Dietl (Paul Rudd) in their hometown of Modesto when Derek springs the news on Susan that they won't be going to Paris for their honeymoon, Derek needs to go to Fresno for an interview to become the anchor of their nightly news. He is on his way up and she tries to match his enthusiasm. Susan is upset, but she acquiesces and walks out to a gazebo, to think about the wedding, Derek, her life. Unfortunately, this is also the time and place a meteor strikes next to the gazebo. And Susan walks away, glowing. During the ceremony, she grows 50 feet and the Army quickly appears to try to control her. Later, she wakes up in a large containment facility run by General W. R. Monger (Kiefer Sutherland) and she meets the other inhabitants of the program; insectasourus, a large centipede, B.O.B. (Seth Rogen, ""Knocked Up"", ""Pineapple Express""), a big blue blob who seems to like everyone and doesn't seem to care that he has no brains, Dr. Cockroach (Hugh Laurie, TV's ""House""), a mad scientist who ran afoul of one of his own experiments and The Missing Link (Will Arnett, ""Blades of Glory"", TV's ""Arrested Development""), a man-sized fish like creature. They quickly come together to fight an Alien invasion led by Galaxhar (Rainn Wilson, TV's ""The Office""), who wants to take over the Earth because his planet was just destroyed. The President (Stephen Colbert, TV's ""The Colbert Report"") tries to talk to Galaxhar's robot emissary, but soon runs in retreat. But General Monger is confident his monsters can fight the aliens, so they head off to battle Galaxhar in the Bay Area.

Directed by Rob Letterman and Conrad Vernon (who worked on ""Shark Tales"" and the ""Shrek"" films in various capacities) and co-written by Wallace Wolodarsky (one of the early, original writers on ""The Simpsons""), ""Monsters Vs. Aliens"" packs a lot of references to iconic sci fi films of the 50s and some real humor into the neat little story. The animation is also more stylized than we are used to, moving away from the hyper-realized visions filmmakers have been trying to achieve with some recent examples of animation. All of this helps give the film a sweet, good natured background, a slightly nostalgic appeal to match the small town Susan is from.

Reese Witherspoon is good, but she isn't memorable enough or different enough to make the character stand out. When she becomes a fifty foot tall woman, she is christened Ginormica. But this is about the extent of her character becoming a monster or a super hero. Most of the time, we watch as Susan deals with her fiance Dirk, her mom and dad and her hometown. If this were a drama, bravo. But as it is an animated film, it doesn't feel like her character is taken far enough.

Seth Rogen plays B.O.B., a blue mass of goo who seems to have no brains and just wants to be friends with people. But he also seems to be a little awkward around others; instead of hugging them, he swallows them and has to regurgitate them covered in blue goo.

B.O.B. is extremely funny and so good-natured you almost want to reach up to the screen, grab him in your arms and give him a bear hug. Rogen infects him with his laid back personality and B.O.B. is quick to laugh, and smile. B.O.B. is also an example of an animated character given life by both the animators and the actor providing his voice. Generally, the animators try to match the character to the actor, working hard to ensure the character matches what the actor is doing. Robin Williams still remains the most memorable modern animated character as the Genie in Disney's ""Aladdin"", Tom Hanks and Tim Allen did great work in both ""Toy Story"" films, Jeremy Irons was great as Scar in ""The Lion King"". These are a few examples of the perfect combination of actor to character and material, all of which intersect allowing the actor to create a memorable character, someone who will live on in our minds and subconscious. I don't know if Rogen exactly achieves that with B.O.B., but he comes close. Darn close. Closer than most of the other actors in the cast.

When Bob meets people, he wants to hug them, but he can't and he ends up swallowing them, only to immediately spit them out. Always laughing and smiling, B.O.B. likes to do tricks with his one eye and seems pretty oblivious. When he is scolded by someone, he frowns, but then quickly smiles and starts laughing, much like a child who doesn't completely understand what they have done. Its just fun to watch this character and he makes you laugh.

He also hits on a molded Jello salad at one point, providing a big laugh later.

Hugh Laurie (TV's ""House"") provides the voice for Dr. Cockroach. He's good, and it's funny to see the mad scientist role played to a certain limit, but this is another example of the character not going far enough. Will Arnett plays The Missing Link, who seems to be the giant Caterpillar's guardian and watchdog. Stephen Colbert has a few funny moments as the President.

But the other stand out in the cast is, surprisingly, Kiefer Sutherland. Sutherland provides the voice for General W. R. Monger, the leader of the Monsters. It's a nice turn, clearly patterned after Slim Picken's performance in ""Dr. Strangelove"". His voice has that slight Southern twang and is full of bluster and bravado. Flying around in a jet pack, he seems to compensate for his short stature in other ways.

Perhaps the highlight of the film is how many references to classic sci-fi and horror films from the 50s the filmmakers have packed in. For me, the most memorable was the ping pong paddle I mentioned before, but they manage to work in references to or gags about so many films it is a virtual treasure trove for people who loves films from this era. Some films provide a lot of visual jokes and puns (""Dr. Strangelove"", "":The Day The Earth Stood Still"", ""The Blob""), others provide more fleeting moments (""Mothra"", ""The Fly""). The filmmakers clearly love these films, providing a Valentine to the movies they grew up with.

""Monsters Vs. Aliens"" is a very admiral effort and it is worth a look. While it can't reach the heights of a Pixar or Disney films, DreamWorks has their first solid, non ""Shrek"" hit on their hands.",1239753600,,7859,4.644604316546762
3602795,3,B001GCUO7K,"Having run-of-the-mill expectations for this movie, I wasn't really disappointed.  We went to the 3-D version with the hope of getting more bang for the buck.  3-D effects were lost on me for much of the film because I simply 'got used' to it.

The storyline and characters, however, were cute and entertaining.  I can't complain when the 'moral' of the story is overcoming obstacles/handicaps and learning to love oneself.

Oh, and crushing the threat of Alien domination.

Overall, I thought the movie was likely a good deal more enjoyed by the children in the theater than the adults, which isn't bad.  It wasn't knock your socks off, but if you're looking for a fun, light movie to watch with your kids, then Monsters vs. Aliens may be right up your alley.",1239235200,,760,4.712121212121212
3602836,4,B001GCUO7K,"I grew up watching old monster and sci-fi films, so I couldn't wait to see this new animated tale that pays homage to so many of my favorite Saturday afternoon sci-fi films.

While the 3-D effects and animation are fantastic, I found the story to be lacking just a tad. I guess after Pixar's masterpiece Wall E, the bar has been set rather high. Regardless, it's a fun film and a special treat for those of us who grew up watching giant monster movies on the weekend.

I suggest seeing this at the IMAX in 3-D as it is really spectacular, with great voice work done by Reese Witherspoon, Hugh Laurie, Will Arnett
and the hysterical Seth Rogen. It's a very good film, but I wish the story was fleshed out better, the material certainly deserves it.

Igor was another film that paid homage to Saturday afternoon fright fare, but that one dealt with gothic horror. Both films are worth seeing, but if they had been treated with the same care as Wall E, we would have two extraordinary films instead of two films that just kind of missed the mark!

Some decent action scences, but nothing edge-of-your-seat.
There's a lame, tired old ""men are jerks - female empowerment"" subplot that detracts from the movie. Too bad, would have been a better movie without it.
For a while now, there's been a trend in live-action scifi and action movies to try to make up for a lack of a good writing/acting with flashy CG special effects.

I'd sit there almost begging for more things to pop out of the screen, but rarely anything would happen.  At the very least, adults will enjoy the pop culture references that almost every single child would not understand...I mean, how else would they keep the adults in the theater?

She's just about to say her vows when she starts growing.  Susan just barely outgrows the church when she's snatched by General W. R. Monger (v. by Kiefer Sutherland) and taken to a top secret government facility along with a group of other monsters.

Susan and Crew must work to save the Earth from Gallaxhar and his mad army of eight legged clones.  In the process, she learns a lot about herself and what her life would really be like wed to Derek.

""Monsters v. Aliens"" is not just a kid's film.  We've got references to every bad sci fi flick from ""Space Balls"" to ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" floating around.  The story's well done and worth watching for children of all ages.

3602841,4,B001GCUO7K,"Monsters vs. Aliens is an entertaining wrestling match for young children, an ironic take on society for older adults, and a delicious homage to 1950s science fiction movies for geeky parents.

Monsters vs. Aliens is one of those movies that's pretty explicit about what you get: a fight involving two critters that sometimes blur together.  The thing is, while an alien could be classified as a monster, a monster can't always be classified as an alien.  Although these monsters are, well, monsters, they're OUR MONSTERS, good old American-bred monstrosities created from science and evolution gone awry: Insectosaurus (Mothra), Dr. Cockroach (a riff on The Fly voiced by Hugh Laurie), BOB (Attack of the Killer Tomatoes + The Blob voiced by Seth Rogen), The Missing Link (The Creature from the Black Lagoon voiced by Will Arnett), and of course Ginormica (Attack of the 50-foot Woman voiced by Reese Witherspoon). The origins of these science fiction creations were completely lost on the audience in the theater I went to.

The story revolves around Susan Murphy's transformation into Ginormica on her wedding day.  It's a thrilling tale of female empowerment - literally, as Susan transforms into an enormously powerful giantess - that seems more appropriate to a 1950s setting. After her transformation Ginormica becomes a pawn of the government, working for a secret agency dedicated to defeating supernatural threats.  In other words: Hellboy and the BPRD. When a giant robot (sent by aliens, natch) shows up to destroy the Earth, it's up to this completely untrained and clueless team of monsters to save the world.

The movie is rife with in-jokes about classic science fiction movies, the current state of the U.S. government, and the complexities of global conquest that movies tend to gloss over (how does an alien overlord tell his clones apart?). The action comes fast and furious and in three-dimensions, the violence is definitely not for kids, and at various points things blow up. Although this is something of an action comedy, Monsters vs. Aliens plays for keeps.

The characters' lip-synching seemed off, but that might have been the theater I was in.  Some of the characters were underdeveloped: BOB is a laugh-machine, but Link and Cockroach have little to do, especially in light of Ginormica's powers.  And everyone conveniently ignores the fact that there's a bigger-than-even-Ginormica Insectosaurus wandering the countryside...but to go down that path is to question the basic premise of the movie.

Monsters vs. Aliens is a real treat for monster movie fans.  For everyone else, it's a serviceable 3-D roller coaster ride.  The kids in the audience (and it was almost all kids and parents) weren't bored, but they weren't laughing as much as my wife and I.",1238976000,,2785,5.134955752212389
3602842,3,B001GCUO7K,"Filled with hommage and fluff, Dreamworks' ""Monsters Vs Aliens"" is lightweight kiddie fun but runs thin on substance. This is basically an extended Saturday Morning Comic stretched to 90 minutes. What is now standard for this kind of fare, pop culture jokes are jammed in to keep the parents (or in my case, Uncle) chuckling at the cleverness while funny voices, kinetic action and butt jokes amuse the tykes. In fact, the pop cultured among us will spot ""Close Encounters,"" Independence Day,"" ""Mothra"" and ""Bevererly Hills Cop"" cobbled into bits throughout ""Monsters Vs Aliens.""

Cleverness does not a movie make, and while my five year old charge was laughing and clapping, I was losing interest by the time Gallaxhar (Rainn Wilson, in an unecessary bit of stunt casting) started forming his clone army. I appreciate that Susan/Ginormica was a powerful female who took no crap from her self-absorbed boyfriend and Keifer Sutherland (as General W.R.Monger) took the vinegar out of his Jack Bauer roles, but ""Monsters Vs Aliens"" is an unimaginative film fobbed of as Family Entertainment. You can definetly wait for this on DVD.",1238803200,2,1128,5.097297297297297
3602843,2,B001GCUO7K,"There's a fine line between clever and stupid...and Monsters vs. Aliens spends too much on the wrong side of this line.  The movie pokes fun at monster movie traditions, but cheeky insider jokes are just not enough to sustain an hour and a half plot.

I enjoyed some of the characters, especially Susan, who is struck by a meterorite on her wedding day and is transformed into the 50-foot tall ""Ginormica.""  But the story of the alien invasion was blah, even with Rainn Wilson voicing the evil overlord Gallaxhar.  Armies of cloned CGI characters just don't have much at stake.  It's the kind of movie where I could actually fall asleep in the middle of an extended, mayhem-filled action sequence (reminds me of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bolt/dp/B001OMU6UM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bolt</a>&nbsp;in that way).

If you do see this movie, definitely see it in 3-D.  We saw the flat version, and I have a feeling that half the fun would have been seeing exploding debris coming out of the screen!

The action was a little scary for younger kids (5 and under--there were some sitting next to us who left after 20 minutes). For older kids I recommend the much more imaginative 3-D film Coraline, if it's still playing near you.",1238803200,8,1273,5.175609756097561

DreamWorks Animation dishes up a terrific family movie with MONSTERS VS ALIENS. The story is a bit thin but who cares? the characters rock. Susan Murphy gets hit by a meteorite just before her wedding in Modesto, California, and she grows to an incredible 49 feet, 11 inches in height. The U.S. Army ""captures"" her and incarcerates her in a secret monster facility underground, where she meets her fellow monsters: a smart mutant half-cockroach helpfully named Dr. Cockroach, a blob of blue protoplasm named B.O.B., the fishy Link, and the giant Insectosaurus.

Susan (who has been given the code name Ginormica) and the rest of the monster crew are released and commissioned to defend earth against a gigantic evil robot--and after an epic battle, they are victorious. Too bad about the Golden Gate Bridge but it can be built again better than new, surely? Susan tries to settle back in to her old life but at just under 50 feet tall, it really doesn't work out for her. Her sleazy fiance dumps her to focus on his career in broadcasting, and Susan realizes that she has true friends among the monsters and takes pleasure in her power. When the alien threat to Earth reappears (""I come in peace. Most of you will be killed ... but I come in peace"") Susan and the crew save Earth.

The 3D graphics are superb; this is a movie that entertained all of us from the five-year-old on up.  The voice casting generally worked well, especially Reese Witherspoon as Susan and Hugh Laurie as Dr. Cockroach. I was dubious about Susan when I first saw her Barbie-like looks and shape, but this is a girl who gets by on her brains and power, so there was no damage control necessary with my granddaughters. (Who knew that getting hit with a meteorite on your wedding day and growing to 50 feet tall could turn out to be good luck?) As for violence, you can't expect monsters and aliens to clash without somebody getting hurt, but mostly there was a lot of spectacular roaring and blowing up and nothing to speak of in the way of gore.

I can see that I've been missing out on a fine treat by skipping these DreamWorks productions. Count me in! Kid or no kid, if this bunch of lovable monsters goes on the road with a sequel, save me a seat.

3602845,4,B001GCUO7K,"This amusing and kid-safe bit of fluff makes me wish for a rainy Saturday and a bucket of popcorn. It starts off tamely enough, with Our Heroine preparing herself for the white wedding of every girl's dreams. At the very last instant, that goes horribly awry - providing a cringeworthy moment for anyone who's seen last minute catastrophes at big family events.

In a moment, Susan transforms from the princess in the fairy tail to the monster. At this point, cue the secret military lab, self-important general, and aliens promised by the movie's title. Mousy habits of a lifetime die hard, but Monster Susan really comes into her own as the battle progresses, and discovers a lot more in herself than she or anyone had ever seen.

""Anyone"" includes the fiance that dumped her at the altar when 'for better or worse' got worse than he bargained for. But, now that Susan is something really special, he's suddenly willing to give her another chance at boosting his career. Susan has a career of her own now (monstering and saving Earth), and realizes she can do better than him. I like the message: a girl doesn't have to settle for any jerk just so she can have a boyfriend. So, if you have a kid, a rainy afternoon, and a yen for popcorn, give this movie a try - but remember, the kid is optional.
