351542,5,630176031X,"The K&I is one of my all time favorites.  Loosely based on the true novel, ""Anna and the King of Siam"" it is stunning both visually and musically.  An interesting aside is that Miss Kerr does not sing.  A  (at the time) young woman by the name of Marni Nixon sang for Miss Kerr.  They stood side by side in the dubbing booth, and while Ms. Kerr spoke her  lines, Marni would interject her singing parts.  This is especially  noticeable on ""He's Spoiled.""  None-the-less an outstanding  watch.",921542400,,492,4.551724137931035
351543,5,630176031X,"The good news - not since its original theatrical release has there been a brighter, cleaner, more colorful print available.  The THX restoration in both conventional pan and scan and widescreen versions is the definitive  one.  Gone are the fuzziness and color bleeding of past video prints. The  superb warm DeLuxe color is returned to glory and the stereophonic sound is  vibrant and rich. In the widescreen version some of the compositions are  stunning: Anna, Louis, Captain Orton, the horizontal line of slaves and the  Kralahome in the first ship scene; the horizontal processional through the  marketplace to the Palace; the first shot of the King high on a distant  throne surrounded by gold; dictation of the letter to Lincoln with Anna and  the King filling the screen in prostration; the emphasized separation of  Lun Tha and Tuptim in the ""We Kiss In A Shadow"" scene, placed at  opposite ends of the screen reaching across to each other; the Act One  Finale in the temple with the King and Anna again filling the scene in a  prostration test (Who is taming who?); the polka sequence; and most  tellingly one of the last shots at the King's deathbed with Anna in  close-up at far left of screen, the King in the center and Chulalongkorn  and Lady Thiang subordinate in the upper right of screen - emphasizing  Anna's final dominance over the court. New to this print, emphasizing the  original theatricality of the work, is an overture, intermission entr'acte  music and exit music - never in the original print, but derived from  masters of Alfred Newman's background scoring: the Overture consists of  ""Western People Funny"" and ""I Have Dreamed"" from Anna's  unpacking scene, segueing into the intro to ""Shall We Dance""  underscoring and ending with the polka itself; the Entr'acte takes the  underscoring of Anna's and Lun Tha's first meeting, using ""I Have  Dreamed"" and ""Hello, Young Lovers"" from that scene, sequeing  into ""I Whistle A Happy Tune"" and a repeat of the ""Shall We  Dance? polka; Exit Music is the ""March of the Siamese Children""  lifted in whole from that scene.  The only bad news: there are so many  scenes stuffed with people all shot from head to toe or at least head to  knee, that the images are often so tiny as to hurt the eyes; also this  makes for difficulty reading a lot of facial expressions.  Ideally you  should buy both the pan and scan AND the widescreen editions of this  restoration.  If you're a fan of the work, RUN to acquire both and have the  definitive editions to study and enjoy. Note: Both ""Western People  Funny"" and ""I Have Dreamed"" so notably used in the Overture  and Entr'Acte, are never heard in the film except as background scoring.  Also with these added musical portions the running time of 133 minutes is  extended by eight or nine minutes.",921110400,5,2811,4.782881002087683
351544,5,630176031X,"A warm, humane, wise Rogers & Hammerstein classic in both music and lyrics.

Yes, the people were real at one time in history, but of course this was made at a time of song, dance and theatrical movies.  I recommend this movie to any age.

351760,1,630176031X,"I've always loved The King and I. When I was 16, (several geological eons ago) I saw a live performance at the Carter Baron Amphitheater in Washington, DC-- a birthday present, starring Deborah Kerr and Farley Granger. It took me quite some time to accept Graner's Irish-black hair, waxed down. Besides, I think we can all agree that Yul Brynner ""owned"" the role of the King. The reason for this low rating for this DVD is that the song ""Is a Puzzlement"" has been omitted.",1520467200,3,472,4.564705882352941

This is the 2nd time I've attempted to watch it to completion - but something has remained from the time i watched it as a child! Though this film is Lush, Marvelous, Beautiful, Fantastical, to me, it is still a very SAD story of a good-hearted king struggling with his traditional demons, while he so much would like to break away from them - so that never in his rule, he'd ever be considered a BARBARIAN!

352252,5,630176031X,"It is the early 1800's and King Mongkut of Siam (Yul Brynner) realizes that a good education is necessary to survive and also paramount for the survival of Siam. So he sends off for a teacher for his many offspring.

His choice a widow Anna Leonowens (Deborah Kerr) and her son Louis Leonowens (Rex Thompson).

King Mongkut does not keep a promise of a separate living quarter for Anna and her son. He also is smug and overbearing. This will lead to several things he did not plan on including a Siam's play version of ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" With little Lisa on the ice flows.

Mean while The King's son Prince Chulalongkorn (Patrick Adiarte) seems to be more amenable to leaning the ways of the western world.

Can the king save Siam from the imperialists?
Will Anna be a help?

There was an earlier film version of this story ""Anna and the King of Siam"" with Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison which has a different feel. The other film does not have the advantage of talent music of Rodgers & Hammerstein.",1505174400,2,999,4.497237569060774

Of course if you compare image quality of Star Wars vs Rogue One, you will definitely see a big difference. But I will tell you King and I Blu ray is much better than DVD.

This is Yul Brynner at his finest - the signature role that would define him for generations. Marni Nixon is the singing voice of Deborah Kerr (she also sang for Natalie Wood in West Side Story) and a young Rita Moreno is beautiful in the role of Tuptim. The film was released in 1956 and the story line reflects those times - two strong personalities develop an unspoken affection and respect for each other along with an underlying romantic tension. This is a classic musical production - fabulous costumes and acting all around.  And of course the Rodgers and Hammerstein score still stands the test of time.
I did think the lenght of the movie was a bit long but again that is a reflection of that era.
Every fan of musical theatre needs to see this - the magnetism of Brynner and the genius of Rodgers and Hammerstein combines for musical magic.",1501459200,,963,4.502857142857143

This a delightful and extremely popular Rogers and Hammerstein's musical which is perhaps one of their finest offerings
which not only see's 'Yul Brynner' and 'Deborah Kerr' perform in their most memorable roles, but also offers many-a-
memorable song (not forgetting the 'March of The Siamese Children') much humour tinged with a little sadness.
It tells the partially true story of widow 'Anna Leonowens' travelling to 'Siam' with her young son 'Louis' to take up the
post of Teacher/Governess  to the King 'Mongkut of Siam's' many, many children.
'Anna' will quickly become attached to the children.
We see the gradual development of mutual respect grow between the King and Anna, the King though very much in the
mould of his forefathers is eager to move with the times but is afraid to show weakness, however he does come to value
the views and advice 'Anna' offers him.
'Anna' in turn try's to show no fear of the Kings status but is mindful of his pride and attempts to make her advice seem
like idea's of his own.
There is sadness from 'Tuptin' a wife who had been presented to him as a gift....she loves another.....
'Tuptin' narrates her version of 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' to act as entertainment for the Kings illustrious dinner guest, but the
King is not amused by the slavery theme....
After 'Tuptin's' failed attempt to escape, the King is intent on punishment but 'Anna's' protest prevents the action, and
what she say's to him deeply affects him.
Much humour, Great Songs.....
Most fans of the 50's and 60's musical presentations will no doubt have seen the film (many,many moons have past since
i last watched the film in truth) for those that haven't the film easily crosses the swathes of time and will i feel be enjoyed
over and over again for many a generation to come.
The Film presented as a 3-Disc Set....The Blu-Ray upgrade on Disc One for the 60 year old film i feel is pretty good, contrary
to what some have suggested...i was well pleased.

And the role of Anna, played by Debra Kerr, is too harsh, in my opinion. Such a sad ending. After so much beautiful dancing and singing and laughing. Well worth seeing, but be warned about the tragic ending. Yul Brynner played this role 4,300 times on stage!!! He stole the show. What an amazing performance.",1497139200,,481,4.540229885057471

352598,4,630176031X,"Long overdue re-mastering of this chestnut. The first dvd version wasn't even anamorphic, so that meant it couldn't  be expanded to full screen on modern tvs without losing some detail and sharpness. This is a major improvement, although the reviews haven't been particularly  strong. The added extras also were valuable. It was a part of that big, expensive  Rodgers and Hammerstein box set, which I wanted, but didn't want to spring for,  when I had every item on dvd and laser and had outgrown my fascination with most of the films. But they all were released singly and I have been able to pick up the big items, individually, when they have been on sale. The actual  film is ok, I guess.

She commanded respect, he demanded respect and together they became equals. The music was absolutely, a marvelous treat. I just watched it again with my ten year old daughter on Mother's Day! How moving our time together was; to share a passion of mine with her! How anyone could rate this production below 5 stars, I do not know!

And thirdly, not anything against this particular film, BUT why are these movies $3.99 to rent, even as an Amazon Prime member??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
I used to walk to Blockbuster, get three movies to rent, bring them home for two nights, walked home in the snow, had an actual physical product in my grimy little paws,  and it was only $3.00.  Why is it that these are just a button away and they cost three times as much?

353454,5,630176031X,"50th Anniversary Edition = Color has been more than restored. It has been brightened and intensified. Many comments here badmouth blue haze, etc. IT'S LIGHTING EFFECTS!!! Blue lighting is often used to counter (or enhance) scenes with lots of gold and yellow. There's a lot of rose or pink lighting as well. It is not defective color processing. When you look at the plane furthest away in the set it is also a painting, so the whole set is lighted like a stage production. I recall seeing this in theaters in the early Sixties in reissue. Colors didn't leach from negatives until 1970's--Eastman being cheaper than Technicolor. There is also a lot of coral/orange and pink/lavender hues used in the costuming I suppose to complement Anna's red hair. If you think some of scenes are a tad goofy color-wise, the next film in the R & H catalogue is/was South Pacific where they actually used different colored filters on all the musical numbers. It won an Academy award for visual effects. (Go figure!)",1467849600,3,1000,4.786127167630058

353523,3,630176031X,"The Blu-Ray is a disappointment. The picture is only barely acceptable. It's dark and has inconsistent color and a strong blue cast. It exaggerates saturation and contrast and appears slightly fuzzy on a 50"" TV. The sound is even more disappointing. The quality is only barely better than that of a portable radio. Even with a soundbar, it's difficult to hear that the track is ""hi-fi,"" let alone ""stereo."" How it qualifies as DTS-HD is a mystery. The features are fine, but a restored version of ""The King and I"" using current technology remains a work in progress. At the mid-2016 price of $17, the 3-disc set may be the best available and not a bad value. But as an upgrade, it doesn't justify a new purchase.",1465776000,3,712,4.6141732283464565

354499,5,630176031X,"Maybe M-G-M's most lavish musical ever. Definitely Hammerstein's best. The story is 100% true and surprisingly accurately told for a musical. Yul Brenner gives his final and possibly best screen performance as the King of Siam. If you only see one super M-G-M musical in your life, forget ""Sound of Money(music)"" and watch this. I performed in the pit orchestra live on Broadway with the late Yul Brenner, and it's as enjoyable to perform as it is to watch. Hollywood can do production numbers on a soundstage you can never do in a theater, and they did here.",1444608000,,559,4.714285714285714

Just because it's a Blu-ray disc does not mean the picture has to be blue as well but unfortunately this version IS very blue! Also, the road show overture was cut which surprises me because this is supposed to be the ultimate version available up to now? WRONG! The sound is top quality and the extra features are interesting if you care about the history and evolution of this musical. Stick to the DVD for now with it's rich warm colors and a great road show overture! Either an upgraded Blue-ray or a 4K version will be released in the distant future.

When I played it, i saw what they meant. It looked pretty weird, with just blue and dull gold. Trouble is, blue and gold are the colors of the movie. The picture itself, however, was lovely. What I did was go to my TV controls, and bumped up the color saturation quite a bit. That did the trick, then it looked as radiant and colorful as the DVD. That's it for the picture. As for the sound, the uncompressed DTS 4.1 soundtrack is so strong, bright and spectacular, I was crying 10 seconds into the opening credits. Don't pass this up! You can twiddle your TV to make up for the low-key color setting and have a wonderful viewing -- and especially listening! -- experience.

That the film looks absolutely tremendous on BlueRay and deserves to be immortalised as such. My only gripe is we are not seeing the entire original show with the number of songs cut out, though on the soundtrack album and maybe one or two not even making it onto the soundtrack.

Perhaps they were worried about making it to too long for audiences or maybe they wanted more sessions in the day.

It should have had the same knockout presentation as the 70mm TODD-AO version of OKLAHOMA! (now also wonderfully restored... at last!!).

That aside, but, what we have is just great. We get to see Yul Brynner in his most famous role and that's worth the price of admission alone!",1418169600,,716,4.484615384615385

355776,3,630176031X,"Blu-Ray, with its high definition picture, color and sound, is an ideal format for musicals. So, my hopes were high for 20th Century Fox's opulent ""The King And I"" (1956) on Blu-Ray. Instead, I was shocked. In many places, the color and picture looked washed out or muddled. It looked as if someone had taken a fading print of ""The King And I"" and transferred it to Blu-Ray. Previously, I had been blown away by such musical classics as ""West Side Story"" and ""The Sound Of Music"" on Blu-Ray, which fairly pop with vividness in Blu-Ray High Definition. Not so here. I watched the entire movie, but knew ""The King And I"" should not look like this on Blu-Ray. So I did a test. I got out my DVD of ""The King And I"" from the 2005 ""Rodgers And Hammerstein Collection."" I watched the first 15 minutes of the movie again. Sure enough. Everything was sharper and clearer on DVD! This combo pack also includes two DVDS. Hopefully, they also look better than the Blu-ray. All the Extras from the 2005 DVD edition seem to also be included here.
  The Blu-Ray bust is especially disappointing because ""The King And I"" features the most crackling and complicated central relationship in all of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals. Yul Brynner and Deborah Kerr play the multiple conflicts between the mercurial  King  and the high-minded English governess Anna beautifully. This is, in fact, a musical drama, or more accurately, musical tragedy. And it is a tragedy that comes out of the best of intentions. The King was born a conservative, but he wants to be a liberal, modern monarch. Anna comes to Siam with an open heart, if not necessarily an open mind. She is sincerely interested in, and wants to help, the people of Siam. And she is fascinated by the charismatic King. Anna and the King march, argue, sing and dance towards a shaky mutual understanding. But this only leads to a heartbreaking stalemate. The story, music, songs, costumes, and the performances are all excellent. So, please, 20th Century Fox, fix this muddy Blu-Ray mess. ""The King And I"" definitely deserves a better presentation and restoration on ""HD Blu-Ray"" than this.",1416182400,96,2134,4.7594594594594595

355862,4,630176031X,"I've been wanting to rent this for a long time. I finally did the other night.  As usual with R&H musicals, it's a love story between two misfits.  Although Brenner is over the top at first, it's hard not to be charmed by his performance.  What can be said about Deborah Kerr that hasn't been said before?  A breathtaking beauty and excellent actress.  How the hell she did the duet of hand fan dancing was a mystery to me.  The great Marnie Nixon and Kerr pull off a seamless singing dubbing job.  Nixon in her autobiography writes Kerr was her favorite partner.  An actress who worked closely with Nixon to pull it off.

I would love to purchase this film but the rental copy has me exercising caution.  Although the soundtrack is remastered in the THX format, the print itself is in bad need of work.  Colors are bleached out at this point.  But still a wonderfully entertaining musical unfortunately the score is cut too. Typical of versions made by Hollywood while the soundtrack on CD is complete.",1413590400,,1003,4.573033707865169

356218,5,630176031X,"Based upon a true story from when there was no safety net and women in particular were at a disadvantage in supporting themselves or family.  Anna Leonowens is hired by the King of Siam to teach his children to have ""a scientific mind"" and raise the country to first world standing.  The widow, Anna, falsified her credentials but only needs to be a step ahead of the King to keep her job.  In the course of her duties she effectively becomes an advisor to the King although he would never say so.  These are 2 strong characters and there is great interplay as the King breaks his promise to provide Anna with a brick house of her own and how Anna manages to manipulate him to get the house.
Aside:  My grandmother was married to a German musician when WWI began and was left alone with 3 children when her husband deserted her.  She did a lot of things to survive including reading tea leaves.  Similar to Anna she lied in a job application.  She applied to a church that was looking for a housekeeper for the priests.  When she was asked if she could cook she replied ""of course"" and got the job.  Then with her last few dollars se went out and bought a cookbook!
I'm sure there must be lots of other true stories just like this.

In a few places when a character is in the center of the picture, his voice comes from the left or right speaker and then moves to the center.

356762,5,630176031X,"Growing up on musicals, I have a strong bias towards some of these classic films.  Sure, I can see with more mature eyes their faults, but my adoration for most of them is unwavering.  `The King and I' is one of those films that I saw so many times as a child that I will continue to adore it for a lifetime, and even recent viewings confirm that love.  It holds up, and is something I look forward to introducing to a new generation of children, namely my own kids.  There is something so beautiful and inviting about films like `The King and I'.  Containing rapturous scores that lift you up, stunning cinematography and dramatic performances that draw you in and keep you wrapped in their arms, these magical gems are here to delight us viewing after viewing.

This melodramatic musical tells the story of Anna Leonowens, a young teacher and single mother who travels to Siam with her son in order to educate the King's young children.  Despite a rocky start, Anna falls in love with the King's children and stays in order to `get to know them'.  In the process, she forms a close relationship with the King, becoming an advisor of sorts (with obvious romantic undertones) and also becomes attached to a slave girl, Tuptim, and winds up supporting her in her desire to escape and wed her beloved (a very `Romeo and Juliet' type moment).

The political aspects of the film can feel slightly one sided, but the balance given to fleshing out the conundrum of humanity, brutality and custom is remarkably astute.  The musical numbers are beautiful and keep one glued to the screen, frame by frame, scene by scene.  The central performances are very well done.  I know that a lot of people balk at Brynner's Oscar win, but he was tremendous here.  He shades the King with such tempered humanity and really underscores the emotional growth he goes through over the course of the film.  Deborah Kerr is beyond marvelous here.  She was dubbed in her musical numbers, but it doesn't matter since she sells every moment, even in her musical numbers.

The costumes and sets are marvelous and give the film a glossy veneer.

This is a very involved yet effortless film.  There is so much depth and so many plot points and so many messages within messages and yet it never feels stuffy or overwrought.  Walter Lang takes hold of his source material and gives it undeniable life and makes this classic film one for the ages, all ages, and that is a rarity indeed!",1376611200,14,2452,4.608294930875576

I guess the 5 dollar movie clearance bin has spoiled me because I balk at $20 movies when they aren't new releases. I suppose I have to say it was worth it though, not to mention, even the non anniversary version is nearly the same high price. It was nice to see once again, it's as charming and timeless as you would expect from something so widely loved. The theme addresses slavery and racism, where the civil war is being fought on one side of the globe and the Europeans are practicing expansion for the prevention of barbarianism. If I had something negative to say it would be that with as much independence or as the king says, ""difficulty"" as Anna exhibits she puts herself in as much of a derogatory position as the other women are forced into. I guess her love for the king is special, because no matter how many wives he has, she's worth just a bit more to him. I didn't find it as touching when I thought about that.
On the whole it's flawless, and beautifully decorated, performed and sung. The extras which we haven't finished are a nice touch (once again, disappointed that there is not closed captioning available for the extras like commentary - I guess it never occurred to these people that it's old people that like musicals; the kids are either at the rock concerts or the boy band concerts preparing their ears for closed captioning in the future). It was surprising to learn a lot of the songs were dubbed. Anna's voice was provided by Marni Nixon who also sang for Eliza in My Fair Lady.

(She didn't use words like sexy in those days.) This movie is, at the very least, a happy memory for me. Of course it is much more: for one thing, it is probably Rodgers and Hammerstein's best.

Yul Brenner is the King of Siam (now called Thailand) in 1862. Deborah Kerr is Anna Leonowens, the English widow he hires to teach his children, of which he has a great many. The king has decided that his country must become modern and ""scientific,"" as he puts it. And I'll tell you right now before you get too excited, Anna does not become yet another wife.

An important sub-plot involves Rita Moreno as Tuptim, who is brought from Burma as a gift to the king. Problem is, she is in love with the man who brought her there, and wants to go back to him. He sneaks into the ""house of women's"" garden to see her, even though he would be killed if he was caught. Anna sympathizes with them, and it is for them she sings ""Hello, Young Lovers.""

In fact, one can almost tell this story by way of the songs, even though it's not an opera, and there are plenty of speaking scenes too. But no doubt you will recognize the names of most of these songs.

I Whistle a Happy Tune
Hello, Young Lovers
A Puzzlement
Getting to Know You
We Kiss in a Shadow
Something Wonderful
Song of the King
Shall We Dance?

One of the best parts of this film is a play written by Tuptim, ""The Small House of Uncle Thomas."" It is essentially a Siamese version of ""Uncle Tom's Cabin,"" which Anna loaned her to read. (Remember that Tuptim is herself a slave.) It is charming, but bears only a passing resemblance to the story of the antebellum south. Buddha is given credit for making a miracle by sending an angel to blow cold air on the river and make the water hard, hard enough to walk on. Then when King Simon of Legree comes to capture poor Eliza, the second miracle occurs: the angel calls out the sun to make the water soft and King Simon of Legree and his men (and hound dogs) are all drowned. I think she got a little mixed up with Moses and the Pharaoh there.

The movie has many charming touches, including fabulous sets, costumes to die for, and many adorable little children. There's also the fact that Yul Brenner is bare-chested much of the time.",1337040000,2,2384,4.286666666666667
357719,5,630176031X,"First off, I should say I haven't seen this in years. True, I ordered it from Amazon, but when I went to put it on the shelf, I realized it's the same edition I'd bought a couple of years ago. I was thinking this was a newer edition with additional bells and whistles.

But as for the film, it's wonderful. THE KING AND I has always been my favorite Rodgers & Hammerstein musical...by far. It's also one of the most perfect dubbing jobs Marni Nixon ever did. I read somewhere that she had a slight cold when she recorded Anna's singing voice, which made it match Deborah Kerr's speaking voice more closely.

OK, so the people of Thailand have banned it. OK, so Yul Brynner wasn't Siamese/Thai. (Neither was Lou Diamond Phillips or Yun Fat Chow.) Let's face it: there aren't too many Thai actors who could do the part. In fact, most of them have names too long to fit on a marquee!

I'm still very much upset that there's no surviving footage of the soliloquy ""Shall I Tell You What I Think of You?"" I KNOW that when I first saw the movie when it originally was released, that scene was in it. I can close my eyes and picture it quite clearly. And there are stills from it, which are used over the soundtrack as one of the 2nd-disc bonus features on this edition, so it WAS filmed. Where is it? Who at 20th Century-Fox hid it away so that no one to this day can find it?

This film is highly recommended. A beautiful film beautifully done.",1330128000,,1438,4.295202952029521
357720,5,630176031X,"This was a great purchase. The musical numbers are so memorable and lovely to hear--younger viewers may not recognize some of them, but they stand the test of time:  ""Shall We Dance"" is still so romantic, ""We Kiss in a Shadow"" truly tells the story of people in love, and ""Hello Young Lovers"" tells of the generous heart that has known true love.  Beyond the romantic aspect of the story, however, is the struggle of the King to bring his country out of third world status--something that easily resonates even today. The musical is quite true to the factual account in the book, ""Anna and the King of Siam"".  There are a few deviations in the story (for example the slaves were actually burned at the stake for running away--but this would have put quite the damper on a musical--even so the treatment accurately depicted the harsh cruelty toward slaves).  The story of slavery is one that should not be forgotten--the historical ties to the United States and our own struggle with the slavery issue at that same time period is very well done.  The middle school teachers showed this film to our students, since there is so much of world history, customs and challenges still faced by countries and individuals today, there is quite an educational opportunity. Certainly as entertainment, The King and I is funny, thoughtful, interesting, lavishly produced, musically lyrical and memorable.  As a history study, it is also a worthwhile way to learn about a place and a period of time.  The quality of the DVD was fantastic. I highly recommend it.",1329523200,,1547,4.793233082706767

357727,5,630176031X,"First, let me set the record straight.  This 50th anniverserary DVD is the definitive cut of the film.  It is presented exactly as it premiered in 1956.  Those of you complaining that half the musical score is gone, get over it! How many musicals do you know that have been transfered to the screen with the score intact? Even the most successful stage to screen transfers including The Sound of Music was changed for the screen; the latter being a far superior rendition than the stage version.  Ernest Lehman was responsible for both the screenplays of King & I and Sound of Music.  The songs that are usually omitted from screen versions of musicals are the ones that do not advance the story, sung by secondary characters, or were used for scene changes. This is true of King & I with the ommission of My Lord and Master, I Have Dreamed, Western People Funnny, etc.  Anna's Sililoquoy was omitted simply because it gave Anna too harsh of a personality for the screen.  Would King & I been a success on the screen with the original score intact? Probably.  But it would have been too long, one thing that  Twentieth Century Fox President Darrly F. Zanuck would not allow.  So those of you hoping the Blu Ray will have more scenes in it, don't hold your breath.  With 9 academy award nominations and 6 wins, this is still a great film.",1310256000,5,1337,4.529166666666667

357889,5,630176031X,"This is arguably Rogers & Hammerstein's best work and certainly the one which is most faithful to the original stage musical, with Yul Brenner recreating his role as the King of Siam.  The themes of racism, bigotry, and xenophobia are (sadly) just as relevant today as when the play was first written.  It took considerable courage for Rogers and Hammerstein to create this musical and they did so without falling back on any of the cliche's of Eastern culture that is still often seen today. A truly elegant and powerful music given its full justice in this film version.  If you love musicals and music theatre but have not yet seen The King & I then you do not yet know just how much you love the musical.",1306022400,,708,4.515625

358041,5,630176031X,"Unlike most musicals, this isn't a love story (although it has one as a secondary plot); it's the story of two strong-minded people struggling to reach mutual understanding and respect across a cultural chasm.  In 1862, Anna Leonowens (Deborah Kerr) arrives in Bangkok, with her 12-year-old son Louis (Rex Thompson), to take up a position as teacher to the Siamese King's flock of children.  She and the King (Yul Brynner) immediately butt heads over the issue of the ""brick residence adjoining the palace"" which the King has conveniently forgotten promising her, and Anna is ready to turn right around and go back to England, but when she meets the children, including Crown Prince Chulalongkorn (Patrick Adiarte), she's smitten and stays.  As time goes by, though the house problem remains unresolved and there is often friction over Anna's teaching and over such cultural roadblocks as the existence of slavery (the King's harem includes Tuptim (Rita Moreno), a ""gift"" from the King of Burma, who is pining for her lost love, Lun Tha (Carlos Rivas)), the two of them slowly begin to appreciate each other, and Anna becomes the king's sometime secretary, confidant, and even advisor, culminating in a brilliantly successful banquet for Sir Edward Ramsay (Geoffrey Toone), the Queen's personal plenipotentiary.  But when Tuptim and Lun Tha plot to run away together, it begins to look as if all Anna and the King have gained will be lost.

The high point of the movie is, of course, the inimitable Brynner, recreating (at the age of 36) his original stage role of five years before (he had had one other film appearance and a long list of TV credits, but it was this part that brought him wdespread fame, and he so made it his own that it's impossible to think of it as being played by anyone else).  Like the much darker and more tragic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Samurai-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B0001JXOVC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Samurai (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>, which is also about an Oriental country struggling to join the modern world, the story is based on fact: King Mongkut (the name by which he was generally known outside his own country) was passed over for the throne in favor of a half-brother, devoted his life to religion, travelled all around the country as a monk, and became the first abbot of Wat Bowonniwet before he ascended the throne in 1851, aged 47; he embraced Western innovations and initiated the modernization of Siam, both in technology and culture, which earned him the epithet ""The Father of Science and Technology.""  Kerr plays off her co-star perfectly, and co-stars Terry Saunders, who plays chief wife Lady Thiang, and Martin Benson as the Kralahome (a sort of Prime Minister) provide a background motif ranging from loyal helpfulness to jealous dislike.  The sets and costumes are gorgeous and the music everything you'd expect from the talented and prolific team of Rodgers & Hammerstein, although several good songs from the stage version (""My Lord and Master,"" ""Shall I Tell You What I Think of You?,"" and ""I Have Dreamed"") were inexplicably left out of the film score.  Perhaps the most delightful sequence comes near the end, as Anna teaches the King to polka and they swirl joyously around the polished floor of one of the palace's many rooms--which makes the ending, when it comes, all the more pognant.  (As many times as I've seen it, this remains one of the very few movies that can make me tear up.)

I know that this is not good history for Thailand and in fact the film is banned in Thailand (but a bootleg copy can be found on every street corner) because of the poor history and light on it's great king, King Mongkut.  To me as an American, I can see the brilliance of a Rogers and Hammerstein Musical and enjoy its wonderful story and entertainment, it is different for a Thai person.  Still the art is there and I find it highly enjoyable.  I grew up with this musical and find it beautiful.  Debra Kerr and Yul Brynner round out a perfect cast with Rita Moreno as TupTim.  The story, sets, song and acting are nearly perfect.  I wish the story was more accurate but it might have taken away from the magical fantasy of the place too.  In actuality, King Mongkut was a great modernizer of Siam and was known as being very well educated and good to the people.  He was not raised to the King, his older brother was but as a Buddhist monk.  He was 46 when he ascended the throne and still had many wives and children to show for it.  His son King Chulalongkorn continued the modernization of Siam and is considered of the greatest kings also.  The Thai revere them and don't like them made to look ridiculous like disbelieving there is snow or dying because of a broken heart.  King Mongkut actually did write Abraham Lincoln and offer him elephants to use in the Civil War though!  Fascinating history.",1227571200,,1492,4.355072463768116

358360,3,630176031X,"This is not my favorite Rodgers and Hammerstein musical.  Oh, there is a great deal to recommend the movie--Yul Brynner's performance, the lush setting, etc.  My quarrel with it is that the songs don't always fit the story and the story behind the songs isn't all that good.

For example, the first song appears when Anna, the governess, arrives at the dock in Siam with her son:  ""Whistle a Happy Tune.""  It feels completely out of place, even though it reprises in an attempt to show how Anna faces a frightening situation.  The same comment applies to ""Hello Young Lovers.""  It's not that the music is bad; it's that it feels as if the songs were written and then the authors looked around for a place to put them.

The only real love story is between the Burmese girl, a gift to the king, and the young man who brought her to the king.  And that forbidden love story is--well--sickly, treacly--one I'll fast forward past if I ever watch this again.

Perhaps the best part of the movie, for me, was the play within a play, ""The Small House of Uncle Thomas.""  It works well within the plot and is fun to watch.

There are some nice songs, of course, and there is Yul Brynner.  But it's still not ""South Pacific"" or ""Oklahoma.""  The comparisons just can't be avoided.",1204588800,,1268,4.4803493449781655

She arrives in Thailand with her own son Louis(Rex Thompson)ans proceeds to discharge her duties with style and grace. Unfortunately there are clashes between her and the King. He is an autocratic monarch who brooks no opposition and a chauvinist of the first magnitude unused to assertive women.she is no timid shrinking violet being a strong determined woman .with her own road to hoe .A widow with a young child in a foreign nation she does not merely kowtow but stands her ground .
We see her at work ,becoming a tutor and counsellor -solving the problems of the household including an especially knotty one involving Tuptim(Rita Morenmo) a ""gift"" to the King from another monarch. She  loves another man and is desperate to leave
As the governess and the monarch clash the verbal sparring transforms into something else -a deep affection and mutual admiration ,even love.
The movie is one of the few musicals that would work without the music -the theme itself is so strong and  and the script, by Ernest Lehmann is outstanding and for my money improves on the original stage version. However we do have music and glorious music it is too.-Rodgers and Hammerstein at their best with wonderful standards like Getting To Know You ,amd Hello Young Lovers to the fore .

Anna upon leaving the Royal Court here exagerated her importance for self agrandizment  Also the movies portrayal of the Kings devotions to Lord Buddha is insulting to Buddhism.

There is too, the non-musical vbersion, Anna and the King of Siam with Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison as the King..very good, and interesting in watching the British Empire stuff recede into the background, as Mrs. Anna begins to need the Siamese more than they need he, and here, the king especially. It's on DVD and well worth the purchase.

This 1956 musical version has the great Rogers and Hammerstein score and the fabulous Yul Brynner and  radiant Deborah Kerr to put it all together. She is outstanding anyway in any thing, and Yul Brynner and Ms Kerr are dynamite as a couple in this, as they are later on in the very inetersting film, The Journey.

I think here it is their collective belief in the material and their respective exhuberance to show us they love this musical, plus their talents, that make the film such a must see.

Also, this film was shot in Cinemascope 55(I believe) that greatly enhances all of it, if you habe Big Screen TV. I remember it when it came out, the curved screen and the stereophonicsound, so unbelievable and rich!

""Something Wonderful"" is similar to ""Climb Every Mountain"".  The wife who sings ""Something..."" is similar to the Reverand Mother.  The whole thing is ""Romeo and Juliet"" becomes ""West Side Story"".

358563,4,630176031X,"It's been decades since I was in high school, but I still remember being taken aback by the fact that the script for THE KING AND I was included in my junior year English Lit Anthology.  As it happens, it was never actually assigned, but I remember being utterly baffled by its inclusion (could a Broadway musical merit inclusion among more serious works of literature?) and at least skimmed through it at the time.  Somehow the notion of members of the Siamese court staging a stylized production of UNCLE TOM'S CABIN just seemed too weird--or maybe just not weird enough-- for my adolescent brain.  Looking back, I'm not sure why I didn't find that kind of cross-cultural meld more interesting.  But it WAS 1968, and ANY Broadway musical (with the possible exception of the then-current HAIR) would have been way too ESTABLISHMENT for my emerging, uh, countercultural tastes.

But giving it the once over, I had to admit that the text embraced at least it one or two serious IDEAS.  So maybe it was worthy of inclusion in the anthology.  (And, hey, the rest of the book's selections weren't all literary masterpieces either.)  Of course, a few years later--or maybe several years later--I would prove to be much more receptive to a work like THE KING AND I.  In fact, oddly enough, a few years BEFORE I probably would have embraced it more eagerly too.  In my late childhood, early adolescent stage I was just precocious enough that almost ANYTHING that seemed to smack of grown up sophistication would have appealed to me.

So maybe age 16 was just the wrong age to encounter THE KING AND I--especially in 1968.  It probably would come as no surprise to anyone reading this that I have seen the film several times as an adult and appreciate it more each time that I do.  It does succeed as sheer entertainment and spectacle of course.  The ""Shall We Dance?"" sequence alone is worth the price of admission (or the price of rental or purchase for home view).  Visually, that scene--like so much else in the movie--is just gorgeous.

And it's really only been in the past few years that I have come to appreciate the ""Little House of Uncle Thomas"" production for the masterpiece of interpretive dance that it is.

It may also come as something of a surprise to viewers my age (and younger) just how many of the Rodgers and Hammerstein tunes from the show were musical staples on THE ED SULLIVAN SHOW or were radio hits of the day.  Aside from the above mentioned ""Shall We Dance?"" the show also gave rise to such classics as ""Whistle A Happy Tune""  and ""Hello Young Lovers"" and the perhaps somewhat lesser known ""Something Wonderful.""  And musically, they really are something wonderful at that.  (And yes, I know that that would have been the last thing I would have owned up to at 16.)

Of course, with all that nourishment for the eye and the ear, did it really need much intellectual heft--or even enough of a message to warrant being included in a high school anthology.  Well, there are those who would argue that even the most escapist genres in the popular arts still have a social or cultural subtext.  And Broadway musicals are certainly no exception to the rule, even in the B.S. era (that is to say, ""Before Sondheim"").  While no one would look to even the most sophisticated musical for genuine insight into the human condition, they can address important themes as well as or better than other popular arts.

THE KING AND I at least touches upon such important themes as: justice;  classism; imperialism; feudalism; cross-cultural influence; the relation of the sexes; the nature of true nobility; intellectual striving...the list goes on and on.  Had I been open to it as a teenager, it certainly could have provided me with ideas enough to chew over--certainly as many as most of the other selections in that literary anthology.  And had the soundtrack been available to me as well, it would have certainly provided me with a more than a few moments of musical (guilty?) pleasure even then.

Certainly, I appreciate it now!",1182211200,3,4039,4.712250712250713
358564,5,630176031X,"THE KING AND I was one of my earlier introductions to the great body of work, from the team of Rodgers and Hammerstein.  This film showcases Deborah Kerr, as Anna Leonowens (with the singing voice of Marni Nixon--the ""ghost singer"" for many Hollywood starlets) and Yul Brynner, as the King of Siam, at his bald-headed best.  This is the musical remake of ANNA AND THE KING OF SIAM, made in 1946, starring Irene Dunne (as Anna Leonowens) and Yul Brynner (as The King of Siam).

THE KING AND I brings important social issues, as relevant in 1862 (the year that the story is set) as they are today.  Though, dated in nature, this wonderfully engrossing tale examines racism, sexism and misogyny, as experienced through the eyes of British governess Anna Leonowens, who arrives in Siam (now Thailand) to teach the king's brood of children about history and valuable life lessons.  One of the most well-known songs from this film is ""Getting To Know You,"" a sweet, upbeat song, where Anna teaches the children to be more open-minded toward people outside of what is comfortable and familiar to them.  I think that best illustrates Leonowens' view of the world, and how it vastly contrasts from the views more commonly voiced in the castle of the king.  For starters, The King has many, many, many wives.  This includes a beautiful new wife, the young Tuptim (Rita Moreno), who is secretly in love with another man--a forbidden romance.  The king keeps wives like he would livestock, and Anna is appalled by this common custom.  She sets out to break down the kings' machisimo.  But, will she succeed?

Some of the most beautiful music I have ever heard from Rodgers and Hammerstein.  The songs include ""We Kiss In the Shadow,"" ""Shall We Dance"" (made famous by the wonderful dancing sequence, involving Deborah Kerr in a beautiful purple gown, shasaying with an enthusiastic king), and ""I Have Dreamed.""

The grand music intro fittingly depicts the grandness of the King. ""I whistle a Happy tune"", ""Getting to know you"", ""Shall we dance"" are catchy, easy-to-hum tunes, of course. Yet the second viewing of the movie allowed me to discover other great Rodgers and Hammerstein tunes as well.

Yul Brynner (who won an Oscar for Best Actor) portrayed the King perfectly. He was proud but not arrogant, eager to learn and be respected. Were he less sensitive to the atmosphere that changed around him, he might have a smaller burden to bear. When the King invited Deborah Kerr to dance for the first and only time in the Palace, the two waltzed and stumped fervently across the big ballroom and Deborah Kerr's lovely flowing dress floated in the air under the ""Shall we Dance"" tune - what a classic scene!

Excellent story plot aside, it was awesome to see Deborah Kerr (who won a golden globe for Best Actress) in a different dress in every scene. Designed by Irene Sharaff, each dress weighed between 30 and 40 pounds, due to all the pleats, hoops and petticoats. The design, fabric, colour and cutting were chosen down to the finest detail.

This is a great musical, probably Rogers and Hammersteins greatest! (I hear those heckles) So let the rest of us keep our memories of the great screen musicals intact, but for the kids and the sake of passing them along to the next generation, let's start with The King And I!!!!!!",1167868800,5,996,4.8011695906432745
358679,5,630176031X,"In the Golden Age of musical movies, Rodgers and Hammerstein took three looks at the clashes of Eastern and Western cultures: Joshua Logan's ""South Pacific,"" Henry Koster's ""Flower Drum Song"" and ""The King and I.""

'The King and I' derived from Margaret Landon's fascinating novel 'Anna and the King of Siam.' The film concerns a genteel British governess who, with a son of her own, journeys from England to 19th century Siam (now Thailand) to instruct the king's many children, in the ways of the West...

Upon her arrival in 1862, the uptight widow immediately clashes with the powerful ruler over his refusal to give her 'a brick residence' of her own outside the walls of the palace as had been promised...

As the film progresses, and in a world where women had basically no rights, the 'very difficult' governess learns to temper her outrage at the Siamese court and its treatment of women.. And while she was admiring the king's personality and brilliant mind, she quickly discovered that the major challenge facing her is much more in the education of the volatile king than of his cute family...

Despite his open-mindedness about other cultures, the proud bald king was besieged by both colonial powers and Siamese traditionalists... At least in private, he consults Anna on how to handle the threats against Siam from England, Burma, and France... He turns a deaf ear to her complaints about having to live in the royal palace, and fascinated by science and geography.. he gives 'a puzzlement,' the proper mixture of arrogance, wonder, and confusion...

In this historical account of conflicting cultures and sexual mores, we watch two people of very different backgrounds drawing apart and then together, culminating in that most moving and triumphant of moments, when they dance together for the first time... The image of Anna is swept 'high up' by the king as they whirl across the palace floor... His bare feet seductively touching lightly the edge of her satin gown...

When the king tells Anna that something is not correct with the way they are dancing, and extends his right hand to place it around her waist, it's the climax of a romantic love that never ignites...

This good-hearted story, enriched by some of Rodgers and Hammerstein's most enduring tunes, permits the meeting of two polar cultures explored with wit and humor... It permits us also to enter into the complex mind of a stubborn king, stern and imperious, whose words and whims become the law of Siam..). But the king is graceful, comic and virile... And into the feelings of an intelligent woman equally-stubborn, intrigued, and deeply irritated by a man, that quickly found she was also instructing him in the niceties of dancing and dining...

Brynner is irresistible and seductive, a towering figure as the king... He is blessed with a resonant baritone voice, both for speaking and singing... His stance, fierce, and magnetic eyes (denoting a royal leader who cannot be questioned or denied) have an optimum vision and an inquisitiveness that reflect an agile mind as well as a vulnerable heart... He is humorous without imagining it, particularly when receiving the bows of his adorable children...

Like Yul Brynner, Kerr radiates charisma, and the two work well together... From their first meeting to their last tearful parting, the give and take of their relationship provides the performance its emotional spark...

The supporting cast is also strong...

Rita Moreno is Tuptim's ill-fated lover who criticizes the system of slavery and concubinage and voices her desire to be free; Carlos Rivas carries his role comfortably as her Burmese beau, Lun Tha; Terry Saunders arouses Anna's sympathy for Tuptim by explaining that she and Lun Tha are deeply in love; Martin Benson plays Kralahome, the King's right hand man; Patrick Adiarte brings tears to our eyes and pride to our hearts in his far-seeing strength of character necessary to bring the film to a triumphant finish...

Graced with a rich and singularly beautiful score, and skillfully directed by Walter Lang, 'The King and I' was nominated for nine Academy Awards... It received five, including the Best Actor Award to Brynner... The sets and scenery are gorgeous, and Lang did everything to convey its grandeur... You'll certainly love the impressive procession (""March of the Royal Siamese Children"") when the king summons his sixty-seven children to meet their delicate schoolteacher...

Under Lang's direction, 'The King and I' proves to be the best of the Rodgers and Hammerstein adaptations, for reasons that involve East-meets-West flirtation, racism and authoritarianism, pageantry and spectacle, female determination coming up against vanity, civilization against barbarism, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera...",1167782400,,4777,5.140463917525773
358680,5,630176031X,"THE KING AND I has a remarkably convoluted history.  Anna Leonowens (1831-1915) was indeed a real person who did indeed teach in the royal court of Siam.  She did not allow fact to get in the way of a good story; while her memoirs were extremely popular, they were also fictionalized.  They became further so in 1944, when novelist Margaret Langdon retold the story in the novel ANNA AND THE KING; a play and film, the latter with Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison, soon followed and proved popular as well.  According to theatre lore, actress Gertrude Lawrence, one of the great talents of her era, encountered the material and recommended it to Richard Rogers and Oscar Hammerstein with the thought that she herself might play Anna in a musical version.

Opening on Broadway in 1951 with Lawrence in the lead, it proved a tremendous success.  Sadly, Lawrence did not live to recreate the role for the screen; she died of cancer during the New York run.  After much indecision and not a little argument, the role fell to Deborah Kerr--a memorable actress--but one whose singing voice was hardly up to the role.  In consequence the songs were voiced by the ubiquitious Marnie Nixon, a performer who specialized in this work throughout the 1950s and 1960s.

As a film, THE KING AND I belongs to a period during which Hollywood tended to approach musicals from a theatrical rather than a cinematic point of view: there is no pretense that we are any where but on a sound stage and the camera itself seldom moves, creating an effect that is very much like that a performance given on a proscenium stage.  It is a style which has not aged well--but THE KING AND I is the exception that proves the rule: with outrageously colorful sets, brilliant costuming, memorable music, and remarkable performances it remains as enchanting as it was when it first debuted in 1956.

It is also distinctly of its era in terms of casting.  Voice aside, Deborah Kerr was a natural choice for the role of Anna; she too was a cultured Englishwoman.  But although minor roles were generally played by people of Asian origin, none of the leads and few of the major supporting roles were.  Yul Brennar was of Russian origin; Rita Moreno was Puerto Rican (and, like Kerr, her singing voice would be dubbed); Martin Benson (Kralahome) was English; Carlos Rivera (Lun Thai) was Mexican-American; and so on.  Such would be quite unthinkable today, but there is no getting around the fact that all these performers give performances which are not only credible, but often extraordinary--with Brennar and Moreno cases in point.

Regardless of who, what, why, and how, the end result is enchanting from start to finish, the sort of musical that is stamped as ""a special event"" from start to finish.  Everything glitters; the music is among the best created by Rogers and Hammerstein; the larger-than-life performances are spot-on.  The story itself is both endearing and touching--and, as is often the case with Rogers and Hammerstein, makes an oblique statement against racial prejudice.  While it may not be good history (the story so annoys the Thailand government that it is banned from that nation in all its many incarnations), it is delightful entertainment... and, in my opinion at least, the best of the Rogers and Hammerstein musicals both on the stage and on the screen.

The 50th Anniversary edition offers excellent color and sound and, unlike the previous edition, a noteworthy bonus package as well.  As some have noted, it does not include the Overture and Intermission music of the earlier DVD--but while some will find this annoyance, the film as first released had neither; both were added during later re-release.  Strongly recommended.

358762,5,630176031X,"In 1999, Fox released all of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals on DVD - mostly in non-anamorphic widescreen DVDs that were very light on bonus materials. (The exception was The Sound of Music, which was released in single-disc fullscreen and anamorphic widescreen versions. In 2000, a 2-Disc ""Five Star Collection"" DVD of TSOM was released. This DVD is now out of print, as is the repackaged version with the same discs in a cardboard digipack, in favor of the newly restored 40th Anniversary Edition.) These DVDs were not restored, although THX remastered them for DVD.

In 2005, Fox started releasing all six movies in newly restored and remastered 2-Disc editions. Much controversy has surrounded these releases - particularly Oklahoma's Todd-AO transfer on the 50th Anniversary Edition, as well as the lack of restoration on the film elements being spliced back into the roadshow version included on the Collector's Edition of South Pacific. (The only one of these DVDs not labeled an anniversary edition.)

However, I just recieved and watched The King and I: 50th Anniversary Edition DVD today as a Christmas present, and suffice it to say, this DVD edition of The King and I is completely flawless.

The most important part of this DVD, naturally, is the film, and what a glorious way to view it! Presented in its original 2.55:1 aspect ratio and anamorphically enhanced, this is the best video version ever. This version has been restored from the original 1956 Cinemascope 55 film elements, for the sharpest, clearest, and most vibrantly colored transfer of this film to be seen since its original release. The film is not only presented with a digitally restored 5.1 Dolby Digital stereo track and the original restored 2-channel stereo soundtrack, but they also included a wonderful extra - the isolated music score, which finally allows you to hear the complete entire score of the film, including the instrumentals of the songs. (I believe, however, that We Kiss In A Shadow still has vocals on this track.) Also included is an audio commentary that I've not yet listened to.

Disc 2 houses the major bonus features of the set, and they seem to either hit or miss. The ""Something Wonderful: The Story Of The King and I"" featurette could have discussed the film a little more and been a little longer, but instead, is a short 25-minute featurette that focuses mainly on the Broadway production. However, the ""Restoring Cinemascope 55"" featurette gives good insight to the restorations of The King and I and Carousel, the only two films to my knowledge ever to be filmed in Cinemascope 55.

As with most of the new 2-Disc Rodgers and Hammerstein DVDs, we're given ""Vintage Stage Excerpts,"" performances of one or more songs from the shows on TV before there was even a film. This time, we get to see Broadway stars Patricia Morison and Yul Brynner singing Getting To Know You and A Puzzlement in grainy black-and-white kinescope, introduced by the one and only Mary Martin, perhaps best known for her portrayal of Nellie in the original cast of South Pacific, Maria in the original cast of The Sound of Music, and, of course, the title role in the original Broadway cast and multiple TV broadcasts of Peter Pan. This is a wonderful little bonus feature to include on the DVD, as it gives us a glimpse of what it may have been like to see The King and I on Broadway back then.

Also included is a photo stills recreation of one of the deleted songs, Shall I Tell You What I Think Of You. I don't know what purpose this serves, as it's been available on every soundtrack release. However, we get to see lovely photos of Deborah Kerr, so maybe it's not a total waste. Not to mention it's a wonderful song.

Possibly the most interesting bonus feature on this set is the TV pilot of the unsuccessful 1972 TV series, Anna and the King, with Yul Brynner once again as The King and Samantha Eggar as Anna ""Owens."" The pilot was more or less a non-musical time-compressed version of The King and I. The series sadly lasted only nine episodes before cancellation. I haven't completely watched it yet, so what I've said is simply based on the chapter skipping I did. Eggar also provides audio commentary for the pilot.

To sum everything up, this DVD does wonderful justice to The King and I. A beautiful transfer of the film with beautiful crisp restored sound, a big mixed bag of bonus materials, isolated musical score, an option to only watch the film's wonderful musical numbers, sing-along subtitles, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. A DVD I'd suggest to any fan of the film.",1166659200,5,4585,4.787610619469026

While it's far from perfect, and it's not even the best musical to grace the big screen, 'The King & I' packs a whallop of a punch and sports some great acting and beautiful sets that will do nothing short of take your breath away.  The plot is simple.  A widow and her son move to Siam to help teach the Kings children and while there they all take turns learning from one another.  The woman, Anna (Deborah Kerr) is a very independant mother who butts heads with the very independant King (Yul Brynner).  As she demands the house he promised her as well as continues to teach and fall in love with the children on Siam, Anna slowly begins to understand the way of life she at first refused to understand.  The film comes down to dramatic conclusion that tests their friendship and at the same time affirms their silent love for one another.  The film soars with it's beautiful story of two unlikly friends who slowly, and subtly fall in love, and soars even higher when you get a glimpse of the fantastic stage sets (which are even richer on the stage which I just had the privilage of seeing last night with Lou Diamond Phillips who was outstanding!).  The singing is decent, Kerr proving she has the best chops, but it's the story that steals the show.  Yes this is a musical, but strip that away and you still have an engrossing love story that is above average.  I'd recommend this to anyone, a great family film that everyone will enjoy.  The 'Uncle Toms Cabin' presentation done in Siamese style is the most impressive part of the film and the stage performance and is sure to make this movie a memerable experience.",1150070400,,1742,4.498412698412698

The strength lies in the two leads, Yul Brunner and Deborah Kerr, who elicit a screen relationship of love and respect unparalled, and, then, of course, it stays true to the story and all of the incomparable songs.  Just as Rex Harrison created the quintessential portrayal of Henry Higgins in ""My Fair Lady,"" Yul Brunner creates a King of Siam like no other -- I can't imagine any other actor in that role, and thank goodness it is preserved for us for all time.  This musical is so special, just based on the songs themselves, arguably it is R & H's best song effort (and that is saying a lot!).

358947,5,630176031X,"""The King and I"" is one of the greatest works of the American musical theater, a genre Rogers and Hammerstein changed by adding drama and complex characters along with their beautiful music and memorable lyrics. Based on Margaret Landon's classic ""Anna and the King of Siam,"" this filmed adaptation of the Broadway show is exquisite, with a fabulous cast and extraordinary talent behind the camera as well, with the direction of Walter Lang, choreography by Jerome Robbins, and cinematography by Leon Shamroy. The costumes by Irene Sharaff are also a visual feast of lavish, sparkling jewels and silks.

Yul Brynner is magnificent as the King Mongut; his charisma and screen presence is riveting, and he well deserved his Best Actor Oscar. This was his signature role, and he played in on the stage over 4,000 times during his lifetime. Deborah Kerr (who was nominated for Best Actress) is also superb as Anna, the English widow who teaches the king's children. My favorite moment in the film is when Brynner first puts his arm around Kerr's waist, in the ""Shall We Dance?"" number, and their chemistry together sizzles more than many of the explicit love scenes we see on the screen today. The entire cast is fabulous, with the children captivating, and Rita Moreno a standout as Tuptim, the girl given to the king, but in love with another man.

The ballet that is the entertainment for the banquet guests is fantastic, and danced to perfection. A version of ""Uncle Tom's Cabin,"" the choreography and the effects using fabric are a touch of genius. ""The King and I"" won 5 of its 9 Oscar nominations (Best Actor, Art Direction, Costume Design, Sound, and Scoring of a Musical), as well as some Golden Globes. Deborah Kerr's singing voice was dubbed by Marni Nixon (who also dubbed in ""West Side Story,"" ""My Fair Lady,"" and more), as was Rita Moreno, dubbed by Leona Gordon.

Also highly recommended is the dramatic 1946 film, ""Anna and the King of Siam"" with Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison. There was a rather disappointing remake in 1999, a mere shadow of the original, but is probably worth seeing as a comparison in how Landon's book (which is very high on my all time favorite list) has been adapted. It is not unusual for the filmed version of a Broadway production not to include all the original songs, and ""The King and I"" is no exception. What is included in the film however are some of the most loved melodies and lyrics written for the musical stage, and ones that we keep humming long after the show is over.

The movie artistically uses its scenes to show us this cultural stereotype. The scene in which King's children are being taught geography is a good example for this damaging stereotype of Thai culture at that time. Ethnocentrism, parochialism, and the lack of scientific knowledge of Siamese people are all shown with the map and the lecture of the Siamese lady (an unscientific map and the comparison between the King of Siam and the King of Burma): ""Siam is the biggest and richest country in the world"". However, it doesn't mean that Siamese people can't be scientific or they can't learn sciences. The hierarchy in Asian country doesn't give the people freedom, but on the other hand, it makes the country, politics, and culture follow the traditional value. In fact, the true historical King Rama IV who was really a man of Renaissance, he knew several Western languages and studied political science, hard sciences, western cultures, and colonialism. He wanted to bring Siam into the Modern world. In this situation, there appeared an advantage in Siamese culture. It is that the hierarchy in Siam played a very important role to keep the country's society and its political situation stable for Thailand to modernize.

359066,5,630176031X,"Rodgers and Hammerstein's THE KING AND I (1956) is a wonderous movie musical, an incredible adaption of the Broadway musical that premiered on stage in 1951 (and has been performed tens of thousands of times since). It tells a timeless story about tradition vs. modernity, Eastern vs. Western culture and men vs. women. This story was first written as the first-hand account of Anna Leonowens' experiences in Siam in the mid-19th Century, where she had been hired by King Mongkut to teach his many children, in his hopes to push Siam into the modern age. This account was first adapted for the big screen as ANNA AND THE KING OF SIAM (1946); unseen by me, it has been highly regarded in its own right, and starred Irene Dunne and Rex Harrison. THE KING AND I stars Deborah Kerr (last name pronounced ""Carr"") and Yul Brynner. Deborah Kerr completely embodies the strong-willed but emotionally fragile young widow Anna Leonowens; she makes Anna into a character with whom we identify and sympathize. We side with her in all disputes, from demanding that she be given her own house in which to stay as part of the original deal, to calling King Mongkut to task for enforcing double-standard sexual laws that were outdated and demeaning to women even at that time. As the equally strong-willed King Mongkut, Yul Brynner commands the screen in every scene he's in. You simply cannot look away. His King Mongkut is someone who wants to change Siam for the better, yet struggles to cling to many of the same traditions that he slowly begins to realize is partly responsible *for* holding Siam back. His heartbreak by film's end is emotionally gut-wrenching, and never fails to bring me to tears. The Russian-born, half-Mongolian Yul Brynner makes you believe he is a Siamese King; his performance is so brilliant that his transformation into this character appears to be almost effortless. And, of course, it won him a very well-deserved Oscar for Best Actor. Deborah Kerr gives a wide-ranged performance that spans all emotions throughout the course of this film. She was deservedly nominated for Best Actress, but unfortunately didn't win.
This film would have given us enough meat to chew on just in the complex relationship between our two principals alone. However, it is not content with just doing that for us. It gives us two spellbinding subplots, one of the forbidden love between Tuptim (a virtually unrecognizable Rita Moreno, in a truly marvelous performance) one of King Mongkut's many wives, and Lun Tha (Carlos Rivas), and the visit by the British Ambassador Sir John Hay (Alan Mowbray) whom King Mongkut wants to impress with how civilized he, and the Kingdom of Siam, is. Also, the ""play within the play""; namely, the hypnotic Siamese theater performance of Harriet Beecher Stowe's epic American tale of oppression and cruelty UNCLE TOM'S CABIN, is just so incredible that words fail me as how else to describe it. Anna's young son Louis (Rex Thompson) provides us with an effective sounding-board onto whom Anna reveals the kind of feelings about the situation that she cannot express to the King.
Unfortunately, this or any other Western film treatment of this truly fascinating story continues to be banned in Thailand today, namely they feel that King Mongkut, whom I understand was one of their most beloved monarchs, is portrayed as a barbarian. I have two beefs with that sentiment: 1) King Mongkut is most decidedly *not* portrayed as a barbarian in this treatment (or in the 1999 non-musical ANNA AND THE KING, which is quite a brilliant film in its own right)---rather, he is shown to be a deeply conflicted man who agonizes at the prospect of losing centuries-old Siamese traditions, even as he expresses himself as one who wants to help his country modernize; 2) If they want to get the story right in their eyes, then where is the *Thai* version of the story?
Controversies aside, this is just a splendid, gorgeous film. It has great period costumes, in both Eastern and Western traditions. It has a huge, ornate set used for the Palace. It has great music (""Getting To Know You"" and ""Shall We Dance"" are my two favorites). And it has incredible acting from all involved, especially Brynner, Kerr and Moreno (who should have been at least nominated for Best Supporting Actress for her sensitive and delicate protrayal of Tuptim). It is a joy to revisit every now & then. Parents, please do your children a favor and *keep them away* from the HORRENDOUS 1999 animated version, insultingly called THE KING AND I. That simpleminded, stereotype-laden, lamebrained version is a complete insult to anyone of decent intelligence. Just show your kids the 1956 original; it is the only version they will ever need to see!

The peformances by Brynner and Kerr are simply amazing, and the beautiful Rita Moreno does a spectacular job as playing the slave Tuptim. I'm sure you know the story, so I won't go on about that. I am most dissapointed with the cut of so many great songs, I understand the film was very long, but cutting many great songs makes the movie less enjoyable for me.
The songs cut for the film are Tuptim's beautiful ""My Lord And Master"", ""The Royal Bangkok Academy"", ""A Puzzlement REPRISE"", ""Shall I Tell You What I Think Of You?"", ""Western People Funny"", and Tuptim's and Lun Tha's ""I Have Dreamed"". In my opinion the two most drastic cuts are the beautiful ""My Lord And Master"", and ""I have Dreamed"", which are considered two of the most beautiful and powerful songs in the whole score. LUCKILY! Those two songs were recorded along with ""Shall I Tell you...""  So its great we get to hear Rita Moreno on Tuptim's other songs, even though Rita had slight augmenting done with her high notes by another woman, for most part it was Rita's voice, and her voice was beautiful indeed. Sadly, songs like Lady Thiang's and Wive's hilarious ""Western People Funny"" was not recorded, And I think the song is fantastic.

The original musical play was a showcase for Gertrude Lawrence, who played Anna, the ""I"" of the title. It was about her, from her point of view. The relatively obscure Yul Brynner's King was important, but not the main character. Well, by the time Brynner died after many revivals and tours decades later, just about everyone had forgotten about ""I"" being the main character--this show was about the King. A wonderful study of how one man's undeniable charisma forced itself upon the public.
I just LOVED this movie when I was a little girl, partly because of the songs, but mostly because of the gigantic hoop skirts Ms. Kerr sports. They just get bigger and bigger as the movie progresses, until the final iridescent ballgown. I saw this once on a big screen, and when they do that big polka in ""Shall We Dance"", the momentum of their dance made the skirt seem to billow out into the audience. Wow! Then someone bought the LP, and I played it over and over and learned not only all the songs but the instrumental parts too. Couldn't get enough of it, then or now.
Here is an unlikely love story of how a British governess arrives in 1860s Siam to teach the many children of the King. She and the King have many cultural differences, but ultimately come to respect and admire each other, just to brink of romance. But, that can never really be, for a multitude of reasons. Deborah Kerr is a great Anna, ever so proper but willing to unbutton it a little in her dealings with Brynner's outrageous King. He's more bark than bite, we find out by and by. Great songs, too: ""I Whistle a Happy Tune"", ""Hello, Young Lovers"", ""Getting to Know You"", ""I Have Dreamed"" (just makes me swoon to think of it!), and the great ""March of the Siamese Children"" when more children than you can count come to greet their new governess, who is as absolutely charmed as the audience by the song's end. Worth noting that Ms. Kerr's songs were dubbed by Marni Nixon, who did the honors again in ""My Fair Lady"" and ""West Side Story"". Yul was dubbed by no one.

As Anna introduces Western ideas to the Siamese children, the King finds it harder and harder to choose between being a fair-minded, enlightened leader and an absolute ruler.  The crux of contention emerges over Tuptim, a Burmese young woman given to the King as a ""present"" even though she loves another man.
""The Small House of Uncle Thomas"", a ballet adaptation of the novel Uncle Tom's Cabin, presented by the royal dancers, is fascinating to watch.  Most of the songs are superb, and the action and emotion rise sharply throughout the film.  I cannot address the concerns over stereotyping of Siamese characters (or English characters).

Far from it. This is based on a real story.  Read the book.  I saw the old black and white version with Irene Dunn and Rex Harrison and read the book and the boyfriend of the slave girl who was brought to the king was burned at the stake with her I believe.

In fact, the only reason that I can see for the king to die is good old-fashioned racism.  Romance and possibly even marraige is the logical outcome of the close relationship that develops between Anna and the king of Siam over the course of the film.  Killing the king, no matter how contrived, was the only way to avoid the distasteful (in some eyes) prospect of a romantic liaison between a white woman and a virile Asian male.

Nevertheless, the songs and performances are strong enough to recommend this film.",1005782400,3,1000,4.773255813953488

I purchased this because of another movie I had recently seen, ""Shall we dance?"" which has English subtitles in the Japanese film.
Both movies bring joy to one's life as we learn about the cultural differences, customs, dance, and music from other countries.... and as we share the same song and love of dance.
The King and I is a timeless masterpiece. The cast is perfectly placed and the viewer is magically transported to their kingdom of Siam where they believe their country is the greatest and largest (see the map they have of the world during one of the children's lessons) and then learn how they deal with the truth.....

359273,5,630176031X,"One of the grandest, most entertaining musicals ever committed to the silver screen, ""The King And I"" is one of Rodgers and Hammerstein's greatest achievements. From the film's excellent performances by two beloved screen icons, Yul Brynner and Deborah Kerr, to the splendid score, to the breathtakingly beautiful cinematography and set direction and elegant costuming... all come together to create an indelible movie masterpiece.
Loosely based on the real-life story of British schoolteacher Anna Leonowens, the film begins in the year 1860, when Leonowens (Kerr, at her most beautiful and most charming) comes to Siam with her young son to educate the many children of His Majesty the King of Siam (Yul Brynner, in an oustanding Academy-Award winning performance). Although Anna enjoys very friendly relationships with her charges, she has many conflicts with the stubborn King, at first refusing to live in the palace, in the King's ""harem"". He questions her culture and customs, but many of which he readily adopts, including the phrase: ""Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera,"" (which becomes an oft-repeated line in the film). Although wary of the proper Englishwoman, he is intrigued by her teaching methods and her sly sense of humor and her pronounced propriety. Anna soon finds herself developing a deeper relationship with her employer... and the unspoken feeling is mutual.
Another romantic drama is also unfolding behind the scenes: Tuptim, the King's favorite courtesan, has fallen in love with Lun Tha, a young slave. They wish to run away together, but to forever seal their love, they would have to defy the King... or be separated forever.
With underlined with unspoken emotions, vain pride, and biting humor, ""The King And I"" is glorious entertainment, not only for its fine performances and glamorous spectacle, but for its legendary music: Kerr and the children perform a delightful rendition of the classic ""Getting To Know You"", Kerr sings the praises of young love in ""Hello, Young Lovers"", Brynner shines with his pronounced staccato ""Confusion"", and the film's most memorable scene has Kerr and Brynner waltzing and singing to the film's masterpiece, ""Shall We Dance?"".
The film is also full of many golden scenes: the King's wives giggling at the sight of Kerr in a billowy petticoated gown (believing that is how she is shaped!), Kerr teaching the inquisitive Siamese youngsters about falling lace from the sky called snow, and one scene in particular, a royal banquet given for an English ambassador, with a performance by the King's dancers of an interpretive version of ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"", reworked as ""Small House of Uncle Thomas"", which is very entertaining. And the film's final, memorable scene will not be forgotten quickly.
Rodgers and Hammerstein work their incredible magic and Hollywood works its own magic in this beloved movie musical, which has delighted and entertained audiences for years, and lives on in this celebrated film classic.",986428800,18,2973,5.274261603375527

359275,4,630176031X,"A long-awaited arrival on DVD, THE KING AND I is one of the best examples of stage-to-screen adaptation, except for one glaring fault - the trimming of the score!  20th Century-Fox spent lots of effort and money to bring this Rodgers and Hammerstein hit to the very wide CinemaScope 55 screen, and the various artists who worked on the project certainly put a stunning vision of the show up on that wide screen.  Production and costume design are dazzling, the orchestrations are expansive in magnetic stereo (re-engineered for Dolby 5.1), the cast is simply perfect; overall a first rate presentation of the material.  But at the last minute, the studio scrapped their original idea to roadshow the picture in 55mm, and some filmed numbers were dropped to shorten the overall length.  This is always detrimental, not matter what the excuses for cutting, because it means that the show becomes less than complete.  But even if we could overlook the cutting of the second half of ""I Whistle a Happy Tune"", ""Western People Funny"", and maybe ""My Lord and Master"", the deletion of Anna's biting ""Shall I Tell You What I Think of You?"" is inexcusable, and the cutting of the score's most beautiful ballad, ""I Have Dreamed"", is a genuine crime.  One might have been hopeful that Fox would have restored, or at least included as outtakes, the missing numbers for DVD, but no such luck!  The same fate has also befallen their recent release of the 1967 DOCTOR DOLITTLE.
All of that said, this is a gorgeous transfer of a beautiful film, both visually and sonically.  The deluxe laserdisc set was very pretty, but the DVD image is much sharper and clearer.  Unfortunately, few of the extras on the laserdisc were transferred to DVD, thereby leaving non-laserdisc fans in the dark regarding production, deleted scenes, photos from the deleted footage, and the entertaining explanation of the whole confusion with regard to roadshow vs. non-roadshow, the overture on the soundtrack album, and the lack of such accoutrements on the first run prints (which were in 35mm, reduced from the 55mm negative).  Briefly, the decision to not send the film out 55mm hard-ticket was made far enough in advance so that overture, intermission, and exit music were not created for the 1956 release.  The 1956 soundtrack album has all the songs, but the overture on that recording was done especially for the album, and never was intended for the film.  People who swore they saw the film with these tracks were thinking of the 1962 re-release, blown up to 70mm Grandeur with 6-track stereo, that was presented on a reserved seat basis.  This special re-release had overture, entr'acte, and exit music stitched together from the underscoring of the film, but still no deleted numbers from 1956!  Nonetheless, this DVD actually holds the extra roadshow tracks, something that the laserdisc (being a faithful representation of the 1956 first run) did not carry, so that's another reason to see this version.  Now if Fox Video would just find those missing songs...",973209600,84,3035,4.946850393700787
359276,5,630176031X,"Of the four major screen adaptations of Rodgers and Hammerstein's Broadway  classics, I think this is the finest, and probably the truest to its roots,  yet adds Hollywood's special gloss. Luckily, Oscar-winner Yul Brynner was  allowed to re-create his role as the King and Deborah Kerr (although dubbed  by the versatile Marni Nixon) was a fine substitute for the late Gertrude  Lawrence as royal school-marm Anna Leonowens. In an unusual move, Jerome  Robbins was allowed to re-create his original stage choreography (most  notably in the ""Small House of Uncle Thomas"" ballet) and Jo  Mielziner's opulent stage sets were topped by John DeCuir's sumptuously  designed sound stages. Though well made, ""Oklahoma!"" didn't take  root on film quite as well (especially in the Agnes de Mille ballet  numbers, which looked so stage-bound on screen), and ""Carousel""  and especially the hugely popular ""Sound of Music,"" though  handsomely photographed on location, bogged down in sentiment. Sure,  ""The King and I"" is a tad schmaltzy too, but fiery Brynner and  feisty Kerr, ably directed by Walter Lang, bring tears that don't taste of  treacle. Alfred Newman's Fox orchestra and chorus were in peak form too.  It's too bad the songs cut from the film version couldn't have been  restored here (mostly likely they were recorded and not unfilmed). But this  remains one of the rock-solid screen adaptations of a beloved classic  Broadway show. Happily, the color on the full CinemaScope 55 image DVD disc  is excellent and the disc includes the Overture, Entr'acte and Exit Music  that would have been heard in the original '50s first-run engagements. The  sound isn't a crisp as the visuals, regrettably, but good considering the  nature of magnetic recording in the mid 1950s. The other DVD bonuses  include a grainy rendering of the 35mm theatrical trailer, quickie bios of  the principal creators, some Fox newsreel highlights of the premiere and  Oscar ceremonies (mostly blantant commercials for Fox performers and  products) and three audio-only replays of tunes from the show billed as a  ""Sing Along"" (Mitch Miller is nowhere in sight, thank goodness).",968198400,10,2153,5.213450292397661

359384,4,630176031X,"This is certainly one of the best musicals of all time. I know the motion picture is a little slow and drags at times, and may not be all that developed at some points, but I still rate it as one of my all-time fav.  movies. To start with, Yul Brynner was born to play the arrogant,  self-righteous King of Siam, and Deborah Kerr gives such a charming  performance as Anna Leonowens, the British School Teacher, that both actors  are perfect in every aspect and it's hard to imagine ANYONE else doing both  roles better than they did. But when it comes to Anna, part of the credit  goes to the ever-spectacular Marni Nixon who dubbed Kerr's singing voice.  She is my fav. singer by far, and I know for certain that no other singer  could have sung Anna's songs better than she did. That's a fact. Her  smoothe, gentle voice has probably NEVER sounded better. Just listen to her  'Hello, Young Lovers' 'Getting to Know You' and 'Shall We Dance'. You will  know what I mean. Plus, it's almost impossible to tell the difference  between Kerr and Nixon as they're voices are so alike.  Rita Moreno plays  Tuptim, the King's Burmese Concubine who runs away with her lover, Lun Tha,  the Emissary from the Court of Burma(Carlos Rivas). Moreno is undoubtedly  the ultimate Tuptim, since she captures the character's characteristics  very well. Terry Saunders made a pretty effective Lady Thiang, the  head-wife, Rex Thompson made an amusing Louis Leonowens, and Martin Benson  was splendid as the King's Prime Minister, the Kralahome, who is equally  arrogant and self-righetous as the King himself. The only problem I have  with the casting is Rueben Fuentes who dubbed Carlos Riva's singing voice.  He is awful and sounds old.  The direction by Robert Wise and the  screenplay by Eernest Lehman are also superb. I think the way the musical  was adapted into a motion picture was perfect. I know they had to cut off  many wonderful songs such as MY LORD AND MASTER(Tuptim's solo), SHALL I  TELL YOU WHAT I THINK OF YOU(Anna's soliquoly), THE ROYAL BANGKOK  ACADEMY(School Song), I HAVE DREAMED(Tuptim and Lun Tha's second song) and  WESTERN PEOPLE FUNNY(The Royal Wives' song), but the musical is adapted in  such a way that one can hardly ever miss the songs, despite how grand they  were. THE SMALL HOUSE OF UNCLE THOMAS - BALLET is also another highlight,  and in any case, the whole story concerning a British Widow and an Asian  Monarch falling in love is unique. I know that the ending is very sad and  very emotional, but the truth is, it could NOT have been better, and I for  one think it's one of the best 'endings' of all-time. In any case, the  songs in THE KING AND I were considered the best songs Rodgers and  Hammertsein ever wrote, and the musical is probably the most cherished of  all-time. You've simply GOT to see this. It will stay in your head for a  long, long time, and make you think alot too. It's well worth four stars,  and even five stars wouldn't be too much depending on one's opinion. I  think this is much, much better than THE SOUND OF MUSIC...",953942400,14,3073,4.616666666666666

Yul Brynner (I always worry that I  will misspell that) is perfect as the arrogant King of Siam, with his  myriad wives and his countless children. The costumes are beautiful, the  setting is beautiful. So why don't I like this film a lot? I find it slow,  somewhat wordy, and overlong - a film to savour in the memory rather than  watch over and over again.
The best scenes are worth 5 stars and more.  The rest is worth only 3 stars - and one particular sequence is so  wonderful that it merits 10 stars all to itself. That is the Thai dance  sequence of Uncle Tom's Cabin - or Small House of Uncle Thomas. A true work  of art, a cinematic original, a spectacle to die for.
