8544532,3,B009VK4ROA,"Final Fantasy - Orchestral Album is a Blu-ray album released as part of the Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary campaign. Yes you heard me, Final Fantasy music you can play on your Blu-ray player. What this should mean is huge song list, with game footage or other video for each song being played. What you get is the equivalent of putting a cd in your DVD player, music with a standard background that tells you from what game the music is being played. Granted the sound is much better here than any CD could ever dream of, but the lack of video footage is a severe letdown. This is a HUGE missed opportunity. To say I was disappointed would be a massive understatement, but that doesn't take away from the beauty of this collection, as it represents some of Final Fantasy's greatest songs.

So my disappointment aside, let me tell you what you get. The album has 47 songs, 23 of which are orchestrated and 24 are lifted straight from their respective video games. Most of the Orchestral Versions you have heard before, although a hand full of them are new. Eyes on Me and Opera ""Maria and Draco"" are the two that stand out as new takes on songs that have been done previously. Bonus features include picture albums, documentaries and advertisements for other Square Enix products, all in Japanese of course. The best track on the entire album is number 23, a nearly 15 minute new Battle Medley using battles themes from Final Fantasy I-XIV.

On the plus side, this Blu-ray does contain mp3 files that can be saved from the disc to your computer of songs 1-23.
