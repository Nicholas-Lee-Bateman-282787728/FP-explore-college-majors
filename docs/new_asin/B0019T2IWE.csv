The different scenarios offered various issues that everyday people deal with all around the world. And, for this, I am truly grateful to have watched this film. What remained lacking is an edited version of resolution in each character's life. For instance, did the petite talented woman HAVE to live with mommy in order to resolve her inner frustration? Or, could she have found her own voice in this given scenario so that she would not have to regress into mommy's little girl? As I watched this film, especially as a Mexicana, I wanted to see this specific character bloom into a much more self-discovered and evolved woman. My favorite character was the man who accidentally killed a teen girl as a hit-'n'-run and who nearly kills the main character by almost running her over as well. Often times, a tragedy will occur without any true intent from any of the persons involved. The fact that the traumad young man and the older driver, who killed the young man's girlfriend years ago, can actually sit down and share their stories behind the tragedy was priceless. This sort of resolution was magical. It certainly was the highlight of the movie. Instead of continued violence and vengeance, two men were able to sit down and find peace through their sharing of both painful experiences. Alas! An alternative solution to pain and violence has been offered on film! Bravo! This scene stole the show! Had the writer found this same depth in each main character, I am certain that it could have opened many more possibilities for its viewers as they walked away reflecting upon the alternative ways to handle a struggle. For this very reason, I am grateful to have seen this film for my own reflection; yet, I will not add it to my collection of films to view more than once.",1298678400,,1871,4.724770642201835
