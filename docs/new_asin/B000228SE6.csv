2055861,5,B000228SE6,"I have 4 kids ages 10 to 2 and they all love watching these movies.  My oldest made the comment that usually movies like this are boring but this one isn't as ""cheesy"" as some others she has seen.  I bought the whole collection and they haven't gotten tired of watching them yet!",1127520000,5,279,4.245283018867925
2055862,5,B000228SE6,"My son is almost six and has almost outgrown Dave and Becky and Hard Hat Harry (but, he still watches that stuff too with his baby brother) but, he loves this DVD.  It's got more detailed information than the other collections mentioned.",1124150400,3,237,4.642857142857143
2055863,5,B000228SE6,"All four episodes of this video - Boats, Submarines, Space Shuttles, and Cars - have really cool facts for children.  From the inner workings of a spacesuit to how to make biodiesel, this video has the detailed information that my 5 year old craves!  And the preteen presenters are not even particularly annoying for parents!  I would recommend this to anyone looking for some real facts about real machines for their children.",1123027200,2,427,4.902777777777778
2055864,5,B000228SE6,"This is one of those rare DVDs that is entertaining and captivating to a 2 1/2 year old, but educational enough to provide new information to much older kids.  There are four episodes on this DVD: Submarines, Cool Cars, Boats, and Rockets.  It is narrated by two preteens, but isn't annoying.  They go deeper into concepts than most kids videos (talk about air and hydrodynamic pressure, explains how water locks work on canals, etc.).  Even I can enjoy watching the shows.

If your child has moved slightly beyond the ""Real Wheels"" series, this is just great.",1095379200,12,560,4.791666666666667

8020354,4,B000228SE6,"I found this product to be along the lines of what I was looking for. The film captured my kids attention and held it very well. I was surprised to find that the film contained other machines besides rockets like heavy machinery and submarines. So if the child you are buying this for is somewhat interested in rockets, I recommend it. My only caution is that it may seem a bit 'cheesy' and dated.",1315180800,,397,4.378378378378378
8020355,5,B000228SE6,"I bought this product because I wanted to introduce my son who is almost 2 years old to some neat, scientific concepts.  The topics of this DVD include submarines, race cars, monster trucks, space travel, etc.  Each segment is about half an hour long and the explanations are well done.  They have a boy and girl narrate them, and they are not annoying, and there is an adult who makes an appearance to show some neat experiments you can do at home to mimic the concepts they talked about during the segment.  My son is too young to understand some of the concepts, but he loves the video and seems fascinated by it, as am I.  I know he's going to find this DVD interesting for years to come.  I figure you can't start too soon introducing the sciences and making learning fun.  I'm glad I bought the DVD.",1298764800,,805,4.3624161073825505
8020356,5,B000228SE6,All these dvds are the greatest! Love PM for K. They're educational and fun for kids to watch. Highly rec'd!!!,1262995200,,110,4.55

My son (5 yrs) is fascinated with learning and this dvd hit the spot. He was instantly absorbed and asked me to buy the others. So I did.
Each dvd has 4 episodes. Radical Rockets also has submarines, cool cars and boats. They are lively energetic and fun. They make science understandable. The kids who host the programs are genuine and likable. We get to see the real deal with the hosts. There are cartoon segments to explain the science. Finally there is Charlie who is sometimes silly but always interesting when he does actual experiments. After watching my boy gathers stuff to do his own experiments. What an impact. My husband and I enjoy them and learn a few things as well.  I guess this was a tv series at one time but I never watched it. I'm glad they put this treasure on dvd.",1259280000,,1059,5.571428571428571
8020358,5,B000228SE6,"I bought this for my 5 year old son, but my 3 year old daughter also enjoys it (though a bit long for her age). My son is really into rockets and space, but knows nothing of commercialized stories such as Star Wars and the like. So he's very intrigued by the actual inner workings of rockets and boosters and things that goes into space. Lots of great real life video, which is always a hit with his mom. The kids are a bit older than him, but he still enjoys it.",1203897600,3,463,4.043478260869565
8020359,5,B000228SE6,"I first bought one Popular Mechanics dvd to explain electricity to our 3 year old grandson.  After seeing it I purchased one for our 5 year old grandson.  Since then I have purchased two sets of the six Popular Mechanics dvd's and they have entertained both boys for hours.  These stories are told by children, for children, and are very educational and interesting.  I would purchase more in a second.",1202515200,3,402,4.7
8020360,5,B000228SE6,"My son loves each of the four programs on this DVD, though he probably prefers the one on rockets.  As a parent, I appreciate the fact that the programs are intelligently done and the young actors seem genuinely interested in the science they're talking about.

This is an outstanding addition to my family's DVD library.",1140912000,2,321,4.818181818181818
8020361,5,B000228SE6,This is the first Popular Mechanics for Kids video we own and it has been a hit!  My 5 year old son has learned a lot about how machines work and is even interested in conducting some of his own experiments like they do in the video.  The pre-teen narrators are great and so is the content.  It is engaging for both kids and adults.,1135900800,2,332,4.076923076923077
