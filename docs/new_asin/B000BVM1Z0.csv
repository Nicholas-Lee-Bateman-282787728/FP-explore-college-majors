It's not one you'll want to watch over and over,  but it's worth a look. You could make a drinking game around how Burt Reynolds' beard grows or vanishes from one second to the next.",1445126400,,340,4.483870967741935
8093086,4,B000BVM1Z0,"I liked this movie,  contrary  to  prevailing opinion.  It  was  like  a  film  noir,  better  written  than  many  of  Burt`s  macho  cop  films.",1425772800,,146,4.608695652173913

8093088,1,B000BVM1Z0,"First of all, this movie came out less than a year after Jaws, (a superior classic), which was released in 1975. Poor Burt reynolds should stick to his hilarious Smokey & Cannonball & Longest Yard movies. This was the stankest movie I ever ever saw, next to The Creeping Terror. Damn, I even paid to see it at the theater. The picture is grainy, the plot has no plot and the shark scenes are obviously poor archive shots and extremely hard to see as well as almost non-existent throughout the movie.

If you are drunk & bored, then watch this movie, with a little warning - You will probably laugh throughout the first half, (all of 40 minutes), then pass out thinking you had a very bad dream. Save your money unless you really have money to blow. Heh heh! -Dale",1282867200,,763,4.411347517730497
8093089,2,B000BVM1Z0,"Cult filmmaker and legendary maverick Samuel Fuller hated this movie so much he demanded his name be taken off it. Unfortunately for him, it wasn't and he shares a co-writing credit in addition to his directing credit. His biggest problem - besides the fact that a stuntman was killed by an actual shark during filming - was the way the producers took the film away from him and edited it themselves. That move rendered the film incoherent which is a shame since all the makings of a solid B movie are there: Burt Reynolds, killer sharks, the search for sunken gold, various drunks, crooked cops, mad scientists and, of course, a beautiful woman (Silvia Pinal).

American gun-runner Caine (Reynolds) is in a tight spot. His last shipment was seized by border guards, and his truck was blown up in the ensuing chase. Stranded in a Middle East seaport, he's desperate to get the heck out of town especially since a shady local cop is showing lots of interest in his sudden arrival. Or maybe the cop is just on edge since the night before a local diver was killed by sharks during a mysterious late-night dive. The diver had been hired by a scientist (Barry Sullivan) and his comely assistant (Pinal) under the guise that they were conducting medical research and needed samples from the ocean floor. In actuality they were using the boy as bait while the scientist tried to retrieve sunken gold. Now that their fall guy is dead, the duo need to find somebody to replace him and quick before people start asking questions. It's only a matter of time before Caine meets up with them and a deal is struck with no questions asked. He'll help them if they help him. But can any of these criminals really trust each other? Suffice to say that lots of betrayals and double-crosses ensue in addition to several poorly filmed underwater sequences featuring the aforementioned killer shark.

The film is mildly entertaining and kinda fun, but it's soo over-the-top. The Fuller dialogue is typically colorful and the action sequences - the ones you can actually see - are fast and energetic. (Note how many times Caine takes flying leaps into tables throughout the film. It's a tad excessive.) But it's the editing that kills it. This film is so damn choppy it's ridiculous. There's no continuity at all and scenes feel rushed and haphazardly glued together. This is a shame since there's obviously a decent film here and if Fuller would have been given the chance to make it his own it could have been a fun addition to his filmography rather than just a mild curiousity for Fuller completists.",1242086400,2,2582,4.722838137472284
