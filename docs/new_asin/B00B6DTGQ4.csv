8563280,1,B00B6DTGQ4,"This title contains some nudity is for audiences 17+.  There is not explicit nudity or adult situations but there is significant fan service.

I did a Google search for Romantic Harem Comedy and this title came up.  The reviewers said it was decent so I bought it.  I was hoping for something a little more mature, like Heaven's Lost Property, than say the typical Tenchi Muyo series.  The precept of this title seemed interesting.  The male lead is the secret ""writer/author"" of a soap opera where pretty girl ""super heroes"" do battle.  I hoped the story line would be a great blend of fantasy soap opera elements mixed with typical high-school/college life.

The animation is dated, I'd say mid 90's.  While not horrible, it does not compare to modern titles.  I was also hoping for a greater variety of settings, costumes, and animation styles.  The overall range of animation was average.  There is no English dub, but I liked the Japanese voice acting well enough.  You might think this is a 3 Star rating.

Here is where the real problem is.  The girls of the super hero group are ages 17, 17, 14, 11, and 11.  And they are naked in half of the episodes.  While I enjoy fan-service, I DO NOT enjoy under age girls who look like little kids, running around naked.  Even the ""of age"" girls still looked too young.  This should not be sold on Amazon.",1403827200,5,1353,4.5625

8563284,2,B00B6DTGQ4,"I Will Start off indicating:
The basic concept of this series.
 This series is among many show's which in genre this falls under perverts dream tv shows in japanese it's  called ecchi!
They fill in the gaps; of people with no skills in relationships'
And Please The Viewer With The Ecchi Series  Which Don't fall under shows with a great amount time to understand them . As it ain't a interesting  series.
As I seen show's called love hina and
Oh My Buddha an some other show's which involved extreme ecchi or incest. I know they are made as interesting series to perverts
If you're accepting of the fact;
 Also you're not good with relationship subject's.
Well Great For YOU
This show is open to only those who found it hard to understand, When it came to gaining a girlfriend and involving in relationship subject's . As Pretty much!
If you have a great amount of interest in
The idea of Virtual Girlfriends you will find this interesting. I personally only watched this to kill time as I understand this show's point of existing and it ain't pretty description; for what reason why they watch it.
I still say this is not at all for foreign audience which live not in japan or India it's only truly
suitable for the Japanese and Hindu's Who Like young girls for brides as it uses ideas of pedophilia . subjectively
arousing material for extreme perverts",1367712000,2,1355,4.582644628099174
8563285,3,B00B6DTGQ4,"Love Love? is a anime series that ran from May 3, 2004 to June 28, 2004
The anime is directed by Takeo Takahashi and the leading character in this anime is one Naoto Ohizumi(voiced by Mamoru Miyano most notably recognized as Light from the series Death Note), and I never thought I would be seeing this licensed for an actual dvd release outside of Japan.

Our story follows one Naoto Ohizumi and his effort to pursue a career in the film industry. He has been given a role as screenwriter to document the principal cast of heroines who are working on a project that is never really explained. It exists more as a vehicle to put him in as many awkward situations as possible, mostly involving fan service to such a degree that it's almost charming in its enjoyment of hitting all the tropes that this standard of anime hopes to accomplish. There is something to be said for not only recognizing genre stereotypes but charging head long into them with reckless regard for any outside criticism.

We could fill a van with these ladies who are vying for our protagonists attention. No supporting male characters are ever present, further solidifying this animes goal of trudging forward through all of its episodes repeating gags of our main character winding up in situations that make him out to be a pervert. Most of these are presented through a factor of misunderstandings and poor timing that leave Naoto in situations he would rather not be in. That may be a redeeming factor to make much of this material a bit more palatable as its easier to accept if he is not stalking these women. I assume that was done by design and it was a good move.

Of course life is by no means easy for Naoto, his eyes of affection rest completely on one Natsumi Yagami(voiced by Miyu Matsuki recognized from the most recent Da Capo Anime series). All of the other women serve as more of a distraction. All of these characters are hoping to be featured more prominently throughout the course of this movie that is being shot, putting Naoto in the unfortunate position of trying to find out if Natsumi's affection is just for personal gain on the set or if it could be something more. Some people may find this set up intriguing, they may even enjoy it.

Love, Love? was frequently marred by these concerns during its original run while it was being fan subbed. I can say with absolute certainty that the amazon provided box art and additional screen shots do a apt job of letting you know what this title has to offer. Short of providing actual hardcore adult content, I use the term adult content because any other terminology may imply that sexual intercourse actually occurs in the series, which it does not. I still only recommend this for those who know full well what they are purchasing and even then my recommendation carries some disclaimers

I titled review a train wreck because that's what it is. It's the kind of experience that once it has you in its claws you just can't look away. You will watch in amazement at how blatant this anime carries itself. It doesn't aim for any character development, plot, quality animation, worthwhile music or anything of value. I highly doubt you will walk away feeling as though the story has stuck with you. So take it for what it is, a anime you will likely recall for how audacious it behaves but would never have a serious conversation about any particular merits or high points that it achieved.",1366070400,15,3434,4.613747954173486
