8615450,5,B00FG0LTFY,Another Great Classic. Judge Roy Bean was truly a character in His own ways. I don't think no one really knows for sure the real life story of this man. People over the years tend to add a little each time the story is told. This is still a great buy. I never get tired of watching this.,1503187200,,287,3.9655172413793105
8615451,5,B00FG0LTFY,So pleased to have purchased this video collection. Edgar Buchanan does such an excellent job in his role and the stories are enjoyable to watch today. To go back in time and revisit these shows is worth the cost of the purchase!,1425168000,,229,4.476190476190476
8615452,4,B00FG0LTFY,"I can't get enough of Edgar Buchanan. He was, like Walter Brennan, one of those actors who made a memorable and vivid impression in relatively brief appearances. The scripts and sets in this series weren't exceptional, and the visual  and sound clarity are lousy, but it's all worth it for Buchanan.",1409097600,,299,4.862745098039215
