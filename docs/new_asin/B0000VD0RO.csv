1950033,5,B0000VD0RO,"This documentary is thought provoking and compelling.
First of all, everything is up to date and there is excellent footage of UFO's and modern computer simulations where video of sightings are not available. Forget the blurry blobs of the past. Feast you eyes on relatively sharp images and clear shapes in colour.
Secondly, it makes use of old footage of statements made by Government officials during the late forties and fifties to great effect. Each statement on it's own seems insignificant but when many such statements are seen together it soon becomes clear that something ""funny"" is going on. By the end you'll realise that the government position is a joke. How stupid do they think we are?
Thirdly, this documentary is suitable for skeptics and those who know little about the subject. You will be informed about the origins of the ""flying saucer"" phenomenon and where it's at now. A case will be presented in which the evidence cannot be denied. Only a fool would persist in saying there is nothing to it. People who believe in the existance of extra-terrestrial life will get a lot out of it as well. You may feel like shouting ""See - I told you so!"".
Another interesting point is that this documentary covers the religious aspect and interviews two theologians to great effect. What they have to say is fascinating.
This is easily the best UFO documentary I have seen and I commend its creators. They have presented the evidence in a professional and exhaustive manner. The DVD contains a 1 hour bonus entitled ""UFO's Fifty Years of Denial"" which is also excellent. I cannot recommend this DVD highly enough!",1080172800,209,1623,4.841726618705036
1950034,4,B0000VD0RO,"I purchased this DVD after seeing the version aired on SciFi channel and it was well worth the money.
This is an excellent documentary, using camera footage and testimonials to effectively prove its point, that Unidentified Flying Objects of unknown technologies do exist and there is an active campaign to hide their existence. This is not a crackpot movie trying to make a case for little green men. It presents evidence and allows the viewer to draw their own conclusions, never once does it make conjectures based on the evidence presented. It maintains professionalism and credibility throughout.
Before this film I had only seen UFO footage that looks shoddy at best. Some of the footage in this movie is very compelling, and they even go as far to have one movie analyzed by ILM (Industrial Light and Magic). After seeing the footage you can't really deny the existence of UFO's, whether you believe these are alien craft, well that's another question that, thankfully, this movie doesn't try to answer.",1073865600,21,1010,4.982248520710059

1950067,4,B0000VD0RO,"I am not cecilia I am her son todd. This was a good film. Main stream scientist do not believe in UFOs mainly because of the distances
these crafts would have had to travel to get here. The flip side of that coin is these Aliens may be millions of years more evolved then humans and
have learned or discovered how to travel through the universe. What we really need is ""The Smoking Gun"", An event so huge that it could not be covered up or explained away by anyone. I hope that day comes before I die.",1497398400,,501,4.122448979591836

1950072,5,B0000VD0RO,"This documentary is so good that I showed it to my college seminar on The Paranormal. Possibly it's the least biased, most even-handed, well-researched, and useful documentary ever made. At the least, it's the best I've seen, and I've watched more than fifty of them. It's not going to convince someone like Michael Schirmer, who left his mind in a dungeon long ago. Nor a Seth Shostak, who only pretends to be open-minded.

It is a fact that most of the wars and bad in the world is from people with different religious beliefs, maybe if we all knew there were other life forms far advanced then us from all over space and time, people would have to rethink what really matters in life.

1950098,5,B0000VD0RO,"I and every UFO researcher I have asked all agree - this is the best UFO documentary ever produced and features award-winning filmmaker James Fox. He really is the best filmmaker that Ufology has ever produced, Everyone should not only see this film, this is also the perfect film to share with friends and first timers. The only exception is James Fox's next film ""I know What I Saw"" which is a fantastic follow up to what is already a seminal piece of filmmaking. Don't miss this film either. Together both the films of James Fox represent the best that the disclosure movement has to offer.",1487980800,2,593,4.60377358490566
1950099,5,B0000VD0RO,"One of the better movies of this type. It makes a great case by presenting people who have a true feel of authority, not just the usual pseudo talking heads and leaps of logic. It's pretty easy to take it seriously when the people giving their stories are astronauts, military people, real scientists, even foreign credible witnesses. The stories they cover are discussed in detail and the ridiculous cover-up answers by the US government and military are such insults to anyone with intelligence that you find yourself getting mad all over again every single case. Peter Coyote does his usual great job of narration. Highly recommended.",1487548800,,637,5.018867924528302

1950126,4,B0000VD0RO,"Very interesting documentary. The main difference with this one is the high degree of credibility of those who are interviewed about their experiences with UFOs. I'm still not 100% convinced that we have visitors from other galaxies. These craft sightings could be the result of top secret initiatives from our government or others to test experimental spacecraft. However, it does seem that if that's the case, some of this amazing technology would be made public. I'm less skeptical about UFOs after seeing this film...and much more curious.",1485302400,,543,5.252873563218391

1950226,4,B0000VD0RO,"I was extremely impressed with this documentary and the way it told what it set out to tell. It was both focused and thorough. I appreciated the choice of people interviewed. There was a nice balance of impressive amateur footage and spoken accounts. I liked how the footage was shown with identifying captions without the narrative talking about it at the same time. The only thing that bothered me is I felt there was a glaringly narrow assumption throughout that the UFO sightings with the most credible evidence WERE technology from other planets. We don't know that and none of the sightings listed involved seeing aliens. I feel you can just leave it at ""unidentified' and that is intriguing enough. It doesn't necessarily mean aliens from other planets. It means solid and seemingly solid airborne objects were seen and documented performing maneuvers far beyond what our aircraft are capable of. That's mysterious enough for me. And while the idea that people in government and armed forces could have been told to act as though what they saw and investigated never happened, I really don't see this as- based on what was presented here- indicative of some conspiracy to cover up. Many of these hush-up orders took place during periods in which the US was under threat, perceived or real, from rival nations. Heightened control and secrecy. Sure I'd rather not hear that a government agency can make things ""disappear"" without some sort of oversight checking these actions. And no matter when it occurred, government officials incapable of simply saying ""We don't have enough facts to confirm anything other than our inability to identify and explain what happened."" instead of saying Governor Carter saw the planet Venus or that trained military personnel mistook a distant lighthouse for a solid object moving mere feet in front of them- well, that just seems silly.

ET's are actually demons from the spiritual dimension and are working with very evil elements of our planet to help ET's to incarnate with souls and also to set up a planet-wide government for the control of the world-order Elite as their minions. It's all deception; they live in the dark, and hide themselves in the shadow government's deceit. When you see a UFO you are witnessing the ongoing war between good and evil, light and darkness, freedom and slavery.

They do have some overlapping, similar information, but there was enough differences to make them equally worth watching. What a fascinating subject, and so engrossing. Mr. Fox and company does an excellent job of drawing us in, and wowing us with this heavy-hitting, factual-based information. Astronauts, government employees, military personnel--these aren't people you can easily dismiss as whacko's! We are believers, and this documentary just underscored those belief's. It's kind of scary to have a person's belief's substantiated by such illustrious witnesses--if astronaut Gordon Cooper tells us that he believes there are UFO visitor's not from this world, we tend to believe him :-)

1950372,5,B0000VD0RO,"I found this exploration of the UFO phenomenon very interesting.  I am a ""sympathetic skeptic"", one who is happy that there are people looking into such things.  Most cases are easily explained; but there is always a small percentage that just won't go away.  They may be explainable, if only we have more information.  There are many things in the sky and it is certainly a good idea to understand them better, even natural phenomena -- there is a lot we don't know about certain things, like ball lightning, or the newly discovered sprites.  The list goes on.  I have no doubt that there are some coverups -- I think many sightings are of craft that are experimental airplanes being tested by us.  And, who knows?  Maybe there are some alien craft dropping by for a quick visit; I can't prove it otherwise and there may very well be some way they can manage such a thing.

Whatever they turn out to be:  natural phenomenon, honest folks seeing something like Venus and not understanding it, real physical things flying around, ours or NOT ours, I think there is a lot we can learn by investigating them.  All of them.  I am a skeptic, but part of me would like it very much if some of them turned out to be alien visitors.

1950523,5,B0000VD0RO,"I have followed the UFO subject since the mid Seventies, and as you look back over the decades there are times in that story line where there were clear milestones, seminal events - that either changed or created awareness about UFO's. I think that years from now folks will look back and see this video as an important event in the history of UFOlogy. I say that for a couple of reasons, first, interest in UFO's was at a fairly low ebb at the time. After the buzz created by some of the abductee stuff of the early 90's and the Phoenix Lights in the late 90's there really wasn't much - in the public domain/consciousness, as it were. This video helped spike public interest again and spawned a lot of spin off programming for the next several years based on its success. Secondly, it pulled together in one place several of the best and most interesting cases, so that when viewed one was hit with a wall - a body of evidence that was extremely compelling. Most UFO programs in the past were rather disjointed, incomplete or spent a vast amount of time speculating or providing air time to the standard debunkers for ""balance"". This video focused on presenting its ""case"" in court. And it worked. Divide and conquer is one of the most successful strategies - and it has always been used to squash the case for the reality of UFO's. It is easy to dismiss a case here or a case there. And for the public in general - that may not have an interest or are predisposed not to believe - any individual case is easy to ignore or shoot down, but when they are presented as a whole and with the most credible witnesses then it becomes much harder to reject. James Fox did that with this video. The other thing that is important about this video - is that it is not a ""professional"" production. That is not a slam against James Fox. That is just the truth. There is no ""money"" behind this production. I know, I work in the business, and I know what I am looking at. And what I see is one very passionate and dedicated young man with a cheap video camera driven to tell this story - and as a result this individual has made the single most compelling argument for the reality of UFO's. He has earned a place among the giants of the field. His contribution is that important and shows the power and impact that one man can have - if focused, passionate and driven. Be sure to see his follow up to this program - ""I Know What I Saw"".",1357344000,3,2423,4.315789473684211
1950524,4,B0000VD0RO,"I've been interested in UFOs for longer than I care to admit and I've read more than my fair share on the subject. As in any other field not sanctioned by official academia there has been a lot of garbage that simply hasn't withstood the test of time. But those who have cared and stuck with it have brought the research to a high level of respectability.

Here's the scoop. This deals with several aspects of the UFO field. Sightings by military and government people. Photographic and video evidence. Efforts by various military and government people to release official documentation. Ongoing efforts by civilian groups to get official information released and official cover-ups.

The outline of this documentary is a bit of a mess. It's all over the place in what it deals with and bounces back and forth between UFO incidents and the other above mentioned areas of discussion. The one consistent point is that it gives the best evidence that offers some of the highest yield of information. The Rendlesham Forest Incident is covered in fair detail as are the Phoenix Lights. These incidents, along with the eyewitness testimony, should alone erase any doubt of the reality and importance of the phenomenon. Having George Lucas' ILM studio verify the authenticity of some UFO footage was also a deft touch. There is much good stuff like this throughout. Then there is the obligatory dealings with cover-ups. The Condon Committee/Report was dealt with at some length as was the early Allen Hynek ""swamp gas"" incident. Something that was a surprise to me here was that some of the upper ups were not necessarily convinced government was at the center of the cover-up. If the President of he United States can't get the information, that is telling in itself. They hinted it might be powerful outside interests, as in ""the military industrial complex.""

As much as I know on the subject, there were still things here, such as France's COMETA report,  that were new to me and that's always a plus. For someone new to the subject, this is even better. This should give a newbie a concise snapshot of the phenomenon and what it entails at various levels.",1353715200,22,2153,4.842391304347826
1950525,5,B0000VD0RO,"""Out of the Blue"" is a fascinating documentary about the UFO phenomenon. The team behind the movie support the ETI hypothesis, the notion that UFOs really are space craft from other parts of the universe, manned by intelligent aliens. The documentary features interviews with military personnel, pilots and astronauts who claim to have seen UFOs. The Rendlesham Forest affair is prominently featured. Much of the information in ""Out of the Blue"" comes from previously classified government documents. One UFO case involved a luminous object which disabled 20 nuclear warheads! The Condon Committee report is effectively debunked, and many official ""explanations"" turn out to be quite absurd: swamp gas, light houses, the planet Venus (an old classic)...

Somehow, ""Out of the Blue"" restored my belief in UFOs, which I lost when I was about 15 years old...

However, there are still major problems with the approach taken in the documentary. For instance, the laws of physics seem to suggest that travel faster than the speed of light is impossible. It's also somewhat mysterious why an advanced civilization would take the trouble to come here in the first place? What's their motive? Also, why have the USAF, CIA and NASA covered up so many UFO reports? What's *their* motive?

Here, the documentary attempts to be as ""respectable"" as possible. It doesn't mention any close encounters with the actual aliens supposedly manning the nuts-and-bolts space craft. Nor does it investigate the myriad of reports about ""alien abductions"". Contactees and UFO cults aren't featured either, despite being a vibrant part of the ufological landscape. If the team behind ""Out of the Blue"" can believe that a UFO has disabled nuclear warheads, or that a UFO landed in a British forest outside a US military base, why don't they believe, say, the Barney and Betty Hill abduction case, George Adamski or Whitley Strieber? This obviously calls for a closer discussion. Also, why don't they believe in a gigantic conspiracy from Roswell to Area 51? I'm not suggesting all these things are real. I'm simply pointing out a weakness in the methodology of the movie. What's their criterion of ""reality""?

Personally, I don't think UFOs are literal alien craft. If they are, I have to conclude that alien civilizations are even more stupid than humans! A clear case of evolutionary overspecialization-degeneration... As already noted, the natural laws of physics are pretty well known, and seem to preclude long-distance space travel by purely physical means. As for the illogical, occult and ""religious"" aspects of UFOs, they simply aren't going to go away. Perhaps there is a way to distinguish the occultist aspects from the nuts-and-bolts observations, but I frankly doubt it. As Hilary Evans quipped years ago: ""The last thing a nuts-and-bolts ufologist wants is for monsters to enter the stage. Unfortunately, people have seen too many strange creatures together with UFOs. We simply cannot get rid of the monsters"". (I'm quoting from memory but this was the gist of it.)

Whatever the explanation for the UFO phenomenon might be, it must somehow incorporate those monsters...

Despite that, I will nevertheless give ""Out of the Blue"" five stars. Monsters or not, this documentary at least shows that something *really* strange is going on at this godforsaken planet. Ah, I feel like 14 again!

I have never, ever seen a UFO, nor have I ever met anyone who has seen one. The individuals interviewed in this film do not seem at all loopy to me. They do not appear to be seeking publicity, and the former astronaut and government officials and military personnel (all non-civilians, if you will) are quite convincing, and put forth  compelling evidence about what they have witnessed. I do not believe they are lying! Do I think after watching this that our government is capable of keeping this from the public? You bet I do.

1950531,2,B0000VD0RO,"Perhaps one of the most interesting points of this DVD is the closing remarks where it is said that a lot of the information of this film could not be authenticated therefore it is left to viewer's discretion.  People are tired of character and reputation damaging ridicule, scorn, and of being dismissed as idiots and wanna-be fakers of allegedly trying to make possible for ourselves the big time benefits of fame, fortune, and being remembered for something unique and individual about ourselves.  Who is qualified to decide whether or not somebody deserves the positive reward they seek?  Community, family, social assemblies, academic pursuits, career environments, religious participation, private and/or public situations are all frontiers of human experience where each of us having subjected ourselves to them in one way or another, formulate anticipated return analysis so that we can be objective about our perspective and decide at what level we wish to continue submitting ourselves in that area of self-compromise.  Therefore, we tend to add disclaimers, loopholes, and escape clauses whenever we reduce our thoughts to writing so that our dreams don't end up replaced by regrets and so we are not incarcerated as those who need cleansed from society by permanent capital purging.  Nobody wants to commit themselves to culpability, responsibility, and/or expose themselves to the negative consequences of society's decision as to right or wrong these days; and given the ease of ability for research and the inherent reality that there is no end to ""experts"" on either side of any debate, many of us hesitate to offer any suggestion of any kind - to anybody.  Physically, spiritually, mentally, emotionally, financially, and esoterically, we all aspire to being given recognition, validation, significance, and to sense our own above average worth through tangible compensation of some type.  We all wish to be given (even if merely articulated) accolades of reward for performance, achievement, skills, experience, creativity, education, talent, motivation, integrity, honesty, ambition, and other arenas of excellence - real or imagined.  In fact, it is later in life many of us realize we will never be afforded opportunities, breaks, given a chance, or even have dumb luck let us fall into a position of fate providing us the better life and greater happiness that seems to elude us; unless we become convinced overwhelmingly that we can only achieve these vicariously.  It has been said that to find success you must have several connections and networks with people who WANT you to succeed, without which no amount of human effort can remove the foot of power off of the back of our neck.  Some people turn to chemical addiction, some to perversions and vice, and others turn to worship of some other thing or individual they consider higher than themselves - some other individual that has achieved what they themselves cannot (an example are extreme spectator level fans of professional sports, another example is the followings amassed by televangelists who bilk the multitudes out of life savings so that religious icon can live as though they were a peer to senators and congressional representatives who want us to believe they are public servants).  ""Out Of The Blue"" is a documentary for those of us who have come to realize we need something beyond above mentioned individually achieved independent routes for escape from our otherwise meaningless lives, and who look for that escape through any and all possible resources that lack legal consequences of the negative variety.  I doubt seriously if alien abduction would end up quite like most of us hope for, and unfortunately the genre of Sci-Fi fuels the nostalgic sentimentalization of what potential there is for wonderful and beautiful experiences beyond this earthly existence otherwise referred to as the ""rat race"" of working a thankless job and striving toward keeping your children out of prison or off of death row for being unable to adhere to irresistibly imposed requirements for social conduct and tolerance at the individual level (not found in larger society, groups, or committees).  If you believe that sitting in a chair for 40 years all by itself without further aggregate contribution gives you seniority rights of rank, privilege, and honor that negate any less senior peer regardless of the latter's education, performance, achievement, skills, experience, talent, motivation, honesty, creativity, ambition, integrity, honesty, or other allegedly superior characteristics, then you will criticize ""Out Of The Blue"" as being nothing but crap.  If you're not one of the cronies reaping benefits of being pandered to, then you might enjoy the potential this DVD suggests as frontiers for alternative human experience than what we've been exposed to so far.  If you are among those who fear a bit of metaphoric chlorine in the gene pool, then you won't be interested either.  ""Out Of The Blue"" held my attention for 2 hours and 35 minutes, and I would comment that they offer above average information on the subject of extraterrestrial life as being at least possible, especially since it is presented as being a documentary.  Released 2004, Hannover House studios, directed by James Fox, and narrated by Peter Coyote.  I like the presentation style, I like the sincerity of presentation, and I like how it doesn't keep repeating itself to fill up an allotted time requirement to justify being a documentary.  But there are more up-to-date films, photos, and interviews available.  I felt like this was presented by people who only consider the previous fifty or sixty years of information as viable, without regard to what has been happening in the last five years.  I was disappointed that all we got was whatever has been declassified due to the age of the information.  It is like waiting for the Vatican to release archeological discoveries that have information which challenges modern day thinking.  If I am to believe in UFO's and extra-terrestrial life, I don't want the history without the present.  Beam me up Scotty, or whoever that is standing at today's control console for the teleporter.",1318291200,2,6204,5.199598796389168

...why aliens have never visited us:

1. The laws of physics don't allow it
Folks, the nearest star is 4 light years away. This means it takes light 4 years to travel from there to Earth. In order for space travel to be realistic you would need a craft that travels greater than the speed of light. Unfortunately, in order for matter to travel AT the speed of light you would need an infinite amount of energy. Apparently the aliens have a gas tank that holds multiple infinite amounts of energy.

Out of the Blue - The Definitive Investigation of the UFO Phenomenon
1 star review by Eric Dunphy

Review name: ""hyperbola""

Question by ""STARTHROWER""
Is special relativity consistent with thermodynamics?
""STARTHROWER""
So now I am thinking about whether or not SR is consistent with thermodynamics.

Consider the time dilation formula:

\Delta t = \frac{\Delta t'}{\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}

By the axioms of algebra, v cannot equal c, unless \Delta t' = 0.

The basic argument I was thinking of is this.
Consider an object which is currently at rest in some inertial reference frame F, so in this frame v=0 right now. Now, of course this object has some temperature in this frame T. Now, suppose the object begins to accelerate in this frame, because some force is being applied to it. The speed v is now increasing. My next question is, is the temperature of this object relative or absolute?

Now, as the object moves faster and faster v gets closer to c. As the speed of this object increases, the quantity \sqrt{1-v^2/c^2} is a fraction whose value decreases.

With this in mind, as a body accelerates through some inertial reference frame, time for the body passes slower and slower, so that if this body finally reached the speed of light, time for it wouldn't pass at all. The way to interpret that mechanically, is to say that all the particles in it have stopped moving relative to each other. Using thermodynamics, that would mean that the temperature of the body reached absolute zero, in the inertial reference frame. Thus, a body starting at temperature T when its speed equals 0, and accelerating to the speed of light c, would have to have its temperature slowly approach absolute zero, and would reach absolute zero if the object ever reached speed c in the frame.
However, by thermodynamics, no body can ever reach a temperature of absolute zero degrees kelvin, and so no body can be accelerated to the speed of light (interesting way to draw this conclusion).

It is tempting to think that in the object's frame, the temperature of the ship is always T, and that things outside the object appear to be getting colder, because the time dilation formula is relativistic. If that were the case, then we could clearly say that temperature is relative, rather than absolute. But, I realize that the object is accelerating, and that SR doesn't strictly apply, because of this asymmetry between the two frames. Thus, relativity theory (generalized to accelerating frames), should predict that temperature is absolute, but is a function of speed. Thus, as the speed of the object increases, its temperature decreases, but its temperature in its frame is equal to its temperature in another frame.

The problem I see though, is that from relationship ""E=Mc^2"", it follows that as the object moves faster and faster, its total energy is increasing. Thus, if SR is correct, and thermodynamics is correct, then as a body's speed increases, its temperature is both increasing and decreasing, which is impossible. Hence, SR and thermodynamics are inconsistent. (Note that the rest energy of the object is a constant, and it is the kinetic energy that is increasing, but so then if the rest energy of an object is proportional to the temperature of an object, then that should be constant as the body speeds up.)

I would welcome anyone elses opinions on how relativity and thermodynamics interrelate. My whole point, is that there hasn't been much mathematical work on how relativity and thermodynamics work together. The total energy of a body is Mc^2, but where is there room for discussing the internal energy of a body, and the temperature of a body? Relativity simply doesn't adequately address thermodynamic issues (IMO).
 Comment by ""hyperbola""
absolute zero = -273 degrees centigrade
One must also take into account gravitational energy ""consumption""
 I would suggest that the condition of absolute  rest mass is at
 - 273 degrees centigrade.

Special relativity
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Henri Poincar  (Wikipedia) provided the mathematical framework for relativity theory by proving that Lorentz transformations are a subset of his Poincar group of symmetry transformations. Einstein later derived these transformations from his axioms.
Many of Einstein's papers present derivations of the Lorentz transformation based upon these two principles.[13]
Einstein consistently based the derivation of Lorentz invariance (the essential core of special relativity) on just the two basic principles of relativity and light-speed invariance. He wrote:
The insight fundamental for the special theory of relativity is this: The assumptions relativity and light speed invariance are compatible if relations of a new type (""Lorentz transformation"") are postulated for the conversion of coordinates and times of events... The universal principle of the special theory of relativity is contained in the postulate: The laws of physics are invariant with respect to Lorentz transformations (for the transition from one inertial system to any other arbitrarily chosen inertial system). This is a restricting principle for natural laws...[9]
Thus many modern treatments of special relativity base it on the single postulate of universal Lorentz covariance, or, equivalently, on the single postulate of Minkowski spacetime.

1950593,5,B0000VD0RO,Great and interesting video. Plenty of eye-witnesses and interviews with retired government and military officials. This DVD is a must have to add to your UFO movie collection. After watching this movie it has intrigued me even more to keep watch on our sky's. Filled with lots of amazing footage. One of the best out there thats for sure!,1306108800,4,339,4.762711864406779
1950594,3,B0000VD0RO,"This is a good film, but I found James Fox's more recent ""I Know What I Saw"" much better (a 5 star).  Definitely buy ""I Know What I Saw"" - it's more sophisticated, better made technically, documents the best UFO sightings, very good music, etc.  But having said that, I still like Out of the Blue.  Also, I found ""Phoenix Lights"" exceptionally good (another 5 star) - on par with I Know What I Saw.  I personally have all 3.",1304640000,5,424,4.2625
1950595,5,B0000VD0RO,"This is one of the best ones in my UFO collection. If anyone still doubt if UFO's exist and if they come from other planets, then this one is highly reccomended.",1303084800,2,161,4.225806451612903
1950596,5,B0000VD0RO,"This is a documentary for not only those who are avid believers in the UFO phenomenon, but for those who don't believe but are open minded.  It may even change the mind of some sceptics.  Watch it once and you will definitely believe there is something to it all.

Presidents, Generals, Astronauts, Airforce Colonels and the general public all talk of their experiences, and show that the governments are obviously covering up the truth.  This documentary lifts the lid on what is arguably the most talked about mystery of our times.

With real video footage, photographs and animations used to illustrate stories, secret documents and other solid proof, the watcher will go away saying, ""Of course they are real.""  Worth every cent for the DVD.",1292112000,4,745,4.92
1950597,5,B0000VD0RO,"This DVD is a few years old, but it continues to hold up in its' quality of research and care taken to produce a cohesive, non-exploitive look at the argument of whether we're alone, or not. I have been on a DVD/CD replacing binge following an apartment flooding, and although it took me a couple of weeks to get around to watching this after it arrived, I did get to watch it this week, and I still feel that it is one of the best documentaries offered on UFOlogy. Firstly, and as silly as it seems, the doc sets the right mood by having Peter Coyote narrate; I have seen some damned good documentaries before that were basically ruined by who the producers got to do over-voice, narration, etc. Mr. Coyote delivers his words with just enough urgency to make you sit up and pay attention to what he is offering; there's no ""And then, that's when this normal Kansas farmer looked up and saw an eighteen orb saucer hovering above his chicken coop!"" There's no flowery prose and drama, just plain facts - and plenty of them. I like this documentary because it uses good, clear video when showing caught-on-film instances of UFOs; I also appreciated that interviewed witnesses ranged from, yes, normal people (none of whom, surely to our government's disappointment, carried on in front of the camera by screeching, ""I seen me a flyin' saucer!"") to former politicians (possibly former because of their belief in UFOs and wanting sightings to be researched) to former astronauts (Gordon Cooper) to President Jimmy Carter. When Gordon Cooper is relating his experience, and how he turned the film over to his superiors (you'll have to watch it to find out the whole story), and then, well, golly gee, what a surprise, the film took a walk and that was that, you can hear the barely contained anger in Mr. Cooper's voice - and the betrayal he felt. In the last few years, yes, there has been such astonishing strides in CGI, photography, film and so forth that when what we see on Youtube is out of the norm to the slightest degree, we immediately react with  ""It's been doctored""...but there are things on film that this dvd shows that cannot be that easily dismissed. And as I said, the witnesses chosen to appear in the doc make all the difference - you watch and listen to these people, and without fail, you believe that they believe what they're saying. Mr. Cooper's testimony affected me to such a degree that I did a little bit of homework on him, and discovered that he passed away shortly after this documentary was made. Sooo, somewhere, Gordon Cooper knows for sure, now, and there ain't a damned thing the goverment can do about it. A great DVD!",1285977600,5,2652,4.61864406779661
1950598,5,B0000VD0RO,"I don't think there's enough room in 2 hours to cover this complex topic of UFOs, however Out of the Blue covers some basics so the viewer can deepen his research on it.
The witnesses presented are not hillbillies in the countryside of Arkansas. These are high government officials, educated professionals, military officers, astronauts, and even a few US presidents talking about strange flying aircrafts.
I heard about this documentary in the internet radio show ""Dark Matters"", look it up, its a very interesting one",1284940800,2,519,5.117647058823529
1950599,3,B0000VD0RO,"I don't see what all the hype was about. I was pretty disappointed. I heard great things about this DVD. Nothing new to me, very little about Col. Corso. The COMETA group was the one thing I knew nothing about. My question is where were the reports of every space shuttle sees UFO's? What about the Apollo missions? Armstrong and Aldrin speaking of something they thought was a jettisoned part of their spacecraft. How ""Santa Claus"" was the codename for UFO sightings in Space? Overall for UFO newbies this DVD would be amazing.",1281398400,6,528,4.688172043010753
1950600,5,B0000VD0RO,"Independent film-maker James Fox's widely respected documentary on the UFO phenomenon and evidence for the official cover-up is probably the best ever made on the subject, its only rival being his more recent 2009 film titled ""I know what I saw.""

""Out of the Blue"" presents some of the most convincing evidence for UFOs as real craft of non-human manufacture, and allows witnesses to speak for themselves. Researchers, politicians, high-ranking military and ex-military people and two astronauts (Dr. Edgar Mitchell and Gordon Cooper) speak frankly about what they know of the ET issue and how it is managed at the deepest level of government. It's good to see the French Government's COMETA report given such prominence in a mainstream documentary, because the content of this milestone report is generally unknown to many outside France unless they study the subject in detail.

The film is an excellent introduction for anyone either mildly curious about the issue or with little exposure to the mountain of hard evidence of unknown flying objects seen and radar-tracked in our skies. Fox wisely keeps to the best cases and most credible witnesses: he does not venture into the more paradigm-stretching areas of alien abductions, cattle mutilations or other controversial and unsettling (though compelling) aspects of the phenomenon. The film sticks to the basics, and as a consequence remains grounded and very difficult for a debunker to deal with. The viewer is left with a strong sense that yes, something is really there and there is a big cover-up - which was Fox's intended result.

Minor quibbles might be the use of jaunty, distracting synthesiser music on parts of the soundtrack and the now-mainly-discredited Philip Corso as one of the chief talking-head witnesses (though thankfully his sound-bites are relevant to the issue and his own questionable personal ego-driven claims largely edited out). Overall though, ""out of the Blue"" is first class with both content and tone exactly right.

If you only ever watch one film-documentary about the UFO issue, make it ""Out of the Blue."" Fox's follow-up film, ""I know what I saw,"" focuses on the participants in the November 2007 Washington DC press conference and their highly-credible stories, and is also worth seeing.",1278720000,3,2282,5.209809264305177
1950601,5,B0000VD0RO,"This one movie started me on the trail of research into UFOs. They are, first of all, quite REAL and well-documented. Many technologies we take for granted were back-engineered from alien vessels. The government keeps all UFO information 'top secret' despite a growing disclosure movement of those who were witnesses of UFO flights, crashes, aliens (alive and dead), or official government documents relating to these topics. The movie examines several major UFO sightings of military and government witnesses, stories I'd never heard before but are well-known in UFO circles.

People must be made aware of the huge amount of data that's been collected and 'disappeared' into the bowels of national security / military networks. It is time Americans demanded the truth.

Search YouTube for Alison Kruse, a lady in Murrysville, PA who is filming UFOs from her deck with a 3rd-generation nightvision camcorder. Her first video captured a low-flying UFO shooting a beam of light through the branches of a tree down to the ground. It was not observable with the naked eye. Her infrared surveillance cam regularly picks up energy orbs flying all over the place in the dead of winter (i.e., not bugs or bats). She has come within 150 ft. of glowing craft parked in the woods behind her house.

Google the Hessdalen, Norway sightings-- a rural Norwegian valley of 100 inhabitants also home to a large amount of UFOs. Fully researched by the Univ. of Oslo in cooperation with the SETI Project in Bologna, Italy, they determined with many different pieces of equipment that these phenomena are quite real and cannot be explained in terrestrial terms.

Google the cattle mutilations still taking place in the US. Over 10,000 mutilations have occurred worldwide that have nearly identical 'trademarks' which cannot be reproduced with any known technology. But cattle continue to be abducted from ranches then grotesquely 'returned' by being dropped from the air dead, drained of blood, and missing organs such as the tongue, udder, anus, genitals, an eye or ear and perhaps tissue from the side of the head. The cuts are so precise they appear to be separated cell by cell with absolutely no trauma to surrounding tissue. No tracks, blood or any other signs are ever found to explain who or what is doing this, or why.

Read Philip Corso's book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Day-After-Roswell/dp/067101756X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Day After Roswell</a>. Colonel Corso was handed the Roswell files in 1961, his first day on the job with army intelligence at the Pentagon. Inside the files were artifacts from the 1947 Roswell crash that were obviously not made on earth with human technology, along with alien autopsy reports. His job was to disseminate the technologies to research & development channels while disguising their source, and now we have lasers, fiber optics, night vision, integrated circuit chips and Kevlar. He states in the book that cattle mutilations and human abductions are done by aliens who may have malicious intent and that the Star Wars program was developed to stop a UFO invasion.",1262995200,8,3154,5.274900398406374
1950632,5,B0000VD0RO,"This is without question the most convincing documentary I have seen on the question of UFO visitations to earth.  More credible witnesses give more credible testimony here than I have seen elsewhere, on having seen UFO's and having had rather complex contact with them. Many are retired military men.  Certainly this particular compilation of material should prompt dedicated skeptics to re-think their dismissal of the whole idea of aliens visiting our planet.  And this is a good documentary to give to some one you might know who won't hear of the idea.  ---- What are the implications of this? Be afraid, be very afraid.  But also keep investigating.  Keep compiling information on this.  And let's hope people in our government are doing this.  Where it will all lead, I have no idea.  But it seems almost impossible to ignore  the sort of testimony presented here.  Also the productions values of this documentary are high, and there are not a lot of off putting ""special effects"" or creepy music that mar some ""documentaries"" on the subject.  The entire effort is much too dignified and substantive for that sort of thing.

1950633,5,B0000VD0RO,"Director James Fox has recently distinguished himself by making the two best documentaries about UFOs. This is quite an accomplishment considering the overwhelming majority of what's out there is absolute garbage. This is the first of his two films. The other, I Know What I Saw, recently aired on History Channel. In all probability this won't change your opinion of the subject of UFOs. I think most people are pretty well entrenched in one of two camps, believers and non-believers. What Fox does do is take very credible cases and witnesses and shows them in an objective light. While this may not make you change your mind right away, it will make you think. What I'd like to see is the rest of the UFO field produce programs of this caliber. Let me emphasize that in this program and I Know What I Saw, Fox has set the standard quite high. Perhaps at that point more people will take the subject seriously rather than laugh at people who claim to have seen things they can not explain.",1262044800,7,991,4.604519774011299

The difference between this documentary and many others is that it relies on official reports more than reports made by the public, making this documentary more credible and authentic.

I also liked how this film added animated simulation describing the several incidents reported by the public so that the veiwer could really imagine what was actually seen.
UFO reports at Phoenix, the UK, France, and several other significant places were covered and analysed in this film.

1950637,4,B0000VD0RO,"As you can probably tell by reading most of the previous reviews, this documentary (like most everything associated with UFOs) inspires a ""love it/hate it"" attitude. Most skeptics dislike this documentary because it takes a ""pro-UFO"" approach - while it carefully avoids stating that UFOs are alien spacecraft, the documentary does argue that UFOs are a ""real"", physical phenomenon and aren't simply hoaxes or people seeing swamp gas, stars, meteors, etc. Believers may not like the documentary because it doesn't claim that UFOs are from outer space, only that the phenomenon can't be dismissed as bunk and a sham. As a longtime UFO buff, and as someone who takes an ""open-minded skepticism"" towards the topic, in my opinion this documentary, while flawed, is nevertheless a high-quality, well-made effort to look seriously at the phenomenon. As a previous reviewer noted, the documentary consists mostly of ""talking head"" interviews with people who claimed to have seen UFOs, and with scientists debating whether or not travel between the stars is even possible. I thought ""Out of the Blue"" did a good job of showing that many credible scientists believe that interstellar travel is a possiblility, and that the common dismissal that UFOs can't exist because space travel is ""impossible"", is increasingly inaccurate. Several of the scientists interviewed - and they are all credentialed scientists in their fields - offer some intriguing theories as to how interstellar travel may be possible within the next few centuries (and if it could become possible here, who's to say some other intelligent life form hasn't already discovered how to do it?). In addition to the scientists, the documentary features interviews with pilots, astronauts (such as Gordon ""Hot Dog"" Cooper, an original Project Mercury astronaut), retired military officers, and ordinary citizens talking about their own UFO experiences. Some of these people will be familiar to UFO buffs, and their credibility varies. One of the most dubious people interviewed is Philip Corso, a former U.S. intelligence officer who claims that he was an ""insider"" on a massive government coverup of UFOs. Corso's often wild claims have come under considerable criticism from not only UFO skeptics but even from many believers, and a number of his claims have been proven to be false. A number of prominent skeptics have even used Corso's presence in this documentary to dismiss its credibility entirely. And that's a shame, because the documentary also offers interviews with other, much more credibile, witnesses. Among them is Robert Jacobs, a former military officer who in 1967 was assigned to film a missile launch in California; he claims that his film clearly showed a strange object shooting down the missile. His claims were verified by his commanding officer; the documentary shows copies of the letters verifying Jacobs' story. Overall, I found ""Out of the Blue"" to be a well-made and persuasive argument for the notion - not that UFOs are alien spacecraft - but rather that not all UFO incidents can be dismissed as hoaxes or misidentified natural phenomena and that some of them are still ""unsolved"" and are worthy of serious study.

Just short while ago you could only get it for about 79.99. Luckily for us, we're able to find it a bit cheaper now...

This video, originally produced for SCI Fi network, has really never seen the light of day since it's premire on Television. You won't find it televised any longer, but sincerely? Why?  It seemed to make it's grand appearance after an introduction by CNN for it's premiere then it just seemed to vanish from the public eye.  Now what's the real reason for this? We can speculate for sure, but pressure from government is always a possiblity when a documentary directly impliments our government to be covering up the truth about UFO since Roswell.

And why is the price still a bit high for a simple UFO video that should be attainable by everyone? Well, just maybe because it's THE ultimate UFO documentary and directly addresses our government as one of the real reasons why we're literally left ""Out of Blue"" when it comes to the truth behind the UFO phenomenon.  While thankfully more of these DVD's are turning up and the prices are becoming more reasonable for us devoted Amazon customers, we still have to ask, why isn't this video in full fledged production anymore so everyone can watch? This may be sincerely the video that the government does not want you to see!

Out of the Blue divulges you into the most intriguing cases that have never been able to be dismissed. With all the hoaxes out there, and even the UFO fanatics will agree, there are so many fakers out there...But there are probably around 5% of UFO cases that have never been unexplained by scientific terms, this video mostly discusses that 5%. It also may prove to a certain extent that your own government has been lying to you and has been covering up the UFO Phenomenon from day one.  You'll see and hear eye-witness accounts along with military pilots, a world reknown astronaut, airline pilots, and even a past United State President,  now these guys are worth listening to.

No longer considered a joke, the UFO phenomenon is starting to make news headlines, we're finally seeing more on CNN, and even legit newspapers, and this is partly due to excellent documentaries like this one that stresses the fact something is going on and cannot be ignored anymore. With the increased amount of video technology, it's simply a matter of time before something big is going to end up on your daily news.  Increased UFO sights are happening all the time and it's amazing to me we still dont' have all the answers from the government that we should have by now. I personally can say this is the most enthralling and thought provoking video on UFO's I have ever seen. It's probably better than my 2nd favorite video concerning the ""Phoenix Lights "" sighting back in 1997. This video does not prove anything, all it proves there is something going on out there that nobody has yet to explain, it's 100% up to you what to decide. If you're a skeptic, I implore you to just watch it, I guarantee when the credits roll, you just might say to yourself, ""well, maybe I should look up at night sky a bit more often.""",1209340800,7,3335,4.589915966386554
1950673,5,B0000VD0RO,"This is a well-done video covering the history of the modern UFO phenomenon and the associated policy of official coverup.  There's lots of good footage and interviews concerning well known cases as well as many pieces of footage and recordings of government officials and military/aviation personnel as well as astronauts and astrophysicists offering their input confirming the evidence that Earth is being visited by beings from elsewhere.  Philip Corso, Richard Dolan, Gordon Cooper, Edgar Mitchell, Steven Greer, and many other well known figures are featured here, and you'll also see Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, and other politicians' comments about UFOs and ETs.  This film deals with solid data and reports and is good for showing skeptics as well as believers.  It doesn't get into close encounters much, but there's only so much you can fit into a single film and this film focuses on the most reputable sources whom skeptics would have a hard time questioning the integrity of.

1950676,1,B0000VD0RO,"...why aliens have never visited us:

1. The laws of physics don't allow it
Folks, the nearest star is 4 light years away. This means it takes light 4 years to travel from there to Earth. In order for space travel to be realistic you would need a craft that travels greater than the speed of light. Unfortunately, in order for matter to travel AT the speed of light you would need an infinite amount of energy. Apparently the aliens have a gas tank that holds multiple infinite amounts of energy.

2. The Federal Government is one of the most incompetent entities ever created
One argument for lack of evidence is due to the government's ability to keep people from talking. Gee, why don't the feds use this fabulous influence they have over people to stop murder, rape, robbery, etc. They couldn't keep Watergate or Iran-Contra a secret, but somehow they are able to keep a lid on the greatest story in human history (for 60-some years, no less)?

3. MONEY!!!
People risk their lives & freedom every day for relatively paltry amounts of money compared to what could be earned being the first person to come forward with credible evidence of intelligent alien life. Successful theives, robbers, embezzlers, spies and the like are paupers compared to these potential riches.

4. YouTube
The use of video & photographic technology has ballooned in the past 30 years. You'd think at the very least a chance encounter would have been captured by now; certainly there are enough people walking around with the technology right in their pockets to make this happen, yet there is still no *definitive* evidence of aliens or their spaceships.

1950679,4,B0000VD0RO,"This was a pretty intriguing video.  Anytime you have a collection of testimony of UFO's from generals, presidents, and astronauts, along with footage of ""UFO's"", you got a darned entertaining video.

A few knocks against it before I make the faint theoretical biblical tie-in.  This ting is way expensive and hard to track down for cheap (I've never seen a DVD go from like 15 bucks to $120 used!!! What's up?  Can't the producers, or discovery channel, or whoever make some more of these if they're so popular?  The government doesn't really give a hoot, methinks, do they?)

Another bone I have to pick:  Don't the supposed ""UFO"" sightings in Bejing, China and the Miami skyline LOOK REMARKABLY LIKE BLIMPS REFLECTING LIGHT!!!?????

I find it hard to believe that they're anything else considering that like only one guy with a camera took the time to spot this thing if it really was a UFO when there's like millions of people around these two areas, especially.

Anywho, the Phoenix deal is very compelling; it would help if the video focused a little more on the many more photos of that deal that I think exist,... and to be balanced perhaps question military officials on what else it could be, like some type of holographic weapons design or something.

As for ""UFO's"" in the bible?  Well, there are a number of far left theories about the ""cloud of fire"" that traveled around Moses and the like.  I've also seen documentaries in which fairly dated paintings of the Virgin Mary and the Christ child have what appear to be a metallic disc in the air in the background.  The vision of Ezekiel (Ezekiel chapter 1) is certainly a compelling story about beings looking out from windows of discs, ""wheels within the wheels"", in which the bible declares that ""the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels"" -- a clear indication that these supposedly angelic beings were operating in some type of mechanical transport.  If Godly angels operate using these things... then what about the fallen angels taking advantage of technology?  That of course is where the extreme right church view comes in: that all UFO's are either demonic deception or actually demons themselves in transport.

For an open, yet not-too-fanatical biblical debate on the matter, I suggest checking out Pastor Chuck Missler (of Calvary Chapel) and some of his teachings, which include a video entitled ""Return of the Nephilim"" I believe.  This biblical theory suggests that the flood came because angels (the sons of God) came into the ""daughters of men"" (Genesis 6) producing a race of supposed supernatural beings denoted as the nephilim (which are actually the UFO aliens).  Pretty interesting theories; many in the Calvary Chapel movement, for the record, totally despise the guy.

And while you're there on Missler's site, you can check out stuff about Jesus.  He's pretty interesting too, you know.

Speaking of, one reviewer (John Marvel) states that people who follow this stuff are doing so out of ignorance and boredom.  I suggest looking at that cat's reviews.  Yeah, .....sleepers.  And most of his reviews are on stuff he himself gave a one star rating!!!  How sad is that?  Who's got the mundane life now, buddy?",1170288000,13,3207,4.881700554528651

1950722,5,B0000VD0RO,"Out of the Blue, which first aired on the Sci-Fi Channel, is an excellent, sound, and sober documentary that ends up being as much about the cover-up as the UFO phenomenon itself, which is only to be expected since the two cannot be separated until the dark veil of truth is finally torn asunder.  While you can't even begin to examine more than a few of the most compelling UFO cases in such a short amount of time, the video does offer a good overview of the history of UFO activity and highlights a select number of important sightings and events from various parts of the world.  A vast array of experts (scientists, astronauts, cosmonauts, physicists, pilots, military officers, government officials) are consulted, and many competent witnesses describe what they saw or experienced.  Roswell, Rendlesham Forest, the 1976 Iranian air force encounter, and the more recent Phoenix Lights are all mentioned, but the scientific rigor of the presentation precludes any mention of more sensational topics such as alien abduction.  Among the most significant (but less famous) events touched upon are Gordon Cooper's filming of a craft landing and taking off from a California military base in 1955 (the film disappeared after it got to D.C.), footage of a Trident missile being blown apart by laser-beam-like weapons from a UFO, and the disabling of 10-20 nuclear missiles in Montana missile silos by a UFO which hovered over the base in broad daylight).

The second half of the video really gets to the heart of the official cover-up, wherein, in America, a completely covert group even denies requests for information from presidents (Carter), senators (Goldwater), Congressmen (Steven Schiff of New Mexico), and FBI directors (including J. Edgar Hoover).  While some provocative information has somehow been obtained via the Freedom of Information Act, the paper trail of government lies extends as far as the eye can see, typified by the infamous Condon report, an ""objective"" study led by an academic who made clear his unrestrained bias both before and after he wrote his bogus summary of the group's findings (findings which included several unexplained cases with a high probability of being extraterrestrial in origin).  The government's contempt for and ridicule of those who would press them on the UFO issue is best typified by Arizona's disgrace of an ex-governor, Fyfe Symington, who - five hours after vowing a serious investigation into the source of mysterious lights seen by thousands of concerned citizens - held a live press conference in which he dressed his chief of staff in an absurd alien costume and had a big laugh identifying this ""alien"" as the culprit.

In contrast to the USA, whose highest leaders have no idea themselves as to what covert group actually knows the truth, other governments have been much more forthcoming with serious information about documented UFO incidents.  While I hate to say anything good about France, the 1999 COMETA report (little reported outside of France itself), based on a study by the Institute of Higher Studies for National Defence, sets a new standard for the proper and serious investigation of the UFO phenomenon by a professional group of objective scientists and military men.  This report does not state categorically that UFOs are real, but it does conclude that ""Only one hypothesis takes into account the available data: the hypothesis of extraterrestrial visitors,"" and stresses the importance of figuring out what the goal of any such visitors is on this planet.

Basically, the only people who won't take anything away from this documentary are close-minded skeptics who would not believe in the vaguest possibility of UFOs even if one landed on their foot.  Out of the Blue truly raises the bar for all quality UFO documentaries now and in the future.",1159574400,71,3831,5.092503987240829
1950723,4,B0000VD0RO,"For decades, officials of the US government (among others) have been issuing statements that UFO phenomena are of no scientific or national security interest. This documentary shows that the opposite is the case, even up to the highest levels of government and the military. Memoirs, personal interviews, and documents obtained under the Freedom of Information Act are interwoven to show a pattern of official ""interest"" bordering on alarm, and for good reason.

Witnesses are chosen with care and include not only ordinary citizens but former commanding officers of nuclear-capable military bases, a former Mercury astronaut, and a US President, to name a few. The persons taking such claims seriously include no less than Lord Admiral Peter Hill-Norton, former Chief of the Defence Staff of the United Kingdom.

The main point here is not that there are extraterrestrial craft in our skies, but that the highest US officials, despite their denials, seem to think so. Officials of other governments, most more open about their interest in UFOs, are brought in as well. This is not meant to be a comprehensive history of UFO phenomena but an unequivocal rejection of Washington's public stance on that subject.

1950725,3,B0000VD0RO,"(Pssst...UFOs are real,

but the governments of the world are actually

trying to keep that fact a secret. Yeah! Pass it on...)

There, I just saved you fifteen bucks.

Strictly for the novice only, this repetitive documentary

is a hodgepodge of ineptly depicted UFO sightings, paltry

soundbites, bogus videos mixed unidentifiably with some

authentic images, and lots of be amazed by our

firm-grasp-of-the-obvious padding.

The basic gist of this tedious,redundant

2 hours is, gasp!:

for obvious and murky national security reasons the earth's

governments have been hoarding all sorts of intelligence

that prove UFOs exist and most likely provides positive

evidence of their nature.  The genuinely interested would

be better advised to read R. Dolan's UFOs And The National

Security State (though, on reconsideration, I have serious

doubts about that study. All this basic ""Black Ops"" fashion

stuff is wearing a bit thin in the justification for any

conspiracy theory universe that is so popular withal).

In keeping with this documentary's jumpy, choppy,

nonchronological, trying to cover all the bases format,

some observations:

* For God's sake, people, please read all of Eisenhower's

""Military Industrial Complex"" 1961 speech.  I am tired of

hearing a small part of it used to distort its overall

meaning, which was a plea for ""balance"".

* As much as I honor the right stuff of former astronauts,

their every utterance does not constitute unassailable proof.

Same goes for the laughable attempts at getting Presidents

Ford and Carter - and Web Hubble of all people! - to spill

the beans.  It's easy to get video footage but too much

time is wasted on this sort of junk.

* It's a pity that the producers were able to obtain such

rare archival footage, and recent interviews with serious

researchers and witnesses, but do so little with it all.

I would have loved to hear more from Friedman, Dolan,

Greer, or see more of that CBS special or of Major Keyhoe.

* Wouldn't it have been wiser, simpler and far more effective

to concentrate on, say, the Phoenix Lights sightings and

Rendlesham Forest and a few other similar incidents rather

than trying to cram 60 years worth of history - plus some

specious speculations on interstellar travel - into a mere

couple of hours?

Anyway, I credit this documentary for not straying too far

into Lazar's back-engineered la-la land, as most ""exposes:

so predictably insist on doing.

And to be fair, a truly praiseworthy

""definitive"" treatment of the UFO enigma would require,

at a minimum, 6 hours - 8 hours if done by Mr. Burns.

In the meantime, if you want to see something worthwhile

and done with quality, try the Discovery Channel's special

on the Jan 5, 2000 Illinois UFO sightings, or Unsolved

Mysteries' UFO box set.  Much, much better values for your

hard-earned dollar.

Considering this and Taken, when will SciFi channel ever

get it right?",1133481600,12,2940,5.002083333333333

So when watching this type of production it is paramount to consider the veracity of the sources before passing judgement of the overall subject.  Out of the Blue meets this challenge with many interviews of witnesses who can only be considered front line serious witnesses.  National heros and highly educated and trained specialists complete the collection of many witnesses to create a vivid and compelling case that something serious is going on, and that it has been for a long time.  Their testimony, along with some very compelling film and video footage, makes this DVD a real wake up call for those still denying this phenomenon.  The only shortcoming of this production is that amidst all of this great material, the producers still threw in a few older stock file footages that I feel are a hinderance to credibility since they just seem to be fraudulent.  They are unneccesary additions to an already top-shelf production.
