8454316,3,B0052SO0TW,"This Is a good Hollywood Western, not a great movie.  I was highly disappointed when I watched this film for the first time upon receiving the DVD.  This is billed as a Spaghetti Western on the Spaghetti Western Data Base site.  It IS NOT  a Spaghetti Western.  It is definitely a Hollywood, USA production.  This movie could have used the directorial talents of Sergio Leone, Salimas, or Corbucci.  I know I'm going to be raked over the coals for this, BUT Elmer Bernstein is no Ennio Moriconne.  This movie should have been filmed in Spain.as well.  It lacked the grittiness of the truly great Spaghetti Westerns.  It could have been ranked with The Man With No Name Trilogy, and many of the top Zapata Westerns.",1487635200,,714,4.64

8454319,4,B0052SO0TW,"I give it 4 stars for entertaining. My question is the aspect ratio. I have not purchased this movie, but just watched it on THIS Channel this morning. The aspect ratio listed is 1:77:1. When the movie started and throughout the credits the movie was shown in 2:35:1. Then, as in most TV versions switched to the full screen format of 4:3.
This would be more to my liking if the DVD was in the 2:35:1. Unless the 1:77:1 was the original aspect prior to the cut to 2:35:1. Silverado was done that way and I happen to obtain a copy in 1:77:1 or 1:88:1, although the box had 2:35:1 and when I talked to the studio about the error,  they told me it was filmed in the ratio I had, then cut to the 2:35:1. Somehow, my version was an accident in getting packaged. My daughter had purchased the 2:35:1 version and on comparison, the width of both movies were the same, except the top and/or bottom on mine were obviously shortened to make her 2:35:1 version. I kept the original, although I was offered the chance to switch them.",1391126400,,1021,4.345549738219895

At the right price you shouldn't be dissappointed...support your favorite artists.",1390089600,,274,5.7073170731707314
8454321,4,B0052SO0TW,"Good, solid, action-packed western perfect for a rainy day, or anytime for good, meat and potatoes western movie fans.  Item arrived in great condition, good dvr-quality picture.  Peppard was always a rather underrrated action star of the late 60's early 70's.  Entertaining film all the way around!",1360540800,5,299,5.319148936170213

8454323,4,B0052SO0TW,"After the Euro Western changed the look and feel of the genre in the mid sixties, everyone wanted to get on the bandwagon and it didn't take long for Hollywood to try and capitalize on it also.  Utilizing American and European crews and actors, a handful of mediocre product was shot in Spain and Mexico of which this 'CANNON FOR CORDOBA'-1970 is a standout.  George Peppard hones his Hannibal Smith cigar chomping 'A TEAM' character by portraying an agent for the US Army hired to enlist his own band of cut throats into a suicide mission to infiltrate Mexican revolutionary bandit Cordoba's fortress and take out his artillery and especially, his prized cannons.  The film tried to capture the feel of the political westerns of its day and resembles Director Don Taylor's Euro Western 'THE FIVE MAN ARMY'-1969 with touches of Director Robert Aldrich's 'THE DIRTY DOZEN'- 1967 but never seems to grip the viewer as it should. Perhaps because it is directed by Paul Wendkos who is known for his television efforts and would go on to helm the excellent occult thriller 'THE MEPHISTO WALTZ- 1970.  He tries to bring a grittiness to the proceedings such as some minor scenes of torture and blood letting but the photography by Antonio Macasoli is to pretty and lush for this type of affair.  The film combines Euro and American actors such as Don Gordan, cult actor Pete Duel in a great role, Raf Vallone chewing the scenery as the villain Cordoba, and Gabriele Tinti who was married to actress Laura Gemser and,unfortunately, doesn't show up for this party.  Keen Euro viewers will also spot Aldo Sambrell, beautiful Francine York, Giovanna Ralli who graced many a spaghetti western, and Hammer actress Kate O'Mara.  The music by Elmer Bernstein is as lackluster as the film and not one of his memorable scores.  It is a pity that the film with all of its explosions and intrigue comes off so flat.  Peppard gives it his all, however,saving the film and elevating it to my four star rating.  MGM releases it as a DVD-R in a beautiful 2.35 widescreen flawless transfer with a trailer as its only extra.  Watching this film now, it shows how Hollywood tried to duplicate the Euro-Western but just could not grasp what it was all about.  Along with Director John Guillerman's 'EL CONDOR'- 1970 and Director Ted Post's 'HANG EM HIGH'-1968, it emerges as a missed opportunity but does rate a better reputation for Western fans in need of some blood and dust for their oater fare.  Its worth a look for George Peppard's performance alone, an actor who always managed to elevate the proceedings in every film he was in",1327708800,4,2609,4.758314855875832
8454324,4,B0052SO0TW,"I love western movies with storylines based in Mexico.  I was not disappointed by this copy of this very rare gem.

I think that George Pepperd was great in the movie, and the setting was also brilliant.

Would recommend to any one who loves the wester genre, especially those set in Mexico.

This widescreen edition is in good condition.",1327363200,8,338,4.677966101694915
