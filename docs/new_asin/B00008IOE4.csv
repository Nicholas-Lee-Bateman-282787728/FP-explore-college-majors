7984547,5,B00008IOE4,"This volume is focused on tennis serves, and is presented very well. There are slow motion replays to lay emphasis on various points. The pace is natural and easy to follow.",1350259200,,173,4.612903225806452
7984548,5,B00008IOE4,"This video is divided into short teaching segments that break down every aspect of the ground stroke.  It is great for beginners and experienced players who have had a ""bad day.""",1257033600,,178,4.741935483870968
7984549,5,B00008IOE4,"Tom Avery doesn't over-complicate things, nor does he oversimplify them. You can't wait to apply what you've learned!

I have the whole 8 DVD series of his called, ""Consistent Tennis Wins"", which I also recommend.

These DVDs deal with the:
Serve
Return of Serve
Backhand
Ability to Swing
Net Play
Singles & Doubles Tips
Specialty Shots (lobs, slice, etc) and the
Original

It costs more than others, because you get what you pay for!",1201651200,,434,4.837837837837838
7984550,5,B00008IOE4,"I am partial to Tom Averys superior teaching technique. On this DVD, Tom has you focus on two things at a time and grooves those points into your muscle memory. Once practiced & grooved into your muscle memory, you own the stroke. My serve, backhand, forehand and net play have improved ten fold. I have his complete set of DVD's and refer to them over and over again. It's like having a teaching pro in my living room at all times, and a tennis lesson a push of a button away. Thanks to Tom my game has improved imensely. Trust! This is the AAAA+++",1105574400,2,549,4.288461538461538
7984551,3,B00008IOE4,"I purchased this DVD, as well as the first one (Consistent Tennis I).  If you already own the first one, DON'T buy this one since it contains almost the same info.  This one has a few more details, it isn't worth the money to buy both.  I'd by the first one over this.  Also Avery has an annoying guitar solo at the beginning which seems totally inappropriate.  It's like those actors who try to sing...",1060646400,8,403,4.32
7984552,5,B00008IOE4,Simplicity in presentation and Tom's natural ability to instruct leads to improved tennis.  This tape is another fabulous tape.  It will improve your tennis regardless of your level of play.  I continue to learn so much from Tom's tapes.  I often rewatch the tapes to focus on areas I am having difficulties with.  It is like having your own personal instructor whenever you need or want one.  Tom produces the best instructional tapes ever!,1056672000,2,441,4.891891891891892
7984553,5,B00008IOE4,"This tape will be especially valuable for intermediate and advanced club players.  Each stroke is considered for problem areas and simple, usable solutions are presented and demonstrated. The segment on volleying was especially clear and helpful.",1053475200,2,246,5.833333333333333
