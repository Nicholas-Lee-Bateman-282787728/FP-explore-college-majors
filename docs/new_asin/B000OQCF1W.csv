8186207,5,B000OQCF1W,"I have taken more than half a dozen undergraduate courses in economics (microeconomics, global economy, international monetary policy, etc) and I still found a large amount of Tim Taylor's presentation useful.  I listened to this course on audio while walking, driving, and riding the bus.  I don't have much time to spare in my day, so I found this lecture series to be a great way to optimize my time.

Taylor's presentation of information is fun and lively!  He covers everthing from basic micro/macro to aggregate supply/demand, and he even hits upon the federal reserve's structure, responsibilities, and so on.  If you would like to develop a foundational knowledge of undergraduate economics, this is the way to go.  Honestly, there are few lecture series by the teaching company that I wouldn't recommend, but this is in the top 25% of the 40 series from the Teaching Company that I have watched/listened.",1291766400,6,913,5.013245033112582
8186208,5,B000OQCF1W,"I should point out that I'm only about 1/3 of the way through the material, but so far, I really have enjoyed the CDs. Recommended.

UPDATE: I wrapped up the CDs. I really enjoyed them. Definitely recommended.",1281744000,4,209,4.648648648648648
