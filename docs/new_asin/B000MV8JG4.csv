8172806,5,B000MV8JG4,"Stephen Ray has come up with a great little Bible study on the founding of the Davidic Kingdom in the Judeo-Christian historical period.

As with his other presentations in this series, his presentations are shot-through with Bible references, and his interpretations are spot-on.  He takes you to the places that are known (if known) or are believed to be the sites of the various Bible stories.  He also cross references what is known about history and culture to give a much better, richer and deeper understanding of what is related to us in God's Holy Word.

Ray's presentation is, as always exuberant.  His polish has improved since he started the ""Footprints of God"" series.  I do heartily recommend this episode as I have every one of the episodes he has previously put out in this series, and I eagerly look forward to the rest of the episodes that he has planned.

This series is a must-see for any serious Bible Scholar!",1237420800,6,931,4.745341614906832
