2670602,5,B000JJ3Y78,"What made ""Arrested Development"" great also doomed it to inevitable ratings failure:  it was the sitcom series that demanded to be watched in its entirety in sequence.  Debuting just prior to the saturation of Tivo/DVRs, it failed to quickly capture a mainstream audience.  By the time the critical acclaim was pouring in, many would-be viewers tuned in for a taste, only to be frustrated by obscure plot references, running jokes, and a huge cast for a comedy.

On the other hand, all of this makes ""Arrested Development"" the perfect show for viewing on DVD.  This set includes the entire run of the show - three seasons.  In a good news/bad news proposition, the show's creators knew well in advance that Fox was cancelling it, which allowed them to script an actual ending to the entire saga.  Most shows simply disappear with all of their loose ends dangling these days, but this isn't the case with AD.

There isn't anything new about this release vs. the prior individual season releases - it's simply those three sets bundled together.  However, this bundle is marked down significantly compared to the individual cost of the prior sets. So, while the long-time devotee doesn't get any new content here, anyone who was tempted to try out this monumental achievement in TV comedy is now able to do so at an incredible price.  Even the packing is nice - the eight discs are in slimline cases so they won't eat up too much of your shelf space.

Buy two - you'll like it so much, you'll want to give it to a friend, too (I have twice already).",1165190400,14,1546,4.647058823529412

""Far and Away the Best Sitcom on Broadcast Television"" - San Francisco Chronicle

Saw it on television and laughed, but when I bought the DVDs and started from the beginning my life changed.  I have watched the seasons through at least five times.  There is not one dull moment in the 53 episodes in the life of Arrested Development.  Anytime I can just think of the Bluth Family and I can laugh.  There is nothing better out there YOU NEED TO SEE THIS.  If you own one television series this is it, there is nothing that will be worth watching over and over like Arrested Development.",1165190400,3,689,4.544715447154472
2670604,5,B000JJ3Y78,"In my humble opinion there is no better show on TV; Arrested Development is the cream of the crop.  I rarely watch TV but Arrested Development took me in hook line and sinker and I could not wait for the next episode.  One word of advice you need to watch this show in order starting with season 1 disk 1 to season 3 disk 2, if you don't you will have no clue about the Aztec Tomb, The Blue Man Group, the one armed man (both of them),the twin brothers, Gob(or is it Jobe?) Bluth, Steve Holt's dad, the importance of the frozen banana stand, the prosecution, Scandal Makers, Girls with low self esteem, Bob Loblaw, Annyong, Kitty and Mr. X... And is that Carl Weathers, Charlize Theron, Zach Braff, Liza Minnelli, Ben Stiller and Julia Louis-Dreyfus I see?

This is not to be missed, and at this price is a steal!",1165190400,3,813,4.3355263157894735
2670605,5,B000JJ3Y78,"Seinfeld IMHO was a bit over rated...and this show under rated.

In this series, characters develop over the three seasons....a real family....with a lot of interesting people who's lives have been changed but don't want to accept it......and that is what makes this series so entertaining. A little too smart for it's own good.

Many people just want Jackass 1 and 2 and 3 and (keep counting):)",1165190400,,395,4.880597014925373
2670606,5,B000JJ3Y78,"I'm not usually one for superlatives or hyperbole, but this truly is the best TV show I know of. It's clever, it's hilarious, it's self-referential, it's perfectly written and flawlessly acted, it dragged me along from episode to episode like some kind of addict. And when it was over -- I mean, really really over -- I felt a bittersweet mixture of the loss of future possible episodes and a total satisfaction in having been well and thoroughly entertained.

As for the DVD set, in my mind, the only reason to own a TV series on DVD is if I feel I'll watch the shows again and again. And with these, there is no question in my mind. There's more to them than you can usually get in one viewing, and they just get better each time. The only concern for me is whether I should buy an extra set in case my primary set gets damaged. It's THAT good.",1165190400,136,846,4.2875
2670607,5,B000JJ3Y78,"Never again can I imagine loving a show more than I do this one.  It was with the saddest of hearts that I learned of its impending cancellation.  After it went off the air I no longer had any shows that I made it a point to watch, other than The Office.  No matter how many times I watch these episodes I catch something new.  Something that turned out to be foreshadowing a future event in a later episode, a callback to a previous episode that I hadn't caught before, or just more hilarious lines that I couldn't hear over my own laughter.  You can not possibly go wrong with buying this series.",1165190400,11,598,4.256637168141593
2670608,5,B000JJ3Y78,"The Nielsen ratings did a huge dis-service to the writers, cast, crew, Fox and the viewing audience, by having this show culled prematurely.

This is without doubt one of the most original, entertaining and genuinely funny TV shows you will ever see. It's utterly addictive, to boot.

Given that Friends aired for ten years, it's a mystery why Arrested was given only two and a half. A crime.

You will not be disappointed!

Buy and enjoy!",1165190400,21,439,4.7368421052631575
2670609,5,B000JJ3Y78,"FOX really hit a wall by cancelling one of TV's most promising shows. It's always depressing watching a good thing go up in flames and well, viewers can thank Rupert Murdoch and his excellent team at FOX for this. Then again, if they brought back the horrendously repetitive Family Guy, it shouldn't be a problem bringing back something of this caliber, which by the way is absolute excellence.

What else is there to say?

With some of the best writing in television since the early days of Seinfeld, Mitchell Hurwitz is an absolute genius making Arrested Development one of the best shows to hit television airwaves. Narrator Ron Howard fittingly tells the story of each episode with humor and a colliding sense of foreshadowing that has expectations running high for hilarious disasters to ensue.

Jason Bateman plays Michael Bluth, a family man and widower of his late wife, who comes into the business after his father, George Sr.(Jeffrey Tambor) is incarcerated for an Enron-esque scandal. The surrounding family, whose cast includes the equally exhilerating David Cross alongside newer faces Will Arnett and Michael Cera, adds ridiculous subplots that blend a healthy mixture of realism and surrealism.

Each episode somehow tops the predessesor and it's impossible to try to understand how a show of this magnitude and comedic epic was able to be taken away. Perhaps buying this DVD will help bring it back and as sorry as I am to say that the DVD enticed me into the television show, hopefully the same can be said of you reading this now.

More buyers means more viewers...

Come one, come all!",1164585600,52,1604,4.9222222222222225
2670610,5,B000JJ3Y78,The funniest show ever.  Enough said.,1163808000,11,37,5.166666666666667
2670611,5,B000JJ3Y78,"ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT's rocky history is well known.  Loved by critics and its fans, it fought to find an audience, and its final season was a short affair.  However, the ride from the shows premier (included uncensored and expanded along with the aired version) to its conclusion (and, YES, it has a conclusion) is hilarious and worth many returns.  There are so many jokes and resonating gags that multiple viewings are REQUIRED, but your first visit to the world of the spoiled Bluth family will be a reward for unfamiliar viewers.

Here are three seasons of laughs.  The series begins with the arrest of the Bluth patriarch and continues as the clan's only responsible member, Michael (portrayed by Jason Bateman), tries to keep the family's business afloat while his mother, siblings, and other family members selfishly grab for every freebie and dollar.  His mother, Lucille, is a cold, controlling alcoholic whose loyalty to her family keeps her one step from pure villainy.  His siblings include an older brother, Gob, a magician (of little skill), a younger brother, Buster, a mama's boy who eventually loses a body part to a nasty seal, and a sister whose marriage is ... complicated.  Throw in a long-suffering son infatuated with his cousin and an uncle who is the twin of his father, and you can see how complicated Michael's life becomes.

Not your average family, not your average TV comedy (this is NOT a sitcom performed live in front of a studio audience but is filmed more like a documentary with the camera floating around like an unseen voyeur  -- think the old comedy series SOAP updated a la THE OFFICE).  The jokes come fast and furious.  It's all absurd and incredibly entertaining.

For the record, the series is presented widescreen, and there are deleted scenes and audio commentaries for selected episodes.  To tell you the truth, I haven't even skimmed these extras, but I have watched the series in its entirety far too many times to disclose without embarrassing myself.  It's too bad that ARRESTED DEVELOPMENT didn't achieve the ratings necessary to keep it afloat, but it has more laughs than comedies that lasted twice as long.",1162944000,271,2161,4.914600550964187

If you are easily offended by portrails of dysfunctional family.... Don't watch.  The humor stems from dysfunction and conflict without getting mean or painful to watch.  Anyone with a goofy family should appreciate the overall humor.  Commentary is also available on the set which is great too.  Ron Howard does an excellent job narrating and there are guest stars throughout the series.

I have watched this series 3-4 times now and catch new jokes all the time... the humor is so subtle at times with witty plays on words and dual meanings, puns etc.  It stands the test of time as the series is actually like ten years old.  Classic and funny.",1376352000,,953,4.785276073619632

Every time I watch it, it's a different show due to all the hidden references, easter eggs, and subtle jokes that are so strategically placed. The pacing of the show works well for the the short 22 minute episodes. Jason Bateman was born to play Michael Bluth. I can't imagine anyone else filling these shoes. The entire cast is comprised of some amazing talent. I can't love this show more than I already do.

I can't recommend this show enough.  Also watch out for season 4 coming to Netflix this spring followed by the film (the show was very popular with fans and critics, hence the demand).  Check it out for yourself.",1360454400,,537,4.33
2670725,5,B000JJ3Y78,"My God, this is an awful series.  There's not a realistic character in it, everybody acts like a complete idiot and absolutely nothing is real.  In other words, it's GREAT.

All performances are impeccably and the series' ability to engage the viewer emotionally as well as keeping him laughing is fantastic.  It takes awhile to get into ""Arrested Development"", so don't give up when you're baffled by the first few episodes.  The series has a unique rhythm and style that will capture your heart and get into your head to the point that you'll be craving more.

This is a series about family devotion in the weirdest way possible.  The hero lives in a model home in the middle of nowhere with walls made of cardboard.  His son is in love with his cousin, who is the daughter of a money-hungry dingbat and a goofy former psychiatrist who longs to become an actor.  The hero's dad is in jail for fraud, and his mother has an off-and-on love affair with dad's twin hippie brother.  Absolutely nothing makes sense, but it WORKS.

I would recommend ""Arrested Development"" to anyone whose sense of humor doesn't have a laugh track.  Had a bad day?  Watch ""Arrested Development"".  Everybody on the show's had a worse time than you.",1360454400,,1225,4.663551401869159

I think it sails a bit too close to the edge at times, but I also think it is one of the funniest shows I've seen when it's funny. It's the only show I can recall where I had to regularly rewind it - not because I missed a joke, but because it's actually funnier second time around, the jokes just come so fast that you need a bit of time to savor them! The one part of this DVD set I didn't like was the 'Bloopers': most bloopers are a disappointment to be honest, usually consisting of an actor cracking up, but in this case the Bloopers consist almost entirely of the actors swearing viciously, often in front of the kid actors in the show.

2670748,5,B000JJ3Y78,"I simply cannot describe how much I love this show. From the moment I finished the pilot episode, I was addicted (something I cannot say about any other sitcom that I watch). It may appear ""silly"" or ""stupid"" on your first watch if you're not paying close enough attention, but if you sit down and follow this outrageous family attentively, you'll catch many jokes you probably would have missed otherwise. This makes it perfect to get on DVD.

The acting is phenomenal. Jason Bateman stars as Michael Bluth, one of Bateman's best performances. Michael Cera, a mostly-unknown teenager at the time, set the standard for his future roles to come as George Michael. Will Arnett masterfully plays Michael's wannabe-playboy amateur magician brother Gob. Tony Hale's performance as Buster is so convincing that for a while I actually believed he had the same social/mental problems as his character.

What surprises me each time I go through the series is how often I am reminded of those pure gold moments from classic TV shows (Seinfeld is a good example of these). With Arrested Development, I can honestly say that every episode is pure gold. Every moment event. Every line delivered, facial expression, camera movement; it's impressive to say the least in terms of writing, acting and cinematography.",1353974400,,1299,5.037209302325581

The fans of the show were floored by this decision because they knew how original and funny the series was, but somehow the show managed to pass under the radar of the mainstream success. It wasn't until the DVD box set showed explosive success that Fox realized the mistake they made in pulling the show off the air. This is where Arrested Development currently sits right now. The show passed quickly in and out of the mainstream lime light without much attention. However, the box set is blowing up so quickly that almost everyone I know can quote the show with even more familiarity than Family Guy.

2670777,5,B000JJ3Y78,"There is a lot of subjectivity in liking any TV show, especially comedies.  If you are a fan of irreverent, inappropriate and at times uncomfortable humor you will love this series.  By now most of the people reading this review will have at least some idea of what the show is about.  Ultra dysfunctional family trying to hold on to their riches when the patriarch (played perfectly by Jeffrey Tambor) is thrown in jail for SEC violations.  While the only ""normal"" one in the bunch tries to keep the business going and the family together.

What I loved about the show is that it would make fun of anything and everything.  No topic was off limits, and they definitely pushed the boundaries of what could be put on TV.  It did not rely on a laugh track to tell people when something was funny.  It presumed the audience was smart enough to figure that out on its own.  Ron Howard's narration was one of the best parts of the show.  His quips were always perfectly timed, and set up and/or punctuated the jokes better than any laugh track ever could.

As I said, the humor is not for everyone.  If you like shows like Family Guy, The Office, American Dad and South Park, chances are you will love this show.  Even if you are not a fan of all those shows but are a fan of comedies, then this is definitely one worth giving a try.  I think it says a lot about the show that even after being off the air for years the entire cast is coming back to do the 10 episode season and the movie.  Hopefully those will be popular enough to give the show new life and keep it around even longer.",1346457600,,1582,4.279461279461279
2670778,1,B000JJ3Y78,"My taste may be a bit quirky, but I do know how to laugh and I'm not a snob. For context, over the years I have thought the following were pretty good comedy series, with good writing, good characters, good performances etc: The Honeymooners, Dick Van Dyke, Mary Tyler Moore, Bob Newhart, All in the Family, Maude, MASH, Cheers, The Cosby Show, Seinfeld, Friends, Buffalo Bill, Murphy Brown, Taxi, Married with Children, Soap, Curb Your Enthusiasm. To name a few. My current favorite is Squidbillies (Don't judge it if you haven't watched it). I even like some kid shows. I found PowerPuff Girls and Sponge Bob Square Pants amusing. I liked Ren and Stimpy in small doses.

My favorite comedy series ever, in terms of consistently outstanding writing, characters, and performances would probably be The Simpsons, The Larry Sanders Show, and Seinfeld.

So why can't I seem to find anything to like about the universally beloved Arrested Development? Every time I come back and try to appreciate Arrested Development again, I have the same reaction: What am I missing? The characters seem empty vapid and absolutely one dimensional. They don't behave like people I know. The banter isn't clever, it isn't witty, and it isn't ""smart"". There is no ""there"" there. At the end of the day, it just isn't funny to me. There is nothing I relate to; nothing I want more of.

I feel like it's trying way too hard to achieve the kind of ironic, unsentimental, callous and dark humor that Larry David consistently raised to brilliance, over and over again, in Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm, but for me it never came close to making it in AD.

Please don't tell me I don't get it because my sophistication, intelligence, or sense of humor are dull compared to yours. However, perhaps I have a gene that prevents me from detecting a certain kind of humor. After all, I'm also the only person I know who found the British Office unwatchable.",1344643200,14,1927,4.7604790419161676

2670786,5,B000JJ3Y78,"""Arrested Developement"" is a twistedly funny series with quick and layered humor made way before its time.  This show is funny on so many levels; several jokes will multiple viewings to catch.",1331683200,,192,5.0
2670787,5,B000JJ3Y78,"This show is pure comedic genius. The basic plot is wonderfully simple, yet everything going on around it makes the show whole. The comedic timing is some of the best I have ever seen, and the writing may just be the greatest ever for a TV comedy. This show just works on every possible level. The dialogue is both engaging as well as being the fuel for most jokes. Believe me, if you stop watching for even five minutes, when you return you will have missed a handful of jokes. This is an incredibly smart show, and it's easy to miss something if your not paying full attention. They are constantly throwing references at you, some from earlier episodes, and others from actors' earlier careers(ie: the Fonz). Continuity is also important, so don't watch episodes out of order until you've seen them all before or you'll be lost. You'll watch them again, I promise.

As for the story, in its most basic form it has Michael Bluth as the awaiting heir apparent to his father's construction company, however his dreams become swift and stark reality after his father is arrested for embezzling company funds and using the company as his ""personal piggy bank"". As the responsibility of keeping the company's head above water is thrust onto him, Michael inherits much more than he bargained for. Constantly stressed out and overworked, Michael struggles to maintain his sanity as he deals with the problems of the business and the authorities overseeing his father's case, his family, and his almost non-existent love life. That is the bares bones version of the story, however the depth of the characters is what really makes the story work.

  I honestly believe that Arrested Development is an example of utterly perfect casting across the board, and the on-screen chemistry the characters have is almost as amazing as the show itself. Jason Bateman as Michael is not so much funny as he likable, however his character is not really meant to provide the laughs. He can deliver well, but often times he is much too bewildered by the actions of his family to respond in a comedic way. Overall, Bateman does a great job as the front-man for the entire series. He is the glue that holds the family together, and somehow he manages to do this despite everything he has going against him.

  As Michael tries to keep the family from falling apart, his mother Lucille(Jessica Walter) serves as one of his main obstacles. Walter is as powerful as ever and plays the role to a T. The master manipulator, there is little Lucille won't do in order to get her way. An inflated sense of entitlement paired with her greatest fear, appearing desperate or needy, prove to be the formula for some ridiculous decisions that one could only expect from an aging narcissist.

  That includes controlling ultimate mama's boy Buster, a 30 something socially awkward man-boy who suffers from crippling panic attacks and a desire to greet others with a shoulder rub. He's generally more empathetic than his family members, however his mood can be effected by cheese and juice-boxes. Tony Hale deserves special merit for his performance as Buster, considering the type of character he plays and how extremely successful he was doing it.

  Equally as unique as Buster, but in a different way, Tobias Funke is hands down THE best character on the show. David Cross has to be one of the most underrated comedians out there, and he does a remarkable job playing Tobias.  Absolutely everything, and I mean everything, that comes out of his mouth is sure to incite a laugh. I won't even attempt to go into his character(Tobias pun intended), but the therapist with dreams of the big screen has some of the best lines in the whole series.

  Unfortunately, not everyone appreciates Tobias, particularly his father-in-law George Bluth Sr. As the head of the Bluth family, George Senior(Jeffrey Tambor) is not quite the father figure his children wished he may have been, but his lack of compassion for his kids, and most anyone, is overshadowed only by his absurd incompetence in dealing with the legal system and his enterprise. Tambor also doubles as his twin brother Oscar, the pot smoking beneficiary of handouts who often falls victim to his brother's plans. He appears more in the later seasons but is definitely worth the wait.

  Rounding out the central cast of adults is Gob(pronounced Jobe), Michael's older brother and a career magician. Most of Gob's life revolves around either his magic act, or his current sexual interest(and I say sexual, not love, for a reason). More or less a newcomer, Will Arnett proves his talent by personifying Gob's arrogant and egotistical mindset, that of which provides plenty of the shows predicaments.

  While they may not be adults, you certainly don't need to be an adult to work in show business, as the 3rd youngest studio executive will attest. George Michael and Maeby are practically inseparable, mainly due to the crush each one has on the other, unbeknownst to both of them. Michael Cera's role as George Michael was the fire for his jump to stardom, and Alia Shawkat was brilliant as Maeby, also garnering her attention. This was a stand-out role for both of them, and I am extremely impressed again and again by their talent and chemistry.

 This short summary of the main plot and of pretty much every major character doesn't do the series justice. The characters and story are far more complex than it may seem, and I cannot say enough about the genius of both the writers and the actors who make this show come to life. This truly is a must see, and I promise you, this is not one to miss.

2670837,5,B000JJ3Y78,"But it wasn't buying this DVD set. The above quotation is just one of many from what is a contender for the wittiest, sharpest ensemble cast performance in American television history. That it lasted a mere three seasons is unfortunate; five seasons would have allowed it to really flesh out the multiple story arcs and develop the characters even more fully. To me, just having a secondary character (a lawyer, no less) named ""Bob Loblaw"" encapsulates this show's genius (even better when he creates the ""Bob Loblaw Law Blog""). I'd have a hard time choosing my favorite character, although Gob, Tobias, and Lucille would all be in the running. There isn't a single member of the regular cast who isn't pitch-perfect. One of my favorite episodes was, ""Ready, Aim, Marry Me"" from season two. Some brilliant slapstick work in that one, along with the usual cavalcade of double entendres.

Ahh, the Bluths. Such an awful family... such a marvelous series.

Add another five-star review onto the heap. This series, and this DVD set -- should belong in the library of anyone who appreciates deadpan humor, idiosyncratic personalities, and smart, creative writing in the hands of outstanding character actors. As another reviewer wrote, I'd have to question the taste (and intelligence) of anyone who had really watched this show and didn't like it.",1311984000,,1343,5.045045045045045
2670838,5,B000JJ3Y78,"This is one of the best comedies to grace TV in years. The Bluth family is a perfect creation of an over-the-top dysfunctional family, complete with a convict, a terrible mother, a failed magician, an emotionally stunted soldier, and a never-nude. And that doesn't even include the brilliant side characters. The show is filled with puns, innuendos, double entendres, and amazing dialogue. They writers do a great job of bringing back recurring themes and phrases, and each subsequent viewing will show you more that you missed the first time.

The show held up from start to finish, although the series finale felt like 3 years of plotlines hastily slammed together after the show was going to be canceled. And that says quite a bit, since every episode had a season's worth of twists and turns. The show did a great job of staying true to its offbeat, eccentric style, even as viewership dwindled in the face of more traditional sitcoms.

The amount of recurring guest stars is quite impressive as well, with Liza Minnelli, Martin Short, Charlize Theron, Scott Baio, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and Henry Winkler playing important roles throughout the series. Add to that the star power of the cast, with a career resurrection for Michael Bateman, Emmy nominated Jeffrey Tambor (playing twins), and the launching of Michael Cera's career.

I haven't even perused the extras yet, but even without doing so, this is a heck of a deal.

I guess one of the benefits to Arrested Development's short run is that you can get the complete series in one small set. Although I gladly would have exchanged that for a few more seasons.",1311897600,,1617,4.890510948905109

Pros:
- Perfectly cast. Everyone is hilarious.
- Subtle gags and callbacks and foreshadowing that all demand multiple watches.
- Intelligently written. Never insults the viewer's intelligence. A lot of shows are obvious or cliched or heavy-handed, but this is the most clever and subtle TV show I have ever seen.

Cons:
- Canceled before its time. The last couple episodes are a bit rushed and it lacks a real sense of closure.
- One storyline in season three (involving Rita) could be seen as offensive and in my opinion dragged on too long.
- If you don't like watching a show about oblivious rich white people, certain scenes may get on your nerves.

Overall, this is an absolute must-see.",1310256000,,919,4.73125

2670854,5,B000JJ3Y78,"It's thrown around a lot these days, but this show is literally my favorite comedy show, and I'm someone who likes Seinfeld, The Office (at least the earlier seasons), 30 Rock, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, and I'm sure more.

You've seen all the other positive ratings I'm sure and they're all valid, but for me I'll say that this show is not only hilarious, but brilliant.  When I describe it to my friends, I liken it to a comedy a la LOST... it's a show that rewards the attentive viewer.  There are lots of subtle jokes, or running jokes that may be referencing events not just one or two but even three or more episodes prior. Some of the best lines and jokes aren't given complete focus by the show or by the characters, and without the laugh track it's up to the viewer to catch them.  The jokes come fast and hard, but the intelligent viewer with a good sense of humor will enjoy them immensely.

The characters are simply fantastic, my favorites would be Gob and Tobias (and Lucile as my 3rd), the writing and acting are all crisp and perfect, Ron Howard's uncredited narration is so good it's almost like he becomes a character on the show.  Another often-overlooked trait of the show is the editing... the show is so quick to throw in a tiny sound byte or a quick video feed and it is just perfectly done to reference a joke or something funny that happened.  You'll have to see it to understand but it is just top-knotch.

Lastly, what's great about the complete series pack is that, since this show uses so many running jokes, watching from start to finish is somewhat important.  Also, I don't think anyone would be able to buy and watch only the first season and be satisfied, so buying the whole series lets you save money for your inevitable rest-of-series purchase :).  I haven't met anyone (another possible hyperbole, but it's actually true) who hasn't loved this show.  It is worth the purchase, either as a gift for someone who loves comedy or for yourself. You will not regret it.

2670855,3,B000JJ3Y78,"The first time I tried this show I didn't like it at all. Maybe I was just too tired to appreciate it. Maybe I just needed more time to get used to the characters. Whatever the reason, I was not interested at all. Then I came home and my brothers and sister kept talking about it so like with so many other shows, I figures I would have to try it again.

Arrested Development is about a rich family that falls apart after the father is arrested for numerous misdeeds. In truth, the family was falling apart before that because they're all crazy. There's George Senior, the dad. Oscar, his identical twin brother who is pretty much a bum. Lucille, the mother of the family who is overprotective and overbearing. Gob, the oldest brother who is obsessed with magic tricks. Michael, a single father and the only responsible family member. Michael's socially awkward son George Michael who is overly studious and secretly in love with his cousin. Lindsay is Michael's twin sister (Portia de Rossi), she loves campaigning for causes and is very lazy. Tobias is Lindsay's husband, an ex-psychologist, failing actor, and a never nude (which is exactly what it sounds like). Maybee is Lindsay and Tobias's rebellious and sneaky daughter. There is Buster, the youngest Bluth who is the most developmentally stunted thanks to Lucille's attention. And I suppose we could count Anyong, the Asian boy that Lucille adopted when she wanted to teach Buster a lesson. (Anyong means hi, no one actually knows what his name is.)

Michael is forced to run the company in his father's absence and mistakes. The family has so many financial problems that he has only a staircar (think the stairs for private planes) as transportation but his family seems not to understand this and continues living as though nothing has changed. Lindsay married Tobias in an act of rebellion so their marriage is always iffy.

The comedy is really off-beat, sometimes in your face and sometimes subtle. I think Portia de Rossi is my favorite part of the show (she's fantastic on current show Better Off Ted) and wish there was more of her in the show. Of course, this is the show where we first meet Michael Cera, playing George Michael (so funny to see him so little!!!)

Anyway, if you're looking for a show to watch, this is a great one, especially since there are plans for a movie in the works.",1308614400,2,2360,4.707021791767555

sane one trying to hold things together.

Sort of what you might have gotten if George Bernard Shaw, Kaufman and Hart and Monty Python had teamed up to do
a spin on a traditional sitcom.

The acting is terrific, from top to bottom.  Even producer Ron Howard's narration is great.

Not every joke works, but as it gets weirder and weirder (and funnier and funnier), all I could think is ""how the hell did
they ever get this on network TV?  And thank god they did!""

On re-viewing, I found the first season a little less brilliant, a little more repetitious, but maybe that was because they had
to fill 30+ episodes.  The second season, with only 18 episodes, goes through the roof much more often, with more clever
twists and ideas per episode, and more aggressive weirdness.  And the third season is truly insane (occasionally over-the-top,
but usually successfully), with the addition of elements like Scott Baio's Bob Lawbla character,  and self-referential episodes
like `Save Our Bluths' slyly commenting on the series' coming cancellation - one of the worst mistakes in the history

Arrested Development is a clever, dark comedy which not that many people would get, but luckily, I do.  Arrested Development tells the story of Michael Bluth who needs to keep his family together during tough times when his father goes to jail for a crime he says he didn't commit.  Michael is the normal one in a family of odd-ball characters who consist of: his selfish alcoholic mother Lucille, his clueless and materialistic twin sister Lindsay, Lindsay's psychiatrist turned actor husband Tobias (the funniest character), his magician brother Gob, his mama's boy younger brother Buster and his son George Michael who loves his cousin Maeby.  All 3 seasons are packed with their hilarious antics.  Although, I wish the series finale had a better ending, it was a wonderful series.  Take a look at the family who lost everything and the man who needed to keep them together.

If you want to catch every single joke (because you won't catch everything on the first run-through), you're going to have to watch the series at least one more time through, if not more.

The humor grows on you - there are many running jokes that build as the characters and their relationships develop - and may just seep its way into your daily repertoire.  Jason Bateman plays the perfect fulcrum for the complete out-of-handness of his dysfunctional family as Michael Bluth.  You feel yourself rise and fall with his never-ending dilemma between getting his socially awkward family (and the failed company they depend on) back on their feet and making a new life, free of insanity, for he and his son.  His relatibilty is tempered by the irony that he was reared and raised by the same people he is trying to save.  His supporting cast is a cornucopia of laughs and delightful awkwardness, and no matter how many times the show puts the Bluths on the path to recovery, they are always perfectly capable of ruining the best laid of plans.

While it obviously came after a number of great comedies (from The Honeymooners all the way to Seinfeld), I believe it has taken the art to a new height. It's funny at all levels; slapstick, lowbrow, intellectual, etc., and it extends the role of the narrator as I've never seen before. And it's uncanny how well things tie together, which often just makes for more laughs.

One word of caution if you want to check it out before buying it: don't watch it out of order. Start at the beginning; it's a good enough indicator of things to come, and it's crucial to your enjoyment that you watch the show in order. That said, I don't know if there's a show with higher replay value - I think I actually like it more each time I watch it.

I would, however, recommend finding the first few episodes somewhere and watching them before buying. If you like those, the rest will please you even more.

2671001,5,B000JJ3Y78,"When I bought this three season collection it had been a while since I had seen all of Arrested Development on the air.  It was so refreshing to dive right back into such an incredibly written show.  I think the best quality of the show is the wide range of jokes it employs; from utterly ridiculous slapstick (oh the many chicken dances...) to the long, complex jokes that could only be fully understood by a dedicated viewer.  The subtle self-references allow the parts of the show that don't have you rolling off of the couch to still bring a smile to your face.  On top of that the narration allows for a flexible fourth wall that the show uses in clever ways.

Throughout all of the seasons, towards the end especially, Arrested Development has an incredible pace.  It always amazes me how much is accomplished in each episode, that so many jokes and story arcs could be packed in and intertwined with such perfection.  The final season cranks it up another notch, I assume because of how abruptly it had to come to an end.  Still, the complexity and pacing are extremely rewarding for the dedicated viewer.

My only complaint is that there aren't as many extras as I am used to, but the episodes contain more than enough content to keep you coming back for a long time.  I highly recommend this collection.  You will get a piece of television history.  Memorable characters, an incredibly wild plot, and some of the most finely crafted scripts I have ever witnessed.",1264636800,,1472,4.619230769230769

Picked this up from amazon when it was a goldbox deal. $25 for the entire series seemed like a steal. Now, after watching the entire series, I'm even more excited about my ROI. The series is very refreshing and sometimes it feels like a 20 minute episode runs for 30-40 minutes...so much going on and everything is hilarious. It's amazing how almost the dozen characters get screen time. I suggest watching the episodes in order the first time around. You can feel the plot thickening and the jokes getting funnier as you start relating to the characters.
The first season, episodes 6-15 are a riot..the jokes keep coming and you can't stop laughing. Seasons 2 and 3 are more about the plot. I did think that the series lost some steam with the Charlize Theron episodes but it gets back on track before they decided to end the show.
My favorites are Gob, Tobias and Lindsay. The acting in general is top notch.

I just watched the first two seasons on a rented DVD and I was disappointed for the most part, had really high expectations based on the reviews everywhere. I believe this is one of the most overrated network show around. As for the show...Tobias, Michael, and George-Michael were the only characters who had really clever writing/delivery, most of the other characters have lame/predictable writing and any comedy from them is silly 90% of the time. Especially Will A.(Gob); he relied on outlandish delivery to be funny. I blame most of it on writing for his character. Also the Buster and Michael's parents are NOT FUNNY AT ALL! Especially the Buster guy, he was quite annoying. There is an amateurish feel to the show and the writing is inconsistent across most shows (some scenes are really funny and others are dull, boring, and totally predictable once you know the characters). It seems like the show has a cult following by now so this review will not sit well with those who rate it highly, but honestly there is no way this should be more than a 7/10. This is just my opinion, this should not make the show any better or worse for you. It is just one opinion. I would say if you have not watched it at all, don't expect too much from it, its good but not great.

This is easily a contender for my favorite show of all-time, and that's going up against some pretty heavy competition. I have never watched an episode of Arrested Development and failed to laugh out loud, even on the Nth viewing. The amount of skill and imagination that went into this show is unparalleled in the comedy genre and rarely matched even by more serious and ambitious titles. It's as close to perfect as I have seen and ideal to own, since it stands up beautifully to repeated viewings.

You have to appreciate the relentless barrage of jokes -- which land successfully far more often than not, and are a universe smarter and more subtle than other nonstop comedies like Airplane or the Naked Gun (not that there's anything wrong with them, it's just a whole different ballgame here). Any one of these characters might be a disaster on any other show -- here's they meld together like shots in a Long Island Ice Tea -- so carefully blended that you don't even realize how hammered you're getting.

It was criminal that Arrested Development got canceled after only three seasons. Looking forward to the movie, and hopefully a renewed life on the tube...",1260144000,2,1297,4.7555555555555555

for example.  Henry winkler is walking along a boat doc in one episode and he has to jump over a small fish lying across his path.  A quick glimpes from another angle reveals it to be a small shark.  It doesnt seem like much, but it is an allusion to the last episode of ""Happy Days"" in which Henry WInkler as ""The Fonz""  jumps over a shark in his motorcyle in front of Al's diner.

The series is just chock full of excellent humor...and they did it on such an obviously low production budget, that it inspires you to believe that good, original, TV can still be made.

I proudly display my dvd set atop my entertainment center.  it plus Firefly are the only series that I don't keep locked away in a closet...I am just hoping that my guests ask me about it because I can't help but want to share the joy.

2671029,5,B000JJ3Y78,"The title is no exaggeration, this truly is the greatest sitcom to ever grace TV.  Just like Seinfeld was so far above any other 90s sitcom, this show has dwarfed every comedy of the past decade.  There are some great shows on today, like 30 Rock (which, to me, is sort of a mini-AD), The Office (although it's has been declining in quality in the past 2 years), and Always Sunny, but none of these are on the same level as AD.

The incredible attention to detail on AD is mind-blowing.  Upon repeated viewing, subtle running jokes become noticeable (yet never feel repetitive), soft spoken lines which add immensely to each scene can be heard, and brilliant foreshadowing that reveals major plot twists become obvious and you are left kicking yourself for not picking them up initially.  But, then again, no other sitcom has ever required your full attention like this one does.

And that is most likely the reason why it was canceled.  If you look at any CBS comedy, for instance, they all follow a here's-the-setup-to-a-painfully-obvious-and-unfunny-punchline formula (the fact that Two and a Half Men is the #1 comedy in America is truly disturbing).  No, this show requires you to watch the episodes attently and sequentially in order to fully ""get it"".  It sounds like a chore, but it is completely worth it.

These are three of the best seasons of any TV show ever.  In a way, I'm glad it ran for only three seasons.  It never felt like it was overstaying it's welcome (unlike The Office now).  I will be first in line the movie, though.",1254182400,2,1544,4.674074074074074

If you are like me and you watch shows that are funny and you think they are funny and thoroughly enjoy them, but don't really laugh much get ready to be surprised. I have NEVER laughed out loud more for any TV program. It is the most most hilarious thing ever. If you even just start thinking about some of the shows gags or running jokes you will start to chuckle. Speaking of which this show has some of the best running jokes and quotes/catchphrases... you will want to imitate in real life. Pretty much everybody who has watched the show, when they talk about it you hear things like 'best TV show ever' or 'funniest show on TV' and if you watch it you will become one of those people.

As for the DVD features its pretty much just bare bones, you have your standard fare commentary and deleted scenes, but nothing spectacular. Also the price to buy them all together doesn't make sense. Amazon used to have it priced around $40-$50 and now its $80? Well if you just buy each DVD separately... from amazon even... you will save about half that, so...

Anyway, I fully recommend this show to anyone who likes to laugh and enjoy themselves.

The subtleties you can pick up on is ridiculous, the dialogue and delivery is always immaculate, every character is lovable in their own way, and I just can't get enough of this show.

2671035,5,B000JJ3Y78,"Lots of Americans grew up in family businesses.  I was one of them and I think running your own business does build a certain kind of insanity through the family.  No one epitomizes this better than the beleaguered Bluth family. Michael Bluth (Jason Bateman) is that one sane one whereas his mother, his brothers, his sister, et al, swirl around him pursuing their own best interests (never anyone else's best interests and certainly not the family business's best interest).  Ron Howard who produced the show also narrates it and does a wonderful job of it. The business is tanking in the wake of the senior Bluth's (the pater familias) financial wrongdoing within the firm.

The biggest discovery for me on this show was Michael's lothario older brother played by Will Arnett.  I have been tuning in Will Arnett ever since this show and he is funny in everything I see.  I had never seen him before this show.  Most recently I saw him vie with Alec Baldwin's Jack on 30 ROCK for NBC's CEO position. He played a gay corporate type to perfection.

I loved Jeffrey Tambor on LARRY SANDERS so was glad to see him playing the pater familias and his twin brother Oscar.  Tambor always brings a level of inept smarminess to his semi villainous characters.  They don't ever quite make it to being villains because he is always shooting himself in the foot as he tries to pull off a nefarious act.  His character is in prison in this series and he is particularly self absorbed yet bumbling from there. if the father is  smarmy, the mother, played by Jessica Walter, is the ultimate as the matriarch with a thousand schemes afoot, all to promote her own best interests.  She takes manipulative to a whole new level.

Portia DeRossi plays Michael's greedy twin sister.  She is good but it is her sexually waffling husband (David Cross) who is the character to watch.  One of his many baffling but hilarious acts is to leave his career as a psychiatrist to become an actor.

This was a very funny show which I totally enjoyed.  HBO did it again, of course.

2671036,5,B000JJ3Y78,"Granted, my television show tastes veer more toward the obscure, or even bizarre, but 'Arrested Development' fits neatly into my scheme of things. This is already an old show, off the air for a while now, but the cult following it has amassed is just astounding. Just like there are so many viewers who do not at all understand the appeal of ""Seinfeld"", this show may or may not work for you. Its an acquired taste, and unfortunately, many many people I have introduced this show to have been underwhelmed and decidedly bored by it.

This is in part, justified. The pacing is slow, the entire enterprise is strictly dialog-driven, and the humor is always filled with double entendres and is almost always on the darker side of things. Which is why its a bonafide masterpiece. This 3-season set collects all seasons of the short-lived show (3 Discs for Season 1, 3 Discs for Season 2, 2 Discs for Season 3).

Jason Bateman, in the role of a lifetime, plays the central figure, who despite being saddled with the strangest family around, eventually starts displaying his own strange and bizarre characteristics. This is a dysfunctional family to the max, with twists and turns at every corner. Everyone is self-absorbed to the n'th degree, with hardly room for any sentiment or emotion. Portia DeRossi excels in her performance here, as her icy, cool visage is offset with some truly mind-numbing lines to spout - later in career she would display similar attributes in ""Better off Ted"", but this remains her best role to date.

""Arrested Development"" is about warped family dynamics, yes, but its also about creating a show that one can watch time and time again. The only two shows that have lured me in repeatedly are ""The Jeffersons"" and ""The Golden Girls"", primarily due to their stellar script and their undeniable repeat value. This show is right up there in terms of screenwriting, and memorable one-liners litter almost every episode. Its' hand-held camera technique may be offputting for some, but if you could get used to ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"" or even ""Friday Night Lights"", there is no reason why you won't be able to savor this.

For viewers who are late to the party, this is the perfect way to collect all three seasons of this show. Its not a must-buy, but an investment that will pay you back richly in the years to come. Of all shows that I could recommend you buy entire season-packs of, ""Arrested Development"" comes in first. A masterpiece of the pen, this is easily one of the classiest shows (other than ""Frasier"") to grace the small screen.

The writers did a lot to emulate the pilot and i think it was effective in providing the show a good send off not that it deserved to be canceled!

2671077,5,B000JJ3Y78,"I am so glad I finally got this. I was sad when I learned that they weren't going to make a season 4!  Perhaps it's best to quit while you're ahead! This show tells the story of a formerly-rich family who loses everything when the father goes to prison.  The problem is, the family keeps trying live like they're still rich.  Jason Bateman, playing Michael Bluth, is the only one trying to keep the family from utter disaster, while they all live in a model home on a development that had to stop being developed (a dry wasteland at the moment#.  Crazy stuff happens every episode that leaves me in stitches at the end. Some of the old Happy Days actors #Scott Baio, Henry Winkler# make appearances.  My favorite is Bob Loblaw #say it out loud# the attorney played by Baio.  While I was in grad school, I used to plan my schedule around Arrested Development because it satisfies my need to laugh at something absurd. It is beautifully-orchestrated insanity. Ron Howard's dry, deadpan voice narrates each episode. Finally I can catch up on those few episodes that I had to miss. This is a set of videos that I can watch over and over again, and I rarely purchase television series' on DVD. Also hilarious are Lindsay #Portia de Rossi#, Michael's twin sister with a love for political activism but also a love for high fashion, George Michael, Michael's son who has a crush on his cousin, Maebye #I don't remember the spelling, but it's pronounced Maybe# who is a con artist teenager, leading a double life as a movie producer in Hollywood, G.O.B. #played by Will Arnett#, brother to Michael, a magician who seems to have repeated troubles with his trick animals, and another brother of Michael who ends up losing his hand to one of G.O.B.'s trick seals, named Lucille.  There are 3 Lucilles in the show, including the mom, her arch rival #played by Liza Minelli# and the seal.  Just trying to explain this show to somene else makes me laugh.  By the way, the price for the amount of stress relief you will get from this is way worth it.  There are some other fun extras on the DVD, but not much. You won't care anyways.",1234483200,,2118,4.535433070866142

I watched the entire series on hulu within a couple of weeks, then decided to try to support whoever still benefits from the show by buying the dvds. I'm not sure if I did that through amazon, but I hope so. I imagine Michael Cera now has 12 more cents to pay for flowers for his garden. I hope the movie happens, or I'll cry tears that will nourish the flowers of Ron Howard's windowsill.  There is no show with an intelligence level close to Arrested Development, including the Office.

I watched the first couple of episodes and thought they were okay, but weren't the rave everyone commented about.  But then as I watched the next few, the show really grew on me.  The combination of narration and film clips worked great.  The comedy ranges from prop-gags to intellectual humor - all stacked on each other to the point you will probably miss some of it the first time around.  Others have already discussed the show in detail, so all I can say is they were right - it is a great series.  If you haven't seen this series, get the full three-year set.

It wasn't until maybe a year or so ago when a co-worker with similar interests let me borrow season 1. It was hilarious! I have since gone on to buy all 3 seasons and now I recommend this show to anyone who will listen. The dialog in this show is great. It has to be one of the best written comedies ever.

Some people don't get the humor. It's dry, like the Office. And like the Office the jokes aren't punchline-type jokes with a studio audience letting you know what's funny and what's not. It's entirely up to you. And a great thing about the show is you can watch episodes again in the future and hear something you may have missed the first time around. This show is constantly ""on"".

And the more I watch, the more I realize that Michael is probably the most dysfunctional of all...and it just makes it funnier.
Great acting by everyone involved (Will Arnett, Henry Winkler, etc.) and such cutting edge comedy that was on Sunday nights...
The only disappointment was in Disc 1, when they showed an unbleeped version of the show--sure, you knew what they were saying the whole time, but the bleeping, like on South Park, was funny in the way of, ""Omigosh, I can't believe they said that!""

2671186,5,B000JJ3Y78,"I wholeheartedly agree with all of the rave reviews, but I would throw in a word of warning if you have never seen the show: for all its brilliance, this is a very particular kind of comedy. It is savage, it is filthy, it is sacrilegious, it is stridently political, and the characters mostly evince hatred and/or pity.

I love this show, I think it is the greatest TV program ever to air, but I can also understand why it couldn't pick up the kind of audience that keeps so many stupid sitcoms on the air for years and years. Watching Season 3 on DVD, with its many hilarious anti-Iraq War riffs, I wondered how Fox even let them put the show on the air at all during that jingoistic period of our history.

The people who love this show are the ones who see this as a recommendation rather than a warning. If you might be offended by sodomy, drug use, incest, or cheesy magic acts this isn't the show for you. Otherwise, buy it and watch it over and over!",1229385600,,957,4.252747252747253
2671187,5,B000JJ3Y78,"i've been a fan of this show since the very beginning.  now that it's been over, i've been trying to find another sitcom to take its place.  but nothing fits the bill.  i've been told to watch ""it's always sunny in philadelphia,"" but i think it's just crude, college humor, not the witty, smart humor i loved from Arrested Development.  so, until something tickles my tv bone, i'm stuck with history channel, discovery channel, and the likes.  but i always remember: ""somewhere over the rainbow, there's another rainbow...""",1229385600,,523,4.8977272727272725
2671188,5,B000JJ3Y78,"I already own the entire series on DVD but it makes me angry that this is only @8 bucks right now.  I paid like 60-70 bucks for each one seperately!  Well, I will say this is one of my personal favorite shows to watch.  Because its funny, witty and the characters like GOB, Michael, and Buster are hilarious.

The best part about buying DVD's and creating a collection is finding a show or movie that reveals a little more to you each time you watch it.  When I go back to watch some episodes, if you listen well, Michael is the funniest character to watch.  He has smart and sarcastic comments in every episode.  Or Tobias, the world's first analrapist (combination of analyst and therapist), who makes the most unsettling comments throughout the show.

Bottomline, if you enjoy comedy like Curb Your Enthusiasm, Family Guy, or Seinfeld, this is a great show to watch for the first time or enjoy again in your home.",1229385600,,916,4.5426829268292686

Do yourself a favor and rent or buy the series, I guarantee you will love it. If you like funny smart comedy this show is for you. The show went off the air 6-7 seasons before it should have. I never watched an episode while it was on the the air because I did not know about it. I found it on netflix and was hooked instantly.

Releasing an entire television series on DVD is genius on one hand, because it allows for people who missed out to marathon through some genuine television platinum.

It has gone out on a major high like The Office etc. I think this show would have got treated better on a cable network but nevertheless we should thank our lucky stars that it exists. I never get tired of watching this show. I love great sitcoms like Seinfeld, Curb your enthusiasm, Simpsons but there's something about this show that puts it in a different league. Mitchell Huriwitz I think is very underrated in how strong and amazing his writing and vision was for this show. I don't think there has been such dense writing in a comedic sitcom before. I would be suprised if there ever would be in a live action sitcom. I hope the movie carries this legacy.",1229040000,,811,4.413333333333333

Do yourself a huge favor... if you're considering this, just rent Season 1, Disc 1 from your local movie store.  Watch the whole disc.  I don't have any doubt that you'll love it.

The writing for this show was genius, and the cast is perfect.  I've probably watched this series 4 or 5 times through.  Either I'm a loser or it's that good.  You are entitled to think either of me, but it is still funny every time.

I was devastated when they announced that the show was going off air and ending.  I'll never understand why Arrested Development only stuck around for 3 seasons, but I'll always cherish this set.

I wasn't going to write a review for this, but I just had to toss in a 5-star rating because this show deserves it.  I'll say it again - BEST SERIES EVER!",1228521600,2,922,4.358823529411764

I found myself saying just one more episode and then proceeding to watch multiple more. Therefore I started to look for it on DVD and found Amazon offering it at such an amazing price and just could not pass on it. I was disappointed in the quality that I received mine in (Season 2's protective cover was crinkled and one of the cases plastic sleeves was cut allowing the paper cover to come out) but for me I am just happy I have this great series so I can finally see how it all ends and share it with family and friends.

I wasn't lucky enough to see it when it was on television but after seeing it it makes me question why this isn't on television when you have some shows on tv today. I hope they make a movie like it is rumored because for me it would be a must see. If you are on the fence about getting this product go check out Hulu and watch a couple episodes, it will make you want the rest.",1227657600,2,1004,4.096446700507614

What makes Arrested Development amazing are the dynamics between so many seemingly dissident family members who can at the same time, leave no doubt in your mind that they are quite complimentary. Every viewer can find parts of himself or herself in the characters on the show. Soon, the inside jokes in the series will become inside jokes for you and your friends too.

The more you watch Arrested Development, the more you will enjoy it because there are great nuances and amazing situational comedy supplemented by a cast of loonies and jokesters. You may even wish that you grew up a Bluth! Well, probably not.",1225411200,,721,4.814516129032258

Now normally I'm not a big fan of TV series, but I guess this was just an awesome show that lost everything and had no choice but to box up all three seasons together. It's Arrested... No, seriously, A.D.'s complex, cleverly crafted wit grows on you with multiple viewings, so I would certainly suggest fans own it on DVD. It's unique style and memorable characters are entirely its own, but those who like the likes of the Office or 30 Rock might find this right up their ally. Hats off to Hurwitz, Howard, and all the actors for pulling off some masterfully crafted, too-good-to-last entertainment before it's development was finally arrested.",1224547200,,677,4.844827586206897

It s honestly one of the most funny shows I have ever seen. It has a type of dry, intelligent humor rarely seen on American television. All the characters seem so well-rounded and I actually care about all their storylines. The show is intriguing, interesting, and really wonderful. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a break from the run-of-the-mill sitcom.

Over the course of watching the series, I found myself becoming attached to the characters and their storylines. The dialouge is so well-written and the storylines so well-crafted and fast-paced - it makes the show an utter delight to watch.

Sad that as cutting edge as Fox claims to be that they canceled this show.  What's worse is that no one picked them up.  I supposed the fault goes to the American public for not giving it the viewership it deserved and needed to keep going.

Anyways, you should not be disappointed if you buy this show.  I converted it for my iphone and carry at least 1 season loaded on it at any given time.",1223683200,3,494,4.104166666666667

2671234,5,B000JJ3Y78,"Arrested Development was one of those shows that I missed during its original run on TV.  I watched the pilot episode and instantly got hooked.  I loved the show so much that it made me write my first ever review on amazon.com to tell the world about the existence of this underrated gem.

As the narrator (Ron Howard) describes the show, it's ""the story of a wealthy family who lost everything and the one son who had no choice but the keep them all together.""  The writing is smart and funny, the actors have great chemistry and acted out the characters to perfection.  This is not your average sit-com.  It has shot straight up to the top of my list of favorite shows.  I have yet to show this to someone who did not enjoy it.  Every episode is laugh out loud funny, not just once, but it will probably make you belly-laugh a few times per episode.  Every episode is packed with funny situations and jokes but it also manages to have a little heart in each one.

It's one of the best shows no one ever saw, but trust me when I say you're missing out if you haven't seen this instant classic.  This is truly worth the purchase and deserves a spot in every DVD library.  Don't take my word for it, go see for yourself.",1222819200,,1219,4.275109170305677

brilliant.

I mean, seriously.
This is a show that will keep you laughing with every single viewing.
The actors are cast PERFECTLY! This show launched the careers of Will Arnett and Michael ""Superbad"" Cera. David Cross and Tony Hale are hilarious. Jason Bateman perfectly ties all the characters together. Jeffery Tambor is great as George Sr. Jessica Walters is outstanding. I could continue to list each and every actor and actress that was a part of this show, but that would take too long, because I can not honestly think of one bad actor on this show.
Oh, and the secondary characters are just as brilliant (i.e. Henry Winkler)...
The writing is some of the best, most constant writing ever on television.

Why, oh why, America, couldn't you have watched this show? There was still so much story to be told.
FOX ""made a huge mistake"".

I can understand something like Twin Peaks (though my favourite series) being dropped, but surely Arrested Development should have had everything to hold a big audience. How low should a series go to ensure survival? Would it have helped if they put in canned laughter?

This show is the funniest thing you will ever see.  Jason Bateman plays the straight man to his crazy family: Will Arnett is the entitled older brother who refused to admit that he sucks as a magician; Portia DiRossi plays the twin sister who throws benefits for good causes all the time, but is really too shallow to care about anything but herself; David Cross is Bateman's brother-in-law, and he is a Never Nude (which is just what it sounds like); and Michael Cera is the hilariously awkward son who is in love with his cousin.  This great ensemble cast is only heightened by the many celebrity cameos and Ron Howard's hillarious narration.

A brilliant ensemble cast combined with the hilariously deadpan narration of Ron Howard, guest spots by Henry Winkler and Liza Minelli (who both seem at the top of their game here) and consistently hilarious scripts, direction and stories - this was a show which defined, in my opinion, how a sitcom should be made. Jason Bateman may never equal his brilliant work here. Michael Cera (pre-Juno), who was at the beginning of his career here, showed what a talent he truly is. I recommend all three seasons. The show ended before it really caught on, which in hindsight, might have been a good thing, since it may have lost its edge if it continued (however Showtime offered and producer Mitchell Hurwitz declined, thinking they may have ended at the right time).

2671328,5,B000JJ3Y78,"It's that time once again, faithful readers. Time to stop attacking the wretched dross available on this site and embrace the very best things that makes The Curmudgeon NOT wish hot, burning death on everyone on the planet. In short - its a time of celebration. And hey - YOU'RE invited.

When talking about something you like, its all too easy to get caught up in hyperbole, so that something pretty good gets described as The Best Thing Ever or something along those lines. The Curmudgeon is not guilty of this, obviously, but check out any number of reviews by some of the knuckle-draggers on this very site, and you'll see what I mean.

But all the hype, all the praise and, yes, all the hyperbole, for THIS show, for this wonderfully written, expertly directed, magnificently cast show, is totally justified.

It's rare to find a sitcom that doesn't actually warrant repeat viewings, but actually improves with them. There is SO much depth, so many in-jokes, sly background gags and recurring gags you have to have seen every episode at least four times before you've caught up with the writers, not to mention checking Wikipedia for stuff you may have missed. It's just THAT good.

Normally there's a sitcom where there are a few characters that get the laughs and the rest are padding/straight men, but with Arrested everyone is funny. From Gob's pathetic magic act and desperation to be accepted from his dad, to Michael Bluth, who's under-the-breath comments often make for the funniest lines in the show.

Everything about this Arrested Development just WORKS. The cutting satire aimed at the media (and the TV networks), the spot-on physical slapstick (David Cross's Tobias is a masterpiece of awkwardness, with some genuinely painful looking falls, slips and trips), the razor sharp script, the endlessly inventive, often surreal humour and of course the acting - every actor, from the main stars to the crop of guest stars - are both perfectly cast and acted.

Basically - it's a joy to watch.

It's so good in fact, that it got cancelled half way through its third season.

It's hard to fathom the rank, bewildering stupidity of not only the network for cancelling it (the ratings WERE poor) but the moronic audiences sitting at home that this fantastic show was obviously too CLEVER for. What? A comedy? With no canned laughter? No will-they-won't they relationships (that don't involve teenage cousins)? No overly obvious jokes? Something that you have to think about while you watch? Something you can't sit and text your friends while its on? Who wants to watch THAT?

And you know what Arrested Development got replaced by? Skating With Celebrities. God, I wish I was making that up. But no - the truth is always more depressing and devastating than fiction. And so a reality show with some dead-eyed, coke snorting z-list cretins is YOUR replacement for, and here's the truth, quite possibly the Best Sitcom - EVER.

But you know what? This review is a celebration, so let's not end on a low note. But, really, how DO you end on a high note when a show like this is canned and replaced by idiot-fodder?

Well, Thank God that an audience with intelligence, an attention span and a love for quality television embraced this show. Thank God that the DVDs sold well because Arrested Development: The Movie, with the original cast, writers and directors, is well into production. Happy endings are rare here in The Curmudgeon's reviews - but this could turn out to be an ecstatic one.

And that, good reader, is Part One in my list of the great and the good. But what could possibly be up next? Only one way to find out..",1210377600,6,3636,4.781499202551834

Dysfunctional has never been done so well and with such tremendous acting. Ron Howard's narration is the perfect compliment to the show.

i love it because it has a great cast, the jokes/style/senses of humour are very different and quite avant-garde comparing to the main stream sit-com on TV. the filming was done more like a drama, which is above par. there is a story, a plot and all that instead of random jokes, but i guess it might be a lil deep, perhaps difficult for the general public to understand and accept its format. Ron Howard is right about making a movie outta it, and i sincerely hope there is a movie film and i'm very willing to spend $15 to go see Will Arnett, the dangerous cousins, Lucille, Oscar and the rest of the Bluth's family.

At different times,the show begins to focus on different characters for different directions in the show. Whenever this happens, it is so seamless, the transitions are so natural and the timing is perfect. Gob, Buster, Tobias, George Michael, Maybee the rest of the characters have such independent personalities. The absurdity of it all is  so original. Now that rumours of an AD movie are around, I'm becoming more and more excited. If you have a chance to catch this show, watch it! The show is one of my favourites.",1206921600,,766,5.071428571428571

Once you get to know the characters... say an episode or 2... you'll find that every second is a joke... every line is funny and is a setup for something else hillarious down the line.  The only reason it gets 4 stars is cuz the show got cut too short... not really the shows fault I guess.

If you've never experienced Arrested Development you're truly missing out.  This show had a SUPER talented cast, a quick pace, outrageous storylines, and Ron Howard as the narrator! I strongly urge you to buy all three seasons and pop them in immediately, you won't regret it.  You'll want to watch them all without stopping...trust me!

I had heard good things and, being a typical quote buff, went online to find some funny quotes. I stumbled across Arrested Development quotes and had to stop reading because I was laughing so hard. I decided, rather than reading any more quotes and spoiling it, to go ahead and buy all 3 seasons since Amazon was selling them for such a good price. I was not disappointed for one second. Arrested Development delivered such a quality, smart, and edgy humor that is tough to find in TV shows today. From Gob's ""huge mistakes"" to Maeby's ""marry me's"", you will find yourself laughing so hard you cry almost frequently throughout each episode. This was a must buy for me!",1206489600,,794,4.482758620689655

I don't want to get too in depth with this review but I'll say Season 2 of the show is the best and that you won't be disappointed if you buy this complete series set.
Do it now!
I really hope they make the ""Arrested Development"" movie in 2009 as well!!

For example, if you loathe smiles, and feast on gloom like some sort of Care-Bears villain, this show may not be for you.

If laughter makes you soil yourself uncontrollably, then this show may not be for you.

If talented actors working with stellar writers weaving a myriad layered comedy that can be endlessly watched without losing value is something that enrages or depresses you, then this show may not be for you.

It was under 100 episodes and non-syndicated, but word of mouth got out and the show has had booming sales, which i also think Micheal Cera's recent booms in the box office (Superbad and Juno) Helped the cause, not to mention Jason Bateman (also appeared in Juno, The Ex with Zach Braff and a hilarious Cameo as an ESPN announcer in Dodgeball on the ""ocho"") is a great talent that brought this show along way. I could go all day about the cast, but I'll let you all formulate your own opinions on the cast (Will Arnett and David Cross are comical geniuses ha!).

That being said, I just couldn't wait in the case of Arrested Development.  Two of the three boxes have jackets (not sure if that's the right word) that slip over them just waiting to be lost and broken.  Two of the seasons have individual cases for each dvd which make for a whole bunk of packaging per disk...

But still, it's all worth it to see the glorious faces of the Bluth family... Undoubtedly I'll upgrade to the single container if the chance to ever arises.",1203811200,,1277,6.358381502890174

2671428,5,B000JJ3Y78,"It really is a shame that this show was canceled, but at least Fox had sense enough to release it on DVD. For three seasons, the Bluth family was entertaining and awkward in the best way. Every episode is hysterical, and the performances are priceless. Tobias Funke (David Cross) is worth the price for these seasons alone. He prances around as a nevernude, wearing jean cutoff shorts underneath all of his clothes, and saying things like ""I blue myself."" If you're a Michael Cera fan, you cannot miss him in this show. He is George Michael (not the singer-songwriter) Bluth and he is as awkward as ever and in love with his cousin, which makes for pretty great moments.
This DVD set comes with great extra features: an unaired directors cut of the pilot (longer and with no editing of the swearing), deleted scenes for nearly every episode, hilarious commentaries the entire cast took part in, interviews, TV spots and even their appearance on the TV Land awards. The special features are great, and worth watching, definitely.

The last thing I can say is that this show is definitely worth whatever you have to pay for it, and it should be watched in one sitting, if possible, because you won't want to tear yourself away.",1203206400,,1225,4.6976744186046515

Watching the series as a whole was far more enjoyable than I might have predicted.

The jokes are layered, oftentimes subtle, and can take episodes or whole seasons to unfold. In a world littered with the likes of Mad TV, Frank TV, and Dane Cook, it is a pleasure to watch a show that cherishes and acknowledges the viewer's intelligence, instead of insulting it.

It was the best money I've ever spent on DVDs.  And I completely assure you - IT IS ALL TRUE.  No show has ever made me laugh out loud as much as Arrested Development.  If I'm completely honest with myself, and have to acknowledge that it's the funniest and most original comedy I've ever seen - overshadowing even such favorites as Seinfeld and others.  This blows the traditional 90s sitcoms out of the water - no laugh tracks necessary here.  I blew through this entire set in a couple short weeks, and I'm left wanting more - much much more.  But I know that they will have a high replay value - the jokes are so dense and many packed in so subtly that there is plenty to pick up the second time around.

Finally, I must implore you to buy these DVDs if you love this show or are even just curious.  I know that many of us like to download TV show episodes through torrents, etc., but you've got to support this show.  If huge DVD sales were enough to bring back Family Guy, it can happen with Arrested Development too.  Every purchase is a vote for this show to return, demonstrating the huge audience out there.

There is so much subtle humour throughout that it is easy to miss one little moment that will crack you up the second time around - so it is so worth owning the boxset. The main reason this show never caught on is because you actually have to sit and pay attention to get alot of the humour, you can't tune in mid-way to an episode and watch while writing emails.

2671459,5,B000JJ3Y78,"I purchased this on a whim when the writer's strike started.  Although I had always read that it was the ""funniest show nobody was watching"" when it was actually on TV, I never watched it.  I usually watch The Office, but I received a suggestion to start watching Arrested Development.  One morning, I saw it on sale for $30 for all three seasons, which was cheaper than season 3 of The Office alone, so I bought it.

It probably is one of the greatest purchases I have ever made - I took a whole week and watched all 53 episodes.  The writing is simply genius and the premise is utterly ridiculous, but it's the little things about this show that make it amazing.  I won't say too much, but I thought that one the most unique things about this show is that if something happens to the house (breakage), you can see the remnants of said destruction in future episodes.  Everything builds on everything else, and while it was unfortunate to see Arrested Development canceled, everything fit in just right.  However, I wouldn't argue another season or two if they opted to do so.

Particularly under-the-radar is Michael Cera, who is able to masterfully pull off a nervous, dry-sarcastic humor that is rare to find.

2671525,5,B000JJ3Y78,"Arrested development is the complete package.  This is one of the funniest shows to ever grace the small screen.  The writers are at the top of their class.  The cast members were all a perfect complement for each other.  Many of the actors have grown to become big names (or possibly bigger names) after arrested development and for good reason.  Cast members include Jason Bateman, Michael Cera, Portia de Rossi, David Cross, Will Arnett, Jeffery Tambor, Jessica Walter, Tony Hale, and many more on a regular or reoccurring basis.

The show was narrated by none other than Ron Howard.  Unlike most modern comedies, where a laugh track informs the viewer when something funny was happening, Howard's narration provided the ideal punctuation for their specific brand of humor.  Howard's narration would come in at the perfect moment stating the obvious, arguing with or otherwise refuting dialog, reminding the viewer of something that had happened previously, or foreshadowing the future.  The very frank and honest tone of Howard's voice only added to the humorous effect of the narrator's wisdom.

Arrested development is best appreciated as a whole.  If you only caught occasional episodes, you probably would have missed out on most of the key jokes.  Jokes and memes were often revisited repeatedly over the course of the show.  Others were constructed slowly over the course of multiple episodes or even entire seasons.  Sometimes it felt like the writers would bide their time, waiting for the perfect moment to reveal the one punch line that a number of other jokes were building towards (""Has anyone in this family ever seen a real chicken?"").

The odd way that jokes are constructed and reused (often in passing) leads to a show that does not suffer from repeated viewings.  Every time you watch an episode from arrested development you are going to catch jokes or references that you might have missed in previous viewings.

Not everyone is going to like arrested development, although the ratings show that most people do.  For lesser writers and actors, the topics that they frequently turned into jokes would come across as mildly offensive under the best circumstances (and in the worst it could easily be crude and obnoxious).  Fortunately, even the worst jokes make during the show were laugh out loud funny.  The writers for arrested development never pulled their punches, and never found a topic that was too taboo to approach.  Reoccurring jokes include racism, sexism, incest, homosexuality, cross dressing, mental retardation, open marriages, politics, treason, religion, mental illness, and just about anything else that you could conceive.

Arrested development is a true gem, and many of the show's fans were excited to hear that the show would be revisited for a fourth season that culminated in an arrested development movie.",1197504000,,2854,5.132034632034632

There is a fair amount of physical comedy too, especially in the 2nd and 3rd seasons. The characters are GREAT! The acting is awesome! The cast works really well together. There are so many jokes crammed into the show that you'll really only catch them all on your second or third time through, which is why its so great to have them on DVD.

However, I do feel that this show is just so good that it is necessary for me to express my great love for it.  The writing is immaculate, the characters are intriguing and deep, and the actors that portray them are unbelievably talented and breathtakingly hilarious.  Look for David Cross(Tobias) and Tony Hale(Buster) as being the most hysterical on the show.  Though all the other actors are not even a stride behind.  Even the part time characters on the show bring an unbelievable element to it.  See Martin Short as Uncle Jack whose character will have you gasping for air in between your hysterical laughing.

2671568,5,B000JJ3Y78,"Arrested Development was easily the best thing to hit t.v. since color.  This was always the show i made sure to watch no matter what.  Every episode was halarious throughout from the opening to the credits. This being thanks to using wit and each of the perfectly casted character's with very different and utterly distinctive morals and values interacting, instead of one liners which most sitcoms use.  You'll find yourself laughing out loud time after time again in just one episode.  And even if you did miss an episode or two or just watching mid-season for the first time you'd be wholly entertained.  But the real laughs come from watching each episode back to back going through every twist in the ironic and ""out-there"" plot line which blend together in an insanly halarious story.  How ever many times you laughed or how much you where entertained by this show, you'll be laughing twice as much and immensly more entertained  thanks to all the things you didn't catch the first time.  So even if you did watch it while it was on air (Can anyone explain exactly why it's not anymore?), and liked it, but don't think you liked it enough to get every season on dvd then do yourself a favor and get this now.  You will miss out on one of the funniest show's with one of the most halarious plots of all time by not watching every episode all the way through and getting the complete experience.",1190505600,,1400,4.590361445783133

This explains why Friends was ever on the air. Unfortunately I too was a part of this demographic. I did not like arrested development when it was on television. I couldn't see what all the fuss was about. Therein lies the problem, it was too good for tv. This show is meant to be watched in order for hours at a time. The writing was so dense, the comedy so layered that a viewer can't afford to skip a show and expect to get laughs. It wasn't until around a year ago that someone sat me down and told me to watch the first three episodes in order, with no interruptions. If, at the end of the shows i still didn't like it, he would never speak of it again. Instead it was me who could not stop talking about it. The show even stands up to repeated viewings, even after watching every episode and starting all over again, and showing it to other people the show never has gotten dry, i always pick up something new.

2671571,5,B000JJ3Y78,"American tv is clearly a wasteland, which makes Arrested Development some kind of strangely shining proof that intelligence can occasionally find its way through the cracks of network mediocrity.

This show is waaaaay too accurate about a hilariously disfunctional upper middle class American family, and all the phoniness that entails. Seeing the show without commercials turns it into the true work of art it was meant to be.

Amazingly, the last episode is as good as the first, which is spectacularly funny and unsettlingly so. The first two minutes of the pilot are so perfect it's hard to fathom, once you stop laughing.

Every actor is dead on; it's hard to pick a favorite. The scripts are far too intelligent for network tv, let along Fox. Kudos to the exec who green-lighted this puppy; what the hell is he doing at Fox?

It's not your average television comedy - it fits in better with the types of  shows you see on HBO or Showtime (and they allude to this in their final episodes in season 3) than they do with the typical fare that is currently broadcast on basic television.  If you like sarcastic, tongue-in-cheek, dry humor, this will be a perfect fit.

You would hate all these characters if you met them in real life, but that's why you love to watch them.  The actors and actresses that come in for cameos are fantastic and fun, the writers do an amazing job weaving a web of running jokes and subtle references between episodes and seasons.

I am sorry that I didn't watch this show while it was on TV.

There is so much substance to the show, which makes a $50 price tag seem like a steal. And with subtitles and replayability, you can't miss anything despite the show's faster-than-average pace.

The only disappointment I had was learning that the series only lasted 3 seasons. In my opinion, this makes the DVD set even more a must-have, since new audiences can expect a story line with very cool tie ins and an ending that comes full circle, even with all the wild things going on in this show.",1184716800,,753,4.449275362318841

The basic gist of the show: Arrested Development is a mildly serialized sitcom with a slew of inside jokes about an extremely dysfunctional family consisting of character types NO ONE can relate to... at least on the surface.  A family of spoiled rich, unsympathetic people who constantly back stab each other for their own benefit... A failed 'illusionist,' a successful psychiatrist turned failed actor (who is also a never-nude), a teen boy in love with his cousin, and the family patriarch who is an embezzler amongst other crimes.  If this alone doesn't pique your interest... theres always 'Everybody Loves Raymond.'

Even though every character should be despicable, you can't help loving their self centred, completely oblivious lifestyle.

Liza Minelli is an absolute gem and I relished every moment of her return guest appearances.

For me this whole series is pure genius and watching it complete indulgance. Makes you laugh outloud, cringe and be forever grateful that I don't live in the Bluth Family bubble. The humour is 'quirky' but never alienating. To everyone involved I say bravo - thank you for taking a chance on something that does not fit the mould.

The true genius does unfold upon repeated viewings, so the series is better suited for DVD than for network TV, in my own opinion.

I couldn't get into it until I saw fellow Canadian Martin Short appear as their fake Uncle Shooter.  That was soooo funny.  I think part of its downfall was, there was lots of history you had to be aware of with it.  Past show information would show up in a new show, which was actually very cool for fans.  It may have made it harder to watch.  They made such a large story that way, things were implied and the viewer was made a sort of participant.

I titled this review 'Shocked' because I simply cannot believe that this show did not garner enough viewers to keep it going. The only thing I can think of is that maybe it's not easy to appreciate the characters fully if you don't see it from the start and know their histories well. Having said that, I started watching halfway through the first series and after 2 episodes I bought the DVD's.

  I have never enjoyed US comedies (except for Northern Exposure), but this one is so well-written and acted - intelligent, quirky and populated by extremely likeable characters, even the villains!

I particularly love the way that the characters' mouths get blocked from view right at the moment they swear (accompanied by a loud bleep!) by another actor stepping naturally into the camera view or a prop being held up at the appropriate moment. Just so clever.

This is a show that one can watch over and over again and find something new, funny, insightful, and wonderfully self-referential each time (the foreshadowing of Buster's accident is just brilliant).

I saw a marathon of it on cable around christmas and was entertained , but did not really get into the series as I was channel flipping and talking, etc. I rented from blockbuster and that's when I was hooked. The show is on of those things that when you give it your undivided attention, it will blow you away. The subtle humor, the diverse plots, the character building, all amazing

I had seen a couple of random episodes but stopped watching because I felt like I was missing parts of the story. Since the day I bought this set me and my wife can't stop watching it. We just started the third season and I'm convinced this is one of the greatest TV shows ever. Never does it feel like you are forced to laugh; you just do and a lot. This is not a show for people who aren't going to pay attention. You can miss a lot even if you turn away for a second. The characters are played so well and every emotion they portay no matter how absurd seems 100% genuine. The only bad thing about this show is that they aren't making it anymore.

Michael, the only halfway stable and decent family member resigns himself to holding together the family after the untimely incarceration of George Bluth, Sr. Jason Bateman portrays Michael's deer in headlights panic perfectly. Gob is my favorite character. He is hands-down the most pathetic of all the family members, and his chicken impression always leaves me in stitches. I would advise that you watch this with no distractions :the rapid-fire jokes in this show are also visual!

If we would have purchased each season, from several different stores, I estimate that it would have cost us well over $80, plus tax and all that running around.  The hardest thing to do was wait for it to get to us; which took about a week.  We watched the last two seasons in one weekend -it is really that good.  Usually, when I think comedy, I think of some drab situational comedy that doesn't carry its storylines from one show to the next.

The writing is downright brilliant and consistently good in every single episode.  (Unlike, say the more popular and well known ""Seinfeld"", which was brilliant in some episodes, but frankly only so-so in others.)  The great thing about owning the entire series of ""Arrested Development"" is the ability to re-watch episodes.

(Granted, I might have been slightly intoxicated at the time, but anyway..) The only reason this show was eventually canceled was not enough Nielsen ratings. However, the producers and writers did get prior notice so they were able to finish the storyline and end the show diligently. So, when you buy seasons 1-3, you are getting a 53-episode comedy story in its entirety, complete with final ending. Well worth it!",1168819200,,843,4.6644295302013425

Once you've seen every episode 2/3 times you'll realize that almost every sentence spoken is comedy brilliance. The writing is just so original and so good.

The in-jokes, the references, the narration, the actors, the performances, GOB, Tobias, Jeffrey Tambor's double roll as his own twin brother (sounds corny -> is extremely funny..), everything is just about spot-on.

Just one point of criticism, I find the Lindsay character to one-dimensional and although this may well be the intent of the writers, I LIKE her least.

Every time I watch any episode, I am amazed to see a new facet of the script that I didn't notice before. The depth of the characters, humor, motifs, and themes is not something you see very often on TV, especially now that the show is off the air.

2671743,5,B000JJ3Y78,"If you are not familiar with the show, you are in for a real treat as I was.  The characters are so well cast that they easily develop and are distinctive within a few episodes.  The humor is clever and complex but easy to identify and exceptionally enjoyable to watch.  You find yourself thinking that they couldn't possibly ""go there"" and they will, tucked into a ball and shot out of a cannon.  One of the distinctive features of the show, imho, is the aggressive attention to detail.  Repeat views of the show unveil nuances and humorous details going on in the background that are frequently missed with everything going on in the foreground.

Its very difficult to pick favorite episodes and characters as they are equally brilliant.  Although I could not stop laughing in season 2, as they were sure to put blue smudges in every scene, and I do mean every scene (Tobias was a hopeful for the Blue Man Group and manages to get Blue on EVERYTHING).  This sort of over-the-top work is what gives the show its charm along with Ron Howard narating the story over the top and keeping everything straight with pin-point timing.

I was absolutely shocked to find out it was canceled when I came up here to find out when season 4 was coming out on DVD... but then Hollywood is abundant with people that have the mind of a luke warm, flat diet soda.  The fact that intelligent, clever humor is beat out by craptastic shows similar to ""charmed"" and ""everybody (does not) love raymond"" is sad.",1168732800,,1488,4.56015037593985

It repays watching and rewatching -- the first time through you'll be laughing out loud, and every time you watch after that you'll be noticing subtle little things you didn't catch before.  A stellar cast with unbelievable guest stars in both big and small parts; outstanding writing; the most imaginative bunch of characters -- I could go on and on, but I will just say that I have yet to meet anyone who has not agreed that ""Arrested Development"" is completely fabulous.  I am flabbergasted that it went off the air; I won't comment on American viewing habits, and besides, I think it must have been sunk by lackluster promotion on Fox's part because anyone who watches it wants more!

It is reflexive and self-referencial, funny on so many levels but not high-falutin'.  Its topical and satirical with a heck of a TV pedigree.

There is so much there that takes multiple viewings!!  Unlike what another reviewer said, I liked watching the cast commentary on episodes as they pointed out jokes that were hidden and had me pausing the DVD player to see.

The characters are fantastic, the plots engaging, and the laughs...oh the laughs. Get used to giant tear-jerking-stomach-cramping laughs. They will come hard and fast....and often. This set of all three seasons is perfect for a show like Arrested Development. Jokes from the beginning of the first season run all the way through the end of the third. But you'll have plenty of time to notice these running gags on your fourth or fifth viewing. Don't worry, it never ever gets boring or old. There is always a joke that you didn't catch, or a facial expression you missed.

With complex plot lines, seemingly random turns of the story, amazingly unconventional characters and writers as well versed as they are hilarious, Arrested Development beats the living daylights out of any show, comedy or otherwise, I have ever seen on TV.

This DVD pack is excellent, it is a very well made and well designed complement to any DVD collection, and the perfect introduction to AD. Even if you've seen AD on TV, you will most certainly get a newfound appreciation for it when watching these DVDs; the convenience of watching several episodes in a row, going back and forth, rewinding, etc is particularly well suited to the complex nature of this show.

When I watched the end of the third season, I was dumbfounded that such an amazing show was cancelled. You do not know how much I hope Fox will pull a Family Guy and bring AD back...BUY THE DVDS!",1166572800,3,986,4.660919540229885
2671784,5,B000JJ3Y78,"In the wake of the ""Enron"" scandal and others like it, it was amazing that such an unfunny subject could be made so hilarious. The Bluth family, in spite of the advertising to the contrary, has hardly ""lost everything"". What they have lost is the ability to charge their personal living expenses to the company after the company founder and head of the family, George Bluth, is arrested and charged with embezzlement and fraud. They still have one poorly constructed model home - with nothing but sand surrounding it - plus the Bluth Development company, which actually is a legitimate business, it just hasn't been run that way up until now. They also have Michael, the only family member with a conscience and a work ethic, who works to keep the family and the company together in his father's absence. However, for the spoiled Bluths, losing access to the company jet and cars, having their country club membership downgraded to a pool membership, and having to share the roomy yet shoddily constructed model home as living quarters has them all acting like they're stranded on Gilligan's Island.

The results are 53 episodes of great comedy. There are sight gags and inside jokes galore, making this series perfect for DVD where you can watch over and over until you catch everything. After you watch this you'll never again see The Blue Man Group, model homes, Mrs. Doubtfire, cut-off shorts, Michael Moore, or the phrases ""Mission Accomplished"" and ""Justice is Blind"" without thinking of this show and laughing.

It may have not had stellar ratings, but it was funny and fresh up to the end. It really makes me question the reasoning of the Fox Network suits. Honestly, ""The Simpsons"" completely ran out of steam back in 1997, and yet almost ten years later they're still on the air, but Fox couldn't let this show finish out a complete third season?

As for the DVD's themselves, I will have to admit that I was somewhat disappointed with the extra features. There were a few good interviews, but most of the extra features consisted of deleted scenes that were not as funny as the scenes included in the actual show. One particular extra feature on season one just had the actors talking over the entire episode of ""Beef Consumme"", which, quite frankly, I found to be annoying. So buy this set for the excellent comedy, but don't expect anything special from the extra features.",1166486400,4,2386,4.800486618004866
2671785,5,B000JJ3Y78,"This show managed to be funny-smart and funny-dumb at the same time. The writing has layers and layers of humor, and I keep going back to these DVDs in good times and bad.  Equal praise to the actors, who bring humanity to their roles amidst all the slapstick and double entendres. Jason Bateman is the heart of this show and his performance is ideal-- in comedic terms he is the straight man, but his subtle reactions to the things the crazier characters say and do is one of the great sources of the humor.  My other personal favorite performance is Jessica Walters' as the mother. And Will Arnett as GOB. And every one else in the cast. And thank you Mitchell Hurwitz.",1165536000,3,671,4.491803278688525

2671787,5,B000JJ3Y78,"Those words are uttered almost every time I watch TV by myself or someone I'm with. It is fairly mind boggling that such a brillant comedy, with a great cast and tons of awards, could get kicked off the air... but it is utterly mind boggling how many horrible trashy sitcoms get to stay on the networks while the millons of AD fans are left with only three seasons.

Oh well, c'est la vie. At least we have DVDs to watch.

And AD is particularly suited to the DVD format as it is both highly narrative (for a sitcom) and highly self-referential. There are strong plot arcs that make you want to watch shows back to back and, more importantly, there are tons and tons of jokes that you will only get from repeated viewings. The self-referential humor (for example, how the house has blue handprints on the walls for the rest of the season after Tobias tries out for the Blue Man Group one episode) is just an example of the depth of comedy at work. Like The Big Lebowski or Mr. Show, this is comedy made to be watched again and again.

For fans of great comedy in general, Arrested Development is also exciting for its many great guest actors from other brillant comedies (including Upright Citizens Brigade, Seinfeld, Mr. Show and The Daily Show). There really isn't enough that can be said about this show. But it and just watch.",1165363200,4,1330,4.465020576131687
2671788,5,B000JJ3Y78,"FOX just loves to cancel outstanding series.  They singlehandedly dismantled what I think are the two best shows to have aired in this decade: Firefly and Arrested Development.  When I saw the deal for the complete AD DVD set at such a bargain price I pounced... no way could I let this deal pass without adding one of the greatest TV shows of all time to my DVD collection.

Arrested Development was a brilliant new approach to the sitcom.  Like some have mentioned, the fact that it was a running story could throw you off if you were jumping in in the middle of a season, or missed an episode.  But the humor was exquisitely funny and cutting-edge... they managed to really walk the finest of lines without crossing over into territory that would have pushed them into a late-night slot or relegated them to a cable-network-only show.  In some respects, it would have been interesting to see how the show would have played out on a premium network where they could really push the limits of good taste, but in a way the show was just that much funnier for the fact that the writers managed to go right up to the edge of what was allowable and just hold it there.  Perhaps if they had that little bit more freedom that a cable network like F/X or Showtime would have allowed them, it just wouldn't have been as funny.

The show touches on so many fascinating but sensitive subjects over the course of the three seasons, with many interleaving arcs.  Running through the whole thing is the clever scheming of the imprisoned Bluth patriarch (played by Jeffery Tambor), and how his family manages to unwittingly sabotage his every move.  David Cross is brilliant in a disturbingly funny way (who could forget his audition for a part as an understudy for the Blue Man Group?), and Jason Bateman is charming as the overburdened prodigal son trying to return home to put things right while trying to maintain a sane relationship with his own teenaged son despite the familial chaos going on around them.  Each of the actors in this series is so well-cast, even right down to the small recurring roles like Henry Winkler as the Bluths' bumbling lawyer.

This was one of the funniest, smartest comedies to air in a long time, and unfortunately it fell into the hands of FOX, who appear to not know what to do with a good thing when they find one, so they proceeded to demolish it and finally succeeded at destroying it by the third season.  Sometimes TV networks have to realize that ratings don't reflect the true value of a show like this... While Arrested Development didn't have Seinfeld-like numbers, I think this show will have legs in reruns and DVD sales, and FOX will be sorry that they canned this show after only three seasons.",1165276800,12,2732,4.596707818930041

8150450,5,B000JJ3Y78,"This is one of the best television shows in recent history and it will always be a great shame that it didn't gain an adequate following while it was still airing in order to keep it airing. Thank goodness that we can continue to enjoy this comedic gem with the DVD set. Episodes can be enjoyed over and over again while retaining their humor and charm- seriously, the series holds up even now and jokes continue to be funny even when you've heard them before. A must have.",1465776000,,473,4.386363636363637
8150451,5,B000JJ3Y78,This has gotta be in my top 20 if not top 10 smartest comedy series.  Each actor and actress is superb and perfect in their role.  Makes me angry that I'm not that witty.  A MUST watch.,1465430400,,185,3.945945945945946
