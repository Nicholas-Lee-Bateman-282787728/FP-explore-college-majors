7891269,5,6305534659,"Pirates are a fascinating topic.  However, most of the 'documentaries' out there are over-the-top and cheesy.  This documentary does justice to this fascinating topic, not romanticizing the horrible deeds of pirates or the harsh realities.  Included are reenactments of pirate weapons and ships, and many notable experts in the field weigh in.  Many large puclic libraries have this available, and it should be available through ILL services!",1070150400,3,442,5.552238805970149

7891271,5,6305534659,"Walter Mathau is probably at his funniest here, playing Captain Red, a peg-legged, down-on-his-luck pirate, who has found himself acast at sea aboard a raft with only a young seaman as his mate (played by Cris  Campion)!
 Of course, as luck would have it, they are picked up by a  Spanish galleon, which has aboard it a fabulous Aztec treasure and a  beautiful young lady, who is being held hostage by the evil Spanish captain  of the ship.
 It's ""Pirates"" and famed director Roman Polanski shows  no mercy! The film moves like a schooner in good wind as he presents solid  actors, who are able to cast off with a clever script and excellent  directing and set sail on the seven seas of good cinema.  And they never  founder!  Action-packed, it's one predicament after another, from planned  rescues to overthrowing their captors to trying to save the treasure and  Mathau makes a convincing buccaneer (complete with peg leg!).
Written by  Gerard Brach and Polanski, the script is razor sharp, filled with excellent  witicisms that will leave you howling!  This is one sea-worthy story that  should not be missed.  It's a port in any storm!
