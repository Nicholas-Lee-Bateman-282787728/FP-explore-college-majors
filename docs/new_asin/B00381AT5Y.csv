8390943,5,B00381AT5Y,"I love all of Zane Gray's Westerns. Actually, they are nearly all Romances, we might say In western dress. But that comment is slightly unfair. There is always the story of danger, and danger overcome. High Noon (not by Zane Gray) is a classic example of this blending. It is a western; it is a Romance; it centers on danger.",1356825600,,325,4.433333333333334
