8287481,1,B001CFEC2E,"Characteristic of today, the Canadian production team takes a ""politically correct"" path.
Totally devoid of true understanding with regard to Bushido or the Samurai concept.
Artists and musicians, people known for their focus on ""self"", are portrayed as samurai-like.
Spending years in Japan I found it a poor contribution to cultural understanding.
More accurately, it is a liberal attempt to paint a PC mindset as honorable.
The problem is... those that are showcased have contributed little to society, culture, life.
To be sure, they toss in a few individuals that make the link appear valid; a sword-maker, a failed kamikaze, kendo sensei.
But in the end, the video is shallow and misses the essence of what it meant to be a samurai.
To be a samurai is to put others above yourself.  None of those shown, nor the production team, got that.
Instead we get segments on bisexuality, women's rights, protest, etc.  A huge miss of the point.
Disappointing.",1509408000,3,956,5.0062893081761
8287482,5,B001CFEC2E,Very well done. I like how each part is a separate chapter.,1456185600,,59,4.0
8287483,1,B001CFEC2E,"I don't know what video Fleetlord Atvar watched to give it a ""5 stars"" rating but I personally was very disappointed with this documentary, but as is stated in my review title ""what do you expect for $6.99?!?!?! You definitely get what you pay for which isn't much really! If your pashionate & knowledgeable about Samurai (like me) due to your fair share of study & research on the topic then I think you REALLY will not enjoy watching this documentary. It doesn't really go into any great detail on anything...they just kinda ""browse"" from one Samurai related topic to another aimlessly?!?!? They do speak briefly about legendary Samurai Miyamoto Musashi, his upbringing, swordsmanship & some of his career achievements such as some of the Samurai he defeated & killed, as well as his writing of the ""Book of Five Rings"" but like I said earlier they don't go into great detail about Musashi.

The documentary focuses more on how the ""Samurai spirit"" influences modern day Japan & how Japanese people today try & impliment the morales & ethics of the Samurai in their everyday jobs & pashions. They show quick glimpses of Japanese swordsmithing (which was one of the only parts I liked) Iaido, Kendo & other Martial Arts, but once again ""quick glimpses"". They show how Samurai have become a big part of modern day popular culture in the form of video games & comic books. And they speak briefly of Japan's participation in World War II & one pilot's expierence in the war.

I was expecting a documentary on the bloody history of the Samurai covering the Sengoku Jidai period (which was the golden age of the Samurai) the Tokugawa Shogunate, something tangible on the history of the Samurai. I wouldn't even consider this video to be a good introductory documentary on the Samurai because it really won't teach you anything that significant on the topic. This documentary was just soooooo elemantary! Perhaps if you know absolutely nothing about the Samurai then you might like it but I highly doubt it. Your better off saving the $6.99 and putting that towards buying another Samurai documentary video. Sorry about the long review, I'm just very pashionate about Samurai, I've been studying them for most of my life (I'm 30) & I think this video is a very poor representation of them!",1277942400,7,2284,4.809160305343512
8287484,5,B001CFEC2E,Well made documentary by national geographic Canada. It shows how the Samurai historically started and been transformed as the country's culture has changed over the centuries. It also focuses on how modern Japan intercepts the ancient Samurai.,1264464000,3,244,5.621621621621622
