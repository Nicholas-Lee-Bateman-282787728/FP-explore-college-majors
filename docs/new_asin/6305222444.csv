988923,2,6305222444,"Yes, the footage is stunning, huge and colorful. However, the presentation of information is not really compelling. The topic is interesting, but what's its relationship to everything else? I was disappointed. If you're a teacher, and you're teaching about volcanoes, this is a good one for one period, because it's short. But actually not that thought-provoking. For my money, I'd still prefer to show Dante's Peak, even though the filmmakers have taken some artistic license to tell the story.",1181347200,5,495,5.2784810126582276
988924,3,6305222444,"The standards for documentaries nowadays are very high. You need to succeed not only in the educational side of the story but also in entertaining the viewer. As an example, Greg Macgillivray's work in The Living Seas, Stormchasers or The Magic of Flight does everything in order to keep you on the edge of your seat without loosing the story's edge. Here, you can learn a lot from the sysmic and volcanic activities that determine most aspects of the people that live inside the Pacific Rim. Nevertheless, you never feel quite engaged and/or commited to the story as you do with the formerly referred work. The story starts with a visit to Chile's newly born Navidad crater and leads us through a journey that involves San Francisco, the Aleutian Islands, the coasts of the former U.S.S.R., Japan, Hawaii and Indonesia. Anyhow, some shots are impressive- like San Francisco's earthquake recordings- some are really dull. The video and audio quality are very good, though not impressive. Unless you want to complete your dvd collection, try other stuff such as the discs referred above or Africa-The Serengetti or Imax-Alaska.",967075200,29,1126,5.026737967914438

988989,4,6305222444,This is an interesting intersection of family love and forgiveness under the umbrella of a company who pays lip service to the environmentalists who can see the writing on the wall and want everyone in town to be safe and ignorant of the ploys  being used to deceive the community and perhaps even the world..,1463184000,,309,4.618181818181818

989074,3,6305222444,i was disappointed in the amount of time spent on the San Francisco earthquake. I expected a volcano documentary. More time was spent on SF than any indivdual volcano.received.,1423785600,,176,5.103448275862069
989075,3,6305222444,"Documentary is OK, but does not explain or contain scientific explanations for the Ring of Fire or how the Earth formed this Ring over millions or years. Half of the documentary serves no purpose whatsoever, by spending half the show watching different cultures before pagan rituals to the Volcanoes as if they were gods, etc.

Personally, seeing that this is not even an hour long presentation on something so completely and scientifically interesting that I would refer to other better documentaries done by NATGEO.  10 minutes of having to watch drumming and dancing rituals are a waste of time.  Then again it is an IMAX picture, so they really do not care about explaining the scientific aspects of anything, it is just for show.",1421798400,,734,4.903225806451613

989130,3,6305222444,"The march of Blu-ray resuscitated IMAX nature films continues with Ring of Fire a 38-minute look at that most nightmarish of natural phenomena. The film gets all up into the grills of volcanoes, the cameras capturing bubbling, frothing magma, billowing smoke belched from mountain orifices and the slow, malevolent creep of lava.

At just a shade north of thirty minutes, the documentary won't explore every facet of volcanology, but there's enough info to get you started on your quest for more information.

On Blu-ray, the savage imagery pops, though it's not quite as impressive as similar nature documentaries. Perhaps it's the age of the production (originally released in 1991), but the 1.78:1 resurfacing just doesn't quite wow me as it should. It's certainly a serviceable transfer, but could have been a lot more detailed and robust. The DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio track throbs (the LFE resonates during the eruptions) but there is only an IMAX trailer reel for extras.

989131,1,6305222444,Purchased this after reading reviews and found it unusable for my Earth Science classroom . There was very little information that applied to state objectives I cover in my middle school classroom - which has to cover High School objectives . Would NOT recommend this for any classroom unless maybe a film class on what not to do . No doubt  '' entertaining''  on/at an IMAX screen .,1271116800,5,383,4.617647058823529
989132,1,6305222444,"end of movie stated made in 1991. Not informative about the volcano's or the ring of fire, other than in general.  the footage is good (by today standards) but doesn't seem to move from point to point without engaging the audience.  The only part that came close was the Indonesian culture connection to the volcano.  a large part of the film tries to show the different culture effects of earthquake (wait wasn't this about volcanoes only?) and volcanoes on the local population, for USA baseball??  Pass it up unless you want to see some footage of different volcanoes around the world, but they are basic footage.",1264377600,6,616,4.783018867924528
989133,4,6305222444,"I actually bought this for my 4 and 6 year old sons.  They love it and it made them interested in volcanoes and earthquakes.  They quote it!  It is informative and shows more than a US perspective, although a lot of time is spent on San Fransisco, Mount St. Helens. and Hawaii.  It also covers a Japan and Indonesia.  It entertains and informs.  The trailers included are good too.",1189036800,15,381,4.449275362318841

7885205,5,6305222444,"Great presentation about volcanoes.  Not the most educational, but wonderful dramatic footage that I haven't seen in other volcano specials.  And (spoiler alert) you can't be Japanese drummers for matching music to the power of a volcano.",1495152000,,238,5.405405405405405
