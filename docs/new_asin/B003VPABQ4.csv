8406997,5,B003VPABQ4,"If you have watched or have the first two DVDs in the Coin op TV series, you'll know what to expect, and be delighted with what you get- Which is a nicely segmented DVD with interviews and snippets of things Retro game related.
If you are a fan of retro games, you will probably already know you will want this. Along with the first two, just a terrific enjoyable watch.",1284163200,,370,4.3
8406998,5,B003VPABQ4,"The driving force behind the COIN-OP TV franchise is back with the third volume of the DVD series. Vol 3 covers the third year of coverage for the non-""Live"" version of the show. What you'll find in here is location interviews and coverage that primarily targets the gamer crowd, but has a bit of something for nerds of every stripe.  There is coverage of the popular gaming franchise Call of Duty, Intellivision founder - Keith Robinson, Twin Galaxies founder - Walter Day and more. There is also quite a bit outside gaming, however, including quick sound bites from Cosplayers and several conventions (Star Wars Celebration IV, Pacific Media Expo and E is For All), interviews with celebs (Kevin Pereira of G4TV, Tommy Tallarico of Video Games Live), and coverage of the I-am-bit art show and Nerdcore Calendar release.

You might also spot an interview with Mimoco (creator of Mimobots) which were small at the time, but you can see everywhere nowadays and artist Luke Chueh when he was still growing into a name.

All in all, it's another great volume from the series.  Host Cyndee San Luis is an attractive, lively host for the show and the knowledge of the team comes across with each episode.  Highly recommended for people in the know!",1280793600,,1243,4.816901408450704
8406999,5,B003VPABQ4,"Hard to believe the show's going on 6 years. Still feels as fresh as it ever has. There's no shortage of content in here, especially if you want to learn more about the industry.
If you don't own the first two volumes (WHY NOT?), go back and get those, too.
I can't get enough of Hailey Bright!",1280534400,,294,4.175438596491228
8407000,5,B003VPABQ4,"I had the pleasure of watching this entire video and it has some really good stuff on there. Coin-Op TV gets wonderful interviews of video game pioneers, gaming events and so much more. Highlights on this one are the pieces on the Nerdcore Calendar, the I am 8-Bit art show, and a seriously in-depth interview with the true creator of Pong (and Simon!!!) Plus, if you're a Hailey Bright fan - and who isn't - you get to see her very first Coin-Op TV interview, not to mention her audition. I really hope they make Coin-Op TV Volume 4 so we get more of Hailey.

But have to give a shout-out to Cyndee San Luis, who does a lot of the interviews on this set and is amazing. Especially when she interviews the art shows, celebrities like Kevin Pereira and a Star Wars celebration.

If you have Coin-Op TV Vol. 1 & 2, this is a no-brainer. If you don't, get all 3. Retro gamers will LOVE these episodes, and you newbie gamers should check it out too. Learn your history!",1279152000,3,965,4.3259668508287294
