THE FILM - [ 3 / 5 ]:

*This Blu-ray is part of the 2-film Blu-ray/DVD set ""Edgar Allan Poe's Black Cats: Two Adaptations By Sergio Martino & Lucio Fulci.""

Edgar Allan Poes celebrated story The Black Cat has provided the inspiration for numerous films over the years. But few adaptations are as stylish as those offered up by the twin Italian titans of terror, Sergio Martino and Lucio Fulci.

In ""The Black Cat,"" from that other Godfather of Gore, Lucio Fulci (Zombie), Scotland Yard Inspector Gorley (David Warbeck, The Beyond) find himself summoned to a sleepy English village to investigate the recent murder of a young couple. With no obvious signs of entry at the murder scene, Gorley is forced to start considering the possibility that his suspect may not be human

Creepy and very atmospheric at times, ""The Black Cat"" is a fine film by Lucio Fulci. As it's also mentioned in the commentary track for the film, it's not heavy on gore which is somewhat unusual for Fulci. However there are a number of entertaining death scenes and the film has Lucio Fulci's usual style of focusing on the eyes of his subject. The film uses some eerie settings and features a great score by Pino Donaggio.

AUDIO - [ 4 / 5 ]:

""The Black Cat"" comes with two audio options. There is an English DTS-HD Master Audio Mono track and an Italian DTS-HD Master Audio Mono track. English subtitles are also included. From the Main Menu you are asked which version of the film you would like to view, English or Italian. I thought both audio tracks sounded very good. The sound level was consistent and balanced throughout the film. For the English language version of the film, the voice actors were easy to hear and understand. Pino Donaggio's score sounds haunting and excellent. I did not encounter any problems with either of the audio tracks.

VIDEO - [ 4 / 5 ]:

""The Black Cat"" comes to Blu-ray courtesy of a brand new 2K scan of the original negatives, thanks to Arrow Video. The film is presented in 1080p with a 2.35:1 Aspect Ratio. The Blu-ray features strong colors whether it be glowing yellow eyes, bloody wounds or a characters clothing. The contrast level looks very good as do black levels. Skin tones have a natural looking appearance. The film looks very detailed overall and it really shines in many closeups with great detail present in things such as the faces, hair and clothing of the characters. Film grain looked quite good, even in darker scenes. The movie is not debris-free as there was one scene that had a couple marks show up somewhat faintly for a few seconds. Other than that, I only noticed the occasional blemish. The HD presentation sure does make the strings on the bats more noticeable though.

SPECIAL FEATURES - [ 4.5 / 5 ]:

Audio Commentary with Chris Alexander - At the time this commentary was recorded, Chris Alexander was the editor-in-chief for Fangoria. He has since stepped down from that position. Anyhow, I enjoyed the commentary as it is basically from a fans perspective. Mr. Alexander does a good job of providing information about the film and members of its cast and crew. He does go off-subject a bit from time to time but otherwise he keeps talking, with only a few quiet moments, late in the film.

Poe into Fulci: The Spirit of Perverseness (25:37) - Film historian Stephen Thrower, author of 'Beyond Terror - The Films of Lucio Fulci' discusses Fulci's Poe-tinged classic. Mr. Thrower talks about the differences and similarities between the Poe story and Fulci's film. He also mentions some aspects of the film that were ripped off from some U.S. films, sometimes against Fulci's wishes. Also discussed are some of the shortcomings of ""The Black Cat"" as well as its positive aspects.

In the Paw-Prints of the Black Cat (8:28) - This extra also features Stephen Thrower who takes us on a trip to some of the filming locations.

Frightened Dagmar (20:12) - An informative interview with actress Dagmar Lassander. She discusses how she began acting and many of the films from her career. Ms. Lassander talks about how she once broke a contract due to not desiring to do the type of film a studio wanted and having to go to court. (with English subtitles)

At Home with David Warbeck (1:10:20) - A lengthy, vintage interview by Stephen Thrower that takes place at David Warbeck's London home. The interview covers a number of topics including what it was like to work with Lucio Fulci, acting skills he used in his roles and filming ""The Black Cat."" Mr. Warbeck shares several personal stories involving his career, experience in the film business and personal life including a very tragic story involving a plane crash.

IN CONCLUSION:

As mentioned earlier, this Blu-ray is part of the 2-film (4-disc) Blu-ray/DVD set ""Edgar Allan Poe's Black Cats: Two Adaptations By Sergio Martino & Lucio Fulci."" The other film in the set is Sergio Martino's ""Your Vice is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key"" which we reviewed here. That set also includes an 80 page perfect-bound book featuring new writing on the films, Poe's original story and more, illustrated with archive stills and posters.

""The Black Cat"" features excellent audio and video quality that should please its fans. The Blu-ray also comes loaded with two hours of extras. A bit of a different film from Fulci's typical gore-fests, it's still an entertaining film. I haven't seen the other Blu-ray yet in this set, but am very much looking forward to it as I am a fan of the film.

THE FILM [ 3.5 / 5 ]:

*This Blu-ray is part of the 2-film Blu-ray/DVD set ""Edgar Allan Poe's Black Cats: Two Adaptations By Sergio Martino & Lucio Fulci.""

Edgar Allan Poes celebrated story The Black Cat has provided the inspiration for numerous films over the years. But few adaptations are as stylish as those offered up by the twin Italian titans of terror, Sergio Martino and Lucio Fulci. In Martinos classic giallo, ""Your Vice is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key,"" teacher Oliviero (Luigi Pistilli, A Bay of Blood) finds himself under suspicion for murder when one of his students  and mistress  is found brutally murdered. As more bodies start to pile up, the arrival of Olivieros attractive niece (Edwige Fenech, ""Five Dolls for an August Moon,"" ""All the Colours of the Dark"") brings with it complications of its own.

""Your Vice is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key"" is an interesting film with a strange and long title, which happens to come from an earlier Martino giallo, ""The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh."" That film too, featured the always lovely Edwige Fenech. In the case of ""Your Vice..."" you may find yourself wondering, who exactly is killing who? Looks can be deceiving and things aren't always as they appear. The characters don't know who to trust and with good reason.

AUDIO - [ 4.5 / 5 ]:

""Your Vice is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key"" comes with two audio options in the form of Italian and English DTS-HD Master Audio Mono tracks. English subtitles are also included. Just like the other film in the set, ""The Black Cat,"" from the Main Menu you are asked which version of the film you would like to view, English or Italian. The audio sounded great. The dialogue, sound effects and Bruno Nicolai's score were balanced nicely throughout the film. For the English language version, the dialogue was clear and easy to understand. The Italian language version sounded excellent as well.

VIDEO - [ 4.5 / 5 ]:

""Your Vice is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key"" comes to Blu-ray thanks to Arrow Video via a brand new 2K restoration from the films original negative. The film looks beautiful. I have been anxiously waiting to see how the film looks in high definition and Arrow Video did not disappoint. The colors look strong and realistic in appearance. Skin tones look natural and the contrast levels look great. Black levels look spot on as well. There is a thin layer of film grain present throughout and a few times it does become heavier in darker scenes, but it is nothing distracting and most people expect that. Please note the screenshots used in the review were not taken directly from the Blu-ray disc.

SPECIAL FEATURES - [ 4.5 / 5 ]:

Through the Keyhole: An Interview with Sergio Martino (34:42) - A fascinating interview in which Mr. Martino talks fondly of cast members Edwige Fenech, Anita Strindberg and Luigi Pistilli whose life ended tragically. Sergio Martino talks about the music used in the film, several of his other movies and a big scene that takes place toward the end of the film. I believe this was the first time I have seen an interview with Mr. Martino, so this was a real treat and a joy to watch. (with English subtitles)

Unveiling the Vice (23:07) - This is a making-of restrospective that features interviews with Sergio Martino, star Edwige Fenech and screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi. Sergio Martino talks about some of his films including ""Torso"" and ""Your Vice..."" as well as shooting locations. Edwige Fenech recalls being served egg and onion sandwiches and omelettes while filming. She also talks about a conversation with Quentin Tarantino on her film roles. Ernesto Gastaldi discusses his writing the screenplay and importance of structure in writing and sometimes feeling the need to outdo ones self when writing many films. (with English subtitles)

Dolls of Flesh and Blood (29:04 ) - Michael Mackenzie discusses Sergio Martino's contributions to the giallo genre. A spoiler warning is given as some key plot points are discussed for several Sergio Martino films. This is a comprehensive featurette and very well done.

The Strange Vices of Ms. Fenech (29:42)  - Justin Harries discusses the career of Edwige Fenech. A must watch for fans of, in my opinion, the most beautiful woman to appear on film in the horror genre. Mr. Harries also talks about the giallo genre and its origins.

Eli Roth on Your Vice (9:17) - Eli Roth talks about ""Your Vice.."" and briefly touches on giallo and early POV style slasher films.

Reversible sleeve featuring original and newly-commissioned artwork by Matthew Griffin.

IN CONCLUSION:

Arrow Video does a terrific job once again. It's very satisfying watching films you enjoy on Blu-ray and better yet when they are of high quality. The audio and video presentation are great and there are over two hours of interviews included as well. I highly recommend the ""Black Cats"" set.

As mentioned earlier, this Blu-ray is part of the 2-film (4-disc) Blu-ray/DVD set ""Edgar Allan Poe's Black Cats: Two Adaptations By Sergio Martino & Lucio Fulci."" The other film in the set is Lucio Fulci's ""The Black Cat"" which we reviewed here.

That movie is Your Vice is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key. Yes it does have some nudity and gore but its not scary as in Jumpy. But I thought the story was enjoyable ...and of course the nudity was great too. The second film Black Cat is good but not great as the story hovers on the mind controlling a deadly cat. But I did still found the film a fun watch.

If your a collector and or love older Horror films You should give this a shot. Picture Quality is pretty awesome and I think this set is limited from Arrow Video.",1447113600,,663,3.8394160583941606
7332044,5,B011CMJJQK,"Arrow Video's Blu-ray box set Edgar Allan Poe's Black Cats maybe the surprise release of 2015. The reason is twofold, I didn't expect either of these 2 Italian obscurities to get a release on Blu-ray at anytime in the future, and the other reason is that is that even with a nod in the credits, and an obvious short moment in the film I never considered Your Vice... to be an adaptation of Poe. Regardless, it is a great pleasure to have these 2 fully restored on Blu-ray....

7332045,5,B011CMJJQK,"This is a very nice set from the great folks at Arrow Video. The boxset is really great looking in person, very sturdy also. The 2 films included here are both inspired by the Edgar Allan Poe short story The Back Cat. You have in this set Your Vice is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key directed by Sergio Martino & The Black Cat directed by Lucio Fulci. Both films obviously have a black cat that's central to the story but its more prominent in Fulci's film being responsible for almost everything bad that happens. After watching both films I have to say that I enjoyed Martino's Your Vice better then Fulci's Black Cat. Your Vice is more like a traditional Italian Giallo film. Black Cat does some interesting things though & can also be seen as a giallo by some except the black glove the killer would normally wear is replaced by a black paw. Its also not very gory when compared to some of the other films Fulci has done. I also found the overall pacing, plot, characters, acting & story more interesting in Your Vice. Edwige Fenech especially does a very good job in Your Vice but the rest of the cast is good as well.

Ive never seen anything by Sergio Martino but after watching Your Vice I will certainly look into his other works. As a big fan of Lucio Fulci I felt just a little let down by his film The Black Cat. The characters, story, pacing, acting & general plot while ok just weren't up to his other stuff. Its not a bad film by any means it just falls somewhere below some of his other works. Both discs have very good extras, commentaries, interviews, trailers, filming locations (on The Back Cat) that any fan of the films will enjoy. Also comes with a very nice book that has writings on both films, Lucio Fulci's final interview & it also includes Edgar Allan Poe's original story. If you are a fan of Fulci & Italian giallo films then this beautiful boxset is a must own & being limited to only 3000 copies I wouldn't wait too long to grab it.",1446336000,3,1971,4.327027027027027
7332046,4,B011CMJJQK,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

If we can have spaghetti westerns why not pizza Poe?

The works of Edgar Allan Poe have been made into movies for quite some time. While there are a number of titles Im sure everyone is aware of, in particular the Roger Corman films of the sixties, there have been lesser known movies made from his works that have been hard to find. Arrow Video is making sure that at least two of those titles are more accessible now. This two film collection features movies both based on Poes story THE BLACK CAT. Included are YOUR VICE IS A LOCKED ROOM AND ONLY I HAVE THE KEY and THE BLACK CAT.

While both films are incredibly loose with their connection to the original story the first is by far the most removed. Made in 1972 by director Sergio Martino the film is a classic giallo style movie. For those unfamiliar with the term these were movies made in Italy that were often compared to or taken from pulp murder mysteries from Italy that were featured with yellow covers or giallo. The films, most made in the 70s, always featured the killer unseen with the exception of more often than not  pair of black gloves as he/she killed his/her victim.

Oliviero (Luigi Pistilli) is a burned out novelist who hasn't written anything new in some time. Living in his late mothers home in Italy, he spends his days and nights in the company of a group of hippies more than happy to live off of his free food and wine. Oliviero lives with his wife Irina (Anita Strindberg) who he abuses both psychologically and physically and their servant, a young black woman. While his relationship with his wife doesnt show signs of sadism the hint that it is there remains throughout the film. A murder occurs in town and the police suspect Oliviero but don't have enough evidence to arrest him. When his maid is murdered as well, he and Irina hide the body. Is he the killer though?

Into this house of horrors walks Floriana (Edwige Fenech), Olivieros niece. An attractive and self-confident young woman, Floriana sets about seducing both members of the house. It is readily apparent that Floriana is there for some reason, most likely involving cash. The cat and mouse game (no pun intended) played among the three characters makes for some interesting moments. Before the film ends all is revealed.

While the film is interesting from start to finish Im not sure I could claim its entertaining as well. Moments are but the movie feels disjointed somehow. Perhaps it suffers in translation or maybe its just the difference in the way films are made from one country to the next. In any event it had me wondering just who the killer was throughout, a good sign in a mystery. The ending was satisfactory but one many will figure out before the last reel of the film.

The quality of the film making is pretty good for the time and the fact that movies from Italy at that time always seemed less than what some come to expect. The acting is quite well done and Fenech cemented her standing as a scream queen with this role. Perhaps the strangest question I was left with was what anti per spirant Pistilli was using during the filming as he always seems covered with a sheen of sweat no matter what time of day it is.

Arrow Video once more presents a high quality product with a beautiful blu-ray presentation of the film. Extras, as always with their offerings, are top of the line. Included with this movie are THROUGH THE KEYHOLE - an interview with director Sergio Martino, UNVEILING THE VICE  a making of retrospective featuring interviews with Martino, Fenech and screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi, DOLLS OF FLESH AND BLOOD: THE GIALLI OF SERGIO MARTINO  a visual essay exploring the directors contribution to the genre, THE STRANGE VICES OF MS. FENECH  a look at the career of the much lauded actress and a short featuring Eli Roth discussing the film and its impact on him.

The second film, THE BLACK CAT, was directed by Lucio Fulci in 1981. Perhaps known more for his gore filled horror films like CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD (aka THE GATES OF HELL) and ZOMBIE, Fulci was quite prolific in the giallo genre as well. This film is only one among many that he directed.

As with the first film this one suffers from translation as well, though in a different sense. American films always seem to take on story telling in a linear fashion, moving from point A to point B and so on. With each step we understand why were moving in this direction. This film doesnt choose to do so and honestly until about the 30 minute mark how the various sub plots combine isn't quite clear.

We begin with a man who seems to be hypnotized by a black cat into crashing his car into another and killing himself. From there we find Prof. Robert Miles (Patrick Magee), a paranormal researcher and medium listening to tapes of strange voices speaking in Latin. It isn't until later we find out that Miles has a hobby of recording EVPs of Extra Voice Phenomena in the local graveyard. We jump to Jill Trevers (Mimsy Farmer), a photographer from the U.S. working on a project taking pictures in the local graveyard.

After taking photos that afternoon, Jill learns from the locals at the nearby tavern that Miles is a medium. She goes to visit him and shows him the microphone she found, one of his left behind. At the same time she finds out that Miles owns a black cat, a pet that he is less than fond of but that he keeps on for some reason.

The next thing you know were watching a young couple trying to find a location to fool around in. Choosing a boathouse on the nearby river they start only to have the power to the building shut off. Not only are they left in the dark the ventilation system is shut down as well. Locked inside they're facing certain death. The mother of the young girl, once close to Miles, seeks his help in finding her. She too faces a deadly encounter with the titular feline.

All of these stories finally coalesce and make sense as we get closer to the end. Not only are these threads solved but the entrance of a young police detective who comes to town to look into the series of murders that have been occurring is resolved as well.

As I said the movie takes nearly 30 minutes before it gels together and makes a bit of sense. When it does it becomes a more pleasant encounter and actually turns out to be an interesting movie. The performances are well done from all involved, especially David Warbeck as Inspector Gorley. Warbeck worked with Fulci on his film THE BEYOND as well. The movie is quite entertaining but as with most foreign made films those of us living in the US need to realize that movies aren't made the same way around the world as they are here. If you're willing to watch a film and accept it on its own terms it becomes a much more pleasurable experience. This one could help you achieve that.

Once more Arrow packs on the extras. Featured with this one are an audio commentary by filmmaker and FANGORIA editor Chris Alexander, FROM POE INTO FULCI: THE SPIRIT OF PERVERSENESS  a discussion on the movie by film historian Stephen Thrower, IN THE PAW: THE PRITNS OF THE BLACK CAT  a look at the original locations used in the film, FRIGHTENED DAGMAR  a career interview with Dagmar Lassander who stars in the film, AT HOME WITH DAVID WARBECK  an extensive interview with the actor and the original theatrical trailer.

8724085,4,B011CMJJQK,"This is another solid Arrow limited edition release. Though Im not a big fan of sets that lump movies by different directors together in one set, I still couldn't resist picking it up.

It did not disappoint. As usual, theres are numerous special features that enhance the enjoyment of the films. The packaging is attractive and sturdy, and I enjoyed the included book as well.

Id like to implore Lucio Fulci fans who have not seen The Black Cat (or have seen one of the atrocious, grainy full screen versions) to give it a chance. It is actually streaming free for Prime members. While its not the gore fest that were used to seeing from 1980s Fulci, its a very well-made film with lots of atmosphere and a good enough story to keep me interested.

I really do not understand this films bad reputation. It probably suffers because its not The Beyond or Zombie. Had this been released prior to those movies, it would probably have been as highly regarded as Dont Torture a Duckling. If nothing else, the cinematography is beautifully handled by Sergio Salvati, who was responsible for Zombie and The Beyond.

As for Sergio Martinos Your Vice Is A Locked Room and Only I Have the Key, it is a perfectly serviceable and competent giallo. While it is not perfect, and I really didn't care about the characters, it was still very enjoyable story wise.

It may not be the best giallo out there, but I would say its in the top 20%. If you are in the mood for a violent murder mystery, its hard to go wrong with this movie. I wonder why Sergio Martino isn't as well known as Fulci or Dario Argento. He deserves to be.

If you are a fan of giallo or Italian horror in general, this limited edition set is a nice acquisition. Its enjoyable to watch and looks great on the top shelf of my blu-ray collection. (4.5 stars)",1533686400,,1811,4.472727272727273
8724086,3,B011CMJJQK,"This Arrow double feature special edition combines two Italian films that are purported to be loosely inspired by Edgar Allen Poe's famous short story but in reality have little to do with it.

Your Vice Is A Locked Room and Only I Have the Key is a below average Giallo directed by the normally more interesting Sergio Martino.  It concerns a washed up once famous writer and his abused wife living in decadence in a crumbling villa.  First, a former student who is blackmailing the writer is brutally murdered.  Then his black maid gets the same treatment.  Is the alcoholic and violence prone author a psychotic maniac or is somebody else behind the murders?

Vice is a pretty dull film.  The murders are nicely staged but there aren't nearly enough of them and the stuff between the murders is mostly a bore, including the sex scenes.  All three of the principal characters (a scheming niece turns up eventually) are pretty repellent, which doesn't make for particularly involving storytelling--if you don't care what happens to the characters it's hard to give the viewer much of a reason to keep watching.  The movie does appropriate the famous ending of Poe's story but that only makes Vice too predictable--a smarter movie might have played with viewer expectations in some way but if you are familiar with the Poe story you can see exactly how this is going to end long before the movie gets there.

Fans of Edwige Fenech will likely enjoy this one more but she does nothing for me as a sex symbol or an actress.  I've never thought highly of Your Vice Is A Locked Room and the new Blu-ray transfer has done nothing to change my opinion, although the movie certainly looks much nicer now than it did in previous versions I've seen.

Far more entertaining is Lucio Fulci's The Black Cat which is about the title creature which is committing a series of murders in a small British village.  Cats aren't naturally scary animals unless you happen to have a phobia of them but Fulci actually does a good job of making his cat seem both menacing and impossibly intelligent.

Mimsy Farmer plays an American photographer working in the village who gets involved with the murders because a visiting Scotland Yard inspector needs someone to take pictures of one of the victims.  She's the first to figure out that the cat is somehow responsible but nobody believes her.  Veteran character actor Patrick Magee plays a creepy old medium who sneaks around cemeteries late at night trying to record the voices of the dead.  He's the owner of the murderous feline although it doesn't seem to like him any better than its murder victims.

As usual, Lucio Fulci directs with more enthusiasm than style and The Black Cat isn't really one of his better efforts.  It's also not a good movie in any conventional sense of the word but it is pretty fun if you're in the mood for a schlocky, violent horror film.  This one also uses the famous ending of Poe's story but given the evil nature of the cat does so in a more interesting way.

Both directors Sergio Martino and Lucio Fulci have done much better work than what is offered here, but Fulci ends up winning this dual of the very loose Black Cat adaptations.  His film is faster paced, more violent, sillier and ultimately a lot more entertaining.  Horror fans should probably thank their lucky stars that Arrow showed some mercy and didn't make this a triple feature, also including Luigi Cozzi's virtually unwatchable film The Black Cat as well.",1492732800,,3489,4.71169686985173
8724087,3,B011CMJJQK,"I own both of these films, having purchased them separately. YOUR VICE has a Poe ending. THE BLACK CAT does, but it is not as effective as the one in YOU VICE.

My favorites of the Corman Poe films are HOUSE OF USHER and TOMB OF LIGEIA.

I am still trying to get over the fact that I have to wait another 11 months for the spooky Samhain season of tricks, treats and really nutty gothic Italian horror films. Wait! What's that you say? I don't have to wait? Arrow Films recently released a box set just for me featuring a pair of films by two of my favorite Italian directors? Let the celebrating commence!

Edgar Allan Poe's Black Cats box set features two films loosely based on the classic poem by the master of macabre. The first film, Lucio Fulci's The Black Cat stars David Warbeck (The Beyond) as an inspector investigating a series of murders in a small English village. Along the way he meets a photographer named Jill (Mimsy Farmer) whose post-mortem photographs may hold some evidence that a frisky feline might be responsible or at least hold the key to these murders. Also included is one of several expertly crafted giallo films by Sergio Martino, Your Vice is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key. This classic mindbender stars Luigi Pistilli (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) as an abusive, alcoholic writer who tries convincing his wife (Anita Strindberg) that he is not responsible for the odd murders that keep occurring in and around their sprawling villa. His mysterious young niece (the astonishingly beautiful Edwige Fenech) comes to visit and tries to find out who is responsible for the murders as well.

What can I say except that this box set is one of the best releases I have seen in a long time. It hasn't taken long for Arrow to win me over and I have to say they are probably my favorite DVD/Blu Ray releasing company around now. Their Criterion-level care for obscure, yet usually brilliant, films is a dream come true for fringe film lovers. Overall, I'd say Your Vice is the stronger of the two films but gore lovers won't want to miss Fulci's underrated gothic classic. The fact this box set includes two of my favorite Italian film starlets (Fenech and Dagmar Lassander) just makes the whole thing even sweeter. This limited edition box set features two blu ray discs as well as an amazing 80 page book featuring Poe's original story and detailed writings on the two films. Whether you are a fan of Italian horror, gothic, gore or gialli (or all 4 like me), you can't go wrong with this set. Included in this set are:

-Brand new 2K restorations of the films from the original camera negatives
-High Definition Blu-ray (1080p) and Standard Definition DVD presentations
-Original Italian and English soundtracks in mono audio (uncompressed PCM on the Blu-ray)
-Newly translated subtitles for the Italian soundtracks
-Optional English subtitles for the deaf and hard of hearing for the English soundtracks
-Brand new interview with director Sergio Martino
-Dolls of Flesh and Blood: The Gialli of Sergio Martino - a visual essay by Michael Mackenzie exploring Sergio Martino's unique contributions to the giallo genre
-Stephen Thrower, author of Beyond Terror - The Films of Lucio Fulci, on The Black Cat
-Reversible sleeves featuring original and newly-commissioned artwork by Matthew Griffin
-Limited Edition 80-page perfect-bound book featuring new writing on the films, Poe's original story and more, illustrated with archive stills and posters",1449532800,,3280,4.906306306306306

Never in the history of Blu-ray has such a powerful film set been released.  A bold proclamation to make, yes, but it is certainly warranted.  EDGAR ALAN POES BLACK CATS is a two-movie collection that every fan of horror will want to own.  Both movies are excellent in their own rights, but they are also drastically different.  This diversity, as well as the individual allure of each film, is part of what makes this set so great, and it will make a perfect holiday gift for the horror lover in your life.

Arrow and MVD could not have picked two better films to highlight the unique takes on this Poe classic.  Granted, many interpretations of the story have been made over the years, but these films are two of the best.

YOUR VICE IS A LOCKED ROOM AND ONLY I HAVE THE KEY is a slick Italian giallo from Sergio Martino.  THE BLACK CAT is a chilling dose of horror from one of the Kings of Gore, Lucio Fulci.  Both look excellent onscreen, thanks to brand new 2K restorations of the films from the original camera negatives.  But whereas Martinos film focuses on atmosphere, Fulcis film goes for straight-up, in your face scares.

The acting in both films is very good, and each cast does a superb job in their roles.  Likewise, the soundtracks of both are mesmerizing and haunting.  I found myself humming both at various points after each film was over.

If I were forced to pick a favorite movie out of this set, I would have to choose Fulcis THE BLACK CAT.  Im a big fan of his work to start with, so my selection might be biasedbut I prefer the horrifying aspects of this in contrast to the slasher vibe of the other.

This EDGAR ALAN POES BLACK CATS collection is a huge win for me, and I recommend it to any fan of horror cinema.",1449014400,,1811,4.374251497005988

Your Vice Is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key Review:

When I started watching Your Vice Is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key (epic name, but will now be referred to as Your Vice), I wasn't entirely sure I was going to like it. It starts off pretty damn weird, with a bunch of hippies dancing around, singing and a guy abusing his wife. All scenes which really don't connect. However, as the movie gets going, the film starts to gel together and by the end, I was hooked big time. I loved how this movie ended, just absolutely loved it. I, of course, won't spoil it for you, but I will go into details on a few things in my review of this phenomenal Blu-ray release from Arrow Video.

As mentioned in my Lucio Fulci's Black Cat review, Your Vice is featured in Arrow's phenomenal Edgar Allan Poe's Black Cats Limited Edition. The Arrow Box set is limited to 3000 copies and comes with an impressive limited edition 80-page booklet containing new articles on the films, Lucio Fulcis last ever interview and a reprint of Poes original story. The box set contains the two films in a nice hard cardboard case and each film also has reversible sleeves showcasing the original and newly commissioned artwork. It's a stellar package and worth the price.

MOVIE

Besides both movies in the box set being based on Edgar Allan Poe's Black Cat story (or freely based in Your Vice's case), the two movies don't have much in common, save for a black cat. Your Vice does do a better job at adapting the story a little more closely, with a few twists and turns along the way, which I loved. Some of the plot points are a little out there and placed in there just to confuse you and make you think one thing is happening when actually something else entirely is taking place. It actually works once the film's end credits roll around, so you just got to stick with the flick to have everything figured out.

I do want to mention how much sexuality is coursing through this movie's veins. There are copious amounts of nudity, lesbian love scenes and a tiny dash of incest. Edwige Fenech, who plays Floriana is basically in the movie to seduce every single person and boy, does she do an amazing job at it. I can't blame anyone for wanting to sleep with her, as she emits raw sexual energy whenever she is on screen.

I wish I go could into more detail with Your Vice, but mentioning anything specific would ruin the experience and that would be a damn shame with this movie. Besides a shaky beginning and some random scenes that make no sense, Your Vice works to tell a fantastic, twisty tale that does justice to Poe's story.

BLU-RAY

Pretty much a perfect experience with Arrow's Blu-ray release. The video is phenomenal, the audio is blissful and the features are plentiful. I can't say one negative thing about this disc. In fact, the entire package of Black Cats boxed-set is to die for and every bit of money they are asking, which, yes, is pricey, is worth every penny.

Your Vice features a good helping of lengthy interviews with cast and crew members. The features don't just talk about Your Vice, but also about Sergio Martino's impressive career. I really enjoyed the sit down with Eli Roth and how Martino's work has inspired him. It's all great stuff and worth the watch. Oddly enough, though, no commentary is included.

VERDICT

Of the two movies, Your Vice was the one I enjoyed the most. It had plenty of flesh to look at, gore to please and twists to thrill you. Overall, it was a fantastic flick and I think if you give it a chance, you'll agree. And what better way to do that than with the superb Arrow Black Cat's Boxed-set. Pick it up today!

Lucio Fulci's Black Cat Review:

Lucio Fulci's The Black Cat is featured in Arrow's phenomenal Edgar Allan Poe's Black Cats Limited Edition, which also features the fantastically named Sergio Martino film Your Vice is a Locked Room and Only I Have the Key. The Arrow Box set is limited to 3000 copies and comes with an impressive limited edition 80-page booklet containing new articles on the films, Lucio Fulcis last ever interview and a reprint of Poes original story. The box set contains the two films in a nice hard cardboard case and each film also has reversible sleeves showcasing the original and newly commissioned artwork. It's a stellar package and worth the price. Now, with that said, let's get on with the review of Fulci's The Black Cat, which is a very loose adaptation of Poe's Black Cat short story.

MOVIE

If there is one thing you are guaranteed when you watch a Fulci movie, it's a flick that is damn hard to follow. The Black Cat starts off with so many random scenes, I had no idea where this film was headed. We've got a killer cat, a couple making out in a locked room (yay, boobies!), a man listening to screaming, and a cat attacking him; the same man recording dead people at a cemetery, whilst an unknown man listens on in the background; and finally a woman taking photos and finding a tomb full of skeletons. What in the hell is happening?!? Thankfully, things start to level out once David Warbeck's Detective character comes in and we get to the actual story. Unfortunately, The Black Cat still has scenes that lead absolutely nowhere. I'm not entirely sure why Fulci decided to include these useless scenes in the movie, as they add nothing of value, but here they are. Even if you ignore all the random talking to dead / hidden tombs subplots, you still get a movie that is all over the place.

The Black Cat borrows its ideas from a lot of different Poe tales, not just the story it's titled after. Film historian Stephen Thrower in the special features does a great job at breaking down different areas that Fulci and writer Biagio Proietti borrowed from. You have bits and pieces of other Poe stories mixed in with some ideas from The Black Cat story. It's a smorgasbord of Poe fic to keep you interested, even if it's all nonsense when you come to the end.

Fulci fans might end up being slightly turned off by the lack of gore. Fulci is known for the gore, but The Black Cat is super light on the red and gooey. It's got a few kills and one hilarious scene involving a flailing prop that is supposed to be a woman. Because the film lacks the messy stuff, fans are going to pass on it, but I think that would be the wrong thing to do as the film is still very much a Fulci flick. The cinematography by Sergio Salvati is fantastic and beautiful and the music by Pino Donaggio is a delight, especially the main title. You most certainly will end up being confused come the end credits, but it wouldn't be a Fulci flick without a little head scratching going on.

BLU-RAY

As I've already mentioned, The Black Cat is included in Arrow's box set, which is crammed full of value. Besides a few scratches and some random film degradation, The Black Cat is looking wonderful. The audio, which is Uncompressed PCM Mono, is also well done, with no obvious issues. The features are very much welcome, with the 25 minute sit down with film historian Stephen Thrower being my fav of all included, as it goes in-depth into the movie, whereas the other features are wider and non-specific. You also have a visit to the filming locations, a career-spanning interview with actress Dagmar Lassander and the biggest the feature on the disc, an hour long interview with actor David Warbeck, who reminisces about Fulci, as he smokes his life away. Rounding all that out is a commentary with filmmaker and Fangoria editor Chris Alexander and a trailer.

VERDICT

The Black Cat is a confusing flick, but one that is still beautiful to watch. It may not be Fulci at his best, but fans should still check it out, especially if you have a hankering for Poe tales. The Arrow Blu-ray is just one-half of the awesome Black Cats box set and there is nothing wrong with the disc in my opinion. This flick and Blu comes highly recommended.",1447977600,2,8659,4.591968911917099
