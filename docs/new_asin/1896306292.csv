202258,4,1896306292,"A good many of the reviewers missed the point of the movie.  Sheen is representing a Church after Vatican IV.  (There was only Vatican II).  The Church no longer believes what it teaches and the only faithful Catholics are on the Island, but they are led by a shaky, though urbane Abbot.  The movie is about obediance, but there are various problems with it.  Obediance, never means violating your rights as a human.  You cannot be forced to do evil.  Trevor Howard (the abbot) in the end realizes that he lives in a hell of his own creation.

Recommended for all Catholics, who should be able to see, that while liberation theology was declared a heresy, the Latin Mass is in revival.

Very good movie, requires some knowledge of doctrine.",1128470400,9,740,4.630769230769231

This film is one of the best studies of tradition vs progressive influence I have ever come across!  The film creates a sympathy for Pre-Vatican II Catholicism by creating a fictional future crisis that has just a hint of honesty about it.  The message (propaganda) intended by the director is just as interesting as the well-acted drama.

It doesn't matter if the topic is pre vs post Vatican II, or fundamental vs liberal Protestantism, or Republican vs Democrat issues, etc.  The combinations of emotions and propaganda are similar in most ideological conflicts.

I've now watched this film 5 times in the past 3 weeks and have shown it to several other people.  I find that just watching the film with someone generates a strange mixture of emotions and discussion.

The cost is cheap enough.  Do yourself a favor and order this film today.",1107561600,12,927,4.853503184713376
202261,4,1896306292,"The landscape of an island of Ireland, the music, and the subject of this movie prompts introspection in one's religious behavior, what is meaningful in such behavior, what is not.
Add to that the question of conflict of personal BELIEF with OBEDIENCE to church dogma and you have the makings of a heavy story, which the actors and director delivered in an ""excellent"" manner, and I rated it a ""4"" as a result.
There is an emotional and intellectual hangover produced by getting involved with the film, so beware. It is NOT just ENTERTAINMENT. It should make you THINK about your FAITH and the practice of it.

202262,5,1896306292,"This made-for-TV movie from 1973 was shown full-length on U.S. public broadcasting stations in the 1970s. It is a visually and intellectually impressive film. The story line is very faithful to the 1972 book ""Catholics"" by Brian Moore, with only a couple of scenes sequenced differently, and in my opinion, rather more effectively than in the book.  Unfortunately, later VHS versions have been shortened, with about the first ten minutes of the original film deleted. This DVD version shares the same significant defect.
The first few minutes of the original film were essential in setting the context for the conflict portrayed between the traditionalist Irish monks led by their Father Abbot (Trevor Howard), and the modernist representative (Martin Sheen) of their order's Vatican Father General. During these missing first few minutes, we would have seen Sheen meeting with the Father General (Raf Vallone) in Rome, and discussing the ""problem"" of the return of Latin Mass celebration by the monks of Howard's abbey and the growing world-wide popularity of that celebration. The first scene made it clear that the time period portrayed is hypothetical and futuristic. In this fabulous Roman Catholic Church, additional modifications and liberalization of doctrine are supposed to have taken place beyond those that have been in effect since Vatican II. Within the film, there are mentions of a ""Vatican IV"" and other hypothetical conventions. Missing the original initial scene, many may believe that the film has grossly erred in, or deliberately distorted, current Roman Catholic beliefs. This was not the motive of the movie as originally filmed, and it is a tremendous loss to the integrity of the original story that the vital first scene of the movie has been edited away. However, this does explain the crediting of Raf Vallone as Father General at the start and end of the film, when in fact Raf Vallone/Father General never appears in the VHS or DVD versions.  It would be well worthwhile to read the first chapter of the book before seeing a shortened home video release, if at all possible.
The DVD video quality is disappointing. The color is washed out, and in several scenes it is strangely yellow-tinted. It is definitely inferior to my ten-year-old VHS copy issued by USA Home Video. The sound is occasionally clipped, with words lost in several places. Not so my VHS copy. The original film title was ""Catholics, A Fable"" but the cryptic title of ""The Conflict"" has been used for the DVD. The DVD also contains an idiotic special feature in the form of an interactive quiz about the movie content. One may entertain one's self with such challenging questions as ""What was on the sign carried by the man in the brown suit?"" or ""What color was the priest's car?"" The quiz even has incorrect answers!
In spite of these problems, I state without reservation that this DVD is well worth owning. Since Vatican II there has existed a Roman Catholic traditionalist movement that today seems to have more Vatican-sanctioned success than would ever have been thought possible at the time this film was made. Some have tried to relate the events portrayed in this film to that movement. But by movie's end, this film actually depicts far more important issues of religious belief, and its loss. This is a film, like the book, that will be of interest to anyone, of whatever faith or none, for whom philosophy of religion is of interest.
The acting by Trevor Howard is absolutely flawless and authentic. It is art and it is masterful and it is heartfelt and it is beautiful. Almost equally so is that of Cyril Cusack, who plays the role of Father Manus, a monk. Sheen's role is important, but not nearly as much as Howard's, and not remotely as well-crafted.
This is as intelligent and entertaining a film today as it was when it was made 30 years ago. Let us hope someone in the near future will gather an old PBS copy of the complete film, digitally re-master it, and finally give us a proper and fitting version of this film. I know of no other film that deserves it so much.",1044835200,104,4087,4.862266857962697
202263,5,1896306292,"If you're an early Baby Boomer born and raised a Roman Catholic, then you'll likely appreciate the 1973 film CATHOLICS. If you're of any other faith, or a Catholic born later than, say, 1960, then the movie may be of only academic interest. Indeed, if you're a young Catholic today, then the issues around which the plot pivots may not be comprehensible at all.

A youthful Martin Sheen plays a priest sent by Rome to an Irish monastery located on an isolated, windswept island. His mission, to demand that the monks cease and desist celebrating the Mass in Latin. The Vatican hierarchy is attempting to modernize the Mass worldwide, i.e. have it celebrated in the vernacular, as well as promote the new policy that the Transubstantiation of the bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ is symbolic, not real. Trouble is, the monastery's priests have been celebrating the Mass on the mainland in the traditional manner. More to the point, the ceremony has been televised, and is causing a pious, revivalist stir among the faithful. The pencil pushing prelates back in Rome are not pleased with this political incorrectness.

The marvelous actor Trevor Howard plays the crusty, wise, spiritually troubled, monastery abbot, who must find a way to obey the dictate of the enforcer sent down from the Big House, while avoiding a rebellion among the monks, who consider the emissary's message an abomination, and he himself disconcertingly trendy. (Faith and begorrah, he doesn't even wear the traditional, Roman clerical collar!)

Are you still with me on this, or have I lost you? If I haven't, God bless ya, darlin'. In any case, all of the acting performances are wonderful, especially Howard's. The character actors portraying the abbot's cowled flock were chosen with pure genius. And the wild Irish coastal scenery ... ah, `tis St. Patrick's own, surely.

As I said up front, you had to be born a Papist prior to 1960, as I was, to understand what the fuss was all about. I well remember the horror with which my mother regarded the vernacular Mass. To this day, she'll seek out the Latin Mass in those rare places - sort of a doctrinal Underground - where it's still celebrated. Mom, this review is dedicated to you.

P.S. 4/20/14  It has come to my attention that this film is alternatively titled THE CONFLICT.",976665600,54,2323,4.838790931989925
202264,5,1896306292,"Trevor Howard and Martin Sheen star in this portrayal of an attempt to completely destroy the Catholic Church.  Trevor Howard is the abbot of an Irish monastary that continues the two thousand years of the Roman Latin  Rite of the Church.  People come from all over the world to participate in  the last of the Roman Latin Rite Masses and the Vatican (Vatican V) wants  to put an end to it.  The Vatican sends a priest, Martin Sheen, as emissary  to end the latin Mass.

202265,4,1896306292,"Catholics begins as a rather melodramatic film presenting a group of fanatical monks on an island off Ireland - an island off an island - who refuse to follow the Vatican's orders to give up the Latin mass in favor of  a liturgy in English.  Martin Sheen arrives on the island, with strict  orders in hand that the monks obey the Vatican, no questions asked.  How  the monks dramatize their grievances against the Holy See is not, however,  the true climax of the film.  Trevor Howard, the Father Superior of the  sect, confesses to Martin Sheen that he's been unable to pray because of a  crisis of faith he suffered at Lourdes several years prior.  Sheen wonders  why he hasn't requested a transfer or retirement.  Howard tells him how  important he and the other monks are to the islanders, and that their  community work is more important than his inability to pray.  By the close  of the film, with Sheen exiting in his Helicopter as all the monks are  gathered below, buffetted by the wake of the propeller blades, the very  real and moving drama of one man's crisis of faith, made all the more  moving by Trevor Howard, becomes painfully real for us.",959644800,8,1157,4.583333333333333
202266,3,1896306292,"This is a film about blind obedience to unlawful orders. Alternatively, one might consider this film a microcosmic dramatization of Zbigniew Brzezinski's observation (in his book, Between Two Ages): ""Shortly, the public will be unable to reason or think for themselves. They'll only be able to parrot the information they've been given on the previous night's news.""

The film starts with a small group of Irishmen assembling at a Mass Rock along the windy Irish coast. Of course, the Irish did this a great deal in past when the protestant English government outlawed the Latin Mass in Ireland. But in this case it is the Vatican itself that has outlawed the Latin Mass, these Irishmen being the last remnant of Roman Catholics left assembling to celebrate the Latin Mass, Martin Sheen has been sent from Rome with the emphatic mission to stomp out this last vestige of authentic Roman Catholicism - the only authentic Roman Catholicism apparently left on earth. Once these orthodox Irish priests and laity have been silenced, the latest novelties of Vatican IV can be fully implemented without further hindrance. That's the plot.

This 1973 film was made in the decade following the heretical inventions and novelties of Vatican II. It was at Vatican II, an illegitimate robber council led by antipope Paul VI, and driven by anathematized Modernists such as Fr. Ratzinger and Fr. Wojtya - themselves subsequent antipopes - that an attempt was made to destroy Roman Catholicism by substituting anathematized novelties of Freemasonry and Modernism for its authentic teachings. Of course, antipopes - illegitimately elected popes - are nothing new to Roman Catholicism; there have been around forty these last two thousand years. And of course robber councils teaching heresy are nothing new to Roman Catholicism either - there have been dozens. See, for example,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tumultuous-Times-The-Twenty-General-Councils-of-the-Catholic-Church-and-Vatican-II-and-Its-Aftermath/dp/0971506108/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tumultuous Times: The Twenty General Councils of the Catholic Church and Vatican II and Its Aftermath</a>. What made Vatican II unique in two thousand years of Roman Catholicism was the massive acceptance the apostasy received - due largely to modern mastery of the arts of mass communication and mass propaganda. Or possibly the time was just right for it: As predicted by Our Lady of La Salette in 1847, ""Rome will lose the faith and become the seat of the antichrist. The Church will be in eclipse."" (See&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Our-Lady-of-Good-Success-History-Miracles-Prophecies-DVD/dp/B00320P9BU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Our Lady of Good Success History, Miracles & Prophecies (DVD)</a>.) All this is the background for appreciating the plot.

This fictional film, set in Ireland, deals with the very real and very non-fictional eclipse of Roman Catholicism, dramatizing its final stages of obscuration and apostasy following a robber council called ""Vatican IV"". Vatican IV has seen to it that Lourdes has been ""closed down"", private confessions have been eliminated, transubstantiation no longer is Roman Catholic dogma, the Mass is merely a pious ritual said in the vernacular, priests primarily are social workers agitating for social justice, etc. If this sounds eerily modern to you, you're correct.

The film examines blind obedience to superiors' unlawful orders - and why the Roman Catholic Church has always taught that such obedience is not nor ever can be due - in fact MUST be refused. See, for example, Pope Paul IV's 1559 apostolic bull ""Cum ex Apostolatus Officio"". The film also examines betrayal of those to whom we owe duty - for the duty of obedience implies the duty of lawful responsibility from those in charge; there is not, nor can ever be, obedience owed to an unlawful superior or to a superior acting unlawfully. The ending is silently eloquent and very memorable, which I will not touch upon lest I spoil the film for you. To fully appreciate this film, it helps to have read or at least be familiar with the book by Fr. James Wathen&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Great-Sacrilege/dp/0983356106/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Great Sacrilege</a>.",1398988800,3,4363,5.7912772585669785

202276,5,1896306292,"When I was about 18 years old I watched a terrific TV movie called  ""The Conflict"" (1973) starring Martin Sheen, Trevor Howard, Raf Vallone, and directed by Jack Gold. It's set in a fictional future after ""Vatican IV"".  The drama is about a remote Irish monastery which has resumed offering the Mass in Latin and is drawing crowds from around the world.  The Monks are thrilled with the renewal of faith they have promoted and are quite upset that the hierarchy would try to stop them.  A very young and handsome Martin Sheen plays an American priest from the order's Vatican headquarters who is sent in to shut down this scandalous Mass lest the publicity interfere with the exciting new merger of the Catholics and the Zen Buddhists.

a few years ago I watched this movie again and discovered a whole new message. I noticed it was subtitled ""A Fable"".  I now believe this movie wasn't even about the Catholic Church, but rather, was a study about profound dilemmas involving conscience and obedience in the Vietnam War.

202277,1,1896306292,"I believe that it was in 1973, the year that I finished grade school, that this film was shown on broadcast television.  I vividly recall seeing this film - and being confused by it!  After seeing it again yesterday afternoon, I cannot say that it is NOT a confused and confusing film (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Catholics/dp/B000R9AKR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Catholics</a>&nbsp;(which was apparently also released as ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Conflict/dp/B0007XSXFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Conflict</a>"") was produced by Barry Levinson, and - by a strange coincidence - I had also been watching episodes of Levinson's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Homicide-Life-on-the-Street/dp/B002BLNGTS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Homicide: Life on the Street</a>)....

The Conflict/Catholics is set at an unspecified time in the near future.  Young Martin Sheen (He of the exceptionally high rising pompadour) portrays an American priest on assignment from the Vatican, to deal with a group of monks in Western Ireland who refuse to go along with liturgical changes which came along after Vatican II (It should be noted that this  film does NOT appear to evidence an understanding of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sacrosanctum-Concillium/dp/B0017G974G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sacrosanctum Concillium</a>, Vatican II's document on the sacred liturgy.).

In an early conversation between the priest characters of Sheen and Trevor Howard (Father Abbot), we learn that Sheen's character seems to be a fan of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Liberation-Theology/dp/089870006X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Liberation Theology</a>&nbsp;(though I can't recall that term actually being used).  He actually states that he sees the Faith as needing to address the betterment of mankind's earthly condition, INSTEAD of ""saving souls"" (To avoid confusion on this point, please, please see the Vatican's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Compendium-of-the-Social-Doctrine-of-the-Church/dp/1574556924/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church</a>.).  As the film progresses, we realize that the liturgical ""changes"" have gone way off track and are truly heretical, actually denying&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/transubstantiation/dp/1574557203/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">transubstantiation</a>!  Should the monks go along with such or be disobedient to their vows?  That seems to be ""The Conflict"" of ""Catholics.""

In an attempt to leave its audience with some additional seeds of confusion, we learn that Father Abbot has quietly abandoned his own prayer life. The film appears to be promoting a false dichotomy of a pre Vatican II and post Vatican II Church (For theological clarity, it would have been better served by waiting two decades and being informed by the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Catechism/dp/0385508190/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Catechism</a>).

In a recent National Catholic Register interview, Sheen (who chose his stage name after Archbishop Fulton Sheen) was asked about his own ""reversion to the Catholic faith.""  As per Sheen: ""It began after my illness in the Philippines while filming Apocalypse Now. I began going to church because I was afraid of dying. Then I stopped going for a long time. My eyes were first reopened when I was in India filming Gandhi. Then, in 1981, while in Paris, I read the book The Brothers Karamazov. I had been given the book by director Terrence Malick. The book kept me up. After reading it, I went to see a priest and told him I wanted to come home. He looked at me with eyes that said, 'This is what I do.' He told me to return the next day at 4pm, as he had a wedding at 4:30pm. He told me not to be late. I went to confession with him and wept. I came back to a Church that was very different. I left a Church of fear and returned to a Church of love"" (Tim Drake, 9/14/11).

If I am interpreting the above comments correctly, Sheen seems be suffering from the misunderstanding that sees a dichotomy between the Church before Vatican II and after Vatican II!  May I suggest that he may be watching too many of his own old films?  For the rest of us, it's vital to remember that he is an actor and NOT a religious leader.",1318118400,6,5009,6.705246913580247

202282,1,1896306292,"The book on which this was based, was written by an atheist.  Given that the general topic is one of Catholicism, you should have a good idea that there is an agenda to this movie.

The disguise is the controversy of Vatican II.  The sheep in wolf's clothing is the false dichotomy which is presented, which is that between faithless, soulless traditionalism, and faithless, soulless, Catholic-branded, happy atheism/Marxism, AKA liberation theology.

The primary character is a priest who stands for ""Christianity Lite"", which does little more than appeal to the ego.  Literally.  The secondary character is an abbot who is a traditionalist without any belief in God.  I cannot so much as call them protagonist and antagonist, because, ultimately, they are on the same side.  This is spoon-fed to the audience as the priest tears up the resignation letter of the atheist abbot.

Caught in the middle are the faithful monks.  Pay no attention to them, though; they are characters good for little more than acting weak and ignorant, and bringing cafeteria trays of food to the main characters.

Introduced in the middle is the concept of social justice.  Priests are partaking in the violent overthrow of governments in South America.  The word change is used repeatedly.  Glorious, unspecified change replaces traditional values.  Sound familiar?

The message is summed up in some lines at the end of the movie: ""Yes, prayer is the only miracle.  If our words become prayer, God will come.""  Get it?  ""The only miracle is the existence of people so remarkably stupid as to believe in a sky daddy, a sky daddy invented by the wishful thinking behind prayer.""",1279065600,14,1657,5.003663003663004

202288,2,1896306292,"I share many of the reservations of Mr Alcuin Reid over this film, which he so ably pointed out in his review.  I had seen this on television in 1973 and remember that it left a queasy feeling in my stomach and a sense of hopelessness.

But I was very young then and thought that I had better now, 36 years later, see it again in the light of subsequent reflection.  After viewing it I now recall why it made me feel the way it did in 1973.  As Reid points out, it leaves the issues unresolved.

This is, alas, a cut version of the film, the crucial opening sequence with Raf Vallone having been eliminated.  Yet knowing what was in that opening, and recognizing that several important points were made there, I doubt it would have affected my overall opinion that much.  The crux of the problem with this film is its treatment of the Father Matthew character, played well by that wonderful actor, Andrew Keir.  He is sort of made out to be a villain, not in the classic sense of course, but in his strongly worded objections to the abandonment of the ancient Mass.  The film makers give the character no opportunity to state his case.  Granted Mr Keir's stern features make him ideal casting for such a part as written.  However, that is no excuse for the writer and director not to use the character more intelligently, to use his strengths as an actor to show the seriousness of the issues involved.  Father Matthew, in Keir's able hands, could have been used to air the issues plainly for the audience to hear and comprehend.  He could have played off brilliantly against Trevor Howard's doubting Father Abbott.  But, alas, he was merely to be portrayed as a hothead and an irritant to Howard, a gadfly to be ignored.

Equally wasted in a similar manner was Cyril Cusack, another superior actor who was at least allowed a few moments of genuine pathos in a touching defense of the traditions of Catholicism.  Had the writer and director been thoroughly honest with their audience they would surely have allowed Cusack and Keir - even with their srikingly different personalities - to present the unshakable case for the maintaining of the devastatingly beautiful Latin Mass.  It is a testimony to the skill of these players that they were able to do so much with so little.  But, oh, what they could have done with a more perceptive script!

Others have pointed out the ambiguity in the Trevor Howard character and here, I believe, is where a golden opportunity was missed.  There is nothing wrong with showing a priest who has doubts (as was done superbly by Henry Fonda in John Ford's THE FUGITIVE) but there is no reason whatever why these doubts should not have been aired in the film clearly - at best in a confrontational dialog scene between the Father Abbott character and either Cusack or Keir.  Had that been done, and done fairly, it would have elevated the film greatly.  But as it now stands, and notwithstanding Howard's beautiful performance, it simply makes no sense that a non-believer would have all this time kept saying the traditional Latin Mass if he no longer accepted its fundamental premise.  In real life, many of these doubters happily abandoned the traditional Mass even before the ink was dry on Pope Paul VI's catastrophically stupid decree introducing the new rite forty sad years ago.  The writer and director have the Howard character merely fall back on the ""obedience"" issue and pretty much leave it at that, thereby missing another golden opportunity to discuss the very real problem of being forced to obey an unjust decision by a superior.  This could have been made into compelling drama.

I suppose one could hardly expect producers Glazier and Levinson, and director Gold, to have really grasped the seriousness of the issues involved, nor do I suspect they have any sympathy with the Catholic Church.  Their combined filmographies hardly reflect delicacy, good taste and grappling with issues in a forthright way.  So the film is about as good as you're going to get from such a crew.

I won't recommend that the story be remade properly because, quite simply, there are no longer actors around with the same capabilities as Howard, Cusack, Keir and the rest.  Martin Sheen's part could be played by any of the hacks and amateurs now gracing our movie screens but try to find someone with the stature of Trevor Howard, Andrew Keir and Cyril Cusack.  Forget it.

An interesting film to watch, and, yes, it did have some good scenes and excellent acting, but what a grand opportunity went down the drain thanks to a writer a director and a couple of producers who really didn't know what they were doing.",1260144000,5,4648,4.7
202289,1,1896306292,"I love this movie. It's not just about the Latin Mass. It's about a totalitarian organization that can change its citizens' beliefs by simply contradicting what has been sold to them as truth. Martin Sheen and Travor Howard are outstanding, as is the supporting cast of monks.

The technical quality was awful. I remember seeing the movie on PBS. The island and the monastery were beautiful and nothing had been cut. The first part of the movie with the Father General was cut in this version. The picture is grainy, the sound is filled with static. I keep looking for a clean copy of this film and I can't find it.",1246406400,6,615,4.54054054054054
202290,4,1896306292,"This is a depressing, but still interesting movie that explores some of the results of Vatican II. Whether you are totally behind Vatican II and feel that the mass should be done in English, or you belong to that break off church that refused to acknowledge Vatican II, and does the mass in Latin (and facing away from the people) to this day, you should find the movie interesting.

Amongst other things, we see that changes and progressions are inevitable, but we also wonder if they should tear people from their  foundations and traumatize them. Trevor Howard puts it quite well when he says: ""Yesterday's orthodoxy is today's heresy.""

Basically, Martin Sheen is a priest sent from Rome to convince an Irish church that stubbornly holds onto the Latin Mass to 'get with today's program.' It is also interesting that while Martin Sheen is a priest, he carries the aura of an FBI agent. (If I may be permitted a personal remark, I almost expected him to pull out an FBI badge.)

Trevor Howard is the leader of the Pre Vatican II stronghold. And he defends his position with careful elegance. Though we do get the impression that he is hiding something. Michael Gambon and Cyril Cusack (in their small roles) offer interesting defenses for their stronghold.

I don't want to ruin the movie for those of you who haven't seen it, but while one turnout of the movie is predictable, there are interesting surprises that unfold.

One word of warning: If you are having struggles with your faith, you should probably avoid this movie.",1238025600,6,1530,4.754716981132075
202291,2,1896306292,"For the Catholic Church the rigorous imposition of the ""new"" Mass in the 1970's was not without its cost. Generations raised on God-centred worship in a sacred language according to familiar rituals developed over the centuries found themselves looking at, talking to and even touching each other at Mass in what sometimes appeared to be more of a community meeting rather than the worship of Almighty God.

There is much more that can, should, and has indeed been said about these issues, but it is against this background of radical change that the 1973 film 'The Catholics' - newly released on DVD - is set.

However, it is also set in a `future' Church where a Fourth Vatican Council exists in Holland exercising some ecumenical (in the inter-denominational sense) oversight of the Church, and when the Church has prohibited personal confession and has indeed formally abandoned the doctrine of transubstantiation, declaring the Eucharistic bread and wine to be mere symbols. The turbulence of the Church in the 1970's may well have provoked concerns that the she was heading toward these stances - at least in the minds of some - but she did not.

This detracts from the film, for whilst it does rehearse many of the controversies faced by Catholics of that period (though not at all in depth: the compelling issue of the crisis of personal faith in the Abbot - most ably played by Trevor Howard - is but mentioned), it also exorcises demons that never materialised and which are of no concern to us today. Were it to have invested in the critical issues of obedience to authority verses obedience to tradition, or to explore the popular attachment to the `old Latin Mass' in greater depth, portraying the varied stances of clergy and laity alike in those years, it would have much more value now. Its `accuracy' in portraying monastic life is amusingly awry in places.

The film ends with the Abbot's rather weak capitulation to the demands of the authorities (personified by a young Martin Sheen as the lay-clad Father Kinsella, who simply does not seem to have anything at all in common with the monks he is sent to investigate), that his community adopt the ""new"" Mass. The final scene is ambiguous in its portrayal of the anguish in which they are subsequently left.

That Pope Benedict has since `resolved' the issue that motivated the film's production in that tumultuous period is a reason to be thankful. It is only a pity that those looking back at this period through 'The Catholics', whilst they may well find it to be of interest, will find here neither a profound nor an accurate portrayal of it.",1232236800,11,2615,4.802222222222222
202292,3,1896306292,"Perhaps I'd understand it better with an additional viewing, but I don't find this movie important enough to motivate me to that action. There are enough real dramas and battles in the real, present-day Church to keep one's attention for 100 years. However, I would very much like to one day discover the intent of this curious movie.

After a fictional ""Vatican IV"" further revolutionizes the Church, Martin Sheen (playing an ultra-modern, Marxist-type priest) is sent to remotest Ireland to bring a group of Traditionalist monks into line with the new de-Catholicized Catholic church. The monks are understandably resistant, and there are some interesting exchanges between the revolutionary and the traditionalists, but the Abbot, who privately admits to a lack of faith, eventually orders them to submit to Rome, rather than defy the abomination of desolation. What exactly is the point of this movie? Is it a modernist message, that the Church must acquiesce to the zeitgeist in order to survive and be relevant? Is it a traditionalist message, that the true Faith would thrive were it not undermined by its leaders? Or is there any message at all? Beats me.",1187222400,3,1163,5.0890052356020945

202294,5,1896306292,"This film is set in a fictional future that takes place after at least two more ecumenical Council's, Vatican IV. A movie that may have been ahead of its time is so relevant today. It shows the difference in thought between the prevalent belief after the above councils of those who believe the Church should be used for social revolution and ecumenism instead of saving souls.

A group of traditional Catholics in a remote monastery perform the Pre-Vatican II Latin Mass. And because it becomes world famous, it becomes a problem to Rome. This is the setting when the movie starts. Martin Sheen plays the Modern Neo-Catholic Priest whose job it is to censer the Mass. And Trevor Howard plays the abbot who has lost his faith but is obedient.

Cyril Cusak plays his role with ardor and believability. I think he does the best acting job in this film and his performance is thought provoking. And places the conflict within the church in plain understandable words. A must see for any Catholic.",1140480000,15,993,4.734104046242774
202295,5,1896306292,"Excellent movie that tackles the purpose of the church - social justice versus saving souls; the Eucharist being merely symbolic rather than a sacrament; and the struggle between the emptying social revolutionary church and the resurgence of orthodoxy drawing people in.  I don't think the writers and producers of this film could have had any idea of how prophetic this film would be.

I bought this film for at a dollar store next door to a Chinese buffet where my family ate lunch today.  Unbelievable movie; must see for any Episcopalian, Roman Catholic, or other Christian in today's church.

Great actors too:  Trevor Howard plays a traditionalist monk/abbot who has lost his faith (might as well have been Bishop Spong), Martin Sheen who plays the with it social revolutionary priest sent to suppress the latin mass and the priest and people facing east being performed by the Irish monks, and Cyril Cusak who plays a priest of firm conviction in Jesus Christ and the mass.

What truly struck me is the conflict between the vows of obedience given to hierarchical churches, from laity to bishops, and conscience and faith.  What also struck me is that all these supposed innovations in our church that were supposed to draw people in, for some reason, empty the churches, and that orthodox resurgence tends to attract quite a following.  We see this now in the Episcopal Church as well as others.",1138492800,7,1403,4.890295358649789

Several coincidences between this film and our present state of decay in the Catholic Church.

1. Transubstantiation is being denied by many Catholics.
2. Yoga and Eastern rituals have infiltrated the faith.
3. Social Revolution has been the perogative of Dioceses worldwide.
4. The priesthood is completely horizontal with the laity.
5. The priesthood no longer wears vestments worthy of their Office.
6. Ecumenism has taken priority over salvation of souls.
7. Faithlessness in Christ and the Church is rampant among the clergy, theologians and teachers, to the point where some speculate there is no hell, it might be empty and Christ might not have resurrected or even existed.
8. Obedience is insisted to the point of papalotry.
9. Heresy is non-existant as nonCatholics are merely imperfectly united with Catholics.
10. The only groups that don't deserve respect according to most conservative Catholics are Traditionalists!
11. As prophecised the Lord has been taken out of the Holy of Holies and one has to look and try to find him.
12. The Tridentine Mass is suppressed!!! Yes, it was at the Diocesan level for decades, until the Commission under Cardinal Stickler proved the Mass of Ages was not banned, only to be allowed under special permission from the local Bishop!!! This permission is still denied across Dioceses across the nation, and even when given, does not include all the Sacraments!

This last is what this movie is about. It is a shock to the senses to watch this movie and contrast it with today.

I give it 4 stars because of the technical flaws with the film, however it is so inexpensive, it is worth buying!! It is an eye opener.",1128816000,8,1871,4.9113924050632916

We view film as art and most modern works, as well as most things in colour, seem to be of a rather low caliber, but this seemingly trite film is a fitting parody of real figures in the Church during the Vatican II revolution. One really senses the oddness of those who were not keeping up with the times in the almost annoying and seemingly overzealous characters at odds with the revolutionaries, as well as the inner turmoil of those in authority who were caught in the middle of obeying their superiors and tending to their flock, as well as the foreshadowing of how the battle was eventually lost on the public level, through false obedience and the loss of faith, resulting in the real life Conciliar Church, which is not Catholic.

 Martin Sheen plays the young radical priest role quite well, and is, hence, rather unidentifiable as one. The final scene sums it all up quite nicely, the loss of faith in face of the Modernist questioning of it, and the inner turmoil and spiritual claustrophobia it has created in the hierarchy (in the character of Trevor Howard as the Abbott) is easily perceived.  One can sense the submerged histrionics of the poor soul trying to pray at the end. Pretty great for a made-for-TV movie.",1420416000,7,1343,4.610878661087866
