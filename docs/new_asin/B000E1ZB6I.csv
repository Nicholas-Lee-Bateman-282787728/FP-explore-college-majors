2483668,3,B000E1ZB6I,"Princess Valkyrie is a beutiful, angelic-like creature whom is trapped inside the body of an eight year old girl (acts like a brat). Valkyrie is in love with a young boy named Kazuto, though Kazuto does not fully grasp it. Valkyrie can tranform into a older version of herself only with a magical kiss between her and Kazuto. She will be in her older version for a few minutes then revert back to her kiddie self. Though there is a sorta big brother/little sister theme to it, the romantic elements do not mesh well and imply something unethical in their relationship. The overall mood of this anime is comical and they use a very colorful pallet to convey this along with the SD(super deformed) design of some characters. Kazuto runs a bathhouse which seems unrealistic to the story and more of a vehicle to bring in the fan service into the show. So you will see lots of naked creatures in the bathhouse in each episode, though no sex is ever present. The series seeems to be aimed at girls, but then it is contridicted by the amount of fan service.

The universe in this anime is a cross between sci-fi and fantasy, you'll see aliens, spaceships and fantasy based creatures like; catgirls, sheep women, fairies and demons. They live and act as normal people do and sometimes get into mischief. I really liked the concept here, but it was poorly
executed. By making the alien and fantasy creatures act and live
like regular human, it detracts from novelty of having these unique creatures living among humans. There are twelve episodes over three volumes (discs), contains comedy and nudity. Even though there is no sex in the show, I cannot recommend it to people under 16 years of age because of the fan service. However the mindless nature of the show will repel older viewers and the anime savy. I don't think it's worth a purchase, but makes a good rental. I recommend the animes called ""Oh, My Goddess"" and ""Video Girl Ai"".",1148256000,11,1931,4.629737609329446
2483669,5,B000E1ZB6I,"Though I cannot deny this anime is full of silly moments and lots of fanservice, making it one that it is seemingly more or less geared toward true anime fans, and otaku, it also touches on almost everyone of the genres within anime and I think does an excellent job of it, giving a great if slightly inane story for those that are willing to give this one the chance it deserves. I truly think UFO Ultramaiden Valkyrie will appeal to a lot of people, and a lot more then other reviews seem to believe.

Part of what makes this so special to me is the story which takes place on a Earth where aliens are commonplace, and neko girls (cat girls) are considered to be just as much a part of everyday life as the aliens. It is within this world that Kazuto Tokino decides to run his late grandfather's bathhouse despite protests from his parents and sister who consider it to be a ""money pit"". One night when working in the bathhouse an alien named Princess Valkyrie, who is running from a marriage her parents arranged for her, destroys the bathhouse when her spaceship crashes into it. She also mortally wounds Kazuto, however, she is able to save his life with a magical kiss that gives him half of her soul, and turns her into an 8 year old child. She can return to her adult form by kissing Kazuto, but it only lasts for a short time, and is mostly done when there is a need to protect Kazuto.

Princess Valkyrie is then stranded on Earth in the form of an 8 year old child with the mind of one too, unable to look after herself even though the entire solar system is out searching for her. Kazuto who owes her his life and truly cares for her works to protect this super sweet very hyper Princess Valkyrie from those alien invaders some who are searching for her to bring her back home to the marriage her parents had arranged. Valkyrie meanwhile shows a great and increasing love for Kazuto who shares part of her soul. Further Valkyrie's neko-meido (cat girl maid) Sanada comes to consider Kazuto as Valkyrie's official fiance and helps him to protect Valkyrie.

Personally, one of the things I really like in this anime this switch that can occur in Valkyrie and how her different ""ages"" try to show how much she has come to love Kazuto, one is very sorry for what she has done to him and uses her powers to protect him, and the other, the younger Valkyrie, seems to cling to him jealously perhaps in a way to show how deeply her older self also feels but refuses to admit or cannot admit.

The animation is also stunning in my opinion, and very excellently done for such a short series which does actually have two sequels. Overall I say this is a must see for any anime fan and those looking for a good silly original anime that covers a lot of the genres of all anime within this one series.",1141603200,24,2799,4.35632183908046
2483670,4,B000E1ZB6I,"I had seen a few episodes of this Shoujo Anime on other websites, and when I came across the first 2 seasons on Amazon Prime, I watched them in order.

As the genre claims, Shoujo Anime (and Manga) is aimed at young girls (mostly early teen and pre-teen), and is filled with Love themes and plots, as would appeal to girls who are experiencing puberty and hormonal changes. The main characters usually being involved romantically with each other, and highly stylized (sometimes caricatured) scenes and costumes are featured, all to please a young woman's imagined sense of beauty and style.

This TV series from Japan is no different. Ala ""Sailor Moon"" and other similar titles, the main characters involve aliens who all seem to be young girls with special magical powers who get involved with innocent human youngsters who for some strange reason, always have no parents or adults supervising their daily lives.

The characters then solve daily problems with the uncanny good sense of mature adults. More often they are battling evil from the cosmos, and repeatedly saving mankind from destruction.

In ""UFO Ultramaiden"", the plot centers around a High School Junior and his sister who is still in Junior High. They live alone because their parents have opted to take jobs overseas and leave them behind. In addition, Kazuto Tokino, has decided to keep his late grandfather's Public Bathhouse (Sento, in Japanese) in operation, with he and his sister, Rika Tokino, attempting to balance school, home life, and running the bathhouse by themselves 6 days a week.

In this Anime Universe, aliens are commonplace in the world, and there is an intergalactic space port in operation (and still under construction) near their home in a large metro Japanese city.

The basis of the plot is that one of the 8 royal princesses from the planet Valhalla, by the name of Princess Valkyrie, has run away in her spaceship from a proposed marriage contract. She crashes her ship into the Tokino Family bathhouse and kills Kazuto in the process. Full of remorse, the Princess uses her magical powers to revive Kazuto by endowing him with half of her soul.

He recovers and all is well, except that Valkyrie has now reverted to an 8 year old little girl because she now shares her soul with 16 year old Kazuto. And, their hearts are now in tune with each other, giving them a special bond!

She then becomes a part of their household (and a holy terror).

Add into this Anime formula, a team of Cat Girl Maids who arrive to run the bathhouse and the household; the rival Princess Hydra, who tries to capture her cousin Valkyrie so that she won't have to get married in Valkyrie's place but gets stopped by local Shrine Maiden and longtime childhood friend of Kazuto named Akina also has a crush on Kazuto and has Hydra in her mystical Shrine Maiden control and turned Princess Hydra into an 8 year old child, too. There is also a mother Princess who arrives to oversee the now betrothed couple (Valkyrie and Kazuto), random visits by other cousin Princesses, an occasional random alien, and a hodge podge of school classmates and local characters, which all add up to an Anime  Cosplayer's dream!

This was first broadcast on the Tokyo Broadcasting System's Kid's Channel, and is aimed primarily at the Preteen girl or Tween market. There isn't much to appeal to little boys, but there is some mild violence and allusions to nudity and occasional blurred shots of nudity (in the bathhouse environment).

So I would say that the parents would have to decide for themselves how appropriate this series is for youngsters.

But I will say that there is enough subtle and physical humor in the episodes, to make it entertaining for some adults as well.

So far only seasons 1 & 2 are available an English Dubbed mode for free on Amazon Prime, but seasons 3 & 4 have been dubbed here in the US, and should also be available soon. There are other re-versionings out there, too, but not all versions are currently available on Prime.

A good show for girls who are not yet old enough to date, and suitable for ages of maybe 9-14, and most adults with patience and a sense of humor.",1485820800,4,4157,4.738227146814404

2483697,5,B000E1ZB6I,"A friend suggested I watch this and I love it. It involves a high school boy who is trying frantically to keep a bathhouse that his grandfather started in a city where aliens are commonplace. A giant UFO crashes into his bathhouse and seriously injures him. The occupant is a princess from a planet called Valhalla named Valkyrie.  She sees what happens to him and kisses him and transfers half of her soul to him to save him. He recovers but as a result, she is turned into a very rambunctious little girl and mayhem ensues as he and his younger sister try to care for her.  Since the two of them are attached by the soul exchange, she needs to be around him all the time and insists she is in love with him. Later, her not too pleasant sister comes looking for her and promptly crashes into a temple and begins causing chaos trying to locate her. Then it is discovered that when Valkyrie kisses the boy, she returns to her original form briefly and defeats who or whatever comes their way. Also included is a Cat woman maid that fawns all over Valkyrie and a small army of catgirls,  a rabbit-like creature named Spot that Valkyrie vigourously plays with but who is one of the most powerful warriors in the galaxy

 It's sort of like a cross between Sailor Moon and a lot of the 80's brat pack movies.

 There is also nudity but nothing beyond the daily running of the bathhouse and it only is here and there and last for a couple of seconds. It's also hilarious.

  It's good to see some entertaining anime' that is not endless violence, giant robots or the ones that are played to death on American television

 I REALLY hope Amazon gets seasons 3 and 4",1474588800,4,1657,4.379084967320262

She gives him half her soul to bring him back to life and the fun begins.

2483982,2,B000E1ZB6I,"Okay let me first say that I gave UFO Ultramaiden Valkyrie 2 stars to bring down the rating, because the only over reviewer gave the show five stars. Whcih this show is far from. In truth I would have given it 3 stars since for a fan service anime it's not bad.that said also keep this one out of the paws of people under I'd say 15 since there is a lot of nudity, and I mean a lot.

Now to the actual review. UFO Ultramaiden Valkyrie had a lot of potential, it could have been an excellent series. The art work and animation was amazing. Much of the humor was funny. The basic plot was interesting. The voice acting was rather good. And it could have been quiet moving and romantic. So now you asking why I don't have a four or higher star count on my review. It's simple really the show spends about 10 minutes of each episode showing fan fair. Also the first and second episode should have been switched around so we know why a little girl kisses a grown man and transforms into a woman. Another things was the show would have been realy funny if I didn't find that child Valkyrie a spoiled brat in need of a spanking. Honestly there was nothing cute or funny about her, all she does is throw fits and cause trouble. Second it is really never shown Valkyrie and Kazuto falling for each other, hell the adult Valkyrie only shows up for a few minutes every few episodes. In addition to this the show spends way to much time doing just random things. As a side note I kept wondering how the bath-house could be struggling when it is constantly packed.

So in the end I gues I'm sayign that UFO Ultramaiden Valkyrie could have been a good show if. A.) The series was laid out better. B.)There was less time spent on fan Fair and more on character developement and Plot. C.) If the adlut Valkier should up more so there could be a romance beyond oh and now they love each other because we say so. D.) If there was less random stuff, mean the show was orginally 13 episode long there isn't time for filler and fluff. If it had done all this then I would have easily given this show 4 or maybe even five stars. But it didn't. Now the big question should you buy UFO Ultramaiden Valkyrie Season 1 box set. If you can get it for less the $30 sure why not. If not, avoid like the plague.

Before I go a review of the actual box set itself. The box set is one of ADV's new thin pack packages. Best thing about the box set is the cases are small and don't take up much space. The box for the case is sturdy and well made with nice art work. But that's really all the good things I can say about the box set. Normal I wouldn't recommend getting the box set, like most of the thin box sets. Why you ask? Well for a simple reason is ADV goes threw each disc and removes all of the extra content with the exception of a few trailers on the first disc. This means the textless opening and closings, insert pages even the reversible covers are all gone which sucks big time. This is thpart were I say buy the indivigual discs but this series just ain't worht it. So if You're going to buy it but the box set.",1196208000,8,3093,4.151666666666666
2483983,5,B000E1ZB6I,"It is absolutely awesome in watching this anime. At first, I thought it was all about sexy bodies and cute girls. But it is not only with the 2 ideas.

I have finished watching season one and I will keep watching the other seasons.",1185408000,7,531,4.428571428571429
2483984,5,B000E1ZB6I,"First it should be noted that the continueity of this series is a bit screwy. Episode 1 actually takes place AFTER episodes 2 and 3. To make things less confuseing I'll be describing events as they occur in chronological order.

The show takes place on Earth in an unspecified future date where humanity has come in contact with aliens who now visit our planet and mingle regularly with humans. Kazuto Tokino is a high school boy who runs his late grandpa's bathhouse. His parents (who are never shown) and younger sister Rika think he's wasting his time and that the place is doomed to go out of business, but Kazuto is determined to try to make a living of it. Then one night a spaceship from the planet Valhalla carshes on top of the bathhouse. The pilot is Valkyrie, princess of Valhalla who ran away because she didn't want to be forced to marry a prince for beurocratic reasons rather than for love. In the crash Kazuto his horribly injured and Valhalla must give him part of her soul to save him. This turns her into a child, both physically and mentally. Now she wants to stay and live with Kazuto. The next day Kazuto's old childhood female friend Akina Nanamura stops by with a cake she bought. She sees Valkyrie clinging to Kazuto. The young Valkyrie says she gave Kazuto ""the most precious thing a girl can give"". She means part of her soul, of course, but naturally Akina takes this the wrong way and hits him over the head with the cake and storms out. She returns to the shrine where she works as a shinto priestess, but then another spaceship crashes on top of it. Out comes Hydra, Valkyrie's more aggressive sister who has several powers including being able to fly and fire energy beams. If Valkyrie doesn't return to Valhalla and marry a prince, Hydra will be forced to marry instead. So she's come back to caputre Valkyrie and take her back home so she'll marry. She's shocked to find Valkyrie's turned into a kid, but she resolves to take her back anyway. Kazuto takes Valkyrie and runs off with her. Hydra searches town for them. Kazuto and Valkyrie hide in his old elementary school. Things are quiet for awhile, but then Hydra finds them and attacks. Valkyrie kisses Kazuto and turns (temporarilly) into an adult again and battles Hydra. Then Rika and Akina show up. Akina sneaks up behind Hydra and puts a mystic scroll on her, which turns Hydra, like her sister, into a child. Unlike Valkyrie, however, Hydra still has the mind of an adult, so she's not at all happy about being stuck as a kid again. In the end Hydra ends up living at the shrine with Akina and Valkyrie lives at the bathhouse with Kazuto and Rika.

In the next episode Ms. Sanada, the head of the Valhallian Imperial Maid Squad, comes to Earth in search of Valkyrie. She finds her at the bathhouse, and doesn't seem too bothered that the princess is now a child. In fact, Sanada thinks Valkyrie is pretty cute in her current form. When Valkyrie says she wants to live with Kazuto, Sanada declares that he will be her husband. Kazuto never agreed to marrage, however, so he's less than thrilled. Later Kazuto walks home with Akina and they reminese about old times. Then Sanada sees Kazuto buying Akina a gift. Sanada is enraged, thinking Kazuto is cheating on Valkyrie, so she takes out her blaster that turns anyone she shoots with it into a catperson (a human with cat ears and a tail, like Sanada has,) and a brainwashed slave who'll gladly do whatever Sanada says. She then begins blasting every girl Kazuto runs accross and says anything to, and by the end of the day she's turned about 70 girls or so into obedient cat girls. When Hydra finds out she runs over to the shrine and warns Akina, since she doesn't want Akina switching to Sanada's side, as Sanada cares only for Valkyrie and not for Hydra. But then Sanada and her catgirl army come to the shrine. Sanada tries to shoot Akina, but Akina uses her psychic powers to deflect the gun's beam. Akina then lifts the spell on Hydra, turning her back (temporarilly) into an adult. Hydra begins battling Sanada, but then Kazuto and Valkyrie arrive. Kazuto tells Sanada that he and Akina are just friends and there's no romance between them, so Sanada stops her attack and apologizes to Akina. Sanada then has her army work at the bathhouse. (The moral and ethical problems of having once normal women leading normal lives who were forcibly turned into catgirls and brainwashed servants remain as such is basically skipped over.) Sanada also moves into the bathhouse.

In the first episode (which, again, takes place after 2 and 3 which were described above,) Kazuto is at the air/spaceport watching the plane that his parents are in leaving. (We are never told where they were or what they were doing before, or if they even know of the presence of the three Valhallian visitors.) The rest of the first half of this episode is mostly just the different characters going about thier daily life. Then one night as Valkyrie is about to go to sleep, she tells Kazuto that she wants to play hide-and-seek the next day, and if he can't find her, she'll go back to her home planet with his soul with her. The next day Valkyrie is nowhere to be found. Kazuto, Rika, Hydra, Akina, Sanada and her catgirl army search all over the city for her, but are unable to find her. Finally Kazuto finds her at the Spacecraft Docking Tower in a docked spacecraft. Both are happy that he's found her, but as she's getting out she trips and accidentally activates the spacecraft. It flies in circles and crashes into the tower, sending debris falling. Kazuto picks up Valkyrie and carries her down the stairs that are located on the outside of the tower with him, but the falling debris destroys the stairs in front of them. Then Valkyrie kisses him and again turns momentarilly into an adult, and saves them both. Then they go home.

In the last episode of this disk, Hydra and Akina plot to use a net gun to capture Valkyrie. Akina wants Valkyrie gone because she's secretly in love with Kazuto. But thier plan backfires and Hydra and Akina end up netted instead. Then Prince Triam, one of Valkyrie's would-be suitors, arrives with his robot Aujiro. He has come to take her back to Valhalla and marry her, and is also stunned to see her in child form, and thinks she's gotten a disease from Earth and needs to be taken back and cured. As it turns out, Valkyrie ran away when she found out Triam was planning to have her do all the work while he took it easy. Valkyrie refuses to go with him, and she leaves with Kazuto. When Triam learns she's a child because she gave part of her soul to Kazuto, he has Aujiro turn into a shuttle craft armed with a blaster that will give back Valkyrie her soul, which will probably kill Kazuto. Will Kazuto survive? Will Valkyrie be able to stay on Earth with him, or will she be forced to return to Valhalla and marry Triam...?

If you're a long-time viewer of dubbed anime, you'll probably recignize a few familiar voices. Kira Vincent Davis (Miyu from SUPER GALS!, Osaka from AZUMANGA DAIOH, Najica from NAJICA BLITZ TACTICS, Rumma from SLAYERS, and Momoru from SISTER PRINCESS) is both the older and the younger versions of Valkyrie, and she gives each role a seperate tone and personality so that one could well mistakenly think that two different voice actors were doing the character. Greg Ayres (Chrono from CHRONO CRUSADE, Hokuto's lackey from CHROMARTIE HIGH SCHOOL, Shinji from FULL METAL PANIC, Leo from GHOST STORIES, and Tsuyoshi from KODOCHA) is Kazuto, Monica Rial (Natsume from the MERMAID FOREST T.V. series, Amy from CASE CLOSED, Aya from KODOCHA, Kyoko from FULL METAL PANIC, Sayaka from MAGICAL SHOPPING ARCADE ABENOBASHI, Ms. Ninamo from AZUMANGA DAIOH, Kirika from NOIR, Lila from NAJICA BLITZ TACTICS, Hyatt from EXCEL SAGA, Nanaka from NANAKA 6/17, Momoko from GHOST STORIES, and Sakuya from SISTER PRINCESS,) is Rika, Nancy Novotny (Raika from MABURAHO, Koyomi from AZUMANGA DAIOH, and Rin Rin from SISTER PRINCESS,) is Hydra, Cynthia Martinez (Lina Inverse from the SLAYERS movies and OAVs, Yuna from GALAXY FRAULIEN YUNA, Poemy from PUNI PUNI POEMY, and Kaho from SISTER PRINCESS) is Akina, Christen Auten (White Compiler from COMPILER, Princess Mirage from GALAXY FRAULIEN YUNA, and Kechiro from GHOST STORIES) is Sanada, and Chris Patton (Souske Sagara from FULL METAL PANIC, Gourry from SLAYERS PREMIUM, and Hajime from GHOST STORIES) is Prince Tiam.

2483986,4,B000E1ZB6I,"I like to call this T&A anime and when you get past all the boobs and bottoms there is actually a cute story underneath. THIS is meant to be nothing more than ""brain candy"". The music and characters carry this goofy anime pretty well . . . just don't expect to much intellectual stimulation . . . this is more about titillation and it's aimed mostly at teens and tweens. The OFFICIAL v-chip rating on the side of the DVD case is TV-MA, so if you don't want your kids under 16 or 17 to see a little comic/anime nudity you might want to skip this and the rest of the UFO Princess/Ultramaiden series. There are no ""sex acts"" performed in this, unless you think getting a big smooch is ""sex"". I suggest reading the editorial review, possibly with a grain of salt, because it does touch all the pertinent points that would help you make a choice.

Once again I remind you that this is what I would call a ""T&A"" anime so keep that in mind.",1151971200,4,933,4.241573033707865
