Yes it's only 62' long and the DVD authoring is quite poor; the bonus songs are indeed performed after the Reign In Blood lp performance when they were actually played BEFORE  and yes some 30' of the show were not included which is a bummer but the original intention was to showcase RIBlod live so I felt lucky for the inclusion of the other 6 songs.

The pic bitrate hovers around a meagre 6 Mbps (maybe they went for a DVD 5 pressing, although I've not wheighed it) and it's plagued with both purposely B&W and grainy shots and there are 2 AC3 soundstreams, one of them 5.1 but both have King's axe ten times louder on the right channel which kindda ruined it for me. Tom's vox is OTT all over the mix (hate that) but the bottom end is SHATTERING !! When Lombardo actuates both kickdrum pedals an earthquake occurs, and I'm not one for exaggerating my sub's volume !!

There is a cool interview with the guys which is in 4:3 aspect with a higher pic bitrate (why ?! It's a friggin' extra FFS !!) which could have been saved for the gig.

BUT, this DVD kicks so much butt I couldn't take more than one star off what could have been a perfect 5.",1354233600,2,1473,4.209219858156028
8404499,3,B003SM1Z10,"This DVD would be SOOOOOOO awesome if the didn't forget to mic up Hennamen's guitar.  WTF, dual soloing guitarists of the HIGHEST caliber and they overlook mic one of them!!!  If you can get past that, then this is a DVD for all true Slayer fans to own!!!!",1301875200,,256,4.3125
8404500,5,B003SM1Z10,I  SAW  SLAYER  AT  THE  SEASONS  IN  THE  ABYSS  TOUR  IN  THE  CAMIO  THEATRE  IN MIAMI  FLORIDA.  MY  POINT  IS  I  WOULD  HAVE  LOVED  TO  BEEN  AT  THE  REIGNING  BLOOD CONCERT.  THIS  DVD  KICK'S  ASS. I'VE  ALWAYS  SAID  SLAYER  IS  THE  BLACK  SABBATH  OF  BLACK  METAL  AND  THEY  ARE.  IF  YOUR  A  SLAYER  FAN  THIS  IS  THE  DVD  TO  OWN!!!!!!,1299628800,2,355,4.0
