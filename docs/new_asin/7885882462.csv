7900727,5,7885882462,"The darkest and most troubling of Ozus family melodramas, Tokyo Twilight takes up the story of a broken family, a rarity in Japan before the war. Shukichi Sugiyama (Chishu Ryu), a banker, has raised his two daughters alone, since his wife deserted him while he was serving in the navy during the war. Takako (Setsuko Hara), the older daughter, is herself entangled in a troubled marriage. Her husband drinks too much, is obsessed with his academic career, and Takako has left him temporarily and come to stay with her father, along with her toddler.

The younger sister, Akiko (Ineko Arima), has fallen in with a group of disreputable types, spends time hanging out at a Mahjong parlor, and has become pregnant by a casual boyfriend, a student who has neither the resources or the desire to marry her. Meanwhile, the perennial meddling auntie, played as usual by Haruko Sugimura, tries to find a match for Akiko.

Without revealing too much of the story, traditional marriage, as in other Ozu films such as Early Spring, is the bedrock to which Takako eventually returns resignedly, determined to stick it out; Shukichis former wife, rejected by her daughters, has brought unhappiness on herself; while the younger sister, Akiko, is beset by grief and misery and comes to a tragic end.

Not that Ozu imposes any moral judgment on his characters; on the contrary, their tribulations are seen in the broader social context of a culture wracked by inevitable historical change. In the Japanese view, shikata ga nai: it cant be helped.

Tokyo Twilight is visually stunning though in a quite different way from, say, Floating Weeds. Ozus imagery captures poignantly the drab polluted landscape of postwar industrial Japan. There are countless examples of his signature compositions, industrial vignettes that stand in stark contrast with the mountains and rivers without end of traditional Japan. The subdued color palette in this film, unlike the vibrant hues of Floating Weeds or The End of Summer, reveals the artistry of a director who, if he had made more than four color films in his career, would certainly be recognized as a master of the subtleties of color in film.

For those who have complained that Ozus films are uneventful or slow-moving, Tokyo Twilight provides plenty of drama. For others who have yet to experience this directors work I recommend starting with Tokyo Story or Late Spring.",1388534400,,2401,5.007518796992481
