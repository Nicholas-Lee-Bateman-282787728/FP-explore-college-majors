8522321,4,B007VX02Q6,"Another of Alan Berliner's quirky, funny, but thoughtful and enlightening documentaries. This one
chronicles his attempts to find an answer for his insomnia, and examines whether his tendency to be a
night owl is a problem that keeps him out of sync with the world and his family, or a harmless quirk of
personality that helps him be creative.

The film manages to convey a good deal of scientific information about sleep and sleep rhythms, but
Berliner's wry, very personal telling keeps it from ever feeling dry or purely informational. As someone
who is a night owl myself, I found this fascinating, sometimes a bit sad, and always entertaining.",1373241600,,648,4.944954128440367
