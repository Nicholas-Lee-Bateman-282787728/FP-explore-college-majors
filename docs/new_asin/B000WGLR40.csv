8223234,5,B000WGLR40,"I first saw this movie when it first came on TV.  I was about 10.  I watched Saved By The Bell every weekend so I liked that Zack Morris was in it.  Just thinking about what I would do if I was lost in the woods, injured or with someone injured, was a fascinating concept to me.  Watching it recently, I was surprised how short and low budget it was.  Also, there seemed to be a lot less content than I remember.  I guess I had a good imagination.  I recommend this for kids 7 to 12 or if you're like me and loved when you were a kid.",1375142400,,534,3.8440366972477062

8223236,5,B000WGLR40,"The movie stars Mark Paul Gossealear from Saved by the Bell. It's a wilderness survival trip for five teens and their father figure. Even before near tragedy strikes with the leader falling off a cliff, you are hooked in by the outdoor white water rafting and the building anger between a few of the teens. Good wholesome adventure tale that is pretty believable.
