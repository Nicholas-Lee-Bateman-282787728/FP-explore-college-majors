If you were there, it will resurrect your memories; if you were not, it will be a taste of an absolutely remarkable time in our history.  The music, the interviews, the historical clips and perfect.  I now need to have my vhs copy digitized so I can continue to experience that time.",1499990400,,447,4.55
7816325,5,6301898656,"although some people may find the music somewhat ""cheesy"" this film is a wonderful portrayal of the fall of the berlin wall. it is very moving to see the east german people streaming across the opening borders so elated to feel free. the west germans were also welcoming and happy as well. in this day in age i believe our younger generation needs to see this film! it is a reminder of a time and a place where freedom and oppression lived side by side and the devasting effects of oppression and the wonderful feeling of freedom can be closely compared.",1102636800,5,554,4.4950495049504955
