8671718,4,B00MDZEKV0,"With some Broadway work behind her as well as some films and a job as singer on the enormously popular one hour Bing Crosby Kraft hour (she was  also filmed with Bing), Mary Martin was on the verge of Broadway Greatness when she made this light trifle with a solid supporting cast. Victor Moore, Franchot Tone and Dick Powell shared star billing with her in this typical comedy love story which is one of many made during the War which, save for the casts, are practically interchangeable. Interestingly, this is also one of the last films that the popular crooner, DickPowell, made before radio allowed him to change his screen persona from ""boy singer"" as they were known (including the up and coming
Frank Sinatra), to tough guy detective, an identity which then dominated in his screen and television appearances until the end of his life. Both Dick and Mary get to do solos (although this is not designated a ""musical comedy"") but despite the efforts of  Hoagy Carmichael-Johnny Mercer these are nothing to write home about.
So, if you can find a copy, and you have a taste for a well-played comedy of World War 2 vintage, this should provide 90 pleasurable minutes",1501804800,,1170,4.730392156862745
