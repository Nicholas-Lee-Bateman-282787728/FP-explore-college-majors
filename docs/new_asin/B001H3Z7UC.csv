8307766,3,B001H3Z7UC,"this video shows various shag patterns from the basic to more intermediate patterns. although the young couple seem to be very good dancer's, they still have some development to go before becoming great instructors on video. i assume this to be based on the instructions given from the people at the DanceStore. All their video's have the same basic format....showing many patterns and just the pattern count. this would have been a great video to learn from if time was taken to explain (break down) the steps, the count, the timing, and most importantly the lead. i have many years dancing triple time eastcoast in a fashion similar to shag and therefore was able to understand and preform many of the patterns. i think for someone with out some experience dancing, this video would be somewhat difficult to understand the intermediate patterns as presented.",1266105600,5,860,4.979166666666667
