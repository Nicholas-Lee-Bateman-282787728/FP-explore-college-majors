8109521,5,B000EGEVFU,"This DVD was just what we needed. The treatments were varied and explained well. The seaweed was particularly helpful, as we needed to be more adept in thalassotherapy for our clients. We're now able to perform a superb treatment, and explain it well to our clients. The aromatherapy hydrotherapy treatments were a valuable addition. This is the type of video that staff members can look at again and again to perfect their technique. If you have a hydrotherapy tub make sure you purchase this informative DVD.",1402272000,,510,4.941860465116279
