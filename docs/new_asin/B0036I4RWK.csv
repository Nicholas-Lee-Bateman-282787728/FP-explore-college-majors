4077735,5,B0036I4RWK,"My kids would cry a lot when they were infants. I played this video to calm them before bed (and calm me while nursing my youngest and keeping my toddler happy). The DVD's are mellow, yet a great story line that teaches language rules through prepositions. Really cute. Spot is under, over, around, behind, etc. Too cute.",1374364800,,321,4.649122807017544
4077736,5,B0036I4RWK,Very peaceful cartoon.  My kids absolutely love to watch this cartoon. Good for naptime and playtime and provides good education for my toddlers.,1359936000,,145,5.304347826086956
4077737,5,B0036I4RWK,"Santa just brought this for our 2 year old for Christmas along with a little Spot stuffed animal and she absolutely loves it!  She has never been very intersted in watching TV before--she couldn't sit through more than 5-10 minutes of Sesame Street...  But she begs to watch ""the Spot movie"" every day!  I think the length is perfect--I wouldn't want her glued to the TV for much more than 30 minutes--just enough time to get a couple of things done around the house...  If your child likes the Spot books, I think this is well worth the $5.  We will definitely be buying the rest for her birthday.",1356998400,,598,4.4495412844036695
4077738,3,B0036I4RWK,"This is a great little collection of short stories that two year olds love. The stories are simple and easy for a young child to understand.  However, it is not 138 minutes as described, it is only 30 minutes total running time.  I am very disappointed in how short it is.",1351036800,9,272,4.313725490196078
4077739,5,B0036I4RWK,"I went searching for Spot videos for my preschooler and toddler. My older kids enjoyed Spot when they were little, but VCRs went out of style and we no longer had the VHS tapes. I wanted the American version with Jonathan Taylor Thomas as the voice of Spot. That's what this one is. It's cute, simple, and fun for the little ones. They both love it. Great price, too.",1328486400,3,367,4.333333333333333
4077740,5,B0036I4RWK,Gave this as a Christmas gift to a 2 and 1/2 year old boy. He loves the Spot books so I thought he would enjoy this movie too. His mom says that he has already asked to watch it a few times so I think it was a hit.,1325376000,,214,3.3877551020408165
4077741,5,B0036I4RWK,This is worth it if your child likes Spot! My son is 5 and loves this whole selection. He really is enjoying this. Great idea for Christmas or birthday gift.,1324944000,,157,4.266666666666667
4077742,5,B0036I4RWK,Very cute DVD with enough episodes to keep my 3 year old entertained. I am glad this is the American version cause I think the British one is kinda dull and boring. Did not know Jonathan Taylor Thomas of home improvement was the voice of spot. He used to be one of my faves when I was younger haha.,1315526400,,298,4.067796610169491
4077743,5,B0036I4RWK,"My two year old son loves Spot the dog.
A very positive & educational program for young children.
Would recommend to anyone with kids.",1301097600,,134,4.625
4077744,2,B0036I4RWK,"The shows are OK, but I was expecting the original Spot with British actors and saxophone jazz rifts.  This has neither; the actors are American, and it sounds like they got a Bee Gees cover band for the music.",1277596800,,210,4.384615384615385
8389991,4,B0036I4RWK,My 2 year old son loves the Where's Spot story. I took off a star because they left some things out. The monkey in the closet is not included and my son really likes that part.,1492041600,,176,3.9166666666666665

8389995,5,B0036I4RWK,Love Spot!,1425859200,,10,4.5
8389996,4,B0036I4RWK,"The 'Spot' books are always fun. The book is
hard bound, stands up under lots of rough treatment
and being 'baby-tasted' as well.  The colors are
bright. Drawings are simple.",1396915200,,174,4.8
8389997,5,B0036I4RWK,"Such a cute show for very young children. My son is 5 months and already loves watching spot. It is a great show for kids under 2, and keeps the attention of kids over 2 as well.",1395273600,,178,3.8378378378378377
8389998,5,B0036I4RWK,"The 2-year old who received this as a gift watches it frequently, always with a smile on his face.  The narrator's voice and background music are mellow and calming.  The animation is well-done, not over-done.",1394496000,,209,4.942857142857143
8389999,5,B0036I4RWK,"The kids love the Spot book we have, so thought we'd try the DVD just got them and the girls can't wait to watch them.",1389139200,,118,3.76
