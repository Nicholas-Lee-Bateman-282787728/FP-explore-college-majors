8306131,3,B001GMH8QA,"This is SHORT & QUICK biography about O.W. It covers the very basics.
If you did some research you likely know more then what is in this DVD. This is not the deep biography fans of O.W. are looking for. Though it would be OK to use for english classes.

If you are interested to see a movie with good representation of O.W. Get the 'Lillie' DVD. A biography about Lillie Langtree. Oscar was her close personal friend and is well represented in this film.",1273795200,,454,4.341176470588235
