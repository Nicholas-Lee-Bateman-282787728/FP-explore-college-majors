8147725,4,B000IY0BIY,"B+ movie.  Stupid, silly story that makes fun of bad movies.  Ironically, everything else is done very well.",1509840000,,108,4.944444444444445

8147728,1,B000IY0BIY,"Very disappointing.  I bought this because it starred Ray Wise, whose work I always admired.  Unfortunately, even though he is acting at less than half speed, he's still by far the best feature of this dismal production.  The production values are '50s television; direction, particularly pacing, is stagnant; and many of the supporting players are atrocious.",1464825600,,359,5.375
8147729,3,B000IY0BIY,good story but too many F bombs ( really!)  and seriously; over use of the middle finger....would have been a 4 or 5 if story had been better developed and more creative language instead of F bombs constantly and Finger ( as in middle ) constantly,1430524800,3,247,4.369565217391305
8147730,2,B000IY0BIY,"This title is not really a Science Fiction film, but more a saga or fictional documentary about the making of a ""B"" class Science Fiction Movie, and the characters in it. The fictional documentary itself is a ""B"" film, involving poor quality acting on the part of most, exceting Ray Wise, and the characters are odd, if not weak and eccentric. The film makes itself out to be artistic, but it is quite the opposite, and is more oriented toward being eclectic, eccentric, and sometimes quite banal, or just weak. For Science Fiction fans; this is ""not"" a science fiction movie, and does not contain any of the elements of the same.",1401926400,3,630,4.633928571428571
8147731,5,B000IY0BIY,"I remember Mr. Wise in other bit parts and cameos, however, his Leland Palmer role from ""TWIN PEAKS"" is what stands out. Getting this energetic man as the lead role was a stoke of G E N I U S! The last review only stated what ever else I would post here, and I agree with that review. I suggest you add this Troma release your collection.",1381536000,3,338,4.059701492537314
8147732,5,B000IY0BIY,"This is more than a comedy; it has something for everyone, especially those who like to see certain sacred cows get poked. What are the sacred cows?  Our wonderful government, our media, the sci-fi genre itself, filmmakers with big heads.  Also I liked this movie because the people making the movie within the movie may be jackass obsessives but I love them for their heart.  They're pursuing their dream, doing what they love.  I really grooved on the Soul Coughing music on the end credits.

Ray Wise is a standout; he can't do anything wrong.  Good movie!  Lots of laughs.",1161907200,9,576,4.7
