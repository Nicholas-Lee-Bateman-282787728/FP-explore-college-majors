7791950,1,0792148223,". . . But I'll give it a try. ""Descent Part II"" has all the faults of Part I, and then some. To an utterly stupid storyline, bad directing, and a lack of suspense and the necessary epic feel, Part II adds gratuitous cameos, a nonsensical storyline of Dr Crusher commanding the Enterprise (wasting heaps of time that could have been used to far better purpose), and - YET AGAIN - a ""no consequences"" conclusion. Many of these problems stem from the fact that Part I and Part II were written by different people, I suspect. The one good point is Brent Spiner - he does a scarily good job as Lore, now driven by a sense of destiny as well as his own superiority. But can anyone explain to me why Data can execute his brother and Dr Crusher can disobey an order, and neither are ever punished?",1042070400,,789,4.302013422818792
7791951,5,0792148223,"""Descent, Part 2"" is where the action gets going.  The trouble with the Borg chasing the Enterprise, the struggle for survival on the planet, and much, much more!  Even though you may like to see Part 2 of some episodes first, see them in order and you'll really like this guaranteed, but the first step is to convince yourself to watch it.  Well, it's not going to kill you, so watch it!",1003363200,,388,4.361111111111111
7791952,4,0792148223,"The conclusion which I am not going to give away here involves the doctor driving the ship into the sun to avoid the Borg! This was one of the best scenes in the episode.
The next would be when Data rebels against his brother Lore. Originally planned to be a long and protracted battle between brothers ...the cost of the show forced the producers to have a brief fight scene. However the story ended in an unpredictable way. All of this to control Data's emotion chip.
I wish this episode had one more installment. It would show how Lore met the Borg. How did he get away from Data in his last appearence in ""Brothers""??
Data's emotion chip becomes the subject in the first Next Generation film ...Generations.",1002499200,,711,4.5625
7791953,5,0792148223,"Part I left off with Picard, Geordi, and Troi surrounded by the Borg, and they find out that Lore is involved, and so is Data.  Data is being controled by Data.  Data takes Geordi's visor away from him, and later  Commander Data does some experiments on him.
we find out that these  particular Borgs' are separted from the collective, and we see Hue is  there. (Hue was once rescued by the Enterprise crew, and the crew instead  of sending him back to the collective with self-destruct computer codes to  destroy the Borg, Picard and the crew are sympathetic and send him back,  with computer program on indivduality.) This disorients the Borg, and have  turned to Lore who will be their leader, and bring order to them. Picard,  Troi, and LaForge, escape and break the control Lore and on Data. Once free  from Lore's control, Data fights with Lore, and defeats him. Data is forced  to destroy Lore. Hue and the rest of the Borg on that planet try and find  order with their lives.",962236800,8,982,4.574712643678161
