We really like 'Man On Fire' and didn't have it on Blu-ray so this seemed like an OK deal at a bit over $10 a pop - free shipping. It came 2 days after I ordered - Thank You Amazon.

Most of the leading men should be familiar to almost everyone (except people who will only watch 'G Rated' movies like my Mom and Grand-Ma), so figuring out if you'll like the movies is a matter of your taste in actors.

Here's my personal 2 cents:

MAN ON FIRE - Denzel Washington gives a stellar performance as a body-guard of sorts in a movie set in Mexico City where apparently, kidnapping rich folks family members for ransom is not only for the obvious criminals. Dakota Fanning is in this film and is also equally outstanding in her portrayal as the kid being body-guarded.

HITMAN - Timothy Olyphant (the sheriff on HBO's ""Deadwood"" and the bad guy in ""Live Free or Die Hard"") plays a crack shot who spends most of the film brandishing weapons and using them with an almost sort of grace.  I hate when people write too much detail in the review as to who does what, so I hesitate to say too much, although some of the situations reminded me of Jason Bourne's (Bourne Identity) life or death intrigue.  I never saw the video game so I have no idea how close this film comes to the storyline of the game.

STREET KINGS - This movie actually got a higher rating on IMBD than ""Hitman"" did. I am assuming that this is due to Forest Whitaker rather than Keanu 'dead pan man' Reeves, even though Reeves got top billing.  Whitaker is good - Reeves is wooden, and the story line is not unique but OK for a good cop/bad cop flick.

Hitman and Street Kings came with 2 DVDs in the cases, so I'm assuming they are Special Features.",1246665600,2,1738,4.287461773700306
8304372,1,B001G7Q1OU,"these movies are less than a year old  if these movies were any good they would not have to package them together to make it look like you are getting a deal

man on fire is the best of the 3  denzel washington  is good in a suspenseful thriller.  it is the  once decent movie they  threw in to try to sell  the other 2 duds

hitman is based on a videogame  that is never a good start for a movie.  if you like senseless mind numbing plotless movies then by all means have at it.

street kings  is keanu  ""made of wood"" reeves  how this guy still has a  big time movie career  is baffling.  he shows no emotions what so ever.  this is another  thin plotted movie  you will watch once and it will stay on your dvd  shelves forever.",1244678400,2,730,3.992957746478873
8304373,5,B001G7Q1OU,"Can't go wrong with any of these movies.

Hitman - Thought this movie was great. Olga was just to die for literally. lol

Street Kings - If you've never been to L.A. go see this movie. It'll give you an idea of how things are. Great movie.

Man on Fire - Amazing, brilliant and vengeful.",1241740800,4,287,4.181818181818182
8304374,5,B001G7Q1OU,"Bought this for a friend's house warming along with a blu-ray player. The combo pack is a great buy with really cool movies in them. If you haven't seen any of these films at least once, you are missing out on some really great action. Washington plays really well in ""Man of Fire"" a great roll, very serious and heart filled. Reeves in ""Street Kings"" is really cool action guy with twists and turns, about L.A Cop life. ""Hitman"" a very cool movie adapted from a game, Acting isn't all that great buy this is a pretty cool guy movie.",1239580800,5,533,4.34
