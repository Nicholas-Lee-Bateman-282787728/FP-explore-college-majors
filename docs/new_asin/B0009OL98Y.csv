8064252,5,B0009OL98Y,"I grew up watching this.  It was very fun to remissness.  I can tell they tried to remaster it, but it is simply so old there were no miracles to be found.  But that does not really matter at all because it is great fun just the way it always was.",1362182400,,247,3.803921568627451
8064253,4,B0009OL98Y,"I bought this video for my pre-school aged son, who has fallen in love with Gumby after meeting him via ""Cartoon Craze"" $1 DVD from Wal-Mart.

My son loves this DVD but some of the shorts, especially the one about father time, are pretty weird looking and possibly scary for young children. In the father time one (I think it is called ""Time Out""?), there is a weird wall-eyed Jester with a creepy voice that makes it seem like a horror movie almost.

All in all this is an entertaining volume for a child, although it is relatively slow paced and would probably not interest anyone over 9 or 10 years old, except for sentimental reasons.",1160352000,3,638,4.491379310344827

They usually showed a couple of episodes per half-hour show, and it included one new episode and one classic (infamously redubbed).  This DVD has just the new episodes (12 in all) that have never been released on home video before.

I like this version of Gumby a lot.  He's formed a band with his friends - Pokey, Prickle, and Goo.  They're called the Gumbys, and they practice in a barn and rock out at ice cream socials.  And, of course, they battle the Blockheads and go on crazy adventures like always.  The series contains new characters, most notably Denali the mammoth and Tilly the chicken.  And many of the minor characters from the original series are still around - Minga, Professor Kapp, King Ott, and the Groobee (yes!).  Sadly, Nopey is nowhere to be found.  Be sure to keep an eye out for the quick shot of Gumby in his Michael Jackson Thriller outfit!  And the Ironbee has to be seen to be believed.

It almost seems that Rhino got this set mixed up with their redubbed set they put out a few years ago.  The menu screens play the original Gumby theme song instead of the 80s version.  And unfortunately, the 80s opening is not to be found - no opening at all, in fact.  The closing credits are there, though.  I found it funny that there's a tagline on the back of the DVD case stating 'ALL ORIGINAL EVERYTHING!  MUSIC, VOICES, FX'.  Rhino must have heard the complaints from the old-school Gumby fans on their first boxset!  The only extra is a 'trailer' for the Gumby vs. the Astrobots video game.  It's more of a teaser, though, since it shows no actual game footage at all.

All in all, I really enjoyed this DVD.  A second volume was released simultaneously that I have yet to watch.  Keep 'em coming, Rhino!  And don't forget to release the original series in its original format.  You've got a returning customer here!",1120953600,20,1932,4.498559077809798
