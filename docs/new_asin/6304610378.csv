award at Cannes for this film. A lavish period piece, glamorous and moving. A top 'art house"" film in it's day . Highly recommended.

7877571,5,6304610378,"I am not certain I could say ""The Inheritance"" (1976) is director Mauro Bolognini's masterpiece, but I loved it anyway despite the bad break from a twisted videotape that Simitar Entertainment used to make this DVD.  For this DVD presentation, I would give this product one star for being there.  I once owned a better videotape of this film taped from cable.  I can't be certain, but I seem to remember seeing more from my cable presentation, and then this product advertizes that it contains a ""Parental Lock"" which excludes scenes containing extreme violence and nudity.  It would not be of interest to children.  What crap!  The movie is a sumptuous period piece, wonderfully realized in art direction by Luigi Scaccianoce and costuming by Gabriella Pescucci. Brilliant cinematography by Ennio Guarnieri and flawless editing by Fima Noveck and a lavish, beautiful score by Ennio Morricone.  It can get tiresome to mention again that Dominique Sanda won the Best Actress Award at Cannes for her performance, but then she was not even nominated by the Academy.  Also starring Anthony Quinn, Fabio Testi, Luigi Proietti, Adriana Asti and Paolo Bonacelli.  As written by Ugo Pirro and Sergio Bazzini, it is based on a novel by Gaetano Carlo Chelli, it is a bit of a soap opera, but fascinating nonetheless and Bolognini, the director of ""Arabella"" and ""The Venetian Woman,"" has created a tapestry of extraordinary beauty in the unveiling, telling a powerful story, not easily forgotten.  Would S.J. International Pictures, who released ""The Inheritance"" please authorize a better edition?  The color is normally by Movielab.  At times a breathtaking film.  How can it be so easily given up?",1379894400,,1690,5.079710144927536
7877572,3,6304610378,"Wicked! Dominique Sanda is quite the seductress.  This film deserves a better film treatment, an Italian director's cut, instead of this poorly transferred, expurgated, U.S dub release.",1280880000,2,185,5.851851851851852
