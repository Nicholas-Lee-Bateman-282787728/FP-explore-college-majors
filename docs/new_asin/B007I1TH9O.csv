8517029,3,B007I1TH9O,"A slow starter. But not bad for an evening's viewing. a family friendly flick, the cover gives the impresion this might be a doccumentary. It is not. Neither will you get a better look at the monster than you do on the cover.  But, purchasing one of these is always a blind bet, unless you get a hint from a concerned fan. Get it for a bargain price. It is no classic. But it is worth a look.",1424995200,,392,4.0256410256410255
8517030,1,B007I1TH9O,"This is a horribly fake documentary with zero evidence for the existence of the Willatuk. The film opens with a very clear fake 911 call followed by some poor digital photography- note distortion around faces. We get to hear from some people who claim to be cryptologists, but really appear to be bad actors. They toss at us some Native American oral traditions that have been around for ""1000's of years"" ...and we know this how? I liked the old N.A. prophecy that claims the industrial revolution would cause global warming, melt the ice caps, and destroy the planet.  Eat you heart out Michael Notre Dame. The cytologist knows the Willatuk is there by using his uric acid tricorder on the lake.

Much of film centers on Grip David, a man who is obsessed with killing the creature because he once saw it and no one believed him. I must say the Northern Seattle Girl's Volley Ball team was some nice eye candy filler, but watching them play the game, I serious doubt if they can even spell volleyball let alone play it.  Yes, let's interview them and see what they have to say on the topic. That should settle it.

Guide: About an hour of camp material. No bad language sex, or nudity other than an unsightly man-boob.",1419552000,,1219,4.552511415525114

8517032,4,B007I1TH9O,It's obvious after watching this video that huge sea creatures are a worldwide phenomenon. I particularly enjoyed the parts about Native Americans and how they see the creatures as protectors.,1368921600,,192,5.433333333333334

8517034,1,B007I1TH9O,"Can't believe how some say this is well done.  Must be the producers of the show.  Just rented the movie. Poorly put together. Would have been better if straight true documentary. Acting and scripting as bad as Billy Jack movies. Makes mockery of such a creature if one exists. Wait, maybe that's the way the movie is suppose to be, all of the above...oh, I get it...Witch Blair Project!",1360108800,,387,4.594202898550725
8517035,1,B007I1TH9O,"Corny acting. Silly plot deviations showing the human side of the monster search (your wives yell at you a lot.)
Production suffers when you can't hear what is being said one second, then it's too loud. Overbearingly loud  music.
Not even worthy of the title mockumentary. The Indian connection was pretty much contrived, and the
monster itself a standard Plesiosaur that travels to and fro the ocean via secret tunnels. Check out ""Incident at Loch Ness"" if you
want to be entertained by a Lake Monster. That movie is hilarious. This is garbage.",1343606400,3,545,4.860215053763441
8517036,3,B007I1TH9O,"The central conflict of this documentary is powerful and fascinating.  To the Native Americans of the Seattle area, Willatuk (who looks a lot like Nessie) is both a real creature and a god of the sea who protects the native people.  But to scientists, pseudo-scientists, the game-hunting crowd, this sea-creature is a something to be ""proven,"" perhaps captured or killed, worthy of study and nothing more.  Naturally the natives are offended by this hunting down of their sacred being.  So this isn't so much of a ""is the monster real?"" documentary, but one more example of the conflict between the spiritual and the secular taking place everywhere in our time.  Worth watching but I took a couple stars away for some hokey reenactments and other silliness, beneath the otherwise overall dignity of the film.",1339977600,,808,5.0
8517037,5,B007I1TH9O,"A really well-produced documentary about cultural connection to the belief that there is a creature living in Seattle's Lake Washington. Includes local film footage and interviews, historical context and other interesting background to explain why the beliefs have sustained for so long.",1338681600,,287,5.857142857142857
