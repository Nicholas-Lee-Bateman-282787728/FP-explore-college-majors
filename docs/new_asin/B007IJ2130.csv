5089064,5,B007IJ2130,"Play this video on Sunday morning for the preschoolers while they are eating their breakfast before Mass.  They are much more willing to practice the sign of the cross with the cartoon kids than with me.  They were so excitd to show that they could do it.

They are 2 and 3 so will take a little longer before they learn the prayers.",1404691200,,333,4.253968253968254
5089065,5,B007IJ2130,"Our 2 year old received the Brother Francis Christmas DVD as a present and she loved it so much that we purchased this Prayer DVD and the Rosary DVD. Our daughter loves them! She laughs, sings and learns valuable lessons. Even though she is only two, she is able to grasp many of the concepts presented in this video. Brother Francis is not stuffy; he's relatable and faithful to Church teaching. Highly Recommend.",1395705600,,414,4.684931506849315

5089067,5,B007IJ2130,"Extremely well-done video! Top quality and my kids 8,6, & 4 absolutely love it! Teaches the faith in simple, yet, reverent terms.  Adults will enjoy it too! This is the second Brother Francis video we have purchased with the intent that we will get all of them.",1386288000,4,261,4.553191489361702
5089068,5,B007IJ2130,So thankful I purchased this DVD which I'd never heard of before but came upon it by accident!  The songs are toe-tapping and the quality of the whole production is excellent.  I did my in-house walking exercise while watching and it just made my day!  This one is in English & Spanish with subtitles approximately 21 minutes.  I'll be purchasing all of the Brother Francis DVDs!,1470873600,,379,4.696969696969697
5089069,5,B007IJ2130,I have a 20 month old boy who is enamored with this series. Singing throughout the cartoon grabs his attention and keeps him watching for most of the video. We will be buying the rest of the series soon.,1469664000,,203,4.230769230769231

5089071,5,B007IJ2130,"I didn't think I'd love Bro Francis DVDs as much as I do. They seem a little bit cheesy at first glance, but I can assure you they are full of substance and makes explaining the faith to kids soooo easy! You won't regret the purchase of any of these DVDs. All three of my kids 7 and under love them.",1462147200,,299,3.918032786885246
5089072,5,B007IJ2130,Top for Kids!,1447632000,,13,3.6666666666666665
5089073,5,B007IJ2130,This is a great CD and has a simple yet impressive way of talking to kids about prayer.  Brother Francis is funny and the pictures are clear and my kids love it.  The only draw back is its only about 25 minutes run time.  I wish it was longer. The kids stay involved the whole time.,1447286400,,282,4.0
5089074,3,B007IJ2130,"They are educational, but not entertaining. My kids didn't like watching them a second time...",1447286400,,94,5.333333333333333
5089075,5,B007IJ2130,My kids really enjoy the brother Francis DVDs I really enjoy the fact that they are getting a positive church based message that is entertaining ,1440028800,,145,4.8

5089077,5,B007IJ2130,A great way to start off teaching the little ones. My two and a half year old knows the Our Father! All my kids love the songs and sing along with them!,1436918400,,152,3.78125
8517552,5,B007IJ2130,"This is another excellent Brother Francis DVD for young children. My 2.5-year-old son loves this DVD. It has an excellent soundtrack and the animation is very well done as well. My little boy actually tries to sing the Our Father along with the Our Father song on the DVD. I love that the episode is not very long. It's only about 25-30 minutes long so it can easily hold a toddler's attention for most, if not all, of the DVD. My son usually watches the entire thing and he pays attention to it as well.",1524268800,,504,4.315789473684211
8517553,3,B007IJ2130,"I like the DVD content, but the labels smells so vile, I cannot order any more. I am chemically hypersensitive and often have trouble outgassing DVD labels, but these are the worse, by far, of any I've encountered.  And it's not necessary. Jelly Telly DVD labels don't smell at all.",1522281600,,282,4.64

8517558,5,B007IJ2130,GRANDKIDS LOVE AND ME TOO,1483142400,,25,4.2
8517559,5,B007IJ2130,"This series is so wonderful for small children (though honestly, I'd bet older children would love it too!)

This video focusses on Prayer, and Brother Franics goes into the basics of what a prayer is, why we should pray, and covers some of the more common prayers we would use each day (Our Father, Hail Mary, Glory Be, etc).

There are a few simple but sweet songs that help children follow along with the message a little easier, and a very sweet segment about Saint Therese The Little Flower, which I really appreciated, because it jump started my 6 year old's interest into learning more about the Saints.

It is age appropriate even for the youngest of children and it follows the Catholic Church's teachings well, so have no worries about that.

We love Brother Francis!",1477094400,2,777,4.6911764705882355
8517560,5,B007IJ2130,So good for my granddaughter and she loves the Br. Francis videos,1473206400,,65,4.5
