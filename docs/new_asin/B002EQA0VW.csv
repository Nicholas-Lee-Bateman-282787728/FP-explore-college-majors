Gil Karni captures the story of Itamar and his sheep so well, very different from other Israeli documentaries I've seen. The film resonated with my own experiences of the beauty I found all around me in Israel and the connection I felt there. Especially my love for the artist market in Tel Aviv. There is so much warmth, love,  passion and creativity in this film that I wanted to watch it again with my husband. It brought back many fond memories of my life in Tel Aviv.",1436486400,,582,4.243243243243243
