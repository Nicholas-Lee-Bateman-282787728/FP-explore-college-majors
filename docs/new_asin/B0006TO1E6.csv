as for this episode it is a classic. The series is outstanding and Eric Fleming was the star of that show. I agree with some of the reviews from 'Curse of the Undead' (an Eric Fleming movie)that, had he lived (he died in an unfortunate accident shortly after the Rawhide years) he probably would have been as big a star as John Wayne or Clint Eastwood. Here is more taken from another source
....Rawhide, considered to be the best written and best directed Western on television....For seven seasons, Fleming portrayed an honest, independent, strong, intelligent, and heroic cowboy in the tradition of the American West. He embodied the mythic hero whose sense of justice and morality overrode all other considerations. Fleming's presence as Favor was so dominant that it centered the entire show and provided the base around which all the other characters revolved.
... capable of admitting mistakes, enduring the consequences, and realizing his limitations. In four episodes featuring Favor's interactions with children (Incident of the Fish Out of Water, The Boss's Daughters, Incident of the Hostages, and El Hombre Bravo), his warmth, sensitivity, and overt compassion are particularly evident, adding depth, realism, and a gentleness to the character. The series was mostly shot in Nogales, Arizona and the authenticity of the trail drive was staggering - enough to win The Western Heritage Award from the National Cowboy Hall of Fame four years in a row. The award named Rawhide the outstanding program of its genre for excellence in depicting the West.
...and remained in the top twenty programs through 1962 in America, was number one in Japan and popular throughout Europe",1199836800,,1725,5.120567375886525
