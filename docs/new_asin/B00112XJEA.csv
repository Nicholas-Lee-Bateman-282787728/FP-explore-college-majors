8240069,5,B00112XJEA,"Poul Jorgensen was the best fly tying teacher around. His videos are clear and easy to understand and follow. He'll have you tying beautiful flies in just a few minutes, and even teach you the manual whip finish which not many fly tiers know how to do. He was a good man and is really missed by all that knew him. Thankfully his knowledge of fly tying can continue through his teaching videos.
