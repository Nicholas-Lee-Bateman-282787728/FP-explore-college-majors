So when I read about this new series I bouhgt the disc without hesitation. It did not disappoint me.  Fairly good dub, excellent sound and picture quality, and definetly one of  the most hilarious shows I've seen so far. A must have.",955238400,2,351,4.555555555555555
1065108,5,6305753172,"Trigun is a well-blended mix of steam-punk action and slapstick comedy.  However, there is truly no way to describe the antics of Vash the Stampede.  Simply put, Vash is an outlaw by reputation, known for destroying towns.  Luckily, his clueless nature makes it easy to slip past the authorities.  Unfortunately this small introduction is unable to capture the fast  action, outrageous comedy, bizarre characters, and honest morals of the  treasure we call Trigun.  Imagine Leslie Neilson starring in the Matrix,  and you're getting close to the overall feel of Trigun...but it's far from  a shallow parody.  This series is full of ""meaningful"" scenes  which give method to Vash's mayhem.  Fans of action anime should check  out Trigun to see how good comedy can work in their familiar formula.  Fans of comedy and lighthearted anime should check out Trigun to see that  action doesn't necessarily get in the way of good humor.  To any fans of  the Trigun manga (comic), rest assured that the anime completely captures  the feel of its source material, completely heightening the Trigun  experience.  The DVD comes with both Japanese and English language  tracks...both of which are some of the best I've ever heard.  Vash's  English actor seems to focus more on silly than serious...but hopefully  he'll adapt as the series moves forward.  So pick up Trigun, fall in love  with the characters, and then watch it continuously in hopes that  installment 2 comes along quickly...",954374400,10,1477,5.071129707112971
1065109,5,6305753172,"Trigun's biggest draw is its main character, Vash the Stampede.  Once you meet him it becomes very hard to believe his reputation as the Humanoid Typhoon.  How on earth could this dork be him?  Vash is a peace-loving,  free-spirited guy with a gun, but he rarely uses it.  Pain...  not to  mention the sight of blood, doesn't agree with him.  He is a pretty cute  and lovable character.
These first four episodes have him going from town  to town facing people who are out to collect the $$60,000,000,000 reward on  his head.  There isn't to much development as there are only three major  characters at this point.  The other two are the insurance agents Meryl  Strife and Milly Thompson who are in search of Vash, but never seem to get  it through their heads that the blond-haired idiot that they keep running  into really is the guy.  Meryl is the leader, while Milly is the silly (and  VERY tall) sidekick who is usually oblivious to any sort of danger.  There  is not much development this far into the story which makes me wonder when  something important is actually going to happen...  They face bounty  hunters, bandits, but it all comes down to Vash helping to save the day  (although he sure gets tied up a lot)
However, Trigun is filled  with fun action and is hilariously funny.  The western theme and great  music is refreshing.  It has many good messages and so far the characers  are all very cool.  I just hope the plot begins to develop more in the  second volume.  I'm sure it will.  This series is off to a good start and I  hope you don't pass it up.  It really is quality anime.",954374400,,1601,4.456445993031359
1065110,5,6305753172,"Ah... what can I say about this anime?  The animation quality is good, the dubbing... (yadda yadda yadda).  THAT'S NOT THE POINT!  Trigun has loveable characters, good plot, plenty o' action, and hilarious antics.  Meet Vash  the Stampede, or the Humanoid Typhoon.  He's a wanted criminal with a $$60  billion price on his head (yes $$, not $).  He's famous for leveling any  town he enters (but not a single death has resulted from his destructive  tendencies).  As you might imagine, this bad habit of his is an insurance  company's worst nightmare, so one company sends out two of their employees,  Meryl Strife (or Streep in the Japanese version)and Millie Thompson, to  find Vash.  Their mission: keep Vash under 24 hour surveilence so he  doesn't blow anything else up.  Their plan: give him donuts and be real  nice about it.  The problem is no one knows what he looks like and no one  has seen him in action.  The real Vash is right under their noses, but can  that hapless dork who ""scarfs donuts like a hog in heat"", peeks  in on pretty girls in the shower, and can drink a town drunk under the  table really be the merciless gunman?  He's the only one that fits the  description...",954201600,6,1192,4.583732057416268

1065236,5,6305753172,"Trigun remains one of the best anime of all time; combining a full cast of fully dimensional characters who you want to know more about and hang out with, humor that pleases all crowds including the thoughtful adult, plenty of action but without a reliance on gore, and a thought provoking plot that unfolds skillfully over the ~26 episodes.  The artwork is fun, through and through, with cleverly chosen sequencing to generate effect and maximize utility.  I tend to find the artwork similar to, although in my opinion considerably better than, that of cowboy bebop.  Ultimately, the series is truly synergistic (whole greater than the sum of individual parts), although great things can be said about the art, voice acting, plot, characters, comedic range, and attractiveness to all age groups.  The only disappointment watching Trigun...is that it cannot last forever; however, Trigun bears the hallmark of a truly great production...an evergreen enjoyment factor (watch them again and again!); any anime owner worth their salt should own a copy.",1479513600,3,1049,5.226190476190476

Trigun fillows the adventures of Vash the Stampede, wandering gunman seeking justice, spreading a message of love and peace, and mnaging to get out of situations without killing anyone.  The setting is a desert planet named Gunsmoke, with technology sparse and populations in distant cities and vilages, noto mention tons of outlaws--basically, it's a Space Western.
The first episode--The $$60,00,00,00 Man (watch the episode and you'll see that it's not a typo)--introduces Vash and sends him on his first quest involving Meryl Stryfe and Milly Thompson, to insurance agents sent to evaluate ALL damages done by Vash the Stampede.

1065346,5,6305753172,"After first borrowing the DVD from a library and watching it, I loved it and since Amazon had it for $20, I figured that it was a good deal. This contains the first four episodes of the Trigun series(of which I believe there are 26 episodes), where the main characters (Vash, Milly, Meril [may be mispelled])are introduced. The first three episodes have no real correlation to the manga, but they are still funny, and if you want to go straight to the storyline that resembels the manga, then get the second volume. It is a very good video and it's not as expensive as some other mangas are, and I highly recommend it.",1199059200,,618,4.477876106194691
1065347,3,6305753172,"I saw the first episode in Japanese not long ago, which reminded me of way back when, when I had seen some of the later episodes, which I loved.  Episode one was cool too, so I went ahead and bought this.  I was a tad dissapointed at teh other episodes.  While not outright terrible, they do leave something to be desired (and not just because Vash never even fires a gun)The plots and such seem underdeveloped and sometimes a bit silly.  Nevertheless, this volume had its moments, and was pretty funny at some points.  Its a fair start to a series that get really really good (as I recall).

I don't regret buying it at all.

Two insurance agents, Meryl and Millie, are out to prevent further destruction and insurance losses.  As they go about handing out doughnuts, they keep running into this goofy guy who answer to Vash.  This can't be the evil destroyer that they are trying to stop.  Well worth watching and adding to any Japanese anime collection.  For us parents, there are no sex scenes only mild language issues to worry about.  Now I can't wait to see the rest of the series.

Vash the Stampede has a reputation that makes the actual article seem pale in comparison.  That is why Meryl, an insurance adjuster, and many others simply cannot believe that this dork has a six billion dollar bounty on his head.  Sometimes we viewers cannot believe it either.

The guns in Trigun are very clever gadgets.  It is a joy to watch them in action.  The opening and closing animation is very cool.",1134432000,,582,4.712871287128713
1065350,4,6305753172,"If you're the slightest bit interested in anime, then you've heard of Trigun, or you've at least seen pictures of Vash the Stampede, in his long red coat and round yellow glasses. But you don't necessarily know what it's about. I had no idea what to expect, but Vash's name and look made me think of a gothic, slightly gorey series.

So I was quite surprised when I watched the first episode and saw Vach giggle like a moron and stuff himself with donuts while hysterically scrambling to dodge bullets. Then I started giggling myself.

In a very distant future, on a planet rather like Earth, but with two suns, society appears to be basically a hi-tech Western. Vash the Stampede is a notorious gunman, known for causing destruction wherever he goes, without provoking a single death. Bounty hunters from all over are tracking him down, as are Meryl and Milly, who work for an insurance agency Vash's antics are costing a lot of money. But these people on Vash's trail keep running into this goofy, lecherous, big-hearted idiot with a knack for getting into trouble, as well as for getting out of it. Could he really be Vash the Stampede?

Lots of comedy in this first volume, maybe sometimes a little too much, which may turn some people off. It gets more serious as the series progresses, though, and this volume is definetely good enough to make you want to check out the rest. What seduced me, personnally, was the stylish Cowboy Bebop-like universe (only more down-to-earth) and Vash's personnality. Sure, he's a bit much at times, but overall, he's one of the most charming and endearing characters I've ever seen - you can tell there's a lot of potential there. Meryl and Milly are rather weak characters, so far, Meryl being the standard nag and the giant Milly being eternally ditzy. There isn't much of a plotline so far, it's mostly one catastrophe after another as everyone keeps looking for Vash and he ends up miraculously saving the day. Not much depth or psychology yet, but it sure is a lot of fun!",1100131200,3,2016,4.673239436619719
1065351,5,6305753172,"How did Vash the Stampede, notorious gunman with a 60,000,000,000 double dollar bounty on his head become the most wanted man on the planet when it's proven he hates violence and never fires a shot in all four of these episodes? That's what he'd like to know.

In a genre of anime that is normally depicted as very violent (the sci-fi genre), Trigun stands out since the main character is a pacifist of the highest order. He refuses to even kill in self defense, prefering to simply put the bad guy out of commission. Vash is really a bit of a dork and likes nothing more than food and trying to sweet talk pretty girls, but by the very nature of who he is he gets caught in a life very different from the peace loving existance he wants.

The 60,000,000,000 Man- The first episode and first look at Vash. You get the impression from his first scene that he's a gunslinging tough guy, but that is a false impression as the episode later proves. Enter Milly and Meryl the insurance girls sent to prevent Vash the Stampede from causing any more damage if they can find him, which is harder than it sounds considering no one knows what he looks like. Vash crosses pathes with the girls, but Meryl just can't believe such a sweet natured goof ball would be the notorious Vash. We also get to see the first time Vash proves how good he really is as he is forced to save himself and the whole group without a gun.

Truth of Mistake- The girls again run across Vash as he is working as the bodyguard of a man in charge of the town's water supply. Once again Vash saves the day and makes it all look like an accident. There is also more confusion for Meryl as another woman they run across implies that there is something special about Vash and that men like him are ""real men"" rather than the goof ball persona Vash puts on.

Peace Maker- Vash befriends a former gun maker whose family was killed by one of his own guns. With a knife that flips out of his boot and a deep psychological understanding of pain, Vash sets about making things right. And getting drunk. Very very drunk.

Love and Peace- Waltzing into the middle of a hostage situation, Vash is forced to figure out how to save both the hostages and the criminals. Vash again proves that he can save a situation wihtout looking like he's doing anything but bumbling around.

For a sci-fi series that is portrayed as being very series, Trigun is actually quite comical with a main character who is totally endearing. It's also a good statement against violence in it's own way.",1099008000,5,2530,4.418454935622318

1065421,5,6305753172,"i'll admit that when i first bought this dvd i was disappointed.  i knew that he never killed anyone and was kind of goofy.  but judging from the cover you think that vash is this badass, gunslinger- which is what i wanted. i'm glad i was wrong.
the first episode starts out with these thugs/bounty hunters hunting down vash (the $60,000,000,000 man) and shoot up this saloon to the ground because vash is inside.  when the smoke clears, vash cooly gets up from his barstool, takes out his huge handgun, and points at the bad guys..... <end of scene>
right about here i was like, oh my god this is going to be so cool. but vash isn't the cool guy the first 2 minutes makes him out to be.  5 minutes later it shows what happens after he points his gun at the bad guys and..well i won't ruin it, but it's here you see how light-hearted and goofy this series is.
after this first episode i was disappointed because this wasn't the cool, western, gun-fighting anime i thought it was.  instead it was a wacky, goofy comedy.  i didn't watch the rest of the dvd for like a week.  but i'm glad i gave it a second chance.
vash is a total dork who rarely fires his gun, and is always making goofy faces and crazy, funny animation. i don't want to give anything away, but vash is such a dork and it's hilarious the way he handles himself in every episode.
overrall, trigun is a nice change of pace from all the dramatic, serious anime that there is an abundance of.  if you're in the mood for a funny cartoon with goofy animation and great characters, trigun is very entertaining and highly recommended, regardless of age.  i really don't see why this show deserves any less than 4 stars.  i gave it a 5, but remove 1-2 stars if all you really like are serious dramatic anime, and dislike wacky animation and a lot of comedy.

1065425,3,6305753172,"This video contains the first four episodes of the ""Trigun"" series.  ""Trigun"" is probably my favorite anime series, but I'm not a huge fan of these episodes.  ""Trigun"" starts out as a weird and wacky spoof of spaghetti westerns, then gradually turned darker and more thoughtful.  Season 1 is largely content to be funny and wild.  The episodes on this video, in particular, are largely self-contained, setting up events so as to portray the hero, Vash the Stampede, as a good-natured, bumbling fool.  In fact, most of the early plotlines revolve around the idea that the main character is too much a humorous bumbler to actually be Vash, 'the Humanoid Typhoon.'
I'd probably rate these this video as 3 1/2 stars, with the series as a whole getting 4 1/2 stars.  Still, these four episodes are fun to watch, full of weird villians, entertaining action sequences, and they do begin to establish the characterizations.  Actually, my main complaint with these four episodes is that they present a much more simplistic take on the title character than is revealed later on.

It's the old west with a twist. There are old saloons with pinball machines in them. Sherrifs with 6-shooters face off with a random selection of twanging guitars, ripping rock riffs or heavy metal bass lines. It's a blend of a variety of styles.
And into all of this strolls Vash. He's got a flowing red trenchcoat and cool Janis Joplin sunglasses. He's the epitome of cool. That is, until something surprises him, at which point he turns into a clumsy, goofy teenage boy - his normal self. And this probably is what makes him so endearing.
Chasing after Vash are an endless stream of bounty hunters. There are also a pair of female insurance agents hoping to put an end to his path of destruction. The women, Meryl Stryfe and Milly Thompson, aren't convinced that this silly guy could possibly be the notorious gunman.
Vash doesn't hurt anybody - in fact he doesn't like the sight of blood - but the tales about him spread around the western towns like tumbleweeds in a typhoon. And so his reputation gets him into trouble, his bounty attracts in a wealth of interesting characters, and through it all his humor and cocky attitude save the day.

1065485,5,6305753172,"There's always at least one in every genre: the fan-favorite. The series that an enormous following of fans will point out as an excellent example of whatever genre it belongs to while others wonder why exactly it's so appealing. Examples in anime include the controversial ""Neon Genesis Evangelion"" and the style-over-substance ""Noir"", but for many anime fans their preferred fan-favorite is the sci-fi western comedy-drama ""Trigun"".
Vash the Stampede. The Humanoid Typhoon. The Sixty Billion Double-Dollar Man. He is known by many names, and his reputation is feared across the land. He is a legendary gunman who is said to gun down anyone who dares stand up to him. The enormous bounty on his head is living proof that he is a dangerous outlaw with the devil's luck and death's touch...or is he? Is Vash really a soft-hearted pacifist who actually prefers not to use his gun? Is the Humanoid Typhoon really nothing more than a bumbling idiot who chases after women and munches on doughnuts? That's what everyone who comes into contact with him find hard to believe, and yet he somehow always comes out on top. Who is this guy? Is he the real Vash the Stampede...?
The first four episodes do a good job of setting up the back story of who Vash the Stampede is and what to expect. Contrary to what the front cover may indicate, ""Trigun"" isn't the most serious anime serious out there. While other shows such as ""Cowboy Bebop"" and ""Outlaw Star"" may incorporate humor within their story's frameworks, they never reach the level of near-slapstick like ""Trigun"" does. The main characters' pleasantry-like personalities is a very key component to the series, and it's this element that either keeps viewers tuned in or turns people off when the series gets darker and more serious further on. As for the episodes themselves, the first two are excellent in execution and design, introducing the main characters and setting the stage for what's about to follow. The last two are above average, merely filler episodes that simply emphasize what we've already learned in the first two episodes. Even so, all four episodes do a good job of establishing everyone's expectations and getting ready for what lies ahead.
Visually, ""Trigun"" is a beautiful anime series...at least when it was first released. While it may not hold up against contemporary series such as ""Ghost in the Shell TV"" and ""Inu-Yasha"", ""Trigun"" is still a marvelous series to look at. With character designs that are polished versions of their manga counterparts (the series is based off the manga of the same name), well-done surroundings, and relatively smooth animation, the art direction (done by studio Madhouse of ""Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust"" fame) still looks good enough to satisfy the modern anime fan demanding quality visuals.
Audio-wise, the score does its job but isn't the most memorable soundtrack out there. The most outstanding piece is most certainly the series opening, ""H.T"", a hard-rocking guitar instrumental that's both catchy and attention-grabbing. The rest of the soundtrack, including the ending, sadly isn't as impressive, although it certainly fits the mood of the series quite well.
Pioneer has managed to give ""Trigun"" one of the best dubs on the market today. They even found the perfect voice actor to play Vash the Stampede: Johnny Yong Bosch, best remembered for his stint as a Power Ranger. With the same tone and pitch, Bosch manages to recreate the Japanese Vash into English perfectly; his faithful voicing of Vash deserves comparison to David Lucas' memorable performance as Spike Spiegel of ""Cowboy Bebop"". The rest of the voice cast give admirable jobs, managing to create a stellar dub that some sub fans might even want to give a try.
Overall, the first ""Trigun"" DVD, ""The $$60,000,000,000 Man"" is a great way to start a great series. Not everyone will appreciate its unique flavor and how it later evolves, but anime fans looking for an interesting twist in their sci-fi need not look further than ""Trigun"". And those wanting something representing almost everything anime is known for should also give ""Trigun"" a try; it's practically the living definition of ""fan-favorite"".",1044057600,5,4181,5.043352601156069

1065487,5,6305753172,"Hehe......Trigun is absolutely HILARIOUS!
My experiance with Trigun: Well, I've only seen this first one, but since it's the one I'm reviewing, it's ok :) Well, the first few minutes may seem quite serious (I was really wondering why my HUMOR LOVING friend was making me watch it).....but then it got funny! For the rest of the episodes, I was cracking up every other minute!
About the video: This was a really great video, with really great episodes :) :P I think it had 4 (episodes, I mean....4 EPISODES) ^^;;
About the episodes: It begins with Vash in a bar......listening to 2 guys talk about him. Except they were calling him ""The Humanoid Typhoon"" and such. From this, you get a very scary image of Vash O_o Well, anyway, the rest of the episode is about Vash being captured. Heh, that's also about when you'll start cracking up :P Not to long after Vash gets captured, 2 of our other main cast (Meryl & Milly) come along and accidentally rescue him!(well THEY didn't really RESCUE him....). And besides, they thought the person who had CAPTURED him was Vash.....they didn't think the dorky captured dude was him :P Anywho.....then, THEY got captured. Puh! What's an idiotic dorky (though kinda cute) ""Humanoid Typhoon"" to do?
Well I'd tell you about the other episodes, but I can't tell you because then you'll know a bit of the end of the first one!!!!!! Heh....and I REALLY don't wanna spoil a great video like this :) Oh, and just FYI, I usually don't really like dubbed animes........but this was great! You TOTALLY thought of the Vash actor as Vash!

However, be warned that there is far more to it than that.  As the series progresses, more ideas and conflicts about morals will come up, and more people will be hurt.  But just when things might get quite heavy, there is always some humor; however it is never garish and strikes just the right note.
This is an excellent anime which is actually about something... definitely watch it if you ever wonder about the morality of taking a life to save others--or about war--or crime--or guns--or really anything involving people being hurt.",1017100800,,807,4.818840579710145
1065491,4,6305753172,"Generally, I don't like silly anime too much.  I kept telling myself that this first disc annoyed me, even though I kept catching myself laughing out loud.  And occasionally, there was the flash of something that made me say, wait a minute, this goofball shouldn't have been able to do that....should he?
Yes, this first disc is mostly silly comedy relieved by fast-moving but lighthearted action scenes.  But see, that's how they rope you in.  As the series progresses in the later discs, it can't be emphasized enough that this isn't, after all, a comedy...just as Vash himself is more than that goofy facade he cultivates to fool the unwary.
After this disc, I had to go on the 'Net and see if it was worth it to keep watching, so I read all the spoilers and knew the entire story ahead of time.  And the last DVD of this series *still* left me stunned at the emotional impact of all four episodes.  Just....stunned.
In a nutshell:  If you like comedic anime, this first disc is probably a good bet.  If you like dramatic anime, stick it out:  it gets better and keeps on going.
(The reason Trigun didn't get that fifth star:  I'd have like some better development of the Gung-ho Guns.  They come off as toss-off villians of the week, even though they do have a purpose in the context of the story.  From what I've seen, they've got a bit more backstory in the manga.

The fact that this guy just happens to be at the wrong place at the wrong time makes it an absolute scream.(be warned, it's best suited for ages 13 and up, maybe a little younger) The rest of the episodes are just as funny, but with more of a plot. The animations of his face change so rapidly that you just have to laugh. And when they do, you laugh even harder. He screams like a girl, and runs like a monkey.

Vash is an outlaw, and a stupid one at that. Add one man of the cloth (Wolfwood), and two insurance company representatives (Milly and Meryl), some donuts, and an ace gunman that likes to peep at pretty ladies, mix, enjoy.  Now THAT's comedy.

When I first saw it I was expecting a very serious, calm, always knows what to do, always gets the girl kind of main character, but the main character, Vash The Stampede is a very funny main character.  Once I looked at it from that point of view I realized that Vash is the kind of character that makes a good series!  Vash is a man with a price on his head for $$60,000,000,000 and for something he hasn't done.  Wherever this man goes trouble always follows.  People say he's killed thousands but there has never been a record of Vash ever killing one person.  Though Vash may act stupid at times he can be very serious and there is a hidden depth to this character along with a hidden past.

1065533,4,6305753172,"If you're considering watching Trigun, don't let the first video/DVD throw you off. The first video, for the most part, is just humour. Ive seen the entire series, and Trigun is NOT a pure comedy. If you watch the first video and hate it for being a stupid comedy, at least see the second video before you judge the entire series. By the second video Trigun begins to turn serious with comedic moments rather than the other way around.
The story doesnt seem very deep at the beginning; it centres on a mysterious man named Vash the Stampede, an outlaw with a $$60 Billion bounty on his head. A dangerous man, capable of destroying entire towns. But hes also a klutz, and his enemies refuse to believe hes the real Vash the Stampede when they see what a goof he is. While the first video shows very little of the series main plot, it works as an introduction to Vash and the insurance girls, Milly and Meryl. If you don't care for them, there are plenty of awesome characters that are not introduced until later (Wolfwood, Knives, and Legato to name a few).
Trigun is not nearly as goofy as the first video makes it seem. You quickly discover that Vash has a complicated past, and that his motto of Love and Peace isn't all its cracked up to be. Later episodes can be extremely dark and bloody at times, though they are hardly ever ultra-violent. The characters are memorable and very human; I developed a genuine attachment to them, even some that appeared only for an episode, and it was the first time in any show Ive never once wanted the villains to win. I laughed at the banter between Vash and other characters. I was on the edge of my seat during the intense gun fights and tense confrontations. I cried during the sad, emotional scenes (and there are PLENTY of them later in the series). A series that can make me genuinely laugh AND cry is a rare thing.
There are some nit-picky things I didn't like about Trigun, but very few. As Ive said, this series is not a pure comedy, so the first video really gives a wrong impression of the series as a whole. The music is quite good overall, everything from western blues to harsh electronics to pretty vocal pieces, and perfectly appropriate to a western-sci-fi setting; but they have a habit of playing songs at very inappropriate times in the show, and killing the dramatic effect of some scenes. But that can be overlooked, and the good far exceeds the bad.
This isn't so much a review of the first video/DVD as an encouragement to overlook it and get to the meat of the series. If you don't like it by the end of the second video, you might as well forget about it. But don't judge the whole series by the first video alone.",997833600,5,2681,4.440162271805274

Each episode begins with an impressive intoduction, flashy pictures zip by depicting a man with spikey blonde hair, an unreal red trenchcoat and one mean looking pistol. Without spoiling anything, once the actuall episode begins, not only does the animation quality dip tremendously, but we find the main character (who`s name is Vash) is geek, a pascificst, and accident prone. I suppose there`s nothing wrong with this, but I wonder why the intro tries so hard to convince viewers of the opposite. All claims to originallity that this anime series makes are completely unfounded. The wild west setting loses it`s novelty almost imediately because the show is so brimming with over used animation nuances that it`s virtually indestinguishable from other ""humor"" animes, regardless of setting. The show merely funny for an anime and not genuinely funny. Worst of all, the animation bottoms out in the last episode, which is so unspeakably poor that it can only be described as an utter travesty.

Vash the Stampede, the Humanoid Typhoon, is the most feared man in the universe.  The only catch is: he's....well...a pansie.  Vash can't stand the site of blood and instead of an appetite for danger his only appetites include women and donuts.  Lots of donuts.

1065648,5,6305753172,"I'd like to start off by saying that the only contact I had with Trigun before I bought the DVD, was the action figure made by Mcfarlane toys... by looking at the figure, or by looking at the cover of the DVD, you might get the wrong idea about what Trigun is. The first few episodes of Trigun start off as a wacky comedy with some action, which may put off some people. However, if you give it time and watch some more episodes, you will be pleasantly suprised. Slowly, you get to learn how much of a complex character Vash is, and that he really isn't the total idiot that you might think. Each episode (after about 4 or 5) reveal more and more about Vash's character and who he is.
To sum it all up, although I actually enjoy the wacky comedy in Trigun, that isn't really what it is all about. If you didn't like the first DVD, try and watch a few more episodes, as you will probably change your mind.
Finally I'd just like to point out some of the other things that makes this worth owning. The packaging of the DVD itself is beautiful, and so are the animated menus on the DVD, which are really VERY well done. There's only a few extras, like artwork and stuff like that, but it is a lot better than some of the other featureless anime DVD's I have seen in the past. There is also a choice of Japanese dialogue with subtitles, as well as English dubbed - the dubbing is actually suprisingly good, and they definitely chose actors that suit each character.

But don't judge this series by just the first dvd, watch the entire thing - it does get serious, with a great story and quite a few plot twists. In my opinion, this is a lot better than Cowboy Bebop (which is still worth watching), so if you liked that, you'll love this. And remember, we all need LOVE and PEACE!",981158400,2,1094,4.475
1065655,5,6305753172,"You're probably wondering just how much of an action this is, or just how funny it really is. Well, let me just start off by saying, don't let the McFarlane Toys action figure fool you. When I saw that toy, I thought Trigun would be a really brutal guns & bullets anime with a hip sci fi theme.
In actuallity, after investigating the anime and then buying & watching it myself, it turned out Trigun is a western. Now, in this western we have a fair amount of action, with some very cool weapons. It's not terribly bloody, just violent at times. Also, there is a good deal of comedy thrown in, in the same way ""Lethal Weapon"" does. The difference between Vash the Stampede and Mel Gibson is that Vash is a lot goofier.
I enjoyed this anime very much and look forward to seeing the other volumes. The animation is very nice, the characters are personable, and it is a lot of fun. It wasn't as humorous as I expected, but I wasn't disappointed, either. It's not ""Dragon Half"" or ""Wicked City""....there is comedy and there is violence, but it doesn't lean one way or the other. Keep that in mind, as people seem to be fooled by the cover.
Anyway, it is an enjoyable anime and I recommend it. The DVD edition is great, too. It has perfect dubbed and subtitled versions (the subtitled version is the best, of course), as well as some nice bonus features, including character sketches. Be sure to check Trigun out!",979689600,6,1407,4.436293436293436
1065656,5,6305753172,"This is the way every outlaw should be. Vash the Stampede goes right down in history with Robin Hood, Pretty Boy Floyd, and Billy the Kid -- gunslingers (more or less) who rock.
  One of the best things about anime is the complexities to their characters. In the US we have, um, Mickey Mouse and Bugs, all wonderful animals, sure, but they haven't got a whole lot of character. Whereas we have Vash, the double-edged sword who can be serious one minute and totally goofy the next. He's a complete idiot and yet a compassionate pacifist.

I was very pleasantly surprised by this first Trigun disc -- it was quite funny and sweet, and the light plot contained deeper undertones than expected.  The animation was quite good, although episode 2 did possess some strange fuzziness that was a bit annoying.  I haven't seen the rest of the series yet (I plan on renting them from Netflix ASAP), and so far I don't love it so much that I would purchase it, but I think any anime fan will like Trigun and thus I strongly recommend it.",978393600,2,682,4.396825396825397

Not anymore.
Enter Trigun.  A refreshingly cool, funny anime title with the central idea of ""Love and Peace!"" hits Amazon with a BANG!  The story is centered on the main character, Vash, AKA The Human Typhoon, AKA Vash the Stampeede.  The people see him as a murdurer and a city destroyer, and the latter is correct, in a weird way.  He just tries to be a normal Joe and doesn't stir up trouble, but it always seems to find its way to him and may God help the city he's in when it finds him.  Normaly a cool customer, when he's irked, he's ready to take out the trash.  Armed with three guns, one black, one white, and one you never want to see, his marksmanship is unmatched.  In the end, not one person is dead and he preaches to the masses the importance of ""Love and Peace!"", and you'd better listen!
Humorous to the end, the comedy never lets up.  Take a chance on Trigun; you won't be dissapointed.",976406400,4,1082,4.321782178217822

Between his daring acrobatics, pristine shooting skills, dashing good looks, and slapstick humor, Vash puts on a show that is enjoyed by all.  If you're a die-hard anime fan or just a person looking for a good action flick, look no further.  Trigun will fill every person's entertainment needs.",976320000,,545,4.530612244897959

Trigun is a full-blown comedy!  Don't get me wrong, there is violence and some cool, but it is balanced by the bumbling idiocy of the main character, Vash the Stampede.  Trigun tells Vash's story.  Set on a desert planet, Vash goes from town to town, gunslinging and righting wrongs.  Unfortunately, he is a little clumsy, and he usually ends up destroying the town he is trying to save.  I'm sure you can see how it's a comedy.  Trigun is an overall good video, and most of the stories promote good morals.  Vash's actions are heroic, even if he does mess up a lot.  One of the downfalls is the bad language, which is relatively strong, even for anime.  A good observer would notice, however, that Vash never utters a dirty word, only the bad guys.  There is almost no blood, and the violence is just really intense.  I would reccomend it if you are looking for something silly, or a good Western!",975024000,2,1053,4.502645502645502

Vash seems to survive by dumb luck, but he actually has a great deal of skill and can actually dodge bullets.  Sometimes he seems like a pretty cool hero, but then he always does something stupid to make you think less of him.
Vash's being trailed by insurance agents who don't know who are assigned to evaluate disasters caused by him.  They don't know his true identity, but their lives have been miserable since the day they met him.
I got this anime because of other positive reviews I read online.  I was really quite pleased to see it was just like I hoped: a light action/comedy (instead of mindless shooting & violence which is what I thought it was judging from the DVD cover & description).

You expect Vash to be all big and bad, and he'san idiotic freak who tries to look up some poor girl's skirt whilethey're both being held hostage.  Meryl refuses to believe that such adork can be Vash.  Her partner, Milly, believes it but treats him likea normal person.  (I really don't know what I was trying to say thereor how to phrase it).  I was slightly disappointed when I found out itwas a dub (one of my friends lent it to me) but was delighted when Ifound out it wasn't censored.

Its  is just so funny at sometimes and Vash is a raging geek, yet somehow pulls  off this coolness that makes people like him.

As a fan of anime, this title caught my eye due to it's  above average artwork and incredible word of mouth reputation.  Before I  say anything else, I will say this anime has pretty awesome artwork and  excellent character design.  Thats what makes me mad though.  This anime  could have been HUGE, were it given the proper treatment w/ plot,  storyline, and character actions.  This movie is so amazingly dopey-dumb it  amazes me.  Vash's image is shattered once he opens his mouth to spout some  gee whilikers sentiment.  I'm not some depraved ULTRA violence fiend, but  this anime BEGGED for a harder edge to it.  Those of you who are saying to  yourselves, ""but the plot is the substance, not the action"" also  make a mute point.  The plotlines are just plain silly.  If it's a mystery,  it owes homage to Scoobydo mystery lineage.  If it's action, it is a small  step above the garbage they show on Saturday mornings.

The  characters are well-drawn, well-animated, and each have their own distint  personality, none drawing from the standard cliched anime stereotypes.  Vash, the main character, is animated in manners different from the  standard anime expressions, etcetera.  The animatiors obviously had a gun  fetish, as Vash's awesome six-shooter is one of the most unique pistols  I've seen in a good while.  The opening sequence of the first episode is  amazing, with the gun damage being absolutely _the_ _best_ representation  of small-arms damage I've _ever_ seen.  It's something that has to be  witnessed to be believed.
I'll put it this way:  I've been watching anime  since I was about seven, I'm seventeen now, and this is probably the best  series I've seen yet.  If you have a chance to buy the second DVD also, do  so.  It's just as good.",961286400,,901,5.006802721088436

Vash the Stampede is donut scarfing,  tall, goofball kind of guy. He consistantly wanders into town and due to  some kind of accident or another, ends up wiping out the whole town. Hence  the $$60,000,000,000 bounty on his head. This is a great flick and one of  the few animes that I actually thought was better in english.

I was highly skeptical because I rarely go for goofy anime, and usually avoid dubs when humanly  possible. However, with that said, let me go back to my ""wow"".  Trigun was incredibly hilarious and I surprised myself with laughing  outloud, quite often, at some genuinely funny antics. The fist volume (yes,  I do speak of the /dubbed/ version) was actually remarkably well done-from  the animation to the voice acting-it got me hooked onto the series and all  the characters. I also *really* *really* like Vash the Stampede, for  reasons I can't quite put a name to. He was just the most incredibly dorky  guy I'd ever seen... and at the same time, he was incredibly cool (and very  sweet, despite his label as being the ""Humanoid Typhoon"", and his  notorious skirt-chasing nature ^^;) I dunno, maybe it was the coat, but  there was something else very neat about him, like there was more going on  with him then he's letting on (and of course there /is/). It's kind of a  paradox to talk about Vash, since describing him would be like continuously  contridicting yourself.

While you expect Vash to be a dangerous and cruel criminal, instead  you get a silly geeky character who amazingly avoids getting killed in any  situation. The action sequences are way cool with unexpectedly almost no  bloodshed, Vash can take out his opponents without even killing them and  hurting himself. No one ever dies from a confrontation with him. You have  to see it to believe it. For the first DVD episodes, there is a lot of  great humor...which some people might find a little overdone if they are  not used to anime. But as you will find out later on the up coming DVDs,  the humor is needed to build upon Vash's character and the plot turns  serious. Beneath that silly veneer lies a man haunted by his past who has  vowed to never kill again. The music for the series fits right in. The  animation is exellent in quality as well.  Go BUY it now!

That's the only episode that made me  laugh aloud. The other three are good also and keeps your interest so it is  worth checking out.

7893785,5,6305753172,"Trigun is a classic series dealing with the morality of violence and whether it's ever justified to take another life, set against the backdrop of humanity eking out an existence on a desert planet. On this ""western"" styled planet, one outlaw looms large - Vash the Stampede, an outlaw wanted across the land for his acts of destruction, yet every event of outrageous obliteration seems to leave everyone alive and relatively unharmed. We start the series with a man called Vash, a spikey-haired, red-garb wearing, donut-loving goof who seems as opposite from ""dangerous outlaw"" as you could possibly get. But, as the series progresses, you find out more about Vash and his past while seeing the stories of his companions, including the strong-willed Meryl and occasionally-oblivious Millie, two determined from the Bernardelli Insurance society tasked with following Vash due to his devastation in his wake, as well as Nicolas D. Wolfwood, a traveling gun-totting preacher.

""Trigun"" is a classic show with excellent pacing, mature themes (but never forgets to have fun with as well), a terrific cast (the dubbed audio is fantastic), and an excellent soundtrack. It's a series that starts from episodic adventures that naturally morphs into a grand story about the nature of humanity, violence, and what it means to be human without being overly preachy or stopping the narrative for poetic asides. There are moments of joy, comedy, terror, depression, and hope, and always with the writing earning each and every peak and valley it shoots for with ease. This show deserves a slot as one of the best anime series of all time with some of the most endearing and memorable cast of characters ever put to paper.
