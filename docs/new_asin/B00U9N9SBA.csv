7031218,1,B00U9N9SBA,I want my hour back that I wasted on this stupid movie.,1427587200,,55,3.6666666666666665
7031219,5,B00U9N9SBA,good movie,1427241600,,10,4.5
7031220,4,B00U9N9SBA,Sometimes I had a  little trouble  following the  plot but did enjoy the movie. Really liked the  ending.,1474588800,,105,4.666666666666667
7031221,3,B00U9N9SBA,"A slight twist to the 'trip to the woods to be sad for someone' flick. The forest setting / action was a little strained and predictable. However, it was just a hub for what I consider the 'real' movie. And that's where I thought they did a good job filling in backstory in pieces as the forest drama was unfolding.",1474329600,,315,4.266666666666667
7031222,4,B00U9N9SBA,"Don't understand the one star reviews. Ok so it has some issues, like actors that were not so great.  At least the ""friends in the woods with a murderer"" theme was your the standard one.  A lot of the film was back story told via flash-backs and it was at least enough to stay interested.  Quite a twisted tale indeed!",1474070400,,318,4.266666666666667
7031223,4,B00U9N9SBA,"This is a good thriller. It has great suspense and action throughout. The characters are believable and interesting. Even though the movie is told mostly in flashbacks, it helped to unravel the mystery and resolve this whodunit type of movie. There were a couple of loose ends that were not explained such as the why one of the main characters was targeted to begin with. But overall, a clever and suspenseful thriller.",1473811200,,419,4.833333333333333
7031224,1,B00U9N9SBA,"Oh my gosh, this was so confusing.  There are flashbacks, flash forwards, flash sidewards and maybe an upside down one. Adultery, prostitution, murder and even all of that wasn't enough to save this movie",1473465600,,204,5.0
7031225,4,B00U9N9SBA,"This is a pretty decent movie in my opinion. I've seen better, but I've also seen MUCH WORSE. The plot was interesting, and I think the acting is good. It doesn't seem low budget to me. Was definitely worth a watch.",1473206400,,215,4.2682926829268295
7031226,2,B00U9N9SBA,Low quality.  BTDT script.  Weak acting. Need I say more?,1429401600,,57,4.6
7031227,2,B00U9N9SBA,Ok,1428019200,,2,2.0
7031228,1,B00U9N9SBA,"This movie was a waste of time. Not only It was a crappy movie, it arrived at my house, supposedly a new tape, it had no shrink wrap and was held closed with a single strip of scotch tape. The cover art on the case was a bad copy and to top it off it was shipped loose in the case. It was even on a DVR instead of a regular DVD. Save your money, save your time and get a different movie altogether.",1427673600,3,398,3.75
7031229,1,B00U9N9SBA,"IMDB shows this was released in 2012, not 2015. It had an $80K Budget. That is really all that needs to be said. You have been warned!",1427587200,4,134,4.0

8704770,3,B00U9N9SBA,"Was a pretty good ""Who done it"" type of movie, but the ending (honestly about the last 1/3 of the movie) could have really put this movie from an ok movie to really really good movie!",1500249600,,183,4.111111111111111
8704771,1,B00U9N9SBA,"unwatchable.  slow as molasses.  to say the writing is sophomoric would be a compliment.  not even silly-bad that you could laugh at it, mind-numbingly awful.  I got though about 70% of it.  It's like watching a painful high school play.",1486857600,,237,4.825

worst plot movie I have seen in a while !!!",1476921600,,175,3.7567567567567566
