8439060,1,B004RIACRM,"I bought this disc hoping to see what it is called ""scenic routes"". To see beautiful trails and roads and rivers.
After watching 1/2 hr of the program ""Japan"", all they actually showed were a few brief clips of cherry trees and a shot of a river and a mountain.
90% of it seemed to be footage of dirty cities and interviews with people about their culture (including naked Japanese men in a hot springs), talk of making robots more human, talk of the dwindling population issue, etc, etc, etc, talk, talk, talk, NO SCENIC ROUTES.
So, if you want to hear about the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings yet again, watch Japanese men play with bows and talk about the economy and hear their thoughts on the past and the future of Japan, then great. But if you want to see SCENIC ROUTES, I am afraid you will be completely ripped off. It does not get much more misleading than this. Why not just say it's a pouch of apple seeds, and then send you asparagus seeds?",1308700800,16,954,4.395480225988701
