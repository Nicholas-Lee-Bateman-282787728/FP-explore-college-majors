3519990,5,B001CU5O9Y,"I saw the original program when it was first shown on the History Channel. To me it is the ultimate example of the strength and flexibility of the human spirit. Most of the Mountain Men started with only the desire to live free and were willing to face the most severe challenges and even death itself to achieve their desire. The conditions that they faced and conquered seem almost impossible,but in the end they are an ultimate testament to the potential that exists within in all of us. The DVD is both exciting and adventurous,but it's greatest value may be in helping all of us realize that if these individuals were able to overcome the challenges of their world then we all have within us the ability to face and overcome the challenges that our society is facing in the rapidly changing world that we are living in today.",1276905600,3,830,4.577181208053691
3519991,5,B001CU5O9Y,"This video on the Mountain Men is a very in-depth account of their lives and impact on history. It is a mix of interesting stories and history. The scenery is quite amazing and there are dramatic reinactments that are used effectively to tell their story. There are also several graphic examples of the dangers of Mountain man life that include the aftermath of a bear attack--but my 8th grade students really liked that aspect of it. As a teacher of US history, I endorse the use of this for middle-high school. The only limitation for me was its length. It is long and a bit too detailed to be used in its entirety. But I was able to use portions that enhanced my lesson on the role of Mountain Men in westward expansion.",1268092800,9,723,4.443609022556391
3519992,5,B001CU5O9Y,"I ordered a copy of this DVD (AAE-71149) several years back, my version is from 1999.  The show is mostly in color with some black and white, several historians give dialogue throughout the program with most of the notable mountain men discussed.....Hugh Glass, Jim Bridger, Joseph Walker, John Colter, Kit Carson, Peg Leg Smith, Liver Eat'n Johnston, William Ashley, Broken Hand Fitzpatrick, and Jedediah Smith, among others, are portrayed.

The basis of the History Channel program is the book A LIFE WILD AND PERILOUS by noted author Robert M. Utley, with Mr. Utley giving dialogue as the program moves through its 100 minutes or so.  A digital DVD of remarkable color, the times of the mountain men from 1807 through the late 1830s is offered.  One of the longer and more interesting segments of the program concern the annual rendezvous, a two-week coming together of these men during summer months preceeding the coming fall trapping season.

For anyone having interest in the American West of the mountain man era, this DVD is almost something not to be done without.  I've been interested in this topic most of my life, and offer an excellent rating for its work.  Even the most seasoned and knowledgeable person will experience the wonderful high country scenery that accompanies the DVD.

8289291,3,B001CU5O9Y,"In an episode that I viewed last night(possibly a repeat), there was a portion of the episode that featured a ""mountain man"" in eastern Idaho who lived in a tepee on an island in the Snake River ""...near to where the Snake River joins the Columbia River"", according to the program.

The Snake River does, in fact, join the Columbia, but not until it travels through nearly the full length of the State of Idaho, forming a significant portion of the boundary between Idaho and the states of Oregon and Washington, then meandering off through a portion of eastern Washington to where it joins the Columbia, nearly a thousand miles from where this mountain man erected his tepee!!

So how do you define ""near""?! You get a D- in geography. Your show, which isn't bad, will only suffer from errors like this that could be avoided with a simple check of a map.",1377475200,,854,4.57516339869281
