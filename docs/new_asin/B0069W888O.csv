I remember seeing it when it was first on the History Channel and I very much like history.  But this was of personal interest to me although I was very very young when this happened-a toddler.  My Uncle, my Father's eldest brother was a member of the crew of the O9.  At the time of the accident, they really could not come to any conclusion as to what went wrong.  That always bothered my Father,my remaining Uncles and my Grandmother. They always wondered what really happened particularly since my Uncle (who loved submarine duty and though they were safer the automobiles) had expressed serious concerns to at least one brother, about the safety of this sub.  This DVD took a serious look at both the rediscovered wreck and the investigations of the time and using today's technology to try to discover what happened.  They came to some conclusions although it is probably impossible to completely know what happened.  Although it came too late for my Grandmother, my other Uncles and my Father, the family knows where he is something they were never real sure of.  My only other thought is that I would have liked to have seen listed somewhere a list of the other members of the crew along with the Captain.",1359417600,,1336,4.60337552742616
