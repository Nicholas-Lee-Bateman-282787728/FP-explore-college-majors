3848169,5,B0025KVTLW,"Got the DVD for Christmas and have to say it's not so bad. I just read the review which said they were re-releasing this so maybe that's why. Ok, the pic quality is not hi-def and the sound on one or two episodes is a little lower than the others. However, here are all the episodes uncut and (as far and I can tell) unedited and since it is almost impossible to find this show on TV anymore I will take it and be very happy with it. Would bonus features been nice? of course, but that's okay to. Very happy with this (going in with low expectations).",1293580800,22,551,4.111111111111111

3848171,3,B0025KVTLW,"UPDATE 2/8/2011: I received an email that my re-ship went out on Feb. 4th.

UPDATE: WB has since removed the listing from their website, and I have been informed they are working on the issues (not sure about the chapter marks, though).  I contacted customer support and they informed me that I am on the re-ship list when the problems are fixed.  I suggest all who have purchased this to do the same to be sure you will get a new copy.  I am changing my rating to a 3, and possibly a 4 after I receive the new copy.

I bought this directly from WBshop.com, the only place (and price) to get it from.  I'm posting this here as a public service:

I'm not so sure about the quality of these discs...they aren't even dual-layer 8.5GB, they only come in at just over 4GB in size. With 5-6 episodes per disc, that doesn't bode well for the bitrate of the content. It looks grainy as if it was recorded from an over-the-air rabbit-ear broadcast from back in the 80s. It doesn't look like any digital enhancements were done at all.

On my copy, the first episode of the first disc has an audio/video synchronization problem where it is off by about a second. It starts near the middle of the episode and lasts through the end of the episode. I haven't yet found any audio problems with other episodes yet, and I don't know if any other customers have the same audio issue.

Each episode only had 2 chapter marks each, at 10:00 and 20:00...none at the credits, title sequence or scene breaks (where commercials would have been). This is very amateurish and makes for poor DVD navigation.

All-in-all, this set is not even close to being worth the $34.95 competition-free price tag that WB is charging. Monopoly at its finest.",1287446400,67,1717,4.4743589743589745

3848177,5,B0025KVTLW,"I suppose there are a few people out there who have never heard of the comedy series, Night Court, which ran from 1984 to 1992. But for those unfortunate few, they truly do not know what they are missing.

Night Court broke the usual comic mold. Most comedies are centered around a normal central character witnessing the madness around him or her. With Night Court, everyone is nuts, including Harry Anderson, who plays a judge, a figure society assumes is as solid as a rock.

What made this show so darn funny was clever, well-written scripts, the right combination of identifiable personalities (I mean, who does not know a person like Dan Fielding or Christine Sullivan?), and the choice of actors perfectly suited to match their characters, giving performances of the roles of their careers.

There was also an incredible range in its humor. While most comedy series usually find one level of banality and stay there, the comedy in Night Court covered a greater spectrum. Thus, the humor was sometimes poignant, sometimes philosophical, sometimes slapstick, farcical, or even downright dumb, many times in the same episode. The humor, though, was never boring. The humor was intelligent, smart, ... and just darn funny.

The show never really jumped the shark, even when it easily could. In the eighth season a new character, a ditzy Court Reporter, was introduced. So now there are two comic relief characters in the Courtroom, the Court Reporter and one of the Bailiffs, Bull Shannon (Richard Moll.) While introducing a new character to an established routine is usually fatal to the over-all chemistry of the cast, this new character, through deft comic script-writing, fits right in, adding, not hindering, the comic effect.

Recurring actors include John Astin, of Addams Family fame, Yakov Smirnoff, and Mel Torme, who shows incredible acting flair as Harrys idol.

For all those who have not seen this series, check it out.",1498003200,,1936,5.034375

3848208,5,B0025KVTLW,"Season 4 of Night Court really stands out because usually by Season 4( if a TV series lasts that long)the chemistry between the characters starts popping and the characters really bond through that chemistry and it shows . Each character stands out , but Judge Harry and Dan really stand out because both characters really are that good at being funny. In comparison Night Court reminds of John Cleese's Fawlty Towers because each character can stand on their own, but mix them with the rest and you have a very powerful formula for hi octane fuel tomfoolery. I highly recommend  this  series especially if you are a Dan Fielding groupie because he truly shines bright in Season 4.",1470787200,3,681,4.762711864406779
3848209,5,B0025KVTLW,"This review is about the series and not the actual discs:

Night Court established itself as a premier comedy with a knockout cast.  Harry Anderson heads up the court as Judge Harry Stone.  One the bench is lecher Dan Fielding (John Larroquette) and Christine Sullivan (Markie Post).  Bull Shannon and 'Roz' Russell (Richard Mull and Marsha Warfield) play the bailiffs.  Mac Robinson (Charles Robinson) rounds out the cast of regulars.

The comedy is at times lewd, thanks to Dan (Larroquette) and sexist owing to Christine (Post).  Dan continues to court the delightful DA for purposes of adding another notch to his belt.  Luckily, Christine sees enough of Dan at work to know at home cannot possibly be any better.  Harry continues with the jokes and pranks which made him a name in the Night Court.  It's a gas to watch this team at work.  No one is stronger than any other.

The show has some ""un-PC"" moments, but they're mostly harmless when you really look at it. It's a shame that this show isn't popular right now, especially at a time where retro 80s is so big.

3848295,5,B0025KVTLW,"Night Court seasons 4, 5, and 6 are IMHO the best in the series. With the introduction of Roz Russell (played by Marsha Warfield) as the new bailif the cast is finally set. Season 4 starts out not only with her introduction but also the recurring character Buddy Ryan (played by John Aston) who starts out as the husband to the late mother of Harry Stone but is later revealed to be Harry's biological father. The humor also becomes more about the staff of the court than the people on trial, Season 4 starts a tradition in the episode ""A Day in the Life"" where the court has to get through 200+ cases in one night. The latter ones come with all kind of weird reasons as too why they do this, but these episodes are honestly some the funniest and most memorable in the entire series. Other highlights include Bull writing an unintentional scary children's book, Mac and his wife Quon-Lee having a baby and. Quon Lee goes into labor ihas she is about to be sworn in as an American citizen and Mac has needs to have his appendix removed.  .

This season ends on a cliffhanger where NYC is looking to appoint some new judges and constant suck-up Dan Fielding thinks he's got it in the bag only to learn that Christine Sullivan becomes a judge and Harry loses his job and sets out to create the prank of the century.",1423094400,,1312,4.372950819672131

You are hereby sentenced to 22 Hilarious Episodes on 4 Discs as wacky mcnacky Judge Harold Stone (Harry Anderson) is seemingly bounced from the bench, randy-and-ready district attorney Dan Fielding(John Larroquette)is loved into a coma, public defender Christine Sullivan(Markie Post) ends up wielding the gavel, Bull Shannon(Richard Moll) pens a controversial children's book and court clerk Mac Robsinson(Charles Robinson) goes into...labor? This is comedy that delivers.

This 1986-1987 Season takes me back to memory lane to when I was 14 years old in the 8th grade when I used to watch NIGHT COURT every Thursday night after THE COSBY SHOW & FAMILY TIES and when NBC's motto was ""Come Home to NBC"" which was NBC's slogan from the Fall of 1986 to the Summer of 1987.",1392940800,,1096,5.257142857142857

3848400,4,B0025KVTLW,"I would definitely rather have this than no season 4 at all. The rating only loses points because the discs don't live up to the quality of the previous seasons. As for the show itself, if you liked seasons 1-3, you know what you are getting, and should continue to enjoy the evolution of this show. This season introduces Roz, the last major cast change.

The discs are good enough. I understand there were some problems with early versions of this, but I bought mine from the WB shop a week or so before writing this review in 2014. I didn't have any issues with the discs as far as major audio or video problems. These definitely haven't been remastered, though. They probably look a little better than they would over standard cable. Going directly from watching Season 3 to Season 4 was a little jarring at first due to the quality difference, but a couple discs into season 4, I'm used to it. In fact I'd say the show looks dandy on my old 24"" CRT set. When watching on a 40"" or 55"" inch HD set, the difference is much more apparent. Even on the smaller old TV, you can see occasional lines that scroll by quickly, and other analog noise from the tape, but it is very infrequent and never distracting.

They put 4 to 5 episodes on each disc. Season 3 had 7 to 8 episodes per disc. Keep in mind however, that Season 3 was pressed on manufactured DVDs, and dual-layer discs were used. Dual-layer discs hold twice as much as single layer ones. Since Season 4 is burned on DVD-R discs on-demand, it uses single layer discs (dual layer DVD-R discs are more expensive and many players don't like them). This means that the episodes are compressed at a similar size, maybe slightly more, compared to season 3. I notice some compression artifacts from time to time, but nothing that bad.

Overall, great show, and I'm glad that they make the episodes available even when there is less demand by using the on-demand format. They also spend less on transferring the video to DVD, which is apparent, but forgivable. Even the menus are a single picture with an episode list and no sound. I actually like that better, but it is clear they spent more on the previous seasons whose menus had music and some options at least. They do include a 'Play All' selection on the menu, which should be standard but I'm often surprised by sets that lack it. If the rest of the seasons are of this quality, it is good enough for me to buy them. I'd still love to some day have some restored archival quality copies of Night Court, but this is surely better than nothing.

I will say that I'm disappointed that there is no closed captioning on the on-demand seasons. While this doesn't affect me, it should be included for those who need it. Especially since it was already typed up when the show originally aired, it should just be transferred with the show. And who knows, someday I could need them myself.

UPDATE: Doesn't really change the rating, but I've encountered a couple of small things. First, the fourth disc started skipping a lot on the second episode. This was on a cheap Magnavox VCR+DVD combo player (though it played the first 3 discs fine). I tried on my more recent Panasonic Blu-ray player, and it played fine. Burned discs can be inconsistent in quality - some players are better at reading them than others, and some players read certain brands of blank better than others.

The other slight issue is that on my Blu-ray player, most DVDs (including Night Court Seasons 1-3) show a time on the player, so you know how far into the video you are, etc. When I play this it just shows 'DVD' instead of a time. Also, if I hit stop or power off mid-episode, it doesn't resume when I hit play again (it did on the previous seasons and any other DVD I've tried). It makes me sit through the FBI warning then goes to menus like I was playing it the first time. Oddly, the Magnavox VCR/DVD combo mentioned above DOES resume just fine. I imagine this is due to the way the players resume. One probably records a time marker which isn't present on this disc, while the other probably just freezes everything it is doing then resumes it later.

Also, my PC laptop won't play these discs. I was going to watch on my laptop when disc 4 started skipping, but it wouldn't recognize the disc. There IS a warning on the box saying it may not work in PC drives, so I can't really complain. I think this is due to copy protection, they probably leave off something that PCs look for, which standard players don't. Just a heads up on this.",1391990400,,4520,4.451690821256038

I was not able to get the discs to work on my PC. My computer was only able to read a bit of bad code. Thankfully my regular DVD was able to get the discs to play....barely!

Lastly, there are NO interviews, bloopers, or extra info of any kind offered on this season. In short, Night Court season 4 is/was cheaply made and highly priced. ($35).

Enter Roz. Don't get me wrong, I loved Selma and loved Florence even more, but Roz was the final, essential ingredient for the perfect Night Court cast. There is a general consensus that season four begins the shows golden era. I'm inclined to agree. By this point all the kinks are worked out and the delivery spot-on. I can't say that there is a single episode in the whole season that I didn't like.

As many of you already know, the season four set is manufacture on demand and has seen it's share of audio and video problems. After the onslaught of negative feedback, I read that Warner listened and finally fixed all the issues, so I figured I'd take the chance. I'm very pleased to report that I didn't experience one single problem with this set, and I'm now eager to pick up season five. I sincerely hope that Warner will release the remainder of the show.
