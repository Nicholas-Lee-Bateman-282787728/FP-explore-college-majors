6184809,5,B00HNEQZ46,"Very well done and helpful. I like that they offer an ""adapted"" version of the exercises using a chair for balance and an ""advanced"" version giving a few ways to add difficulty. High quality video, narration is pleasant and encouraging. Excellent maintenance exercises for people with Parkinson's who have done the Big program. They need to exercise daily and keep their movements and walking big. Being a movement disorder, Parkinson's steals your ability to fully extend your range of motion and posture,so daily exercise is so beneficial. I enthusiastically recommend the LSVT Big program. Go to the website and find a local therapist. Stay up on your medication tweaking and exercise. Also, be aware that there are neurologists who are Movement Disorder Specialists who are more knowledgeable about PD. You have to be a fighter with this disease! Fight for your life!",1442707200,17,871,5.140845070422535

It always worked best if I were there to monitor him, but even if I were unavailable, just set it up for him, he'd do them, trying his best.  Highly recommended!",1519689600,3,284,4.222222222222222
