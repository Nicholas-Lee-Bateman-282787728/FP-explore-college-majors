7823119,5,6302241537,This is an excellent copy of the movie and was like watching it shortly after it was first released,1520467200,,99,4.2631578947368425
7823120,3,6302241537,Great old-school break-dancing flick..80s fashion and comedy..,1507766400,,62,8.0
7823121,5,6302241537,"A true underground gem of the 80s HIP HOP movies. It's basically an R rated comedy with breakdancing in it. While it doesn't hold up to the likes of BEAT STREET, WILD STYLE, & the classic documentary STYLE WARS, DELIVERY BOYS delivers in the quality of its breakin scenes!!! The DYNAMIC BREAKERS shine in this movie & it shows why they were one of the top b boy crews of their time. The plot is weird but if you're like me who, in the 70s & 80s til' present day, watch Kung Fu movies mainly for the action rather than the plot, then you'll be able to watch this with no problem!!! Another 80s gem! The DVD arrived in perfect condition & earlier than anticipated! Thank you!!!",1480723200,,675,4.322834645669292

7823123,4,6302241537,"I loved this 1984 comedy and could hardly wait when an announcement was made that it would be released on DVD last year (6/11/2007).  Unfortunately it wasn't and I can't find out exactly why!
I've made a DVD copy (for my own personal use, of course) from my original VHS tape but the quality is not the best.",1208217600,,308,4.310344827586207
7823124,4,6302241537,"I've been wanting this 1985 comedy ever since I recorded it off TV years ago. I had no idea it was good until I viewed it the next night. The only ""star"" then was Mario Van Peebles and he didn't really have that much of an important part.
The characters are great - the situations are even better. I loved the closing song ""Higher.""
DVD release is supposedly today (June 12) but no dealers seem to know anything about it. Is it an Amazon exclusive?",1181692800,,448,4.2823529411764705
7823125,5,6302241537,"Yes!!! A film with actual break dancing and not the usual popping. Even better, a quirkey plot that makes this movie so memorable that I sit here almost 20 years later still laughing, thinking about it. Seeing Mario Van Peebles as a pimp trying to sabotage a break dance tournament is something you won't want to miss.",1137542400,2,318,4.5964912280701755
7823126,5,6302241537,Weak and wacky plot can not overcome talented kids trying to get their Big Break in the Big City via their raw breakdancing skills. Great raw breakdancing. Well ahead of it's time.,1102809600,,180,4.65625
