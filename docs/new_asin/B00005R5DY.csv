This was one of those people-funded movies, where small-time investors got a chance to see how little money is made at the low-end of the movie business. November Man with Pierce Brosnan cost around $25m budget and pulled in around $50m worldwide revenue. Not a bad return on investment for a film that didn't get the credit it could have done in that case. Back to this one. The UK government were giving tax breaks at the time to get the man-in-the-street to invest. In return the producers let investors be extras in the film and come watch the filming.
One of the problems was that there was a rumor that UK comedy actor Rik Mayall was to take a starring role in the movie. That was quickly quashed after he had a serious quad bike accident in April 1998. So, there are a few UK TV stars and lesser-known names, but no serious money for production and distribution until late. I always liked Rita Tushingham, and she did a good job here. Dont expect a lot of fast-paced action. More in line with the British TV shows doing the rounds in the 90s.
The film didn't hit the spot with the movie-goers and the special investment company was wound up and investors got to claim their tax write-offs. Want to be a movie angel? Dont bother  just go and enjoy the movies! If you get a chance to see the movie because a friend has an old copy, fine. Notice Im light on spoilers! It does have some insights into the London small-time criminal world at the time. If not, there are plenty of other movies to watch that will be better than this one!",1485388800,,1656,4.32475884244373
