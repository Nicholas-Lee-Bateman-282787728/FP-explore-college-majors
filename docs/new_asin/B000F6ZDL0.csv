8472575,4,B000F6ZDL0,"Great documentary, but it's too bad History Channel rips you off with their print-DVDs-on-demand service. The DVD is dated, the original production really seems like its from the 90s.  The selection of documentaries this dvd is from is almost like a lost time period of History channel now where they no longer create high quality programming like this anymore. This kind of lesser known history should be more widely known among residents of the west coast in the USA. Highly recommended.",1382313600,,489,5.037037037037037
8472576,4,B000F6ZDL0,This was an interesting dvd. It's about a secret voyage or quest to the west coast of north america (now the usa) and the tantalizing evidence to which of a few possible places he landed. And there is a dash of biographical information on drake and a few instances of his piracy or you could call it privateering (haha). That's a very good and thorough summary of what's in the dvd. I love looking at the clues and trying to decide where he landed. It's about 40 minutes long I think.,1301788800,,484,4.329670329670329
