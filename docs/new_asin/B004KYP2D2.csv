8433581,4,B004KYP2D2,"I agree with the previous reviewer. It's difficult if not impossible to teach driving through just lecturing. I think it would have been helpful if the demonstrations had voiceover so you could tell exactly at what point you needed to be executing the maneuvers and when it was too late. That being said this video has a lot of useful information. The video was short. So, I'd love to see a follow up driving video from these guys teaching more techniques.  This is the stuff they need to be teaching in driver's ed. Why? because most driving courses don't teach you how to properly react to the stressful situations presented in this video. (which can occur on any highway and not just high risk scenarios) Most courses teach you: drive ""safely"" like an old lady and hope for the best. They ignore potential hazardous situations many drivers encounter everyday. This video explores those situations. It made me aware of a lot of things I do in reacting that can make the situation worse not better. Similarly, it made aware of the steps to try to take if I have to react with precision in a driving situation.

However, the viewer should know the video is by no means comprehensive. It's not a basic tactical driving course from the ground up. It's only about an hour long. The instructors present a series of drills and explain why you may need that technique, what to do, how most people with out training would react in that situation and the bad results it can lead to.

Overall, a great video and I recommend it.",1348185600,,1518,4.594095940959409
8433582,4,B004KYP2D2,"This video is limited by the fact that it is hard to teach driving techniques with lecture and illustrations.  However, considering this, the instructors do a very good job.  I appreciate the fact that the focus is on SUVs, rather than sedans. These vehicles are more difficult to handle, but are so ubiquitous in the security profession these days.  You don't have to be running from the bad guys to use this stuff.  Much of what is taught applies to staying out of bad situations no matter what your mission.  You will be better prepared to interact with your vehicle and monitor the road conditions, and react to problems withour crashing or flipping over.  It is relatively short, but packed with information on how to keep the shiny side up...",1330128000,,748,4.7153846153846155
