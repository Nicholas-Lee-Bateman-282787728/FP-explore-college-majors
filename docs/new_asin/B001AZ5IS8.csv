The first setting allows you to watch 40 pictures in about three minutes. You can set this to go slower if you like. The pictures are all pretty much static, no ""living"" earth scenes like moving waterfalls or clouds, etc. So this was not quite what I expected. The music is however good and you get three choices. The guitar music is nice. So basically this is for background ambience and not something you'd actively watch. If you want something spectacular I can recommend:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Delta-Sleep-System/dp/B000VKL0VC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Delta Sleep System</a>&nbsp;- This has moving scenes of nature that are completely beautiful and awe inspiring.

It's also a great diversion when the chatter slows off and on. Rated ""G"" of course. Highly recommended.",1387238400,3,248,4.533333333333333
