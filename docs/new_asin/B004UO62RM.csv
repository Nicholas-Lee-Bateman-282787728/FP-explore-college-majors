4469557,4,B004UO62RM,"""Westward Ho, the Wagons!"" a Walt Disney Production made in 1956, has
finally made it to DVD after many years of neglect.

Not a box-office success but more of a curiosity in its day.  I believe
that the story told was too simple and charming and did not reflect
the real hardships of the early pioneers.  It is quite obvious that the
movie was aimed at the youngsters like most Walt Disney movies at the
time.

This is an early cinemascope release but unfortunately the powers that be
have decided to release it on DVD in full screen (1.33:1) which greatly
reduces its entertainment value.  Why movie distributors persist in doing
this is beyond me.  I was under the impression that this was the era of
widescreen television and projection systems.  I guess however that a
little of something is better than a little of nothing and it has been
digitally remastered to give good picture quality and sound.  We are also
now getting the complete movie rather than the shortened and screwed up
versions shown on The Wonderful World of Disney.

The main characters are played by Fess Parker, Kathleen Crowley, Jeff York,
Sebastian Cabot and David Stollery and tells the story of the adventures
that befall a wagon train of settlers and their families heading west
along the treacherous Oregon Trail where they encounter hostile Pawnee
Indians before arriving at Fort Laramie where the friendly but suspicious
Sioux Indians are camped.  Despite some early misunderstandings, they earn
the respect of the Sioux when Fess Parker (the wagon train doctor) saves
the life of the chief's young son who becomes unconscious after a fall from
his horse.

The movie contains some good old fashioned pioneer songs such as:
The Ballad of John Colter
Wringle Wrangle
I'm Lonely My Darling
Pioneer's Prayer

Good family entertainment and suitable for the young ones.",1314921600,17,1847,4.903536977491961
4469558,1,B004UO62RM,Pan and scanned junk of a widescreen movie. Disney should be ashamed of releasing such an inferior product in today's marketplace. Do not buy unless you want to miss seeing almost 50 percent of the picture that is cut off on the sides.,1309996800,18,235,4.488372093023256

  this is a wonderful, fun, kid's western and a must for any fan of the classic Disney archives. if you are a fan of classic Disney and the original 50's MMC, then buy this right away and don't hesitate because it's been almost impossible to acquire in recent years.
  if you want to see a serious review of this movie check my review up above. well, somewhat serious. MEESKAS RULE!-james (the 'alice' fan. my brother hates cute kid's stuff).",1308182400,2,667,4.487603305785124
4469561,5,B004UO62RM,"wow. i've been trying to get a DVD copy of this FOREVER!!! finally someone made it available. i bought my copy from archa bunka the archie bunker. the delivery was super fast and was in great brand new shape. where bunkie found copies of this i don't know but God bless his little heart. wherever he may be. probably in some bunker somewhere.
  if you are a true fan of the Disney archives then i would definitely grab a copy of this HARD TO GET Disney classic. it probably won't be around long if the true fans find out about this.
  YES! the DVD is pan & scan full screen. not a good idea for a cinemascope film maybe, but the preservation quality and picture are OUTSTANDING. the image is crisp, clear and the color looks great.
  FORGET poseur Disney fans who care nothing for the archival films. you cannot be a true Disney buff and not acknowledge the archive films. posuer Disney fans will be CLUELESS about this but true buffs will not.
  if you are a true buff of the Disney archives legacy then get your greedy little mouse hands on a copy of this now! it looks just great.",1306627200,7,1083,4.326732673267327

4469568,3,B004UO62RM,"I'm fond of this little movie -- a sort of MICKEY MOUSE CLUB serial in color with Fess Parker (DAVY CROCKETT) and three of the original Mousketeers. It's no great shakes, but as with many Walt Disney films of its period, warmth and nostalgic charm supersede any other considerations.

Of course Disney should not be releasing their wide-screen archival films full-frame -- but they are, and likely will never change policy unless there is some unforeseen revolution, such as when SONG OF THE SOUTH sees a fully-restored U.S. Platinum Blu-Ray release with hours of extras. (Harrumph!)

The truly important thing is that the movie has at last been made available on DVD to those of us who love it.

As to WESTWARD HO! itself: I've long had a sneaking suspicion that this was originally intended for the Walt Disney TV show but went to theaters instead, as with so many Disney films of that era. It was unusual, but not unheard of, for films of the early CinemaScope era to be shot in two versions: wide-screen for theaters equipped for 'Scope and standard for general release. Walt Disney was renowned for looking ahead and I wouldn't be surprised if he took this route knowing that the film was in theaters to capitalize on the CROCKETT craze but would find a permanent home on his TV show.

No evidence, but it makes total sense to me, and I'd be willing to bet on it.

This is not the only Disney movie that is so expensive, why do they cost so much.  I have other Disney movies that I love on dvd and they didn't cost near at much, maybe anywhere from $8.99 to perhaps $14.00. I'd love to build up my Disney collection because they are movies I loved as a kid and can watch with my grandchildren with their being any smut in them.
