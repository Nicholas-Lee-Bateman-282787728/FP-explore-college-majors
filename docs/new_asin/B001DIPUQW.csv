8293534,1,B001DIPUQW,"Quality of sound track sucks!  sounds like it was re-recorded with no bass and very little mid range.  try an E.Q. to boost either, and i get total distortion. it's like listening to a pair of headphones from across the room.  so far i cant stand to watch (listen to) all of it. i had it on VHS AND LOVED IT!  played it for 10 years before it broke! but i think this be going back.
