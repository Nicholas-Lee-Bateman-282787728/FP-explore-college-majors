Worth a watch.",1298764800,2,194,4.0
3869122,1,B0027VT466,"This has got to be one of the worst, if not the worst, movies I've ever seen. Unfortunately, I can't even think of one good thing to say about this movie. Sorry!
I had to fast forward through parts just so that I could make it to the end. Reversal is a much better film if you want to see what wrestling is really like, or what it use to be like. Anyway, don't waste your time watching this thing.",1297641600,8,397,3.975

I certainly recomend it!",1271116800,2,120,4.714285714285714
3869124,5,B0027VT466,"I normally don't watch independent films but I'd heard several of my friends talk about this one, so I decided to check it out.

It's a very fresh take on the teen sports genre that doesn't fall into the usual traps or clichs. I hate movies where you know what's going to happen in advance - this isn't one of them.

The writing and acting were both excellent and the score was fantastic. I wasn't sure at first but I ended up really enjoying this movie (I have watched it 3 or 4 times now).",1247011200,2,491,4.157894736842105

3869126,5,B0027VT466,"This is an incredible indie film! It is not simply a sport flick or high school drama! High tension, psychological thrill, and comedic elements combine to create an entertaining and highly satisfying experience. So many provoking themes are explored; family ties, the superficiality of high school life, first sexual encounters, war torn families and absentee parents, drug use, college scholarships, and moral lines. Highly recommended for all!",1244505600,3,445,5.656716417910448
3869127,5,B0027VT466,"Amazing movie.
Great story.
Great acting.
I recommend this to people of all ages.
Gritty story of youth and the challenges that
young people face today.
Multi-award winning film.
Truly a remarkable find!!",1242691200,6,204,5.212121212121212
3869128,5,B0027VT466,"Dark and moving exploration of the role coaches play in our children's lives, and the effect adults can have on a young, unquestioning mind.

The acting is very strong - Lonelygirl15 (Jessica Rose) proves she's not a one-hit wonder and the other cast members are excellent too. However, real kudos goes to Anthony O'Brien who steals the show with his heartwarming and believable portrayal of Lee Bishop, the aspiring yet confused young man who is so concerned with aiming for the top that he completely forgets where his priorities should be.

The production values are excellent and rival those of movies with considerably larger budgets. However, I really have to single out the soundtrack here. The music is incredibly beautiful and really helps to ground the viewer emotionally within the film. I will definitely be purchasing the soundtrack.

One thing I will say is that the drama takes priority over the wrestling, so if you're looking for a typical Hollywood sports movie with big stars and lots of action, look elsewhere. But if you're looking for a movie that will make you laugh, cry and think, be sure to watch Perfect Sport - you won't regret it.",1242691200,7,1159,4.873096446700508

8355170,1,B0027VT466,"By far!!!!! the worst movie i have ever seen. How dare the producer portray wrestlers as cigarette smoking, alcohol drinking, steroid taking athletes when they are the complete opposite! This movie disgusted me. It is in a landfill right now where it belongs!!!!! I just wish i would have read the previews before i bought it. These kinds of movies are what corrupts our youth!!!!!!!!",1318464000,27,384,4.923076923076923
8355171,1,B0027VT466,"DO NOT BUY!!!

I've wrestled most of my life and have coached for the past 13 years... this movie is HORRIBLE for the sport of wrestling!  Want a good movie?  Checked out ""Pinned"", ""Veritas"", or ""Takedowns and Falls"", or ""The Streak"" (if you can find it) to name a few.

I honestly told my wife that I was going to throw the movie in the garbage after I survived watching it the first time.

The plot is DARK and DISTURBING.

Spoiler Alert (as if there is anything to spoil): Overall summary - A struggling team is in need of a coach with more wrestling experience.  A local alumni surfaces.  He was undefeated his HS career, became a military vet, and really mentally disturbed alcoholic (gives the military a bad rap).  He ends up working out extra with the best kid on the team.  He motivates this kid by holding a gun to his head!  SERIOUSLY!  It gets worse... the kid's freshman sister joins the team.  The nut-job coach ends up having sex with her and gets her pregnant!  WTF?!  The kid confronts the coach at the gym.  The coach gives the kid his gun - the kid attempts to shoot the guy but the gun was empty.  The coach apparently loads the gun and blows his own head off.  The End.

PLEASE DON""T BUY!",1315353600,25,1209,4.316964285714286
8355172,2,B0027VT466,I was highly disappointed in this movie.  I was looking for a story with a roll model and was extremely disappointed.  .,1313020800,3,120,4.409090909090909
8355173,2,B0027VT466,"The title of this review will depend strictly on your point of view.

I bought this movie as I had also purchased another wrestling movie the same day.  The acting was decent enough, and the plot was OK, but I honestly found myself wandering to other things during the course of the movie.  It wasn't a bad movie, but it didn't do well to hold my interest.  I had read the other ratings before purchasing, but figured if nothing else, it would be another wrestling movie in the collection.  Not a horrible movie, and the overall theme was dark, but I was looking for something that was more about striving to overcome the challenges of being a wrestler, more than wrestling being the background for a movie about teen strife.  The movie was worth watching, but after seeing the it once, I probably won't watch it again.",1307318400,,819,4.537414965986395
8355174,1,B0027VT466,"As a wrestler I must say this movie is a disgrace. The wrestling is atrocious, the acting is just plain bad. If this movie had decent actors that knew something about wrestling I would consider buying it again. GO BUY REVERSAL OR EVEN VISION QUEST. I hate that someone is making money off of this awful movie. Biggest waste of money ever.",1305417600,3,338,4.467741935483871
