Is there any way to fix this, re-program my DVD player so I can play this DVD?

7902397,1,B0000039CZ,"Once again I was fooled into thinking that this dvd would work on my machine ! We live in the United states, why do they offer you things that will only work in Canada or overseas ???  For the money, that's why !!!! So I still don't have a dvd of this movie !!! Any sugestions besides move to Canada to view one dvd ????",1357171200,5,320,3.923076923076923

7902399,4,B0000039CZ,"Perhaps a little ""sappy"", but who cares!  At least it's not bloodNguts--and who pays attention to the story when Lee Horsley's on the screen!  (I think he's one of those actors that was sorely over-looked.  Check out tapes on one of his series, Hawkeye!)

It's just a great scenery, nice story of horses & two people from different lifestyles.
Most relaxing.",1339891200,2,358,4.819672131147541
