1191300,5,B0000065MX,"I generally don't like westerns, but I loved this movie.  I saw it on TV first and I have been looking for this movie ever since and found it was out of print until Amazon did this special printing. Thank you Amazon.  It is a wonderful movie with great characters and a great story.  For someone who doesn't particularly like westerns, the story, itself, draws you in. It is based on a true story.  I would recommend this movie.  A classic worth enjoying over and over again.",1270684800,9,475,4.413793103448276
1191301,5,B0000065MX,"Kudos to MGM for the transfer.  This was very well done.  The movie runs semi-slow, but, after it's over, you realize it was a worthwhile journey rather than a pure shoot 'em up, fast-paced western.  It's a real good character study, and each of the characters acts with professionalism and offers an interesting depth.  Nobody is a hero.  Redford, Blake, Susan Clark and several character actors are each very finely tuned for their parts.  Katherine Ross was exceptional as well, but, her skin color makeup was probably the biggest flaw in the entire movie.  Let's get some more westerns out there now MGM, you've certainly earned my repeat biz.",1266278400,9,647,4.8807339449541285
1191302,5,B0000065MX,"Universal's burn-on-demand DVD of TELL THEM WILLIE BOY IS HERE (released in cinemas December 1969) is a clean, sharp transfer, superior in quality to the laser disc, with excellent color balance and saturation, and bright punchy sound. The opening titles are windowboxed, but the film unfolds widescreen and anamorphic. The film is written and directed with diamond-hard brilliance by Abraham Polonsky, the auteur who was blacklisted after making the film noir classic FORCE OF EVIL twenty-two years earlier. He must have had a lot to say in those lost years when he was denied work, because he packs it all in here. Tragically this was only his second film, but the same preoccupation with injustice -- one might say the same force of evil -- is still at work, with a vengeance.

This is a confrontational western. Polonsky is fearless in raising controversy and provoking audience reaction. Willie Boy and Lola want to be together, but the Superintendent of the Morongo Indian Reservation objects, and her family refuses at the point of a gun. Forced to kill in self-defense, Willie Boy and Lola run off with the law on their heels. This premise enables Polonsky to depict the transitional west of 1909 as a place where prejudice and discrimination are everywhere and in everyone, between the races, within the races, among the sexes, and especially in the well-intentioned. No character is all evil. The most racist Anglo and the most racist Indian has a decent side even as they compound hypocrisy upon hypocrisy like a desert variation of INHERIT THE WIND. Hypocrisy manifests in ways that are obvious and subtle -- note Susan Clark's self-loathing social worker who thinks she has the right to protect ""my Indians"" from themselves. Every order she gives to control the situation only serves to escalate the violence out of control. A young Robert Blake portrays Willie Boy with physical agility and a deeply felt sense of futility. We feel his despair. Understandably he hates white people, but surprisingly he refrains from killing them each time the opportunity arises. Blake's performance is one of the most under-rated in the history of movies. Sheriff Coop is the only character aware of his own hypocrisy, but don't look for him to save the day. As played by Robert Redford, the sheriff is not a noble Will Kane or Matt Dillon type, but he is not corrupt either. Sheriff Coop doesn't want to become a manhunter like his famous father before him, although everyone assumes he is and expects him to be. In the end, he is unable to avoid it. Manhunting comes naturally to him, and he finds himself. Redford's ambivalence may not be merely acting. All these characters are the sons and daughters of an earlier generation of pioneers who fought Indians and sacrificed for their children. In case they forget, oldtimer Barry Sullivan is around to remind them. He brags about the violent past while lamenting its passing in the same breath. All the actors are fearless in playing up the contradictions of their richly complex characters.

A hunter throws himself down to the ground to drink from a stream, his hand slipping into the handprint of his prey who had been there and done the same. Later, the Sheriff cleans blood off his hands by rubbing them in the soil. The camera pushes in on a funeral pyre as scavengers try to pull the body out for souvenirs. Rich in visual metaphor, TELL THEM WILLIE BOY IS HERE is that rarity among Hollywood studio westerns -- it is historically intelligent and historically well-informed, faithful to the actual circumstances and events it depicts. Perhaps the best testament to its authenticity is the fact that several tribes cooperated in making the film; they are identified during the opening titles. The film is based on the biography of Willie Boy written by Harry Lawton, which Polonsky obviously read and understood. He doesn't try to schmaltz it up or tack on a happy ending. The only other western that compares to it, that I can think of, is the independently made THE BALLAD OF GREGORIO CORTEZ (1983). But you don't need to know the history to enjoy the high-calibre drama and suspenseful action on display. Structured on the chase formula, TELL THEM WILLIE BOY IS HERE is a manhunt thriller without peer. Expect a standard of craftsmanship in story telling and in technical execution that you just don't see anymore.

TELL THEM WILLIE BOY IS HERE is one of the best-photographed westerns you'll ever see. The burnished landscape and stoic portraiture is by photographer Conrad Hall, who carved out a signature style on THE PROFESSIONALS(1966), HELL IN THE PACIFIC (1967), and BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID (1969). Shooting desert landscapes in morning light and at the golden hour Hall manipulated exposure to tone down the intensity of dye-transfer Technicolor to an earthy, realistic pallet. Those films deserved all the accolades they received, but his work here on the high deserts of inland California surpasses prior achievements, and that's saying a lot.

Studio and network execs winnow out this level of sophistication today. They stop it before it starts. TELL THEM WILLIE BOY IS HERE could only have been made in the 1960s. I consider it one of the great cinematic achievements of that decade and one of the all-time great westerns. Perhaps this remarkable western will become better known and appreciated, and more widely discussed, now that it is finally available on DVD.

1191304,5,B0000065MX,"1969's  TELL THEM WILLIE BOY IS HERE is a forgotten but great film. Robert Blake is excellent as the Paiute Indian, Willie Boy, who is the object of a manhunt for a killing he committed in self-defense. The press gets hold of the story and turns it around into an Indian upraising circa 1909. President Taft is the object of the uprising on his trip out west according to the press. Robert Redford, the sheriff leading a posse knows better as he attempts to bring in Blake alive. It is a great study on misinformation by the press and racism. The direction by Abraham Polonsky methodically unfolds this simple yet powerful tale and remains captivating throughout. Conrad Hall's starkly beautiful cinematography enhances the solemn energy of this parable-like tale. Robert Redford, Robert Blake and Katharine Ross all give sincere performances. There is a strange enigmatic quality between the relationships of Blake and Ross and Blake and Redford. There is the hunter and the hunted contrasted against the loss of personal freedoms for a way of life and the loss of the very landscape unto which the story unfolds. Both Redford and Blake remain stoic characters but each manages to give a glimpse of humanity as they exude an aura of their true feelings for a way of life forever lost. They must either accept or perish in that change in one last noble gesture.",1046908800,17,1361,4.816239316239316
1191305,3,B0000065MX,"While I find this to be a decent yet minor film in the Redford cannon, my real problem is that the distributor (Good Times Video) is using a picture of Redford from ""Out of Africa"" on the box cover instead of a photo from ""Willie Boy""... Hopefully when the DVD is released they will fix this embarassing oversight.",1016064000,4,314,4.431034482758621

Redford manages to pull off a convincing macho performance.",997488000,3,521,4.673913043478261
1191372,5,B0000065MX,"After all these years, I finally purchased this DVD, and it was worth the weight. Redford, as usual, turns in an excellent performance, and Robert Blake, as Willie Boy, is ideal for the role. Katherine Ross is also in this movie, and I believe this movie came out a year after ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,"" or else it was the year before. In any event, the narrative is compelling, the acting is great, and so is the directing and the scenery. This is must-have movie in one's Western genre collection.",1461110400,2,510,4.554347826086956

1191378,4,B0000065MX,"A better-than-average Western with two dynamic performances from the two leads: Robert Redford and Robert Blake. I can't say why this isn't a better-known Redford film because he does a very good job as the morally-shaded Sheriff on a manhunt for Willie Boy, played by Blake. This is a movie about racial prejudice, media frenzy and ultimately, the roles we give ourselves and play in society itself. There are some very interesting and subtle observations about sex and gender roles, as well. Excellent script, direction, editing combined with beautiful photography from the great Conrad Hall make this a fascinating and interesting watch.",1422489600,,640,5.284313725490196

It's right up there with Brubaker in social commentary drama and was ahead of it's time in Redford was not necessarily the only lead actor but was made up of a great cast sharing the limelight with him like Robert Blake, Robert Vaughn, Catherine Ross, and Susan Clark. Originally released in 69 it was re-released around 77 as Willie Boy with a string of Redford films released in the 70's and at the time of Robert Blake's TV detective show Baretta. Would love to see a follow up/remake of this someday, because there is a popular story by the Paiute that Willie actually didn't die with the manhunt but survived to be an elderly fellow!?",1417046400,,684,4.614754098360656
1191381,5,B0000065MX,A well done movie based on a true story of a half-breed American Indian (Robert Blake) and his attempts to flee from the law (Robert Redford) with the woman he loves (Katherine Ross).  I saw this in the theatre when it was released and the book of the same story was once assigned to me in an English class in high school.  I purchased this on VHS simply because of the cheap price.  Good entertainment for two bucks.  It is available on DVD but I thought the price was a little high.  A great cast and story dealing with a clash of cultures in the American West.,1412294400,,563,4.224299065420561
1191400,3,B0000065MX,"Well done western with a superb cast.  If featured two of hottest young talents in Hollywood of that period, Robert Redford and Robert Blake.  Redford is the sheriff who has to bring Willie Boy (Blake) in on a murder charge after he kills the father of his love interest Katherine Ross.
Redford has his own love problems with his love Susan Clark.  Set in early 1900's the film has great cinematography.  No surprises in the ending.",1407715200,,432,4.644736842105263

This DVD has been hard to find and I was glad it finally became available at an affordable price.  Although there are no menus or special features, the quality of the image and the audio is excellent.  I loved the film when it was first released, and read the book as well.  Of course certain events were changed in the movie because it is Hollywood after all, but the gist of the drama remained the same.  It was Robert Blake at one of his best performances, and Robert Redford was outstanding, as was Katherine Ross.  I was really impressed with Susan Clark as the physician on the reservation.  She is definitely an underrated actress.  I would recommend this film to anyone that enjoys historical drama, wants to know about the lives of Native American Indians in the U.S. at the time (early 1900s), and just plain good movie-making.  It keeps your interest throughout, well-paced and all the threads are connected.  A perfect cinematic experience!  Y Attar.",1390262400,,1044,4.776536312849162

Why is this not a Blu-ray transfer with commentary from the three principal actors who are very much alive and articulate -- yes, including Robert Blake.  Please Universal.  Do the right thing.  Writer/Director Abraham Lincoln Polonsky has something to say in this mostly true account of a tragic series of events that still resonate in the region.  The film was photographed in Whitewater (near Palm Springs) close to the actual place where Willie Boy lived out his last days.  Blake is superb.",1350950400,2,566,5.032258064516129
1191406,5,B0000065MX,"Honestly, I could watch this movie over and over and, actually, that's exactly what I've done from it's first appearance at a tiny little neighborhood theatre in western San Francisco to its current run on cable TV.  I can't get enough.

""Willie Boy"" is a tightly crafted little gem revolving around an event which normally would never have raised an eyebrow.  In accordance with Paiute Indian tradition, Willie Boy takes a willing bride by capture, inadvertently killing his antagonistic father-in-law in the process.  This murder would be considered tribal business were it not for an impending Presidential visit to the territory, a news-hungry reporter with a bent to sensationalism, an iron-willed female Indian Agent with an aculturating agenda for the fugitive bride, a band of nostalgic and aging Indian killers, and a conscientious sheriff caught in the middle.

The movie has a lot to say about changing and not-so-changing roles and attitudes in the culture of 1909.  It has an ending I didn't anticipate, and both the sheriff and the Indian Agent experience an awakening of awareness.

Beautifully photographed and wonderfully paced, this is a true western classic.  It's punctuated by a totally unique soundtrack composed by Dave Grusin that I have been trying to locate ever since I heard it.  Haunting, relentless, and mystical -- I'm at a loss to explain it's unavailability.

Worth viewing; worth owning.  And when the soundtrack is released (at last) I'll own that, too.",1347148800,4,1488,5.158333333333333

Robert Redford stars in a film based on historical facts, sharing billing with a young and virile Robert Blake who portrays the character of the title. It is the story of a manhunt in the American West. The time is the very beginning of the 20th century, when the culture of the United States starts to evolve toward tolerance and equality of all its citizens, and, like any birth, it is bloody and painful. The old ways have a death grip, and they won't go down without a vicious fight. Willie Boy (Blake) is a young Pauite who returns to his place of birth to claim his bride (Katharine Ross). Her family resents him, so he uses the custome of bridal capture--he kills her father and brothers and the two run away to join his relatives in another village. Redford plays the sherrif who tracks him down. The sheriff is a hard-living man, in the mold of sheriffs of the privious century. He serves out justice with his fists--and his gun if he has to. There is a woman with a PhD. in anthropology(Susan Clark) living among the Pauites. Her goal is to bring them education so they may  get off the reservation. She is beautiful. The sheriff uses her sexually. She finds she cannot refuse him, as she is as sexually hungry as he is. She is angry with him, because she cannot stop his use of her, and she is angry with herself for using such a crude man to fulfill her own needs. The sheriff forms a posse to catch Willie Boy, but early into the chase, decides to let the boy get away and returns to town, telling his posse to return in the morning. The posse acts on its own, and they are systematically and cleverly slaughtered by the young Pauite. The survivors can't believe this is the work of one lone native and word gets back to town that this is an Indian revolt. The sheriff is forced to accept the responsibility of hunting down the young lovers. What follows is an intense manhunt, where old and new ways clash as the sheriff seeks a  just ending. This is a unique role for Robert Redford, as he protrays a character with more negative than positive qualities. It is one of his earlier films, made when he was beginning to get noticed as a leading man of talent, and before any of the films that made him big box office began to limit his choices of roles. His character is brutal and selfish, and still believes in the old codes of justice. New ways of thinking are forced upon him, and in the end he finds he must bow to them to get the job done. This is a strong, realistic film, with fine acting by all involved. If you enjoy the tough, violent westerns of the late 1960's and early 1970's, you will find this movie compelling.",1298073600,2,2813,4.601593625498008

7903727,5,B0000065MX,"Loved this movie, although I feel that Katharine Ross was miscast, not because of a lack of acting ability (she's actually quite good in this movie) but because her ""native American"" makeup was just too distracting. Robert Blake shines as the title's namesake, on the run for having killed the father of his one true love, Lola, played by the aforementioned Ross. Robert Redford's Deputy Sheriff Cooper chases Willie Boy & Lola across an early 1900's Southern California in an attempt to bring him to justice and return her to the reservation. The cinematography in this film is breathtaking in its barren ruggedness and reminds one of a classic John Ford western. This movie is a gem, well worth checking out.
