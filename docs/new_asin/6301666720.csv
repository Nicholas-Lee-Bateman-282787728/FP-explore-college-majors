341998,2,6301666720,"A very poor attempt at recreating Peter Gunn.  They tried to recreate Edie and Mother, but their ""Edie"" and ""Mother"" just didn't compare to Lola Albright and Hope Emerson.  The ""Edie"" in this movie looked like a street hooker with a nasty disposition.  Where did they get the idea for her hair?  Instead of the beautiful, sweet, and patient person the real Edie was, we get a jealous, nasty shrew, at times.  Peter Strauss is no Craig Stevens.  For one thing he must be at least 4 inches shorter, and he is nowhere near as good looking.  And, where did they get this ""ladies man"" idea. That wasn't Peter Gun.  And the office and secretary--right out of Mike Hammer.  Maggie was the star of the show.  What a fine actress.  I got a kick out of calling ""Jacoby"" ""Herschel"" as the real star of Jacoby was Herschel Bernardi who was a great fit for the part.

I can see where people who weren't fans of the real Peter Gunn when it was popular might enjoy the movie because they know no difference, but I could almost not wait until it was over because I wanted to get out my DVDs of the real series and try to forget how these people ruined Peter Gunn.  Why didn't they just make it some other detective if they wanted to make a movie?",1395964800,3,1230,4.2956521739130435
341999,5,6301666720,"I bought this because of the Henry Mancini music (from the 50s-60s TV show) and was not disappointed.  The plot is entertaining altho it belies its age - without special effects and new technology.  I think this is a made-for-TV movie, but I enjoy it thoroughly.",1394150400,4,262,4.673913043478261
342000,5,6301666720,Thank you Amazon. We loved the Movie when it was on TV and was hoping we could get it so we can see it again and again. We always loved Pearl Baily and Peter Strauss. Wish another Peter Gun would come out with Peter Strauss.,1388620800,4,224,4.0
342001,5,6301666720,"Before the King of Cool there was Peter Gunn. Private Investigator with a blonde girl friend torch singer who had a permanent gig at Mothers. Tough in a calm, cool way he solved crimes,listend to jazz and His girlfriend's great voice. These two episodes are typical of the series and, of course, feature cool,smooth jazz by Henry Mancini.",1300406400,,338,4.844827586206897
7813633,2,6301666720,"I just watched this Peter Gunn movie after watching approximately 70 episodes of the 114 episode TV show that began in 1958. I was 11 at the time and never saw an episode until 60 years later and have found them enjoyable. But after watching so much of the old series, (which I will be resuming) found the Peter Strauss version of Peter Gunn disappointing for several reasons.

First, it didn't have it. Craig Stevens came across as really being Peter Gunn; Peter Strauss came across as if he was acting the part. And some of his cutesy pretentiousness that might have worked in Rich Man, Poor Man, seemed out of place, here. Craig Stevens' Gunn was also not a smart ass.

In the TV series, Edie was cute and her jealousy childish. Here, not only was she unattractive, her jealousy was ugly.

In the series, Gunn had neither an office (he worked out of Mother's and met most of his clients there) nor a secretary (Mother and the bartender took his calls). There was never any indication that he had served on a police force (that was Harry O), and just about every episode took place at night in a waterfront city.

Pushing this version up a few years and playing rock songs also took away from the jazz flavor  the original carried. And including Pearl Baily as a black Mother to satisfy political correctness (which didn't exist at the time) was jumping the shark.

Finally, there were many really dumb lines. I think the series writers crafted better dialogue and the directors a better show. All in all, I don't know what Blake Edwards was thinking of when he put this out, other than making a few bucks.",1520726400,,1608,4.527586206896552
7813634,5,6301666720,"The 1989 Peter Gunn TV movie holds up well nearly three decades after it aired. Gunn, as played by Peter Strauss, is somewhat different than was played by Craig Stevens in the late 50s TV series. He's still cool, but it's a humorous cool. He's still a jazz head, still involved with Edie Hart, and still deals with Lieutenant Jacoby, but he now has an office and a secretary. While Edie is his girlfriend, the chemistry between Gunn and Maggie, his ""temporary"" secretary played by Jennifer Edwards, is much warmer. I don't know why Amazon doesn't have this in their Prime video library. The original series is there. This should be with it.",1518912000,,640,4.672566371681416
7813635,5,6301666720,I saw this decades ago and was happy to find on DVD.  It's not streamed anywhere as far as I know.  The only downside is you will want the series that was never made!!  That's a tragedy.  Get this - it's a treat.  Peter Strauss is just so good - far better than other actors in the role in my opinion.,1506816000,3,301,3.8688524590163933
7813636,5,6301666720,"Excellent print, been searching for years! The network made a BIG mistake in not turning this into a series.",1499385600,2,108,4.7368421052631575
7813637,5,6301666720,"An up-dated version of Blake Edward's Private-Eye series, with humor thrown-in.  I was a stranger to the PETER GUNN series when I first saw this TV-Movie, and thought ( considering Blake Edwards was the creator ) that humor was the gimmick of the series.  I was mistaken here, but that did not deter me from loving both the actual series ( which I purchased from AMAZON ), and this TV-reunion.  BTW, look for the creator's daughter, Jennifer Edwards, in a very well-played role, as Pete's much put-upon secretary.",1465344000,4,513,4.806818181818182

7813639,5,6301666720,"I REALLY ENJOYED THIS REMAKE OF PETER GUNN. I GREW WITH THIS ACTION SHOW WRITTEN BY MR. BLAKE EDWARDS, AND WAS NEVER DISAPPOINTED IN ANY OF THE ORIGINAL STORIES OR WONDERFUL MUSIC OF MR. HENRY MANCINI. THIS ONE IS WELL IS WORTH THE WATCHING.  I KNOW THE ACTOR WHO PLAYS LT. JACOBY, AND HE DOES AND EXCELLENT JOB FILLING THE SHOES OF THE LATE HERSCHAL BERNARDI .  SO I SAY ENJOY, AND MAYBE WE WILL BE LUCKY ENOUGH TO SEE ANOTHER PETER GUNN MOVIE OR SERIES.",1436918400,3,455,4.27906976744186
