8034257,5,B0002XL1P8,"A decade after the Cuban Revolution former Newfoundland Premier, Joey Smallwood,  Millionaire Canadian broadcaster Geoff Stirling and a film crew travel to Cuba upon an invitation from Fidel Castro. They are set up in the mansion of a former American Tycoon in order to wait for an audience with the Cuban leader. They are ushered to different government run institutions such as a high school, psychiatric hospital, and a construction site of future housing projects. These trips spur on debate between the self-proclaimed socialist Smallwood and Stirling a believer in the free market. At the high school where students are expected to keep high marks in addition to assembling radios and stitching baseballs for fifteen hours a week in order to maintain free room, board, and tuition. Smallwood advocates self-sufficiency, community focus, and the learning of work-ethic while Stirling is appalled and claims that the beauty of Capitalist society is that adults are free to work so that their children have the freedom to have childhoods. The most interesting conversations take place around the dinner table as they discuss serious socio-political issues without losing their sense of humour. The men never get an interview although Fidel is spotted in the last few minutes of the film. Perhaps the most powerful scenes are of Smallwood preparing his questions for the Prime Minister that will...we learn... never be answered. Fantastic and entertaining documentary, especially for those with an interest in Cuba's past and present!",1317859200,,1536,5.347107438016529
8034258,5,B0002XL1P8,"This is, essentially, a one-hour debate between free marketer Geoff Sterling and socialist Joey Smallwood, both of whom are good friends engaging in lively conversations about Cuba, Fidel, and which form of economic organisation is best for mankind.
It's now 36 years later and as of this writing Sterling is still alive and Joey is long gone.  But Sterling was proven 100% correct: Cuba and its socialist paradise doesn't work, never did, and never will.
What I find fascinating about Sterling is that he is a new-age capitalist; he's into yoga, meditation, and manner of alternative religion.  You don't often see those two characteristics together in one person.  Sure, he may have some wacky ideas about sunken cities in South America (as he claims in the Extras) but his observations about human nature, free markets, and Cuba were right on.",1271980800,2,846,5.0285714285714285
8034259,5,B0002XL1P8,"Am thinking it's usually good to title a review with the favorite line from the movie, which I've done.

Geoff Stirling (multi-millionaire) asks this of staff at the Cuban psychiatric facility. He also uses the aforementioned ""Jonathan Livingston Seagull"" reference while arguing for more individual initiative and self-realization than he perceives as existing in Cuba (which is funny because an outlandish allegory such as ""Seagull"" has little relation to the lives of homo-sapiens, as we are not able to physically transmorgify ourselves or visit paralell existences by sheer force of will).

In other words, Stirling is a 70s-era hippie-Libertarian-capitalist, and therefore is very entertaining to hear, but who also is slightly full of it (in the DVD-extras interview, Stirling claims there to be ""submerged temples larger than St. Peter's"" in a lake near Titicaca, although it's not Titicaca- not sure where this lake is).

I bet Stirling consults his horoscope before making stock trades.

Anyway, this is also a very interesting glimpse of '70s-era Cuba, well before all the concessions had to be made during the Special Period. The tour is guided, to be sure: the visitors are shown the best of Cuban society. But what they do see seems to be working well (the psychiatric facility evidences a degree of humanity that many right-wingers would naturally assume does not exist under Castro).

A great but too brief (less than an hour's running time) documentary.",1174089600,2,1470,5.238297872340426
8034260,5,B0002XL1P8,"A producer, a millionaire, and a former premier of Newfoundland travel to Cuba on the hope of interviewing Castro.  For a variety of reasons, the interview is delayed.  In the meantime, some Cuban officials take them on a tour of the island to witness various accomplishments of the revolution.  They inspect a boarding school, a psychiatric facility for the chronically ill, a university, a housing construction site, and the beach at the Bay of Pigs.  They meet various Cubans during the journey, and their journeys become the springboard for a variety of interesting political and economic debates.

The three personalities often clash on ideological grounds.  The former premier is a socialist and the millionaire a capitalist.  Yet, interestingly, the biggest clashes occur between the millionaire and the producer whose view of the revolution seems uncommitted but open.  They clash mostly on the likely value of the film if, as it seems, Castro never appears to be interviewed.  The millionaire believes the film will be worthless because the likely consequence of Fidel not showing is the film will not recover its costs.  The producer cares less about the film's monetary success and more about its aesthetic and informational value.  Clearly, these ""practical"" concerns betray and highlight their ideological commitments.  Yet, ironically, it's precisely the anxious tensions and conflicts generated by waiting for Fidel that provide the film with its dramatic appeal.

Without a doubt, this is one of the best documentaries I have seen.  It's apparent why Michael Moore would find this film seminal for his own work.  I highly recommend readers purchase it.",1109721600,7,1668,5.2889733840304185
