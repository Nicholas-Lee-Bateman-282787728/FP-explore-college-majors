2528520,5,B000EQ5UUK,"This DVD was better than I could have asked for. It uses footage from the tv show This Week In Baseball [TWIB], and real baseball games over the past few years to cover the silly side of America's Pastime. It goes behind the scenes with a bunch of players including Tim Hudson, Ryan Dempster, select Phillies players, & many others, as well as looking at past characters who stand out in the game such as Tommy Lasorda and Yogi Berra. If you love TWIB's ""How 'Bout That"" section of the show, you will adore this DVD.

As far as I can tell, every major league team is shown, though some have the spotlight on them more than others. This is a must have for any baseball fan. It's by far one of the best MLB DVDs released in a long time.",1154217600,12,734,4.205673758865248

8112999,5,B000EQ5UUK,A good video if you want to relax with the family and friends. It is funny and you have a lot of time to watch sport bloopers.,1430092800,,126,3.7037037037037037
8113000,3,B000EQ5UUK,"It was okay, but nothing special for a seasoned baseball fan who knows MLB history, These were more about jokes between players than bloopers from game action. This was part of my husband's birthday gift; glad I had some other things that were nice to make up for the DVD. This would be appropriate as a gag gift.",1386201600,,313,4.413793103448276
8113001,1,B000EQ5UUK,"Not funny; not recommended. Rather than actual bloopers, the vast majority of this video is baseball players clowning around. Unfortunately, this is like watching a bunch of wanna-be stand-up comics doing stand-up. Occasionally, one will be actually funny, but most, though they surely wanna be, aren't.",1279843200,,303,5.608695652173913
8113002,3,B000EQ5UUK,I bought this movie for my 2yr old. Thats all he will watch or talk about he is not yet old enough to understand it but he does sit through it off and on. But i enjoyed it i just wish that it was more funnier than what they made it out to be. Other than that it was good,1252713600,,270,3.5166666666666666
8113003,3,B000EQ5UUK,"This video was a gift for my 13 year old grandson, a passionate baseball afficianado! He thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to others",1249862400,,143,4.76
8113004,1,B000EQ5UUK,"Don't waste your money on this terrible DVD. The title is deceiving; there are almost no bloopers in it. Instead the DVD is filled with boring interviews and staged pranks that put my baseball loving 11-year-old son to sleep within 20 minutes.

I gave it one star because there is no choice for zero stars.

Spend your money on something else.",1179360000,20,343,4.60655737704918
8113005,3,B000EQ5UUK,"This was somewhat funny, but I wouldn't call it great.  My 10-year-old liked it a lot.  I thought it dragged quite a bit, not very fast-paced.  Too many repeats of the same theme.  Would have liked to have seen a lot more on-field bloopers & funny plays.",1168473600,10,254,4.340425531914893
8113006,1,B000EQ5UUK,"I am a very disappointed baseball fan.
I waited a few months for this video to be released. When it arrived to my office, I went home immediately to watch it... I ended up seeing the video on fast play, just to tell I saw it all... it only made me smile (not laugh) once.
It's not fair that I can not place a no-star rating for this...
Do something better with your money and buy a pizza... believe me.",1157587200,15,402,4.0375
