7154633,4,B00WV7TN80,"Helicopters, rockets, bullets, bombs, fighting bad guys, overcoming personal challenges/shortcomings, pretty woman ; what more could a guy ask for in a movie.  Cage and Jones are great as always.  The plot is not new but still enjoyable.  I have seen it several times but I thought I'd like to own it just to have.",1438732800,,314,4.672727272727273
7154634,5,B00WV7TN80,"This single disc action movie on Blu-Ray, arrived on time and intact, with no damage to either the disc or the case, which the disc came in. Picture, sound and features playback is superb. A great all round action movie featuring Nicolas Cage, Tommy Lee Jones and Sean Young, battling it out with the Cali Drug Cartel, using the Apache 64 Longbow Helicopter, with a stritting soundtrack and great areial combat action, makes this movie just as good as when we were all watching Top Gun, starring Tom Cruise, Val Kilmer and Kelly Macgillis back in 1986. I would highly recommend this particular Blu-ray movie, to anyone who purchases it online from amazon.com.",1438214400,,659,4.84070796460177

7154637,4,B00WV7TN80,"Screen Legends - 'Tommy Lee Jones' as 'Brad Little' and 'Nicolas Cage' as 'Jake Preston' team up for this enjoyable 1990
movie.
In South America the drug Cartels rule the roost they have the back-up of hi-tech weaponry and a hired killer that controls
the sky's flying a high-speed and well armed 'Scorpion-Attack Craft' - 'Eric Stoller' (Bert Rhine) a deadly adversary.
An experience 'Jake' has seen first hand when piloting a troop-carrying Chopper, when two fellow pilots and their crew and
combat soldiers are shot out of the sky by 'Stoller'
This in effect has put the U.S army on a War-Footing, 'Jake' volunteers to join the 'Apache' team being made ready by 'Brad'
who is still considered the best
Other than a focus-issue which nearly scuppers his chances of joining the team, 'Jake' takes to flying the combat craft with
flying colours.
Of course romance is in the air 'Jake' has an eye for fellow chopper-pilot 'Billie' (Sean Young) though she rejects his early
overtures.....one just knows she'll succumb to his charms sooner rather than later.
Top-line pilot and trainer 'Brad' asks to be part of the offence against the Cartels, but is told he's too valuable in the role of
trainer......
Information is acquired by the Military suggests there is a 24-hour window when all the Cartel bosses will gather, the team
are ready to go knowing they will encounter stiff opposition which will of course include the deadly 'Stoller' flying the very
versatile 'Scorpion'
Enjoyable movie with sequences of high-flying action in which 'Nicolas Cage' does what the young star done best and 'Tommy
Lee'.......well, he's always a player worth watching on-screen.
Good Upgrade.......",1437350400,,1679,5.043165467625899
7154638,5,B00WV7TN80,I applaud this movie for its accurate depiction of what it takes to be an Army helicopter pilot!  The acting is top shelf and the action is second to none.  Most definitely Army Aviation's response to Top Gun and what a response it was!,1437004800,,236,4.340909090909091

7154640,3,B00WV7TN80,"This move could have been much more than it was, Yes the acting was quite terrible, some of the cool lines could have been delivered so much better, yes the Flying sequences were great, the atmosphere of the movie was great and the casting was great, The story was so-so, Quite typical for the time. The movie was just directed and delivered all wrong, but regardless of the reviews I will agree with all of them, ""Worst movie ever"" oh sure I will agree, ""great movie"" sure. But how many train wrecks have we all seen and loved that were too horrible to stand. over all Fire Birds delivered a meager story with mediocre humor set in a somewhat realistic setting, I gave it three stars basically for the flying sequences, Phil Collins music throughout the film and Tommy Lee Jones, He was just in it and that was cool.",1436572800,2,817,4.453333333333333
7154641,1,B00WV7TN80,"Worst movie ever - even worse than Plan 9 From Outer Space (and that movie was a joke on so many levels).  Why is this worse?  Well, it is worse, because they seemed to be under the misconception that they were actually making a good movie (well know actors etc, so how bad could it be?).  The script was apparently written either on the fly by the crew... or by a 13 year old.  The concept was to obviously rip off Top Gun, but make it about helicopters instead of jets...  Oh, and Nicolas (Coppola) Cage demonstrates just how gloriously bad an actor he can be.  He is only as good an actor as the director can make him (and he usually gets a boost by being typecast as a Nick Cage kind of character).  His ""acting"" career never would have gotten beyond high school drama without his Coppola family connections.  He is my obvious/quick answer for worst successful actor ever.

However, if you're planning an upcoming bad movie night, this is an excellent choice.",1431043200,3,963,4.457142857142857
7154662,1,B00WV7TN80,"I love movies. I say that so you will understand that for me to turn off a movie before it's over is extremely rare.  This movie was that bad.  Sorry I bought it and the fact that it was very highly rated makes me wonder what's going.

Just to be clear let me explain:

1) The ""enemy"" in the movie uses a fictional helicopter called a Scorpion. Yes, before you look it up, it's not a real helicopter.

2) Nicolas Cage destroys an enemy jet using his AH-64 Apache.  Not with a stinger missile, which is plausible but with Hydra 70 unguided rockets which is next to impossible.

3) Cage, and pretty much everyone else in the movie, despite being in the military are allowed to flirt, joke, use slang and fool around while flying on actual military missions.

4) The 3 main characters are totally predictable and cliche: a) Cage starts out as a totally cocky pilot who can't pass a test to fly the Apache until his ex-GF reveals to him that his ""mixed dominance"" (left eye- right handedness) is the entire problem.  Voila!.  Tommy Lee Jones makes him drive a jeep for 10 minutes with his left eye blindfolded and problem fixed.  b) Tommy Lee Jones is an older pilot who insists on using good old boy cliches at every opportunity to explain the US military doctrine, but still keeps the cocky and incompetent but ""potentially great"" Cage around. c) Sean Young is the ex-GF who is a helicopter pilot who refuses to ever get back together with Cage...for about a  week.  Gosh---the hero gets the girl and the copter which of course we never expected!!

5) Cage---who has never flown an Apache is sent to talk to the Joint Chiefs of Staff for a debriefing. and of course, his ""pluckyness"" and patriotism causes them all to believe that he would be a better pilot for an Apache than the hundreds of other trained pilots the US already has.

It goes on an on.

The copter sequences were brief and uninteresting marred by the inane outbursts of Cage, et al, whooping it up while flying.  NONE of the scenes will remind anyone of the actual footage or audio from actual copter actions in the first or second Gulf Wars or from Afghanistan.

Save your money.",1473465600,2,2145,4.484536082474227
