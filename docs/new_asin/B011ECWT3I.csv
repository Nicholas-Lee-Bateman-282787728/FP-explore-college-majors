7332897,5,B011ECWT3I,Great classic British Sci-Fi. Black and white with the usual British intensity. Very Cold War type movie. Kind of an X File of the 50's.,1459296000,7,136,4.48
7332898,5,B011ECWT3I,"It is about time the price came down on this classic film of the late fifties.  It is of high quality, a clear picture, and the sound is very good.  I waited a long time for the price to come down.  Paying for over priced DVD's is what keeps the price up. Here is your chance to get this classic! at a good price.",1451174400,14,313,3.859375
7332899,5,B011ECWT3I,"Saw this years ago as a boy under the U.S. title ""Enemy From Space.""  Had an old videotape copy with has a small jump in it, in addition to a very slight ""thumping"" sound.  This DVD is extremely good - a few lines here & there, but pretty good audio.  Per the net, was originally filmed in color;  I've seen some of the photographs.  Sure wish I could find that one!  Might be in stored in a British film vault!",1513814400,,411,4.075

7332901,4,B011ECWT3I,"Good transfer and sound quality; considering the price, better than I expected, much to my surprise.  I recommend this DVD to tide you over until a nice Blu-ray is released.",1512172800,,173,4.766666666666667

7332906,4,B011ECWT3I,"This Hammer Films ([shorter]MOVIE) adaption of ""Quatermass II"" is different-spin on the original BBC Television series of Quatermass II.
Since it IS shorter than the multi-episode original, the nuclear rocket sub-plot is reduced significantly. It is a big improvement over the TV
version, but, not in color. If you ARE a fan of the TV series, you'll enjoy this larger-budget version for its, slightly, different take on the story.",1490227200,6,430,5.246376811594203
7332907,4,B011ECWT3I,This version was lightly different than the TV serial I originally watched. Different effects but same overall plot. I enjoyed it very much.,1484092800,2,140,5.130434782608695
7332908,4,B011ECWT3I,I liked it.,1477440000,,11,3.0
7332909,5,B011ECWT3I,One of the better Quatermass movies.  Well thought out and filmed.  Bought this one to replace an earlier DVD that was loaned out but not returned.,1475884800,,147,4.615384615384615
7332910,4,B011ECWT3I,"This Hammer Films adaption of Quatermass II is a nice, different take on the original BBC TV serial of Quatermass II.  As it is a movie, it is much shorter, and, as such, the story line of the nuclear rocket that exists in the BBC TV serial is reduced to a very small sub-plot.  Visually, it is a massive improvement over the TV serial, thought it is not in color.  If you are a Quatermass fan of the TV serials, you will most likely enjoy this version as well, for its slightly different take on the story, and clearly larger budget for locations and sets.",1475625600,9,557,4.285714285714286

7332913,4,B011ECWT3I,The Quatermass movies are great old movies.  It is in B&W but who cares?  Good story.,1471478400,3,85,4.25
7332914,5,B011ECWT3I,A well made movie version of the BBC TV serial and a great example of British 50's sci-fi.,1470960000,2,90,4.055555555555555

7332916,3,B011ECWT3I,"So... Why only 3 stars for an SF classic?  It's all because of the transfer.

If you're looking for a low cost substitute for the high dollar, out-of-print, Anchor Bay release of this title this will do.  But don't make the purchase expecting a high quality version.

First, it's a MOD disc.  Yep... burned on demand and *not* pressed.  This crucial piece of information is conveniently ommited in the listing.  Fortunately I paid just over five dollars for my copy so am not *too* upset, just disappointed.

Second, the aspect ratio is off a bit.  This was filmed 1.66/1 but this disc is 1.33/1.  That means either it's been cropped at the sides *or* is being presented ""open matte.""  As there appears to be ample head room in the frame I assume it's being presented ""open matte"" and framing looks quite acceptable if zoomed to fit a 16x9 HD TV.  Sure, you lose some image at the top and bottom of the frame but the majority of the visual information lost this way is negligible.

Third, while the print is relatively clean and in fairly good shape the transfer has a small, almost imperceptible, ""bouncing"" of the image where it appears to shift a scan line up/down every second as if it's being frame adjusted for a PAL-NTSC video transfer.  That's right. It appears to have *not* been a direct transfer from a film source but to be sourced from a very good PAL copy although I saw no other anomalies of a video master.  In all fairness, this effect is only slightly distracting and you may not even notice it unless you're looking for it.  There's typically enough movement/action in the frame to make it mostly unnoticeable. Several scenes have a ""grain"" appearance which looks to be digital in nature as it doesn't look like natural film grain. This is perhaps caused by aggressive noise reduction although there are no other obvious issues this practice causes.  In spite of these issues the image is acceptable having good contrast with no ""blooming"" whites or ""crushed"" black levels.

So... taking away 1 star for this being a MOD release and another for the transfer issues leaves 3 stars.  For a price of five to six dollars it's worth the investment, especially if you're looking for something to get you by while awaiting a high quality, and hopefully BR, release of this classic Hammer Studios title.",1465344000,14,2314,4.683168316831683

8724137,1,B011ECWT3I,"I was expecting to enjoy a good British 1950s SyFy movie as the ""Quatermass Experiment"" aka ""The Creeping Unknown"" is. ""Quartermass II"" was just delivered today. I was disappointed to experience numerous intervals of the audio track fading in and out throughout the entire movie. This defect makes it impossible to enjoy this feature.",1522108800,,334,5.203703703703703

8724140,5,B011ECWT3I,Great old sci-fi movie for the price I paid. This movie surpassed my expectations. The plot was unique and interesting. Perfect movie for Hollywood to remake. I hope they don't try. They would make a mess of it like all remakes. Will Smith would probably get the lead!,1518480000,,268,4.604166666666667

I used an ""Outer Limits"" group on Facebook to ask about it, and several members told me the name of the movie, based on my description.  I immediately ordered the DVD, and the movie was just as creepy as I remembered!  It held up very well,  over the passage of time.",1515110400,,369,4.154929577464789
