6166636,2,B00HIMHXG2,"This was a fair monster flick at best.  I wanted to give it a 3 star, but the acting was sub par.  With Brian Krause you know you are going to get adequate acting job, but most of the rest of the cast seemed like it was their first acting job.  Anne McDaniels evidently got the lead female role for her boob size and not her acting ability.  I guess green screening can be tough for beginners.  If you want to burn some time this movie will do the job.  Better than some monster flicks, but not as good as most. --- Is it just me, but doesn't it bother anyone that in these low budget films everyone runs in and grabs guns (Also becoming gun experts immediately) and no one gets any ammunition but the guns shoot forever.",1400630400,7,721,4.151079136690647

The black guy does die, however, , too bad as he was really hot. I especially liked the digital flash coming from the barrel of each gun, which of course they don't aim well and even if they hit it with 500 rounds, there is no blood on this creature. I would have given it three stars without even looking at it, as all these movies deserve three stars just for the balls the producers had to invest in one more generic monsters.

Seriously, they have these things stuffed in their mouths and they can speak clearly?  Then they pull this tiny little creature out of an egg, probably no more than a foot tall and it can kill grown men with guns?  Granted, everyone holding a gun in this movie is a lousy shot.

6166664,3,B00HIMHXG2,"It's OK, what used to be a typical Sy-Fy channel movie. The special effects are average for a movie like this. There are a few noticable mistakes in continuity along with the usual lack of logic or common sense. There's a chick in a red or is it magenta bikini? I don't know if it was my TV or she had two bikinis that were very similar colors, because sometimes it looked like one color and other times it looked like another. There is a female scientist with a large set of 'brains', and a black dude, who was a guide, this guy should have been the lead, I kept thinking that throughout the movie. And apparently Belize, which although surrounded by Mexico and Guatemala, has been invaded by Jamaican gangsters. And though it has the usual nonsense that this genre has it is a decent waste of time",1475625600,,799,4.369127516778524

6166671,4,B00HIMHXG2,"I was looking for a monster movie for a lazy Saturday night, and this fit that bill.
Sure, it wasn't a big budget Hollywood movie, but it had plenty of action, a few suspenseful moments, and decent special effects.  As usual in these monster movies, almost nothing can kill the darn thing, not even injure the creature that one would ordinarily think should have at least a few wounds somewhere, so of course, there's always the nitwick cases where people are shooting at the thing with pistols and rifles (really? They must have missed all of the scenes in the movie where none of that worked). About the only thing that did make sense was when they started shooting at it with a rocket launcher.
But anyway, it was a fun movie to watch with lots of popcorn and entertaining enough to feel that I wasn't wasting my time.",1475366400,,821,4.510067114093959

The movie didn't take itself too seriously, nor was it ""ironic"". It was just a movie about a giant prehistoric monster that needed to eat everybody. Basic acting, special effects, and plot. The only real issue is the complete lack of, well, anything when dealing with the Navy set. Looked like it was set up in somebody's office storage room.",1475020800,,393,4.614285714285714

6166679,2,B00HIMHXG2,"Well I tried, but I couldn't make it through.

The story and dialog are pretty bad. The acting is okay. Gorgeous location and some hot beach bodies. The gore is unapologetically fake. The action sequences have comically over drawn muzzle flashes, I guess the animator felt like giving the weapons an old fashioned creature feature flash. The monster is alright for a super low budget animation.

This film seemed to have  a lot of the elements of a good movie but it simply wasn't fleshed out. So the film drags quite a bit, conversations often seem improvised, and combined they make watching this a bumpy ride. Lack of nudity doesn't help this film. Also for some reason it seemed to drag, the film felt really slow between bad dialog and action scenes. Lack of gorgeous dives hurts as well. It seemed like a lot of the shots were just boats on still water rather than showing off some tropical scuba/snorkeling.

What are some perks? Gorgeous location. A pretty little blonde gal and some toned men as eye candy.",1474848000,2,1015,4.685393258426966

FFW button, to help thru the boring elements , (ie, suduction, and sex scenes).. me, I'll give it 5 on the animation, 5 for scenery, 2 for plot(old hat), an maybe a 2 for acting, (tho'  I did like Henry's boat driver, his locks were perfect), that is how you balance? if you wanna talk d movies you better come down to just 3. some people would love it, Action,3.,monster believability, 5, scenery 5, girl(s) with big knockers 4, acting, aw say 3 an a half.. to me its not a movie to be put in competition with the likes of godzilla 2014.

It's a mess of treasure hunting, drug dealers, lingering shots on implants, and some sad acting. The plot, and I use that word sparingly here, was all over the place and so was the dialog.

It takes place on an island resort so girls in teeny tiny bathing suits are plenty.  So if you kid is into mammary glands, probably not a good idea.

6166751,4,B00HIMHXG2,"This was a bit disappointing but a real Poseidon Rex could have played it's part better that's for sure, Story was a bit lost  and the cast did do their best but even winning the lottery won't save them from my comments, Okay the creature was trying to get the trophy for best creature but he failed. Story goes that everyone keeps going to part of the ocean that is off limits and the divers get set to blow explosives on the floor, now I noticed a few explosives in the hands of the divers but the explosion looked more like a Christmas lights being turned on and off, This I rated as an B grade so if there is nothing on television you will have to suffer with this I know I did. Directors when you direct the show just remember the little things around you will be noticed and will  put you in the line of fire. I must admit this is not the worse I have seen and this is only my comment.

The sink hole involved is not that deep, but they made it sound deeper.  It also didn't help when they started the movie in the middle of the plot (had to wait for back story to fill in the beginning of the movie).  That was probably just to get you to grip onto your seat when the sea monster took out the bad guys right off the bat.  The effects were not all that good - at least, not in the water.  The sea dinosaur was articulated well, but the lack of believable water behavior when it was swimming around was a big distraction.  I kept thinking, ""Jeeze, that looks crappy!""  The marine lady ""eye-candy"" was hired for her boobs and not her brains, as obviously indicated by her choice of bed partners partway through the movie.  Plot - motivated actions - decent animation - reasonable dialog ... all things that would have helped to make this more than an average movie of the week.

Scene stealer Berne Velasquez, who plays the part of Henry, should have had the lead role. The other actors were sub-par, especially the female scientist who, as someone else has already pointed out, was only hired for her breast implants.  It's worth it just to watch guys with dred locks and gold teeth firing automatic weapons at a dinosaur.  Not suitable for children under 13, unless you use the totally unnecessary love scene as a teachable moment for your young daughters about what not to do and how not to dress.  As with most of these kinds of movies, you will find dozens promiscuous, scantily clad women, and one strong, educated women scientist who is supposed to balance the demenaing portrayal of all the other women in the film.  Well, this movie doesn't even try, even the scientist is loose as a goose.  Great CGI!  This one is worth purchasing so you can watch it over and over again.",1406246400,15,1038,4.603260869565218

Dad and Mom will also enjoy this movie, because it's filmed in a colorful tropical setting, and the characters spend MOST of the movie in skimpy bathing attire, showing off their very attractive bodies.

6166778,4,B00HIMHXG2,"Okay.
Interesting.
Don't know quite what to say.
This movie was directed by Mark L. Lester who also directed Firestarter, Commando, Showdown in Little Tokyo, and a few other ditties.  This movie was supposed to star Corin Nemec but he was injured early on and quickly replaced by Brian Krause.  The story takes place in Belize.  It involves a fifth-rate treasure hunter (Krause as Jackson Jax Slate), who angers the wrong sort of people and releases the lead monster, dubbed Poseidon Rex.  Said monster goes on a rampage.  People scream, people die, it's pretty much what you'd expect from this type of monster movie.  The FX is acceptable but not great.  The acting is barely adequate (at least Krause is enough of a pro to hold up his end of things, the rest of the cast not so much).  There is a high quota of stupidity throughout; this is a ridiculous movie.  Example: no matter what the state of the disaster there's always time for sex (distastefully done off screen).  And it always comes in handy knowing Morse code.

Admittedly, this is a poorly done movie, I didn't expect otherwise (in fact, I hoped it would be as bad as it is).
I thoroughly enjoy monster movies in general, bad ones in particular.  People who do not have the same appreciation for crappy movies should avoid this turkey.  It is pretty awful.
