8189813,5,B000P7V6BK,Always wondered about the British history of the Navy.  I have British friends in the Royal Marines who always speak of these historical topics and we are fascinated.  This is awesome!,1419379200,,184,4.903225806451613
8189814,5,B000P7V6BK,"I had the same issues with the three disk set from the UK. I am not sure what the problem is but it would not play in either of our Blu-ray players.  It would, however, play in our old Phillips DVD player.  I have no reason to believe that the Phillips is anything but a Region 1 player.  So if you order it I would keep the packaging intact until you know it will work on your particular equipment. This has nothing to do with the quality of the series which, as others have mentioned, is quite good.",1312502400,,501,4.091836734693878
8189815,5,B000P7V6BK,"History which is detailed and scholarly, better in a lot of ways than the recent Empire of the Seas
with Dan Snow, although Snow deals with the financial background more.

This series goes up to the Falklands and the recent past, whereas Snow finishes after the First World War.

Highly recommended.",1307836800,,299,4.8431372549019605
8189816,1,B000P7V6BK,"I was one of the writer's on this series (""The Sun Never Sets"")and wanted to get my episode on DVD.  Alas, it would not run on any DVD player save my computer.  It is not region one - so if you are a U.S. resident, don't order this set.
I was able to purchase a playable disk directly from The History Channel.
It's a great series (I may be prejudice) and I heartily recommend it.  But make sure you order a disk that will actually play.",1286841600,5,437,4.058139534883721
