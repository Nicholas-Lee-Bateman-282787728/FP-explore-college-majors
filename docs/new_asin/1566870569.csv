7796734,4,1566870569,"14 year old Isabelle (Laura Alexis) is desperate for love from a man, a fully grown experienced man, not a boy. When a 40 year old mechanic, Georges, whistles at Isabelle's cousin, Isabelle falls madly totally in love with Georges. She starts stalking him, desperate for his attention. She even goes to the trouble of running off Georges' adult girlfriend, several times. This movie has scenes of total hilarity as Isabelle messes with the girlfriend and misfires while trying to seduce a cop on a crowded subway car. I would recommend this movie to the parents of daughters as a cautionary tale. One huge surprise is that there is no nudity in this French flick, which is surprising for a French love story. I would even go so far as to rate this movie PG-10, meaning that kids over ten can watch this movie with parents.",1043712000,19,822,4.636986301369863
