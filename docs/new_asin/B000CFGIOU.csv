If anyone knows where I can get the actual 'I Don't care About Destiny' product, please let me know.",1232064000,2,299,4.357142857142857
8098801,5,B000CFGIOU,"This compacted version is the best ever! I was a little skeptical at first, but it is exactly the same as the four liscensed discs, only you get all the episodes for the price of one disc! The voices and graphics are high quality and identical to the version that is 4 discs long that you buy at your local store. This version saves money and space! I loved it! Thanks to whoever invented the compact box sets!",1153526400,6,410,4.269230769230769
8098802,1,B000CFGIOU,This is a BOOTLEG edition! Gravitation has already been licensed and dubbed! This version is inferior! Stay away fans!,1148774400,14,118,5.2631578947368425
