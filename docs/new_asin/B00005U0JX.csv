1662760,5,B00005U0JX,"Close your eyes. Imagine a colorful, entertaining, indian musical comedy that stops you from breathing... for ca. 4 hours!
The plot : Start of century. Poor villagers beg the local English commander to reduce the tax on harvests (""lagaan""), as it hasn't been raining for 2 years, and they can hardly feed themselves.
The commander refuses, but proposes a bet : if indian villagers manage to beat the english colonists at the cricket game, they won't have to pay the tax for the next 3 years. If they lose, they'll pay it three times.
The action leaves room for a love intrigue between the indian hero and a lovely villager, spiced by the unspoken love that the sister of the commander feels for the hero.
No ""cheap"", laughable, tedious comedy here! but an impressive 'bollywood' production that can stand proudly in front of its public. Don't miss the incredible opportunity to see a GREAT movie, loaded with music, action and heart!
I saw this movie at the Locarno International Film Festival ... in August 2001, where it received the well deserved Price of the Public.",997747200,8,1070,4.789189189189189

It did not play on my newer Blue Ray/HD DVD player which plays all other movies but luckily I had my older non Blue Ray player which played it. Its a long movie but well worth the time. Its based in India in the 1980s when the Brits came to take over India. Its about common folk standing up against oppression and fighting for their rights. The story has many lessons on moral and ethical values as well. Lagaan is an enchanting film that works on several levels: as an exciting sports film, as a poignant triangular love story and as a social and political drama.

The following may contain spoilers:

This is one of my top ten movies.  An investment of time, and worth it.

I wrote a critical analysis of it for a graduate school seminar, a post-colonial literature class.  Aamir Khan's reputation for a flawless work ethic soars -- every detail works, and the end result is magical.

""Lagaan"" must be experienced: the symbolism, the details, the storyline are an homage to Gandhi, ahimsa, and the triumph of good over evil.  Khan's political and social concerns are laid bare, his anti-Imperialism unvarnished.

But it's more than politics, thinly veiled.  It's about the power of non-violence to triumph.  It's a love story.  It's a spiritual manifesto, of sorts.  It's about the power of compassion and goodness over cruelty and greed.  It's a story of idealism and fearlessness, the quintessential  underdog movie; and I would argue it is the best underdog movie ever produced, for it incorporates the elements of India's caste system, British Imperialism, and grants the most unseemly -- a lame untouchable -- humanity.

This isn't about a single underdog, but a motley crew finding something larger, with Khan's character referencing the power of Gandhi's non-violent philosophy, and India's basis for independence.

For this reason the lame hand delivers victory over the iron fist: this is the movie's central symbolism, brilliantly developed throughout, in various ways.

Cannot recommend enough: Khan should have received the Oscar for Best Foreign Film.",1427068800,6,1563,5.21285140562249

1662894,4,B00005U0JX,"(It would be helpful to prospective buyers if this video were available to rent---or stream;  neither of which is possible for the moment on Amazon.  But...)

I'm a bit slow on the uptake.  Apparently, Long is a characteristic of Bollywood films.  I get it now.  ""Lagaan"" moreover, is the fifth longest Bollywood film (for now) at 3 hours 45 minutes.  Yet, it does manage to use its time fairly effectively and didn't seem to drag---and I ended up watching it twice over two days.  It helps, of course, to have something other than a mere interest in being entertained when setting out to watch a four hour movie and for me it's Aamir Khan (a young Aamir Khan at that) who, being the influential and connected ham that he is, is in pretty much every scene.

Fine by me.  He's very easy to look at.

The film details the wager imposed by an arrogant British lieutenant upon Bhuvan (who is not the leader of his tribe) whereupon if he (who has irritated the Lieutenant previously) can beat his team at cricket, he---the lieutenant---will wipe out the Lagaan (tax on grains) for three years.  The drought stricken people could only pay half their lagaan last year and he'd only just imposed a double lagaan for the coming harvest, withering in the fields as it was.

Of course, they first have to learn cricket and the sister of the lieutenant finds his wager unfair and decides to help them.  As with any Bollywood film, there are several musical numbers, and many of them here---especially the one about Rhada and Krishna---are quite a sight to behold.  There's also something of a duet between Bhuvan and Gauri---his native love---where Elizabeth, the lieutenant's sister (who's fallen in love with Bhuvan) joins in, from her rooms, in english, with a western melody, which adds a humorous touch.

But, what makes the movie is the cricket match, which is filmed so well that even people like me, who know nothing about cricket can (with a bit of googling) follow the action with some degree of interest.  And this 3 day match that decides the fate of the village and the lieutenant is wonderfully done.

All in all, a very good use of four cinema hours!",1409356800,,2153,4.650793650793651

1662897,5,B00005U0JX,"""Lagaan"" is a tax levied by the British occupiers of India.

I first saw this film during movie night Friday at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston (The Texas Medical Center). By the end, I was telling the sponsors of the film that it was one of the most enjoyable films I'd ever seen, in spite of its length.

This is a Great Movie, with a totally different perspective of what it was like for Indians living under the British Raj. British and Indian actors, surprisingly good performances all-around, some recognizable Western names and faces in the cast, and both drama and humor along with a little history. It makes for a nice balance and some painless education with your entertainment.

This movie is VERY long; about 4 hours. Most of it is subtitled, but there is also spoken English mixed in. It provides a ""You Are There"" verisimilitude. In spite of the length, I found the movie engaging enough that the time almost flew by; at least as fast as 4 hours can fly.

This is a Bollywood film, and there is lots of singing and dancing for those who like that sort of thing. For your first time viewing, I suggest you NOT fast-forward through it. You might be surprised and find some of it enjoyable. On a second viewing, if you wish, you can shorten the movie somewhat by using the FF button through the musical interludes.",1406937600,3,1335,4.526970954356846

This movie is 4 hours, but don't let the length of it discourage you. Every minute is worth it.

They would bet with the natives that they would remove the Lagaan if they beat them in cricket. Often the Indians would fail because they didn't have time to play, didn't always know the rules, and normally didn't have the correct equipment.

The Fascinating Story and interesting Characters, the Enchanting harmonious Songs, the wonderful Musical and Choreography numbers with scores of people, like nothing I've seen before so Superbly done and put together by Skillful Direction.

I would especially recommend this as as introductory Bollywood film for someone who would like to check out the best the industry has to offer. The songs, some of composer A.R.

1663070,3,B00005U0JX,"Aamir Khan's 2001 film LAGAAN proved a crossover hit for Bollywood, with this Hindi-language drama interspersed with gratuitous music scenes--and a plot based on sport unknown to Americans--surprisingly successful in the U.S. In the late 19th century, during the time of the British Raj, the farmer inhabitants of the village Champaner suffer from a drought. The sadistic commander of the local cantonment, Captain Russell (Paul Blackthorne), loves to humilitate the local king and his people, and he decides to impose three times the grain tribute (""lagaan"") on the area. The villagers protest, but when a few of them interrupt a cricket match played by the British, Captain Russell offers them a challenge.

The hero of LAGAAN is Bhuvan (Aamir Khan), a proud young man who has faith that his village can overcome this challenge, in spite of sceptics and a traitor in their mist. Bhuvan maintains a shy courtship with Gauri (Gracy Singh), the village beauty, who provides moral support. Other personalities from Champaner include a crazy mystic (Rajesh Vivek ), a Judas-like figure (Yashpal Sharma). Captain Russell's sister Elizabeth (Rachel Shelley), secretly assists the villagers against her egoistic brother, making Gauri jealous. LAGAAN makes some political points, as Champaner is India in microcosm, with Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs banding together against the foreigners, and Bhuvan chastising the elders for not welcoming an Untouchable onto the team.

Based on its fine qualities, and the fact that some of its weaknesses are so bad that they are good, one might expect that LAGAAN would be a great party movie. The problem, however, is the film's pacing. The entire last third of this 224 minute-long film is the cricket match. Even for those who enjoy the sport, so much here could have been cut with no impact on the plot. The deluxe DVD reveals that there was even more to the film, which was blessedly cut.

For audiences internationally who want to get an idea of Bollywood, LAGAAN is an imperfect but convenient introduction, being widely available and with an international cast and excellent subtitles. See it, even if it does test your endurance.",1240704000,2,2168,5.153409090909091
1663071,4,B00005U0JX,"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, The Sound of Music, My Fair Lady... I love them and hate them. I watch them repeatedly but I frequently grow impatient and wish that the extremely familiar song was over already. I endure the songs because I love the rest of the movie. Lagaan is nearly identical to these well-recognized musicals in that respect but, as an American, I find that I have a slightly higher tolerance for the song and dance routines in Lagaan. The costumes are gorgeous; the dances are unfamiliar to me and, therefore, catch my eye. The language (I prefer to watch foreign films in the original language with English subtitles) is strange, plaintive, and well-suited to melody. On a purely aesthetic level, the movie is superb.
Moreover, the acting is good and the story engrossing. I knew absolutely nothing about cricket before I watched Lagaan but I was tense through the whole game and winced at every set-back. This movie pulls the viewer in.
Essentially, it is a sports flick in a fairy-tale. The hero forms a team from the inhabitants of his small village. Like the handy sidekicks in the Grimm fairy-tales, each of them has an ability--previously unremarkable--that helps them play the game. For example, the man who raises chickens is naturally adept at fielding the ball and the hunter (who uses a slingshot) throws a wicked fast-pitch. The British players are arrogant, ruthless, and their faces are locked in sneers most of the time, but they are not monsters. The film treats them as pompous intruders whose egos deserve considerable deflation. In tone, it is similar to The Greatest Game Ever Played (Shia LeBoef) and is equally family-friendly.

I'm not a  sports fan but I found the cricket in this rivetting as it is more about personalities and dramatic tension.
Aamir Khan is superb but then so are all the Indian actors. The British are a mix: some good and some having an odd inflection to their English.
A.A. Rahman's score was engaging enough that I bought the CD. There are some catchy tuned but not in an 'in your face' kind of way' (though I like those too). The dancing is a bit more to the traditional.
It is a thoughtful political piece as much as anything about a clash of cultures and some of the dubious styles of British governance that I know are well-documented elsewhere (though I know the British weren't all-bad nor the local rulers all-good as you almost have stereotyped here).

1663077,5,B00005U0JX,"A deeply spiritual movie with redemptive themes that captures the courage and determination of the human spirit, Lagaan will transport you to a time and place you'll wish you were part of.  Can an Indian movie with subtitles hold your attention for nearly four hours?  Our family has watched the DVD so many times we've actually purchased our second copy, and prefer to watch it in Hindi.  The characters pull us in, and we feel part of the community; which love story will prevail?  Will the subjugated and tyrannized be liberated?  Will a seed of hope grow into victory?

Set in rural India prior to gaining its independence from Great Britain, this story weaves together characters from a local British Cantonment, Indian Rajas (regional kings) and poor farmers forced to pay `Lagaan' or tax that has moved beyond burdensome to oppressive.  Seizing an opportune moment, one of the members of a village accepts a challenge from the British officer in charge:  they must beat the British in their game of Cricket to be free of Lagaan for three years, or face triple the tax rate.  The story unfolds as Bhuvan convinces members of his village to learn the game and confront the arrogant captain in a fight that for the village is not only about winning, but literally about survival.

There is much to like about Lagaan.  Of the many powerful scenes, some which may have you on the edge of your seat, two in particular are transcendent.  In order to complete the team, Bhuvan asks an `outcast' member of the community to join.  The other team members are indignant, as the caste system seems this person as worthless scum and his presence as polluting the `system.'  In a powerfully moving scene, Bhuvan makes a stirring speech that puts in perspective what is before them.  They must come together or literally starve.  Gasps are heard as he touches Kutchra (the outcast), but hearts are changed and tears flow as one who has never known acceptance is welcomed as a key member.  (As a Christian, I saw a powerful illustration here of the love and acceptance Jesus Christ offers.)  Later, facing what appears to be certain defeat, the women of the village unite before their temple and begin to sing a song of worship to Krishna --a prayer for intervention.  The scene is stirring:  the devotion and trust in a deity is a turning point for their despair and catalyzes their spirits to face the challenge the next morning.  If only every church possessed faith and worship so innocent, transparent, and `authentic.'

Even the coming monsoon rain carries a spiritual message of hope.  Is God somehow displeased with them?  The villagers' luck changes as the movie begins with drought but ends with a downpour.",1203552000,4,2707,4.796976241900648

This movie served as my introduction to Bollywood and the Indian film industry. Looks like I started with the very best! What an amazing, enjoyable movie! It will make you laugh, it will make you cry. It will have you watching a band of determined Indians play cricket against the villianous English soldiers. A game, that if you're like me, you don't even know how to play but before you realize it you're rooting for the good guys like you knew exactly what's going on. That in itself is a feat of monumental proportions.

1663081,5,B00005U0JX,"I am still in the toe dipping stage when it comes to seeing Bollywood musicals.

I picked ""Lagaan"" as my next Bollyhood film because it appeared to be the highest rated one I could find, and had the reputation of being the most expensive and successful Bollywood film ever made when it came out.  After having spent an entire afternoon watching it I can certainly understand why it has such a lofty reputation.

The full title of the film is ""Lagaan: Once Upon a Time in India,"" which I did not know at the time I watched it.  That revelation is intriguing because it fosters an implicit comparison between this 2001 film from director Ashutosh Gowariker and the Sergio Leone movies ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Once-Upon-a-Time-in-the-West/dp/B0000AUHPG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Once Upon a Time in the West</a>"" and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Once-Upon-a-Time-in-America/dp/B0000DI87S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Once Upon a Time in America</a>"" (but not the Robert Rodriguez film ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Once-Upon-a-Time-in-Mexico/dp/B0000WN140/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Once Upon a Time in Mexico</a>"").  The setting is a small village in the north of India in 1893, when the country is under the rule of Queen Victoria's British Empire.  The land has been suffering from drought for over a year and the villagers and their Raja wants to be exempted from the crippling tax (""lagaan"") that they owe the British government.  The snobbish Captain Andrew Russell (Paul Blackthorne) makes a counter-offer: the village can play his cricket team.  If the villagers win they will not have to pay the lagaan for three years, but if the English team wins they will have to pay three-times the lagaan.  Bhuvan (Aamir Khan), a young farmer, takes the bet to the dismay of his friends and the rest of the village, only one of whom has ever played cricket before.  But the villagers have an unexpected ally in Russell's sister, Elizabeth (Rachel Shelley), who knows the bet is unfair and decides to help teach Bhuvan and the others the game.  Elizabeth is clearly smitten with Bhuvan, much to the consternation of Gauri (Aamir Khan), the young woman who assumes Bhuvan is her intended.

Bhuvan is oblivious to his being the point in common on this particular love triangle, because his attention is first and foremost on the big match.  One of the reasons that this movie runs three hours and forty-four minutes is because it devotes the last third of the film to the cricket match.  The cricket match takes several days to play, so it makes sense that the last third of the film is all about the match.  Now, it could be that the idea of watching a movie where the final conflict is a really long cricket match might dissuade you from seeing the movie more than the fact it is almost four hours long with subtitles because most of the dialogues and songs are in Hindi.  But since the villagers are learning the game that allows those of us in the audience who have never seen a cricket match to pick up enough to appreciate what is happening at the end.  This is of no small importance because the rules of cricket come into play several times throughout the match, as do the particular characteristics of the various villagers on the cricket team, and I ended up like that part of the film more than the charming practice of breaking into giant production numbers periodically throughout the film (including the best training montage set to music since the original ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rocky/dp/B000ICM5VM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rocky</a>"").  So there are plenty of reasons for wanting to check out this film, even if you cannot watch it all in one sitting (but there is an Intermission and a opportunity to make dinner in which curry would be the dominant spice).

In terms of special features there is only one ""Unseen Scene"" included on the DVD, but it runs over 17 minutes.  I have been trying to figure out if it was cut because somehow having a movie run four hours and one minute instead of three hours and 44 minutes makes bad economic sense for movie theaters in India, or if it is because in setting up one of the key parts of the big match it might give away too much, or maybe because Captain Russell goes beyond the pale in his treatment of Elizabeth.  The deleted scene reinforces the interesting idea that there is a clear line of demarcation between Russell's cricket team and the rest of the English in India.  It is Elizabeth who articulates the idea that what her brother is doing is not fair, but Russell's commanding officers believe in fair play as well.  Notice their behavior during the match and how they applaud the best of both teams, as if they did not have a vested interest in the outcome.  The irony that the English players who pride themselves on being great sportsmen are lousy sports is pretty blatant and ultimately we dismiss them as racist caricatures.  That is a minor complaint all things considered (which would include the history of British colonialism on the sub-continent), because ""Lagaan"" is pretty entertaining.  No wonder it has the reputation it enjoys.",1194912000,4,5945,5.468852459016394

Putting history aside, however, I loved this movie for its sparkling mocking humor and for its entrancing music-and-dance. One could make a case that Bollywood is the favorite child of the movies made in Hollywood of Broadway musicals -- ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers"" or ""Oklahoma"" transported to the Hindu Raj -- and this is a very accessible version of Bollywood, a story a western audience can empathize with, plus exotic rhythms and heart-felt singing. One might also make the case that this is the Indian equivalent of ""Rocky"" or of dozens of American sports movies, the triumph of the underdog.

""Lagaan"" shows the nature of imperialism and of taxation in frank and honest ways, without being preachy about it.  Rarely has the nature of the state as a kleptocracy been exposed so well.  The themes of the story are universal, which makes this movie relevant and interesting to audiences outside India.

The director really utilizes the wide screen to great advantage.  From a technical standpoint, ""Lagaan"" shines.  If you are looking for something out of the ordinary give ""Lagaan"" a try.  You will be glad you did.",1189296000,,905,4.824675324675325
1663086,4,B00005U0JX,"Lagaan, Once Upon a Time in India  was really great, albeit a trifle long at four hours.

It is about a village where the people are taxed to the ears by their oppressive English overlord Capt. Russell (Boo! Hiss!), and they need water to grow crops, so they challenge their English occupiers to a game of cricket, a game none of them knows how to play.

Good dramatic performances from the lead, Aamir Khan (one of India's top male stars) and Rachel Shelley as the English lady who shows the villagers how to play.

Indian films are a very different cinematic entertainment style than Western films.  We Americans love our sex and violence, but the Indian cinema is modest and well-tempered.  I believe they still prohibit  a man and woman kissing onscreen.

From our Western viewpoint Lagaan is odd, and defies categorization. It is all of these:  an historical film, a romance, a political film, a sports film, a musical. The Team Building part is kind of like 'Bad News Bears', although it's not meant to be a comedy. However, it is very Indian in that even though it's a dramatic film, occasionally a character will break out in song, joined by an ensemble of dancers.

My favorite character is Deva, the Sikh, who comes from another town ""To beat the English"". There's also an untouchable fellow who throws a deadly knuckleball with his withered arm.  The finale is the cricket game where the Indian men play the nasty Brits into extra innings for an exciting conclusion.

1663088,5,B00005U0JX,"Do you want to see a good movie? One that thrills and moves you? Because here's one for you, and forget about Hollywood for now, this one's a foreign motion picture. At around 3 hours and 45 minutes long, LAGAAN (Once Upon A Time In India) is the loooongest film I have ever sat thru. But, you know, it didn't seem that long at all. LAGAAN is a true movie experience and one which I wholeheartedly recommend to anyone who enjoys good movies, period. In its exuberance and full-on commitment, LAGAAN is an unabashed throwback to the cinema of years gone by before sentimentalism and enthusiasm in films became traits to be pooh-poohed and dismissed by the hip and sophisticated audience. And, yes, LAGAAN is a sports movie. And a musical.

The year is 1893. The British Empire controls a wide expanse of India, it's said thru the use of judicious protection racketeering. This is a time when the Englishmen have no qualms in calling the natives ""darkies"" or ""slaves"" and ruling them with an iron fist. The desert farming village of Champaner, which lies under the uneasy ""guardianship"" of Captain Russell's cantonment, has been suffering thru an interminable drought, as ""parched eyes scan the sky"" in hopes of rain. Despair sinks even deeper for the villagers when Captain Russell (Paul Blackthorne) callously states that, despite the ongoing drought, double lagaan (tax paid out with a portion of the farmer's harvest) would now be required.

But a run-in with the fiery and idealistic villager Bhuvan (Aamir Khan), who makes a dismissive comment about the sport of cricket, influences Russell to capriciously offer a wager: the villagers vs. the British soldiers in a cricket match, with the tax being tripled for the entire province should the Brits win against three years of tax exemption for the province should the villagers prove victorious. Against the counsel of his fellow villagers, Bhuvan takes on the bet. However, contrary to Bhuvan's assertion that cricket was similar to the Indian game of ""Gilli-Danda,"" this British pastime is altogether something new. Now, the men of Champaner have three months to not only prepare for the game of their lives, but to also learn the rules of the sport.

Thanks to Aishwarya Rai, I've been watching Indian cinema for over a year now, and I can say, with good conviction, that LAGAAN is Indian cinema at its finest and most vibrant. Writer/Director Ashutosh Gowariker expertly helms this film and, by weaving an epic storyline with sweeping cinematography and honest acting performances, ends up with a gripping and exciting but still very human drama. Certainly, it's more polished and technically sound than most Bollywood ventures. The protagonists are likable and immensely sympathetic. Actor and producer Aamir Khan comprehends the value of a charismatic leading man and, as the indomitable Bhuvan, he towers over the other characters. On the opposite end of the spectrum, Paul Blackthorne's Captain Russell, the egotistical scoundrel of the film, can only be described by dusting off an old fashioned term, which is ""dastardly."" In his villainous, one-note tendencies, Russell might as well have twirled his mustache. He's a fun guy to root against. Meanwhile, top supporting actor honors go to the intense-eyed Rajesh Vivek and Yashpal Sharma as, respectively, the brash and half-loony fortune teller Guran (who growls out my favorite insult: ""You tea drinkers! Fleabags! Bootwearers!"") and the traitorous Lakha.

There's a love story, of course. There's even a love triangle. Newcomer Gracy Singhy is winsome as the plucky and passionate Gauri, who's ever supportive of her Bhuvan. And, as a dancer, she is sublime. Rachel Shelley, with a more reserved part to play in the quietly spirited Elizabeth Russell, imbues her character with a wistful and gentle charm. Both girls are so engaging, it's sad that, for one of them, the ending is bound to be less than happy.

LAGAAN incorporates the best and most exuberant qualities of Bollywood while conforming enough to the western cinematic sensibilities that it becomes accessible for everyone. The songs are heartfelt and well integrated and the dance numbers are lavish and colorful spectacles. Two of the most evocative moments in the film come in the form of songs, as when the villagers prematurely celebrate the onset of rain and, much later, when the villagers, with utter hopelessness sinking in, fervently pray into the night for salvation.

Incidentally, this film had the unlikely result of making me genuinely curious about the sport of cricket (I actually looked up ""wicket""). The last third of the movie is entirely devoted to the game itself, as the men of Champaner find themselves contending against overwhelming odds. Now, this was an hour and 20 minutes of cricket, which might be the precursor to baseball but still has its own unfamiliar set of rules. Nevertheless, I was able to follow well enough and became so caught up in the doings that, ultimately, the length of time became immaterial. As one British cricket connoisseur mentions, ""Things are certainly beginning to hot up a bit, aren't they?""

Finally, here's how I'll end. This is the movie. An epic tale. An exotic culture. The human condition. Social and racial issues. A defiant stand against oppression. A romance or two. A humorous insult or three. An extended game of cricket. Singing. And dancing. And more singing and dancing. Pure joy. LAGAAN.",1180310400,5,5439,5.070391061452514

This is not an action film, nor is it a high-suspense thriller.  It doesn't have any special effects, no blood, no gore.  And yet for some reason, the story catches you up and you find yourself caring about what happens. Personally, I found that the four hours whizzed by.

I don't know more than a couple of words in Hindi, so I can't say how accurate the subtitles are, but they are certainly good enough to me informed.  I especially appreciated the subtitles for the musical numbers, which you rarely find.

As an American, I find cricket to be rather mysterious.  So I didn't understand the finer details of the cricket match, but I definately got wrapped up in the tension and suspense, even if I didn't know why.  Which, if you think about it, is a good reccomendation!

The acting is great; Aamir Khan is very charismatic, intense, and down right handsome.  I appreciated Gracy Singh's acting as well; she could have really camped up her jealousy scenes, but instead came off adorable; how could Bhuvan (Kahn) not have been in love with her?

I wonder how long it took the British actors to learn their Hindi lines, or if they were doing them phonetically.

Such as people who are intrigued by the power and might of the British Empire as they cast their ruthless pall on India.  Such as people who believe in the power of numbers and that it takes a village to  challenge and defy a formidable foe.  Such as people who cling to the hope for humanity despite oppression, adversity, or in spite of material prosperity.  Such as people who love a hero who never flinches from his commitment to defy the odds at the cost of the economy and lives of the entire village.  And for people who like to see the hero being the object of affection of two women from two entirely different backgrounds.  And lastly, for people who love a little dose of a perfectly crafted musical video depicting an Englishwoman totally in love with an Indian man, as if we were watching an over-the-top soap commercial.

Although direction, editing, and cinematography are well-done, and so is the acting, not to mention the well-choreographed Bollywood musical scenes, the movie could use more trimming, especially the cricket scene.  As the timing of the intermission suggests, you need to brace yourself for another equally long moment of movie-watching, again especially as the three-day cricket game commences.

1663096,4,B00005U0JX,"The idea of sitting through a 3 3/4-hour film about a cricket match didn't appeal to me until I read the reviews for this 2001 Indian extravaganza set in rural 1893 British colonial-ruled India. It's really the only home-grown Bollywood film I've ever seen if you don't count Gurinder Chadha's disappointing multi-cultural Jane Austen adaptation, 2004's ""Bride and Prejudice"". The film's title, ""Lagaan"", refers to the annual crop tax charged by the British army to the provincial Rajah, who in turn, must collect the lagaan from the local villagers.

The plot begins with a drought which has hit the village making it near-impossible for them to pay the lagaan. The cruel, capricious Captain Russell is indifferent to the fate of the villagers and decides to charge double-lagaan. The villagers plead with the Rajah to cancel this year's lagaan in deference to the drought, so the captain proposes a challenge that will either wipe out the lagaan for the next three years or force the villagers to pay triple-lagaan at once. The challenge takes the form of a cricket match between the local British command and a ragtag team of villagers organized and led by a renegade villager, the hot-tempered Bhuvan.

The middle of the film focuses on two plot strands - the local team's haphazard preparation for the match aided by Russell's sympathetic sister Elizabeth, and the romantic triangle that develops between Bhuvan, Elizabeth and Gauri, the local girl smitten since childhood with Bhuvan. Amazingly, about eighty minutes of the final portion are taken up by the cricket match itself in painstaking detail. Even if you know nothing about the rules of the game (as I don't), it is inarguably the best part of the movie. Granted there is little suspense in the outcome and cricket is not the most visual of sports, director Ashutosh Gowariker makes the extended sequence exciting in spite of itself thanks to the creative ways he develops the drama of the match.

The rest of the film is a bit more variable, especially the rather slow set-up of the story, but as a whole, the movie is enlivened by the inevitable Bollywood production numbers. Unlike ""Bride"", the numbers are not interjected as pure kitsch but feed more organically into the plot. What also helps is A.R. Rahman's atmospheric music. One should understand from the outset that this is not a movie of great emotional complexity or dramatic subtlety. Almost every aspect of the film is very in-your-face, and for the most part, the acting reflects such a tone. However, the disparate elements somehow hold together, and Gowariker manages the even rarer feat of making the nearly four-hour running time fly by.

Aamir Khan is a charismatic presence as Bhuvan, and Gracy Singh is certainly pleasing enough as Gauri. Whether forcing the Rajah to eat meat or beating down a villager, Russell is played with such moustache-twirling excess by Paul Blackthorne that his unrepentant villainy becomes laughable along the lines of Snidely Whiplash. Rachel Shelley, bearing a certain resemblance to Courtney Cox, fares better as Elizabeth, though her character seems frustratingly passive despite her bold efforts to help the villagers. Suhasini Mulay lends dignity to her role as Bhuvan's mother, as does Kulbhushan Kharbanda as the Rajah.

Each of the Indian players makes individual impressions, the most affecting being the crippled untouchable Kachra (played poignantly by Aditya Lakhia), at first rejected and then embraced because his palsied arm provides an unhittable corkscrew throw. Special mention should be given to Anil Mehta's sun-drenched cinematography which captures the rural landscape well. The DVD includes filmographies for the principals, but of more interest is the eighteen-minute deleted scene which shows more explicitly Elizabeth's efforts to help the team and her growing infatuation with Bhuvan. Even with its predictable story and relatively shallow characters, the film bursts with such energy and historical detail that it is well worth sitting through the lengthy running time.",1156118400,10,4063,5.206422018348624

This is no ordinary foreign film.

The plot is a rousing tale of a beleagured village, forced to pay heavy tax's to Britain during one of the largest droughts in India's history. Through the arrogance of the British Captain in charge of the taxed country, a bet is raised.

If the village can train a cricket team and beat the local fort's players, the tax will be cancelled for not just this year, but three years to come. If they lose, they will pay three times the normal tax.

1663100,5,B00005U0JX,"I admit that I love films with Anglo-Indian themes. I also love period pieces. So, when I discovered Lagaan, I was intrigued, though somewhat skeptical about its being a musical and about its underlying story. Still, I thought it was worth a shot. I am delighted that I took a chance, as I was riveted for the nearly four hours the film was on the screen. It is little wonder that it was a 2001 Academy Award nominee for best foreign language film.

The film takes place in late nineteenth century India, during the time of the British Raj, in the small rural village of Champaner. It is a poor village against whom a tax, called a lagaan, is levied by the British. It appears that the lagaan goes to support the British cantonment that rules over the Central Indian province in which Champaner sits. The cantonment is commanded by an arrogant Captain Russell, who seems to care little for the customs, culture, and people of India. He typifies all that is bad about the reign of the British Raj.

Champaner has, unfortunately, had a long lasting drought and, as a farming community, the dry spell has been devastating, leaving the villagers on the brink of agricultural disaster. They have been awaiting the seasonal monsoon rains to no avail. When the villagers are told that Captain Russell has doubled the lagaan, as it had been cut in half the previous year due to the drought, they are angry. It is a now an issue of life and death for them.

This brings Bhuvan, a handsome, young, spirited farmer to the fore. Before he knows it, Bhuvan finds himself wagering the future of his village and province on a cricket game, as he has likened it to a local game played by the villagers. The stakes are now higher, for if they lose, Captain Russell has decreed that not only will Champaner have to pay a triple lagaan but the entire province will have to do so, as well. If they win, however, the lagaan will be stayed for three years.

So, it begins. The villagers are a colorful and motley cast of characters, both Hindu and Muslim. It is interesting to see how Bhuvan organizes and trains them to meet the British on what will be the functional equivalent of a field of battle. Village blood feuds and caste prejudices are laid aside in order to do wage their own unique war against the onerous lagaan. They are assisted by Captain Russell's tenderhearted and beautiful sister, Elizabeth, who is disgusted by her brother's meanness towards a people and culture that she embraces. This leads to a love triangle, as Elizabeth finds herself falling in love with Bhuvan, to the consternation of Gauri, a beautiful village girl who loves Bhuvan. He, however, remains somewhat oblivious to the romantic portents swirling about him.

The film take the viewer through the preparations for the game by the villagers, the nefarious duplicity of one villager, and the game itself, which is a tense, three day match in which the rag-tag group of villagers meet the crisply dressed British on the cricket field. The hopes and dreams of the villagers hang on the result of the game, as does the career of the unlikable Captain Russell, whose superior officers have looked askance at his unseemly proposition to the villagers. The match itself, which consumes nearly a third of the film, is exciting to watch. The film is a thrilling epic with masterful performances and occasional exuberant musical numbers that are sparsely interjected at appropriate times throughout the film.

This multi-faceted film is deftly directed by Ashutosh Cowariker, who wrote the excellent screenplay. The acting by the entire cast is stellar. It is also easy to see why Aamir Khan is such a super star in India, as he has all the attributes of a leading man. He is simply sensational. The lovely and graceful Gracy Singh, in her debut role, is wonderful as the lovesick Gauri, and Rachel Shelley is terrific as Elizabeth. The cinematography is spectacular, as are the production values. Altogether they provide a sumptuous feast for the eyes. This film is certainly representative of the best that Bollywood has to offer.

The DVD has excellent audio and crystal clear visuals. The film is shown in letterbox format, and the subtitles are clear and easy to read as they are displayed against a black backdrop. The subtitles are available in English, French, Spanish, Chinese, Korean, Portuguese, and Thai. There is also a long deleted scene included that is very worthwhile, as well as filmographies for the principals in this film.

All told, this is a very fine, worthwhile film to add to one's personal collection. Bravo!",1149638400,,4593,4.783102143757882
1663101,4,B00005U0JX,"""Laggan"" is an interesting Indian musical, that will capture your attention, even if you are not much into musicals in general, and you don?t know a thing about cricket, a sport that has a big place in this film.

Why? Well, to start with the plot of ""Lagaan"" is original, and the director (Ashutosh Gowariker) manages to make it credible. The story takes place in 19th century India, a British colony at that time. A group of villagers have been told that due to a whim of a British colonial officer they will have to pay double lagaan (a tax), despite the fact that they are suffering the effects of a drought. The villagers, led by Bhuvan (Aamir Khan) ask Captain Russell (Paul Blackthorne) to understand their plight, and he tells them that there will not pay lagaan if the villagers win a cricket match. However, if they lose they will have to pay triple lagaan.

Bhuvan recklessly accepts the bet, and has to convince his friends that he did the right thing and that it is possible to win that match. First, though, they need to learn the rules of the game, something they do with the help of Elizabeth (Rachel Shelley), Captain Russell s sister. Of course, there is more to this movie than that, for example the fact that Gauri (Gracie Singh) doesn?t like the attention that Bhuvan pays to Elizabeth, or the problems some villagers have with Bhuvan s leadership. Notwithstanding that, the more interesting part of this movie is how much the possibility of defeating the British, even if merely in a cricket game, meant for everybody.

All in all, I think that you will like this movie. It is interesting and picturesque, so much so that you hardly notice that it is almost four hours long. Recommended :)

1663102,4,B00005U0JX,"If you're looking for an exotic and enjoyable evening, Lagaan is the movie for you.  It's filled with handsome men and beautiful women, lots of dancing.  The joyous scene of the villagers when they think the monsoon rains are coming is a great introduction to India's culture and even its modern problems.

I really enjoyed the moving scenes of the villagers worshipping at their local temple to Krishna and praying for help in winning the cricket game. So many Americans know next to nothing about religions other than Christianity.  Many Americans assume that other religions don't inspire the same sincerity and devotion as their own.  Well, they do.

The film is bit overly politically correct in Indian terms.  The idea that a cricket team from an Indian village of the 1890s would include a Muslim and an untouchable strikes me as absurd.

The character of Gauri is meant to be innocent but seemed weak and stupid to me.  The idea that she is wasting her time being jealous of the Englishwoman Elizabeth when the survival of her village is at stake is at best ridiculous.  Elizabeth doesn't come off much better, mooning over a man from an alien culture she knows on only the most superficial level.  Silliness in the female characters, particularly the younger ones, is common in the Indian films I have seen.  Maybe it's just the cultural gap between America and India.

The film is rather long, and slow-paced by the standards of American films.  Plan to spend a whole evening with it.",1145750400,,1494,4.78515625
1663103,4,B00005U0JX,"Usually Bollywood films give me hives, and I can't watch them.  They are usually padded to ridiculous lengths, and I love long, epic films (Lawrence of Arabia, Ran, The Last Emperor, and Once Upon a Time in America are some of my all time favorites).  Whereas American/Hollywood films will cut their running times down to shorten them, Indian/Bollywood films do the opposite, padding them with ridiculous songs, melodramatic acting, and sappy, childish ""love"" stories.  With that said, this is a grand exception.

The 225 minute running time is completely justified here.  Nothing here feels padded.  The film has songs, but they blend in very well to the narrative.  There is a love story of sorts, but it's relatively subdued by Bollywood standards, so you don't feel that your intelligence is being insulted.  The only objection I have is the cartoonish, villianous, and ridiculous way the British are portrayed here.  I highly doubt the British colonial government would allow one of their own magistrates to make a wager with the municipality's taxes, and three years worth too!  It's highly preposterous.  And the British are just bad guys here with no substance or complexity.

The widescreen photography is magnificent, and it really looks like they made this film with great care.  Bollywood is the most prolific industry in the world, churning out 900 films a year or so, and sometimes a lot of shoddy films get released.  The performances are first rate, but the final cricket match is really extraordinary.  I learned more about cricket from this film then ever watching it on TV, and the last 80 (!) minutes of the film are dedicated to the cricket match (the cricket match is a film in itself).  I remember checking the DVD to see the running time, and I thought ""how are they going to do this?"".  But they do.  Usually in an American film, a climatic sporting event takes 5 minutes or so.  Not here.  They show the entire cricket match, but the filmmakers really put you into the game, and it works brilliantly.  If you have to see one Bollywood film, see this one.  It's one of the best of recent years.",1145404800,,2119,4.795580110497237
1663104,5,B00005U0JX,"This is one of the best films I've seen in a while.  It isn't surprising at all to me to find that more and more quality films are coming from other countries, and India with its over 900 films a year coming out of Bollywood, the world is taking notice.

This is a wonderful musical film set in 1893 India which is under control of the British.  A small village is offered a challenge by the local British magistrate, Captain Russell: beat us in cricket and we will lift your tax (lagaan) for the next 3 years.  Lose, and you must pay three times the tax.  The catch: three times the tax (even double) will destroy the economy and livelihood of the village, plus, the villagers don't know anything about cricket!

Bhuvan is the young man who is offered the challenge.  He sees this as an opportunity to be rid of the British oppression for three years, despite the possible destruction of the village.

The other villagers are angry with him at first.  The sister of the British magistrate decides to help them as she quickly find herself falling for the rugged yet determined Bhuvan.  She happens to be the sister of Captain Russell and feels that he is being cruelly unfair to these poor villagers.

Bhuvan slowly wins over the support of the villagers as they begin to expand their knowledge of cricket.  Their team is a hodge-podge of players with interesting talents: one is a fortune-teller, another is a master with a slingshot; another has quick hands as he's used to catching chickens, while still another (an untouchable with a disability) can make the ball spin when he throws it.

The film has about 6-7 musical numbers.  Anyone who isn't familiar with India, is in for a treat, as India is renowned for their song and dance.  The songs are largely spiritual, lively, and joyous!  The last song is somber, sweet, and full of power as the entire village sings a chant to God, asking for his help as they face a near impossible challenge.  Shahrukh Khan, a popular Indian actor, explains that song and dance is as important in Indian cinema as special effects are in Hollywood.

Aamir Khan is wonderful in this film as Bhuvan.  He plays Bhuvan as a young, idealistic man who is determined to beat the British.  ""This is not a game,"" he says.  ""This is about our survival.""

Grace Singh plays Gauri, a young Indian woman who is in love with Bhuvan and isn't too happy with the attentions that the British woman is putting on him.  She plays the role with the gentle sweetness of a girl in love and is willing to follow Bhuvan no matter what.

This is a sports movie and a musical all in one.  It will leave you cheering and clapping to the music and for the underdog villagers as they attempt to defeat the British in this ""silly, stupid game!""

Unfortunately, American studios aren't making films like this anymore: films that are all-around fun and entertaining for the whole family.  There is no language outside of ""hell"" and ""damn"" in this film, little violence, and no sex or nudity.  It makes you long for the American films of yester-year like an American in Paris, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, and Singing in the Rain.  It isn't hard at all to wonder why Bollywood films are winning over hearts all over the world.  Can you think of many Hollywood films that can combine spirtual music and dance with the film?  And this is a major aspect that makes films like these all the more refreshing to watch.

Well, the fact is that Aamir Khan truly does light up the screen in this outing as he did in the aforementioned. In fact, I'd go as far as to say that every moment he is on screen is a delight. Goodness only knows why the Western film industry have failed to recruit this considerable talent. He is a gifted actor, is profoundly charismatic - and a great dancer to boot! Unfortunately, he isn't on screen for the whole 215 minutes. Moreover, his co-stars pale by comparison. (No pun intended.) Be they the simpering girlfriend, the English Rose or the pantomime British villain, they are all lacking somehow.

Thematically, the film is in the time-honored (fairytale) tradition of the ""Rocky"" movies but on long-play. It drags to an overly long conclusion. And I hardly think four song and dance routines qualify this movie as a musical - especially as none of them are particularly memorable.

I've no idea why the film was nominated for an Oscar. Either it was a bad year for foreign films or the Academy must have felt obliged to include an Indian film for once. It's clear why it didn't win. It's not bad but it isn't Oscar material by a long way.",1136419200,3,1355,4.590909090909091

It is above all else entertaining.

If you don't understand cricket like the Indian village in the film forced to play one game, you should by the end of the film.  I don't think that the British are insulted too much in this film - it does try to capture the best and worst aspects of a colonialism that is probably more carricature than reality.

I first saw this movie in India without English subtitles, but I still got it.  The movie was beautiful because it involved uniting against British rule in the form of a cricket game.  For me, this cricket game actually symbolized political strategic organizing.  Although the odds were against the villagers, the producer demonstrated what real unity can do. Aamir Kahn promoted spirituality, politics, questioning caste systems, love and an overall race and class analysis in a very entertaining matter.  I especially enjoyed the portrayal of a different kind of ""jungle fever,"" and was glad that that Bhuvan and Gauri maintained intimacy and love between themselves despite the white woman as the obstacle.

This movie served as my introduction to Bollywood and the Indian film industry. Looks like I started with the very best! What an amazing, enjoyable movie! It will make you laugh, it will make you cry. It will have you watching a band of determined Indians play cricket against the villianous English soldiers. A game, that if you're like me, you don't even know how to play but before you realize it you're rooting for the good guys like you knew exactly what's going on. That in itself is a feat of monumental proportions.

The second most incredible feat accomplished by this film is the fact that its 3 hour and 45 minute running time flew by like it was 2 hours in length. I honestly cannot remember the last time I became so completely engrossed in a film that time came to a standstill.

Simply put, I was spellbound by this film. Long after the closing credits rolled by the music and dancing continued to resonate within my mind and body for days.

Thank you Aamir Khan for bringing this film to a worldwide audience and thanks to an amazing cast of characters that made this truly one of the most memorable, exhilarating cinematic experiences ever!",1125360000,5,1194,4.617924528301887

  Although the movie starts off a little slowly, give it time!! You'll love it NO MATTER WHAT! Also, the movie is in subtitles, which can be a bit confusing in the beginning.

However, it was because of this movie that I have begun a long love affair with Bollywood films and perhaps even Shah Rukh Khan. He sometimes overacts, cries too much, and is a little too boyish for my tastes but there is something to that man that makes you want to keep watching him. His ability to captivate an audience is practically unparalled by any other star, in my opinion, except for Madhuri Dixit but that is another review in itself.

Lagaan is rich in color, characters, and plot line. Some people have labeled this movie as ridiculous and pointless, due to the main theme being a cricket match, but if one thought about it cricket is very much Indian due to the British influence on their former colony. Lagaan is very captivating with its dance sequences and all ages will enjoy this movie, as long as they are old enough to read the subtitles (for non-Hindi speakers, of course). I have recommended this movie for my friends, given it away as Christmas presents, and the general reaction is pure admiration for the film.

1663124,5,B00005U0JX,"To be quite honest with you, this wasn't the first Bollywood film that I have viewed, but it should have been.  Bollywood is to Indians, Pakistanis and Iranians what Hollywood is to us, except probably about ten times as popular. Bollywood films consist of film elements that are massively appealing to a great cross section of people.  You have your action scenes, the two romantic leads (young and attractive), sometimes children might be thrown in for family appeal, plenty of singing and dancing numbers interspersed between scenes (sometimes, they seem to come out of nowhere!) and the singing voices are always dubbed.  This might sound kind of odd to the average American filmgoer, but this is truly the rage in South East Asia, and has been so for many. many years now.  What's more, many of the plots are originally derived from ancient stories and parables, and oftentimes the ending are more than a little moralistic.

""Lagaan"" is of exceptional quality as, both, a Bollywood film and as a movie, in general.  Also, it succeeds in spite of its length.  (four hours plus!)  That is quite an unusual feat, in and of itself.  This film was directed by and stars the legendary Aamir Khan, a wildly popular and successful Bollywood actor.  The story is quite complex and very intelligent.  It is centered around an Indian village and the English who rule it with an oppressive iron fist.  A tax is required (a tax that the village cannot afford to pay) and the outcome of whether they must pay it or not is determined by the outcome of a cricket match between the Indian villagers and the English.  While the English excel at the sport, the villagers need time for practice.

The acting is wonderful (something that can't be said for a lot of films today, Bollywood and Hollywood alike).  Aamir Khan is a strong lead and the two actresses who play his love interests (Indian and English) are wonderful.  The dance sequences and the music are just beautiful!  Rent this today, but be sure you make time for it and can watch it from beginning to end!  It's worth it.",1102118400,15,2070,4.7027777777777775
1663125,4,B00005U0JX,"This was my first full-fledged trip into Bollywood and I couldn't have asked for a better entry.  While there were some inconsistencies in sound, overall I loved the picture.  Some of the songs and dances were breathtaking and emotionally charged.  In particular the number where Bhuvan and the young boy are sitting on a hill and they're shrugging their shoulders, soon getting the village into the act.  The other number where Bhuvan and Gauri re-enact the love of Krishna and Radha in exquisite dancing.  Also there were many moments of stunning, breathtaking images, including the women of the village seated in the temple praying for salvation.  Absolutely stunning.

While I feel some judicious pruning could have trimmed the nearly 4 hour long version I watched (the DVD of which included an additional 17 minutes cut from this version) the picture did not seem nearly as long as it really was.

Aamir Khan creates an instantly likeable presence, handsome, engergetic and full of great promise and self-assuredness.  I welcome the opportunity to see more of his work.

Gracy Singh is simply irresistable as Gauri - who could not fall in love with this slightly wacky, but ultimately wise in matters of the heart.  She moves with an easy grace and elegance and charm befitting a princess.  Her contribution to the song and dance numbers was exquisite.  More Singh, please!

Paul Blackthorne was a hilarious, old-school villain; over the tope and right out of a penny dreadful melodrama - and I mean this as a compliment.  His unrelenting arrogance made him so oh so easy to hate I almost hissed at his every appearance.  I love a good villain!

Rachel Shelley's Elizabeth was a perfect blend of Victorian reserved beauty and free spirit and noble in her heartbreak.

So many other performances ran the gamut from old school ""b"" stereotypical characters to some original ideas.

The blending of melodrama (in its purest sense) true comedic moments (the hen keeper), self and enlightenment culminated in the scene where Bhuvan shocks the village by touching an untouchable; his stirring, heartfelt speech about brotherhood and putting away castes shaming the village into enlightenment.

Some of the criticism leveled at Lagaan is (I believe) unduly harsh.  This is a charming movie and a perfect introduction into the joys of Bollywood.",1094169600,27,2341,5.044270833333333

Challenged by a fickle little tyrant (not played terribly well), the villagers pull together a cricket team to meet a wager: if they win the match they will not have to pay the lagaan, or tax, for three years, which would be a boon to an area beset by drought.  All of this is in a fine narrative tradition and there is nothing wrong with the film that some editing wouldn't have fixed.  The movie is 3 hours and 45 minutes long, with the cricket match lasting 1-1/2 hours.  Yikes.

Highly Reccomended,1091318400,,382,4.1066666666666665
1663129,5,B00005U0JX,"I admit that I love films with Anglo-Indian themes. I also love period pieces. So, when I discovered Lagaan, I was intrigued, though somewhat skeptical about its being a musical and about its underlying story.  Still, I thought it was worth a shot. I am delighted that I took a chance, as I was riveted for the nearly four hours the film was on the screen. It is little wonder that it was a 2001 Academy Award nominee for best foreign language film.
The film takes place in late nineteenth century India, during the time of the British Raj, in the small rural village of Champaner. It is a poor village against whom a tax, called a lagaan, is levied by the British. It appears that the lagaan goes to support the British cantonment that rules over the Central Indian province in which Champaner sits. The cantonment is commanded by an arrogant Captain Russell, who seems to care little for the customs, culture, and people of India. He typifies all that is bad about the reign of the British Raj.
Champaner has, unfortunately, had a long lasting drought and, as a farming community, the dry spell has been devastating, leaving the villagers on the brink of agricultural disaster. They have been awaiting the seasonal monsoon rains to no avail. When the villagers are told that Captain Russell has doubled the lagaan, as  it had been cut in half the previous year due to the drought, they are angry. It is a now an issue of life and death for them.
This brings Bhuvan, a handsome, young, spirited farmer to the fore. Before he knows it, Bhuvan finds himself wagering the future of his village and province on a cricket game, as he has likened it to a local game played by the villagers. The stakes are now higher, for if they lose, Captain Russell has decreed that not only will Champaner have to pay a triple lagaan but the entire province will have to do so, as well. If they win, however, the lagaan will be stayed for three years.
So, it begins. The villagers are a colorful and motley cast of characters, both Hindu and Muslim. It is interesting to see how Bhuvan organizes and trains them to meet the British on what will be the functional equivalent of a field of battle. Village blood feuds and caste prejudices are laid aside in order to do wage their own unique war against the onerous lagaan. They are assisted by Captain Russell's tenderhearted and beautiful sister, Elizabeth, who is disgusted by her brother's meanness towards a people and culture that she embraces. This leads to a love triangle, as Elizabeth finds herself falling in love with Bhuvan, to the consternation of Gauri, a beautiful village girl who loves Bhuvan. He, however, remains somewhat oblivious to the romantic portents swirling about him.
The film take the viewer through the preparations for the game by the villagers, the nefarious duplicity of one villager, and the game itself, which is a tense, three day match in which the rag-tag group of villagers meet the crisply dressed British on the cricket field. The hopes and dreams of the villagers hang on the result of the game, as does the career of the unlikable Captain Russell, whose superior officers have looked askance at his unseemly proposition to the villagers. The match itself, which consumes nearly a third of the film, is exciting to watch. The film is a thrilling epic with masterful performances and occasional exuberant musical numbers that are sparsely interjected at appropriate times throughout the film.
This multi-faceted film is deftly directed by Ashutosh Cowariker, who wrote the excellent screenplay. The acting by the entire cast is stellar.  It is also easy to see why Aamir Khan is such a super star in India, as he has all the attributes of a leading man. He is simply sensational.  The lovely and graceful Gracy Singh, in her debut role, is wonderful as the lovesick Gauri, and Rachel Shelley is terrific as Elizabeth. The cinematography is spectacular, as are the production values. Altogether they provide a sumptuous feast for the eyes. This film is certainly representative of the best that Bollywood has to offer.
The DVD has excellent audio and crystal clear visuals. The film is shown in letterbox format, and the subtitles are clear and easy to read as they are displayed against a black backdrop. The subtitles are available in English, French, Spanish, Chinese, Korean, Portuguese, and Thai. There is also a long deleted scene included that is very worthwhile, as well as filmographies for the principals in this film.
All told, this is a very fine, worthwhile film to add to one's personal collection. Bravo!",1085961600,14,4589,4.783102143757882

Russell (Paul Blackthorne), the inhabitants of an impoverished Indian village must defeat the local British troops in a cricket match in order to escape from the crippling tax that is levied by the imperialists.  This hugely entertaining film is both familiar and exotic.  All of the conventions of the traditional sports film and love triangle are present and few will be surprised by any of the developments in the story.  However, since this is my first Bollywood film (as it will be for most American viewers), it benefits from the foreign milieu as well as the exhuberance and talent of the performers.  It took a while for me to get into the spirit of the musical numbers with their clearly dubbed vocals, but I was soon captivated by those as well.  Beneath all of the comedy, romance, music, and clearly defined heroes and villains, there is a serious aspect to the story-the repression of native people by colonial forces.

1663133,4,B00005U0JX,"If cross-cultural hits like 'Monsoon Wedding' and 'Bend It Like Beckham' have piqued your interest in Indian cinema, a good way to dip your toe into the real Bollywood experience would be to try Aamir Khan's 'Lagaan' - a four-hour spectacle that will require you to set aside a whole night for viewing.  It's worth doing.
There's some good filmmaking here - Director Ashutosh Gowariker vividly depicts life in a small Indian village at the height of the Raj and shows the onerous thumb of taxation that threatens the village in the wake of a deep drought.  Then, he painstakingly shows the Raj/village confrontation, the cricket challenge that results, building the team, and playing the match.  Even if you don't care for cricket, or even if you know nothing of the game, you *will* care by the end of the movie.  Gowariker and Khan will earn your interest.
A couple of things worth nothing:
- This is a typical Bollywood production with muscial interludes.  Some of the pieces can be an unintentional hoot.  A sample:
In this shower of love
Our heart and body will be soaked
After the downpour the earth will be a mirror made of water
And earth will wear the seven-colored rainbow!
Okay, just a bit stilted.  Since the original lyrics are Hindi, we'll assume that lost a little something in translation.
- Paul Blackthorne is kind of ridiculously one-dimensional as the sneering, haughty, villainous Captain Andrew Russell, who almost has to snap his words through a permanent sneer.
- Rachel Shelley is delightfully peaches-and-cream, milk-and-honey all English wonder girl as the captain's sister Elizabeth.  Obviously, she grabbed all the charm when it got handed out in the family.  Her song - a paean to her crush on Khan's Bhuvan - is the musical highlight of the film.

I think what elevates this film above a typical ""will-the-underdog-sports-team-perform-a-miracle"" is the tremendous emotion displayed by the Indian actors.  The tremendous length of the movie actually aids in building up to the climactic cricket match as well as adding realism to the depth of the hard work the village team endures. Captain Russell, the odious Englishman heading the local British cantonment is a stock character.  Paul Blackthorne plays the part with enough haughty arrogance to make him somewhat believable.  Also a good actor is Gracy Singh, the romantic lead and a beautiful dancer as well.
At a time of lethal ethnic hatred in India, this is a very positive show of Indian unity.  Perhaps a little too subtle for most of us fereenghis (foreigners) is the fact that team includes Hindu, Sikh, and Muslim members working together.

She is a talented dancer trained in classical dance. This is self-evident in her portrayal of ""Gauri"". Unlike the hip gyrating western imitations of a typical Bollywood dance number, Gracie shows unusual grace and beauty in her performance.
Laagan is a beautiful movie to watch.",1040947200,,925,4.751552795031056

I have about seven favorite indian actresses which are the core of my exploration of Indian films, it's like a hobby to seek these films out.  You can start with Amazon's .com Movie DataBase.
I'm not Indian, but, I have to watch, at least, one Indian film, per week.  The beautiful and charming actors and actresses, the beautiful fashion, the great music, and the intense detailed stories.  American films are great, sure.  But, Indian films offer a movie entertainment that Hollywood used to do.  Bollywood film directors need to learn how to do better editing from scene to scene, from time to time, but if you'll allow yourself to see past this common flaw, indian films are just magical, enchanting, and all around great family entertainment.  Remember when films used to entertain the WHOLE family?  That magic is slowly diminishing here in America.  See the films I've listed above, get to know some Indian actors and actresses and then venture off into your own desires in Bollywood entertainment.  Aamir Khan from ""Lagaan"" has dozens of movies to explore.
All the above films are available for rent at any Indian store in your town or village.  And these films that I have listed all have English Subtitles.  If you like ""Lagaan"", than you've just opened the door to another whole world of movie entertainment.",1039996800,12,2332,5.152815013404826
1663146,5,B00005U0JX,What an amazing movie!! I am not a big cricket fan especially since I don't know the rules. But I learned a lot about cricket and appreciate it more. Aamir Khan has done wonders with this film. A beautiful movie. I recommend it to anyone.,1038873600,3,238,4.311111111111111
1663147,5,B00005U0JX,"There are literally thousands of websites on the internet where one can go to find a movie review.  I tend to stray from writing movie reviews on Amazon.com because it seems meaningless considering all the other opinions already floating around in cyberspace.  However, for Lagaan, for this spectacular celebration of Indian patriotism and brotherhood, I have to make an exception.
The story centers around Aamir Khan's character and the rural Indian village in which he lives.  The people of this village rely on farming and agriculture for their livelihood, but years of drought have left them poor and out of luck.  The British, who hold tyrannical control of India during this time, demand that the people of this village pay the taxes (Lagaan) that were required of them.  Having no means of raising money, the village people challenge their British tax collectors to a game of cricket in a double-or-nothing wager.  This is where the real story starts.  The heart of this movie is the way in which men of different castes, religions, and physical abilities unified as Indians in a team effort to beat the British at their own sport.  There are also some intriguing sub-plots involving love, prejudice, social standing, and betrayal.
I'm Indian, and I don't deny my bias towards this movie simply because I can affiliate with it.  But even as an objective critic, I must admit that this is one of the best Indian movies I've ever seen.  India produces more movies than any other country in the world (including the United States), and it is sometimes difficult to sift through the hundreds of hastily made, sub-par Indian movies released every year in order to find the few that are truly worth watching.  Sometimes I tolerate a movie simple because I like the songs in it.  I guarantee that the viewer, regardless of ethnicity, will not be disappointed by the storyline.  I also defy anyone to dislike the songs that are sung throughout the movie.  I went out and bought the Lagaan soundtrack the day after seeing the movie.  This movie is a must-see for any Indian who loves his/her motherland.  Everyone else is sure to love it, too.  I emphatically recommend this movie.",1038614400,5,2179,4.861788617886178

Lagaan is a simple story told so eloquently and beautifully with humor, romance, dance, music and... cricket. 4 hours went by as if it was only 2 and I'm neither Indian nor a big fan of either cricket or the bollywood dance and music. It's pure drama.
The DVD quality is also commendable. It's very impressive to squeeze 4 hrs of essentially artifact free anamorphic video and crisp DD 5.1 audio into one single disc. It looks/sounds awesome on an HDTV with input from a progressive scan dvd player, in fact better than most DVDs I've seen.

1663149,5,B00005U0JX,"This movie produced and acted by Amir Khan, is the pride of Bollywood along with Devdas. This movie is nothing like you have seen before from Bollywood.
Amir Khan just keeps getting better. This movie has everything besides violence and sex. If you can watch a movie without the latter aspects, then you will love it. Beautiful music, beautiful story, Beautiful cinematography, beautiful dialogues, beautiful songs, and beautifully acted. Everything is in place. Yes, it is a bit long but they didn't want to trim it because they wanted it that way. Why? because I think if they trim it, some quality of the movie will be lost for sure. If you have time to watch it, you will just appreciate the movie.
Amir Khan is just mind blowing. The movies he has appeared in are all meaningful and A HIT ofcourse. Right when all India was loving him after Lagaan hit the theaters, he came with Dil Chata Hai which basically made him the unbeatable bollywood actor - Always good! He is the PERFECTIONIST. In Lagaan, His performance can't be performed by anybody else. Just amazing.
  Gracy singh, opposite Amir, is pretty and cute and does very well for her first film. She acts well, and dances beautifully. Applaud to her.
  A.R.Rahman is a big asset. His music moves the movie. His songs make you love the movie. His music for this movie is original and you can't forget. You will listen to the soundtrack again and again and even if you don't listen, you will remember his music - his signature. Just Awesome.
 The Director, Ashutosh Gowarikar, comes as a breakthrough director. He establishes his status. Just great. I just love his direction.
  Although Amir Khan, Gauri, A.R. Rahman, and The director are the most important, every actor in this movie is an asset to the whole movie. The british actors perform very well. Without them, the movie wouldn't make sense at all. So, they are very important and all of them, perform very well.
  In fine, This is a MUST see movie whether you are Indian or not. I am not Indian myself. So, you better watch it..or you are missing big time.",1035849600,2,2077,4.6530054644808745
1663150,5,B00005U0JX,"Most certainly one of the best picks of ""Bollywood"" (India's Hollywood) movies and was the Indian nominee for the Oscars. It was one of the shortlisted movies for the ""Best Foreign Movie"" category. Despite the length of the movie,a fairly easy flowing script and a simple narrative style makes the movie interesting.
The story (purely fictional) centers around characters in Bristish-India era involved in making a rag-tag cricket team to take on the ""foreigners (Bristish)"" team with a simple proposition - If the Indian team win, they can excape from paying a particular ""tax"".  The plot then revolves around the making of the team.  Viewers not familiar with the social structure in India and some of the religious overtones underlining the politics may not be able to fully appreciate the symbolism in the movie..bringing together of Muslims and Hindus ""upper"" and ""lower"" caste....all to face a common ""enemy"" - the British. A simple allegory to India's independence struggle where  people from all religions, castes, social background united to oust the British.
Told over a game of cricket (not sure how many viewers can relate to the game - something like baseball, lets say for now), and mixed with a generous dose of music videos (a must for all mainstream commercial movies in India), romance, and some amount of melodrama the movie does manage to keep one glued to the screen for the entire duration. The cast is packed with some of the better known names in Hindi film world and also has one of the living legends of Hindi film worls as a narrator. The script also manages to keep a fair view on the British - not all of them were power-hungry and some could even empathise with the Indians, and helped them.. A well-scripted movie with plenty of plenty of symbolism to India's independence struggle..
The subtitles do full justice to the dialogues, though does a poor job for the music videos (and understandably so). The extra features on the DVD are also worthwhile.",1035763200,,1982,4.892857142857143
1663151,5,B00005U0JX,"Normally the idea of an almost 4-hour movie with 7 show-stopping song-and-dance numbers would send me running from the theater screaming.  We have also seen this plot a million times before:  the group of misfits and underdogs band together against overwhelming odds and triumph over a repugnant opponent in the end.  The characters in the film can border on the cartoonish at times.  So how is it that this movie can be so entertaining?  I am mystified by the fact that I enjoyed it so much.
But the fact remains that this movie is tremendously engaging.  Despite its length, it never bogs down.  Despite the obvious outcome of the cricket match, the movie loses no intensity.  As for the song-and-dance numbers...well, I think Broadway could take some pointers from this movie.  I never found myself cringing as the music started up and the characters suddenly broke into another song.
This is definitely one of the best efforts of Bollywood.  There are not a lot of movies that I would happily go back to the theater to see, but this is one.  It is just simply fun and entertaining...four hours well spent!",1034294400,,1109,4.7539267015706805
1663152,5,B00005U0JX,"Despite the fact that I bought the DVD some time ago, it took me a couple of months and 2 tries to actually get into it enough to watch. Knowing that it's approx. 4 hours long, the first time I popped it in and started struggling through the subtitles, that baby was out of the recorder about 2 minutes later! Well, it took being held up in bed sick to finally motivate me to try again.
Lagaan is an enchanting film that works on several levels: as an exciting sports film, as a poignant triangular love story and as a social and political drama. I like all of the above-mentioned genres with the major exception of sports films. However, I found myself thoroughly caught up in the big game, which actually adds at least one hour to the film's length. It is through this game that so many of the wonderful characters that are introduced throughout the film get their moment to shine: the fortune-teller, the crippled low-cast outcast, the village ""idiot"", the reformed Judas, etc.
I also appreciated the film's attempt to be fair: it would have been very easy to make the Brits all look like ""bloody colonial twats"", and the Indians smell like roses. We get to see Brits who where appalled by the way that their fellow countrymen behaved towards the Indians, and Indians discriminating amongst themselves due to their cast system. These areas of grey add layers to what might have been a fairly one-dimensional, Indian version of Mighty Ducks! That said, the very clear lines between good and bad help one cheer the underdogs on and ultimately make this a warm and fuzzy, feel-good-movie.
The cast, lead by Aamir Khan - a wonderful mixture between Tom Hanks and Elvis Presley (!) - is wonderfully diverse, and the films length allows us to get to know each and every one of them. It is my understanding that Khan is somewhat of a superstar in India, which probably means he'll never have the desire to breakout and start an international career. I guess we'll just have to keep watching him in Bollywood films - if his other films are as charming as this one, however, than I certainly don't mind.",1034121600,54,2097,4.609625668449198
1663153,4,B00005U0JX,"Anticipating a category 4 hurricane's track can be an upsetting ordeal.  In order to take my mind off the threatening weather, I rented this four hour epic to watch in lieu of the usual media coverage of Hurricane Lilli's landfall based on positive reviews that I had read for the movie ""Monsoon Wedding."" I was not disappointed.  Although set in a different time period, Lagaan more than adequately soothed my hurricane-jangled nerves and more than once had me laughing out loud, tapping my feet and smiling broadly.
The plot is a typical one:  underdogs in the form of a raggle-taggle group of villagers battle a pristine regiment of the British Raj which controls the local cantonment .  The violence however is minimal, no grand battles or scenes with charging horses and sabers flashing in the sun.  Here, the rivalry between the two factions plays out on the cricket field where the well-trained and cohesive British team locks horns with the just barely strung together eleven of the villagers.  The villagers have a lot at stake; the lack of rain has presaged a poor crop for the season, yet the British have demanded a double tax but have provided a loophole--if the villagers win the cricket match the Lagaan (tax) will be suspended for three years,if they lose, they pay triple tax instead of double. Despite the villagers' lack of desire to pick up the gauntlet, it takes only one hothead to seal their fate.
Like all inspirational stories of this sort, this one relies on strong archetypal characters to make it feasible.  Bhuvan is the idealistic village dreamer who accepts the challenge and must face the wrath and disbelief of the villagers.  Silly sweet Gauri is the girl who hopes to win his heart and stands by him during the selection and training of the makeshift team.  Captain Russell, as the arrogant British officer, is easy to dislike while his sister Elizabeth, innocent and well-meaning is admired and pitied as loses more than her brother's respect when she clandestinely aids the fledgling cricketeers.
Totally unexpected was the musical aspect of this film.  As in any Broadway or Hollywood musical, spontaneous moments of song and dance happen throughout the film to emphasize and reveal the characters inner emotions to the audience.  Thankfully, most of this film's numbers are limited to colorful renditions of Indian folk music and dance which to my Western eye and ear were different enough to maintain my attention and actually add something to the story.  Happily there were no showstoppers during the crucial cricket match only play by play action which had my eyes riveted to the screen and my teeth clenched each time the Indian team erred.  Of course, there is no surprise at the outcome, but the getting there is worth the four hour viewing time.
I would highly recommend this film as family fare although I doubt many of the males will sit through each and every song and dance.  If a more contempory adult story is warranted, try 'Monsoon Wedding'--more singing and dancing although a bit more world beat and five simultaneous stories spinning off the one wedding event.",1033689600,3,3117,4.901140684410646
1663154,4,B00005U0JX,"My first exposure to Bollywood came in the form of 'Asoka'. I cannot begin to describe the reaction it instilled in me except to say that Shah Rukh Khan is now a major star in my house and that my dvd rarely stays in its case. Whichever film I chose to watch next was going to have to work very hard to even come close. It's a good thing I chose `Lagaan'.
 `Lagaan' is a story built upon immense emotion. Anger, despair, joy--they're all remarkably on display in this epic film. And the viewer experiences each in turn. Each character (or set of characters if you are to lump the British into one group) represents typical roles. You have the ""good"" Bhuvan, willing to give anyone a chance, to defend his beliefs with passion and conviction. You have the ""bad"" Captain Russell, vindictive and malicious, blinded by what power he has. However just because they do not appear to be multi-dimensional it does not hinder the impact of their presence. You find yourself a staunch supporter of the rag-tag band of would be cricket players, willing them to form a cohesive team in order to beat back the casual brutality of the British officers. There are moments that in any other movie might seem contrived, leading, but in `Lagaan' are simply moving. One such case involves an ""untouchable,"" a crippled man of lower caste, and his scenes are heartbreaking where they might have been considered didactic. There is also a love story, a love triangle of sorts, but it is handled in a refreshing manner, and is thankfully overshadowed by greater aspirations-namely, the game of cricket itself. Whoever thought that a roughly two hour game that some of us have very little familiarity with could be so exciting, so nail-bitingly intense? But then, it's not really the game itself that is so intense, but the hope you have for the ""home team"" and their inevitable victory. By the last minutes of the game I was practically in tears and smiling all the same.
The music of `Lagaan' didn't carry the same energy and playfulness that `Asoka's did. The songs were meant to be more a part of the actual story then an interlude designed to add to the over all appeal. I appreciated them more for their connection to plot then for the choreographed dance moves assigned to them. Really, they were nice, but not at all necessary, and that's not a bad thing.
Though my heart still belongs to `Asoka' in terms of Bollywood productions, it's really no wonder `Lagaan' found itself in Academy Award contendership. It is a quality film with a wonderful sense of atmosphere and emotion. Even if you're not one to normally sit through an epic movie in subtitles, give `Lagaan' a chance and sit back to enjoy a remarkable film experience.",1033257600,,2711,4.683438155136268
1663155,5,B00005U0JX,"I saw this movie almost a year ago and was very happy with it. Many Bollywood (India's hollywood, by the way i found out it is bigger than hollywood and that it is watched by oriental people, middle eastern people, russians, and other europeans as well) movies are full of fluff it seems like. Not Lagaan. I really enjoyed this movie for several reasons. While there was a clear distinction between the good and the evil in this movie, it didn't take the cheap way out of showing all the Indians as good and all the British people as bad. One of the villains is an Indian, and one of the heroines is British. It also didn't attack the British imperialists head on, it depicted a wonderful story through the use of Cricket. It is long but worth every minute! I highly reccomend you guys to check it out and as other posters have written, check out other Indian movies as well. Taal is good (aishwarya rai is very hot!), Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Mission Kashmir (action), Devdas, etc.

1663156,5,B00005U0JX,"This is a story and film that could kick the [rears] of today's Hollywood filmmakers.  An epic along the likes of Gone With The Wind meets Lawrence of Arabia, Lagaan is long, yes, but you remain rooting for the heroes, and hating the bad guys, all the way to the end. For an instance of where length does *not* work, just check out the American western epic ""Heaven's Gate"" by Cimino.  It has it's moments, but ultimately you find yourself thinking, ""why did I sit here for 4 hours with this?""
Lagaan has strong characters and maintains it's plot momentum quite well. The lead character is almost too perfect; a rebel, yet able to get people of different minds together for one cause, a temperamental, yet kind, person, able to stir passionate feelings from women, yet bound to honor one.
Plot? Evil old British Empire seeks to destroy a rural village by extracting 2 times lagaan (tax payment, with rice (? or some other agricultural product, can't recall), even though it is a time of drought and they will starve themselves if they have to pay that much tax.  Our hero challenges said Evil Brits to a game of cricket, much to the village's horror, since they really know little about how to play. Evil Brits say they will have to pay triple lagaan if villagers lose, otherwise, the tax will be cancelled and villagers will pay none for two years.
Sounds simple, but the fact that they managed to wind all sorts of great plots around this simple story proves how well written and thought out this movie was.
Now - the musical numbers!
They, like the old Astaire-Rogers bits, or any other good old musical, carry the story along, come at the right time (about every half hour or so) and are lively, vibrant and fit in perfectly with the story.
Hurrah! I haven't been this entertained in a long time, and with having to read 4 hours of subtitles, no less!
A gem, one to watch over and over and enjoy.  I can't see too many cultural boundaries with this.  It's just plain great storytelling with a beautiful visual style to boot.",1032307200,3,2028,4.545205479452055

As in many modern Bombay films, you'll find musical numbers, love triangles and lots of energy, but somehow this movie manages to tie it all into a cricket match and make it very, very watchable.  How this is possible - cricket is a game that I, like most Americans, find completely incomprehensible - is beyond me, but it's done and done well.
The basic plot is that a tyrannical British captain in 1893 British-ruled India challenges a group of poor, starving Indian peasants to a game of cricket.  If the peasants win, they'll be absolved of their grain levies (the 'lagaan') for three years.  If they lose, they'll have to pay triple.  From there, the movie follows love triangles, musical numbers, morality plays, religious discussions and culture clashes for three and three-quarters hours, but somehow never becomes boring - even if the movie is completely predictable.
For the DVD itself, the transfer and sound seem adequate - surprising when you consider that there is more than four hours of video on a one-sided disc.  There are only two extras - a filmography of the director and four main stars and one deleted scene.  However, deleted scene is almost 18 minutes long and the size of the movie pretty much prohibits anything else on the disc.
I would recommend this DVD to anyone - families, movie enthusiasts, people looking for a way to kill a whole afternoon - whether or not they're familiar with Indian culture or the ""Bollywood"" phenomenon.  I am simply amazed that a movie so predictable made about such an unlikely subject - cricket - could be so wonderful.",1029024000,7,1689,4.780068728522337
1663166,4,B00005U0JX,"most of the stuff that has been coming out of bollywood lately has been - frankly - repetitious [ideas]. lagaan is a recent exception; the industry seems to be taking a turn for more thoughtful film. this movie's music is great (what else do you expect from ar rehman?), the cinematography is excellent, the costumes are lush, and the actors and actresses did an excellent job (yay aamir and gracie!). I don't even like cricket.
it's a great movie for anybody unused to bollywood film to start with, and a good movie for anybody disappointed with bollywood lately to watch. can't wait to see more quality stuff coming from us desis :D",1026950400,4,634,4.669642857142857

In fact, I found it refreshing and quite enjoyable. I bought the video and have watched it several times over. The music and dancing are wonderful as is the cinematography. The soundtrack is absolutely wonderful and I listen to the hindi songs over and over. The story is also engaging and wonderful as well. I was completely drawn in as I watched a village of simple peasants humble the arrogance of British imperialism. Aamir Khan is also a wonderful performer not to mention extremely handsome.  I'd recommend this movie to anyone who likes epics or good movies in general.",1026604800,,742,4.621212121212121
1663168,5,B00005U0JX,"Once upon a time in India, there was a little village under the rule of a good and fair raja, who was in turn under the rule of the English army. On one not-so-very good day, the evil colonel decided, in a fit of spite, to push double Lagaan (i.e. taxes) onto the villagers. Shocked and angry, a young and optomistic man named Bhuvan led the villagers to the colonel's residence to protest. They couldn't possibly pay the double Lagaan, there hadn't been any rain for two years!! The colonel decides to be kind, and strike a deal with young Bhuvan. If the villagers beat the English army in a game of cricket, they wouldn't have to pay Lagaan for three years. If not, they would have to pay triple Lagaan. Against the wishes of the other villagers, Bhuvan accepted.
 And so begins Lagaan, a beautiful four hour epic about how Bhuvan's village comes together to take on the colonel and his team in a three day cricket game. The story is full of rich characters, and a touching story of a love triangle between Bhuvan, the village sweetheart Gauri, and Elizabeth, the colonel's sister.
 Probably the best part of this movie is the life that all the characters are full of. Their expressions give amazing vitality to the movie.
 The songs are amazing too, far better than those in any American musical I've ever seen. Every one tells a story; the village's want for rain, Gauri's love for Bhuvan and her jealously of Elizabeth, and the need to beat the army in their cricket game.
 Although this movie is four hours long, it seems to go a lot more quickly than that. Even if you have a very short attention span (like me), you'll be able to watch the entire movie in one or two sittings. I strongly reccomend buying this movie, not renting it, because I guarentee that you won't be able to let it go!",1025654400,5,1797,4.469512195121951

1663171,5,B00005U0JX,"I know nothing about the Indian culture or music, and I was a bit skeptical that a 4-hour subtitled movie filmed in India about CRICKET would be of interest to me. I loved every minute. Not only was this movie visually beautiful and well paced, it also has a ""good heart."" Although a classic tale of courageous common folk rising up against oppressors, the story is told with humor and affection and with an infectious joy and innocence that is very appealing. One example of the director's skill is that even though most of the film is concerned with cricket, a sport about which I know absolutely nothing, the movie never lags or slows down, but keeps an active pace.
The singing and dancing were very enjoyable. Even though I had never been exposed to Hindi singing before, my ""Western"" ears still found the music very beautiful.
I can see why the actor who played Bhuvan is a big star in India--very charismatic and charming, as well as very good looking.
I will definitely watch this again and again. We made an ""Indian Evening"" out of it, getting recipes off the Internet for Indian food, and munched on Tandoori chicken and vegetable curry while watching the DVD at home. Great fun!",1024012800,182,1189,4.639810426540285

1663173,5,B00005U0JX,"I waited for quite some time to watch this. I thought that it would be one of those movies-all hype and no substance.  I was wrong.  The pace of the movie is deceptively slow, yet almost four hours pass without any tedium.  What starts off as a tale of a quaint if somewhat impoverished village, slowly metamorphosed into a hot bed of revolution.  Only the revolution is silent, bloodless.  The fact that the English 'rulers' were ruthless and cruel is no secret.  We have seen that in Mel Gibson's PATRIOT.  But what is new is that the way, peaceful demonstartion of collective will of people turns the tide and beats the British in their own game.
The lonely, idealistic, somewhat naive figure of Bhuban does not make much of an impression in the beginning and indeed I wondered at his naivette secretly, but that boy had what no one else seemed to have at that time- a Conviction and a will to Win, and to be free.  Through his youthful eyes, which sometime glint in hopeless anguish we see how hope grows and how it infects the whole village.
The introduction of Eliza (the evil captain's sister) is just a catalyst for the bomb that was waiting to go off.  The quiet and unspoken chemistry between the two of them (Bhuban and Eliza)smoulders like fire under a heap of ash.  Bhuban can not have failed to notice because everyone else has.  But Eliza redeems herself by keeping her honor even when it makes her suffer inconsolably.
The interplay of prejudice, of caste system, religious bigotry, all unfold before us like a rich tapestry which feels as contemporary as if it is happening today, yet over a hundred years have passed.  Free of the British, India has not yet been able to break free from it's many demons as recent events show.
In the end it was just like any Bollywood movie- a make believe world where everything works out in the end.  This must be the singular fault of the movie yet you forget that in the four hours that passes so quickly.  It must be the shortest four hour movie.  Oh, and one more thing- the audacity of putting Cricket as the center piece of this epic, even though half of the world does not understand it was refreshing.  It was not about Cricket-Cricket was just a prop.  The film was about the courage to want to make a difference.",1022803200,2,2276,4.4987834549878345
1663174,5,B00005U0JX,"As other reviews have said, the core plot of Lagaan revolves around the desperation of Indian villagers under callous British oppression. Years of drought have made it impossible for the locals to pay the tax that is used to maintain the British presence in their midst. Their attempt to get the tax postponed or forgiven fails, and their angry, frustrated young unofficial spokesman impulsively stakes the villagers' future on a cricket match against the British team. Do the Indians know how to play? No. Do they have even the beginnings of a team? No. But it doesn't matter -- they have to win this match or face starvation. It's an old-style movie with all of the predictable bits and a few that could happen only in India -- good versus evil, bold youth versus cautious old age, preserving one's culture and identity versus going with changing times, untouchables versus the other castes, locals versus invaders, a few good people among the villains and a few bad ones among the lowly good guys. Love relationships are played out in parallel to an ancient Indian folk tale told through an Indian holiday celebration. Song and dance -- amateurishly lip-synched and energetically performed -- occur at the expected moments. This is a film that must be taken seriously for the sincerety and universality of its message and, at the same time, a bit lightly for the unsophisticated way in which it has been made. I loved it, and -- the next time I have four hours to spare -- will watch it again, even though I will know how it ends. Actually, I knew how it was going to end while I was watching it the first time. So will you, and it won't matter a bit. It's a lot of what it is.",1022716800,4,1680,4.584717607973422
1663175,4,B00005U0JX,"It is a feel-good movie for your whole family and very funny. I could enjoy more if they made it shorter by cutting some songs and dances. The songs and dances routines are really corny and strangely choreographed. The main character Bhuvan played by Armir Khan looks too handsome and princely for the role. But still I could not help cheering for those poor farmers, a bunch of very funny characters.",1022630400,,401,4.661971830985915
1663176,4,B00005U0JX,"LAGAAN was released in the video stores a few days before it was released in the theatres and probably this fluke will encourage more people to take advantage of this beautifully produced epic Indian film.  Subtitled ""Once Upon a Time in India"" this luxuriously photographed movie presents the struggle between Indian vilages and the occupying British Colonialists at he turn of the last century.  And while the message of supression by outside forces is dealt with in a strong manner, LAGAAN seems more interested in informing us about the magic of Indian living by means of dialogue in Hindi and English and in spectacularly staged musical and dancing numbers that are so integrated into this film that they never appear like superfluous add-ons.  The actors are all excellent, the panorama of India is brilliant, and the messages about the caste system, British ""superiority"" as displayed in a game of cricket that takes the whole of the last half of the film, and village togetherness play well indeed.  Actor/Producer Aamir Khan proves a handsome, vital, fine dancing presence that binds together this 3 and 3/4 hour epic and makes it all move fast!  Now to visit the theatre and see it where it belongs - on a very large and panoramic screen!  Highly recommended in informative.",1021248000,7,1284,4.948837209302326

1663178,5,B00005U0JX,"As the parched earth waits for the rain, the village girl Gauri (Gracie Singh) waits for the young village farmer Bhuvan (Aamir Khan) to discover her heart. Together they fight for freedom from tyranny as Gauri encourages Bhuvan in his quest to take on the most important challenge of his life.

This is a story of triumph over oppression. A story of how the human spirit rises to new heights to overcome injustice. The plot is uncomplicated, which leaves room for fascinating choreography, discussions of cultural issues and moments of pure abandon. The dance sequences tell stories only dance can tell. It brings together the thoughts and feelings of the characters and creates a sacred space where the characters enter the realm of spirit.

Set in the 1890s, the residents of a small farming village in rustic Gujarat, India are waiting for the monsoon when they discover they will now have to pay twice the amount of lagaan (agricultural tax) they normally have to pay. With just enough food to survive they are literally going to have to fight to survive.

Captain Russel (Paul Blackthorne) almost overplays his part as the colonial officer (of the cantonment which rules over the neighboring villages) to emphasize the absolute absurdity of the situation. He demands complete obedience with no regard to the human suffering his laws will produce. He challenges Bhuvan to a game, knowing he has never played Cricket. If the village loses, they must pay triple the tax (lagaan). Bhuvan must not only gain the support of the terrified villagers, he must rally a team and train them within a few months.

It is completely unfair and the officer's sister, Elizabeth (Rachel Shelley), takes pity on the farmers. Against her brother's will, she starts teaching the villagers how to play the game of Cricket. In the process she falls in love with Bhuvan. It is a shallow love at best. While she is beautiful, Gauri is completely captivating in her complete innocence. Gauri's jealousy over Bhuvan's attentions towards Elizabeth is spectacularly portrayed in dance.

The sweeping cinematography creates a magical ambiance and seems to invoke a certain unity of purpose. The delicious wide shots are sumptuously filmed, completely captivating your entire being. This movie will hold your complete attention, even through the Cricket scenes. One you fall in love with Gauri and Bhuvan, you rally to their cause and the sheer tension of the moments during the Cricket games keeps you completely entranced.

The love story is exotic, the choreography like you have never seen, the songs are intoxicatingly beautiful with poetic lyrics. I've never imagined anyone could combine so many elements into one movie. Sports and a musical? It is amazing how Ashutosh Gowariker knows how to appeal to the human heart in such a way as to combine a musical, political drama, universal emotions, poetry, community culture, romance, dance, artistic cinematography, patriotism and the brute strength of valor.

A movie that emerges slowly and works its way into your heart. First peeking out of the ground and then bursting into full bloom in moments of sheer beauty that will take your breath away right up to the exciting climax.

Story Telling at its Finest!

i am no big fan of hindi movies though i am an Indian but this movie is a great change from the run-in-themill BOLLYWOOD movies. the best thing about the movie is the music.

but i simply loved LAGAAN and being a very big fan of cricket i thoroughly enjoyed it and am yearning to see it again. the actors have done justice to their roles. gracy singh is graceful. the songs(chalechalo, mitwa, o rey chori the theme& ofcourse radha kaise na jale) and their lyrics were brilliant. the picturisation is brilliant. the direction is good. it is must see movie coz after a very long time an hindi movie has been made worth seeing (coz some effort has been put to make it watchable). i just wish more BOLLYWOOD directors will follow suit and stop making stupid and worthless commercial movies.",1018396800,3,1231,4.54954954954955

The cripple is good, and the sikh and the muslim and the priest and the retard and the rest of the stock Indian unity characters, even the whiteys.  If you're real nerdy you start wondering about postcolonial representations of colonial india and how they change and who's who.  The old guys watching the cricket game that are really just into the cricket, they're alright, and the umpires never cheat.  The game is pure.  And the loser heads to (gasp) the african desert.

This is the main message preached by Lagaan. Lagaan is not a movie about cricket. Lagaan is a movie about the triumph of human spirit. It is a movie about unity of people of all races, genders, religions, and classes. It is a movie about a war without bloodshed.
Though Lagaan may be a product of India, it is a film with universal appeal. Lagaan is not only a meaningful film, but it's also a great entertainer.
Referring to the dvd itself, it is a bit disappointing for such an excellent film. Breaking it down into subsections:
Video Quality: Excellent. Compared to other Indian dvds, this is truly excellent quality. One really gets the true feel of Champaner.
Audio Quality: Exclellent. The 5.1 surround sound is great quality, and is really noticable udring the songs.
Extras: Above-average. This is where the disappointment sets in. The only true extra on the dvd is a deleted scene. That itself is wonderful to watch, but that's all there is, along with some written filmographies. No interviews, no award ceremonies, no other deleted scene, no commentary, nothing. Additionally, the menus are boring and static.
Lagaan truly is a movie that all should see. While the dvd may not be perfect, it still is a great opportunity. Those who haven't seen Lagaan, especially non-Indians, should grab this opportunity, and rent a copy as soon as possible. Not an experience to be missed out on.",1015718400,5,1563,4.771217712177122

Because of the conditions in which they left India, much of that history was lost.  I always wanted to understand what life was like for them back in India.  Why did they leave and was life better for them in Trinidad and for so many other Indentured Workers?  So many unanswered questions...but, Lagaan gave me a glimpse of that history...of how hard their lives were...of how hard they had to work under very harsh conditions.  Some of the little that I know of my great-grandparents is that they were farmers in India, probably very much like the farmers depicted in Lagaan.

1663187,4,B00005U0JX,"Okay, I won't go into the plot, since I'm sure it has been posted here many times, but I will review the film and DVD.
The story is simple, but enjoyable.  The performances, especially of Aamir Khan and Paul Blackthorne are excellent.  Aamir Khan, who is the producer of the film, is good at acting as a simple villager and Blackthorne is just a hair shy of being a cartoonish villain.  There are many emotional points in the film and while you may think you know the outcome of the film, Ashutosh Gowariker's script and direction often make you question your prediction.  And of course, A.R. Rahman's music is excellent.  Well shot, well acted, well written and directed, Lagaan is worth your time.
Now, onto the DVD.
Lagaan is almost four hours long.  Unfortunately, Columbia has chosen to squeeze the whole thing, plus about 10 minutes of cut footage, onto one dual layered disc.  There are some compression artifacts, such as pixxelation, as a result.  Some digital noise reduction has been added, which results in the image blurring when the camera moves (and the camera moves often) or when there is fast movement.  I saw green flashes during some of the splices, and the print, at the beginning, has a few dirt and lagging hair problems.  The Dolby Digital 5.1 sound is very powerful, rendering the dialogue and music well.  About 10 minutes worth of a deleted scene have been included, and it is easy to see why it was cut.  Select filmographies round out the disc.
My verdict?  I loved this film.  No, it isn't the most complex story, but it touched me without resorting to corniness or oversentimentality.  The DVD is much better than other Hindi DVDs.  Recommended.",1014508800,5,1676,4.727586206896552
1663188,5,B00005U0JX,"This is THE Indian crossover film. Indian films generally cater to  niche audiences of expatriates. Filmmakers like Satyajit Ray do have an audience in USA but then again due to the themes of his films they remains ""art-house"".Commercial Hindi films have never made it big in USA.The main reason being the Indian-ness of the plots which make it difficult for non-Indians to grasp the motivations of the characters.
Lagaan is unique in the sense that it does not sacrifice the integrity of the Indian characters for the sake of effecting a crossover. It is more ""Indian"" than many of the trash that are Indian films today. And despite maintaining a very Indian look and feel, it is a movie with an universal message,which is about the triumph of the human spirit. It also is a movie about non-violent struggle,something very relevant in the world today. It has a message without getting preachy. And it is never boring despite its length.
I don't think it will win the Oscars. But that is not because of the quality of the film...far worse will be taking home the Oscars this season. It is because this will lose out in lobbying because it is not backed by any of the major American studios.

This film came at a perfect time.  It's not often we find films about the era made by the people who had to live through it.  In this film we see the British at both their best and worst.

A lot of times I find the soundtracks more appealing than most of the stories. My Indian buddies and I used to joke that Hindi movies are pretty much about guys and girls trying to get married! (No offense...) ;-)
However, Lagaan surely goes beyond the romance category. I feel it's more like an EPIC! It's about great human spirit that overcomes formidable circumstances!! I was so very touched by the story. I'm also very impressed by its cinemography. So much more sophisticated than any other Hindi movies. Plus the sweet and innocent romance doesn't appear cheesy at all!!! Although I feel it's a bit improper to compare what's between Radha and Krishna to the more one-way traffic between Elisabeth and Bhuvan... Just a thought.
I'm glad to know Lagaan has been nominated for Best Foreign Film category of the Academy Award. Since the competition goes fairly strong, I don't really expect Lagaan to win.

the story of a spunky group of Indian villagers who play a cricket match against their oppressive British overlords in 1893 with their tax bill on
the line.  If they lose they owe triple lagaan (land tax); but if they win they'll owe no taxes for three years.  With drought having destroyed the
previous year's crop and little sign of rain in the current season, there's no prospect of them being able to cover their bet, so they are truly
playing for their lives.
The leader of the group is Bhuvan (Aamir Khan), a brash and handsome young man who is goaded into the bet by the vile commanding officer
of the British cantonment, Captain Russell (Paul Blackthorne).  Shocked at her brother's unfairness and more than a little smitten with Bhuvan,
the visiting Elizabeth Russell (Rachel Shelley) decides to help the villagers learn the game.  The people of the village, Champaner, are initially
distraught at the predicament that Bhuvan has gotten them into, but as he slowly assembles a team--including a strapping deaf-mute; a crazed
holy man; a Muslim; a rather excitable chicken wrangler; and finally even a crippled untouchable--they are more or less shamed into embracing
the effort.
The match itself, for those of you who aren't up on your cricket, is spread out over three days, and by the time all is said and done, the movie
has spread out over four hours.  But I assure you, it's not one moment too long.  Besides the already considerable plot elements outlined above,
there's also, despite Elizabeth's longings, a great love blossoming between Bhuvan and a lovely village girl named Gauri (Gracy Singh).
British authorities, none too pleased with Captain Russell's arrogance, have informed him that if he should somehow lose, he'll be headed to a
tour of duty in Central Africa.  Unbeknownst to our heroic cricketeers there's a traitor in their midst.  Oh yeah, and the whole cast periodically
breaks out into mammoth song and dance numbers.  It's as if the folks who made the movie decided to cram the entire history of the cinema
into one film, and, believe it or not, they pull it off.
Sure it's pretty improbable and the social history is fairly ridiculous--the scene where the untouchable is not only accepted as part of the squad
but invents the googly is particularly divorced from reality.  But this is a movie after all, a big sprawling movie that's bent on pleasing the
crowd, and does, so we're more than willing to give it some historical leeway.  And in its eagerness to please, the film provides scenes and
themes for viewers of nearly every persuasion to grab onto.  My personal favorites are that the entire showdown is fueled by unjust taxation,
rather than the kind of racial mau-mauing that you'd expect in a modern movie.  The filmmakers are also generous enough that, even though
Captain Russell and a few of his teammates are portrayed as real Simon Legrees, most of the British are eventually shown rooting for the
underdogs and the refereeing of the match is proper to a fault.  But, for my money, the best scene has the entire village submitting to the will of
Lord Krishna and prevailing upon Him to help them in their time of trouble, even in the midst of this mighty effort where they've finally learned to take the initiative and help themselves.  Topping it all off, the entire film re-enacts the ancient Hindu legend of Radha and Krishna, a tale of platonic love.  When's the last time you saw a Hollywood movie where any of the love was platonic?
With sweeping scenery, fabulous looking actors, and a thrilling blend of action, comedy, and song and dance, this is certainly the best musical
epic to come along since maybe The Sound of Music.  In fact, it's one of the most enjoyable movies you'll have seen in a very long time.

1663192,5,B00005U0JX,"Undeniably the most important movie to come out of the world's largest film industry (Bollywood) in decades, Lagaan rewrites Indian cinema history. At the cost of sounding repetitive and borrowing from Pritish Nandy's review of the same movie in Mid-day (June 20, 2001), ""Our cinema history will now have two eras...Before-Lagaan and post-Lagaan.""
A running time of over 3 hours and 45 minutes, a period drama set in rustic Gujarat of the 19th century, a largely unknown (at least hitherto not so popular) cast, an ordinary looking debutante leading lady, a two-flop director, no mushy romance, no sex, no violence, a leading star who appears in dhoti.....a sure-fire recipe for disaster? Think again. A sure-fire hit, a stunning spectacle of the triumph of the human spirit, and just about the finest statement made on behalf of Indian cinema...that's Lagaan for you.
Some emotions are very basic. They cut across cultures, time zones and generations. Lagaan evokes those emotions. It touches and activates those basic nerve circuits that send an electric shudder of exhilaration through your body, that rush of blood in to your heart, those goose pimples on your skin. It makes you stand up and applaud, because it stands for everything that an Indian is proud of. In fact it stands for everything that civilization stands for. I always wondered if any movie churned out by Bollywood would truly capture the soul of India. I was disappointed for years, because despite the great movies (oh yeah there are too many Indian movie gems) India produced, there was hardly any movie that embodied the Indian spirit completely. I was also disappointed because the only movie that came close to capturing what India was all about, was Ricahrd Attenborough's Gandhi. A film made by a Britisher, that came tantalizingly close to symbolizing the Indian-ness that I was so proud of. Circa 2001, all that changed. Lagaan changed it all. It made sure I have something to cheer about.
I watched Lagaan for the first time in Bombay's Eros cinema, in it's first week of theatrical release. When I saw ecstatic viewers run up in the aisles towards the screen, dancing and clapping, I felt the same thrill. I felt it then and there. This was a completely new style of cinematic Indian patriotism. Understated, yet strong. Stylistic, yet simple. Multi-layered, yet basic. For giving us this immense, unadulterated pleasure, Aamir and team take a bow! Lagaan is a glorious invitation to the world, to come see India, it's spirit, it's people.
The DVD has high production values and is a relief when compared to the DVD quality of some of the greatest Indian movies. The extra features make it worth every penny of the [price]for the DVD.",1013990400,3,2717,4.9605263157894735
1663193,5,B00005U0JX,"Having seen both Amelie and Lagaan i am in a good position to judge which one is better. Amelie is living in a world that is totally unreal it has been specifically targeted towards audience. Although the movie is set in 90's it gives an impression that we are seeing 50's world and tradition there. The plot is too thin. The lead character Amelie certainly doesn't know what she wants in life. So one can hardly call it an inspiring movie. The lead character sneaks into others room in the name of doing good, counts orgasms, hooks up shamelessly two people only to see them part later. It defies logic. On the other hand Lagaan is movie making at its best. It is an epic. It has struck a beautiful balance between plot development and character development where as in Amelie there is no plot to develop. Amelie can at best be called a good comedy movie. Certainly it is not oscar worthy. No Man's Land is better than Amelie.",1013731200,,927,4.458823529411765

1663195,5,B00005U0JX,"This is the best movie that you will ever see! If you are looking for an all around good entertainer this is what you are looking for. The director of this movie, Aushutosh Gowarikar has done a great job. The main stars of this movie are, GRACY SINGH, Aamir Khan, and Rachelle Shelly. This movie takes place in 1893, Champaner India. It is about the British Raj in India, and some of their cheating ways, and how a small community gets together to overcome these hardships. Also weaved into this story is a love triange, including GRACY SINGH(GAURI), Aamir Khan(Bhuvan), and Rachelle Shelly(Elizabeth). It is interesting to see how these people try to get through their relationship problems, sometimes allowing for a funny scene, and sometimes for a tear-jerking scene.
The music in this film (this is a musical) is excellent. Such songs such as Rakha Kaise Naa Jale evoke so many emotions through their meaningful lyrics. In this particular song, the story of the Hindu God Krishna and his consort Radha is expressed. The story of Radha and Krishna is that Krishna would dance and spend his time with many gopis (girls) in the garden insteak of only with Radha. Infact the title translates to how can Radha not be jealous. The music is expressed beautifully through the immortal voices of those including Alka Yagnik and Udit Narayan. The beautifully choreographed dances also accentuate the music and moods of the characters.
The movie is best summed up in the words of Aamir Khan himself, when he said in a recent interview (something along the lines of) This is a movie about the human spirit.",1013126400,,1598,4.8145454545454545

1663197,4,B00005U0JX,"In 'Lagaan,' a village is forced to pay double the Lagaan (tax) of the previous year; the villagers approach their puppet king Raja Puran Singh to be lenient to them as the monsoons have not come yet. British Captain Andrew Russell who pulls the rajah's strings says that he will cancel the land tax for the next three years if they (the villagers) beat the British in a game of cricket. Bhuvan (Aamir Khan), someone the captain dislikes intensely, is asked to make the choice for the people; Bhuvan of course chooses to play the British. The rest of the movie deals with the ramifications of that choice, with the villagers trying to learn the game of cricket (with a little help from a nice English lady) and -- of course -- the final showdown. I wouldn't expect this movie to win any Oscars (even though it is an entry), but 'Lagaan -- Once upon a time in India' is a fun movie. That is if you can sit through nearly four hours of it (not entirely unusual in Indian film-making). If you can, you will see that Lagaan has a fairly predictable plotline, but that it also has plenty of unpredictable and funny moments along the way. Great songs by A.R. Rahman add to the 'Bollywood' feel of the movie. The only issue that I have with this movie is that the English gentlemen and lady seem like cardboard cutouts when compared to the ragtag Indian team's cast of colorful characters. However, this is a well-produced and acted movie; it is also a great introduction to and contribution from India's Bollywood. -- MovieSwami.com",1012780800,,1526,4.572992700729927
1663198,5,B00005U0JX,"The cover looks sappy and this movie may at first seem a deceptively simple treatment of some history that remains politically charged but as you watch you realize that the film not only has a heart but a spine as well.
The colonial officer of the cantonment which rules over the neighboring villages and collects tax from them in the form of grain(Lagaan)is an example of the very worst type of Englishman. The Indian director makes use of similar stereotypes to depict the various Indian characters who are seen as pure and earthy and prone to break into dance and song spontaneously. It sounds a bit ridiculous and it is a bit but its also really good. Even the musical numbers (once you get used to the idea) are really enjoyable blends of Indian traditional dance and story telling with modern moves and grooves thrown in for good entertainment value(and also to show that the struggle for Indian identity is an ongoing one). What unites the various factions of Indians is that they have a common enemy, the English. Together, says their young leader, they can come together and make a fist and defeat the English despot. But the war is not played with guns and cannon rather it is played with ball and wickets and cricket bat. The Englishman in a display of self-aggrandizement and arrogance has mockingly challenged the Indians to beat them. If they win the tax will be suspended for three years, if they lose triple tax. Knowing the rules of cricket will help, but if you don't the game which lasts three days is very enjoyable as the Indian characters representing the various castes and divisions in Indian life each take on very distinct character traits making them each distinct individuals.  For the greater good of all they have put their differences aside and joined together but it is those differences that make you like each one separately as well. The English are for the most part the English, some just a little worse than others, but there is at least one exception, the cantonment masters sister, she also sings a bit. Very enjoyable and effective treatment of the colonial situation. You will be rooting for the Indians even if you are one of those dreadful English, its impossible not to, because, of course, the Indians are right, its their country.",1012521600,5,2276,4.747474747474747
1663199,5,B00005U0JX,This was an utterly delightful surprise.  I've watched Hindi films over the years for mainly camp value.  What a surprise then when I was utterly bowled over by this movie.  Total emotional involvement.  I was on the edge of my seat with suspense during the cricket match.  And in tears by the end.

1663200,5,B00005U0JX,"Okay, first of all the title - Lagaan in Hindi for Tax. That out of the way let's get to the story: Here's a first - an Indian movie which is historically correct and not ultra-jingoistic either. So basically this movie is about one village's fight against its imperialist masters - it'll appeal to all those Left-wingers our there. At the same time, it gives the outsider a very good picture of British Rule over India. The movie is 90% in Hindi(with English subtitles), and 10% in English, and this adds to the effect - how odd it is for such different cultures rubbing up against each other. Above all this story is about hope and courage - In order to maintain their hold over India, the British would play one Indian king against another, and in exchange they would demand taxes. These taxes would be squeezed out of the poor villagers/peasants in the Kingdoms of the weak Indian kings. The British, having an empire to maintain, were pretty harsh. This is the story of how one village fought the British, but in a novel way - no guns and violence - but a Cricket Match. Most Americans are probably unaware, but the English hold Cricket in very high regard and as the embodiment of fairness and sportsmanship. The British have a phrase - ""That's not cricket"" i.e. that's not fair, or proper. With this background, one can see that Indian villagers fighting British Officers in Cricket Match is a possible, even plausible event. Be warned though, this is your conventional Bollywood movie, and that means that it's 3 and half hours long, and there are many songs. But the benefit of DVDs is you can always skip to the next (post-song) chapter. Very well made, and decent performances all around.

1663207,5,B00005U0JX,"Well, to put things in perspective, being somewhat snobbish in my movie tastes, I am not too fond of the Hindi masala movies churned out by Bollywood. Lagaan stands for ""land tax"" and the basic storyline is pretty simple. The setting is rural India, circa late 1800s, when the British imperial raj was at its zenith.  The drought stricken villagers, who are driven to desperation by the doubling of the tax, wager to play a cricket match against their rulers. The stakes are pretty high: If they win, the tax levy for the next two years will be waived; if not, they will have to pay triple the tax.
I must confess to having started watching this movie w/ a sense of skepticism, and suffice it to say that in the end, I was simply blown away by it. It should be mentioned that this reaction could be on account of my ethnic origin, and my avid interest in cricket. Nonetheless, this shouldn't take away anything from the superlative performances, great direction and music, excellent production values, and Anil Mehta's cinematography, which gives the film its unique palette.
I can state w/ confidence this is is on par or even better than ""Crouching Tiger..."", and audiences who appreciated the latter film will most certainly enjoy Lagaan, the subtitles and the running length notwithstanding.

Once again, Aamir Khan has done a wonderful job, this time playing the character of Bhuvan, a simple village boy with a lot of guts. Newcomer Gracy Singh, along with British actress Rachell Shelly have both done  fantastic jobs for their first Indian films. The movie is set during the time of the British rule in India. It is basically about a village in India, and the lagaan (""tax"")which the villagers are forced to pay in the form of crops to the Britishers. Unfortunately, the weather has been terrible and the villagers hardly have enough to get by on a day to day basis; certainly not enough for the lagaan. Bhuvan is challenged by one of the British officers to a game of cricket, and if he wins the lagaan will be pardoned for the next three years. However, if Bhuvan and the villagers do not win, a heavier lagaan must be payed. Bhuvan accepts the challenege, but has no idea how to play cricket! The rest of the movie follows, and of course all is well in the end. As can be seen, the story line is completely different than that of other Indian movies, making it a very enjoyable film.
