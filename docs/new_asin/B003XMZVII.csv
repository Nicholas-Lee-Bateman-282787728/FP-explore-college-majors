4218423,5,B003XMZVII,"I purchased two of these to donate to nursing homes.  I figured it would be cheerful.  I opened one to watch it, and cheerful is an understatement!  It is shot in crisp clear high definition, and the editing is excellent.  It gives you a choice of two music genres, jazz or country. I highly recommend this dvd as a gift to your local nursing home, or any shut in's that you may know. It's a delightful dvd!",1354320000,2,407,4.246753246753247
4218424,5,B003XMZVII,I bought this DVD for Christmas and I love it. The music is real nice too. I like the variety of displays that are included. The DVD is an hour long and loaded with footage of lights. Great for reference and ideas for your own displays!,1325894400,2,236,4.1521739130434785
4218425,5,B003XMZVII,"Lots of bang for the buck.  As far as the jazzy music, its alright.  The video made for a nice background screne.  Not sure you could sit down to watch this from start to finish.  But, great when coming and going, while getting Christmas meals ready and all.",1325289600,2,258,4.3125
4218426,5,B003XMZVII,"We've had this DVD less than a month, and it is watched weekly by my holiday-crazy husband! Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys Christmas lights.  We really enjoy the option of changing the kind of music to listen to while we watch our lights.",1314921600,5,248,4.636363636363637
4218427,4,B003XMZVII,"This dvd is perfect to get your fill of holiday light displays without driving all over town. Plus everyone can enjoy, no one has to drive. I had it on Christmas Eve when extended family was over and it was a hit. I especially liked that the it was shot in snowy areas, as we live in So. Cal. Music was just okay for us. We played it muted.",1294963200,5,340,3.9420289855072466
4218428,5,B003XMZVII,"I have several of these 'ambient' DVD's. They range from excellent to terrible. This one is on the excellent side. The music is wonderful. You have a choice of 'Charlie Brown' style Christmas music or country style Christmas music. (Think 'Smokey Mountain mandolin'.) Both are very good. I don't know if they used a synthesizer to create the music but it does NOT sound synthesized. It sounds like they used real instruments. (I'm adding this because I have some of these where the music is clearly synthesized and sounds terrible.) The visuals are as if you are taking a leisurely drive through a (snow covered) neighborhood to view the Christmas lights. A pastime many of us have experienced. The editing is nice a smooth with slow pans and some close-ups that let you actually view and enjoy the lights. (No 'MTV editing' here.) It's very pleasant for watching or for putting on in the background for a party or baking cookies. The hour long DVD also loops so it doesn't stop playing until you press stop. The picture is very sharp both on the 50"" plasma and tube TV. I have a feeling I will be watching this one when I `need a dose of Christmas' during the year! Well worth the money.",1293926400,7,1188,4.582159624413146
4218429,5,B003XMZVII,This DVD is better than a fireplace.  Looking at all the creative ways people decorate their homes for Christmas is inspiring.,1293148800,6,126,5.0
4218430,5,B003XMZVII,"I took a chance and ordered this DVD for the holiday season coming up, and I gotta say I'm very impressed with the presentation and production of this DVD.  Borderline Media did a great job of capturing the Christmas vibe perfectly with this DVD.  The houses and lights that are captured are completely stunning, and the music is really excellent.  I do prefer the Jazzy 'Charlie Brown-Esque' music over the Country selections, but it's still done well.)  Overall, this is a really great package and I can't wait to share this with friends and family on Christmas Eve.",1288915200,14,568,4.76530612244898
4218431,5,B003XMZVII,"I really don't know what to say than WOW! If you love Christmas lights, this is a must have. The music alone is worth double the price.",1287878400,17,135,4.037037037037037
4218432,5,B003XMZVII,"All I can say is the footage of the houses in the DVD is very well done, and since it's a full hour long, I thought they would be using the footage of the same houses a couple times....not the case. In fact, I don't think you see the same house more than once, and there are a lot of them. It kind of reminds me of a fireworks show, just with Christmas lights. The music is so cool! It reminds me of that jazzy Charlie Brown Christmas music. I was even more surprised when I saw in the menu that you can pick to watch the DVD with country versions of the music too. A+ in my book.",1287792000,27,580,3.8823529411764706

4218448,4,B003XMZVII,Wow!! I've never seen light displays like this where I live. I am glad I don't have their electric bills. The displays are fabulous. The music is soft jazz or you can choose country. Very relaxing. An excellent evening entertainment.,1383264000,,233,4.85
4218449,5,B003XMZVII,"This is a great background DVD we play on Christmas Eve or parties during the holiday. Lots of pretty, colorful, bright images. Music is good too.",1364860800,,146,4.653846153846154
4218450,4,B003XMZVII,"It has many good ideas for setting up outdoor christmas lights, besides just a nice pleasant viewing for the holidays",1361750400,,117,4.9
4218451,3,B003XMZVII,"It's OK. My husband and I do our our awesome lights display each year. I was expecting some amazing displays from all over the country... This kind of looks like someone went out driving through their own personal neighboorhood to make this film. Some of the displays are great, others are like a few lights strung over the bushes in the front yard and a sickly looking reindeer. Not very well done. There are 2 music options: The first one is pretty standard traditional type, the other is more twangy... and, in my opinion Ehhh.... For lack of a better word the whole DVD is just Ehhh.... it's ok.",1359244800,,599,4.504587155963303

Will be enjoyed for years to come.",1357516800,,114,4.476190476190476
4218454,3,B003XMZVII,There are only two forms of music--jazz and country western.  I thought there would be something traditional.  I have to add three more words.  Why?????,1356652800,,152,5.0
4218455,5,B003XMZVII,I put this on for my Christmas Party - It has great background music and I don't have to change the CD's!  Just put it on and leave it - AND it's a great conversation starter for my guests!  What a great idea!,1355356800,,209,3.8372093023255816
8408411,5,B003XMZVII,Great DVD! Professional quality and it really starts up the holiday mood in our household. Highly recommend!,1511481600,,108,5.411764705882353

8408413,5,B003XMZVII,Exceeded my expectations! The video was excellent and the music was cheerful and calming. Was everything as advertised. I'm going to bring it to our family's Christmas party.,1509753600,,174,5.25
8408414,3,B003XMZVII,"This is an okay DVD.  The elevator music of ""Jazz Editions"" and ""Country Editions"" of Christmas Standards should have been dropped from the get go.  What the makers of this program should have done was to read the Poem of ""The Night Before Christmas"" and excerpts from ""A Christmas  Carol""  A oral History of Christmas lights also would have been a great asset.  However what does work well in this is the fact there is a varoety of houses with different types of Christmas Displays.  The fact there is real snow on the ground helps make this DVD worth watching,  If you have a big TV then I suggest turning off all the light to your home one Night and just play this.  It will light up your room!",1505088000,,697,4.348837209302325

8408416,5,B003XMZVII,"A while back I was wishing out loud that they made DVDs like this. I'm a transplanted Yankee from Western NY where the snow is, as well as the best Christmas decoration displays. Before I retired and moved to Ft. Lauderdale, a home town TV station used to shoot footage of home Holiday displays and run it during the signoff credits after the 6:00 and 11:00 news during Christmas week. So after I made the move, I wrote them an e-mail saying I was homesick for the Holiday light displays up there--why didn't they make up a DVD of the stuff? Never heard back from them. You see, displays around here run from the ludicrous (decorated palm trees---come on already!) to overkill (every year some resident in this county sets up a display that must run his electric bill up to match his December mortgage and his neighbors cry to the Sheriff's office about spectators parking on their lawns). And yesterday I see this disc and its sequel here. I promptly ordered both. Somebody else on here expressed hope that a ""volume 3"" is in our future, which gets an amen from me.",1445299200,,1066,4.528497409326425
