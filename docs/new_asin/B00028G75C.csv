2067992,4,B00028G75C,"Much of Abraham Lincoln's life has been accounted for and reaccounted for a thousand times over. The facts play around in our minds, much without emotional anchors to hold them down. Prolific and outspoken writer Gore vidal penned a ""fictional"" account of Lincoln in his marvelous book, which a few years later, adapted into a made-for-TV movie. The result, then as now, is an intriguing insights into the personality of the Lincoln family.

The movie starts with Lincoln slinking into Washington DC, for fear of a secessionist uprising in Balitmore, under disguise, for which he was much aligned. Constrasted with Mary's arrival, with hoopla and a thousand suitcases, shows the underlying dichotomy in the famous first couple. Jumping from historical event to historical event, the drama digs a bit deeper into the effects of the events on the family. By the time you've finished the movie, you felt like you've not only have a deeper understanding of the Civil War, but of the Lincolns as well.

Sam Waterson nails, absolutely nails, Lincoln. We see all sides of him. It must have been a daunting role to play. We have solely deified Lincoln, almost erasing his humanity. Waterson brings it back in full force, with all the humor and sadness needed. At first, hearing that Mary Tyler Moore as Mary Todd Lincoln seems like a joke. Who would ever thought that Mary Richards could play someone Hay and Nicolette called ""Hell Cat?"". But she does. Her decent into madness at the death of Willie is heartbreaking. Richard Mulligan's performance as Sweard is canny, and the ever stalwart Ruby Dee plays Mary Lincoln's dressmaker Mrs. Keckley with all of the sassiness and care required.

I rated this movie four stars, not for content or for acting, but for the DVD transfer. It's simply on the verge of being terrible. The picture quality lacks any quality at all. It appears fuzzy and smoky on my screen quite a bit. As for any special features, forget it. This wasn't ever enough to detract from my enjoyment in watching the show, but this DVD looks like a hack job for sure.

However, Gore Vidal's Lincoln deserves a place in my video library as an interesting examination of a well-known time; well-acted, and tells a great story. I recommend this to anyone wanting an insider's look of a fascinating man and family.",1172275200,27,2316,4.840909090909091
2067993,5,B00028G75C,"Gore Vidal presents the noble yet tragic figure of Abraham Lincoln in a very accurate fashion.  Being a professor of history, I appreciate the realism in Vidal's presentation of both the people and events in the story.  The struggles Lincoln faced as a politician, president, husband and father are well-developed by Vidal through his dramatic writing.  The viewer comes to feel a sense of identity with Lincoln, who is portrayed not only as a great man in history, but also as a man much like you and I might associate with in our everyday lives.  While staying fairly true to the historic Lincoln and events of the time, the film's dramatic presentation keep the interests of the viewer who might not necessarily be a history buff.  The high quality of Vidal's work actually encourages the viewer to take a further look into other historic representations on film, from which there are many to choose.",1168300800,10,903,4.837662337662338

2067995,5,B00028G75C,"I am so thankful I ignored the negative reviews!!

I loved this mini-series on tv and recorded it on vhs at ep!!!  What was I thinking? How to save tape??

I was thrilled to find out it was finally on dvd.  But when I read how badly the lighting, sound, etc. was, I was doing some rethinking.

Then I thought again.  If I enjoyed watching my horrible copy on vhs over and over again, the dvd couldn't possible be any worse.  So I did order.

And I'm glad I did.  The dvd far exceeds my badly taped vhs version.  The movie is enjoyable, factual, and unforgettable.  Lincoln fans MUST get this dvd!",1106956800,28,596,4.232142857142857
2067996,4,B00028G75C,"But, more historically correct.  Lincoln was a politician.  He never set out to free the slaves.  He actually offered leading free Blacks the opportunity to take the slaves to a new American colony in South America because he never thought ex-slaves would have a chance.  There was corruption in his Administration.  First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln probably sold the text of the ""State of the Union"" address to the New York Times. She also kept 'ghost' employees on the White House payroll to pay for her extravagances in remodeling.

Still, Lincoln was a good man and a good leader, grieved at the state of America.  Sam Waterson depicts a man heavily laden with the burdens of a country, constituency, and family that could be enough to break a lesser person's resolve.

Mary Tyler Moore's performance as Mary Todd Lincoln was also good.  No one will ever know whether it was mental illness, addiction to morphine, or some other cause that drove her to 'headaches' and spendthrift behavior.  Tyler Moore's presentation was of Todd-Lincoln was troubled---and human.

My big complaint about this DVD was the film quality.  This looked like a low budget film that was not digitially remastered for DVD.  Pity, because this is an excellent depiction of the times and one of our American heroes.",1104710400,110,1289,4.912037037037037
2067997,3,B00028G75C,"Though made drearily for television, this film has a number of elements that is ahead of its time. Sam Waterston's savvy, almost hippie-like Lincoln is not at all the ""great ape"" that many of Lincoln's detractors claimed. He is like the true Abraham Lincoln. With the high-pitched Kentucky squeak in his voice (like Lincoln), Waterston is simply riveting- as Lincoln himself must have been. His terrible screech of pain during the height of the Civil War is something I had always imagined he did several times. Waterston hypnotizes with this Emmy-worthy portrayal. The facts in the film are blurry at times, the direction is plodding, the lighting is too dark- and Mary Tyler Moore as Mary Todd Lincoln must be the casting blunder of the 20th century. Yet all involved give terrific performances. Too bad there wasn't more LINCOLN to this ""Lincoln"". But all in all, it is the must-see for any interested viewer.",1088467200,23,912,4.928571428571429
2067998,4,B00028G75C,"Sam Waterston is a very different Lincoln than the stately, orthodox one of Raymond Massey or even Henry Fonda.  This Lincoln is clever, scheming, cynically funny and nakedly ambitious--one who might have a thing or two in  common with some well known politicians of the 20th century.  You could  even call Waterston the first urban Lincoln, under the rail-splitting  pretentions.  But Waterston never loses sight of Lincoln's tortured, proud  but guilt-ridden greatness, and that is the secret of his fine portrayal.",960854400,111,517,5.308641975308642

2068017,3,B00028G75C,"Obviously these two films where combined as a double-feature because one of them was a bit better than the other.  Of this double-feature-DVD (1 disc) I found ""The Colt"" more interesting than ""Lincoln.""  Sam Waterston"" was miscast as Lincoln, being much younger than one expects after seeing period photographs of the great man.  The plot moves too fast leaving the viewer, who is unknowledgable about Civil War history, to fill in the gaps.  I already know knew of Lincoln's disappointment over General McClellan's refusal to attack the Confederate army just across the Potomac River, but I do not believe that Lincoln showed such loss of emotional control over this problem.  Nor did I know that Lincoln kowtowed to General McClellan by actually going over to his house to discuss the matter with him.  That made Lincoln's character in this film appear to be a weak politician.  The film just seemed too tedious and almost plotless to bother watching it.

""The Colt"" on the other hand, based on a short story, did have a very good plot.  It wasn't predictable and the ending was not expected, sad as it was.  I found the several encounters in skirmishes between the military squads a bit doubtful.  And the conflict between them a bit too restrained.  But it was a good film for its entertainment value.",1427673600,,1305,4.828828828828829

In some ways, it is a typical TV movie in terms of pacing, special effects, etc.  But it's still a nice story and covers some aspect of the Lincoln's' lives that aren't usually done: like their grief at a son's death, Mary's near insanity, Lincoln's depression...

2068050,3,B00028G75C,"Sam Waterston is so well know as an actor in Law and Order that it was a bit disconcerting to see him in a more serious role, one which made LIncoln seem like a bit of a bufoon at times. I couldn't take Mary Tyler Moore seriously either. Lincoln was a truly great man, but for me, this didn't come across in either of the roles played by these two actors.",1378684800,,355,4.014084507042254
2068051,5,B00028G75C,"I watched this (again) a couple of years ago after finding it in the DVD discount bin and enjoyed it muchly. I'm a big Sam Waterson fan so I was quite pleased, but I was also surprised at what a fantastic job Gore Vidal had done with the story line and dialogue.

That is what I liked the most. The dialogue just seemed to flow as if it was natural. It wasn't contrived to seem like a Shakespearean play, nor was it so authentic and larded with historical idiom that it was impossible to understand.

Of course, what I'm hinting at is a comparison with Spielberg's more recent movie, which I found quite boring. I think you'll enjoy this movie much more because the vibrant performance by Sam Waterson (it is not all gravitas.) Mary Tyler Moore is great as Mary Todd and Richard Mulligan's acting is perfect and he does a much more sympathetic job of showing why Lincoln's rivals became his allies and dear friends.",1377302400,,915,4.473053892215569

More impressed with Sam Waterston's Lincoln and the film itself was well done and covered more on his life as well.
Had to fast forward some of Mary Tyler Moore's rants though I know Lincoln's wife had mental health issues so I can understand both female actors were right for their roles and played their character to the hilt.
.There were many films of this president to choose from and I was pleased with my decision and would recommend this DVD as worthy viewing because it was well done and not prejudicied as it was in the recent movie version.

I saw it a few years ago on cable and remembered the colors were more vibrant than on this disc.  On the DVD, there were obvious imperfections from the original film such as a dark green or brown tint that is evident throughout the film.  My guess is that the company who produced the DVDs did not want to go to the time or expense to correct the color which would have been costly.

Nonetheless, it's still a great film and I give it five stars for the performances of all the actors and the story.  It was super cheap when I purchased it along with another Lincoln film.",1366070400,,726,4.22463768115942

I really like Sam Waterston's Lincoln, and even Mary Tyler Moore as Mary Todd Lincoln. Along with Lincoln's rise to the WH and the war, this version shows Mary's relationship with Elizabeth Keckley who was the free black woman seamstress. Also shows more Robert Lincoln and his friendship with the President's assistant/secretary John Nicolay, In this Lincoln movie, we see more deeply into Mary Todd personality. A different portrayal of Mary than the Sandburg's Lincoln. I found Mary Tyler Moore's version to be a manipulating, and a ""always on the verge of something"" woman. Times may change, but people in general do not as we see scandal, backbiting and wrong assumptions about people in politics even then.

2068076,4,B00028G75C,"Unlike Steven Spielberg's recent film, LINCOLN (1988) refuses to hero-worship its protagonist.  As portrayed by Sam Waterson, he comes across as a ruthlessly determined character prepared to go to any lengths to ensure victory in the Civil War.  He is well aware of the necessity for political deals, in which ethics play little or no part; but he manages these deals with aplomb.  At the same time Waterson's Lincoln remains a tortured soul; someone who understands how his lifelong commitment to politics means that he neglects his family.  He considers himself wholly responsible for his wife Molly's (Mary Tyler Moore's) mental difficulties, that have to be hushed up in the interests of political expediency.

As we might expect from Gore Vidal, the focus of this miniseries is less on Abolition and more on the grimy day-to-day realities of American politics, in which friendship and loyalty count for little. Lincoln's rivals, notably Seward (Richard Mulligan) are portrayed as self-interested and rapacious, perpetually ready to put themselves above the national interest.  Hence it comes as no surprise to find that Lincoln understands the frailties of his position: anyone could assassinate him at any time. However Vidal makes it clear that individuals have to negotiate their position in history in the best way they can; it is to Lincoln's eternal credit that he achieved this task, even at the cost of his life.

This three-hour long series has its longueurs (the use of shot-reverse-shot sequences becomes irritating after a while), but is redeemed by convincing performances and an intelligent script.",1362960000,,1617,5.2684824902723735

Robin Gammell and Richard Mulligan are outstanding as Douglas and Seward, respectively.",1361059200,,466,5.8088235294117645
2068078,4,B00028G75C,"Unilke other ECHO BRIDGE/PLATINUM DISC products, this Civil War era costumer doesn't have a distracting on-screen company logo.

Gore Vidal's LINCOLN  is the full 3-plus hour made-for-TV minseries. Audio is clear and video has a look similar to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/O-BROTHER-WHERE-ART-THOU/dp/B00003CXRM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?</a>&nbsp;(2000), with a color spectrum skewed toward shades of brown and no vibrant primary colors. As there's a deterioration disclaimer before the main menu, this antique effect is probably unintentional.

A limited production budget has advantages and drawbacks. On the plus side, unnecessary digressions are eliminated. Case in point: no plot-stopping inaugural ball footage. To the negative: battle reenactments that, due to a small number of participants, barely rise beyond the level of skirmishes. The many insertions of stock footage in war sequences is obvious, as these flown-in scenes lack sharpness of focus. The film is not primarily about these clashes of arms, so such limitations are not ruinous, just noticeable. Not having Abe's personal assistant John Nicolay in the story however while John Hay is extensively featured is a curious choice of economizing.

The movie opens and closes with the modified lyrics version of Woody Guthrie's ""This Train is Bound For Glory"" over the beginning scene, a train arriving in Baltimore and at the end, while it bears away from Washington the martyred president's remains. In-between, the story of Abraham and Mary Lincoln is deftly scripted and capably served by stars Waterston and Moore.

Both are presented with human failings. Lincoln occasionally lashes out at subordinates when flustered or his sensibilities are insulted by them, but mostly he's mild and affable. Mary is more complex, a woman with many grudges and few friends, possibly manic-depressive, her spendthrift bursts place a tremendous financial burden on a husband already heavily laden with preserving the Union. To finance her impulsive buying sprees, Mary leaks information to the press for a price and more egregiously, commits fraud by collecting the salary of a deceased White House employee.

Those familiar with Lincoln's part in the Civil War will be pleased by the historical accuracy of this presentation. A supporting cast of familiar faces adds to the enjoyment. Highly recommended to all aficonados of costume drama and 19th Century American history.

2068081,4,B00028G75C,"I've been immersing myself in Lincoln books and movies and this miniseries from the 1980s was better than I expected. It includes most of the main characters and events from Vidal's book, which covers Lincoln's administrations and his family life, and I thought all of the actors did very good jobs, even Mary Tyler Moore. I assumed she was badly miscast but she turns in a riveting performance as the very messed up Mary Todd Lincoln. I thought Sam Waterston captured Lincoln's wiliness and wisdom and pain really well. The few times this Lincoln loses his cool are really jolting.

This TV movie is 3 hours long but I thought the script moved briskly forward. Unlike Spielberg's ""Lincoln,"" which was peopled with too many characters who were barely identified, this miniseries focused on the central players in Lincoln's administration like Seward and Chase, Chase's ambitious daughter Kate, Generals McClellan and Grant, and Lincoln's steadfast secretary, John Hay. The story and characters seemed to be laid out more clearly. Even though it covers a longer period of time and more events than Spielberg's ""Lincoln,"" it seemed more tightly structured to me.

I can see why folks with great home movie set-ups would be disappointed with its visual and sound quality. The transfer is a little muddy and it is not in the widescreen format we've all grown accustomed to. But, hey, it's a 1988 TV production and it's only $5! I couldn't tell whether the production's color was washed out because of the bad transfer or because it was intentionally shot through some sepia-toned lens. I prefer to think the latter is the case because, whether intentional or not, the sepia tone added to the historical feel of the piece. I recommend this ""Lincoln.""",1358812800,6,1745,4.952218430034129

The script was sensitive to the fact that his wife was fragile or mentally unstable. Other books and movies have, I believe, treated her unfairly. The personal story was interwoven along with politics and war, as it happened, rather than treating each independently. Lincoln didn't have the luxury of stopping his work to be with his wife when she was in crisis. He had to continue his work through personal tragedy as well in the death of his son.

Even though our world has changed dramatically, the story shows just how much still remains the same.

The actors were believable. I particularly enjoyed the ""younger"" presentation of Lincoln. He is usually represented as looking older than he really was. When they focused on his face, it was almost as if we could feel what he was feeling. All-in-all, the series was well done.

The script and direction fail to achieve the intimacy with the characters that made the novel so engrossing. Each sequence seems more a set piece and an opportunity to get the facts rights, thus scene after scene makes a statement or presents a situation, but the whole lacks the sense of urgency that drove the characters to their tragic ends. The book deserves remaking. Surely, Abe and Mary Lincoln were not John and Abigail [Adams], but there must have been more to their story than self-centered madness on her part and bemused, patient tolerance and forbearance on his. Fine actors all, the members of the cast, as always, are captives of the script and subjects of the director, so it would be inappropriate to comment beyond saying that the principle characters failed to rise above the limits of the script and rarely escaped the control of the director.

To say the acting is largely wooden would be to give the lumber industry an undeserved slur. I have watched many a High School play conducted with greater craft and better skill than this sad thing. The set might have been a rented room in a badly managed local motel...draped with ponderously boring tapestries and furnished out of the local thrift stores.

First of all, it's not anamporphic (odd, since it was filmed for TV), and the print is so faded as to be almost indistinct at times (you would have thought that it was made in 1938 instead of 1988).

2068109,4,B00028G75C,"Unilke other ECHO BRIDGE/PLATINUM DISC products, this Civil War double feature doesn't have a distracting  on-screen company logo.

THE COLT is a nice extra, an award-winning family film that centers on the common soldier, in this case, men of the 1st Michigan regiment. Amidst the horrors of war and violence that claims one private's brother, his mare gives birth. Jim disobeys an order to destroy the foal and it becomes a mascot for his unit, and more than that: the colt is a symbol of hope and renewal in the face of so much destruction. A cast of unknowns do a fine job in this feel-good TV movie. (Note: a traumatic finale may not be suitable for the very young.)

Gore Vidal's LINCOLN  is the full 3-plus hour made-for-TV movie. Audio is clear and video has a look similar to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/O-BROTHER-WHERE-ART-THOU/dp/B00003CXRM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?</a>&nbsp;(2000), with a color spectrum skewed toward shades of brown and no vibrant primary colors. As there's a deterioration disclaimer before the main menu, this antique effect is probably unintentional.

A limited production budget has advantages and drawbacks. On the plus side, unnecessary digressions are eliminated. Case in point: no plot-stopping inaugural ball footage. To the negative: battle reenactments that, due to a small number of participants, barely rise beyond the level of skirmishes. The many insertions of stock footage in war sequences is obvious, as these flown-in scenes lack sharpness of focus. The film is not primarily about these clashes of arms, so such limitations are not ruinous, just noticeable. Not having Abe's personal assistant John Nicolay in the story however while John Hay is extensively featured is a curious choice of economizing.

The movie opens and closes with the modified lyrics version of Woody Guthrie's ""This Train is Bound For Glory"" over the beginning scene, a train arriving in Baltimore and at the end, while it bears away from Washington the martyred president's remains. In-between, the story of Abraham and Mary Lincoln is deftly scripted and capably served by stars Waterston and Moore.

Both are presented with human failings. Lincoln occasionally lashes out at subordinates when flustered or his sensibilities are insulted by them, but mostly he's mild and affable. Mary is more complex, a woman with many grudges and few friends, possibly manic-depressive, her spendthrift bursts place a tremendous financial burden on a husband already heavily laden with preserving the Union. To finance her impulsive buying sprees, Mary leaks information to the press for a price and more egregiously, commits fraud by collecting the salary of a deceased White House employee.

Those familiar with Lincoln's part in the Civil War will be pleased by the historical accuracy of this presentation. A supporting cast of familiar faces adds to the enjoyment. Highly recommended to all aficonados of costume drama and 19th Century American history.

2068114,4,B00028G75C,"Waterston does a great job portraying Lincoln not as an Icon, but as a human being.  It is the best portrayal I have ever seen of Lincoln on the screen and quite faithful to the original novel by Gore Vidal.  You feel Lincoln's sense of purpose, his ability to read people and manipulate them in accordance with it, and his emotional life.  It is subtle, at times shocking, but always engaging.

The viewer also gets a good glance at the major events of the Civil War in outline, in just about enough detail for the casual viewer:  the suspension of Habeas Corpus in Maryland, the stodgy Union Generals, the important battles, the human toll.  It is all bound with Lincoln's political purpose, to save the Union at any cost, and stimulates the appetite for more.  It covers Lincoln's difficult relationship with the notorious popinjay McClellan, the deterioration of Mary Todd Lincoln (I did not like Mary Tyler Moore much in the role), and the tensions within the cabinet.  The gravelly Ulysses Grant is also excellent.

That being said, it was impossible to get all the nuance of Vidal's novel (his finest by far) into 3 hours.  You get allusions to the themes, but cannot experience such things as the deep conversion of Seward from a scornful enemy to devoted friend, the love of John Hay for the exploited Kate Chase, or Linclon's shrewd maneuverings around the power-hungry Salmon P. Chase.  If you liked the film, you should definitely read the book.  Finally, for Civil War buffs, there really isn't enough detail to satisfy the most sophisticated appetite, however successful this is as entertainment.

To anyone who might be thinking this is a Civil War film, keep on moving.  This is the story of how Lincoln conducted the war while grieving for his lost son and a wife who was not in her right mind.

This would have earned five stars except for, as others have noted, the relatively poor quality of film for a DVD.  It looks like this movie was transferred from VCR to DVD by a novice.

Sam Watterson is dead on with the Lincoln of Gore Vidal's fine novel, and Mary Tyler Moore's Mrs. Lincoln is perfect.  I was amazed that this sitcom actress could be this good.  She deserved an academy award.

My only quibble is when snippets of battle were shown.  The movie would have been better without them.  Re-enactors were used, and re-enactors are always too old, too fat, too clean, and too self-conscious.  All one has to do is look at actual photos of Civil War soldiers in the field to prove the point.  And the battle scenes were inaccurate in other ways.  For example, the Confederates did not fire from behind a wooden fence at Fredericksburg, but from a sunken road and a stone wall.  At this same battle in the film we see trees in leaf, whereas the battle was in mid-December, and there was snow on the ground.

That aside, this is a fine piece of work, and even though the viewer knows how it ends, there is the sadness of a great tragedy.",1243036800,5,1078,4.4213197969543145

Distilling  nearly 700 pages of biographical detail into a three hour miniseries must have been daunting, but writer Ernest Kinoy was up to the task. It's hard to judge direction in a piece that's divided for commercial breaks, but under the hand of Lamont Johnson, the story remains cohesive. Casting Sam Waterston in the title role was a stroke of genius. Squint a bit, and you could be convinced he was Lincoln, lthough a surprisingly unwrinkled and unworn one. Waterston's Lincoln is fully human, down to high pitched, twangy quality of Lincoln's voice; he has turned in the most credible movie portrayal to date.  Most of the supporting cast was also outstanding, with the singular exception of Mary Tyler Moore. Thin to the point of gauntness, and rigid in her self control, MTM was the visual antithesis of the real Mary Lincoln, who was short, heavy set, and given to unforgettable displays of  temper and hysteria. While Moore's performance hints at the manic depression that destroyed Mrs. Lincoln's personality, and ultimately her life, she was badly miscast.

2068131,5,B00028G75C,"Gore Vidal's ""Lincoln"" presents, quite possibly, the most accurate depiction of Lincoln on film. Unlike previous films, this one shows that Lincoln did not become ""the Great Emancipator"" overnight; rather, his views on the issue of slavery and emancipation, and ultimately having colored troops enlisted, changed over the course of the four years of the American Civil War, and this film does a great job of showing these changing views.
While the film is not the best written, the flaws in the script are made up for by strong production values and, most importantly, terrific performances. Sam Waterston gives what is possibly the best performance as Lincoln on film, showing his humor, as well as his darker sides, and the sadness at the loss of a son. While the very beautiful Mary Tyler Moore doesn't look like the short, rather pudgy Mary Todd Lincoln, her performance is well-nuanced, showing both the tenderness and the slight insanity that she was believed to have. The supporting cast is very good, and the depictions of some of the battles, while not always accurate, bring a little excitement to this historical drama.
While the DVD doesn't present the best picture quality, the power of the program itself more than makes up for it. As an avid student of Civil War history, I found Gore Vidal's ""Lincoln"" to be as definitive a depiction of our Sixteenth President as has been produced, and I recommend it both to historians and those who enjoy great drama.

The movie moves along with great characters portraying such people as Seward, Chase, Gen. Winfield Scott (John Houseman was an excellent choice).  And of course Mary Tyler Moore as Mary Lincoln.  All in all, I have certain videos or movies that I can watch over and over again once a month or so.  I heard a interview of Sam Waterston regarding his portrayal of Lincoln and that he had to work at that ""Western"" accent as well as the high-pitched voice that describes Lincoln's speaking.  I recommend it to anyone.",1186099200,15,929,4.482142857142857

Hot Toasty Rag, November 4, 2017

I remember the massive hype for 2012s Lincoln, priming audiences and voters to give Daniel Day-Lewis another Oscar. The powers that be touted his performance, claiming no one had ever played Abraham Lincoln the way he had, and he was being realistic in his performance, speaking in a thin, rather high-pitched voice as Lincoln really did. They said watching the film was like seeing Lincoln peeled from a painting and come to life. Well, they clearly missed the television adaptation of Gore Vidals bestselling Lincoln, starring Sam Waterston as the nations most beloved president. In 2012, Daniel Day-Lewis just put on a beard. In 1988, Abraham Lincoln truly came to life.

I already love Sam Waterston and find him an incredibly talented actor, but if theres anyone out there who hasn't seen his movies, watching Lincoln will make you a life-long fan. His posture, mannerisms, walk, accent, and facial expressions are not his usual; its clear from the first scene Sam studied everything about the president to make his performance as authentic as possible. While Hal Holbrook wins the look-a-like contest in his beloved Lincoln portrayals in North and South and the 1970s miniseries Lincoln, Sam emits an aura that makes you forget about Hal for a while. When you're watching Sam, you believe he was raised in a log cabin. You believe hes Honest Abe.

In addition to the historically accurate tidbits included in Ernest Kinoys script, the production values of the film are wonderful. It doesnt feel at all like a 1980s tv movie. The costumes are beautiful, the production and art directions are extremely realistic, and the choice of using muted and dusty colors makes all the difference in the world. Usually, British movies have the market cornered on authentic lighting, but Joe Clayton, chief lighting technician for the film, did a fantastic job giving audiences a view of how things really looked during the Civil War.

Co-starring Mary Tyler Moore as the tragic figure Mary Todd Lincoln, Richard Mulligan as Secretary Seward, Steven Culp as Lincolns secretary, Ruby Dee as Marys dressmaker, David Leary as General McClellan, and John McMartin as Senator Chase, this three-hour tribute to Lincolns presidency is extremely entertaining. Lamont Johnson won an Emmy for his direction, and Mary and Ruby were nominated for their performances, as were the hairstylist, art directors, costume designers, and film as a whole. Sams performance was ignored, and when you watch the movie, youll be as stumped as I am. Pair it with Ken Burnss The Civil War for a reprise of Sam Waterstons role, or with A House Divided to see Sam in another Civil War drama, but playing a villain!",1509753600,,2729,5.004405286343612

His family has some loses and his wife appears to be somewhere between mentally ill and a traitor. The war gets hashed out with battle scenes (by re-enactors) and his staff as generals appear uninterested in battle.

After he is reelected he gets Grant to get after the rebels. Engaging, emotional ending.",1480032000,,446,4.868421052631579
