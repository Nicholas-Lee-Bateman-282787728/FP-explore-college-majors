3565837,5,B001F7AQDS,"Season Nine will probably be most fans least favorite, but being that I missed most of these episodes on CBS when they first ran, it made me enjoy the later seasons even more when I watched the re-runs.

If you are  true fan of the series, you will still like season Nine. There are many new characters, but the writing is still excellent.",1229040000,17,339,4.365079365079365

3565839,1,B001F7AQDS,"Be aware that the copy I received were flippers.  They put two discs onto one for each of the 3 discs in this set to save on production costs.  Flippers are notoriously cheap, hence why hardly anyone uses them anymore.  So, be sure to check your set when you get it.  If it's flippers, be sure to scan through all the contents of each side to make sure the disc can play.  Flippers are notorious for arriving damaged in the mail and, because they are cheap, for sides that simply will not play shipped right out of the factory.

Also be aware that Side B of Disc 3 was apparently intentionally left blank and unplayable.  The information on Amazon.com for this set says there are no special features.  So, there is the final episode of the series, The Revels, on Disc 3, Side A and apparently nothing on Side B since there are no special features listed.  WHY Warner Brothers insisted on making a flipper with nothing on Side B and simply not use a single layer DVD-9 for Disc 3 is a mystery.  As using a single sided DVD-9 would have saved production costs.  Anyway, the bottom line is if you can't get Side B of Disc 3 to play, it's probably because there was intentionally nothing put on that side.",1493251200,,1201,4.364864864864865

The children have grown and new demands have entered their lives and new sorrow has also entered the life of the Walton Family.  Good clean family entertainment, especially for those who love history and want to step back in history to a time when life was simpler and families stayed together and weathered the hardships of life.  I don't think divorce lawyers would have survived in those years because both men and women believed marriage was until death do you part.",1394150400,,606,4.742857142857143

3565925,3,B001F7AQDS,"The Waltons ended it's 9 year run after the 1980-1981 season. By this point, many of the show's long term fans were no longer tuning into the show. It's pretty obvious why.

Season 9 takes during 1945-1946. Japan surrenders in World War 2, thus ending the war. The Walton boys return home for good. Mary Ellen, now smitten with another man, gets news that she thought she'd never get about her ""dead"" husband. Olivia (no longer on the show) contracts tuberculosis so John leaves about halfway through this season to be with her, ending Ralph Waite's role. This means Rose Burton is now the only adult in the house, and the 7 children, now nearly all grown up.

The show ends on a rather dull note. The Waltons started out as a family show with all 11 main characters. By now, only 7 (the kids) remain. The show has transformed into a phenomenon where co-stars seem to get the most light. That ""family"" element the show had for so long is now gone and it seems the family has broken apart for good. Good night everybody.",1391126400,3,1019,4.473118279569892

It's like watching a real family from that time period with believable problems, good story lines, wonderful characters, plus a lot of humor.  I purchased the whole series over the years and now my collection is complete.  Whenever there is nothing good on TV, I can always pop in a Walton's episode and be taken back to a gentler, simpler time in life before I was even born!

Otherwise, we watched most all the other episodes - just use your own judgement...",1295568000,,550,4.288461538461538
3565967,4,B001F7AQDS,"This ninth and final season of the Waltons is a bit of a departure from the themes and values that made the previous eight seasons so wonderful to watch.  I break down the ninth season into two very distinct segments: the first 11 episodes are a definite departure from the traditional Waltons, and the final 11 episodes mark a return to the core values of the show.  Perhaps as the Waltons entered the decade of the 1980's the writers thought they needed more dramatic passion to hold or increase viewship.  Whatever the reason, these first eleven episodes are what I affectionately call ""The kissing and cussing Waltons"".  Truth be told, there is a whole lot of more passion, kissing, and even occasional swearing.  Even John Walton is heard to say ""He--"".  I still enjoy the episodes, but they are certainly different from what the Waltons earned their homespun family-values reputation on. A prime example of such episodes is ""The Pursuit"", where Jim-Bob is pursued by Kathy, a girl he dated once, who now claims (falsely) that she is carrying his baby.  Then there is ""The Tempest"" where Mary Ellen learns her husband, Curt, is still alive, and she goes to find out why he won't come home. This is perhaps the strangest episode of the entire nine years.  These are certainly different themes from what loyal viewers are used to; even the background music is different in these first eleven episodes.

The second half of season nine shows the return to typical Walton fare.  There are two wonderful episodes on the character of Stanley Perkins, Rose's flame, and these are thoughtfully and tastefully done.  ""The Beginning"" is the story of Jason's future wife, Toni, whose Jewish heritage presents a problem for the Walton family.  ""The Victims"" is a ""dark"" episode about troubled men returning from World War II.  ""The Lumberjack"" introduces Erin's flame and future husband, Paul Northridge.  The series ends with ""The Revel"", in which John-Boy returns to New York only to find himself in a career crisis, but ends in reassuring fashion, with hope of future restoration through family and friends.  During this season, the role of John-Boy is played by Robert Wightman.  Perhaps no one captures the essence of John-Boy as did Richard Thomas, but in my opinion, Mr. Wightman fills in Thomas' big hush puppies admirably. Actor Morgan Stevens adeptly and handsomely plays Paul Northridge, Erin's heartthrob.

Unfortunately, season nine sees the departure of Ralph Waite at mid-season.  John Walton leaves to tend to Olivia (Michael Learned), in Arizona.  Rose Burton, (Peggy Rea) leaves the show a few episodes shy of the end.  In the end, just the children, their spouses, and several new (grand)children remain at home.  While the show goes on and is still solid and entertaining, the loss of Mom and Dad Walton and Rose are definitely huge character losses for the series.

Season Nine is still very much an enjoyable season.  I give it 4 stars for the uneven nature of the first 11 episodes.

3565978,4,B001F7AQDS,"I liked watching this season after not having seen it for many years. It does continue the general tone and family struggles that were going on in the post war years for the Walton family. Since our family is experiencing the emptying nest, I can relate to this stage of the Waltons, and the changes that happen in this season are realistic for the most part. It was fun seeing the younger children grow up and become adults involved in adult relationships and issues.

However, I miss seeing Richard Thomas as John Boy, and it is not the same without John and Olivia, who are gone for most, if not all, of this season. Having Rose and her friend, Mr. Perkins playing major roles in some of the episodes helps fill the void left by John, Olivia and Grandma. There is also a different man playing Mary Ellen's husband, Curt, who is back miraculously from the dead which is a bit unbelievable and not a happy ending to their relationship.",1264464000,,936,4.5058823529411764
3565979,4,B001F7AQDS,"The ninth or last season of the Waltons held happy endings for some, but not for all of the people living on Waltons Mountain. Not everyone's dreams were fulfilled, but it ended with all of the characters, seemingly, accepting whatever life gave them so far.

  As usual, all is well with the Waltons, but be forewarned that the tenth episode called, ""The Tempest"" should have never been written.  The dead are always left better off dead and not brought back to life, especially in such a disagreeable way.  That part was played by a different actor who was not the same actor who had played the original part of the person who was mistaken to be dead. They had to hire a totally new actor just to present us with this unlikely and unnecessary episode. Even the reality of war could not justify such an unbelievable episode as this one was. Neither did it have a happy ending or even a happy followup in another episode.  It left me feeling sad and empty, unlike most of the other episodes that had given me so much comfort.

  The rest of this season was good, but it did not appear that this season was originally intended to end here.  I would have preferred that this last season had given us a better ending to the entire story.  That could have even been done by John Boy at the end of the last episode, but it was not.  In speaking about himself, he could have also added some more information about the rest of the family members in his very last words.

  In another one of the last episodes of this season, Rose and Stanley finally got married, but it never showed what happened with the rest of the Waltons.  Mary Ellen and Erin could have had a double wedding at the Baldwins house in the last episode (something a little more spectacular for a last episode than just an old people's reunion for the Baldwin ladies with the Waltons showing up).  Although it was implied that Elizabeth and Drew would someday be married, what about Jason, and Jim Bob? In one episode, Jason and his girlfriend overcame the obstacles they faced to getting married, yet the season left them unmarried, not dating and no explanation!

  Jason and Jim Bob probably never did fulfill their dreams of becoming a concert musician and an airplane pilot, and you're left wondering if they settled for what they were doing at the moment. Mary Ellen was left still studying to become a doctor and who knows how far Erin went in her career, as well.  That's reasonable, but did Olivia and John ever come home?  And what about Grandma? They finally did tell where she was, but it still leaves you with a lot of unanswered questions about her and everyone else.

  John Boy continued writing, of course, but they really should have done a tenth season to answer these questions about the other characters. Even if they could not do this on a practical basis, at the very least, they could have used the Special Feature at the end of the eighth season, known as ""A Decade of the Waltons"" for an ending here, where it really belonged, at the end of the nineth season (at the very end of the Walton's story). That would have given the ninth season and its viewers some closure, if not a really satisfying ending.

  Even with all of my complaints about it, I still love all of the Walton series, including this one, but this tells me one thing. -Endings are important and should be done right. I'd still recommend that you buy it because the only thing that you'll really be disappointed in, is that it all ends here.  Sadly, there is no more 'Waltons' and we'll never see anything this good in a television series ever again. I'm sure that we can all say 'Amen' to that.",1255737600,3,3649,4.478063540090772

3565982,4,B001F7AQDS,"The final season of The Waltons finds the family in the grasp of World War II's final year. Now, all four sons are in the Army, with Ben taken POW by the Japanese. Meanwhile, his wife Cindy is living with the clan, taking care of their baby Virginia and dreading news of his fate, while daughter Mary Ellen decides to pursue med school, and daughter Erin continues her job as office manager at the factory. Youngest daughter Elizabeth, long considered the baby of the clan, is turning into a young woman, preparing to finish high school and thinking about her own future.

Noticeably absent are Ellen Corby as Grandma (vaguely said to be off ""visiting"" all these long months) and Michael Learned as Mrs. Walton, said to be off at the VA hospital where she began volunteering when eldest son John-Boy came home gravely wounded. In reality, Learned had asked to be written off; yet on the show itself, her absence was poorly explained as the character continued to stay at the hospital long after John-Boy recovered and went back into the war -- missing numerous Walton special occasions such as youngest son Jim-Bob's high school graduation and all four boys marching off to war, occasions a mother certainly would not have missed, being a mere drive away.

All throughout this season, it's clear -- both to viewers and the Walton family -- that life as the family knows it is changing irrevocably.

Particularly memorable Season 9 episodes include the two-part ""The Outrage,"" where John struggles to clear the name of Harley, a black friend who was long ago charged with killing a white man; ""The Pursuit,"" when a obsessive girl arrives at the Walton home, claiming to be pregnant with Jim-Bob's baby; and ""The Last Ten Days,"" showing Ben's nightmarish experiences as a Japanese prisoner of war as the fighting begins to wind down, and the family is both optimistic about the war's end yet scared that Ben's angry captors might choose to kill him upon their defeat.

No matter the show's shortcomings, The Waltons was and is, throughout its long run, a classic series. True to life, each episode is full of life-testing situations, warmth, faith and humor -- it will long be remembered and missed by countless fans.",1250208000,2,2215,4.805774278215223

However, after reviewing season 9 DVD, I have to say that it is a disappointment. Season 9 has gotten away from the family themed show that dominated the previous 8 seasons. From Ike's infidelity, to Mary Ellen's presumed dead husband wanting nothing to do with her to the unmarried young lady claming Jim Bob is the father of her unborn child--season 9 seems to be an attempt by the producers, writers, etc.. to liberalize the show. The absence of Ralph Waite and Michael Learned for the majority of the season adds to the disappointment. The recasting of John Boy was poor.

The 9th season is an uneasy mix of edgy romance and working relationships crosscut with jarring scenes from WW II, where Ben is prisoner as Jason awaits a Pacific detail. Only when the war ends are we treated to the fine show it once was.

As a sentimentally unwelcome goodbye to the series, it all ends abruptly in a post war optimism fittingly enough just before the later rise of mass communications and television. Thereafter, the show lived on further to grace two decades of holiday movie specials. So the last season wasn't an unhappy ending for fans of domestic taste or America's 1st TV family. The best TV shows never die. They live on in DVD.

Anyone over 40 knows this exalted series, set in a epochal US of histrionic morals and gentle souls, represents a beloved vision of what this nation once was that is gone forever but not forgotten. Mature folks cling to its old fashioned sensibility to recall TV's golden age when primetime featured simple shows with down to earth plots real people could identify with. No wonder why this collection is a best seller.

Of its few flaws was Michael Learned's sketchy character Olivia, who in real life had hailed from Italian heritage missing on the show itself as guest star characterization inclusive of a rainbow of humanity left out or negatively portrayed olive skin. Then soon after the 4th season, the show slowly regressed into a hawkish glorification of wartime America. Go figure. Was the family stressfully hardened by a call to duty?

Be that as it may, for anyone who's an only child or from a broken home, this show is the ultimate TV surrogate family. Its old school message lends archaeological media insight into family values of yesteryear during hard times when bankers weren't bailed out of the Depression while Main St. suffered. No modern era TV program shares its values. At all. To this day. Since, TV has been a victim of ageism vs. old world ways.

Yet if a time capsule were to define the very earth salt of 20th century pop culture, media critics would be hard pressed to find a more iconic family TV favorite. New age generation gaps can't grasp the beauty of innocence, for it is a lost art. If heartland morality plays are old hat, then media's ability to appeal to the better instincts of our nature sadly belongs to the ages. Thus classic TV is of a civilized past tense quality.

When TV was young, it was fictionally scripted yet truer to life. Pride of goodness was a dramatic virtue unlike impromptu post modern reality game shows of prefab conflict and makeshift fame. To be a fan of TV from a time when the world was a better place is not to live in the past, but to be human. And that's why The Waltons' family legacy still endures as TV nostalgia's last best reminder of the good old days.",1241049600,5,2954,4.5852272727272725

3566023,5,B001F7AQDS,"The Waltons remains timeless.  Despite all the changes in this ninth season, the core storytelling remains intact.  I am so glad to have all nine seasons now on DVD.  I certainly hope the post-series movies are also releases, as some of the stories - like MaryEllen's remarriage - are completed in them.",1238630400,,303,4.788461538461538

3566025,5,B001F7AQDS,"I too am a huge fan of this show!  It's one of the few things I can have on when my kids are around!  I absolutely cannot wait for Season 9 to be released, and like the other reviewer said ""PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE release the movies to DVD!""  We want MORE!",1233705600,2,253,3.9215686274509802
3566026,4,B001F7AQDS,"I too want the movies from the 1980s and 1990s released, but it is a little disturbing that the cover art declares this to be ""The Final Season.""  That is technically accurate, but they may confuse consumers if they decide to also release the six TV movies later.  Episode 7, ""The Last Ten Days"" is reason enough to buy Season 9.  It brings 4 years of stories involving World War II to a fitting conclusion.",1232928000,3,407,4.4
3566027,4,B001F7AQDS,"The final season of The Waltons finds Michael Learned (Olivia Walton) no longer a cast member, while Robert Wightman has now officially joined the cast as John-Boy. Although this is the greatest weakness of the season, The Waltons still delivered intersting, and some exciting, episodes.

The season begins in the spring of 1945, and all the Walton men--save John--are fighting the war.  Ben is captured by the Japanese forces, Jason has to deal with the question of killing another man, and John-Boy (played by Robert Wightman) falls in love with a French girl.

Back at home, Mary Ellen discovers a need for a doctor on the mountain and is determined to become one, while facing a great deal of opposition. Ike and Corabeth are investigated by the rations board, and a new minister comes to the mountain.  Jim-Bob is frantic when a girl back home claims to have his baby, Cidny finds that she has been adopted, and the series ends with John-Boy going back to New York.

The following is an epidode list for this final season:

1. The Outrage (1)
2. The Outrage (2)
3. The Pledge
4. The Triumph
5. The Premonition
6. The Pursuit
7. The Last Ten Days
8. The Move
9. The Whirlwind
10. The Tempest
11. The Carousel
12. The Hot Rod
13. The Gold Watch
14. The Beginning
15. The Pearls
16. The Victims
17. The Threshold
18. The Indiscretion
19. The Heartache
20. The Lumberjack
21. The Hostage
22. The Revel

While the show ended in 1981, it would continue in 6 made-for-TV-movies from 1982-1997, moving from the characters from the forties and into the sixties.  In these TV movies, Richard Thomas returns as John-Boy and Michael Learned is back as Olivia, while Ellen Corby makes a few appearances as Grandma.  Hopefully, Warner Brothers will release these 6 TV movies, as it would be great to own the entire Walton legacy on DVD.",1232150400,103,1827,4.649068322981367

Had to the return the replacement as well, also happen at Walmart and Christian Books, until CBD stepped up the plate and checked all the discs and the case to make sure it was not broken prior to shipping out.  Came in perfectly intact. I realized during this last time to get this last season of the Waltons that Warner Brothers stopping producing them, and it picked up by Media Blue or some generic name.

8301200,4,B001F7AQDS,"This season focuses mostly on the kids...now adults.  The background music is weird.  Why they changed it is a mystery.  It is in keeping with the dilution of the series.  It's still a great series but mediocre in comparison to what it was in the first five years.  There are a couple of episodes which are downright terrible....the first is the episode where a girl claims she is carrying Jim Bob's baby.  Imagine a Walton having pre-marital sex????  Perish the thought!!!  Then the episode where Mary Ellen's deceased husband turns up alive and living in Florida???  I skip over this episode because it's so ludicrous.  What were the producer's thinking??  What was Earl Hamner thinking?  If they knew this was the last season they should have done everything possible to return the series to its former quality.  Just because a series ages and becomes more expensive to produce necessitating budget cuts, they still had some great writers who turned out some mediocre scripts.

The War Episodes are great!  Jon Walmsley is particularly good in these episodes.  Then we have ""faux John-Boy"".  Robert Wightman is extremely handsome and makes a respectable showing in a part that should never have been recast.  He's relegated to the background in too many episodes and is never really given the chance to shine.  If he had been given a chance maybe things would have been different.  At least we don't have to deal with the annoying grandchildren of Rose, who was introduced last season.

Ralph Waite as Papa John leaves mid season to be with Mama Olivia who has been admitted to a sanitarium in Arizona....a cop out excuse.  The last episode, ""The Revel"" is a remake from the first season episode where the Baldwin Sisters are planning a family reunion.  Oh, and one more thing....what is it with the girl's hairstyles from the late 70s and early 80s (a la Farrah Fawcett Feather Style) for the 40s time period????  Ridiculous.  All in all ""The Waltons"" at its worst is still 1000 percent better than the garbage of today's television.",1525824000,,2037,4.834782608695652
