8242533,5,B0011V7PU0,"This is a superb evenings entertainmentaccessible, informative and narrated by the exceptional British actor, Samuel West.  Three paintings are examined in three forty-five minute segments:

Rembrandts THE NIGHT WATCH

Vermeers THE ART OF PAINTING

Velazquezs THE ROKEBY VENUS

Art history necessarily includes the history of the broader culture in which the art is embedded.  THE NIGHT WATCH, e.g., is part of a Dutch genre of paintings featuring the members of the organization.  Painters were commissioned to portray the members and they received payment from each of the figures represented.  When we see other examples of the form we can see immediately why Rembrandts piece is the masterpiece.  Along with an examination of the painting itself we get the larger history of the work, including the steps taken to protect it during WWII.

With the Vermeer painting the issues are different, e.g., Vermeers struggles to support himself and his huge family and the question of whether or not he used a camera obscura and/or a chalk line in the process of composition.  With the Velazquez painting we receive an extended discussion of court culture, the inquisition and the history of the nude as subject matter.

Each mini-documentary includes commentary from experts.  Some of these are cleverly chosenPeter Greenaway, e.g., on the uses of light and Nicolas Roeg on the female form.  The commentary is uniformly lucid, sometimes earthy and consistently entertaining.

Anyone interested in the history of art will thoroughly enjoy this video.",1499558400,2,1544,5.322314049586777
8242534,5,B0011V7PU0,These are great! I think I have all of them. They are very well done and very entertaining. Not a bit dry or dull; I used them to peak the interest of my art students. They loved them and stayed engaged the entire length if each disc! Personally I love it when I get to read personal insights about the art works and the artists. These tapes do that and more. I especially enjoyed Michelangelo's David and Botticelli's Venus,1396224000,5,424,4.379746835443038
