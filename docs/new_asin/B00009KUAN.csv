7991083,1,B00009KUAN,"""Deviant Obsession"" is one of your standard erotic thriller where the main character, an attorney, works undercover at a strip club to help a client who's accused of murder.  While this case is being investigated, there is a plethora of sexual activity involving almost every character in the film.  For the erotic thiller fan, this is a must have.  It's a shame this version put out by MTI and Platinum is heavily edited of its all-important sexual content (I've seen the complete version aired on CineMax several years ago).  The viewer will see a little nudity and some caressing, but scenes are either cut away or cut out entirely when the sexual activity actually takes place.  You'll hear sounds consistent with two people engaged in (simulated) copulation; you just won't see it.  Thus it cuts the viewing time down from 85-90 minutes to a little over 70 minutes.

While this plotline has been duplicated many times in other erotic thrillers and dramas, especially in MRG-produced films, I've always gravitated towards erotic thrillers with serious plotlines (clearly it's a personal preference).  While the acting is suspect and no effort is really made in developing original plotlines, characters and dialogue, I like that the actors & actresses seem to really be making an effort at making a decent film.  Aficionados of erotic thrillers and dramas (affectionately known as ""SkineMax"" films) are willing to subject themselves to a suspect film when quality softcore sexual content and incredibly sexy people are involved.  ""Deviant Obsessions"" is one of my favorites.

The problem is this version put out by MTI and Platinum Disc: the movie is so heavily edited it's impossible to begin to accept it for what it's supposed to be: a well-rounded erotic thriller.  Let's face it: we watch films of this ilk for its sexual content; unfortunately this film has had much of it edited in such a way where what's going on is implied, not realized.  I bought this disk, and was sorely disappointed.  I would love to give this title a higher rating, but I can't give a high rating to a film that clearly is incomplete.  Purchase at your own risk.",1201564800,7,2148,4.911357340720222
7991084,4,B00009KUAN,"These erotic thrillers are usually pretty lame, the best parts inevitably being the sex scenes.  That was certainly the case with this film.  The best part was when a 30-something female lawyer goes undercover at a strip club, and one of the girls offers to show her how to give a lap dance!  She proceeds to remove her clothes and dance seductively for the slightly older woman.  It was excellent!  The film went downhill after that, but the one scene was definitely worth it!",1166140800,3,477,4.630952380952381
7991085,3,B00009KUAN,"Basically, this is a very so-so drama about a sexy redheaded female lawyer who goes undercover at a strip club to try and save her client from prison for a murder he didn't commit.

It was mostly forgettable, except for one scene where the lawyer is talking with one of the other girls at the strip club.  The girl is explaining to her how lap-dances are the best way to make the big bucks, and when the red-haired lady lawyer asks her to explain what exactly a lap-dance entails the pretty stripper says it would be easier to SHOW HER!  And so she then gives the female lawyer a very erotic lap-dance!  It was NICE!!!  The best part of his entire film!  In fact, the ONLY good part of this entire film!  If it wasn't for that one scene I'd rate this video a one-star as did the other reviewers.",1158451200,,795,4.26
7991086,1,B00009KUAN,"If you are just looking for some nice hot movies with Gabriella Hall in them, like I was, Do Not get this one.  Unluckily, she plays the jealous housewife, upon which she gets murdered at the begining of the movie, and has no nude scenes.  No wonder she wasn't part of the cover names, she was in the movie, like 2 minutes.
