7880556,4,6304963815,"We were living in Japan when the Detroit Tigers and St. Louis Cardinals played in the 1968 World Series. My mother and brother are Cardinal fans, so naturally I rooted for the Tigers. The games were carried on Armed Forces Radio live, which meant you had to get up in the middle of the night in Japan to hear the game. I listened to the first game, which the Cardinals won as Bob Gisbon fanned 17 Tigers in a five-hit shutout. I slept through Game 2, when Willie Horton, Norm Cash and Mickey Lolich homered to tie the series. I listened to the next two games as St. Louis beat up on the Tigers, shelling 30-game winner Denny McLain as Gibson's World Series win streak reached 7. So I noticed a pattern: I listen and the team I am rooting for loses. Consequently, I stopped listening to the game and the Tigers became one of the few teams to ever come back from a 3-1 deficit to win the series as Lolich won games 5 and 7 to earn Series MYP Honors, with McLain finally picking up a win! in Game 6 when the Tigers exploded for 10 runs in the 3rd inning. The really funny thing is I never got a thank you let alone a World Series ring from the Tigers. The nice thing is to finally see not only the games I listened to in the middle of the night way back when, but the four the Tigers won to grab the World Championship as well. This series featured future Hall of Famers Lou Brock and Al Kaline, as well as current baseball announcer Tim McCarver, whose 3-run blast gave St. Louis the lead in Game 3.",994204800,2,1497,4.165517241379311

In 1968, a rt handed shortstop who hit .230 against southpaws, and .061 against righthanders was called a MINOR LEAGUER. Forget the fact that Denny McClain won 31 games, this series featured a centerfielder (MIckey Stanley) playing shortstop! Mickey Lolich won 3 games for Detroit the last on 2 days rest. Pretty good for a guy who was right handed and taught himself to pitch with his left hand after a childhood injury. Mickey also hit his first career homerun in this series. Considering the fact that most of these guys had off-season jobs to pay the bills, now this was baseball. Two great teams, two great cities, playing a game out of love.  GET IT!!!!!",980985600,6,845,4.559210526315789
