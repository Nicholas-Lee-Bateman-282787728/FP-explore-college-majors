2683825,5,B000K7VHMI,"peter lorre and a great cast of character actors deliver the goods.  the plots are great and so is the mood of these films.  sure they may seem outdated by today's standards, but thats the trouble nowadays, we judge all old movies this way.  just sit back and enjoy.  the print quality and sound i found perfect.  the supplements were excellent.  i highly recommend the chan films also.",1173312000,4,386,4.602941176470588
2683826,4,B000K7VHMI,"With but one exception, all of these recent Chan/Moto restorations have been top notch. If you are a fan then you will find even more than what you may have been hoping for with these editions. That said, however, the print quality of Mr. Moto's Gamble is attrocious. It doesn't seem to be a case of stuck with the best available version that could be found. It literally looks as if no digital mastering has been done to it at all; the credits give away that tell-tale shaking that comes when something is projected. Later on, there are terrible tonal washes and distortions. All in all, none of these flaws are on any of the other Chans or Motos. Disappointing that one film seems to have slipped through the process but has been released anyway. On the whole, I still give these series presentations very high marks.",1173225600,,819,4.578231292517007
2683827,5,B000K7VHMI,"Anyone interested in these series, Mr. Moto, Mike Shayne, and Charlie Chan, should check out the book Realm of Unknowing by Mark Rudman (published by Wesleyan and also through Cahiers du Cinema International Writers on Film in French).  I discovered the book through Joyce Carol Oates Best 20th Century Essays, where she singles out Realm of Unknowing as one of the best nonfiction books written in the 20th century.  The poet's uncle Herbert I. Leeds directed ""Mr. Moto on Danger Island,"" four of the best Mike Shayne Films, ""Blue, White, and Perfect,"" ""The Man Who Wouldn't Die,"" ""Time to Kill,"" and ""Just off Broadway,"" along with ""Charlie Chan in the City of Darkness.""  The story Rudman tells about his uncle is harrowing, cautionary, and compelling.  And he reads the films for signs of his uncle's fate.",1171929600,3,810,4.9338235294117645
2683828,5,B000K7VHMI,"Volume 2 of Fox's Mr. Moto series has finally been released, and after years of viewing battered second-generation prints, the results are little short of breathtaking.  I almost think that the films didn't even look this good in original release.  Two of the films in this set, MR. MOTO'S GAMBLE and MR. MOTO IN DANGER ISLAND, have always been among my favorites in the series, and to see them in such pristine shape almost brought a tear to my eye.  The set also includes some very informative featurettes, as well as the trailers for five of the eight films.  Considering the fact that Fox waited for so long to release this series on video (remember, with the exception of one film, MR. MOTO'S LAST WARNING, they never even made it out on VHS), the fact that the whole series is now availible and been treated with such loving care is a cause for celebration.  As with the first volume, this is highly recommened.",1171411200,75,917,4.601226993865031
2683829,5,B000K7VHMI,"A must for Peter Lorre fans -- the 2nd and final 4-disc box set of Mr Moto films with Peter Lorre as the Japanese secret agent. Compared with the Volume 1 set, the films here are generally weaker in quality in their story lines although I would suspect that the quality of the prints to be excellent.

""Mr Moto's Gamble"" was actually intended to be a Charlie Chan film, ""Charlie Chan at the Ringside."" However, Warner Oland, who played Charlie Chan, walked off the set one day during its production to visit his mother in Sweden and died there. Much of the film, with Keye Luke as Chan's

Number One son Lee and ex-fighter Max 'Slapsie Maxie' Rosenbloom, was salvaged and reworked as the new Mr. Moto film.

""Mr Moto's Last Warning"" has a brief reference to Warner Oland and the film ""Charlie Chan in Honoloulu"" although it was Sidney Toler who stared in this film (his first Chan film) following Oland's death. This is probably a hidden tribute to Oland and the film he would have made if he were still alive.

Also included is the 1965 film bomb ""Return of Mr Moto"" with Henry Silva.

It is also anticipated that there will be several interesting featurettes, or documentary extras, as there were in Volume 1.

On the subject of questionable politically incorrect, insensitive, depiction of a Japanese character (Moto); I have to say that the role is of an honorable, lawful person of high integrity. Yes the there is an exaggerated impression of Japanese accent & customs, which was unfortunately common in the era of these films.

2683906,5,B000K7VHMI,"The last of the Mr Moto serial. Peter Lorre, by this time, was very restricted for any physical activity so these are more a thinking man's mystery. In fact Mr Moto's Gamble is a revamped Charlie Chan script that has a bundle of inside joke to the fact. It even has No 1 son Keye Luke in practically the same roll.

As an extra, the rare ""Return Of Mr Moto"" is included with a commentary by Henry Silva. It also has more featurettes' about the history of Moto, in print and movies. Very informative.

Picture quality is up and down. But you have to remember these were cranked out as well as other Matinee serials like Buck Rogers and the Green Hornet so they were never given the budget and care as ""A"" movies like Gone With The Wind.

Unlike other movies I have fondly remembered and have been bitterly disappointed when revisiting, Mr Moto lived up to my expectation and is a proud member of my collection.",1400025600,,909,4.398809523809524

This is a really terrific collection with ""Mr. Moto's Last Warning"" being a particular treat with Ricardo Cortez, George Sanders, and John Carradine in the cast.  There are some really fascinating special features on each of these discs that run about 15 - 20 minutes and I was especially appreciative of the one associated with ""Mr. Moto's Gamble"" involving the late, great Warner Oland.  Also, the full length ""The Return of Mr. Moto"" with Henry Silva in the role is included as a Special Feature.

2683942,4,B000K7VHMI,"Created by author John P. Marquand as a replacement for Charlie Chan in the pages of the Saturday Evening Post after the death of author Earl Derr Biggers, Mr. Moto's screen incarnations have suffered a similar fate to that of his honorable predecessor. Rarely revived on television because of worries over political correctness - though as with Chan, Moto is always way ahead of the white characters - and long consigned to poor quality public domain video and DVD releases, Fox's lovingly restored second Region 1 NTSC boxed set finally allows a new generation the chance to see him in focus again. As with Volume One, the set follows neither production or release order exactly, though it does complete the series with four more Lorre films that saw the series moving closer to Charlie Chan territory and the much-disliked one-off attempt to revive the series in 1965 with Henry Silva. Overall it's a blander, less mysterious and much less ruthless Moto than the earlier films, but there's still a lot of entertainment to be had even if two of the five films here are distinctly below par.

The third film in the series to be released but the fourth to be produced, Mr. Moto's Gamble stars Peter Lorre as Charlie Chan - well, more or less. Originally intended as a Charlie Chan film with only minimal rewrites to accommodate the change of main character, who loses almost all of his original characteristics and darker edges to become a benign and bemused figure rather than a mysterious and deadly one. It even teams him up with Chan's Number One son Keye Luke, who is given a comic sidekick of his own in Slapsie Maxie Rosenbloom's punch-drunk kleptomaniac would-be detective. (Furthering the connections, Harold Huber returns as the same character he played in Charlie Chan On Broadway.) Warner Oland may have disliked it, walking out on the picture twice in its original incarnation due to his mounting personal problems, but it's a pretty good yarn revolving around a death in the boxing ring, poisoned gloves and dubious big bets on long shots that remains very much a Chan film: where in the earlier films, Moto disguised himself, here you get the impression that Moto himself is just a disguise for Chan. There's virtually no action, plenty of aphorisms and none of the atmosphere of mystery and moral uncertainty, let along the distinctive look that director Norman Foster established with the earlier films, with Chan director James Tinling delivering a blander kind of studio professionalism. Ward Bond and Lon Chaney Jr. turn up among the supporting players, as do not one but two Perry Whites for the price of one - John Hamilton from the 50s Superman TV series and Pierre Watkin from the Columbia movie serials.

The DVD includes a featurette on the picture's progress from Charlie Chan at the Ringside to Mr. Moto's Gamble, dispelling a few myths along the way.

Mr. Moto's Last Warning is more of a spy story than a thriller, seeing him in Cairo trying to find out just how ventriloquist Ricardo Cortez and his gang, George Sanders and and a dapper John Carradine among them, plan to set Britain and France against each other during forthcoming naval manoeuvres in the Suez Canal. It's another handsomely produced entry in the series - a Fox B-movie could look better than a Universal A-movie - with our hero indulging his penchant for disguises, playing down to western prejudices to throw white characters off their balance and, when that fails, the odd bit of judo, though the stunt doubling is a lot more noticeable this time round. He also manages to get a couple of associates and allies needlessly killed (Moto actively preventing one from removing incriminating evidence that leads to his murder owes more to particularly clumsy writing than logic), though he seems a bit more bothered by this than he would have been at the series' start. Robert Coote's silly ass travel writer is also along for comic relief, spending much of the film looking like Harold Lloyd in a sailor suit, though he's often a welcome presence rather than a distraction even if his role is largely unnecessary beyond fulfilling the need to give our hero someone to rescue that's usually reserved for a damsel in distress. The film is rather let down by its weak and rather cheap looking ending but there's a nice little tribute to the then-recently departed Charlie Chan star Warner Oland on the playbill at the local cinema.

The DVD also includes a featurette on Mr. Moto's creator John P. Marquand, as well as the original trailer for this and several of the other films in the series.

Danger Island was the last of the Fox Mr. Moto's to be filmed, although not the last to be released, and it's clear that Fox were losing confidence in the series. The seventh film, Mr. Moto takes a Vacation, had been pushed back after previewing badly and it's obvious that the studio downgraded the budget on this entry accordingly - this is the first film in the series to really look like a B-movie. It's also very clear that, like Mr. Moto's Gamble, this was originally intended as a Charlie Chan film. This time the discarded script, Charlie Chan in Trinidad, has been given much more of a rewrite to play to some of Moto's strengths and incorporate more physical action that you could never imagine Warner Oland or Sidney Toler indulging in, but while it allows Lorre some impish black humor it makes him a much more benign and less mysterious figure - no hidden agenda or ruthless killing here, nor any disguises for that matter. It also follows on from Gamble's lead by giving him a comic sidekick, with Warren Hymer's amiable luggish wrestler, who tags along because he thinks being a `defective' will `break the monopoly,' clearly modelled on Slapsie Maxie Rosenbloom's punchdrunk boxer in the earlier film.

Yet if it's more Chan than Moto, it's still a rather enjoyable if undemanding yarn, with Moto in Puerto Rico on the trail of diamond smugglers and faced with no shortage of sinister types with their own agendas, from the obviously devious Douglas Dumbrille to the more suspiciously benign Jean Hersholt via the officiously professional Leon Ames, as well as the odd attempt on his life by machinegun and bathtub. Lorre may have tired of the constraints of the series offscreen, but onscreen he seems to be genuinely enjoying himself while Hymer is a surprisingly endearing foil (in a part filled with the much of the same kind of wordplay that would later be given to Mantan Moreland in the later Sidney Toler Charlie Chan films and used as evidence of that series' alleged racism). Looking at the easy onscreen chemistry between them it's hard to believe that at the time Lorre was battling morphine addiction and Hymer's drinking problems would soon bring his career and, indeed his life to an early end. In many ways it's almost as if Hymer and Ward Bond, who appears unbilled as another wrestler in the opening scene, swapped careers, with Hymer disappearing into unbilled bit parts and Bond graduating to character roles.

The DVD includes a good featurette on the character of Moto and his evolution and journey from page to screen as well original trailers for several of the other films in the series.

When Mr. Moto Takes a Vacation was finally released, it marked the end of the Lorre series. Profits were way down, Lorre was increasingly unhappy with the films and anti-Japanese sentiment in America sealed its fate long before the attack on Pearl Harbor. Sadly it's hard to argue with the critics and preview audiences whose bad response led to this being shelved for nine months until Danger Island (which reuses a couple of minor elements from the plot and also briefly featured an unbilled Willie Best) was released: while Norman Foster's direction is often atmospheric and the production values are impressive, even at 63 minutes this gets to be a chore with its emphasis on the comic relief over the plot and nominal main character. Moto doesn't get to do a great deal this time out, with far too much of the screen time being given instead to the exponentially tiresome George P. Huntley Jr. as a silly ass Englishman. First introduced in fancy dress blackface sitting next to a Hungarian actor playing a Japanese detective in an image that will have the politically correct spitting their coffee across the room, he's clearly intended to be a likeable idiot along the lines of Robert Coote in Mr. Moto's Last Warning but simply comes across as a deeply irritating little tit you keep on hoping forlornly will get killed. Unfortunately, though so many of those innocents who crossed Moto's path did just that in earlier films, he leads a depressingly charmed life. Even a better actor would have had trouble making a character this idiotic play, but Huntley is just hopeless.

The plot itself is serviceable, with Moto hired to protect the newly discovered crown of the Queen of Sheba in the hope of finally catching a presumed dead master criminal and master of disguise who wants to steal it (somewhat bizarrely, Moto is actually hired before anyone discovers anything to protect!). Complicating matters is the fact that several other competing gangs of crooks are after it too, and most of them want Moto dead. Among the suspects are Lionel Atwill's museum director with a thing for snappy ties and hep talk in the delusion they make him look younger (""What a great big zany I am!""), Joseph Schildkraut's cantankerous donor who looks uncannily like Harold Gould and the usual thinly developed romantic leads and red herrings. On the plus side Charles Clarke's cinematography is excellent as is Bernard Herzbrun and Haldane Douglas' design and there's a rather neat bit of stuntwork in an escape over several rooftops, but you can't help feeling they're wasted, in no small part due to Huntley's unwelcome and persistant presence.

The DVD includes an interesting and enlightening featurette on America's and Japan's troubled relationship from the time American gunboats forcibly opened it for trade and set in motion the events that would lead to an increasingly militaristic Japan seeking an empire of its own, with writer Bruce C. McKenna giving a good overview of how this affected the portrayal of Mr. Moto. While it skirts over the contradiction of both the cinematic and literary Moto meeting their demise because they were seen as pro-Japanese only for the series to be later accused of anti-Japanese racial stereotyping, it does touch on the reasons than Moto was completely written out of Fox's 1957 adaptation of the Moto novel Stopover Tokyo (not included in this set but available separately) and the way his race became irrelevant in the 1965 quickie The Return of Mr. Moto. The latter is included as an extra, complete with commentary by star Henry Silva, and it's not surprising that it didn't spawn a new series.

The character can be seen as a kind of proto-James Bond, so it's not altogether surprising that that's the approach this quickie took - even the trailer emphasised the double `O's in his name. It also refers to him as `The swinging Chinese cat with nine hundred lives,"" although the film is much vaguer about his origins: referred to a couple of times as an `Oriental,' he has to disguise himself to pass as Japanese. But far from seeing the return of Marquand or Lorre's detective, this is just a guy called Moto going mechanically through the motions of the kind of low budget plot where most of the action takes place offscreen because it's so much cheaper to film people talking instead. After one rooftop action scene and a half-hearted attempt to run him over, when he's tied up in a weighted sack and thrown in the Thames the film doesn't even bother to show his escape, simply cutting to him sitting in his office in a dripping wet suit.

Like many British quota quickies made fast and cheap to play on the second half of double bills to fulfil UK cinemas then legal requirement to show a certain number of British films a year, it simply uses a once popular but now affordable screen character's name (here changed from Kentaro Moto to I.A. Moto for some reason) and an equally affordable American supporting player to get enough bookings to make a return on the evidently very modest investment. Yet the money is far less of a problem that the uninspired plotting and flat filmmaking: there's just enough mileage in the premise for a talented writer or director to have made something a bit more atmospheric and entertaining. Here Moto is an Interpol agent assigned to find out who is sabotaging oil wells in the Middle East just as an American oil company's leases are coming up for renewal, which, naturally, he does in a snowy London, or more specifically a handful of standing sets from other pictures - an office, an apartment, a country house and a belly dancing club on the Thames waterfront. The supporting cast is distinctly low wattage - a few familiar faces from the ranks of better films like Terence Longden and Marne Maitland (who gets the what passes for film's best line when he tells his cohorts ""I suggest that we sit down and stop behaving like a United Nations Assembly""), professional Scouse git and future Prime Minister Tony Blair's father-in-law Tony Booth as a nervous hitman-cum-cabby, Suzanne Lloyd as the obligatory girl caught up in it all and Martin Wyldeck chewing the scenery as a former Nazi concentration camp guard (""In ze old days I heard the screams, like music of a happy, gay polka. Perhaps with you I make polka music.""). Moto's not much good at his job here - no sooner has he been assigned to protect someone than they get killed - and neither is Silva, only briefly showing signs of life in a bemused scene in the aforementioned belly dancing club but generally phoning it in. But it's hard to blame him in a film this weak: as he notes in his audio commentary, it's the kind of thing people made just to make a living, and it shows.

It's a poor footnote to a series that never really reached its full potential, and an all too understandably forgotten one, but it's nice that Fox went to the trouble of including a decent widescreen transfer with the original trailer for completism's sake.",1345507200,5,14206,4.805316973415133

He is a master of disguise and never misses a potential clue.  He did eight of these films over a fairly short period of time (this is the second set of four) and there are many top actors appearing in the various episodes.  The scripts may seem a little campy by today's standards but he was the prototype for the action heroes that were to follow.

This movie began as a Charlie Chan film, but after Warner Oland quit the set, the studio scrambled to save it by substituting Mr. Moto in his place.  They kept Keye Luke as Chan's number one son, but the role doesn't mesh well.

'Mr. Moto's Last Warning'  -  A cabal of secret agents scheme to sabotage the French fleet . . . .  There is another tie-in with Chan:  at 10 min. 21 sec. there is a subliminal promo for 'Charlie Chan in Honolulu' starring Warner Oland, later at 48:49 a theater poster covers this up with: ""LAST DAY"" (Oland had passed away during the filming of '... Last Warning.')

'Mr. Moto Takes a Vacation'  -  A priceless artifact is dug up in the desert and transported to a museum in San Francisco for display.  Unfortunately, a band of thieves is ready and waiting . . . .

'Mr. Moto in Danger Island'  -  The Governor is in a bind, the diamond syndicate is demanding that he stop the flow of cheap diamonds through Puerto Rico.  The last agent was murdered, there are no clues, and he has just received a report that Mr. Moto has appendicitis . . . .

Extra movie: 'The Return of Mr. Moto' (Henry Silva  -  This movie bears no resemblance to the earlier Mr. Moto movies; it is a dark, hard-edged movie of espionage and murders for control of Arab oil.  Picture: 4, widescreen, B&W.

A man of quick wit and chameleon abilities to blend in, joins up with a british agent to stop the suspected saboteurs. Mr. Moto faces death several times and survives by observational powers of deduction and underwater skills.

Mr. Moto is traveling by ship to the northern Suez port and is killed early in the film shortly after docking.  There is a ring of spies and sabotuers that plan to scuttle the French Fleet at the mouth of the canal to stop all marine passage.  Moto wears disquises to remain unknown, and yet mixes in well with the enemy agents to learn what they plan.  Comic relief comes from several Brits: the Port Commander, and a self centered traveler who has no common sense.  People are killed left and right until Moto swings into action and dispatches the entire band of spys.  He takes no prisoners and while his methods seem a bit extreme by today's standards, he eliminates the need for a public trial for these patently unscrupulous men.
This is the movie that pulls together all the parts of earlier films and provides a great adventure of non-stop thrills.
I found it a bit period in nature, but completely satisfying in its means of resolving a weighty problem, including coming back from the dead.

2683963,4,B000K7VHMI,"Thank you 20th Century Fox for realizing that those old classic B movies are loved and worth restoring.

The prints of these films are marvelously clear and complete.  It is easy to see why Mr. Moto was so popular in the late 1930's.  The stories are light-weight, but it is obvious that the producers and directors worked hard to make them look good.  Like the Charlie Chan series, Mr. Moto films are filled with the great character actors we all recognize.  In these 4 films we see Maxie Rosenblum, Dick Lane, Leon Ames, Recardo Cortez, John Carradine, George Sanders, Lionel Atwell and a truly fun performance by J. Carrol Nash as a particularly nasty Indian henchman.

The stories are full of spies and murderers who succumb to the efforts of the tenacious Mr. Moto.  Of course there is always a scene where he gets to display his mastery of Ju-Jitsu.  With Mr. Moto, crime is both a physical and mental sport.

In addition each film has featurettes which gives insights into the Mr. Moto character and films.  Especially interesting was ""Mr. Moto meets Mr. Chan, the making of Mr. Moto's Gamble.""",1175040000,17,1101,4.717277486910994

While it is probably not considered by most Moto fans to be the best entry in the series, it has always been my favorite.  Aside from the appearance of Keye Luke as Lee Chan (in what was originally slated to be ""Charlie Chan at the Ringside"") and Maxie Rosenbloom as ""Knockout,"" it's fun to pick out the lapses in continuity between the original Chan footage and new footage shot for the Moto release.  Most notable is how the character, Nick Crowder, the gambler, changes wardrobe during the first boxing match!  He walks in wearing a light-colored fedora and heavy woolen grey topcoat, yet in close up reaction shots, he appears to be wearing a black bowler hat and plaid suit, and then changes back again!

""Mr. Moto Takes a Vacation"" is another favorite from the series with Moto pitted against the evil secret agent known as Metaxa.  Good cloak and dagger stuff which works well in spite of the insufferable British comic-relief that they saddled Mr. Moto with in several of the features.

*** Robbery, Murder, and Disguises
A ship sails the ocean, there is a wrestling match for entertainment. ""It's awful!"" The professionals put on a good act for the customers. Mr. Moto shows his judo skills. [Or a double?] Did he strain a muscle? Cheap South American diamonds are smuggled into the USA, the diamond syndicate doesn't like this. One investigator was murdered! Should Colonel Castle take a ""long rest""? Moto was hired by the diamond syndicate but he has a health problem. Is there a trick here? Yes! The police arrive, but the smugglers get away. There was a leak in the Governor's office. Can Moto find the person who is an ally of the smugglers? There is personal conflict among this group. What about those knives? The dead investigator had a library card.

Moto checks those borrowed books, they were about pirate history. Is the Salinas Swamp haunted by ghosts? People who go there don't return. There is a shot, they leave quickly. Back in the hotel the waiter is murdered by electricity! Mr. La Costa wants to see the Governor in private. Could ships hide in the Great Salinas Swamp? The natives there aren't friendly. Joan Castle overhears a telephone conversation. McGurk finds a dead body with Colonel Castle's fingerprints on the knife! McGurk accuses Madero of the murder. The next day Commissioner Gordon finds Colonel Castle missing! Is Moto an imposter? Gordon orders his arrest but he gets away. Moto explains his trick to McGurk. Does it work? There is a surprise here! Moto explains his ruse to ""Twister"". Can they escape? A coconut make a noise. There are shots. Moto disables a motor boat then they row away.

Washington calls Commissioner Gordon and tells him about Moto. Moto tells about meeting Dolland in the swamp. A fast boat goes to the swamp. [Note the fake background.] They find Dolland on a fast motor boat and board it to rescue Colonel Castle. Will Dolland talk at 8pm? Someone throws a knife at Dolland, and he is captured. Moto explains the guilt of the murderer. He was caught by another ruse.

This is an average murder mystery set in the island of Puerto Rico. The South African diamond monopoly restricted production to keep prices high. Diamond smugglers found a lucrative market. The book (and movie) ""Diamonds Are Forever"" told of another case of diamond smuggling. [Note how governments are in cahoots with the monopoly.] Pearl Harbor put an end to this series. It would have been better if Moto was an Hawaiian.

Mr. Moto Takes a Vacation, 1938 film
*** Gambling and Murder
This movie begins on a ship sailing from Hawaii to San Francisco. Moto is using an alias to avoid recognition while on ""vacation"". Two men talk about ""cutting diamonds"" ( method to disguise stolen gems). Is Metaxas, the famous criminal, still alive in America? Scotland Yard believes so. There is a valuable crown that attracts attention. That armored truck was a phony, used to steal the valuable shipment. A tourist recognizes one of the thieves. The police arrive, there is shooting. One of the thieves escaped. The ringleader wants to rub out Moto and that British tourist too. One of the villains takes a shot with a silenced revolver. Luck is with Moto. Only the invited are allowed in the museum.

The benefactors of the museum are thanked. One man sketches the details about the safe! The curator opens the barred gates to where the Queen of Sheba's crown is kept. How many know where the safe is hidden? Moto asks other questions. Wong asks about Moto. A special investigator for an insurance company arrives. The alarm goes off! Mr. Wong telephones Moto about a secret, it can't be spoken over the telephone. But Wong won't speak! There was a white man in the next booth. The British man is an important witness, the one man who can identify the thief. Moto says they will try to steal that crown tonight, the police must be warned. The Professor is playing chess. Who entered that hidden safe? Featherstone was knocked out. Who did it? Later a man with a pistol enters to threaten the secretary. Moto unmasked the thief known to the French police. There is a surprise ending where Metaxas is exposed! [Did you suspect this?] There is a fight between Moto and Metaxas! [Were doubles used in this scene?] Moto triumphs again.

This movie has some humor mixed in with a serious story about robbery and murder. Some scenes show the humor of that era. There is an overall dark tone to the lighting, as if they wanted to keep costs down. This is about average for the series. Are those scenes of San Francisco realistic?

Mr. Moto's Gamble, 1938 film
*** Investigating Diamond Smuggling
Moto explains why the dead body can either be a murder or suicide. Science can determine the differences. Wellington explains his taking ways. The son of a detective attends his course. Then they to a boxing match. Somebody is putting up big money on this contest. Is it fixed? We see a knock-out. Moto explains the danger of gambling. Will Bill Steele win? The audience identifies with one of the boxers. Wellington takes a seat. [Are they nailed down?] ""Very exhilarating."" Steele wins in the third round. A doctor looks over the loser, but he is dead. A concussion? Moto corrects the doctor. Was it the collodion? A man goes to collect his winnings. The loser did not ""lay off the bet off"".Why did people in six different cities make the same long shot? Steels is indicted for manslaughter. Was he just a ""patsy"" to take the blame?

Steele is bailed out by a newspaper (to sell newspapers). Moto's class studies the boxing glove of the winner. They have different explanations for the murder. Then Wellington drives away! Moto reads the label on a coat and finds a clue. Can the Sheriff stop a car with nails? Crude but effective. Stanton show he is ready for his next bout. Lt. Riggs has a clue to the murderer, if he can find ""John Howard"" from Detroit. Does Gabby know something about the fight? Who put big money on that fight? Other locations tell about ""John Howard"". They find ""John Howard"" but he won't talk. Moto has a scheme. That night he disposes of a threat. Can a pistol be rigged to shoot by a timer? ""Can you remember now?"" Biff Moran will fight Steele. The fight begins. Steele is winning! Mr. Benton shows his hand, Can he get away? There is a payoff. Moto finds another body. The case is solved. There is a final joke for the audience.

This story has a warning against gambling on events that could be fixed. It tells about the culture of that era. The idea of a water pistol squirting poison on a boxer's glove is ridiculous! Don't referees check gloves before each round? Shouldn't the police have searched that fight manager when there was a question of murder? Somebody could have tampered with its contents to affect the fight. ""Wellington"" is played by Maxie Rosenbloom, ""Stanton"" is played by Ward Bond.

Mr. Motos Last Warning, 1939 film
*** Sabotage at Suez
The film begins with a map of the western Mediterranean. Two French squadrons will join the British fleet in Egypt for joint maneuvers in the Red Sea. There is a scheme to create trouble between these Allies. Does Madame Delacour talk to strangers? They land for passport inspection. Mr. Moto has a permit. No trouble at all. They take him for a ride. Norvel goes to a music hall. Fabian the Ventriloquist shows his skills. Mr. Moto uses a listening device. We learn more about the plotters. They have their plans, now Moto has his plans. Will he be watched? The Vulcan is a salvage ship that recovers lost cargo. This is a cover story for their real work: planting mines at the harbor entrance. What will happen to Burke?

Fabian has surmised Mr. Motos disguise. Will he take care of him? Will Connie Porter learn too much for her own good? Fabian has a hold on her. What will they do to Mr. Moto? Mr. Venable carries a message to the Port Commandant. Will he succeed? Can Moto escape after being sacked? Will Connie change her mind? Will Moto foil their plans? Will the dummy reveal the secret?

The war ended production of this series. This is an average story set in an exotic location. Was Connies actions at the end unusual for its time?",1488412800,,8193,4.674063800277392
