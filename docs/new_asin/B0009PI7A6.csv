8064734,5,B0009PI7A6,"BEHIND THE SCENES & TRIVIA:  Also known as ""Harness Fever"". Directed by Don Chaffey, this movie was originally made for the overseas market. The Walt Disney Studios made a number of quieter movies specifically for the foreign market tastes, and then they usually ran the films on their U.S. television show later. That was certainly the case here as Disney released it to theaters overseas first in September 1977. Two years later it was broadcast on the 25th season of the weekly Disney anthology show on NBC. The long-running show had just had a name change from ""The Wonderful World of Disney"" to ""Disney's Wonderful World"" in 1979. The film aired in two parts on March 25, and April 1, 1979.  Screenplay by Ed Jurist based on the book ""The Boyds of Black River"" by Walter D. Edmonds.  The wonderful period costumes are by Judith Dorsman. Music by Ron Goodwin. Filmed on location in Technicolor, and the Australian scenery is breathtaking. And if you are a horse lover or enjoy harness racing, this film is for you. Seems there is a horse in nearly every minute of film, and they are beautiful.

THE STORY: The year is 1911, and a young boy named Teddy in Australia loves the sport of horse harness racing, which he shares with his grandfather Mr. Boyd. Grandpa runs the huge Boyd  Farm that was quite wealth and famous at one time but has fallen on hard times.  They could get help from a wealthy aunt, but she and Grandpa do not get along. He trains horses for harness racing. The farm is in debt and there is a plot to cheat the family of their land.  Grandpa finds a young horse named Dandy Boy that could be a big winner. He and the boy train the horse together and learn some lessons along the way, but can they prevent the mysterious thugs that try to kill their horse to impact the bets on the upcoming big race that could save the farm? Great family movie, I highly recommend.",1260230400,3,1888,4.486880466472303
