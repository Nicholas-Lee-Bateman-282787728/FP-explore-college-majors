8617628,3,B00FPENJAY,"Mixed bag. Some of the included documentaries were interesting and informative. At least one consisted mostly of asides to the camera along the lines of, ""Look what a top secret place we're in!"" (While driving an access road, etc.) Generally, short on much information.",1504051200,,269,5.136363636363637
8617629,5,B00FPENJAY,"This 3 disc DVD set has 6 programs on it; Inside the DEA (Drug enforcement Administration), Top secret Plant 42, Inside Guantanamo, Inside NSA, Inside the Secret Service, and Inside North Korea.
There are English subtitles and the total running time is about 6 hours and 15 minutes.

All of the programs are interesting and show the viewer facts that they might not know about these various organizations and places. Of course the agency that is being filmed had the right to censor what was broadcast.
Plant 42 has an investigator determined to get inside this facility that makes top secret aeronautical vehicles. There are really not any surprises in these shows, but you can see inside facilities that do restrict public access. NSA allows cameras into areas never seen by the public and describes what their mission is. Guantanamo demonstrated the stress for the guards and is horrifying for many reasons on all sides. Secret Service shows the training and methods and mission of these men including their job to control counterfeiting. Clint Hill, Mrs. Kennedy's protective agent is interviewed about what happened that day in Dallas.
Inside North Korea shows a country few see or know much about. A camera crew follows an eye surgeon and the state of the country and Kim Jong IL's power and control can be seen.

You can learn much about these secret areas in these well photographed programs.",1394409600,,1400,4.927966101694915
