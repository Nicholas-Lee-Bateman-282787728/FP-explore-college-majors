1647533,4,B00005QARO,"This has several substories that are very interesting.  My favorite are the continuing antics of Goten and Chibi Trunks.  Their story alone is worth the video.  However, seeing the awesome power of Buu and his generally wacky behavior is somewhat refreshing after so many serious villians.  The story stays serious even with the humor.",1004400000,,335,5.148148148148148
1647534,5,B00005QARO,"The Majin Buu egg is about to hatch... there s steam coming out from the ducts around the egg.  The power meter is at its maximum and the egg is pulsating. Shin and Gohan look at the egg in horror while Babidi and Dabura wear a big smile (looks awkward on a Babidi, seeing that he looks like the offspring Freezer and the Taco Bell Chihuahua dog would have).  Shin urges Gohan to run away... Gohan does not listen...  He claims that Majin Buu would follow them anywhere anyways.
Gohan powers up... Gets a Kamehameha ready and shoots at the Majin Buu egg.
There is a blast, and when the smoke clears, the egg is still there.  More steam comes out of the ducts around it and Gohan shoots another Kamehameha.
  We switch back to Trunks and Goten.  They both stop to notice a very awkward power... they notice a lot of birds flying away from the direction of the new power.  ""Do you think this has anything to do with Majin Buu?""  Back at the tournament, an earthquake draws the remaining crowd away from the stadium, right up until when Hercule talks to the crowd to calm them (because he wants a crowd to remain for his coronation ceremony, of course).
  Back at the egg site, Gohan is still shooting his mighty Kamehameha at the egg.  Babidi just laughs at Gohan's febrile attempt to destroy Majin Buu.  The egg rolls out of its place, so Gohan stops his Kamehameha.  He looks at the egg and shoots at it again.  But this time, he notices the egg moving....  he stops.  The egg opens to reveal that it was empty!  Smoke comes out of the egg but, nothing is in it.  Babidi is crying and the Shin laughs in relief.  ""He remained in the egg for so long, he turned to dust!""  A very happy Shin urges Gohan to fight Dabura again....  But Gohan stands there.... ""I sense an immense power!""  Then he notices that the smoke that came out of the egg is taking form...  A big mass of pink clouds swirl in the sky.
  For the first time in this episode, we are taken back to Goku and Majin Vegeta's fight.  Both fighters are holding their own against each other in a tactical fight where only Majin Vegeta is forced to shoot energy blasts.
  Back at the egg site, the pink cloud finally takes its final form....  arms, legs... head, belly....  A big, fat, and pink fighter emerges!  Doesn't look like much of a powerful being, because its so fat....  Only Shin recognizes the pink blob...  Dabura and Babidi are not sure about who the fighter is.  Shin urges Gohan to run away.... immediately!  Babidi calls Majin Buu, but he only walks towards Gohan.  He takes a good look at him and he makes a back flip.  He walks towards Babidi...  ""Are you Majin Buu?""  The pink blob nods his head.
  Goku notices Majin Buu's monster ki... He stops the fight and urges Majin Vegeta to try to sense that awefully evil Ki.  Is this fighter really that strong?  We won't know in this episode, that's for sure. (...)",1004140800,5,2887,4.366037735849057
1647535,5,B00005QARO,He's hatching! the hole world is in fear when this teribal beast gets ready to atack the Z fighters. The fear of Buu spreds quickly. He finallay got sick of Baba-Dee's commands so he destroyed him. He is getting stronger and his extent of power getting to high for Gohan. You haf to see this movie. It's the Best in the Baba-Dee soga,1002672000,2,333,4.301587301587301

1647537,5,B00005QARO,"Hello everyone!! This might not be the best review, but I wanted to be the first to rate my FAVORITE villan and good guy Majin Buu! I can't wait to see him terrorize people and I hope his voice will be okay! I have the fansubs, and I don't know how many people have seen the Buu saga already, but I won't say anything about it so as not to ruin anything!! Even though Majin Buu is sorta weird and may sound funny, I think he's pretty cool, and so is Dabura (who has an AWESOME english dub) and Babidi! 'Paparapara!!!'(spell probably not spelled right!) I don't know anything about anyone elses opinions, but if you like DBZ, I think most will like this video! The only thing I don't like about it is the wait it's taking it to come out! However, the longer the wait, the better it will feel to see it!  I am glad, though!  I thought they would completly forget Majin Buu, and finish the Cell Games and so on!  Take care everyone!",1000425600,2,929,4.207865168539326
7950193,5,B00005QARO,I Love This First VHS Edited Version of The Majin Buu Saga. The Blu-Ray Version is Way Better and Has No VHS Edited Version Of It.,1517011200,,130,4.038461538461538
7950194,5,B00005QARO,"I recommend buying from this seller.
I am glad to see that the 4:3 or original version of DBZ is still sold.
Here the english voices are not re-dubbed ( they re-dubbed the voices of majin buu in the orange brick version which is cropped, etc), and the disc offers the original japanese cast.",1392940800,,291,4.407407407407407
7950195,5,B00005QARO,"Majinn Buu finally debuts in this DBZ DVD, and Gohan has the unlucky task of fighting him.  Can the appearance of Goten and Trunks turn the tide?  I doubt it.  Meanwhile, Goku and Majinn Vegeta continue to duke it out in their futile battle.  Can Goku convince Vegeta to let his rage go so they can stop the pink blob?  Well.... yes and no.  You'll have to find out yourself.",1067904000,,375,4.285714285714286
7950196,4,B00005QARO,"ha, ha! The arival of Buu! His grammer and voice is just plan FUNNY! The Supream Kai in the first episode was very funny. Hercule proves he's not a complete idiot when he figures out humans beings are cable of flying, however the way he thinks it's done is NOT right. So, once again you get to see Hercule make a fool of himself. Not a WHOLE lot of action but it will do.",1018396800,,371,4.027027027027027
7950197,5,B00005QARO,"This DVD covers the introduction of Buu, or Boo as Funimation puts it.  Babidi's new right hand man is fat and very child-like.  This is Buu's form after absorbing a fat Kaioshin in Bibidi's time.  If you continue to watch you will see unfolding one of the most interesting opponents the Z fighters have faced.  His poorly thought out antics end up creating a slim, evil Buu later on.  The series only gets better from here.",1009411200,,424,4.526315789473684
7950198,5,B00005QARO,"If The Cell Games was a bit of a dissappointment for you, the Buu Saga will more than make up for that. Babidi turned Vegetta against the Z-fighters and Goku was forced to go to Supersaiyen 2 in order to stop him. Despite Gohan and Shin heroic efforts to stop his awakening, Goku and Vegetta's fight woke up Buu. Buu has three forms but even in his fattest,weakest form he's still strong enough to beat the all powerful z fighters (piccilo and the saiyans included)as well as Shin. He quickly goes on to demonstrate his awesome ability by turning Babidi's right hand man Dabura into a cookie as well as taking Gohan and Shin out of commission and leaving them for dead. Piccilo and Krilin are turned back to normal but even the mighty Namek is forced to watch the battle against Buu from the sidelines. Don't forget Z fans Goku only has 24 hours on Earth before returning to Otherworld so believe it or not at this point of the Saga it looks as though Vegetta may be the only one strong enough to stop Buu, and he's ready to stake his life on it...with a little help from a few pint sized saiyans he just might pull it off!",1007251200,4,1123,4.327014218009479
7950199,5,B00005QARO,"As Goku and Vegita continue they're battle, Majin Buu is on the brink of being hatched. Despite Gohan's attempts to stop it, Buu is awakened in a cloud of smoke. Don't let his pink skin, fluffiness and child antics fool you. Majin Buu is one scary devil. (spoiler) This tape is easily worth buying. The best part is the eerie and haunting sound of the dub music on this volume. When innocent baby music is set against a haunting choir while displaying Buu playing around is one scary seen indeed. Overall, the best volume I've seen yet that easily surpasses Babidi-Decent and Babidi-Rivals. And thats saying something. If you have to buy one volume of Dragonball Z, make sure it's this one.",1005091200,,690,4.663934426229508
7950200,5,B00005QARO,"And so a new DBZ saga is at hand. Buu, his name may seem funny and so may his look but like most things, looks can be deceiving. Buu packs a very powerful punch to make up for his ""puggy"" form. Like Puar and Oolong he too is a shape shifter, his main attack is to turn people and others into food. First to fall victim is Dabura, Babadi's right hand man, who is turned into a cookie and devoured, setting Picollo Krillin free from their rock forms. Gohan soon goes in for the attack and is soon knocked away and left for dead. This fat look is only the first form of Buu, for he has three stages. (Contact me if you want more info because I don't want to spoil the saga.) Soon Trunks, Vegeta, Goten,and Goku arrive and trie to stop this horrible monster but can they do it. Well not in their shapes at this time. They leve to practice leaving Buu and Babadi the world to their pleasing. Hurry guys the earth is in dying need of the strength of the Super Saiyans!",1004918400,5,962,4.122340425531915
