3507972,1,B001CCH4RW,"This movie is just another anti-American propaganda film. It is completely despicable.

I also wonder how the actors agreed to play in this movie. Completely pathetic.",1248220800,17,167,5.423076923076923
3507973,4,B001CCH4RW,"Before I begin my review I'm going to give you all my biases up front - I'm a Marine and I served one tour in Anbar Province in 2007 with a rifle company.  Many of my seniors served in the Haditha area and told many-a-tale about that awful place.  Having gotten that out of the way, I really wanted to like this movie from the get-go.  It obviously draws its inspiration from one of my favorite films, the Gillo Pontecorvo classic ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Battle-of-Algiers-Criterion-Collection/dp/B0002JP2OI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Battle of Algiers - Criterion Collection</a>"", where many of the characters (including the screenwriter) were insurgents in the conflict rather than professional actors.  I've been pretty disgusted with the Iraq films and TV shows that have come out over the past few years.  Shooting in the California desert with a bunch of Mexicans dressed up like Arabs is never going to cut the mustard.  Iraq has its own look and feel, and the Iraqis have their own style, even compared to the rest of the Arab world.

So I was really excited when I read that ""The Battle of Haditha"" was shot in Jordan, which is about as close to Anbar as you can get without crossing the border, and used real Iraqis and former-US military personnel.  I also liked that Broomfield let them ad-lib most of their lines, giving them a feel of authenticity that no scriptwriter ever can.  Broomfield definitely sets standards that every subsequent Iraq film is going to have to live up to.  I also liked the controversial topic - there's a reason counterinsurgencies are called ""dirty wars"" and the Iraqis definitely do a great job portraying the mixed loyalties and emotions of many Iraqis as they seek to make some sense out of what was - for many Sunnis - an occupation.

Unfortunately, the movie's portrayal of the Marine Corps runs into a brick wall that nearly sinks the whole picture.  While I enjoyed Elliot Ruiz's haunted squad leader, none of the other characters looked or sounded like real Marines.  In fact, many of them seemed to be acting out popular stereotypes of Marines based on recruiting commercials and ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Full-Metal-Jacket/dp/B000P0J09C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Full Metal Jacket</a>"" or ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jarhead/dp/B000DZIGDU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jarhead</a>"", which is almost nothing like what they really are.  With the exception of Ruiz, there was almost no character development among the Marines, no explanation of how an infantry unit operates (which is crucial to understanding why the Haditha killings played out the way they did).  Broomfield also falls into the trap of using actors in their mid-to-late twenties to portray a bunch of kids fresh out of high school.  One of the guys I went to Iraq with was born in 1989 and was 12 years old when 9/11 happened.

Speaking from my experience, the Marines in ""The Battle of Haditha"" look like a third-rate Iraqi Army unit fresh out of boot camp. They do not know how to: hold their weapons, conduct mounted or dismounted patrols, clear a room, tactically question Iraqis, maintain cover and concealment, return fire, or conduct a squad attack on the enemy.  If such things don't concern you, then disregard what I've said, but this is a point of professional pride for me and I really wish Broomfield had been able to get a bunch of real grunts for his actors.  When I tried to get my company to watch this as a training film, the other Marines honed right in on this problem and were worried that some of our new-joins would get the wrong impression of how to behave in a combat zone.

Maybe I'm the last person who should be reviewing this - maybe this film was made to explain what Iraq is like to people who have never been there.  If that's your opinion, go see it.  But it was not made for Iraq veterans.  If that's what you want to see, I recommend the HBO ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Generation-Kill/dp/B001AQO3WY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Generation Kill</a>"" series or PBS's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frontline-Rules-of-Engagement/dp/B00167TTGC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frontline: Rules of Engagement</a>, which gets more of the technical details right.",1225324800,125,4429,5.5
3507974,4,B001CCH4RW,"I am an Army combat veteran of the Iraq War, and this is the only movie about the war that I've been able to stomach for more than thirty minutes. As a veteran, it is tough to watch simply for the closeness of the situation. The actors do a phenomonal job of portraying American troops in a tough situation, and the direction is fantastic. It is a poignant reminder of what we've gone through in Iraq. For me, the most difficult part to watch is the IED strike. Having survived more than one, I will vouch for the frightening realism of it. The sound of the blast, the dust cloud, the lack of a dramatic hollywood fireball. It gave me chills. I could almost feel the concussion from the blast.

If you are interested in watching a movie about the war, this is the only one I would recommend. The way the marines in the film act is a little over the top sometimes (although most marines I've met are a little over-enthusiastic), but overall it is a good representation of our thoughts, feelings, and fears. I would wholeheartedly recommend this film for any civilian who wants to gain a better insight into what the Iraq War actually looks like.",1218758400,18,1144,4.447619047619048

If I had been depicted in this film I would sue for defamation of character or slander. The enemy does not act that pleasant. The military can not and does not give orders to do the things they did. Not even the Marines would go that far. Only some one like Obama or Hilary Clinton would be that vengeful and childishly reckless with lives.

3508032,1,B001CCH4RW,"What a sad piece of propaganda...

Yes, the overarching events portrayed in this movie transpired. No, I was not there and I highly doubt the writer and director were there either. In fact, I highly doubt the writer or director of this film have ever stepped foot in a military base, an area of conflict, let alone a battlefield as complex as Haditha.

I've never been moved enough to write a review on a movie but I feel it necessary to point out the outright garbage this one was.

Pros:
- I loved the whole picture approach this movie utilized. It took into account and portrayed the events and lives from multiple perspectives and cultures (accurately or not the idea was strong).
- The acting by some cast members was great, most were tolerable, some were just bad.

Cons:
- The cinematography was amateurish at best. They attempted a documentary / embedded feel either intentionally or accidentally. Either way it was a disaster
- The acting fell apart during multiple scenes. It appears as though the sketch (film is too strong a word here) was rushed and wasn't given enough time or takes to mature
- Militarily the sketch was inaccurate and shows the utter lack of homework and thinking the creators put into it (yes I served and can speak to this). For example, The military doesn't call in ""explosives"" for explosive or munitions removal they call in EOD (Explosive Ordinance Disposal). I believe anyone who watches a few even semi accurate war movies / documentaries knows this.
- The sketch attempts to encourage the audience to believe that this is how our troops react every time they have a member of their unit killed

Last thoughts:
I may be biased because, as I said, I have served. I myself am very critical of war. I don't think many military members who have served or are serving aren't critical of it. My only hope of this review is to encourage potential viewers to first watch documentaries on the war in Iraq / Afghanistan created by actual journalists interested in the truth and decide if you smell something rancid.

The events portrayed in this sketch are accurate. I doubt that they transpired as it is depicted
The Marines involved deserve the worst the USMJ (Uniform Code of Military Justice) has to offer.",1483920000,2,2240,4.701530612244898

He was repenting for his action that caused many civilian's death, and later he encouraged the young girl to lie about the US Marine beating her in front of a video camera. Even an elementary school kid can write better than this. Seems like this movie was made by a film major student at a college.

I wouldn't go so far as to call this scripted or acted, or even directed. There's a few interesting lines, but they seem to be made up by the actors right before shooting. It seems more like a bad student film with a budget to hire some vehicles or militainment to ""tell the military's side of the story"" At the end of the day, the story is that marines massacred a bunch of innocent people because they were mad and unprofessional, as would happen when you tossed a bunch of 17 year olds into a war.

First, I don't think this film portrays the Marines any differently than I have seen them portrayed in other media. Second, I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. ALL sides of a situation should be shown, and this film sympathizes mostly with the Iraqi side. There are plenty of movies designed to sympathize with the American side, there's no reason that a movie from the Iraqi perspective shouldn't be made.

That being said, this move really drags in terms of the pacing. Additionally, it's just kind of poor quality. I don't like saying that, but the sort of ""gritty"" angle I think they were going for just looks slapdash and cobbled together. None of the actors seem really invested in their characters and none of the cinematography is very compelling.

One Marine plead guilty to dereliction of duty for giving the order providing negligent verbal instructions to the Marines under his command when he told them to ""shoot first and ask questions later,"". The terrorists themselves often used civilians as cover and considered ""collateral damage"" as part of their activity.

It fails to show how much the Marines love their country, their fellow Marines, and how much their country loves them.  It seems to tow the classic liberal lines about the Marines and the US in Iraq.  One scene has a drone take out a man walking down the street with a shovel.  It may have brought out some aspects of the Battle for Haditha but it was biased and one sided at best.  It completed omitted one massive aspect of the battle and the war itself.  That is the nobility of the Marines and the US as a whole in Iraq.  To remove a dictator, help them rebuild, help them set up a functioning and sustainable democracy, are all noble causes.

First, this work effectively and movingly portrays a pattern that is as old as war itself: the hostile occupation. It's very simple, really.

A) Dominant power conquers country A.
B) Country A resists conquest, fighting a guerilla war.
C) Dominant power's soldiers get sick of fighting an invisible enemy and mete out collective punishment.
D) More people flock to Country A's cause.

Second, BOTH sides are portrayed as fallible human beings. That's the part that upsets your conservatives, who want a boilerplate ""We-good, Them-bad"" narrative that simply does not correspond to the reality, which is invariably more complex.

You are going to hate it because it's so real. You don't even realize you are watching a movie. It's like you are watching a documentary. The actors are so believable, especially the Iraqi's, that you are just pulled in to what is going to happen. And you know it isn't going to be good.

This is the My Lai of a new generation. None of this would have happened if the civilians had told the Americans what was going on. But they did not, because they were scared.

There are no winners in war.

Oh sure it was good back in Napoleons day, when men were braver than they were smart, and you knew the enemy was the guy across the field from you, and he deserved to die before he killed you.

But now days, gorilla warfare is for cowards. Cowards and those smart enough to stay alive. The line between enemy and innocent is no longer known. And Innocent people pay the price with their life. Soldiers doing their job, whether right or wrong, are caught up in a clusterpuck beyond their ability to make good. Murder in war, it's a fine line, since war is just government approved murder.

Several reviewers are acting like this is just an anti-American movie. It's not. The Marines were shown as no worse than the insurgents who ran away leaving women and children to die in their place. As they said, they would have killed those families themselves if they had told the Americans about the bomb. Nobody's perfect.

It's a lot more complicated than that. What happened in Haditha is well documented. Not all soldiers and marines in Iraq have experienced the same thing. It's unfair to blame the film maker for showing us what happened in one place at one time in Iraq.

3508370,4,B001CCH4RW,"Based on a true story, The Battle For Haditha follows the events that transpired in Al Anbar province on the 19th November 2005.  An investigation of the massacre of 24 men, women and children in Haditha, Iraq allegedly shot by 4 U.S. Marines in retaliation for the death of a U.S. Marine killed by a roadside bomb. The movie follows the story of the Marines of Kilo Company, an Iraqi family, and the insurgents who plant the roadside bomb.
From the opening scene it is clear that this is going to be a very ambiguous movie. We join the Marines in what appears to be a home movie, where they describe their feelings for war. The first stating that he is not sure why they are there and that his only goal is to get back home to his family. Contrast that with another Marines tale of being excited about being the `Ultimate hunting experience' and you may very well be looking at this generations version of Apocalypse Now.
The line that separate the traditional sense of good and evil continue to blur throughout the movie and you see how, as an Iraqi citizen, speaking up can end with your life and that of your families in danger. This point is not lost on me with an early scene showing a dead body in the middle of the road that transpires to be the local English teacher. The man that would later lay the IED shows here he has no love for the insurgents either as  Broomfield continues to smudge the lines.
In contrast the Marines are clear on their objectives but even the best trained and best equipped are still only men when everything is stripped down and after the roadside bomb is detonated Cpl Ramirez makes instant miscalls that results in what we now know was to happen.
Nick Broomfield adds to the confusion and destruction by dulling the background noise at various points after the explosion and during the resulting firefight. With this Nick manages to make a film which is not anti Muslim nor is it anti marines. It is just a story of two very different cultures, with two very different sets of procedures, prejudices and misconceptions that set them into those tragic few minutes. Preceding the events conditions in Haditha itself were known to have been deteriorating under militant rule, and attacks on U.S. troops as well as executions of suspected informants were common so the fact, as I said before, that the Iraqis were afraid to inform the Americans of the bomb as well as the Americans being more likely to shoot first and ask questions later are equally understandable.

He is obviously under strain and is let loose then the coverup and sacrifice begins. It is ironic that the military wants crazy killers, violent and willing to sacrifice and are pushed thru very violent needed training, honed to a dangerous edge for which many are not mature enough to control. Then the let them loose w/ lots of firepower and expect them to trun it off like a light switch. This is something I have seen time and again in 32 years of active service. We want them fired up and then when the get out of control, we punish them! This movie was very sensationalized and unrealistic. Even the Marines don't leave the leaders in a protected bunker, doing the radio controlled commanding @ low levels. When you train soldiers to be violent they are and not always when you  desire it. Bayonet training, combatives, hand to hand training  coupled w/ weak immature egos lead to disasters like Haditha and collateral damage deaths of those who just get in the way and are victims not enemies.",1277337600,12,1442,4.458333333333333
3508372,5,B001CCH4RW,"Director Nick Broomfield cast 12 former Marines in ""The Battle for Haditha.""  One of them, Elliot Ruiz, plays the lead-role of ""Corporal Ramirez"" and is interviewed in one of the DVD extras.

Elliot Ruiz, we learn, is a combat veteran who was seriously injured in Iraq.  He was also traumatized psychologically.  Given the things he had seen and done, he began to have nightmares.  He couldn't sleep and he couldn't eat.

He needed medical help.

However, when he went to his commander -- in the movie as well as in real life -- and asked to see a doctor, he was told that it's not Marine Corps policy to provide a marine with psychological counseling while in Iraq.  He had to wait until his tour of duty was up.

Elliot Ruiz is bitter about this.  He's also bitter because he feels the Marine Corps did not adequately cover the medical expenses that resulted from his injuries in Iraq.

So here's a man, Elliot Ruiz, a former marine, not an actor, who suffered severe physical and emotional injuries who, in the movie as well as in real life, says, point-blank, that the Marine Corps ""just doesn't care.""

And yet, ironically, in his DVD interview he says that one thing he didn't want to do in the movie was to ""make the Marine Corps look bad."" ... Such is the extent of the ""loyalty"" instilled by the Marine Corps in its soldiers.

It's clear from the DVD extras that former marines were cast so that the movie would be accurate in terms of how things are done in Iraq.  For example, in one of the DVD extra, we see Elliot Ruiz brief the film crew on just how Iraqi civilians are stopped and searched at a US checkpoint.

We are also told by Nick Broomfield in the ""Director's Commentary"" that the marines lived together during the filming of the movie in specially-built barracks -- the same type of barracks they occupied in Iraq -- so that a great deal of the dialogue, camaraderie and horsing around is not staged but rather spontaneous, organic and unscripted.  Broomfield simply turned on his cameras and filmed it.

It should be noted that the title of this movie, ""The Battle For Haditha,"" is a misnomer.  It's not about a battle, it's about a massacre.  The movie reconstructs the events that led to the massacre of 24 defenseless men, women and children by US marines in Haditha in November 2005.

How did this massacre of 24 defenseless civilians take place?  What caused this atrocity to happen?  Was it simply a case of the marines losing control, ""going over the line""?  No. ...

What happened in Haditha happened because of US military policies that have been in place for a long time.  In the movie -- which included not only former marines with no acting experience but also several Iraqi civilians with no acting experience -- in the movie we see the training, the belief-system, the ""indoctrination process,"" if you will, that caused the marines to carry out their murderous assault.

We hear the marines chant: ""TRAIN, TRAIN, TRAIN, TO KILL, KILL, KILL!""

We are told by the marines themselves that they are taught to be ""like a machine"" and that because they are in a hostile environment, they need to be not only super-aggressive but suspicious of everyone -- men, women and children.

This is how US military are trained in Iraq and this is how US military were trained in Vietnam.  This is what is expected of marines by their superiors.

This is how a neo-colonial occupying force is trained, whether it's the US in Iraq and Vietnam, the French in Algiers, or the Soviet Union in Afghanistan.  ""The Battle For Haditha"" tells us, up-close and personal, what it's like to be a soldier fighting to expand an empire; that is to say, what's it's like to be a soldier trained to kill to make *others* rich.

Those others -- the soldiers' superiors: the majors, colonels and generals, as well as the economic/political elite at home -- those others make sure the soldiers are trained to be effective killers, but when they are maimed or injured, as Elliot Ruiz attests to -- tough luck!  The higher-ups ""just don't care.""

That's when the troops stop becoming ""our boys.""

When they need health care or help finding a job, then the political oligarchy that sent them into battle conveniently forgets who they are.

But this movie doesn't let us forget.  ""The Battle For Haditha"" is a vivid, disturbing, upsetting reminder of how the higher-ups orchestrate -- through their orders, their policies and their ""rules of engagement"" -- the killing of human beings, innocent as well as trained.

Interviewed after the movie, Ruiz said: ""It's crazy, people don't know the type of things that we go through.  That's what I like about the film, it shows that.""

In the movie, a marine is killed by an I.E.D. (an improvised explosive device), after which we hear a commander back at headquarters radio to the troops in the field: ""Take whatever action is necessary.  I don't want any more marines killed.""

Corporeal Ramirez (Elliot Ruiz) and his men pull four innocent Iraqis out of a stopped taxicab, question them about the I.E.D. and, frustrated, summarily execute them.

Then, searching for the insurgents who planted the bomb, the marines, now in a frenzy of rage, storm a nearby house, breaking down doors and indiscriminately killing everyone in sight, including small children.

After the initial cold-blooded killings occur, a marine sniper picks off an Iraq man running from the scene -- a man whose only crime is living in a house near the I.E.D. attack.

Fellow marines then gather around the sniper, laughing and joking, cheerfully congratulating him on his marksmanship.

After the massacre is over, the marines huddle up and a prayer is offered.

Corporeal Ramirez is then told by his superior that he will be promoted to sergeant and that he will be recommended for a medal.

However, Ramirez is sickened by what has happened and by his role in the massacre.  He goes over to the side of the road and throws up; returning to the snickers of his fellow marines.

Clearly, as per the marine code, killing is to be done without remorse.

In a prologue, Ramirez is arrested and along with four other Marines is charged with murder.  One of officers presiding over the trail being the officer whose orders triggered the massacre!

Director Nick Broomfield did an enormous amount of research to make sure he accurately depicted the Haditha events.  He not only cast twelve former marines in key roles, he also spoke at great length to some of the marines actually involved in the Haditha incident.  Moreover, he met with Iraqi insurgents who claimed to be active in Haditha.

The marines who were present at Haditha explained to Broomfield the ""standard operating procedures"" under which they were acting.  In an interview for ""Time Out,"" Broomfield explains: ""If, for example, a house is described as `hostile,' then you just kill everyone in the house.  It doesn't matter if it contains two-year-olds or the elderly, which is what they did in Fallujah -- where these guys had come from. ...

""It was hard to condemn them out of hand as cold-blooded killers. ... The US government and the Marine Corps (made) scapegoats of these guys, (rather) than actually deal with its policy and rules of engagement in Iraq.  I'm sure it happens on a lesser scale every single day.""

Finally, consider the consequences of the US interventions in Iraq over the past 20 years.

1.) Gulf War One.

Robert Fisk in his book, ""The Great War for Civilization,"" estimates the number of Iraqi fatalities in Gulf War One at between 20,000 to 35,000.

Others put the death-count significantly higher.  For example, a February 6, 2003 Business Week article entitled ""Toting the Casualties of War,"" reported that in 1992 Beth Osborne Daponte, a demographer in the Commerce Department, publicly contradicted then-Defense Secretary Richard Cheney as to how many Iraqis died in Gulf War One.

Daponte's report for the US Commerce Department's Census Bureau of Foreign Countries estimated 86,194 men, 39,612 women, and 32,195 children killed by Allied Forces.  A total of roughly 158,000 Iraqi deaths.

NOTE: By contrast, Gulf War One resulted in the death of only 379 Coalition troops; 189 of whom were killed as a result of either friendly fire or accidents.

2.) The Economic Sanctions Against Iraq

The US- and UK-led economic sanctions against Iraq lasted from 1990 to 2003.  Some estimate that by 2003 over one million Iraqis died as a direct result of those economic sanctions.

Denis Halliday, the United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator in Iraq from 1997 to 1998, resigned his position in protest, characterizing the economic sanctions against Iraq as ""genocide.""

As for the US government's response to the sanctions, on May 12, 1996, President Bill Clinton's Secretary of State Madeline Albright was interviewed on ""60 Minutes"" by Leslie Stahl.  Here is an exchange that took place during that interview:

LESLEY STAHL (on economic sanctions against Iraq): We have heard (via a UN report) that a half million children have died.  I mean, that's more children than died in Hiroshima.  And, you know, is the price worth it?

SECRETARY OF STATE MADELINE ALBRIGHT: I think it's a very hard choice, but the price, we think it's worth it.

The UN report Leslie Stahl was referring to was the 1995 UN Food and Agriculture Organization Report which stated that ""more than one million Iraqis have died -- 567,000 of them children -- as a direct result of the economic sanctions.""

That was as of 1995.  The sanctions last until 2003 -- with some putting the total number of Iraqi dead at over 1.5 million.

So that all those deaths were, according to a sitting US Secretary of State, Madeline Albright, ""worth it.""

3.) Gulf War Two.

In October 2006, John Hopkins conducted a survey in which they estimated that 655,000 ""excess deaths"" occurred in Iraq as a direct result of the March 2003 invasion of that country.

Of these 655,000 ""excess deaths,"" 601,000 resulted from violence and the rest from disease and other causes - with 41% of the violent deaths being of males either under 15- years-old or else over 44-years-old.

Both the Bush administration and the Blair administration dismissed the John Hopkins survey on Iraqi deaths; however, they *praised* a 2000 John Hopkins survey that estimated 1.7 million deaths in the Congo - citing that survey as the basis for UN security in that country.

NOTE: John Hopkins used the same rigorous, scientifically-validated research methodology in the Iraq survey as they did in the Congo survey.

-- In August and September of 2007, ORB (Opinion Research Business), one of Britain's leading polling groups, conducted a survey in which they estimated that 1,033,000 Iraqis since Iraq was invaded in March of 2003.

Like the 2006 John Hopkins survey, the 2007 ORB survey was only marginally reported by mainstream US and British media.  The story was quickly dropped, quickly forgotten.

What has, instead, been widely and repeatedly reported by mainstream US media is the number of *American* casualties that have occurred as a result of Gulf War Two
-- that number as of January 17, 2010 standing at 4,373.

In short: it took guts to make ""The Battle For Haditha.""  It's a remarkable film.

Indeed, the day will come when questions will be asked -- ""Why wasn't more said about what the West has done to Iraq?"" ... ""Why wasn't more reported?"" ...  ""Where was the artistic community?  Why didn't they speak up?  Why were there so few movies about what happened?""

Needless to say, the answers to those questions are shameful.

Key to the prosecution of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars is the government's systematic attempt -- indeed it's *success* -- in hiding the horrors of those wars from the American public.  The criminality of what the US government is doing in the Middle East should horrify every American citizen.

As the playwright Arthur Miller put it:

""Few of us can easily surrender our belief that society must somehow make sense.  The thought that the State has lost its mind and is punishing so many innocent people is intolerable.  And so the evidence has to be internally denied.""

As such, many people will be greatly disturbed by ""The Battle for Haditha.""  But to quote Pete Seeger's song ""God Bless the Grass"" --

""God bless the grass that grows thru the crack.
They roll the concrete over it to try and keep it back.

""The concrete gets tired of what it has to do,
It breaks and it buckles and the grass grows thru,
And God bless the grass.

""God bless the truth that fights toward the sun,
They roll the lies over it and think that it is done.

""It moves through the ground and reaches for the air,
And after a while it's growing everywhere,
And God bless the grass.""",1266192000,5,12733,4.796143250688705
3508373,4,B001CCH4RW,"I can't believe some of the reviews in here stating how unfair this film was in relation to the United States Marines. The film documents a real incident where many innocent lives were taken in apparent reprisal for the roadside bombing death/injury of several soldiers. The civilians, insurgents and marines are all given fair screentime to explain their actions and are presented in a very down to earth and realistic manner. I don't believe i have ever seen a war film take such an impartial stance before which is where the real power of this story lies. Because sides aren't taken we can make up our own minds as to the guilt of the characters involved. The real perpetrator however is war itself where motives and human nature become darkened to such a degree that this type of thing occurs. This film really highlights how different cultures and attitudes towards life and war itself clash and can cause such despair for the people caught up amongst it.

3508377,5,B001CCH4RW,"I'm going to stress the positives. The film comes as close to being a ""you are there"" experience as I've had in viewing war films. The pseudo-documentary approach, while not original in such matters, is done with expertise. And there is no film I'm aware of that penetrates the reality of the other side, be it civilians or insurgents, any better than this one. The incident itself was a tragedy, but certainly not one that besmirches the Marine Corps nor one that should just be ignored as another incident of war. But it is a reality of Iraq, like it or not.

Not being a former Marine (I was in the Navy), I won't take up the discussion about how real they are in the film. However, this is
a wonderfully constructed and technically excellent film. Which moves forward inexorably towards the tragedy without diminishing the humanity at play, be it in the Marines or in the civilians. Anyway, this is a very good war film, among the best at actually treating
its subject matter.",1253923200,3,980,4.6

3508379,5,B001CCH4RW,"These Docudrama's usually depict our soldiers as the relentlessly brave bastions of American good-will and saints that could nor would, ever do wrong.  Unfortunately those sentiments usually just propagandize our ill driven reflections or just blind ignorance of reality.

So, it's refreshing to see an accurate depiction of reality on the screen for a change.  I remember this event and studied it extensively and although most negative reflections into our military are usually sugar coated by those reflecting on negative such as these but then sum them up with some kind of excuse for justification; there is no sugar coating here; THOSE PIGS should be executed for what they did... not just humanely executed, but equally as brutal!  What they did was nothing but Puuure Murder, plain and simple.  Not just murder, but brutal and cowardly slaying's that make Charles Manson look like a saint!

The only sugar coating I'll give is that they were in part, trained to think that way from the onset.  Nevertheless all one has to do for a sense of reflection is to ""put the shoe on the other foot!""  Imagine the tables turned and that was your family!  Still think my comments are anti-american?  Sad, but I'm sure many of you do instead of the acceptance of reality.  Go ahead, let those ""christian"" comments exude.

If you're interested in seeing some accuracy in our military campaigns for a change, I can't recommend this one high enough!",1253318400,3,1442,4.913223140495868

This is a generally well done genre account of men in combat on either side of the line, as it relates to this specific time and place. Those who question the ethics of conquest and insurgency alike will find confirmation of their values in the characterizations of both parties, as they eventually war with themselves over their sacrificing of the innocent.  It is, of course, the same scenario played out in My Lai, in an earlier war.  This shows us that war is not made by ""policy analysts,"" but by 20-year-olds whose gung-ho home patriotism and bootcamp training do not prepare them for the realities of what they are to do.  It also removes the  fiction that atrocities were a ""Vietnam thing,"" a product of a particular war and its particular strategies, and that we now ""know better.""

My main criticism: although these combatants eventually see the light - with only the generals and jihadists, aloof from the blood, remaining in fanatic shadow - real combatants do not always receive such clear-cut epiphany.  Protracted war dehumanizes, rationalizing atrocity as ""deserved"" to atone for ""our"" suffering.  That was the ""defense"" for Lt. Calley in said earlier war.  This film asks the viewer to question the founding premises of war by rightly displaying its real victims; those who die by the sword are, usually, not those who live by it.  But beware that jihadis in the deserts of the Middle East and Washington know how to capitalize on feelings of injustice and sense of injury, to produce more of the same.",1510012800,,1629,4.806451612903226
