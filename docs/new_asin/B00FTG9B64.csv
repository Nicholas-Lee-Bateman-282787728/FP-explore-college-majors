8618543,5,B00FTG9B64,One of my all time favorite comedies! The jokes come fast and furious at times and reminded me some of a Mel Brooks movie but with a higher percentages of funny gags. It plays perfectly to Jack Lemmon's talents and all the supporting actors were very good. Funny! Funny!,1527638400,,270,4.530612244897959
8618544,5,B00FTG9B64,"This is for me the best comedy Wilder made after Some Like It Hot. Its got comedy, poignancy and romance at its adult best. The locations are stunning, so are the sets, and the Blu-Ray transfer is immaculate. Juliet Mills and Clive Revill (impersonating an Italian) are a delight. A great Saturday night flick for your flat screen, and a definite keeper.",1527552000,,354,4.725806451612903

8618547,5,B00FTG9B64,"I saw this movie with no expectations or preconceptions.  What a find!  My favorite get away from it all movie.  No other movie melds the music with the mood so perfectly, and what moods.  Jack Lemmon plays an  industrial executive in his patented hectic, preoccupied manner.  Juliet Mills is a British working class girl who can find the silver lining in just about any situation.  Jack's father and Juliet's mother have been meeting (spoiler alert!) at a gorgeous Italian resort for years.  Unfortunately, they died in a car accident while on vacation together.  Jack's plight  to bring his father's remains back to the States takes place in one of those times when the outside world seems to have gone away.  As he works his way thru the red tape and eccentric characters, he discovers a new outlook on life.  Juliet allegedly had to gain some weight for the role, but she never has looked more appealing.  The stellar supporting cast is led by Clive Revill, as the hotel manager.  Should have received supporting actor consideration for this role.  Shot on location, makes me want to go there for my next vacation.  Look for the passport clerk, seen in the beginning of the film to reappear later as a desk clerk in the hotel on Ischia!  The soundtrack CD was recently released in a limited number.  I listen to it in the car on long trips.  It reminds me of the soft breezes, bright sunshine and triumph of the spirit.",1519171200,,1423,4.642570281124498

8618551,1,B00FTG9B64,"This Blu-Ray was advertised as a A/B/C region disc.
Upon inserting the disc into my PS2 - I got nothing but black screen.
So upon inspection, I saw the Hexagon symbol with only a 'B' in it.
Bad.",1473638400,9,194,4.131578947368421
8618552,3,B00FTG9B64,"Lemmon goes to Italy because his father died there and he's going to bring back the body for burial. What he doesn't know is that he died with his British mistress, whom he saw every year for about a month. The daughter is also journeying there to bring back her mother's body. The hotel staff was very fond of his father and girlfriend. Anyway, Lemmon plays a hyperactive Type A personality industrialist that has to deal with the Italian bureaucracy. The plot is pretty predictable, though pleasant, as he slowly mellows out.",1462060800,6,527,4.739130434782608
