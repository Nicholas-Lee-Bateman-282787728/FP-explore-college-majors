8707864,4,B00UQW1YXE,"TOUCHING,  PAINFUL, STORY OF A YOUNG MAN (GIJS BLOM) AND HIS LOVE FOR HIS MOTHER, WHOM HE HAS DISCOVERED TO BE POWERFUL PAINKILLERS TO CONTROL THE AGONY OF HER TERMINAL CANCER - WHICH SHE HAS TRIED TO PREVENT HIS KNOWING.  EXCELLENT PERFORMANCES OF  ALL PRICIPALS IN THE CAST, BUT ESPECIALLY OF YOUNG BLOM,  WHO MUST
COPE WIYJ THREE MAIN TASKS:  HELPING HIS MOTHER WHOM HE LOVES,  ALSP FINDING HIS FATHER WHOM HE HAS NEVER KNOWN, ALL THE WHILE PURSUING HIS CAREER AS A VERY YOUNG CONCERT PIANIST.

THE YOUNG BLOM  REMINDS MONE OF THE YOUNG RIVER PHOENIX AT HIS YOUNG PEAK IN ""TRAVELING ON EMPTY"", .
BLOM OF COURSE IS NOT PHOENIX, BUT THEIR SENSITIVITY IS ANALOGOUS. MAY BLOM BECOME THE LEADING ACTOR OF HIS TIME AS RIVER PHOENIX SEEMED TO BE SO DESTINED . . . UNTIL HIS TRAGIC DEATH SO RUDELY TERMINATED THE FINEST TALANT OF HIS ERA.

A WORD OF COMPARISON.  IN JOGGENS (MIS-TRLATED AS ""BOY,S,"" BLOM HAS OBVIOUSLY MATURED, ESPECIALY IN MAKING HIS FACE DISPLAY EMOTION BY SLIGHT CHANGES, SOMETIME ONLY IN HIS EYES WHICH HE HAS LEARNED TO KEEP  GUARDED SO WHEN NEEDED THEY CAN EXPRESS A STRONG SENTIMENT (E.G. WHEN IN SAYING TO  MAC, HIS MUCH LOVED FRIEND,
HE LETS HIS ELES ALONE SHOW HOW DESPARATELY SORRY HI IS.

I VENTURE TO SAY THAT YOUNG BLOM HAS THE ABILITY TO BCOMES THE LEADING  ACTOR  OF HIS GENERATUON - SO LONG AS HE ESCAPES THE  CLUTCHES  OF HOLLYWOOD.

MAY HE STAY HAPPILY IN EUROPE WHERE FILMS CAN BE MADE AS SIMPLE AND ESSENTAL AS - WHEN SUCCESSFUL -  AN
 ANCIENT GREEK PLAYWRIGHT  SUCH AS SOPHOCLESE OR EUREPEDES  MIGHT HAVE WRITTEN.  .",1466640000,,1549,4.532608695652174
8707865,5,B00UQW1YXE,"It is without doubt the finest performance that Gijs Blom has given to date. It is an extremely moving story, beautifully played by all actors, superbly written and photographed, with a beautiful music score. I only wish I could contact him personally to tell him how moving his performance was. I hope in the future all his films are released with at least English subtitles so more people can enjoy the work of this remarkable young actor.",1441411200,3,441,4.740259740259741
