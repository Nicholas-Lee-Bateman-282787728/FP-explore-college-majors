7872585,5,6304459033,"What fascinates us most about the Titanic disaster? The ship's glamour? The immensity of the tragic loss of life? The hubris of its claim to be unsinkable? Whatever it may be, there's no question that there are plenty of mysteries still unsolved. Titanic looks at two of them in depth: In A Question of Murder, we get a behind-the-scenes look at the building of the great ship and how the owners' belief in their own hype led to the crucial decision to restrict the number of lifeboats, ensuring the deaths of over 1,500 people. In The Nightmare and the Dream, we fast-forward 80 years to undersea explorer Dr. Robert Ballard's historic voyage to the Titanic's resting place two and a half miles below the surface. The archival footage and interviews of the first program bring the past to life, while the excitement of the Ballard expedition brings a kind of closure to the ship's long history. Eerie shots of the Titanic in its watery grave remind us that nothing is perfect, that nothing lasts forever. --Rob Lightner
