7801071,5,1893907104,"This is a very good video. Even though I have over 25 years of experience on the guitar, Jim Tolles' explanations were captivating and prevented me from assuming things that would lead to bad habits. He is clear, articulate and addresses the important points that a personal instructor would provide.
The video itself is well done, with a time frame in the upper right of the video so that you can rewind and play sections over and over for practice purposes.
The ""Fiddler Primer"" book by Jim Tolles is a recommended companion to the video, and is also available here on Amazon.com.",1055635200,12,582,4.715686274509804
7801072,5,1893907104,"I would HIGHLY reccomend that you get the Jim Tolles book/cd package that goes along with the video.
The video is great, nice and slow, Jim is a great instructor for those teaching themselves!
Best thing I've found is to watch and play along with the video for a few sections.  Then spend the rest of practice time with the book/cd to fill in the gaps, and to get some extra practice.
Alone they are both fine products, but together is ideal!",1008374400,15,442,4.390243902439025
7801073,4,1893907104,"While the best way to go is, of course, private instruction, this is a good place to start for beginners.  The tape starts with how to hold the violin, and bow, and even how to rosin the bow, before moving on to playing.  While I had to rewind a number of times to understand exactly what notes the instructor wanted me to play in the beginning, it gets (a bit) easier as you go.  There's no way to make playing the violin ""easy"", but this tape, and *lots* of practice, is a good starting place.",995241600,23,495,4.189473684210526
7801074,2,1893907104,"Hi!  Intro to Violin is a good primer for playing the violin, but the program is a bit too fast.  I've had to stop the tape and repeat many sections, before progressing.
I still think the best way is to get a personal instructor.",977184000,13,229,4.181818181818182
