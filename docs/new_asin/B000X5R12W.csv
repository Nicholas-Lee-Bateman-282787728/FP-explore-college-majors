8227003,4,B000X5R12W,"HWANG JIN YI is a South Korean dramatization of a real-life gisaeng of a famed courtesan/poet of the fifteenth century. Hwang Jin Yi (Song Hye Gyo) is a noble lady who is revealed as a commoner by a man who soon regrets his hasty deed. This man determines to spend the remainder of his life atoning for his misdeed. This is a leisurely paced film that allows one to see how atonement becomes its structuring basis. Critics have carped over what they see as the film's alleged flaws: its interminable scenes of non-action, the stone faced reaction of its star (Song Hye Gyo) in many critical scenes, and a lack of interaction between Jin Yi and her doomed lover. But I think that these ""flaws"" are integral to the movie's theme. The director envisioned it as an extended internal monologue of the two star-crossed leads, not as a psychological thriller but as gradual exposing of one man's horror at what his ill-fated decision has caused to a woman he has grown to love. The external scenes of non-action mirror the internal conflicts both must suffer and endure even as they acknowledge the futility of their love. There is a powerfully understated scene near the end where Jin Yi visits her soon to be executed lover and both touch fingers through a jail cell and say a brief goodbye couched in a language of love of what might-have been. HWANG JIN YI is a delight for the mind even if some remain offended at a few deliberately filmed scenes that for them do not equate to their expectations.",1402704000,,1495,4.602996254681648
8227004,3,B000X5R12W,"Took a while to locate a version with English subtitles but found it, although not perfect translation.  Song Hye Kyo has always been a great actress and very beautiful but in this role, she looked stiff.  I wasn't sure if this was due to the time period this movie portrayed but was disappointed.  The movie is very slow so be prepared to have some snacks when watching.  Love all the very beautiful landscape and clothing.",1340150400,,424,4.613333333333333
8227005,5,B000X5R12W,"I have watched this movie with better subtitles.  The plain matter of fact is that judging the movie with awful subtitles from a questionable source can taint the entire experience into something that contrary to the reality.

This movie is based on a North Korean author's best seller about the life of a giesang or Chosun period entertainer, who was famous for her beauty as well as her wit.  Even though she was a real life character from the mid 1500s period, there is little veritable detail about her life.  What is popularly known is that she was raised as a noble woman, and later in life she was to figure out that she was not really 100% noble after all.  The movie or the novel in which it is based makes a point of the life she decides to live, after she abandons the life that was not hers.

What is known about her today is that she was a decent poetry writer, whose short poems have been passed down through time.  According to my wife, her poetry is still read as part of the national literature reading curriculum for secondary schools in South Korea.

After watching the movie, it is uncanny the relationship between many gifted female writers from different periods and societies.  The writer depicted in this movie reminds me much of Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz, another gifted woman who was born in a society way ahead of its time.

The movie itself is wonderful in the way is shows the quirks and problems of the time.  The tension between the peasants and the upper classes, as well as the mores and hypocrisy that existed among those who claim to be virtuous.

The movie is well made, it has a certain color and rhythm that is particularly Korean, different than the Chinese and Japanese period pieces in its subdued acting, that is if the watcher is careful to compare the differences.

I recommend that you search out the original subtitled Korean version, but you will need a code free region 2 DVD player to play it.  In our days, these players are rather affordable, therefore there would not be an issue watching different region movies.",1197504000,6,2065,4.545945945945946
8227006,3,B000X5R12W,"I'm a big fan of Song Hye Kyo (Gyo) and I anticipated the release of this movie, ""Hwang Jin-Yi."" However, since English is the only language I know, it was very disappointing to know that this DVD itself does not have the English subtitle option. Luckily, the DVD player that I was using gave me the option to play this particular DVD in English. To my surprise, the subtitles was awful. The English was very broken as if it actually translated the main movie's language, word for word into English. For those that know any foreign language, you would know that trying to translate it into English would require you to re-word it so that you can understand it. This was the only downfall for this particular DVD. I did, however, tried to go through the entire movie attempting to ""encrypt"" the subtitles so that I can understand what's going on. I got the general idea after the movie ended, but I wouldn't want to go through that ordeal again.",1197331200,2,944,4.5588235294117645
8227007,2,B000X5R12W,"This movie is interesting in that it takes a historical figure popular in Korea and presents her from a different angle. It clearly takes many liberties with the actual historical events, but artists should be given some license as long as they don't distort the integrity of the person they're are bringing back to life for the purposes of entertainment. However, the subtitles in this edition of the movie are absolutely horrible, at least for English speaking audiences.",1194912000,2,473,5.076923076923077
