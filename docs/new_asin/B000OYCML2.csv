8187619,4,B000OYCML2,"Karin is the oldest daughter in a family of Vampires. She has a strange deformity. Instead of sucking blood when she gets near her a person with her preferred blood type, Karin produces blood. Mostly it gushes from her nose, but she can give her extra blood to humans. It gives them a positive experience. She meets a boy in school, Usui, who she develops a crush for. She wants to get close to him and have a relationship, but when she gets too excited around him she bleeds through her nose profusely.

This anime has a very fun and playful vibe. The characters and situations are funny and very entertaining. It's almost your typical high school romance/comedy. The Un-Vampire twist makes it quite different. My only complaint with this anime is the production quality. The animation isn't very detailed, and a little bit blurry. Especially in the character outlines. I do like the character designs and coloration though. My other issue is the bad voice acting. Most of the characters sound stoned or drunk. It takes a lot away from the series. I've listened to the English and Japanese tracks. They are both kinda bad. If you can deal with the sub par animation and bad voice acting, this series has a fun story. I have seen the prices on amazon and it's not worth it. I got it on e-bay for a whole lot cheaper. If you decide to try it out, I suggest watching it online or renting it before you buy.",1356048000,,1404,4.5058823529411764
