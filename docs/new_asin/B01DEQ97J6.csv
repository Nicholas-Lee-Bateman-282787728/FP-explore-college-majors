7712022,5,B01DEQ97J6,"The first half is undeniably fantastic, and hardly flawed in the slightest but from a few minor pacing issues. It fleshes out the characters in a way that makes us sympathetic to their struggles and sensitive to their hardships. In my review of Collection 1, I noted that some people were a tad miffed by the somewhat blunted ending. Uncommon to sci-fi action, the ""war"" we expect is small-scale, and it all comes down to the question of whether Shinichi can overcome his inner shortcomings to triumph in the end or not. Everything that can be applied to the first half can be applied here when it comes to production and tone; the plot is what separates those who like the series from those who don't. If you genuinely care and share empathy for Shinichi and Satomi as the events progress and can be entertained and intrigued about their personal journeys, I can almost guarantee that the second half makes this a series of near-perfection. However, if you are expecting large-scale battles and gut-wrenching horror, you will most likely be disappointed. Don't get me wrong; it is there, but not executed in the way conventional sci-fi fans would expect. As I am typing, I realize that Medaka Box is coming out as a complete collection on Blu-Ray, just as Majestic Prince before it. Therefore, I will be content to wait for this series (one that I deem completely worth buying) until it comes out in a more affordable format. More affordable for a college student, anyway. Take my word as you see fit.",1459382400,20,1502,4.714828897338403
7712023,5,B01DEQ97J6,Love the entire serious just wish there was more. Great job on art work an story. Very bloody. If your an anime fan don't think twice before buying it.,1487203200,,151,4.241379310344827
7712024,4,B01DEQ97J6,I ordered part one and two together and the packed came with a huge whole and part two the back of the DVD was a rip but other than that everything was fantastic,1481760000,,161,3.909090909090909
7712025,4,B01DEQ97J6,The box set is a bit chincy. If you just want the rest of the story just get the regular media. But if you enjoy having a little extra with your anime then this box set is not so bad. Great second half of the story that both my wife and I enjoyed a lot. cheers,1481068800,,260,3.6607142857142856
7712026,5,B01DEQ97J6,"A great offering by Sentai Filmworks. The Dub is spot on. A near perfect translation. Very scary, don't watch alone.",1479427200,,116,4.85
7712027,5,B01DEQ97J6,Absolutely loved this series. And both the box sets are well worth the money.,1475366400,,77,4.571428571428571
7712028,4,B01DEQ97J6,"Pros:

- Getting Parasyte on Blu-Ray
- Packaging pretty decent.

Cons

- 24 episodes were divided into 2 sets.
- Each set has two discs instead of one, and the episodes are not divided well between the discs.",1473724800,8,208,4.421052631578948

7712036,3,B01DEQ97J6,"I am a HUGE fan of this series so I NEEDED to buy both boxed sets!  The series itself is top-notch: both story and animation are of the highest quality.  Apart from the alien beings, the setting, characters and world physics are very realistic.  Definitely not for fans of outrageous character designs or crazy, unrealistic situations.  What drew me in was the complex and realistic ways the characters relate to each other.  The intrigue within the story keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time.  Not for children as there is a fair amount of gore and violence.  One of my Top 5 favorites of all time.  5 stars for the anime!

The 2 star deduction is for the packaging and disc extras.  The packaging is very standard for a box set.  The bonuses are a manga and soundtrack, which do not justify the high price.  The first boxed set had better bonus gifts (a mini figure, micro-fiber cloth, decals).  As always, Sentai is lazy about their disc 'special features', which consist of clean opening/ending and trailers.  In my opinion those are not 'special features'.  If you are not a die-hard fan, get the regular edition.",1469577600,8,1131,4.613065326633166
7712037,5,B01DEQ97J6,I'm also glad I bought this too ^_^,1468800000,,35,3.5
7712038,4,B01DEQ97J6,Great series. Shinichi is the classic dork who becomes something entirely after an encounter with an alien life form. But what the heck Amazon? The prices for these blu Rays is obsurd. The entire season should be 40$ at best. You can watch the subbed version on Hulu but it would be nice to hear the English dub. Won't buy till the price comes down.,1468627200,2,349,4.384615384615385
7712039,5,B01DEQ97J6,"Really good quality this show aired a long  time ago and didn't get on adult swim.untill later now it's finally here.in North American on blu ray/dvd I used to stay late just to catch it and I eventually finished it online. The anime is about a horror gone wrong once an ordinary teenager gets infected with intellectual parasyte later named migi the two learn to co exist and fight to save humanity a great anime with.a great ending. On to the quality, I know people complained that.it was a poor release trust me I know funimation would do worse with poor quality images of just.plain concept art nothing unique like a gun drawn on the the disc so it looks like from your perspective that it's an illusion pointed 3d out at you through the hole being the head of it. The art of the box is just copy pasted high quality images with a little bit of Photoshop looks great because it has extra dramatic red bloody look to each disc and interior and exterior of case let me just say the case is original.art so that it is step up in quality then most box sets it ts better than the Japanese version because their version is just.the promo poster you would see.on a Netflix label with the special features I'm guessing and a complete series release no volumes release like ours is. same thing though i did want to mention they pay homage to that missing art from the Japanese release when you display the volume spine art of vol 1 & 2 it shows that exact Japanese cover just on the spineof the cases. the blue makes it look out of place with the bloody.red every where else  The anime comes with volume 1 manga special sentia filmorks Edition complete with color glossy pages and alternate cover art I wish it were hard cover but the dvd blu ray card board box has space slot made just for it can't complain I got other goodies that make it better than the eastern release like the series sound track thar sounds eally good even though i spoiled my self to it already online it had been floating around I love it so much it it fits the show perfectly I don't think you have to like the anime to enjoy it if like electronic music in general your friends would tolerate it at clubs i do like the cards I got with it just art on cardboard just limited edition and fun to look at of course I won't really open that stuff I just don't have a need for it so I'm glad I got this because the prices are scabbling so I'm glad I got this when I did 75$ now like 80$ seriously the box should have been steel if it goes over 100$  something yeah =_= let me know when Amazon screws another franchise so that's my review as a whole I really don't want to have to.type this again. android user 8:36pm Tuesday July12 2016 - isaac",1468281600,,2709,4.2563106796116505
7712040,5,B01DEQ97J6,This premium box set definitely delivers. The exclusive manga is probably one of the best inclusions along with the complete soundtrack. Having this decorative piece will definitely enrich my collection.,1467676800,2,203,5.8
7712041,3,B01DEQ97J6,"This is a great ending to a great series, but they need to get real with the pricing.  I don't know if someone from Japan just decided to do a quick price convert from JPY to USD or what, but the price on this thing is way too high for what is offered, It's not worth the price they are asking for.  The whole series should be between $20-$40.

It is a great series if you can catch it on an anime streaming website.",1467331200,7,416,3.9285714285714284
7712042,1,B01DEQ97J6,"Why is dvd more expensive than Blu ray? I am hoping this is an error that hasn't been corrected, but needs to be. I am a fan of the show and have been waiting for part 2 to come out I see it is coming soon but costs 23 dollars more than Blu ray. I prefer dvd and do not really care for blu ray please address this! As far as a anime review I highly recommend this anime definitely worth adding to the collection.",1466985600,,412,3.8588235294117648
8755745,5,B01DEQ97J6,"The anime made me want to read the manga. Now I am obsessed with both and will look into purchasing its hommage manga Neo Parasyte.
I purchased the second part of the series after seeing how wonderful the anime and plot was. Definitely worth it. The story continues and we see Shinichi and Migi's bond grow more in the last remaining episodes. Its so nice seeing these two, who were forced to co-exist, now have mutual respect and friendship tenderness towards each other. I only wish this world the author created had not ended! I want more!",1533340800,,542,4.597938144329897
8755746,5,B01DEQ97J6,"Parasyte is a wonderful anime. Emotionally deep, very well thought out, and just all around exciting. The music is awesome beyond measure, the quality of the art is consistent and well done, and the story is perfectly linear and opens and closes without any gaps or hiccups. I highly recommend this to any and all anime lovers. I rarely see such emotion portrayed in animes, and this has such a wide array of emotions too, not just cut and dry typical clich stuff. I definitely support this anime and hope to see more with this kind of quality.",1528848000,,544,4.561224489795919

8755751,5,B01DEQ97J6,This series is a wonderful way to be entertained. The animation and writing are top notch. The story is of an invading alien force that literally takes over the body and proceeds to devour humans. This is the second set so I recommend you watch the first season before going after this one. I was given the first season and after finishing it went to Amazon  and found a good deal on the Premium box set. Very happy with the purchase. See the first then grab on to the second. A great set of entertainment.,1521417600,,506,4.326315789473684
