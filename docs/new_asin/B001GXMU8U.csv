8307388,3,B001GXMU8U,"I thought she would like this as a break from her tougher workouts (she usually uses Erin O'Brien DVDs).  But she says there's so much silly ""self-empowerment"" talk on this one that it really takes some concentration to block it out.  The workout itself, on the other hand, is a good change of pace for her.  It's only 30 minutes -- all isometric exercises that are tougher than they look.  I'm just glad that it was so dirt cheap.  Otherwise, I would have regretted the purchase.",1407196800,,480,4.534883720930233
8307389,5,B001GXMU8U,"I've been using this DVD for a week.  Today 2 different people told me how well I look - they said I positively glow!  Jeannine's workout is very low-impact - great for my 57-year-old bones.  While it won't increase heart rate, it will help firm you up, increase flexibility, and tone your skin.  I highly recommend this DVD.",1234828800,2,325,4.551724137931035
8307390,5,B001GXMU8U,"I bought Jeannine's ageless woman workout dvd for my sweetheart for Valentines day. So far my girlfriend says she likes how great she feels about herself after her workout and as a result our sex life is better than ever.

Thanks Jeannine!",1234396800,2,239,4.690476190476191
8307391,5,B001GXMU8U,This is THE DVD to invest in this year! I really appreciated Jeannine's down-to-earth and approachable style. I have been doing the workout for a week now and I can already see a change in my body and in my mind. This yoga-inspired workout covers all that I am looking for. Hope I can become AGELESS like Jeannine!,1233014400,3,314,4.431034482758621
