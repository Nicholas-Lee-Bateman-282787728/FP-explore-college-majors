I like the 1930s ski resort setting, especially when the chorus sings I hear the sound of horses approaching, and a cable-car comes swinging onto the stage.  Too bad the romantic tenor looks so much like a sad frog in baggy pants, but his voice is fine.  A very entertaining performance, excellent sound, visually sharp, magnificent music.",1508198400,,454,5.178082191780822
8601359,5,B00E5BIM5U,"I had been checking to get a Sonnambulas production for a while, but the reviewers were not convincing until I saw this version.
This particular production is an update; the meaning of the plot did not change, even though it takes place in the 1930 in a Swiss alpine resort.
The story could be considered silly, but the music is so beautiful that it really doesnt matter. Operas can be silly. Romantic or very dramatic, but the most important thing is the music, that is why they still are presented around the word.
The cast was outstanding, led by Jessica Pratt who plays Anina, La Sonnanbula. Even the smallest characters are very good as well as the chorus. The scenery and costumes are beautiful.
The quality of the DVD is excellent. I highly recommend it.",1508025600,2,761,4.644444444444445
8601360,5,B00E5BIM5U,"This is a case where updating the setting of an opera works well.  The Swiss ski resort is attractive and suits the story line well.  Bellini's music is beautifully performed.  All in all, a thoroughly enjoyable ""La Sonnambula"".",1490140800,,228,4.947368421052632

8601364,5,B00E5BIM5U,"Picture your ol' reviewer last night, gentle reader: sipping on some lovely 2011 Rento Ratti Ochetti and enjoying this opera production for the first time. Life was quite good. But this DVD has so many merits, it is difficult to know where to start; maybe with some more Ochetti.

So let's start with the production: it made as much dramatic sense as one could ever expect from what is basically a silly story of a sleepwalking woman who is found in a stranger's bed causing her fiance much anxiety which manifests in some crude treatment  of a nice and innocent woman, Amina (I suspect that a modern woman, under analagous circumstances would drop kick the guy through the uprights). By showing some serious attraction betwenn Amina and the Count at the latter's first entrance, some dramatic sense is made of what follows.

But, of course, it is Bellini's music that makes Sonnambula so popular, despite the plot, and it is splendidly realized in this performance!

Jessica Pratt is fairly unknow to me, my only previous experience being in Rossini's Cyro In Babylona, courtesy of reviewer colleague, S. Wells. Pratt is an Australian, lovely to behold and even more lovely to hear. She is a true coloratura soprano, with extended range, and awesome technique, which permits her to fully realize all of those vocal devices that lovers of bel canto find so irresistible. It never ceases to surprise me when I discover yet another new (to me) and exciting performer. Seek her out, gentle reader, and be thrilled!

Shalva Mukeria (Elvino) was totally unknown to me when this disc was first listed. Since experience has taught me never to buy before hearing, I sought him out on You Tube and was delighted at what I found. Mukeria has a light, lyric and agile tenor voice, splendid technique and personal charm. While he will never be nominated for an Academy Award,  his acting is good enough for this role, and he makes the best of Elvino. Bravo!

Giovanni Battista Parodi does an excellent job as Count Rodolfo. His is a rich, resonant bass voice that is bigger than it seems at first. He easily outsings the chorus and orchestra and has a nice presence onstage.

The minor players add to the fun, with particular kudos to Julie Mellor, who sings Teresa with open throated ease.

Chorus and orchestra contribute a lot to the successful realization of this Sonnambula. The chorus interacts which always increases the dramatic integrity of any opera performance. Maestro Ferro has a firm hand in the pit, as well as obvious affection for the musical score.

Staging is not the traditional sleepy village, but is set in a Swiss ski chalet in the 1930s, and while I prefer the traditional most times, here the staging works. (Someone might want to send Mary Zimmerman a copy so she could see how poorly her Met staging compares with this one).

Disc quality is great. The scenery in Act II actually gets some applause, which is unusual these days. The camera catches perfectly all of the settings and costumes in crisp detail. DTS sound here produces a nice surround effect in my watching room; perhaps I am getting used to the surround effects and react less positively. It's as good as it gets, sonically. Subtitles are in all Western languages, plus Chinese and Korean. There are no extras.

This Sonnambula eclipses the competition, friends. It is perfectly executed and meltingly lovely. Buy with confidence.",1383091200,24,3409,4.838487972508591
