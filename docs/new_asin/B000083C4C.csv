It is too long, self-indulgent, and under-whelming.  Any of the films from the Brown family (of ""On Any Sunday"" fame) are much better productions of much higher caliber.",1266796800,,333,5.62
8645906,2,B000083C4C,"The incredible noises and colours in this film make it tricky to follow at times to say the least. Yet I do believe that Goddard was sucessful in achieving his goal presuming that it was to combine completely irrational cinematographic sounds and images with relavant political tensions very typical of the era. There is the strong influence coming from French fascination for all that is American. I would recommend this film to those allready accquainted with Goddard's work as without concentration, it would be very hard to follow, if not impossible otherwise.",1100563200,2,564,5.141304347826087
