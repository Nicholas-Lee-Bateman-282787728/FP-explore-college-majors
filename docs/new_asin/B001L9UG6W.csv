3682802,5,B001L9UG6W,"I am a beginning dancer who has to mostly rely on video instruction for my practices.  So, I put a lot of thought into what I buy.  I bought Autumn Ward's video after seeing clips on Youtube and I'm glad I did.  I was looking for a comprehensive video that would break down the dance vocabulary and focus on building a strong foundation.  Ward's video provides just that.

The first section is a detailed section on basic moves such as arm work, hip work, and transitions.  Autumn spends a great deal of time breaking down each move, demonstrating correct technique, pointing out common mistakes, and adding in her dance philosophies.  Therefore, it is a great ""reference"" for dancers to come back to if they want a calibrated breakdown of a move.  As a beginner, it has also greatly helped me learn and recognize dance moves when I see them.  In essence, it is the language of the dance, explained for any dancer who desires a muscular and intellectual understanding of the basic moves.  That said, she does not focus on coaching the viewer through drilling.  If I want a substantial drill, I follow her instruction on the move, pause the video, and drill it for 3-5 minutes.  Then, I begin the video again.

The second section offers ""practice flows"" that the viewer can use to integrate the technical practice with rhythm and flow.  The warm up is not as rigorous as I like but it feels relaxed and joyful.  The flow segments are short, which is good for a weeknight practice and builds intutive understanding of transitions.  They are also accessible and can offer the feeling of actual dancing even for a beginner like me. A more experienced dancer might find that the flows help them integrate Ward's unique style into their own.

The third part is a choreography that I have not done.  It is wonderful though and I am working my way up to it.

The video includes 2 performances, both of which are inspiring and so joyful to watch.  As I learn the dance and find my own voice and identity, I really try to cue into how a dancer makes me feel when I watch her.  Ward is a model for seamlessly blending and communicating playful joyfulness and earthy sensuality.",1234656000,38,2166,4.588541666666667
3682803,5,B001L9UG6W,"Autumn besides an artist with a wonderful talent, is also a top notch instructor.  As she shows you the steps, she moves like a swan on water, regal, gentle, graceful.  She breaks down every step, every movement, slowly, clearly, with grace and generosity, with patience that only a true teacher can call her own.

From her way of teaching one can truly feel and understand, that Autumn cares, and wants you to really learn, learn well, not only how to execute the steps; but how to make them graceful and fluid; therefore guiding you along the way, little by little, and transform your dance into an inspiration, a work of art.  She wants you to learn, and believe me, you learn!!!

In my opinion, to watch Autumn teach, the way she moves, and demonstrates through words and actions, how to attain flawless artistry, would not only be essential for beginners, but helpful to more advanced dancers interested in belly dance, as a art.

She truly posses the gift and skill of the generous, knowledgeable and noble soul of a dedicated teacher, as well as that of an artist, a magical combination for students of belly dance.  Unfortunately  that ""magic"" is not usually found in many artists (prominent or otherwise), who ""teach"" .

Three more things I'd like to add:

1)  Autumn teaches from different angles, in front of a mirror, in a well lit room. She wears  a costume, that let you see all the nuances, of every move she's in the process of teaching you.

2)  Thanks to Amazon for carrying this product!

3)  Thank you Autumn for your inspiration and experience, for caring and giving so much! And last but not least, for the break you give to your students, allowing us to purchase such  a wonderful tool for an affordable price.

PS I'm looking forward to your fallow up instructional  DVD.!",1234396800,12,1796,4.662420382165605
3682804,5,B001L9UG6W,"This fantastic DVD will tell you how to create beauty in belly dance from the very basics to the finer details, and to ""dance with the radiant feeling of an open heart.""  Autumn Ward is a gorgeous, graceful woman with excellent verbal skills, who can teach you both with words and visual examples the fundamentals of her art.

For Beginners:
If you've never taken a dance class in your life, This DVD would be a superb first course, and should keep you busy for months because of its lengthy tutorials. You'll learn terminology, all the basic positions, and some easy to learn choreography. Because of the simple and well lit production, and Autumn's concise demonstrations which are easy to see, this DVD is a great starting point for any beginner, and those of you studying other art forms are sure to learn something too.

For Intermediate Level:
There is much to learn here even for the more advanced student because of the emphasis on style, and the many details one might have overlooked while learning the art of dance. It makes a terrific refresher course, as Autumn's technique is so precise (and shows her versatility in a variety of dance forms), and her expressive musicality is marvelous to watch.

In the ""Practice Flows"" segments there is a ""Music Only"" option which I appreciate to practice with, once one has learned from the verbal instruction, and the performances are a treat. The 1st one is  continuous flow from one tempo and rhythm to the next, and the 2nd one a sultry number in a beautiful red and black costume, like a dream from the 1001 Nights come to life. Music is well balanced and lovely, and includes Serpent's Garden, Electric Oasis, Solace, and many more.",1234310400,16,1690,4.73469387755102
3682805,5,B001L9UG6W,"She really is concerned about you getting a foundation. She takes her time to teach the moves in a very detailed manner with various illustration of what to do as well as what not to do. Very different approach from most instructional dvd's. I think this is a good instroduction foro sensual belly dance. You are taught full body awareness.

She shows you what it looks like when your form is not right. She really zones in on the many mistakes people make when learning the posture and when your body is out of alignment for each move what it looks and feels like. She uses the wall and the floor to teach you undualations. She uses the clock and other naturual things to help you visualize the direction your body should be moving into and what part of the body is doing most of the work. Not bits and pieces here and there. Very detailed explanations. After buying other dvd's I can see the importance of her illustrations.

 Her drills are great at the end because she combines the moves in a smoothe way that makes you feel like you are floating into the moves. Relaxing and just feeling your every movement from within. She makes it an internal experience because belly dance expecially sensual belly dance is a from of expression. This would be good for praise dancers. You learn to put feeling into your performance. She teaches with feeling. You should have this one as a part of your collection for variety. You can see her every move when she does a performance. This should be a variety to your collection.",1233964800,7,1518,4.532846715328467
3682806,5,B001L9UG6W,"With all the right ingredients, beautiful movement flows on a correct foundation. This program has all the lovely touches that distinguish just movement from dance. Here are the embellishments to present your dance with the qualities of an experienced dancer, flawless, and finessed.

The eloquences in dance terminology and the finished result brings Autumns dance to captivation.  I recall performances by Autumn in past issues of WDNY videos Her style is unique as is her look.

 I chose to begin my review by viewing her performance section before beginning the program. The performances are rich, with the freedom to embrace a combination of styles; strong in oriental and classical dance; Indian hints sprinkled about. Once I studied her style of expression, I felt it would be simpler to understand her program.

The dance theory is elaborate and begins in full blown detail. There is much to the technique and the warm up is essential to prepare the body for these moves. Autumn tells you she will start at the beginning and she does.
 To begin, the warm up section is extensive. The foundations, from breath to movement because proper inhalation and exhalation brings  life to the dance. Orientation of space in a stage, turning,  Autumn narrates and moves about quickly because there is much to learn.

The technique section defines basic posture, with several variations such as wide stance, staggered stance,  building blocks, and upper body mechanics. An elaborate section on arms, basic and elaborate  arm transitions. Also included are lower body movements such as:
Tilting the pelvis
3/4  shimmies
Hip lifts and drops
Circles
Undulations

In the dance philosophy segment, the practice flows and practice choreography are designed with and without voice cues. Pace yourself
in the practice flow section as it is designed in six series pending your progress. Patience and perfection is pretty much a solid theory, before moving ahead, ""if you slosh through the moves, so shall you engrain into your muscle memory.""

In the practice choreography Autum explains the five elements she implements into personal choreography.
 The musical is mystical and allows freedom of movement without a rigid beat. The dance moves are clearly defined and the visuals were clear and pleasing to the eye.

Although this program is designed for beginner,  some background  of basic fundamentals  will facilitate the entry to the program.  Faithful use of the warm up section will allow an easier transition into some of the intricate moves as twist and shift and others simply because muscle memory makes some of the intricate moves here easier to master. Overall,
the near three hour presentation is not only interesting, but captivating as Autum moves and speaks. Autum doesnt spill out overly dressed jargon but rather she presses forward with confidence and eloquence of words that match her style. This approach to belly dance is the trajectory to artistry in a beautiful way. I loved this program and learned much from it.",1233792000,23,3023,5.143149284253579
3682807,5,B001L9UG6W,"Belly Dance Beautiful Technique from Step One

If you need a break-down of the basic steps and music playing in the background (sometimes even the foreground) distracts you, you need this video.  Autumn Ward is an intelligent and philosophical instructor.  She breaks down the basic moves clearly, making sure that you take note of your alignment.  You will have the opportunity to practice each step with her initial instruction, during practice flows, and during the choreography.  You have the choice of doing the practice flows and practice choreography with or without voice cues.  You will learn about stage direction, orientation of your limbs to your body, basic classical arms, breathing, balance and philosophy of dance.  This is a 2 hour video that has a lot in it.  I would recommend taking notes as you watch the portions on philosophy and what you should think about when analyzing your dance.",1233360000,6,907,5.040268456375839
3682808,4,B001L9UG6W,"I should preface this review by saying that I'm not a natural dancer. I'm not coordinated and I have a hard time remembering choreography (without constant repetition). I also have bad knees, which like to partially dislocate if I turn them wrong. Add to all that, I'm over fifty years old and overweight. Much less than before I started using belly dance to exercise, but still.

I bought Autumn's video after beginning with ""Luscious"" and having a hard time with some of the movements, specifically undulations. I used the tutorial section to strengthen my form in the areas that worked for me as well. I like the way Autumn demonstrates different ways to execute movements.  Her instruction on undulations was especially helpful to me because she provided more than one way to execute the movement. Autumn has grasped the concept that every body's different and no single style of learning works for everyone. (I *so* appreciate that!)  Her teaching style is clear, precise, and methodical. Moreover, Autumn anticipate and warns against common mistakes, some of which I was making. I enjoyed learning the form for arm movements and finger and hand exercises, and became more graceful as a result. (Well, as graceful as I ever get.)

I had difficulty with the practice flow, but not because of any flaw in Autumn's pedagogy. The hip shift-twist, etc., which begins with a single knee bent straight forward, proceeds in such a way that my knees became sore. (My knees need to face forward, so the twist was a problem.) I did eventually master the techique insofar as I am able, but my kneecaps wanted to move out of line so I executed the movement sparingly.

Autumn's online bio doesn't say that she has a background in ballet or modern dance,possibly because hs enow focuses on traditional ethnic dance, but she did tale gymnastics as a child and she might have learned [some] ballet as a result.  Mostly, her style of dancing reminds me of the way my high school modern dance teacher moved. I would certainly reccommend this video for anyone who wants to pay attention to proper form, as it's clear to me that's what you get.

As a parting aside, I wish I knew where she got her practice hip scarf. That thing is cool looking!",1312675200,9,2230,4.761658031088083
3682809,5,B001L9UG6W,"First of all, I am using my boyfriend's account to review since I don't have one. I promised I would mention that I'm not him so people don't think he is secretly a belly dancer :)

So onto what is hands down my favorite DVD of all time...

The biggest strength of this DVD is that it bridges the gap between technique and artistry, something I believe many instructors do not address in enough detail. Many class formats are based on teaching more and more complicated movements, and only then are you taught the subtle nuances that transform you from ""someone who dancES"" to ""someone who is a dancER"". Autumn, on the other hand, teaches these components- including alignment, visualization, variations, angles, flow, and spiraling- from the very beginning and applies them to each and every movement, starting with the very basic ""building blocks"". This allows you to execute each movement with polished, clean technique from the very beginning, rather than having to go back and refine your technique months or years down the road. It also gives you the tools to start creating beautiful dances from the very beginning. This is the difference between drilling and drilling and drilling for years, then *finally* getting to dance, vs. having the ability to dance while you are still learning. Autumn's way is a lot more fun. I also love her idea that the very simple building blocks can be put together with each other to create more sophisticated movements. The possibilities are endless.

I have found the best way to use this DVD is to follow the seven lesson plans that are outlined in the companion guide, which is available for download on Autumn's website. The companion guide is an invaluable resource and gives a detailed breakdown of the DVD, music diagrams, and notes on the flows and choreography. Study these closely and learn how to make music diagrams and choreography notes yourself- this will help you immensely when you create your own dances. The seven lessons each correspond with a practice flow and tell you what movements to practice and where they are located on the DVD. Following your independent practice, do the practice flow, which teaches you how to flow from movement to movement and to actually dance. Plus, they are fun! Autumn also gives advice to dancers in the guide. Really study the guide, take notes, scribble in the margins, make connections. Autumn's blog is also a great learning resource; she explains her choices for dances in detail and gives advice on how to develop as a dancer.

The choreography serves as an example of how a beautiful dance can be created using simple moves done extremely well. It also allows you to learn to transition from step to step and how to use musicality and emotional expression. Autumn goes over her philosophy on creating choreography and dances; I think she nails it on the head with her belief that you should be serious but not stern, be happy and have fun, and make intentional choices that lead to dances that are beautiful to watch and that you enjoy doing. Another great learning resource on creating dances is Autumn's blog; she gives advice on developing as a dancer and explains all of her choices in great detail. The careful thought she puts into each dance shows that she is more than just a choreographer or a dancer- she is a real artist.",1309564800,6,3334,4.803135888501743
3682810,2,B001L9UG6W,"I've taken a few belly dance classes before, but that was years ago, and I can't currently afford them.  But I wanted to get back into dance, so I read reviews of several DVDs and finally decided on this one as a good starter.

I wish I hadn't.

I was really disappointed in this DVD as a ""beginner class replacement"", and after I thought about it a bit, I realized why.  There's a vast difference between explaining something to someone, and teaching it to them.  This DVD *explains* things beautifully, and I imagine I'll go back to it once I've worked with the two other DVDs I've bought and gotten a bit more of a foundation, to polish technique and use the practice flows and such.  But it doesn't really *teach* belly dance very much at all.  In the instruction sections, Autumn explains various positions and moves in great detail.  However, there's no opportunity to practice the move she's explaining along with her.  She demonstrates, maybe even demonstrates a couple times if you're lucky, but then it's on to the next one.

If you're the kind of person who can watch something being demonstrated/explained once, then practice it on your own, and that doesn't frustrate you, you'll probably get a lot more out of this DVD than I did.  I'm looking for more of a teaching/learning experience than a technical explanation, and Autumn's demonstrate-and-move-on just didn't do anything helpful for me.  I tried one of the practice flows, but with there being such a gap between having the move explained and then having to go into a totally different section of the DVD to actually use it, I had a hard time integrating what had been explained into following the flow I was trying to do.",1303257600,21,1693,4.6824324324324325
3682811,5,B001L9UG6W,"This came highly recommended if you were after a technical learning DVD.  I am an advanced beginner and I started back at square 1 with Autumn.

What can I say but she is a very very good teacher.  Her teaching style is excellent and I really enjoy the learning, flows and pace of it all.

I won't say much more other than this is simply excellent if you want a serious technique learning.

Will always have a place in my libraray to come back to, and I hope Autumn does some more for the next level and beyond.

She is an amazing dancer and a fantastic teacher!",1293926400,3,562,4.205607476635514
3682812,5,B001L9UG6W,"I've purchased a lot of belly dance instructional videos, and this is by far the best.  It may not be encyclopedic but it's pretty darn thorough I think this is the place to start.  There is a section on techniques that is VERY clear and in depth, and I recommend going through it little by little until each element is mastered comfortably.  Then you can do the practice flows and choreography, which show you how to merge these elements together.

Autumn Ward has a beautiful, balletic flow to her movements and she teaches specifically how to achieve this.  In fact the arm sections are essentially ballet ports-de-bras as I was taught them, with some character styling added in.

Don't try to use this video as a workout, or to build strength.  I'm enjoying Rachel Brice's videos for that.  This is more about how to put together the ability to actually dance.  I'm finding my own style by experimenting with each motion until it feels like ""me"".

Buy this first!  I can't say enough good about it.

For those who would like to develop the grace, balance, and isometric flow in their movements I highly recommend Finis Jhung's ballet instruction videos&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Finis-Jhung-Ballet-Technique-Level-1-Barrework-for-Beginners/dp/B000JJRY7E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Finis Jhung Ballet Technique Level 1: Barrework for Beginners</a>.

3682814,5,B001L9UG6W,"Step One is a valuable tool in helping the beginning student create a solid dance foundation. From a wealth of information ranging from the dance foundation fundamentals, to methods/theories for creating your own dance and choreographies. This DVD has material that can grow with the student.

Sectioned into three main chapters:

Technique
Thorough break-down of fundatmental techniques & concepts that help create a solid dance foundation. The practices cover anatomy, explanations on how certain movements should feel, balance & weight, stance & alignment, breath...etc. Then the dvd moves onto increasing your basic dance vocabulary, by taking the basic movements already taught and building upon each to create more complex intermediate dance movements.

Practice Flow
Conditions the body & mind, with repetition and practice so the movements are incorporated into your msucle memory. There is a warm-up & arms section, along with 7 different practice sessions that progress gradually to help build your skill level.

Choreography
 A beautiful choreography by Autumn is taught, with a practice section, and costumed performances. The choreography taught is lovely, with wonderful music. She also includes, inovative methods and concepts so you may create your own dance choreography.

The explanations are quite thorough, and the information included in this DVD is vast. I have used this DVD several times and still haven't begun to absorb it all, yet. It feels bit encyclopedic.

I have enjoyed working with this DVD, and found as an intermediate student, there was valuable information, I had not known before. I would highly recommend this DVD, whether you are beginner level or  an intermediate student who would like to brush up on their technique.",1266969600,5,1759,5.4411764705882355
3682815,4,B001L9UG6W,"At first I could not get thru the break down she dose in the beginning of the disc but then I jumped to the warm-up and there I found help. Most of the warm-up section I use over and over. Her dancing is beautiful and flawless.  I, like her, am not interested in cabaret/resturant dancing.  I love her theatric.  She knows how to tell a story with her dance, marvalous.",1255824000,4,369,4.242857142857143
3682816,5,B001L9UG6W,"With her new video, Autumn Ward aimed to bring in the sophistication of the dance from the foundational level. Her objective has made this video different from most other basics videos, which focus on giving the beginner the full repertoire of moves.

The sophistication objective also means that this video is very ""talky'. You don't just start dancing from minute one. That's both good and bad. Absolute beginners won't have the patience because they don't yet care deeply enough. On the other hand, if someone is serious enough about wanting to learn belly dancing in all its elegance, perhaps to get to performance level, then the instruction here will help build clean technique. That means detail detail detail. Even without doing a full-ish repertoire of moves, this video is long. If moves such as the one-hip circle, vertical eights, upper body moves and more had been included, this would have had to be a double disc set. Not a bad thought, in my opinion.

So really, the focus is on form here. Every aspect of form rather than every move known to bellykind.

And so we begin with a Foundation section, probably the most important on the video. Most instructional videos will take a moment to explain correct posture. Not so here. We go through complete head-to-toe guidance including the alignment of the hands and arms, feet and legs, the orientation of the whole body, balance and weight, overall stance and alignment and breath and flow.

`What Autumn does is to explain the rationale behind each concept, demonstrate how it works, how to do it, how not to do it and she also gives you a practical exercise to check or practice.  I have rather weak ankles and dreadful balance, and found her advice on how to ensure you place your feet properly and how to improve balance really useful.

My own way of working with this section would be a) bring it into the regular warm up I do and b) sometimes work through any one part of the section and immediately implement it in the dancing I choose to do after that. For instance, I worked with the feet placement aspect and then when I did a round of Bellydance Rhythms, I paid deliberate attention to the placement of the feet all through. This makes the moves come out more confidently, I must say.

The Foundation section is really like an enhanced lecture. Learners may find it tedious all at one go unless they're dead serious. Breaking up working with it might make it easier. See, implement, come back and check.

The Arms segment is also foundational, which is perhaps why it follow next. It's still within the explaining and demo'ing portion of this video. Here, Autumn goes through some basic arm positions, variations, and technique. She basic technique and broken line technique. Autumn actually uses her arms a lot and very prominently and this contributes a lot to the energetic and fully-present feel of her dancing, in my opinion. It's my belief that following her tips here could make all the difference to how lifted and elegant you could look. The focus is more on energy and stength and how to use it rather than on giving lots of different arm paths and styles. So, for those looking for a mini encylopedia of arm and hand moves to pick from - this is not it. Rather, it's information and demos on how to get the simplest positions look elegant and dancerly.

We get to another big section now: Building Blocks. This section opens up with a big menu of its own. The description of what is taken up is different from what you'll typically see. There's ""Full Shift Side"" which we also know as a large vertical slide. There's side to side tilts, lengthen forward and back (forward and back slide), isolated shift side, and released shift back. Yes, you'll find these on most other basics videos but Autumn takes these up in greater detail, changing weight and urging you to pay attention to certain aspects of form. So again, it's for those who want a lot of finesse but perhaps not for those who would rather just get on with it without so much depth.

The building blocks are now taken to the next level. Tilts, shimmies and drops, 8s and circles, forward hips, undulations and twist-and-shift are all taight in detail, with each of these having its own menu of further broken down secitons. Many of the movements are advanced. The weighted drop, for example, is something you won't often see on an absolute basics video. Also double drops, off-center circle, forward hips, and many variaitons on undulations. The basic undulation is taught with great care in what is the longest explanation I've ever seen before. I'm definitely going to correct and align my basic unduation with this section. But no reverse undulation has been taken up. I really would have liked that.

The Twist-and-Shift section is also, I believe, a fairly advanced move and difficult for a beginner to do cleanly. The basic twist-and-shift is taken up in three variations.

It's here that we actually get into the do-along phase. Autumn explains her approach, and then gets into a medium-length warm up. It's more of a warm up than a conditioning program like Asharah's. There are many moves I've worked on with Sera's East Coast Tribal, though it's a shorter warm up on this video.

There's an Arms flow and warm up now. You need to know what's in the previous arms technique section to work along with this one. This isn't a reetitive drill but a flow, so you need to be familiar with the seauence to keep pace. I'm not very good with flows that involve quick-changing instructions so I would need to watch many times before I can do exactly what she's doing at the same time. The section will help improve transitions but you have to be nice and alert to catch the nuancing. Don't forget to also follow the gaze.

Practice time! The practice flow section has seven little flows of about five minutes each. These are not dance-ready combinations though they do involve coordinating witht he msuic. These do increase in difficulty level as they go up to the more complex moves. While the first flow-bit is easy enough for me, the rest need to be carefully done if this beautiful form is to be maintained. When I tried it, I too wore a bra and hip scarf, as Autumn's suggested, and this definitely helped me see if the move and stance was turning out neatly or not.  Each of these flow-bits is to a different piece of music. You can choose to do the entire set of seven with music and no voice cues.

The choreography is meant to see the movements taught in context; technique transforms into dance with the music of Solace - Azure from Iman. I must admit though that I'm not very fond of this piece of music. It's too peaceful for me. This is a full-fledged choreography and it isn't broken down a lot. You will get voice cues for moes that have the moves. You dance to both melody and rhythm. There are patterns in the choreography. The focus is on what Autumn refers to as stylistic integrity. This will be difficult for an absolute beginner to follow because choreography learning skills will not have developed. But otherwise, it's not overdanced or brimming over with gimmicks - it's clean and simple - which means it must be done with perfect technique to be worth looking at.

Again, you can choose a music-only option.

Autumn performs the choreography in costume and also another Autumn-style passionate performance on this video.",1239840000,8,7391,4.685427910562837
3682817,5,B001L9UG6W,"This is a great and detailed intro into basic movements and the down-to-the-bare-bones breakdown of each. This is a great teacher. Her teaching style is very much along the lines of classical dance training and stage performance, as in ballet. I did learn something new on several movements that has helped me perfect them. I also gained several tips on arms and positioning & others that really improved my appearance to the audience (judging from a recent video). The drills are helpful and fun to do. Arms and transitions are a weak area for me & this DVD has helped that too.

One caveat for the beginner: This dancer's style, while flawless and graceful in performance, comes across a little mechanical for my taste, especially during the instruction and drills. I don't know, but I suspect her foundation is in ballet. While I do drill along with the routines, I try not to be so imitative that I look stiff. I like a little earthiness & femininity, and that isn't necessarily easy for me, either. Learn the technique with her, but be sure to watch a lot of performances before you strictly adhere to this particular teacher's style.

An excellent DVD all around, glad I bought it.",1238198400,8,1187,4.729468599033816

This is a perfect starting place for a serious beginner, who is looking for intricate breakdowns of dance vocabulary. I started dancing last year as a way to gain self-esteem and to revisit my passion for dancing (quit in high school thanks to bullies) and this program was the real deal. My only complaint is that I wish the practice sections were a bit longer, but this is something that has been remedied in Autumn's new set of courses on pivotshare (autumnward.pivotshare.com).

Again, an excellent program from an excellent dancer. You won't be disappointed.",1527120000,,638,5.194174757281553

Autumn is obviously a classically trained dancer, and it shows in the way she instructs.  I find her movements to be graceful and precise; so is her instruction.  She does an excellent job of describing the nuances of a movement.***Additional comment October 17, 2016 -- Irina Akulenko's DVDs are also high caliber.

8317734,5,B001L9UG6W,"It's great to find instructional videos from a dancer whose style I admire. It's even better when the quality of the instruction is so close to flawless. I wasn't starting as a beginner, but the reviews here made it clear this is valuable not just for baby bellies. There is so much content on this video, and it's arranged in a way that readily suggests ways to structure practice sessions -- not to mention Autumn's lesson plans, as another reviewer mentioned. Having someone break down each move into its components and offer pointers for form and common pitfalls for each move is very useful for really learning and understanding the moves. This first section might get a little tedious for those seeking a quick ""jump into dancing right away"" video, but it means better technique, right off the bat. Hence, it does what it says on the tin: beautiful technique from step one, indeed. It's certainly cleaning up my technique; I've learned to do a few things ""properly"" that I'd picked up rather loosely (and sloppily). But for those wanting to really learn dance -- not just learn moves but put them together and move with music -- Autumn excels with that, too. The practice flows are a simple, intuitive way to learn how moves go together, and how they go with music (musicality is famously hard to teach, but here it's incorporated so seamlessly bya teacher with flawless musicality that I expect many people can learn the fundamentals of it without having to work too hard at it). They also have the added charm of being short and enjoyable enough that you can fit in a couple on an average evening when you're not able to do a longer segment -- thus encouraging you to practice. Then there's the choreography section...the performances...also wonderful. Granted I am coming at this as an intermediate dancer, but I think her teaching method is probably fantastic for beginners (judging by reviews, that's the case). Not everyone is going to gel with every teaching style, of course, but I think her style would appeal to many. This is fast becoming my favorite BD instructional video.",1412899200,4,2091,4.795013850415512
8317735,4,B001L9UG6W,"This DVD is excellent and it includes the most detailed technique section I have seen, but only for lower body (upper body isolations and footwork are left for other instructional DVD's). All moves are carefully broken down in extreme detail without music (this aspect is very good for total beginners). However, I am not completely sure if this instructional DVD is indeed for total beginners, since Autumn does not include individual practice time for each independent move, your only chance to drill the moves is during the ""flows"". You do not repeat a single move many times but rather string a succesion of moves together in a dance flow. I think for a total beginner it is essential to practice the individual moves before moving on to the flows, specially if you want to ""internalize"" the technique tips Autumn gives in the tutorial section. This is the only reason I gave this DVD 4 stars. If you are looking to buy only one beginner DVD you should also consider that this DVD includes almost no footwork (just basic walking forward and back, layering some basic bellydance lower body movements on top of the walk), no vertical figure 8's (mayas and taxeem) and almost no upper body movements like ""shoulder shimmies"", ""chest circles"", ""chest pops"", ""snake arms"", etc., except for basic arm trajectories. I do not mind, because I have other DVD's that cover this and the detail for lower body movements in this DVD is already a huge bite.

In fact this DVD set and Irina's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Diamond-Cut-Bellydance-Precision-Technique-Practice-for-Beginners-with-Irina-Akulenko-2-DVD-Set-belly-dance/dp/B00EZ6FXHU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Diamond Cut Bellydance: Precision Technique & Practice for Beginners with Irina Akulenko 2-DVD Set - belly dance</a>&nbsp;set are very similar; both sets dedicate the first part to introduce the beginner to bellydance but with different approaches: Autumn explains in detail and breaks down the moves, whereas Irina drills and practices. Not everyone learns the same way, some need the detailed break down, some say that the best practice is the one done while already dancing, while still others prefer to drill individual moves before attempting to dance. In my case I need both the break down and the drills, so for me both sets lack one significant part to be complete for total beginners. The second DVD in both these sets is devoted to practice dance flows of varying difficulty.

EXCELLENT BD DVD'S FOR TOTAL BEGINNERS. I may have other beginner DVD's, but the following are my top pics because all include a detailed tutorial section that break down the moves slowly and without music. Of course tutorials are boring, specially if you are not totally new to BD or if you prefer to learn by dancing from the very first step. However, if you are an absolute beginner in BD, you probably need this instruction, since you need to isolate a lot of muscles you did not even know you could voluntarily move.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Belly-Dance-Basics-Beyond-with-Jenna-Belly-Dancing-Classes-for-a-Solid-Foundation-Bellydance-how-to-belly-dance-technique/dp/B000FSL8WQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Belly Dance Basics & Beyond, with Jenna: Belly Dancing Classes for a Solid Foundation - Bellydance how-to, belly dance technique</a>&nbsp;will provide you one of the most detailed technique sections you will find and probably the most complete one in terms of variety of moves.

Sandra first explains each move, including muscular engagement, posture, etc. without music and also giving you truly interesting background information as to how the move is executed in ""Middle Eastern Dance"" vs other dance forms like ""African"", ""Jazz"", etc. Then she drills each move with excellent drum music, making your drilling much more fun so you do not get bored so easily. However, you would need to buy Vol 1 and 2 and still don't get as many moves as with Jenna.

CARDIO CHALLENGE: Low TONING: Low CHOREOGRAPHY DIFFICULTY: Beginner to Intermediate INSTRUCTIONAL QUALITY: Very good MUSIC: Very good in the practise w/music FUN FACTOR: Good in the practise w/music

CONTENTS:
1) FOUNDATIONS: Very detailed and lengthy (2 hours), starting with four different stances or leg placements (basic stance, staggered stance, etc.) followed by building blocks (like hip sways left- right or forward-back) and finally using the building blocks to form classic bellydance moves, like figure 8's and undulations (only lower body undulations are covered). Every building block is explained starting with the stance you need to be using and then explaining in detail the posture, weight placement and muscles you need to engage or flex, as well as some variations to the basic move. Basic arm trajectories in fluid circles and with broken line technique are explained carefully. I liked how Autumn explained that you can use spiraling (tilting and twisting your upper body downwards and backwards with the arms spread to the side) to change the look of a move; this tiny detail can make your dance look more rounded. Such nuances are normally not covered in beginner DVD's, although they are not so difficult to perform. Special emphasis is also put in the breathing with each movement (where to breathe in or out). She gives plenty of basic points to review, tips and common errors that people do while executing these moves, she tells you for example the following: ""if your head is moving up and down, then you are probably not bending your knees enough"", so you can check yourself in the mirror and with her tips you can figure out the probable root cause of some of the common errors. Unfortunately, the tutorial is a mere break down of the moves without drilling the move together with you. You need to stop the DVD and practice on your own.
2) PRACTICE FLOWS: (1/2 hour) Autumn starts with a brief Intro and a short but very nice warm-up and an excellent arms practice section. She then introduces seven practice flows with music, each of increasing difficulty and speed. During these flows she briefly names the movement and the number of times it will be repeated, then she names the next move, etc. In fact there is no reminding to ""check your posture, engage your abs, etc."" Autumn really believes that by looking into the mirror or camera you will notice that something is wrong and that you will automatically make the correction based on the tips, basic points and errors she mentioned in the tutorial. Maybe you will figure it out, but some reminders could have saved a lot of effort. I think the flows are doable by advanced beginners, but the cueing does not always come in ""advance"" of what you will do next, so she is already executing a movement when she names it, so for total beginners this flows might be difficult to follow. So for me there is a whole section missing in this otherwise very complete teaching method, namely an individual move drilling section.
3) CHOREOGRAPHY: First Autumn gives you a few tips in relation to what you need to consider when doing your own choreography (technique, feeling the music and expressing yourself, repetition and variation, style, creating your own movements, etc.). The choreography itself is a beautiful full piece, with introduction, some accents and a coda or finale, so it's a real choreography, not in ""workout"" format but for beginners, which is extremely rare to find. The only one I have seen before is the final piece in Jenna's Basics DVD, which in fact is a even a bit easier. It is a pleasure to execute this choreo and this is not a coincidence. I think in this section you can really appreciate Autumn's mastery of bellydance, because she put together an excellent choreography for beginners, where everything blends in seamlessly and flows I would say ""miraculously"". The moves themselves are not too difficult (no layering and only a bit of basic footwork), but the speed and putting them all together might be for an advanced beginner to intermediate.
4) PERFORMANCES

MUSIC:
No music in the tutorial section, which is the main part of the DVD. Nice music in the practice flows. Each flow has different music, so you will like some more and some less, but you practice to different speeds and you do not get bored. The music of the choreography piece is excellent, great fun to dance to it.

EMPHASIS:
I would say the emphasis is on good technique for LOWER BODY movements to achieve beautiful and relaxed looking dance. Autumn mentions that making a work of art or in this case, dancing beautifully is possible without having learned technique (some really gifted persons can do it), but achieving it will be much more difficult than if you had learned the basic technique. Almost no upper body movements and footwork patterns are included.

WHAT IS BETTER THAN IN OTHER DVD'S:
+ Detailed tutorial: This is the most detailed explanation of each building block and compound movement you will find
+ Best explanation of how to use your breathing and where exactly to breathe in each movement. Ranya does also explain something on breathing in her&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Baladi-Bellydance-Egyptian-Style-with-Ranya-Rene-TWO-DVD-SET-Open-level-traditional-Egyptian-style-belly-dance-classes-Arabic-style-belly-dance-instruction-Egyptian-bellydancing-how-to/dp/B001JGK4BO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Baladi: Bellydance Egyptian Style, with Ranya Rene (TWO-DVD SET): Open level traditional Egyptian style belly dance classes, Arabic-style belly dance instruction, Egyptian bellydancing how-to</a>&nbsp;but Autumn makes it clearer and you can follow her better. It's a pity there is no drilling of the tutorial, to practice the breathing also together with Autumn (Ranya does no drilling either).
+ THE BEST arm trajectory segment in my collection; beautiful and timeless (it's included as part of the warm-up). Sera does a good job in explaining and practicing arm trajectories in her&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Foundations-of-Bellydance-East-Coast-Tribal-with-Sera-Solstice-Beginner-belly-dance-classes-Full-instruction-East-Coast-Tribal-Style-how-to/dp/B00095VJTC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Foundations of Bellydance: East Coast Tribal, with Sera Solstice: Beginner belly dance classes, Full instruction, East Coast Tribal Style how-to</a>&nbsp;DVD, but Autumn also explains the broken line technique, so she basically also covers the ""folcloric"" and ""tribal"" style trajectories. While you perform the arm exercise section you feel different (kind of transported - don't laugh, it's true!) If I can do arm trajectories as beautifully as Autumn does (head angles and gaze included), I am done with arms.
+ Probably the best full choreography for beginners, all moves are combined carefully so that a beginner can transition between them without too much thinking, this makes it actually fun to dance to.",1397433600,9,12074,5.689578713968958
8317736,5,B001L9UG6W,"I am absolutely new to bellydancing, and I have several instructional DVDs.

I have to say, I think this is one of the best for really getting down good technique of the basic moves.

Autumn is almost surgical in her description of them. She shows you how to do them, then also points out the most common mistakes people make and demonstrates them, so if you're doing them, you can correct yourself and see and understand exactly WHY it's bad.

She'll demonstrate a move, then do it maybe 5-10 times to show you correct technique.  Then there's a section where you practice a few moves at a time to music, with or without her talking over it (the DVD lets you choose).

My only complaint is that she doesn't go over any arm, shoulder or ribcage movements. The focus is on hip, abdominal and leg work.

(Small edit: actually she does show you 4 basic arm moves; they're very basic though)

But overall, her DVD is truly the best place to start if you're really looking for building a truly beautiful, solid technique. I honestly feel confident in my movements, knowing I'm doing them the right way, even if my range is still limited right now. The arm and shoulder movements can come later :)",1368662400,4,1191,4.511627906976744

I haven't done the choreography yet as I'm not up to that level in my skill, so I won't comment on that.
