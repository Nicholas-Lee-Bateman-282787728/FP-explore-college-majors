2768511,3,B000NG45NY,"This film was totally marvelous in its presentation of technological application to understanding our pre-history of the Ice Age. The first time I saw this was on the Discovery channel and completely understandable even without sound. It is this DVD, I am unable to understand -- no captioning or subtitles which was available during the showing on the Discovery Channel. Why not on this format? It was on TV! A delightful presentation of history and one that is collectible on DVD except for the fact -- no captioning or subtitles something that is frequently unavailable in many of the films being released on DVD. For example many of the films by the actor Tony Curtis is lacking in that there is no captioning. I picked him as he recently passed away and the films are still out there without captioning.",1286841600,2,808,4.7785714285714285
2768512,4,B000NG45NY,"Ice Age Columbus contemplates the notion that Europeans migrated to the American continent 17,000 years ago, long before Asians arrived across the Bering strait. This hypothetical history has a compelling story line, is beautifully filmed and provocative.  Did something like this actually happen?  It is exciting (positively or negatively given one's orientation) to imagine that it could be true.  Which leads to the film's weakness.  Of the facts available to substantiate this idea, only a few are presented in the movie, and not particularly well. It feels like arm waving at times. From the not overwhelming presentation of evidence a weak conclusion is drawn, leaving too many key questions unanswered at the end to be fully convincing.  Ending on a weak note does the idea that Europeans discovered America a disservice; a stronger case could have been made.  Nevertheless, for those who are unaware of the european discovery hypothesis the film is well worth watching.  If nothing else, it will leave you with the strong feeling of why isn't more research on this being done.  And, does any of it matter?  Well, yes.  If true, the political consequences alone would be extremely significant.",1285027200,4,1200,5.170984455958549
2768513,5,B000NG45NY,"If you have ever wondered how the North American continent was ever settled before the Europeans or even the Indians for that matter, you might find this CD intriguing and revealing.",1268006400,,182,4.903225806451613
2768514,5,B000NG45NY,"According to the traditional and now obsolete history of the Western hemisphere, the Americas were originally populated by Asians who crossed the Bering Strait land bridge during the last Ice Age. These Paleo-Indians were the ancestors of today's ""Native Americans"" and Europeans didn't come onto the scene until Columbus landed in the Bahamas in 1492. That's the story, anyway.

No one doubts that Asians crossed the land bridge which connected Alaska and Siberia during the Last Glacial Maximum, but a lot of evidence has emerged which suggests that they weren't the first Stone Age people to set foot on the continent. For various reasons, many of them political, these recent discoveries haven't penetrated into our public school system--let alone the public consciousness--but it's clear now that the early history of the Americas is much more complicated than we have been led to believe. The story is one of successive waves of migration from all around the world. In fact, there is reason to believe that the true ""Native Americans"" could have been Solutreans from what is now France.

This is called the Salutrean Hypothesis. Strange as the idea may be to people who have never heard of it before, the idea that the original Americans may have come from Europe is based on solid archeological and DNA evidence. In the first case, various cutting tools like spear points and arrowheads have been discovered in Virginia which were created using Solutrean technology--a Stone Age flint technology which only existed in certain regions in France at that time. The presence of Solutreans in the northeast is also supported by the DNA evidence, which shows that some North American tribes share a common ancestor with present-day Europeans identified by Mitochondrial DNA Hapologroup X. Taken together, these findings suggest that Europeans were probably the first to settle in North America and were later absorbed through intermixing with later migrations from Asia.

Ice Age Columbus, a fantastic documentary from the Discovery Channel, documents this entire story through interviews with scientists involved in the archaeological discoveries and with dramatizations of the way Stone Age hunter-gatherers from Europe could have reached North America by crossing the continuous ice sheet which connected the two continents across the Atlantic Ocean at the time -- a fact which has been verified through Ice Age climate models. Seal hunters, fishermen and tribal outcasts could have walked or floated from Europe to North America, probably ending up on the Grand Bank islands now submerged off the coast of Newfoundland. The prevailing currents at the time flowed from east to west along the edge of the ice cap, so boats would have been carried to the New World as a matter of course. It was a dangerous journey, but it could have been done and probably was done -- repeatedly.

The documentary does a great job in re-creating the harsh and exotic environment of the time. Life was a constant struggle for survival back then. Ice Age North America was full of strange animals like saber-tooth cats, giant ""short-faced"" bears, giant ground sloths, and vast herds of woolly mammoths. At the time, a sheet of ice almost a mile thick reached down as far as as the upper Midwest. This is all re-created through excellent CGI effects. All in all, Ice Age Columbus is a great video if you're interested in the hidden history of North America. Highly recommended.

But it is very entertaining as far as a drama goes.  I thought the acting was great. Unfortunately it is misleading as far as the science goes. Even if Europeans had come over, which the evidence does not support, they would have not evolved light skin yet.

Once you get past the fact that this is not history, but historical fantasy, like Clan of the Cave Bear, it can be very entertaining. Beautiful actress.

This was the time of the last ice age. Half of the Atlantic was covered with ice. People crossed Atlantic in small boats along the edge of the iced region. DNA analysis confirms this theory. Some Indian tribes have a significant admixture of European mtDNA. Another proof is that these people developed unique stone tools, which are found frequently in Europe and same tools are found in America. Carbon dating shows their age is close to 17000 years.

2768518,1,B000NG45NY,"it's nice to put a pack of lies on video and call it science.  where is the dna evidence?  could the first Europeans cross the Atlantic in open boats.  if early Americans really did descend from some European travelers, it could be proven by looking at the DNA in the bones they left.

2768519,5,B000NG45NY,"It may not please the Amerindian or casino lobbies:-) but this documentary offers proof -- and dramatization with excellent actors and script -- of the now decade-old and revolutionary theory that white Europeans arrived in North American very long ago, perhaps 5,000 years before the Siberian Asiatics did over their Alaskan land bridge, and thus that Europeans are (also) Native Americans.  This is the ""Solutrean"" theory, named after Solutr in France. Arrowheads and spear heads from Solutr and other areas of Ice Age France were discovered only in the 1990s in Virginia, and this opened a Pandora's Box of further politically incorrect questions.

This is part of a continuum of new knowledge that got kick-started by the discovery, also in the 1990s, of ""Kennewick Man""'s skeleton inland from Portland, Oregon, who, many scientist insist, was almost certainly a white European -- or rather a ""European-American"" from 10,000 B.C. (Indians demanded that his skeleton be immediately given to them -- for proper Indian burial as per federal law or so it could not be studied?)

Whatever one's leanings, this drama-documentary provides a gripping education regarding Ice Age life for Europeans, the harshness of life then, the huge and dangerous animals they faced and hunted (mammoths) or ran from (saber-tooths) and the incredible character and innovativeness needed to survive a transatlantic journey 17,000 years ago. One learns to truly care for the individuals whom fate first sent over the ocean, and this is based on a minimalist script without any hokey Hollywoodism, fine acting (especially by the actress playing ""Zia"") and interviews with recognized anthropological experts of the Stone Age and ancient North America.

They admit that they themselves were dumbfounded to find unmistakable ancient French hunting implements and other signs of European life in Virginia, all of which through carbon-dating make it certain that Europeans also are Native Americans. This film is touching in many places, rough and realistic but not overly violent, and very highly recommended for the general public, both macho men and the many women interested in the Jean Auel-type sagas, and for serious scholars of serious prehistory.",1186790400,37,2229,5.36

8177579,2,B000NG45NY,"""Ice Age Columbus"" is a Discovery Channel docu-drama, claiming that the Clovis people (long regarded as the first humans to reach the American continent) were White Europeans rather than descendants of Asians. In other words, that America was settled by Whites before American Indians even existed. This White supremacist fantasy comes in many forms, it seems. In this ""lite"" version, the Whites are no longer dominant, thundering ""bearded gods"" who teach the primitives how to read, write and build pyramids. Rather, they are heroic Stone Age hunters who manage to reach North America through the Arctic Sea.

This speculative hypothesis was originally proposed to explain the curious presence of the European genetic marker ""X"" among some American Indian nations, most notably the Ojibwa. The marker seems to be very old, not the result of recent ""racial"" mixture. So where did it come from? The similarity between the Clovis points and similar spearheads found in France, led some daring scientists to propose that a few Stone Age Europeans might have reached the America in prehistoric times, mixing their genes with the Indians. However, nothing in the original hypothesis suggested that Europe was the *only* source of early American settlements. Indeed, there is equally strong genetic evidence suggesting that the Clovis people weren't the original inhabitants of the Americas. Asian-derived peoples probably entered America on a semi-regular basis long before Clovis.

That being said, the White supremacist use of this hypothesis don't surprise anyone who knows how pseudo-historical speculations of this kind have been used before. Book of Mormon enthusiasts are one obvious example, the fracas around Kennewick Man another. Western civilization couldn't cope with the fact that Indians created their own high cultures. Today, when ""primitive"" cultures are seen as just as good or perhaps even better, White supremacists want to claim them, too! Ridiculous. Why creationists have jumped on the bandwagon is less clear, but judging by the flame wars around ""Ice Age Columbus"", some have.

This is not really a criticism of this docu-drama (although I found it boring - it's even somewhat ""politically correct"" with female hunters and peaceful relations between Whites and Indians), but the kind of people it lures out of the woodworks sure makes you wonder...",1376092800,,2369,5.380053908355795
8177580,5,B000NG45NY,"This DVD was bought as a gift to be delivered in August, so I don't know what the recipient will think, but I saw it on television and thought it was very well done. There's an element of soap opera in it which rang false since I don't think they had time to worry about all the romantic drama back then, but the geology is sound as is most of the costuming and weaponry. There is a major question among the experts in reference to who ""discovered"" America first, and this is a plausible theory. This is long on specu-lation, but there is no real proof that it didn't occur as in the scenario presented.",1373241600,,603,4.252173913043478
8177581,4,B000NG45NY,"When I purchased this DVD I thought that I was going to see a very detailed documentary about the first Native Americans and their arrival to the American Continent.  I was quite surprised by what the movie suggested.  Ice Age Columbus discusses how the Eastern US was originally inhabited by tribal cultures from Europe prior to the First Native Americans arriving across the Bering Straits land bridge.  As presented in the documentary, the oldest  Clovis spear point found in the Eastern United States is connected with similar spear points and artifacts discovered in Europe.  The movie demonstrates how the Atlantic Ocean would freeze over allowing  European tribal peoples to arrive in the new Continent after thousands of years of migration.  I found the movie fascinating and extremely educational.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in the Native culture or the history of mankind.",1349049600,5,920,5.168918918918919
