2737606,4,B000MNOY16,"This set contains all the Cisco Kid films starring Gilbert Roland.  Picture (and sound) quality is good, and the adventures - though slow-paced compared with modern story-telling - are good fun.

This Cisco Kid, unlike the Cisco Kid of the TV series, leads a band of outlaws - seeking out corrupt officials, stealing their ill-gotten gains and re-distributing them back to the poor.  At this level, the storylines are all very similar.

Cisco is, of course, irresistable to women.  They instantly tell him all their husband's/brother's guilty secrets - thus enabling him to rob them blind.  And he hands out necklaces (from what must be a vast stockpile) to those he kisses.

He's got a thing about sticking lighted cigarettes behind his ear while he gets on with something else.  Perhaps it looked impressive to audiences of 60 years ago.  Today it just looks stupid.

And there's lots of singing - girls singing in bars, beggars singing in the streets, the outlaw band singing around the campfire.

Each film lasts just over the hour.  Sit down - relax - let the stories take their own time to unroll, and you'll enjoy these films.",1174694400,16,1133,4.813471502590674

BIOS:

1.  Gilbert Roland (aka: Luis Antonio D'maso de Alonso)

Birth Date: 12/11/1905 - Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico

Died: 5/15/1994 - Beverly Hills, California (cancer)

Special footnote, actor Gilbert Roland first major role was as one of Clara Bow's love interests in the collegiate comedy ""The Plastic Age"" (1925). In 1927, he played Armand in Camille opposite Norma Talmadge, with whom he was romantically linked. He went to star opposite Talmadge in several more films but when sound ended her career, Roland's voice was well suited for the new medium and his career continued uninterrupted. He starred in several Spanish language adaptations of American films and continued as a romantic lead ... Beginning in the 1940s, Roland's roles became smaller but critics began to take notice of his acting and he was praised for his supporting roles in John Huston's ""We Were Strangers"" (1949), ""The Bad and the Beautiful"" (1952), and ""Cheyenne Autumn"" (1964). He also appeared in a series of films in the mid 40s as the popular character ""The Cisco Kid."" Catholic viewers probably know him best as Hugo, the agnostic (and totally fictional) friend of the three shepherd children in ""The Miracle of Our Lady of Fatima"", which is based on the apparitions of Our Lady of Fatima in 1917. His last appearance was in the 1982 western movie Barbarosa ... Roland died of cancer in 1994 at the age of 88. Roland was nominated twice for a Golden Globe Award, for his roles in ""The Bad and the Beautiful"" (1952) and ""Cheyenne Autumn"" (1964) ... (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

8170346,4,B000MNOY16,"Gilbert Roland is wonderful.  The silver screen just loves him and he is completely at ease on it.  That said, these Cisco Kid films are slight (and rather repetitive) on plot and many of the subsidiary actors are pretty wooden.  The pace is slow in each of the movies, but I still found them entertaining because of the humor and because Gilbert Roland is simply compelling to watch.  However, he smokes constantly, and though he handles it elegantly, it still gets strangely tiring to see the chain smoking.  So, if you're a fan of Gilbert Roland, these films will probably be enjoyable.  Otherwise, you may be disappointed.",1378684800,,626,4.803738317757009
8170347,5,B000MNOY16,"This is a very good set of all 6 of the Gilbert Roland ""Cisco Kid"" series.  Video and audio is quite good, the films are not all spliced up, and they appear to be complete.  Great entertainment.",1357257600,,194,4.216216216216216
8170348,1,B000MNOY16,"I would have to classify Gilbert Roland as being the all-time worst actor to ever play the Cisco Kid on the screen. He should be called the ""Marlboro Man"" instead of the ""Cisco Kid."" His constant chain-smoking was anything but sexy in this low-budget series of Westerns.

Also, I found his contant posturing to the camera to appear sexy and a real ""ladies man"" very annoying. And speaking of ladies, they are all treated with arrogance, indifference, and disrespect throughout these films. Roland should have thrown his pistol away and put a hand mirror in his holster so he could whip it out and gaze at himself whenever he pleased. And I'm sure that would have been quite often.

There is an incredible lack of action in the Roland Cisco Kid movies. He rides around with his own (I assume) protective army, but they basically do nothing. They do, however, sing a high pitched, badly dubbed, happy-go-lucky song sometimes as they are riding along to the next place where they can camp out and do nothing.

Roland must have smelled like a walking ashtray as he roamed the West. How any woman could get near him is the real mystery in this little series. Also, those ""Cisco Was Here"" token necklaces looked like they were purchased in bulk at a five and dime store. These he gave away to women as some sort of reminder that they had been ""lucky"" enough to listen to him mumble sweet nothings in their ears while his cigarette dangled from his lips. Yuck.

I would recommend any other actor who ever played the Cisco Kid over Gilbert Roland. In my opinion, this Cisco Kid series is a total waste of time.",1316736000,2,1602,4.571428571428571
8170349,4,B000MNOY16,"Gilbert Roland brought his own brand of suavity and charm to this role.  He is a delight to watch as he charms the ladies.  Had he been some years younger and not  Hispanic, he could have made an impressive James Bond.  Production values are quite good and the acting is top-notch, with such established performers as Evelyn Brent appearing in supporting roles.",1279152000,5,361,4.774193548387097

8170351,4,B000MNOY16,"Gilbert Roland supposedly did only the 6 Cisco Kid movies in this collection. I have no way to verify if that is true, but if it is, it is sad that he didn't do zillions more! Gilbert Roland is fabulous in this character, as if the character was made specifically for him. Roland adds color, nuance and dimension to the character that was never duplicated by the other actors who portrayed Cisco. Roland is absolutely the best and most delightful Cisco Kid. Duncan Renaldo, who portrayed Cisco the most often of any actor, couldn't quite fill Roland's shoes, although Renaldo's episodes are enhanced by the colorful portrayal of Pancho by actor Leo Carillo. Carillo played the best Pancho ever, but he was not in any of Roland's movies. No matter, because Gilbert Roland doesn't need any other character to enhance his Cisco. It is exceptional.

I would have given 5 stars to this set, except that there is one puzzling flaw: In most of the movies in this set, everytime an actor says the words ""Cisco Kid"", those words are dubbed in rather than part of the original dialog. There is no explanation as to why this was done.  The dubbing is done so sloppily that it is always obvious and disconcerting. It is not a major flaw, but it is bad enougt for me to subtract 1 star, and give the set an overall rating of 4 stars. However, these movies are so enjoyable and delightful that you should not let this one flaw deter you from purchasing the set. And other than the dubbing, the overall sound and picture quality is surprisingly good for such old and relatively low budget movies.

Like I said before, I wish Gilbert Roland had done zillions more Cisco Kid movies! He's my favorite!",1264464000,8,1683,4.584717607973422
8170352,5,B000MNOY16,"Being an ""old"" Western Movie fan (emphasis on old) I had to have this because, in my humble opinion, Gilbert Roland Is the only Cisco Kid worth watching. Are the movies ""hokey"" compared to today's standards? Of course they are; But they are still ejoyable,except for maybe the first one - it's a little too hokey. The transfer to DVD is decent and I recommend 5this set to anyone enjoying the old movies out of Hollywood.",1245196800,2,421,4.552631578947368
8170353,3,B000MNOY16,"Gilbert Roland was the forth actor to play the Cisco Kid.  Some in these reviews rate him among the top, but alas I cannot agree with that assessment.  Warner Baxter was the first to play Cisco in ""The Arizona Kid"", a role that would win him an Oscar.  He was actually better in the sequel ""The Cisco Kid"" which is my favorite movie in the series. Several years later he would return, but the series had become a low budget project and he was a bit too old and plump for the role.  Cesar Romero, who played a henchman in Baxter's last film would take the role for six films, one of which appears to be lost.  Romero was charming and entertaining and Chris-Pin Martin added humor to the series.  The next Cisco is the one most people associate with the role, Duncan Renaldo.  He did three films before giving the role up to Roland, all with Martin Garralaga as Pancho.  He would return for five more films with Leo Carrillo and of course for the television series.  Renaldo was less of a rogue than the other actors and his only vice was his love for the ladies.  I found Roland's smoking to be a bit too much, and as mentioned in a previous review, the habit of putting lit cigarettes behind his ear was pretty lame.  Like Baxter in his last film, I thought Roland was a bit too old and there was a decided lack of action in his films.  But, this is a nice set of films and if you're a fan of the Cisco Kid it's wonderful to be able to own the Roland series on nicely produced DVD's.  I'm happy to have the set in my collection of the films which is complete except for ""The Gay Caballero"" with Romero that again appears to be lost.  I hope one day the other films will be available commercially as well.",1190073600,5,1704,4.219135802469136
