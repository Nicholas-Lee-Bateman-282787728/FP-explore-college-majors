6931110,5,B00RG5VVM8,"I enjoyed  this  documentary very much. It reminded me of Scorsese's ""The Last Waltz."" The off camera questions with Victor were very real and credible. I also liked  the behind the scenes of an artist, his business and family. I recommend this film.",1428969600,2,250,4.767441860465116
6931111,1,B00RG5VVM8,"I love their tenacity and vigor, but the sense of aloofness about the history of art and the art market is just hilarious to me. Talk about delusion and contradictions. Bunch of show ponies. Yeah, definitely no ""magnetism"" here for your work.",1428537600,2,242,4.785714285714286

8695305,4,B00RG5VVM8,"It must be very difficult to live with an eogist like this Victori.  He says he's influenced by nothing or no one (although he made dozens of copies of the Mona Lisa and has art books on his desk) and has invented his own movement.  His work isn't bad--as if I'm some expert; not.  He seemed to be an excellent portraitist and painted many famous people, but his personality is so off-putting.  It's an interesting documentary on a narcissistic man whose son (after losing his job) decided to try and promote him.  Victori is boring to listen to and arrogant.  Even at his own NYC Expo booth, he didn't talk to people looking at his work.  One gets tired of him quickly in this documentary, but one has to admire the tenacity of his son and his wife.",1483488000,,750,4.391304347826087
8695306,5,B00RG5VVM8,As an artist Victori  was interesting... awesome work ... so glad i watched,1476921600,,75,4.769230769230769
8695307,1,B00RG5VVM8,"I thought Ed took the center stage trying to make his father something he may never be.  Somehow I believe it was almost all about what a wonderful art promoter Ed is.  I didn't think much of the film.  I find Victori to be a very fine portrait artist, but his many imaged productions aren't really new.  Duchamp:
Nude Desending a Staircase.",1467417600,,341,4.451612903225806
8695308,4,B00RG5VVM8,"Success has its costs, it can have its valleys... Even for the very well known. A frank look at one approach to growing a successful business to support two families while allowing the artist to explore his creativity.",1466812800,,218,4.7631578947368425
8695309,1,B00RG5VVM8,Terrible art. Terrible movie,1463788800,,28,6.25
8695310,4,B00RG5VVM8,"Very interesting with widely different characters!  As an artist who has spent years studying the modern art scene only to find it FILLED with BS, I liked this film.  The artist actually had a few good pieces despite all the cheesy stuff, his philosophy was in fact very right on (about Warhol and dishonesty in art: he makes cheesy stuff for money but he is honest about it), I found him very truthful.  The wife was much cheesier and money-grubby than the artist, the son was young and naive and followed the mother's angle in life.  The director was a smart ass a*hole.  We should not be making fun of this artist but see a little bit of ourselves in these people.",1456531200,,667,4.434426229508197
8695311,1,B00RG5VVM8,"If you enjoy the painful early episodes of American Idol in which deluded, no-talent artists go on and on about themselves and then get humiliated in public, this is the movie for you.",1451347200,,184,4.606060606060606
8695312,5,B00RG5VVM8,"Being an artist myself, I live in another world than most people. So I don't want everyone to take my word on this video. I believe to discover for yourself is a truly magical thing, so do it!",1446768000,,192,4.078947368421052
8695313,3,B00RG5VVM8,"A well-crafted film about a man with skill and drive but no imagination.  Victori is a Korean immigrant who made a fortune painting affordable portraits for the masses.  He has an engagingly detached personality and floats gently in and out of the film while his co-stars, a son and wife, display their sincere and sometimes touching devotion to Victori's merit.  The focus of the story is Victori's ill-conceived foray into fine art produced from his ""original"" idea that the passage of time can be portrayed on a single canvas.  Marcel Duchamp's 1912 masterpiece Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2?  Never heard of it.  The climax comes with the debut exhibition of Victori's new work in a Costco-scale art fair in New York.  The filmmakers say all that needs to be said by catching the passersby completely ignoring the work or reacting with bemusement.",1436745600,7,856,4.944055944055944
