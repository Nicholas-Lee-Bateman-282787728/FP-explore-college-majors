8714560,5,B00WY0MGAG,"Relentlessly corrosive to the soul or important art..?

The question posed by David Foster Wallace (""Infinite Jest""). The answer: both.

Paraphrasing DFW:

The show is relentlessly corrosive to the soul in that everything is parodied and everything is ridiculous. You can watch about an hour of it and than you have to go out and commune with nature for a bit, go look at a flower or something.

This addresses the weird conflict between our ""inner sap,"" the part of us that can wholeheartedly weep at stuff, and the part of us that has to live in a world of smart, jaded, sophisticated people and wants very much to be taken seriously by these people.

We're tyrannized by the fashions that are so easy to criticize but that are so incredibly powerful and authentic-seeming when we're inside them.

DFW right on target? I think so.",1514246400,,832,4.703448275862069
