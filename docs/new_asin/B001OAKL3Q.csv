I caught most of this special on the History Channel and thought it would be a good gift for him - and it was.  The extra DVD on President Obama was a great addition. A thoughtfully made, thorough, well-directed, refreshingly non-partisan and fair assessment of the presidencies of our past leaders. This is a must-have. Enjoy!",1290988800,,463,4.716049382716049
