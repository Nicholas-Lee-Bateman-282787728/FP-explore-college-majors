5466102,5,B00APQGUD0,"The Diary of Preston Plummer is beautifully photographed and acted. The young male and female leads are convincing in their roles of young graduates who drive to Florida and confront her disturbed past. The beautiful Amelia island setting is like another character in the movie. Rumer's grandfather in the film is played by a well known actor- probably the best known face in this independently made film. It is well worth seeing and telling your friends about. A welcome change from the action/gross comedies/horror films that dominate American film making. Kudos to Dr. Ackerman who took a year off to produce and direct this film, which he also wrote.",1334880000,5,654,5.009174311926605

5466115,1,B00APQGUD0,"There are so many things wrong with this film, I do not know where to begin.  If you can get past the amateur editing job and the horrible script that sounds like improv, the storyline is not too bad.  Of course you need to suspend all belief.  The story of a deceitful mother who sacrifices her daughter's psyche for her own personal gain is a fabulous one.  I just wish they would have floated the idea to someone who could write, actors who could act and an editor who could edit.  The cinematography is second rate at best with the desire to try to make an artsy film by showing wildlife and shutters during pivotal moments.  The two lead actors might have been able to do a bette job if they hadn't had to work with such a terrible script.  In the author's desire to try to have natural dialogue, he missed depth.

Finally, the ending is stupid.  This was, at best, a perfectly wonderful waste of time in which I did not have to think or care.  With so many fabulous love stories out there, please do not waste your time.",1482192000,3,1026,4.296875

5466122,5,B00APQGUD0,"A film well worth the five stars I've given it.  Such a welcome departure from the action, horror, thriller, detective, cops and robbers, etc. films which permeate the market in ever increasing numbers.  Sit and watch a calm, beautifully filmed romantic film, and find yourself thoroughly engrossed in the family dynamics which make this story not only credible, but will grab you by the arms and drag you willingly into each scene, each piece of each puzzle, and will not let you go.  Well acted, well directed, the mood of the film will remain with me, and it's that mood which I would like to see more often in today's films.",1479513600,,628,4.63963963963964

On top of this, the acting was fairly mediocre, and the dialogue was again pretentious when it was not stupid. With the possible exception of the grandfather, the other characters were shallow and phony. The character of Preston Plummer exhibited his serious dedication to science by the purposeful giant holes he made on his jeans' knees.

5466150,4,B00APQGUD0,"nothing quite like an adult woman finding out her hymen was still intact years after her abusive mother lied to make her believe she had been raped by her grandfather.  More than a bit ""dark"" that the mother felt so economically ""deprived"" by her environmentalist father as to create that lie to extort a portion of his land for building a money leaching ""resort"" hotel.  Not unusual for a feloniously enslaved husband to have gone along with his ""insane"" wife's machinations against her father and daughter, even to the point of denying his own daughter the medical care she needed after falling out of a tree near her grandfather's house.  A cheering end note that ""Preston Plummer"" was able to help Katie resolve the lies even if he wasn't able to help the dying grandfather.",1476144000,,778,4.7481481481481485

5466155,5,B00APQGUD0,"If you've ever been to one of these southern sea islands, than yes, things do move slower.  And though the plot may seem to lack action/speed, it really stays true to the occasion and location...while focusing on the long-held secret and deception of a mother driven to scandal, lies and threats, to obtain and maintain the highly-valuable property of her dying father.  It is Preston who courageously confronts the matter through personal observation/interviews and local court records, while risking a new-found romance, and is able to finally rectify the reasons for the rift (with the father).  An excellent dramatization into the deceptions that can (and do) damage and even destroy families, leaving one permanently disparate from another. Time and tenacity can reveal truth.",1441929600,4,781,5.333333333333333

This is a movie not a documentary of Florida so with that said I will say that thus movie have a good plot.  The only thing I didn't like was the ending.  I wish they would of go a bit more on detail.  And that is why I gave the movie 4 stars out of 5.,1377734400,,388,3.740740740740741

5466161,5,B00APQGUD0,"The Diary of Preston Plummer is an intriguing and unusual love story. This is not just a tale of boy meets girl, but a story of two emotionally fragile young adults who over time come to understand their own complicated histories while learning to love and trust one another. Many a romance film fall into predictable formulas, but this film is full of surprising twists and turns bringing the viewer on a journey through the challenges and healing that can develop even in the most difficult of circumstances. I strongly recommend this movie to those wanting not just a love story, but a vicarious exposure to trauma, healing, and recovery.",1337904000,3,641,4.836363636363636

5466163,5,B00APQGUD0,"This film captures so well the feeling that a place can create. It really transports me back to that dreamy time at the end of college with big expectations and big uncertainties. With few actual ties, those connections with a physical place can feel so strong. I really loved the performances, which were quiet and solid. Diary of Preston Plummer is a love letter to that time in our lives when we can fall in love and at the same time fall in love with a place. I will re-watch this movie to be transported to that feeling.",1335571200,,525,4.36734693877551
5466164,1,B00APQGUD0,"After the hype about this film and reading the reviews, there isn't much positive to say about it. Trevor and Robert Loggia's acting are great, but the plot moved too slow and it's been done before. The constant buzz about Amelia Island being the setting would have been enough to captivate me seeing my hometown, but there was hardly any of it in the film. I believe the intentions were good, but it awful.",1335484800,2,407,4.513513513513513

I know Sean Ackerman from the hospital but I was impressed to see that not only is he a great doctor but also a great writer, producer and director too!  The movie pulled me in and kept me wondering where the storyline was going to go next.  It is unbelievable that it was done on such a low budget.  I thought that the acting and storyline were at the same level as those with multi-million dollar budgets!  The actors were well suited for the parts and I look forward to more of his films in the future!",1335139200,2,571,4.299065420560748
5466166,1,B00APQGUD0,"This movie does not meet expectations. All of the local hype was just that, hype. The sights were beautiful and the plot had so much potential but the film fell short of actual entertainment. What's the saying, ""So close but no cigar.""",1335052800,3,235,4.619047619047619
5466167,5,B00APQGUD0,"Sean Ackerman's ""The Diary of Preston Plummer"" opens with a beautiful scene that sets up a lyrical and rich self-reflexive atmosphere. First an arm chair and then other pieces of furniture, even cutlery, are filmed as they descend slowly to the bottom of a pool. Suddenly, a woman's body dives into this underwater scene. Water, as a symbol of the unconscious, is a central motif in Ackerman's gracefully-written psychological drama. The journey of the protagonist, Preston Plummer, into the troubled domestic world of his girlfriend's family builds slowly into an everyman's journey. It's a brilliant exploration of how people see, of how they construct their own light and dark realities. Part love story, part road movie and part family saga, Ackerman peels the layers off one at a time. With the help of convincing performances by Trevor Morgan and Rumer Willis (Bruce Willis and Demi Moore's daughter), we're made to wonder if things are destined to fall apart just as they come together. Entropy is one of the leitmotifs of Preston's story, but so is cognition itself. The Florida landscape, filmed convincingly, although with a minimalist sensibility dictated by the filmmaker's tiny budget, conveys plenty of dramatic tension, often shifting between images of a pristine wilderness and crass commercial development. Ackerman's real gift is in exploring the inner landscape of his characters, but there's a hint of conflict within the filmmaker himself, a tension between art and science that his film leaves unresolved. I recommend this indie drama highly.

This film is like an elegant origami piece - simple from one vantage, giving a neat narrative with an incredibly well written plot, but also complex in terms of its characters and their journeys. From its first scene this film is gripping and literally takes the viewer into the depths of the story and scenery. As the drama unfolds we are treated to Dr. Ackerman's mature understanding of light, vista and the long panoramic shot to convey exquisitely beautiful scenes of Amelia Island, Florida. I was so moved by this movie that I went back to see it for a second time. This allowed me to appreciate the subtle nuances and the technical achievements much better. A true artist, Dr. Ackerman (who wrote, directed and produced the film) who made this film on a very small budget and was able to create a work of art that is suffused with integrity and talent.

5466174,5,B00APQGUD0,"A true masterpiece of cinematography! It is exceptionally well-written, acted, and directed. As I try to look for words in my vocabularly to describe the movie, all I keep ending up with is ""beautiful"". Absolutely breathtaking, beautiful, almost magic scenery of a small island off the coast of Florida adds a very special color to this film.

""The Diary of Preston Plummer"" is a though-provoking powerful drama that inspires discussion and moves deepest emotions. It is tragic. It is emotionally-riveting. It is romantic. It is funny. It is touching. It is lyrical.
It is...beautiful. I only wish there were more movies like this today.

Stunning & powerful performance by Trevor Morgan, Rumer Willis, Christopher Cousins, and particularly strong performance by Erin Dilly who plays a neurotic mother in the movie. It is an artistic triumph and a masterpiece of a young director Sean Ackerman, who is, interestingly enough, also an M.D. in one of the major hospitals in the country.

This movie will make even the most experienced film makers to take note, and will leave the most refined and the most sophisticated fans of high quality cinema spellbound. The musical score, the cinematography and the direction are all astounding. The story makes you ponder over life, death, love, family, disease, pain, fears, trauma, forgiving...

It is an intelligent and beautiful work of cinematography with meaningful little details in every single scene.

I highly recommend this movie!",1334880000,12,1479,5.223628691983122
