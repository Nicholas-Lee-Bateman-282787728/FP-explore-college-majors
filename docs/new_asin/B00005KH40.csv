7943185,1,B00005KH40,there seems to be a dual movie that starts out as what the movie title say's  10 magnificent killers and then changes to another  movie with about 40 different fight scene's ...weird ..it's like they laid one movie on top of another on the same sided disc ...or something weird like that ? over all it's a bad buy ?,1446508800,,315,4.233333333333333

7943187,5,B00005KH40,"You Jiven me Man?! This is one of my favorites of Yang Sze classic Kung Fu flicks. The story is great the action is fantastic and not just for a classic 70's/80's Kung fu flick. If you are from the old skool of Kung fu flicks and you know who you are, this is going to be quite enjoyable. Had no idea this rap group bought these movies up and made their own line. Fantastic is all I can say. I am a Yang fan (Bolo Yeung) and this is one of my favs next to Chinese Hercules and The fists, the kicks, and the evils. Yang is tops with me. I am an original Bruce Lee fan and saw all his movies in the theaters when they first came out. I always had a liking for Yang and pretty much followed him later into the years.",1346284800,,713,3.857142857142857
7943188,1,B00005KH40,"Bolo is in the flick, but not for an hour! The martial arts is terrible, poorly choregraphed and the plot is horrible. The navigation menu is tight, the extras rule but not the film. If you want to see a real kungfu movie, buy Jade Claw, Master Killer, Five Deadly Venoms, Enter the Dragon, or Jet Li's Fist of Legend. Thats Kungfu a$$ kicking 101! As for ""10 Magnificent Killers"", I think I will just give it away.",1007164800,5,415,4.333333333333333
7943189,5,B00005KH40,"This has 10 killers going at it! The Wu has picked some jewels for they Hidden Chamber series. It's THE BEST DVD series out there. All the films are tight including this one. It's got BOLO and some other dudes that I recognize from alot of flicks. The bonus features are heavy including a 10 mag fights chamber that has the dopest fights I've ever seen put together. This is ... that was held back in china or something cuz I've never seen them before. The Wu chamber is tight as ever,and the master's chamber has real Shaolin monks dropping jewels. Then there's the 18 Fatal previews chambers showing other Grond Zero flicks,plus the non kung fu ... like Blazin',which is also tight. Get these Hidden Chamber flicks on DVD. ....Peace!!!!",997315200,2,738,4.641221374045801
