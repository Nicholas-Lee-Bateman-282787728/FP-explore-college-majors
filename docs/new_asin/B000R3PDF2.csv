8198722,4,B000R3PDF2,"The set includes a few ""essential"" Roger Corman titles and is good as a introductory purchase to sample the work of Mr. Corman.  Many of the ""better"" films are available in better quality releases.  Here's what you get:

""Creature from the Haunted Sea"" (1961)- picture: FS fair+.  This has a better WS release on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Roger-Corman-Puerto-Rico-Trilogy/dp/B000BVNS98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Roger Corman Puerto Rico Trilogy</a>

""A Bucket of Blood"" (1959) print: good.  This has a better release on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Bucket-of-Blood/dp/079284680X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Bucket of Blood</a>

""The Little Shop of Horrors"" (1960) print: fair+.  Again, a better release is available on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Little-Shop-of-Horrors-in-Color/dp/B001BSBBGM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Little Shop of Horrors in Color</a>.  While it includes a colorized version the original BW is included in a very good print.

""The Wasp Woman"" (1961) print: very good.  While this one is a WS version it is *not* anamorphic.  You can find what appears to be the same print in a anamorphic WS version on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Drive-In-Discs-Vol-2-The-Wasp-Woman-The-Giant-Gila-Monster/dp/B0000A0WID/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Drive-In Discs, Vol. 2: The Wasp Woman/The Giant Gila Monster</a>&nbsp;along with a good print of ""The Giant Gila Monster"" also in WS.

""The Terror"" (1963) print: good.  The print used has fairly good color but is rather contrasty.  It's one of the better non-restored prints I've seen.  However, the best print of this film is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Terror-Blu-Ray-DVD-Combo-Pack/dp/B004I3Z6G8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Terror [Blu-Ray + DVD Combo Pack</a>] which has both BR and DVD.

""The Last Woman on Earth"" (1961) print: good *but* is FS and BW.  The&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Roger-Corman-Puerto-Rico-Trilogy/dp/B000BVNS98/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Roger Corman Puerto Rico Trilogy</a>&nbsp;has the best copy of this in color and WS.

""She Gods of Shark Reef"" (1958) print: poor-fair.  While there's a single release,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/She-Gods-of-Shark-Reef/dp/B000087F1N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">She Gods of Shark Reef</a>, the print looks to be the same as the one here.

""Swamp Women"" (1955) print: fair but in BW.  This one has a couple of single releases in prints that are roughly the same as here although&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Swamp-Women/dp/B0001MMF4G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Swamp Women</a>&nbsp;from BCI/Eclipse (now OOP) is color but it's murky and poor quality.

""Ski Troop Attack"" (1960) print: fair-poor.  Again there are several single releases which all seem to use the same print.

""Atlas"" (1961) print: poor-fair.  This is a FS version in which the image is pulled from the center of a WS frame and frequently chops off both people who are speaking leaving only the scenery between them as the image.  It's the only peplum Corman did and in spite of some production problems is quite watchable as far as story goes.  This, too, has a couple of single release which seemingly use the same print as on this set.  This film is in need of restoration.

As mentioned by another reviewer each disk has a spoken intro of ""St Clair Vision Presents"" in black before the first feature on each disk.  It's annoying but doesn't really intrude on the films.

Overall, all of the films are watchable and if you can get this rather inexpensively it's a good introductory set to Roger Corman's early works.",1366416000,6,3911,6.838383838383838
8198723,5,B000R3PDF2,"Okay the elements used for this 3 DVD set are not in the greatest shape,but for the 4.50 + tax i payed at Dollar Genaral it was $ well spent,Includes the classics: The Little Shop Of Horrors,A Bucket Of Blood,The Wasp Woman,and The Terror,also included are lesser known gems:Atlas,Swamp Women(aka Swamp Diamonds),The Last Woman On Earth,Creature From The Haunted Sea,She Gods Of Shark Reef and Ski Troop Attack,the only gripes I have w/ this set are B/W versions of Swamp Women and The Last Woman On Earth,as these were originally in colour.there is also spokenvery brief spoken intos(""St Clair Vision Presents"") on Creature...,The Wasp Woman,and She Gods...,the first feature that's on each of the three discs,overall a nice collection of cheapies directed by Roger Corman. It even includes classic Corman trailers,Corman Poster Gallery,and a Corman Trvia Quiz!",1239753600,10,862,5.299270072992701
8198724,3,B000R3PDF2,"I bought this since no one who reviewed it could give any technical details like what actual movies are included in this collection. I was hoping for one or two of the following, Not of this Earth, Day the World Ended, Attack of the Crab Monsters or The Undead. 'Course none of these are included.
Here's what you get:
Disc One:
Creature from the Haunted Sea (1961)-picture: decent- sound: decent, movie: really, really bad (one of Corman's worst)
Bucket of Blood (1959)picture: good, sound: decent, movie: good
Little Shop of Horrors (1960) picture: pretty bad, sound: decent, movie: very good
Disc Two:
Wasp Woman (1961 presented widescreen 1.85:1) picture: good, sound: decent, movie: good
The Terror (1963 color)
The Last Woman on Earth (1961)picture, good, sound: decent, movie:
Disc Three:
She Gods of Shark Reef (1958)
Swamp Women (1955)
Ski Troop Attack (1960)
Atlas (1961 color).
The picture appears to be decent to good (The Terror looks pretty washed out) with just ok sound. I'll add more details after i watch these ""masterpieces.""",1208822400,78,1044,5.040462427745664
8198725,5,B000R3PDF2,"Roger Corman knows how turn out a movie. Sure most are low budget and silly, but almost all of his movies have a fun quality about them that sets them apart from most of the 50's and 60's drive-in flicks.
  St. Clair DVD collections are always well made and this one is no different. The films picked show a wide range of Corman's films and are great fun to watch. Well worth the price!",1188432000,15,386,4.202702702702703
