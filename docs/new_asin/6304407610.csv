7871534,5,6304407610,"These VHS tapes of the ""Incredible World of Cats"" are extremely enjoyable as you watch cats and kittens romp and play with their loving owners. You also learn the amazing history of cats and how they became the number one pet for many homes.",1317081600,,241,4.5
7871535,5,6304407610,"Recorded on two VHS tapes (although it could fit on one VHS tape at SP), and packaged in a thick but quasi-luxurious box, it does a good job of balancing the various topics as they relate to cats, ranging from the ancient times to today's world. Very interesting to watch, lots of useful information about cats, and lots of cats in it too :)",1155686400,4,341,4.34375
7871536,4,6304407610,"I love the ""Cats"" video, but it teases us with clips from Armando Acosta's All-Cat Romeo-Julet (1990) video, which has become more rare than the dinosaur! I think I've searched the known universe, but somebody, somewhere, must know how to get it out of ""moratorium""...the time is ripe to resurrect this treasure!",1092787200,3,312,5.019230769230769
7871537,4,6304407610,"This is an enjoyable documentary that is great for the cat lover...
It is short and informative illustrating the history and nature of cats. It shows a wide variety of cats and highlights remarkable cats such as a mother cat who saved her kittens from a burning building. The photography is bright and cheerful and captures the personality of each cat portrayed such as Hemmingway's 6-toed cats.",1090022400,2,395,4.91044776119403
7871538,3,6304407610,"Note to Anne Hurley who wrote the ""official"" review:
Armando Acosta is NOT an Italian director. He is an American of Spanish heritage who currently resides in Belgium.  Not sure why she thought he is Italian.",1017619200,4,208,4.777777777777778
7871539,5,6304407610,"I and my children (even my husband who is not a cat fan) enjoyed this video set very much.  It takes one through the many aspects and personalities of cats.  Including a visit to the famous Ernest Hemmingway House and the decendants of his famous six toed cat, a cat show, commercials and the training of the stars, as well as candid home shots and cats in their natural domestic lives, even cat heros!  (They even play ""Jingle Cats"" music video which is said to be a favorite teaser to these furry companions who go bananas trying to find the cat in the speaker! :) )I enjoyed the interviews with some ""experts"" such as the presidents of the SPCA and national cat shows and their insights into their lives and behavior.  This is deffinately a video for one who enjoys all aspects of a cat and their diversity in personality!",985564800,13,825,4.48
