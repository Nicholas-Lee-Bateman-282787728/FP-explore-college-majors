8362036,3,B001G9CNU4,"In CRAIG, the title character is left on his own after his sister's house burns down. Craig is an adult w/ severe mental issues. He's on heavy medication, and sees a therapist. CRAIG feels guilt and anger about his sister's being in a coma. After a series of negative and humiliating experiences in front of women, Craig becomes increasingly obsessed w/ sex, while spiraling into a violent fantasy world. Craig spends his evenings surfing online escort services. In his spare time, Craig hangs out at bars and strip clubs w/ his best friend. This is never a good experience for him. Craig keeps hearing voices, sometimes from his television, telling him to ""do what he knows he should do"". When Craig finally has an escort over to his place, it's yet one more awful experience. Craig snaps, murdering the young lady in an alley. Thus begins Craig's ultimate descent into madness. CRAIG is a rather perverse tale, containing no likeable characters at all. Craig himself is a crazed murderer w/ no hope or possibility of redemption. While certainly not a ""feel good"" movie, it does portray the main character in a realistic, though quite reprehensible manner. It's nearly impossible to feel anything other than revulsion for him, no matter how psychologically sick he may be! Others have commented on the copious nudity in the film. It's part of the story, due to its being part of Craig's world. The main complaint I have is its length. It could have had about 20-30 minutes shorn off without losing anything. At 100 minutes it seems looonnnggg! CRAIG is a bleak, cold, low-budget movie. Expect no light...",1393286400,2,1605,4.861313868613139

Amazon, you need to remove ""Craig"" from your streaming list and re-evaluate what you have to offer your Prime members.
How this movie ever received 3 stars is beyond me! This thing belongs in the trash because that's what it is - TRASH!
People, don't wast your time.",1374364800,,398,4.527777777777778
8362038,1,B001G9CNU4,"All I will say is that there is enough nudity in this to fill a magazine. Very bad. Was not expecting it and disapointing. There was no warning either.
I am angry about this. Please put warnings up when there is full or partial nudity in a film.",1347408000,3,245,4.125
