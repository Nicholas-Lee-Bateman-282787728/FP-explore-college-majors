3666549,3,B001KMH8FM,"This dvd was much anticipated ever since I stumbled across the guitar principles web site a while back.  I've heard of Ney Mello and his ""revolutionary"" picking technique in the forums for some time and decided to take a chance on the DVD when it came out.

The DVD is very informative.  It does break down the actual movements with demonstrations preceding actual explanations of the motions involved.  This is good.  I've been looking for a DVD such as this for a while now.  Where it lacks are exercises to help augment the techniques learned.  Sure Ney Mello goes into how to pick, where to position the arm, the rotation of the forearm and it's role in picking..  But no specific scalar exercises or even arm stamina exercises are mentioned.  Except if you consider Ney's little workout with exercise bands a stamina exercise.  Another example is a demonstration on the DVD of him playing a scale on the electric guitar.  He then tells the viewer it's a blues scale but doesn't say which key, which notes or how practicing the scale will improve the techniques learned.  Often I got the feeling he was ""showboating"" his technique.

I did enjoy the DVD and it does contain a wealth of knowledge but after viewing it I realized this.  Yes, there is a right and wrong way to pick.  But analyzing one's own technique and finding a way to correct it themselves if it hinders them is optimal.  Everyone is different and what works for Ney Mello will not work for someone else.  I do understand what he teaches in the DVD are proven methods and I do believe he is a good teacher.  However, I think really examining the techniques of your idols and trying to adapt their methods to your style is more beneficial.

John McLaughlin and Al DiMeola have different styles than Ney Mello and personally I would prefer viewing an instuctional DVD of them instead of ""Maximum Speed Picking.""",1232323200,8,1880,4.642424242424243
3666550,5,B001KMH8FM,"This is the ""Real Deal"" for professional right hand picking technique.  For the price of a couple of lessons you get over 30 years of invaluable insights that you can watch over and over from the privacy of your home.  Buy today and thank yourself later!",1228867200,,254,4.5
3666551,5,B001KMH8FM,"The first DVD on right hand technique and training is a comprehensive almost encyclopedic video on the various aspects of right hand technique for guitar. Specifically, it covers right arm movements, pick positions, pick grip and angle, different types of picking, economy of movement, damping, individual and combined wrist and forearm movements,
sweep and direct picking, hand positions, metronome practice, specific movements to picking such as the arc of string changing, methods to increase speed, basic and advanced exercises in how to train the muscles, and how to apply all of the above in a musical sense.

It is seldom that one finds information on the physical aspects of guitar playing, breaking it down to is core movements (the Guitar Principles by Jamie Andreas is the one other exception), yet this is fundamental to any style of guitar playing. Ney's DVD's specific focus on right hand (arm) movements covers a realm within guitar technique that is generally obscure, little discussed or written about, and shines a spot light on how to improve and/or correct one's technique.

In working through the DVD, one can either take the Chapters and their specific subjects in order, or one can work on those Chapters and specific elements that are most important to your style of playing.

I would suggest that as you go through the DVD that you take notes to better absorb and then later review the material. And plan on revisiting various chapters or segments that you wish to work with to insure that you are using the correct technique.

For myself, I didn't necessarily purchase the DVD to only obtain maximum speed, but I did want to improve my picking by making it more efficient and consistent. What I found was a treasure chest of specific information on picking that I am beginning to incorporate into my practice routine. If I need additional speed to color the music that I am playing, I have confidence that this DVD will help me to achieve that goal.

The 2nd DVD highlights Ney in concert with both acoustic and electric guitars (solo and in a band) and additionally, includes an interview with him on how he developed his right hand training system and how it applies to various styles of music.

Overall, I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone, whether a beginner or advanced guitarists because this information is so fundamental to right hand technique. It is a rare gem on guitar technique that helps to remove the confusion and/or help clarify what proper technique actually is and eventually make guitar playing easier, smoother, and effortless.

Thanks Ney for developing and producing such an insightful DVD into the full spectrum of pick technique.",1227744000,,2688,4.96
3666552,5,B001KMH8FM,"This is the real deal!

If you want someone to offer the path to beyond 200BPM and beyond 238 and on that's Jimmy Bruno, Yngwie Malmsteen, John Petrucci and not just their speed but how to make beautiful tones of your own which leads to beautiful music!

Over 2 hours of picking minute details with the right hand breaking it down so that anyone can do it!

You would get more in this DVD then you would get in any 2 40 dollar lessons with any person at a big chain music store! Because this DVD Set is focused and concentrated specifically on right hand picking!

Have you ever seen anyone give specific physical exercises to increase right hand strength so that you may pick with ease...well those are in here!

This DVD helps all pick players-metal with advice specific to them, acoustic guitar pick players, and traditional and modern jazz players, basically anyone who uses a pick to play, even those using a pick with other instruments(mandolin, ukulele, etc.)!

It does all of this due to the fact that it addresses all right hand pick composite motions(all together movements) and breaks them up into their dynamic(individual)motions so that you can learn them.

How to move up into speed, how to use a metronome properly to develop speed.

If you're asking if this DVD is worth the purchase, I can stake my name behind it that it is.

If you want beautiful flowing motions, the likes of all the great pick players at the height of their virtuosity then get this 2 DVD set! Includes a bonus concert as well as brief and informative musical interludes with Ney showing these techniques in action with real music.

You could learn something just by carefully watching his left hand too, ;) but don't let that one out!

I stake my name by it!

GET IT, it's SO WORTH IT!",1226966400,4,1774,4.561514195583596
3666553,5,B001KMH8FM,"This instructional DVD is absolutely great......... I would leave it at that, but I believe this product deserves a more detailed review! The information is not just presented or demonstrated... it is ** taught ** - and I have found this to be very rare amongst other guitar instructional products. Ney introduces every concept by clearly explaining the musical reasons that require it's application. It is to be expected that the content presented in this course is unique to it.

Throughout the DVD, Ney explains and demonstrates the myriad of movements required to play all music and how to combine these movements effectively. He then proceeds to teach in practical details how to learn and develop these movements so that you become able to excute them at any speed required by the music.

It is worth mentionning that the whole training is based on years of personal experimentation. It has been used on hundred of students and the effectiveness of the teaching has been proved over and over.

After watching it for the first time, it is clear to me that Ney's intention is to have the student improve. Everything in this course is there for a reason.

The video and audio quality is very high and professionnal.

I finally have all the ressources I need to learn how to play my music from a technical perspective. This is fantastic.

Thanks to Ney Mello for creating this truly unique instructional (as well as inspirational) DVD course! I highly recommend it to every guitar player who plays with a pick - all style.",1226966400,4,1524,4.797709923664122
3666554,5,B001KMH8FM,"Essential study for anyone who plays with a pick. Both beginning and advanced players of any style will benefit from the information the author presents.

The lessons are very clear and well articulated. This is the first material I have seen that breaks down - to a microscopic level - the physical motions and awareness that are necessary to use a pick on acoustic, electric or nylon.",1226966400,5,386,4.7611940298507465
3666555,5,B001KMH8FM,"The first DVD in this set contains an exhaustive analysis of the physical elements of right hand development for pick style guitar.  The second DVD contains a concert video and an interview.  Although the title emphasizes speed picking, ALL mechanics related to picking, strumming, and right hand placement are identified and discussed.

This product offers an unprecedented amount of content, with precise camera angles to catch details.  The content is never repetitive, but it is exhaustive.  To accommodate every learning style, the DVD includes pick and string diagrams, demonstrations of each technique, and verbal explanations.  The first chapter introduces the major arm, hand, and wrist movements relevant to pick plsying.  Subsequent chapters build upon the first one, exploring the effect of different muscle groups, pick angles, and stroke types.  Various muting and strumming options are explored, along with a discussion of practice strategies.

Due to the sheer amount of content and the detail with which it is covered, this is not the kind of DVD you watch only once.  Dependig on which aspects of your playing you need to strengthen, you will use some sections more than others, and you will repeat them frequently.  Exactly which sections will be the most often viewed depends on the individual.  Unfortunately, a DVD is not as easily cross-indexed or cross-referenced as an encyclopedia, which is what this is.  Perhaps later technology will permit much finer granularity of chapters and scenes, or allow us to cross-reference scenes by subject or keyword.

Each video chapter is preceded by a demonstration of the concepts that will be illustrated in the chapter.  The demonstration clips vary in duration and also in musical style, which is useful because this product is not intended solely for speed metal players.  The extent to which the demonstration clips show the concepts about to be introduced cannot be fully appreciated until the second or third viewing.  The clips ARE NOT gratuitous.  They are obviously there to help the viewer recognize and identify the techniques and movements in a real-world playing situation.

For an advanced intermediate guitarist to fully view the instructional DVD, understand and absorb every word, and repeat every movement and exercise correctly at least once takes two to three days.  Simply watching the video from beginning to end may create some intellectual insights, but it WILL NOT cause the body to play the guitar in a different way.

The information is so densely packed that an alert, intelligent, reasonably well-trained person must frequently pause the DVD and absorb what was just said.  It isn't like a conversation, in which there's real-time feedback between the speaker and the audience, so the DVD won't pause by itself while the viewer considers a new concept.  This means that sometimes it's necessary to pause the DVD, try something out on the guitar, and give the information a chance to sink in.

This instructional DVD never insults the viewer's intelligence or beats the viewer over the head with a key concept.  Therefore, it's possible to miss important information through inattention.",1226188800,3,3179,5.247524752475248
3666556,5,B001KMH8FM,"This video may not be of GREAT benefit to someone starting out with a pick - or guitar in general. While it does cover some of the basics - it's not FOCUSED on basics. This DVD gives you PLENTY to think about and experiment with - it took me a couple of days to get through it because I had to stop and try things out, experiment with the pick based on what I just saw, etc. This DVD IMO does a good job of both teaching you HOW to play with the pick as well as HOW to think about picking and effect your picking has on the sound you are producing.

This is a VERY valuabe tool for anyone who is serious about developing new dimensions of their sound by giving some much-needed TLC to the much-neglected RIGHT HAND (Assuming you are a ""rightie"").",1287446400,2,746,4.109589041095891
3666557,5,B001KMH8FM,"Ney Mello's instructional guitar DVD is unique to most because it focuses solely on the right hand ""picking"" technique.  There's tons of information about the left hand (how to fret properly, finger exercises, scales, chords etc) and much on right hand ""finger picking"" or ""classical"" style.  But very little in depth study of using the ""pick"" which Ney shows is just as intricate and has just as much in the tool bag as any other aspect of the guitar.",1273363200,2,452,4.708860759493671
3666558,5,B001KMH8FM,"I cannot stress this enough:  The right hand is so important to playing.  As Ney says in the beginning of the video, many of us can make the correct fingerings, but lack the right hand technique to actually play like we want to.  Many if not most guitar instruction videos leave out the fundaments of guitar playing such as picking, arm movement, etc.  This video examines these aspects of playing very closely.  The focus of this video is to help you get rid of any idiosyncrasies you may have in your technique, and develop better habits.  By doing this, you will find yourself leaping over brick walls you may have previously encountered in mastering the guitar.
Rather than teaching you how to play specific songs, or how to play like specific people, this video gives you the tools to play what YOU like.  The techniques outlined in this video apply to jazz, rock, metal, classical, flamenco, bluegrass, blues, and just about any guitar style you can think of!
I have personally trained with Ney, and I saw improvements in my picking speed and control within only a few months, so I can vouch for this information - It is VERY effective!  If you want to play faster, or just with more control, this video can show you how.  As a fellow guitarist, I would personally recommend this to anyone learning how to play, from beginner to pro.",1256688000,2,1339,4.616033755274262
3666559,5,B001KMH8FM,"This dvd is just what I was looking for. Not only is Ney a world class musician, but an excellent teacher as well. A true master of the guitar, Ney takes you on a journey from simply how to hold the pick through all the technique's necessary to take your guitar learning as far as you want to go. I play at a beginners level yet I believe this dvd would be great for any level guitar player. Each section starts out with a musical example, then gets broken down into each movement and technique needed to make it happen. The bonus dvd consists of an awesome live performance and a great interview. Not having any reviews yet written when I purchased this, the number one reason I decided to make this buy was that I'd already seen what a great teacher and communicator Ney is through the ""Guitar Principles"" website. Ney is a regular there who often writes essays and answers questions. Having this opportunity in addition to owning the dvd is priceless. I would highly recommend this dvd to anyone who seriously wants to advance their playing level. Thank you Ney!",1256169600,2,1065,4.523316062176166
3666560,5,B001KMH8FM,"Before writing my own insights, I decided to see what others had to say about this incredible resource that Ney has put together.  I think everyone has covered the extraordinary amount of material that is contained in this collection, so I'm not going to simply repeat what others have said.  What I would like to address, however, is that this is not your typical guitar instructional DVD.  It is more of a resource that you will use over and over throughout your guitar playing lifetime.

Most instructional DVDs of this nature simply show a guitarist performing a particular technique, and sure they have all the camera angles to show you what is going on, but none of them go into minute detail about the mechanics of those actions and what you can do to be able to perform them yourself.  It also demonstrates how to overcome the stumbling blocks that we all face as we try and learn how to play this wonderfully complex instrument.

Don't get the DVD if you're expecting some flashy become a guitar god in 30 minutes kind of deal.  If, however, you are truly looking to become a better guitarist, I would highly recommend it.",1256083200,2,1131,4.625
3666561,5,B001KMH8FM,"Here is something you just don't get anywhere else.  There are all sorts of instructional materials for guitar, and indeed it is a very large topic, but very very, VERY few materials stop to give you a very precise mechanical understanding of what you should be doing and exactly why and HOW !  If you have ever gotten in your own way, such as having a mental dialogue to the effect ""I'll never be able to..."" well... B.S.  Ney proves it, and with your own hands !  Another review I read recently of Ney's DVD was hoping for more particular exercises.  I've been 'around' Ney at GuitarPrinciples for a few years now, and one of his big things is that YOU are the Artist, after all, and you should be ""practicing the music"" not the ""practice"" - whatever that is...  In deed, think of the question ""I want more exercises please...""  What are you REALLY asking for ?  imho - Ney could not be more right.  Picking can be applied in way too many varied ways to way too many styles of music to say ""here are THE exercises you should be doing"".  The ones he does provide in this DVD are truly foundational to virtually any form of picking you do or may end up doing.  Such insight as is required to digest a topic down to this level of ""foundational elements"" is a science that has taken not only a lot of time, but I would dare to say also a certain Divine Inspiration to even begin to make such an attempt.  Ney understands educational psychology in this domain very deeply.  Aspiring guitarists can turn off their egos and trust Ney in this, listen very carefully, and do !  If after watching perhaps a few times, you haven't gone ""Aha ! Enlightenment !"" email him.  You should SEE, IF you DO.  And some times you have to make a significant effort before you can truly ""see"".  The impact Ney's DVD had on me, however, was immediate, same day.  Perhaps I knew two things in advance 1) the true depth and degree of what would be presented and 2) already sound faith in Ney's instructional abilities.",1255996800,2,1993,4.384196185286103
3666562,5,B001KMH8FM,"Most teachers do not cover this type of  material because it is difficult to articulate and clearly explain.

If you want to continually improve your playing, this one is a keeper.",1255824000,2,365,4.854838709677419
3666563,5,B001KMH8FM,"I have benefitted enourmously from this DVD.

The amount of detail is amazing and Ney goes through all the movements and actions for the pick player. The bonus sections covering strength training is a revelation and something that I've never seen even mentioned in other tutorials.

Obviously this information works on an intellectual level, but also I find just watching such a telented player at close quaters gives an incredible insight into the guitar virtuoso's world.

Highly recommended.",1255824000,2,494,5.3076923076923075
3666564,1,B001KMH8FM,"Buy this DVD if you want to hear Mello go on and on about the fine details of elbow placement, how you should hold your guitar, how to hold your pick, etc. He could of said everything in about 45 minutes instead of the 3 hours that it takes him.

The DVD's have a ""made in my home studio"" feel to them with plenty of segway material between each topic under discussion. There's little talk about how to use the metronome to build technique (very little). In fact, there are basically no exercises at all. Oh wait, he does include actual exercises with rubber bands! There is also some live footage of Mello performing.

Yeah, he can play fast but has nothing new to say on the subject. It's not worth the money. No secrets revealed here. A Major disappointment.

UPDATE: If you are looking for a really good DVD on right hand picking checkout Pebber Brown. His stuff is the best. You can view much of his stuff for free on his Youtube channel.

It's a little much to take in one sitting, there is a wealth of information here that will take a long time to absorb,  however it has seriously helped me obtain a very relaxed and easy picking style! My right arm always used to be a problem, but now it seems to flow wonderfully, not just in terms of just picking fast, but even slowly, my articulation, and my ability to make arpeggios sound fluid is much better as a result of this DVD.

But to get there - to play music in public - you must have some technic. And when somebody was not born with a natural talent of understanding subtle body mechanics and interactions between fingers, arms and even neck then he needs a Teacher which can explain all that stuff in a logical way so You CAN understand and then you really LEARN TECHNIQUE.
So if your playing guitar with the pick do not satisfy you then Ney's DVD is just what you need to change the way you pick forever.

My primary instrument is 6-string fretless & fretted bass but when I'm in composer/producer mode I also play 7-string guitar. When I ""Wood Shed"" to get my guitar picking chops up to a studio musician level I rely 150% on Maximum Speed Picking. IMO, Maximum Speed Picking sets the standard by which ALL other guitar picking instructional courses are judged by. I have seen most of them and they simply do not compare to Maximum Speed Picking. Ney Mello is a ""Master"" when it comes to picking. Ney has the chops and can teach it as well!

I have seen first hand how Maximum Speed Picking can even help younger guitarist. I lent my copy of Maximum Speed Picking to a 14 year old guitarist and within weeks I was totally amazed at how his picking had progressed. After one month it was just scary!

Great book to begin with. Using the DVD from Ney for me was a truly great find for me and I now also try to help my students who wish to play faster and cleaner to adopt Ney's teachings.

This is by far the most in depth information on the right hand I've ever seen.  It'll teach you everything you need to know.

This DVD is a must have for all guitar students, players, teachers and performers.  Everything is explained at a very simple level at first glance, but if you're a more advanced player it can get very deep as well.  Like one of the other reviewers said, I had to watch a segment, then pause the video, and absorb what was said. Then play before proceeding to the next chapter. I've already adopted a few of his concepts very easily into my playing and it has helped.  Others I am working on, there's so many...

What turned me onto this video was another video from Ney's youtube site where he talks about pick grip pressure.  I applied his concepts from the video and instantly corrected some problems I had been working on for the last year!

Even cooler, Ney talks about how to compose music, approach the concept of speed from a psychological level, and improvising from a ego-less state of mind.

I highly recommend this video, it's a huge collection of very valuable secrets, not to mention a steal for $40.00.",1311033600,2,1163,4.548076923076923
8315366,5,B001KMH8FM,"In this video Ney shows you how to train the different movements that the picking hand has to perform while playing the guitar. He breaks every move down and explains how they are done and more importantly, how to practice them.

The approach that is used to gaining speed is maybe a surprise for those who have never heard of Ney Mello before. The actual ability to play fast comes from learning the moves in what is referred to as ""no tempo"" - a slow motion like way to practice. This is done without a metronome, so you are practicing only the moves that are needed -- ""showing"" the arm and hand what to do.

For someone being used to ""chasing the metronome"" this will be very different. If you really want to take the plunge into this DVD you will have to be committed to this kind of practice.

Having done so and also from having web cam lessons with Ney, I have begun a process of changing my picking hand technique. What I have learned from this experience is, that ""no tempo"" practicing really does work in practice.

There are plenty of small gems of advice across the dvd and Ney makes a great effort out of explaining things in detail. Every time I watch it I notice something different, so watching it several times or just reviewing a chapter at a time is advised :)

I would recommend this DVD for anyone who is looking for a really solid approach to improve their picking. It delivers on its promise.",1288137600,3,1416,4.3893129770992365
