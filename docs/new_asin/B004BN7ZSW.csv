8422056,4,B004BN7ZSW,"I have yet to see 'North', but I did track down 'Don'tForget You're Going to Die'

Saw it on line (on MUBI, the only place I could find it, and a good, legitimate source for some more obscure foreign and indie films) and would love to see it again on a bigger screen.

Low key but intense, this follows a young man who tries to evade his army service with a false suicide, only to find out he has HIV at a time when it was basically a death sentence. His life spins out of controls as he turns to drug use and drug dealing to hide his pain, and forget his impending demise.

Then he meets a woman who offers some hope and real love, but can he actually accept it, knowing how short his time horizon is?

The acting is good, but not great, and some of the character twists are sudden to the point of feeling almost arbitrary. Some memorable scenes and images, but it all stays pretty distanced and unemotional. A second viewing would be instructional.",1449705600,,950,4.261111111111111
