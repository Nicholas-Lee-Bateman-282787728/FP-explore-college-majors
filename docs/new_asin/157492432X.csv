195393,1,157492432X,"This movie used Julie Garwood's name, but I find it impossible that the screenwriter even read more than the first chapter of the original book.  I am deeply disappointed in this movie, and I wonder how the author allowed her book to be changed so much.  The original book centered around family, loyalty and love story that ended happily ever after.  With two brothers dead and Mary Rose alone- this film left me depressed.",970617600,8,424,4.702702702702703
195394,3,157492432X,"There are two ways to see this film. One, as a Julie Garwood fan, and two, as a made for T.V movie lover. As a Garwood fan, the movie is a disappointment in the sense that the characters and the situation were  changed too much. As a movie on it's own, it's a very nice film to watch.  My friend had never heard of the book and she absolutuely loved the movie.  Keeping both perspectives in mind, it gets 3 stars.",945129600,6,413,4.074074074074074

195403,1,157492432X,...that Garwood's The Secret was not made into a movie. What was done to Harrison and Cole was hard for this reader of all Garwoods' work to take. I know it's just a book but I have been reading Garwood since I was thirteen. The Secret was my first Garwood book. I think only a true lover of Garwoods' work could do justice to a movie with the same characters. Also being a Hallmark movie the ability for the screen writers to really bring the alpha male Harrison to the large audience is pretty much in vain. A network like HBO would be able to bring this fantastic character to life.,1424649600,,585,4.2792792792792795

195407,3,157492432X,"The movie got off to a good start, I was reminded of ""Oliver Twist"" when I saw the boys picking pockets in New York. The movie moves quickly as the boys run from the police, and at the same time we see a woman who, upon seeing the police, hides a baby in a wagon. When the boys steal the wagon with the baby the story quickly moves to the advertised plot.

The boys quickly decide the police came to close to catching them and use their stolen money to buy train tickets to Kansas, taking the baby with them. Upon arriving in Kansas they quickly decide to give up their pick-pocketing ways since everybody there has a gun strapped to their waist. Fifteen minutes into the movie about six years have passed, the boys (now grown) are working in Texas and saving up money to start their own ranch. Twenty-five minutes into the movie they are living on their own ranch in Montana and the baby girl is now grown and this is where the movie slows from the fast paced adventure to a slower drama. The plot becomes more about the ""brothers"" being overprotective of their ""sister"" as well as conflicts with the changing culture as it relates to the cattle industry and law enforcement along with Mary Rose's struggle to free herself enough from her brothers control to have a romance. Eventually Mary Rose is told the truth about how she became a member of this unusual family and she travels back to New York to find her birth family. It is an enjoyable and family friendly movie, just not exactly the heartwarming style I expected from Hallmark.

I have read several reviews from people who had first read the book I believe all were very disappointed by the movie. I have not read the book and therefore cannot make that comparison, but as a stand alone movie it is not exceptional but it is okay for family entertainment. The acting was good by both the younger actors and by the older actors who played the main characters. I liked the way the movie played with the idea of  the interracial family, the oldest boy and leader of the ""family"" is black while the other boys and the girl are white. This is brought up from time to time in the movie but the movie never makes a big deal of it.",1414540800,,2184,4.387654320987655
195418,1,157492432X,"Like many of the other reviews, I was very disappointed by how different the movie was from the very amazing series by Garwood.  But, even judging it on it's own merit as a movie and not comparing it to the book I would still dislike it.  The acting was very mediocre and the plot line was very convoluted.  None of the stories were really fully developed; and since I love the books so much, it lacked all the strong characters.  Mary Rose was such a whiny child and not the strong woman that she should have been.  Over all, bad adaptation.",1404777600,,542,4.326732673267327
195419,5,157492432X,"We can watch this movie over and over.  Jennifer Garner plays Mary Rose, an infant who was in a wagon put there by a maid of a wealthy family so that she could get a ransom and run off of the man she loved - only he was leading her on.  The three boys keep Mary Rose and raise her as all of them become a family - even though the boys were from orphanages.  This is a great family movie to watch and really enjoy.",1397001600,2,413,3.7790697674418605
195420,2,157492432X,"I could not recommend this to anyone who has read the book, ""For the Roses,"" which the movie was supposed to be made after.  It did not follow the book in so many ways it is unbelievable!  In the book, Cole did not die, Adam did not die, the farm did not fall apart, Adam did not marry a native American Indian.  I could go on & on, but if you've read the book, I would stay far away from this movie!",1395014400,3,400,3.8536585365853657
195421,5,157492432X,"I loved this movie.  I watched it 3 times when my DVD order first came.  Then everyday after.

This is about a family who are not even blood related and yet they loved, respected, protected, and were loyal to each other more than most of the families I knew in real life.

This is a movie based on a book.  It is not ""the movie about the book itself"". Therefore one must understand that it is not the ""entire"" story in the book nor the ""Title of the Book"" which is ""For the Roses"".  A certain chapter or certain parts of any chapter/s maybe taken to make a movie out of it.  If it is the movie ""For the Roses"", then it will be ""Titled"" such in the first place, but then again not ""everything"" written in the book could be expected to be in the movie.
Even movies of ""Real Life Story"" are not everything as it happened - when made into movies.

I will recommend families to watch this movie.  Maybe most of them can learn ""strong family ties"" from it.",1388793600,,950,4.147540983606557
195422,4,157492432X,this is one of the best westerns i have seen.  saw it years ago and is still a great movies to see.,1383264000,,99,3.5
195423,3,157492432X,"The first time I caught this film on Hallmark, it was about halfway over.  Since I'd already read the book, though, I decided to finish the movie out.  It certainly was not much like the book at all, but I also wanted to give it a fair chance and see it in its entirety.  Fortunately, the next time I watched it, I was prepared for a different story than was told in the book and was able to experience and enjoy the movie on its own merit.

As a movie about the bonds of family and home set on a ranch in nineteenth century Montana, I enjoyed it.  Pretty typical Hallmark feel-good fare, and a pleasant way to pass a couple of hours.  As an adaptation of Julie Garwood's book, though, not so much.  To be fair, the product details do indicate that the film is ""inspired by,"" rather than ""an adaptation of,"" so it's not terribly misleading.  Also, the different title (rather than simply calling the film ""For the Roses"") further distances it somewhat from the book.  Unfortunately, though, for those of us who read and loved Julie Garwood's book, just the mention of the book in the product description sends expectations rather high and creates sort of a pre-conceived idea that this will be a somewhat faithful adaptation of the book.

For anyone who hasn't read the book, definitely try the movie and also read the book (just try not to let the first one you experience color your opinion of the other).  Fans of the book who are looking for a live-action adaptation of that story, I think will be rather disappointed.  For anyone else who has read the book, however, I would simply recommend that you try to keep an open mind and put the book's story out of your mind.  If you can do that, I think you'll enjoy the film as I did.",1383177600,,1734,4.398119122257054

195427,3,157492432X,When I heard that they made a movie based on my book I was so happy however when I got it it really only had a little in common even some of the fundamental parts of the story are different. I didn't like that so many things were different than the books because there are five books and from someone who read the books first if I watched the movie first I would be really surprised and think that I bought the wrong book. However if you can think of the movie as not being based on a book and look at it like a whole new story then it was pretty good. It's just a three for me because I still couldn't stop comparing it to the books that I already ready.,1334275200,,655,3.9323308270676693

It is really regrettable how so many people refuse to accept that movies and books are different media. My advice is buy this movie, you'll love it.

Julie Garwood's book are sexy, romantic, full of hope and Cole Clayborne was my favorite character. I looked at all the actors chosen to portray the Clayborne brothers and none of them were who I had pictured as the rough, good-looking, sexy men of Rosehill/Blue Belle, Montana. Hallmark did a great disservice to the author and to the fans of For the Roses/The Clayborne Brides and Come the Spring. Especially Come the Spring.",1280880000,,777,4.5177304964539005

The story of their journeys, the hardships of life in the west - issues of money, land, racism - all of that wrapped up in a drama.  I love this film and urge everyone to give it a shot.  I see that some reviewers are angry that this isn't exactly a romantic love story, but that's what makes it so good. It's the love of a family of orphans who grow up together and MAKE IT when others were failing. Get this movie.  Seriously.",1274313600,,825,4.03680981595092
195446,1,157492432X,"This was the worse adaption from book to movie I've ever seen!

I fell in love with Julie Garwood's book, For the Roses.  It is a wonderfully sexy, mysterious, and funny story!  I was so excited to find that a movie was made on one my favorite books.  Boy was I in for a disappointment!

There's trivial things I can point to in the movie, but what's way, way worse is that the only thing that is correct in the movie are the names of the characters.

I was so PISSED OFF that the main characters, Mary Rose and Harrison, didn't even like each other until the VERY end.  Harrison was a puny, annoying character (not at all lovable) and Mary Rose... well let's just say that I hate how Jennifer Garner portrays her.  I bet she didn't even read the book!  And then Mary Rose falls in love with some shoot-em-up cowboy!  Where'd that come from?  AND THE BROTHERS?  Let's not even get started... or shall we?  One of them dies and one of them marries an Indian woman.  The family has a feud.  I don't even see the loving connection between them all as portrayed in the book!

I was laughing and yelling the whole way through the movie.  Laughing because it was so cheesy and yelling because the movie and book are two totally different stories.  It's not Julie Garwood's fault that the movie is so very, very bad.  I bet she was just as annoyed with the directors of the film.  She's just too polite!",1186185600,,1396,4.316602316602316
195447,1,157492432X,"Rose Hill was not For the Roses.  It's like they just robbed the book of the characters' names!  I know that movies based on books make changes to help the transistion to the screen but the butchery done here was above and beyond.
Mary Rose was a stong intelligent woman in the book.  Her brothers sent her off to school in St. Louis not in the back of wagons.  She was in love with a scottish man named Harrison not Fergus.  Harrison was a big strong lawyer who worked for her English father.  The nannie who helped take her was killed at the very start.  And it was her father's right hand man who did it.  Mary Rose goes to visit her father because she wants to but comes home because they want to change her.  Her and Harrison are happily married and she is preggers by the end of the book.
Some of the other major differences are that Cole does not die.  And Adam is what holds the Clayborne family together.  And they would never abandon each other! Also where was Mama Rose, she could have been squeezed in there somewhere!
The movie aside from the book the movie was just lacking.  I don't recommend the movie at all.  However the books (For the Roses, The Clayborne Brides, and Come the Spring) are WONDERFUL!!!",1184716800,,1220,4.345132743362832

If you're looking for an accurate account of the books this is not the movie for you, but if you'd like to be entertained by a heart-warming movie then watch ""Rose Hill"".

195470,1,157492432X,"When I saw the movie Rose Hill was an adaptation of one of my favorite author's book, I was very excited to watch it.  I should have skipped it.  The only thing they got right was the make up of the family.  Two of the main characters from the book are killed off in the movie but Julie actually wrote separate stories for them.  It has been a while since I read the book but who the heck is Fergus.  I don't remember him from the book but the movie implies that he ends up with Mary Rose.  Look, I understand that when a book is adapted into a movie there will be some artistic license taken, such as the deletion of minor characters or the addition of others; but when you totally change the main characters and what happens to them, you are not taking artistic license, you are telling a story that is totally different from the original.  Give me a break.  The people who made Rose Hill need to talk to the people who adapted the John Grisham books into movies.  I watched some of those movies before reading the books and vice versa and although artistic license was taken, the movies pretty much stayed true to the books.  I don't know how Julie Garwood could have put her name on this movie because it was no where near the wonderful story she wrote.  Didn't she read the screenplay before she agreed to this movie.  I hope, if she agrees to have another one of her books adapted into a movie, she ensures that the movie comes somewhere close to resembling the book in someway or form, such has having the main characters who are suppose be alive stay alive and having them marry characters that were actually in the books.",1131753600,13,1630,4.3256578947368425

I did not really pay much attention to that because I was expecting changes. This happens to everything that comes from a book onto the screen. However I have to say that it was really not well done. It did not deserve any relation with the book 'For the roses' at all because they changed even the most basic story line in the book. SPOILER ***** Mary Rose and Harrison are now brother and sister ***** I can live with many things, including stretching the proloque further then the book, adding a couple of characters and omitting some, because not everything that works in a book could work in a movie, but the story is between Mary Rose and Harrison, their funny interatction on the ranch and then in England, it is the core. They did not even though that, invented a complete new love interst. Another main thing in the book, the loyalty of her adopeted family to each other, is not really portrayed at all.

To sum it up, it is not worth to buy it. Even if you do not consider the book at all, the movie seems to be missing something. It is not worth it.",1125446400,10,1183,4.257777777777778

I was in Blockbuster to get a movie and picked up ""Rosehill"" by chance. It's tough enough to get a good video these days, let alone one without profanity, sexual inuendo, or nudity.  ""Rosehill"" was just a good clean movie with a nice story. A nice way to spend an evening. By the way , Fergus was a Scotsman from Edinburgh, SCOTLAND, not an Irishman as one reviewer had him.

It would have made a great follow-up if Cole's story Come the Spring had been made into a movie. I know that movie adaptations don't always follow the book, but give me a break.

195475,3,157492432X,"Before Jennifer Garner struck it big with, and developed her own fervent fanbase, as Sydney Bristow on ALIAS on ABC. And before she wowed audiences as Elektra in the original DAREDEVIL (surely she was the only redeeming feature of that movie) she was eking out a living as an actress in a variety of tv movies and b-pictures. One such movie was Hallmark's production of ""Rose Hill"" (based on Julie Garwood's best-selling ""For the Roses"") in which Garner plays Mary Rose. Mary Rose is a woman raised by a group of homeless boys. The boys decide to leave the slums and drab life as pickpockets on the streets of New York City to become cowhands on the plains of Texas (though one does enjoy a brief career as a Texas Ranger). Finally they become landholders of the Rose Hill Ranch on the rich grasslands of Montana where they raise cattle and try to make something of themselves - that is until tragedy strikes.

I have not read the book on which this movie is based, so I cannot comment on how good a job it does translating the text for the screen (judging by other reviewers comments not a very good one). But what this movie may lack in faithfulness to its source material it no doubt makes up for in down-home charm.

I'm not a big fan of westerns (I can probably count the number I like on two hands) so I was not holding out much hope for what this movie might offer (my shameless interest was the presence of Garner). But I found myself becoming both charmed and involved by the human family drama that is the underlying theme behind this movie.

As TV movies go this is passable entertainment, but those expecting Garner to kick around baddies as she does in ALIAS and DAREDEVIL will no doubt be disappointed.",1099872000,8,1716,4.476038338658147
195476,1,157492432X,"I have read all of the reviews as well as ALL of Julie Garwood's novels. I have always admired her wit, humor and storytelling ability. With this in mind, I was VERY disapointed with ""Rosehill"". I did not expect that the movie would be a word-for-word account and would have no flavor of its own. There have been plenty of movies I have enjoyed based on books that took some literary license. However, this is not what Hallmark did. They took a great story that involved strong characters, an unusual family, a mysterious stranger and a lasting love story and made it into a different story entirely. The changes they made didn't make sense. Why kill Cole when he wasn't killed in the first place? There was already enough drama in the book. Why make Adam on his deathbed and married at the end of the movie when he was so adamant against getting married? Why spend five minutes putting the family together only to spend the next few hours doing everything in your power to pull them apart and succeeding? They weren't a family, they were a fluke of circumstances according to this movie. They stayed together for the ""baby's"" sake and nothing else. No, this is not what it was.

I understood why they changed the setting for Mary Rose's father's home from England to New York. I did not understand the need to add a brother named ""Harrison""--who by the way was the name of Mary Rose's husband in the book. I understood why they took out a lot of the middle scenes, background information and even why they left out Mama Rose. But, for the life of me, I can't tell you why they made the remaining two brothers leave to search for their own fortunes at the end of the movie when they had worked the ranch not only for Mary Rose, but also as the culmination of their own dreams as well. They needed that family as much as Mary Rose did.

I understood why they left out Adam's trial, but I can't tell you what ""Fergus"" was. I can't tell you why they made Mary Rose fall for that low-down piece of slime, but she did. As if her brothers (in the book) would have ever let a man like that within two paces of her. It's like they looked at a great puzzle and just took two pieces out of it, put together a new puzzle and called the two puzzles the same. No way!

I know I sound like I am whining. However, I am telling you that there should be some things sacred in this world and, when turning a book into a movie, you should stay true to the spirit of the book and the skeleton of the story. They didn't need to add the love scenes, but they should have told the love story. They didn't even try, and the entire effort came across as sloppy. To me, it is the same as taking a classic like ""Pride and Prejudice"" and killing off Mr. Darcy and making Elizabeth marry Mr. Wickam. You can do it, but don't sell it by saying it is based on the original classic. NOT THE SAME AT ALL.

Hallmark says that it wants to do a sequel, and I am dreading that. However, there is a ray of hope. Julie Garwood is actually supposed to be writing on this one. If that holds true, I will be tuning in. However, a note to Hallmark before they take anymore creative license. KEEP TO THE OVERALL STORY PLEASE!",1090195200,38,3181,4.270315091210613
195477,4,157492432X,"I read and loved the Julie Garwood book, and did not expect the movie to live up to it. Good thing I prepared myself, because this adaptation is almost nothing like the book, except that it emphasizes the family relationship of Mary Rose and her unconventional brothers (which was my favorite part of the book anyway). I am a big Jennifer Garner fan as well, so I liked seeing her in something pre-Alias. I like this movie, but would not recommend it for fans of the book, as they will be disappointed.",1089849600,13,502,4.467391304347826
195478,1,157492432X,"So sad, so bad! Readers Beware!  I was vastly disapointed in this. I was hoping for that ""Garwood magic"" and ended up wanting to drop the video off my deck. They totally revamped a wonderful story to garbage. Yes, there was a MaryRose and 4 brothers that went west to Rose Hill and that's where they stop. There is a woman they bring along to cook that never exhisted, there was an indian woman ( I think these 2 were to take Crazy Corey's place). They add a cattle rustler for a love intrest. Cole dies. and there is this Irishman that also didn't exhist. Where Is Maryrose's husband? And MaryRose never goes off to school which is the big part of the story. Where is Mama Rose?? we never get a letter. She is a big part of the story. And Adam marries the Indian woman...Huh? Where'd the story go.. Please don't do a sequel. Take my advice catch it on the Hallmark channel instead of wasting money on this. They missed the stagecoach folks!",1066262400,28,941,4.346590909090909
195479,1,157492432X,"There was no SPUNK! ""For the Roses"" is one of my favorite books, and boy was I excited to find in my local video store. What a waste of 90 minutes. There was none of the charm, none of the humor (except for a couple of chuckles), and zero romance!! There was no frustration that came with the Elliot family, no drop dead gorgeous man to sweep Mary Rose off her feet, and couldn't they have found a better Mary Rose?  Mary Rose with a short little guy like Fergus?? COME ON! And where was Adam's elegance, and Cole's heart, and Travis's sweetness, and Doug's maturity? As a movie, even without the book, it was terrible. It left alot out and wasn't much better than a summary of the book (an inaccurate summary at that).

195481,1,157492432X,"Having read many of Julie Garwood's books, I settled down with bated breath to enjoy what I expected to be a brilliant film.
How wrong could I have been?
I can only wonder if the screenwriter actually read Julie's book. Other than the use of the characters names, this butchered story bore little resemblance to the original plot.
All four brothers are much stronger characters and none of them were lost along the way to death! Where did Fergus spring from? And what happened to the English Lord?
Arghh! Don't bother with the film  - stick to the book it's a far better story.",1011225600,9,577,4.548076923076923
195482,1,157492432X,"I have read all of Julie Garwood's books and looked forward to seeing one of them come to life. Sadly this was not to be. The highly forgetable actress who played Rose was overly pouty and did not resemble the strong and capable character of the book. While the cinematography was beautiful, the film was void of the depth of character of the novel. It seemed as though the scriptwriter could not allow Adam, the african-american Claymore to be as vital to the film as he was in the book. The ending, which included a senseless betrayal, the death of Cole and Rose settling for Fergus(none of which were in the book) was a tv movie whimp out. Perhaps, if it had been four hour film presentation there would have been time enough to tell the story in a way that truly honored Julie Garwood's wonderful work. Ditch the moive and READ THE BOOKS, as each brother had there own story.",995241600,9,879,4.46583850931677
195483,1,157492432X,"As I am a huge Julie Garwood fan, I found this movie to be very disappointing. The movie contain none of the depth of For The Roses, it didn't bring the charcters to life at all and ended up being an entirely different story to the book. The only thing that could really link the movie to the book was the fact that the characters names were the same, and that Mary Rose was the missing Lady Victoria. I agree with Angela Middleton's review further down - the screenwriter obviously hadn't read much of the book at all, otherwise the movie would have ended up as wonderful as the book is. I thoroughly enjoyed the book, and continue to read it over and over again. I would be very surprised if Julie Garwood wasn't deeply disappointed with the movie.",988502400,9,750,4.402877697841727
