There were performances from stars at the time like Jim Ed Brown and Helen Cornelius, Larry Gatlin, The Kendalls and Moe and Joe.  As far as I know there isn't a live concert dvd of Eddie Rabbitt and he is on here.  He is one of my all time favorites and he makes the dvd worth having.",1501113600,,362,4.142857142857143
8165354,4,B000LYIY1C,"This is a DVD of the specials from the 1978 and 1979 Music City News Awards shows.  The 1978 part was very short having only six songs but the 1979 had ten.  The quality of the DVD is very good and clear so I enjoyed it even though it wasn't very long.  I'm glad I bought it and might buy more if I could know the names of all the artists before I buy it.  It usually has the names of four of the artists on the front and then says ""and many more"".  I like to know which ones have my favorite artists before I buy them.",1494201600,,519,3.7685185185185186
