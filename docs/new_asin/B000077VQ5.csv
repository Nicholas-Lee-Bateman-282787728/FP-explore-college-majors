1800986,5,B000077VQ5,"James'attention to detail is evident in the sound of all his  recordings. Both his voice and acoustic guitar playing are exceptional with quite remarkable clarity . Yet there is variety in all his does and  great subtely in his acoustic arrangements with that fabulous handmade Olson guitar he caresses to help that beauty sing out. He rocked the Manchester Arena last month with a beautiful , intimate show and it was clear that he inspired tremendous affection from fans young and old with his singing and charismatic charm. The next best thing to seeing and hearing James live must be DVD; only that format can match the quality of sound he consistently produces and with the added bonus that you can actually see the guy which makes it all as personal as I think his output is intended to be. James is amazing. He is trully blessed with a remarkbale voice. It just seems to be going the opposite way to many other seasoned veterans of earlier decades, by just getting better and better. I am itching to get my hands on 'Pull Over' but have the misfortune to live over the pond, and it isn't available here. It is coded for Canada and The U. S. of A.,so no point importing it. James' sensisitivity, his song writing skill and his accomplised musicianship ensure that anything he puts out will deserve our undivided attention and earn our admiration, so, even though I haven't seen it yet, trust me it will be very, very good.",1034899200,,1428,4.618110236220472

His lyrics are clear, carried in such cool melody's that soar and build and provied an experience that is intimate and powerfull and very touching, along with some sure fun and laughs! I feel as if this is a quintessential concert by which Taylor can be truly known and appreciated. It is fresh and new but aged like a great vinatge wine to its true mature essence! His back up band and singers are terrific, maintaining Taylor's cool, charming and profound tone and lyrics!",1374796800,,628,4.666666666666667

1801009,4,B000077VQ5,"James Taylor's second live dvd, 2002's ""Pull Over,"" could very easily have been a gold standard for all future live dvds; unfortunately despite having a wonder performance and set list, the dvd itself falls a bit short in many aspects.

As others have pointed out, the picture is horribly matted and does not take advantage of the widescreen format, making for a very awkward viewing experience. The picture quality itself is very good, but the camerawork is subpar and contains many unnecessary cuts and edits that distract from the performance, which really represents Taylor at his best.

With all that said, ""Pull Over"" is first and foremost about the performance itself, which as I've already mentioned is fantastic. The sound quality is crystal clear, and the music is top notch. Taylor and his band are in perfect synch throughout, and the set list is a great mix of old favorites, then new recordings, and obscure fan favorites. Surrounding old favorites like ""Fire and Rain,"" ""Carolina in My Mind,"" and ""Sweet Baby James"" are a healthy dose of his underrated late 1980s'-1990s' material, including haunting renditions of ""The Frozen Man,"" ""Shed a Little Light,"" and ""Copperline."" The new material from the then unreleased ""October Road"" holds its own well, and the old favorites sound as lively as ever; Taylor is one artist who's never really phoned in a song no matter how many times he's performed it. Even though the picture quality leaves quite a bit to be desired, it is clear that Taylor and his band have a fondness and respect for each other both personally and professionally, and that chemistry comes through in these performances.

So while it may not be the best viewing experience technically, ""Pull Over"" is still a superb performance filled with energy and excitement. Throw it on a top notch soundtrack and just listen.",1365206400,2,1845,4.964401294498382

1801012,5,B000077VQ5,JT never sounded better and the upbeat arrangements to several of his classics added interest to this amazing performance.  We bought this several years ago and arrived home later than usual but had to get a sample before turning in for the night.  We couldn't turn it off.  My only complaint is I haven't been able to find the audio tracks available anywhere!,1310860800,,360,4.682539682539683
1801013,5,B000077VQ5,"Good concert - what I would have expected from James Taylor.  His band on this DVD is mostly the same but have changed drummer & added another percussionist and ""Blue Lou"" Marini on sax and flute.  Jimmy Johnson on bass is great but yearn to see Lee Sklar back again (he IS on the ""Carole King/James Taylor at the Troubador"" DVD, though)...and as usual the backing singers are top-notch (Valerie Carter is still on this DVD - she has been replaced by someone else in later concerts).

Not much else to say.  If you like James Taylor, you'll like this concert.  Mostly the same set as on all his other DVD's, but a few less known or seldom-included songs are covered.",1308009600,,666,4.471074380165289
1801014,5,B000077VQ5,"I have played this DVD at least 100 times in my wood working shop.  When I get stuck on where to take one of my creations next, I reach for this DVD and play it over the sound of my machines.  At this amplification, the 5.1 sound really comes through.  I know it sounds hokey but it never fails to let me see where to go next.

The material included is just what I wanted from James Taylor.  The ""Traffic Jam"" song is worth the price of the entire DVD.  I never cease to be impressed with how professional James and the band come across and they do it while obviously having a good time up on stage.  It happen to know it is not as easy as they make it look.

If you are a James Taylor fan, don't miss out on this concert.",1303171200,,722,3.9310344827586206
1801015,5,B000077VQ5,James Taylor plays many well known songs and the whole DVD id great. Writing this review makes me want to watch it again.,1302739200,,121,4.304347826086956
1801016,3,B000077VQ5,"As other reviewers have noted, the video is a ""matted"" 4:3.  What this means is on our home theatre, we had to zoom in by 50% to fill the screen and the resulting picture is grainy and muddy.  It's a shame so many other wise fine music DVD's miss the opportunity of decent 16:9 video.

James' performance is strong, and the audio transfer in Dolby 5.1 is super.  But like others said, I had to close my eyes to really enjoy it.",1198627200,2,427,4.170731707317073

1801018,5,B000077VQ5,"Awesome! Love it! The the behind the scenes view of the making of Country Road is not especially well-filmed and disappointingly lacking in detail.

1801021,5,B000077VQ5,"Other reviewers were right, and I'm glad I read their reviews before watching the DVD.  The sound is spectacular. If you're a James Taylor fan you'll enjoy both his performance and his very talented ensemble.  I watched the whole thing once just for the experience, but now I just leave the ""music video"" style camera work off by leaving the TV off.  You spend a good portion of the DVD getting shots of the people at the concert dancing or whatever.  Really disappointing.  I recommend the DVD, but leave your TV off after your first time through.

*Update:
I recently saw James Taylor in concert as he performed with many of the same people on this DVD.  It was even better being there.  As a side note, after the intermission James came out and signed stuff.  He wouldn't play again until everyone that wanted a signature got one.  It's great to see a wonderful person who's also a wonderful musician. Next time you come, James, I'm bringing my tattered, old 'James Taylor' guitar book! (they won't let me bring my guitar)",1164153600,3,1025,4.613259668508287

1801023,5,B000077VQ5,"The title of my review would have been more appropriate than ""Pull Over"" as the title of this 25 song DVD. It is a lot of fun to watch and listen to as his superb backing musicians and vocalists perform with him in this concert. Blue Lou Marini of Blues Bros.fame plays the saxophone among other instruments and brings down the house on Knock on Wood and How Sweet it is. There is an excellent rendition of You've got a friend and a few other older early 70's hits for JT. Over all it is well worth the small 13.48 price it goes for.  If only they would have edited out the ""Frozen Man"" part this would get seven stars !",1128124800,4,620,4.12396694214876
1801024,5,B000077VQ5,"I enjoyed both DVDs very much the Bacon Theatre and Pull Over but I Prefer the Bacon Theatre. James Looks more himself,a shy and a sensitive artist. As I am not a native English speaker I love the subtitles to sing along and understand what he says. I wait for his next DVD with subtitles, please.",1117756800,3,297,4.321428571428571
1801025,5,B000077VQ5,"Are you a fan of James Taylor?  Then this is a must have DVD!

I bought his first, very highly rated DVD, Live at the Beacon Theatre, and enjoyed it so much I just had to have this one even though people said if you own one there is no need to buy another.  I must disagree...both offers something unique.

That said, I feel this is the better of the two DVDs currently offered and here's why:

The songs are awesome.  Frozen Man is just outstanding.  Millworker is such a great song.  The version of the popular Fire and Rain is better on Live at, but this one is more in line with the original version.

James Taylor seems much more relaxed and animated at this concert.

The visual impact of the stage is more pleasant with the color and openness of the stage.

The only negative with this DVD is the same as Live at, and that is the constant quick change of camera angles.  There are dozens of shots in each song.  This seems to be a very common theme with concert DVDs and one I wish would change.

As I stated in my review of Live at, if you can only get one James Taylor DVD this is the one to get.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!",1116028800,8,1143,4.017777777777778
1801026,5,B000077VQ5,"This is a wonderful concert with a nice blend of Jame's more current songs and plenty of his chart busting hits. He is surrounded by a great group of musicians and back-up singers. His best instrument (his voice) is still smooth and velvet to the ear. To the reviewer who slammed his version of ""Steam Roll Blues""... James was NEVER a blues man and though it was pretty tame, it's still NOT LAME! It is just another arrangement of a song he probably always HAS to cover for his audience.

All and all, this is a great DVD for any James Taylor fan!",1098748800,6,547,4.310679611650485
1801027,5,B000077VQ5,"Sweet Baby James is back, this time with yet another terrific concert performance of his ever-growing catalogue of unforgettable songs. While he is easily one of the most successful of all of the record selling artists of the last thirty years, he is also one of the hardest working live performers in the business, and is in perpetual demand throughout the country, indeed, the world, as a first class draw for huge crowds. I haven't had the pleasure of seeing him sing live in decades, but always anticipate his new record releases and DVDs such as these in order to stay in touch with this most singular talent. Like the late John Denver, Taylor approaches the stage with enthusiasm and a charismatic charm that is simply hard for me to resist. Needless to say, I succumbed to the temptations herein pretty quickly.
Included here are many works not previously available on DVD, such as ""Frozen Man"" here with a funny and yet poignant introduction that shows how well Taylor succeeds at broaching bittersweet and often meaningful subjects with a touch of humor and satire. Also new here is ""You Can Close Your Eyes"", ""Millworker"", and ""That's Why I'm Here"", all delivered with the typical flawless Taylor rendition. Of course, the panoply of perpetual favorite favorites like ""Fire And Rain"", ""Copperline"", ""Everyday"", ""You've Got A Friend"", and ""Sweet Baby James"" are all here, as are many others, for a total of some two dozen songs or so. Old JT is aging, as are we all, but he has mellowed even more over the years, and by prevailing over his own demons and continuing to do what he does like no one else can, has once again offered us a gift that I urge you to go out and grab for your very own. Enjoy!",1073606400,11,1709,4.643564356435643
1801028,5,B000077VQ5,"I saw the HDNet broadcast of this concert and thought it was fantastic. I immediately went to Amazon and purchased the DVD and was very happy with my purchase, although I thought the video quality of the DVD wasn't quite as good as the broadcast. Picky, picky.",1073088000,8,260,4.553191489361702
1801029,5,B000077VQ5,"James Taylor is such an amazing talent. Forgive me if it sounds like I'm going off the deep end here, but my goodness, the music he writes touches me. What ""Pull Over"" adds to what we already know is that James Taylor is also incredibly well-spoken, wonderful with his audience and very, very funny. He's just so at ease, when a member of the audience prematurely shouts out a request for ""Copper Line,"" Taylor reaches for the set list and points out that ""Copper Line"" isn't until the second set. With self-deprecating humor he says, ""We're not there yet. You have to sit through all this crap first. You can go out to the bar if you want. We'll send someone to get you when we get there.""",1072310400,7,690,4.3984375
1801030,5,B000077VQ5,"Having owned the `Live at Beacon Theatre' DVD and thoroughly enjoyed it I was almost not going to bother with `Pull Over'if I had listened to some of the reviews here saying the sound is weird and the picture average etc.
Well all I can say to anyone put off by these is don't take any heed of them and buy this DVD.
Okay some of the hits are repeated but there are some classics here that weren't on `Beacon' such as `Sweet baby James',Carolina on my Mind,Millworker and the new material off `October Road' is excellent.
I prefer this band especially with `Russ Kunkel' on drums and the addition of horns.",1062720000,21,606,4.419642857142857
1801031,3,B000077VQ5,"After seeing this concert in glorious 16x9 High Definition on HDNet I purhased the the DVD assuming in would be in widescreen. The tech specs on Amazon list the DVD as being 16x9 ratio (1.85:1) but actually it's a letterboxed 3x4 (1.33:1) so it doesn't take advantege of the widescreen format at all.
The 5.1 digital sound track is great and worth the price.",1062720000,4,358,4.609375
1801032,4,B000077VQ5,"Great performances and arrangements of JT material. That being said, I found myself cringing at the amateurish camera work and video editing. Good camera work is invisible, you'll find yourself distracted from the performance by the shaky cameras, jumpy edits and other poor production techniques.",1047168000,8,297,5.622222222222222
1801033,3,B000077VQ5,"I have had this since XMAS but I prefer the Live at the Beacon (which I have had for about 18mths) because of the sound and picture quality as well as the atmosphere. As the previous reviewer pointed out unless you are a die hard JT fan or you want to hear more of the new material I would not bother with this one.
If you Haven't got ""Live at the Beacon"" yet - order it and forget this.",1044835200,7,387,3.911392405063291
1801034,5,B000077VQ5,"From reading the reviews, I wasn't sure about purchasing this dvd since I have the Beacon Theatre concert, also.  Well, I'm glad I did - even if some of the songs are duplicated, there is still enough different material, plus different arrangements, to make this well worthwhile.  James and the band are more relaxed and spontaneous in Pull Over, and look like they are having a lot more fun during this tour (this dvd is a taken from several concerts) than at the Beacon.  Although it is very sad to have lost Carlos Vega, it is also a treat to see Russ Kunkel back on the drums just like he was 30+ years ago on Taylor's earlier albums.
One reviewer commented that the sound was not as good on this dvd and sounded like it had been heavily processed.  To me, the mixing is uneven - on some songs, especially at the beginning, the mix is muffled (lacks crispness, the bass is way too strong and the instruments don't seem well defined, plus Taylor's voice sounds like it is in the background) but on others, it is first rate.  The Beacon concert has uniformly excellent sound, but Pull Over is hit and miss although even the ""poorest"" is still pretty good.
Overall, Taylor and his band/background singers put together a wonderful show - this is a ""must buy"" for his fans!",1044748800,8,1272,4.489177489177489
1801035,5,B000077VQ5,"The sound quality is EXCELLENT...Not to mention James does a great job!!  Doesn't get any closer to the real thing!!  Enjoyed it just as much as the Eagles Hell Freezes over DVD!!  EXCEPTIONAL!!

1801036,4,B000077VQ5,"This is the second James Taylor concert I am aware of that is available on DVD.  If you are a James Taylor fan (I am) you should buy both this and ""Live at the Beacon Theatre"" because you will appreciate the different performances.  If you are a casual listener of James you should choose the Beacon Theatre disk.
If you are an audiophile or care about sound quality, this one is ok but not great.  It sounds like it went through a significant amount of electronic processing.  The sound from the Beacon Theatre recording is much, much better.  That is strong competition though as the Beacon recording is probably the best sounding DVD I own.",1043193600,22,643,4.556521739130435
1801037,5,B000077VQ5,"Let me start off that I have just about all JT video footage that there is (most all on VHS) and this is the best so far, the guy is like wine. The PBS special that was made into a DVD concert ""Live at the Beacon Theatre"" is really good, but it does not contain the energy that ""Pull Over"" has. I can not say I totally like his new October Road album, but I can say that this concert is great and just makes you feel good all over, all that you expect from JT.  In this concert there are tunes from his new album to old ones with a whole new sound, very fresh.
As for those that do not like it because it is not in widescreen, well you bought the wrong disc.  The one I bought 12/2003 is 16:9, not 4:3; read the specs before buying. The camera work is great, the Dolby Digital 5.1 (sound) is great and most of all the emotion fantastic.
The only new players to this long standing family band are the spicy conga player and the outstanding new drummer, almost as good as Carlos, but that's a lot of play up to. This DVD is priced well below most, about the same price as a CD, so why not get the video and audio for a buck or two more?  So buy it, play it and enhance your life with life's best music around, yesterday and today.",1042848000,10,1228,3.9635627530364372
1801038,5,B000077VQ5,"Exceptional sound quality and a mega-set song list.  If you've seen JT live, you know there are two ""sets"".  Both are included here.  There are songs from his latest relase and many Taylor classics.  I particularly enjoyed the current arrangement of Steamroller and this version of Sun on the Moon.  The band is stellar and includes long time alums Jimmy Johnson and the drummer that recorded the original Fire and Rain, Russ Kunkel.
A haunting version of Millworker, which begins with bass and guitar, reveal James at his guitar best.
Rounding out the set is a jamming version of the standard, Knock On Wood.
Finally, the last song is just JT and guitar and represents an absolute highlight of this important and thoroughly American artist's ability.",1042329600,2,751,4.928571428571429
1801039,5,B000077VQ5,"I didn't notice if this DVD was taken from various concerts, well done. I love JT songs and the quality of the Dolby Digital sound is outstanding. I have a plasma widescreen tv and the DVD is in widescreen, but the format is not recognized by the DVD player, so I had to adjust the image to fill the whole screen. That minor detail and the camera transition problems didn't stop me from enjoying this GREAT PERFORMANCE!
By the way... he didn't include ""October Road"" in the DVD...",1042243200,,480,4.465909090909091
1801040,5,B000077VQ5,"The advantage that this DVD has over the ""Beacon"" is that it is obviously the best cuts from a number of different performances. I have been following JT since early '69 (the Apple album) and have seen him perform in England on many occasions. I have been fully appreciative of nearly every performance, the main exception being the last tour in September, when most of the musicians were not the ""regular crew"",seemed to be rather sparse in number, and not as ""tight"" as usual.
 This DVD has the benefit of JT being fully ""pumped up"" and giving it his all!.  With the benefit of ""cherry picking"" a number of different performances the result is an impeccable DVD which is superior to the previous VHS/DVD's that have been released before, although the apparent seamless production makes it seem as if it is just one performance.
 The backing singers, brass section....need I say more?",1041638400,14,885,4.809210526315789
1801041,5,B000077VQ5,"If you have the beacon DvD Then you ""REALLY"" Need this one! ther are not many of the classics on the beacon concert but on this one, the hits of old abound! While Becon is good it lacks many great songs,Sweet baby james, Only one, Frozen man,Millworker, and many others ...There all here on this dvd and its fantastic!! James taylor is the greatest singer songwriter ever and he just keeps on proving it over and over again! I saw the pull over tour twice once in ma, at greatwoods and also at jones beach new york, outstanding. Buy it!!!!!!",1040169600,7,541,4.42
1801042,5,B000077VQ5,"I'm a bit torn when it comes to this DVD. On the one hand, James Taylor is an extremely talented musician, especially in concert. The material on this DVD is everything a Taylor fan could hope for - the classics like Fire and Rain, a few less well-known songs such as Frozen Man (beautifully done on this DVD), and some stuff from October Road. But the production values on the DVD itself are a bit less than stellar. The quality of the picture is okay at best, and at times rather poor. Also, whoever did the camera transitions should be fired - call me picky, but the transitions between views were often poorly timed and lent absolutely nothing to the experience of watching the performance.
Still, despite all this, I give it five stars because I love James Taylor, and I love his music. Any fan who can say the same will surely like this DVD. The technical issues aside, I am very pleased with Pull Over. It's no substitute for seeing James perform in person, but it is nevertheless a must-have for James Taylor addicts.",1038787200,38,1025,4.516129032258065
1801043,5,B000077VQ5,"As somebody who has just about everything that James Taylor ever did it'ss hard to belive that, after all these years, he's surpassed all his previous works.
I first saw JT at the City Hall in Newcastle, England in 1970. From that point I knew that this was something different. It wasn't folk, it wasn't rock, it wasn't R&B yet it was all these things. With every album the music got better, brilliant compositions, beautiful lyrics which have only improved with years.
It has to be said, and this is not in any way detrimental to JT's work, that as the band got bigger so did the sound. Until this DVD came out I thought that the JT Live double CD was probably the best live performance, Don Grolnick brought something really special to JT's music at this time, but Clifford Carter has amply stepped in to fill the void left by Don's untimely death.
Pull Over is without doubt JT and Band at the very zenith of his career - just when you thought that 'Hourglass' and 'October Road' were superlative here goes that guy again getting better and better as each year passes.
If you buy 1 DVD this Christmas make sure it's Pull Over. You will not regret.
PS  Just had my fifth viewing of this DVD since it arrived - listen out for the sax and horns and reflect upon Clifford Carter's beautiful extemporation on Hammond Organ.  Great to see Russ Kunkel back also, Don Grolnick & Carlos Vega - wherever you are, rest easy - the bands in good hands.",1038182400,14,1443,4.441509433962264
1801044,4,B000077VQ5,"The concert is fantastic.  Great selection of songs.  The sound is excellent and the widescreen (non-anamorphic) image is a plus (well...better than 4:3).  However, the overall quality of the image could have been a little better.  Anyway, the performance is really good.  Mr. Taylor has a timeless voice and is one of the greatest songwriters of this generation.  If you are a fan, I also recomend the Bacon Hill's concert as well as this one.  The latter's image is not in widescreen but the performance is flawless.",1038182400,,518,4.885057471264368
1801045,5,B000077VQ5,"I must confess I almost passed this one by on the premise that I had his Beacon Theatre performance on DVD and didn't need duplication of material.  However, I was wrong.  This performance far surpasses his earlier DVD for he is more relaxed and seemingly having the time of his life before a wildly enthusiastic audience.  The filming of this performance gives one the feeling of actually being there and the picture and sound quality are outstanding.  I recommend this DVD without reservation.  It is by far the greatest JT performance I have seen thus far.  He just keeps getting better all the time--a consummate artist and icon who richly deserves all the accolades that come to him.  I feel Mr. Taylor has found his way home and is at one with himself and the audience.",1038009600,50,775,4.654411764705882
1801046,1,B000077VQ5,"James and publishers! You won't find a bigger fan than me.  But concert DVD's should be WIDESCREEN from now on!
Especially since the performance shown on HD.NET was so fantastic.  Please re-release this concert in widescreen.  Thx.",1037836800,3,231,5.1891891891891895
1801047,4,B000077VQ5,"I found that James Taylor's latest DVD ""Pull Over"" Is loaded with many of his hits and songs  that promote his latest cd ""October Road"".  This is a fine concert with great picture and sound and I recommend this to any fan who does not own a Taylor DVD.  However, if you own ""James Taylor Live At The Beacon"" I see no reason to purchase this edition unless you are hardcore JT fan.  The Dvd format which is a fantastic medium for concert and digital sound has caused record companies to release live concerts one after another by the same artist to $cash$ in because they know loyal fans will buy everything they put out.  Take my word for it and that is, If you  have the Beacon DVD [which is fantastic] you will not need ""Pull Over"" unless you like duplication?",1037750400,96,762,4.330985915492958

The arrangements were terrible. Flutes and horns with a merengue theme is not what I wanted. People get old and mellow, but this was ridiculous. Save your money, buy JT Live(Double CD). Great album!

7974096,2,B000077VQ5,"A great concert ruined by incredibly poor editing.  There are many camera angles and this video bounces mercilessly between all of them, never spending more than a couple seconds on any one view.  I started praying for a camera shot lasting more than 4 seconds.  After two songs I had a headache.  After 4 songs I felt dizzy.  That's when I turned it off.  I found it unwatchable.  My advice: put it with your CDs, but don't try to watch it.",1456531200,,441,4.37037037037037
