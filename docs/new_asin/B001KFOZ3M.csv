8314916,5,B001KFOZ3M,I am a big fan of Geroge Peppard and this is my favorite Peppard movie......................It's actually about the OAS's (Secret Army Organizations) fight to topple the French Government over their Algerian policy although they do not mention that organization in the movie.............It is one of of the few movies made about this underground war that took place in France in the 1960's.........,1354147200,,398,5.435483870967742
8314917,5,B001KFOZ3M,"""House of Cards"" is a suspenseful thriller staring George Peppard, Orson Wells, and Inger Stevens.  Sadly it's not readily available here in the states so I was delighted to locate it here on Amazon.  Great actors, plot, and music.  You won't be disappointed!",1334793600,2,259,4.976744186046512
8314918,4,B001KFOZ3M,"Why Universal Studios continues to ignore the U.S. when it comes to domestic DVD and blu ray releases of many of it's classic flims is a continuing mystery. The Brazilian Company Classicline is one of the few companies releasing authentic studio versions and since Brazil is a region 1 DVD country--we can enjoy them here.  House of Cards was released in 1968 and starred Orson Wells, George Peppard, Inger Stevens--just to name a few of the luminaries.  The plot is basically this:  a cabal of French colonial exiles from Algeria are plotting a fascist take over of 1960's France.  Not exactly new territory, but an engaging story.  The print is pristine with a fabulous music sound track by Francis Lai.  And the beautiful and tragic Inger Stevens alone is worth the price of admission.

By the way, Classicline also has in its collection the following fabulous movies:  The Glass Key; O.S.S. and the Doris Day film, Midnight Lace.",1334448000,4,933,4.860759493670886
8314919,5,B001KFOZ3M,"Great classic movie with much suspense and intrigue. This movie when it first came out in 1968, was basically a sleeper but when viewed, many hailed it as a good suspense drama with so many great stars. Please bring this movie out in dvd form and I wouldn't be surprised there will be a ""remake"". No one can remake stars as George Peppard, Inger Stevens and Orson Welles, but am sure this generation will try and flop.",1302998400,4,418,4.441558441558442
