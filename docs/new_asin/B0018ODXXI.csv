8270340,5,B0018ODXXI,"I grew up watching this dvd in my mom and dad's home and I've always enjoyed it. They, of course, had it on a VHS tape. I was skeptical about how the quality and sound would be on the dvd version. But I was not disappointed. Now, I am able to enjoy a treasure anytime I want to. Shipping was fast. A great seller!!",1384992000,,314,3.921875
8270341,5,B0018ODXXI,"I have been a fan of John P Kee & New Life since their ""Wash Me"" CD. I have always admired how John P Kee consistently writes and records under the annointing...never compromising his calling by trying to sound overly trendy or commercial.  ""Strength"" is a perfect blend of Ol' Skool & Contemporary.  JPK & NL invite Jesus to ""Come In"" (The House"")and He gladly accepts the invitation..lol  Every song will touch you and inspire you to go further in Christ.  My favorites are ""You Did It All"", ""Clap Your Hands"", ""I Do Worship"" and We Made It"" (Daryl Coley is featured on this track on CD and does a great job, but the one and only Dorinda Clark-Cole brings the heat on the DVD..she is also featured on the title track!  THIS IS CLASSIC JPK & NL AT THEIR BEST!!  I would also check out their ""Show up"" DVD.. it's  another must have!",1350432000,3,832,4.363636363636363
8270342,5,B0018ODXXI,"Arrived on time in good condition. The DVD is great - Pastor Kee doing things back inthe day that were way before its time...

Be blessed...",1252886400,3,140,4.384615384615385
