8714716,5,B00X0UUCA0,"The sound is amazing, the lights in the concert perfect, and the music and performance are incredibly moving. Caspian does both heavy and beautiful well, and often both at the same time. Their dynamic range is truly impressive. Ive never seen them live, but when I closed my eyes at a film screening of Live at Larcom, I could easily imagine myself in the room with them.

I've been thinking about how awesome this concert film is--a full week after seeing it. It's easily as spiritual an experience as I had when I saw Rattle and Hum in theaters (!) as a kid.

Here's the set list:

1.) Cigarette
2.) Quovis / Further Up / Further In
3.) Moksha
4.) The Dove / ASA
5.) Ghost of The Garden City
6.) Malacoda
7.) Concrescence
8.) Sycamore
9.) Gone In Bloom and Bough
10.) Halls of The Summer
11.) Fire Made Flesh
12.) Hymn For The Greatest Generation",1437004800,10,848,4.388535031847134
