3632230,4,B001HN69B8,"Wacky and wild storytelling by ""Monty Python"" and ""Brazil"" director Terry Gilliam&nbsp;&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monty-Python-and-the-Holy-Grail-Special-Edition/dp/B00005O3VC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monty Python and the Holy Grail (Special Edition)</a>] .  Waking this morning to the sun peaking out from dark clouds and wishing to seize the day, I thought I'd spend it by watching ""Imaginarium.""  And Terry's story did seize up my imagination!

If you will, a man who runs a huge temple upon a huge mountain (many Masonic symbols running through the film -- nothing to do with the plot, but interesting) with disciples floating on carpets -- meets the Devil and makes a Faustian bargain -- Parnassus will live a nearly immortal life in exchange for his daughter.  Reproduction comes upon him at 60 (relatively) and his daughter is about to turn 16.  The plot thickens.

The good doctor and his small band run an ""Imaginarium"" which is a large, horse-drawn wagon that rides through modern London streets to entertain and to make a few quid from the passers-by.  Unfortunately, they always seem to park it in a bad parking lot or outside a bar at closing.  To say they get the drunks and weirdies is to say the least!

Where's the magic?  Inside a Mylar mirror.  When Parnassus goes into a trance, one jumps in and finds himself in a world of their own making.  A rich woman is surrounded by diamond-studded Espadrilles.  Another, sailing in a Venice pool.

For some reason, they meet a man and save him from hanging. This is not fully explained but we just go with the flow, you know.  Tony is alternately played by three actors, most likely to compensate for Leger's untimely death and to show alternate Tonys inside the Imaginarium.

Tony (aka swindler and cheat) is falling for Valentina (the bait for the Devil, played playfully by Tom Waites) and decides to ""modernize"" the show.

Decking it out in modern style, parking in malls where rich people hang out, and having Valentina dressing (long locks of hair covering the good parts) like a Godiva.  Lovely.

Gillam's movie does jump around a lot and it is hard to keep track at times -- but if you just put your brain in neutral and enjoy the CGI imagery, it will all be fine.

Some interesting if disturbing (and prophetic) scenes:  The celebrity photos of Rudolph Valentino, Princess Diana and so on float by in little boats.  Johnny Depp's character says that they will live on immortalized. Wow!

Climbing ladders to the stars, dancing policemen in mini-skirts (very Python-esque), crazy trappings, screwy colors -- a druggie's dream for sure.

I'm leaving a lot out of this review because it's really hard to pinpoint what the story is all about.  It's easy to follow the overall plot but the story does lean to and fro in a mishmash of color and light, the dark London exteriors, the rich and powerful wanting a release, the anachronistic Imaginarium, alive and magical, the good Doctor (played awesomely by Christopher Plummer) -- a drunk, a fraud & cheat, or is he really centuries old?

The ending leaves one wondering if the whole movie was just my imagination.

You can get away with grabbing this as a rental.  For Leger's final movie, I would like to imagine Dark Knight&nbsp;] was his better performance.

Sony Pictures Classics presents a film directed by Terry Gilliam. Written by Gilliam and Charles McKeown. Running time: 122 minutes. Rated PG-13 (for violent images, some sensuality, language and smoking).",1264204800,,3747,5.07516339869281
3632231,4,B001HN69B8,"Dr. Parnassus (Christopher Plummer) is immortal. He made a deal with Mr. Nick, aka the devil (Tom Waits), that has kept him alive for over 1000 years, but at a price. Now Dr. Parnassus travels England with his daughter Valentina (Lilly Cole), Percy (Verne Troyer), and Anton (Andrew Garfield) inviting people into his Imaginarium, a place where you can peak into Dr. Parnassus's imagination where you are given a choice between light and darkness. When Mr. Nick shows up with a new challenge to collect five souls first by Valentina's birthday, Dr. Parnassus jumps at the chance. But when they save the allegedly amnesiac Tony (Heath Ledger, Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell), Dr. Parnassus wonders if Tony's been sent by the devil or his chance to right a wrong he made when he gained immortality.

Terry Gilliam is one of the most visually unique directors of all time. From classic movies like Brazil to cult classics like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, the only American from the Monty Python troupe has generally bucked conventions working outside the studio system to create uniquely original works of art. As a result Gilliam is no stranger to controversy and issues with filming. Gilliam's take on Don Quixote was derailed from spectacular budget overruns, back injuries, freakish storms, and more; with the result being so catastrophic it became the subject of the 2002 documentary Lost in La Mancha. But even as devastating as that was, it could never have prepared Gilliam for what befell his 2009 movie The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus. Filming had to be shut down when Heath Ledger died mid-production. Fortunately, Gilliam and co-writer Charles McKeown were able to rewrite partsof the film, and Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell stepped in to finish Ledger's role so the world is able to see his last performance.

The reslut is nothing short of amazing. Imaginarium represents a marked return to Gilliam's former visual style. Being the first movie that Gilliam storyboarded since 1988's The Adventures of Baron Munchasen, you can see the return of certain visuals that remind you of his directorial work with Monty Python as well as his great films like Time Bandits and Brazil. Visually this is one of Gilliam's most over the top films to date, but in the scheme of the Imaginarium it also represents his most successfully use of his visual style in years. The writing also represents one of his most original works in years, while also being one of his deeper works with more fully realized characters than has been present in his movies as of late. Also, the way they handled the passing of one of their main characters was also brilliant and possibly even serves the movie much better than expected and in the end just felt right.

The acting is naturally superb as you'd expect when you view the talent in this movie. Christopher Plummer is a veteran actor (The Philadelphia Story, Hamlet as well as newer movies such as 12 Monkeys, and voice parts in 9 and Up) you'd expect nothing less than a stellar, even Oscar worthy performance from on the screen. And, naturally, Heath Ledger was coming off an Oscar winning performance for his work as Joker in The Dark Knight and was formerly nominated for his role in Brokeback Mountain. While honoring the late Heath Ledger for this posthumously released role would seem the natural thing to do, I'd have to say that the best performances are delivered by Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell. It's hard enough to play a real person, but to step into a role taking over for an actor that passed away, who still remains in the final film is beyond daunting. These three actors take his place in the film admirably, carrying on the spirit of Ledger to the fullest. Even among these Colin Farrell rises to the top in my mind as he ends Ledger's role, having to give the toughest performance of the character.

The only problem I can say that I have with this movie is that at times the plot can be impenetrable and even incoherent at times. For all of Gilliam's strengths, he has a tendency at times to be too in the moment without looking at the full picture, and particularly early on in the movie this can be slightly problematic. At first the movie seems like a series of vignettes rather than part of the whole. You'll also be lucky if, at the end of the movie, you can fully understand what the movie is all about. I'm one of those viewers that loves a movie with replayability, but as is the case with any viewer, it can be frustrating to watch a movie and wonder if it's just your ignorance or the fault of the filmmaker that I didn't completely understand what went on. While I think I have the movie pinned after hours of contemplation, I can't honestly say that I do until I rewatch it, which will be when it comes out on DVD.

Overall, though, I would have to highly recommend this movie. Yeah, it's a mindscrew (I would use other wording, but this is a family friendly publication), but it's a fun mindscrew. Visually stunning, superbly acted, and refreshingly original this is by far Terry Gilliam's best movie in years, and if you like any of his other movies (or Monty Python) you're most likely going to love this movie.

3632232,4,B001HN69B8,"Are you ever in the mood for something fresh and original? Are you tired of all the safe movies designed for the masses? Well, take a trip through the mirror of Doctor Parnassus. Terry Gilliam is a love him or hate him type of director, but for some reason I'm more of in the middle. I like half or so of his films and just don't get the appeal of the others. In this case, I loved just about every second of it.

Most people know that this was Heath Ledger's last role and that he died during the filming process, but what surprised me was how much he is actually in the movie. I would say around 50% of it. His performance is really good here as expected. He totally dropped the Joker influence completely and showed us once again that we were looking at a guy who had just begun to scratch the surface of his talent. Christopher Plummer (Doctor Parnassus) and Tom Waits (Satan) both turn in equally excellent acting showcases. Even newcomer Lily Cole does a good job and is very nice to look at to boot. Verne ""Mini-Me"" Troyer is not the best actor in the world, but he seems to be trying hard and is given a couple of good lines. Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell fill in the gaps that Ledger could obviously not. Depp gets the least amount of time, but all three bring the right amount skill to each ""tribute"" version of Ledger's character. Since Ledger was able to film all the reality parts before his death, his ever changing look could easily be explained in the fantasy realm.

The visuals and music are wacky as can be, but in a good way. It's nice to see so much imagination and unique storytelling in modern cinema. The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is not for everyone, but I think most who give it a shot will find themselves lost in the the mind of one stange filmmaker.",1263340800,214,1794,4.320474777448071
3632233,4,B001HN69B8,"The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is first and foremost a Terry Gilliam film, which could make or break the overall experience for you. Gilliam has a very specific style that is best described as an LSD trip with a more cohesive story. His films are usually incredibly visual, are wrapped around a unique story, and above all else spectacularly weird. The one thing his films can always guarantee though is originality. Doctor Parnassus is very similar to Gilliam's The Brother's Grimm, which also starred Heath Ledger. At least as far as visuals go. So if you're not a fan of other Gilliam films like Time Bandits, Baron Manchausen, Twelve Monkeys, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, The Brothers Grimm, or Tideland among others, then it's safe to say you probably won't enjoy this film.

The other piece of information that's worth knowing going into this is to not expect much Heath Ledger. Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell were brought in for a reason. You're left wanting more, which is probably a good thing. It's not a stab at Depp, Law, or Ferrell as they all portrayed Tony pretty flawlessly. Ledger is around long enough to show potential. He has a few standout scenes and a great speech or two. Then he's gone. Out of the three actors that also played Tony, Depp did the best job. When you first see Johnny Depp as Tony, he still looks like Heath Ledger. His actions, his body language, his dialogue, it all feels like the same character. Without giving too much away, it feels as if Tony changed every time he stepped through the mirror. Well, that's not entirely true. It's more like Tony's true nature was revealed more and more with each transformation. Depp seemed to be the Tony we were first introduced to while Jude Law was the version of Tony that was swept away in Doctor Parnassus' imagination. He wanted to escape. To reach the clouds. Then there's Colin Ferrell who is the true Tony. Despite the fact that four different actors played the same character, it all still felt like the same person.

The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus isn't a film for everyone. It's incredibly bizarre and it takes a while for things to actually get rolling. People who see this film solely for Heath Ledger's appearance will probably be disappointed and those who aren't a fan of Gilliam's work most likely won't have their minds changed with this film. But if you're willing to give a different kind of film a chance, a film that winds up capturing your imagination, then step through the mirror and enjoy the eccentric journey to The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus.",1263168000,98,2581,4.733333333333333
3632234,3,B001HN69B8,"The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus isn't the best movie I have seen and it's not really worthy to have been Heath Ledger's last film. Yet, I liked it for it's odd story and the performance by Christopher Plummer. Ledger is really good too of course but the movie wouldn't have been any better if he was in the whole thing. The script is a mess even if the movie still does manage to be interesting.

  But Ledger deserved to work with the Terry Gilliam that was at the top of his game, the one that made Time Bandits, Brazil and 12 Monkeys. I was hoping that was the Terry Gilliam that made this movie. I was entertained by the oddness of the movie and the visuals but not enough to give it a higher rating. The movie doesn't make enough sense for me to give it a higher rating. The fact that Ledger turns into either Johnny Depp, Jude Law or Colin Farrell when he enters the Imaginarium does add some fun to the movie though.",1262476800,6,927,4.255681818181818
3632235,4,B001HN69B8,"""The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus"" is about as creative as the title suggests, a fable in which the imagination is not merely an escape from reality; it's the very fabric of existence, and as such, how we choose to exist ultimately determines whether or not we're slated for salvation. Director Terry Gilliam considers this an autobiographical film, which I guess is right since it's about a wizened storyteller hindered by a world in which story has been reduced to cheap thrills. Gilliam has a following, no question, but the God's honest truth is that most audiences these days would rather have their brains deadened with assaultive spectacles like ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" or ""G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra."" And studios are happy to produce them because they make money. Does no one want to be told a STORY anymore?

What makes ""Imaginarium"" so refreshing is not so much that it's a cornucopia of visual delights, even though it is, but that the visuals are utilized in a reliable Faustian plot with engaging characters. At the head of the team is Doctor Parnassus (Christopher Plummer), the 1,000-year-old head of an old-time theater troupe travelling across London. Along with his teenage daughter, Valentina (Lily Cole), his illusionist, Anton (Andrew Garfield), and his feisty dwarf sidekick, Percy (Verne Troyer), Parnassus offers audiences a chance to step through a special mirror and watch as their imaginations are vividly brought to life. Is there a catch? Let's just say that Parnassus and the Devil - here named Mr. Nick (Tom Waits), an oily trickster who's never seen without a bowler hat and a cigarette holder clamped between his teeth - made a deal a long, long ago, and it's now time to pay up.

Before long, the troupe stumbles upon a man named Tony (the late Heath Ledger), who they save from dying a horrible death under a bridge. He awakens the next morning claiming to have no memory of who he is or what he had been doing, although we quickly suspect he knows a lot more than he lets on. While not particularly liked by anyone except Valentina, Tony uses both modern aesthetic sensibilities and his own mysterious charm to attract audiences to the Imaginarium, bringing in money and food for the rest of the troupe. It's all well and good, but the question remains: Who is this man? We have no real idea where he came from, and we certainly don't know where he's going. All we do know is that, for most of the film, he seems to be hiding from something. Or someone.

Isn't it strange, how a negative can be turned into a positive? Ledger had finished only one-third of ""Imaginarium"" before his death in January of 2008, leaving Gilliam with the monumental task of finding some way to complete the film. The solution: Cast Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell to play physically transformed versions of Tony, who appear only after he steps through the mirror and into the land of imagination. For an idea that had the potential to go spectacularly wrong, it ended up being one of the film's greatest strengths. This is not only because of Depp, Law, and Farrell, who are great talents and capable of delivering a Ledger-like performance, but also because it's an excellent display of creativity on Gilliam's part. He truly is like Doctor Parnassus, sustaining his own universe by constantly telling stories.

The visuals are an experience unto themselves, as they tend to be in a Terry Gilliam film. Every scene taking place in the realm of imagination is a beautifully realized dreamscape, where fantasy freely shifts back and forth between childish and whimsical to foreign and frightening. Shimmering waters cast perfect reflections. Cartoonish balloons float through the air. Landscapes rise and fall dramatically, with a towering cliff on one end and a flat desert on the other. These scenes alone would have made a strong case for releasing the film in 3-D; watching them is like wandering into a surrealist painting, with textures and patterns so strange and vivid that they practically beg for you to reach out and touch them.

Some, I suspect, will be more taken with the visuals than with the plot, which, I admit, does take some time to sort through. Others may only want the opportunity to see Heath Ledger one last time, and never mind the fact that his costars were just as memorable. What I personally got from ""Imaginarium"" above all else was the sense that I was actually being TOLD something. Are there moments of conjecture, confusion, chaos, and absurdity? Yes to all of the above. But even at its most cerebral, there's always the sense that it's working its way towards a goal, that it wants to be something greater than an astounding visual feast (this definitely doesn't include homage to his Monty Python days - a chorus line of policemen wearing skirts and hosiery). After a summer of repetitive action and nonstop special effects, ""The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus"" comes along and reminds us that imagination is, in fact, a good thing.",1262217600,5,5012,4.850467289719626
3632236,5,B001HN69B8,"What hurdles has Terry Gilliam had to hop during his long and remarkable career? One has but to watch ""Lost in La Mancha"" to catch a glimpse. Then Heath Ledger croaks while this one is well into production. Not to worry, a crew of notables headed up by the thrilling Johnny Depp make a brilliant patchwork quilt of the role Heath was initially to play solo. Certainly would've been a shame to lose the last performance of such a talent on the cutting room floor.

Having supposedly been ""released"" on Christmas day of '09, I was all primed and ready to rush out and catch this one at the theater, however, I can find no showtimes for it anywhere in the U.S. much less my own area. You can't possibly tell me that this film couldn't make money! Sheesh, market it as ""The Last Performance of Heath Ledger"" or ""A Johnny Depp Film"" if you must, there ARE plenty of people out there longing to have more cinematic options than all that glitzy, chintz mediocrity they continuously flood the theater complexes with. Alas, Dr. Parnassus seems to have met the same fate of many recent films which attempt to supercede the limitations of standard mainstream fare-- the money brokers/film distributors won't release them to the ""general public""! Well, I for one, feel more than a bit cheated, much as I was when I couldn't find any listings for the much-heralded film, ""The Road"" starring Viggio Mortensen that was supposedly ""released Thanksgiving Day. It's not as if such a film couldn't make money, all you'd have to do is market it as a film featuring blood-thirsty cannibals in a post-apocalyptic setting and people would come out in droves, am I right? I mean, how many people came out to see 2012 just on the premise that it would show the destruction of this modern-day, nightmare world?

 So what are the REAL motives for keeping such films locked away from our prying eyes? Anyone with keener insight into the methods and rationale employed in this matter, feel free to leave me a comment.

 I have heard rumors that Gilliam is now ready to once again embark on his Quiote epic. Could this really be true? I will keep my fingers and toes crossed.",1261526400,7,2145,4.619422572178478

Besides everyone know there is no Sanity Clause. It is like that too, a Marx Brothers movie if they were still alive and imaginative. How did Terry get Plummer to do this, or all the rest for probably nothing but the accolades?

3632320,2,B001HN69B8,"Review of The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus
Hot Toasty Rag, December 11, 2017

If you know nothing about the backstory of this film, youll be in a much better position to enjoy watching it. Its a very strange fantasy whose setting is a cross between a magicians show and a travelling theater group. The ringleader, Christopher Plummer, has made a deal with the devil before the start of the film: hell live forever but when his daughter Lily Cole turns sixteen, the devil will claim her. After they find Heath Ledger and adopt him into their troupe, their show becomes more strange and fantastical.

The film is split into four sections, and once again, if you don't know the backstory behind these splits, its actually an interesting take on the story. Heath Ledgers character is introduced, and each time he performs the magic show, hes transformed into a different actor to show that the show alters him. The other actors are played by Johnny Depp, Colin Farrell, and Jude Law, and they're all very believable as changed versions of Heath.

The visual aspects are quite impressive, if you like movies like this. As a child, if you loved the odd world of Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, and you usually like magician films, youll probably really love The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus. Parts of it are quite good, but all in all, it was a little too weird for me. Plus, I knew what happened during the making of this film. Once you know what happened, its pretty impossible to like it.",1512950400,,1496,4.680608365019012

Based on the cover I see some mind-control, duality, themes based on the checkers, not my thing, but also the colorful world if you look further into the movies cover.
THAT, is what I thought the movie was going to really be about, and, I guess it was, but not overall.
A lot of the time I think we actually spend in reality in the movie, when, from what I expected, I thought we were going to be in the mirror-world a lot more.
I was looking for fantasy, when I actually got magical realism. Not to mention that I actually thought the movie was quite depressing.
Not that I don't like magical realism, I just prefer fantasy more over it.
This movie also disappointing me on a lot of levels.
I had to watch it two times, let me explain.
The first time, I was so freaking confused. I think I movie is two hours long, and I was pissed off that I wasted my two hours just watching something when I didn't know what the heck was actually happening. And then, on the second watch, I made note to pay more attention, and it actually did make sense on the second watch.
The movie conveys a simple yet complicated idea.
A man makes a deal with the devil to be immortal, ONLY IF he hands any of his children that he may have to him once they turn sixteen. Then, once the immortal mans daughter turns sixteen, he suddenly realizes what a mistake he has made. The devil meets him once again and gives him a deal, first one to five souls wins.
The entire thing is kind of a game. There is this mirror, and inside of it is this whole other world inside of Doctor Parnassus's head, only one you can get into once he is in a trance.
These people step into this mirror, and, at the end, they must either go to the devil, or go with the good guys. If the person goes with the good guy, the good guys get a soul, if the person goes with the devil, the devil gets a soul.
See?
For me, it was hard to keep up with, yet it is a simple idea once you get the hang of it.
Honestly, even though this movie was nominated two times for an award, I don't think it is really worth your time.
I think the whole step through the mirror thing into Dr. Parnassus's head was cool, but it had so much more potential.
Like I said, I thought this movie was also pretty depressing. I can't really explain it, it just isn't the most lightest, most happiest movie you'll watch. I know I sound like I don't know what I am talking about, but I just thought it was overall pretty dark.
The movie is okay. I do recommend you watch it for the mirror stuff, but otherwise it is just a lot of filler and sad. Even the mirror-stuff had WAAAAAAY MORE POTENTIAL!
Instead, I HIGHLY, HIGHLY RECCOMEND you go watch Austenland. That was a happy movie that was more easier to follow and reached a big quantity of it's potential.

I thought this may have been a bit over the top but was in the mood, after a really long day that lasted a week, for a little escape.
I did watch the Art of The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus first. It was free when I saw it.
Great way to preview without trailer highlights & get a feel.

I forgot, how great Heath Ledger is. One of those Kevin Spacey actors that just gets lost in his craft & takes you with him.
I don't normally synopses bc I feel you should discover a story on your own but it's kind of necessary here.
Dr Parnassus has the ability to pull people into his mind to achieve their fantasies.
So take that concept & add  the over the top Monty Python Sir Terry Gilliam, & Heath is just perfect in this beautiful fantasy.

It's very hard to keep a story on point while being pulled into a fantastical, theatrical, mind altering world.
Somehow, that's exactly what was satisfied here.

3632696,5,B001HN69B8,"I had never heard of this film until I saw it as a ""Coming Attractions"" tacked onto another DVD I rented.

This fantasy definitely shows the directorial hand of Terry Gilliam in the acting as well as the sets.  That makes it difficult to summarize, so I'm thankful so many others already have...and in detail, too.

The entire cast is a good one, doing justice to their roles, and the acting frenetic and fast-paced.  TIts good to see Verne Troyer in something besides his Mini-Me role.  he sets are pure Monty Pythonesque. Indeed the entire story is like a dreamnot necessarily a bad one, though occasionally clutching at the borders of the nightmarishdefinitely one which seems to make sense at the time but  upon wakening, cant be described  with any coherency.  Since Heath Ledger died during filming and was replaced by Johnny Depp, Colin Farrell, and Jude Law, that line of demarcation is sadly easy to noteabout a third  into the film.  The way the replacement is done is clever and the audience will accept it easily, however.

All in all, an entertaining film, clever, frenetic, whimsical, though bordering on indescribable in the graphics of its plot. It's a pity it didn't get more publicity and exposure.

3633963,3,B001HN69B8,"I am so sorry to give this movie such a low rating because its not fair to flat out say that a movie sucks without considering the time, planning and work that goes into it.

For me, this movie is so frustrating to watch!  It has all of the ingredients to make a masterpiece... great actors and wonderful special effect ideas.  However, it falls short with big story plot holes, useless scenes and dialogue.  It was as if someone influenced by the movies Brazil and Baron Munchausen (two of my favorite movies) tried to make an epic building it around scenes they wanted to see in the film regardless of the story.  It didn't work.  And I suppose that is the reason I never heard of this film until seeing it on Amazon.com a few days ago.

I removed one star for the long length of the movie.  Easily this story could have been told in an hour and fifteen minutes, not two hours.  While watching it you actually feel as if you are wasting your time.  A movie should never do that.  You should realize so much time has past after you are finished watching it.  Even bad movies keep you engaged while seeing noticing the hilarious blatant faults.  The shots are beautiful and epic, but do nothing to add to the story.  There is a long 5 minute shot of a bird flying that youll never see again in the movie. This movie is filled with empty fluff like this.

I removed a second star because the filmmakers had so much potential at their disposal and yet convoluted the story with huge plot holes and a very cliched ending.

The cast is incredible and giving their very best.  There are some scenes that are simply amazing to watch.  The special effects are sometimes fake looking, but that really worked in this film to embody the fantasy element of the doctor's imaginarium.

The problem with this film mainly lies in the fact that even with such a brilliant cast, I cant say that I particularly felt sympathy for any of them or wanted any of them to succeed or fail.  And ultimately at the end I just didn't care what happened to them.

Again, sorry for the low rating.",1456358400,,2067,4.386842105263158

This film captures the idea of a dream world pretty well, and the fill-ins from Johnny Depp, Colin Ferral and Jude Law are well done. Some of the symbolism is pretty dark, but overall simply because it's Ledger's final film, I was into it. I give a thumbs up.",1454544000,2,497,4.4021739130434785

3635038,5,B001HN69B8,"The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is the opera magna of Terry Gilliam and, tragically, the last film of Heath Ledger. It started filming on December 8, 2007. On January 23, 2008, the day after Heath's death, the production stopped until February 17. On February 18 filming begun again, and Johnny Depp, Colin Farrell and Jude Law came along and finish Heath's performance (later they donated all their salary $ 20 million to Heath's daughter Matilda). Everybody wanted to finish the movie, to show Heath's last performance. In the movie, there are 2 worlds, the real world and the imaginary world. Fortunately, all the scenes of the real world (which were shot in London) were already finished when Heath died. The scenes in the imaginary world were going to be shot in Vancouver. Tony, Heath's character, appears different every time he enters in the Imaginarium. Depp, Law and Farrell, apart of having some physical resemblance in the movie with Heath (same hair, same moustache, same goat beard, same make-up), copied Heath's mimics in the movie, and the film does not get affected by that. The sadness is that Heath does not appear much. The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is a magical, poetic and beautiful movie, with an incredible art direction (Caroline Smith), beautiful cinematography (Nicola Pecorini), brilliant costumes (Monique Prudhomme), beautiful music (Jeff & Mychael Danna) and an amazing cast (Heath, Christopher Plummer, Andrew Garfield, Lily Cole, Verne Troyer, Depp, Law and Farrell, and Tom Waits shining in his amazing & funny portrayal of the Devil). Although the movie is beautiful, to watch The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is painful, because it's the real and artistic prove of Heath's death. At the end of the movie, instead of writing ""A film by Terry Gilliam"", Gilliam wrote in the credits: ""A movie from Heath & friends"". According to Gilliam, that was what the movie was. The film is in memory of Heath and of producer William Vince (who died 5 months after Heath) / Antonia Tejeda Barros (Madrid)",1452384000,,2038,5.068452380952381

Well, take a trip through the mirror of Doctor Parnassus. Terry Gilliam I like his films...

Most people know that this was Heath Ledger's last role and that he died during the filming process, but what surprised me was how much he is actually in the movie.
I would say around 50% of it.
His performance is really good here as expected. He showed us that we were looking at a guy who had just begun to scratch the surface of his talent.

Christopher Plummer (Doctor Parnassus) and Tom Waits (Satan) both turn in equally excellent acting showcases. Even newcomer Lily Cole does a good job. Verne ""Mini-Me"" Troyer  Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell fill in the gaps that Ledger could obviously not. Depp gets the least amount of time, but all three bring the right amount skill to each ""tribute"" version of Ledger's character. Since Ledger was able to film all the reality parts before his death, his ever changing look could easily be explained in the fantasy realm.

I think most who give it a shot will find themselves lost in the the mind of one Dr Parnassus and love it. :-)

The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is first and foremost a Terry Gilliam film, which could make or break the overall experience for you. Gilliam has a very specific style that is best described as an LSD trip with a more cohesive story. His films are usually incredibly visual, are wrapped around a unique story, and above all else spectacularly weird. The one thing his films can always guarantee though is originality. Doctor Parnassus is very similar to Gilliam's The Brother's Grimm, which also starred Heath Ledger. At least as far as visuals go. So if you're not a fan of other Gilliam films like Time Bandits, Baron Manchausen, Twelve Monkeys, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, The Brothers Grimm, or Tideland among others, then it's safe to say you probably won't enjoy this film.

The other piece of information that's worth knowing going into this is to not expect much Heath Ledger. Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell were brought in for a reason. You're left wanting more, which is probably a good thing. It's not a stab at Depp, Law, or Ferrell as they all portrayed Tony pretty flawlessly. Ledger is around long enough to show potential. He has a few standout scenes and a great speech or two. Then he's gone. Out of the three actors that also played Tony, Depp did the best job. When you first see Johnny Depp as Tony, he still looks like Heath Ledger. His actions, his body language, his dialogue, it all feels like the same character. Without giving too much away, it feels as if Tony changed every time he stepped through the mirror. Well, that's not entirely true. It's more like Tony's true nature was revealed more and more with each transformation.",1451260800,,2881,4.6171875
3635066,1,B001HN69B8,"I'm glad this was on prime and I only lost two hours of my life and not two hours of my life plus money. The trailers made it seem like some fantastical story taking place in imagination, instead you have imaginary statutory rape... Yeah, she wasn't quite 16 yet, woman and child abuse, but that's okay because hey Tony was just imagining he was doing that....
There was little point, and I wasn't entertained which I think is the whole point of a movie, to be entertained. Anyway unless you're inclined to say you like something just because it's artsy, then I can't see the point in liking this movie",1450656000,3,602,4.4818181818181815

The way they transitioned the other actors to play the part that Heath Ledger had started was marvelous. For most of the real world scenes Ledger had already filmed the scenes before he died. So the other actors playing Tony had scenes in the imaginarium. There must have been minor changes in the script to allow the character to be surprised each time he had a new face once he entered the imaginarium world. The transitions were done very well.
At the beginning of the film my husband could not see the point of the film, he didn't really see the plot. But I found it full of symbolism that I thoroughly enjoyed. The acting was excellent. I give this film five stars, I was completely entertained.",1449273600,3,779,4.416666666666667

Nice that these characters were fun and Heath's last character was not the devastatingly damaged and dark Joker.

There for, there is little visual focus data for the conversion algorithm to work with ... and then the movie stays basically 2D .. oh well. Still glorious. :)",1434672000,,534,4.095238095238095

This is in that camp. It's terribly directed, horribly acted, incomprehensibly written, even more incomprehensibly edited, pretentious and precious as all hell, and, most unusually for a Gilliam film, it looks awful, truly awful. I know he was forced to improvise around Heath Ledger's death, but that's neither an explanation nor an excuse for how slapdash and muddled and downright amateurish much of this is. I found it almost physically excruciating to sit through this depressing mess. The only other director I know who veers so inexplicably from very good to hideous bad is Ridley Scott. The long drop from Brazil to this movie is like the vast distance between Alien and Prometheus. I don't care if you're the most slavish Gilliam or Ledger groupie in the cosmos, you can't truly believe this isn't utter, demoralizing crap.",1420675200,2,1004,4.911764705882353

I thought the plot was good, though in a way predictable.  However, it is in that predictability that leads to a strength of the overall film, Why does Dr. Parnassus continually deal and bet the devil?  The question continues even until the end which I did like.

3637078,4,B001HN69B8,"I found this film quite watchable, although it is definitely not amongst Terry Gilliam's best works. Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.

Doctor Parnassus (Christopher Plummer, impressive as always) is an old immortal magician and leader of a little wandering troupe of entertainers, which includes his teenage daughter Valentina (Lily Cole, cute as a button), a young talented prestidigitator Anton (Andrew Garfield, very endearing) and a midget called Percy (Verne Troyer, excellent) who is also his old friend and confidante. They are not rich, but they are a mostly happy bunch, with the exception of Doctor Parnassus, whose soul is greatly burdened by a heavy and dark secret - during his very long life he made a series of bets with the Devil (Tom Waits, absolutely wonderful) and although he won most of them (hence his immortality) he also once lost. BIG TIME! And the time is close when this gambling debt of very peculiar nature will be collected... Then, one day, the troupe finds a man (Heath Ledger) hanged by his neck from from a bridge - and that guy is not entirely dead yet... And then the story really begins.

This film is obviously inspired by ""Faust"" but also by ""The Seventh Seal"" (the game the hero plays with the supernatural entity) and I think also a little by ""Master and Margaret"" by Bulgakov - and visually most probably by some Salvador Dali paintings. The general tone is however more Bulgakov than Goethe and definitely not as dark as Bergman's film.

Terry Gilliam is certainly a great director and his works are deservedly considered amongst the most creatively original and artistically ambitious and when he does a good film, this film is usually VERY good. I personally count three of his works amongst my most favourite viewings - ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"", ""Brazil"" and the grandiose ""12 Monkeys"". I also rather liked ""Jabberwocky"", ""Time bandits"" and ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"". I still have to see ""The Fisher King"", ""Tideland"", ""Brothers Grimm"" and this ""Johny Depp in Las Vegas"" movie.

This film, I found it weaker than the six other Gilliam's movies I saw. Now, it is not bad, that much is clear, but it slightly disappointed me. Part of it is definitely not Terry Gilliam's fault but is the the consequence of Heath Ledger's unfortunate demise when this film was still being made - which made it necessary to rewrite the scenario, so no less than three other actors had to replace him in some sequences: Johny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell. This re-writing of scenario didn't make this film any good. At all.

Partly however the problem lays with the original scenario. There is simply not enough story to fill the 123 minutes and as result for the first time ever during a Terry Gilliam's movie I became bored at one moment - and that was definitely a new feeling for me... Also, for the life of me I couldn't understand what were the rules of the game Doctor Parnassus and the Devil (here called mostly Mister Nick) play since centuries...

On another hand I liked the twists in the story and especially the ending - of which I will not say anything. And I definitely was charmed by the Devil...)))

3637471,4,B001HN69B8,"Terry Gilliam films are certainly not to everyone's taste (I myself am not really one of his fans), and this film will certainly be no exception. However, to paraphrase one of the other reviewers, anyone walking into a Gilliam film and expecting a coherent narrative has obviously been comatose for a very long time. So at best one goes into the film having some idea of what to expect (or, better yet, what not to expect). Simply put, this film definitely worked for me. While this dark fairy tale certainly does not always make sense, it is so wildly imaginative and visually stunning that you should just abandon yourself to it and enjoy it. Some people will see the film just out of curiosity in that it is Heath Ledger's last. Just about everyone knows that Ledger died while filming, and that Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell stepped in to see that the film was completed, so there is some added poignancy in the films dedication: ""A film from Heath Ledger and his friends."" Gilliam did what he could to work around Ledger's untimely death, and the use of the other three actors is pretty successful (at least it makes sense within the context of the movie). But this is definitely a director's film, and if you enjoy being witness to someone's (Gilliam's) imagination allowed to run wild, then you should be a fan of this film.",1341532800,,1342,4.619246861924686

3637553,5,B001HN69B8,"When Heath Ledger, Jude Law and Johnny Depp all play the same character (Tony, the philanthropist), you know you've got one heck of a movie.

Doctor Parnassus (Christopher Plummer) has made a deal with the devil, and now he's trying to renegotiate it. Fortunately, the devil is a gambling man (naturally), so they come up with a bet to avoid Parnassus having to turn over his beautiful daughter Valentina (Lily Cole). The old doc knows some real magic, and he is immortal, but that doesn't mean he can win a contest with another magic-working immortal.

But Parnassus has help. Said Valentina, of course, although she doesn't learn why until later; and his faithful Anton (Andrew Garfield), who plays Mercury in the carny side-show called, appropriately enough, the Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus. Percy is also a great help and very wise, and possibly immortal himself: he's played by Verne Troyer, whom you may remember as Griphook the Goblin in Harry Potter. He distinguishes himself from a midget by saying that if he were to quit the show, Parnassus would have to hire a midget, ""a little taller than me.""

And then there's Tony (Heath Ledger, at first). Valentina, Anton and Percy fish him out from under a bridge, where he is hanging by his neck, but not quite dead. When he wakes up, he has no memory of who he is or why he had been hanged. Valentina calls him George, but eventually we discover that he is Tony, a philanthropist who is somehow in disgrace and in the newspapers as a liar.

Then there's the mirror. It's actually just a couple of pieces of shiny mylar split in the middle so one can go through it. But you don't just end up backstage in the carnival cart. Where you end up depends entirely on Imagination. Yours? Parnassus'? Not clear. But Doctor Parnassus has to be in a trance for it to work at all. At one point Tony jumps through and just finds himself in the back of the cart because Parnassus was not in a trance. He was, however, drunk.

Fun and frantic and with many sly little digs at the foibles of people who come to see the show. And mostly, rich with imagination.",1336694400,,2102,4.579787234042553

3637555,1,B001HN69B8,"So this is how the world will remember Heath Ledger? Gee I hope not or else 'ol Heath will be spinning in his grave. The premise (I think) is some guy has a curtain where people go through it and come out a better happier person. I wish I could say the same about myself after watching this colorful turd.

The problem is with Terry Gilliam's trademark style of bland forgettable characters and a boring/predictable story which makes for an excurciating watch which feels like a long bad acid trip. Terry tries to overcompensate for his lack of substance by using dazzling visuals, which just come off as a distraction from the weak and sloppy storyline. From what I remember from the story, the main character (who was played by like 4 different actors, in case you're not confused enough) gets volunteers to go into a curtain into his rape dungeon or whatever and they all proclaim it's the best thing since sliced bread, and yet everyone is still skeptical. All of the scenes were either in the fantasy land that shows you a whole lot of nothing or the circus preformers hanging out in the mud outside. That's about all I could remember before I turned it off. I do have to admit though the Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus does make for a good coaster for my coffee mug.

It just never went anywhere, unless you count all of over the place, going somewhere. It was really a waste of time, also for the great actor Christopher Plummer. I can't figure out why any of the fine actors in this film signed on-especially the ones who filled in for Ledger after his death. And why three of them? To make the storyline, whatever it was, seem more confusing, weird, creepy and depressing? Well, mission accomplished then. If there are people out there, who justify this film with the prhase, 'this is my kind of weird', then that is what they are signing on for by watching this film.

3637606,4,B001HN69B8,"First, I have always loved Terry Gilliam as a director, animator and human Being. His humor is unique, his visual style thrilling to say the least. His fights for artistic integrity are now legendery (Book: The Battle for Brazil). He took out a full page ad in Variety in 1984  when Universal head mogul and NON art film fan Sid Sheinberg could not issue a release of Gilliam's 142 minute version of Brazil,  "" Sid Sheinberg, When are you going to release my movie, Brazil, Terry Gilliam."" (this is for real folks, Gilliam pissed off the SUITS who had no idea what his movie was about.) Sid Sheinbetrg went on to complain Brazil had no audience and was too cerebral for the 'average' film goer. Nice thinking Sid. He went on to finance and co-produce two of the WORST films of all-time, the insufferable remake of the Tv series, McHale's Navy , and Sugar and Spice (about cheerleaders who rob a bank) both below one star efforts. His future releases were almost as bad as executive producer. He and Gilliam parted on the worst of terms. Sheinberg in his anger released an 'edited"" version of Brazil with a 'happy"" ending that made absoluletly no sense, except to SID, who pissed off Gilliam, and his fans. The CRITERIAN collection of BRAZIL on DVD offers Sid's version along with Gilliams 142 minute version. Sid, the businessman, retired from MCA several years ago having kept them 'in the black"" and is regarded as a business maven. But his lack of understanding and enthusiasm for an ""art house"" film as he called Brazil leads one to wonder why he was EVER in the motion picture business. Well, there I said the EVIL word-BUSINESS. That is ALL a film was to SID-a product to get consumers into a theater. Sid's world view did not encompass self-righteous intellectual twits such as Gilliam.

I mention the above because DR PARNASSUS brings back the visual style reminiscent of Brazil and is co-written by Brazil writer Charles McKeon so there are similarities. This is a very visually appealing film (and this is a FILM, not a movie). Unfortunately, his lead actor died at a most inopportune moment, approximately 2/3rds through the film. Some are speculating Gilliam had the script rewritten and INTENDED for three other actors, Depp, Law, and Farrell to replace Ledger. Is anyone sure of this? I know Depp filled in immediately as he is a long-time friend of Gilliam, but I am not sure Gilliam intended for Depp to depart to be replaced by Farrell. Is there conversation of this on the DVD?

This ia good film, it is more personal and less worldly than Brazil. It is more ambitious than some of Gilliam's more recent films and it has some fine acting from the entire cast. Plummer was expected to be great, Tom Waits, you never know, but he was superb. The newcomer (at least I am not familiar with her work) Lily Cole is also outstanding. Ledger and the subsequent versions of Tony also shine. It is the literal meaning and layers of the films subtext that I am not convinced on two viewings are made apparantely clear. With Gilliam, that is partially intended,. so I take it as it is. Four stars, five is someone can sum up the entire films true meaning but I think Gilliam INTENDS for the viewer to make his own personal determinations. One last word, this is not an entirely original thematic or visual style. Just refer to George pal's 1964 great fantasy 'The 7 faces of Dr. Lau,"" and you will see this film is almost an homage in style. (but certainly not content).
P.S.

Sometimes you'd experience really bizarre and yet, totally fascinating creatures floating around at the most unusual of moments.  The movie really does a nice job incorporating the dream-like fantasy elements.

However, if there'a any kind of coherence in the storyline I seriously couldn't find it.  In fact, if there's a storyline *itself* I couldn't find it.  I found absolutely nothing intelligible about the entire film.  It makes me wonder if the entire purpose of the movie was to just show off the latest technology in movie making.

What I gathered is that there's apparently this group of people consisting of a man and a woman, they like to dress up as part of a stage show and perform for people by dancing and acting.  They tend to perform in the middle of nowhere, in the middle of the night, in front of nobody.  It's true!  I really have no idea what kind of audience such a pointless display of weirdness is supposed to attract (in both the movie *and* in real life, hehe) but there you have it.

Sometimes an old man and a midget would appear on screen, and neither of these two characters did anything as far as character development or providing any kind of entertainment for the viewers.  Perhaps there's an element of humor implemented that I wasn't able to grasp, but if that's the case, well, you can't really combine humor with a disjointed storyline concerning a fantasy world can you?  Because now the majority of the audience is left sitting there totally confused.

I viewed it already knowing what the story was and I still could find nothing intelligible in it. Whatever Terry Gilliam was trying to say wasn't comprehensible to me.

There are obviously people who like this kind of movie, but to me it seemed to be pure self-indulgence on the director's part. The whole thing needed stripping down and remaking by someone to whom telling a story mattered. As a 5-minute music video it might have worked; as a two-hour movie it just meandered pointlessly along, a series of barely connected scenes in which anything that Gilliam happened to think of was filmed and included in the movie.",1300665600,7,757,4.649253731343284

3637654,3,B001HN69B8,"In `The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus' we see the Doctor, who made a bet with the devil, fight to keep his daughter out of his clutches.  Through a variety of bets the Doctor and devil interact and fight for the souls of viewers of the doctors travelling carnival show, within which the Doctor can guide their imaginations.

Despite being set in the present time this film has lots of fantasy elements and as we have come to expect from Terry Gilliam, some of these can be a touch bizarre or disquieting.  Also some of these fantasy scenes are a touch `python-esque' as well, especially where there is a troop of dancing policemen in fish-net tights!!

Heath Ledger is very good in his role and his untimely death during filming is dealt with as well as can be in the circumstance and Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell all step in to fulfil the role he starts.

However good this film is, I also found it quite disjointed and the fantasy aspects don't sit well next to the present day scenes.  For films where this is carried out to perfection see `The Fall' which blends the present day and fantasy scenes with mastery and skill.  Also, sadly, due to Ledgers death his character never feels fully rounded and you never fully appreciate what drives him throughout the film.  I think some of my ambivalence towards this film is that I never fully cared what happened to any of the characters, I happily watched them on screen, but wasn't bothered what happened to them one way or the other.  Saying this Andrew Garfield played his role excellently and there is some good acting from all involved.

All in all this is a good film, but it feels as if something key to it's success is lacking. It passed the time well enough and I enjoyed it for the duration of the viewing, but it's not one I'll rush to watch again any time soon.

Parnassus comes fully equipped with the director's requisites: drastically eccentric characters, gorgeous cinematography, far-left-field humor, delicate plot and utterly befuddling dialog. The scenes set inside the imaginarium itself are fantastic, dream logic-dominated landscapes on par with Michel Gondry's best work, where we're encouraged to celebrate the fact that absolutely nothing is static and chaos rules. Unfortunately, the real world scenes do nothing to lasso the film to the ground in any way, a function which was desperately needed. When the dust settled, I... think... I understood what this was all about? That's more than I could've said for some of the Python alum's other work, at least after one viewing. Either way, it's basically a moving painting.

3637658,4,B001HN69B8,"I resisted seeing this movie because I tend to find most ""arty"" films slow, depressing, and full of people that I couldn't care less about if I tried. As for Gilliam, while I loved Time Bandits and The Fisher King and I really liked 12 Monkeys, I couldn't stand The Brothers Grimm and there are several others that I never had the slightest urge to see. I can honestly say that I didn't want to see this movie and only watched it because my husband wanted to see it.  My only expectation going in was that I was going to hate it and/or be completely bored.  Much to my surprise, none of my expectations were met.  I really really enjoyed this movie!

Yes, the story meanders a bit -- Valentina (Lily Cole) even complains, angrily, to her father, Dr Parnassus (Plummer), ""You never finish your stories!"" I'm sure that it's a criticism that Gilliam has probably heard, himself. Yes, it is a bit disjointed and some questions are never answered. Yes, Farrell is definitely the weakest of the three actors that stepped into Ledger's role. And, finally, the ending was anti-climatic and a bit ""meh"" (and raised more unanswered questions, but not any that have to be answered to get the movie). So, why did I give it 4 stars? Because the more I think about the movie, the more I like it.

Unlike some of the reviewers, I didn't find it confusing or hard to follow. I was interested in what was going to happen to these people. I found some of the points that Gilliam raised very intriguing -- ie, the role of the storyteller in today's society; the nature of ""choice"" and good vs. evil and what actually constitutes ""evil"". I liked that -- in the interest of not spoiling it in any way, I'll just say that I like that a couple of the characters really surprised me in the end because they either were not, or were not wholly, who I thought they were. And visually? Well, as everyone else has pointed out, visually it was a treat.

I don't think that this movie is for everyone, obviously.  I've read quite a few reviews of it and people tend to either really love it or hate it with a burning passion.  I haven't really figured out what those of us who love it have in common, though, or what unites those that hate it, other than their antipathy.  Consequently, it's difficult to say, ""Yes, you will love this movie!  Run out and see it now!""  However, if you like fables, fairy tales, and fantastically, dream-like imagery, if you can deal with a plot that isn't entirely straightforward, if you can live with not having all of the questions answered at the end -- you might really like this movie a lot, too.  If nothing else, like me, you could be pleasantly surprised by how much you enjoyed it, too.",1296777600,,2699,4.441295546558704

When Johnny Depp fills in for Ledger, it's a scary resemblance. These two could have been a great pair.

I cannot explain the story but do recommend this to mature viewers. Yes, it's a PG-13 film but alot of people probably won't like the style of Terry Gillam.

3637744,2,B001HN69B8,"Oh great, another stupid movie about a girl losing her innocence.  No, wait, it's the theme of Faust.  No wait, it's a metaphor about art imitating life, or life imitating art, or whatever---oh god, it's all three.  Upon the first 15 minutes of the movie, I was so tempted to draw positive parallels with my favorite Gilliam movie, The Adventures of Baron Von Munchausen.  I tried, I really did.  Trouble is, where the good baron was supported by his own sense of wonder and imagination, this movie's own wonder and imagination gave out all too quickly.  For this writer, two themes have almost always been predominant in most of Gilliam's works.  The first is of magic of storytelling.  You see this in Time Bandits, where some of the most well-known story characters endure and take on a life of their own; even better, the Munchausen film shows us how stories can heal and even resurrect.  The second theme, is of how you can tell the measure of a person once the proverbial scales get lifted from their eyes and the truth gets revealed.  This one you see in Brazil and Fisher King and even 12 monkeys.  In this movie, stories are told, but rarely finished, and the storyteller never has anything good happen to him.  Also, despite the fact that Tony's real face, so to speak, is revealed at least 3 different times throughout the film, the fact that nobody accepts the reality of who he really is is a testament to each character's respective stupidity-and a blow to the credibility of the narrative itself.  As for said narrative, it seems like nothing more than a half-assed attempt to lazily string together barely germinated ideas for other storylines.  It is as insubstantial as the characters which have seemed to permeate Gilliams movie's as of late.  This can especially be said of the character, Valentina, who is never anything more than a prize:  soul for the devil, ownership for the father, sex for Tony-take your pick.  Ledger's death did nothing to mar the quality of this film.  It would still have been just as nonsensical as ever.  Ledger himself is decent.  In fact, the acting is above average, though I found myself getting sick of looking at Lilly Cole's face.  There was something really annoying about it.  Watch, however, for a pretty steady performance from Verne Troyer as Percy.  Is Imaginarium worth the ticket, so to speak?

If I'd known, I would have skipped it as Gilliam's movies are always incoherent as if conceived in a drug haze...or something. As it was the thing pulled me in from the beginning and I stuck with it, however near the end, like everyone else, I had no idea what was going on.

The special effects were stunning. I especially liked the metaphor destruction of the drunken young man at the beginning. After he slips through ""the mirror"" on stage, he ends up in a Salvador Dali-like world where he has 2 choices: climb the terribly high steps of knowledge and achievement at the heavenly castle, or immediately get drunker at the pub next to it. He of course takes the ""easy road"" and soon after he enters, the pub explodes.

The acting and actors were especially good, all of them seemed to have a chemistry. Vern Troyer (Mini-Me) finally gets to speak and has a big part. He surprisingly held his ground with classic trained actors like Ledger and Plummer. And his big eyes hold you mesmerized. When he's on screen, you can't take your eyes off him.

3637748,5,B001HN69B8,"I'm writing this as a tear rolls down my cheek and the credits roll across the screen after having just viewed this film.  Before seeing it, I read most the reviews out here and I'm glad I did.  Any review of this film giving praise are the only reviews, in my opinion, which are worthy of note.  Anyone who gives a negative review has no appreciation for art, very little imagination, nor much respect for the film crew.  I can only imagine how difficult it must have been for everyone to continue work on this after having lost a dear friend and inspiration...

So, the reason I cried at the end of this film is not because it is so sad, but because we have tragically lost, very likely, the most talented actor in our lifetime.  Having said that, I would like to segue this review into talking about Terry Gillian.  I cannot think of a film Terry has done that I do not like.  I'm a huge fan.  In the first scene where the camera steps into the Imaginarium, I am reminded how Terry would have made a great choice for doing a J.R.R. Tolkien story.  The landscapes, the sounds, the story lines, and the characters Terry puts together are so fantastical and rich in art that we are very lucky to have Mr. Gilliam entertain us.

Without going into any details regarding the story line, I will say this... it strikes chords within us that stretch themes and characters from ancient time into modern struggles and scenery.  The whole crew was amazing.  The acting was amazing, the wardrobe was amazing, the stages were amazing, the makeup was amazing, the sounds were amazing, and the graphic art was amazing. It's been a long time since I enjoyed a film this good.  I hope you enjoy it too.  This is a no brainer 5 star film for me, and a wonderful tribute to the late great Heath Ledger.  I will undoubtedly watch this film several more times!",1289088000,8,1842,4.421364985163205

I was very puzzled and astonished by everything that went on in the movie, the plot is pure genius and the twists are just wow. I was rather confused by the ending though, I'm afraid saying more than that would be spoiling the movie. I think more should have been put into the ending, it almost seemed like it had a different ending but then the producers/editors didn't like it and added/snipped a bit.

3637771,3,B001HN69B8,"I think the best word to describe this movie is ""surreal"".
I *LOVED* the basic concept-- the theme of the importance of imagination and storytelling-- but something about the plot and storyline doesn't quite work for me, and I can't put my finger on it. Without going into spoilers, I think I was not so happy with the direction that the development of Tony's character takes, and above all with the details of Parnassus' final bargain with 'Nick'. I also felt there were one or two loose ends left hanging.",1286409600,2,507,4.644444444444445
3637772,3,B001HN69B8,"You might know Parnassus from Mount Parnassus, a limestone mountain in central Greece in Dephi.  It was sacred to Apollo, the Corycian nymphs, and the home of the Muses. You might know Parnassus as the son of the nymph of Kleodora, the inventor of the art of foretelling the future from a flight of birds.  Or you might know Parnassus as Dr. Parnassus.  In which case half of The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus won't make sense at all.

See, if you understand the mythological roots of Terry Gilliam's mid-life crisis movie, you understand there's all these birds, why the troupe dresses up as characters from Greek myth, and why the Imaginarium is a place of wonder, inspiration, and death.

Doctor Parnassus' (Christopher Plummer) Imaginarium is housed in an anachronistic wagon that trolls through London's seedier districts. He leads a theatre troupe that includes leading man Anton (Andrew Garfield), diminutive advisor Percy (Verne Troyer), and Parnassus' cherubic daughter Valentina (Lily Cole). Their production blurs the line between performance and audience as unruly passersby crash into the stage and the Imaginarium, their souls put to the test of their own imaginations. Unsurprisingly, those of a petty disposition succumb to their worst urges and lose their souls to Mr. Nick (Tom Waits).

There's a devil's deal between Parnassus, a sort of white man's Buddha, and Mr. Nick. Parnassus fell in love with a mortal girl and gave up his own immortality so that he may woo her.  Their union created Valentina, but there was a catch - the girl's soul is Nick's when she turns 16, and her birthday is just around the corner. But Nick is willing to cut another deal to free Valentina in a wager over who wins five souls first.

Into this traditional tale of wisdom vs. temptation strays the Hanged Man in the awful guise of poor Heath Ledger.  Going by the name of Tony, the Hanged Man is a wild card.  He is a liar, a cheat, a thief, and a cad, but he is far more charming than Mr. Nick and far wiser in the ways of mankind than Parnassus.  He is humanity, given every gift and wasting it all to just for a few more seconds at the end of a rope that has yet to go taut.  The Hanged Man never realizes that the noose was never slack in the first place...until he reaches the end of the rope.

Traditional moralistic notions of good and evil are absent here.  The Imaginarium is more Buddhist than Christian, and souls reach enlightenment by reveling in their own selfish natures.  Old Nick is hardly the demonic Satan; he is as much a counterbalance to Parnassus as he is a player in the great game of souls, far more interested in keeping the game's momentum moving forward than actually winning it. Unlike Nick, the Hanged Man keeps cheating death and thereby cheating on the Game, which is the greatest sin in the film's twisty ethos.

The irony of Ledger playing a character constantly avoiding (and ultimately succumbing) to the noose is agonizing to watch and lends far more pathos than this self-indulgent film probably deserves.  It's a fine tribute to Ledger's life and death that in the imagination, three muses portray him (Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell).  They are suave, slick, and vulgar respectively - but all devastatingly handsome in their own way.  Gilliam's film reaches new heights because of these reflections of Ledger, which are in turn reflections of Tony. It's truly a gift no director could ever want.",1285027200,4,3445,4.769360269360269

3637776,4,B001HN69B8,"I saw many previews of this film and choose to see it because one does not see that many movies in this genre.  It is an adult fairy tale on what is means to us to have our imaginary world once we are no longer children.  Dr. Parnassus has a traveling theatre and he has been living on the fringes of society.  His companions are his 16 year old daughter, a young actor Anton and a midget that is sort of his best friend/conscience.

But Dr. Parnassus also has a secret.  He has made a deal with the devil and their mind game seems to be never ending.  Things would be better if their wagers concern only two of them - but that is not the case.  Both devil and Dr. Parnassus are risk takers and gamblers and they take no prisoners.  Everyone is a fair game.

There is also a fantastic cast of actors that includes late Heath Ledgers, Johhny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Ferrell; not to mention Christopher Plummer.  I truly liked gypsy-like costumes and interior of their traveling caravan.  Their are some parts that are quity witty in the film but at times story seems to be dragging on and that is why I gave it only 4 stars.

It is also difficult to watch this film and not reflect to the fact that this is Heath Ledger's last film before his tragic death.  I found myself looking at his face and eyes for tales and signs of personal struggle.  He looks tired and rugged that fits his role, but his performance is just as sublime as it can possibly be.

3637779,3,B001HN69B8,"Having just watched Imaginarium for the first time today, I can see why this film has a polarizing effect on Gilliam fans.  I am a Gilliam fan and will defend his work all day, but this film...I don't know.  Let's get one thing out of the way right now, and I don't mean to disrespect the dead, but Heath Ledger does not bring his A-game to this movie.  He shows apparent signs of what eventually killed him.  He's rather sluggish and doesn't have enough screen time to really delve deep into character.  Even had he survived, this role would not be one that I would point to as a career highlight.  I guess others are seeing something in his performance that I am completely missing.  Perhaps because I walked into this film as more of a Gilliam fan instead of being a Ledger fan, I can be a bit more objective in criticizing.  And I realized the problem as soon as Ledger walked through the mirror for the first time.  That this movie would've been that much better had Johnny Depp played the role of Tony.  He's would've been perfect for the mysterious charming con-man and as soon as he comes on, you realize that here's someone who's healthy with a clear mind who could've brought some real meat to the role.  Depp could play that Jack Sparrow/Ed Wood enthusiasm and the role would be that much better  Jude Law and Colin Farrell are also excellent in the role and I could've seen either of them in the movie for the duration as well.  And frankly they outshine Ledger at every turn.

And I'm not bashing Ledger.  To compare I watched The Brothers Grimm in which Gilliam also directed Ledger and it is night and day in comparison.  In that film Ledger is firing on all cylinders and grabs his role with pleasure and relish.  And just 3 years later we see the same man in his last role, in which to add insult to injury, three other actors outshine the man in his own last film.  I don't know if Gilliam even should have completed the film in the first place.  Besides the obvious macabre box office attraction of seeing someone who died during the production.  The whole effort is shadowed by tragedy and a curious absence of humor which, either dark or light, always has shown up in previous Gilliam features; Tideland perhaps being an exception.  It is not like the screen was crackling with acting magic when Ledger was on screen.  His shots all seemed like fillers that would have to be reshot later with pick-ups because the scenes in the film don't justify the praise.  And despite the always enjoyable Christopher Plummer and Tom Waits, the film just can't lift off the ground.  Even Verne Troyer is good in this film.  The visuals are all right, but Gilliam has produced better as well.  By far Gilliam's weakest effort and here's to hoping that his Don Quixote project gets up and running soon.",1281225600,,2808,4.5

I had wandered into this film hoping for something in the line of the brilliant Stardust.  Unfortunately, this is more on a par with Death Race, if it was directed by Uwe Boll, that is.  There are several ugly and distasteful characters thrown at you from the start, but fortunately they are left completely undeveloped so we are spared their story.  It appears that the film is more based upon trippy visuals than any kind of actual story line.

There is some muddled bit about bets with the devil to steal souls, or something like that.  I found I didn't care for long, and you likely won't either.

A brilliant turn of the script, however, turned what could have been the downfall of the movie into an interesting plot device.

This movie is not for everyone, and those coming into this film expecting the more ""main-stream"" version of Terry Gilliam, a la ""12 Monkeys,"" will be disappointed.

3637835,4,B001HN69B8,"""The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus"" will, of course, go down in history as the movie Heath Ledger was working on at the time of his death.  But rather than let the movie die with his star, director Terry Gilliam hired several of Ledger's fellow actors - Johnny Depp, Colin Farrell and Jude Law - to take Ledger`s place in the few scenes that still remained to be filmed.  As such, it would be easy to focus on this rather unique turn of events and not on the fact that the finished product stands as an absorbing, imaginative and thought-provoking work in its own right.

By setting his tale in the modern world, Gilliam brings a discipline to his storytelling and a reality to his flights of fancy that, in some of his previous works, have managed to get away from him.  The narrative focuses on a second-rate carnival troupe that travels around London in an elaborate but rickety carriage playing to inattentive, unappreciative - sometimes even downright hostile - audiences.  The troupe consists of Dr. Parnassus (Christopher Plummer), a thousand-year-old seer and magician who was granted immortality by the devil (Tom Waits) in exchange for handing over any female child he might have when she turned 16; Veronica (Lily Cole), his soon-to-be-sixteen-year-old daughter, who is unaware of the pact and who simply yearns for the day when she will be able to break free of the group and live a ""normal"" life; Anton (Andrew Garfield), a young assistant, who has feelings of his own for Veronica; Percy, a wisecracking dwarf (Verne Troyer) who provides the cutting voice of reason for the rest of the performers; and a mysterious, nameless man (the Ledger character) the troupe rescues from a suicide attempt, a man without memory or identity who joins their merry band and who, with his barker-like charisma, helps to finally generate some public interest in the act.  The flights of fancy come in the scenes involving a magic mirror the troupe uses as a part of its routine, a mirror that serves as a portal into the very imagination of Dr. Parnassus for anyone daring enough to step into it.

The beauty of ""The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus"" is that it rarely allows the fantasy elements to supersede the drama.  The script keeps its eyes firmly focused on the characters - their hopes and dreams, and the lives they're leading.  But there are deep, dark secrets to be uncovered and dealt with before the truth about the characters - especially Tony - can be fully revealed.

Yet, it is when we go behind the mirror that we get to see Gilliam`s own fertile imagination in its fullest flower.  Here he has created an entire world out of distorted perspectives, painterly backdrops and the melding of CGI with human characters - and done so in a way that only Gilliam (and, perhaps, Tim Burton) can do it.

Through the use of wardrobe and makeup, not only does Gilliam do a seamless job melding the three actors into the Ledger character, but, with the script, he manages to actually work Ledger's premature death and the fact that the part is played by several different people into the story itself.

Ledger's work here, so full of energy, whimsy and understated pathos, truly reminds us of what a great talent we lost when he died so suddenly and so early - and makes us lament the great performances that we will never get to see in the future.  But all the acting in the film is topnotch, with Plummer, in particular, distinguishing himself as the world weary Parnassus forced to live an eternity of regret as a result of a rash action taken earlier in his life.

This film is a fitting valedictory for an actor who took great delight in pushing the envelope when it came to choosing the role that would most help him to grow as an actor.  He will be sorely missed.",1279670400,,3775,4.6797583081570995

I have seen all of this movies and the television shows that he played in and can proudly say that I am a truly devoted fan.

This movie, although depressing, was created very well.
I loved the special effects and the choice of actors.

What I didn't like (and what obviously could not be helped) was how Heath Ledger was the major character through the first half of the movie than all of a sudden he was no longer there. Poof!

Instead they covered his ""disappearance"" with Colin Farrell which was noticed... Though I know it wasn't suppose to be noticeable; it was. Very. Noticeable.

I did notice that after the death of Ledger, the story line drastically changed as well.
What I thought was forming into a love story or whereabout turned into a sadistic mind mending weird... thing with no plot.
Don't change the movie just because you lost an actor.

If Ledger had lived to finish this movie, it would have been spectacular and would have won many many awards.

Other than those unfortunate points, the movie was well made, well written, and well casted.
I liked it.
But not as much as I thought I would, mind you.

Rest in peace Heath.

3637872,4,B001HN69B8,"HEATH LEDGER's sudden demise during filming of THE IMAGINARIUM OF DR. PARNASSUS made it necessary to change the script so that his unfinished scenes could be played by other actors within the realm of the crazy world of the Imaginarium. This clever adjustment to the script provides three other actors with fill-in roles for Ledger: JOHNNY DEPP, JUDE LAW and COLIN FARRELL.

Heath is a complete delight in his role as the mysterious stranger who comes upon the traveling sideshow and has the power to change everything.

3637876,1,B001HN69B8,"I wanted to like this.

I've been a fan of Gilliam's for years. I love this work on Python, and Twelve Monkeys is one of my favorite films. I even loved Baron Muchausen. So I was prepared for weird. Absurd. Outlandish.

I've also been an avid fan and ardent mourner of Heath Ledger. I knew the challenges presented to the director trying to film around scenes that were already shot and could never be added to. The death of Ledger left an absence in the screen that would be hard to correct.

What I was not prepared for was a film so disjointed, so incoherent, it scarcely had a plot.

The CGI was so terrible - particularly in the scene where Valentina is running through broken glass. I've seen better graphics in a SyFy movie.

And the Devil? I don't even know wha to make of him. I'm not sure what happened in the end, and I'm sure I was supposed to be pulling for Anton, but I could care less.

That's the problem too. There was no character development whatsoever. I never cared about any of them. Not even Heath Ledger or Christopher Plummer, who I have a strong affinity for no matter what they do. To make me disinterested in the final performance of Heath, in the final images I'll ever see of him on screen, is quite a feat indeed, yet Gilliam managed to accomplish that.

On top of that, the character of Tony written for Heath does not seem to be the same character written for Colin Farrell. This is not discredit Colin Farrell. I feel like he did a good job with what he had, the way most of the actors seemed to do - they just had nothing to work with. Heath's version of Tony seemed to be a bit... iffy. He was clearly a con man, but he also seemed to have some redeeming qualities. Colin's character seemed random and distracted and vaguely maniacal. He also apparently sold starving kids to have their organs harvested.

Some of the film did have beautiful costume direction, and the sets - when they were sets and not cartoonishy CGI - were lovely. In a few abstracted moments, the genius behind Gilliam did show through - but most of that is already shown in previews. Watch a trailer and you'll see the best the film has to offer.

Johnny Depp and Jude Law - who are normally captivating - gave forgettable and unnecessary performances. They truly did not add anything to the film nor did they need to be in it. However, I applaud them for giving their salary to Matilda Ledger.

I ordered the film On Demand tonight, and I planned on buying it anyway, because even if I didn't like it, I felt like I ought to own the last film Heath Ledger was in it. I will not be buying this film.

In fact, I felt like its a disservice to his memory. It's unfair to put his name on this piece of garbage and have this be the last thing people remember him for.",1276300800,12,2771,4.299424184261037

3637911,3,B001HN69B8,"When you name a review ""baffling"" and it's by Terry Gilliam, most people who are familiar with his movies, would claim that as a pre requisite.
I say it in two ways, first and foremost how you could get Christopher Plummer, Heath Ledger, Johnny Depp, Jude Law AND Colin Farrell in the same movie and be moved to indifference for the first hour of this movie.
Secondly, it's baffling because it's really quite weird. That's not a complaint as such, as I said in the introduction, one can hardly call Terry Gilliam mainstream.
Indeed, in todays fast buck mega pictures out to ream cash from the masses, it's refreshing to still see a filmmaker, who has the money (and the courage) to interpret on screen, what most of us confine to our nighttime dreams.
Oversimplifying the film would be to say that the Devil (played with more than a dollop of dark charm by Tom Waits) as ""Mr Nick"" made a deal, or bet in an undisclosed distant past, with monk Christopher Plummer who gained immortality in the wager.
Now years later, he runs a tin pan side show, where people can visit their ""dreams"" by stepping through his mirror (while he controls it with a trance) and he can help them shape their own world, and save their soul. Mr Nick in the meantime, usually appears in their dream world with a more appealing alternative (but worse conclusion) and the too and fro for souls, as you get the impression, has been battled out between them.
Plummer, now an aged drunk has a soon to be 16 year old daughter Valentina (played with a pale but almost sexy fragility by Lily Cole) and a zealous apprentice Anton, again played amiably by another newcomer Andrew Garfield, and long standing advisor Vern Troyer (Austin Powers).
We learn that in one of the two protagonists ""deals"" at some point, Parnassus (Plummer) fell in love, and had a child, which he must hand over to Mr Nick on her rapidly approaching 16th birthday, unless he can win a new ""bet"".
Enter Heath Ledger, as an amnesiac apparent suicide victim, saved by our wandering troupe, who signs on to help Parnassus and company, reach the public, win the bet, and woo the daughter, much to the chagrin of Anton who has yet to announce his undying love to Valentina.
Sounds interesting? Yes it does, and I had high hopes, not only to see Legder in his last performance, but I had also been more than impressed by the glitzy high profile trailer.
But it's dull, I'm sorry but trudges through the first hour and in attempting to conjure up many visions of Parnassuses World, ends up a mess.
There isn't any real tension even when the story gets going, Depp, Law, and Farrell are nothing more than wasted cameos, and even the twist at the end, isn't really gripping. By two hours in, I had lost any real compassion for any of the characters.

I have long been a fan of Terry Gilliam, I thoroughly enjoyed the Brothers Grimm, and Brazil, but frankly this is not in that league.
If you like bizarre out there movies, give it a go by all means.
I didn't want to be mean, but 3 stars was as generous as I could be.",1275350400,17,3048,4.491891891891892
3637912,5,B001HN69B8,"After waiting for it to come out on DVD, I just saw TIODP last night.  Here are a couple of observations and insights that may be helpful.

(i) Visuals
I unfortunately watched this movie on a non-Blue Ray DVD player on a 26 inch T.V.  Within minutes, I realized that I had really robbed myself not seeing this at the theater.  The visuals were absolutely jaw-dropping and literally breath-taking; some of the richest, most imaginative imagery I have ever seen on film.  I often have concerns that Hollywood technology has outpaced Hollywood creativity with the endless over-produced streams of Iron Man 2's and Prince of Persias being the fruit of this folly.  This movie has restored my faith that there is new and creative stories to be told and interesting and important ideas to be imagined.

Terry Gilliam has always been in the forefront of visual style (Brazil, Time Bandits, 12 Monkeys), but has never really had the tools that are brought to bear in this outing.  When I saw the effects-saturated previews, I was a little concerned that Gilliam may be starting down the trail blazed by Tim Burton, who long ago abandoned any artistic or storytelling pretense, replacing them with what pretty much amounts to a technology showcase (anyone see Alice in Wonderland?).  So I was really worried about what would be lost in translating Gilliam's ideas onto a digital palette.  I was pleasantly surprised that Gilliam has not gone down this road at all; his strange and interesting effects complement the mood and style of the movie, without consuming or overrunning them. Yes, there was visual panache and pizzazz, but the rest of the movie was not an excuse to get it on the screen.

As for the visuals themselves, they were absolute masterpieces.  I am not sure if anyone could watch the imagination sequences and not think of Salvatore Dali or other surrealists; it really reminded me of Destino, Dali's aborted collaboration with Walt Disney (Yes, really.  Look it up.)  Yet beyond their sheer artistry, these sequences have a way of mixing the surrealist dreariness with satire and whimsy, signifying to me that no one was taking themselves too seriously.

(ii) Acting
The acting for most of the characters was good, but nothing to write home about.  Heath Ledger's performance was ok, but far inferior to his masterful (and Oscar winning) turn as the Joker last year; he is just not as flamboyant and slick as the role demanded.  Christopher Plummer was fine - really he didn't venture far beyond doing ""hysterical old coot"" for most of the movie.  Colin Ferrell, Jude Law, and Lilly Cole were so-so, but really kind of mediocre talents to begin with.  It was refreshing to see that Verne Troyer has evolved beyond Mini-Me, but he is still really used more as a set-piece than an independent character in this one.

However, I should point out two notable exceptions to the general rule.  First, Tom Waits is just absolutely awesome as resident Satan figure, Mr. Nick.  His silky voice and crystal cool demeanor was just entrancing; every time he came on the screen was a singular pleasure - true, it was a creepy, skin-crawling, punch to the gut, check-if-your-soul-is-still-there kind of pleasure, but still.  (As a short sidenote, anyone who doesn't know Waits' music needs to stop reading this review and go order Rain Dogs right now... We'll wait).  Second, Johnny Depp's short turn as Mr. Ledger's Imaginarium's alter-ego is a precision mix of carnival barker and slippery gigolo; I was sorry that there was so little of him in the movie.

(iii) Story
Ok, if there is one particular that I could get caught up on not being the best, it would probably be the story.  It seems that they started with a really neat idea - Doctor Parnasus can facilitate one stepping into his imagination.  He has a second-rate traveling show pedaling the experience to a disinterested and cynical populous.  On the side, he has made a deal with the devil, wagering his only child against a bet to be the first to claim five souls through his Imaginarium against Mr. Nick's competing visions.  That is the seed of a really neat idea, but the actual mechanics of the thing really don't live up to the promise.  There is a lot of dialogue filler and an extraneous character or two that really didn't push things forward and meandered into subplots which really didn't add to the story much.  Also, part of the mystery that Gilliam weaves requires not showing all the cards in his hand at once (or at all for that matter).  This makes the plot interesting and adds to the atmosphere, but also makes the story kind of incomprehensible at some points.  You have to fill in a lot of narrative gaps and, as a result, viewers will not walk away with the same understanding of the story or even its resolution.  I was a little put off by this, but then again if I hated narrative or moral ambiguity, Tom Clancy also has a number of selections available.

Final note (and SPOILER ALERT), doesn't being hanged generally kill one by cutting off blood to one's carotid artery, not by suffocation, making a metal tube down your trachea really kind of irrelevant?  Is it just me?

(iv) Conclusion
Five Stars and no regrets.
Unlike some of the other reviewers, I will not pat myself on the back for having discovered some kind of high art, unappreciated by the bourgeoisies masses.  It is quirky and different and I think you have to have an appreciation of movies beyond the mega-plex to really get into it (I mean, er... the other mega-plexes which didn't show this movie), but wouldn't consider it art house cinema.  I enjoyed it a lot and thought that the visual style alone commands a strong recommendation.",1275350400,2,5690,4.761467889908257
3637913,1,B001HN69B8,"Well, I thought I couldn't go wrong with this movie. I saw Heath Ledger's amazing performance in ""The Dark Knight"", and I adore Johnny Depp and jump at the chance to see any movie he's in. But this movie was a complete let-down. The cover looks amazing. It has some big names in it. It looks like an awesome movie for fantasy-lovers. A man who made a deal with the Devil for immortality at the price of giving up his daughter on her 16th birthday. Sounds promising, but that's not the case at all. The plot is sloppy. The movie hardly makes sense. It's just bad. I really don't even know what more to say about it. Perhaps it's such a poor movie because of Ledger's untimely passing. I'm guessing he didn't get to really think it through (and of course he didn't get to complete it, hence Johnny Depp, Colin Farrell, and Jude Law stepping in to complete his role). I do believe these usually good actors agreed to complete the movie in honor of their friend, which is lovely. They did not care that the script is terrible. I almost feel that perhaps this is the type of story that MIGHT work in a novel, but just does not translate well at all into film.
That being said, R.I.P. Heath Ledger, and thank you Depp, Farrell, and Law for at least trying to save a sorry film.
I wouldn't recommend spending your money on this film. If you are really curious, wait until it comes on TV or something.",1275350400,15,1393,4.340996168582375

Great visuals & special effects, the kind that make it worth rewatching just to catch more of the details.  I enjoyed it enough... and don't regret buying the DVD, although it's less than a 5-star in my collection as well.  Interestingly successful at adapting the storyline with other headline actors to accommodate finishing of the film after the untimely death of Heath Ledger.  As a fan of Johnny Depp, however, I am probably partial in saying I probably would've enjoyed it much more if JD had played the main character from start to finish.  Christopher Plummer brings nobility to the cast & Lily Cole is very easy on the eyes.  One missed opportunity - The bonus features didn't do much to enhance appreciation of the film as they do in some other DVD sets.  All in all, a valiant rescue of a film that may not have ever been released.  All members of the cast did a good job & complemented each other nicely.",1275350400,,1110,4.51
3637915,5,B001HN69B8,"Dr. Parnassus had made a deal with the devil.  Many deals actually.  He's spent a lifetime making them as it's the devil's favorite pastime, making bets with Dr. Parnassus.  The Doctor's got plenty of time to make bets / deals with the devil given that one of them included the good doctor becoming immortal.  But of course when you play such games, eventually you'll get burned.  And that is what this movie is about.

Dr. Parnassus and his traveling side show (which consists of the doctor, Valentina - the doctor's daughter, Anton - the young man who loves Valentina, and Percy - the doctor's sidekick) is being followed by Mr. Nick (the devil) as time is just about up on one very particular debt.  Oh, and they find a man hanging by a noose from a bridge, nearly dead, unable to remember a thing.  Is he connected to Mr. Nick?  Will the doctor bother telling his daughter how she plays into this deal?  Can the doctor win?  Does the devil even want to win or does he actually enjoy losing to the doctor? How does the doctor's mirror play into all of this?  Does Tony (the hanging man) really forget who he is or is he playing them all for fools?  They have a lot to deal with and a short time to face it all.

It's a fun fantasy.  Visually stunning.  Yes Heath Ledger died during the filming of this movie.  It's a tragedy we're all aware of.  I went into this movie knowing of that, but not knowing just how much or little of his role he'd finished, only knowing that other actors stepped up to fill the void.  Obviously we'd all prefer that he'd been around to finish this and many more films, but, the way they completed the role actually worked out rather well and he's actually in more of the film than I was expecting.  Very well done.

I'm giving this one the benefit of the doubt at 5 stars as I did love it.  It's probably more the 4 3/4 stars as the story could have been tightened up just a wee bit here and there.  But compared to a lot of what is out there nowadays it's so much more deserving of the 5.  In fact in this day and age where it feels like virtually every other movie centers around an animated talking dog, I'm really surprised that this wasn't promoted more than it was.",1275264000,2,2203,4.278450363196126

I only watched it once, because the rental I had was due back, but I will correct that soon. Being Heath Ledger's last effort captured on film was certainly enough to draw me, and he's quite fine. Gilliam made a smart choice to have Ledger's ""alter-ego"" played by the celebrated trio of Depp, Farrell and Law. It's all commendable, and generally successful. I enjoyed Tom Waits as Mr. Nick; his rare film appearances have always entertained me, especially in Altman's ""Short Cuts"". Also admirable is Lily Cole, quite charming and believable. There's no question that this film, as well as most of Mr. Gilliam's efforts, requires repeated viewings. There's also little mention of Christopher Plummer's fine performance; as in ""12 Monkeys"", no one seems to remember that Bruce Willis was the main  character.  Also, no question that this film is worth a look for stunning sets and visuals, original fun, and the last effort of the very fine Heath Ledger.",1275177600,,1155,5.041884816753926

The man knows how to bring the best out of his actors, even in the most bizarre situations.  Whether they're hanging from a bridge in the cold London weather, or prancing around an imaginary, larger-than-life video game, his actors are believable.  Despite the trials that seem to follow Gilliam on his endeavors, Parnassus pulled through all the trouble and grief involved in making the film.  It was a bittersweet experience for me as I watched Heath Ledger on the big screen for the last time.  His Tony is extremely likable, despite his shadowed past.  The Gilliam-Ledger team was once again remarkable, as they were in The Brothers Grimm.  They were a natural pairing and pure talent at its best.  All the actors are delightful to watch, especially veteran actor Christopher Plummer in the title role.  Gilliam seamlessly wove Depp, Law, and Farrell into the role of Tony to fill Heath's shoes in the fantasy scenes when Tony goes through the mirror.  Hats off to the three of them.  The DVD itself is a wonderful addition to the Gilliam library, with all its extras and remarkable picture.  Words cannot describe the extra footage of Heath Ledger mugging for the camera in costumes and playing around with the cast on the Imaginarium stage.  That alone is worth the price and more.  Gilliam captured him as only Gilliam can do.  So if you want to escape, even for a short time, treat yourself to The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus, and marvel in the world of Terry Gilliam's imagination.",1274918400,2,1656,4.8021201413427566

Old Nick show up an silences the various singers by making their mouths disappear. Dr Parnassus goes on, unperturbed, imagining the world into existence. (How do you know it isn't?)

The concepts in this movie are nothing less than brilliant, especially in the light of so much Hollywood mindless trash. It stands beside Terry Gilliam's other masterpieces, ""Brazil"", ""The 12 Monkeys"", ""Time Bandits""  and of course all of his work with Monty Python's Flying Circus

Every time the weasely Heath Ledger goes into the mirror, into Dr Parnassus mind, he changes. He also changes from Johnny Depp to Colin Farrell to Jude Law, like peeling an onion.  Old Nick is well played by Tom Waits presenting sensual, carnal, greedy or selfish temptations to people in a contest with Dr Parnassus to see who can the most capture souls. There is the door on the left and the door on the right for them to choose...The continued existence of the world is dependent on who wins the wager. Valentina (Lily Cole) is beautiful, sexy. Verne Troyer (Mini-Me) has some thought provoking commentaries to Dr Parnassus.  If one is thoughtful, or has a soul, they will find the metaphysics of this movie very interesting.

Every time I see it, I love it more and more.

Something similar has happened with ""The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus"". Gilliam's best films are dense and challenging, and each viewing reveals more layers. Anyone wanting instant gratification can instead busy themselves with a Roland Emmerich or Michael Bay movie: quickie ""explosion"" flicks are OK for temporary amusement, but they don't sustain the soul.

And that's what this film is really all about. Are you game enough to climb Mount Parnassus? If so, you'll be rewarded handsomely, though it requires patience and an openness to the wonders of the imagination.

If, on the other hand, you want an easily digestible FX extravaganza, look elsewhere.

This is an intelligent, adult fantasy film brimming with ideas that don't always occupy the foreground. Good vs. evil, simple joy vs. excess and consumerism, the magic in the mundane: these are all themes running through ""Parnassus"", yet it's also about religious dogma and the role of metaphor in giving life meaning. Give it a go with these things in mind and you won't regret the experience.

Incidentally, ""The Dark Knight"" is probably a better epitaph for Heath Ledger, if only because he's front-and-centre there.

However as much as i want to say it was a great movie, it was not. Heath Ledger did a great job, but Johny Depp, Colin Farwell, and Jude Law only appear in the movie each for like 5-15 minutes. It was really a let down as at least i thought they were going to all have seperate rolls but, unless you have seen the movie you understand, they do not. The plot was very dull, but the visuals (when they finally came back after the movie would dull down for like 45 minutes) were pretty nice.

Others will rave how 'weird' it is (not realizing that weird does not equal random/pointless), and therefore how enlightened they are for appreciating an 'art film'.  How amazing the effects are.  I'll admit I was intrigued from the trailer and after hearing of Tom Waits' character.  I am just glad I waited to rent it, instead.  This was seriously, some of the most painful movie viewing I've sat through in some time.  There's movies that are so bad they are good, those categorized as cult, weird, out there, bizarro, blah blah blah... this does not fall into any of those arenas.  Aside from Waits' intermittant appearances as the devil, which were comical and fresh, the rest just stink stank stunk.  It's a classic case of less ideas, more money (aka Hollywood); and to justify weak storytelling, we'll just chuck on more CGI, more big name actors/actresses, and more plot openings, the further down the drain the story sinks.  A few scenes were well designed, and give credit to the creative work behind the carriage that unfolds into the ""Imaginarium"".  However, the fun stops there.  In fact, by the time one character runs up with a broken arm (we're closing in on the 2-hour mark by now), I was begging out loud, ""oh god not another pointless side story, please don't squeeze in a 15 minute hospital scene, PLEASE NO!!!""... thankfully, I was spared of that much.  I've seen high school plays half as long with more talent and better storytelling.  Carnival sideshows that delivered more on the barker's promise to entertain and mystify.  This was a 2-hour empty trip to nowhere with lots of pretty colors.  To quote the movie itself, ""I think I'd like my money back!""...",1273881600,22,1816,4.794212218649518

I will not give a blow by blow of the story but I found the concept of people from a different time of the world contrasting with today's lifestyle. Not necessarily, the main theme but a major is that of going through the mirror. It has been used from Alice, ""Through the looking Glass"" and even the contemporary movie ""MirrorMask"". I wonder if it has a deeper physiological meaning that I missed.

We also get to kibitz as Doctor Parnassus (Christopher Plummer) banters with Mr. Nick (Tom Waits) and we all know how that classily turns out. The only time anyone comes out ahead in negotiations was in the film ""The Devil and Daniel Webster"". Will Parnassus beat the devil?

3638002,5,B001HN69B8,"Terry Gilliam remains one of the more idiosyncratic and creative writer/director/producer phenomenons in the business.  His ability as an illustrator and as a satirist date back to his college years at Occidental College in Los Angeles where he daily startled students and faulty alike with his broad but biting and well groomed antics.  For this viewer THE IMAGINARIUM OF DOCTOR PARNASSUS is one of his strongest forays in the field that can only be described as the Gilliam Genre. He combines a superb cast of characters portrayed by some of the finest actors in the field with his gift for creating visual effects that step beyond mere illustration but stay within the realm of painterly artistry instead of depending on CGI.  And despite the zany story line that is typical of Gilliam's output, he also has some strong philosophical points to make.  Comedy and fantasy combine to make drama in the line of Shakespearean creators.

The story, written by Gilliam with and assist from Charles McKeown,  is a mixture of fairy tale an the Faust legend all played out in the present day world - with very special exit points through mirrors into the world of pure imagination.  Christopher Plummer gives great dignity to the immortal Doctor Parnassus who is the Faust of the tale - selling his beloved daughter Valentina (a wonderful Lily Cole) to one Mr Nick (the Devil) played subtly by Tom Waits.  Parnassus runs a bizarre sideshow with his daughter Valentina, his lead man Anton (Andrew Garfield) and the 2'8"" Percy (Verne Troyer).  Into their lives drops (from a hanging under the bridge! rescue) the odd Tony (Heath Ledger, proving in his last role that he was truly a fine actor).  Tony helps Parnassus alter his pact with Mr Nick in a series of strange events and in the course of these events the character of Tony is developed as three others - Colin Farrell, Jude Law, and Johnny Depp.  The rest of the tale is left up to the audience to squeeze in the moments of high comedy and advanced, surrealistic creativity that Gilliam offers this project.  'All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players: They have their exits and their entrances...'.  It is a pleasure to give into fantasy with Gilliam's films, and this one is a jewel!  Grady Harp, May 10",1273276800,2,2278,4.763358778625954

3638004,4,B001HN69B8,"I find I must begin this review by saying I am NOT a Gilliam fan, nor am I quite fond of Jude Law or Collin Farrell.

The late Heath Ledger is, and has always been, a phenomenal actor and a true force to be reckoned with, even posthumously as we discovered with his win for The Joker.  You can expect nothing less than a superb, realistic performance from the late actor as Tony.  The character is highly believable, charming, and layered.  You do not begin to see the ""true"" nature of Tony until you step inside the mirror of Doctor Parnassus into the Imaginarium.

While some have mentioned that the wager with Mr. Nick is never clearly explained, I will make note that one must look beyond the surface of the characters and spoken word.  There are flashback sequences and subtle, intentional, script clues that give away a great deal of the story that may not be outwardly expressed.  It is not a film you can sit back and idly watch; it does require an active viewing for the story to truly click.

As for the performances of the three actors stepping in to fill the shoes of Tony, each portrayed their respectable layer of the character quite superbly.  Johnny Depp is the most like Heath Ledger's portrayal of Tony, so much so, in fact, that it takes one a moment or two to truly grasp that the character has changed.  Jude Law, while not as concise when it comes to the particular vocal characteristics prescribed to the character, does a marvelous job.  As does Colin Farrell, even though both actors are nowhere near as good at what I like to call `chameleon acting.'  Both do portray the character well and tell the story beautifully.

If you are not a fan of the strange and often macabre styled films and stories, you will take little pleasure in the content of the movie itself, but the stunning visuals and quirky style of the film should keep your interest throughout the film.

Featuring the final performance of Heath Ledger before his untimely death, as well as ""tribute"" performances from Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell; The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is a visually stunning feast that sadly gets too bogged down in itself.  Christopher Plummer stars as the immortal title character, whose pact with Mr. Nick the Devil (Tom Waits) is culminating with Nick's taking of Doctor Parnassus' teen daughter (the gorgeous Lily Cole).  However, what no one seemed to count on is the appearance of the mysterious and charasmatic Tony (Ledger), claiming to have amnesia and quickly becoming the star of Parnassus' magical Imaginarium.  There are surprises abound with equal amounts of confusion as well, but what really makes The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus worthwhile are the performances of its cast, particularly Plummer and Waits.  Heath Ledger is deceptively charming as well in the role that he never got to finish, making it all the more disheartening that he was taken from us way too soon.  The guest performances from Depp, Law, and Farrell however are worthy enough to admire though, and Gilliam's keen imagination triumphs despite the film's shortcomings.  All in all, The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus is one of the better works of late from Terry Gilliam, and is worth seeing just for the fact that this is Heath Ledger's last hurrah.",1272844800,,1473,5.189873417721519
3638008,4,B001HN69B8,"No one has a visual sense quite like Terry Gilliam; that's what made Python so unique looking and why I'll watch anything he makes. But as time goes by he is becoming more and more obsessed with the look and less concerned with making movies that always entertain and never lag, and neglects getting great readings from his actors. His last, Brothers Grimm, was the perfect example, and IODP is at least better than that one.

Ledger is also much finer in this than he was in BG, but still not wonderful, all told. He's not really that interesting an actor here, expecially when playing against a true master like Plummer, who steals the show easily. Even Ledger's stand-ins after his death are more fascinating to watch, Farrell above all. He's got what I'd call real star-quality; it's hard to stop watching him even when he's not speaking. Whereas Heath here is just kind of there, and never makes me feel that happy sense one gets of watching a master at work, unlike his turn as the Joker.

Likewise Gilliam at the helm. He is a master, no question. Holy Grail, Time Bandits, Brazil and Twelve Monkeys are all classic films, but sadly his last two decades have been rather fallow in terms of masterpieces. On the other hand, he did make the messy Munchhausen early on, and most of his latest films have its mix of splendid visual and murky storyline. Gilliam does make extremely attractive films, in any case, and it's hard to beat him for pure eye candy. The colors and sets here are lush and crisp, and his mix of the stale, modern look of London up against the fun fantasy sheen of the circusy Parnassus troop works well.

Yet the script just doesn't measure up, and it all takes a little too long. The fantasy sequences are wonderful, and most of the acting is solid, but in the end I didn't have that satisfied glow one gets after watching a truly great movie. I did however get a few smiles, had my imagination tweaked, and enjoyed plenty of wow visual moments, so it's pretty much what one expects from Gilliam these days.

And let's not sell Terry short. He has very much his own style and sense of filmmaking, and it's a pleasure to watch his work even when it gets a little too Byzantine for its own good. If you've ever liked his work, you'll also enjoy this, and as fantasy films go, it's worth your time, with Plummer adding the extra edge that he's gifted so many films with.",1272844800,,2394,4.48394495412844

The storyline was a bit disjointed, and never congealed for me. I fully admit that I am not a huge fan of Terry Gilliam's past works, and frankly, listening to him on the Special Edition features and the film commentary are, for me, like watching paint dry. I usually like the unexpected, and the weird in Cinema; in fact I gravitate towards the art house style of Cinema. This film, however, suffers from the ultimate criticism: it was dull and boring.

I do think one has to let the film live in them a bit before they rush to condem something as complex and unconventional as Dr. Parnassas.
Personally, I loved this movie.  It swept me away into places I've only gone in my dreams.  It kept me guessing and asking questions.  It resonated with me days and even weeks after.  To honestly critique this movie one has to fully recognize what Gilliam had to do to keep this project alive.  He found a way to salvage a labor of love (and not just his work but Heath Ledger's too - because once can see clearly from watching this movie that Heath relished playing his twisted character in same manner as he did the joker.
Some people say that Dark Knight should have been his last film.  I personally liked this film more and I think this is further proof of Ledger's talent having fully blossemed in his later years.  Bravo to Heath and Terry.  They really made a great team!

One other thing I loved about this movie, is that when the other actors (Depp, Law, Ferrell) come into the film to take over for Ledger, they do so with the upmost respect to the performance and specific character work that Ledger had already provided.  And though I don't care for Law or Farrell as actors (celebrities), it should be mentioned that they were perfectly cast in this film as two somewhat unlikable characters - so for me it all worked out fine.  I have some questions in regards to the symbolism and plot...but hey, I give the benefit of the doubt to Gilliam, since, after all, hasn't he earned it?

3638064,4,B001HN69B8,"Some films transport you to other worlds.  Some films transport you to other worlds, but only keep you there momentarily.  Such, alas, is the fate of THE IMAGINARIUM OF DOCTOR PARNASSUS.  While it certainly has moments of unadulterated grandeur, certain scenes and moments just don't click, and the end result is a film not nearly as memorable as it should be.

But wait, you say.  Isn't this a 4-Star review?  Why yes it is.  That is because, despite its flaws, this film is still worth your time.  First, it stars Christopher Plummer, one of the finest--and sadly, most overlooked--actors out there.  Second, it features Tom Waits in the role he was meant to play (namely, himself, albeit a little more Satanic--but not much).  Third, it is Heath Ledger's last performance, a farewell from a fine and sorely-missed actor.  And fourth...well, the film is just a lot of fun.

Centuries ago, Dr. Parnassus made a bet with the devil (who, for some reason, likes to go by ""Mr. Nick"").  Parnassus won.  But since that day, he and Mr. Nick have been stuck in a strangely symbiotic relationship; as Tom Waits sneers at one point, ""I love a betting man!""  And now there is a new bet: can Parnassus save the immortal soul of his daughter before the clock strikes on her sixteenth birthday?

PARNASSUS is filled with fine performances.  Ledger, Waits, and Plummer carry the show; the scenes between Plummer and Waits in particular are engrossing (although, I admit to being a sucker for Faustian tragedies).  Supporting them are Lily Cole and Andrew Garfield, both turning in fine performances.  Due to Ledger's untimely death, his role was shot so that Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell played him in certain scenes (and yes, it actually works out to make something resembling sense).  Throw in a cameo from Peter Stormare, and Verne Troyer in a role that actually makes you forget it's Verne Troyer, and you've got a film chock-full of outstanding actors.  Combine that with some of the breath-taking imagery (the first time I've actually wished I could watch something in 3D), and you've got a film that is well-worth watching.

Yet, it's not for everyone, which is a caveat that unfortunately has to appear on a lot of films these days (yet never the films that actually deserve it).  The script lags in spots; and some things just don't seem to make sense, even in a world where things aren't supposed to make sense.  The ambiguity of the film will also be a bit off-putting; suffice it to say, if you aren't into magical realism, or Gilliam's work, you should probably steer clear.

The plot is essentially a fairy tale of a man who made a bet with the devil He and his traveling troupe possess a mirror into a bizarre world in which people are forced to make a choice between good and evil.

Visually, the film is stunning. It contrasts the drab reality with the vivid colors of the mirror world. The movie also does keep you engaged because it is so different it's tough to predict what will happen.

The plot has obvious religious and philosophical overtones which at times are interesting. However, sometimes the plot becomes so odd and convoluted that it's tough to follow. Viewers are just asked to accept crazy notions such as a hidden mirror world and drastic personality changes. Unfortunately, the first half of the film starts off clear enough, but it seems like it just twists itself into knots by the end. I still don't quite get why certain characters did certain things at the end (which I won't discuss for fear of revealing spoils).

The acting overall was good, not great. Chris Plummer and Lily Cole were particularly good. Sometimes it seemed a bit forced though. I particularly didn't like the actor who played Satan (Tom Waits), who comes across as a bored salesman.

First, we have to remember that Terry Gilliam, along with Monty Python, has always made fun of the Catholic faith (Life of Brian, Monty Python and the Holy Grail), so it is not strange that he comes back to that theme again.

Of course, the devil is in the picture, but so is God (Dr. Parnassus). Tony is the ""corporate"" Jesus that ""changes the business"" from a simple carnival attraction to a bigger enterprise (his Foundation) that goes after rich ladies. Valentina's character portrays humankind, tempted by the Devil and Jesus at the same time.

All the metaphors are there in plain sight (even the crucifixion, with Tony's hanging and self induced resurrection). But Gilliam leaves room for an honest Jesus: Anton (I think it is not casual that Tony and Anton names are variations of Anthony).

SPOILER ALERT: The fact that Valentina finally choses Anton is Gilliam's total rejection of what Catholic Church has become. (The movie even has Colin Farrell's Tony hitting a kid for telling the truth!).

Finally, Gilliam has God becoming a puppeteer, in another not so hidden metaphor.

People are supposed to enter their own imaginations trough the mind of the doctor to which you can access trough a mirror... so.... People enter their imaginations trough the mind of the doctor trough a mirror.... Ooooookeeeey.
I, know, I know its Gilliam... but... c'mon!!!
It would be possible to let the all this ""farfetchedness"" go but the ""imaginary"" realms look just like screen savers and wall papers made by... I don't know, wallpaper and screen savers designers?
They are nice, but hey are just generic and they seemed to be made with generic software by generic people... And talking about people... People is supposed to change when they enter the imaginary realms, but apparently just certain people: a drunk at the beginning of the movie and the character played by Heath Ledger, Jhony Dep, Jude Law and Colin Farrel.
And who is supposed to be this character?
He is the hanged man, a troubled man who finds himself traveling with the old dude his daughter, midget and aid. Obviously the daughter will have a thing for him, the aid will be jealous of him (for he is in love with the daughter) and the midget will be suspicious of him (because apparently that is what midgets do).
The acting is... mediocre... Effects are awful... and it just doesn't have that endearing quality that most of Gilliam's film have.  I couldn't identify with any of the characters in the screen, I didn't care about them and quite frankly, I was  happy to see them go when the movie ended.",1271808000,6,2566,4.586056644880174

3638120,4,B001HN69B8,"Dr. Parnassus is a film that could only have come from the fecund mind of Terry Gilliam. He has earned a reputation for taking creative risks instead of making safe, mundane films. As a former Monty Python member, we can expect no less. Whether you like him or not, you must give him credit for his indomitable creative spirit and unwillingness to compromise his artistic vision, with mixed results. After giving us masterpieces like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brazil/dp/B000G8NXZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brazil</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adventures-of-Baron-Munchausen/dp/B000T44ONG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adventures of Baron Munchausen</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/12-Monkeys/dp/B0026FCNK2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">12 Monkeys</a>, he baffled us with the disastrous and hated&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brothers-Grimm/dp/B000H7J9S0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brothers Grimm</a>. As a result of his unyielding independence, his productions are often fraught with setbacks and colorful stories of their own. This one is no different, owing to the untimely passing of Heath Ledger, who plays Tony, one of the main characters in the film.

His films are not for everyone and as such, he can be a bit of an acquired taste. I must admit I hated 12 Monkeys when I first saw it, but not so with Dr. Parnassus. I thoroughly enjoyed the wacky ride Gilliam took me on into the vastness of his bizarre imagination, partly because of the locale. Set in modern-day London, the story is about the misadventures of a traveling theatre troupe led by the title character, Dr. Parnassus (Christopher Plummer), a 1,000 year old ex-Eastern mystic. Everything about the stagecoach and its inhabitants has a wonderfully anachronistic look to it, like they doesn't belong in this world.

Having made a deal with the devil, Dr. Parnassus traded immortality for something very dear to him, and now plays one game after another for souls, trying to outwit the devil and cancel his debt. Tom Waits is wonderfully devious, and dare I say it-- lovably diabolical as Parnassus's adversary, the pencil-moustached and bowler-topped Mr. Nick. If you don't like Verne Troyer, you won't like him here either as the Dr.'s trusty sidekick Percy. Lily Cole, who plays Dr. Parnassus's teenage daughter, is very lovely and easy on the eyes. I didn't mind her running around at the end in a little red dress at all! As for the whistle Tony uses to get out of predicaments, I've never seen this trick before! Very clever. I won't spoil the surprise. You'll have to see it for yourself.

Gilliam's distinct visual style is abundantly in evidence here, with wildly imaginative sets and quirky characters. His worlds often look lived-in, chaotic (12 Monkeys, Brazil), and filled with junk. Johnny Depp described Dr. Parnassus as having a ""crazed, dilapidated majesty"" and that's the perfect way to sum up the look of this film. A lot of CG is used throughout to give the dream world the fantastical and exaggerated look of a cartoon. Some of the landscapes are bright and vivid like those out of a Wallace & Gromit animation or Nintendo's Mario games while others have the dark and surrealist appearance of a living Dali painting. One scene actually has a boy blasting objects with his&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nintendo-DS/dp/B000VXJEW6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nintendo DS</a>.

The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus is Heath Ledger's last film. Gilliam fought to get it completed after Ledger's death and dedicated it to his memory, signing the closing credits: ""A Film from Heath Ledger and friends"". In a way, it was a labor of love. All the actors re-cast for his part were friends of Ledger, and this deserves mentioning. Three friends (Johnny Depp, Jude Law, Colin Farrell) play different representations of Tony in the dream world, and they're all too brief and the change from one Tony to another is somewhat jarring. But this discontinuity can be forgiven, given the circumstances.

I found the film very enjoyable and definitely worth the time to watch. If you're a fan of Gilliam or any of the actors involved, it's a no-brainer.",1269907200,11,4355,5.7984375
3638121,4,B001HN69B8,"The tagline reads, ""A traveling theater company gives its audience much more than they were expecting."" I would concur with that.

""The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus"" was written and directed by Terry Gilliam who also directed the Monty Python movies that we know and love as well as the classic, ""Brazil"". It clearly shows that it came from the same mind as Brazil....with a better budget and more impressive digital effects than he's ever used before. If you are a Gilliam fan, you won't be disappointed.

Christopher Plummer plays Doctor Parnassus, a monk tempted by the devil (Mr. Nick) played by Tom Waits into a game of betting for souls in order to reap rewards like immortality, youth, love, and family. In this latest bet, he risks losing his daughter, Valentina played by Lily Cole, forever. Chance results in coming across a doomed man who calls himself Tony played by Heath Ledger. As we all know, Ledger died before completing his filming so different versions of Tony going through a magic mirror into the Doctor's imagination are played by Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell.

It is a lot to take in, but it has the feel of a dark fairy tale that you may have read from the Grimm's. The themes of good and evil and temptation are common themes, but it feels like a fresh presentation. Doctor Parnassus' method of attracting souls is hitching himself and his family in a giant carriage and setting up a fold-out stage everywhere they go, decked out in fantasy costumes, calling out to the crowds offering a life-changing experience. His magic mirror doesn't look like much from the outside, but once you go in, it's CGI galore. Beauty, fantasy, and occasionally danger and temptation provided by Mr. Nick. Each person who enters must make a choice between purity and temptations and that is how the souls are collected.

I was really happy to see Verne Troyer in a role like this that was so dialogue heavy and free of Mini-Me. I might even be able to forgive odd reality show stints like The Surreal Life from this performance. Lily Cole was a real stand-out in beauty but also captured the young ingenue never understanding her father's real background or her own origins, wanting to break free and lead a normal life. There is just no taking your eyes off her on screen, the camera loves her and she is captivating.

Christopher Plummer played a tragic character dealing with the side effects of immortality and depression, clearly an alcoholic with many regrets. Each bet since the first seems to offer a chance at redemption, but each sinks him deeper down into his own personal torment. Tom Waits was a wonderful devil with a pencil-thin mustache and a joyful demeanor living only to continue the fun of the game.

Heath Ledger's performance was clearly well thought out like many of his roles with little ticks and motivations behind his mysterious background. You never get the complete picture on Tony as bits and pieces come out over time. The trick with using three additional actors to fill in was ingenious to the story, except for his last section of scenes. There's a point where Tony realizes it's HIS world in the imaginarium at that moment and it would have made more sense to revert to his original self for that last sequence but for obvious reasons, impossible. It is noticeable at that essential point, but Collin Farrell does his best to wrap it up. Each of the three actors brought their own business to the role as could be expected and seemed like extensions of the most charming versions of themselves from other films. They did deliver adequately enough in a pinch and there is so much going on in that imaginary world that there is plenty to distract you from it.

This whole movie feels mind-bending with the story and effects. It isn't the way you want to remember Heath Ledger by, that's for sure. His character's entrance and exit from the movie are sobering and chilling. It's a movie that will stick with you a while as it is thought provoking and a fascinating character study. Definitely worth a watch!",1269129600,6,4061,4.727401129943503
3638122,5,B001HN69B8,"Coming to see this with low expectations - while I admire his inventiveness, I have never been much of a Terry Gilliam fan myself, and the word from the critics was not that good - I was very pleasantly surprised with this film. This entertaining and very imaginative fantasy starts with a traveling sideshow driving in a horse-drawn wagon through the seedier parts of a contemporary (if not very realistic) London. Heading the show is a very old wizard/psychic named Dr. Parnassus (veteran Christopher Plummer in a great performance) who promises the few members of the audience interested in them that if they cross a magic mirror, they will travel to a parallel world where their deepest fantasies rule (the ""imaginarium"" of the title), and where they will have to make a fateful choice about whether they want to follow good or evil. The show has little success (their forays into the magic portal tends to end badly for the audience), but in time the somewhat pathetic troupe (who also includes the beautiful teenage daughter of the wizard, a midget who is the sidekick of Dr. Parnassus, and a young assistant who is madly in love with the daughter) will see a change of fortune when they find and rescue a man hanging in a London bridge (Heath Ledger in his final performance before his untimely death). The man joins the troupe and claims to be an amnesiac, but eventually it will be found that he is a crook running from Russian gangsters from whom he took money. With time, we will also learn more of the back story of Dr. Parnassus: he was a monk who made a deal with the devil (impersonated wittily by Tom Waits) centuries ago: he gets to be immortal, but in exchange, he was to give her daughter to the devil when she turns 16. So you get the idea of the sort of convoluted plot here, but let me assure you that when you see it, you will find it very entertaining and less confusing than it sounds. An intelligent and unusual film, full of intriguing ideas, and helped by the fine performances, including that of Ledger: he died before shooting ended, so in his forays into the imaginary portal he is replaced by three different actors: Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell.",1268438400,13,2189,4.601023017902813

The deal is not that Parnassus gives the Devil 5 souls by his daughter's 16 birthday, it's instead a competition between to the two to be the first to reach an allotted amount of souls before her birthday.

  On to the film, if you enjoy Gilliam, then you're likely to enjoy this Faustian Fable. It is phantasmorphical nearly to levels of cartoonery, and it's all quite weird, but it's also uniquely rendered and wildly imaginative. The main fault I found with it was it's meandering narrative progression in the first half, and it's somewhat anticlimactic denouement in the 2nd.

STARRING: Heath Ledger, Christopher Plummer, Andrew Garfield, Tom Waits, Lily Cole, Verne Troyer, Colin Farrell, Johnny Depp and Jude Law

WRITTEN BY: Terry Gilliam and Charles McKeown

DIRECTED BY: Terry Gilliam

Rated: PG - 13
Genre: Science Fiction / Fantasy
Release Date: 08 January 2010
Review Date: 31 January 2010

I've always found Heath Ledger and Johnny Depp to look similar, and thought it would be neat to see them play brothers. Obviously with the un-expected death of Heath Ledger, we will never see that happen. We can at least however, see them play the same character in the newest and last film of Ledger's life: The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus.

Christopher Plummer co-stars as the magnificent Doctor Parnassus. He's an old-timer with a two-bit sideshow act that he barely seems content with. And when I say old-timer, I mean old. He's made a deal with the devil you see, that upon her 16th birthday, his daughter's soul will belong to the devil, granting Parnassus the gift of immortality. He made this deal, years before the birth of his daughter; but he made it nonetheless.

All may not be lost for him however, when the devil (Tom Waits), offers him a new challenge. They will both attempt to collect the souls of five unfortunates, in just two days; the amount of time before his daughter turns 16.

Desperate to keep her on earth with him, the old man regrettably agrees to the bet and the clock starts ticking. It's by sheer magic that Doctor Parnassus will be able to claim these five souls. All he has to do is get five people to willingly step into his `Imaginarium'; a curtain of sorts, onboard his portable side-show trolley. The `Imaginarium' is a kind of mystical dream-world that is different for all who enter.

Parnassus sets hard at work with his crew of co-stars: his daughter Valentina (Lily Cole); the young man, who is infatuated with her, Anton (Andrew Garfield); and of course the mysterious Tony, played primarily by Ledger.

We meet Ledger's character Tony in the most unpleasant and ironic of ways. He appears to be dead, hanging by the neck from a bridge. It will no-doubt put many in an uncomfortable place. He is magically revived and claims to have no memory of who he is or from where he hails. The team of small-time entertainers is in agreement that he can repay them for saving his life by joining their act. Tony accepts the invitation.

All of the actors in the film deliver great performances and are a lot of fun to watch. You will laugh a lot too. This is not a great movie by any means, but it is a good one; especially if you take into consideration how extraordinarily well it was put together.

Ledger passed away on 22 January 2008, leaving his co-stars and crew with the film only two thirds completed. Whatever were they to do? Co-writer and director Terry Gilliam (who had worked with Ledger previously on another good movie - The Brothers Grimm), had a great task ahead of him. He decided to make Ledger's character Tony into a shape shifter.

By divine chance, they were able to transform the missing pieces of the film around the ones with Ledger, with the help of some Hollywood big-shots; Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell, to be exact. They all volunteered to act out the missing pieces of the story that requiring Tony. They could not have done it any better if they tried. The film plays out beautifully with all four actors, playing the same character in different stages of the story.

Johnny Depp looks so much like Heath Ledger, there is one shot in the film that I'm not sure which one of them it is. Look for it and see if you can tell. It's the shot of Tony atop of the trolley after his first transformation into - the Johnny Depp version of himself. Depp perfected Ledger's character terrifically and it puts a smile on your face, knowing he stepped up to do this.

Jude Law plays the second transformation and surprisingly enough, also looks like Ledger somewhat! He too played the character as Ledger would have and it's a treat to watch.

But the biggest surprise to me came from Colin Farrell. Next to Ledger, he spends the longest time as Tony, and he blew me away with his performance. Knowing that he has a very thick Irish accent to cover up, it is astonishing at how similar his speech pattern was to that of Ledger's. He moves like Ledger, he looks like him and all of his facial expressions and physical mannerisms are dead-on. He is very deserving of a best supporting actor Oscar nomination.

I liked Heath Ledger when I first saw him in 10 Things I Hate about You. But when I saw him in The Patriot, I knew he had a bright future ahead of him and I became an instant fan. I was taken aback by his outstanding performance in Brokeback Mountain, and no-one was a bigger fan of his portrayal of The Joker in The Dark Knight. It's easily one of the top ten performances by any actor in the history of cinema.

There is a lot of speculation that he killed himself. I'm not a mind reader and I won't pretend to be. But having seen him in countless interviews, and witnessed his true passion for acting, I just can't buy that he would take his own life in the middle of a film, leaving his co-stars and friends to pick up the pieces. Keep in mind he came back to work with Terry Gilliam a second time, so obviously he had a good relationship with the man. Regardless of what happened to him in that lonely room in New York, - we miss you Heath. And thank-you for the cinematic treasures, you've left us with.",1267401600,3,5547,4.53
3638125,4,B001HN69B8,"Terry Gilliam's latest effort ""The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus"" is a very unique film only the director of ""The Fisher King"" and ""Twelve Monkeys"" can create. You either love it or you find yourself scratching your head and wondering just what the film is all about. You may call it wildly imaginative and fascinating, or just whimsical and self-indulgent. I am sure that many would agree on this, however - that no one else can create the dream-like world of ""The Imaginarium.""

The fantasy film is set in today's London, which looks more like Victorian. You meet the traveling theater troupe of Doctor Parnassus (Christopher Plummer) and its members - Anton (Andrew Garfield), angry dwarf Percy (Verne Troyer), and the doctor's beautiful daughter, 15-year-old Valentina (Lily Cole). And there are some mysteries about the traveling troupe. They have a strange ""mirror,"" a portal to another world. The doctor himself has a secret that he should reveal to his beloved daughter, something she will know in three days.

As you know, ""The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus"" is Heath Ledger's last film. Heath Ledger is brilliant as mysterious Tony who is found hanging under a bridge. Tony joins the troupe and claims he has lost his memories. In the strange world on the other side of the mirror Tony is played by three different actors Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell.

Those who love the silly humor and extraordinary imagination of Terry Gilliam's animations in his Monty Python days will love the film's jokes and visuals such as ""the dancing policemen"" sequence. Those who find the director's previous ""Tideland"" tedious will not be disappointed with the film's visual imagination of the ""Imaginarium."" Acting is also unanimously great and Lily Cole steals every scene she is in.

The story concocted by Terry Gilliam and Charles McKeown (who co-wrote Gilliam's ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"" and ""Brazil"") doesn't make much sense. Is it about Tony or Doctor Parnassus? I am not sure. The larger-than-life characters don't seem to take themselves very seriously. Even ""Mr. Nick"" (very amusing Tom Waits) is not really serious about his bet and he looks as if just enjoying every moment he is in. Perhaps that is exactly what we should do to watch ""The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus.""",1267142400,2,2304,5.0552631578947365
3638126,2,B001HN69B8,"I thought going in that the transitions of Ledger to the other handsome devils would be jarring and detract from the enjoyment of the film. For the most part, however, excluding Jude Law who stuck out like a sore thumb, this was not Parnassus' downfall. The magical realism approach benefited the film greatly and helped to disguise the death of the main character in ways I won't explain for fear of ruining some surprise.
 Gilliam sure does know how to make an imaginative landscape; CG or not the imagination scenes were pretty cool! Also Tom Waits was pretty fun as the devil. The other actors, for the most part, were forgettable (meaning they get the job done and nothing more) except for Vern Troyer-- who was AWFUL! Really monotone, no inflection...no wonder he never spoke in Austin Powers! Just terrible. His character could have been cut, for all I care. Ugh. Also the pacing of the film was sort-of off. Gilliam, while a master of visual splendor, has always had this problem. The Fisher King, his early 90's ""masterpiece"" (I use the term lightly, I prefer ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" or Monty Python shtick personally) fell prey to the same elements of talk-talk-talk, not enough wild, intriguing panache. There were times during this film when I felt excessively bored and just wanted to go ""back through the mirror"" as it were.
  Also the denouncement lacked bite, when the big reveal of who Ledger's character was and what his motivations were. Ho-hum.
  This is just another example (see MirrorMask) of how visual splendor cannot save a movie that has a bad script. Though there were moments of supreme elation such as the first imagination sequence in the forest, the film product felt a bit too cobbled together and ultimately mundane to be regarded as anything but another mediocre Gilliam outing, much in the same vain as the ill-fated Brothers Grimm, which, actually, I enjoyed more than this movie.",1265932800,5,1926,4.8419452887537995
3638127,3,B001HN69B8,"Stunning visuals, wonderful performances, and an intriguing premise--nothing new really for a Terry Gilliam film. However, all those combined still don't add up to a story that really goes anywhere or has a real point, which is sadly ironic for a film that attempts to extol the virtue of a good story. Too bad the film didn't take its own advice.",1264809600,6,347,4.704918032786885
3638128,4,B001HN69B8,"I found this a wonderful collection of vignettes flying in close formation, rather than a single coherent whole. Christopher Plummer's boozy Parnassus provided a strong, unifying presence, although I'd be hard-pressed to call it leadership.

Tom Waits, of course, contributed an amazing personality (along with his acid-washed voice) to the role of Mr. Nick in this deal-with-the-devil plot.

Mostly, I found this a thoughtful montage of imagery, with overtones of everything from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Willy-Wonka-s/dp/B000BB1MI2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Willy Wonka's</a>&nbsp;shoe store, to Gilliam's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monty-Python/dp/B0009XRZ92/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monty Python</a>&nbsp;animations, to Mordor's spreading darkness from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings/dp/B000654ZK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings</a>.

Heath Ledger's unfortunate death partway through filming forced Gilliam to think fast - and he did. It actually made a strange sort of sense that Ledger's character suddenly took on multiple different faces at different moments, the way Gilliam played it out. In the end, that's what I came away with: a renewed appreciation for Gilliam's visual creativity (even if some looked a little recycled). If that's enough for you, too, you'll find plenty to like in this star-studded sleeper.

8309092,5,B001HN69B8,"Terry Gilliam has/had the luck/misfortune, by the evidence of his films, to be (1) a wildly liberated visionary genius, (2) a cynical, even diabolical, pessimist, (3) an anti-suit/anti-studio rebel and (4) a technical perfectonist -- albeit with a greater arsenal of ridicule, rather than Ken Russell's intoxicated rapture with Art, to make the flames of perdition worth it for his characters.

I once lent Gilliam's magnum opus Brazil to a dear friend, a stunningly beautiful foreign woman with a completely normal psychological profile and a happy, healthy upbringing (and a conventional, optimistic, aspirational complaisance vis-a-vis the world's sinkholes of damnable exploitation and indifference). She couldn't bring herself to watch it to the end: ""It's too sarcastic!""

Brazil was *gloriously* sarcastic of course, a gorgeous banquet of satirical savagery, eyes wide open to the way silly, all-too-common dreams ruin our common reality (somewhat like Ken Russell's masterpiece The Music Lovers -- which she also, poor beautiful dear, found off-putting).

So this, Gilliam's last fully realized jewel case of phantasmagorical mania and withering British mockery, goes light and whimsical in tone, as though anticipating my lovely friend's reservations, with no urgent mass indictment of privileged delusion; a bit less innocent than The Time Bandits; though not one jot less of free-associational fancy than The Adventures of Baron Munchausen. Tom Waits fans with a nostalgia for color and deadpan silliness should enjoy (Waits himself guesting as a demimonde Mephostophilis); the wan and wistful who still daydream in reverse will smile; cinephiliac adventurers should chortle and clap. There isn't a flaw in this dream; there wouldn't have been a flaw in the execution if Heath Ledger hadn't died, but the painful gap between dreams and Earth anchors the story anyway, so the brotherly, almost-impersonations of Ledger by Johnny Depp, Jude Law and Colin Farrell to fill out the shooting schedule do not in fact kill it off, but make its point truer.  A lovely madness reigns here, Christopher Plummer game for damn near anything true to itself, with an on-the-nose supporting cast.  One grows more grateful with age for risks rarely taken like this.  Gilliam will treat you Special and dazzle you with things other mortals need hallucinogens to think up and most conventional moviegoers would need drink to assimilate.  As piercing  (in its sweet way) as any Errol Morris documentary, and even more welcome.",1516579200,,2517,5.419437340153452
