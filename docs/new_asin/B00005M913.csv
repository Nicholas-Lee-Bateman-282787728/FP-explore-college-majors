7944979,2,B00005M913,"Dumb film. Dumb ending. Just plain dumb. Rod Steiger. Eric Roberts. Catherine Oxenberg.
An art galley seeks the artist behind the painting she adores and finds more than she bargained for. Trite plot. Not much else to say about this one. I bought it on a DVD with some other loser films. No wonder they were all together. Fortunately, I spent under five dollars. The cost of a bad rental anywhere.",1464998400,,397,4.605633802816901
7944980,1,B00005M913,"I bought this as part of the 8-movie Midnight Horror pack.  At $5, it was way over-priced.  FROZEN IN FEAR, or THE FLYING DUTCHMAN, is exceptionally boring, insipid, and just a mess.  The back-story is told through a series of flashbacks that tell us nothing about the main character.  The relationships between characters is never clarified; and, the ""surprise"" twists are so predictable there are no surprises.  Avoid this one, regardless of cost.",1356134400,,449,5.095890410958904
7944981,1,B00005M913,"The movie opens in Montana in 1975. A young boy, Shawn, a son of an artist, discovers his mom is fooling around on dad, and so does dad. Then suddenly we go from a daylight picture postcard to a nighttime storm on a boat as Shawn watches daddy kill mommy and then die. He is raised by a neighbor in a town filled with mist, missing teen girls, a bunch of guys with anger management issues, and a woman who lives in fear of everything. Lacey (Oxenberg) runs an art studio in NY and has obtained a painting by Shawn. She wants more of them, so she travels out to Montana to meet the artist. She discovers Shawn is a mute (who owns a phone) and like most studio owners she makes love to the artist. There are several love making scenes between the two, one of which could be described as ""brief nudity"" (about 3 frames of a possible body double). Joan Benedict plays Rod Steiger's wife.

The town's name is Dark Hollow and it has a secret. Warning: Contains full frontal nudity (Ellina McCormick) and an ending that made no sense. Also released under the title ""The Flying Dutchman"" which also doesn't make much sense.",1303430400,2,1115,4.386473429951691
7944982,2,B00005M913,"Watching this, I spontaneously thought that with a touch here, a touch there it might have become much better. It's a run off the mill story about a crazy artist with a traumatic past who lives an isolated life and may or may not be dangerous. The actors do the best they can but do not really save it. The set design is not bad and I found the artist's work on display quite interesting.",1197849600,2,388,4.1866666666666665
7944983,3,B00005M913,"What can I say about this movie? I never thought acting and directing can sink to that level before watching Frozen in Fear on cable yesterday! What I saw was more like dollars being burned in front of my eyes..what a waste of money I thought.
My remote was at the ready to make a quick exit into anything, even watching the shopping channel would have been a welcome diversion, had not the lovely Catherine Oxenberg started peeling off her clothes faster than my twitchy fingers managed to change channels. In fact there is a lot of sex scenes and nudity in the film, it somehow compensates for the lame and weak script, acting and directing.
I just felt sorry for Eric Roberts..To be typecast is not necessarily a bad thing for an actor, if anything it is a more secure way to get the job and pay your bills, but he really should rethink his future choices. He is not a bad actor per se, but his frequent portrayal of a baddie/psycho/tortured man can be exhausting to watch after a while. Rod Steiger was in this movie as well..Rod Steiger was in this movie???? Why?
I don't expect of course all films to be masterpieces, and not all directors are Truffaut or Kubrick..there is a market and different tastes out there for many genres and many level of entertainment(like music you have your Beethovens and your Spears), but at least a film should have the minimum: to be watchable.
So if you want a film that has this minimun then avoid Frozen Fear, however if you want to watch the beautiful Catherine Oxenberg doing her bit for 'art' then rent this movie and thank God for the wonders of the remote control.",1064016000,9,1611,4.501706484641638
7944984,4,B00005M913,"I have to admit, when I rented this movie from my local video store, I didn't have high hopes. I expected a barley decent film, that would probably be unwatchable. Due to the intriquing premise,however, I gave in and rented it. Well, I must say, I was pleasently surprised, when the movie started getting good. Despite a few plot holes, this movie just goes to show that proves that a big-budget is not requires, to produce a good film.",1026345600,6,436,4.531645569620253
