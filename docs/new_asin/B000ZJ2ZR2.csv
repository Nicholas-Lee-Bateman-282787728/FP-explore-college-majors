3041838,5,B000ZJ2ZR2,"This is a beautiful movie in every way.  The filming, the lighting, the gorgeous pastel colors, the not-too-soft soft-focus, and of course the stunning women make this DVD a joy.  Thank you Tinto Brass.  Time to try other movies by him.  The man has a jaw-droppingly healthy attitude toward sex, nudity, bodies, women, love, humor, and movie making.  Moreover, ""Voyeur"" throws a vastly different slant on feminism from the one we are fed daily.  If this movie doesn't show the empowerment of women -- in ways that men cannot but like, even though they (we) find hard to handle -- then what does?  It may be fantasy, but Brass' approach brings men joy in showing women fulfilled and happy -- IN BEING WOMEN!!  An Oscar for Tinto.....even though I think he has already enjoyed his share of earth's blessings!!",1212278400,63,807,4.755395683453237
3041839,4,B000ZJ2ZR2,"This is a typical Tinto Brass romp. Not much substance, but it was a fun and somewhat humorous movie. Due to Tinto's obvious and extensive use of male prosthectic devices, I am beginning to wonder if ED is an issue on the set. I know of one case in the movie, it was probably used in the sense of  exageration. I don't remember if Tinto did his usual cameo, but I think so. If you are a fan of Tinto Brass, then you will probably enjoy this. I also have, Frivilous Lola, Private, and Cheeky. all of which I've enjoyed. These are reminiscent of the old Italian sex farces with Laura Antonelli, only on steriods. Charlie S.",1211414400,29,621,4.3076923076923075
3041840,4,B000ZJ2ZR2,"This is a very enjoyable piece of softcore erotica. If you're a fan of Tinto Brass, you'll know what to expect. It is light-hearted, breezy and absolutely charming. It is filled with Brass' perennial obsessions - hairy bushes and succulent bottoms. Sadly, no peeing beauties this time round.

Based on Alberto Moravia's book ""L'Uomo che Guarda"" (The One who Watches - Voyeur) it revolves around a young Italian Literature Professor who has a preference for watching rather than doing. He has a very apt name - Dodo. His seriously hot wife gets so fed up that she resorts to extramarital affairs and finally threatens divorce. Meanwhile Dodo is immersed in a world where everyone else is happily doing it. His bedridden father does it with the sexy nurse who goes around topless and often bottomless as well. His students are all doing it, sometimes in public. One pretty student invites him over for a threesome but sadly he can only get his kicks by watching. At the local nudist beach, everyone is at it. When he finally finds out who his wife is having her fling with, there is at last a happy ending - of sorts.

Newcomer Katarina Vasilissa, a blonde Polish photomodel-turned-actress, looks stunning as Dodo's sexy wife. Thankfully she spends most of the time undressed and engaged in happy activities both in bed and on the beach. Cristina Garavaglia as the naughty nurse is equally watchable. Where blonde Katarina is smoulderingly hot, brunette Cristina is gaminely sexy. All the other bit players are equally attractive.

For softcore erotica, Voyeur is much more explicit than usual. There is copious full frontal nudity. Tinto Brass' lovingly lingering beaver shots are in abundance. I especially loved the Cigar scene (a tribute to Bill Clinton). Strangely, there are also a lot of birdie shots. And very rarely for softcore, there is a scene showing a steadily rising birdie, all the way up to full tumescence. Of course there are also various scenes of simulated sex. Cowboy and doggy. All looking pretty real. And very hot.

The DVD from Cult Epics is in 1.78:1 (enhanced for widescreen TV). It looks very nice with soft pastel colours, soft-focus lensing and a pretty decent transfer. Very clean print. However I believe, this was shot in 1.66:1 (like other Tinto Brass films) and subsequently cropped across the top and bottom to fit the new 1.78:1 widescreen TV. Very sad but what can I say. The fullscreen crowd who hate black bars have taken over the studios.

This comes in the original Italian with optional English subtitles. Make sure you get the original Italian Uncut version (in Italian), and not the separate English dubbed version made for the US market. In the accompanying interview, Brass makes clear that he takes no responsibility for any cutting in the American version. All in all a fine addition to the Tinto Brass collection.",1206316800,178,2862,4.904958677685951
3041841,4,B000ZJ2ZR2,"I mostly read written reviews in order to get some info on the product itself, i.e. picture/sound quality, aspect ratio, bonus materials, bugs and problems, etc. So I hope this review might be of help.

The picture is good, although definitely not the best copy was used for this edition. Unfortunately, the frame cuts some of the picture at top and bottom, just like on the italian DVD (CVC edition, although the excellent VHS tape reveals the whole picture!). I would like to mention the english subtitles as the advantage of this edition though. Bonus interview with Tinto Brass is always welcome, just as in this case. Interesting, especially for those interested in his creative work.

As for the movie itself - it is simply great!

Subjective resume: worth paying money for the uncut edition.",1206230400,22,798,4.896296296296296

3041863,5,B000ZJ2ZR2,"I received more than I expected. You see, American porn is the most boring thing in the world. In addition, I will state that American film makers seldom have produced decent erotica, perhaps because our society has been subjected to moral censorship for so long. Not so in Europe. Tinto Brass has created a wonderful movie, witty, seductive and, oh, those fabulously voluptuous women. Nothing comparable to the emaciated, uber skinny and anorexic looking American females. Tinto's women are a gift of the gods. Some pious persons may decide that ""The Voyeur"" is a pornographic movie. Not so. It's an erotic movie, because it's art. Pornography, at its best, is a remedy for insomnia. Erotism is an art, and an extremely difficult one to create. Be aware that this review is for the 100 minute special edition version.

3041880,5,B000ZJ2ZR2,"It's strange to read all those reviewers complaining about ""lack of depth"",""silly plot"",""weak story"",etc...in this and other T.Brass films. If you are looking for ""depth"" and ""clever plot"" - STAY AWAY FROM Tinto Brass movies at all and go to Ingmar Bergman,Luchino Visconti or Alfred Hitchkock (whom I personally like very much too!) instead. But if you want something that is totally different from ""clever"" erotica (""Emanuelle"",""Jamon,Jamon"" and the like)of Just Jaeckin or Bigas Luna,really stupid flicks of Russ Meyer or perverse S/M escapades of Jess Franco or Walerian Borowczyk,then Brass is the best choice. It is this charm of a teenager's ""silly"" erotic phantasies and dreams in his best films that are SO ATTRACTIVE.It's a world of pagan love rites,sweet lust,peeping pleasures and secret phantasies, brought by the gifted director to the screen, that is totally devoid of any moral,religious or social conventions. To immerse into this strange,illogical,absurdly naive, but very sweet world sometimes is really a pure joy! No other film-maker does it better than Mr. Brass. AND IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH PORN! Even in the most explicit scenes!

3041884,5,B000ZJ2ZR2,"This is what intelligent and well-made Erotica should strive to be! ""L'uomo che guarda"" (""The Voyeur"" from 1993), was directed by Tinto Brass and, based on the novel of the same title by Alberto Moravia. As luck would have it, even in the empty and vapid landscape of the 90's (the sex-comedy and Erotica were dead), we still had a master filmmaker ('Tintoretto') plying his craft. Tinto Brass could have literally made dozens of this type of film between the 80's and 90's, but thankfully he dedicated himself to quality and not quantity, and it paid-off.

This story is about 'Edoardo' (Francesco Casale) a college lecturer who is separated from his beautiful wife 'Silvia' (Katarina Vasilissa) and who has unreconciled issues with his enlightened father 'il professore' (Antonio Salines). The poor 'old-professor' is looked after by his hot-to-trot nurse 'Fausta' (Cristina Garavaglia) who cares for his every need! Did I mention how funny this film is!! Early on, there is a scene where 'Dodo' asked 'Fausta' in the kitchen (she was wearing the smallest and tightest of shorts you can imagine), ""......morning, Fausta......is my father up yet?......""---and she replied---""......you bet!......""---and taken aback he asked her---""......what's......you bet......mean?......""---and she replied---""......that's for me to know!......"" The actors were very good: the old professor, Dodo, Fausta and Silvia, they were really professional and showed no signs of being uptight or inhibited with the material (now that's professionalism). I also learned something while watching this film, besides being a ""cinephile"", I am also a ""scopophile"" it seems (see the film to find out), makes a lot of sense too. There is also a very funny scene on the beach (this is one of the film's most hedonistic moments), where 'Dodo' is walking along the sand, when suddenly an old-looking bum yells over to him---""......protected zone......access by payment only......""---to which Dodo replied---""......isn't this a free beach?......""---after a small exchange of words Dodo said---""......oh, I get it......you're kind of a park supervisor......""---to which the bum answered---""......pork supervisor is more like it!......"" Too funny!

From start to finish, this film has some well-conceived erotic imagery (from the 'peek-a-boo' shots, to the well composed: Art Direction, Lighting and Cinematography). 'Tintoretto' is a genius for getting it right. Fans of the sex-comedy and Erotica in particular, but even the ""art house"" crowd would appreciate this film. This really is a modern erotic masterpiece. An excellent job all-around. The DVD picture quality by Cult Epics is excellent, they did a fantastic job on this special edition. NTSC, Italian (English subtitles), English (dubbed), NR 99 mins. (BTW: There is a scene involving 'Fausta' and a Cuban cigar from the professor, simply hilarious and prophetic!)

3041885,5,B000ZJ2ZR2,"It could be argued that this is sensuality at its best! The two female characters are gorgeous, though in entirely different ways. The male counterpart is suitable as well. The voyeurism is subtle and pleasantly subversive. The counterpoint to voyeurism is exhibitionism. There is that too. The penis plays a prominent role visually. The story is not for telling but if you delight in eroticism and flirt with the notion of the voyeur, then this is a film to watch. Excellent!",1300320000,2,476,4.888888888888889
3041886,5,B000ZJ2ZR2,"I never saw an erotic movie like, ""The Voyeur"" that was surprisingly done in good taste. Your eyes never get tired of looking at Katarina Vasilissa's (Silvia) and Christina Garavaglia's (Fausta) beauty throughout the entire film. Visually, both of these ladies definitely carried the movie. Polish Playboy model, Katarina Vasilissa could possibly be the most stunning beauty to ever grace the erotic movie screen. This is the first Tinto Brass movie that I ever watched. In all probability, The Voyeur may also be one of the best classic erotic films ever made.

This movie was definitely made to be watched and enjoyed. It was based on the novel, ""The Voyeur"", by Alberto Moravia"" with a lot of Tinto Brass flavor added to it. The movie basically follows the same storyline as the original novel, but it truly changes and over exaggerates to make things more visually and sexually exciting. For example: In the movie, Silvia is portrayed as a lustful exhibitionist, who seems to be living it up all hours of the day and night. Another movie scene shows Dodo day-dreaming of his wife engaged in sexual intercourse with everyone on the beach.

""SPOILER ALERT""
ACTUAL STORYLINE (movie version)
The movie is about Eduardo (Francesco Casale), a college professor who goes by the nick name of Dodo. He and his wife, Silvia lived under the same roof with Dodo's father. Inherently, Dodo and his wife are newlyweds and he has no idea why his wife left him. He starts living life passively, while spending his time reminiscing about Silvia and thoroughly soul searching his life for answers necessary to get his wife back. He was unaware that Silvia left the flat to get away from the ""other man"" to end an affair that Dodo was totally oblivious to. She was also soul searching, because she loved her husband and felt guilty; she knew she had to end it. She finally tells her husband why she left, but didn't tell him who the ""other man"" was, because she was too ashamed. She tries to stay away from the other man, but she can't shake the sexual attraction for the way the other man takes her from behind. Though the affair originally started when Silvia was raped on her wedding day, it continued because she found this first experience from behind to be irresistible. Dodo eventually tells her that he doesn't want to see her anymore. Silvia stops him and tells him that she only loves him and that she needs him to help her get over the affair. Dodo delivers a funny line and asks, ""What am I supposed to do? Hold on the other man's clothes, while both of you are humping?"" As a result, she immediately tries to end the affair, but again is caught-up giving into the other man for the last time - the same night Fausta (the nurse) couldn't go to sleep due to the sexual noises coming from the next room. The thinly-clad nurse, Fausta, hints and actually tells Dodo that his wife is cheating with his father. He knows Fausta is telling the truth.

Even though the affair is over and done with, the ending of this movie comes across as ambiguous and unexpected, by using Silvia's dialog as a humorous way to end the movie; She tells Dodo, ""The other man is gone and now we can live in the same flat: me, you, and your father!"". It leaves the audience hanging and wondering, ""Is this affair really over? Nevertheless, the movie's satire and humorous ending hooks the perplexity of the audience.

Towards the end of the movie, Dodo thrusts his hips into Silvia, as she tells him how the affair began. He finally realizes that his sexual intimacy can no longer be limited to being a ""one trick pony"".  Silvia still maintains a serene face while making love to Dodo, knowing how it attracts and fascinates him. The movie doesn't address this, but the novel by Alberto Moravia explains why.

AFTER READING ""THE VOYEUR"", BY ALBERTO MORAVIA

After reading the ""The Voyeur"", by Alberto Moravia. You realize when Silvia left, she became the empowered heroine and the true catalyst of the story. She left the apartment to get away from Dodo's father to end the affair and get over the ""crush"" that she had on his ""pig mantra quickie from behind"". In spite of the fact that she enjoyed the sexual tryst, she felt ashamed and guilty every time she was unfaithful. So she had to do something about it and left the flat to finally end the affair before she returned back to Dodo. She also left to get Dodo's attention. She never had any intentions to ever leave him, but she wanted Dodo to know (or guess) about the affair. Silvia tells Dodo, "" I tried to make you see, but it was as if you were blind. and then maybe I was ashamed of admitting it.""  Thank goodness this is only a tragic tale, because in reality, if a man found out that his father raped his wife on their wedding day. He would probably castrate the old perverted father and throw him (many times) out of a sixth floor window. I highly recommend this Movie based on its leading ladies' beauty!",1295395200,4,4939,4.585503963759909

3041888,1,B000ZJ2ZR2,"This film is a fraudulent version of the original.  I was greatly disappointed when I watched this film.  The original is very good but this version was dubbed in English and was edited in the typical American fashion treating all nudity as porn.  I was disappointed to find all the male nudity was edited out.  The original is very gratuitous with male and female nudity but it was obvious the film was edited for a straight male audience since every scene that showed Dodo or his father naked was deleted whereas the female parts were mostly kept whole.  The reason I like foreign films is for their honest and open portrayal of stories (and unabashed nudity) but in this anglicized version, scene transgression is choppy since so much has been removed.  I knew this was a film for a straight male audience but the version they are selling is not the film Tinto Brass made but some prudish version.  This should have been made clear as I feel ripped-off and deceived into thinking I was getting an honest version of the film.",1277942400,50,1027,4.6098901098901095

The filming, the lighting, the gorgeous pastel colors, the not-too-soft soft-focus, and of course the stunning women make this DVD a joy.  Thank you Tinto Brass.  Time to try other movies by him.  The man has a jaw-droppingly healthy attitude toward sex, nudity, bodies, women, love, humor, and movie making.  Moreover, ""Voyeur"" throws a vastly different slant on feminism from the one we are fed daily.  If this movie doesn't show the empowerment of women -- in ways that men cannot but like, even though they (we) find hard to handle -- then what does?  It may be fantasy, but Brass' approach brings men joy in showing women fulfilled and happy -- IN BEING WOMEN!!

I know of one case in the movie, it was probably used in the sense of  exageration. I don't remember if Tinto did his usual cameo, but I think so. If you are a fan of Tinto Brass, then you will probably enjoy this. I also have, Frivilous Lola, Private, and Cheeky. all of which I've enjoyed.

3276337,4,B000ZJ2ZR2,"This is a very enjoyable piece of softcore erotica. If you're a fan of Tinto Brass, you'll know what to expect. It is light-hearted, breezy and absolutely charming. It is filled with Brass' perennial obsessions - hairy bushes and succulent bottoms. Sadly, no peeing beauties this time round.

Based on Alberto Moravia's book ""L'Uomo che Guarda"" (The One who Watches - Voyeur) it revolves around a young Italian Literature Professor who has a preference for watching rather than doing. He has a very apt name - Dodo. His seriously hot wife gets so fed up that she resorts to extramarital affairs and finally threatens divorce. Meanwhile Dodo is immersed in a world where everyone else is happily doing it. His bedridden father does it with the sexy nurse who goes around topless and often bottomless as well. His students are all doing it, sometimes in public. One pretty student invites him over for a threesome but sadly he can only get his kicks by watching. At the local nudist beach, everyone is at it. When he finally finds out who his wife is having her fling with, there is at last a happy ending - of sorts.

Newcomer Katarina Vasilissa, a blonde Polish photomodel-turned-actress, looks stunning as Dodo's sexy wife. Thankfully she spends most of the time undressed and engaged in happy activities both in bed and on the beach. Cristina Garavaglia as the naughty nurse is equally watchable. Where blonde Katarina is smoulderingly hot, brunette Cristina is gaminely sexy. All the other bit players are equally attractive.

For softcore erotica, Voyeur is much more explicit than usual. There is copious full frontal nudity. Tinto Brass' lovingly lingering beaver shots are in abundance. I especially loved the Cigar scene (a tribute to Bill Clinton). Strangely, there are also a lot of birdie shots. And very rarely for softcore, there is a scene showing a steadily rising birdie, all the way up to full tumescence. Of course there are also various scenes of simulated sex. Cowboy and doggy. All looking pretty real. And very hot.

The DVD from Cult Epics is in 1.78:1 (enhanced for widescreen TV). It looks very nice with soft pastel colours, soft-focus lensing and a pretty decent transfer. Very clean print. However I believe, this was shot in 1.66:1 (like other Tinto Brass films) and subsequently cropped across the top and bottom to fit the new 1.78:1 widescreen TV. Very sad but what can I say. The fullscreen crowd who hate black bars have taken over the studios.

This comes in the original Italian with optional English subtitles. Make sure you get the original Italian Uncut version (in Italian), and not the separate English dubbed version made for the US market. In the accompanying interview, Brass makes clear that he takes no responsibility for any cutting in the American version. All in all a fine addition to the Tinto Brass collection.",1206316800,178,2862,4.904958677685951

Unfortunately, the frame cuts some of the picture at top and bottom, just like on the italian DVD (CVC edition, although the excellent VHS tape reveals the whole picture!). I would like to mention the english subtitles as the advantage of this edition though. Bonus interview with Tinto Brass is always welcome, just as in this case.

In addition, I will state that American film makers seldom have produced decent erotica, perhaps because our society has been subjected to moral censorship for so long. Not so in Europe. Tinto Brass has created a wonderful movie, witty, seductive and, oh, those fabulously voluptuous women. Nothing comparable to the emaciated, uber skinny and anorexic looking American females. Tinto's women are a gift of the gods. Some pious persons may decide that ""The Voyeur"" is a pornographic movie. Not so. It's an erotic movie, because it's art. Pornography, at its best, is a remedy for insomnia. Erotism is an art, and an extremely difficult one to create. Be aware that this review is for the 100 minute special edition version.

If you are looking for ""depth"" and ""clever plot"" - STAY AWAY FROM Tinto Brass movies at all and go to Ingmar Bergman,Luchino Visconti or Alfred Hitchkock (whom I personally like very much too!) instead. But if you want something that is totally different from ""clever"" erotica (""Emanuelle"",""Jamon,Jamon"" and the like)of Just Jaeckin or Bigas Luna,really stupid flicks of Russ Meyer or perverse S/M escapades of Jess Franco or Walerian Borowczyk,then Brass is the best choice. It is this charm of a teenager's ""silly"" erotic phantasies and dreams in his best films that are SO ATTRACTIVE.It's a world of pagan love rites,sweet lust,peeping pleasures and secret phantasies, brought by the gifted director to the screen, that is totally devoid of any moral,religious or social conventions. To immerse into this strange,illogical,absurdly naive, but very sweet world sometimes is really a pure joy! No other film-maker does it better than Mr. Brass. AND IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH PORN!

3276381,5,B000ZJ2ZR2,"This is what intelligent and well-made Erotica should strive to be! ""L'uomo che guarda"" (""The Voyeur"" from 1993), was directed by Tinto Brass and, based on the novel of the same title by Alberto Moravia. As luck would have it, even in the empty and vapid landscape of the 90's (the sex-comedy and Erotica were dead), we still had a master filmmaker ('Tintoretto') plying his craft. Tinto Brass could have literally made dozens of this type of film between the 80's and 90's, but thankfully he dedicated himself to quality and not quantity, and it paid-off.

This story is about 'Edoardo' (Francesco Casale) a college lecturer who is separated from his beautiful wife 'Silvia' (Katarina Vasilissa) and who has unreconciled issues with his enlightened father 'il professore' (Antonio Salines). The poor 'old-professor' is looked after by his hot-to-trot nurse 'Fausta' (Cristina Garavaglia) who cares for his every need! Did I mention how funny this film is!! Early on, there is a scene where 'Dodo' asked 'Fausta' in the kitchen (she was wearing the smallest and tightest of shorts you can imagine), ""......morning, Fausta......is my father up yet?......""---and she replied---""......you bet!......""---and taken aback he asked her---""......what's......you bet......mean?......""---and she replied---""......that's for me to know!......"" The actors were very good: the old professor, Dodo, Fausta and Silvia, they were really professional and showed no signs of being uptight or inhibited with the material (now that's professionalism). I also learned something while watching this film, besides being a ""cinephile"", I am also a ""scopophile"" it seems (see the film to find out), makes a lot of sense too. There is also a very funny scene on the beach (this is one of the film's most hedonistic moments), where 'Dodo' is walking along the sand, when suddenly an old-looking bum yells over to him---""......protected zone......access by payment only......""---to which Dodo replied---""......isn't this a free beach?......""---after a small exchange of words Dodo said---""......oh, I get it......you're kind of a park supervisor......""---to which the bum answered---""......pork supervisor is more like it!......"" Too funny!

From start to finish, this film has some well-conceived erotic imagery (from the 'peek-a-boo' shots, to the well composed: Art Direction, Lighting and Cinematography). 'Tintoretto' is a genius for getting it right. Fans of the sex-comedy and Erotica in particular, but even the ""art house"" crowd would appreciate this film. This really is a modern erotic masterpiece. An excellent job all-around. The DVD picture quality by Cult Epics is excellent, they did a fantastic job on this special edition. NTSC, Italian (English subtitles), English (dubbed), NR 99 mins. (BTW: There is a scene involving 'Fausta' and a Cuban cigar from the professor, simply hilarious and prophetic!)

Love and Peace,

3276382,5,B000ZJ2ZR2,"It could be argued that this is sensuality at its best! The two female characters are gorgeous, though in entirely different ways. The male counterpart is suitable as well. The voyeurism is subtle and pleasantly subversive. The counterpoint to voyeurism is exhibitionism. There is that too. The penis plays a prominent role visually. The story is not for telling but if you delight in eroticism and flirt with the notion of the voyeur, then this is a film to watch. Excellent!",1300320000,2,476,4.888888888888889
3276383,5,B000ZJ2ZR2,"I never saw an erotic movie like, ""The Voyeur"" that was surprisingly done in good taste. Your eyes never get tired of looking at Katarina Vasilissa's (Silvia) and Christina Garavaglia's (Fausta) beauty throughout the entire film. Visually, both of these ladies definitely carried the movie. Polish Playboy model, Katarina Vasilissa could possibly be the most stunning beauty to ever grace the erotic movie screen. This is the first Tinto Brass movie that I ever watched. In all probability, The Voyeur may also be one of the best classic erotic films ever made.

This movie was definitely made to be watched and enjoyed. It was based on the novel, ""The Voyeur"", by Alberto Moravia"" with a lot of Tinto Brass flavor added to it. The movie basically follows the same storyline as the original novel, but it truly changes and over exaggerates to make things more visually and sexually exciting. For example: In the movie, Silvia is portrayed as a lustful exhibitionist, who seems to be living it up all hours of the day and night. Another movie scene shows Dodo day-dreaming of his wife engaged in sexual intercourse with everyone on the beach.

""SPOILER ALERT""
ACTUAL STORYLINE (movie version)
The movie is about Eduardo (Francesco Casale), a college professor who goes by the nick name of Dodo. He and his wife, Silvia lived under the same roof with Dodo's father. Inherently, Dodo and his wife are newlyweds and he has no idea why his wife left him. He starts living life passively, while spending his time reminiscing about Silvia and thoroughly soul searching his life for answers necessary to get his wife back. He was unaware that Silvia left the flat to get away from the ""other man"" to end an affair that Dodo was totally oblivious to. She was also soul searching, because she loved her husband and felt guilty; she knew she had to end it. She finally tells her husband why she left, but didn't tell him who the ""other man"" was, because she was too ashamed. She tries to stay away from the other man, but she can't shake the sexual attraction for the way the other man takes her from behind. Though the affair originally started when Silvia was raped on her wedding day, it continued because she found this first experience from behind to be irresistible. Dodo eventually tells her that he doesn't want to see her anymore. Silvia stops him and tells him that she only loves him and that she needs him to help her get over the affair. Dodo delivers a funny line and asks, ""What am I supposed to do? Hold on the other man's clothes, while both of you are humping?"" As a result, she immediately tries to end the affair, but again is caught-up giving into the other man for the last time - the same night Fausta (the nurse) couldn't go to sleep due to the sexual noises coming from the next room. The thinly-clad nurse, Fausta, hints and actually tells Dodo that his wife is cheating with his father. He knows Fausta is telling the truth.

Even though the affair is over and done with, the ending of this movie comes across as ambiguous and unexpected, by using Silvia's dialog as a humorous way to end the movie; She tells Dodo, ""The other man is gone and now we can live in the same flat: me, you, and your father!"". It leaves the audience hanging and wondering, ""Is this affair really over? Nevertheless, the movie's satire and humorous ending hooks the perplexity of the audience.

Towards the end of the movie, Dodo thrusts his hips into Silvia, as she tells him how the affair began. He finally realizes that his sexual intimacy can no longer be limited to being a ""one trick pony"".  Silvia still maintains a serene face while making love to Dodo, knowing how it attracts and fascinates him. The movie doesn't address this, but the novel by Alberto Moravia explains why.

AFTER READING ""THE VOYEUR"", BY ALBERTO MORAVIA

After reading the ""The Voyeur"", by Alberto Moravia. You realize when Silvia left, she became the empowered heroine and the true catalyst of the story. She left the apartment to get away from Dodo's father to end the affair and get over the ""crush"" that she had on his ""pig mantra quickie from behind"". In spite of the fact that she enjoyed the sexual tryst, she felt ashamed and guilty every time she was unfaithful. So she had to do something about it and left the flat to finally end the affair before she returned back to Dodo. She also left to get Dodo's attention. She never had any intentions to ever leave him, but she wanted Dodo to know (or guess) about the affair. Silvia tells Dodo, "" I tried to make you see, but it was as if you were blind. and then maybe I was ashamed of admitting it.""  Thank goodness this is only a tragic tale, because in reality, if a man found out that his father raped his wife on their wedding day. He would probably castrate the old perverted father and throw him (many times) out of a sixth floor window. I highly recommend this Movie based on its leading ladies' beauty!",1295395200,4,4939,4.585503963759909
3276384,5,B000ZJ2ZR2,I think this is the greatest movie directed by Tinto Brass. The movie I got was the uncut version. So I was able to enjoy a masterpiece to the fullest.,1294704000,2,151,4.066666666666666
3276385,1,B000ZJ2ZR2,"This film is a fraudulent version of the original.  I was greatly disappointed when I watched this film.  The original is very good but this version was dubbed in English and was edited in the typical American fashion treating all nudity as porn.  I was disappointed to find all the male nudity was edited out.  The original is very gratuitous with male and female nudity but it was obvious the film was edited for a straight male audience since every scene that showed Dodo or his father naked was deleted whereas the female parts were mostly kept whole.  The reason I like foreign films is for their honest and open portrayal of stories (and unabashed nudity) but in this anglicized version, scene transgression is choppy since so much has been removed.  I knew this was a film for a straight male audience but the version they are selling is not the film Tinto Brass made but some prudish version.  This should have been made clear as I feel ripped-off and deceived into thinking I was getting an honest version of the film.",1277942400,50,1027,4.6098901098901095

It had a story, a bit shallow, but who buys these movies for great story lines. The maid was very sexy with great tits, Dodo's wife, very very very sexy, horny, and I loved the scene where she masterbated in the chinese restaurant for Dodo and the Chinese guy. I was just disappointed at the lack of the voyeur angle, I expected more keyhole peeping or something, I didn't think there was all that much voyeurism in it, that said.it REALLY pleased my girlfriend.
