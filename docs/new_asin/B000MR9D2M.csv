8171204,4,B000MR9D2M,"Peach Girl is a good series. It's definitely meant for girls. That doesn't mean that a dude can't find it entertaining. Emotions don't have sex boundary. Momo is a high school girl who has a crappy best friend and 2 really cool guys that want to date her. Her best friend is determined to make her life hell. This anime explores her relationships with both of her guy friends and the decision she makes on which one to become lovers with. Momo is a great character. You really feel for the troubles she encounters, and want her to be happy.

The animation in this series is pretty good. The voice acting is as well. I've always liked Cherami Leigh. She's not the main character, but she's great. The soundtrack in this is also very fitting. It's a very drama and it keeps you wanting more. I highly recommend it. Especially to a younger teenage audience.",1354838400,,854,4.509677419354839
8171205,5,B000MR9D2M,"Look I'm going to tell it like it is. I don't watch these type of anime's I'm not in to them at all. I happend to end up checking out this series by chance. It was one of Funimation's new shows that they were airing on their network, and one day I left the TV on and started watching it while I waited for another show to come on. All I can say is that Peach Girl is one of the best ""romance"" anime's I have seen. The art is fantastic, and the story keeps you interested, and best of all it's not ""girly"" like I'm a guy and I didn't feel guilty about watching it. I thought it was great because I was rooting for Kairi who was a guy quite like myself. I got into it I really did. not to mention Momo was an awsome girl herself which made it worth watching. The show is pretty ""Adult"", meaning your not going to see goofy nose bleed jokes, rediculous sex jokes, or anything like that. It's pretty realistic and a lot of fun to watch. It's one of my favorite anime's and really opened me up to that side of anime, but I have yet to see anything like it since. Peach girl is truly in a league of her own. I reccomend this to anyone that enjoys a good romance/drama. I liked it, and I'm not even into those sorts of shows. This is one of those anime's that you really hated to see end, but the ending was so satisfying you knew it was for the better.",1236643200,4,1346,3.970479704797048
8171206,5,B000MR9D2M,"ok so i've never seen any of Soloman's work but I am a huge anime fan and i watch a lot of them (inuyasha, naruto, full metal alchemist, samurai champloo, chobets, black lagoon, blood+, bleach) and i have to say that this is one of the best i've ever seen, i've bought the whole series and if you like any sort of anime i reccomend that you check out this one. It's almost like a anime version of the young and the restless.  People falling in love with the wrong person, backstabbing friends, school drama, and blackmail. one of the best thought out series of all time and i only have one complaint: theres only 25 episodes, i think there should be more.",1216166400,2,655,4.32520325203252
8171207,5,B000MR9D2M,"Usually, I find myself agreeing with animation critic Charles Solomon's views but he's wrong about this one...I'm a twenty-four year old man and I find this series to be engaging, touching and funny all at the same time. It offers a realistic and likeable heroine, a horrible, scheming witch and a funny, mischievous young vagabond who actually cares but puts up a front of just being a skirt-chasing pervert. You'll enjoy it...take a chance on Peach Girl!",1195776000,6,456,4.935064935064935
8171208,5,B000MR9D2M,"Last year, I started reading the manga and quickly got hooked. Peach Girl has become one of my favorite series so I was estatic to find out that there was an anime for it and that it would be released here in the U.S. So impatiently (for months, lol), I waited for this DVD and I'm really happy with the way it turned out. The show stays really close to the manga too.",1183680000,,368,4.054794520547945
8171209,5,B000MR9D2M,"I'm not an ""anime"" girl or anything. I tolerate some animes thats as close to liking them as I get.  I wanted to get into one though and found it started to watch it and I'm hooked...I can't stop.  I think about it all the time lol.  Its cute, easy to get in to, fun, emotional, dramatic, and funny.  Its great.  I hope my husband will buy me this set, the bag is cute.

This anime especially is cute and would be suitable for preteens/teens. A lot of anime is sexual or violent...in this one thus far the most I have seen is fighting between girls which isn't very violent.  Also what I like is they make a big deal about kissing (treating it as serious as sex).  There is no sex really in it, at one point a guy busts in the gym and hugs a girl while shes wearing bra/panties and a towel but they make a big deal about that too

All in all I love this Anime and do highly recommend it!",1182384000,3,887,3.9943181818181817
8171210,4,B000MR9D2M,"Momo Adachi doesn't look like your typical Japanese high school girl. She has dark tanned skin and glowing red hair from years of swimming for school teams. She's developed sort've an inferiority complex since she thinks most guys find her skin color repulsive. She's felt this way since middle school when she fell in love with her friend Toji and was told by another girl that he didn't like dark-skinned girls. She never could work up the courage to ask him directly what he thought of her and they eventually went to different schools. Now, Momo is at a new school and so is Toji. And she still likes him. She doesn't really have any friends to confide in except Sae, a wicked backstabber who tries to copy everything Momo does, even liking the guys she likes. So when Sae asks her who she likes Momo just randomly picks a guy from the crowd named Kairi to throw her off the trail. This Kairi coencidentally enough, has a thing for Momo since she saved his life years ago. So now Momo has to fight off Kairi while making Sae think that's who she likes while not letting Toji misconstrue that her and Kairi are an item.

That's pretty much what the first volume of Peach Girl is about and from the looks of it, it's not going to get much deeper than this. Sae is the villain of the piece and you sense that she's going to try bigger and crazier plans to bring pain to Momo throughout the series. Sometimes the lies Sae tells seem a bit farfetched and it's hard to swallow that Toji would fall for it over and over again. But it's hard not to believe gossip about the one that you love. All it takes is one serpent to make you doubt the world. The thing that I did like about Peach Girl was that all the feelings between the characters were pretty much out in the open by the end of the first five episodes. A lot of shojo drags things out for a whole series, culminating with the get together of the two romantic leads. In this series, declaring love was the easy part. It's the aftermath of the declaration that Sae is trying to sabotage. Sae seems a little one dimensional because it hasn't been explained why she is the way she is. I doubt she does the things she does simply because she's evil. Hopefully, we'll get a little more background on not only her, but the other characters as well. At this point, they seem to exist in a vacuum. A nice start but the characterization could use some work.",1178409600,3,2404,4.342222222222222
