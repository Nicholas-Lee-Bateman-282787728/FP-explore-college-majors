3626453,3,B001H9813Q,"Several times throughout the film, audio of Gladys' speeches were included in the film.  This audio was of a very poor quality and difficult to understand.  Text should have been added to the movie during those times.  I would have preferred that she be presented more realistically and should not have been portrayed as an ""over the top"" saint as she was portrayed in the film  I would not recommend purchasing this film.",1420070400,,422,4.739726027397261

3626456,5,B001H9813Q,"Well illustrated, with lots of video and interviews of people who knew her or knew her life, and ESPECIALLY with cute recordings of Gladys herself telling her own stories! Not too long. Only suggestion to the producers would be to add subtitles to the audio of Gladys. Her accent and the quality of the recordings made some words difficult to understand. I would love to hear an interview from one of the children that went with her over the mountains during the war! But there is an interview from one of her adopted sons. A very moving and inspiring story! She simply went where God showed her to go and did what she must do. She felt that God wanted to send a man but he would not go, and then she later believed that God had sent a man to come and that would have been her husband but he also refused to go. But did she quit? No. And most men would not have accepted the grace to have courage to do the things she did. Though she never married, WELL over 100 children owe their lives to her. Also, I won't be a spoiler, but a powerful person also became a Christian through her influence.",1406246400,5,1092,4.2548076923076925
3626457,4,B001H9813Q,"Good overview, I was happy with the animation although I expected it might be too childlike it wasn't. The voice quality of Gladys's recordings was ok, understandable that it wasn't high quality segments of her voice, but it would have been helpful to have words printed on screen during her voice segments. It is a good supplement to the Ingrid Bergman movie which was quite good.",1405123200,,381,4.787878787878788

Unqualified is what she heard from the Mission Board!  But that didn't stop her from step by step following her LORD to her place abroad.

3626460,5,B001H9813Q,"Gladys came to realize at the age of 16 that the Savior Yahushua gave his life for her that she might have eternal life.
What more could she do but to give her life to Him? She was touched by the love of the Master and she obeyed His every command such as Matthew 16:24-25...

3626461,4,B001H9813Q,"Gladys Aylward was on our list of missionaries for this week and after researching that the Hollywood version was much too fictional, we opted for this documentary.  The clips of her voice (while great that it is really her voice) were sometimes difficult to understand so would have appreciated closed captioning for those portions.  Otherwise, the story is very well told and definitely humbles me to continue with that kind of focus and dedication towards God in my life.  Thanks for making this an affordable and quality option to supplement our schooling!",1390953600,,560,5.065217391304348
3626462,4,B001H9813Q,Although  bit dry but  it did reveal the true events as they actually happened to Ms. Gladys Aylward. Hollywood just had to add fictional events to carry off their version of her struggle. She was a modest woman with two goals: Spread the word of God and save the children.,1386979200,2,273,4.44

3626476,5,B001H9813Q,When you buy the DVD also buy the book. The two go hand in hand and compliment each other. As all DVD's do leave out things because of time is why I add get the book with the visual.  You will be glad you did.,1375660800,3,209,3.6444444444444444
3626477,4,B001H9813Q,"Having watched ""Inn of the Sixth Happiness"" which was a fictionalized account of Gladys Aylward's life, this documentary was primarily of interest to learn more of the true story.  Gladys Aylward, just as the title of the DVD indicates was a ""small woman with a great God"".  She believed God had called her to share the Good News of the Jesus Christ with the Chinese, and never wavered in answering that call.  The DVD covered her life quite well, with art work that might appeal more to children than adults.  I'm glad I saw the DVD, but related more to the book Gladys Aylward: The Little Woman by Gladys Aylward and Christine Hunter  than I did the DVD.",1366848000,2,656,4.52542372881356

3626479,5,B001H9813Q,"I will never understand why Hollywood Movie Makers are so intent on taking true stories and fictionalizing them until the heart of the story is lost.  How refreshing to find a documentary that tells the TRUE story of Gladys Aylward, complete with recordings of her own voice telling the story as it really happened.

The movie, THE INN OF THE SIXTH HAPPINESS is a fine movie if only it were fictional, but it isn't faithful to Gladys Aylward's true story.  This documentary is true and respectful; produced by people who understand who Miss Aylward was and the God who made her tick.  Well worth watching!",1358553600,8,605,4.733333333333333

3626481,5,B001H9813Q,"The story of Gladys Aylward is just amazing! To stike out in faith from England - a lone young woman with nothing but a small case with a few clothes and just a few Pounds in money - to travel across the European and Asian land mass by train, take a boat to Japan and then to China, facing the unknown - and then spend years working and sharing the Gospel to thousands who would never otherwise hear it ... it just blows my mind.
This tiny woman was truly one of the great women of history! Her story should be recounted over and over to show what God can do with one soul who completely trusts in Him!

The mix of voice clips, animation, Carol Purvis speaking, and traditional documentary narrative make this an interesting watch for all ages.  My husband overheard it and kept remarking what an amazing story this is. It is very true to the biography I recently read on her and hits on all of the main points, although my book went a little deeper into the dangers she faced and her experiences. We are homeschoolers, and the book was part of our curriculum. Running out of time and voice at the end of the year, I turned to this for our second grader today, and he was still discussing it after his baseball game tonight.  He specifically said he thought it was neat how they animated the various parts.  For a $1.99 rental, this hour and one minute long documentary is worth your time.  It speaks of her great faith and where it led her.  The story of Gladys Aylward is inspiring without a doubt!!",1463702400,5,981,4.6473988439306355

8308239,4,B001H9813Q,"This matter-of-fact biography about a very ordinary British woman who accomplished extraordinary things in China is worth reading. The real story of this amazing woman's life is so much more interesting and incredible than the Hollywood version in the movie ""Inn of the Sixth Happiness"" starring Ingrid Bergman.

Around 1930 Gladys Aylward felt called to do missionary work in China but was told that by her age (nearly 30) it was too difficult to learn the Chinese language. Unable to get sponsored by a missionary society and barely enough money for a train ticket, she set off on her own via the Trans-Siberian railway. Throughout the next 20 years in China she ran an Inn for traveling muleteers, adopted orphans, nursed wounded soldiers, quieted a prison riot, and endured Japanese air raids. But the extraordinary accomplishment for which she is most remembered tested her endurance to the point of death. Despite impossible odds, she managed to lead 100 war orphans over the mountains from Japanese-held territory to safety at an inland orphanage. She arrived deathly sick and exhausted but managed to survive after a long recovery. Unlike the movie, the book chronicles Gladys Aylward's subsequent work in China and beyond with more amazing accounts of her perseverence and God's providence.",1433980800,3,1299,5.185714285714286
