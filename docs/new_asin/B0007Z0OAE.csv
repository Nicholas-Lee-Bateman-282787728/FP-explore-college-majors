8054349,2,B0007Z0OAE,"I love old B movies, so I was really looking forward to this collection.  I was terribly disappointed by the technical quality of the reproduction, however.  The sound is so poor I often found it difficult to follow the dialogue, and the visuals are grainy and ugly.  Furthermore, I found the navigation system extremely primitive and difficult to use.  This ""bargain CD"" is really no bargain, although a few of the movies on here are real gems.",1192665600,4,445,4.740259740259741
8054350,3,B0007Z0OAE,"The DIVA 20 MOVIE PACK delivers the goods: Monroe, Collins, Mansfield, Gardner, LaMarr, Colbert, Stanwyck and more are here. Many ladies appear in supporting roles however, and there's one whose screen time is so brief, if you blink you might miss her entirely (Garbo). These mostly 'B' pics will undoubtedly be of interest to any fan of vintage movies.

Please note that MILL CREEK occasionally flashes their logo on screen for 15 second intervals.

8054351,4,B0007Z0OAE,"Diva Pack is mostly a marketing name, as the roles in many of the films don't fit the discription. With the DVD market becoming crowded with low cost collections of old films, one can now afford to be discriminating. This set is extremely varied in it content and mostly has films that don't show up repeatedly in other collections. Two that do are Love Affair (1939), the first one with Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne, found on many sets, and Too Late For Tears (1949), often included in low cost Film Noir collections.

Some other selections are just junk. The Fat Spy (1966) is a cheap imitation of a mid-sixties beach movie. Where those have a popular singer, bikini babes and a has-been comic, such as Don Rickles, as a buffoon representing the parents of the intended audience, this one has several such buffoons and centers most of the action on them. The singers are nobodies. Another loser is Oh Alfie! not really a remake or a sequel to the original Alfie movie but featuring the same sort of character. Home Town Story, available on many DVDs is really corporate promotion, not a theatrical release.

Most of the films, though, are quite interesting. Affair in Monte Carlo (1952) is odd in that it feels like something from the 1930s. Lady of Burlesque (1943) also seems to have the production values of a much earlier picture, but features Barbara Stanwyck in one of the tough roles she was good at. Film Noir is also represented by The Bigamist with Ida Lupino acting and directing. Indiscreet (1931), an early sound, pre-code film seems trite, aiming to tease and titillate the audience, I Cover the Waterfront (1933) also seems pre-code in its content and features a tough-guy newspaper reporter who falls in love with skinny dipping Claudette Colbert, playing the daughter of the smuggler he is investigating.

There are psychological stories: In Dishonored Lady (1947), Hedy Lamarr plays a magazine editor who is seeing a psychiatrist. Much less successful is Susan Hayward in Smash Up, a study of alcoholism that hardly seems like something people would pay to see.

The Joyless Steet (1925) is silent (the classical music soundtrack does not suit the film at all), and is Greta Garbo first feature role, directed by G.W. Pabst who also went on to greater things. There are many versions of this ranging from 94 minutes to 175 minutes. This is one of the chopped down ones, as part of the story is missing, leaving the parts that center around Garbo.

The films are not always in good condition, this is not a restoration. Also I found one defect on one of the disks in the set where it stuck and then skipped. As there is no scratch or blemish on the disk, it must be due to the quality of manufacturing.",1171411200,23,2722,4.69811320754717
