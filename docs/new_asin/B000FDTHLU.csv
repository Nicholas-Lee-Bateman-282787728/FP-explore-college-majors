8342339,5,B000FDTHLU,"These Eyewitness videos are really great!  We started out borrowing them from the library.  The kids liked them so much that they wanted to see others.  The library was limited on selection, so we decided to order them.  The whole family enjoys watching them.  Great for kids and adults who like facts about animals and nature.",1168300800,,327,4.767857142857143
