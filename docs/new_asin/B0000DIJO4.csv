8001197,3,B0000DIJO4,I really wish they would re-dub some of Bruce Liang's movies.  The fight choreography and slapstick humor on this is great and is on par with the best of any Jackie Chan movie.  But the dubbing is just too asinine to follow.  I would rather watch this in Chinese than in English!!,1170547200,2,280,4.346153846153846
