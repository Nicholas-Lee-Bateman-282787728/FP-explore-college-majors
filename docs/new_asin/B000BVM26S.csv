8093215,2,B000BVM26S,"Its just one of those movies I picked up for nostalgic reasons nothing more. I avoided the one being sold due to bad reviews on picture quality. Instead I picked up a region 2 german dvd release that has the best picture out there currently on dvd for the same price. This movie will NEVER be remastered or be given a special release so you got to deal with what you can get. I guess they just made this movie to capitalize on the rising zombie craze of the era with no money except the cost of film and bags of flour for the crop dust..Everyone probably worked for free and ate bread and pork and beans on set. Oh well,I have seen much worse.",1404172800,,643,4.152
8093216,1,B000BVM26S,"I saw this movie at the Drive-In when I was 14 years-old.  I remember having fun with my two friends sneaking into the drive-in in the trunk of my 15 year-old friend's car.  We were all having fun getting scared by the movie.  So now that I'm 47 years-old, I thought I'd reminisce about my childhood and see if the movie was still scary.  Wow, was I disappointed!  I would be more frightened by watching blood-suckers swim around in a fish bowl.  The acting is horrible.  The directing was even worse (by a fellow lawyer no less; That doesn't speak well for my profession!).  One scene never flowed from the previous scene, and the scenes which didn't involve the zombies were impossible to sit through.  Sadly, the zombies themselves didn't even act like zombies.  They were more like street people who were poorly paid (probably only given a free meal) to participate in a movie.",1352937600,2,881,4.625806451612903
8093217,1,B000BVM26S,"Well it wouldn't be a zombie film a bit of gore and cheesy comments but this one takes the cake on music steals, bad dubbing, and yes even sound effects' timing is off.  So grab your bug out bag, machete and solid rifle.  This is Toxic Zombies.

Spoilers can only be destroyed if you get the brain.

Charles McCrann is our writer/director/lead actor brings us the depths of this utter hell that this film is.  Violence with no real explanation nor any real attempt at character development and all back stories consists of people babbling about events we have not seen or these people should not yet have knowledge of.  Citizen Kane this is not.  Hell I wouldn't even give it Citizen Toxie.  With a cast of no one I could recognize other than John Amplas (of Martin, Day of the Dead, Creepshow and No Pets) and he is not even a lead part.  He remains in the shadows of obscurity.  To start us on this journey; pot growers are using government land to score 2 million big ones in grass and have no qualms about killing officials to keep their crops.  We open this film up with what I thought was two hunters with rifles.  I mean commonly you see two guys decked out in flannel and hiking boots you would come to that conclusion too.  Cut to a topless bathing scene?  Well of course there's one.  We are two minutes and forty seconds into this flick we got to keep the male audience or their attention span might wander.  So we get spliced cut shots of hunters and back to topless sudsy goodness.  After a quick dress she is informed the two hairballs with rifles are federal officers, she tries to bail and they shot her in the back...well the back of the neck according to her cheesy flesh wound.

 No sooner have these crack officials realized they shoot a woman, that by the way was their only concern.  Not that they just shot an unarmed person but the fact she happened to be female.  Stay classy, movie.  Two hippies do in the officials and the frigging knifing sound effect is about a second and a half off from the strikes.
Yeah this is not exactly quality entertainment.  Establishing from Commander Exposition and Junior Plot Point two other officials realize the only way to tend to this problem is to release an untested chemical on the government land and thus destroying the pot.  With the help of a drunken sot of a pilot the chemicals are released and the hippies turn more yellow than a colony of vegans.  Suddenly more violent tendencies are occurring in the hippies and they proceed to do away with anyone that is not as messed up as they.
Our hero/writer/director acts his way into the paper bag and cannot leave there as he and his wife's passionate lovemaking turns night to day and vice versa with fade scenes.  Random campers and their children are not safe in these insane making woods as they are laid siege upon.

Now let us step back and observe for a second.  These zombie like folk are wielding hand weapons, rocks and even mastered fire for torches again and all without the aid of Dr. Rickles from Day of the Dead teaching them, so not exactly certain how to describe this lot, other than all messed up.  Most of the music for this flick has been lifted from Day of the Dead, a sped up version of Halloween, Dawn of the Dead and a mutilated version of Jaws as well.  I am not certain but I can manage some disgruntlement.  Go enjoy your evening outside or sit in with a book.",1346198400,,3406,4.418940609951846
8093218,2,B000BVM26S,"I'm totally happy to have this rarity on DVD, especially since my original VHS of it is worn out beyond belief.  But it is certainly NOT worth the price that Amazon is charging for it.  For starters, the movie is culled from a VHS source, and a poor VHS source at that.  The print is fuzzy and almost out of focus, sound quality goes up and down.  Even the artwork is shoddy.  The special features are screen grabs from the movie.  Why?  I don't know.

Like I said, this is a low budget, 16mm zombie feature with lousy direction and even lousier acting...but it's always been a favorite of mine...but just know what you are getting.",1304553600,11,632,4.387931034482759
8093219,3,B000BVM26S,"From [...] review:

""To start with, [Toxic Zombies] is not a 'cash cow,' nor was this [Chuck McCrann's]...first foray into a larger film career. McCrann was a lawyer, a graduate from both Princeton University and the Yale School of Law, which is impressive to anyone except a Harvard Man (which I'm not... but LSU isn't a bad school either, man). He was also a Senior VP for a legal firm important enough to have offices in the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center. Unfortunately, Charles McCrann did indeed show up for work on September 11, 2001, which is why he's no longer with us.""

I didn't know this - did anyone else?

Thanks, [...]",1248566400,3,640,4.547826086956522
8093220,1,B000BVM26S,"I HAVE MANY ZOMBIE MOVIES IN MY COLLECTION... YES ZOMBIE LAKE AND OASIS OF THE ZOMBIES WAS HORRIBLE AND WHEN I SAW THEM I THOUGHT ID NEVER SEE ANYTHING WORSE. WELL HERE IT IS... TOXIC ZOMBIES... I WOULDNT PICK THIS UP IF I SAW IT LAYING ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD STILL SHRINK WRAPPED. I PAID $16 FOR THIS TO ADD IT TO MY ZOMBIE COLLECTION. I GUESS I PAID THAT JUST TO SAY I HAVE THIS MOVIE. IT IS SO HORRIBLE, I ABSOLUTELY CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW ANYONE IN THEIR RIGHT MIND CAN SAY THAT THIS WAS ANYTHING BUT A PIECE OF TRASH. THE DIRECTOR MUST HAVE BEEN SPRAYED WITH THOSE TOXINS HIMSELF WHEN HE SHOT THIS... AVOID THIS MOVIE, IT IS TERRIBLE. WORSE THAN ZOMBIE LAKE.",1247702400,4,663,4.1875
8093221,3,B000BVM26S,"This is one of those cheesy classics from the 70's.  I enjoyed it somewhat.
Basically to sum it up...A group of people growing dope get dusted with a chemical meant to kill their crop.  They turn into flesh eating zombies and try to kill campers in the same area.
It was alright, it didn't take too long to get to the juicy parts.  Although, in my opinion it is NOT worth the Amazon price of 21.00. I'd  probably pick it up for 5.00 maximum.",1204070400,7,441,4.214285714285714
