6140249,3,B00H8KC1OS,"I love SATC, I have had the individual seasons for years. I was so excited when I saw they had an updated box set with both movies. The box set is beautiful.. pictures and everything. It's also a very portable.. great if you want to take the whole series with you on vacation or over to a guest's house. My only problem; the episode guides inside and picture quotes are LOADED with typos. Literally every 3 pages you can find one. For example, Season 2. Episode 1 is titled ""Take Me To The Ball Game"" but in the episode guide it says  ""Take Me To The Sall Game"".. also on the picture of the girls in Abu Dhabi it says ""Four friends embark on the trip of a lifetie""... did anyone else notice this? It slightly downs the set for me, it is beautiful.. but the spelling mistakes are so careless!",1296691200,26,791,4.23841059602649
6140250,5,B00H8KC1OS,I love SATC and have been wanting a complete set and this is just right!  It includes both movies as well as all 6 seasons plus extras.  They layout and design of the boxed set in AMAZING!  I'm am so thrilled to have it.  I ordered this for my sister as well as she is a fan.  You will be thrilled with this purchase!!,1296172800,2,318,3.90625
6140251,3,B00H8KC1OS,"I am the proud owner of SATC's individual seasons from years back, watched many times over by myself and passed around to my daughters. I was extremely excited to get this beautiful new series this past Christmas. The packaging is just that, beautiful! Season 1, disc 1, perfect. Season 1, disc 2 episodes 7-12, not so much! Not only would it not start at the beginning of the first episode, I didn't have sound. No matter what I tried, this disc wasn't going to play.

I believe the real issue is the cardboard inserts for the disc's. They hold them so tightly, you have to toggle them back and forth to carefully pull them out. I had the same issue with the ""Lost"" series and sent that series back twice to Amazon! I really don't want to go through the same frustration again with SATC, so I decided to take that particular disc and exchange it with the disc from my very first individually acquired set. I just hope, going forward, that I'm not put in the same position of having to switch them out again.

And by the way, the 3 star rating has nothing to do with Amazon. They were amazing to deal with when I had the ""Lost"" issue! YAY, for Amazon :)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sex-the-City-Complete-Collection-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B003Z8ZCG6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sex & the City: Complete Collection (Deluxe Edition)</a>",1294617600,73,1374,5.075221238938053
6140252,4,B00H8KC1OS,"I bought this for my fiance, she loves it.  It contains the series and the 2 movies in a classy photo album style with nice pictures and descriptions.",1294617600,,150,4.357142857142857
6140253,4,B00H8KC1OS,"I purchased this awhile now and although I had to break the bank to pay for it, it's still worth it.  You have to be a fan to want it that badly.  Whenever I feel lonely or depressed or the girls come over and want to watch chick flicks- I always have a good laugh! now only if I could get the man to watch with me he might learn something or two about women.  You have to be a fan to relate.",1294358400,13,392,3.6987951807228914
6140254,4,B00H8KC1OS,"I do have to quickly mention I agree with the 1 star review about the quality. I have so far watched the first full season and the quality is not very good. I would have thought they would have digitally re mastered the earlier episodes but they did not. They deff look 10+ years old and fuzzy. So I was a little disappointed they were not re mastered for better quality esp for the hefty price tag. With that said....

  I got this set for Christmas. I had single versions of every season years ago and they were ruined over time. When I found this set I was so excited because both the new movies were included. This set is beautiful. Whoever deigned this set gets two thumbs up from me. Inside is so well constructed and beautifully put together. The way the DVD's are housed as well is so smart and organized. It resembles a high end quality book with velvet lining!! Please don't think twice to buy this set if you are a true Sex and The City fan like me. I am going to treasure this set for years to come. Even my husband could not stop raving about how well designed the set was. It is truly beautiful and worth every penny.",1293408000,7,1131,4.226851851851852
6140255,4,B00H8KC1OS,"There is not much more to be said about the collection than the item description. It is everything! The packaging is beautiful- velvety suede inside, gorgeous pictures, quotes laying over them... but the discs are in the most impossible place! They are TUCKED snuggly into the pages and you have to tug them free! Once dislodged, there are hand smudges from your effort. Other than that, its beautiful. I just thought, if you go through the trouble of designing this sophisticated package, why not design a functional disc holder?",1292630400,142,530,4.966292134831461
6140256,1,B00H8KC1OS,This disks for the first three seasons are very poor.  Save your money!!  These look as though they were made from a video from a theater seat!  I have not looked at season 4 yet.  I hope the quality improves.  I paid $130 at Costco.,1290643200,26,233,4.088888888888889
6140257,5,B00H8KC1OS,"If your a fan of ""Sex and the City"" this is the ultimate collector's item. Here you get the entire series in its entirety, everything from the series' episodes (all 94 shows) to the two feature-length films, plus a great bonus DVD that contain an array of extras that you will enjoy over and over.

 Very few cable shows have ever experienced the kind of success that ""Sex and the City"" had. Viewers were entranced every week as Carrie and her three best friends, Samantha, Charlotte, and Miranda, led very busy lives in New York City. All four ladies had great jobs and active sex lives, something the women were not ashamed of. These characters epitomized what life was like for single women in America in the late '90's and early 2000's, and what made the show so appealing was the fact that these women loved each other and were always there for one another. Their family was a ""family of choice"" and no one could break that bond.

 In 2008 ""Sex and the City"" hit the big screen for the first time in ""Sex and the City-The Movie"" where it became an instant boxoffice smash. It was no surprise that there was an immediate sequel called ""Sex and the City 2"", but unfortunately due to a mediocre script and the girls not being situated in New York, the film was a commercial flop. Still, it's nice to see both films offered in this new box-set that collector's will enjoy for posterity.

 The bonuses that accompany this set includes interviews with the cast, audio commentaries, deleted scenes, ""next-episode"" previews, and more. The subtitles are in English, French, and Spanish and the episodes are presented in the original full-screen format, the way they were orignally broadcast.",1282348800,76,1687,4.7016949152542376
6140258,5,B00H8KC1OS,"Excellent.  This movie have a beautiful cover and box,  It is in English, French and Spanish language and subtitle.  Very nice price and it original Complete Collection.  Don't scratches and see perfect.",1517270400,,203,5.25
6140259,5,B00H8KC1OS,DVDs arrived in perfect condition. I was a little nervous buying this set. I heard a while back that these box sets just had the DVDs in envelopes instead of secured in the typical DVD/CD plastic place holder. No envelopes though.,1516060800,,230,4.634146341463414
6140260,5,B00H8KC1OS,Good set!,1515888000,,9,4.0
6140261,1,B00H8KC1OS,"I saw other reviews that stated that some of the episodes ""skipped"" but I went ahead and bought this hoping I'd get lucky.  Unfortunately I did not.  On the very first disk, in the middle of episode 4, suddenly my display went haywire with staticy blinking and even hitting the Home Menu button didn't help.  I had to completely power off my DVD player to get it to stop.

Resolution is low and grainy, no better than back when it first aired on TV.  But the real problem is that apparently the disks are just low quality with errors that cause skipping.  Waste of money if you can't even watch all the episodes.",1515542400,,612,4.371681415929204

Anyways, I noticed some of the reviews said ""the video quality is bad"", that's just how it is. If you've seen the series recently on HBO you'll notice the video quality is the same.

6140319,5,B00H8KC1OS,"I'm giving this 5 stars so this review goes to the top of the list because I, like you, careful buyer, read reviews religiously before breaking out the credit card. If you are still interested, please continue reading: this product should be 0 stars. Yes, that's ZERO. This is NOT the white, updated collector's edition that every other 5 star review is raving about. This is a simple, boxed set of DVDs with quality so poor, they appear to have been copied from home recorded VHS tapes. There is nothing ""collector's"" about this set. As I post-purchasedly looked deeper into the reviews and history of the Sex And The City sets, it appears that the original HBO-produced quality has never been great. These disks, however, are unwatchable. So, in finding out that the original pink collector's set and the REAL, updated white collector's set are both expensive and hard to come by, I returned this set in favor of the digital downloads. Because, Sex And The City, the series, DOES deserve 5 stars, and I've seen every episode on Netflix and cable so many times that I believe I've earned the ""mobile"" version :-)  Best wishes, and I hope you enjoy Sex And The City in whatever format works for you!",1477440000,8,1199,4.682464454976303

I am a huge, huge, huge Buffy The Vampire Slayer fan and Sex and the City fan. This complete series of the Sex and the City is perfect. Now I can watch them whenever I want. The disk sleeves are a little hard to get out of the beautiful box at first but I just wiggle it a little and it comes right out.

She was so in love with the clothes and the city of New York. She had little dreams of moving off and becoming part of Carrie's friendship group. She wondered what it would be like to live in a big city and be rattled with indecision on a daily basis. It didn't take long before she realized she wanted no part of such a life as these women led.

What she did want was this collection of movies, and she was happy to get them for Christmas.",1454716800,,588,4.157894736842105

6140379,5,B00H8KC1OS,Gave it a 5 because I love Sex and the City and the collection deserved a 5: I will say that it did not come in the nice velvet packaging it says it comes in in the item description when I placed the order. It was just the white box. Not really something extremely big to complain about but just to put it out there. Otherwise it was great and well worth the $50 I spent. Great deal!!!

6140383,5,B00H8KC1OS,"I bought this set back in september to replace an old set that got damaged in storage. The original set I had was made out of the original dvd releases of the seasons so it had all the original features that those dvds included such as music and the original introduction with the twin towers in it as sarah jessica parker's background during the opening credits which was changed after 9/11 and remained that way until the end of the show's original run on tv. Knowing this, when I purchased this set I thought all those original features would be lost since this was manufactured years later but I was pleasently surprised to see everything remained the same except for the menu in each disc since it had a different format than the original which I guess was done to match the tittle and logo that was featured in the movies (pink and sparkly everything, really girly). Do I miss those original pictures? Sort of, they reminded me of how the cast looked like thru the years and it was fun to see how they changed but the picture quality is excellent so that makes up for the loss.

Although the entire series is available on HBOGO as well as on demand through our cable provider, this set is an excellent addition to the home library.  The packaging is very attractive.  The white portfolio that holds the disc looks great on the shelves of our entertainment center.  The interior design of the set is also very nice with semi-transparent pages between the disc pages filled with quotes from the show.  All the seasons are there as well as the first movie.  It was created before the second movie came out so it is not included, although my GF was fine with this because in her opinion, ""the second movie sucks anyway.""  The special features are a little bare from what I noticed but my GF has gotten a lot of mileage from this set and it has been complimented from her friends when the come over.

When this drama first on tv, I was just in middle school, now in the mid-20s want to give it a try watching it (usually watched medical drama such as House M.D. and Grey's Anatomy and crime/detective drama). I usually buy it when its complete season unless really addicted to the drama. This is listed in my drama wishlist. Somehow, by chance, I saw it on deal of the day and made the purchased... hope its good and worth it even there was a big saving.",1442966400,2,666,4.414634146341464

6140443,5,B00H8KC1OS,"Needed to badly catch up on the world of modern series - and have been enjoying this box set being (honestly) unaware of the program. I really enjoy the bold approach to entertainment and although I acknowledge this is not for everyone due to the explicit sexual content, but I find it quite entertaining and sociological exploratory.

Decide if you are very liberal with casual humour - and if you decide you are - you may just love this.",1440633600,,439,4.556962025316456

6140454,5,B00H8KC1OS,As always Sex and the City is interesting.  I bought the complete series which includes 17 discs.  Some where I read that all of the discs were jammed together inside the box.

The first few seasons are a little grainy, but when I put them in my blu ray player which then upgraded the picture quality, they were fine.

However, my wife said it is not bad enough to return. Perhaps we just received a bad copy that is unique to a handful of videos.

I was actually wanting the book, which I found out it wasn't what I had ordered when I received it. The $99 collection is only the boxed set. Each season is in an individual box and must say it is a bit overpriced. Especially when you could buy each season for $7.99 - 9.99. I've attached the pictures of what the box set looks like, so if you are looking for the book as shown in the Amazon pictures compared to the pink book make sure you click on the drop down menu where it says more options and the book is actually $159.",1419811200,4,614,4.082644628099174

All of the customer images are for previous versions, and you'll be disappointed if you're expecting them. These are strictly the individual seasons, in new plastic cases (the same ones found in stores for $10 a season). No lush packaging, no movies, etc. If you strictly want the entire series at a low price, this is it.

The white set that says ""Sex and the City"" the complete series is just that, it's all of the disks for the TV series, but does not contain the movies, it is in NO SPECIAL box or container, it is in simple plain disk holders like any other DVD that you buy.  It is fine for me, I just want the set and really don't care to have a special package.  I did end up purchasing the movies though.  I am a little peeved though as Target had all of the disks much cheaper than this on Black Friday and I didn't get them because I thought this included everything and was something special.",1417564800,7,774,4.072368421052632

But I'm a huge fan and once I received it I knew I made a great investment since I can watch this episodes in repeat... My personal opinion this box is beautiful, Going through my 20's when this first air it brought me back so many great memories...

Yes the DVD are really ticked in secured but if it wasn't they would be all over the place so for me it's all great and more than I expected... If you are a fan of this  series you never missed a single episode when it originally aired on HbO  like me, then you MUST have this!!!",1408492800,,629,4.016
6140611,5,B00H8KC1OS,"What is a bit ""disturbing"" is the quality of the series DVD's (18 out of 20 DVD's). . As soon as the actual sequence starts, the picture gets a bit fuzzy. It's as if a very, very thin, light, dotted filter is on the screen. Especially in the background of the scenes. And trust me: It has nothing to do with my equipment. My equipment is state of the art. It's the quality of the DVD's. The additional two movie DVD's (Sex & the City 1 and 2) are perfect! So, the problem clearly has to do with the quality of the recording/making of the original six seasons.  I cannot imagine that in today's times, there is no technology available to ensure that any new DVD is in perfect condition. A big disappointment! If it wouldn't cost me a small fortune to return the ""complete collection"", I would.",1407974400,,792,4.351351351351352

This collection however sucks due to the packaging. You can EASILY scratch your DVD's and when it arrived the box was scratched up and smashed (the actual DVD packaging, not my shipment box). That was pretty disappointing considering it was a gift for her.",1406592000,,332,4.354838709677419

6140616,2,B00H8KC1OS,"I gave it 2 stars because I love Sex in the City, BUT, this box set was a disappointment for the money.  The seasons were fine, but the movie (1st one) had been cut up, at least 3 good scenes were missing, and several scenes through out edited, why do they do that to dvd's?  It's not like they're trying to cut it up to fit a time slot on tv for pete's sake!!  So disappointed again because of the expensive  price of 179.00 you'd think they could give you the whole movie!",1406332800,,474,4.064516129032258

6140621,1,B00H8KC1OS,"This ""complete"" SATC is not worth bothering with. I read some of the reviews but somewhat foolishly hoped I'd get a set that was okay. No! I think until they change the packaging format everyone is doomed to receive damaged DVDs. Anytime DVDs are stuffed into cardboard slots where they are near impossible to extract...scratches and ruined DVDs will be the norm. I managed to extract the first two discs with much difficulty and saw a multitude of scratches and sure enough the skipped, froze up and refused to play. I returned these and just ordered each season individually. Sure they are displayed in the cheap individual plastic DVD cases but that is far better than a single set stuffed into cardboard slots where, if they are not already ruined, will surely not last several times pulling in and out to play. DO NOT purchase this set!!",1405728000,3,842,4.73469387755102

But they could have tried to clean up the picture and made it a little sharper. There were really not extra features to speak of. No bloopers, unless I missed them. No extended episodes you didn't get to see on HBO.  I bought the box set of friends and got a lot more for less money.

After a much anticipated waiting period, I finally broke down and bought the boxed set and I'm so happy to have it.

6140638,5,B00H8KC1OS,Another favorite show of mine.  Have been wanting the series but the price was always too high for my pocket.  This was a more affordable price.,1397692800,,144,4.5
6140639,4,B00H8KC1OS,Arrived sooner (about a week) than it was stated. Says the 21st was original date. case it came in was damaged from what looks like it was bound cause of the creases on all four sides. Disks are tough to get out of sleeves but I'm sure that'll ease as time goes on. Other than that it's great.,1397347200,,293,4.068965517241379
6140640,5,B00H8KC1OS,"This was my I'm-Getting-Divorced-So-I-Need-Some-Comfort treat.  I watched the entire series via dvd (and some vhs) years ago, and have re-watched many of the sanitized episodes on E!.  Yes, I can quote from scenes and I have favorite lines.  And at this point, I don't sit down and watch.  But it's great background on my tv as I work around the house (Confession:  One of the Season 3 disks is playing right now).  These ladies still make me laugh.  A lot.  It was a smart, witty, and brilliant series then and now.  I'm so glad I invested the money in this set.",1397001600,,563,4.4950495049504955

6140643,5,B00H8KC1OS,"I love this case.  The videos are nestled within the ""pages"" inside, amongst photographs and quotes of the characters.  Also... A bonus disk!!

Worth the cost.  A great gift for any Sex and the City fan.  :-)",1395446400,,208,4.513513513513513
6140644,5,B00H8KC1OS,This is an excellent collection for a weekend with the girls. For anyone who has not seen the series it is About four woman in New York and the adventures of being sexually single. The woman are from four different lifestyles sexually. Fun to watch but not for the sexually timid.,1395360000,,280,4.509803921568627
6140645,3,B00H8KC1OS,It's very pretty but it isn't easy to get discs in and out. The way the case is if your not careful you will scratch the discs sliding them in and out.,1394928000,,151,3.75
6140646,5,B00H8KC1OS,"The SATC series has changed my life.  I'm not just saying that.  I reference it so many times.  There are special quotes that I reference all the time. I often make new friend just by their ability to pin point where the phrase ""Abso-f*cking-lutely"" comes from.  It may seem trivial but I grew up on this series, probably shouldn't have b/c it is highly inappropriate for a child...but oh well.

This collection has it all.  All 6 seasons and both movies.  I found it completely reasonably priced and the packaging is beautiful.  I think it's a suede type fabric on the inside.  I will say that the DVD's are pretty difficult to remove, but that is a tiny inconvenience.  The box is covered in quotes from the series.  If you are a single gal this series is a must see.

If you haven't seen the show:
The first season is a little sketchy but I promise you that it gets better.  SJP does this weird thing where she talks to the camera, that stops by season two, actually I think it stops before the end of season one. You will go along a life journey with four single gals living in New York. Carrie, who is our leading lady, is a writer.  The series is based off of articles that she writes about her and her friends lives.  Charlotte works in art galleries in the beginning. She is the idealist and the dreamer that desperately wants to fall in love and be married.  Miranda is a ball busting lawyer. A complete workaholic.  She is pretty bad*ss though.  She is a no nonsense kinda gal.  Then there is Samantha, the publicist.  She is the sex crazed, act like a lady and think like a man kinda woman.  Except she doesn't really act to much like a lady sometimes. She loves sex and she isn't ashamed or afraid to let the world know.  These women have known each other for years.  If you read the books you learn more of the back story, which really isn't that important to the series.  There are a few significant lovers in each of their lives but I won't tell you to much about them out of fear of ruining it for you. I will let you know this, everyones story ends perfectly for their character.

This series is a great conversation starter.  The things you fear happening on a date, on the first overnight visit, whatever you can think of, it happens on this show.  It will make you a stronger woman I promise.",1394841600,2,2312,4.328671328671328
6140647,5,B00H8KC1OS,"I got this Box Set for Christmas and I was over joyed. I had been eying the old Pink box set for years but could never justify spending that much money for only 6 seasons well I am so pleased I waited and got this as a gift instead. It is much prettier than the previous pink versions. It's a classy and elegant White Box with the Manhattan Skyline mosiac made out of titles. The inside is a gorgeous grey velvet with Silver script.

The box set contains all six seasons with bonus material and both movies. It also contains breath taking pictures of the girls during each season. If you are a Sex and the City junkie this is the box set for you. You will not be disappointed I promise you that!

The only negative comment I have for this set is:

The dvds are a bit hard to get out of there slots. I found you have to just pull hard to get them out, don't dry to wiggle it or slip your fingers into it that won't work. You also need to push really hard to get the disc back in. It was really annoying when I first noticed this I didn't want to damage my box set but I wanted that darn dvd out pronto to watch. After carefully experimenting I finally found a way to just pull hard on the disc in a straight line and push just as hard to put back. Not sure if anyone else has that problem but I sure did. Oh well I figured out the technique crisis averted.",1394496000,2,1355,4.011111111111111

They can tell each most everything, even if it is mostly about SEX.  They enjoy  each others company.  I worry about all the sex with every man they met.  Is this safe sex?  That is why it is just a show.  The actors are good.  I think that is why the show was such a success.  Of course you have to give the writers some of the credit.  Ha! Ha!",1393200000,,499,3.88

I appreciate that there are lots of extras as well as both movies included (we won't discuss the quality of the second movie!). While I adore the white case and the pictures and look of the set inside, trying to get the discs out of the sleeve can be ridiculously hard. That's what stops me from giving a 5 star. I still highly recommend purchasing this if you're looking to own the set.",1391644800,,507,4.237113402061856
6140659,3,B00H8KC1OS,"What a gorgeous box set.  I love the Sex and the City girls and couldn't wait to receive this box set.  Got it, opened it and it is beautiful.  However, the DVDS are so tightly packaged that as soon as you pull them out of the way too tight sleeve, they get scratched (unless of course they just came this way, this is just what I am assuming happened.)  Watched the first DVD totally skipped and had to stop it.  Watched the movie...same thing.  I am returning and replacing this item.  I will rereview this when I receive it.  My best advice, is to break the sleeve open gently, and just retape it when done.  So I guess I will have to ruin the beautiful package this time, but hopefully that will result in me being able to watch my girls without continuous skipping and missing scenes.",1391558400,,789,4.312925170068027

There are a good amount of episodes where it's very pixel-ly and at some points got on my nerves.  It looked worse then a VHS tape.  The sounds is good and none of the DVDs locked up or anything.  Overall, good purchase.",1390780800,,379,3.973333333333333

I have to say this is one of the best investments I could make for a show that I could watch over and over again. I love the case, very sleek and sturdy. Absolutely LOVE the inserts and pages as they reflect the whole series. The only negative thing about this is that the pockets that contain the DVD's are very tight.

It came in great shape, but as with many other reviews, the DVD's are definitely set in pretty hard.  My wife began watching them and had no issues with the quality of the DVD's, so I would say this is a great buy.  Its counterpart you can find at Best Buy, I saw it was going for around $200 there.

Yes, the discs are snapped into the slots in the pages, but a twist as you pull them out does the trick. The commentaries by Michael Patrick King are hugely informative and fun.

As others have stated the discs are REALLY TIGHT in their cardboard sleeves. I use a micro cloth for removing them without getting fingerprints on the discs. Then I bought a 'Computer Expressions 55331 Metal CD Wallet Sweetheart' from Amazon to hold this favorite series and protect it. The disc holders in this wallet are round rather than square like the CaseLogic type. This requires just a bit more finesse to remove and replace discs, but totally worth it to me since the beautiful promo collection holder is lovely but takes up a lot of room, is heavy, and getting the discs in and out is a project unto itself.",1387065600,,753,4.5036496350364965

6140706,4,B00H8KC1OS,"Was in love with the television series on HBO.  I had bought the original season collection in the pink suede years ago, when it first came out, but since I lost in, in a friendship battle, I needed to replace it.  Glad I replaced it with this one.  This collection even includes both movies, which is more than the original collection I had.  The only I have with this product, is the CD insert pockets.  Too tightly made and you have to tug and tug on the DVD's to come out.  I read that complaint by others as well, but I still bought it to have the collection.  It's either buying them individually and spending more money, or getting the bulk deal which is better.  I bought it on a Black Friday weekend, so I got it for a steal of a price; can't beat it!",1386633600,,760,4.157534246575342

Then, I put in the first disc, seaon 1, disc one, and the intro plays, the menu appears, but it will not play the episodes!. Ok, maybe its just a fluke. Then, same issue with season 2 disc 3! This is going back. I am so disappointed.",1385942400,6,310,3.859375
6140710,4,B00H8KC1OS,"This is a beautiful set for SATC lovers! The case is really beautiful and sturdy and I love all of the pictures and quotes throughout the set. It looks to be of very high quality. My biggest complaint, however, is how difficult it is to get the discs out of their cases. It's great that they don't fall out, but the sleeves are so tight that I'm afraid to break the discs or get fingerprints all over. The best way I've found to remove them is to press the disc between the middle of my thumb and the meatier side of my forefinger (below the knuckle), wiggle the discs left and right and pull hard.

So far, I've only watched the discs for the first 3 seasons, but I found that the video quality for Season 1 was not as sharp as the rest. This may be due to the fact that Season 1 was filmed with 16 mm film and later seasons were filmed with 35 mm (according to Wikipedia) or it could be the discs. I'm not entirely sure, but it's not a deal breaker for me.

Overall, it's a great collector's set!",1385856000,,998,4.112820512820512

The package from the outside and inside look great and original but the dvd's are very low quality .  It looks like someone had replaced the original dvd's with copies made elsewhere .  I assure you these dvd's are not digitally enhanced .  They are very grainy as though someone transferred them from an old vhs tape to vinyl disk .  I have tried three different dvd recorders and televisions and the picture quality is still the same .  Your welcome to take your chance on buying this collection but I would think twice .

The pages are nice and thick, very hard to bend (a good thing), and the print quality is very nice.  There are also vellum overlay pages every now and then.

6140776,1,B00H8KC1OS,"Okay, first off, this is going to read like a trolling review, but it isn't. Because while I am rating this produce very low, I am stipulating to the fact that the video, discs, and what most people would regard as ""the most important qualities"" of a DVD series may, in fact be fine or even fantastic. lol In truth, I don't know, because at this point I flat out refuse to so much as open the box and break the cellophane seal, otherwise I will be stuck with this and won't be able to return it to Amazon, as I intend to.

Also, please understand that this review is NOT a review of the series, which I believe is a top notch series. I want to state right off, in no uncertain terms, that this review is only going to encompass the exterior presentation, because, quite honestly, I have NO IDEA where to even put this set if I were to open it. So if you want to know about the quality of the discs, the show itself, the bonus features, and the things that MOST PEOPLE would concentrate on in a review, then do not, under any circumstances, take this review seriously or allow me to dissuade you from purchasing it, because my only intent is to alert other people who, like myself, have their DVD shelves oriented a certain way and who have very limited space because, like me, they have a ton of DVD movies and seasons.

Not to put too fine a point on it, every single solitary season series I have ever ordered can be stored on your DVD shelves like books on a bookshelf. Seriously, this is a great space saver and not only DVD manufacturers do it this way, but so do publishers of videogames as well as CD's and software. At least in my opinion, you are supposed to be able to store them on a shelf in such a way that the space taken up is optimized to allow for as many DVD's and TV show seasons as the shelves are meant to hold. The first thing I noticed about this series set is that instead of the discs being oriented to allow book-like placement on a DVD shelf or in a case, which is to say that the DVD's are perpendicular to the wall the shelves are on or against, this set has the DVD's parallel. What this means is that instead of utilizing the depth of the shelf like, oh I don't know...every other DVD manufacturer in the civilized world does, these discs are oriented so that the surfaces are parallel to the wall they are against. In English, this means that instead of efficiently using the depth of your shelf or cabinet (which would save you shelf space from left to right) this box set is stored in a very shallow (front to back) package that takes up too little space in depth and way too much space in width!

Now again, if this is a scenario that works for you, and it may, then PLEASE, by all means disregard this review as it will be wholly irrelevant to you. But if you are like me and you have limited shelf space, then you will have two choices with this set: Either find a way to make room for it, even though it is very inefficiently laid out to take up too much of your shelf space from left to right, or send it back. Actually, maybe there is a third choice I will get to in a second.

Personally, unless I can figure something out before I open the set, I am sending this one back unopened to Amazon for a refund!

Again, this is NOT an attack of the product in any way. Nor am I trying to dissuade people from buying it. But considering there are only 94 episodes in six seasons + two movies, this box set, in my honest opinion, should take up less than a third of the ""left to right"" space that it does.

Another possible solution for those of you who are huge fans of the series but find the storage orientation of this set to be space-prohibitive might be to go out to Radio Shack or some other company that sells more standard DVD cases. Maybe you can even buy cases that hold multiple DVD's and inserts so you can create your own Sex & the City box set storage cases. I may, in fact, do that, but the problem for me is that I only ordered this because it was on sale in Amazon's Gold Box Special for $74.99 the other day. I am not a huge fan, but what little I have seen of the show on HBO, I really liked.

If this was, say Star Trek, The West Wing, or another series I am a huge fan of, I would absolutely hunker down and create a better box set storage for it. I am just not sure I want to go out and buy generic DVD cases and transplant the discs from this very oddball storage unit into those. Part of the reason is that stuff like that looks kind of ghetto, in my opinion. lol

So again, if you have read this far and are rolling your eyes at this review, I will confess I probably won't blame you, but remember that I stated from the outset what that this review is about and the limitations I admittedly endowed it with. Because undoubtedly, my concern in this regard is NOT going to be something everyone will agree with. And if so, then as I said, you should absolutely disregard this review.

If, however, you are like me, and your DVD storage space is at a premium, this is absolutely an issue you should think about. It may be that the set will still work for you, but I simply want people to be aware of what I personally find objectionable about the way the set is packaged. And I also want people to understand that this is the ONLY criteria I am basing my review on, which I completely understand narrows the usefulness of this review quite substantially!

***Edit: I wanted to edit this review to add a link to an Amazon seller who is selling a five-pack of DVD cases, each of which holds six DVD's. Since there are twenty DVD's in the set, presumably two for the movies and about three per season, you can store the ENTIRE series on a DVD shelf and probably take up a small fraction of the shelf width that the series in its original packaging will require. If I keep this set, this is the route I intend to go, whether these cases or similar ones. Here is the link, but in case Amazon rejects a link in a review, you can just do an Amazon search for ""Americopy 5 pack 6 Disc DVD Case"" or just ""Multi disc DVD cases.""

6140789,5,B00H8KC1OS,"It would seem I have always been the kind of person who does not realize what all the fuss is about until everybody else has settled down from the hooplah. Sex And The City is a shining example of this for me. My family home has never subscribed to HBO due to financial reasons so while the media and fans were all abuzz about these women I had no clue what the big deal was about.

After six seasons and perhaps another year or so I finally caught reruns on television (TBS I believe). Let me tell you .. my heart was aching and overjoyed simultaneously. While the personalities and story plots captivated me, there was also a sadness that all this was in the past. There would be no more new seasons to anticipate once I were to view the six seasons.

I have a difficult time ""bonding"" with modern day television. The drama and comedy shows I grew up watching in the 80s had a certain quality to them that had me tuning in religiously every week (i.e. Dallas, Knot's Landing, Three's Company, Dukes Of Hazzard, Sunday Night Movies, etc.). As an adult, I never thought I would stumble upon anything that would have me marking dates on the calendar so as not to miss the new season premiers and whatnot. But SATC just pulled me in and would not let go. I could not get enough of these women who seemed to ""preach to the choir' about all the various issues and quirks that we encounter with our male counterparts. It is a show that I personally am deeply grateful to have experienced.

As for the SATC Deluxe Edition DVD Set, I absolutely love it! The visual appeal is delicate and feminine. While some reviews point out the downsides to the firm fitting of the dvd sleeve slots I personally have had no difficulty in removing the discs. There was a small dark stain on one side of the white case. I do not know where it came from and I could have returned it for a replacement but I realize with a dusty home and a cat, more stains on this delicate exterior will probably occur over the span of time this item will spend in my care.

I would greatly recommend this deluxe edition for anyone who adores the show and wants their six seasons to be displayed in a classy unique fashion. While my boyfriend bought this for me as a Christmas gift, I believe it was one of the best $100 he ever spent on me :)",1360108800,9,2302,4.297235023041475

It's a ladies box set for sure, felted inside the front cover and then beautiful pictures throughout, as well as quotes from each season.  Loving the box set!",1359849600,2,485,4.161290322580645

Years later it came to my mind that i should buy some seasons of the show, because I enjoyed the few episodes that I did see. What really made me wanna purchase a few seasons was when I ended up unexpectedly seeing both sex and the city movies. I didn't know you could buy a complete collection like this so I was happy when I found this. It comes with all seasons and the two movies. Some of the reviews are saying that the packaging is a little too snug and you have to pull the disc out. It is true. It is snug and sometimes I have to really pull to get the discs out, but that doesn't make me love this product any less. I will just try to be careful and not break and scratch the discs.

6140804,5,B00H8KC1OS,"I must say, for all the complaining I have read about this set lacking in features and satisfaction, I must disagree- I couldn't be happier with my purchase. As a true fan of the series since it debuted in 1998, I have waited long and high for a DVD package that would be worth the price, and this one fits the bill. I'll go over in bullet points just why you'll love it as much as I do:

PACKAGING

In a lavish and lush layout, the creators really took the time to make this box set a true centerpiece for any coffee table. Like the 2006 pink set, the 2010 version is pure white, with a montage of New York City that, if looked at more precisely, is a trickle of memorable quotes from the show. Open it up, and you're treated to a chapter like book that encases each season in DVDs and gorgeous photos of the four women. There has been some grumbling about the difficulty of removing the DVDs from their slips because of the hard cardboard, but with a sturdy tug I got mine out with no problem at all- and it's nice they are inserted like this, because it keeps them snuggly in place. Each page in the Disc booklet is carefully crafted and beautiful to look at.

You get all 94 episodes from the series plus the two feature films. The added inclusion of the movies is a nice touch, even if you hated them (like I did the second).

FEATURES

I also read someone's review whining that there were no commentaries for Season 4- this person must have eye problems, because the commentaries are clearly on there. Season 3, 4, 5 & 6 all come with commentaries. If you bought the DVDs individually before, they are the same ones from Michael Patrick King- but it's nice to have them here none the less. Of all the commentaries King carefully implements and reflects about, it's funny that he failed to give one for ""The Real Me"", the season 4 classic that involves Carrie falling in a fashion show, and that earned King an Emmy for Outstanding Directing at the 2002 Emmy Awards.

There are also Deleted Scenes (though only a few) from all six seasons, that are all on the final disc for Season 6, part II. As well as documentaries, Round Table Discussions from the writers (new for the 2010 version), and Alternate Endings for the series finale.

PICTURE & AUDIO QUALITY

Of all the things the producers could have done, boosting the quality for the DVDs would have been a nice touch. They're watchable, no doubt, but especially if you watch them on higher end screens- you will notice the slight graininess from the earlier seasons and sometimes it is like watching old VHS tapes. Especially for a newer Deluxe Edition, this couldn't have been that difficult to do.

The audio was just fine- the music and voice-overs balanced perfectly.

For anyone who is a true fan of the series, this is the one to get. And all the DVDs worked fine- no glitches or skips. A true joy to own.",1350777600,56,2871,4.410207939508506
6140805,5,B00H8KC1OS,"I absolutely love this show. It is very entertaining for both women and men. I am not a person to follow series (I am not a TV person only like movies), yet alone go out of my way to purchase a series. This show has been the exception. It is the only show I will ever own as well (unless someone makes a similar show). It is fast paced, and most importantly it is realistic. These situations encountered happen, and I could relate to them (not all of course). Another important point I want to make is that there is no bias in this show. It is not telling you what should be or what is right. Every topic or problem encountered is left to interpretation and leaves you with a ""it depends"" kind of feeling. This in turn makes you want to talk about it with friends and discuss the topics with them. I related to different characters in different situations, so you won't necessarily relate to the same character's point of view throughout. I liked the variety. Really great job putting this show together. SATC rocks. Thanks for reading everyone.

PS: You will definitely laugh throughout as well, since there is a lot of comedy in it.",1350345600,3,1134,4.425837320574162

I love the design. The photos inside, with those memorable quotes, fantastic. I love how the best quotes are written all over the outside of the box. It's a large, book-style DVD case. It has pages covered with photos from the show and quotes pertaining to the seasons of the DVDs in each page. My only issue is how hard it is to get the DVDs out of the sleeves (the huge pages are sleeves for the DVDs obviously). I have to yank pretty hard, and then click them back into place when I put them back. It's great that they're so secure, since they definitely won't fall out. I just get a bit anxious about damaging the DVD. Overall, I absolutely love it and it's one of my favorite gifts. I recommend to any fan of this show!!

Had its good points and highlighted the ups and downs of maintaining friendships over time.

On Season two disk one the publisher of this box set edition wrote ""The awful truth"" for episodes 1 and 2 when episode 2 is suppose to be ""the freak show"".  Being a perfectionist, that seems to be a big error on the publishers part...a little disappointing.  Also I noticed the quality of the first season (so far) seems to be a little grainy.  I'm on season 2 which seems to be a little better. Two small things I noticed but otherwise I do love it.

Since the set opens and reads like a book, you pull the discs out from ""inside"" the pages, so to speak, (they aren't exposed and pop out, like most cases would have them) and they are pretty snug. I think I'm going to just manually make each sleeve wider as I watch them... It's annoying, but I don't think it will actually ruin the discs as some of the other reviewers state.

Like other reviewrs said, at firts, the DVD's are hard to pull out, but once you extract them out several times, they get out easily.
The pictures are really nice and the quality of the set screams ""classy & elegant"".

I'm owner of the previous 2005 collector's gift set, in hot pink, and I have to say that there're some extras missing in this one compared with the pink one (but the writers conversation compensates that. ( in the hot pink set there is more audio commentaries i, while in this set, they only included the audio commentaries on season 5 & 6. The hot pink also had them on season 4)
Like I said, the quality is the best of the best, and it's made with much more care and sturdiness so it will last you for ever.

The menu on each disc have been improved, and now it's the same in every season, but each season has the menu in one color (coinciding with the lettering on the description in the set)

There's a ""play all"" option, which is awesome.
Season 1,2,3,4 and 6 are split in 6 episodes per disc, and the 5th in 4 episodes per disc.

Extras:

Season 1
 - disc 2 :-Inside sex and the city (4min)

Season 2

Season 5
- disc 1 : -Audio commentary (anchors away)
- disc 2 :-Audio commentaries (plus 1 is the loneliest number + I love a charade)
  -Behind the scenes with Pat Field

- disc 2 :-Audio commentaries (boy, interrupted & one)
- disc 3 :-Audio commentaries (let there be light + Splat!)
- disc 4 :-Audio commentaries (an american in Paris part 1&2)

Very interesting revelations about guys and what they like about women...and what women love about guys. As for the ""problem"" with the cardboard holders being too tight, I had no such trouble. The discs are in plastic sleeves, so it's easy to pull them out. I just made sure I kept each plastic sleeve so that when I was done with the disc I could easily slide it back into the cardboard holder. I would recommend this for anyone who buys this collection. The cardboard COULD damage the discs if they weren't enclosed in the plastic sleeves. I haven't gotten to the films yet, but I look forward to seeing them as I've only seen film #1 so far.

As other reviews have stated, the discs are not exactly packaged in the best way, though I have had no problem with scratching.  I use a tissue to remove each disc simply because I know they are packaged in such a way that if I am not careful they will scratch.

The book is stunning, with amazing photos, and is beautifully put together.  It is a much better package than the previous series set, and at the current price of $106.00 on Amazon you cannot beat it.  This is a set you will be proud to display.

There's not much more than can be said about the series itself.  A true gem.

Even after reading the reviews about the packaging ""situation"" did not deter me, and I was bent on getting my hands on it.

Boy, I should have listened.

The boxset is really gorgeous and beautifully packaged, and the compliments end there. The discs were seriously lodged in the grooves very tightly and you really had to pull hard to get it out! Besides getting fingerprints on the disc, you also end up with a few little scratches, which in my opinion, shouldn't happen on a newly bought dvd, but more so from many years of watching it over and over again. And a couple of the discs even had problems playing smoothly, and I had to wonder whether it was a faulty disc, or from pulling it out and causing it to be scratched.

Such a beautiful boxset will definitely be a wonderful keepsake, but I have to wonder how long till it becomes so badly scratched that I will not be able to watch it, and it will just be sitting pretty on my shelf only to serve as a display piece.",1302048000,22,1238,4.469026548672566

Even my bf loved the concept of this deluxe edition and is hoping they have one for his shows. People have reviewed the discs are a little difficult to take out which is somewhat true but if you push together the opposite sides together they come out easier and this is only because they actually click in (so they don't just slide/fall out all the time).
The outside cover is covered in quotes and the inside is a nice velvety/suede. Inside are beautiful screen shots, pictures, and popular quotes from each season.
It's a must have for any SATC fan. Sure it's not blu-ray but really if you're going to watch it it's most likely in the room with a DVD player while your bf/husband are watching tv on the one with a blu-ray player. If he happens to not be home you can pop it in the blu-ray and it will upgrade the quality! Either way if you're a SATC fan you won't be disappointed!",1299542400,,970,4.306010928961749

Don't worry about the reviews that say that it's poorly designed. The snug fit for the DVD's keep it safe. Hope you make the right choice and get the complete collection (which comes with 4 bonus discs and the two movies!)",1298937600,,618,4.336206896551724
6140869,5,B00H8KC1OS,This is a great set for a great value!  Love the box and how all the DVD's are protected.  It's also great that both movies are included.,1298592000,,137,4.037037037037037
6140870,5,B00H8KC1OS,"Great show overall, but this set is packaged beautifully! It adds to the experience. I would recommend this set for all SATC lovers. :)",1298246400,,135,4.666666666666667
6140871,5,B00H8KC1OS,"My daughter and I are big fans of the Sex and the City series. I have been hinting to my kids for a long time that I wanted this collection, with no results. I finally decided to buy it as a birthday present for myself. I am glad I waited because the two movies were included. I can't tell you how much I love this collection. The packaging is beautiful, and all of the DVD play very well. My daughter and I have really enjoyed the episodes and the  movies, we watch them over and over and always find something that was missed. We are native New Yorkers so we really identify with the story lines. Carrie, Charlote, Miranda, and Samantha are four of the most funny and fabulous women and the men are gorgeous. Best purchase that I have made to date.",1298160000,,750,4.244755244755245
6140872,4,B00H8KC1OS,How nice is it to have the whole SATC collection all together. The only thing holding me back from 5 stars is the packaging. I'm afraid I'm going to scratch my DVD's from sliding it in and out of the slots.,1297641600,6,206,4.048780487804878
6140873,5,B00H8KC1OS,"I bought this on a whim one night, when Amazon had it on a Gold Box deal. I'd been eyeing the individual seasons at Target for a while, and this was $20 less than it would have been for just the seasons. Add the movies in there, and it would have been an extra $40. Even at the current price, this collection is a great deal.

The discs are a bit tricky to get out of the cardboard sleeves, but you just need to wipe the fingerprints off the disc. No harm done. The set is beautifully designed, covered in quotes from the show on the outside, and the extras are great.

The only bad thing about this collection is the second movie. Not because there's anything wrong with it, just because it's in it. ;)

If you're a dedicated fan of the series, you should definitely pick up this collection. I don't regret it at all.",1297555200,3,818,4.197452229299363
6140874,5,B00H8KC1OS,"I was lucky enough to buy this on an Amazon ""Deal of the Day"" and boy am I glad I got it! It arrived well packed and was in a box within the shipping box. After opening it up I was really impressed with the look and feel of the whole package. Like others have mentioned, the style of it with the velvet interior, beautiful pictures inside with quotes on overlying frosted pages, makes for a really great presentation of the series. It's like a big book, with the discs neatly tucked inside the pages, reaching the end of the book you get the movies and the bonus disc. It's really a nice package and for the people who love this series and enjoy it for the fun that it is, this is absolutely a must have collectible. It's so nice to have the whole shebang all in one place too! I suggest buying it on sale since even as a big fan I'll admit I would not pay $250 (the list price) for this, but for $150 or less, this is SO worth it. Totally recommended.",1296864000,15,952,4.096256684491979
6140875,1,B00H8KC1OS,"Cannot believe I sat for a few minutes of this show.  Extremely trashy, classless group of women. Gives women a bad name, image ,and reputation, not mention causes women AND men to expect women to behave in a certain way.  Lack of morality is promoted in this show.",1296777600,7,265,4.5
6140876,4,B00H8KC1OS,"I do not have anything negative to say about the presentation of this set - this book is stunning and well made.  Yes, the sleeves are a bit tight, but after one use, they loosened up and I do not foresee any damage happening to the discs.

That said, there are some things missing from this set making it incomplete. The bonus disc has new round-table discussions from the writers, which is nice, but excludes the original HBO two-part ""farewell"" special.  Also, I have the extended cut of the first movie and it feels incomplete to watch the theatrical cut.  I wasn't exactly expecting the extended cut, but it would have been nice to see here.

Overall, I am very happy with this beautiful collection, but slightly disappointed that it's not ""complete"" enough to be able to get rid of the individual seasons and movies.",1296777600,15,822,4.641379310344828
8630880,4,B00H8KC1OS,"I always liked this series, except for one thing that was always wrong with it:  it quickly turned into the Carrie-and-Big Show, instead of being about the misadventures of the four women as they learn from their mistakes, meet better and better men and get into better and better relationships.",1532563200,,295,4.9
